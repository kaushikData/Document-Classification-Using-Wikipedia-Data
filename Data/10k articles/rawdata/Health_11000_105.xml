Any person who induces an abortion may be imprisoned, and physicians who do so may be sentenced to [[penal labor|hard labor]]. Convictions are uncommon, because the prosecution must prove that the woman was pregnant and the means by which the pregnancy was interrupted.&lt;ref name="un2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="law" /&gt;

In 1998, [[Muhammad Sayyid Tantawy]], the [[Grand Imam of al-Azhar]], issued a [[fatwa]] calling for access to abortion for unmarried women who had been raped. In 2004 he approved a draft bill that would permit abortion in the case of rape; the bill was unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="Hessini"/&gt;

Despite legal restrictions, abortions are common. In a 2000 study of 1025 women from six villages in [[Upper Egypt]], 416 were found to have had at least one abortion; among this group, there were 265 abortions per 1000 live births.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yassin|first1=KM|title=Incidence and socioeconomic determinants of abortion in rural Upper Egypt|journal=Public Health|date=July 2000|volume=114|issue=4|pages=269–272|doi=10.1038/sj.ph.1900644}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abortions are carried out by indigenous methods, at clandestine clinics, or at great expense by private gynecologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lane|first1=Sandra D.|last2=Jok|first2=Jok Madut|last3=El-Mouelhy|first3=Mawaheb T.|title=Buying safety: The economics of reproductive risk and abortion in Egypt|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|date=October 1998|volume=47|issue=8|pages=1089–1099|doi=10.1016/S0277-9536(98)00129-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, unsafe abortions are common: a 1998 study found that about 20% of obstetric hospital admissions were for post-abortion treatment. One study estimated that between 1995 and 2000, there were 2,079,216 abortions, and 2,542 maternal deaths due to unsafe abortions.&lt;ref name="Hessini"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hessini|first1=Leila|title=Abortion and Islam: Policies and Practice in the Middle East and North Africa|journal=Reproductive Health Matters|date=May 2007|volume=15|issue=29|pages=75–84|doi=10.1016/S0968-8080(06)29279-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Andrew Duncan, the younger''' (1773–1832) was a British physician and professor at [[Edinburgh University]].{{sfn|Bettany|1888|p=163}}

==Life==
[[File:45 York Place, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|45 York Place, Edinburgh]]
He was the son of [[Andrew Duncan, the elder]] and his wife Elizabeth Knox, born at Adam Square in [[Edinburgh]] on 10 August 1773.{{sfn|Bettany|1888|p=163}} His early education was at the High School in Edinburgh. He was then apprenticed (1787–92) to Alexander and George Wood, surgeons of Edinburgh. He graduated M.A. at Edinburgh in 1793, and M.D. 1794.

Duncan studied in London in 1794–5 at the [[Windmill Street School]], under [[Matthew Baillie]], [[William Cumberland Cruikshank]], and [[James Wilson (anatomist)|James Wilson]]. He then made two long visits to the continent, studying medical practice in Göttingen,&lt;ref&gt;Johanna Oehler: ''»Abroad at Göttingen« Britische Studenten als Akteure des Kultur- Wissenstransfers 1735–1806'', Wallstein, Göttingen 2016, p. 289–326 (German)&lt;/ref&gt; Vienna, Pisa, and Naples, and meeting [[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]], [[Johann Peter Frank]], [[Antonio Scarpa]], and [[Lazzaro Spallanzani]]. Returning to Edinburgh, he became a fellow of the [[College of Physicians of Edinburgh]], and physician to the [[Royal Public Dispensary]], assisting his father also in editing the ''[[Annals of Medicine]]''. He later became physician to the Fever Hospital at [[Queensberry House]].{{sfn|Bettany|1888|p=163}}

In 1807, a professorship of [[medical jurisprudence]] and [[public health|medical police]] was created at Edinburgh, with Duncan as first professor, with an endowment of £100 per annum; but attendance at lectures in this subject was not made compulsory.{{sfn|Bettany|1888|p=163}}

From 1809 to 1822, he acted as secretary of ''senatus'' and librarian to the university; while from 1816 until his death he was an active member of the college commission for rebuilding the university, including the Adam-Playfair buildings. In 1819 he resigned his professorship of medical jurisprudence on being appointed joint professor with his father of the institutes of medicine. In 1821 he was elected without opposition professor of ''materia medica''.

In 1827, Duncan had a severe attack of fever, and his strength afterwards gradually declined. He lectured until nearly the end of the session 1831–2, and died at home 45 York Place&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1829-30&lt;/ref&gt; on 13 May 1832, in his fifty-eighth year.{{sfn|Bettany|1888|p=163}}

He is buried in [[Church of St John the Evangelist, Edinburgh|St Johns Churchyard]] on [[Princes Street]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Duncan in 1803 brought out the ''[[Edinburgh New Dispensatory]]'', an improved version of [[William Lewis (scientist)|William Lewis]]'s work. This became very popular, a tenth edition appearing in 1822. It was translated into German and French, and was several times republished in the [[United States]]. He published a supplement to it in 1829. From 1805, he was for many years chief editor of the ''[[Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal]]'', which gained a leading position.{{sfn|Bettany|1888|p=163}}

In 1809, he contributed to the ''Transactions'' of the [[Royal Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland|Highland Society]] a "Treatise on the Diseases which are incident to Sheep in Scotland". He also published in 1818 ''Reports of the Practice in the Clinical Wards of the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh''. Perhaps his most distinctive discovery was the isolation of the principle ''[[cinchonin]]'' from cinchona, as related in ''[[Nicholson's Journal]]'', 2nd ser. volume vi. December 1803.  Besides writing copiously in his own ''Journal'', he also wrote occasionally for the ''[[Edinburgh Review]]''.{{sfn|Bettany|1888|p=163}}

'''''Anopheles claviger''''' is a [[mosquito]] species found in [[Palearctic ecozone]] covering [[Europe]], [[North Africa]], northern [[Arabian Peninsula]], and northern [[Asia]]. It is responsible for transmitting [[malaria]] in some of these regions.&lt;ref name=kaiser&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaiser|first=Norbert Becker, Dusan Petric, Marija Zgomba, Clive Boase, Minoo Madon, Christine Dahl, Achim|title=Mosquitoes and Their Control|year=2010|publisher=Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg|location=Berlin, Heidelberg|isbn=978-3-540-92874-4|pages=166–168|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JIfgVr1f4IQC&amp;pg|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Muir|first=D.A.|author2=Keilany, M.|title=''Anopheles claviger'' meigen as a malaria vector in Syria|work=WHO Technical Documents|year=1972|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/65623/1/WHO_MAL_72.757.pdf?ua=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Knio|first=K.M.|author2=Markarian, N. |author3=Kassis, A. |author4= Nuwayri-Salti, N. |title=A two-year survey on mosquitoes of Lebanon|journal=Parasite|year=2005|volume=12|issue=3|pages=229–235|doi=10.1051/parasite/2005123229}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The mosquito is made up of a species complex consisting of ''An. claviger [[sensu stricto]]'' and ''An. petragnani'' Del Vecchio. ''An. petragnani'' is found only in western [[Mediterranean region]], and is reported to bite only animals, hence, it is not involved in human malaria.

It was on ''An. claviger'' that [[Giovanni Battista Grassi]] established the fact that only the female mosquitoes are responsible for transmitting malarial parasite ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]'' in humans.&lt;ref name=capanna&gt;{{cite journal|last=Capanna|first=E|title=Battista Grassi entomologist and the Roman School of Malariology|journal=Parassitologia|year=2008|volume=50|issue=3-4|pages=201–11|pmid=20055229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''An. claviger'' was known for breeding abundantly in the [[Åland Islands]] of Finland. As a result, [[malaria]] was endemic in the islands for at least 150 years, with severe malaria outbreaks being recorded in the 17th century, and in 1853 and 1862.&lt;ref name=protheropagew&gt;{{cite book|last=Prothero | first=G.W.| authorlink = George Walter Prothero | title=The Åland Islands | date=1920 | publisher=Great Britain.

==Scientific name==

''Anopheles claviger'' was first described by [[Johann Wilhelm Meigen]] in 1804. However due to its close resemblance with other anopheline mosquitoes, the systematics was variously changed. Originally Meigen named it ''Culex claviger'' which he changed it to ''An. bifurcutus'' in 1818. This was for a long period the accepted [[Binomial nomenclature|binomial]] but soon they realised that [[Carl Linnaeus]] had already used the name for the males of ''[[Culex pipiens]]''.&lt;ref name=kaiser/&gt; After a decade [[James Francis Stephens]] renamed it ''An. grisescens'' in 1828. A number of scientific names was introduced after they were discovered from one region after another. Some recognised synonyms are:&lt;ref name="WRBU"&gt;{{cite web|title=Anopheles claviger |url=http://www.wrbu.org/SpeciesPages_ANO/ANO_A-hab/ANcla_hab.html |publisher=he Walter Reed Biosystematics Unit |accessdate=26 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426232356/http://www.wrbu.org/SpeciesPages_ANO/ANO_A-hab/ANcla_hab.html |archivedate=26 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian biologists G. Del Vecchio in 1939 and G. Lupascu in 1941 were the first to notice that ''An. claviger'' comprised two morphologically distinct species. In 1962 M. Coluzzi revised the taxonomic status by classifying ''An. claviger'' as a species complex inclusive of ''An. petragnani''. The species could be identified only on small structural variation in the pupal stages,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zamburlini|first=R|title=Classification of ''Anopheles claviger'' (Diptera, Culicidae) in north-eastern Italy|journal=Parassitologia|year=1998 |language=Italian|volume=40|issue=3|pages=347–51|pmid=10376296}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is now identified using biochemical and molecular tools.&lt;ref name=kampen&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kampen|first=H|author2=Sternberg, A |author3=Proft, J |author4=Bastian, S |author5=Schaffner, F |author6=Maier, WA |author7= Seitz, HM |title=Polymerase chain reaction-based differentiation of the mosquito sibling species Anopheles claviger s.s. and Anopheles petragnani (Diptera: Culicidae)|journal=The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene|year=2003|volume=69|issue=2|pages=195–9|pmid=13677375}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schaffner|first=F|author2=Raymond, M |author3=Pasteur, N |title=Genetic differentiation of ''Anopheles claviger'' s.s. in France and neighbouring countries|journal=Medical and Veterinary Entomology|year=2000|volume=14|issue=3|pages=264–71|pmid=11016433|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2915.2000.00232.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schaffner|first=F|author2=Marquine, M |author3=Pasteur, N |author4= Raymond, M |title=Genetic differentiation of ''Anopheles claviger'' s.s. in Europe|journal=Journal of Medical Entomology|year=2003|volume=40|issue=6|pages=865–75|pmid=14765664 |doi=10.1603/0022-2585-40.6.865}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

Female ''An. claviger'' is distinguished from other related species from its brownish colour and dark palps. It is also generally larger than others. The proboscis is dark-brown while the antennae are brown. The scales on the wings are dark, evenly distributed without any dark spot. The thorax and abdomen are brown with lighter colour at the posterior end. ''An. petragnani'' are generally darker than typical ''An. claviger''. Males are basically similar but have complex arrangements of setae with dinstinct gonostyle.&lt;ref name=kaiser/&gt;

==Biology==

''An. claviger'' adults are most abundant in May and September during which maximum biting on humans takes place. The larval forms are most abundant during cold season from October to the next April. Larvae are generally found in cool and clean water. In the Mediterranean region they are commonly found in wells and water containers (very common in cisterns). In cold area the larvae [[hibernate]] during winter but in warmer climate, they do not hibernate although development is slow. Larvae of ''An. petragnani'' are slightly different in that they can tolerate higher water temperature. Therefore they can be found during summer under rockholes, ditches, canals and river banks. Mature larvae develop in the eggs 5 to 7 days after [[oviposition]]. Most eggs hatch within the next three days, but some may take up to one month. Females of the second generation (September) generally lay fewer eggs than those of the first generation (May). Egg maturation requires blood meal and about six days are required for blood digestion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Service|first=M. W.|title=The biology of ''Anopheles claviger'' (Mg.)

Unlike other anopheline mosquitoes which deposit their eggs directly on the water surface, female ''An. claviger'' lays eggs just above the water level but still in the wet area. They are zoophillic in that they bite mostly of large mammals including humans. There is no report ''An. petragnani'' in transmission of human malaria, indicating that they are exclusively zoophillic.&lt;ref name=kaiser/&gt;

==Scientific importance==

''An. claviger'' was experimentally used to discover the transmission of human malarial parasite ''P. falciparum'', along with the fact that only female anophelines can transmit malaria. Before 1898 it was not known how malaria was transmitted. The Italian biologist Giovanni Battista Grassi started investigating different mosquito species in the early 1898 on the basis of [[mosquito-malaria theory]]. He suspected that only certain species were involved in transmission of malaria. In September Battista reported the presence of malarial parasite in ''An. claviger'' indicating it as malaria vector. Battista performed human experimentation on Abele Sola, who had been a patient for six years in the Hospital of the Holy Spirit ([[Ospedale di Santo Spirito in Sassia]]) in Rome. With mutual consent Sola was bitten by malaria-infected mosquitoes for ten nights, and after few weeks he was down with tertian malaria. Battista and his colleagues [[Amico Bignami]], [[Giuseppe Bastianelli]] and [[Ettore Marchiafava]] continued to demonstrate the same experiments in other patients and were always successful. In November they found the parasites on the gut wall of the infected mosquitoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grove|first=David|title=Tapeworms, Lice and Prions : a Compendium of Unpleasant Infections|year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press, Inc.|location=Oxford, UK|isbn=978-0-19-964102-4|pages=131–132|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FHo9AgAAQBAJ&amp;dq=grassi+anopheles+claviger&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''P. falciparum''-carrying mosquito was no doubt the causative vector of malaria.

'''Anti-psychiatry''' is a [[Social movement|movement]] based on the view that psychiatric treatment is often more damaging than helpful to patients. It considers psychiatry a coercive instrument of oppression due to an unequal [[Power (social and political)|power relationship]] between doctor and patient and a highly subjective diagnostic process. It has been active in various forms for two centuries.&lt;ref name=tburns&gt;{{cite book|title=Psychiatry: A very short introduction |author=Tom Burns |year=2006 |work=Oxford University Press |pages=93–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nasral /&gt;

Anti-psychiatry originates in an objection to what some view as dangerous treatments.&lt;ref name=nasral /&gt; Examples include [[electroconvulsive therapy]], [[insulin shock therapy]], and brain [[lobotomy]].&lt;ref name=nasral /&gt; An immediate concern is the significant increase in prescribing psychiatric drugs for children.&lt;ref name=tburns /&gt;&lt;ref name=nasral&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.currentpsychiatry.com/fileadmin/cp_archive/pdf/1012/1012CP_Editorial.pdf |format=PDF |title=The antipsychiatry movement: Who and why |author=Henry A. Nasrallah |date=December 2011 |website=Current Psychiatry}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were also concerns about mental health institutions. All modern societies permit [[involuntary treatment]] or [[involuntary commitment]] of mental patients.&lt;ref name=tburns/&gt;

In the 1960s, there were many challenges to [[psychoanalysis]] and mainstream psychiatry, where the very basis of psychiatric practice was characterized as repressive and controlling. Psychiatrists involved in this challenge included [[Thomas Szasz]], [[Giorgio Antonucci]], [[R. D. Laing]], [[Franco Basaglia]], [[Theodore Lidz]], [[Silvano Arieti]], and [[David Cooper (psychiatrist)|David Cooper]]. Others involved were [[L. Ron Hubbard]], [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Erving Goffman]]. Cooper coined the term "anti-psychiatry" in 1967, and wrote the book ''Psychiatry and Anti-psychiatry'' in 1971.&lt;ref name=tburns/&gt;&lt;ref name=nasral/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pb.rcpsych.org/content/19/12/743.full.pdf |title=The rise and fall of anti-psychiatry|author=Mervat Nasser |date=1995 |website=Psychiatric Bulletin }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Szasz introduced the definition of mental illness as a myth in the book ''[[The Myth of Mental Illness]]'' (1961), Giorgio Antonucci introduced the definition of psychiatry as a prejudice in the book ''I pregiudizi e la conoscenza critica alla psichiatria'' (1986).

Contemporary issues of anti-psychiatry include freedom versus coercion, racial and social justice, [[Iatrogenesis|iatrogenic]]  effects of antipsychotic medications (unintentionally induced by medical therapy), personal liberty, social stigma, and the right to be different. 

== History ==

=== Precursors ===
The first widespread challenge to the prevailing medical approach in Western countries occurred in the late 18th century.&lt;ref name="Dain 1994" /&gt; Part of the progressive [[Age of Enlightenment]], a "[[moral treatment]]" movement challenged the harsh, pessimistic, [[Somatic theory|somatic]] (body-based) and restraint-based approaches that prevailed in the system of hospitals and "madhouses" for people considered mentally disturbed, who were generally seen as wild animals without reason.&lt;ref name="Dain 1994" /&gt; Alternatives were developed, led in different regions by ex-patient staff, physicians themselves in some cases, and religious and lay philanthropists.&lt;ref name="Dain 1994" /&gt; The moral treatment was seen as pioneering more humane psychological and social approaches, whether or not in medical settings; however, it also involved some use of physical restraints, threats of punishment, and personal and social methods of control.&lt;ref name="Dain 1994" /&gt; And as it became the establishment approach in the 19th century, opposition to its negative aspects also grew.&lt;ref name="Dain 1994" /&gt;

According to [[Michel Foucault]], there was a shift in the perception of madness, whereby it came to be seen as less about [[delusion]], i.e. disturbed judgment about the truth, than about a disorder of regular, normal behaviour or will.&lt;ref&gt;Foucault (1997), pp. 39-50&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault argued that, prior to this, doctors could often prescribe travel, rest, walking, retirement and generally engaging with nature, seen as the visible form of truth, as a means to break with artificialities of the world (and therefore delusions).&lt;ref&gt;Foucault (1997), p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Another form of treatment involved nature's opposite, the theatre, where the patient's madness was acted out for him or her in such a way that the delusion would reveal itself to the patient.

According to Foucault, the most prominent therapeutic technique instead became to confront patients with a healthy sound will and orthodox passions, ideally embodied by the physician. The cure then involved a process of opposition, of struggle and domination, of the patient's troubled will by the healthy will of the physician. It was thought the confrontation would lead not only to bring the illness into broad daylight by its resistance, but also to the victory of the sound will and the renunciation of the disturbed will. ''We must apply a perturbing method, to break the spasm by means of the spasm.... We must subjugate the whole character of some patients, subdue their transports, break their pride, while we must stimulate and encourage the others'' ([[Jean-Étienne Dominique Esquirol|Esquirol, J.E.D.]], 1816&lt;ref name=DelaFolie&gt;''De la Folie''. Chapter 5: ''Traitement de la folie,'' pp 132-133: in Foucault (1997), p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;). Foucault also argued that the increasing [[internment]] of the "mentally ill" (the development of more and bigger asylums) had become necessary not just for diagnosis and classification but because an enclosed place became a requirement for a treatment that was now understood as primarily the contest of wills, a question of submission and victory.
[[File:Kewwoodcut.png|thumb|left|175px|Close up of the "Horrors of [[Kew Asylum]]"
featured in Lee's Pictorial Weekly Budget Police News in 1876]]

The techniques and procedures of the asylums at this time included "isolation, private or public interrogations, punishment techniques such as cold showers, moral talks (encouragements or reprimands), strict discipline, compulsory work, rewards, preferential relations between the physician and his patients, relations of vassalage, of possession, of domesticity, even of servitude between patient and physician at times".&lt;ref name=DelaFolie /&gt; Foucault summarised these as "designed to make the medical personage the 'master of madness'"&lt;ref name=DelaFolie /&gt; through the power the physician's will exerts on the patient. The effect of this shift then served to inflate the power of the physician relative to the patient, correlated with the rapid rise of internment (asylums and forced detention).&lt;ref&gt;''De la Folie'': in Foucault (1997), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Woodilee Asylum - geograph.org.uk - 441329.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Woodilee Hospital]] was opened in 1875 in Scotland]]
Other analyses suggest that the rise of [[History of psychiatric institutions|asylums]] was primarily driven by [[industrialization]] and [[capitalism]], including the breakdown of the traditional family structures. And that by the end of the 19th century, psychiatrists often had little power in the overrun asylum system, acting mainly as administrators who rarely attended to patients, in a system where therapeutic ideals had turned into mindless institutional routines.&lt;ref name="Crossley2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Crossley, Nick |chapter=Contextualizing contention |title=Contesting Psychiatry: Social movements in Mental Health |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-415-35417-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RuGQSN6sBA8C}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, critics point to negative aspects of the shift toward so-called "moral treatments", and the concurrent widespread expansion of asylums, medical power and involuntary hospitalization laws, in a way that was to play an important conceptual part in the later anti-psychiatry movement.&lt;ref name="Crossley1998"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Nick |last=Crossley |url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=2352280 |title=R.

Various 19th-century critiques of the newly emerging field of psychiatry overlap thematically with 20th-century anti-psychiatry, for example in their questioning of the [[medicalisation]] of "madness". Those critiques occurred at a time when physicians had not yet achieved [[hegemony]] through psychiatry, however, so there was no single, unified force to oppose.&lt;ref name="Crossley1998" /&gt; Nevertheless, there was increasing concern at the ease with which people could be confined, with frequent reports of abuse and illegal confinement. For example, [[Daniel Defoe]], the author of ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'', had previously argued for more government oversight of "madhouses" and for due process prior to involuntary internment.&lt;ref&gt;Defoe, Daniel (1697). An Essay upon Projects. London: Cockerill&lt;/ref&gt; He later argued that husbands used asylum hospitals to incarcerate their disobedient wives,&lt;ref&gt;Defoe, Daniel (1728). Augusta Triumphans: Or, The Way To Make London The Most Flourishing City In The Universe.&lt;/ref&gt; and in a subsequent pamphlet that wives even did the same to their husbands.&lt;ref&gt;Defoe, Daniel (1740) quoted in {{Cite journal|pmc=2745864|year=2008|author1=Somasundaram|first1=O|title=Private psychiatric care in the past: With special reference to Chennai|journal=Indian Journal of Psychiatry|volume=50|issue=1|pages=67–69|doi=10.4103/0019-5545.39765|pmid=19771313}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also proposed that the role of asylum keeper be separated from doctor, to discourage exploitation of patients.&lt;ref&gt;Faulkner, B. (1789). Observation on the General and Improper Treatment of Insanity. London&lt;/ref&gt; There was general concern that physicians were undermining personhood by medicalizing problems, by claiming they alone had the expertise to judge it, and by arguing that mental disorder was physical and hereditary. The [[Alleged Lunatics' Friend Society]] arose in England in the mid-19th century to challenge the system and campaign for rights and reforms.&lt;ref name="Hervey1986"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hervey N |date=July 1986 |title=Advocacy or folly: the Alleged Lunatics' Friend Society, 1845–63 |journal= Medical History|volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=245–275 |pmc=1139650 |pmid=3523075 |doi=10.1017/S0025727300045701}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, [[Elizabeth Packard]] published a series of books and pamphlets describing her experiences in the Illinois insane asylum to which her husband had had her [[involuntary commitment|committed]].

Throughout, the [[Social class|class]] nature of [[mental hospital]]s, and their role as agencies of control, were well recognized. And the new psychiatry was partially challenged by two powerful social institutions – the church and the legal system. These trends have been thematically linked to the later 20th century anti-psychiatry movement.&lt;ref name="Dain1989"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dain |first=N. |year=1989 |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/112416171/abstract |title=Critics and dissenters: Reflections on anti-psychiatry in the United States |journal=Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=3–25|doi=10.1002/1520-6696(198901)25:1&lt;3::AID-JHBS2300250102&gt;3.0.CO;2-G|pmid=2647837}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As psychiatry became more professionally established during the nineteenth century (the term itself was coined in 1808 in Germany, as "Psychiatriein") and developed allegedly more invasive treatments, opposition increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kleinman |first=Arthur |title=Rethinking Psychiatry: From Cultural Category to Personal Experience |publisher=Collier Macmillan |year=1988 |location= |pages= |isbn=978-0-02-917442-5}}{{page needed|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Southern US, [[Slavery in the United States|black slaves]] and [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] encountered [[Drapetomania]], a pseudo-scientific diagnosis for why slaves ran away from their masters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ferris.edu/jimcrow/question/nov05.htm |title=Question of the Month – Jim Crow Museum at Ferris State University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was some organized challenge to psychiatry in the late 1870s from the new speciality of [[neurology]]. Practitioners criticized mental hospitals for failure to conduct scientific research and adopt the modern therapeutic methods such as nonrestraint. Together with lay reformers and social workers, neurologists formed the National Association for the Protection of the Insane and the Prevention of Insanity. However, when the lay members questioned the competence of asylum physicians to even provide proper care at all, the neurologists withdrew their support and the association floundered.&lt;ref name="Dain1989" /&gt;

=== Early 1900s ===
It has been noted that "the most persistent critics of psychiatry have always been former mental hospital patients", but that very few were able to tell their stories publicly or to confront the psychiatric establishment openly, and those who did so were commonly considered so extreme in their charges that they could seldom gain credibility.&lt;ref name="Dain1989" /&gt; In the early 20th century, ex-patient [[Clifford W. Beers]] campaigned to improve the plight of individuals receiving public psychiatric care, particularly those committed to state institutions, publicizing the issues in his book, ''A Mind that Found Itself'' (1908).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Clifford |last=Beers |title=A Mind That Found Itself |place=Pittsburgh and London |publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press |year=1981 |isbn=978-0-8229-5324-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Beers initially condemned psychiatrists for tolerating mistreatment of patients, and envisioned more ex-patient involvement in the movement, he was influenced by [[Adolf Meyer (psychiatrist)|Adolf Meyer]] and the psychiatric establishment, and toned down his hostility since he needed their support for reforms.

His reliance on rich donors and his need for approval from experts led him to hand over to psychiatrists the organization he helped found, the National Committee for Mental Hygiene which eventually became the National Mental Health Association.&lt;ref name="Dain1989" /&gt; In the UK, the National Society for Lunacy Law Reform was established in 1920 by angry ex-patients who sought justice for abuses committed in psychiatric custody, and were aggrieved that their complaints were patronisingly discounted by the authorities, who were seen to value the availability of medicalized internment as a 'whitewashed' extrajudicial custodial and punitive process.&lt;ref name="Fennell1996"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fennell|first=Phil |year=1996|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XqlBoZ_Vm7UC |title=Treatment Without Consent: Law, Psychiatry and the Treatment of Mentally Disordered People Since 1845 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-07787-3 |page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922, ex-patient Rachel Grant-Smith added to calls for reform of the system of neglect and abuse she had suffered by publishing "The Experiences of an Asylum Patient".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Rachel|last=Grant-Smith|year=1922|url=http://mcgovern.library.tmc.edu/data/www/html/texascoll/Psych/EAP/EAPContents.htm|title=The Experiences of an Asylum Patient|publisher=John P. McGovern Historical Collections and Research Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, [[We Are Not Alone (group)|We Are Not Alone]] (WANA) was founded by a group of patients at Rockland State Hospital in New York, and continued to meet as an ex-patient group.&lt;ref name="Reaume2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reaume |first=G |date=July 2002 |title=Lunatic to patient to person: nomenclature in psychiatric history and the influence of patients' activism in North America |journal=Int J Law Psychiatry |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=405–26 |doi=10.1016/S0160-2527(02)00130-9 |pmid=12613052}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s extreme hostility to psychiatrists and psychiatry was expressed by the French playwright and theater director [[Antonin Artaud]], in particular, in his book on [[van Gogh]]. To Artaud, imagination was reality. Much influenced by the [[Dada]] and [[surrealism|surrealist]] enthusiasms of the day, he considered [[dream]]s, thoughts and visions no less real than the "outside" world. To Artaud, reality appeared little more than a convenient consensus, the same kind of consensus an audience accepts when they enter a theater and, for a time, are happy to pretend what they're seeing is real.

In this era before [[penicillin]] was discovered, [[eugenics]] was popular. People believed [[M'Naghten rules#Disease of the mind|diseases of the mind]] could be passed on so [[compulsory sterilization]] of the [[Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring|mentally ill was enacted in many countries]].

=== Early 1930s ===
In the 1930s several controversial medical practices were introduced, including inducing seizures (by [[electroshock]], [[insulin]] or other drugs) or cutting parts of the brain apart ([[lobotomy]]). In the US, between 1939 and 1951, over 50,000 lobotomy operations were performed in mental hospitals. But lobotomy was ultimately seen as too invasive and brutal.&lt;ref name="Whitaker"&gt;{{cite book|last=Whitaker |first=Robert |title=Mad in America: Bad Science, Bad Medicine, and the Enduring Mistreatment of the Mentally Ill |publisher=Basic Books |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-7382-0799-5|title-link=Mad in America }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Holocaust]] historians argued that the [[medicalization]] of social programs and systematic [[euthanasia]] of people in German [[mental institution]]s in the 1930s provided the institutional, procedural, and doctrinal origins of the [[mass murder]] of the 1940s. The Nazi programs were called [[Action T4]] and [[Action 14f13]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lapon |first=Lenny |title=Mass Murderers in White Coats : Psychiatric Genocide in Nazi Germany and the United States |publisher=Psychiatric Genocide Research Inst |year=1986 |isbn=978-0-9614961-9-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.iprimus.com.au/burgess1/breggin.html |title=The Psychiatric Holocaust – excerpts}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Check1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Strous |first=Rael |url=http://www.annals-general-psychiatry.com/content/6/1/8 |title=Psychiatry during the Nazi era: ethical lessons for the modern professional |journal=Annals of General Psychiatry |volume=6 |issue=8 |year=2007|doi=10.1186/1744-859X-6-8|pages=8 |pmid=17326822 |pmc=1828151}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Nuremberg Trials]] convicted a number of psychiatrists who held key positions in Nazi regimes. For instance this idea of a Swiss psychiatrist: "A not so easy question to be answered is whether it should be allowed to destroy lives objectively 'unworthy of living' without the expressed request of its bearers. (...) Even in incurable mentally ill ones suffering seriously from hallucinations and melancholic depressions and not being able to act, to a medical colleague I would ascript the right and in serious cases the duty to shorten — often for many years — the suffering" (Bleuler, Eugen, 1936: "Die naturwissenschaftliche Grundlage der Ethik". Schweizer Archiv Neurologie und Psychiatrie, Band 38, Nr.2, S. 206).

=== 1940s and 1950s ===
The post-World War II decades saw an enormous growth in psychiatry; many Americans were persuaded that psychiatry and psychology, particularly [[psychoanalysis]], were a key to happiness. Meanwhile, most hospitalized mental patients received at best decent custodial care, and at worst, abuse and neglect.

The psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]] has been identified as an influence on later anti-psychiatry theory in the UK, and as being the first, in the 1940s and 50s, to professionally challenge psychoanalysis to reexamine its concepts and to appreciate psychosis as understandable. Other influences on Lacan included poetry and the surrealist movement, including the poetic power of patients' experiences. Critics disputed this and questioned how his descriptions linked to his practical work. The names that came to be associated with the anti-psychiatry movement knew of Lacan and acknowledged his contribution even if they did not entirely agree.&lt;ref name="Nasser1995"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Mervat |last=Nasser |url=http://pb.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/abstract/19/12/743 |title=The rise and fall of anti-psychiatry |journal=Psychiatric Bulletin |year=1995 |volume=19 |pages=743–746|doi=10.1192/pb.19.12.743|issue=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The psychoanalyst [[Erich Fromm]] is also said to have articulated, in the 1950s, the secular humanistic concern of the coming anti-psychiatry movement. In ''The Sane Society'' (1955), Fromm wrote ""An unhealthy society is one which creates mutual hostility [and] distrust, which transforms man into an instrument of use and exploitation for others, which deprives him of a sense of self, except inasmuch as he submits to others or becomes an automaton"..."Yet many psychiatrists and psychologists refuse to entertain the idea that society as a whole may be lacking in sanity. They hold that the problem of mental health in a society is only that of the number of 'unadjusted' individuals, and not of a possible unadjustment of the culture itself".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Levine |first=B. |date=10 September 2008 |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bruce-e-levine/thinking-critically-about_b_125019.html |title=Thinking Critically About Scientology, Psychiatry, and Their Feud |newspaper=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s new psychiatric drugs, notably the antipsychotic [[chlorpromazine]], slowly came into use. Although often accepted as an advance in some ways, there was opposition, partly due to serious adverse effects such as [[tardive dyskinesia]], and partly due their "chemical straitjacket" effect and their alleged use to control and intimidate patients.&lt;ref name="Whitaker" /&gt; Patients often opposed psychiatry and refused or stopped taking the drugs when not subject to psychiatric control.&lt;ref name="Whitaker" /&gt; There was also increasing opposition to the large-scale use of psychiatric hospitals and institutions, and attempts were made to develop [[Community mental health services|services in the community]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

In 1950, [[Scientology]] was founded by [[L. Ron Hubbard]] who publicly stated a goal of "eradicating psychiatry from the face of this earth". Instead through his book [[Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health]] the discredited use of introspection as treatment as well as auditing was promoted.&lt;ref name="Desai 2005 185–187"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Desai|first=Nimesh G.|date=2005|title=Antipsychiatry: Meeting the challenge|journal=Indian Journal of Psychiatry|volume=47|issue=4|pages=185–187|doi=10.4103/0019-5545.43048|issn=0019-5545|pmc=2921130|pmid=20711302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s in the United States, a [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] anti-mental health movement opposed psychiatry, seeing it as [[Liberalism in the United States|liberal]], [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]], subversive and [[Anti-Americanism|anti-American]] or pro-Communist. There were widespread fears that it threatened individual rights and undermined moral responsibility. An early skirmish was over the [[Alaska Mental Health Bill]], where the right wing protestors were joined by the emerging [[Scientology]] movement.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

The field of [[psychology]] sometimes came into opposition with psychiatry. [[Behaviorists]] argued that mental disorder was a matter of [[learning]] not medicine; for example, [[Hans Eysenck]] argued that psychiatry "really has no role to play". The developing field of [[clinical psychology]] in particular came into close contact with psychiatry, often in opposition to its methods, theories and territories.&lt;ref name="MicalePorter" /&gt;

=== 1960s ===
Coming to the fore in the 1960s, "anti-psychiatry" (a term first used by [[David Cooper (psychiatrist)|David Cooper]] in 1967) defined a movement that vocally challenged the fundamental claims and practices of mainstream psychiatry. While most of its elements had precedents in earlier decades and centuries, in the 1960s it took on a national and international character, with access to the mass media and incorporating a wide mixture of grassroots activist organizations and prestigious professional bodies.&lt;ref name="MicalePorter" /&gt;

Cooper was a South African psychiatrist working in Britain. A trained Marxist revolutionary, he argued that the political context of psychiatry and its patients had to be highlighted and radically challenged, and warned that the fog of individualized therapeutic language could take away people's ability to see and challenge the bigger social picture. He spoke of having a goal of "non-psychiatry" as well as anti-psychiatry.&lt;ref name="MicalePorter"&gt;{{cite book|first=Mark S. |last=Micale |first2=Roy |last2=Porter |year=1994 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h52sUVA3i20C |title=Discovering the History of Psychiatry |place=Oxford |publisher=University Press US |isbn=978-0-19-507739-1}}{{page needed|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

::"In the 1960s fresh voices mounted a new challenge to the pretensions of psychiatry as a science and the mental health system as a successful humanitarian enterprise. These voices included: Ernest Becker, Erving Goffman, R.D. Laing; Laing and Aaron Esterson, Thomas Scheff, and Thomas Szasz. Their writings, along with others such as articles in the journal ''[[The Radical Therapist]]'', were given the umbrella label "antipsychiatry" despite wide divergences in philosophy. This critical literature, in concert with an activist movement, emphasized the hegemony of medical model psychiatry, its spurious sources of authority, its mystification of human problems, and the more oppressive practices of the mental health system, such as involuntary hospitalisation, drugging, and electroshock".&lt;ref&gt;Ken Barney, [http://www.brown.uk.com/brownlibrary/BARNEY.htm Limitations of the Critique of the Medical Model], ''The Journal of Mind and Behaviour'', Winter and Spring 1994. Volume 15. Numbers 1 and 2, Pages 19-34.&lt;/ref&gt;

The psychiatrists [[R D Laing]] (from Scotland), [[Theodore Lidz]] (from America), [[Silvano Arieti]] (from Italy) and others, argued that "schizophrenia" and [[psychosis]] were understandable, and resulted from injuries to the inner self-inflicted by psychologically invasive "schizophrenogenic" parents or others.  It was sometimes seen as a transformative state involving an attempt to cope with a sick society. Laing, however, partially dissociated himself from his colleague Cooper's term "anti-psychiatry". Laing had already become a media icon through bestselling books (such as ''The Divided Self'' and ''[[The Politics of Experience]]'') discussing mental distress in an interpersonal [[Existentialism|existential]] context; Laing was somewhat less focused than his colleague Cooper on wider social structures and radical left wing politics, and went on to develop more romanticized or mystical views (as well as equivocating over the use of diagnosis, drugs and commitment). Although the movement originally described as anti-psychiatry became associated with the general [[counter-culture]] movement of the 1960s, Lidz and Arieti never became involved in the latter. [[Franco Basaglia]] promoted anti-psychiatry in Italy and secured reforms to mental health law there.

Laing, through the [[Philadelphia Association]] founded with Cooper in 1965, set up over 20 [[therapeutic communities]] including [[Kingsley Hall]], where staff and residents theoretically assumed equal status and any medication used was voluntary. Non-psychiatric [[Soteria (psychiatric treatment)|Soteria]] houses, starting in the United States, were also developed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Calton |first=T |last2=Ferriter |first2=M |last3=Huband |first3=N |last4=Spandler |first4=H |date=Jan 2008 |title=A systematic review of the Soteria paradigm for the treatment of people diagnosed with schizophrenia |url=http://schizophreniabulletin.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/34/1/181 |journal=Schizophrenia Bulletin |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=181–92 |doi=10.1093/schbul/sbm047 |pmid=17573357 |pmc=2632384}}&lt;/ref&gt; as were various ex-patient-led services.

Psychiatrist [[Thomas Szasz]] argued that "[[mental illness]]" is an inherently incoherent combination of a medical and a psychological concept. He opposed the use of psychiatry to forcibly detain, treat, or excuse what he saw as mere deviance from societal norms or moral conduct. As a [[Libertarianism|libertarian]], Szasz was concerned that such usage undermined personal rights and moral responsibility. Adherents of his views referred to "the myth of mental illness", after Szasz's controversial 1961 book of that name (based on a paper of the same name that Szasz had written in 1957 that, following repeated rejections from psychiatric journals, had been published in the American Psychologist in 1960&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Szasz |first=T. |year=1960 |title=The Myth of Mental Illness |url=http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Szasz/myth.htm |journal=American Psychologist |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=113–118 |doi=10.1037/h0046535}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Although widely described as part of the main anti-psychiatry movement, Szasz actively rejected the term and its adherents; instead, in 1969, he collaborated with [[Scientology]] to form the [[Citizens Commission on Human Rights]]. It was later noted that the view that insanity was not in most or even in any instances a "medical" entity, but a moral issue, was also held by [[Christian Scientists]] and certain [[Protestant]] [[fundamentalists]], as well as Szasz.&lt;ref name="Dain1989" /&gt; Szasz was not a Scientologist himself and was non-religious; he commented frequently on the parallels between religion and psychiatry.

[[Erving Goffman]], [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Félix Guattari]] and others criticized the power and role of psychiatry in society, including the use of "[[total institution]]s" and the use of models and terms that were seen as [[Social stigma|stigmatizing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://jrs.sagepub.com/content/94/3/148.full.pdf |format=PDF |title=Does psychiatry stigmatize? |journal=J R Soc Med |date=March 2001 |volume=94 |issue=3 |pages=148–149 |author=D Summerfield|pmid=11285802 |pmc=1297937 |doi=10.1177/014107680109400316 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The French [[sociologist]] and philosopher Foucault, in his 1961 publication ''[[Madness and Civilization]]: A History of Insanity in the Age of Reason'', analyzed how attitudes towards those deemed "insane" had changed as a result of changes in social values. He argued that psychiatry was primarily a tool of social control, based historically on a "great confinement" of the insane and physical punishment and chains, later exchanged in the moral treatment era for psychological oppression and internalized restraint. American sociologist Thomas Scheff applied [[labeling theory]] to psychiatry in 1966 in "Being Mentally Ill". Scheff argued that society views certain actions as deviant and, in order to come to terms with and understand these actions, often places the label of mental illness on those who exhibit them. Certain expectations are then placed on these individuals and, over time, they unconsciously change their behavior to fulfill them.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Observation of the abuses of psychiatry in the [[Soviet Union]] in the so-called [[Psikhushka]] hospitals also led to questioning the validity of the practice of psychiatry in the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aaas.org/news/releases/2003/1212reich.shtml |title=AAAS – AAAS News Release |publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the diagnosis of many [[political dissident]]s with schizophrenia led some to question the general diagnosis and punitive usage of the label [[schizophrenia]]. This raised questions as to whether the schizophrenia label and resulting involuntary psychiatric treatment could not have been similarly used in the West to subdue rebellious young people during family conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antipsychiatry.org/kendra-c.htm |title=Why Outpatient Commitment Laws Change (Almost) Nothing |author=Douglas A.

=== Since 1970 ===
[[File:Scientology psychiatry kills.jpg|right|thumb|[[Scientology|Scientologists]] on an anti-[[psychiatry]] demonstration.]]

New professional approaches were developed as an alternative or reformist complement to psychiatry. ''[[The Radical Therapist]]'', a journal begun in 1971 in North Dakota by Michael Glenn, David Bryan, Linda Bryan, Michael Galan and Sara Glenn, challenged the psychotherapy establishment in a number of ways, raising the slogan "Therapy means change, not adjustment." It contained articles that challenged the professional mediator approach, advocating instead revolutionary politics and authentic community making. [[Social work]], [[humanistic]] or [[existentialist]] therapies, [[family therapy]], [[counseling]] and [[self-help]] and clinical psychology developed and sometimes opposed psychiatry.

Psychoanalysis was increasingly criticized as unscientific or harmful.&lt;ref&gt;[[Adolf Grünbaum]]'s  ''The Foundations of Psychoanalysis: A Philosophical Critique''. Berkeley (University of California Press, 1984); ''Validation in the Clinical Theory of Psychoanalysis: A Study in the Philosophy of Psychoanalysis''. (International Universities Press, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to the popular view, critics and biographers of Freud, such as [[Alice Miller (psychologist)|Alice Miller]], [[Jeffrey Masson]] and [[Louis Breger]], argued that Freud did not grasp the nature of psychological trauma. Non-medical collaborative services were developed, for example therapeutic communities or Soteria houses.

The psychoanalytically trained psychiatrist Szasz, although professing fundamental opposition to what he perceives as medicalization and oppressive or excuse-giving "diagnosis" and forced "treatment", was not opposed to other aspects of psychiatry (for example attempts to "cure-heal souls", although he also characterizes this as non-medical). Although generally considered anti-psychiatry by others, he sought to dissociate himself politically from a movement and term associated with the radical left-wing. In a 1976 publication "Anti-psychiatry: The paradigm of a plundered mind", which has been described as an overtly political condemnation of a wide sweep of people, Szasz claimed Laing, Cooper and all of anti-psychiatry consisted of "self-declared [[socialists]], [[communists]], or at least anti-[[capitalists]] and [[collectivists]]".{{qn|date=January 2014}} While saying he shared some of their critique of the psychiatric system, Szasz compared their views on the social causes of distress/deviance to those of anti-capitalist anti-[[colonialists]] who claimed that [[Chile]]an poverty was due to plundering by American companies, a comment Szasz made not long after a [[CIA]]-backed coup had deposed the democratically elected Chilean president and replaced him with [[Pinochet]]. Szasz argued instead that distress/deviance is due to the flaws or failures of individuals in their struggles in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kotowicz |first=Zbigniew |year=1997 |title=R.D. Laing and the Paths of Anti-Psychiatry |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-11611-4 |page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The anti-psychiatry movement was also being driven by individuals with adverse experiences of psychiatric services. This included those who felt they had been harmed by psychiatry or who felt that they could have been helped more by other approaches, including those compulsorily (including via physical force) admitted to psychiatric institutions and subjected to compulsory medication or procedures. During the 1970s, the anti-psychiatry movement was involved in promoting restraint from many practices seen as psychiatric abuses.

The [[gay rights]] movement continued to challenge the classification of homosexuality as a mental illness and in 1974, in a climate of controversy and activism, the [[American Psychiatric Association]] membership (following a unanimous vote by the trustees in 1973) voted by a small majority (58%) to remove it as an illness category from the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]], replacing it with a category of "sexual orientation disturbance" and then "ego-dystonic homosexuality," which was deleted in 1987, although "gender identity disorder" (a widely used term for [[gender dysphoria]]) and a wide variety of "[[paraphilias]]" remain. It has been noted that gay activists at the time adopted many of Szasz's arguments against the psychiatric system, but also that Szasz had written in 1965 that: "I believe it is very likely that homosexuality is, indeed, a disease in the second sense [expression of psychosexual immaturity] and perhaps sometimes even in the stricter sense [a condition somewhat similar to ordinary organic maladies perhaps caused by genetic error or endocrine imbalance. Nevertheless, if we believe that by categorising homosexuality as a disease we have succeeded in removing it from the realm of moral judgement, we are in error."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Wright |editor-first=RH |editor2-last=Cummings |editor2-first=NA |year=2005 |title=Destructive Trends in Mental Health: The Well-intentioned Path to Harm |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-95086-2 |page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increased legal and professional protections, and a merging with [[human rights]] and [[disability rights]] movements, added to anti-psychiatry theory and action.

Anti-psychiatry came to challenge a "[[biomedical]]" focus of psychiatry (defined to mean [[genetics]], [[neurochemical]]s and [[pharmacology|pharmaceutic]] drugs). There was also opposition to the increasing links between psychiatry and [[pharmaceutical companies]], which were becoming more powerful and were increasingly claimed to have excessive, unjustified and underhand influence on psychiatric research and practice. There was also opposition to the codification of, and alleged misuse of, psychiatric diagnoses into manuals, in particular the American Psychiatric Association, which publishes the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders''.

Anti-psychiatry increasingly challenged alleged psychiatric pessimism and institutionalized alienation regarding those categorized as mentally ill. An emerging [[Psychiatric survivors movement|consumer/survivor movement]] often argues for full [[recovery model|recovery]], [[empowerment]], self-management and even full liberation. Schemes were developed to challenge [[social stigma|stigma]] and discrimination, often based on a [[social model of disability]]; to assist or encourage people with mental health issues to engage more fully in work and society (for example through [[social firms]]), and to involve service users in the delivery and evaluation of mental health services. However, those actively and openly challenging the fundamental ethics and efficacy of mainstream psychiatric practice remained marginalized within psychiatry, and to a lesser extent within the wider mental health community.

Three authors came to personify the movement against psychiatry, and two of these were practicising psychiatrists. The initial and most influential of these was [[Thomas Szasz]] who rose to fame with his book ''[[The Myth of Mental Illness]]'', although Szasz himself did not identify as an anti-psychiatrist.  The well-respected [[R. D. Laing|R D Laing]] wrote a series of best-selling books, including ''[[The Divided Self]]''.  Intellectual philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] challenged the very basis of psychiatric practice and cast it as repressive and controlling.  The term "anti-psychiatry" was coined by [[David Cooper (psychiatrist)|David Cooper]] in 1967.&lt;ref name=tburns/&gt;&lt;ref name=nasral/&gt; In parallel with the theoretical production of the mentioned authors, the Italian physician [[Giorgio Antonucci]] questioned the basis themselves of psychiatry through the dismantling of the psychiatric hospitals'' Osservanza'' and ''Luigi Lolli'' and the liberation – and restitution to life – of the people there secluded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nopazzia.it/Antonucci/marainiantonucci.htm|title=DACIA MARAINI INTERVIEWS GIORGIO ANTONUCCI|last=|first=|date=|website=|language=Italian|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2014-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Challenges to psychiatry ==

=== Civilization as a cause of distress ===
In recent years, psychotherapists [[David Smail (psychologist)|David Smail]] and [[Bruce E. Levine]], considered part of the anti-psychiatry movement, have written widely on how society, culture, politics and psychology intersect. They have written extensively of the "embodied nature" of the individual in society, and the unwillingness of even therapists to acknowledge the obvious part played by power and financial interest in modern Western society. They argue that feelings and emotions are not, as is commonly supposed, features of the individual, but rather responses of the individual to their situation in society. Even psychotherapy, they suggest, can only change feelings in as much as it helps a person to change the "proximal" and "distal" influences on their life, which range from family and friends, to the workplace, socio-economics, politics and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smail |first=David John |authorlink=David Smail (psychologist) |title=Power Interest and Psychology |publisher=PCCS Books |year=2005 |location=Ross-on-Wye, UK |isbn=978-1-898059-71-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LevineAlterNet&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alternet.org/authors/bruce-e-levine |title=Bruce E.

R. D. Laing emphasized [[family nexus]] as a mechanism whereby individuals become [[victimized]] by those around them, and spoke about a dysfunctional society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor-last=Fadul  |editor-first=Jose |title=Anti-psychiatry |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Theory &amp; Practice in Psychotherapy &amp; Counseling |date=2014 |publisher=Lulu Press Inc. |isbn=978-1-312-07836-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Laing |first=R.D. |year=1960 |title=The Divided Self: An Existential Study in Sanity and Madness |publisher=Penguin Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Laing |first=R.D. |last2=Esterson |first2=A. |lastauthoramp=yes |authorlink2=Aaron Esterson |year=1964 |title=Sanity, Madness and the Family |place=London |publisher=Penguin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inadequacy of clinical interviews used to diagnose 'diseases' ===

An etiology common to bipolar spectrum disorders has not been identified. Patients cannot be identified just by clinical interviews. A neurobiological basis of bipolar disorder has not been discovered. In making a bipolar spectrum disorder diagnosis based solely on a clinical interview, a false positive cannot be avoided.

Psychiatrists have been trying to differentiate mental disorders based on clinical interviews since the era of Kraepelin, but now realize that their diagnostic criteria are imperfect. Tadafumi Kato writes, "We psychiatrists should be aware that we cannot identify 'diseases' only by interviews.  What we are doing now is just like trying to diagnose diabetes mellitus without measuring blood sugar."&lt;ref name=Kato&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kato |first=Tadafumi |title=A renovation of psychiatry is needed |journal=World Psychiatry |date=October 2011 |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=198–199 |pmc=3188773 |pmid=21991278 |doi=10.1002/j.2051-5545.2011.tb00056.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Normality and illness judgments ===
[[File:Samuelcartwright.jpg|thumb|A madness of civilization: the American physician Samuel A. Cartwright identified what he called drapetomania, an ailment that caused slaves to be possessed by a desire for freedom and a want to escape]]

In 2013, psychiatrist [[Allen Frances]] said that "psychiatric diagnosis still relies exclusively on fallible subjective judgments rather than objective biological tests".&lt;ref name=frana&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=1722526 |title=The New Crisis in Confidence in Psychiatric Diagnosis |journal=Annals of Internal Medicine |volume=159 |issue=3 |pages=221–2 |author=Allen Frances |date=17 May 2013 |doi=10.7326/0003-4819-159-3-201308060-00655|pmid=23685989 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reasons have been put forward to doubt the [[ontic]] status of mental disorders.&lt;ref name=Phillips&gt;{{cite journal|last=Phillips |first=James |title=The Six Most Essential Questions in Psychiatric Diagnosis: A Pluralogue.

# Mental disorders are abstract entities that cannot be directly appreciated with the human senses or indirectly, as one might with macro- or microscopic objects.
# Mental disorders are not clearly natural processes whose detection is untarnished by the imposition of values, or human interpretation.
# It is unclear whether they should be [[Concept|conceived]] as abstractions that exist in the world apart from the individual persons who experience them, and thus instantiate them.&lt;ref name=Phillips /&gt;{{rp|13}}

In the scientific and academic literature on the definition or classification of mental disorder, one extreme argues that it is entirely a matter of value judgements (including of what is [[norm (sociology)|normal]]) while another proposes that it is or could be entirely [[objectivity (science)|objective]] and [[scientific]] (including by reference to statistical norms).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Berrios G E |title=Classifications in psychiatry: a conceptual history |journal=Aust N Z J Psychiatry |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=145–60 |date=April 1999 |pmid=10336212 |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&amp;sid=nlm:pubmed&amp;issn=0004-8674&amp;date=1999&amp;volume=33&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=145 |doi=10.1046/j.1440-1614.1999.00555.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common hybrid views argue that the concept of mental disorder is objective but a "fuzzy [[prototype]]" that can never be precisely defined, or alternatively that it inevitably involves a mix of scientific facts and subjective value judgments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Perring |first=C. |year=2005 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mental-illness/ |title=Mental Illness |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One remarkable example of psychiatric diagnosis being used to reinforce cultural bias and oppress dissidence is the diagnosis of [[drapetomania]]. In the US prior to the American Civil War, physicians such as [[Samuel A. Cartwright]] diagnosed some slaves with drapetomania, a mental illness in which the slave possessed an irrational desire for freedom and a tendency to try to escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sharkey |first=Joe |authorlink=Joe Sharkey |title=Bedlam: greed, profiteering and fraud in a mental system gone crazy |publisher=St. Martin's Press |year=1994 |location=NY |page=182 |isbn=978-0-312-10421-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; By classifying such a dissident mental trait as abnormal and a disease, psychiatry promoted cultural bias about normality, abnormality, health, and unhealth. This example indicates the probability for not only [[cultural bias]] but also [[confirmation bias]] and [[bias blind spot]] in psychiatric diagnosis and psychiatric beliefs{{Citation needed|reason=this example is not enough to establish a particular pattern of bias. Please provide more evidence that this weakness exists and still applies to modern psychiatry.|date=December 2011}}.

It has been argued by philosophers like Foucault that characterizations of "mental illness" are [[indeterminacy in philosophy|indeterminate]] and reflect the hierarchical structures of the societies from which they emerge rather than any precisely defined qualities that distinguish a "healthy" mind from a "sick" one. Furthermore, if a tendency toward self-harm is taken as an elementary symptom of mental illness, then humans, ''as a species'', are arguably insane in that they have tended throughout recorded history to destroy their own environments, to make war with one another, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foucault |first=Michel |title=Madness and Civilization: a History of Insanity in the Age of Reason |publisher=Vintage Books |year=1988 |location=New York |isbn=978-0-394-71914-6|title-link=Madness and Civilization }}{{page needed|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of these diagnostic categories are called "disorders" and are not validated by biological criteria, as most medical diseases are; although they purport to represent medical diseases and take the form of medical diagnoses.&lt;ref name=Katsching /&gt; These diagnostic categories are actually embedded in top-down classifications, similar to the early botanic classifications of plants in the 17th and 18th centuries, when experts decided a priori about which classification criterion to use, for instance, whether the shape of leaves or fruiting bodies were the main criterion for classifying plants.&lt;ref name=Katsching /&gt; Since the era of Kraepelin, psychiatrists have been trying to differentiate mental disorders by using clinical interviews.&lt;ref name="Kato"/&gt;

In 1972, psychologist [[David Rosenhan]] published the [[Rosenhan experiment]], a study questioning the validity of psychiatric diagnoses.&lt;ref name=Rosenhan&gt;{{cite journal|author=Rosenhan D |year=1973 |title=On being sane in insane places |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/179/4070/250 |journal=Science |volume=179 |issue=4070 |pages=250–258 |doi=10.1126/science.179.4070.250 |pmid=4683124 |subscription=yes|bibcode=1973Sci...179..250R }} {{link note|note=URL given leads to abstract of study}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study arranged for eight individuals with no history of psychopathology to attempt admission into psychiatric hospitals. The individuals included a graduate student, psychologists, an artist, a housewife, and two physicians, including one psychiatrist. All eight individuals were admitted with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Psychiatrists then attempted to treat the individuals using psychiatric medication. All eight were discharged within 7 to 52 days. In a [[Rosenhan experiment#The non-existent impostor experiment|later part of the study]], psychiatric staff were warned that pseudo-patients might be sent to their institutions, but none were actually sent. Nevertheless, a total of 83 patients out of 193 were believed by at least one staff member to be actors. The study concluded that individuals without mental disorders were indistinguishable from those suffering from mental disorders.&lt;ref name=Rosenhan /&gt;

Critics such as [[Robert Spitzer (psychiatrist)|Robert Spitzer]] placed doubt on the validity and credibility of the study, but did concede that the consistency of psychiatric diagnoses needed improvement.&lt;ref name=Spitzer2005&gt;{{cite journal|author=Spitzer R.L. |author2=Lilienfeld S.O. |author3=Miller M.B. |year=2005 |title=Rosenhan revisited: The scientific credibility of Lauren Slater's pseudopatient diagnosis study |journal=Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease |volume=193 |issue=11 |pages=734–739 |pmid=16260927 |doi=10.1097/01.nmd.0000185992.16053.5c }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now realized that the psychiatric diagnostic criteria are not perfect. To further refine psychiatric diagnosis, according to Tadafumi Kato, the only way is to create a new classification of diseases based on the neurobiological features of each mental disorder.&lt;ref name=Kato /&gt; On the other hand, according to Heinz Katsching, neurologists are advising psychiatrists just to replace the term "mental illness" by "brain illness."&lt;ref name=Katsching /&gt;

There are recognized problems regarding the diagnostic reliability and validity of mainstream psychiatric diagnoses, both in ideal and controlled circumstances&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Williams |first=J.B. |title=The structured clinical interview for DSM-III-R (SCID) II: Multi-site test-retest reliability |journal=Archives of General Psychiatry |volume=49 |pages=630–36 |year=1992 |pmid=1637253 |issue=8 |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.1992.01820080038006|first2=M|last3=First |first3=MB|last4=Spitzer |first4=RL|last5=Davies |first5=M|last6=Borus |first6=J|last7=Howes |first7=MJ|last8=Kane |first8=J|last9=Pope Jr |first9=HG|last10=Rounsaville |first10=B|last2=Gibbon }}&lt;/ref&gt; and even more so in routine clinical practice (McGorry ''et al.''. 1995).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Spurious precision: procedural validity of diagnostic assessment in psychotic disorders |accessdate=2006-07-02 |first=PD |last=McGorry |first2=C |last2=Mihalopoulos |first3=L |last3=Henry |first4=J |last4=Dakis |first5=HJ |last5=Jackson |first6=M |last6=Flaum |first7=S |last7=Harrigan |first8=D |last8=McKenzie |first9=J |last9=Kulkarni |first10=R |last10=Karoly |displayauthors=9 |year=1995 |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=152 |pages=220–223 |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/abstract/152/2/220 |issue=2 |pmid=7840355 |doi=10.1176/ajp.152.2.220|citeseerx=10.1.1.469.3360 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Criteria in the principal diagnostic manuals, the DSM and [[ICD]], are inconsistent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=van Os |first=J. |title=A comparison of the utility of dimensional and categorical representations of psychosis |journal=Psychological Medicine |volume=29 |pages=595–606 |year=1999 |pmid=10405080 |issue=3 |doi=10.1017/S0033291798008162|first2=C.|last3=Bale |first3=R.|last4=Van Horn |first4=E.|last5=Tattan |first5=T.|last6=White |first6=I.|last7=Murray |first7=R.|last2=Gilvarry }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some psychiatrists who criticize their own profession say that [[comorbidity]], when an individual meets criteria for two or more disorders, is the rule rather than the exception. There is much overlap and vaguely defined or changeable boundaries between what psychiatrists claim are distinct illness states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rossinst.com/trauma.htm |title=The Ross Institute – Trauma |publisher=The Colin A. Ross Institute for Psychological Trauma |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706115955/http://www.rossinst.com/trauma.htm |archivedate=July 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also problems with using standard diagnostic criteria in different countries, cultures, genders or ethnic groups. Critics often allege that Westernized, white, male-dominated psychiatric practices and diagnoses disadvantage and misunderstand those from other groups. For example, several studies have shown that [[African Americans]] are more often diagnosed with schizophrenia than Caucasians,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/44303 |title=The influence of racial factors on psychiatric diagnosis: a review and suggestions for research|journal=Community Mental Health Journal|year=1989|volume=25|issue=4|pages=301–311|doi=10.1007/BF00755677|pmid=2697490|last=Neighbors |first=HW |last2=Jackson |first2=JS |last3=Campbell |first3=L |last4=Williams |first4=D|citeseerx=10.1.1.547.8240}}&lt;/ref&gt; and men more than women. Some within the anti-psychiatry movement are critical of the use of diagnosis as it conforms with the [[biomedical model]].

=== Tool of social control ===
[[File:Whitchurch Hospital Corridor Abandoned West5 Ward.jpg|thumb|right|Whitchurch Hospital.]]
According to Franco Basaglia, [[Giorgio Antonucci]], [[Bruce E. Levine]] and Edmund Schönenberger whose approach pointed out the role of psychiatric institutions in the control and medicalization of [[Deviance (sociology)|deviant behaviors]] and social problems, psychiatry is used as the provider of scientific support for social control to the existing establishment, and the ensuing standards of deviance and normality brought about repressive views of discrete social groups.&lt;ref name=LevineAlterNet /&gt;&lt;ref name="Antonucci 1986"&gt;{{cite book|last=Antonucci |first=Giorgio |title=I pregiudizi e la conoscenza critica alla psichiatria (preface by Thomas Szasz)|trans-title=The prejudices and critical knowledge to psychiatry|editor-last=Coppola|editor-first=Alessio |edition=1st |publisher=Apache Cooperative Ltd |place=Rome |year=1986}}{{page needed|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sapouna"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sapouna |first1=Lydia |last2=Herrmann |first2=Peter |title=Knowledge in Mental Health: Reclaiming the Social |url=https://books.google.com/?id=y1-X6iP-m9UC&amp;pg=PA70 |publisher=Nova Publishers |location=Hauppauge |year=2006 |page=70 |isbn=978-1-59454-812-3 |accessdate=2014-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|70}} According to Mike Fitzpatrick, resistance to medicalization was a common theme of the gay liberation, anti-psychiatry, and feminist movements of the 1970s, but now there is actually no resistance to the advance of government intrusion in lifestyle if it is thought to be justified in terms of public health.&lt;ref name=Fitzpatrick&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fitzpatrick |first=Mike |title=From 'nanny state' to 'therapeutic state' |journal=[[The British Journal of General Practice]] |date=August 2004 |volume=54 |issue=505 |page=645 |pmc=1324868 |pmid=15517694}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the opinion of Mike Fitzpatrick, the pressure for medicalization also comes from society itself. As one example, Fitzpatrick claims that feminists who once opposed state intervention as oppressive and patriarchal, now demand more coercive and intrusive measures to deal with child abuse and domestic violence.&lt;ref name=Fitzpatrick /&gt; According to Richard Gosden, the use of psychiatry as a tool of social control is becoming obvious in preventive medicine programmes for various mental diseases.&lt;ref name="Gosden"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gosden |first=Richard |title=Punishing the Patient: How Psychiatrists Misunderstand and Mistreat Schizophrenia |year=2001 |publisher=Scribe Publications |location=Melbourne |isbn=978-0-908011-52-0 |page=14 |url=https://sites.google.com/site/punishingthepatient/human-rights/social-control}} {{link note|note=[http://sites.google.com/site/punishingthepatient/home The text of the book in full is available online]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|14}} These programmes are intended to identify children and young people with divergent behavioral patterns and thinking and send them to treatment before their supposed mental diseases develop.&lt;ref name="Gosden" /&gt;{{rp|14}} Clinical guidelines for best practice in Australia include the risk factors and signs which can be used to detect young people who are in need of prophylactic drug treatment to prevent the development of schizophrenia and other psychotic conditions.&lt;ref name="Gosden" /&gt;{{rp|14}}

=== Psychiatry and the pharmaceutical industry ===
Critics of psychiatry commonly express a concern that the path of diagnosis and treatment in contemporary society is primarily or overwhelmingly shaped by profit prerogatives, echoing a common criticism of general medical practice in the United States, where many of the largest psychopharmaceutical producers are based.&lt;ref name=LevineAlterNet /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moynihan |first=Ray and Alan Cassels |title=Selling Sickness: How the World's Biggest Pharmaceutical Companies are Turning Us All Into Patients|publisher=Nation Books |year=2006 |isbn=978-1-56025-697-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychiatric research has demonstrated varying degrees of [[efficacy]] for improving or managing a number of mental health disorders through either medications, psychotherapy, or a combination of the two. Typical psychiatric medications include [[stimulant]]s, [[antidepressant]]s, [[anxiolytic]]s, and [[antipsychotic]]s (neuroleptics).

On the other hand, organizations such as [[MindFreedom International]] and [[World Network of Users and Survivors of Psychiatry]] maintain that psychiatrists exaggerate the evidence of medication and minimize the evidence of [[adverse drug reaction]]. They and other [[Psychiatric survivors movement|activists]] believe individuals are not given balanced information, and that current psychiatric medications do not appear to be specific to particular disorders in the way mainstream psychiatry asserts;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.karger.com/ProdukteDB/produkte.asp?doi=83999 |title=Rethinking Models of Psychotropic Drug Action}}&lt;/ref&gt; and psychiatric drugs not only fail to correct measurable chemical imbalances in the brain, but rather induce undesirable side effects. For example, though children on [[Ritalin]] and other psycho-stimulants become more obedient to parents and teachers,&lt;ref name="Reclaiming"&gt;{{cite book|last=Breggin |first=Peter |title=Reclaiming Your Children: A healing Plan for a Nation in Crisis |publisher=Perseus Publishing |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; critics have noted that they can also develop abnormal movements such as tics, spasms and other involuntary movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://breggin.com/Newstimulants.pdf |format=PDF |title=Psychostimulants in the treatment of children diagnosed with ADHD: Risks and mechanism of action |author=Peter R. Breggin}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has not been shown to be directly related to the therapeutic use of stimulants, but to neuroleptics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/10/health/10psyche.html?_r=2&amp;hp=&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;oref=slogin&amp;adxnnlx=1178770545-7MBrQtesB6MQppWK6ofwBw&amp;oref=slogin |title=Psychiatrists, Children and Drug Industry’s Role |author1=Gardiner Harris |author2=Benedict Carey |author3=Janet Roberts |date=May 10, 2007 |newspaper=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2006-05-01-atypical-drugs_x.htm |title=New antipsychotic drugs carry risks for children |author=Marilyn Elias |others=Contributing: Susan O'Brian |date=May 2, 2006 |newspaper=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diagnosis of [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] on the basis of inattention to compulsory schooling also raises critics' concerns regarding the use of psychoactive drugs as a means of unjust [[social control]] of children.&lt;ref name="Reclaiming" /&gt;

The influence of pharmaceutical companies is another major issue for the anti-psychiatry movement. As many critics from within and outside of psychiatry have argued, there are many financial and professional links between psychiatry, regulators, and pharmaceutical companies. Drug companies routinely fund much of the research conducted by psychiatrists, advertise medication in psychiatric journals and conferences, fund psychiatric and healthcare organizations and health promotion campaigns, and send representatives to lobby general physicians and politicians. [[Peter Breggin]], Sharkey, and other investigators of the psycho-pharmaceutical industry maintain that many psychiatrists are members, shareholders or special advisors to pharmaceutical or associated regulatory organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gosden |first=Richard |last2=Beder |first2=Sharon |lastauthoramp=yes |url=http://www.herinst.org/sbeder/corppower/pharm-agenda.html |title=Pharmaceutical Industry Agenda Setting in Mental Health Policies |journal=Ethical Human Sciences and Services |volume=3|issue=3 |date=Fall–Winter 2001 |pages=147–159|pmid=15278977}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Thomas Ginsberg|url=http://mindfreedom.org/campaign/media/mf/inquirer-on-drug-firms/ |title=Donations tie drug firms and nonprofits |newspaper=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] |date=28 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is evidence that research findings and the prescribing of drugs are influenced as a result. A United Kingdom cross-party [[parliamentary inquiry]] into the influence of the pharmaceutical industry in 2005 concludes: "The influence of the pharmaceutical industry is such that it dominates clinical practice"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmselect/cmhealth/42/42.pdf |format=PDF |title=House of Commons Health Committee: The Influence of the Pharmaceutical Industry (Fourth Report of Session 2002–2005) |page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that there are serious regulatory failings resulting in "the unsafe use of drugs; and the increasing medicalization of society".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmselect/cmhealth/42/42.pdf |format=PDF |title=House of Commons Health Committee: The Influence of the Pharmaceutical Industry (Fourth Report of Session 2002–2005) |page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign organization ''No Free Lunch'' details the prevalent acceptance by medical professionals of free gifts from pharmaceutical companies and the effect on psychiatric practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nofreelunch.org/ |title=No Free Lunch (main page) |accessdate=2014-01-13 |website=Nofreelunch.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ghostwriting of articles by pharmaceutical company officials, which are then presented by esteemed psychiatrists, has also been highlighted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,6903,1101680,00.html |title=Revealed: how drug firms 'hoodwink' medical journals &amp;#124; Society &amp;#124; The Observer |newspaper=The Observer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Systematic reviews have found that trials of psychiatric drugs that are conducted with pharmaceutical funding are several times more likely to report positive findings than studies without such funding.&lt;ref name="NIHCM 2001"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nihcm.org/pdf/spending2001.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=National Institute for Health Care Management Foundation |title=Prescription Drug Expenditures in 2001: A report by The National Institute for Health Care Management Research and Educational Foundation (May 2002): Another Year of Escalating Costs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of psychiatric drug prescriptions have been increasing at an extremely high rate since the 1950s and show no sign of abating.&lt;ref name="Whitaker" /&gt; In the United States antidepressants and tranquilizers are now the top selling class of prescription drugs, and neuroleptics and other psychiatric drugs also rank near the top, all with expanding sales.&lt;ref name="NIHCM 2001" /&gt; As a solution to the apparent conflict of interests, critics propose legislation to separate the pharmaceutical industry from the psychiatric profession.

[[John Read (psychologist)|John Read]] and [[Bruce E. Levine]] have advanced the idea of socioeconomic status as a significant factor in the development and prevention of mental disorders such as schizophrenia and have noted the reach of pharmaceutical companies through industry sponsored websites as promoting a more biological approach to mental disorders, rather than a comprehensive biological, psychological and social model.&lt;ref name=LevineAlterNet /&gt;&lt;ref name=Read&gt;{{cite journal|last=Read |first=John |authorlink=John Read (psychologist) |title=Can Poverty Drive You Mad?

=== Electroconvulsive therapy ===
{{Main|Electroconvulsive therapy}}
[[File:Bergonic chair.jpg|thumb|A Bergonic chair "for giving general electric treatment for psychological effect, in psycho-neurotic cases", according to original photo description. World War I era.]]
Psychiatrists may advocate psychiatric drugs, psychotherapy or more controversial interventions such as electroshock or [[psychosurgery]] to treat mental illness. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is administered worldwide typically for severe mental disorders. Across the globe it has been estimated that approximately 1&amp;nbsp;million patients receive ECT per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=J. |last=Prudic |first2=M. |last2=Olfson |first3=H.A. |last3=Sackeim |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=80606 |title=Electro-convulsive therapy practices in the community |doi=10.1017/S0033291701003750 |pmid=11459391 |journal=Psychological Medicine |date=July 2001 |volume=31 |issue=5 |pages=929–934 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Exact numbers of how many persons per year have ECT in the United States are unknown due to the variability of settings and treatment. Researchers' estimates generally range from 100,000 to 200,000 persons per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ect.org/paper-on-ect-statistics-at-mh-stats-conference |title=Paper on ECT statistics at MH Stats Conference – ect.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some persons receiving ECT die during the procedure (ECT is performed under a general anaesthetic, which always carries a risk). [[Leonard Roy Frank]] writes that estimates of ECT-related death rates vary widely. The lower estimates include: • 2-4 in 100,000 (from Kramer's 1994 study of 28,437 patients)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kramer|first=B.

=== "Therapeutic state" ===
The "therapeutic state" is a phrase coined by Szasz in 1963.&lt;ref name=Baker&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baker |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert A.

Faced with the problem of "madness", Western individualism proved to be ill-prepared to defend the rights of the individual: modern man has no more right to be a madman than medieval man had a right to be a heretic because if once people agree that they have identified the one true God, or Good, it brings about that they have to guard members and nonmembers of the group from the temptation to worship false gods or goods.&lt;ref name="Szasz, 2001" /&gt;{{rp|496}} A secularization of God and the medicalization of good resulted in the post-Enlightenment version of this view: once people agree that they have identified the one true reason, it brings about that they have to guard against the temptation to worship unreason—that is, madness.&lt;ref name="Szasz, 2001" /&gt;{{rp|496}}

== Law ==
{{Globalize|date=January 2010}}
While the insanity defense is the subject of controversy as a viable excuse for wrongdoing, Szasz and other critics contend that being committed in a [[psychiatric hospital]] can be worse than criminal imprisonment, since it involves the risk of compulsory medication with neuroleptics or the use of electroshock treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Szasz |first=Thomas |title=Law, Liberty, and Psychiatry: An Inquiry into the Social Uses of Mental Health Practices |publisher=Syracuse University Press; Reprint edition |year=1989 |isbn=978-0-8156-0242-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stopshrinks.org/yoder/index.htm |title=Mental Illness On Trial: The Rodney Yoder Story |website=Stopshrinks.org}}{{unreliable source?|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, while a criminal imprisonment has a predetermined and known time of duration, patients are typically committed to psychiatric hospitals for indefinite durations, an unjust and arguably outrageous imposition of fundamental uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Szasz |first=Thomas |title=Patient or Prisoner? |journal=Ideas on Liberty |volume=52 |pages=31–32 |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that such uncertainty risks aggravating mental instability, and that it substantially encourages a lapse into hopelessness and acceptance that precludes recovery.

=== Involuntary hospitalization ===
{{Main|Involuntary commitment|involuntary treatment}}
Critics see the use of legally sanctioned force in involuntary commitment as a violation of the fundamental principles of free or open societies. The political philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]] and others have argued that society has no right to use coercion to subdue an individual as long as he or she does not harm others. Mentally ill people are essentially no more prone to violence than sane individuals, despite Hollywood and other media portrayals to the contrary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.unchealthcare.org/site/newsroom/news/2009/January/elbogen/ |title=UNC study: Mental illness by itself does not predict future violent behavior |publisher=UNC Health Care |date=February 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sciencenews.org/sn_arc98/5_16_98/fob1.htm |title=Search Content &amp;#124; Science News |publisher=Science News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The growing practice, in the United Kingdom and elsewhere, of [[Care in the Community]] was instituted partly in response to such concerns. Alternatives to involuntary hospitalization include the development of non-medical crisis care in the community.

In the case of people suffering from severe psychotic crises, the American [[Soteria (psychiatric treatment)|Soteria]] project used to provide what was argued to be a more humane and compassionate alternative to coercive psychiatry. The Soteria houses closed in 1983 in the United States due to lack of financial support. However, similar establishments are presently flourishing in Europe, especially in Sweden and other North European countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ahrp.org/infomail/04/07/13.php |title=Dr. Loren Mosher, 1933–2004 |accessdate=2014-01-13 |date=13 July 2004 |publisher=Alliance for Human Research Protection}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The physician [[Giorgio Antonucci]], during his activity as a director of the ''Ospedale Psichiatrico Osservanza'' of Imola, refused any form of coercion and any violation of the fundamental principles of freedom, questioning the basis of psychiatry itself.&lt;ref name="Antonucci 1986" /&gt;

== Psychiatry as pseudoscience and failed enterprise ==
Many of the above issues lead to the claim that psychiatry is a [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Warme |first=Gordon |title=Daggers of the Mind: Psychiatry and the Myth of Mental Disease |location=Canada |publisher=House of Anansi |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-88784-197-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to some philosophers of science, for a theory to qualify as science it needs to exhibit the following characteristics:
* ''parsimony'', as straightforward as the phenomena to be explained allow (see [[Occam's razor]]);
* ''empirically testable and falsifiable'' (see [[Falsifiability]]);
* ''changeable'', i.e. if necessary, changes may be made to the theory as new data are discovered;
* ''progressive'', encompasses previous successful descriptions and explains and adds more;
* ''provisional'', i.e. tentative; the theory does not attempt to assert that it is a final description or explanation.

Psychiatrist Colin A. Ross and Alvin Pam maintain that biopsychiatry does not qualify as a science on many counts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ross |first=Colin |title=''"Errors of logic in biological psychiatry" in Colin Ross and Alvin Pam ''Pseudoscience in Biological Psychiatry |location=NY |publisher=Wiley &amp; Sons |pages=85–128 |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2014 meta-analysis, psychiatric treatment is no less effective for psychiatric illnesses in terms of treatment effects than treatments by practitioners of other medical specialties for physical health conditions. The analysis found that the effect sizes for psychiatric interventions are, on average, on par with other fields of medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Bret S. Stetka|author2=Cristoph U.

== Diverse paths ==
Szasz has since (2008) re-emphasized his disdain for the term anti-psychiatry, arguing that its legacy has simply been a "catchall term used to delegitimize and dismiss critics of psychiatric fraud and force by labeling them 'antipsychiatrists'". He points out that the term originated in a meeting of four psychiatrists (Cooper, Laing, [[Joseph Berke|Berke]] and [[Leon Redler|Redler]]) who never defined it yet "counter-label[ed] their discipline as anti-psychiatry", and that he considers Laing most responsible for popularizing it despite also personally distancing himself. Szasz describes the deceased (1989) Laing in [[vitriolic]] terms, accusing him of being irresponsible and [[equivocal]] on psychiatric diagnosis and use of force, and detailing his past "public behavior" as "a fit subject for moral judgment" which he gives as "a bad person and a fraud as a professional".&lt;ref name="Szasz2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Szasz |first=Thomas |date=June 2008 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/5181704176g65265/ |title=Debunking Antipsychiatry: Laing, Law, and Largactil |journal=Current Psychology |volume=27 |issue=2  |pages=79–101 |doi=10.1007/s12144-008-9024-z |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daniel Burston, however, has argued that overall the published works of Szasz and Laing demonstrate far more points of convergence and intellectual kinship than Szasz admits, despite the divergence on a number of issues related to Szasz being a libertarian and Laing an existentialist; that Szasz employs a good deal of exaggeration and distortion in his criticism of Laing's personal character, and unfairly uses Laing's personal failings and family woes to discredit his work and ideas; and that Szasz's "clear-cut, crystalline ethical principles are designed to spare us the agonizing and often inconclusive reflections that many clinicians face frequently in the course of their work".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Daniel |last=Burston |year=2004 |url=http://www.ehinstitute.org/01-20-2004.html |title=Szasz, Laing and Existential Psychotherapy |publisher=Existential-Human Institute|accessdate=2014-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Szasz has indicated that his own views came from libertarian politics held since his [[teens]], rather than through experience in psychiatry; that in his "rare" contacts with involuntary mental patients in the past he either sought to discharge them (if they were not charged with a crime) or "assisted the prosecution in securing [their] conviction" (if they were charged with a crime and appeared to be [[prima facie]] guilty); that he is not opposed to consensual psychiatry and "does not interfere with the practice of the conventional psychiatrist", and that he provided "listening-and-talking ("psychotherapy")" for voluntary fee-paying clients from 1948 until 1996, a practice he characterizes as non-medical and not associated with his being a psychoanalytically trained psychiatrist.&lt;ref name="Szasz2008" /&gt;

The [[gay rights activism|gay rights]] or [[gay liberation]] movement is often thought to have been part of anti-psychiatry in its efforts to challenge oppression and stigma and, specifically, to get [[homosexuality]] removed from the American Psychiatric Association's (APA) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. However, a psychiatric member of APA's Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Issues Committee has recently sought to distance the two, arguing that they were separate in the early 70s protests at APA conventions and that APA's decision to remove homosexuality was scientific and happened to coincide with the political pressure. Reviewers have responded, however, that the founders and movements were closely aligned; that they shared core texts, proponents and slogans; and that others have stated that, for example, the gay liberation critique was "made possible by (and indeed often explicitly grounded in) traditions of antipsychiatry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=McCommon B |year=2006 |title=Antipsychiatry and the Gay Rights Movement |url=http://ps.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?volume=57&amp;page=1809 |journal=Psychiatr Serv |volume=57 |issue=12 |page=1809 |doi=10.1176/appi.ps.57.12.1809}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Rissmiller DJ, Rissmiller J |year=2006 |title=Letter in reply |url=http://ps.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleid=97461 |journal=Psychiatr Serv |volume=57 |issue=12 |pages=1809–1810 |doi=10.1176/appi.ps.57.12.1809-a }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the clinical setting, the two strands of anti-psychiatry—criticism of psychiatric knowledge and reform of its practices—were never entirely distinct. In addition, in a sense, anti-psychiatry was not so much a demand for the end of psychiatry, as it was an often self-directed demand for psychiatrists and allied professionals to question their own judgements, assumptions and practices. In some cases, the suspicion of non-psychiatric medical professionals towards the validity of psychiatry was described as anti-psychiatry, as well the criticism of "hard-headed" psychiatrists towards "soft-headed" psychiatrists. Most leading figures of anti-psychiatry were themselves psychiatrists, and equivocated over whether they were really "against psychiatry", or parts thereof. Outside the field of psychiatry, however—e.g. for activists and non-medical mental health professionals such as social workers and psychologists—'anti-psychiatry' tended to mean something more radical. The ambiguous term "anti-psychiatry" came to be associated with these more radical trends, but there was debate over whether it was a new phenomenon, whom it best described, and whether it constituted a genuinely singular movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Paul |last=Laffey |year=2003 |url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/hah/5.2/laffey.pdf |format=PDF |title=Antipsychiatry in Australia: Sources for a Social and Intellectual History |journal=Health &amp; History |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=17–36|doi=10.2307/40111451|jstor=40111451 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to avoid any ambiguity intrinsic to the term anti-psychiatry, a current of thought that can be defined as critique of the basis of psychiatry, radical and unambiguous, aims for the complete elimination of psychiatry. The main representative of the critique of the basis of psychiatry is an Italian physician, [[Giorgio Antonucci]].

In the 1990s, a tendency was noted among psychiatrists to characterize and to regard the anti-psychiatric movement as part of the past, and to view its ideological history as flirtation with the polemics of radical politics at the expense of scientific thought and enquiry. It was also argued, however, that the movement contributed towards generating demand for grassroots involvement in guidelines and advocacy groups, and to the shift from large mental institutions to community services. Additionally, community centers have tended in practice to distance themselves from the psychiatric/medical model and have continued to see themselves as representing a culture of resistance or opposition to psychiatry's authority. Overall, while antipsychiatry as a movement may have become an anachronism by this period and was no longer led by eminent psychiatrists, it has been argued that it became incorporated into the mainstream practice of mental health disciplines.&lt;ref name="Nasser1995" /&gt; On the other hand, mainstream psychiatry became more biomedical, increasing the gap between professionals.

Henry Nasrallah claims that while he believes anti-psychiatry consists of many historical exaggerations based on events and primitive conditions from a century ago, "antipsychiatry helps keep us honest and rigorous about what we do, motivating us to relentlessly seek better diagnostic models and treatment paradigms. Psychiatry is far more scientific today than it was a century ago, but misperceptions about psychiatry continue to be driven by abuses of the past. The best antidote for antipsychiatry allegations is a combination of personal integrity, scientific progress, and sound evidence-based clinical care".&lt;ref name="nasral" /&gt;

A criticism was made in the 1990s that three decades of anti-psychiatry had produced a large literature critical of psychiatry, but little discussion of the deteriorating situation of the mentally troubled in American society. Anti-psychiatry crusades have thus been charged with failing to put suffering individuals first, and therefore being similarly guilty of what they blame psychiatrists for. The rise of anti-psychiatry in Italy was described by one observer as simply "a transfer of psychiatric control from those with medical knowledge to those who possessed socio-political power".&lt;ref name="MicalePorter" /&gt;

Critics of this view, however, from an anti-psychiatry perspective, are quick to point to the industrial aspects of psychiatric treatment itself as a primary causal factor in this situation that is described as "deteriorating". The numbers of people labeled "mentally ill", and in treatment, together with the severity of their conditions, have been going up primarily due to the direct efforts of the mental health movement, and mental health professionals, including psychiatrists, and not their detractors. Envisioning "mental health treatment" as violence prevention has been a big part of the problem, especially as you are dealing with a population that is not significantly more violent than any other group and, in fact, are less so than many.

On October 7, 2016, the [[Ontario Institute for Studies in Education]] (OISE) at the University of Toronto announced that they had established a scholarship for students doing theses in the area of antipsychiatry. Called “The Bonnie Burstow Scholarship in Antipsychiatry,” it is to be awarded annually to an OISE thesis student. An unprecedented step, the scholarship should further the cause of freedom of thought and the exchange of ideas in academia. The scholarship is named in honor of Bonnie Burstow, a faculty member at the University of Toronto, a radical feminist, and an antipsychiatry activist. She is also the author of ''Psychiatry and the Business of Madness'' (2015).

Some components of antipsychiatric theory have in recent decades been reformulated into a critique of "corporate psychiatry", heavily influenced by the [[pharmaceutical industry]]. A recent editorial about this was published in the ''British Journal of Psychiatry'' by Moncrieff, arguing that modern psychiatry has become a handmaiden to conservative political commitments. [[David Healy (psychiatrist)|David Healy]] is a psychiatrist and professor in psychological medicine at [[Cardiff University School of Medicine]], [[Wales]]. He has a special interest in the influence of the pharmaceutical industry on medicine and [[academia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/547497_5 |title=Paradigms of Psychiatry: Eclecticism and Its Discontents |author=Seyyed Nassir Ghaemi |year=2006 |volume=19 |issue=6 |website=Current Opinion in Psychiatry}} {{registration required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the meantime, members of the psychiatric consumer/survivor movement continued to campaign for reform, empowerment and alternatives, with an increasingly diverse representation of views. Groups often have been opposed and undermined, especially when they proclaim to be, or when they are labelled as being, "anti-psychiatry".&lt;ref name="McLean2003part2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McLean |first=A. |year=2003 |url=http://www.psychosocial.com/IJPR_8/Recovering1-McLean.html |title=Recovering Consumers and a Broken Mental Health System in the United States: Ongoing Challenges for Consumers/ Survivors and the New Freedom Commission on Mental Health. Part II: Impact of Managed Care and Continuing Challenges |journal=International Journal of Psychosocial Rehabilitation |volume=8 |pages=58–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as of the 1990s, more than 60 percent of ex-patient groups reportedly support anti-psychiatry beliefs and consider themselves to be "psychiatric survivors".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.umaine.edu/JMB/archives/volume15/15_1-2_1994winterspring.html#abstract4 |author=Everett B |year=1994 |title=Something is happening: the contemporary consumer and psychiatric survivor movement in historical context |journal=Journal of Mind and Behavior |volume=15 |pages=55–7|citeseerx=10.1.1.413.3586 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although anti-psychiatry is often attributed to a few famous figures in psychiatry or academia, it has been pointed out that consumer/survivor/ex-patient individuals and groups preceded it, drove it and carried on through it.&lt;ref name="Rissmiller2006"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ps.psychiatryonline.org/data/Journals/PSS/3770/06ps863.pdf |format=PDF |title=Evolution of the Antipsychiatry Movement into mental health consumerism |last=Rissmiller |first=D.J. |last2=Rissmiller |first2=J.H. |date=June 2006 |volume=57 |issue=6 |journal=Psychiatric Services |pages=863–866 |pmid=16754765 |doi=10.1176/appi.ps.57.6.863}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
A schism exists among those critical of conventional psychiatry between radical abolitionists and more moderate reformists. Laing, Cooper and others associated with the initial anti-psychiatry movement stopped short of actually advocating for the abolition of coercive psychiatry. Thomas Szasz, from near the beginning of his career, crusaded for the abolition of forced psychiatry. Today, believing that coercive psychiatry marginalizes and oppresses people with its harmful, controlling, and abusive practices, many who identify as anti-psychiatry activists are proponents of the complete abolition of non-consensual and coercive psychiatry.

Criticism of antipsychiatry from within psychiatry itself object to the underlying principle that psychiatry is by definition harmful. Most psychiatrists accept that issues exist that need addressing, but that the abolition of psychiatry is harmful. Nimesh Desai concludes: "''To be a believer and a practitioner of multidisciplinary mental health, it is not necessary to reject the medical model as one of the basics of psychiatry.''" and admits "''Some of the challenges and dangers to psychiatry are not so much from the avowed antipsychiatrists, but from the misplaced and misguided individuals and groups in related fields.''"&lt;ref name="Desai 2005 185–187"/&gt;

'''Base curve radius''', or simply '''base curve''', abbreviated '''BCR''' or '''BC''', is the measure of an important parameter of a [[Corrective lens|lens]] in [[optometry]]. 

On a [[spectacle lens]], it is the flatter curvature of the front surface.  

On a [[contact lens]] it is the curvature of the back surface and is sometimes referred to as the '''back central optic radius''' (abbreviated '''BCOR'''). Typical values for a contact lens are from 8.0 to 10.0&amp;nbsp;mm.  The base curve is the radius of the sphere of the back of the lens that the prescription describes (the lower the number, the steeper the curve of the cornea and the lens, the higher the number, the flatter the curve of the cornea and the lens).  This number is important in order to allow the contact lens to  fit well to the wearer's [[cornea]] for comfort, to facilitate [[tears|tear]] exchange, and to allow oxygen transmission.

[[Cannabis (drug)|Cannabis]] is the most popular illegal drug in Suriname, with 2% of the adult population having ever used it.&lt;ref name="Newman2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Graeme R. Newman|title=Crime and Punishment around the World &amp;#91;4 volumes&amp;#93;: &amp;#91;Four Volumes&amp;#93;|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2uK6bR9byVIC&amp;pg=RA1-PA311|date=19 October 2010|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-35134-1|pages=1–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prohibition==
Cannabis was banned in Suriname (then a [[Surinam (Dutch colony)|Dutch colony]]) in the early years of the 20th century. The drug had been popularized by the arrival of Asian immigrants in the colony. In 1921 the [[Surinamese Immigrants' Association]] requested that the ban on ''ganja'' be lifted and an import and sales concession be granted to them.&lt;ref name="Hoefte1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rosemarijn Hoefte|title=In Place of Slavery: A Social History of British Indian and Javanese Laborers in Suriname|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EPzT5AYLvL0C&amp;pg=PA160|year=1998|publisher=University Press of Florida|isbn=978-0-8130-1625-2|pages=160–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultivation==
A 1982 report noted that cannabis was becoming more popular in Suriname, and was grown in abandoned plantations near the coastal plains, primarily for local consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cannabis Eradication in Foreign Western Hemisphere Nations, Effects in the U.S.: Environmental Impact Statement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a-83AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=SL5-PA12|year=1982|pages=5–}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1998 report noted anecdotal data that cannabis was cultivated in Suriname, but that the amounts were unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=International Narcotics Control Strategy Report|date=March 1998|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BSlJAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=cannabis+suriname&amp;dq=cannabis+suriname&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiJksXhsdfQAhUJ0oMKHbMBDe0Q6AEIRjAI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2005 Caribbean Week of Agriculture, the Surinamese Minister of Agriculture stated: ''We know that we have problems with fertile soil. We know that our food import bill is too high. So when we talk about marijuana, personally, for Suriname, I [do] not agree at this moment to [say] let our farmers start producing marijuana. What we are stimulating is produce food for our people.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Name * |url=http://dominicanewsonline.com/news/homepage/news/agriculture/suriname-wants-focus-food-security-marijuana/ |title=Suriname wants focus on food security, not marijuana – Dominica News Online |publisher=Dominicanewsonline.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2006">'''Capability Scotland''', formerly the '''Scottish Council for the Care of Spastics''' is a Scottish charity. Based in [[Edinburgh]], it provides education, employment and care for disabled people.

==History==
The Scottish Council for the Care of Spastics was founded in 1946 by a group of parents and health professionals. Its aim was to support children with [[cerebral palsy]]. The first school was opened at Westerlea, Edinburgh, in 1948. In the early 1960s the charity began organising employment opportunities for disabled people, and in 1973 the first adult residential home was established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Capability Scotland|url=http://www.capability-scotland.org.uk/media/322437/capability_scotland__facts_sheet_2014.pdf|publisher=Capability Scotland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996 the organisation changed its name to Capability Scotland.

==Partnerships==

{{Cleanup|date=July 2009}}

{{Healthcare in the United States}}
'''Case management''' is a [[managed care]] technique within the [[health insurance|health care coverage]] system of the [[United States]]. It involves an integrated system that manages the delivery of comprehensive healthcare services for enrolled patients.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Case Management of Long-term Conditions: Principles and Practice for Nurses|last=Snoddon|first=Janet|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.|year=2010|isbn=9781405180054|location=Malden, MA|pages=19-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Case managers are employed in almost every aspect of health care and these employ different approaches in the control of clinical actions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== In health care ==
The American Case Management Association (ACMA), a [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit association]] dedicated to the support and development of the profession of case management through educational forums, networking opportunities, legislative [[advocacy]] and establishing the industry's Standards of Practice,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[American Case Management Association]] |title=Standards of Practice for Case Management |url=http://www.acmaweb.org/SOP |date= |accessdate=2011-09-30 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; defines case management as:

:"a collaborative process of [[Nursing assessment|assessment]], planning, facilitation, care coordination, evaluation, and [[Patient advocacy|advocacy]] for options and services to meet an individual's and family's comprehensive health needs through communication and available resources to promote quality costeffective outcomes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=[[American Case Management Association]] | title=Definition of Case Management | url=http://www.acmaweb.org/| date= | accessdate=2011-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Case management is multifaceted as the following definition highlights:
&lt;br /&gt;
"Case management is a procedure to plan, seek, and monitor services for different [[Social services|social agencies]] and staff on behalf of a [[Patient|client]]. Usually one agency takes primary responsibility for the client and assigns a case manager, who coordinates services, advocates for the client, and sometimes controls resources and purchases services for the client. The procedure allows many [[Social work|social workers]] in the agency, or in different agencies to coordinate their efforts to serve a given client through professional teamwork, thus expanding the range of needed services offered."

The Certified Case Manager (CCM) [[credential]] is available to [[Health professional|health care providers]] licensed to practice independently in the [[Health care in the United States|American health care system]]. For example, the license would be available to [[Registered Nurses]] but not [[Licensed Practical Nurses]], who are not licensed to assess and evaluate the health of their clients.

Because holistic training is the basis for the Registered Nurse, Social Work, [[Occupational therapy]] and most all degree programs in the health sciences, the transition into case management is a natural progression of skill. To investigate if your specialty is among those able to earn this specialty certification, go to https://web.archive.org/web/20100325003803/http://www.ccmcertification.org/secondary.php?section=Certification&amp;content=ApplyForCertification, and read the requirements for application for this certification.

Case management focuses on delivering personalized services to patients to improve their care, and involves four steps:

:1) [[Referral (medicine)|Referral]] of new patients (perhaps from another service if the client has relocated to a new area out of previous jurisdiction, or if client no longer meets the target of previous service, such as requiring a greater level of care. Alternatively, they may be referred after having been placed on an ITO or in an inpatient unit.
:2) Planning &amp; delivery of care
:3) Evaluation of results for each patient &amp; adjustment of the care plan
:4) Evaluation of overall program [[effectiveness]] &amp; adjustment of the program&lt;ref name="Bluhm"&gt;William F. Bluhm, "Group Insurance: Fourth Edition," Actex Publications, Inc., 2003 {{ISBN|1-56698-448-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of a health insurer or health plan it is defined as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;A method of managing the provision of health care to members with high-cost medical conditions.  The goal is to coordinate the care so as to both improve continuity and quality of care and lower costs.&lt;ref name="Koongstvedt"&gt;Peter R. Koongstvedt, "The Managed Health Care Handbook," Fourth Edition, Aspen Publishers, Inc., 2001 {{ISBN|0-8342-1726-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Specific types of case management programs include catastrophic or large claim management programs, [[Midwifery|maternity]] case management programs, and [[transitional care]] management programs.&lt;ref name="Bluhm"/&gt; 

===Functions ===

====Health insurer and HMO setting====
Case managers working for health insurers and [[Health maintenance organization|HMOs]] typically do the following:

:1) Check benefits available;
:2) Negotiate rates with providers who are not part of the plan's network;
:3) Recommend coverage exceptions where appropriate;
:4) Coordinate referrals to specialists;
:5) Arrange for special services;
:6) Coordinate insured services with any available community services; and
:7) Coordinate claims with other benefit plans.&lt;ref name="Bluhm"/&gt;

By identifying patients with potentially [[Catastrophic illness|catastrophic illnesses]], contacting them and actively coordinating their care, plans can reduce expenses and improve the medical care they receive.  Examples include identifying [[High-risk pregnancy|high-risk pregnancies]] in order to ensure appropriate [[Prenatal care in the United States|pre-natal care]] and watching for [[dialysis]] claims to identify patients who are at risk of end-stage [[Chronic kidney disease|renal disease]]. The amount of involvement an insurer can have in managing high cost cases depends on the structure of the benefit plan.  In a tightly managed plan case management may be integral to the benefits program.  In less tightly managed plan, participation in a case management program is often voluntary for patients.&lt;ref name="Koongstvedt"/&gt;

====Health care provider setting====
Case managers working for health care providers typically do the following:
:1) Verify coverage &amp; benefits with the health insurers to ensure the provider is appropriately paid;
:2) Coordinate the services associated with discharge or return home;
:3) Provide [[patient education]];
:4) Provide post-care follow-up; and
:5) Coordinate services with other health care providers.&lt;ref name="Bluhm" /&gt;

====Employer setting====
Case managers working for employers typically do the following:
:1) Verify medical reasons for employee absences;
:2) Follow up after absences from work due to poor health;
:3) Provide [[health education]];
:4) Assist employees with chronic illnesses; and
:5) Provide on-site wellness programs.&lt;ref name="Bluhm"/&gt;
:6) Assist employees to seek specialized treatment when need arises.

== Case management models ==
There are several models of case management and the distinctions are based on internal and external influences that have bearing on the level of success and differences in outcomes. These, for instance, include local influences such as the response to cost by funders of care and consumer pressure.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The generic model used in the United States is the [[Chronic care management|chronic care model]], which holds that health care does not only involve change in the patient and that high-quality disease care counts the community, the health system, self-management support, delivery system design, decision support, and clinical information systems as important elements in the practice of case management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Case Manager's Handbook|last=Mullahy|first=Catherine|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers|year=2010|isbn=9780763777241|location=Sudbury, MA|pages=795}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the [[Group decision-making|group decision-making models]] such as the rational model, which focuses on economic perspectives and maximum utility; and, the [[garbage can model]], an approach based on difficult problem identification and solutions under uncertain circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Leadership and Nursing Care Management|last=Nagelkerk|first=Jean|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|year=2005|isbn=9781416031611|location=New York|pages=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other models also prioritize ethics such as the [[distributive justice]] model developed by Beauchamp and Childress of the [[Kennedy Institute of Ethics]], where ethics a component of the case manager's responsibilities and is concerned with the distribution of finite resources for the benefit of an entire community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Leader's Guide to Hospital Case Management|last=Daniels|first=Stefani|last2=Ramey|first2=Marianne|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning,|year=2004|isbn=9780763733544|location=Sudbury, MA|pages=277}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Nursing Case Management Certification==

The American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC) is the largest board certification body for nurses in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nursecredentialing.org/Certification.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; One of the many certifications that ANCC offers is a Case Management Nurse Certification.  Registered nurses who successfully pass ANCC's Case Management Nurse exam&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nursecredentialing.org/NurseSpecialties/CaseManagement.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; are entitled to use the credential, RN-BC (Registered Nurse - Board Certified).

== Health Care Delivery System Case Management ==
The [http://www.acmaweb.org American Case Management Association (ACMA)], a non-profit professional membership organization supporting the practice of hospital case management through education, networking, publications, benchmarking and research, defines Hospital/Health System Case Management as:

''"...A collaborative practice model including patients, nurses, social workers, physicians, other practitioners, caregivers and the community. The Case Management process encompasses communication and facilitates care along a continuum through effective resource coordination. The goals of Case Management include the achievement of optimal health, access to care and appropriate utilization of resources, balanced with the patient's right to self determination."''

Hospital Case Managers are professionals in the hospital setting who ensure that patients are admitted and transitioned to the appropriate level of care,  have an effective plan of care and are receiving prescribed treatment, and have an advocate for services and plans needed during and after their stay.    Case Managers concurrently plan for transitions of care, discharge and often post discharge follow up. Case Managers often coordinate/communicate with the patient and family, physician(s), funding sources (i.e. insurance, Medicare), and community resources that provide services the patient may need, such as rehabilitation facilities or providers of medical equipment.  Through this coordination, hospital case managers' goals are to ensure both optimal patient and hospital outcomes  including quality of care, efficient resource utilization and reimbursement for services.  Hospital Case Management is a collaborative practice, consisting primarily of Nurse and Social Work professionals working in collaboration with physicians and other members of the healthcare team.

'''Case Managers' Role'''

A Case Manager's responsibilities include the following functions:

*Advocacy &amp; Education – ensuring the patient has an advocate for needed services and any needed education.
*Clinical Care Coordination/Facilitation – coordinating multiple aspects of care to ensure the patient progresses.
*Continuity/Transition Management – transitioning of the patient to the appropriate level of care needed.
*Utilization/Financial Management – managing resource utilization and reimbursement for services.
*Performance &amp; Outcomes Management – monitoring, and if needed, intervening to achieve desired goals and outcomes for both the patient and the hospital.
*Psychosocial Management – assessing and addressing psychosocial needs including individual, familial, environmental, etc.
*Research &amp; Practice Development –  Identifying practice improvements and using evidence based data to influence needed practice changes.&lt;ref&gt;Confluence Writing Award--Aaron Sommers' ''Case Managing''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hospital Case Manager Education and Certification'''

To be a Case Manager requires experience in the hospital setting, typically as a nurse or a social worker.   Additional skills specific to case management are learned in the role.  Advanced certification is available to Hospital Case Managers through the [http://www.acmaweb.org/section.asp?sID=16 Accredited Case Manager (ACM) Certification], offered by ACMA. The ACM Certification is the only certification that is specifically designed to validate an individual's competency in hospital case management practice, and is offered to both Nurse and Social Work Case Managers.

The ACM Certification requires professionals to apply, demonstrate two years of hospital case management experience and licensure as a nurse or social worker, and to sit for and pass an examination.  The exam consists of two components. The first section contains core case management questions that test the knowledge of Case Managers working in a hospital/health system. The second component consists of clinical simulations, which test the application of case management knowledge to simulated practice scenarios.  Successful completion of the ACM Certification requires passing both parts of the exam, and earns the successful application the ACM credential.  This credential must be renewed every four years through demonstrating the required hours of continuing education.

'''American Case Management Association'''

ACMA is the association solely for Hospital Case Management professionals, and currently consists of more than 4,500 members, and is represented by 21 state chapters nationwide.   ACMA provides hospital-focused education and networking for Case Managers – including nurses, social workers, physicians, administrators and other health care professionals.

In [[dentistry]], the '''configuration factor''' was first introduced by Davidson CL,1986, and later quantitavly extended Feilzer et al. in 1987 and refers to the number of bonded surfaces to the number of un-bonded surfaces in a [[dental restoration]]. For example, for a class I preparation there would be 5 bonded surfaces and only 1 un-bonded surface; the net result would be a c-factor of 5. With an increasing C factor the developing curing contraction stresses of bonded restorations (resin composites) increases too (Feilzer et al. 1987). The developing curing contraction in a bonded restoration generate stress on the bonded interface that are in competition with the developing bond strength of the setting restorative to the cavity surfaces, which may result in (partial) debonding, marginal leakage and post-operative pain (Davidson et al. 1984).

Internal stress can be reduced in a restoration subject to potentially reduce high disruptive contraction forces by using:

*"soft-start" polymerization instead of high-intensity [[Dental curing light|light curing]]
*incremental layering to reduce the effects of polymerization shrinkage; and
*a stress-breaking liner, such as filled adhesive, flowable composite, or [[Glass ionomer cement#Hybrid Ionomer Cements or Resin-modified Glass Ionomers or Dual-Cured GIC|resin-modified glass ionomers]]
*the application of non or low shrinking restorative materials

People with DS have a lower risk of all major solid cancers including those of lung, breast, cervix, with the lowest relative rates occurring in those aged 50 years or older.&lt;ref name=Nix2018/&gt; This low risk is thought due to an increase in the expression of [[tumor suppressor gene]]s present on chromosome 21.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cancer genome and tumor microenvironment|year=2010|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4419-0711-0|page=203|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x3Lb9Mxl4qcC&amp;pg=PA203|edition=Online-Ausg.|editor=Andrei Thomas-Tikhonenko|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704142502/https://books.google.com/books?id=x3Lb9Mxl4qcC&amp;pg=PA203|archivedate=2015-07-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nix2018&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nixon DW | title = Down Syndrome, Obesity, Alzheimer's Disease, and Cancer: A Brief Review and Hypothesis | journal = Brain Sciences | volume = 8 | issue = 4 | pages = 53| date = March 2018 | pmid = 29587359 | pmc = 5924389 | doi = 10.3390/brainsci8040053 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; One exception is testicular [[Germ cell tumor|germ cell cancer]] which occurs at a higher rate in DS.&lt;ref name=Nix2018/&gt;

==Mechanism==
The extra genetic material present in DS results in overexpression of a portion of the 310 genes located on chromosome 21.&lt;ref name=Lana2011/&gt; This overexpression has been estimated at around 50%.&lt;ref name=Nel2010/&gt; Some research has suggested the Down syndrome critical region is located at bands 21q22.1–q22.3,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/943216-overview |title=Genetics of Down syndrome |accessdate=2011-05-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527214124/http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/943216-overview |archivedate=2011-05-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with this area including genes for amyloid, [[superoxide dismutase]], and likely the [[ETS2]] proto [[oncogene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Current diagnosis &amp; treatment psychiatry|year=2008|publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-142292-5|pages=Chapter 3|edition=2nd|editor=Michael H.

The dementia which occurs in Down syndrome is due to an excess of [[amyloid beta]] [[peptide]] produced in the brain and is similar to [[Alzheimer's disease]].&lt;ref name=Wek2013/&gt; This peptide is processed from [[amyloid precursor protein]], the gene for which is located on chromosome 21.&lt;ref name=Wek2013&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weksler|first=ME|author2=Szabo, P |author3=Relkin, NR |author4=Reidenberg, MM |author5=Weksler, BB |author6= Coppus, AM |title=Alzheimer's disease and Down's syndrome: treating two paths to dementia|journal=Autoimmunity Reviews|date=Apr 2013|volume=12|issue=6|pages=670–3|pmid=23201920|doi=10.1016/j.autrev.2012.10.013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Senile plaques]] and [[neurofibrillary tangle]]s are present in nearly all by 35&amp;nbsp;years of age, though dementia may not be present.&lt;ref name=Steph2010/&gt; Those with DS also lack a normal number of [[lymphocytes]] and produce less [[antibody|antibodies]] which contributes to their increased risk of infection.&lt;ref name=Hick2012/&gt;

===Epigenetics===
Down syndrome is associated with an increased risk of many chronic diseases that are typically associated with older age such as Alzheimer's disease. The accelerated aging suggest that trisomy 21 increases the biological age of tissues, but molecular evidence for this hypothesis is sparse. According to a biomarker of tissue age known as [[epigenetic clock]], trisomy 21 increases the age of blood and brain tissue (on average by 6.6 years).&lt;ref name="Horvath2015DownSyndrome"&gt;{{Cite journal| title = Accelerated epigenetic aging in Down syndrome.| journal = [[Aging Cell]]| volume = 14| issue = 3| year = 2015| pmid = 25678027| pmc = 4406678| vauthors = Horvath S, Garagnani P, Bacalini MG, Pirazzini C, Salvioli S, Gentilini D, Di Blasio AM, Giuliani C, Tung S, Vinters HV, Franceschi C| doi = 10.1111/acel.12325| pages = 491–5| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150516152126/http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acel.12325/epdf| archivedate = 2015-05-16| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==

===Before birth===
When screening tests predict a high risk of Down syndrome, a more invasive diagnostic test ([[amniocentesis]] or [[chorionic villus sampling]]) is needed to confirm the diagnosis.&lt;ref name=ACOG2007/&gt; If Down syndrome occurs in one in 500 pregnancies and the test used has a 5% false-positive rate, this means, of 26 women who test positive on screening, only one will have Down syndrome confirmed.&lt;ref name=Can2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Canick|first=J|title=Prenatal screening for trisomy 21: recent advances and guidelines|journal=Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine : CCLM / FESCC|date=Jun 2012|volume=50|issue=6|pages=1003–8|pmid=21790505|doi=10.1515/cclm.2011.671}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the screening test has a 2% false-positive rate, this means one of eleven who test positive on screening have a fetus with DS.&lt;ref name=Can2012/&gt; Amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling are more reliable tests, but they increase the risk of [[miscarriage]] between 0.5 and 1%.&lt;ref name=Tab2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tabor|first=A|author2=Alfirevic, Z|title=Update on procedure-related risks for prenatal diagnosis techniques.|journal=Fetal Diagnosis and Therapy|year=2010|volume=27|issue=1|pages=1–7|pmid=20051662|doi=10.1159/000271995}}&lt;/ref&gt; The risk of limb problems is increased in the offspring due to the procedure.&lt;ref name=Tab2010/&gt; The risk from the procedure is greater the earlier it is performed, thus amniocentesis is not recommended before 15 weeks gestational age and chorionic villus sampling before 10 weeks gestational age.&lt;ref name=Tab2010/&gt;

===Abortion rates===
About 92% of pregnancies in Europe with a diagnosis of Down syndrome are terminated.&lt;ref name=Mans1999/&gt; In the United States, termination rates are around 67%, but this rate varied from 61% to 93% among different populations.&lt;ref name=Nat2012/&gt; Rates are lower among women who are younger and have decreased over time.&lt;ref name=Nat2012/&gt; When nonpregnant people are asked if they would have a termination if their fetus tested positive, 23–33% said yes, when high-risk pregnant women were asked, 46–86% said yes, and when women who screened positive are asked, 89–97% say yes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Choi|first=H |author2=Van Riper, M |author3=Thoyre, S|title=Decision making following a prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome: an integrative review|journal=Journal of Midwifery &amp; Women's Health|date=Mar–Apr 2012|volume=57|issue=2|pages=156–64|pmid=22432488|doi=10.1111/j.1542-2011.2011.00109.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After birth===
The diagnosis can often be suspected based on the child's physical appearance at birth.&lt;ref name=Nelson2011/&gt; An analysis of the child's chromosomes is needed to confirm the diagnosis, and to determine if a [[Chromosomal translocation|translocation]] is present, as this may help determine the risk of the child's parents having further children with Down syndrome.&lt;ref name=Nelson2011/&gt; Parents generally wish to know the possible diagnosis once it is suspected and do not wish pity.&lt;ref name=Hick2012/&gt;

==Screening==
Guidelines recommend screening for Down syndrome to be offered to all pregnant women, regardless of age.&lt;ref name=ACOG2007/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CG62: Antenatal care |url=http://publications.nice.org.uk/antenatal-care-cg62 |publisher=London: National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence |accessdate=16 February 2013 |author=National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence |year=2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130126165543/http://publications.nice.org.uk/antenatal-care-cg62 |archivedate=26 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of tests are used, with varying levels of accuracy. They are typically used in combination to increase the detection rate.&lt;ref name=Hick2012/&gt; None can be definitive, thus if screening is positive, either [[amniocentesis]] or [[chorionic villus sampling]] is required to confirm the diagnosis.&lt;ref name=ACOG2007/&gt; Screening in both the first and second trimesters is better than just screening in the first trimester.&lt;ref name=ACOG2007/&gt; The different screening techniques in use are able to pick up 90 to 95% of cases with a false-positive rate of 2 to 5%.&lt;ref name=Can2012/&gt;

==Management==
Efforts such as [[early childhood intervention]], screening for common problems, medical treatment where indicated, a good family environment, and work-related training can improve the development of children with Down syndrome. Education and proper care can improve [[quality of life]].&lt;ref name=Roi2003/&gt; Raising a child with Down syndrome is more work for parents than raising an unaffected child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Sheets KB, Crissman BG, Feist CD |title=Practice guidelines for communicating a prenatal or postnatal diagnosis of Down syndrome: recommendations of the national society of genetic counselors |journal=J Genet Couns |volume=20 |issue=5 |pages=432–41 |date=October 2011  |pmid=21618060 |doi=10.1007/s10897-011-9375-8 |url=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical childhood [[vaccination]]s are recommended.&lt;ref name=Hick2012/&gt;

A number of health organizations have issued recommendations for [[screening (medicine)|screening]] those with Down syndrome for particular diseases.&lt;ref name=Bull2011/&gt; This is recommended to be done systematically.&lt;ref name=Hick2012/&gt;

At birth, all children should get an [[electrocardiogram]] and [[echocardiogram|ultrasound of the heart]].&lt;ref name=Hick2012/&gt; Surgical repair of heart problems may be required as early as three months of age.&lt;ref name=Hick2012/&gt; [[Heart valve]] problems may occur in young adults, and further ultrasound evaluation may be needed in adolescents and in early adulthood.&lt;ref name=Hick2012/&gt; Due to the elevated risk of testicular cancer, some recommend checking the person's testicles yearly.&lt;ref name=Malt2013/&gt;

===Cognitive development===
&lt;!-- Hearing and Speech --&gt;
[[Hearing aids]] or other amplification devices can be useful for language learning in those with hearing loss.&lt;ref name=Hick2012/&gt; [[Speech-Language Pathology|Speech therapy]] may be useful and is recommended to be started around 9 months of age.&lt;ref name=Hick2012/&gt; As those with Down syndrome typically have good hand-eye coordination, learning [[sign language]] may be possible.&lt;ref name=Reil2012/&gt; [[Augmentative and alternative communication]] methods, such as pointing, body language, objects, or pictures, are often used to help with communication.&lt;ref name=Price2007&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Ment Retard Dev Disabil Res Rev |year=2007 |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=26–35 |title= Language and communication development in Down syndrome |author1=Roberts, JE |author2=Price, J |author3=Malkin, C |doi=10.1002/mrdd.20136 |pmid=17326116}}&lt;/ref&gt; Behavioral issues and mental illness are typically managed with counseling or medications.&lt;ref name=Nelson2011/&gt;

&lt;!-- School  --&gt;
Education programs before reaching school age may be useful.&lt;ref name=Wei2010/&gt; School-age children with Down syndrome may benefit from [[inclusive education]] (whereby students of differing abilities are placed in classes with their peers of the same age), provided some adjustments are made to the curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inclusion: Educating Students with Down Syndrome with Their Non-Disabled Peers|url=http://www.kcdsg.org/files/content/Educating%20Students%20with%20Down%20Syndrome%20With%20Their%20Typical%20Peers.pdf|publisher=National Down Syndrome Society|accessdate=5 February 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141127111652/http://www.kcdsg.org/files/content/Educating%20Students%20with%20Down%20Syndrome%20With%20Their%20Typical%20Peers.pdf|archivedate=27 November 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence to support this, however, is not very strong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lindsay|first=G|title=Educational psychology and the effectiveness of inclusive education/mainstreaming|journal=The British Journal of Educational Psychology|date=Mar 2007|volume=77|issue=Pt 1|pages=1–24|pmid=17411485|doi=10.1348/000709906x156881}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] of 1975 requires public schools generally to allow attendance by students with Down syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=New|first=Rebecca S.|title=Early childhood education an international encyclopedia|year=2007|publisher=Praeger Publishers|location=Westport, Conn.|isbn=978-0-313-01448-2|page=305|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JulOlhMP3JAC&amp;pg=PA305|author2=Cochran, Moncrieff|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170123083030/https://books.google.com/books?id=JulOlhMP3JAC&amp;pg=PA305|archivedate=2017-01-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Early Intervention&amp;nbsp;Therapies  --&gt;
Individuals with Down syndrome may learn better visually. Drawing may help with language, speech, and reading skills. Children with Down syndrome still often have difficulty with sentence structure and grammar, as well as developing the ability to speak clearly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dseinternational.org/en-us/about-down-syndrome/development/|title=Development and learning for people with Down syndrome|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-18|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119055326/https://www.dseinternational.org/en-us/about-down-syndrome/development/|archivedate=2016-11-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several types of early intervention can help with cognitive development. Efforts to develop motor skills include physical therapy, speech and language therapy, and occupational therapy. Physical therapy focuses specifically on motor development and teaching children to interact with their environment. Speech and language therapy can help prepare for later language. Lastly, occupational therapy can help with skills needed for later independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ndss.org/resources/therapies-development/early-intervention/|title=Early Intervention – National Down Syndrome Society|website=www.ndss.org|access-date=2016-11-18|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119060027/http://www.ndss.org/resources/therapies-development/early-intervention/|archivedate=2016-11-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, many individuals with Down syndrome were institutionalized, few of the associated medical problems were treated, and most died in infancy or early adult life. With the rise of the [[eugenics movement]], 33 of the then 48 [[U.S. state]]s and several countries began programs of forced sterilization of individuals with Down syndrome and comparable degrees of disability. [[Action T4]] in [[Nazi Germany]] made public policy of a program of systematic [[Involuntary euthanasia|involuntary euthanization]].&lt;ref name="Wright2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Wright|title=Downs:The history of a disability: The history of a disability|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0FMKNv_ALRYC&amp;pg=PA200|accessdate=25 August 2012|date=25 August 2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-956793-5|pages=104–108|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528115732/http://books.google.com/books?id=0FMKNv_ALRYC&amp;pg=PA200|archivedate=28 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocacy groups for individuals with Down syndrome began to be formed after the [[World War II|Second World War]].&lt;ref name=Adv2011&gt;{{cite book|title=Downs: The history of a disability|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-161978-6|page=147|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lm0BrR0POj8C&amp;pg=PA147|author=David Wright|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170123083050/https://books.google.com/books?id=lm0BrR0POj8C&amp;pg=PA147|archivedate=2017-01-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were organizations advocating for the inclusion of people with Down syndrome into the general school system and for a greater understanding of the condition among the general population,&lt;ref name=Adv2011/&gt; as well as groups providing support for families with children living with Down syndrome.&lt;ref name=Adv2011/&gt; Before this individuals with Down syndrome were often placed in [[History of psychiatric institutions|mental hospitals or asylums]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3293">'''Eber Landau''' (November 8, 1878 &amp;ndash; October 30, 1959) was a [[Baltic German]]-[[Swiss people|Swiss]] [[anatomist]] and [[histologist]], born in [[Rēzekne]], [[Latvia]].

He studied medicine at the [[University of Dorpat]], graduating in 1902. Later, he continued his education with studies in [[anatomy]] and [[histology]] in the laboratory of histology at [[Munich]] (1903) and at [[St. Petersburg]] as an assistant of [[Peter Lesgaft]] (1837–1909). From 1906 to 1912 he worked in [[Dorpat]] as a [[prosector]]-assistant in the anatomical institute directed by [[August Rauber]] (1841-1917). In 1913, he moved to the [[University of Bern]] as an associate professor, shortly afterwards relocating to [[Paris]], where he conducted [[neurological]] research under the directorship of [[Joseph Jules Dejerine]] (1849-1917).

In 1918 he returned to [[Bern]], where he spent several years working in the institute of anatomy. In 1923 Landau founded the department of histology and [[embryology]] at [[Kaunas University]]. Here he served as departmental head until 1932, afterwards relocating to the [[University of Lausanne]], where he conducted investigations in the fields of brain anatomy, neurology and neurohistology.

:''This article is about elective educational placements, for elective medical procedures see [[Elective surgery]]''.

An '''elective'''&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Sometimes known by other names, such as a ''Subject to Endorsement Placement'' (StEP) at [[Manchester Medical School]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=manchester&gt;{{cite web|title=Course description|url=http://www.medicine.manchester.ac.uk/undergraduate/medicine/coursedetails/?code=01428&amp;pg=2|publisher=University of Manchester|accessdate=2012-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  is a placement undertaken as part of a [[medical degree]]. The content and setting of the placement are largely decided by the student undertaking it,&lt;ref name=hospdoc&gt;{{cite web|last=Broad|first=Mike|title=Going on medical elective: a guide for students|url=http://www.hospitaldr.co.uk/guidance/going-on-medical-elective-a-guide-for-students|publisher=Hospital Dr|accessdate=2012-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; with some students choosing to spend it in a different country.

Elective placements are not exclusive to medical degrees; many other degree programmes within the field of healthcare also incorporate electives (such as [[nursing]], [[dentistry]] and [[physiotherapy]]) and the format is often the same.

==Motivations==

An elective represents a unique opportunity for [[medical students]] to experience [[healthcare]] in a setting unfamiliar to that in which they are accustomed to studying,&lt;ref name="manchester"/&gt; or in a place or field of specific interest. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Medics Away elective page|url=http://www.medicsaway.co.uk/index.php/travel/electives/|publisher=Medics Away|accessdate=2012-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is classically in a low resource setting, but may also be to experience a specialist field, a place the student is considering working in the future, or for a variety of other reasons.

Placements abroad may provide experience of differing practices, but also allow students to encounter medical conditions they are less used to seeing at home.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For example, certain [[infectious diseases]] that are uncommon in the [[Western world]] but common elsewhere.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, students often retrospectively describe how their placements broadened their horizons with regards to the social issues affecting healthcare in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gordonweeks|first=Alex|title=India Elective, 2005|url=http://www.yoracle.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=303&amp;Itemid=11&amp;mosmsg=Thanks+for+your+vote!|publisher=Yoracle|accessdate=2012-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A placement in a particular specialist setting may allow students insight into a potential career path, or allow students to participate in the research or implementation of new treatments or practices. 

==Structure and organisation==
An elective is usually undertaken in the penultimate or final year of study of a medical degree, often after students have finished their final exams.&lt;ref name="hospdoc"/&gt; The university usually specifies the dates during which an elective can be undertaken by students.&lt;ref name=BMJ&gt;{{cite web|title=Funding your elective|url=http://student.bmj.com/student/view-article.html?id=sbmj.d5851|publisher=Student BMJ|accessdate=2012-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electives are usually entirely self-arranged, with the student organising travel, accommodation, the placement itself, and other aspects like travel insurance and indemnity insurance. Often the hospital will help organise accommodation, and indemnity cover may be automatic depending on the student's existing policy. Some students recruit the services of companies which specialise in organising medical electives.&lt;ref name="hospdoc"/&gt; Students often share their experiences on the internet,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Electives Network|url=http://www.electives.net|publisher=TEN|accessdate=2012-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and good placements become well-known. Popular destinations can fill up 12 months in advance or more&lt;ref name="BMJ"/&gt;

===Cost===

Most students need to cover travel and living costs, many needing to cover accommodation, and some are charged administration or tuition costs, which can be up to $1,000 or more &lt;ref&gt;http://sydney.edu.au/medicine/concord/electives/fees.php&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Many students fund their electives personally, but financial help is occasionally available in the forms of &lt;ref name="Work the World"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Work the World |title=How to get funds for your elective |url=http://www.worktheworld.co.uk/bursaries-and-grants|publisher=Work the World |accessdate=13 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; bursaries, prizes or scholarships, either from the student's university or from societies or private companies. In these cases, the sponsor may require that the student undertakes some form of project whilst on their elective to justify the expense.&lt;ref name="BMJ"/&gt;

==Requirements==
Requirements of students vary from medical school to medical school. Some (such as [[University of Aberdeen School of Medicine|Aberdeen]]) require students to submit a written project as part of their placement, whereas other institutions utilise few formal assessments.&lt;ref name="BMJ"/&gt;

Students are still subject to all the ethical and professional requirements they would be at their home institution, such as the [[General Medical Council|GMC]]'s requirement that students at British med schools "recognise and work within the limits of their competence".&lt;ref name=GMC&gt;{{cite web|title=Good Medical Practice: Duties of a doctor|url=http://www.gmc-uk.org/guidance/good_medical_practice/duties_of_a_doctor.asp|work=Good Medical Practice|publisher=General Medical Council|accessdate=2012-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is immoral and illegal for unregistered medical students to work as if doctors, despite the fact that their level of skill and expertise is often comparable to the professionals they will work with on the placement.&lt;ref name="hospdoc"/&gt;

A '''fitness professional''' is a [[professional]] in the field of [[physical fitness|fitness]] and [[exercise]], most often [[education|instruction]] ('''fitness instructor'''), including [[aerobics]] and [[yoga]] [[teacher|instructors]] and [[author]]s of fitness instruction books or [[textbook|manuals]]. 

== Overview ==
Fitness topics may also include [[nutrition]], [[weight-loss]], and [[self-help]]. Fitness careers are distinguished from [[exercise science]] careers such as [[athletic training]], however the various types of fitness [[certification]]s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orangecountyfitness.org/trainers/certifications/ Accredited Organizations Offering Fitness Certifications].'', OrangeCountyFitness.org, 2010''&lt;/ref&gt;  have more and more in common: the, "distinctions...have become blurred, with more similarities than differences given the common background that all fitness professionals must possess."&lt;ref name="handbook"&gt;Howley, Edward and Franks, B. Don (2007). ''Fitness Professional's Handbook'', p.ix. 5th Edition. {{ISBN|0-7360-6178-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fitness professionals screen participants for [[exercise program]]s, evaluate various [[fitness component]]s, [[Medical prescription|prescribe]] exercise to improve these components, and may also help people with specific or chronic conditions.&lt;ref name="handbook"/&gt; Fitness professionals help challenge an individual by increasing their performance, as compared to when a person would workout on their own. They also teach a person new workouts and how to improve their form, performance and help achieve goals.The key roles and duties of a fitness professional are to: motivate, assist clients and measure your heart rate and body fat levels. Trainers need to be patient, be well organized and have time management as well as interpersonal skills.“You are in a helping profession. Although you are not a social worker, psychologist or guidance counselor, neither are you simply a technician with advanced training in exercise science, biomechanics, program design and assessment methodology.”(Jim and Nettie Gavin)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/a119072712/aone|title=Gale - Enter Product Login|website=link.galegroup.com|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable fitness professionals or former fitness professionals include [[Richard Simmons]], [[Susan Powter]], [[John Sitaras]] and Gov. [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] (''[[Arnold Schwarzenegger's Total Body Workout]]'').

Certified fitness professionals must maintain up-to-date on all certifications in order to instruct at particular health clubs and gyms. Often, fitness professionals will have some education in kinesiology, anatomy, and biomechanics to aid in their fitness career.

In Canada, Canadian Fitness Education Services (CFES) provides national fitness leadership program modules to take candidates through the steps in Aquafit, Group Fitness and/or Weight Training Instructor and Personal Trainer national certification.

[[Personal training]], [[Athletic training]], and [[physical therapy]] are all technically distinct specialties with different processes and requirements for certification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Link|first=Alexandra|title=What's the Difference Between a Personal Trainer, Athletic Trainer and Physical Therapist?|url=http://www.acefitness.org/blog/2179/what-s-the-difference-between-a-personal-trainer|publisher=ACE Fitness|accessdate=19 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States the main certifying agency for personal trainers is ACSM (the [[American College of Sports Medicine]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Get Certified|url=http://certification.acsm.org/acsm-certified-personal-trainer|publisher=American College of Sports Medicine|accessdate=19 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the main certifying agency for athletic trainers is NATA (the [[National Athletic Trainers' Association]]).  Obtaining certification or licensure as a physical therapist requires that you attend and graduate from a masters or doctoral program in physical therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Physical Therapist (PT) Education Overview|url=http://www.apta.org/PTEducation/Overview/|publisher=American Physical Therapy Association|accessdate=19 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Coaches ==
A coach can help amateur and professional athletes to be successful in a particular sport by teaching them the required skills needed. However, they can coach more than one sport to multiple people.Their role involves identifying an athletes strengths and weaknesses as well as their opponent.&lt;ref name="bls.gov"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/entertainment-and-sports/coaches-and-scouts.htm|title=Coaches and Scouts :     Occupational Outlook Handbook: :     U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|website=www.bls.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coaches also improve the physical condition of an athlete to help increase their full performance; improve form, techniques, skills and stamina. A coach must be ready to work long and irregular hours and these can include evenings, weekends and holidays. Typically, coaches are required to be 18 years old or older and have a Bachelor’s degree.&lt;ref name="bls.gov"/&gt;

== Salary and benefits ==
The median annual pay for a personal trainer in the US {{as of|2017|lc=y}} is $58,875.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.afpafitness.com/blog/personal-training-statistics-2017|title=A Career in Fitness: Personal Training Statistics &amp; Facts|author=Amy Occhipinti|access-date=2018-08-28|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highest paid college coach in 2017 was [[Nick Saban]] (University of Alabama) who earned $11.1 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thebestschools.org/magazine/highest-paid-college-coaches/|title=The 25 Highest-Paid College Coaches of 2018 {{!}} The Best Schools|work=The Best Schools|access-date=2018-05-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fitness professionals receive benefits that can include healthcare, paid time off, a pension. There is also the opportunity to accelerate personal achievements and the option to work full-time or part-time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/entertainment-and-sports/coaches-and-scouts.htm#tab-5|title=Coaches and Scouts :     Occupational Outlook Handbook: :     U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|website=www.bls.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, "employment of fitness trainers and instructors is projected to grow 8 percent from 2014 to 2024, about as fast as the average for all occupations.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.afpafitness.com/blog/personal-training-statistics-2017|title=A Career in Fitness: Personal Training Statistics &amp; Facts|last=M.S.|first=Amy Occhipinti,|access-date=2018-05-11|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Qualifications and experience required ==
Fitness professionals need to at least have a high school degree and in some fields, a bachelor’s degree in a related field. Additionally, they must learn CPR (cardiovascular resuscitation) which can be learnt American Red Cross offers classes that allow people to get a CPR class, First aid, and AED (Automated External Defibrillator) Certification.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3943">Officially the [[AIDS]]-[[HIV]] pandemic came to Iraq via contaminated blood in 1986, with [[haemophilia]]cs being the primary victims.  Over the decades, educational and treatment initiatives have been slowed by prevailing cultural values as well as severe economic hardships brought about by sanctions and war.

== 1986&amp;ndash;2003 ==
According to the Iraqi government, and a subsequent lawsuit, the pandemic came to Iraq via contaminated blood in 1986, with [[haemophilia]]cs being the initial victims.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poz.com/articles/1_10301.shtml POZ - News : Iraq’s First HIV Lawsuit&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Baath Party|Ba'athists]] relocated Iraqis found to be infected with [[AIDS]]-[[HIV]] to a segregated medical facility.   No one was allowed to visit these facilities, patients were basically prisoners and were given secret burials.  Ignorance about the disease was commonplace, even among the government itself.

The former Iraqi President, [[Saddam Hussein]], wrongly believed that the disease could be spread through casual contact and felt that infected Iraqis should be exterminated or imprisoned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aegis.com/news/afp/2003/AF030516.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  When the regime fell, these segregated hospitals were looted and the surviving patients were left to wander the streets.

== Post-Ba'athist ==
As early as 2004 the [[United Nations]] [[IRIN]] news service reported on the challenges involved in AIDS-HIV treatment and education in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/print.asp?ReportID=43620]&lt;/ref&gt; Almost no education existed regarding [[AIDS]]-[[HIV]] during the Ba'athist regime and thus a high degree of ignorance and fear surrounds the pandemic and its victims.

The Iraqi government offers free medical services and financial assistance to all Iraqi citizens living with [[AIDS]]-[[HIV]].  This includes regular checkups for the infected person, along with checkups for their partners and family members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=82357]&lt;/ref&gt;  Public service announcements and some education in the schools have begun at a slow pace.

Government health officials have some reason to be concerned, as some Muslim fundamentalist and sectarian militias have been known to harass and even kill infected Iraqis on the grounds that being infected with [[AIDS]]-[[HIV]] is evidence of sin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westernresistance.com/blog/archives/002796.html Western Resistance: Iraq: Couple Murdered for Being HIV Positive; Islam Absolved&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Baghdad several clinics specialize in [[AIDS]]-[[HIV]], while outside of the capital, there are similar clinics in each region, although there are still shortages in medical care.&lt;ref&gt;[http://electroniciraq.net/news/2685.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 representatives from the [[Ministry of Health (Iraq)|Iraqi Health Ministry]] traveled to Jordan to speak with public health officials about Jordanian efforts to stop the spread of the pandemic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fhi.org/en/HIVAIDS/country/Jordan/res_iraqistudytour.htm FHI - Iraqi Study Tour&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 the government in northern Iraq, Kurdistan, began to deport foreigners found to be HIV-positive because the government does not have the resources of facilities to offer treatment to its own citizens, let alone foreigners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://electroniciraq.net/news/2734.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ignorance about the pandemic remains widespread and it is taboo to discuss the ways in which the virus can be spread or to encourage the usage of condoms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2005/11/24/MNGUSFTMJA1.DTL Taboo on topic of AIDS handicaps health care / Low caseload makes getting affordable medications difficult&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''half-life of knowledge''' or '''half-life of facts''' is the amount of time that has to elapse before half of the [[knowledge]] or facts in a particular area is superseded or shown to be untrue. These coined terms belong to the field of quantitative analysis of science known as [[scientometrics]].

These ideas of half-life applied to different fields differ from the concept of [[half-life]] in [[physics]] in that there is no guarantee that the knowledge or facts in areas of study are declining exponentially. It is unclear that there is any way to establish what constitutes "knowledge" in a particular area, as opposed to mere opinion or theory. 

Because scientific knowledge is growing by a factor of ten every 50 years, this means that half of what scientists may have known about a particular subject will be wrong or obsolete in 45 years.&lt;ref name=reason.com/&gt;

An engineering degree went from having a half life of 35 years in ca. 1930 to about 10 years in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;

http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/computing/it/an-engineering-career-only-a-young-persons-game &lt;/ref&gt;

[[Donald Olding Hebb|Donald Hebb]] estimated the half-life of [[psychology]] to be five years.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}
==Coining==
The concept of "half-life of knowledge" is attributed to [[Fritz Machlup]] (1962).&lt;ref&gt;

http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/computing/it/an-engineering-career-only-a-young-persons-game &lt;/ref&gt;

The similar concept of a "half-life of facts" was coined by Samuel Arbesman, a Harvard mathematician&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2012/11/qa-samuel-arbesman|title=The half-life of facts|date=28 November 2012|author=R.D.A.|accessdate=19 February 2015|quote=Samuel Arbesman, a mathematician at Harvard, calls this "The Half-life of Facts", the title of his new book. In it he explains that this churn of knowledge is like radioactive decay: you cannot predict which individual fact is going to succumb to it, but you can know how long it takes for half the facts in a discipline to become obsolete. Such quantitative analysis of science has become known as scientometrics.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and scholar at the Kaufmann Foundation.&lt;ref name=reason.com&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bailey|first1=Ronald|title=Half of the Facts You Know Are Probably Wrong|url=http://reason.com/archives/2012/10/02/half-of-the-facts-you-know-are-probably|website=reason.com|accessdate=19 February 2015|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6WSrvNpK3|archivedate=19 February 2015|date=2 October 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet, adult health deteriorated during the 1990s and the first decade of the 21st century and mortality rates increased significantly.&lt;ref&gt;Mungunsarnai, G. and Spoorenberg, T. 2012.

==Healthcare==
The Ministry of Health is responsible for the provision of Public healthcare under the Citizen’s Health Insurance Law. Citizens are legally required to register and have annual check-ups. Finance is through the [[Mongolian Health Insurance Fund|Health Insurance Fund]] established in 1994. Patients are required to make [[copayment]]s of 10% for secondary care and 15% for tertiary care. in 2009  out-of-pocket payments made up 49% of total health expenditure.

===Traditional medicine===
Mongolian traditional medicine was repressed in the twentieth century but is now recognized.  The [[Institute of Traditional Medicine]] was established in 1961, and the [[Institute of Natural Compounds]] in 1973. The [[National Specialized Hospital]] caters for traditional medicine patients and has 100 beds. It sees 40-50 outpatients daily.  In 2006 about 5% of all hospital in-patients were treated by traditional medicine. In 2012 there were 82 private traditional medicine clinics, 63 of them in Ulaanbaatar. Since 1990 the [[Health Sciences University of Mongolia]] has had a Traditional Medicine Faculty.  In 2007 there were 1,538 doctors trained in traditional medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Health Service Delivery Profile |url=http://www.wpro.who.int/health_services/service_delivery_profile_mongolia.pdf |accessdate=22 November 2018 |publisher=WHO |date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Facilities===
A hierarchy of clinics and hospitals was established in the 1980s. A somon medical station, with a doctor, then an inter-somon hospital, covering a wider area and above that an aymag general hospital covering an area of about a 200-kilometre radius.  There were 4,600 physicians in the country in 1985, 24.8 per 10,000 people.  About half of them were in [[Ulaanbaatar]] where there was an oncology centre and a 600-bed isolation hospital for infectious diseases. There were about 8,500 nurses and 3,800 physician's assistants. In 1986 there were 112 hospitals. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Health care system in Mongolia |url=https://www.ap-companies.com/services/ekspatam/mongolia/ |website=AP Companies |accessdate=22 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Health Insurance Fund will not pay for people who go directly to hospitals without a referral.

The health sector comprises 17 specialized hospitals and centers, 4 regional diagnostic and treatment centers, 9 district and 21 ''aimag'' general hospitals, 323 ''soum'' hospitals, 18 ''feldsher'' posts, 233 family group practices, 536 private hospitals, and 57 drug supply companies/pharmacies. In 2002, the total number of health workers was 33,273, of whom 6823 were doctors, 788 pharmacists, 7802 nurses, and 14,091 mid-level personnel. At present, there are 27.7 physicians and 75.7 hospital beds per 10,000 inhabitants.

===Hospitals===
There has been a reduction in the number of public hospitals since 1998. The number of private hospitals (mostly very small) and clinics  has increased from 683 in 2005 to 1184 in 2011.

===Pharmacies===
132 items are included on the Essential Drugs List. If they are prescribed in the public health system pharmacies are reimbursed for 50-80% of the price, which is controlled. Medication is not always available in rural areas.  There are 5 traditional medicine manufacturing units and they produce more than 200 types of traditional medicine.  The total value in 2009 was US$1.4 million.  30 traditional products have been registered and some are included on the Essential Drugs List. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Health Service Delivery Profile |url=http://www.wpro.who.int/health_services/service_delivery_profile_mongolia.pdf |accessdate=22 November 2018 |publisher=WHO |date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14121">'''John E. "Jack" Wennberg''' (born June 2, 1934) is the pioneer and leading researcher of [[unwarranted variation]] in the healthcare industry. In four decades of work, Wennberg has documented the geographic variation in the healthcare that patients receive in the [[United States]]. In 1988, he founded the Center for the Evaluative Clinical Sciences at [[Dartmouth Medical School]] (now [[The Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice]] at Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth) to address that unwarranted variation in healthcare.

He is the Peggy Y. Thomson Professor Emeritus in the Evaluative Clinical Sciences &amp; Founder and Director Emeritus of The Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy &amp; Clinical Practice (formerly the Center for the Evaluative Clinical Sciences), and has been Professor in the Department of Community and Family Medicine since 1980 and in the Department of Medicine since 1989. Wennberg is the founding editor of the [http://www.dartmouthatlas.org/ Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care], a series of reports on how health care is used and distributed in the United States.

In June 2007, Wennberg stepped down as director of the CECS, now known as [[The Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice]] (TDI).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.healthaffairs.org/press/novdec0703b.htm Health Affairs Press Release: Nov. 1,, 2007&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Wennberg is a graduate of [[Stanford University]] and the [[McGill University Faculty of Medicine]]. His postgraduate training was in [[internal medicine]] and [[nephrology]] at [[Johns Hopkins University]], but he became interested in the application of [[epidemiology|epidemiological]] principles to the health care system while pursuing his master's degree in Public Health at Johns Hopkins.

Wennberg is a member of the [[Institute of Medicine]] of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] and of the Johns Hopkins University Society of Scholars.

==Work==
He cofounded the [http://www.informedmedicaldecisions.org/ Informed Medical Decisions Foundation] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], a nonprofit organization to provide objective scientific information to patients about their treatment choices by using interactive media.

Wennberg is the Founding Editor of ''The Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care'', which examines the patterns of medical resource intensity and use in the United States. The Atlas project also has reported on patterns of end-of-life care, inequities in the Medicare reimbursement system, and the underuse of preventive care.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.capconcorp.com/oba05/bios/wennberg.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

"When Jack started his work, geographic variation in health care—and the resulting variation in health care costs—was largely unknown and unremarked upon," said ''Health Affairs'' founding editor John Iglehart, who presented an award from the journal to Wennberg. "But thanks to Jack’s persistence, the idea that the care you receive is largely determined by where you live—and not necessarily by what is most appropriate for you—has become part of the common parlance of health policy."

Indeed, Wennberg’s work has shown that areas that spend more and provide more services often experience worse outcomes than lower-spending areas that provide less intensive care. In a 2002 ''Health Affairs'' article, Wennberg proposed a Medicare reform plan based on reducing unwarranted regional variations in spending by the program.

In the latest Dartmouth Atlas, Wennberg and colleagues state that "the Medicare system could reduce spending by at least 30 percent while improving the medical care of the most severely ill Americans."

Wennberg's recent work has focused on documenting outcomes and communicating outcomes information to patients. That focus is reflected in his article in the November/December 2007 issue of Health Affairs. In the first part of a two-part article, Wennberg and his coauthors urge the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to use its pay-for-performance program to ensure that patients are both informed and empowered to choose appropriate discretionary treatments.

===Variation===
In 1967, Wennberg worked with the Regional Medical Program created with a $350,000 grant from President [[Lyndon Johnson]] and began analyzing Medicare data to determine how well hospitals and doctors were performing. "Our results were fascinating, because they ran completely counter to what conventional wisdom said they would be.  Everyone expected that we would clearly see underservice in the rural hospital service areas remote from academic medical centers.  But when we looked at the data, we found tremendous variation in every aspect of healthcare delivery, even among communities served by academic medical centers. We found the same thing when we compare healthcare in the Boston and New Haven communities served by some of the finest academic medical centers in the world. The basic premise—that medicine was driven by science and by physicians capable of making clinical decisions based on well-established fact and theory—was simply incompatible with the data we saw.  It was immediately apparent that suppliers were more important in driving demand than had been previously realized," stated Wennberg.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.managedhealthcareexecutive.com/mhe/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=46508 Clamping down on variation - Managed Healthcare Executive&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

"The solution for unwarranted variation in preference-sensitive services is shared decision-making—the active involvement of the patient in choosing. Numerous clinical trials have shown that the patient decision-support programs, such as those available from Health Dialog and the Informed Medical Decisions Foundation, result in better decision and often a reduction in utilization. But implementation isn't easy," he says. "We need to find a way to encourage and compensate physicians for the time they spend on educating and discussing things with patients."

===Health Dialog===
Albert Mulley, a physician at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]], had been conducting research with Wennberg of Dartmouth by the [http://www.informedmedicaldecisions.org Informed Medical Decisions Foundation]. Together, they had built "substantial evidence that there's a huge variation in how doctors interpret their science through their own values and preferences." George Bennett, a serial entrepreneur "couldn't resist getting involved" in helping the process of enabling patients become a part of the decision-making process. As stated by Bennett, "It was one of life's strange twists, where they had something that was morally right, medically right, politically right and it saved money."

By teaming with [[Kevin Kimberlin]] of [http://www.spencertrask.com Spencer Trask &amp; Co.], Health Dialog received its initial funding.&lt;ref&gt;''Mr. George Bennett on the founding of Health Dialog'', By Hal Lancaster, '''The Wall Street Journal''', 03 August 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lowering Medicare costs===
"Americans have assumed that the fact that we spend so much more on health care than any other country stands as proof that we have the best health-care system in the world. But over the past 20 years, work done by Dartmouth's Wennberg and [[Elliott S. Fisher|Elliott Fisher]] has forced U.S. health care leaders to acknowledge that this simply isn’t true."&lt;ref&gt;[http://dartmed.dartmouth.edu/spring07/html/atlas.php Dartmouth Medicine Magazine: The State of the Nation's Health&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The potential savings under such an ideal arrangement are immense. If every Medicare provider in the country spent at the same rate as the lowest 10% of providers in the program, overall costs would be slashed by 30%. That alone is enough to pay for the elusive Medicare drug benefit. Additional savings might well accrue by implementing shared decision-making and reducing underuse of preventive services and medical errors.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

'''Julia Clifford Lathrop''' (June 29, 1858 – April 15, 1932) was an [[Americans|American]] [[social reformer]] in the area of education, social policy, and children's welfare. As director of the [[United States Children's Bureau]] from 1912 to 1922, she was the first woman ever to head a United States federal bureau.&lt;ref name=Ladd-Taylor&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Ladd-Taylor | first1 = Molly | title = Mother-Work: Women, Child Welfare, and the State, 1890-1930 | publisher = University of Illinois Press | year = 1995 | location = Urbana and Chicago | isbn = 978-0-252-06482-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Julia Clifford Lathrop was born in [[Rockford, Illinois]].  Julia's father, a lawyer and personal friend of Abraham Lincoln, helped establish the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and served in the state legislature (1856–57) and Congress (1877–79).  Her mother was a suffragist active in women's rights activities in Rockford and a graduate of the first class of [[Rockford University|Rockford Female Seminary]].

Lathrop attended [[Rockford Female Seminary]] where she met [[Jane Addams]] and [[Ellen Gates Starr]]. After one year, she transferred to [[Vassar College]], developing her own multidisciplinary studies in statistics, institutional history, sociology, and community organization and graduated in 1880.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://vcencyclopedia.vassar.edu/alumni/julia-lathrop.html | title = Julia Lathrop | accessdate = April 10, 2011 | website = Vassar Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, she worked in her father's law office first as a secretary and then studying the law for herself.

===Work in Chicago===
In 1890, Lathrop moved to [[Chicago]] where she joined [[Jane Addams]], [[Ellen Gates Starr]], [[Alzina Stevens]], [[Edith Abbott]], [[Grace Abbott]], [[Florence Kelley]], [[Mary McDowell]], [[Alice Hamilton]], [[Sophonisba Breckinridge]] and other social reformers at [[Hull House]].&lt;ref name="Altenbaugh1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard J. Altenbaugh|title=Historical Dictionary of American Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U_HSk9YheBYC&amp;pg=PA209|year=1999|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-28590-5|pages=209–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lathrop ran a discussion group called the Plato Club in the early days of the House. The women at Hull House actively campaigned to persuade Congress to pass legislation to protect children. During the depression years of the early '90s Lathrop served as a volunteer investigator of relief applicants, visiting homes to document the needs of the families.

In 1893, Lathrop was appointed as the first ever woman member of the [[Illinois State Board of Charities]], beginning her lifelong work in civil service reform: advocating for the training of professional social workers and standardizing employment procedures. This would lead to opening the labor market for educated women as well as improving social services in Progressive Era cities and towns. Over the next few years she helped introduce reforms such as the appointment of female doctors in state hospitals and the removal of the insane from the state workhouses.

===Director of United States Children's Bureau===
[[Image:Portrait of Julia Lathrop.jpg|right|thumb|200px|"Miss Julia C. Lathrop," ''The World's Work'', 1912.]]
Reacting to pressure from Progressive women reformers for the appointment of a woman for the newly created [[United States Children's Bureau|Children's Bureau]], in 1912, President [[William Taft]] appointed Lathrop as the first bureau chief.&lt;ref name=WDL1&gt;{{cite web|title=Two 7-Year Old Newsies, Profane and Smart, Selling Sunday, Nashville, Tennessee|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/2730|publisher=[[World Digital Library]]|accessdate=February 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the next nine years Lathrop directed research into child labor, infant mortality, maternal mortality, juvenile delinquency, mothers' pensions and illegitimacy.&lt;ref name = Lindenmeyer&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Lindenmeyer | first1 = Kriste | title = A right to childhood: the U.S. Children's Bureau and child welfare, 1912-46890-1930 | publisher = University of Illinois Press | year = 1997 | location = Urbana and Chicago | isbn = 978-0-252-02275-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Children's Bureau under Lathrop (1912–21) (known as "America's First Official Mother") and her successors became an administrative unit that not only created child welfare policy but also led its implementation. For many conservative women, the Bureau's focus on maternal and child welfare gave them a role in politics for the first time—something that the [[suffrage]] or [[women's rights]] movements had not offered them. The Bureau expanded its budget and personnel to focus on a scientific approach to motherhood in order to reduce infant and maternal mortality, improve child health and advocate for trained care for children with disabilities. Lathrop modeled the Children's Bureau investigations from the work she did while at Hull-House. The Bureau also lobbied to abolish child labor. Scientific language became critical to the reform efforts such as the baby-saving campaigns in towns with large working class and immigrant populations where the middle class [[Maternalist reform|maternalists]] battled contemporary beliefs in the inevitability of high infant mortality rates. "Mother-work in the community"&lt;ref name = Ladd-Taylor/&gt;{{rp|34}} meant that women educated in the latest scientific theories about children's health and safety would lead the movement for child welfare reform.

In her first annual report for the agency, Lathrop described the plans for expansion: promotion of birth registration, infant mortality field studies, production of instructional pamphlets and reports, expand the study of child labor laws, explore issues regarding mothers' pensions, and study the status of "dependent, defective, and delinquent children."&lt;ref name = Lindenmeyer/&gt;{{rp|52}} Lathrop wrote in 1914: "Work for infant welfare is coming to be regarded as more than a philanthropy or an expression of good will.  It is a profoundly important public concern which tests the public spirit and the democracy of a community."&lt;ref name = Ladd-Taylor/&gt;{{rp|74}}

Unlike the [[Parent-Teacher Association|National Congress of Mothers]], Lathrop's leadership of the Children's Bureau relied on her belief in the New Woman's right to freedom for individual development and opportunities, including a college degree of equal merit to men's and a decent job. However, Lathrop was careful to insist that motherhood was "the most important calling in the world"&lt;ref name = Ladd-Taylor/&gt;{{rp|81}} and to deny that women should have career ambitions. This way Lathrop could avoid controversy even while she built public support for the new agency.

[[Image:Miss Julia Lathrop LCCN2016825127 (2) (cropped).jpg|thumb|260px|Julia Lathrop, Commissioner of the United States Children's Bureau]]
In 1917, the [[American Association for Labor Legislation]] proposed a national health insurance act that included a provision for weekly cash allocations for pregnant women. Lathrop went against the private insurance industry and the [[American Medical Association]] to support this proposal, believing that the maternity benefit systems already in place in Germany, England and France left too many women and their babies uninsured. Lathrop argued in an address before the [[American Public Health Association]]'s 1918 meeting in Chicago that U.S. leaders needed to address the reasons for poverty in order to address children's health needs—that high infant mortality among the poor and working class in American cities was not just due to ignorance or laziness. Lathrop asked: "Which is the more safe and sane conclusion! That 88 per cent of all these fathers were incorrigibly indolent or below normal mentally, or that sound public economy demands an irreducible minimum living standard to be sustained by a minimum wage and other such expedients as may be developed in a determined effort to give every child a fair chance?"&lt;ref name = Lindenmeyer/&gt;{{rp|63}}

The attitude of most of the staff in the Children's Bureau and other government agencies however, was that women—especially with children—should not work outside of the home even if impoverished. Any connections between children's health and such issues as expansion of workers' insurance, minimum wage or sanitation systems lost credence.  The popular strategy remained focused on "Americanizing" immigrant workers and teaching white mothers how to take care of babies.  It is important to note that the Bureau chose not to address the horrifyingly high mortality rates among babies in families of color.  In the South, much of the public health campaigns were undertaken by African-American, Hispanic or black clubwomen working in their own segregated communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Cash | first1 = Floris Loretta Barnett | title = African American women and social action: the clubwomen and volunteerism from Jim Crow to the New Deal, 1896-1936 | publisher = Greenwood Press | year = 1997 | location = Westport, Conn. | isbn = 978-0-313-31563-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Neverdon-Morton | first1 = Cynthia | title = Afro-American Women of the South and the Advancement of the Race, 1895-1925 | publisher = Univ. of Tennessee Press | year = 1991 | location = Knoxville | isbn = 978-0-87049-684-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Salem | first1 = Dorothy C. | title = To better our world: Black women in organized reform, 1890-1920 | volume = 14 | work = Black women in United States History | publisher = Carlson Pub. | year = 1990 | location = Brooklyn, N.Y. | isbn = 978-0-926019-20-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1921 the [[Sheppard–Towner Act|Sheppard-Towner Maternity and Infancy Act]] became the first federally funded social welfare measure in the United States.&lt;ref name="Altenbaugh1999"/&gt; The law provided federal matching grants to the states for prenatal and child health clinics, visiting nurses for expectant and new mothers, distribution of information on nutrition and hygiene as well as midwife training. Contrary to Lathrop's original ideas, the final version of the law did not provide any financial aid or medical care.

The first 30 years of the twentieth century marked a transition between traditional social medicine that included the use of relatives or local midwives and the rise of a modern medical management of childbirth and childrearing by experts outside the family and home.&lt;ref name = Ladd-Taylor/&gt;{{rp|33}}  However, as the federal bureaucracy blossomed in the years after [[World War II]], the only agency focused solely on children lost its power and influence.

===Juvenile Justice===
As early as 1898, at the third Annual Illinois Conference on Charities, organized by the philanthropist [[Lucy Flower]] and Julia Lathrop, reformers called for a separate system of courts for children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Tanenhaus | first = David Spinoza | title = Juvenile Justice in the Making | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = New York | date = 2004 | isbn = 978-0-19-516045-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lathrop's experience at the Hull House and as a Charities Board member had given her firsthand knowledge of the conditions for children in county poorhouses and jails.  Prior to the reform era, children over the age of seven were imprisoned with adults. Lathrop helped found the country's first juvenile court in 1899, and the Chicago Woman's Club established the Juvenile Court Committee (electing Lathrop as its first president in 1903) to pay the salaries of fifteen probation officers and run a detention home located at 625 West Adams Street.

By 1904, Julia Lathrop helped organize and then became the president of the Juvenile Psychopathic Institute. The director was psychologist William A. Healy who led scientific studies of the physical and mental health of the children, shifting away from the belief that environment alone was responsible for a child's delinquent behavior.  Together with members of the National Congress of Mothers Lathrop worked to organize a juvenile court movement nationally with justice law reformers such as Judge Ben Lindsey (who later chaired the National Conference of Charities and Correction's juvenile court subcommittee).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Clapp | first = Elizabeth Jane | title = Mothers of All Children: Women Reformers and the Rise of Juvenile Courts in Progressive Era America | publisher = Penn State Press | location = University Park, Penn. | date = 1998 | isbn = 978-0-271-01778-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1918, President [[Woodrow Wilson]] sent Lathrop and [[Grace Abbott]] to represent the U.S. at an international conference on child welfare. There Lathrop consulted on the formation of a childcare bureau in the newly formed country of Czechoslovakia. After her retirement from the Children's Bureau in 1922, Lathrop became president of the Illinois [[League of Women Voters]]. She also helped form the National Committee of Mental Illness. In 1925 Lathrop represented the U.S. in Switzerland at the Child Welfare Committee established by the [[League of Nations]].

==Honors==
There is a residence hall at Rockford University and an elementary school in Rockford named after Lathrop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.education.com/schoolfinder/us/illinois/rockford/julia-lathrop-elem-school/|title=School Information &amp; Ratings on SchoolFinder|publisher=|accessdate=February 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An intermediate school in Santa Ana, California also bears her name. Although a residence hall at Vassar College is named for  Dr. Edward Lathrop, a charter trustee, he was not  Julia's father. Julia's father was William Lathrop, a lawyer  and (briefly) a congressman, from Rockford, IL.   In 1938, the [[Chicago Housing Authority]] opened the  [[Julia C. Lathrop Homes]], a public housing project in the [[North Center, Chicago|North Center]] neighborhood on Chicago's north side.

'''Knowbility''' is an [[United States|American]] [[non-governmental organization]] based in [[Austin]], [[Texas]], working to support the independence and empowerment of people with [[disabilities]] by promoting the use and improving the availability of accessible [[information technology]]. One of Knowbility's best known programs is its Accessibility Internet Rally, a web-building competition that brings together volunteer [[web designers]] and nonprofits.

==History==
The seeds of Knowbility began in 1998 with a group of individuals in Austin, Texas representing various businesses and nonprofits, who felt that there was a broad lack of knowledge and skills among website designers and information technology developers about how to create web sites that are accessible to people with [[blindness|sight impairments]], [[deafness|hearing impairments]], or other disabilities. That same year, the [[US Congress]] enacted [[Section 508]], an amendment to the [[Rehabilitation Act of 1973]], requiring federal agencies to make their electronic and information technology accessible to people with disabilities.

The group in Austin created the Accessibility Internet Rally, a program produced by the Metropolitan Austin Interactive Network (MAIN), the Central Texas chapter of the National [[Easter Seals (US)|Easter Seals Society]], and [[Goodwill Industries]] of Austin, with assistance from the [[virtual volunteering]] Project. It was held in September 1998 at the Infotec Training Center in Austin, Texas. The first AIR program was created in the style of MAIN's "web-raisings", where volunteers came together in one facility using multiple computers with Internet access and built web sites for nonprofit organizations in one day. The AIR program was different in that it was a competition, with web sites judged based on both their visual appeal, usefulness and [[accessibility]]. Each competing team was composed of one or two representatives of an Austin area nonprofit and four to six volunteer web developers. Altogether, more than 120 people were part of competing teams, representing 40 different not-for-profit, public sector and technology companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Original AIR Austin site |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19990128235501/http://www.main.org/AIR-Austin/about.html |accessdate=August 30, 2009 |url=http://www.main.org/AIR-Austin/about.html |archivedate=January 28, 1999 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program proved so successful that organizers decided to create a nonprofit that would not only make AIR an annual event in Austin, but would also create other programs and training for a national audience to promote accessibility in information technology.

==National profile==
In 1999, in addition to hosting another AIR-Austin, Knowbility staff and volunteers developed an Accessible Web Page Design Curriculum that was freely distributed on its web site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2000, Knowbility had achieved a national profile: Knowbility was mentioned on an episode of [[The Oprah Winfrey Show]] in 2000 dealing with technology issues. On September 21, 2000, the [[White House]] issued a [[press release]] to highlight programs across the country helping to bridge the digital divide for people with disabilities; the Rocky Mountain AIR program was mentioned by President [[Bill Clinton]] as a noteworthy initiative. AIR was one of three programs selected for recognition by the [[Drucker Foundation]] in October 2000. That same year, Knowbility received an awarded for Notable Achievement in the public service category of the Texas Interactive Media Awards. Also in 2000, Knowbility Board Chair [[Steve Guengerich]] and intern Josh Blakeley were featured guests of a panel discussion in Washington DC. at a National Labor Summit, where AIR activities were highlighted as a "[[best practice]]" in contributing to the employment of people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=archived page of Knowbility recognitions |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20001204162100/http://knowbility.org/recognitions.html |accessdate=August 30, 2009 |archivedate=December 4, 2000 |url=http://knowbility.org/recognitions.html |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knowbility was invited to ensure accessibility of the "ATSTAR" initiative. ATSTAR is an acronym that stands for "[[Assistive Technology]] – Strategies, Tools, Accommodations, and Resources." It is a series of computer based teacher training modules to help teachers, administrators and parents understand the legal requirements and the best practices for assessing student need for assistive technology and implementing it in the classroom. The Texas Education Agency, through their Technology Integration in Education (TIE) grant, awarded a grant to the Austin Independent School District (AISD) to fund the development of ATSTAR. Also collaborating on the initiative was Austin Community College, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin Harvard School, Sylvan Learning Center, Far South Community Schools, and Region XIII Education Service Center. Knowbility managed the accessibility of the multi-media interface. The project produced a replicable CD and web-based assistive technology training model designed to prepare instructional staff at the campus level to conduct assessments, collect data, and integrate assistive technology into the instructional setting. As the project was completed, Knowbility assumed management of the program and ATSTAR is now being used by the Georgia Project for Assistive Technology and many other educators and teachers in training. ATSTAR won recognition for outstanding community collaboration from the Texas State Legislature in May 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=archived ATSTAR web site |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050208140053/http://www.atstar.org/about.html |accessdate=August 30, 2009 |archivedate=February 8, 2005 |url=http://www.atstar.org/about.html |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2001, the [[San Francisco Women on the Web|San Francisico Women on the Web]] (SF WoW) recognized Knowbility Executive Director Sharron Rush as one of their Top 25 Women of the Web for her work to raise awareness of the need and the societal benefits of greater Internet accessibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = archived SFWOW web site| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20010815063248/http://www.top25.org/winner.html| accessdate = August 30, 2009|archivedate=August 15, 2001|url=http://www.top25.org/winner.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, Rush received the Dewey Winburne Community Service Award at the [[SXSW]] Interactive Media Conference, largely because of her work with Knowbility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SXSW 2002 Dewey Winburne Community Service Award web site |url=http://2004.sxsw.com/interactive/dewey_award/2002/ |accessdate=August 30, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061210114029/http://2004.sxsw.com/interactive/dewey_award/2002/ |archivedate=December 10, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Knowbility founder and executive director Sharron Rush, along with long-time Knowbility volunteer and trainer John M. Slatin, finished the book ''Maximum Accessibility: Making Your Web Site More Usable for Everyone'', published by [[Addison-Wesley]]. In 2003, Knowbility received the TEC Champion Award for Outstanding Technology Leadership from the Washington DC based Education Technology Think Tank and CTCNet.

Sharron Rush has served since 2007 as an invited expert to the Education and Outreach Working Group (EOWG) of the [[Web Accessibility Initiative]] (WAI) of the [[W3C]]. Since May 2009, she also serves as liaison from WAI to the e-Government Interest Group as it develops standards and best practices for using the Web to improve government accountability and transparency.

==Programs==
AIR continues annually in Austin, since 2002 in conjunction with [[SXSW]]. An AIR event is also hosted at [[St. Edward's University]], and AIR events have been conducted in Atlanta, Dallas, Denver, Houston, San Antonio and San Francisco. Volunteer teams have included employees of various corporations and businesses, including [[IBM]], [[IntelliQuest]] and [[Dell]], and government agencies, such as [[Texas Parks and Wildlife]], the [[Texas State Library and Archives Commission|Texas State Library &amp; Archives]] and the City of Austin, as well as individual volunteers forming teams independently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = winners of AIR events| url = http://www.knowbility.org/air-austin/?content=winners_history| accessdate = August 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ATSTAR program continues to train schools and community technology projects in techniques to include students with disabilities in learning activities related to computer technology.

Knowbility provides a variety of programs featuring basic and advanced training in accessible web design techniques, and is often consulted by companies and government agencies seeking to comply with state, federal, and global mandates for accessibility. Knowbility also produces three-day accessibility training institutes in Texas and California. Since 2003, Knowbility has produced [http://www.knowbility.org/conference/ The John Slatin Access U], in partnership with St. Edward's University in Austin each May. In 2005, the Pacific DBTAC, the regional Disability Business Technical Assistance Center, invited Knowbility to replicate this training on the West Coast. The first California [http://www.knowbility.org/calwac/ Web Accessibility Conference (CalWAC)] was produced that year and, the following year, the Chancellor's Office of the [[California State University]] System offered to host CalWAC; the training institute was held at CSU Long Beach in 2006 through 2009.

Knowbility was an original and ardent promoter of [[Bobby (software)|Bobby]], a free online tool provided by the Centre for Applied Special Technology (CAST) used to validate websites for [[Web Accessibility Initiative|WAI]] and [[Section 508]] compliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=archived AIR Austin web site |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19990129003445/http://www.main.org/AIR-Austin/access.html |accessdate=August 30, 2009 |archivedate=January 29, 1999 |url=http://www.main.org/AIR-Austin/access.html |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
Knowbility has one main office in Austin, Texas. As of August 2009, there are 17 full-time paid staff members. The number of part-time paid staff members, consultants and volunteers varies from month-to-month, depending on what activities Knowbility is undertaking at that time. Knowbility is governed by a [[board of directors]], with most of its members based in Austin, Texas.

Linkow held 36 patents in dental science.&lt;ref name="drb-obit"/&gt;

==Early life and education==
Linkow was born in [[Brooklyn, New York]] on February 25, 1926.&lt;ref name="library"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.linkowlibrary.org/|title= The Dr. Leonard I. Linkow Library|last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date= February 1, 2017|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played baseball in high school and was signed to contract by the [[New York Giants]] to play for their minor league affiliate in [[Springfield, Ohio]].&lt;ref name="aaid"&gt;{{cite news |author= Staff|date= January 26, 2017|title= Dr. Leonard Linkow passes away|url= http://www.aaid.com/news_and_publications/117|newspaper= American Academy of Implant Dentistry|location= |access-date= February 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He worked as a radio operator in the [[U.S. Army Air Force]] during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="drb-obit"/&gt;

Turning down a career in professional baseball, he attended New York University's College of Dentistry, graduating in 1952.&lt;ref name="drb-obit"/&gt;

==Career==
Linkow placed his first dental implant in 1952. In his New York City dental practice, he treated over 100,000 patients.&lt;ref name="drb-obit"/&gt;

His innovations in oral implantology include the blade implant, the self-tapping ventplant root form implant, [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implantologia_iuxtaossea the tripodal subperiosteal implant], and the internal hex design for root form implants.

Linkow served as the president of the American Academy of Implant Dentistry in 1974 and president of the American Board of Oral Implantology in 1993.&lt;ref name="aaid"/&gt; He co-founded the American Society of Dental Esthetics along with [[Irwin Smigel]].&lt;ref name="aegis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tribune"/&gt;

In addition to lecturing internationally, Linkow also authored 18 books and about 200 journal articles.&lt;ref name="tribune"&gt;{{cite news |last= Hoexter|first= David L.|date= December 22, 2010|title=A tribute to Dr Leonard I.

Linkow was clinical professor at [[New York University]], [[Temple University]] in Pennsylvania, the [[University of Pittsburgh]], and [[Lille University]] in France.

==Death==
Linkow died on January 26, 2017 at the age of 90.&lt;ref name="aaid"/&gt;

The oil is obtained by [[Expeller pressing|pressing]], sometimes followed by [[solvent extraction]]. Linseed oil is a [[drying oil]], meaning it can [[polymerization|polymerize]] into a solid form. Owing to its polymer-forming properties, linseed oil can be used on its own or blended with combinations of other oils, [[resins]] or [[solvent]]s as an impregnator, drying oil finish or [[varnish]] in [[wood finishing]], as a [[pigment]] binder in [[oil paint]]s, as a [[plasticizer]] and hardener in [[putty]], and in the manufacture of [[linoleum]]. Linseed oil use has declined over the past several decades with increased availability of synthetic [[alkyd]] resins—which function similarly but resist yellowing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/14356007.a01_409 |title=Alkyd Resins |year=2003 |last1=Jones |first1=Frank N.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linseed oil is an [[edible oil]] in demand as a [[nutritional supplement]], as a source of [[α-Linolenic acid]], (an [[omega-3 fatty acid]]). In parts of Europe, it is traditionally eaten with potatoes and [[Quark (dairy product)|quark]]. It is regarded as a delicacy due to its hearty taste, that enhances the flavour of quark, which is otherwise bland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.daskochrezept.de/chefkoch-rezept/hauptspeise/pellkartoffeln-mit-quark-und-leinoel_63.html| title='Rezept Kartoffeln mit Leinoel'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemical aspects==
Linseed oil is a [[triglyceride]], like other fats. Linseed oil is distinctive for its unusually large amount of [[alpha-linolenic acid|α-linolenic acid]], which has a distinctive reaction with oxygen in air. Specifically, the fatty acids in a typical linseed oil are of the following types:&lt;ref name=vereshagin&gt;A. G. Vereshagin and G. V. Novitskaya (1965) The triglyceride composition of linseed oil. Journal of the American Oil Chemists' Society 42, 970-974. [http://www.springerlink.com/content/x400165732j144v8/fulltext.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The triply unsaturated α-linolenic acid (51.9–55.2%),
*The saturated acids [[palmitic acid]] (about 7%) and [[stearic acid]] (3.4–4.6%),
*The monounsaturated [[oleic acid]] (18.5–22.6%),
*The doubly unsaturated [[linoleic acid]] (14.2–17%).

Having a high content of di- and tri-unsaturated esters, linseed oil is particularly susceptible to polymerization reactions upon exposure to oxygen in air. This polymerization, which is called 'drying', results in the rigidification of the material. The drying process can be so exothermic as to pose a fire hazard under certain circumstances. To prevent premature drying, linseed oil-based products (oil paints, putty) should be stored in airtight containers.

Like some other drying oils, linseed oil exhibits [[fluorescence]] under [[Ultraviolet light|UV light]] after degradation.&lt;ref&gt;E. René de la Rie, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1505989 Fluorescence of Paint and Varnish Layers (Part II)], Studies in Conservation Vol. 27, No. 2 (1982), pp65-69&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
Most applications of linseed oil exploit its drying properties, i.e., the initial material is liquid or at least pliable and the aged material is rigid but not brittle. The water-repelling (hydrophobic) nature of the resulting [[hydrocarbon]]-based material is advantageous.

===Paint binder===

Linseed oil is a common carrier used in [[oil paint]]. It can also be used as a painting medium, making oil paints more fluid, transparent and glossy. It is available in varieties such as cold-pressed, alkali-refined, sun-bleached, sun-thickened, and polymerised (stand oil). The introduction of linseed oil was a significant advance in the technology of oil painting.

===Putty===
Traditional glazing [[putty]], consisting of a paste of [[chalk]] powder and linseed oil, is a sealant for glass windows that hardens within a few weeks of application and can then be painted over. The durability of putty is owed to the drying properties of linseed oil.

===Wood finish===
When used as a [[Wood finishing|wood finish]], linseed oil dries slowly and shrinks little upon hardening. Linseed oil does not cover the surface as varnish does, but soaks into the (visible and microscopic) pores, leaving a shiny but not glossy surface that shows off the grain of the wood. A linseed oil finish is easily scratched, and easily repaired. Only wax finishes are less protective. Liquid water penetrates a linseed oil finish in mere minutes, and water vapour bypasses it almost completely.&lt;ref&gt;Flexner, Bob. ''Understanding Wood Finishing''. Reader's Digest Association, Inc., 2005, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Garden furniture]] treated with linseed oil may develop [[mildew]]. Oiled wood may be yellowish and is likely to darken with age. Because it fills the pores, linseed oil partially protects wood from denting by compression.

Linseed oil is a traditional finish for gun stocks, though very fine finish may require months to obtain. Several coats of linseed oil is the traditional protective coating for the raw [[willow]] wood of [[cricket]] bats; it is used so that the wood retains some moisture. New cricket bats are coated with linseed oil and [[knocking-in|knocked-in]] to perfection so that they last longer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abcofcricket.com/Article_Library/art47/art48/art48.htm James Laver, "Preparing Your Cricket Bat - Knocking In," ABC of Cricket.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Linseed oil is also often used by [[billiards]] or [[pocket billiards|pool]] cue-makers for [[Cue stick|cue shafts]], as a lubricant/protectant for wooden [[recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]]s, and used in place of epoxy to seal modern wooden [[surfboard]]s.

Additionally, a [[luthier]] may use linseed oil when reconditioning a [[guitar]], [[mandolin]], or other stringed instrument's fret board; [[lemon]]-scented [[mineral oil]] is commonly used for cleaning, then a light amount of linseed oil (or other drying oil) is applied to protect it from grime that might otherwise result in accelerated deterioration of the wood.

===Gilding===
Boiled linseed oil is used as [[sizing]] in traditional oil [[gilding]] to adhere sheets of gold leaf to a substrate (parchment, canvas, [[Armenian bole]], etc.)  It has a much longer working time than water-based size and gives a firm smooth surface which is adhesive enough in the first 12–24 hours after application to cause the gold to attach firmly to the intended surface.

===Linoleum===
Linseed oil is used to bind wood dust, cork particles, and related materials in the manufacture of the floor covering [[linoleum]].  After its invention in 1860 by [[Frederick Walton]], linoleum, or 'lino' for short, was a common form of domestic and industrial floor covering from the 1870s until the 1970s when it was largely replaced by [[polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] ('vinyl') floor coverings.&lt;ref&gt;S. Diller and J. Diller, ''Craftsman's Construction Installation Encyclopedia'', Craftsman Book Company, 2004, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vTVE7kRgQ38C&amp;pg=PA503 p. 503]&lt;/ref&gt; However, since the 1990s, linoleum is on the rise again, being considered more environmentally sound than PVC.&lt;ref&gt;Julie K. Rayfield, ''The Office Interior Design Guide: An Introduction for Facility and Design Professionals'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1994, [https://books.google.com/books?id=uOliu8yjoTEC&amp;pg=PA209 p. 209]&lt;/ref&gt; Linoleum has given its name to the printmaking technique [[linocut]], in which a relief design is cut into the smooth surface and then inked and used to print an image.  The results are similar to those obtained by [[woodcut]] printing.

===Nutritional supplement and food===
Raw cold-pressed linseed oil &amp;ndash; commonly known as flax seed oil in nutritional contexts &amp;ndash; is easily oxidized, and rapidly becomes rancid, with an unpleasant [[odour]], unless [[refrigeration|refrigerated]].  Even when kept under cool conditions, it has a shelf life of only a few weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.busywomensfitness.com/flax-seed-oil.html| title=Flax Seed Oil| publisher=Busy Women's Fitness| accessdate=2008-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious |Oxidization - rapid or slow? |reason=Other sources make exactly the opposite claim: according to those, the linseed oil oxidization would be rather a slow process |date=January 2015}} Oil with an unpleasant or rancid odor should be discarded.  Oxidation of flax seed oil is a major commercial concern, and antioxidants may be added to prevent [[rancidification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| doi= 10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2005.03.042| title=Studies on a natural antioxidant for stabilization of edible oil and comparison with synthetic antioxidants| journal=Journal of Food Engineering| volume=74| issue=4|date=June 2006| pages=542–545|author1=D. Berab|author2=D. Lahirib  |author3=A. Naga |lastauthoramp=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linseed oil is not generally recommended for use in cooking, yet one study does show that the [[alpha-linolenic acid|alpha linolenic acid (ALA)]] while bound in flaxseed was found to be stable for cooking. When bound to flaxseed ALA can withstand temperatures up to 350 degrees F (176.67 C) for two hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02540591 |title=Oxidative stability of flaxseed lipids during baking |accessdate=2013-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Food-grade flaxseed oil is cold-pressed, obtained without solvent extraction, in the absence of oxygen, and marketed as edible flaxseed oil.  Fresh, refrigerated and unprocessed, linseed oil is used as a [[nutritional supplement]] and is a traditional European ethnic food, highly regarded for its hearty taste. It contains the highest level of the omega-3 fatty acid ALA among vegetable oils.&lt;ref&gt;Muir, Alister D. (2003). ''Flax, The genus Linum'', p. 298.

==Modified linseed oils==

===Stand oil===
Stand oil is generated by heating linseed oil near 300&amp;nbsp;°C for a few days in the complete absence of air.  Under these conditions, the polyunsaturated fatty esters convert to conjugated [[diene]]s, which then undergo [[Diels-Alder reaction]]s, leading to crosslinking.  The product, which is highly viscous, gives highly uniform coatings that "dry" to more elastic coatings than linseed oil itself.  [[Soybean oil]] can be treated similarly, but converts more slowly.  On the other hand, [[tung oil]] converts very quickly, being complete in minutes at 260&amp;nbsp;°C.  Coatings prepared from stand oils are less prone to yellowing than are coatings derived from the parent oils.&lt;ref name=Ull&gt;Ulrich Poth, "Drying Oils and Related Products" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2002. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a09_055}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Boiled linseed oil===
Boiled linseed oil is a combination of raw linseed oil, stand oil (see above), and metallic dryers (catalysts to accelerate drying).&lt;ref name=Ull/&gt; In the [[Medieval era]], linseed oil was boiled with [[lead oxide]] (litharge) to give a product called boiled linseed oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Medieval and Renaissance Treatises on the Arts of Painting: Original Texts|author=Merrifield, Mary P.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C-uiAK74XpsC&amp;pg=PR239&amp;lpg=PR239&amp;dq=boiled+linseed+oil+litharge&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XJfIX8dSs_&amp;sig=SW-ao9-vvLAmULQEjByzTToWWTY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RrHOU5OlLIGBiwK0mIH4Cw&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=boiled%20linseed%20oil%20litharge&amp;f=false|isbn=0486142248|year=2012|publisher=Dover Publications, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2017}}  The lead oxide forms lead "soaps" (lead oxide is [[alkaline]]) which promotes hardening (polymerisation) of linseed oil by reaction with atmospheric oxygen. Heating shortens its drying time.

=== Raw linseed oil ===
Raw linseed oil is the base oil, unprocessed and without driers or thinners. It is mostly used as a feedstock for making a boiled oil. It does not cure sufficiently well or quickly to be regarded as a [[drying oil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Raw linseed is sometimes used for [[Cricket bat#Oiling|oiling cricket bats]] to increase surface friction for better ball control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

  |url=http://www.gm-cricket.com/pages/bat-care.aspx
}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also used to treat [[Belt (mechanical)#Flat belts|leather flat belt drive]]s to reduce slipping.

==Spontaneous combustion==
Rags soaked with linseed oil stored in a pile are considered a fire hazard because they provide a large surface area for [[oxidation]] of the oil, which oxidises quickly. The oxidation of linseed oil is an [[exothermic]] reaction, which [[Thermal runaway|accelerates]] as the temperature of the rags increases.  When heat accumulation exceeds the rate of heat dissipation into the environment, the temperature increases and may eventually become hot enough to make the rags [[spontaneous combustion|spontaneously combust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF02590415 |title=Spontaneous combustion of linseed oil in sawdust |year=1971 |last1=Ettling |first1=Bruce V. |last2=Adams |first2=Mark F. |journal=Fire Technology |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, [[One Meridian Plaza]], a high rise in [[Philadelphia]], was severely damaged and three firefighters perished in a fire thought to be caused by linseed oil-soaked rags.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.usfa.dhs.gov/downloads/pdf/publications/tr-049.pdf|title=Highrise Office Building Fire One Meridian Plaza Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|publisher=Federal Emergency Management Agency|first=J.

A '''long-term experiment''' is an [[experiment]]al procedure that runs through a long period of time, in order to test a [[hypothesis]] or observe a phenomenon that takes place at an extremely slow rate.

Several agricultural [[field experiment]]s have run for more than 100 years, but much shorter experiments may qualify as "long-term" in other disciplines.  An [[experiment]] is "a set of actions and observations", implying that one or more treatments (fertilizer, subsidized school lunches, etc.) is imposed on the system under study.  Long-term experiments therefore contrast with nonexperimental long-term studies in which manipulation of the system studied is impossible (Jupiter's [[Great Red Spot]]) or undesirable (field observations of [[chimpanzee]] behavior).

==Physics==

The [[Oxford Electric Bell]] has been ringing at [[Oxford University]] since 1840, although there is some reason to believe it may be 15 years older.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

The [[Beverly Clock]] at the [[University of Otago]] has been running since 1864.

The [[pitch drop experiment]] has been running at the [[University of Queensland]] since 1927.

==Botany==
The [[William James Beal#Germination Experiment|William James Beal Germination Experiment]] has been running since 1879. It is the oldest on-going experiment in botany. It is scheduled for completion in 2100.

The [[Godwin Plots]] experiment at the [[Wicken Fen]] reserve in [[Cambridgeshire]], England, has been running since the 1920s and explores the differences between areas of vegetation which are never cut, and respectively all four, three or two years and every year.

==Long-term agricultural field experiments==
[[File:Broadbalk Experiment Rothamstead.jpg|thumb|Broadbalk Experiment Rothamsted]]

Long-term experiments test the sustainability of different farming practices, as measured by yield trends over decades.  Examples include the [[Park Grass Experiment]] at [[Rothamsted Experimental Station]] (1843–present), the [[Morrow Plots]] (1876–present) at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]], the [[Magruder Plots]] (1892–present) at [[Oklahoma State University]],  Auburn's [[Old Rotation]] (1896–present), and the [[Haughley Experiment]] (1939-1982?).

Experiments at Rothamsted showed that "grain yields can be sustained (and even increased) for almost 150 years in monocultures of wheat and barley given organic or inorganic fertilizer annually".&lt;ref&gt;Agronomy Journal 83:2-10&lt;/ref&gt; These results show that practices considered unsustainable by some advocates of [[sustainable agriculture]] may preserve "the ability of a farm to produce perpetually", at least under some circumstances.  But even if [[crop diversity]] in space or time ([[crop rotation]]) and organic inputs are not always essential to sustainability, there is abundant evidence from Rothamsted and elsewhere that they are often beneficial.

An experiment in alpine pasture has been ongoing in Switzerland at [[Schynige Platte]] from the 1920s looking at the human effect on the alpine environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Hegg |first1=Otto |last2=Schaffner |first2=Urs |date=2012 |title= 80 Jahre experimentelle Ökosystemforschung auf der Schynigen Platte im Berner Oberland|trans-title= |url=https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=oY0vvz4VUuoC&amp;dq=langzeit+experiment+schynige+platte&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |dead-url= |format= |language= German|location= |publisher= Haupt Verlag AG|isbn= |archive-url= |archive-date= |via= |subscription= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Haughley Experiment was noteworthy as a rare example of a long-term experiment in organic farming without external inputs of nutrients.  After about 30 years, however, it was decided to start importing manure.  There is some disagreement whether a "decline in relative yields from the organic section" was due to a depletion of soil nutrients.&lt;ref&gt;Agriculture Ecosystems and Environment 30:1-26&lt;/ref&gt;

Various short-term experiments have used legumes (in symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing [[rhizobia]]) as a nitrogen source, but good short-term yields do not prove the system is sustainable.  The problem is that release of nitrogen from [[soil organic matter]] can make up any shortfall of nitrogen from legumes for a decade or more. The Old Rotation showed that nitrogen from legumes can balance nitrogen removed in a harvested crop over the long term.  A key point is that the nitrogen in the legumes was not removed, as it would be with a soybean crop, but was plowed under as a green manure.  In the Old Rotation, the green manure was grown during the winter to supply nitrogen to a summer crop (cotton); this would be less practical in colder climates.

Long-term agricultural experiments that have been started more recently include the [http://russellranch.ucdavis.edu Long-Term Research on Agricultural Systems] experiments at UC Davis, started in 1993.

==Long-term microbiology experiments==

[[File:500 Year Microbiology Experiment2.JPG|thumb|A photo showing the components of the 500-year microbiology experiment]]
[[File:Chrococcidiopsis Glass Ampoules.jpg|thumb|Chroococcidiopsis glass ampoules]]
At the UK Centre for Astrobiology within The [[University of Edinburgh]] and at the Institute of Aerospace Medicine with the [[German Aerospace Centre]], [[Charles Cockell]] and Ralf Möller established the "500-Year Microbiology Experiment" that started in July 2014 to study the loss of viability of [[desiccation]]-resistant bacteria over long periods. The experiment involves the study of vegetative bacteria (the extreme tolerant cyanobacterium, ''Chroococcidiopsis'' sp.) and spore-forming bacteria (''Bacillus subtilis'').&lt;ref&gt;Charles Cockell (May 2014) "The 500-Year Microbiology Experiment", ''Microbiology Today'', 95–96, http://www.sgm.ac.uk/en/publications/microbiology-today/past-issues.cfm/publication/world-war-I/article/49E6A445-B246-4034-A4E2DE4314948E55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles Cockell (2015) A 500-year experiment, ''Astronomy and Geophysics'', 56:1, 28–29, http://astrogeo.oxfordjournals.org/content/56/1/1.28.full.pdf?etoc&lt;/ref&gt;

The experiment comprises two oak wooden boxes containing duplicate samples, to be kept at the University of Edinburgh and the [[Natural History Museum]]. Every two years for the next 24 years, triplicate samples of both organisms contained within glass ampoules will be opened and the number of viable cells enumerated. The first time point was taken in 2014. Within each box, the experiment is duplicated into a reduced and non-reduced background radiation experiment, with one set of samples being kept in a lead box to cut back background radiation, allowing the impact of radiation in combination with desiccation on viability to be studied over long periods. It was motivated by a desire to understand how microbes survive desiccation in deserts, rocks, permafrost and their potential survival in space. The destruction and pathways of degradation of biomolecules will also be studied. In addition to the core experiment, there are a variety of samples including dried agar plates and endoliths for investigation over long periods.

One of the wooden boxes was delivered to the Natural History Museum on 27 February 2015, and will be curated within the cyanobacterial collection.

==In evolutionary biology==
The experiments of [[Richard Lenski]] on [[E. coli long-term evolution experiment|evolution of ''E. coli'']] have been underway since 1988 for more than 50,000 generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Blount |first1=Z.

==Long-term ecological experiments==

The US National Science Foundation supports a number of long-term ecological experiments, mostly in ecosystems that are less directly affected by humans than most agricultural ecosystems are.  See [[LTER]]. Within the UK the [[Ecological Continuity Trust]] works to promote and secure the future of long-term ecological experiments, maintaining a register of experiments where treatments have been applied for a minimum of six years.

A number of other areas, sometimes called [[involuntary park]]s, can be regarded as long time ecological experiments, because they have been abandoned by humans and returned to near-[[feral]] condition.  These include areas abandoned for political reasons, such as the  [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]], or environmental contamination, such as the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Exclusion Zone]].

==Medicine and psychology==
The [[Framingham Heart Study]] has been running continuously since 1948.

The [[Grant Study]] at the Laboratory of Adult Development in the Department of Psychiatry at [[Brigham and Women's Hospital]], a [[Harvard Medical School]] affiliate, is conducting a [[longitudinal study]] of human [[adult development]], by following two groups of individuals as they age (268 [[Harvard University|Harvard]] graduates and 456 males from inner-city [[Boston]]). The study has been ongoing since 1937 and is currently the longest running study of adult life ever conducted.

Outsourcing of [[emergency department]] physicians, as well as radiologists and anesthesiologists in operating rooms, grew rapidly in the United States in the 2000s due a combination of several economic forces, and medical staffing companies developed niche expertise in various medical specialties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Boyd |first1=JB |last2=McGrath |first2=MH |last3=Maa |first3=J |title=Emerging trends in the outsourcing of medical and surgical care. |journal=Archives of Surgery (Chicago, Ill. : 1960) |date=January 2011 |volume=146 |issue=1 |pages=107–12 |doi=10.1001/archsurg.2010.308 |pmid=21242454}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Barkholz |first1=Dave |title=AmSurg-Envision merger aims at hospital appetite for buffet of physician services |url=http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20160618/MAGAZINE/306189965 |work=Modern Healthcare |date=June 18, 2016 |language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2008 a number of Swedish hospitals have used [[teleradiology]] services to outsource their emergency night-time radiology to Australia where daytime staff cover Swedish nighttime patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dagensmedicin.se/artiklar/2017/02/17/nu-granskas-norrtaljes-rontgenbilder-pa-andra-sidan-jorden/|title=Nu granskas Norrtäljes röntgenbilder på andra sidan jorden|work=Dagens Medicin|access-date=2018-07-06|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=97&amp;artikel=6510593|title=Röntgenplåtar skickas till Australien|last=Johansson|first=Christopher|date=2016-09-05|work=Sveriges Radio|access-date=2018-07-06|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.svt.se/nyheter/lokalt/vast/rontgenbilder-skickas-utomlands|title=Röntgenbilder skickas utomlands|last=Nyheter|first=SVT|date=2010-05-03|work=SVT Nyheter|access-date=2018-07-06|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical tourism==
People needing or wanting healthcare sometimes make decisions to seek care in a different jurisdiction; the decision may be based on lack of quality, availability, or legality in the person's home jurisdiction, or it may be a business decision based on the cost of acquiring the care. This form of medical outsourcing on the consumer side is generally called [[medical tourism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Boyd |first1=JB |last2=McGrath |first2=MH |last3=Maa |first3=J |title=Emerging trends in the outsourcing of medical and surgical care. |journal=Archives of Surgery (Chicago, Ill. : 1960) |date=January 2011 |volume=146 |issue=1 |pages=107–12 |doi=10.1001/archsurg.2010.308 |pmid=21242454}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lunt |first1=Neil |last2=Smith |first2=Richard |last3=Exworthy |first3=Mark |last4=Green |first4=Stephen T. |last5=Horsfall |first5=Daniel |last6=Mannion |first6=Russell |title=Medical Tourism: Treatments, Markets and Health System Implications: A scoping review |url=https://www.oecd.org/els/health-systems/48723982.pdf |publisher=OECD |date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Peebes_Hospital_BVI.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Peebles Hospital.  The new building is the main building shown.  The original building is visible in the foreground below.]]

'''Peebles Hospital''' is the main public hospital in the [[British Virgin Islands]].  The hospital is located in the capital, [[Road Town]], on the island of [[Tortola]].  It was founded in 1922 by Major [[H.W. Peebles]], and was originally known as the '''Cottage Hospital'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bvihsa.vg/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/NPH-Pledge-Programme-brochure_final.pdf|title=History of Peebles Hospital|publisher=BVI HSA|page=4|accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In the Public Hospital Act (Cap 177) the hospital is referred to as the "Tortola Cottage Hospital", but the statute was amended by the General Revision Act, 1992 to change the description to "Peebles Hospital".&lt;/ref&gt;   

==Name==

In the 1950s the hospital was renamed after Major Peebles.  During the early 1990s it was briefly renamed the '''H.R. Penn Hospital''' (after [[Howard Reynold Penn|H.R. Penn]]) before reverting to its current name.  In 2015 it was again suggested that it be renamed after [[Orlando Smith]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bviplatinum.com/news.php?articleId=1438082935|title=Name New Hospital In Honour Of Dr. Smith - Patsy Lake At Opening Of Festival|publisher=BVI Platinum|date=28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but that suggestion was not popular, has not been acted upon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virginislandsnewsonline.com/en/news/talk-show-host-against-renaming-peebles-hospital-after-premier-smith|title=Talk show host against renaming Peebles Hospital after Premier Smith|publisher=Virgin Islands News Online|date=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Redevelopment==

After surviving in its original building for nearly 90 years, the Government embarked upon an ambitious attempt to build a new hospital complex immediately behind the existing hospital.  The new hospital was originally budgeted at approximately US$10 million, and expected to take just under 2 years to construct.  In the event, the hospital cost well over US$100 million to construct, and took over a decade.  It also costs a further US$16 million to furnish to become operational.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bvinews.com/new/new-hospital-finally-completed-health-minister-appeals-for-donations/|title=New hospital finally completed; Health Minister appeals for donations|publisher=BVI News|date=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Government was forced to appeal to private donors to help pay some of the cost of furnishing the new hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bviplatinum.com/news.php?articleId=1404474462|title=More Help Needed To Equip New Hospital; Opening Date Changes|publisher=BVI Platinum|date=4 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After numerous false starts, the hospital finally opened on 29 December 2014.&lt;ref name=29Dec2014&gt;{{cite news |title=First Patients Set Foot In New Hospital Today |url=http://www.bviplatinum.com/news.php?articleId=1419865737 |publisher=BVI Platinum |date=29 December 2014 |accessdate=30 December 2014 |quote=The British Virgin Islands Health Services Authority (BVIHSA) has completed the full transition to the new mulitmillion dollar Peebles Hospital today, Monday, December 29, the authority disclosed.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Deputy Premier Kendrick Pickering described the new hospital as "a dream come true".&lt;ref name=29Dec2014 /&gt;

The cost overruns were caused by a combination of bad project management, disputes with construction crews, and ever-changing lists of specifications.  Although historically the British Virgin Islands has normally produced a Government budget surplus, but shortly after commencing the new Peebles Hospital projectthe Territory began to run at a deficit (this time period also coincided with the [[financial crisis of 2007–2008]]).  In 2011 the Territory had its largest ever budget deficit, of US$29 million (approximately 2.6% of GDP),&lt;ref name="2013 Budget Address"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bvi.org.uk/files/2013_Budget_Address.pdf|title=2013 Budget Address|publisher=BVI Government}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and by 2012 public debt had quadrupled from pre-2007 levels to approximately US$113 million (approximately 10.3% of GDP).&lt;ref name="Public Debt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bvinews.com/bvi/national-debt-grows-by-73m-over-last-decade-public-sector-too-big-financial-secretary/|title=National debt grows by $73M over last decade; public sector too big – Financial Secretary|publisher=BVI News|date=24 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nearly 84% of that public debt was attributable to the new public hospital project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caribbeanmedicalnews.com/2013/04/new-hospital-responsible-for-nearly-84-of-national-debt/|title=New hospital responsible for nearly 84% of national debt|publisher=Caribbean Medical News|date=26 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The Economist]]'' argued that deteriorating economic conditions in the British Virgin Islands were caused "not [by] sagging revenues but public-sector profligacy",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/americas/21578418-britains-caribbean-dependencies-have-been-hurt-economic-stagnation-war-tax-havens-and|title=Treasure islands in trouble|publisher=''[[The Economist]]''|date=25 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; an oblique reference to the disastrous financial mismanagement of the hospital project.

'''People's Health Movement''' (PHM) is a global network of grassroots health [[activists]], [[civil society]] organizations and academic institutions particularly from [[developing countries]]. PHM currently has bases in more than 70 countries that include both individuals and well-established circles with their own governance structures. It has chapters in South Asia (India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka), Africa (South Africa), Pacific (Australia), South America (Brazil, Ecuador), Central America (El Salvador, Nicaragua, Guatemala), North America (USA, Canada), Europe (Italy, Switzerland, UK, Greece) and several other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-21915575_ITM|title=Indian Health Professionals to launch Peoples Health Movement in Pakistan.|date=July 6, 2004|work=Pakistan Press International Information Services Limited|accessdate=2009-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=125&amp;art_id=vn20070909093053476C114959  |title=Health for all now, demand marchers |last= Barnes|first= Clayton|date=September 9, 2007|work=Sunday Argus|page=4|accessdate=2009-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/breakfast/stories/2005/1329678.htm|title=People's Health Movement|date=23 March 2005 |work=Australian Broadcasting Corporation - Radio National Breakfast|accessdate=2009-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; PHM works towards the revitalisation of [[Primary Health Care]] (PHC), as described in the [[Alma-Ata Declaration]] of 1978.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phmovement.org/cms/files/Alma-Ata_Declaration.pdf Alma-Ata Declaration]&lt;/ref&gt;

Vision of PHM:

"Equity, ecologically-sustainable development and peace are at the heart of our vision of a better world - a world in which a healthy life for all is a reality; a world that respects, appreciates and celebrates all life and diversity; a world that enables the flowering of people's talents and abilities to enrich each other; a world in which people's voices guide the decisions that shape our lives...."

==History==
At the Alma-Ata Conference in 1978, health ministers from 134 countries, in association with the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) and [[UNICEF]], set a goal of achieving "Health for All by the Year 2000" and identified primary health care as the mean to achieve it. However, in response to continued and deepened health [[Equal opportunity|inequalities]], on 8 December 2000, 1453 delegates from 92 countries met at [[Savar]], [[Bangladesh]] for the First ''People's Health Assembly'' which led to the founding of the People's Health Movement and the drafting of the People's Charter for Health&lt;ref name=phm&gt;Website of PHM. In 2005, a second People’s Health Assembly was organised and lead to the development of the Cuenca Declaration. In 2012, the Third People’s Health Assembly was held in Cape Town out of which a Call to Action was developed.  [http://www.phmovement.org/cms/en/resources/charters/peopleshealth LINK]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zafrullah Chowdhury and Michael Rowson (2000) The People's Health Assembly: Revitalising the promise of "Health for All''. ''British Medical Journal''321;1361-1362. {{doi|10.1136/bmj.321.7273.1361}} [http://www.equinetafrica.org/bibl/docs/CHOehs.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

==People's Charter for Health==
The People's Charter for Health echos many of the principles of the [[Alma Ata Declaration]] by recognizing health as "..a social, economic and political issue and above all a fundamental human right".&lt;ref name=phm /&gt; It names "inequality, poverty, exploitation, violence and injustice" as the main drivers of ill-health and calls for "Health for ALL NOW" through the involvement of people's organizations in health decision making.&lt;ref name=phm /&gt; PHM attributes the inequity in health care to the [[Free market|''laissez faire'']]  economic practices globally and seeks to counter these practices and challenge health policy makers around the world with a Peoples Health Campaign for Health for All-Now!&lt;ref name=narayan&gt;Narayan, R., Schuftan, C. 2008. People’s Health Movement ''In'' K. Heggenhougen and S. Quah, Eds., ''International Encyclopedia of Public Health'', Vol.5, San Diego Academic Press, pp.41-45&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social Determinants of Health==
''See Also'': [[Social determinants of health]] and [[Social determinants of health in poverty]]

PHM also works to address the [[Social determinants of health]], including in particular, the growing inequity within and between nations attributed by them to unfair economic structures which lock people into [[poverty]] and poor health. PHM helped to put the Social Determinants of Health on the global agenda through continued engagement with the World Health Organization.&lt;ref&gt;Narayan, R: "The role of the People's Health Movement in putting the social determinants of health on the global agenda", ''Health Promotion Journal of Australia'', 17(3):186&lt;/ref&gt; In response Prof. [[Fran Baum]] (Australia), at that time Chair of the PHM Steering Council, was appointed as a commissioner on the [[Social determinants of health|WHO Commission on Social Determinants of Health]] (CSDH). Working with other civil society organizations, PHM helped gather evidence for the WHO final report on the Social Determinants of health released in August 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Report of the WHO Commission on Social Determinants of Health. [http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2008/9789241563703_eng.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; PHM's engagement with the Commission's work also resulted in the publication of a Civil Society Report on Social Determinants of Health.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/social_determinants/resources/cso_finalreport_2007.pdf Civil Society Report on Social Determinants of Health]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 PHM was involved in the civil society side meeting during the Conference on Social Determinants of Health, taking place in Rio de Janeiro.

==Campaign on Right to Health==
The PHM is engaged in a major global campaign to promote the Right to Health which involves coordinated national and international level action.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phmovement.org/en/campaigns/145/page]&lt;/ref&gt; PHM uses a consultative process in countries to involve thousands of people in making a demand for Health for All as described in the Alma Ata Declaration of 1978.

The first phase of the campaign involves the production of rights-based evaluations of national health policies in countries with PHM circles. The global coordinating group has developed The Assessment of the Right to Health at the Country Level: A People's Health Movement Guide for national PHM circles to use to produce consistent reports using human rights law. The second phase of the campaign focuses on movement building and mobilisation.

==Global Health Watch==
The Peoples Health Movement plays a lead role in co-ordinating the production of the Global Health watch.

In an increasingly integrated, globalised world with new cross-border threats to health, widening disparities in both health and access to health care, and an unacceptable level of human suffering and premature mortality in developing countries, people across the globe are asking, why is so little progress being made by in promoting health in the world?

The Global Health Watch&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ghwatch.org Website of Global Health Watch]&lt;/ref&gt; is designed to seek answers to this question and also to start articulating solutions. It is an endeavour to propose to the global community an alternate vision of health that is located in a vision of equity, rights and empowerment. It is a collaborative exercise, initiated by the Peoples Health Movement (PHM), Global Equity Gauge Alliance (GEGA) and Medact in 2004. An important outcome of the process is the periodic publication of a document termed the Global Health Watch – a document that is contributed to by researchers, academics and activists from across the globe. Two editions of the document have been published, the first in 2005 as Global Health Watch I and the second in 2008 as Global Health Watch II. The third edition of the GHW is to be published in 2011.{{update after|2011|12|31}} The Global Health Watch aims to:

 
* Promote human rights as the basis for health policy
* Counterbalance liberal and market-driven perspectives
* Shift the health policy agenda to recognise the political, social and economic barriers to better health
* Improve civil society's capacity to hold national and international governments, global international financial institutions and corporations to account (including WHO and the World Bank)
* Strengthen the links between civil society organisations around the world
* Provide a forum for magnifying the voice of the poor and vulnerable

The document is divided into the following broad sections:

1.	An analysis of the global political and economic architecture, within which are located the decisions and choices that impact on health.

2.	A view of current issues and debates on health systems across the world, from which it is possible to draw appropriate lessons and propose concrete actions for promoting health.

3.	Beyond Health Care – a discussion of different determinants of health

4.	The Watching Section – dedicated to the scrutiny of global processes and institutions that are crucially important for health and health care in the globe.

5.	A section proposing alternatives and highlighting stories of success and resistance that are exemplars of actual actions that have contributed to better health and health care.

Thus, unlike other reports on global health, the Global Health Watch also draws attention to the politics of global health and the policies and actions of key actors. The document is also a call to all health workers to broaden and strengthen the global community of health advocates who are taking action on global ill-health and inequalities, and their underlying political and economic determinants. Not only is it an educational resource for health professionals and activists, it makes clear the need for global health advocates to engage in lobbying many key actors to do better and to do more, whilst resisting those that do harm. It also seeks to act as a catalyst for the development and strengthening of existing campaigns around the world to improve health and equity. 
The document published as the Global Health Watch is, thus, a culmination of a global process. Typically, each Watch is contributed to directly by over 200 people from across the globe. While the published document is an important product, it is by no means the only outcome to be desired from the entire process. The process of producing the Watch involves the animation of a large number of different processes, in different regions and countries. The process promotes the scrutiny of national and regional policies related to health. It also promotes debate among health academics and activists on key issues that are critical for the promotion of global health.

The Watch itself has different uses and target audiences. It is a lobbying tool for health movements to work on policy makers in countries and global institutions. It is also a resource book for academics and health activists. It is a tool to mobilise civil society on issues of major concern. Thus the Global Health Watch goes much beyond the production of one document. Further, the launch of the GHW in different parts of the world is an opportunity to mobilise around issues that impact on access to health and health care.

While the PHM is responsible for the Secretariat of the Global Health Watch, its co-ordinating group also includes Medact (based in the UK), Health Action International, Medicos (Germany) and Third World Network.

==International  People’s Health University – IPHU ==
The International People’s Health University is a short training course for young health activists focussing on the politics of health. The IPHU has organized 20 short courses entitled ‘The Struggle for Health’ of 2-week duration each.  The courses have been organized in over 15 countries so far, in 9 languages and attended by about 1000 health activists from more than 60 countries.

== thematic campaigns ==
PHM activists organise following thematic groups in addition to their local or regional activities based on local needs and issues:

Extractive Industries

Access to Affordable quality health care and medicines

Food sovereignty

Anti privatisation of Health care

Gender and reproductive justice

Trade and health

PHM advocates that Health should not be viewed as a commodity that is traded in the market. The PHM supports the call for taking health related subjects out of the global trade negotiations and from the [[World Trade Organization|World Trade Organisation]] (WTO) and other regional and bilateral trade agreements. The PHM views the agreement on Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights(TRIPS) as iniquitous and against the interest of developing countries and poor patients. It supports legislation in India and other countries which allows generic drug companies to manufacture medications still covered by patents in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=36357|title=HEALTH-INDIA:  Patients Before Patents, Groups Urge|last=Leahy|first=Stephen|date= January 29, 2007|work=Inter Press Service|accessdate=2009-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Phallic sculpture Nepal 1973.JPG|right|250px|thumb|Phallic religious sculpture of [[Linga]], [[Kathmandu]] street, Nepal 1973]]

A '''phallus''' is a [[penis]] (especially when [[Erection|erect]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/phallus "Definition of phallus in English"] Oxford Dictionaries. Retrieved 16 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; an object that resembles a penis, or a [[mimesis|mimetic]] image of an erect penis.

Any object that symbolically—or, more precisely, iconically—resembles a penis may also be referred to as a phallus; however, such objects are more often referred to as being '''phallic''' (as in "'''phallic symbol'''"). Such symbols often represent fertility and cultural implications that are associated with the male sexual organ, as well as the [[male orgasm]].

==Etymology==
[[File:Tintinnabulum Pompeii MAN Napoli Inv27839.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Tintinnabulum (Ancient Rome)|Tintinnabulum]] from Pompeii showing a phallus]]
The term is a loanword from [[Latin]] ''phallus'', itself borrowed from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|φαλλός}}, which is ultimately a derivation from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] [[Root (linguistics)|root]] *''bʰel''- "to inflate, swell". Compare with [[Old Norse]] (and [[Icelandic language|modern Icelandic]]) ''boli'' "[[bull]]", [[Old English]] ''bulluc'' "[[Cattle|bullock]]", Greek {{lang|grc|φαλλή}} "[[whale]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=penis&amp;searchmode=none etymonline.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeology==

The Hohle phallus, a 28,000-year-old siltstone phallus discovered in the [[Hohle Fels]] cave and reassembled in 2005, is among the oldest phallic representations known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jonathan|last=Amos
|title=Ancient phallus unearthed in cave|publisher=BBC News|date=2005-07-25

==Religion==

===Classical antiquity===
[[File:Bronze ithyphallic figurine with a head of phalluses.jpg|thumb|left|125px|Polyphallic wind chime from [[Pompeii]]; a bell hung from each phallus]]
[[File:0007MAN-Herma.jpg|thumb|100px|left|[[Herma|Herm]]]]
In traditional [[Greek mythology]], [[Hermes]], god of boundaries and exchange (popularly the ''messenger'' god) is considered to be a phallic deity by association with representations of him on [[herms]] (pillars) featuring a phallus. There is no scholarly consensus on this depiction and it would be speculation to consider Hermes a type of fertility god.  [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]], son of [[Hermes]], was often depicted as having an exaggerated erect phallus.

[[Priapus]] is a Greek god of fertility whose symbol was an exaggerated phallus. The son of [[Aphrodite]] and either [[Dionysus]] or [[Adonis]], according to different forms of the original myth, he is the protector of livestock, fruit plants, gardens, and male genitalia.  His name is the origin of the medical term [[priapism]].

The city of [[Tyrnavos]] in Greece holds an annual [[Phallic processions|Phallus festival]], a traditional phallophoric event on the first days of [[Lent]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,553070,00.html "The Annual Phallus Festival in Greece"], ''Der Spiegel'', English edition, Retrieved on the 15-12-08&lt;/ref&gt;

The phallus was ubiquitous in [[culture of ancient Rome|ancient Roman culture]], particularly in the form of the ''[[fascinum]]'', a phallic charm. The ruins of [[Pompeii]] produced bronze wind chimes ''([[Tintinnabulum (Ancient Rome)|tintinnabula]])'' that featured the phallus, often in multiples, to ward off the [[evil eye]] and other malevolent influences. Statues of Priapus similarly guarded gardens. Roman boys wore the ''[[Bulla (amulet)|bulla]]'', an amulet that contained a phallic charm, until they formally came of age. According to [[Augustine of Hippo]], the cult of [[Liber|Father Liber]], who presided over the citizen's entry into political and sexual manhood, involved a phallus. The phallic deity [[Mutunus Tutunus]] promoted marital sex. A sacred phallus was among the objects considered vital to the security of the Roman state which were in the keeping of the [[Vestal Virgins]]. [[Sexuality in ancient Rome]] has sometimes been characterized as "[[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Phallic sexuality|phallocentric]]".

===Ancient Egypt===
[[File:Osiris statuette cropped.jpg|thumb|Egyptian statuette of Osiris with phallus and [[amulet]]s]]
The phallus played a role in the cult of [[Osiris]] in [[ancient Egyptian religion]]. When Osiris' body was cut in 14 pieces, [[Set (mythology)|Set]] scattered them all over Egypt and his wife [[Isis]] retrieved all of them except one, his penis, which was swallowed by a fish; see the [[Legend of Osiris and Isis]]. Isis made him a wooden replacement.

The phallus was a symbol of fertility, and the god [[Min (god)|Min]] was often depicted as ithyphallic, that is, with an erect penis.

''Kuker'' is a divinity personifying fecundity, sometimes in [[Bulgaria]] and [[Serbia]] it is a plural divinity. In Bulgaria, a ritual spectacle of spring (a sort of [[carnival]] performed by [[Kukeri]]) takes place after a scenario of folk theatre, in which Kuker's role is interpreted by a man attired in a sheep- or goat-pelt, wearing a horned mask and girded with a large wooden phallus. During the ritual, various physiological acts are interpreted, including the sexual act, as a symbol of the god's sacred marriage, while the symbolical wife, appearing pregnant, mimes the pains of giving birth. This ritual inaugurates the labours of the fields ([[ploughing]], [[sowing]]) and is carried out with the participation of numerous allegorical personages, among which is the Emperor and his entourage.&lt;ref name="Kernbach"&gt;Kernbach, Victor (1989).

In [[Switzerland]], the heraldic bears in a coat of arms had to be painted with bright red [[penis]]es, otherwise they would have been mocked as being she-bears. In 1579, a calendar printed in [[St. Gallen]] omitted the genitals from the heraldic bear of [[Appenzell]], nearly leading to war between the two cantons.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | last1=Neubecker | first1=Ottfried | title=Heraldry : sources, symbols, and meaning | date=1976 | publisher=McGraw-Hill | location=New York | isbn=9780070463080 | page=120 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | last1=Strehler | first1=Hermann | title=Das Churer Missale von 1589 | journal=Gutenberg-Jahrbuch | date=1965 | volume=40 | page=186 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | last1=Grzimek | first1=Bernhard | title=Grzimek's Animal life encyclopedia | date=1972 | publisher=Van Nostrand Reinhold Co. | location=New York | volume=12 | page=119 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=7UgQAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22An+armorial+bear+once+nearly+caused+war+between+Appenzell+and+St.+Gallen+%28Switzerland%29+in+1578.%22&amp;dq=%22An+armorial+bear+once+nearly+caused+war+between+Appenzell+and+St.+Gallen+%28Switzerland%29+in+1578.%22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Americas===
Figures of [[Kokopelli]] and [[Itzamna]] (as the Mayan tonsured maize god) in [[Pre-Columbian America]] often include phallic content. Additionally, over forty large monolithic sculptures (''Xkeptunich'') have been documented from Terminal Classic Maya sites with the majority of examples occurring in the Puuc region of Yucatán (Amrhein 2001). Uxmal has the largest collection with eleven sculptures now housed under a protective roof on site. The largest sculpture was recorded at Almuchil measuring more than 320&amp;nbsp;cm high with a diameter at the base of the shaft measuring 44&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref&gt;Amrhein, Laura Marie (2001). An Iconographic and Historic Analysis of Terminal Classic Maya Phallic Imagery. Unpublished PhD dissertation, Richmond: [[Virginia Commonwealth University]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative sects===

[[St. Priapus Church]] (French: ''Église S. Priape'') is a North American new religion that centres on the worship of the phallus.  Founded in the 1980s in Montreal, Quebec, by D. F. Cassidy, it has a following mainly among homosexual men in Canada and the United States.  Semen is also treated with reverence and its consumption is an act of worship.&lt;ref&gt;J. Gordon Melton (1996, 5th ed.). Encyclopedia of American Religions (Detroit, Mich.: Gale) {{ISBN|0-8103-7714-4}} p. 952.&lt;/ref&gt; Semen is esteemed as sacred because of its divine life-giving power.

==Psychoanalysis==
[[File:Phallic-Head Plate, 1536 .jpg|170px|thumb|Phallic-Head Plate, [[Gubbio, Italy]], 1536]]
The symbolic version of the phallus, a phallic symbol is meant to represent male generative powers. According to [[Sigmund Freud]]'s theory of [[psychoanalysis]], while males possess a penis, no one can possess the symbolic phallus. [[Jacques Lacan]]'s ''Ecrits: A Selection'' includes an essay titled ''The Signification of the Phallus'' in which sexual differentiation is represented in terms of the difference between "being" and "having" the phallus, which for Lacan is the transcendent signifier of desire. Men are positioned as men insofar as they wish to ''have'' the phallus. Women, on the other hand, wish to ''be'' the phallus.  This difference between having and being explains some tragicomic aspects of sexual life.  Once a woman becomes, in the realm of the signifier, the phallus the man wants, he ceases to want it, because one cannot desire what one has, and the man may be drawn to other women. Similarly, though, for the woman, the gift of the phallus deprives the man of what he has, and thereby diminishes her desire. 

In ''Gender Trouble'', [[Judith Butler]] explores Freud's and Lacan's discussions of the symbolic phallus by pointing out the connection between the phallus and the penis. She writes, "The law requires conformity to its own notion of 'nature'. It gains its legitimacy through the binary and asymmetrical naturalization of bodies in which the phallus, though clearly not identical to the penis, deploys the penis as its naturalized instrument and sign". In ''Bodies that Matter'', she further explores the possibilities for the phallus in her discussion of ''The Lesbian Phallus''. If, as she notes, Freud enumerates a set of analogies and substitutions that rhetorically affirm the fundamental transferability of the phallus from the penis elsewhere, then any number of other things might come to stand in for the phallus.

==Modern use of the phallus==
The phallus is often used to advertise [[pornography]], as well as the sale of [[contraception]]. It has often been used in provocative practical jokes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=525595|title=Yale Band Punished for Half-Time Show|work=The Harvard Crimson|accessdate=2008-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been the central focus of adult-audience performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2002/11/01/DD88346.DTL|title=Puppetry of the Penis|work=San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=2008-12-01 | first=Robert | last=Hurwitt|date=2002-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phallus had a new set of art interpretations in the 20th century with the rise of [[Sigmund Freud]], the founder of modern [[psychoanalysis]] of [[psychology]].  One example is "[[Princess X]]"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/51035.html Philamuseum.org]&lt;/ref&gt; by the Romanian modernist sculptor [[Constantin Brâncuși]]. He created a scandal in the Salon in 1919 when he represented or caricatured  [[Princess Marie Bonaparte]] as a large gleaming bronze phallus. This phallus likely symbolizes Bonaparte's obsession with the penis and her lifelong quest to achieve vaginal orgasm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=[[Mary Roach]] | title=[[Bonk: The Curious Coupling of Science and Sex]] | publisher=W. W. Norton and Co, New York (2008)}} page 66f, page 73&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The Philippine Tobacco Institute has been curbing the Philippine government's efforts to implement tobacco regulation. Since 2007, eleven [[legal case]]s have been filed by the tobacco industry against proposed [[Regulation|government oversight]]; the courts have ruled in the industry's favor in all of these cases.&lt;ref name="visconti"&gt;{{cite news | last =Visconti | first =Catherine | title =Tobacco firms win legal battles in PH | publisher = [[Rappler]] | date = 27 October 2012 | url =http://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/14926-tobacco-firms-win-legal-battles-in-the-philippines | accessdate = 11 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the Philippine Tobacco Institute blocked the FDA's intent to gain control over the quality control of tobacco products in the country.&lt;ref name="visconti"/&gt;

The Philippine Tobacco Institute has expressed its opinion on [[tobacco control]] when it submitted a position paper to the [[World Health Organization]] during the proposal for the [[WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control]] in 2000.&lt;ref name="pti"/&gt;

The PTI has also lobbied for the [[Bureau of Internal Revenue (Philippines)|Bureau of Internal Revenue]] to reject a tax stamp system for cigarette packs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author =[[The Philippine Star]] | title =Tobacco industry scores costly Sicpa tax stamp scheme | publisher =[[ABS-CBN]] | date = 17 April 2010 | url =http://news.abs-cbn.com/business/04/17/10/tobacco-industry-scores-costly-sicpa-tax-stamp-scheme | accessdate = 12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and successfully reduced the size of graphic warning labels on cigarette packages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = ABS-CBN News | title ='Watered-down' tobacco warning bill hit | publisher = [[ABS-CBN]] | date = 10 June 2014 | url =http://news.abs-cbn.com/lifestyle/06/10/14/watered-down-tobacco-warning-bill-hit | accessdate = 12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Plan Colombia''' was the name of a [[United States]] [[aid|foreign aid]], [[military aid|military]] and diplomatic initiative aimed at combating Colombian [[drug cartel]]s and [[left-wing]] [[insurgent]] groups in [[Colombia]]. The plan was originally conceived in 1999 by the administrations of Colombian [[President]] [[Andrés Pastrana Arango|Andrés Pastrana]] and US President [[Bill Clinton]], and signed into law by the U.S in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/story?id=82756&amp;page=1|title=Clinton Announces $1.3B in Aid to Colombia|first=A. B. C.|last=News|date=6 January 2006|website=ABC News|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official objectives of Plan Colombia were to end the [[Colombian armed conflict]] by increasing funding and training of Colombian military and para-military forces and creating an anti-[[cocaine]] strategy to eradicate coca cultivation, though critics claim this largely served as a cover to increase U.S. military presence and protect U.S. corporate interests in the region. Plan Colombia in its initial form existed until 2015, with the United States and the Colombian government seeking a new strategy as a result of the peace talks between the Colombian government and the [[FARC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.elheraldo.co/nacional/el-plan-colombia-termina-una-fase-y-comienza-otra-santos-241516|title=El Plan Colombia termina una fase y comienza otra: Santos|author=|date=|website=elheraldo.co|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new program is called "Peace Colombia" (Paz Colombia) and seeks to provide Colombia with aid after the implementation of the [[Colombian peace process|Peace Agreement]] in 2017 with the [[FARC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-colombia-idUSKCN0VD2XM|title=Obama pledges more than $450 million aid to help Colombia peace plan|first=Roberta|last=Rampton|date=|website=reuters.com|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there remain several U.S. military bases and close to 1,000 U.S. Marines in Colombia who have yet to withdraw from the country in accordance with the new peace agreement, and show little indication of doing so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.celag.org/impactos-del-plan-colombia-otro-exito-made-in-america/|title=Impactos del Plan Colombia: otro éxito made in América — CELAG|author=|date=19 July 2017|website=celag.org|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pastrana had first proposed the idea of a possible "[[Marshall Plan]] for Colombia" during a speech at Bogotá's Tequendama Hotel on June 8, 1998, nearly a week after the first round of that year's presidential elections. Pastrana argued that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[Drug crops are] a social problem whose solution must pass through the solution to the armed conflict...Developed countries should help us to implement some sort of 'Marshall Plan' for Colombia, which will allow us to develop great investments in the social field, in order to offer our peasants different alternatives to the illicit crops.&lt;ref name="pastrana"&gt;{{cite book | first =Andrés | last =Pastrana | authorlink = |author2=Camilo Gómez | title = La Palabra bajo Fuego | publisher = Editorial Planeta Colombiana S.A. | location =Bogotá | year=2005 | pages= 48–51 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After Pastrana was inaugurated, one of the names given to the initiative at this early stage was "Plan for Colombia's Peace", which President Pastrana defined as "a set of alternative development projects which will channel the shared efforts of multilateral organizations and [foreign] governments towards Colombian society".&lt;ref name="pastrana" /&gt; Pastrana's Plan Colombia, as originally presented, did not focus on drug trafficking, military aid, or fumigation,&lt;ref name="living"&gt;{{cite book | author = Grace Livingstone | year =2004 | title =Inside Colombia: Drugs, Democracy, and War | pages = 123–130

During an August 3, 1998 meeting, President Pastrana and U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] discussed the possibility of "securing an increase in U.S. aid for counternarcotics projects, sustainable economic development, the protection of human rights, humanitarian aid, stimulating private investment, and joining other donors and international financial institutions to promote Colombia's economic growth". Diplomatic contacts regarding this subject continued during the rest of the year and into 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Pastrana, p. 115–116; 120–122&lt;/ref&gt;

For President Pastrana, it became necessary to create an official document that specifically "served to convene important U.S. aid, as well as that of other countries and international organizations" by adequately addressing US concerns. The Colombian government also considered that it had to patch up a bilateral relationship that had heavily deteriorated during the previous administration of President [[Ernesto Samper Pizano|Ernesto Samper]] (1994–1998). According to Pastrana, Under Secretary of State [[Thomas R. Pickering]] eventually suggested that, initially, the U.S. could be able to commit to providing aid over a three-year period, as opposed to continuing with separate yearly packages.&lt;ref&gt;Pastrana, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of these contacts, US input was extensive, and meant that Plan Colombia's first formal draft was originally written in English, not Spanish, and a Spanish version was not available until "months after a revised English version was already in place".&lt;ref name="last"&gt;{{cite book

Critics and observers have referred to the differences between the earliest versions of Plan Colombia and later drafts. Originally, the focus was on achieving peace and ending violence, within the context of the ongoing peace talks that Pastrana's government was then holding with the [[FARC]] guerrillas, following the principle that the country's violence had "deep roots in the economic exclusion and...inequality and poverty".

The final version of Plan Colombia was seen as considerably different, since its main focuses would deal with drug trafficking and strengthening the military.&lt;ref name="last" /&gt; When this final version was debated on the U.S. Senate floor, [[Joseph Biden]] spoke as a leading advocate of the more hardline strategy.&lt;ref&gt;http://ciponline.org/colombia/062110.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Ambassador Robert White stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If you read the original Plan Colombia, not the one that was written in Washington but the original Plan Colombia, there's no mention of military drives against the FARC rebels. Quite the contrary. (President Pastrana) says the FARC is part of the history of Colombia and a historical phenomenon, he says, and they must be treated as Colombians...[Colombians] come and ask for bread and you (America) give them stones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= DrugSense | work= Ottawa Citizen| url=http://www.mapinc.org/drugnews/v00/n1323/a08.html?152 | accessdate=February 23, 2006}} White is the president of the Center for International Policy and former American ambassador to Paraguay and El Salvador, and former No. 2 man with the U.S. Embassy in Bogotá.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the final U.S. aid package, 78.12 percent of the funds for 2000 went to the Colombian military and police for counternarcotics and military operations. ''(See graph, below)''

President Pastrana admitted that most of the resulting US aid to Colombia was overwhelmingly focused on the military and on counternarcotics (68%), but argued that this was only some 17% of the total amount of estimated Plan Colombia aid. The rest, focusing mostly on social development, would be provided by international organizations, Europe, Japan, Canada, Latin America, and Colombia itself. In light of this, Pastrana considered that the Plan had been unfairly labeled as "militarist" by national and international critics that focused only on the US contribution.&lt;ref&gt;Pastrana, p. 256-257&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;This original plan called for a budget of US$7.5 billion, with 51% dedicated to institutional and social development, 32% for fighting the [[Illegal drug trade|drug trade]], 16% for economic and social revitalization, and 0.8% to support the then on-going effort to negotiate a political solution to the state's conflict with insurgent [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] groups. Pastrana initially pledged US$4.864 billion of Colombian resources (65% of the total) and called on the international community to provide the remaining US$2.636 billion (35%).&lt;ref name="embassy"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of this funding was earmarked for training and equipping new Colombian army counternarcotics battalions, providing them with helicopters, transport and intelligence assistance, and supplies for coca eradication.

In 2000, the [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] administration in the [[United States]] supported the initiative by committing $1.3 billion in [[foreign aid]] and up to five hundred [[military]] personnel to train local forces. An additional three hundred [[civilian]] personnel were allowed to assist in the eradication of coca. This aid was an addition to US$330 million of previously approved US aid to Colombia. US$818 million was earmarked for 2000, with US$256 million for 2001. These appropriations for the plan made Colombia the third largest recipient of foreign aid from the [[United States]] at the time, behind only Israel and Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.americasquarterly.org/node/3787|title=Plan Colombia: A Retrospective|website=www.americasquarterly.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under President George W. Bush, aid to Colombia earmarked for military aid vs. humanitarian aid became more balanced. Ultimately, the U.S. would provide approximately US$10 billion under Plan Colombia through 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Otis|first=John|date=November 2014|title=The FARC and Colombia’s Illegal Drug Trade|url=https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/Otis_FARCDrugTrade2014.pdf|journal=Wilson Center|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Colombia sought additional support from the [[European Union]] and other countries, with the intention of financing the mostly social component of the original plan. Some would-be donors were reluctant to cooperate, as they considered that the US-approved aid represented an undue military slant, and additionally lacked the will to spend such amounts of money for what they considered an uncertain initiative.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Initially, some of these countries donated approximately US $128.6 million (in one year), which was 2.3% of the resulting total. Larger amounts, in some instances up to several hundred million dollars, were also donated to Colombia and continued to be provided either directly or through loans and access to credit lines, but technically fell outside the framework of Plan Colombia.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, the sums raised fell well short of what was originally called for. In addition, Colombia's eventual contribution was less than planned due in part to a 1999–2001 economic crisis.

== War on Drugs ==
{{Main|War on Drugs}}In the United States, Plan Colombia is seen as part of the "[[War on Drugs]]", which was started under [[Richard Nixon|President Nixon]] in 1971. Plan Colombia has numerous supporters in the United States Congress. Congressional supporters assert that over 1,300 square kilometers of mature coca were sprayed and eradicated in Colombia in 2003, which would have prevented the production of over 500 metric tons of cocaine, stating that it eliminated upward of $100 million of the illicit income that supports drug dealers and different illegal organizations considered terrorist in Colombia, the U.S. and the [[European Union]].

According to a 2006 U.S. congressional report on U.S. enterprises that had signed contracts to carry out anti-narcotics activities as part of Plan Colombia, [[DynCorp]], the largest private company involved, was among those contracted by the State Department, while others signed contracts with the Defense Department.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.colectivodeabogados.org/article.php3?id_article=1253 Private Security Transnational Enterprises in Colombia]'' [[José Alvear Restrepo Lawyers' Collective]] February, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expansion Under Bush ==
As enacted in 2000, Plan Colombia called for two U.S. supported actions in Colombia. The first was to cause the “eradication, interdiction, and alternative development”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/strengthen-international-partnerships|title=Strengthen International Partnerships|last=|first=|date=|website=The White House|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; of coca fields which are used to produce cocaine—which in turn provided most of the funding for the FARC. And second, to offer social and economic assistance to the rural areas that the FARC have controlled for half a century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A third more security oriented countermeasure—to provide enhanced intelligence, training and supplies to Colombian armed forces against the FARC—took greater importance post [[September 11 attacks|9/11]] under the Andean Regional Initiative, as the threat of global [[War on Terror|terrorism]] received increased attention. The [[Andean Counterdrug Initiative|Andean Regional Initiative]] initially appropriated $676 million to South American countries, with approximately $380 million targeted at Colombia. The 2001 initiative reduced the limitations on the numbers and the activities of civilian contractors, allowing them to carry and use military weapons which, according to the U.S. government, would be necessary to ensure the safety of personnel and equipment during spray missions. The United States Congress rejected amendments to the Andean initiative that would have redirected some of the money to demand reduction programs in the United States, primarily through funding of drug treatment services. Some critics have opposed the rejection of these modifications, claiming that the drug problem and its multiple repercussions would be structurally addressed by curbing the demand, and not the production, of illicit drugs, since drug crops can always be regrown and transplanted elsewhere, inside or outside Colombia and its neighboring countries, as long as there is a commercially viable market.

In 2004, the United States appropriated approximately $727 million for the Andean Counterdrug Initiative, $463 million of which was targeted at Colombia.

In October 2004, the compromise version of two U.S. House–Senate bills was approved, increasing the number of U.S. military advisors that operate in the country as part of Plan Colombia to 800 (from 400) and that of private contractors to 600 (from 400).&lt;ref name="CIP3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ciponline.org/colombia/041008cap.htm|title=Congress Doubles the Limit on U.S. Troops in Colombia|author=Adam Isacson|date=October 8, 2004|work=HTML|publisher=The Center for International Policy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060204210249/http://ciponline.org/colombia/041008cap.htm|archivedate=February 4, 2006|accessdate=April 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a November 22, 2004 visit to [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]], President Bush stood by Colombian president Uribe's security policies and declared his support for continuing to provide Plan Colombia aid in the future. Bush claimed the initiative enjoys "wide bipartisan support" in the US and in the coming year he would ask Congress to renew its support.&lt;ref name="state"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usinfo.state.gov/gi/Archive/2004/Nov/23-231491.html|title=Bush, Uribe Applaud Strength of U.S.-Colombia Partnership|author=|date=November 22, 2004|work=|publisher=US Department of State|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060824153938/http://usinfo.state.gov/gi/Archive/2004/Nov/23-231491.html|archivedate=August 24, 2006|deadurl=yes|accessdate=April 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taken together then, the three countermeasures represent what President [[George W. Bush]] referred to as his “three-legged stool” strategy of “waging a global war on terror, supporting democracy and reducing the flow of illicit drugs into the United States.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/homeland/progress/full.html|title=Progress Report on the Global War on Terrorism|website=georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Plan Colombia includes components which address social aid and institutional reform, the initiative has come to be regarded by its critics as fundamentally a program of counternarcotics and military aid for the Colombian government.

===Research studies===
The US Defense Department funded a two-year study which found that the use of the armed forces to interdict drugs coming into the United States would have minimal or no effect on cocaine traffic and might, in fact, raise the profits of cocaine cartels and manufacturers. The 175-page study, "Sealing the Borders: The Effects of Increased Military Participation in Drug Interdiction," was prepared by seven economists, mathematicians and researchers at the National Defense Research Institute, a branch of the [[RAND Corporation]] and released in 1988. The study noted that seven previous studies in the past nine years, including ones by the Center or Naval Research and the Office of Technology Assessment, had come to similar conclusions. Interdiction efforts, using current armed forces resources, would have almost no effect on cocaine importation into the United States, the report concluded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

During the early to mid-1990s, the Clinton administration ordered and funded a major cocaine policy study again by RAND. The Rand Drug Policy Research Center study concluded that $3 billion should be switched from federal and local law enforcement to treatment. The report said that treatment is the cheapest way to cut drug use. President Clinton's [[Office of National Drug Control Policy|Director of National Drug Control Policy]] rejected slashing law enforcement spending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Plan Colombia itself didn't exist at the time of the second RAND study, but the U.S. aid package has been criticized as a manifestation of the predominant law enforcement approach to the drug trade as a whole.

Critics of Plan Colombia, such as authors Doug Stokes and Francisco Ramirez Cuellar, argue that the main intent of the program is not drug eradication but to fight leftist guerrillas. They argue that these Colombian peasants are also a target because they are calling for social reform and hindering international plans to exploit Colombia's valuable resources, including oil and other natural resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stokes, Doug |title=America's Other War: Terrorizing Colombia |url=http://bailey83221.livejournal.com/54324.html |publisher=Zed Books |year=2005 |isbn=1-84277-547-2 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160109132325/http://bailey83221.livejournal.com/54324.html |archivedate=2016-01-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author= Cuellar, Francisco Ramirez| title= The Profits of Extermination: How U.S. Corporate Power is Destroying Colombia | publisher= Common Courage Press| year=2005 | isbn=1-56751-322-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2004, Colombia is the fifteenth largest supplier of oil to the United States&lt;ref name="EIA"&gt;{{Cite web

As a result, counternarcotics assistance and equipment should also be available for use against any of these irregular armed groups when necessary.&lt;ref name = "Bogota2"&gt;{{cite web

===Human rights conditions===
In June 2000, [[Amnesty International]] issued a press release in which it criticized the implemented Plan Colombia initiative:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Plan Colombia is based on a drug-focused analysis of the roots of the conflict and the human rights crisis which completely ignores the Colombian state's own historical and current responsibility. It also ignores deep-rooted causes of the conflict and the human rights crisis. The Plan proposes a principally military strategy (in the US component of Plan Colombia) to tackle illicit drug cultivation and trafficking through substantial military assistance to the Colombian armed forces and police. Social development and humanitarian assistance programs included in the Plan cannot disguise its essentially military character. Furthermore, it is apparent that Plan Colombia is not the result of a genuine process of consultation either with the national and international non-governmental organizations which are expected to implement the projects nor with the beneficiaries of the humanitarian, human rights or social development projects. As a consequence, the human rights component of Plan Colombia is seriously flawed.&lt;ref name=" "&gt;{{cite web

During the late 1990s, Colombia was the leading recipient of US military aid in the Western Hemisphere, and due to its continuing internal conflict has the worst [[human rights]] record, with the majority of atrocities attributed (from most directly responsible to least directly responsible) to [[paramilitary]] forces, [[Insurgency|insurgent]] guerrilla groups and elements within the police and armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/laplaza/2008/08/colombia-milita.html|title=Colombia military atrocities prompt criticism of Plan Colombia|publisher=|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[United Nations]] study reported that elements within the Colombian security forces, which have been strengthened due to Plan Colombia and U.S. aid, do continue to maintain intimate relationships with right-wing [[death squad]]s, help organize paramilitary forces, and either participate in abuses and massacres directly or, as it is usually argued to be more often the case, deliberately fail to take action to prevent them. One of the larger examples of this behavior was the 2008 False Positives Scandal, in which the Colombian military murdered approximately 1,400 innocent civilians in order to make false claims that these cadavers were Farc soldiers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Critics of the Plan and of other initiatives to aid Colombian armed forces point to these continuing accusations of serious abuse, and argue that the Colombian state and military should sever any persisting relationship with these illegal forces and need to prosecute past offenses by paramilitary forces or its own personnel. Supporters of the Plan assert that the number and scale of abuses directly attributable to the government's forces have been slowly but increasingly reduced.

Some paramilitary commanders openly expressed their support for Plan Colombia. In May 2000, paramilitary commander "Yair" from the Putumayo Southern Bloc, himself a former Colombian special forces sergeant, said that the [[United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia|AUC]] supported the plan and he offered to assist U.S.-trained counternarcotics battalions in their operations against the [[FARC]] in the coca-growing [[Putumayo department]]. Paramilitaries and FARC fought it out in the region one month before a Plan Colombia mandated military offensive began later that year. AUC fighters would have passed through checkpoints manned by the army's 24th Brigade in the area during the fighting.&lt;ref name = "para"&gt;{{Cite journal

====SOA and human rights====
According to Grace Livingstone, more Colombian [[School of the Americas]] (SOA) graduates have been implicated in human rights abuses than SOA graduates from any other country. All of the commanders of the brigades highlighted in the 2001 Human Rights Watch report were graduates of the SOA, including the III brigade in Valle del Cauca, where the 2001 [[Paramilitarism in Colombia#The Alto Naya massacre|Alto Naya Massacre]] occurred. US-trained officers have been accused of being directly or indirectly involved in many atrocities during the 1990s, including the [[Massacre of Trujillo]] and the 1997 [[Mapiripán Massacre]].&lt;ref name = "SOA"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Livingstone, p. 169&lt;br&gt;School of the America's Watch www.soaw.org &lt;br&gt;Livingstone notes: ''The relatively high number of Colombian officers is partly due to the fact that more research has been done into the names of abusers in Colombia, whereas the names of officers who committed offenses in other countries—particularly in Central America—are not known.''&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Livingstone also argues that the Colombian paramilitaries employ counter insurgency methods that US military schools and manuals have been teaching Latin American officers in Colombia and in the region at large since the 1960s, and that these manuals teach students to target civilian supporters of the guerrillas, because without such support the guerrillas cannot survive.&lt;ref&gt;Livingstone, p. 171&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pastrana administration replied to critics by stating that it had publicly denounced military-paramilitary links, as well as increased efforts against paramilitaries and acted against questionable military personnel. President Pastrana argues that he implemented new training courses on human rights and on international law for military and police officers, as well as new reforms to limit the jurisdiction of military courts in cases of grave human rights abuses such as torture, genocide or forced disappearances.&lt;ref name="P"&gt;Pastrana, pp. 87–88; 351–353&lt;/ref&gt;

Pastrana claims that some 1300 paramilitaries were killed, captured or surrendered during his term, and that hundreds of members of the armed forces, including up to a hundred officers, were dismissed due to the existence of what it considered as sufficient allegations of involvement in abuses or suspected paramilitary activities, in use of a new presidential discretional faculty.&lt;ref name="P" /&gt; These would include some 388 discharges in 2000 and a further 70 in 2001. Human Rights Watch recognized these events, but questioned the fact that the reasons for such discharges were not always made clear nor followed by formal prosecutions, and claimed that Pastrana's administration cut funds for the Attorney General's Human Rights Unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= "Sixth Division" Fast Facts | work= Human Rights Watch | url=https://www.hrw.org/campaigns/colombia/action/factsheet.htm | accessdate=April 9, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060401200858/http://www.hrw.org/campaigns/colombia/action/factsheet.htm |archivedate = April 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Leahy Provision====
{{Main|Leahy Law}}

In 1997 the US Congress approved an Amendment to the [[Foreign Operations Appropriations Act]] which banned the US from giving anti-narcotics aid to any foreign military unit whose members have violated human rights. The Amendment was called the "Leahy Provision" or "[[Leahy Law]]" (named after Senator [[Patrick Leahy]] who proposed it). Partially due to this measure and the reasoning behind it, anti-narcotics aid was initially only provided to Police units, and not to the military during much of the 1990s.

According to author Grace Livingstone and other critics, the problem is there have been very few military units free of members that have not been implicated in any kind of human rights abuses at all, so they consider that the policy has been usually ignored, downplayed or occasionally implemented in a patchy way.&lt;ref&gt;Livingstone, p. 168-169&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, Human Rights Watch, together with several Colombian human rights investigators, published a study in which it concluded that half of Colombia's eighteen brigade-level army units had extensive links to paramilitaries at the time, citing numerous cases which directly or indirectly implicated army personnel.&lt;ref name="Stokes"&gt;Stokes, Doug {{cite web

The State Department certified that Colombia would have complied with one of the human rights conditions (Sec. 3201) attached to Plan Colombia aid, due to President Pastrana's directing "in writing that Colombian Armed Forces personnel who are credibly alleged to have committed gross violations of human rights will be brought to justice in Colombia's civilian courts...". In August 2000 President Clinton used his presidential waiver to override the remaining human rights conditions, on the grounds that it was necessary for the interests of U.S. national security. Livingstone argues that if the US government funds military units guilty of human rights abuses, it is acting illegally.&lt;ref name="Stokes" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Bogota"&gt;{{cite web

===Aerial Eradication strategy and criticisms{{anchor|Fumigation strategy and criticisms}}===
Aerial eradication (often incorrectly called "fumigation") began as a part of Plan Colombia backed by the United States government as a strategy to eliminate drug crops in Colombia in the 1980s. By the mid-1990s, drug cultivation had increased and Colombia supplied as much as 90% of the world’s cocaine,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rochlin|first=Jim|date=April 2011|title=Plan Colombia and the revolution in military affairs: the demise of the FARC|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/review-of-international-studies/article/plan-colombia-and-the-revolution-in-military-affairs-the-demise-of-the-farc/F2716414E725761FBD0882776EF2F75B|journal=Review of International Studies|language=en|volume=37|issue=2|pages=715–740|doi=10.1017/S0260210510000914|issn=1469-9044}}&lt;/ref&gt; which caused aerial eradication efforts to become more intensified. United States policymakers put the intensive use of the herbicide [[Roundup (herbicide)|Roundup Ultra]] made by [[Monsanto]] for massive aerial spraying of illicit crops in Colombia as the central strategy for Plan Colombia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corpwatch.org/article.php?id=669 Toxic Drift: Monsanto and the Drug War in Colombia]. Byy Jeremy Bigwood. ''CorpWatch'', June 21, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2000 and 2003, the aerial eradication program sprayed over 380,000 hectares of coca, which is equivalent to more than 8% of Colombia's arable land. The spraying was carried out by a police unit known as the Colombian Antinarcotics Directorate (DIRAN) and by 2003, twenty-four aircraft were conducting eradication. The aircraft were also accompanied by armed helicopters to protect them from potential ground fire that could come from the FARC or other armed groups active in the drug cultivation areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cipcol.org/?p=36 |title=Fumigation compensation? Forget it (archived copy) |accessdate=2012-02-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111218104723/http://www.cipcol.org/?p=36 |archivedate=2011-12-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The forced eradication of illicit crops with aerial spraying has been questioned for failing to reduce supply as well as having a negative social impact and causing environmental damage. According to the Transnational Institute, "the fact that an increasing crop area is being eradicated – much more was sprayed in 2003 than in 2002 – should be interpreted not as a sign of the policy's success, but as a sign of its failure, because it indicates that more and more land is being planted in these crops."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tni.org/archives/drugscolombia-docs_plan-e|title=Transnational Institute – Plan Colombia's Aerial Spraying. A Failure Foretold|publisher=|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Joshua Davis of Wired.com, the area has seen the emergence of a Roundup resistant variety of the coca plant known as "[[Boliviana negra|Boliviana Negra]]" that is not talked about because it might "put an end to American aid money."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=The Mystery of the Coca Plant That Wouldn't Die| url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.11/columbia.html | work=Wired}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scandal behind the aerial eradication strategy in Colombia raises many issues. One point is the most important of whether or not it has been successful. In 2004, according to Robert Charles, assistant secretary of state for the INL, aerial eradication efforts were getting close to the point that continued suppression of the drug crops would convince growers that continued cultivation will be futile. However, statistics show that sharp reductions in growing caused by fumigation in 2002–2003 did not reduce cultivation levels back to their numbers in 1998, and on top of that, Colombia still remains the largest coca-growing country in the world. Another reason to remain skeptical of the success of this program is the "balloon effect". This means that when aerial eradication halted drug cultivation in one area, it would simply appear in another area, which would in turn reverse the intended effects of fumigation. As a result, coca farming has spread throughout Colombia, and the Colombian government even reported that between 1999 and 2002, the number of provinces where coca was being grown rose from twelve to twenty-two. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) also presented research on coca cultivation in Colombia which showed this crop's high degree of mobility and its increases of cultivation in ten provinces. For example, in the province Guaviare, coca cultivation moved south toward Caquetá and Putumayo as a result of aerial eradication in the 1990s, and thus cultivation rose 55 percent.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Another issue raised by aerial eradication is rights violations as aerial eradication destroys one of the few economic options for a number of peasants and causes forced displacement because peasants have to find a new place to grow their crops.

One notable aspect in discussion of the aerial spraying of illicit crops in Colombia is the size of the areas sprayed. Forty thousand hectares are said to have been sprayed in a single department, Putumayo. Nationwide in 2003, chemicals were sprayed on 139,000 hectares, 17,000 people were displaced as a result of aerial eradication, and their income and food supply were threatened. Even in a general standpoint, Colombia's Council for Human Rights and Displacement showed that in 2001 and 2002, aerial eradication left 75,000 people nationwide displaced. It is not easy to picture such a broad area covered by grey clouds of glyphosate sprayed from airplanes, or the desolate image of destruction left behind. One need not be a harsh critic of aerial spraying to admit that spraying such an extensive area with this chemical must have some impact. Those are the effects that the residents, fauna and flora of the extensive affected regions of Colombia have been suffering for years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://colombiajournal.org/colombia60.htm "Death Falls from the Sky"] ''Colombia Journal''&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, spraying is shown to have effects on health. Many residents of spray zones have shown to have a variety of skin, respiratory, and other ailments. The scandal regarding health violations arises because the U.S. State department constantly downplays these concerns. They claim instead that illness arises as a result of the herbicides they use for their crop cultivation. Also, the EPA provided the State Department with the assessments of health and environment impacts of aerial eradication, but these assessments were conducted without any information specific to the local environment of Colombia. The State Department does not even submit enough information to the EPA on how spraying is actually carried out. In terms of environmental effects, because of the "balloon effect", farmers end up moving their crop cultivation into forests and national parks. As a result, there has been deforestation, pollution of soil and waterways, and even increased risk of extinction for Colombian bird and plant species.&lt;ref&gt;Lemus, Maria C., Kimberly Stanton and John Walsh. "Colombia: A Vicious Cycle of Drugs and War." ''Drugs and Democracy in Latin America.'' Ed. Rosin, Eileen and Coletta Youngers. Boulder: Lynne Rienner Publishers, Inc. 2005. 112–120.&lt;/ref&gt;
Aside from these specific issues, there are also others raised about the costs of fumigation and if it is using too much money.

This intensive program to eradicate crops with aerial spraying is the backbone of the bilateral anti-drug partnership between Colombia and United States.

====Proposed use of mycoherbicides====
In 1999, the U.S. Congress added a provision to its Plan Colombia aid package that called for the employment of mycoherbicides against coca and opium crops. The potential use of ''[[Fusarium oxysporum]]'' as part of these efforts was questioned and opposed by environmentalists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://motherjones.com/environment/2000/05/drug-control-or-biowarfare Drug Control or Biowarfare?]. Mother Jones. May 2nd 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "HoustonChronicle2007"&gt;[http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/chronicle/4478320.html A controversial weapon in the war against drugs] ''Houston Chronicle''. January 18, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Colombia rejected the proposal and the Clinton administration waived the provision in light of continued criticism.&lt;ref name = "HoustonChronicle2007" /&gt;

==Military programs==
Compared to the counternarcotics measures, the military campaign waged against the FARC and other paramilitaries appears to have achieved more success. Military aid packages that were both part of, and separate from, Plan Colombia have successfully driven the FARC out of most of their former territory and targeted the leaders of the insurgency, killing over two dozen of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/investigative/2013/12/21/covert-action-in-colombia/|title=Covert Action in Colombia|last=Priest|first=Dana|date=December 21, 2013|website=Washington Post|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. has largely remained in a non-combatant role, providing real time intelligence, training, and military equipment. 

As the Colombian military (with U.S. support) continues to crack down on the FARC during the mid-2000s, the insurgency was sapped of much of their military might. Traditionally, the FARC has operated with a centralized, hierarchical command structure and a governing body called the Secretariat. With the deaths in 2008 of main leader Manuel Marulanda and second-in-command Raúl Reyes, followed by the killing of top tacticians Mono Jojoy and Alfonso Cano in 2010 and 2011, the group  became increasingly disjointed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morehouse|first=Matthew|date=2014-06-09|title=It's Easier to Decapitate a Snake than It Is a Hydra: An Analysis of Colombia's Targeted Killing Program|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2Fabs%2F10.1080%2F1057610X.2014.913118|journal=Studies in Conflict &amp; Terrorism|language=en|volume=37|issue=7|pages=541–566|doi=10.1080/1057610x.2014.913118|issn=1057-610X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, for example, the FARC had over 18,000 fighters, but that figure fell to under 7,000 by 2014 mainly as a result of fighters abandoning the cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/news/archive/2016/07/farc-cocaine-colombia/489551/|title=Who Will Control Colombia's Cocaine Without FARC?|last=Phippen|first=J.

As a result, FARC attacks in Colombia have declined significantly. Bombings on Occidental Petroleum's Caño Limón pipeline—a frequent target of the FARC—for instance, reached 178 separate incidents in 2001 compared to just 57 in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=June 2008|title=Colombia: The FARC's Low-Level Pipeline Campaign|url=https://www.stratfor.com/analysis/colombia-farcs-low-level-pipeline-campaign|journal=Stratfor|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even as the FARC have lost power and subsequently signed a peace agreement, there is concern about what will happen to the remnants of the group. One fear is that autonomous fronts will forge their own relationships with the cartels and continue the drug trade in a more dispersed manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/news/archive/2016/07/farc-cocaine-colombia/489551/|title=Who Will Control Colombia's Cocaine Without FARC?|last=Phippen|first=J.

===U.S. 2005 estimate===
On April 14, 2006, the U.S. Drug Czar's office announced that its Colombian coca cultivation estimate for 2005 was significantly greater than that of any year since 2002.&lt;ref name = "est"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The press release from the U.S. Office of National Drug Control Policy stated that "coca cultivation declined by 8 percent, from 114,100 to 105,400 hectares, when those areas surveyed by the US government in 2004 were compared with the same areas in 2005". However, "the survey also found 144,000 hectares of coca under cultivation in 2005 in a search area that was 81 percent larger than that used in 2004...newly imaged areas show about 39,000 additional hectares of coca. Because these areas were not previously surveyed, it is impossible to determine for how long they have been under coca cultivation."&lt;ref name = "est" /&gt;

Critics of Plan Colombia and of ongoing fumigation programs considered this new information as a sign of the failure of current U.S. drug policy. The [[Center for International Policy]] stated that "even if we accept the U.S. government's argument that the high 2005 estimate owes to measurement in new areas, it is impossible to claim that Plan Colombia has brought a 50 percent reduction in coca-growing in six years...Either Colombia has returned to [the 2002] level of cultivation, or the 'reductions' reported in 2002 and 2003 were false due to poor measurement."&lt;ref name = "CIP2"&gt;{{cite web

===UN 2005 estimate===
On June 20, 2006, the [[United Nations]] (UN) Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) presented its own survey on Andean coca cultivation, reporting a smaller increase of about 8% and confirming a rising trend shown by the earlier U.S. findings.&lt;ref name = "UNexecSum"&gt;{{cite web

UNODC concluded that "substantial international assistance" is needed by Colombia and the other Andean countries "so they can provide poor coca farmers with sustainable alternative livelihoods" and that "aid efforts need to be multiplied at least tenfold in order to reach all impoverished farmers who need support".&lt;ref name = "UNest" /&gt;

===Analysis===
The results of Plan Colombia have been mixed. From the perspective of the U.S. and Colombian governments, the results of Plan Colombia have been positive. U.S. government statistics show that a significant reduction in leftover coca (total cultivation minus eradicated coca) has been observed from peak 2001 levels of 1,698 square kilometers to an estimated 1,140 square kilometers in 2004. It is said that a record high aerial herbicide fumigation campaign of 1,366 square kilometers in 2004 has reduced the total area of surviving coca, even as newer areas are planted.
Despite this, effective reductions may appear to have reached their limits as in 2004, despite a record high aerial herbicide fumigation campaign of 1,366 square kilometers, the total area of surviving coca has remained constant, as an estimated 1,139 square kilometers in 2003 were followed by about 1,140 square kilometers in 2004.

Additionally, recent poppy seed cultivation has decreased while coca cultivation actually has not. Overall attempted coca cultivation by growers (total planted coca without taking eradication into account) increased somewhat, from 2,467 square kilometers in 2003 to 2,506 square kilometers in 2004. Coca cultivation reached its highest point during the program in 2002 at 2,671 square kilometers.&lt;ref name = "Connie" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "CIP82"&gt;{{cite web

The U.S. and Colombian governments interpret this data to show a decline in potential production of cocaine, from a peak of 700 metric tons in 2001 to 460 in 2003 and 430 in 2004, as result of an increase in "newly planted [coca fields] in response to eradication," which should be less productive than mature coca.

U.S. government officials admitted in late 2005 that the market price of cocaine has yet to rise significantly, as would be expected from the above reductions in supply. They pointed to possible hidden stashes and other methods of circumventing the immediate effect of eradication efforts which allow for a relatively constant flow of drugs able to enter into the market, delaying the consequences of drug eradication. U.S. Drug Czar John Walters stated that "the reason for [reductions in supply not immediately driving prices up] is that you are not seizing and consuming coca leaves that were grown in 2004 in 2004. You are seizing and consuming coca leaves that were probably grown and processed in 2003 and 2002."&lt;ref name = "stash"&gt;{{cite web

Other observers say this points to the ultimate ineffectiveness of the Plan in stopping the flow of drugs and addressing more important or underlying issues like providing a viable alternative for landless and other peasants, who turn to coca cultivation due to a lack of other economic possibilities, in addition to having to deal with the tumultuous civil conflict between the state, guerrillas and paramilitaries. They also say that by making coca difficult to grow and transport in one area will lead to the movement of the drug cultivation processes to other areas, both inside and outside Colombia, a consequence also known as the [[balloon effect]].&lt;ref name = "CIP"&gt;{{cite web

As an example of the above, it is claimed by critics that Peru and Bolivia, as countries which had earlier monopolized coca cultivations until local eradication efforts later led to the eventual transfer of that part of the illegal business to Colombia, have recently had small increases in coca production despite record eradication in Colombia, which some years ago accounted for about 80% of the coca base produced in South America. Supporters of the Plan and of drug prohibition in general consider that the increase has, so far, been significant to be a sign of the above "balloon effect".

The Colombian government announced that it eradicated around 73,000 coca hectares during 2006 which, according to it, would be above all local records in coca plant destruction. The Colombian government said that it plans to destroy an additional 50,000 hectares of coca in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presidencia.gov.co/prensa_new/sne/2007/enero/03/17032007.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Weekly Standard]]'' hailed Colombia as "the most successful nation-building exercise by the United States in this century", noting:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Colombia used to be the world capital of kidnappings, but the number of victims is down from 2,882 in 2002 to 376 in 2008. Terrorist acts in the same period have fallen from 1,645 to 303. Homicides are also down dramatically: from 28,837 in 2002 to 13,632 in 2008, a 52 percent reduction. Three hundred fifty-nine Colombian soldiers and police lost their lives in battle in 2008, down from 684 in 2002. Between 2002 and 2008, the total hectares of cocaine eradicated rose from 133,127 to 229,227; tons of cocaine seized rose from 105.1 to 245.5; and the number of drug labs seized rose from 1,448 to 3,667. All statistics on narcotics production are hard to gather and therefore suspect, but the latest indications are that last year cocaine production in Colombia fell by 40 percent. Although Colombia's GDP grew by only 2.4 percent in 2008 as a result of the worldwide slowdown, it grew almost 8 percent in 2007, up from less than 2 percent in 2002. Unemployment is still high at 11.1 percent, but considerably lower than in 2002 when it was 15.7 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Priapism''' is a condition in which a [[penis]] remains [[erection|erect]] for hours in the absence of stimulation or after stimulation has ended.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; There are three types: [[ischemic]] (low-flow), nonischemic (high-flow), and recurrent ischemic (intermittent).&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; Most cases are ischemic.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; Ischemic priapism is generally painful while nonischemic priapism is not.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; In ischemic priapism, most of the penis is hard; however, the [[glans penis]] is not.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; In nonischemic priapism, the entire penis is only somewhat hard.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; Very rarely, [[clitoral]] priapism occurs in women.&lt;ref name=Lehmiller2014&gt;{{cite book |authors=Justin J. Lehmiller|title=The Psychology of Human Sexuality|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|isbn=1119164702|year=2014|page=545|accessdate=February 8, 2018|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ytk5DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT545}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause, mechanism, and diagnosis --&gt;
[[Sickle cell disease]] is the most common cause of ischemic priapism.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; Other causes include medications such as [[antipsychotic]]s, [[SSRIs]], and [[anticoagulants|blood thinners]], as well as drugs such as [[cocaine]] and [[cannabis]].&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; Ischemic priapism occurs when blood does not adequately drain from the penis.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; Nonischemic priapism is typically due to a connection forming between an [[artery]] and the [[Corpus cavernosum penis|corpus cavernosum]] or disruption of the [[parasympathetic nervous system]] resulting in increased arterial flow.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; Nonischemic priapism may occur following trauma to the penis or a [[spinal cord injury]].&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; Diagnosis may be supported by [[blood gas]] analysis of blood aspirated from the penis or [[ultrasound]].&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt;

&lt;!-- Treatment, prognosis, and epidemiology--&gt;
Treatment depends on the type.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; Ischemic priapism is typically treated with a [[nerve block]] of the penis followed by aspiration of blood from the corpora cavernosa.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; If this is not sufficient, the corpus cavernosum may be irrigated with cold [[normal saline]] or injected with [[phenylephrine]].&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; Nonischemic priapism is often treated with cold packs and compression.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; Surgery may be done if usual measures are not effective.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; In ischemic priapism, the risk of permanent scarring of the penis begins to increase after four hours and definitely occurs after 48 hours.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Salam|first1=Muhammad A.|title=Principles &amp; Practice of Urology: A Comprehensive Text|date=2003|publisher=Universal-Publishers|isbn=9781581124118|page=342|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=QPSWilXhECkC&amp;pg=PA342|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170427100327/https://books.google.ca/books?id=QPSWilXhECkC&amp;pg=PA342|archivedate=2017-04-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Priapism occurs in about 1 in 20,000 to 1 in 100,000 males per year.&lt;ref name=EM2017&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Podolej|first1=GS|last2=Babcock|first2=C|title=Emergency Department Management Of Priapism.|journal=Emergency medicine practice|date=January 2017|volume=19|issue=1|pages=1–16|pmid=28027457}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Priapism is classified into three groups: ischemic (low-flow), nonischemic (high-flow), and recurrent ischemic.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; The majority of cases (19 out of 20) are ischemic in nature.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt;

Some sources give a duration of four hours as a definition of priapism, but others give six: "The duration of a normal erection before it is classifiable as priapism is still controversial. Ongoing penile erections for more than 6 hours can be classified as priapism."&lt;ref name="scielo.br"&gt;PRIAPISM&amp;nbsp;– ETIOLOGY, PATHOPHYSIOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT, C. VAN DER HORST, HENRIK STUEBINGER, CHRISTOPH SEIF, DIETHILD MELCHIOR, F.J. MARTÍNEZ-PORTILLO, K.P. JUENEMANN; {{cite web |url=http://www.scielo.br/pdf/ibju/v29n5/18554.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130429234259/http://www.scielo.br/pdf/ibju/v29n5/18554.pdf |archivedate=2013-04-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Priapism in females (continued, painful erection of the [[clitoris]]) is significantly rarer than priapism in men, and is known as clitoral priapism or clitorism.&lt;ref name="Lehmiller2014" /&gt; It is associated with [[persistent genital arousal disorder]] (PGAD).&lt;ref name="Carcio"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Helen Carcio, MS, MEd, ANP-BC, R. Mimi Secor, MS, MEd, FNP-BC, NCMP, FAANP|title=Advanced Health Assessment of Women, Third Edition: Clinical Skills and Procedures|publisher=[[Springer Publishing Company]]|isbn=0826123090|year=2014|page=85|accessdate=February 8, 2018|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q4QbBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only a few case reports of women experiencing clitoral priapism exist.&lt;ref name="Lehmiller2014" /&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
===Complications===
Because [[ischemia|ischemic]] priapism causes the blood to remain in the penis for unusually long periods of time, the blood becomes deprived of oxygen and can cause damage to the penile tissue itself. Should the penile tissue become damaged, it can result in [[erectile dysfunction]] or disfigurement of the penis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/priapism/basics/complications/con-20029378 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140806005205/http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/priapism/basics/complications/con-20029378 |archivedate=2014-08-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In extreme cases, if the penis develops severe vascular disease, the priapism can result in penile [[gangrene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Penile Gangrene: An Unusual Complication of Priapism in a Patient with Bladder Carcinoma| pmc=3192523 | pmid=22022653 | doi=10.4103/2006-8808.78470| volume=3| year=2011| journal=J Surg Tech Case Rep| pages=37–9| author=Ajape AA, Bello A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Priapism may be associated with [[hematology|haematological]] disorders, especially [[sickle-cell disease]], sickle-cell trait, and other conditions such as [[leukemia]], [[thalassemia]], and [[Fabry's disease]], and [[neurology|neurologic disorders]] such as [[spinal cord]] lesions and spinal cord trauma (priapism has been reported in people who have been hanged; see [[death erection]]).

Priapism may also be associated with [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency]], which leads to decreased [[NADPH]] levels. NADPH is a co-factor involved in the formation of nitric oxide, which may result in priapism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Finley DS | title = Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency associated stuttering priapism: report of a case | journal = [[J Sex Med]] | volume = 5 | issue = 12 | pages = 2963–6 |date=December 2008 | pmid = 18823322 | doi = 10.1111/j.1743-6109.2008.01007.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sickle cell disease often presents special treatment obstacles. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy has also been used with success in some patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Macaluso JN | title = Priapism: Update for the non-urologist | journal = Sexual Medicine Today | volume = 9 | pages = 11–15 | year = 1985 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Priapism is also found to occur in extreme cases of [[rabies]]. Priapism also occurs due to encephalitic rabies.

===Medications===
Priapism can also be caused by reactions to [[medication]]s. The most common medications that cause priapism are intra-cavernous injections for treatment of [[erectile dysfunction]] ([[papaverine]], [[alprostadil]]). Other groups reported are [[antihypertensives]], [[antipsychotic]]s (e.g., [[chlorpromazine]], [[clozapine]]), [[antidepressant]]s (most notably [[trazodone]]), [[anti-convulsant]] and [[mood stabilizer]] drugs such as [[sodium valproate]],&lt;ref name="Bansal"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bansal S, Gupta SK | title = Sodium Valproate induced priapism in an adult with bipolar affective disorder | journal = [[Indian Journal of Pharmacology]] | volume = 45 | issue = 6 | pages = 629 |date=November 2013 | doi = 10.4103/0253-7613.121383}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[anticoagulants]], [[cantharides]] (''Spanish Fly'') and recreational drugs ([[alcohol]], [[heroin]] and [[cocaine]]). Priapism is also known to occur from bites of the [[Brazilian wandering spider]] and the [[Latrodectus|black widow spider]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/erectile-dysfunction/news/20090924/spider-venom-for-erectile-dysfunction|title=Spider Venom for Erectile Dysfunction?|work=webmd.com|accessdate=11 February 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211214317/http://www.webmd.com/erectile-dysfunction/news/20090924/spider-venom-for-erectile-dysfunction|archivedate=11 February 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism==
The mechanisms are poorly understood but involve complex neurological and [[vascular]] factors.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis is often based on the history of the condition and the [[physical exam]].&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt;

[[Blood gas]] testing the blood from the cavernosa of the penis can help in the diagnosis.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; If the low flow type of priapism is present the blood typically has a low pH while if the high flow type is present the pH is typically normal.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; Color doppler [[ultrasound]] may also help differentiate the two.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; Testing a person to make sure they do not have a [[hemoglobinopathy]] may also be reasonable.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt;

==Treatment==

Medical evaluation is recommended for erections that last for longer than four hours. Pain can often be reduced with a [[dorsal penile nerve]] block or penile [[ring block]].&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; For those with nonischemic priapism cold packs and pressure to the area may be sufficient.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt;

===Aspiration===
For those with ischemic priapism the initial treatment is typically [[Suction (medicine)|aspiration]] of blood from the [[Corpus cavernosum penis|corpus cavernosum]].&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; This is done on either side.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; If this is not sufficiently effective then cold [[normal saline]] may be injected and removed.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt;

===Medications===
If aspiration is not sufficient a small dose of [[phenylephrine]] may be injected into the corpus cavernosum.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; Side effects of phenylephrine may include [[hypertension|high blood pressure]], [[bradycardia|slow heart rate]], and [[Heart arrhythmia|arrhythmia]].&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; If this medication is used, it is recommended that people be monitored for at least an hour after.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; For those with recurrent ischemic priapism [[diethylstilbestrol]] (DES) or [[terbutaline]] may be tried.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt;

===Surgery===
Distal shunts, such as the [[George D. Winter|Winter's]],{{clarify|date=November 2009}} involve puncturing the glans (the distal part of the penis) into one of the cavernosa, where the old, stagnant blood is held. This causes the blood to leave the penis and return to the circulation. This procedure can be performed by a urologist at the bedside. Winter's shunts are often the first invasive technique used, especially in hematologically induced priapism, as it is relatively simple and repeatable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Macaluso JN, Sullivan JW | title = Priapism: A review of 34 cases | journal = Urology | volume = 26 | pages = 233–236 | year = 1985 | doi = 10.1016/0090-4295(85)90116-5 | pmid = 4035837 | issue = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proximal shunts, such as the Quackel's,{{clarify|date=November 2009}} are more involved and entail operative dissection in the [[perineum]] to where the corpora meet the spongiosum, making an incision in both, and suturing both openings together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Montague DK, Jarow J, Broderick GA, Dmochowski RR, Heaton JP, Lue TF, Nehra A, Sharlip ID | title = American Urological Association guideline on the management of priapism | journal = [[J. Urol.]] | volume = 170 | issue = 4 Pt 1 | pages = 1318–24 |date=October 2003 | pmid = 14501756 | doi = 10.1097/01.ju.0000087608.07371.ca }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shunts created between corpora cavernosa and saphenous vein called Grayhack shunt can be done though this technique is rarely used.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

As the complication rates with prolonged priapism are high, early [[penile prosthesis]] implantation may be considered.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; As well as allowing early resumption of sexual activity, early implantation can avoid the formation of dense fibrosis and hence a shortened penis.

===Sickle cell anemia===
In sickle-cell anemia treatment is initially with [[intravenous fluids]], [[pain medication]], and [[oxygen therapy]].&lt;ref name=NIH2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; The typical treatment of priapism may be carried out as well.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; [[Blood transfusions]] are not usually recommended as part of the initial treatment but if other treatments are not effective [[exchange transfusion]] may be done.&lt;ref name=NIH2014&gt;{{cite book|title=Evidence Based Management of Sickle Cell Disease|date=2014|publisher=NHLBI|pages=39–40|url=https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/sites/www.nhlbi.nih.gov/files/sickle-cell-disease-report.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170125155233/https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/sites/www.nhlbi.nih.gov/files/sickle-cell-disease-report.pdf|archivedate=2017-01-25|df=|access-date=2017-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt;

==History==
Persistent semi-erections or intermittent states of prolonged erections have historically been sometimes called semi-priapism.&lt;ref&gt;Newman, Herbert F., and Jane D. Northup. "Mechanism of human penile erection: an overview." Urology 17.5 (1981): 399-408.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terminology===
The name comes from the Greek god [[Priapus]] ({{lang-grc|Πρίαπος}}), a fertility god often represented with a disproportionately large and permanent erection.

'''Protein M''' is an immunoglobulin-binding protein found on the cell surface of the [[Pathogenic bacterium|human pathogenic bacterium]] ''[[Mycoplasma genitalium]]''. It is presumably a universal antibody-binding protein, as it is known to be reactive against all antibody types tested so far. It is capable of preventing the [[antigen-antibody interaction]] due to its high [[binding affinity]] to any antibody. [[The Scripps Research Institute]] announced its discovery in 2014.&lt;ref name=scripps&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ultimate Decoy: Scripps Research Institute Scientists Find Protein that Helps Bacteria Misdirect Immune System|url=http://www.scripps.edu/news/press/2014/20140206lerner.html|publisher=The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI)|accessdate=9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was detected from the bacterium while investigating its role in patients suffering from a cancer, [[multiple myeloma]].&lt;ref name=grover&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grover|first1=R.

== Discovery ==

''Mycoplasma genitalium'' was discovered in 1980 from two male patients suffering from [[non-gonococcal urethritis]] at [[St Mary's Hospital, London|St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, London]].&lt;ref name=tully81&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tully|first1=Joseph G.|last2=Cole|first2=Roger M.|last3=Taylor-Robinson|first3=David|last4=Rose|first4=David L.|title=A newly discovered ''Mycoplasma'' in the human urinogenital tract|journal=The Lancet|year=1981|volume=317|issue=8233|pages=1288–1291|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(81)92461-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; After two years, in 1983, it was identified as a new species.&lt;ref name=tully83&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tully|first1=J.

On 6 February 2014, The Scripps Research Institute announced the discovery of a novel protein, which they named Protein M, from the ''M. genitalium'' cell membrane.&lt;ref name=scripps/&gt; Scientists identified the protein during investigations on the origin of [[multiple myeloma]], a type of B-cell carcinoma. To understand the long-term ''M. genitalium'' infection, Rajesh Grover, a senior staff scientist in the Lerner laboratory, tested antibodies from the blood samples of patients with multiple myeloma against different ''Mycoplasma'' species. He found that ''M. genitalium'' was particularly responsive to all types of [[antibodies]] he tested from 20 patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Voelker|first1=Rebecca|title=Newly Discovered Protein Helps Mycoplasma Evade Immune Response|url=http://newsatjama.jama.com/2014/02/06/newly-discovered-protein-helps-mycoplasma-evade-immune-response/|website=newsatJAMA|accessdate=9 August 2014|date=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The antibody reactivity was found to be due to an undiscovered protein that is chemically responsive to all types of human and non-human antibodies available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mayer|first1=Kevin|title=Protein Sticks to Any Antibody, Gums Up Immune Response|url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/protein-sticks-to-any-antibody-gums-up-immune-response/81249476/|work=GEN|publisher=Genetic Engineering &amp; Biotechnology News|accessdate=9 August 2014|date=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When they isolated and analysed the protein, they discovered that it was unique both in structure and biological functions. Its structure has no resemblance to any known protein listed in the Protein Data Bank.&lt;ref name=grover/&gt;

== Structure and properties ==

Protein M is about 50 [[kDa]] in size, and composed of 556 amino acids. Contrary to the initial hypothesis that the antibody reactions could be an immune response to mass infection with the bacterium, they found that Protein M evolved simply to bind to any antibody it encounters, with specifically high affinity. By this property the bacterium can effectively evade the [[immune system]] of the host. This makes the protein an ideal target for developing new drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The ultimate decoy: Protein helps bacteria misdirect immune system|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/02/140206141847.htm|work=ScienceDaily|accessdate=9 August 2014|date=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Unique Mycoplasma Protein Generically Binds All Types of Antibodies and Blocks Antigen Binding|url=http://www.biotechdaily.com/genomics_proteomics/articles/294750822/a_unique_mycoplasma_protein_generically_binds_all_types_of_antibodies_and_blocks_antigen_binding.html|website=biotechdaily|publisher=Globetech Media|accessdate=9 August 2014|date=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rajesh Grover estimated that the protein can bind to an average of 100,000,000 different kinds of antibodies circulating in human blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cashin-Garbutt|first1=April|title=Protein M: an interview with Rajesh Grover, PhD, senior staff scientist, Lerner laboratory, TSRI|url=http://www.news-medical.net/news/20140226/Protein-M-an-interview-with-Rajesh-Grover-PhD-senior-staff-scientist-Lerner-laboratory-TSRI.aspx|website=News-Medical.Net|accessdate=9 August 2014|date=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike closely related proteins such as [[Protein A]], [[Protein G]], and [[Protein L]], which all contain small, multiple immunoglobulin domains, Protein M has a large domain of 360 amino acid residues that binds primarily to the variable light chain of the immunoglobulin, as well as a binding site called LRR-like motif. In addition, Protein M has a C-terminal domain with 115 amino acid residues that probably protrudes over the antibody binding site. It binds to an antibody at either κ or λ light chains using [[hydrogen bonds]] and [[Salt bridge (protein and supramolecular)|salt bridges]], from backbone atoms and conserved side chains, and some conserved [[van der Waals interactions]] with other nonconserved interactions.&lt;ref name=grover/&gt;

[[File:Bust of Robert Blair by Thomas Campbell, 1815, Old College, University of Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|Bust of Robert Blair by [[Thomas Campbell (sculptor)|Thomas Campbell]], 1815, [[Old College, University of Edinburgh]]]]

Prof '''Robert Blair''' [[FRSE]] (1748–1828) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[astronomer]].

==Life==

He was born in [[Garvald, East Lothian]], the son of Rev Archibald Blair, the local minister.

In 1773 he was apprenticed to Dr Francis Balfour, a [[ship's doctor|naval surgeon]], and served in the [[Royal Navy]] in the [[West Indies]]. On return to Scotland he studied medicine at the [[University of Edinburgh]] and qualified as a doctor in 1785.

Robert Blair was the first Regius Professor of [[Astronomy]] at the [[University of Edinburgh]] (1785 until death). He invented the [[aplanatic]] [[lens (optics)|lens]] and also coined this term. This was a significant step in reducing the [[aberration in optical systems]]. He also experimented with hollow lenses, holding different solutions.

He was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] in 1786.

He died in [[Westloch, Berwickshire]] on 22 December 1828.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attack==
At about 02:10, [[#Suspect|Satoshi Uematsu]] allegedly used a hammer to break into the care center through a glass window on the first floor. He tied up a staff member, took their keys, and then went from room to room, stabbing the victims in their necks as they slept.&lt;ref name=Guardian.KnifeAttack&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/25/tokyo-knife-attack-stabbing-sagamihara|title=Japan knife attack: 19 killed and dozens wounded in stabbing|work=The Guardian|date=25 July 2016|accessdate=25 July 2016|first=Justin|last=McCurry}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NationalPost.Arrested&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/news/world/nineteen-dead-and-20-injured-in-knife-attack-outside-tokyo-reports|title=Suspect arrested after knife attack outside Tokyo leaves at least 15 dead and 26 injured|work=National Post|date=25 July 2016|accessdate=25 July 2016|first=Anna|last=Fifield}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police were called to the care center by staff members at around 02:30 local time, reporting a man with a knife breaking into the building.

==Suspect==
'''{{Nihongo|Satoshi Uematsu|植松 聖|Uematsu Satoshi}},''' born in 1990, was a 26-year-old male at the time of the incident and used to work at the care home Tsukui Yamayuri En.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/2124699-japan-stabbing-attack-15-dead-45-injured-in-sagamihara-kanagawa-prefecture/ |title=Japan Stabbing Attack: 19 Dead, More Than 20 Injured in Sagamihara |website=The Epoch Times |date=25 July 2016 |accessdate=25 July 2016 |first=Jack |last=Phillips}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was an elementary school art teacher, and Uematsu had trained and worked as an elementary school teacher as well. He had lived in his house with his parents, but they moved away at some point and he remained there alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ex-employee stabs 19 people to death in Japan care home|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/07/deadly-knife-attack-facility-disabled-japan-160725213035222.html|website=[[Al Jazeera]]|publisher=[[Al Jazeera Media Network]]|accessdate=7 September 2016|date=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He resigned from working at the facility in February 2016 after having been employed there for over three years.&lt;ref name="obeWar"&gt;{{cite news|first1=Eleanor|last1=Warnock|first2=Mitsuru|last2=Obe|title=Mass Killing in Japan Shocks a Gentle Nation|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/mass-killing-in-japan-shocks-a-gentle-nation-1469533910|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|date=26 July 2016|accessdate=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neighbors expressed surprise that he had allegedly committed the murders; he was described as a friendly, outgoing and good man. However, some reported that his personality had undergone a change at some point during his employment at the facility.&lt;ref name="nytRich"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbcWho"/&gt;&lt;ref name="teleConn"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Connor|first1=Neil|title=Japan knife attack suspect said 'disabled people should be euthanised,' before killing 19|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/07/26/japan-knife-attacker-said-disabled-people-should-be-euthanised-b/|publisher=The Daily Telegraph|date=26 July 2016|accessdate=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Letter and statements===
In February 2016, Uematsu attempted to hand-deliver a letter to [[Tadamori Oshima]], the [[List of Speakers of the House of Representatives of Japan|Speaker of the House of Representatives of Japan]], at Oshima's home in Tokyo but was prevented from doing so by security. He returned the following day and this time left the letter with the security guards.&lt;ref name="nytRich"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rich|first1=Motoko|title=Japan Knife Attack Kills 19 at Center for Disabled|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/26/world/asia/knife-japan-stabbing-sagamihara.html|work=The New York Times|date=25 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Uematsu's letter appealed for the legalization of ending the lives of those with multiple disabilities in cases where it was requested by their guardians, and asked for Oshima's assistance in delivering his message to [[Prime Minister of Japan|Japanese Prime Minister]] [[Shinzo Abe]]. In it, he wrote, "I envision a world where a person with multiple disabilities can be [[involuntary euthanasia|euthanised]], with an agreement from the guardians, when it is difficult for the person to carry out household and social activities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/26/japan-care-home-attack-satoshi-uematsu-horrifying-vision-disabled-people|title=Japan care home attack: picture emerges of modest man with horrifying vision|first=Justin|last=McCurry|date=26 July 2016|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote that the killings of the disabled would be "for the sake of Japan and world peace" as well as to benefit the global economy and prevent [[World War III]].&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="asahiAP"&gt;{{cite news|title=Letter by man accused of mass stabbings carried eerie warning|url=http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/AJ201607260083.html|agency=Associated Press|work=Asahi Shimbun|date=26 July 2016|accessdate=26 July 2016}}{{dl|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After signing his name, the letter proceeded to detail an offer to target two facilities housing the disabled (possibly a reference to the two residential buildings in which he later committed the crime), and went on to appeal for certain conditions in exchange for committing the act. In the first half of the message, Uematsu said he could kill 460 people; however, in the second half, the number he gave was 260. He added that staff would be tied up to keep them from interfering but that they would not be harmed, the act would be swift, and that afterwards he would turn himself in. At the end of the latter half of the letter, he signed his name again, this time with his address, telephone number, and the name of his employer.&lt;ref name="asahiAP"/&gt;

At some point, the letter was handed over to Tokyo police, who contacted the police in Sagamihara. During this time frame, Uematsu posted to his [[Twitter]] account that he expected he might be arrested.&lt;ref name="bbcWho"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-36891375 | title=Japan knife attack: Who is suspect Satoshi Uematsu? | publisher=BBC | date=26 July 2016 | accessdate=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had previously posted tweets about Japan being ravaged by [[radiation poisoning]] and [[AIDS in Japan|AIDS]].&lt;ref name="rtLiesHa"&gt;{{cite news|first1=Elaine|last1=Lies|first2=Kwiyeon|last2=Ha|title=Shock as peaceful Japanese town wakes to 'unthinkable' disabled center horror|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-attack-scene-idUSKCN1060I9|agency=Reuters|date=26 July 2016|accessdate=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that month, after his letter was brought to the attention of Sagamihara's authorities, he was arrested, detained, questioned, and then involuntarily committed to a psychiatric hospital for two weeks.&lt;ref name="remorseJT"&gt;{{cite news|title=Suspect in Sagamihara care facility mass murder says he has ‘no remorse’|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/07/27/national/crime-legal/suspect-sagamihara-care-facility-mass-murder-says-no-remorse/#.V5iSHKLKvEt|publisher=The Japan Times|date=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was released on 2 March after doctors deemed that he was not a threat.&lt;ref name="Guardian.Attack" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sydmorn"&gt;{{cite news|title=Tokyo knifeman kills nearly two dozen|url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/tokyo-knifeman-kills-more-than-a-dozen-reports-20160725-gqdm48.html|accessdate=26 July 2016|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|agency=Associated Press|date=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20160726/p2a/00m/0na/005000c |title=Neighbors describe alleged stabber at facility for disabled as 'cheerful' |language=ja |publisher=The Mainichi |date=26 July 2016 |accessdate=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://the-japan-news.com/news/article/0003105111 |title=Sagamihara knife attack / Neighbors, families express fear, shock |publisher=The Japan News |date=26 July 2016 |accessdate=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pascaline|first1=Mary|title=Japan Knife Attack: Several Dead, Scores Injured At Care Center In West Tokyo|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/japan-knife-attack-several-dead-scores-injured-care-center-west-tokyo-2394791|accessdate=26 July 2016|work=International Business Times|date=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his letter and in statements made after turning himself in, Uematsu explained that he was "saving from unhappiness" both the severely disabled and those who he believed were burdened with maintaining their lives.&lt;ref name="asahiAP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="remorseJT"/&gt;

===Legal proceedings===
On 20 February 2017, Uematsu was found mentally competent to stand trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/02/21/national/crime-legal/accused-killer-19-sagamihara-facility-deemed-fit-stand-trial-sources/|title=Accused killer of 19 at Sagamihara facility deemed fit to stand trial: sources|date=21 February 2017|publisher=|accessdate=26 July 2018|via=Japan Times Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 February, Uematsu was charged with 19 counts of murder, 24 counts of attempted murder, two counts of illegal confinement causing injury, three counts of illegal confinement, one count of unlawful entry, and one count of violating the swords and firearms control law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/AJ201702240075.html|title=Suspect deemed fit to stand trial, indicted on 19 murder charges：The Asahi Shimbun|publisher=|accessdate=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
[[Yoshihide Suga]], the Japanese [[Chief Cabinet Secretary]], acknowledged that the attack was "a very heart-wrenching and shocking incident in which many innocent people became victims".&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Reuters.Feared/&gt; He also said that the [[Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare]] would investigate ways to prevent a similar incident from occurring again.&lt;ref name="cnn"/&gt;

A number of Japanese news outlets ran [[editorial]]s calling the stabbings a [[disability hate crime|hate crime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.okinawatimes.co.jp/articles/-/49918 | title=社説[障がい者施設殺傷]兆候は幾つも出ていた | work=Okinawa Times | date=27 July 2016 | accessdate=2 August 2016}} {{Ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://mainichi.jp/articles/20160727/ddm/010/040/038000c | title=相模原の障害者施設殺傷 - 識者の見方 | work=[[Mainichi Shimbun]] | date=27 July 2016 | accessdate=2 August 2016 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} {{Ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sankei.com/affairs/news/160802/afr1608020004-n1.html | title=【相模原１９人刺殺】 憎悪と計画性、浮かぶ異様さ | work=[[Sankei Shimbun]] | date=2 August 2016 | accessdate=2 August 2016}} {{Ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://mainichi.jp/articles/20160802/org/00m/040/005000c | title=Ｌｉｓｔｅｎｉｎｇ ＜記者の目＞相模原殺傷事件＝須藤孝（政治部） | work=[[Mainichi Shimbun]] | date=2 August 2016 | accessdate=2 August 2016}} {{Ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; By September 2016, little information had been released about the victims of the attack. Reuters wrote that this was due to Japanese culture and [[social stigma|stigma]] being less accepting of physically and cognitively impaired persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ha|first1=Kwiyeon|last2=Sieg|first2=Linda|title=FEATURE: Japan confronts disability stigma after attack|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/japan-disabled-idUSL3N1BS0AV|accessdate=17 September 2016|work=Taipei Times|agency=Reuters|date=16 September 2016|archiveurl=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/world/archives/2016/09/17/2003655318|archivedate=17 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 September 2016, the governor of [[Kanagawa Prefecture]], [[Yuji Kuroiwa]], said the facility would be rebuilt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tokyo-np.co.jp/article/kanagawa/list/201609/CK2016091302000185.html やまゆり園建て替えへ　再生に向け本格始動] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914155811/http://www.tokyo-np.co.jp/article/kanagawa/list/201609/CK2016091302000185.html |date=14 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4615">The concept of the soft path was first used for energy resource management and was developed by [[Amory Lovins]] shortly after the shock of the [[1973 energy crisis]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;"Energy Strategy: The Road Not Taken?" published in Foreign Affairs, in October 1976&lt;/ref&gt; This concept has now been refined and applied to water, most notably by water expert [[Peter Gleick]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pacinst.org/topics/water_and_sustainability/soft_path/nature_07252002.pdf|title=P.H. Gleick, 2002.

Brooks, Oliver M. Brandes and Stephen Gurman, Earthscan, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The soft path is often framed as a more integrated and effective alternative to supply-side water resource management. Supply-side water management focuses on meeting demands for water through centralized, large-scale physical infrastructure, and centralized water management systems. In the 20th century, this approach focused on constructing bigger dams and drilling deeper wells to access more water to meet projected demands of consumers. More recently, a focus on demand-side management has emerged in regions where water supply is increasingly constrained (see, for example, [[Peak water]]), and it focuses on managing demand and making current practices more efficient. The soft path integrates both supply and demand concepts but in a broader context by recognizing that water is a means to satisfy demands for goods and services and asking how much water, of what qualities, is actually required to satisfy those demands efficiently and sustainably.&lt;ref&gt;Page 4. The Soft Path for Water in a Nutshell. 2005. Oliver M Brandes and David B Brooks. Friends of the Earth and POLIS Project on Ecological Governance. University of Victoria, Victoria, BC.&lt;/ref&gt; Soft path water planning also requires broader institutional approaches to water management including the application of smart economics, the potential for distributed rather than centralized water systems, and more democratic participation in water policy decisions.&lt;ref&gt;G. Wolff and P.H. Gleick, "The Soft Path for Water" in The World's Water 2002-2003 (Island Press, Washington D.C., pp. 1-32.[http://www.pacinst.org/publications/worlds_water/worlds_water_2002_chapter1.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Others have described the soft path as "unleashing the full potential of demand-side management.",&lt;ref&gt;[Quote]{{cite web |url=http://www.poliswaterproject.org/softpath |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120907002645/http://www.poliswaterproject.org/softpath |archivedate=2012-09-07 |df= }} [Oliver M Brandes water expert]http://www.cbc.ca/blueprintalberta/experts/oliver-brandes.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Page 4.

'''The Aversion Project''' was a [[medical torture]] program in [[South Africa]] led by Dr. [[Aubrey Levin]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; during [[apartheid]]. The project identified gay soldiers as [[conscripts]] who used drugs in the [[South African Defence Force]]s (SADF). Victims were forced to submit to "curing" their [[homosexuality]]&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegully.com/essays/africa/000825sexchange.html |title=Africa &amp;#124; Apartheid Military Forced Gay Troops Into Sex-Change Operations |publisher=The Gully |date=2000-08-25 |accessdate=2013-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; because the SADF considered homosexuality to be "subversive" and those who were homosexual were subject to punishment.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Treatment of homosexuality during apartheid|url = http://www.bmj.com/content/329/7480/1415|journal = BMJ|date = 2004-12-16|issn = 0959-8138|pmc = 535952|pmid = 15604160|pages = 1415–1416|volume = 329|issue = 7480|doi = 10.1136/bmj.329.7480.1415|first = Robert M.|last = Kaplan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The approach taken by the SADF to treating the homosexual and transsexual patients were done with extremely old knowledge that can be taken back to the ideologies of Havelock Ellis.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The requirement for homosexuals going through gender reassignment surgery is to have extensive assessment and a period of supervision for two years.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In 1995 the Medical Association of South Africa issued a public apology for past wrongdoings.

== History  ==

During the [[Apartheid]] Era in South Africa there existed a dual policy on homosexuality in the South African military. This dual policy consisted of two major components which prohibited permanent members of the force from being homosexual, while permitting homosexuality amongst conscripts.  The dual policy was adopted because officials believed that banning homosexuality from the military completely would give a specific group of individuals – young, white South African men – a convenient way to avoid serving in the military.  Thus, the dual policy was adopted and enforced; however, with toleration of homosexuality came forced 'therapy,' such as compulsion shock therapy, castration, and other forms of 'therapy' which were said to significantly violate basic human rights.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Belkin|first=Aaron|last2=Canaday|first2=Margot|year=2010|title=Assessing the Integration of Gays and Lesbians into the South African National Defence Force|url=|journal=Scientia Militaria: South African Journal of Military Studies|volume=38.2|pages=1–21|via=|doi=10.5787/38-2-87}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 1971 and 1989, victims were submitted to [[chemical castration]] and [[Electroconvulsive therapy|electric shock treatment]] meant to cure them of their homosexuality.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/jul/29/chrismcgreal|title = Gays Tell of Mutilation by Apartheid Army|last = McGreal|first = Chris|date = 28 July 2000|work = The Guardian|access-date = 23 August 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This trend was heavily supported by psychiatrists with the idea that homosexuals were mentally ill, which was stated in the American Psychiatric Associations "Diagnostic and Statistic Manual of Mental Disorders".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaplan|first=Robert|year=2004|title=Treatment of Homosexuality During Apartheid|jstor=25469630|journal=British Medical Journal|volume=329|pages=1415–1416|doi=10.1136/bmj.329.7480.1415}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Conscripts with this proclaimed 'mental illness' were treated significantly different than other members of the military.  They were not given military leadership positions and they were not entrusted with sensitive information.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  During the course of the shock therapy treatment electrodes were strapped to the upper arm with wires, then run through a dial calibrated from 1 to 10, varying the current. Homosexual soldiers were shown black and white pictures of a naked man and were encouraged to fantasize, at which a point the person-in-charge would administer a shock if the soldiers showed any form of sexual response and voltage was increased throughout the treatment if the soldiers continued to exhibit sexual responses. The patient would then be shown a colored picture of a woman, which was supposed to stimulate arousal, however, more often than not, this failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaplan|first=Robert|year=2001|title=THE AVERSION PROJECT-PSYCHIATRIC ABUSES IN THE SOUTH AFRICAN DEFENCE FORCE DURING THE APARTHEID ERA|url= https://aubreylevinvictims.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/the-aversion-project-psychiatric-abuses-in-sadf-during-the-apartheid-1_page_1.jpg |journal=Health and Human Rights|volume=91|pages=1–2|via=SAMJ Forum}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of these failures, there is also evidence that [[Sex reassignment surgery|sexual realignment procedures]] took place on the individuals who were unable to be 'cured.' &lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  Because there is no scientific evidence to prove that 'therapies' have the ability to alter ones sexuality, these tortures reached their peak during the 1970s, where therapy for homosexual soldiers was no longer supported by the field of mental health.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=De Gruchy J|first=Jeanelle|last2=Lewin|first2=Simon|year=2001|title=Ethics that Exclude: The Role of Ethics Committees in Lesbian and Gay Health Research in South Africa|url=|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=91|pages=865–868|via=|doi=10.2105/ajph.91.6.865|pmc=1446457}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Consequently, the definition of homosexuals as mentally ill was removed from the [[American Psychiatric Association]]s manual in 1973, and the treatment was left behind.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== The Aversion Research Project ==
A team of individuals: academic researchers and activists on behalf of the [[Gay]] community came together in order to obtain more information about the treatment of homosexual military personnel during the Apartheid Era.  This was a research project based on qualitative methodology that helped to further examine why homosexuality was considered to be unusual behavior at that time. Various homosexual individuals – who were targets of the conversion therapy – along with the families and friends of these individuals were interviewed in order to obtain in-depth, first hand, experiences of those directly impacted.  Prior to following through with the project, the researchers had to be approved by a research committee.  However, the research committee had an issue with researchers using the word ''abuse'' as a way of describing what happened to homosexual military personnel.  The research committee believed that considering the conversion 'therapy' to be abuse was only an assumption, it was not supported by factual evidence.  Therefore, the term ''abuse'', when used in the research project, had to be supported with factual evidence.  Additionally, the researchers considered the actions of psychologists initiating this conversion shock therapy as a human rights violation.  The research ethics committee, on the other hand, did not agree.  This raised concerns about the research project because the committee did not want this to be an investigation into the practices of medical officials involved in the military.  Furthermore,  the committee questioned the sampling methods of the researchers.  Because researchers would be accepting volunteers, they found that the sampling method used would not be representative of the experience as a whole.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

== Medical abuse of homosexuals in South Africa ==
The medical abuse of patients in South Africa can be seen in various situations, aside from just the conversion therapy. To protect the health of your citizens includes treating them all with the same respect and equality. A doctors first priority should be working towards finding a solution for the medical problem the patient presents them with. However, different than many other countries, South Africa was still very religiously traditional and divided racially amongst its citizens. This led to the connection between being homophobic and engaging in a violation of human rights. Gay patients health issues were neglected and stereotyped. Doctors showed clear discrimination against gay patients when they paid less attention to fulfilling their needs because of the association of HIV/AIDS with homosexual men. This led to inadequate health care, and additional abuse from those who value the medical opinion of doctors.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jones|first=Tiffany|year=2008|title=Averting White Male (Ab)normality: Psychiatric Representations and Treatment of Homosexuality in 1960's South Africa|jstor=40283145|journal=Journal of Southern African Studies.|volume=34|pages=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; One can also attribute the abuse of homosexuals to economic and social problems that South Africa may have been facing during that time. This can be explained by some as the need to regain social control. The racial divide in South Africa put anyone other than the white man outside of the norm. According to Sander Gilman, "the worldwide concept of pervasion is the basic quality ascribed to the other. in turn blacks, women, and those deemed sexually deviant were seen as fundamentally disordered and were institutionalized in numbers far higher than straight white men"&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This bothering can be used to explain why whites in South Africa felt so strongly about homosexuality, and finding a way to get rid of it.

==  Aubrey Levin ==
[[Aubrey Levin]] was the primary leader of the project against homosexual military personnel.  He argued that the same type of procedures could cure other groups. These included [[Drug of abuse|drug]] addicts and the disturbed (those who did not want to serve in the apartheid military). He started the project and ran Ward 22 at 1 Military Hospital, in [[Voortrekkerhoogte]], which is where majority of the patients were treated. He was one of 24 other doctors that were warned by the truth and reconciliation commission that what they were doing was a violation of human rights, and they risked being labeled as perpetrators of human rights abuses.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://aubreylevinvictims.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/the-aversion-project-psychiatric-abuses-in-sadf-during-the-apartheid-1_page_2.jpg|title=The Aversion Project Psychiatric Abuses in the South African Defense Force During the Apartheid Era|last=Kaplan|first=Robert|date=March 2001|work=|access-date=|via=World Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Levin has admitted to the abuse claiming that all patients were "volunteers".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Since then, Levin has been accused of many more instances of medical foul practice, targeting many other men (not only those who identified as homosexual).  He was sentenced in a five-year prison sentence on April 23, 2014, which is where he currently resides awaiting release.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thewalrus.ca/doctor-shock/|title=Dr. Shock|last=Poplack|first=Richard|date=|work=Dr. Shock|access-date=2017-02-28|language=en-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-Project ==
After the conversion therapy was noticeably failing, staff came up with an alternative. As a result, whenever treatments would not work, they put patients through a [[sex change operation]]. This included being put through surgery and being given a new identity.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Patients would then be discharged from the military, and advised to cut themselves off from family and friends. As many as 900 homosexuals, mostly 16–24 year-olds who had been [[Draft (conscription)|drafted]], were surgically turned into women and given birth certificates to fit their modified anatomy. This surgery was done in military hospitals and a high rate of patients died during surgery. Additionally, the reassignments were often incomplete, leaving patients with a halfway finished procedures.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; After being discharged there were no follow-up appointments to finish the surgeries or check on their progress mentally and physically. In order to stay on track with their gender reassignment, patients needed an expensive supply of hormones, but they typically lacked the means to pay for these hormones to maintain their new identities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alternet.org/print/10-most-evil-medical-experiments-conducted-history | title=10 of the Most Evil Medical Experiments Conducted in History|publisher=Alternet.org|accessdate=2015-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When converting from one sex to another, there is a lengthy process that accompanies the success; individuals must be prepared both mentally and physically for the drastic changes that are going to take place. Without this preparation, patients also faced depression leading to many of these patients to committing suicide.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3047">'''The Practice PLC''' is one of the largest providers of [[Primary Care]] in the English NHS.

The Practice was established in 2004 - then called Practice Networks - by Dr Jeremy Rose and Dr Ajit Kadirgamar in [[Amersham]].  It now runs over 50 GP surgeries and GP-led Health Centres.  In February 2014 it had the biggest list of about 174,000 registered patients of any provider in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dominance of small GP practices undermines push for extended providers|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/news/primary-care/dominance-of-small-gp-practices-undermines-push-for-extended-providers/5068088.article#.U8KzGfldUk4|accessdate=13 July 2014|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=19 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2012 the company closed down the Camden Road Surgery – a long-standing GP practice previously taken over by US health company [[UnitedHealth]] in 2008 - less than a year after taking over the contract because the surgery's landlord refused an extension for the premises lease beyond April 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Private firm closes flagship GP practice in north London|url=http://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/news/private-firm-closes-flagship-gp-practice-in-north-london/13395610.article#.U8K1MPldUk4|accessdate=13 July 2014|publisher=Pulse|date=8 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Camden Road was one of six practices taken over from [[UnitedHealth]] when the American firm decided to refocus its UK business to concentrate solely on commissioning support, and exploit the opportunities presented by the Government's NHS reforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UnitedHealth quits primary care and sells off surgeries to The Practice|url=http://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/unitedhealth-quits-primary-care-and-sells-off-surgeries-to-the-practice/12199561.article#.U8K2PfldUk4|accessdate=13 July 2014|publisher=Pulse|date=20 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018 its practices had a registered population of more than 200,000.  Since 2016 it has been majority owned by the [[Centene Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Major private GP provider loses top executives|url=https://www.hsj.co.uk/7021690.article?|accessdate=2 April 2018|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=15 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 it set up TPG Complex Care, which is focused on care at home for patients with complex needs.  In  March 2016 it had 517 staff - 188 clinical and 331 in administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Practice Group Ltd|url=http://www.nhsforsale.info/private-providers/the-practice-plc.html|accessdate=2 April 2018|publisher=NHS For Sale|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It ran  five surgeries in Brighton but gave them up in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fresh start for Brighton family doctors’ surgery|url=http://www.brightonandhovenews.org/2018/03/10/fresh-start-for-brighton-family-doctors-surgery/|accessdate=2 April 2018|publisher=Brighton and Hove News|date=10 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2269">'''''Van Wyk v Lewis'''''&lt;ref&gt;1924 AD 438.&lt;/ref&gt; is an important case in South African law, particularly in the area of delict and on the question of negligence.

== Facts ==
The defendant, a surgeon, had performed an urgent and difficult abdominal operation upon the plaintiff. The operation took place in a hospital at night, assisted by an anesthetist and a qualified nurse on the hospital staff who acted as theatre sister. At the conclusion of the operation, one of the swabs used by the defendant was overlooked and remained in plaintiff's body, from which it passed after a lapse of twelve months. The evidence showed that:

* in accordance with the usual practice at the hospital, the defendant had relied upon the sister to count and check the swabs used;
* at the conclusion of the operation, he made as careful a search as the critical condition of the patient permitted; and that
* both he and the sister believed that all the swabs were accounted for before the wound was sewn up.

== Judgment ==
In an action against the defendant for damages for negligence in failing to remove the swab, the court held that negligence could not be inferred from the mere fact that the accident happened; the onus of establishing negligence lay upon plaintiff. Although the defendant, in performing the operation, was bound to exercise all reasonable care and skill, it was a reasonable and proper practice to leave the duty of checking the swabs to the theatre sister, so the defendant, in following that practice, was not guilty of negligence. Assuming, without deciding, that the sister was negligent in checking the swabs, the court held that the defendant was not liable for the result of such negligence.

The decision of the Queenstown Circuit Local Division, in ''Van Wyk v Lewis'', was thus confirmed.

Public Prosecutor''''' was a seminal case decided in 2010 by the [[Court of Appeal of Singapore|Court of Appeal]] of [[Singapore]] which, in response to a challenge by [[Yong Vui Kong]], a convicted drug smuggler, held that the mandatory [[capital punishment in Singapore|death penalty]] imposed by the {{Singapore legislation|title=Misuse of Drugs Act|titlelink=Misuse of Drugs Act (Singapore)|cap=185|ed=2001}} ("MDA") for certain drug trafficking offences does not infringe [[Article 9 of the Constitution of Singapore|Articles 9(1)]] and [[Article 12 of the Constitution of Singapore|12(1)]] of the [[Constitution of Singapore]].

Article 9(1) states: "No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty save in accordance with law." The Court of Appeal held that the term ''law'' does not exclude laws sanctioning inhuman punishment. This does not mean that all laws are justified whatever their nature. Laws which violate fundamental rules of [[natural justice]], or those that are absurd or arbitrary cannot be considered law. Nonetheless, the threshold of culpability in imposing the mandatory death penalty for drug-related offences is a matter of policy and is therefore a matter for legislation and not for the courts to decide. The Court [[distinguishing|distinguished]] a line of [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]] cases finding the mandatory death penalty to be unconstitutional, because the constitutions of the jurisdictions from which the appeals originated contained an explicit prohibition against inhuman punishment, which Singapore's Constitution lacks. In addition, though the [[Constitution of India]] also does not expressly prohibit inhuman punishment, the Court declined to follow a decision of the [[Supreme Court of India]] invalidating the mandatory death penalty for inconsistency with Article 21 of the [[Constitution of India|Indian Constitution]], which is similar to Singapore's Article 9(1). Among other things, it took the view that the test for constitutional validity under Article 9(1) is different from the test applied to India's Article 21. Finally, the Court was of the opinion that rules of [[customary international law]] cannot be incorporated into the meaning of the word ''law'' in Article 9(1) as this is not in accordance with the normal hierarchy of Singapore law, which envisages that customary international law may only be adopted into the [[common law]] if it is not inconsistent with existing [[municipal law|domestic laws]]. In any case, there is insufficient state practice to demonstrate that customary international law regards the mandatory death penalty as an inhuman punishment.

The Court of Appeal also held that the mandatory death penalty does not violate Article 12(1) of the Constitution, which states: "All persons are equal before the law and entitled to the equal protection of the law." In its opinion, the {{convert|15|g|adj=on}} differentia used in the MDA to determine whether the death penalty should be imposed for trafficking in diamorphine ([[heroin]]) cannot be said to be purely arbitrary, and bears a rational relation to the social object of the Act which is to prevent the growth of drug addiction in Singapore by stamping out the illicit drug trade.

Following this case, the appellant Yong Vui Kong unsuccessfully challenged the process by which the [[President of Singapore|President]] grants [[pardon|clemency]] to convicted persons on the advice of the [[Cabinet of Singapore|Cabinet]].

==Trial and subsequent events==
[[File:ImmigrationCard-Singapore-DeathPenalty-20051226.jpg|thumb|left|An immigration card issued by the [[Immigration and Checkpoints Authority]] reminding travellers to [[Singapore]] that the [[capital punishment in Singapore|death penalty]] is imposed for drug trafficking]]

The appellant, [[Yong Vui Kong]], was a 19-year-old [[Malaysia]]n national who was arrested in [[Singapore]] on 13 June 2007 and charged with trafficking in {{convert|47.27|g}} of diamorphine ([[heroin]]), a Class A controlled drug under the [[Misuse of Drugs Act (Singapore)|Misuse of Drugs Act]] ("MDA").&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Misuse of Drugs Act|titlelink=Misuse of Drugs Act (Singapore)|cap=185|ed=2001}} ("MDA").&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CommonLII|litigants=Public Prosecutor v. Yong Vui Kong|court=SGHC|year=2009|num=4|pinpoint=para. 1|courtname=auto}} ("''P.P. v. Yong Vui Kong'' (2009, H.C.)").&lt;/ref&gt; Yong told investigators that he had not been aware of the contents of the packages which he was asked to handle, maintaining instead that he had been delivering packages for his boss, a man known as "Ah Hiang", for whom he was working as a debt-collector. Ah Hiang had instructed him not to open the packages, and Yong had acted according to these instructions even though he was suspicious of the contents.&lt;ref&gt;''P.P. v. Yong Vui Kong'' (2009, H.C.), para. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a trial in the [[High Court of Singapore|High Court]], Yong was found guilty of drug trafficking contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the MDA. Trafficking in more than {{convert|15|g}} of diamorphine attracts a mandatory [[capital punishment in Singapore|death penalty]]. The Court was of the view that Yong must have known that he had been carrying drugs.&lt;ref&gt;''P.P. v. Yong Vui Kong'' (2009, H.C.), paras. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Yong instructed his counsel to file an appeal, but later asked that the appeal be withdrawn. His case was eventually taken over by another lawyer, [[M Ravi|M. Ravi]], who had been instructed by Yong's brother. In the meantime, Yong had also petitioned the [[President of Singapore]] for [[pardon|clemency]]. This was rejected on 20 November 2009 and Yong's execution was set for 4 December 2009. Ravi then filed an urgent [[motion (legal)|motion]] to challenge the constitutionality of the mandatory death penalty prescribed by the MDA. The motion was heard by Justice [[Woo Bih Li]], who granted a [[stay of execution]] pending a decision by the [[Court of Appeal of Singapore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CommonLII|litigants=Yong Vui Kong v. Public Prosecutor|court=SGHC|year=2009|num=274|courtname=H.C.|juris=Singapore}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yong Vui Kong (2010, CA)"&gt;''Yong Vui Kong v. Public Prosecutor'' [2010] 2 S.L.R. [''Singapore Law Reports''] 192 at 195–196, paras. 3–5, [[Court of Appeal of Singapore|Court of Appeal]] (Singapore).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the hearing before the Court of Appeal,&lt;ref name="Yong Vui Kong (2010, CA)"/&gt; Yong was allowed to pursue his appeal. The Court was of the opinion that the initial withdrawal of the appeal was a nullity as Yong had failed to appreciate the fact that he could have proceeded with his appeal on [[question of law|points of law]], namely, challenging the compatibility of the mandatory death penalty with [[Article 9 of the Constitution of Singapore|Articles 9(1)]] and [[Article 12 of the Constitution of Singapore|12(1)]] of the [[Constitution of Singapore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Constitution|rep=1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Yong Vui Kong v. P.P.'' (2010, C.A.), pp. 202–204, paras. 25–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal issues==
In the present case before the Court of Appeal, Yong challenged the constitutionality of the mandatory death penalty imposed by the MDA on the grounds that it violated Article 9(1) and/or Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

===Article 9(1) challenge===
[[File:Article 9 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1999 Reprint).jpg|thumb|[[Article 9 of the Constitution of Singapore|Article 9(1)]] in the 1999 Reprint of the [[Constitution of Singapore]]]]

Article 9(1) of the Constitution reads: "No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty save in accordance with law." The word ''law'' is defined in Article 2(1), which states that "'law' includes ... the [[common law]] in so far as it is in operation in Singapore".

The Court of Appeal noted that if the appellant's challenge on the basis of Article 9(1) was successful, it would mean that mandatory death penalty provisions in statutes other than the MDA would also be unconstitutional, such as the penalties of the following offences:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CommonLII|litigants=Yong Vui Kong v. Public Prosecutor|court=SGCA|year=2010|num=20|parallelcite=[2010] 3 S.L.R. 489 at 497, para. 7|courtname=C.A.|juris=Singapore}} (''Yong Vui Kong'' (substantive appeal)").&lt;/ref&gt;

*Murder, in section 302 of the [[Penal Code (Singapore)|Penal Code]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Penal Code|titlelink=Penal Code (Singapore)|cap=224|ed=2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Using or attempting to use arms, in section 4 of the Arms Offences Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Arms Offences Act|cap=14|ed=2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Using or attempting to use arms to commit or attempt to commit specified offences, in section 4A of the Arms Offences Act.
*Having or carrying, without lawful excuse and without lawful authority, any firearm, ammunition or explosive in a security area, in section 58(1) of the [[Internal Security Act (Singapore)|Internal Security Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Internal Security Act|titlelink=Internal Security Act (Singapore)|cap=143|ed=1985}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mandatory death penalty constitutes inhuman punishment====
Yong's first argument was that the word ''law'' in Article 9(1) did not include laws that imposed inhuman punishments. Since the mandatory death penalty was inhuman, the provisions in the MDA that imposed a mandatory death sentence ran afoul of the Constitution. The argument hinged on the fact that the mandatory death penalty has long been held to be an inhuman punishment in a string of cases from Belize,&lt;ref name=Reyes&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Reyes v. R.|court=UKPC|year=2002|num=11|parallelcite=[2002] 2 A.C. 235|courtname=auto|juris=Belize}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Saint Christopher and Nevis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Fox v.

Attorney General'' [http://www.worldlii.org/mw/cases/MWHC/2007/1.html &amp;#91;2007&amp;#93; MWHC 1], Constitutional Case No. 12 of 2005 (27 April 2007), H.C. (Malawi).&lt;/ref&gt; and India.&lt;ref name=Mithu&gt;''Mithu v. State of Punjab'' A.I.R. 1983 S.C. 473, [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] (India).&lt;/ref&gt; The Court of Appeal indicated that many of the cases had been [[distinguishing|distinguished]] in its earlier decision ''Nguyen Tuong Van v. Public Prosecutor'' (2005),&lt;ref&gt;''Nguyen Tuong Van v. Public Prosecutor'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20101115085712/http://www.singaporelaw.sg/rss/judg/46431.html &amp;#91;2004&amp;#93; SGCA 47], [2005] 1 S.L.R.(R.) [''Singapore Law Reports (Reissue)''] 103, C.A. (Singapore), archived from [http://www.singaporelaw.sg/rss/judg/46431.html the original] on 15 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and that this was merely "traversing old ground".&lt;ref&gt;''Yong Vui Kong'' (substantive appeal), p. 508, para. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Court did highlight three cases.

The first was the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]] case ''Reyes v. R.'' (2002),&lt;ref name=Reyes/&gt; an appeal from Belize. Reyes had shot and killed his neighbour and his neighbour's wife, and had been convicted of two counts of murder. Murder by shooting was a "Class A" murder offence which attracted the mandatory death penalty. The Privy Council held that the mandatory death penalty imposed in this case contravened section 7 of the [[Constitution of Belize]] as it was inhuman or degrading punishment. This was because even within the category of "Class A" murders, there were some offenders who were not as morally culpable as the others, since the offence could have occurred in the heat of the moment. To deny the offender a chance to show the court that it would be disproportionate and inappropriate to impose the death penalty on him would thus be to deny his basic humanity.&lt;ref&gt;''Yong Vui Kong'' (substantive appeal), p. 514, paras. 48–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second case was the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] decision ''[[Woodson v. North Carolina]]'' (1976).&lt;ref name=Woodson/&gt; The [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] prohibits [[cruel and unusual punishment]], and the Court proceeded on this basis to strike down mandatory death penalty legislation on a 5:4 majority. The reasons given were that the mandatory death penalty imposed a process which did not take into account relevant differences between the offenders and the offence, and excluded from judicial consideration any mitigating factors. The penalty was inhuman as it treated persons convicted of a designated offence "not as uniquely individual human beings, but as members of a faceless, undifferentiated mass to be subjected to the blind infliction of the penalty of death".&lt;ref&gt;''Woodson'', p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt;

The third case was the [[Supreme Court of India|Indian Supreme Court]] judgment ''Mithu v. State of Punjab'' (1983).&lt;ref name=Mithu/&gt; In that case, the appellant, who was under a sentence of [[life imprisonment]], committed murder which attracted the mandatory death penalty under section 303 of the [[Indian Penal Code]] 1860.&lt;ref&gt;[[Indian Penal Code]] 1860 ([http://districtcourtallahabad.up.nic.in/articles/IPC.pdf No. 45 of 1860] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140211040454/http://districtcourtallahabad.up.nic.in/articles/IPC.pdf |date=11 February 2014 }}).&lt;/ref&gt; Similar arguments to those in ''Woodson'' were canvassed, namely, that this provision of law deprived the Court of the chance to use its discretion and wisdom and ignored all factors pertaining to the gravity of the offence.&lt;ref&gt;''Yong Vui Kong'' (substantive appeal), p. 510, para. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the first challenge to Article 9(1), the [[Attorney-General of Singapore|Attorney-General]] [[Walter Woon]] submitted that the courts should hold to the established principles in both ''[[Ong Ah Chuan v. Public Prosecutor]]'' (1980)&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ong Ah Chuan v. Public Prosecutor]]'' [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/1980/1980_32.html &amp;#91;1980&amp;#93; UKPC 32], [1981] A.C. 648, [1979–1980] S.L.R.(R.) 710, [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]] (on appeal from Singapore).&lt;/ref&gt; as well as ''Nguyen Tuong Van''. His contention was premised on the argument that the Privy Council's decisions in the cases following ''Ong Ah Chuan'' and ''Nguyen Tuong Van'' did not necessarily have to be followed as the Privy Council "does not dictate human rights standards for the rest of humanity".&lt;ref&gt;''Yong Vui Kong'' (substantive appeal), pp. 511–512, para. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mandatory death penalty contrary to customary international law====
Yong's second argument was that the word ''law'' in Article 9(1) should also be taken to include [[customary international law]]. He argued that since customary international law prohibited mandatory death penalty sentences as inhuman, the MDA provisions also violated Article 9(1). Yong's argument was based on the fact that there are a diminishing number of states which still retain the mandatory death penalty for drug-related offences.&lt;ref&gt;''Yong Vui Kong'' (substantive appeal), p. 512, para. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Attorney-General submitted that there are two possible ways in which to interpret the word ''law''. First, it could be taken to refer only to statutes and the common law applicable in Singapore. Secondly, it could be interpreted to include rules of customary international law. When queried by the Court of Appeal as to his preferred interpretation, he responded that, in principle, the word ''law'' should be taken to include customary international law, but only rules which had already been recognized and applied by the domestic courts of Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;''Yong Vui Kong'' (substantive appeal), pp. 512–513, para. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the Attorney-General disagreed with the contention that the mandatory death penalty violates any customary international law prohibition against inhuman punishment. He submitted that the decisions after ''Ong Ah Chuan'' and ''Nguyen Tuong Van'' were reflective of the Privy Council's changing attitude toward the mandatory death penalty specifically, but did not reflect any international consensus that the mandatory death penalty is prohibited by the rules of customary international law. This was evident from the fact that there are still 31 states worldwide which continue to impose the mandatory death penalty for drug-related offences as well as other serious crimes. Thus, the international consensus needed to establish the principle contended for by the appellant was lacking.&lt;ref&gt;''Yong Vui Kong'' (substantive appeal), p. 513, para. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Article 12(1) challenge===
[[File:Article 12 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1999 Reprint) - 01.jpg|thumb|[[Article 12 of the Constitution of Singapore|Article 12(1)]] in the 1999 Reprint of the Constitution]]

Article 12(1) of the Constitution reads: "All persons are equal before the law and entitled to the equal protection of the law." In ''Ong Ah Chuan'', the Privy Council interpreted Article 12(1) as prohibiting laws requiring differentiation in the punishment of individuals in the same class, but allowing differentiation in punitive treatment between different classes of individuals where there was a difference in the circumstances of the offences committed. This dissimilarity in circumstances would justify discriminatory punitive treatment as long as it was not purely arbitrary and bore a reasonable relation to the social object of the law.

Yong argued that the MDA made the quantity of 15&amp;nbsp;grams of diamorphine the only determinant of whether the mandatory death penalty should be imposed, and that this was highly arbitrary as baseless distinctions had to be drawn between offenders who trafficked in different amounts of controlled drugs. Six points were raised to support this contention:&lt;ref&gt;''Yong Vui Kong'' (substantive appeal), pp. 535–536, paras. 103–108.&lt;/ref&gt;

#Even if there was a quantitative and incremental increase in guilt or mischief associated with trafficking in just over 15&amp;nbsp;grams of diamorphine as opposed to just under 15&amp;nbsp;grams, it would be inappropriate to respond to this with a qualitative and non-incremental increase in the prescribed penalty.
#The 15-gram differentia meant the MDA might be harsher on a one-time offender trafficking in slightly more than 15&amp;nbsp;grams of diamorphine, as opposed to a repeat offender who trafficked in slightly less than 15&amp;nbsp;grams of diamorphine each time.
#At the sentencing stage, the mandatory death penalty precluded the court from considering the circumstances in which the offence was committed. This denied the Prosecution and the public of information on the type of offenders likely to reoffend, and impeded the [[Parliament of Singapore|legislature]] from determining if the mandatory death penalty was actually necessary.
#Sentencing under the MDA was too rigid as it prevented the court from considering major factual differences between cases.
#Despite sentencing under the MDA being based on general deterrence, the court was disallowed from considering if the offender had voluntarily assumed the risk of trafficking in controlled drugs. It was unlikely that an offender would know if the substance he was trafficking contained the amount of diamorphine sufficient to fulfil the 15-gram differentia.
#The 15-gram differentia failed to differentiate between an offender trafficking in slightly more than 15&amp;nbsp;grams of diamorphine as opposed to one who trafficked in multiple times that quantity.

In response, the Attorney-General cited the two-step "reasonable classification" test applicable to Article 12(1) that had been outlined in ''Nguyen Tuong Van'' – that a differentiating measure in a statute is valid if:&lt;ref name="Yong Vui Kong 109"&gt;''Yong Vui Kong'' (substantive appeal), p. 536, para 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

*the classification is founded on an intelligible differentia; and
*the differentia bears a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the law in question.

The Attorney-General submitted that the 15-gram differentia was intelligible and bore a rational relation to the social purpose of the MDA: to have a deterrent effect on drug trafficking in or through Singapore by large-scale drug traffickers.&lt;ref name="Yong Vui Kong 109"/&gt;

==Decision==
===Article 9(1) challenge===
====Inhuman punishment argument====
The Court of Appeal noted that the definition of the word ''law'' in Article 2(1) of the Constitution includes "written law", which means that the MDA is law within the meaning of Article 9(1).&lt;ref&gt;''Yong Vui Kong'' (substantive appeal), pp. 499, para. 12; and p. 513, para. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this does not mean that all laws are justified whatever their nature. Laws which violate fundamental rules of natural justice, or those that are absurd or arbitrary cannot be considered law. The Court also held that all the cases which the appellant relied on concerned the offence of murder instead of drug-related offences. This being the case, "the rationale underlying those cases has no direct application to the present appeal".&lt;ref&gt;''Yong Vui Kong'' (substantive appeal), p. 514, para. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; It relied on the judgment of [[Kenneth Diplock, Baron Diplock|Lord Diplock]] in ''Ong Ah Chuan'' which stated that while it was possible for the offence of murder to be committed in the heat of the moment, it was "more theoretical than real in the case of large scale trafficking in drugs, a crime [for] which the motive is cold calculated greed".&lt;ref&gt;''Ong Ah Chuan'', [1981] A.C. at p. 674, cited in ''Yong Vui Kong'' (substantive appeal), p. 514, para. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court was of the opinion that the threshold of culpability in imposing the mandatory death penalty for drug-related offences was a matter of policy and was therefore a matter for legislation and not for the courts to decide.&lt;ref&gt;''Yong Vui Kong'' (substantive appeal), p. 514, para. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, apart from ''Mithu'', the cases cited such as ''Reyes'' and ''Woodson'' were decided in different textual contexts, as inhuman punishment was expressly prohibited by the constitutions of the respective jurisdictions from which the cases originated. Hence, those cases were strictly based on the issue of what kind of punishment would be considered inhuman and not directly related to the issue on appeal in ''Yong Vui Kong'', which was the meaning of the word ''law'' in Article 9(1) of the Singapore Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;''Yong Vui Kong'' (substantive appeal), pp. 514–515, para. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

As for ''Mithu'' itself, the Court held that there were three reasons for not adopting the reasoning of the Indian Supreme Court. First, the test for constitutional validity under Article 9(1) is different from the test applied to Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, which states: "No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law." The phrase ''procedure established by law'' means a "fair, just and reasonable procedure established by valid law".&lt;ref&gt;''Mithu'', para. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Mithu'', section 303 of the Indian Penal Code was found to infringe Article 21 as it did not satisfy this test. However, Singapore's Article 9(1) is worded differently, and does not specifically require that any law passed be "fair, just and reasonable" for it to be considered ''law''. The Court felt that the "fair, just and reasonable" test for constitutionality was too vague, as whether a law restricted the right to life or personal liberty according to such criteria would hinge on a court's view of the reasonableness of the law. In effect, the court would be intruding into the legislature's domain.&lt;ref&gt;''Yong Vui Kong'' (substantive appeal), p. 526–527, para. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondly, according to this interpretation of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution any law which removed judicial discretion would be unconstitutional. The result would be that all mandatory sentences would contravene Article 21. The Court of Appeal held that this was not the law applicable in Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;''Yong Vui Kong'' (substantive appeal), p. 527, para. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court was also of the opinion that in India Article 21 was given relative pride of place in its constitutional framework due to the "economic, social and political conditions prevailing in India and the pro-active approach of the Indian Supreme Court in matters relating to the social and economic conditions of the people of India". The situation in Singapore was different.&lt;ref&gt;''Yong Vui Kong'' (substantive appeal), p. 527, para. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the Court gave two reasons for declining to imply a provision against inhuman punishment into Article 9(1). Singapore's constitutional history was markedly different from that of other Commonwealth countries, and its Constitution does not contain express prohibitions against cruel and inhuman punishments as it is not modelled upon the [[European Convention on Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;''Yong Vui Kong'' (substantive appeal), pp. 519–520, para. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, in 1966 the [[Wee Chong Jin]] Constitutional Commission&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Report of the Constitutional Commission, 1966|location=Singapore|publisher=Government Printer|year=1966|oclc=51640681}}.&lt;/ref&gt; specifically considered whether to include a constitutional provision against inhuman punishment. However, the proposal was not taken up by the Government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore Hansard|mp=E.W. Barker|mplink=Edmund W. Barker|office=[[Ministry of Law (Singapore)|Minister for Law]] and [[Ministry of National Development (Singapore)|National Development]]|title=Constitutional Commission Report (Statement by the Minister for Law and National Development)|url=http://www.parliament.gov.sg/reports/private/hansard/title/19661221/19661221_S0003_T0013.htm|date=21 December 1966|volume=25|columns=1052–1053}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Yong Vui Kong'' (substantive appeal), p. 523, para. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Customary international law argument====
The Court of Appeal was of the opinion that customary international law cannot be incorporated into the meaning of the word ''law'' in Article 9(1) of the Constitution. Customary international law rules do not have any status in [[municipal law|domestic law]] until they are first accepted and adopted as part of domestic law. This can occur when a rule is incorporated into a statute (in which case it is no longer a customary international law rule but is regarded as domestic law), or when it is judicially declared to be part of the common law of Singapore. However, customary international law can only be incorporated into the common law when it is not inconsistent with existing domestic laws. Given the existence of the mandatory death penalty in several Singapore statutes, the Court was of the opinion that it could not treat the alleged customary international law rule prohibiting inhuman punishment as part of Singapore common law. Also, even if a rule has been incorporated in this manner, it may be overridden by subsequent inconsistent statutory provisions. Moreover, the Court did not accept the contention that customary international law should be conferred constitutional status by being read into the meaning of ''law'' in Article 9(1) as this is clearly not in accordance with the normal hierarchy of Singapore law.&lt;ref&gt;''Yong Vui Kong'' (substantive appeal), pp. 530–531, paras. 89–91.&lt;/ref&gt;

At any rate, whether there is in fact a customary international law rule that prohibits the mandatory death penalty is also far from certain. The Court held that there is a lack of extensive and uniform state practice that supports the contention that customary international law prohibits the mandatory death penalty as an inhuman punishment.&lt;ref&gt;''Yong Vui Kong'' (substantive appeal), pp. 531–534, paras. 93–99.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Article 12(1) challenge===
Agreeing with the Attorney General's submission, the Court of Appeal held that the mandatory death penalty satisfied the reasonable classification test used to assess the constitutionality of legislation with respect to Article 12(1) of the Constitution. Reiterating the Privy Council's holding in ''Ong Ah Chuan'', the Court found that the 15-gram differentia used in the MDA to determine whether the death penalty should be imposed could not be said to be purely arbitrary, and bore a rational relation to the social object of the MDA which was to prevent the growth of drug addiction in Singapore by stamping out the illicit drug trade. There was nothing unreasonable in the legislature concluding that a wholesale dealer operating higher up in the distributive pyramid required a stronger deterrent than smaller scale dealers. It was up to the legislature to determine where the appropriate quantitative boundary was to lie between the two classes of dealers. The Court also held that the quantity of addictive drugs trafficked was broadly proportionate to both the quantity of addictive drugs brought on to the market, as well as the likely harm suffered by society as a result of the offender's crime.&lt;ref&gt;''Yong Vui Kong'' (substantive appeal), p. 537, para. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, the court acknowledged that using a 15-gram differentia might not be the best method of furthering the social object of the MDA. However, the matter of what would constitute a better differentia was one which reasonable people may not necessarily agree on, and so this was a question of social policy best left to the legislature, not the judiciary.&lt;ref&gt;''Yong Vui Kong'' (substantive appeal), p. 537, para. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Addressing Yong's contention that in reality the mandatory death penalty only had a limited deterrent effect on drug traffickers, the Court said that it was not within the its purview to determine the mandatory death penalty's efficacy as a deterrent to drug trafficking. Such an issue was a question of policy and should be left to the legislature to decide. If any changes to the mandatory death penalty or the death penalty in general were to be effected, these had to be done by the legislature and not by the Judiciary under the pretence of constitutional interpretation. In addition, while the court acknowledged it could be argued that there was insufficient evidence of the mandatory death penalty's deterrent effect on serious offences like murder, it could also be said there was insufficient evidence that the mandatory death penalty did not have a deterrent effect.&lt;ref&gt;''Yong Vui Kong'' (substantive appeal), p. 537, paras. 117–118.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court disagreed with Yong's fifth argument that an offender who did not know the amount of pure diamorphine in the substance he was trafficking had not voluntarily assumed the risk of trafficking. A drug trafficker would know his act was illegal and that he would be punished if caught, regardless of his knowledge of the precise amount of pure diamorphine he was trafficking.&lt;ref&gt;''Yong Vui Kong'' (substantive appeal), p. 537, para. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; Yong's sixth argument was also dismissed, the Court explaining that the reason why the trafficking of a quantity of diamorphine greatly exceeding the 15-gram threshold did not incur a more severe sentence was because it would be impossible to impose a punishment more severe than the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;''Yong Vui Kong'' (substantive appeal), p. 537, para. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:New and old Supreme Court buildings, Singapore - 20100830-02.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Supreme Court of Singapore#Supreme Court Building|Supreme Court of Singapore]] ''(left)'', photographed in August 2010. In this month, the [[High Court of Singapore|High Court]] dismissed an application by Yong challenging the use of the [[President of Singapore|President]]'s [[pardon|clemency]] power. The judgment was affirmed by the [[Court of Appeal of Singapore|Court of Appeal]] in 2011.]]

===Judicial review of the granting of clemency===
Following the delivery of the Court of Appeal's judgment on 14 May 2010, Yong's lawyer M. Ravi filed an application in the High Court for leave to challenge the clemency process by way of [[judicial review]]. He sought, among other things, a [[declaration (law)|declaration]] that it is the President and not the [[Cabinet of Singapore|Cabinet]] that has discretion as to whether Yong's petition for clemency should be granted, and an order to grant Yong an indefinite stay of execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CommonLII|litigants=Yong Vui Kong v. Attorney-General|link=Yong Vui Kong v. Attorney-General|court=SGHC|year=2011|num=235|parallelcite=[2011] 1 S.L.R. 1 at 9, para. 9|courtname=H.C.|juris=Singapore}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Legal observers opined that the move was unprecedented, as petitions for judicial review are usually reserved for executive actions and not processes entrenched in the Constitution.&lt;ref name="ST 20100722"&gt;{{citation|author=Rachel Chang|title=Trafficker's lawyer files for judicial review|url=http://160.96.186.100/lib/pdf/2010/Jul/ST2219.pdf|format=PDF|newspaper=[[The Straits Times]] (reproduced on the Parliament Library website)|date=22 July 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The argument was based on comments by [[K. Shanmugam]], the [[Ministry of Law (Singapore)|Minister for Law]], at a dialogue session on 9 May 2010. When asked whether Yong's case would affect Singapore's laws on the mandatory death penalty, the Minister had replied: "Yong Vui Kong is young. But if we say, 'We let you go', what's the signal we're sending? ... We are sending a signal to all drug barons out there: Just make sure you choose a victim who's young or a mother of a young child and use them as the people to carry drugs into Singapore."&lt;ref name="ST 20100722"/&gt; Commenting to the media, Ravi said that if the clemency decision was indeed taken by the Cabinet and not the President, then since Shanmugam was a member of the Cabinet and these statements were made while Yong's case was ''[[sub judice]]'', his remarks implied a prejudgment of Yong's appeal for clemency.&lt;ref name="ST 20100722"/&gt; The Ministry of Law rejected as "incorrect" Ravi's remarks that the clemency process was flawed. It stated that as the [[Government of Singapore|Government]]'s policy on the death penalty for drug offences was a "matter of public importance", the Government was entitled to comment on it. The Law Ministry also clarified that Shanmugam's comments were merely concerned with the Government's legislative policy and whether it would change, and that the Minister had not commented on any specific issue which was before the Court of Appeal at the time, or on what the outcome of the judgment should be.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Zakir Hussain|title=Law Ministry rebuts lawyer's claim: Convicted drug trafficker's lawyer attributed comments to Law Minister he didn't make|url=http://160.96.186.100/lib/pdf/2010/Jul/ST1001.pdf|format=PDF|newspaper=The Straits Times (reproduced on the Parliament Library website)|date=10 July 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a judgment delivered on 13 August 2010, Justice [[Steven Chong]] dismissed the application, ruling that the power to grant a pardon lies with the Cabinet and not the President. This is because Article 21(1) of the Singapore Constitution provides that the President, by default, is to act in accordance with the advice of the Cabinet or a Minister acting under the general authority of the Cabinet, while Article 21(2) lays down an exhaustive range of exceptions from this rule. In situations where the President is empowered to act in his own discretion, the relevant constitutional provisions expressly use the phrase ''acting in his discretion'' in reference to the President. However, Article 22P states that the President may grant pardons "on the advice of the Cabinet", which indicates a contrary intention.&lt;ref&gt;''Yong Vui Kong v. AG'' (H.C.), pp. 31–34, paras. 69–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

The High Court also rejected Yong's request for an indefinite stay of execution. It held that the test of [[doctrine of bias in Singapore law|apparent bias]] that applies to the judiciary does not govern the executive, as the executive is accountable to the electorate through the [[elections in Singapore|election process]]. Furthermore, a court of law is restricted to considering only the law and facts in making its judgment, but the executive is entitled to "formulate and act in accordance with policy, which is wide-ranging by its very nature and difficult to evaluate in accordance with objective legal criteria".&lt;ref&gt;''Yong Vui Kong v. AG'' (H.C.), pp. 34–35, paras. 75–76.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 April 2011, the Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal filed by Yong against the judgment. It affirmed the High Court's view that the President did not possess any personal discretion when exercising the clemency power, and was required to act in accordance with Cabinet's advice on the matter. This conclusion was evident from the wording of Article 22P(1) of the Constitution, the legislative history of the clemency power in Singapore, relevant case law, and the nature of the President's power in the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CommonLII|litigants=Yong Vui Kong v. Attorney-General|link=Yong Vui Kong v. Attorney-General|court=SGCA|year=2011|num=9|parallelcite=[2011] 2 S.L.R. 1189 at 1261–1273, paras. 154–181|courtname=C.A.|juris=Singapore}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court also noted that both Yong and the Attorney-General agreed that the power of clemency was vested exclusively in the executive and was not justiciable on the merits, because of the doctrine of [[separation of powers in Singapore|separation of powers]] and established [[administrative law in Singapore|administrative law principles]].&lt;ref&gt;''Yong Vui Kong v. AG'' (C.A.), p. 1232, para. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the use of the power could be judicially reviewed if it was exercised in bad faith for an extraneous purpose, or in a way that contravened constitutional protections and rights.&lt;ref&gt;''Yong Vui Kong v. AG'' (C.A.), p. 1234, para. 80, citing ''Law Society of Singapore v. Tan Guat Neo Phyllis'' [2008] 2 S.L.R.(R.) 239 at 313, para. 149, H.C. (Singapore).&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Court was of the opinion that the clemency process could not be regarded as having been tainted by a reasonable suspicion of bias due to the Law Minister's remarks. The Minister had merely been setting out the Government's policy of taking a tough approach towards serious drug trafficking offences by imposing a mandatory death penalty as a deterrent. In any case, the rule against bias should not be applied to ministers making public statements on government policy in the same way as it applies to judicial or quasi-judicial officers, otherwise no minister would be able to speak on any policy in public or in [[Parliament of Singapore|Parliament]] without the statement being regarded as a predetermination of any decision relating to the policy that might have to be made subsequently. Even if the Law Minister's statements indicated that he intended not to grant clemency to Yong, this predetermination could not be attributed to other Cabinet ministers. The alternative view was untenable, as it would mean that once any minister spoke about the Government's policy on the death penalty in a way that showed predetermination of the issue, the entire Cabinet would be disentitled from advising the President on how he should exercise the clemency power.&lt;ref&gt;''Yong Vui Kong v. AG'' (C.A.), pp. 1246–1250, paras. 116–128.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Actions taken by Malaysian Government and civil society groups===
Yong's lawyer urged the [[Government of Malaysia]] to take Yong's case to the [[International Court of Justice]] to determine whether Singapore's conduct has violated local and [[public international law|international law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Elizabeth Looi|title=S'pore death row case: KL urged to act|url=http://160.96.186.100/lib/pdf/2010/Jun/ST1122.pdf|newspaper=The Straits Times (reproduced on the Parliament Library website)|format=PDF|date=11 June 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Malaysia)|Malaysian Foreign Minister]] [[Anifah Aman]] subsequently sent an appeal for clemency on Yong's behalf to the Singapore Government in July 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Zakir Hussain|title=Court hears judicial review bid|url=http://160.96.186.100/lib/pdf/2010/Jul/ST2927.pdf|format=PDF|newspaper=The Straits Times (reproduced on the Parliament Library website)|date=29 July 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Yong's case has aroused interest among Singaporean and Malaysian human rights activists. A [http://savevuikong.blogspot.com Save Vui Kong] campaign was formed jointly by the Civil Rights Committee of the Kuala Lumpur and Selangor Chinese Assembly Hall and human rights group [[SUARAM]]. On 24 August 2010, a petition calling on President [[Sellapan Ramanathan|S.R. Nathan]] to spare Yong's life – bearing 109,346 signatures gathered from petitioners in Sabah, other parts of Malaysia, Singapore, and online – was delivered to the [[Istana (Singapore)|Istana]], the President's official residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Zakir Hussain|author2=Rachel Lin|title=Petition to spare trafficker's life delivered to Istana|url=http://160.96.186.100/lib/pdf/2010/Aug/ST2513.pdf|format=PDF|newspaper=The Straits Times (reproduced on the Parliament Library website)|date=25 August 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
