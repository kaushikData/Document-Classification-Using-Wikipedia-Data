==The competition==
There were 14 clubs in the League for this season. During the course of the season each club plays each other home and away, for a total of 26 games. However, after Al Charara had all of its matches canceled by the [[Libyan Football Federation|LFF]], all teams played 24 games. At the end of season, the lowest two placed teams were automatically relegated to the [[Libyan Second Division]], with the winner of the [[Libyan Second Division|LSD]] automatically taking its place. However, because of the troubles of [[Al Charara]], three clubs were promoted from the Second Division for 2007/2008

{{Nihongo|'''Akio Mori'''|森 昭雄|Mori Akio|born February 5, 1947, in [[Hokkaidō]]}} is a Japanese [[physiology|physiologist]], [[sports science|sports scientist]] and writer. He is also the founder and the former head of the Japanese [[learned society]] {{Nihongo|Japanese Society of Health and Behavior Sciences|日本健康行動科学会|Nihon Kenkō Kodō Kagakukai}}.

Mori was originally known for his physiology researches, but began to write books about human [[neuroscience]], coining the term "[[game brain]]" in his 2002 book {{Nihongo|''Game Nō no Kyōfu''|ゲーム脳の恐怖|Gēmu Nō no Kyōfu|"The Fear of Game Brain"}}. He claimed that the brains of people who played video games were [[Brain damage|physically damaged]].&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/sci_tech/newsid_2119000/2119728.stm|title=Computer games 'make you moody'|work=[[CBBC]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=July 10, 2002|accessdate=August 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="smh"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/07/11/1026185079963.html|title=Video games cause irritability: study|first=Kenji|last=Hall|publisher=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=July 11, 2002|accessdate=August 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribune.ie/archive/article/2002/jul/28/official-video-games-are-bad-for-your-brain/ |title=Official: video games are bad for your brain |author=Bruch, Iain S. |publisher=[[Sunday Tribune]] |date=July 28, 2002 |accessdate=August 3, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Game Nō no Kyōfu'' received much attention from critics such as [[Tamaki Saitō]].&lt;ref name="asahi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publications.asahi.com/ronza/story/200702.shtml |script-title=ja:今月のおすすめ記事　2007年2月号 |author=Yamagata, Hiroo |publisher=[[Asahi Shimbun]] |date=February 2007 |accessdate=June 2, 2010 |language=Japanese }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mori's activities expanded into other genres such as journalism and politics due to the popularity of his books, though his theory about human brains was pointed out to be [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]]. Japanese critic [[Hiroo Yamagata]] compared the book ''Game Nō no Kyōfu'' with the following movement of ''[[Masaru Emoto|Messages from Water]]'' because those theories became popular via Japanese mass media without scientific backgrounds.&lt;ref name="asahi" /&gt;

On March 26, 2000, Mori was awarded the commendation certificate {{Nihongo|''Einen Kinzoku''|永年勤続|extra=lit. "Long-Year Working"}} by the Nihon University for working with the University for 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nihon-u.ac.jp/nunews/koho/kh467-09.htm |script-title=ja:平成１２年度永年・多年勤続者表彰式開催 |language=Japanese |publisher=[[Nihon University]] |accessdate=May 26, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609184717/http://www.nihon-u.ac.jp/nunews/koho/kh467-09.htm |archivedate=June 9, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also researched the human actions of sports such as [[kendo]] along with two other researchers, announcing the collaborative work "Two types of movement-related cortical potentials preceding wrist extension in humans" via the journal ''[[NeuroReport]]'' in July 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kita |first1=Yasunori |last2=Mori |first2=Akio |last3=Nara |first3=Masayuki |title=Two types of movement-related cortical potentials preceding wrist extension in humans |doi=10.1097/00001756-200107200-00035 |journal=NeuroReport |pmid=11447338 |year=2001 |volume=12 |issue=10 |pages=2221–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He established the Japanese Society of Health and Behavior Sciences in 2002, becoming the board chairperson of the society.&lt;ref name="rakuten" /&gt; It was later admitted as an associated party by the Japanese scientific organization, Science Council of Japan, on April 13, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onyx.dti.ne.jp/~jshbs/page/2006/index.html |script-title=ja:日本学術会議協力学術研究団体の称号の付与について |language=Japanese |author=Mori, Akio |work=Japanese Society of Health and Behavior Sciences |publisher=Dream Train Internet |date=May 2006 |accessdate=2010-07-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203053727/http://www.onyx.dti.ne.jp/~jshbs/page/2006/index.html |archivedate=February 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://head-hbs.w3.kanazawa-u.ac.jp/sub%20top.html |script-title=ja:理事長御挨拶 |author=Fujiwara, Katsuo |language=Japanese |work=Japanese Society of Health and Behavior Sciences |publisher=[[Kanazawa University]] |accessdate=2010-07-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722071813/http://head-hbs.w3.kanazawa-u.ac.jp/sub%20top.html |archivedate=July 22, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mori attained the degree of Doctor of Medicine, but did not become interested in researching the relationships between video games and human neuroscience until he met a [[programmer]] of computer software around 2000 when he made a new [[electroencephalography|electroencephalograph]].&lt;ref name="nhk" /&gt;

===2002–present: Literary career and political activities===
On July 10, 2002, the Japan Broadcast Publishing (or [[NHK]] Shuppan) published the independent book ''Game Nō no Kyōfu'', written by Mori, as a part of the {{Nihongo|''Seikatsujin Shinsho''|生活人新書||lit. "Life Human New Book"}} series. According to the 2006 interview to {{Nihongo|Shiro Hayashi|林 史郎|Hayashi Shirō}}, the chief editor of ''Seikatsujin Shinsho'', ''Game Nō no Kyōfu'' sold over 100,000 copies, becoming the best-selling book of the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kaze.shinshomap.info/interview/editor/12/01.html|title=売上げ好調は、"脳"とNHKならではの文化的テーマ|language=Japanese|publisher=Rensō Shuppan|date=December 22, 2006|accessdate=2010-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the book was translated into [[traditional Chinese characters]] under the title ''Xiao Xin Dian Wan Nao!'' in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yesasia.com/global/xiao-xin-dian-wan-nao/1004006668-0-0-0-en/info.html|title=Xiao Xin Dian Wan Nao!|publisher=[[YesAsia]]|accessdate=2010-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mori commenced research into the effects of video games on a child's mind.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt; He has cited various violent crime committed by juveniles who played video games to support his position. His position is that playing video games can cause damage to a child's brain, but the theory was heavily criticized.&lt;ref name="smh" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn2538-video-game-brain-damage-claim-criticised.html|title=Video game "brain damage" claim criticised|publisher=[[New Scientist]]|first=Helen|last=Phillips|date=July 11, 2002|accessdate=2008-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Mori also claimed that the brains of people who used [[mobile e-mail]]s were also damaged, calling those {{Nihongo|"mail brain"|メール脳|mēru nō}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tokyo-np.co.jp/00/dgi/20040930/ftu_____dgi_____000.shtml|script-title=ja:痴呆のような『メール脳』　中高生の脳波調査　森・日大教授が指摘|language=Japanese|author=Takii, Hiroomi|publisher=Tokyo Shimbun|date=September 30, 2004|accessdate=2010-08-03|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041009214945/http://www.tokyo-np.co.jp/00/dgi/20040930/ftu_____dgi_____000.shtml|archivedate=October 9, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 19, 2004, the [[Computer Entertainment Supplier's Association]] announced that the neuroscientific works of Mori and [[Ryuta Kawashima]] about video games had insufficient evidence to claim something.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gamez.itmedia.co.jp/games/gsnews/0410/20/news07.html|title=CESA「ゲーム脳」に対する調査報告書を公開|language=Japanese|work=[[SoftBank|SoftBank Games]]|publisher=ITmedia|date=October 20, 2004|accessdate=2010-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, however, Mori and Kawashima took part in a series of convocations, held by the [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (Japan)|Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan]] as a part of its activities for creating its guidelines of Japanese schools' operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mext.go.jp/b_menu/shingi/chousa/koutou/027/siryo/06021607/074/007.htm|title=&lt;nowiki&gt;平成17年度学校法人の運営等に関する協議会配付資料 ［初児－4］ 5 検討会の検討内容等&lt;/nowiki&gt;|publisher=[[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (Japan)|Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology]]|accessdate=2010-07-27|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Mori's book {{Nihongo|''Genki na Nō no Tsukurikata: Ningen Rashisa o Hagukunde Suteki na Otona ni Narutameni''|元気な脳のつくりかた―人間らしさを育んで、すてきな大人になるために||"The Way to Make the Healthy Brains: For Nurturing Humanities and Becoming Beautiful Adults"}}, published on August 1, 2006, was selected as the Japan National Council of [[Parent-Teacher Association]]'s "recommended book" at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schoolpress.co.jp/book/others/nou.htm|script-title=ja:元気な脳のつくりかた|language=Japanese|publisher=Juniors' Visual Journal|accessdate=2010-08-02|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061010080851/http://www.schoolpress.co.jp/book/others/nou.htm|archivedate=October 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mori also recommend Iida Denshi's ''Nōchō'' series highly as intelligible goods with his research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.i-da.co.jp/brain00/|script-title=ja:飯田電子設計 脳聴シリーズ 説明|publisher=Iida Denshi|accessdate=2010-06-01|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series are CDs recording the speeches such as [[Heart Sutra]] and won the creative award at the ''Utsukushima Monozukuri'' awards presented by [[Fukushima Prefecture]] in January 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.i-da.co.jp/brain/|script-title=ja:飯田電子設計株式会社 脳聴|publisher=Iida Denshi|accessdate=2010-06-01|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Mori resigned from the head of the Japanese Society of Health and Behavior Sciences, being replaced by Shinji Murakami of [[Hokkaido University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andrew.ac.jp/Law/teachers/web-hitotaka/taikai/p_01.html |script-title=ja:日本健康行動科学会 第8回学術大会 |language=Japanese |author=Takahashi, Hitomi |work=Japanese Society of Health and Behavior Sciences |publisher=[[Momoyama Gakuin University]] |year=2009 |accessdate=2010-08-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612205243/http://www.andrew.ac.jp/Law/teachers/web-hitotaka/taikai/p_01.html |archivedate=June 12, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 16, 2008, ''Senichi Club'', a communication club comprising the readers of ''Sekai Nippō'', the Japanese division of the [[News World Communications|World Times]], invited Mori over a lecture meeting at [[Shibuya, Tokyo|Shibuya]], in which Mori cited [[India]] as an advanced country of information technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://senichi-club.jp/modules/eguide/event.php?eid=16 |title=2008-04-16 (水) 【世日クラブ講演会】教育に見る日本の危機 |publisher=Senichi Club |accessdate=2010-05-31 |language=Japanese }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the professors in different fields such as literatures took part in the brain science when the theory of game brain was becoming popular, the Japan Neuroscience Society announced the new ethical code on January 8, 2010, seeking the scientific sources against the groundless theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://osaka.yomiuri.co.jp/science/news/20100111-OYO8T00505.htm |script-title=ja:「ゲーム脳」など脳研究で俗説、倫理指針を改定…神経科学学会 |language=Japanese |publisher=[[Yomiuri Shimbun]] |date=January 9, 2010 |accessdate=2010-05-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115142747/http://osaka.yomiuri.co.jp/science/news/20100111-OYO8T00505.htm |archivedate=January 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yomidr.yomiuri.co.jp/page.jsp?id=19927 |script-title=ja:気になる！　見極め大切、脳科学神話 |language=Japanese |author=Sugimori, Jun |publisher=[[Yomiuri Shimbun]] |date=January 22, 2010 |accessdate=2010-06-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727235851/http://www.yomidr.yomiuri.co.jp/page.jsp?id=19927 |archivedate=July 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Asheville-Weaverville Speedway''' near [[Weaverville, North Carolina|Weaverville]], [[North Carolina]], [[United States|USA]] was considered to be site for the old-school [[NASCAR]] races in both the ''Grand National'' and the ''Winston Cup'' eras (which is now known as the ''[[Monster Energy Cup Series]]''). None of the active drivers that are in the Sprint Cup Series today have ever raced at Asheville-Weaverville Speedway. Even some of the legends like [[Darrell Waltrip]] and [[Kyle Petty]] have never raced on the track due to the timing of their careers. From [[1951 in NASCAR|1951]] to [[1969 in NASCAR|1969]], the race course offered some wins from drivers like [[Richard Petty]], Bob Flock, Fonty Flock, Lee Petty, and a win by Fireball Roberts. As a dirt [[oval track racing|oval track]], the speedway helped served its purpose during the dirt-dominated formative years of what is now called the ''NASCAR Sprint Cup Series''.  The track was later paved over.  Other NASCAR legends like [[Banjo Matthews]], [[Ralph Earnhardt]], [[Junior Johnson]], and [[Cotton Owens]] had made notable appearances here.

The track was closed from the 1970s to racing, until North Buncombe High School was built on the property of the former track. In the 1970s and 1980s the track was used as softball fields and sports practice fields. The track itself had been disabled by first placing earthen barriers on opposite sides of the track, and later, concrete barriers at 8 locations around the track.

An anti-noise ordinance was used to shut down the track after years of racing; this fight was staged as early as the [[1970 in NASCAR|1970 racing season]] when a group of citizens petitioned their city council to shut down the track. Originally, the objectors were [[hotel]] operators but 75% of people who read the [[Asheville Citizen-Times|Asheville Citizen]] wanted that track to be closed in a poll done in the summer of 1987.  However, by that time, the track had already been physically disabled for racing purposes. [[Urbanization]] and progress forced the property to be closed, demolished, and re-zoned for educational purposes.

The property is now occupied by [[North Buncombe High School]] with 1117 students.

==New Asheville Speedway==
The Asheville-Weaverville Speedway is not to be confused with the "New Asheville Speedway", which was located on Amboy Road in [[Asheville, North Carolina|Asheville]], approximately 20 miles south of the Asheville-Weaverville Speedway. This track was closed after zoning ordinances forced the track owners to sell the track to the River-Link Organization, an organization that promoted making the French Broad River area of Asheville a public park.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4172">The '''Association of Cricket Umpires and Scorers''' (commonly abbreviated as the ACU&amp;S) was established in 1953 by the umpire Tom Smith as the Association of Cricket [[Umpire (cricket)|Umpires]] (the [[scorer]]s were included in the title several years later), in order to provide training and advice to [[cricket]] officials. It had a membership exceeding 8,000 in countries all over the world before it was merged with the ECB Officials Association on 1 January 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecb.co.uk/ecb/ecb-association-of-cricket-officials/about-us ECB ACO] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316130540/http://www.ecb.co.uk/ecb/ecb-association-of-cricket-officials/about-us |date=2015-03-16 }} About us (''history of the ACU&amp;S included'')&lt;/ref&gt;

The ACU&amp;S also had the duty of assigning qualified umpires and scorers to cricket matches around the world. It was funded by membership fees, sponsorship, advertising in its quarterly newsletter ''How's That'' and the profits from selling official umpire and scorer accessories and clothing.

==Merger==
In December 2007 the membership of the ACU&amp;S voted (67% for, 33% against on a low turnout) to merge with the [[England and Wales Cricket Board|ECB]] Officials Association [ECB OA].&lt;ref&gt;Former ACUS website {{cite web|url=http://www.acus.org.uk |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-12-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051215051022/http://www.acus.org.uk/ |archivedate=2005-12-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This ended a period of uncertainty during which various claims were made both about the Association's financial stability and its internal governance. This new organisation eventually became the ECB [[Association of Cricket Officials]]. The move was criticised by some who viewed it a cynical move by the ECB as a means to secure additional funding by Sport England as well as by overseas members who believed that an organisation under the auspices of the ECB would not have the same interest in them as the ACU&amp;S, which had supported members across the world. Supporters of the merger argued that integration with the ECB would raise the profile of umpiring and scoring, provide much needed funds, improve training and put an end to the multitude of official bodies that had begun after alleged irregularities in administration had come to light.  This aspiration to improve training must sound rather hollow now ECB no longer examines candidates for knowledge of the Laws of Cricket. 5 Gloucestershire Association of Cricket Umpires and Scorers minutes 18 November 2017.

==Association textbook==
The textbook, ''Cricket Umpiring and Scoring'', was first published in 1957 under the authorship of Colonel [[Rowan Rait Kerr]]. Later editions were edited by Tom Smith, [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]]. Later revisions were undertaken by Sheila Hill, MBE, and Robbie Robins in about 1992, when the name was changed to ''Tom Smith's Cricket Umpiring and Scoring'' at the suggestion of Colin Pearson as a permanent honour to the founder. The changes to the [[Laws of cricket]] in 2000 required a substantial re-write and this was undertaken by Colin Edwards, Graeme Lowrie (NZ) and Graham Cooper. The new edition was published by [[Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson]] in 2004.

Shortly before merging to form the ECB ACO, the copyright to the textbook was transferred by the ACU&amp;S to [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC), who continue to update it; Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson also continue to publish it.&lt;ref&gt;MCC (2011) ''Tom Smith's Cricket Umpiring and Scoring'' p ''xi''  {{ISBN|978-0-297-86641-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Barrmill Stadium''' formerly '''Galston Greyhound Stadium''' is a football ground and former greyhound stadium in Barrmill Road, [[Galston, East Ayrshire]], [[Scotland]].

The football ground is situated on the south bank of the [[River Irvine]] and used by Galston United AFC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.east-ayrshire.gov.uk/Resources/PDF/E/EASCSportsClubDirectory2013.pdf/|title=East Ayrshire Sports Council Club Directory 2013.|publisher=East Ayrshire Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium was formerly a greyhound track known as Galston Greyhound Stadium&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.old-maps.co.uk/#/Map/250471/636827/12/100954|title=OS Plan 1964-1965|publisher=old-maps.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the circuit was 350 yards in circumference. 
The racing was independent (unlicensed) and started on 9 June 1933. Race distances were 280 and 450 yards with an inside hare. 
The schedule of Thursday and Saturday night racing came to an end in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnes|first=Julia|title=Daily Mirror Greyhound Fact File|page =417|year=1988|publisher=Ringpress Books|isbn=0-948955-15-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Bhutan]]''' competed at the '''[[2004 Summer Olympics]]''' in [[Athens]], [[Greece]], from 13 to 29 August 2004. This was the nation's sixth consecutive appearance at the Olympics.

[[Bhutan Olympic Committee]] sent two athletes to compete only in both men's and women's individual archery. Bhutan had been given wild cards for both events, to ensure that all 204 National Olympic Committees could take part even if no athletes had qualified.

[[File:A modern Cricket bat (back view).jpg|thumb|A modern [[Sanspareils Greenlands|SG]] cricket bat (back view)]]
A '''cricket bat''' is a specialised piece of equipment used by [[batsmen]] in the sport of [[cricket]] to hit the [[cricket ball|ball]], typically consisting of a cane handle attached to a flat-fronted [[willow]]-wood blade. The length of the bat may be no more than 38 inches (965&amp;nbsp;mm) and the width no more than 4.25 inches (108&amp;nbsp;mm). Its use is first mentioned in 1624. Since 1979, a [[Dennis Lillee#Aluminium bat incident|rule change]] stipulated that bats can only be made from wood.

==Construction==
[[File:Pod shaving of cricket bat by hands.jpg|thumb|Shaving a cricket bat]]
The ''blade'' of a cricket bat is a wooden block that is generally flat on the striking face and with a ridge on the reverse (back) which concentrates wood in the middle where the ball is generally hit.  The bat is traditionally made from [[willow]] wood, specifically from a variety of white willow called cricket bat willow (''[[Salix alba]]'' var. ''caerulea''), treated with raw (unboiled) [[linseed oil]], which has a protective function. This variety of willow is used as it is very tough and shock-resistant, not being significantly dented nor splintering on the impact of a cricket ball at [[Fast bowling|high speed]], while also being light in weight. The face of the bat is often covered with a protective film by the user.

The blade is connected to a long cylindrical [[Arundo|cane]] ''handle'', similar to that of a mid-20th-century [[tennis racquet]], by means of a ''splice''. The handle is usually covered with a rubber grip. Bats incorporate a wooden spring design where the handle meets the blade. The current design of a cane handle spliced into a willow blade through a ''tapered'' splice was the invention in the 1880s of [[Charles Richardson (civil engineer)|Charles Richardson]], a pupil of [[Marc Isambard Brunel|Brunel]] and the first Chief Engineer of the [[Severn Tunnel|Severn Railway Tunnel]].&lt;ref name="Richardson" &gt;{{cite book|chapter=Severn Tunnel (1)|title=Track Topics, A GWR Book of Railway Engineering|page=179|publisher=[[Great Western Railway]]|origyear=1935 |year=1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

  |page=56
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spliced handles had been used before this but tended to break at the corner of the join. The taper provides a more gradual transfer of load from the bat's blade to the handle and avoids this problem.

The edges of the blade closest to the handle are known as the ''shoulders'' of the bat, and the bottom of the blade is known as the ''toe'' of the bat.

Bats were not always this shape. Before the 18th century bats tended to be shaped similarly to a modern [[hockey stick]]s. This may well have been a legacy of the game's reputed origins. Although the first forms of cricket are obscure, it may be that the game was first played using [[shepherd's crook]]s.
[[File:Historical cricket bat art.jpg|thumb|right|Evolution of the cricket bat]]

The bat generally recognised as the oldest bat still in existence is dated 1729 and is on display in the Sandham Room at [[The Oval]] in London.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

===Maintenance===
When first purchased, most bats are not ready for immediate use and require [[knocking-in]] to allow the soft fibres to strike a hard new cricket ball without causing damage to the bat, and allowing full power to be transferred to the shot. Knocking-in involves striking the surface with an old cricket ball or a special [[mallet]]. This compacts the soft fibres within the bat and reduces the risk of the bat snapping. The bat may also need raw linseed oil, which fills in the gaps between the fibres.&lt;ref name=bbcbatcare&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/rules_and_equipment/4177896.stm |title=Cricket equipment: Caring for your kit |work=BBC Sport |date= 26 August 2005|accessdate=14 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sizes of bats==
[[Laws of cricket#Equipment and laying out the pitch|Law 5]] of the [[Laws of Cricket]],&lt;ref name="law5"/&gt; as the rules of the game are known, state that the length of the bat may be no more than 38 in (965&amp;nbsp;mm), the width no more than 4.25 in (108&amp;nbsp;mm), the overall depth no more than 2.64 in (67&amp;nbsp;mm) and edge no more than 1.56 in (40&amp;nbsp;mm). Bats typically weigh from 2&amp;nbsp;lb 7 oz to 3&amp;nbsp;lb (1.2 to 1.4&amp;nbsp;kg) though there is no standard.  Appendix B of the Laws of Cricket set out more precise specifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Lords.org – Marylebone Cricket Club |url=https://www.lords.org/mcc/laws-of-cricket/laws/appendix-b-law-5-the-bat/ |title= Appendix B – The bat |publisher=Lords.org |date= |accessdate=1 October 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This rule was introduced following the [[Monster Bat Incident 1771|Monster Bat Incident of 1771]].

Bats are available in a range of sizes, with some manufacturers offering unique variations. Commonly found are children's sizes 0 to 6, youth size Harrow and adult sizes. SH (Short Handle) is the most common adult size, whilst long handle and long blade options are also available. Children's sizes increase in length and width as the size increase. Although most adult bats will be the maximum width permitted (4.25 inches), no generally available cricket bat is the maximum length of 38 inches, indeed very few exceed 35 inches.

== Variations ==
[[Image:Oldest cricket bat.JPG|250px|thumb|right|The oldest surviving bat dates from [[1726 to 1775 in sports|1729]]. Note its shape, which is very different from modern-day bats.]]
[[File:Pm cricket shots09 6037.jpg|thumb|right|Modern cricket bat in play]]
Various companies have over the years tried new shapes that come within the laws of the game to make a name for themselves and to improve sales. In the 1960s the first shoulderless bats appeared from [[Slazenger]]. This allowed more of the weight to be redistributed to the "sweet spot" of the blade providing more power to each stroke, whilst still having good balance and light "pick up."  This style of bat was made famous by [[Lance Cairns]]'s six sixes in a match played in 1983.

The 1970s saw double-sided bats from Warsop Stebbing.  With the advent of Twenty-Twenty cricket, double-sided bats are experiencing renewed interest.{{CN|date=February 2016}}

In 1974 the first GN100 Scoop was released; this was the first bat to turn shaping on its head by removing the wood from the centre of the rear of the bat. By removing this wood, the bat became lighter, its sweet spot grew and its pick up improved.  Even though there is less material, strong strokes are still possible if well-timed.  It allows weaker players to play many strokes they would otherwise omit from their repertoire.{{CN|date=February 2016}}

This bat quickly became a big seller and various scooped bats such as the GN500, Dynadrive and Viper have been released by Gray Nicolls ever since, including a re-release of the Scoop itself for the 2012 English season. The removal of wood from the rear has been copied by many other companies without much critical acclaim.

In 1979 Australian cricketer [[Dennis Lillee]] briefly used a [[Aluminium cricket bat|ComBat aluminium metal bat]]. After some discussion with the umpires, and after complaints by the English team that it was damaging the ball, which was later proved untrue, he was urged by the Australian captain [[Greg Chappell]] to revert to a wooden bat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/4472297.stm |work=BBC Sport |title=Bat maker defends graphite innovation |date=11 April 2005 |accessdate=14 November 2010 |first=Oliver |last=Brett}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rules of cricket were shortly thereafter amended, stating that the blade of a bat must be made entirely of wood.&lt;ref name="law5"&gt;{{cite web |author=Lords.org – Marylebone Cricket Club |url=https://www.lords.org/mcc/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-5-the-bat/ |title=Law 5: Bats |publisher=Lords.org |date=1 October 2017 |accessdate=1 October 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 [[Kookaburra Sport|Kookaburra]] released a new type of bat that had a [[Carbon fibre-reinforced polymer]] support down the spine of the bat.  It was put on the bat to provide more support to the spine and blade of the bat, thus prolonging the life of the bat.  The first player to use this new bat in international cricket was Australian [[Ricky Ponting]].  Kookaburra withdrew it after advice was received by the [[International Cricket Council|ICC]] from MCC that it was illegal under Law six.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://netcomposites.com/news/2006/october/03/icc-and-kookaburra-agree-to-withdrawal-of-carbon-bat/ |title=ICC and Kookaburra Agree to Withdrawal of Carbon Bat |publisher=NetComposites |date=19 February 2006 |accessdate=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2005 Newbery created a carbon fibre handle, the C6 and C6+, which weighed 3 ounces/85 grams less than a standard laminated cane and rubber handle. It was used by Newbery and Puma for 3 years before the concept was copied by Gray Nicolls with a hollow plastic tube. However, this provoked the MCC to change the law on materials in handles amid fears that the new technology would lead to an increase in the distance the ball was hit. Now only 10% of the volume of the handle can be other than cane.

Also in late 2008, SAFBats created a cricket bat with an offset edge, the edge offsetting allowed for an extended middle, better swing weight and increased performance without compromising the cricket bat's balance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.batscricket.com |title=Handmade Cricket Bats – Handcrafted from English willow by SAFBats |publisher=Batscricket.com |date= |accessdate=26 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130807002057/http://www.batscricket.com/ |archivedate=7 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The production models were available in 2009, and the bat won awards in 2010 and 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.safbats.co.uk/BAT-BLOG/cricket-bat/t20-cricket-bats-and-the-low-toe-theory |title=Handmade Cricket Bats – Handcrafted from English willow by SAFBats |publisher=Safbats.co.uk |date= |accessdate=26 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Twenty20 bats===
In 2004 Newbery created the Uzi, with a truncated blade and elongated handle for the new [[Twenty20]] format of the game. This change allowed more wood to be placed in the middle, as more attacking shots are played in the shorter version of the game.

In 2009 an extreme version of the Newbery Uzi shape named the Mi3 was launched by Mongoose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/8064653.stm |title= Cricket gets to grip with a new bat |publisher=BBC News |date= 22 May 2009|accessdate=17 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design is unusual in that the blade is 33% shorter than a conventional bat and the handle is 43% longer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2009/may/27/mongoose-bat-twenty20-stuart-law |title=Mongoose mayhem beastly for bowlers |publisher=guardian.co.uk |date= 27 May 2009|accessdate=17 September 2009 | location=London | first=Andy | last=Bull}}&lt;/ref&gt; Launched with a fanfare of publicity it proclaimed the idea of not defending the ball in the T20 format and purely playing attacking shots.

On 11 March 2010, Mongoose launched its range in India with the announcement of [[Matthew Hayden]] as the brand ambassador.&lt;ref name=Zee&gt;{{cite web|title=Hayden launches Mongoose bat|url=http://zeenews.india.com/sports/cricket/hayden-launches-mongoose-bat_28159.html|publisher=[[Zee News]]|accessdate=26 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stuart Law]], the former Australian Test player, called it "a half-brick on a stick".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/sport/cricket/taking-the-long-handle-could-this-bat-really-revolutionisecricket/2009/05/28/1243456683523.html |title=Taking the long handle: could this bat really revolutionise cricket? |publisher=smh.com.au |date= 29 May 2009|accessdate=20 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bat was used by Anuraag in the 2010 version of the [[2010 IPL|IPL]]. [[Gareth Andrew]], the Worcestershire all-rounder, scored the maiden 100 with an MMi3 in professional cricket, when he hit 100 off 58 balls at the Oval in 2010 against Surrey.

In 2008 Lekka Cricket launched a T20 format bat, the Big Hitter. Black Cat Cricket then launched a T20 format bat, the Joker, in 2009. These worked on a similar principle to other T20 bats with the blade length reduced by one inch and an inch longer handle, but uniquely reduced the width of the bat to 4 inches in an adult bat.

==Manufacturing==

Modern bats are usually hand made in Sialkot, Pakistan and India due to the low cost of labour. However a few specialists in England, Australia, and New Zealand still make bats, mostly with use of a [[CNC lathe]].{{CN|date=September 2015}}

=== Knocking-in ===
Before first being played, a bat should be "knocked in". Knocking a bat in compresses the surface wood fibres and allows it to be ready for use, as most brand-new bats will crack or badly dent if used in competition without being knocked-in. This is usually done after purchase, although some are sold ready-knocked.

The process begins with the application of a layer of [[linseed oil]] to the surface of the bat, after which a worn-down 'soft' leather [[cricket ball]] or a specialised mallet may be used to repeatedly hit the face of the bat. After three to four hours of knocking in, another layer of linseed oil may be applied. At this stage, the bat may be used in light practice but should not be used in competition without another few hours of knocking-in. The splice of the bat should not be knocked as this will cause the bat to "jar". After being properly knocked in, the wood will make a slightly higher-pitched sound when hitting the ball and will feel softer to use. 

During the knocking-in process, a fingernail is pressed into the front face of the bat to check if the bat is properly knocked in. If an indentation is left on the bat during this process, it shows that the wood is still not fully compressed, and should be knocked in for longer.

Many large sports stores and specialised cricket stores use special machines to knock in the bats for customers. Some manufacturers will roll the bats through a special press to compress the wood, however many bat manufacturers choose not to do this as the spring may be rolled as well, causing ''jarring''. Many bats that claim to be pre-knocked-in by the manufacturer should be manually knocked in anyway as this claim is not a guarantee that the bat is ready to be used in competition.

=== Oiling ===
A traditional wooden bat has its surface oiled with [[raw linseed oil]] before play, and regularly during the season. This has a protective effect on the wood, and also makes it less sensitive to humidity changes in the atmosphere, which could cause warping or splitting. Another important factor is that it increases the surface friction of the ball to bat surface, giving better control of the shot. A worn surface can be noticed by the player, indicating that re-oiling is needed.&lt;ref &gt;{{Cite web
  |title=Caring for your Bat
  |website=Gunn &amp; Moore
  |url=http://www.gm-cricket.com/pages/bat-care.aspx
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raw linseed oil is used, rather than [[boiled linseed oil]], as the raw form is not a [[drying oil]] to the same degree, and so the surface remains tacky.

Some bats are plastic-coated or other otherwise sealed on the surface and either cannot be oiled, or do not require oiling until this coating begins to wear off.

==Cricket bat industry of India==
Traditional Indian cricket bats are made in [[India]], in the regions of [[Jammu and Kashmir]], [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], Haryana, [[Gujarat]], Uttar Pradesh and [[Rajasthan]].{{CN|date=May 2015}} In Kashmir it is made out of [[willow]] found in northern India, whereas trees like [[Teak wood|teak]] and saal wood are used in making these bats in north-western region of country. Some bats made in Kashmir are of international standards and are/were used by many national players in India such as [[Sunil Gavaskar]], [[Virender Sehwag]] and [[Yuvraj Singh]]. Bats made in other regions are generally of lower quality, and mainly used in non-professional cricket games, such as [[tennis ball cricket]], which are played in streets and neighbourhoods across India.

===Kashmiri willow bats===

The willow used in making these bats was brought in by the British, who ruled [[India]], during the 1820s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sgcricket.com/bats.html |title=Cricket Bats |publisher=Sgcricket.com |date= |accessdate=9 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712201050/http://www.sgcricket.com/bats.html |archivedate=12 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The industry, established in Kashmir, combines traditional tools with modern technology.

Kashmiri bats require constant knocking and oiling to make the bat good enough to use in a cricket match. Knocking makes the fibres of the willow blade compress together, which helps the bat bear the impact of the [[cricket ball|ball]]. Another major aspect of taking care of such bats is oiling. Oil is applied on the back, toe, front and edges of the bat to make it more durable and to ensure the fibres get knitted properly.{{citation needed|reason=proper knitting|date=June 2016}} Some of the districts where these bats are made in Kashmir are [[Anantnag]], [[Baramula]], and [[Pahalgam]].[[File:Kashmir willow Cricket Bat.jpg|alt=Kashmir Willow Cricket Bat|thumb|Kashmir Willow Cricket Bat]]

[[File:Banc de déclenchement Omega 1948.jpg|thumb|An [[Omega SA|Omega]] FAT device of 1948, containing four chronometers started by a starting gun and stopped by a photocell.]][[File:LightBeamTiming.jpg|thumb|Light beam timing system (the two lenses extended to the right of the stand)]]

'''Fully automatic time''' (abbreviated '''FAT''') is a form of [[racing|race]] timing in which the clock is automatically activated by the starting device, and the finish time is either automatically recorded, or timed by analysis of a [[photo finish]]. The system is commonly used in [[track and field athletics|track and field]] as well as [[horse racing]], [[Greyhound racing|dog racing]], [[bicycle racing]], [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]] and [[auto racing]]. In these fields a photo finish is used. It is also used in competitive [[swimming (sport)|swimming]], for which the swimmers themselves record a finish time by touching a touchpad at the end of a race. In order to verify the equipment, or in case of failure, a backup system (typically manual) is usually used in addition to FAT.&lt;ref&gt;For example the [[USA Swimming]] [http://www.usaswimming.org/USASWeb/_Rainbow/Documents/6d2c5425-0029-4a35-b69a-ced23305db8a/a-CHAPTER%209%20Timing%20%20October%202006.pdf Guide to Officiating] requires that "[...] (because of the potential for failure) and always to verify proper operation, all times from electronic timing equipment (whether touchpads or buttons) must both be verified and backed-up by another timing system. The backup must always include at least one stopwatch."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==
In races started by a [[starting gun]], a [[sensor]] is typically attached to the gun which sends an electronic signal to the timing system when fired. An alternative starting light or sound which is electronically triggered, such as a horn, is typically also wired to the timing system. In sports that involve a finish line that is crossed (rather than a touch finish, as in swimming), the current finishing system is a photo finish which is then analysed by judges.

===Line-scan cameras===
The current photo-finish system used in [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] competition, as well as other top-level events uses a [[Digital camera#Line-scan camera systems|digital line-scan camera]] aimed straight along the finish line. TimeTronics, FinishLynx and Omega are examples of commercial timing systems commonly used in athletic competitions. These cameras have an image field only a few pixels wide, with a single frame forming a narrow image only of the finish line, and anything which is crossing it. During a race, the camera takes images at an extremely high frame rate (the exact rate depends on the system, but can be in the thousands of lines per second). Computer software then arranges these frames horizontally to form a [[Panorama|panoramic]] image which effectively displays a graph of the finish line (and anything crossing it) as time passes, with time denoted on the horizontal axis.

Before the advent of digital photography, (and still available as an alternative), a similar [[photographic film|film]]-based system was used, consisting of a slit which a strip of film is advanced past at a constant rate to produce a similar panoramic image to the digital system. A flashing LED embedded the time calibration to the film.

===Full-frame cameras===
Recently, there have been significant advances in full-frame video timing which utilizes a full sensor array rather than a single line. This has followed from the advent of low-cost machine vision technologies which has made possible systems that surpass 1/100 second time resolution. Previously, the NTSC television standard limited most VHS and SVHS, and digital frame rates to 59.94 frames per second (limiting the timing resolution to .016 seconds). Many modern systems, such as those manufactured by FlashTiming, are capable of frame rates of 120 frames per second at higher spatial resolution and in a purely digital regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flashtiming.com |title=FlashTiming-Your Fully Automatic Timing Resource |publisher=Flashtiming.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The addition of computer based analysis tools has greatly simplified and made efficient the process of timing races, as well as automated some portions of timing labor such with features such as motion detection and bookmarking of finish times. Due to these developments and the lower cost compared with line-scan systems, video timing has seen some limited level of adoption at a few high-school and collegiate events. The inability of these systems to perform what is known as a "zero control test" means that they do not comply with the requirements of the IAAF or other national governing bodies to be classified as fully automatic timing (FAT).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iaaf.org/download/download?filename=7c4c7e46-8979-453d-a355-a736fdac2281.pdf&amp;urlslug=Competition%20Rules%202012-13&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other timing systems===
There are also similar timing systems that use the simple process of breaking a beam of light. While such systems are frequently used to provide instant results (for the media), the object they are timing is more difficult to define.

==Use in athletics==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1987-0822-034, Sabine Busch, Cornelia Ulrich.jpg|thumb|right|An example of a photographic automatic timed race: [[Sabine Busch]], right, wins with 53.24s and [[Cornelia Ullrich]] comes second with 53.55s.]]
[[File:TV-icon-2.svg|thumb|110px|'''Official Olympic {{YouTube|gn3hMAvOYfQ}} shows 1968 timing system and process @ 7:19''']]
According to the [[IAAF]], any record in athletics ([[world records in athletics|world]], Olympic, or national) or qualifying time for Olympic Games or World Championships set in a [[Sprint (running)|sprint]] event must be timed by a FAT system to be valid.

Hand times, those with humans operating the stopping and/or starting mechanisms, are highly prone to error. By rule, they are only accurate to a tenth (.1) of a second, so all 100ths of a second beyond zero must be rounded to the next highest tenth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iaaf.org/mm/Document/Competitions/TechnicalArea/05/47/81/20091027115916_httppostedfile_CompRules2010_web_26Oct09_17166.pdf IAAF Rulebook Rule 165 10a]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many track and field statisticians use a conversion factor estimate of 0.24 seconds added to any hand-timed mark in the [[100 m]] or [[200 m]] event, and 0.14 seconds to any hand-timed mark in the [[400 m]] or longer event. These conversion factors are only applicable for comparing marks from a variety of sources, but are not acceptable for record purposes. In the case of comparing an adjusted manual time to FAT timing, an original FAT time being equivalent, the FAT time will be considered more accurate, and thus the athlete will be given the higher seed, or comparison ranking. This old method of converting times dates back to when FAT systems were much less common.&lt;ref&gt;Track &amp; Field  News, Little Green Book, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; They are increasingly less acceptable even at low level meets and are no longer acceptable at the upper level of the sport.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.whsaa.org/forms/E15-E16.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Fully automatic timing did not become mandatory for world records until 1 January 1977.

The first known time with an auto timing device in the Olympic Games was in the steeplechase in 1928, won by Loukola in 9:21.60 (9:21 4/5 official hand time). The device used was the Löbner camera-timer.

In 1932 three systems were used: official hand timing, hand started photo-finish times, and the [[Gustavus Town Kirby]] timing device, which was designed by Kirby to determine the correct order of finish in horse races. The official report for 1932 Olympics states: "In addition to hand timing, two auxiliary electrical timing devices were used. Both were started by an attachment to the starters gun. One was stopped by hand at the time the runners hit the tape. The other was provided with a motion picture camera which photographed the runner at the tape and the dial of the time indicator 
simultaneously."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Grantee |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/ |title=LA84 Foundation |publisher=LA84 Foundation |date= |accessdate=2013-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kirby's system was also used at the [[1932 United States Olympic Trials (track and field)|1932 US. Olympic Trials]], where [[Ralph Metcalfe]]'s winning time of 10.62 in the [[100 meters]] is considered possibly the first automatically timed world record.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20131102163732/http://www.trackandfieldnews.com/tfn/archive/results.jsp?sex=M&amp;disciplineId=1&amp;id=1&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, FAT was used, but very few times have been found.

In 1948 Bulova began developing the Phototimer, a unique combination of photo-finish camera and precision electronic timing instrument. The Phototimer was the first automatic timing device to be used in competitive sports. It was used extensively in North America, including at the 1948 US Olympic trials. The Bulova device was activated by the sound of the starting gun firing, rather than by a direct connection, which means that the times were around 0.02 seconds faster than reality.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usatf.org/statistics/champions/OlympicTrials/HistoryOfTheOlympicTrials.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The 1948 Olympics, however, continued to use Omega timing with a device called the 'Magic Eye', developed by British Race Finish Recording Co. Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wthejournal.com/en/en-direct/article/omega-olympics-games-2012-in-london-ready-set-go |title=Omega - Olympics games 2012 in London: ready, set, go! - WtheJournal - all about high-end watches |publisher=WtheJournal |date= |accessdate=2013-06-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120824220406/http://www.wthejournal.com/en/en-direct/article/omega-olympics-games-2012-in-london-ready-set-go |archivedate=2012-08-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The automatic times produced in the 1948 Olympics have never been released, but examination of the photos at the finish means that margins have been calculated to 1/100 second accuracy.

In 1952 the Omega Time Recorder was the first to use a quartz clock and print out results, earning the company a prestigious Cross of Merit from the Olympic Committee.  Clocks were added to slit cameras for automatic time-stamping, accurate to the 100th of a second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Perry |first=Lacy |url=http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/olympic-timing4.htm |title=HowStuffWorks "How Olympic Timing Works" |publisher=Entertainment.howstuffworks.com |date=2004-08-24 |accessdate=2013-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these improvements, the overall system was similar to that used in London in 1948 (the Racend Omega Timer).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1952/OR1952.pdf{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The average difference between the FAT and manual times for the men's 100 meters was 0.24 seconds, although this ranged from 0.05 seconds to 0.45 seconds. The average difference for the six runners in the 100 meter final was 0.41 seconds, much higher than the average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/1952/ATH/mens-100-metres.html |title=Athletics at the 1952 Helsinki Summer Games: Men's 100 metres &amp;#124; Olympics at |publisher=Sports-reference.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616175249/http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/1952/ATH/mens-100-metres.html |archivedate=2013-06-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (the average difference in the women's 100 meters competition was also 0.24 but only 0.22 in the final). In the men's 200 meters, the average difference was 0.21 seconds, and in the men's 400 meters the average difference was 0.16 seconds.

In 1956 the average difference between the FAT and manual times for the men's 100 meters was 0.19 seconds, ranging from -0.05 to 0.34 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/1956/ATH/mens-100-metres.html |title=Athletics at the 1956 Melbourne Summer Games: Men's 100 metres &amp;#124; Olympics at |publisher=Sports-reference.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616171507/http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/1956/ATH/mens-100-metres.html |archivedate=2013-06-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the men's 200 meters, the average difference was 0.16 seconds, and in the men's 400 meters the average difference was 0.11 seconds.

In 1960 the average difference between the FAT and manual times for the men's 100 meters was 0.15 seconds, ranging from -0.05 to 0.26 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/1960/ATH/mens-100-metres.html |title=Athletics at the 1960 Roma Summer Games: Men's 100 metres &amp;#124; Olympics at |publisher=Sports-reference.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616204351/http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/1960/ATH/mens-100-metres.html |archivedate=2013-06-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the men's 200 meters, the average difference was 0.13 seconds, and in the men's 400 meters the average difference was 0.14 seconds.

In 1964, although manual timing was also used at the Olympics, the official times were measured with a FAT system but given the appearance of hand times. For example, Bob Hayes won the 100 meters in a FAT time of 10.06 seconds, which was converted to an official time of 10.0 seconds, despite the fact that officials with stopwatches had timed Hayes at 9.9 seconds. The FAT systems in 1964 and 1968 built in a 0.05 second delay, so Hayes' FAT time was measured as 10.01 seconds, which was rounded to 10.0 seconds for official purposes. The currently understood time of 10.06 has been determined by adding back the 0.05 seconds delay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://easyweb.easynet.co.uk/~rsparks/auto-uk.htm |title=Auto-UK |publisher=Easyweb.easynet.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-06-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404094106/http://easyweb.easynet.co.uk/~rsparks/auto-uk.htm |archive-date=2012-04-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same adjustment has been made to the 1968 Olympics FAT times; Jim Hines' winning time for the 100 meters was measured as 9.89 seconds, subsequently adjusted to 9.95 seconds.

In 1972, having provided the official timing equipment since 1932, Omega lost the right to be the official timer for the Olympics to Longines. Omega returned for the 1976 Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Van |first=Vicky |url=http://atickoftime.blogspot.com.au/2012/08/the-olympics-omega-lost-to-longines.html |title=In The Tick of Time: The Olympics Omega Lost to Longines |publisher=Atickoftime.blogspot.com.au |date=2012-08-17 |accessdate=2013-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first Olympics where official results were given to the nearest 1/100 seconds.

'''Glebe Park''' is a [[association football|football]] stadium in [[Brechin]], [[Scotland]], which is the home ground of [[Brechin City F.C.|Brechin City]].

Glebe Park opened in 1919.&lt;ref name = "inglis 430"&gt;{{harvnb|Inglis|1996|p=430}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ground had just one portable stand, which had been used at the [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]] agricultural show.&lt;ref name = "inglis 430"/&gt; Brechin City joined the [[Scottish Football League]] in [[1929–30 in Scottish football|1929]], when a pavilion was added and the Cemetery End terrace was covered.&lt;ref name = "inglis 430"/&gt; The biggest ever attendance was 8,123, against [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] in a [[Scottish Cup]] tie played on 3 February 1973.&lt;ref name="inglis 430"/&gt; This attendance was greater than the population of Brechin.&lt;ref name = "inglis 430"/&gt; Floodlights were installed and used for the first time in 1977, in a match against [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]].&lt;ref name = "inglis 430"/&gt;

[[File:Glebe Park. - geograph.org.uk - 43596.jpg|thumbnail|left|Glebe Park in 1983]]

The old stand was replaced by a new Main Stand, with 290 seats, in 1981.&lt;ref name = "inglis 430"/&gt; Sponsorship by the [[Stewart Milne]] group and a [[Football Trust]] grant of £210,000 financed the construction of a 1,228 seat stand at the Trinity Road end of the ground.&lt;ref name = "inglis 430"/&gt; This stand had double the capacity of Brechin City's average attendance, which attracted criticism from non-league clubs in England, who believed that the Football Trust should fund their developments instead.&lt;ref name = "inglis 430"/&gt;

Unusually, the largest stand in the ground was built behind the goal, rather than the side opposite the Main Stand.&lt;ref name = "inglis 430"/&gt; This was because that side is constrained by a terrace and the Glebe Park hedge, which runs past more than half of the pitch.&lt;ref name = "inglis 430"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "hedge row"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/sport/brechin_dig_heels_in_over_hedge_row_1_1031846|title=Brechin dig heels in over hedge row|work=sport.scotsman.com|publisher=Johnston Press|date=27 March 2009|accessdate=4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "foul"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/brechin_city/7828495.stm|title=Brechin pitch falls foul of Uefa|work=[[BBC Sport]]|publisher=BBC |date=14 January 2009|accessdate=4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hedge was threatened in 2009 because Glebe Park's pitch dimensions were too small for it to meet [[UEFA]] requirements, at just 67 yards wide.&lt;ref name = "inglis 430"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "hedge row"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "foul"/&gt; A fine was suspended by the [[Scottish Football Association|SFA]] because Brechin City carried out some work to resolve the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/sport/cowdenbeath_haven_t_made_enough_effort_insists_sfa_1_798310|title=Cowdenbeath haven't made enough effort, insists SFA|work=sport.scotsman.com|publisher=Johnston Press|date=31 March 2010|accessdate=4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a small training pitch behind the hedge.

Glebe Park has also been used for the [[reserve team]] matches of [[Scottish Premier League]] club [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]].

{{About|hand-to-hand combat|other uses of ''ground work''|Groundwork (disambiguation)}}
[[Image:side mount01.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Ground fighting taking place in a [[mixed martial art]]s bout]]
[[Image:Strikes from guard.tif|thumb|220px|Although the [[guard (grappling)|guard]] is generally considered an advantageous [[grappling position|position]] in pure [[grappling]], [[punch (strike)|punches]] can be very effective from the top.]]

'''Ground fighting''' (also called '''ground work''' or '''ground game''') is [[hand-to-hand combat]] or [[wrestling]] which takes place while the combatants are on the ground, as distinguished from [[stand-up fighting]]. The term is commonly used in [[mixed martial arts]] and other [[combat sport]]s, as well as various forms of [[martial arts]] to designate the set of [[grappling]] techniques employed by a combatant that is on the ground. It is the main focus of [[Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu]] and is featured in varying amounts in [[Catch wrestling]], [[Judo]], [[Sambo (martial art)|Sambo]], [[Shoot wrestling]], [[Dishuquan]]  Dog Kung Fu, some schools of [[Shuai Jiao]]  and other styles of [[wrestling]].

Similarly to [[clinch fighting]], ground fighting implies that the combatants are at a very close range, usually involving one or both combatants [[grappling]] the opponent using various [[grappling hold]]s. Depending on the [[grappling position|positioning]] of the combatants, the proximity can allow for techniques such as [[biting]], [[chokehold]]s, [[fish-hooking]], [[eye-gouging]], [[joint lock]]s, [[pressure point techniques]], or various [[strike (attack)|strikes]].

==Striking on the ground==
Traditionally neglected by most [[grappling]] arts, [[strike (attack)|striking]] on the ground is an important aspect of ground fighting. Typically, a [[top position]] is better for various strikes than a [[bottom position]], simply because the combatant in the top position can generate the distance and movement needed for effective strikes, while the bottom combatant is restricted by the ground and by the combatant on top. Another factor is [[gravity]], which is in favor of the top combatant when he or she is striking downwards. In addition, the effect of ground strikes may be amplified, depending on the area struck, by the strike driving the opponent into the ground. The types of strikes that can be employed effectively depend on the particular [[grappling position#ground grappling position|grappling position]], common ones include [[elbow (strike)|elbow]]s, [[headbutt]]s, [[Knee (strike)|knee]]s and [[punch (strike)|punch]]es.

[[File:Casque hockey.png|thumb|240px|[[Bauer Hockey|Bauer]] ice hockey [[helmet]] with shield and ear guards]]
A '''hockey helmet''' is worn by players of [[ice hockey]], [[inline hockey]], and [[bandy]] to help protect the head from potential [[injury]] when hit by the [[hockey puck|puck]], [[hockey stick|sticks]], [[hockey skate|skates]], boards, other players, or the ice. The shell of a hockey helmet is generally made of a substance called vinyl nitrile that disperses force from the point of contact, while the liner may be made of either vinyl nitrile foam, [[polypropylene|expanded polypropylene]] foam, or other material to absorb the energy, to reduce the chances of [[concussion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The effects of impact management material in ice hockey helmets on head injury criteria |journal=Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part P: Journal of Sports Engineering and Technology |issn=1754-3371 |issue=4 |volume=223 |year=2009  |pages=159–65 |doi=10.1243/17543371JSET36 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hockey [[helmet]]s grip the head from inside by cupping the back of head, or the [[External occipital protuberance|occipital protuberance]]. Helmet manufacturers will have a chart that relates their helmet sizes to head measurements. Most helmets have tool-free adjustments, but on older models, the helmet size is adjusted by loosening the screws on the side to slide the front portion forward or back.

==Visors and shields==
A visor or [[face shield]] in ice hockey is a device attached to the front of a helmet to reduce potential of injury to the [[face]]. Visors cover the upper half of the face, while full face shields cover the entire face. A series of eye injuries, most notably that to [[Bruce Fogarty]],{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source; There has never been a Bruce Fogarty in the NHL.|date=December 2016}} have led to a call from many to enforce their wearing. {{As of|2017}}, 94% of NHL players wear visors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johnston|first1=Chris|title=Visor-less NHLers an increasingly rare sight|url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/visor-less-nhlers-an-increasingly-rare-sight2/|publisher=[[Sportsnet]]|accessdate=4 January 2017|date=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many other leagues around the world mandate the use of visors. Visors and shields, made of a high impact-resistant plastic, offer better overall vision than the wire cages available, which can obscure vision in certain areas. The face shield provides excellent straight ahead and peripheral vision, but does not provide as good air flow as a cage.

The [[American Hockey League]], the top minor league in North America required all players to wear a visor prior to the start of the 2006–07 season. The NHL "strongly recommends" the use of visors. In 2013, the NHL began requiring all players with less than 25 games of experience to wear visors.&lt;ref name=nhl-rule-changes-2013&gt;[http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=684940 Hybrid icing tops list of rule changes for 2013-14]. NHL.com Retrieved September 30, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The hockey visor was first invented by Kenneth William Clay when he lost vision in his left eye to a high stick while playing for the [[Vanderhoof Bears]]. After a month in hospital in Vancouver, Clay created the first documented clear face shield in January 1964. The invention caused quite a stir, with announcers calling it a "fish bowl" and a "wrap-around windshield". While the original shield and helmet were lost in the fire that consumed the Vanderhoof Arena a few years later, the newspaper clippings still attest to the dates and facts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hayes|first1=Kelly|title=Keremeos man claims to have invented the hockey visor|url=http://globalnews.ca/news/2455411/keremeos-man-claims-to-have-invented-the-hockey-visor/|publisher=[[Global News]]|accessdate=4 January 2017|date=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Full facial protection ==
[[File:Air Force &amp; Alaska - Fairbanks hockey faceoff.JPG|thumb|right|Two NCAA players wearing helmets with full cages.]]
A cage in ice hockey is a device attached to the front of a helmet to reduce potential of injury to the [[face]]. It consists of a metal or composite mesh that covers the entire face, although some half cages do exist (to protect the eyes while allowing full airflow). The bars, or cage, are spaced far enough apart to allow seeing through to the action but are close enough to stop pucks and sticks from getting through to injure the face.

Some manufacturers now offer the best of both designs—a plastic face shield to protect the eyes and upper part of the face, and a cage to cover the lower jaw and to add ventilation. Full facial protection is mandatory in many amateur leagues and in North America, full face cages, full shields, or shield and cage combination are mandatory in high school hockey, [[NCAA|college hockey]], and for all players under the age of 18.

NHL player [[George Parsons (ice hockey)|George Parsons]] was forced to retire due to career-ending eye injury in 1939.&lt;ref name="hhof"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SearchPlayer.jsp?player=13928|title=George Parsons|website=Legends of Hockey|access-date=2017-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became involved with CCM hockey, helping to develop helmets and facial protection that would be safer for players. By early 1976, CCM had developed a hockey helmet complete with eye and face shield and lower face protector that was both approved by the [[Canadian Standards Association]] and endorsed by the [[Canadian Amateur Hockey Association]].&lt;ref name="CCM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vintageccm.com/content/george-henry-parsons-1914-1998|title=George Henry Parsons Bio|date=2015-01-26|website=CCM Vintage|access-date=2017-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Facial protection research ===
In 2002, the ''[[British Journal of Sports Medicine]]'' published a study identifying the protection offered against concussions between the half-face shield and the full-face shield.  The use of a full-face shield compared with half-face shield significantly reduced the playing time lost because of concussion, suggesting that concussion severity may be reduced by the use of a full-face shield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Benson|first1=B W|last2=Rose|first2=M S|last3=Meeuwisse|first3=W H|title=The impact of face shield use on concussions in ice hockey: a multivariate analysis|url=http://bjsm.bmj.com/content/36/1/27.abstract?sid=374eeb4f-6553-46eb-9e3e-6427e15b6a6a|publisher=''[[British Journal of Sports Medicine]]''|accessdate=4 January 2017|date=2 November 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Helmets in the National Hockey League==
[[File:Calvin de Haan - New York Islanders.jpg|thumb|upright|lefl| Defenseman [[Calvin de Haan]] wearing a helmet and visor]]
The first player to regularly wear a helmet for protective purposes was [[George Owen (ice hockey)|George Owen]], who played for [[1928–29 Boston Bruins season|the Boston Bruins]] in [[1928–29 NHL season|1928–29]]. In 1927, [[Barney Stanley]] presented a prototype of a helmet at the NHL's annual meeting. It was quickly rejected.

Helmets appeared after the [[National Hockey League All-Star Game#Ace Bailey Benefit Game|Ace Bailey–Eddie Shore incident]] on December 12, [[1933–34 NHL season|1933]], as a result of which Bailey almost died and Shore suffered a severe head injury. After that, [[Art Ross]] engineered a new helmet design and when the [[Boston Bruins]] took to the ice in a game against the [[Ottawa Senators (original)|Ottawa Senators]], most of the players donned the new helmet. Most Bruins players didn't wear the helmet after the game, with the exception of Eddie Shore, who wore it the rest of his career.  In the 1930s, the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] players were ordered to add helmets to their equipment. A few minutes into the first game with the new helmets, the popular [[King Clancy]] famously flung his off.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} The helmets were generally unpopular with fans, media, and other players. A few players, such as [[Des Smith (ice hockey)|Des Smith]], [[Bill Mosienko]], [[Dit Clapper]], and [[Don Gallinger]] continued to don helmets.

During the [[Original Six]] era, [[Maurice Richard]] and [[Elmer Lach]] briefly wore helmets.  [[Jack Crawford (ice hockey)|Jack Crawford]] wore a helmet to hide his bald head and [[Charlie Burns (ice hockey)|Charlie Burns]] wearing one to protect the metal plates in his head from an injury incurred in playing [[junior ice hockey]], predating his NHL career.

The death of [[Bill Masterton]] from a brain injury in a January 13, 1968 game between the [[Minnesota North Stars]] and [[Oakland Seals]] started to change perceptions surrounding helmets.&lt;ref&gt;"Helmet Wins New Friends"; in ''[[The Vancouver Sun]]''; January 17, 1968; p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Helmet use began to gradually increase during the 1970s, with [[Ted Green]] being the first Bruins player since Shore to wear one as a result of his NHL career, for the [[1970-71 NHL season]] and onwards for the same reason that Charlie Burns had worn a helmet, until Green's retirement from pro hockey in 1979.  The [[1972 Summit Series]] showcased an entirely helmet clad [[Soviet Union national ice hockey team|Soviet Union team]], with [[Paul Henderson]], [[Stan Mikita]], and [[Red Berenson]] being the only Canadians to sport a helmet. Usage increased to the point that 70% of NHL players were wearing them by 1979.&lt;ref&gt;"N.H.L. Rules New Players Now Must Wear Helmets"; in ''[[New York Times]]''; August 6, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1979, the then-President of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL), [[John Ziegler (sports administrator)|John Ziegler]], announced that protective helmets would become mandatory for incoming players in the NHL. "The introduction of the helmet rule will be an additional safety factor," he said. The rule allowed players who signed professional contracts prior to June 1, 1979 to continue to not wear a helmet provided a liability waiver was signed, if they so desired. The last player to play without a helmet was [[Craig MacTavish]], who played his final game during [[1996–97 NHL season|the 1996–97 season]] for [[1996–97 St. Louis Blues season|the St. Louis Blues]]. The last referee to not wear a helmet was [[Mick McGeough]], who began wearing a helmet in the [[2006–07 NHL season|2006–07 season]] and retired after [[2007–08 NHL season|the following season]].

== Features ==
Johnson Stadium's most notable feature is its [[cantilever]]ed roof, similar to that of [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]]'s [[Estadio Hiram Bithorn]] and [[Lynn, Massachusetts]]'s [[Fraser Field]].&lt;ref name=db&gt;{{cite web|last=Pastore |first=Eric and Wendy |title=J.L.

This seating is elevated, with the first row of seats starting at the dugout roofs' height.&lt;ref name=charlie&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Reilly |first=Charles |title=Mr. Roberts Built It |url=http://mysite.verizon.net/charliesballparks/stadiums/oralrob.htm |work=Charlie's Ballparks |accessdate=August 15, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60xrZk0T7?url=http://mysite.verizon.net/charliesballparks/stadiums/oralrob.htm |archivedate=August 15, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A thirty-foot [[batter's eye]] stands in center field, with an electronic scoreboard in right center.  The stadium's outfield walls were replaced during 2009 renovations.&lt;ref name="facil" /&gt;

The venue also features stadium lighting,&lt;ref name="charlie" /&gt; [[Dugout (baseball)|dugouts]], a mesh backstop,&lt;ref name="db" /&gt; a [[press box]], locker rooms, and practice facilities.&lt;ref name=ORUphotos&gt;{{cite web|title=J.L.

'''JPS Field at Malone Stadium''' is a [[stadium]] in [[Monroe, Louisiana]], United States, on the campus of the [[University of Louisiana at Monroe]].  It is primarily used for football and is the home field of the [[Louisiana–Monroe Warhawks football|ULM Warhawks]]. The stadium, named for former coach [[James L. Malone]], opened in 1978 and has a seating capacity of 27,617 people. The field is named JPS Field, for a local company, JPS Aviation/JPS Equipment Rental. The field was named after the company after they agreed to fund installation of a new [[FieldTurf]] playing surface in 2014.

==History==
Because Northeast Louisiana University's previous stadium could hold just over 8,000 spectators, the late Mayor [[W. L. "Jack" Howard]] pushed for construction of a new football stadium.&lt;ref name=ullfootball&gt;{{cite web|url=http://si.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1091504/9/index.htm|title=John Underwood,  "New Boys On The Block: From the day he's hired, a college football coach has two things in common with his predecessor—a belief he can do the job, a good chance he won't. Meet four fresh optimists," September 6, 1976|publisher=si.com|accessdate=July 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malone Stadium, named after the winningest coach in school history [[James L. Malone]], opened on September 16, 1978, with a capacity of 20,000, with the then-Northeast Louisiana Indians beat Arkansas State, 21–13.

It is located across Bayou Desiard from the main campus, the center of the school's athletic facilities.  The field runs roughly north-northeast, with an imbalanced grandstand, the west stands being the larger stands.  The lower west level is a solid enclosed structure, with the ULM Athletic Training Center enclosed, and the upper level extends much higher, with the press box and luxury boxes located on top.  The east side is also decked, with a short first deck wrapping around almost from goalpost to goalpost and another short steel-supported upper deck running the length of the field.

===Renovations===
Both sides of seating were extended into each [[end zone]] in 1983, increasing the capacity to 23,277. The press box was enlarged in 1991, and capacity decreased to 22,077. In 1993, 8,350 seats were added to the stadium, increasing capacity to its current figure of 30,427.

[[File:Malone scoreboard.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Scoreboard in 2012]]
In 2007, ULM excavated the natural grass from Malone Stadium to install ProPlay artificial turf.&lt;ref |name="ULM Warhawks"&gt;{{cite web|title=Work begins on field at Malone Stadium |date=April 30, 2007 |url=http://www.ulmwarhawks.com/ViewArticle.dbml?temp_site=NO&amp;DB_OEM_ID=19000&amp;ATCLID=1318397&amp;SPID=10968&amp;SPSID=90583}} Retrieved on October 12, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the university installed a new scoreboard with a high definition video display measuring 23 feet high by 48 feet wide (1,104 square feet) and flanked by two low definition video panels for advertisements measuring 16 feet high by 14 feet wide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daktronics.com/Company/NewsReleases/Pages/UniversityofLouisianaMonroe.aspx University of Louisiana at Monroe to Upgrade with Daktronics LED Technology]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, a new sound system was installed in the upper corners of the scoreboard.

A record crowd of 31,175 was reached on September 21, 2012 against the [[2012 Baylor Bears football team|Baylor Bears]] at the 2012 home opener.

In 2014, JPS Aviation/JPS Equipment Rental paid $450,000 to replace the artificial turf with new [[FieldTurf]] and for the field to be named JPS Field at Malone Stadium for the next eight seasons.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ulmwarhawks.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=209392972&lt;/ref&gt;

A new field house facility was completed in August 2016 at a cost of $4.1 million. The {{convert|11750|sqft|adj=on}} building is located in the north end zone, attached to the west grandstand. It features a hall of fame area, locker room, coaches’ offices, and patios overlooking the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=ULM unveils much-anticipated football facility |url=http://www.thenewsstar.com/story/sports/college/ulm/2016/08/02/ulm-unveils-much-anticipated-football-facility/87963344/ |newspaper=The News-Star |author=Hunsucker, Adam |date=August 2, 2016 |accessdate=May 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Farry''' (1 July 1954 &amp;ndash; 10 November 2010)&lt;ref name=scotobit&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.scotsman.com/news/obituaries/obituary-jim-farry-football-administrator-1-833291|title=Obituary: Jim Farry, football administrator|date=12 November 2010|accessdate=13 November 2010|work=[[The Scotsman]]|location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; served as chief executive of the [[Scottish Football Association]] from 1990 to 1999. Farry was forced to leave that post due to a dispute with [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] over the registration of player [[Jorge Cadete]].

==Early life==
Farry attended school in [[East Kilbride]], before working as a landscape gardener, milkman and window cleaner.&lt;ref name="death"/&gt; He first joined the [[Scottish Football Association]] (SFA) in 1972 as an administration assistant.&lt;ref name = "death"/&gt; In the late 1970s he was appointed secretary of the [[Scottish Football League]], a position he held for over 10 years.&lt;ref name="death"/&gt; Farry earned a reputation as an efficient administrator during his stint as league secretary. When the same position at the SFA became vacant in 1990, he was appointed as the successor to the departing Ernie Walker.&lt;ref name="death"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/292088.stm|title=Farry sacked by SFA |publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=8 March 2009|accessdate=4 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==SFA chief executive==
While chief executive, Farry oversaw the project to renovate Scotland's national football stadium [[Hampden Park]].&lt;ref name="hampden"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/football/scotland/2010/11/11/former-sfa-chief-executive-jim-farry-dies-aged-55-86908-22708214|title=Former SFA chief executive Jim Farry dies aged 55|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|date=11 November 2010 |accessdate=11 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 'new Hampden' as it was termed, drew both support and criticism, with opinion divided over the need for a dedicated national stadium within Scotland. As the stadium is used at club level by [[Queen's Park F.C.|Queen's Park]], an amateur team currently playing in the lower divisions and possessing limited support, some footballing figures had argued that an existing stadium could have served as a home for the Scottish national team indefinitely.  Alternatively, supporters of the stadium have pointed to the awarding of [[UEFA Elite stadium|UEFA elite status]] and the hosting of a number of high-profile matches, most notably the [[2002 UEFA Champions League Final]] and the [[2007 UEFA Cup Final]], as proof of the renovation's success.

===Princess of Wales Controversy===
In 1997, Farry attracted criticism from some parts of the media in the aftermath of the death of [[Diana Princess of Wales]], after he publicly rejected calls to cancel a scheduled international match between [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] and [[Belarus national football team|Belarus]] on the day of the Princess's funeral.&lt;ref name="diana"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/politics97/diana/soccer.html|title=Calls For Farry to Quit Over Saturday Soccer Match |publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=4 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later revealed that he had been advised by Buckingham Palace to let the game go ahead; however after a hostile reaction from the media and certain sections of society, the match was eventually rescheduled.&lt;ref name = "diana"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/top-football-stories/queen-told-us-to-play-game-reveals-farry-1-1099500 |title=Queen told us to play game, reveals Farry |date=8 October 2005 |accessdate=19 March 2012 |work=[[The Scotsman]]|location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Member of Parliament (UK)|MP]] [[Jimmy Hood]] and the ''[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]'' newspaper called on Farry to resign, while Rangers players [[Ally McCoist]], [[Andy Goram]] and [[Gordon Durie]] had refused to play in the match if it had been played on the day of the funeral.&lt;ref name="diana"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-the-great-flaw-of-scotland-1237918.html|last=Gordon|first=Phil|title=The great flaw of Scotland|date=7 September 1997|accessdate=4 November 2010|location=London|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jorge Cadete===
In 1999, an independent commission was called to examine allegations made by the then [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] managing director and majority shareholder [[Fergus McCann]] concerning the registration of [[Portugal|Portuguese]] player [[Jorge Cadete]] in 1996.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; A player must be registered with the [[Scottish Football Association|SFA]] before he is permitted to play in matches in Scotland. A delay in the registration had forced Cadete to miss a [[Scottish Cup]] semi-final against their [[Old Firm]] rivals [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]], which Celtic lost 2&amp;ndash;1.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "suspended"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/288283.stm |title=SFA boss suspended |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=1 March 1999 |accessdate=4 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCann claimed that the delay was deliberate and the commission ruled in his favour.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "suspended"/&gt; On 8 March 1999, Farry was sacked for gross misconduct.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;

==Life after football==
As of 2009, Farry was employed as a business development manager by medium-sized construction and refurbishment firm AKP Scotland, based in [[East Kilbride]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/football/-Farry39s-fall-from-grace.5004457.jp|work=[[Scotland On Sunday]]|date=22 February 2009|accessdate=4 November 2010|title=Farry's fall from grace}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a patron of [[Cambuslang RFC|Cambuslang Rugby Club]].&lt;ref name=scotobit/&gt;

Following a massive heart attack in his home in [[Cambuslang]], Farry died on 10 November 2010 in [[Hairmyres Hospital]], East Kilbride, shortly afterwards. He was survived by his wife and two children.&lt;ref name=scotobit/&gt;&lt;ref name="death"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/home-news/former-sfa-chief-jim-farry-dies-at-56-1.1067426|work=[[The Herald (Scotland)|The Herald]]|last=Williams|first= Martin|title=Former SFA chief Jim Farry dies at 56|date=11 November 2010|accessdate=11 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Latonia Derby''' was an American [[Thoroughbred horse race]] run annually from 1883 through 1937 at [[Latonia Race Track]] in [[Latonia, Covington|Latonia, Kentucky]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://drf.uky.edu/catalog/1930s/drf1935052901/drf1935052901_31_8 ''Daily Racing Form'', 1935-05-29 "Almost as Old as the Kentucky Derby"]&lt;/ref&gt;Open to three-year-old horses, for its first 52 years the Latonia Derby was contested at a mile and a half then in 1935 the distance was shortened to a mile and a quarter. It was run as the Hindoo Stakes from inception in 1883 to 1886 in honor of the Kentucky-bred [[National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame|U.S. Racing Hall of Fame]] horse, [[Hindoo (horse)|Hindoo]].&lt;ref&gt;https://drf.uky.edu/catalog/1910s/drf1912051701/drf1912051701_2_4  "Latonia Derby Rich In Promise" - ''Daily Racing Form'', 1912-05-17&lt;/ref&gt; The race usually attracted the [[Kentucky Derby]] winner; it became so popular that in 1912 a [[film|motion picture]] was made by [[Universal Studios|Independent Motion Picture Co.]] entitled ''Winning the Latonia Derby'', featuring [[silent film]] star [[King Baggot]].

The inaugural 1883 Latonia Derby was won by Kentucky Derby winner [[Leonatus]]. Future Derby winners [[Kingman (American horse)|Kingman]] (1891), [[Halma (horse)|Halma]] (1895), [[Ben Brush]] (1896), [[Lieut. Gibson]] (1900), [[Elwood (horse)|Elwood]] (1904) and [[Sir Huon]] (1906) also won the race; the 1918 edition was won by [[Harry Payne Whitney|Harry Payne Whitney's]] [[Belmont Stakes]]-winning colt, [[Johren]]. In 1936, [[Rushaway]] won the [[Illinois Derby]] during the afternoon, then was shipped {{convert|300|mi|km}} overnight to win the Latonia Derby the following afternoon.&lt;ref&gt;[https://drf.uky.edu/catalog/1930s/drf1936052501/drf1936052501_1_2  ''Daily Racing Form'', 1936-05-25, "A.

The '''Lincoln Park Grounds''', commonly known as '''Union Grounds''', were a former [[baseball]] park located in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]]. The Grounds were built for the Union Cricket Club in 1856; they "were used for cricket and baseball in the summer and were flooded for skating in the winter."&lt;ref&gt;''The Cincinnati Historical Society Bulletin'', v. 27 (1969), p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1865 [[Harry Wright]] became the professional of the Cincinnati Cricket Club, which also used the grounds, and the next year Aaron Champion, president of the new [[Cincinnati Red Stockings|Cincinnati Base Ball Club]], "approached Wright to propose a limited use of the grounds if the CBBC and Live Oaks club would put in $2000 each to revamp the Lincoln Park Grounds."&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Devine, ''Harry Wright'' (McFarland, 2003: {{ISBN|0-7864-1561-4}}), p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A year later the [Red Stockings] leased the grounds of the Union Cricket Club for its home
tilts. Most club members referred to the field as the Union Grounds, although it also was known as the Union Cricket Club Grounds and the Lincoln Park Grounds, given the fact that the eight-acre, fenced grounds were located in a small park behind Lincoln Park in Cincinnati, near the [[Union Terminal (Cincinnati)|Union Terminal]]. It was a twenty-minute ride by streetcar to the Union Grounds from the heart of downtown Cincinnati. Aaron Champion ordered that approximately $10,000 worth of improvements be made to the home grounds for the 1867 season, including grading and sodding of the field and building of a new clubhouse and stands.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen D. Guschov, ''The Red Stockings of Cincinnati'' (McFarland, 1998: {{ISBN|0-7864-0467-1}}), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The Union Grounds were used until 1875; the next year a new [[Cincinnati Reds (1876-1880)|Cincinnati Red Stockings]]  club moved to the [[Avenue Grounds]] two miles to the north.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mlb.com/cin/history/ballparks.jsp Reds Ballparks].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Meadowbank Stadium''' (officially '''Meadowbank Sports Centre''') is a multi-purpose sports facility located in the [[Meadowbank, Edinburgh|Meadowbank]] area of [[Edinburgh]], Scotland. Built on the site of the earlier [[New Meadowbank]] and [[Old Meadowbank]] sports venues, it was originally built to host the  [[1970 Commonwealth Games]]. It also hosted the Games in [[1986 Commonwealth Games|1986]], becoming the first venue to host the Games twice.

The stadium has also regularly hosted [[Association football|football]]. It was the home ground of [[Scottish Football League]] team [[Livingston F.C.|Meadowbank Thistle]] between 1974 and 1995. From 1996, it hosted senior non-league football as the home ground of [[Edinburgh City F.C.|Edinburgh City]].  League football returned to Meadowbank in 2016 following City's promotion to the [[Scottish Professional Football League]]. The Meadowbank complex also hosts [[Leith Athletic F.C.|Leith Athletic]], who have played on the '''Meadowbank 3G''' artificial pitch adjacent to the main stadium since 2013. As of 2017, the stadium is being redeveloped.

Meadowbank Stadium was also used for [[rugby union]] as the home venue of [[Edinburgh Rugby]] between 2002 and 2004.

==Layout==
Before the stadium was closed for redevelopment work in 2017, the capacity of the stadium was 5,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spfl.co.uk/clubs/edinburgh-city/ |title=Edinburgh City Football Club |work= |publisher=Scottish Professional Football League |date= |accessdate=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium consisted of a main grandstand, with uncovered benches around the rest of the running track. It was built on the site of [[New Meadowbank]] stadium, while the indoor sports complex and adjacent pitches to the east were built on the site of [[Old Meadowbank]] stadium. The stadium itself contains an eight lane, 400 metre running track, with a grass pitch within this. There is also a [[velodrome]] adjacent to the site. Underneath the stand is a covered 100 metre, eight-lane track.

The stadium contains indoor facilities, including squash and basketball courts. These are also used for antiques fairs, martial arts competitions, conferences, and church meetings. Other outdoor facilities include field hockey pitches.

==Uses==
[[File:Meadowbank Stadium panorama.jpg|thumb|left|800px]]{{Clear}}
===Commonwealth Games===
Meadowbank Stadium was built for the [[1970 Commonwealth Games]], at a cost of £2.8 million.&lt;ref name = "Inglis341"/&gt; It was opened by [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent]] on 2 May 1970.&lt;ref name = "Inglis341"&gt;{{harvnb|Inglis|1987|p=341}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1970 Games was one of the most successful in the history of the event.&lt;ref name = "commonwealth"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/sport/more-sport/athletics/glasgow-makes-final-call-for-2014-games-1-746056 |title=Glasgow makes final call for 2014 games |work=The Scotsman |publisher=Johnston Publishing |date=9 May 2007 |accessdate=28 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "bbc"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-21674542 |title=The good and bad of Commonwealth Games |first=Cameron |last=Buttle |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=7 March 2013 |accessdate=28 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[1986 Commonwealth Games]] were also held at Meadowbank, which became the first venue to host the Commonwealth Games twice.&lt;ref name = "Inglis341"/&gt; The 1986 Games suffered a financial deficit and were widely boycotted due to the support of the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British Government]] for the [[apartheid]] regime in [[South Africa]].&lt;ref name = "commonwealth"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "bbc"/&gt;

The stadium once had its own [[Meadowbank Stadium railway station|railway station]] which was built for the 1986 Commonwealth Games.

===Football===
[[Livingston F.C.|Meadowbank Thistle]] played at the stadium from 1974 until the club relocated to the [[new town]] of [[Livingston, Scotland|Livingston]] in 1995.&lt;ref name = "Inglis"&gt;{{harvnb|Inglis|1996|p=455}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meadowbank is often cited as one of the worst stadiums used in the [[Scottish Football League]] due to the lack of atmosphere in the ground. This was caused by the stadium having a capacity of {{SPFL-stadiums|edinburghcity}}, but Meadowbank typically attracted crowds of less than 1,000.&lt;ref name = "Inglis"/&gt; Most fans were located on one side of the ground, while the running track created a great distance between the fans and the pitch.

Meadowbank Thistle announced their intention to leave the stadium and relocate to Livingston in 1995, when their lease expired.&lt;ref name = "Inglis"/&gt; Their last game as Meadowbank Thistle was played in May 1995, although they continued to play at Meadowbank Stadium as Livingston until their new [[Almondvale Stadium]] was ready in November 1995.&lt;ref name = "Inglis"/&gt; [[Edinburgh City F.C.|Edinburgh City]] moved into the stadium after Meadowbank left&lt;ref name = "Inglis"/&gt; and they have since been joined by [[Leith Athletic F.C.|Leith Athletic]] (from the East of Scotland League). [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] have also played some of their [[reserve team]] matches at Meadowbank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/latest/mcmanus-impresses-as-smith-earns-hibs-reserves-a-draw-1-1337952 |title=McManus impresses as Smith earns Hibs reserves a draw |work=Edinburgh Evening News |publisher=Johnston Publishing |date=14 February 2007 |accessdate=28 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
[[File:Meadowbank Stadium - Radiohead.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Meadowbank Stadium prior to performance by [[Radiohead]] at the 2006 [[The Edge Festival|T on the Fringe]], taken from the main seating area]]
Meadowbank was used as a 25,000 capacity concert venue during T on the Fringe, an annual music festival. [[Muse (band)|Muse]], [[My Chemical Romance]], [[Snow Patrol]], [[Radiohead]], [[Pixies]], [[Foo Fighters]], [[Nine Inch Nails]], [[Kaiser Chiefs]] and [[Razorlight]] all played the venue between 2005 and 2007. In 2008, T on the Fringe was renamed [[The Edge Festival]] and the stadium was no longer used as one of the main venues.

In 1989, [[Simple Minds]] played Meadowbank on their [[Street Fighting Years]] Tour after switching from [[Murrayfield Stadium|Murrayfield]]. The switch was due to the band's passionate anti-[[apartheid]] beliefs clashing with the [[Scottish Rugby Union]]'s decision to play in South Africa at the time.

===Basketball===
Meadowbank stadium has basketball facilities in three of its large halls, but they are only rarely available to the public.

Edinburgh Rocks basketball team used one of the large halls until they moved to the [[Braehead Arena]], and were renamed [[Scottish Rocks]].

===Track cycling===

===Taekwondo===
The stadium was used in November 2014 to host the [[Commonwealth Taekwondo Championships]].

Climbing ropes are typically of [[kernmantle rope|kernmantle]] construction, consisting of a core (kern) of long twisted fibres and an outer sheath (mantle) of woven coloured fibres.  The core provides about 80% of the [[tensile strength]], while the sheath is a durable layer that protects the core and gives the rope desirable handling characteristics.

Ropes used for climbing can be divided into two classes: dynamic ropes and low elongation ropes (sometimes called "static" ropes). Dynamic ropes are designed to absorb the energy of a falling climber, and are usually used as [[Belay]]ing ropes. When a climber falls, the rope stretches, reducing the maximum force experienced by the climber, their belayer, and equipment. Low elongation ropes stretch much less, and are usually used in [[Anchor (climbing)|anchoring]] systems. They are also used for [[abseil|abseiling (rappelling)]] and as [[fixed rope]]s  climbed with [[ascender (climbing)|ascender]]s.

Modern webbing or "tape" is made of nylon or [[Ultra high molecular weight polyethylene|Spectra/Dyneema]], or a combination of the two. Climbing-specific nylon webbing is generally tubular webbing, that is, it is a tube of nylon pressed flat. It is very strong, generally rated in excess of {{cvt|9|kN|lbf}}. Dyneema is even stronger, often rated above {{cvt|20|kN|lbf}} and as high as {{cvt|27|kN|lbf}}.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} In 2010, UK-based DMM performed [[fall factor]] 1 and 2 tests on various Dyneema and Nylon webbings, showing Dyneema slings can fail even under 60&amp;nbsp;cm falls. Tying knots in Dyneema webbing was proven to have reduced the total amount of supported force by as much as half.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://dmmclimbing.com/knowledge/how-to-break-nylon-dyneema-slings/ |title=How to Break Nylon &amp; Dyneema® Slings [Vid&amp;#93; - Knowledge - DMM Climbing Equipment. Innovative climbing gear, made in Wales |website=Dmmclimbing.com |date=2010-06-08 |accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When webbing is sewn or tied together at the ends, it becomes a sling or runner, and if you clip a carabiner to each end of the sling, you have a [[quickdraw]]. These loops are made one of two ways—sewn (using reinforced stitching) or tied. Both ways of forming runners have advantages and drawbacks, and it is for the individual climber to choose which to use. Generally speaking, most climbers carry a few of both types. It is also important to note that only nylon can be safely knotted into a runner (usually using a [[water knot]] or [[beer knot]]), Dyneema is always sewn because the fibers are too slippery to hold a knot under weight.

Webbing has many uses such as:
* Extending the distance between  [[protection (climbing)|protection]] and a tie-in point.
* An [[Anchor (climbing)|anchor]] around a tree or rock.
* An anchor extension or [[Equalized anchor|equalization]].
* Makeshift [[climbing harness|harnesses]].
* Carrying equipment (clipped to a sling worn over the shoulder).
* Protecting a rope that hangs over a sharp edge (tubular webbing).

== Carabiners ==
{{Main article|Carabiner}}

Carabiners are metal loops with spring-loaded gates (openings), used as connectors. Once made primarily from steel, almost all carabiners for recreational climbing are now made from a light weight [[aluminum]] alloy. Steel carabiners are much heavier, but harder wearing, and therefore are often used by instructors when working with groups.

Carabiners exist in various forms; the shape of the carabiner and the type of gate varies according to the use for which it is intended. There are two major varieties: locking and non-locking carabiners. Locking carabiners offer a method of preventing the gate from opening when in use. Locking carabiners are used for important connections, such as at the anchor point or a belay device. There are several different types of locking carabiners, including a twist-lock and a thread-lock. Twist-lock carabiners are commonly referred to as "auto-locking carabiners" due to their spring-loaded locking mechanism. Non-locking carabiners are commonly found as a component of [[quickdraws]].

Carabiners are made with many different types of gates including wire-gate, bent-gate, and straight-gate. The different gates have different strengths and uses. Most locking carabiners utilize a straight-gate. Bent-gate and wire-gate carabiners are usually found on the rope-end of quickdraws, as they facilitate easier rope clipping than straight-gate carabiners.

Carabiners are also known by many slang names including ''biner'' (pronounced beaner) or ''Krab''.

The first climber who used a carabiner for climbing was German climber [[Otto Herzog]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=JP Whitehead |url=http://www.climbing.com/gear/the-carabiner-handbook/ |title=The Carabiner Handbook - Climbing Magazine &amp;#124; Rock Climbing, Mountaineering, Bouldering, Ice Climbing |website=Climbing.com |date=2015-08-31 |accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Maillon]] (or Maillon Rapide) performs a similar function to a carabiner but instead of a hinge has an internally threaded sleeve engaging with threads on each end of the link, and is available in various shapes and sizes. They are very strong but more difficult to open, either deliberately or accidentally, so are used for links which do not need to be released during normal use, such as the center of a harness.

==Quickdraws==
[[File:2quickdraws.saa.jpeg|thumb]]

{{Main article|Quickdraw}}

Quickdraws (often referred to as "draws") are used by climbers to connect ropes to bolt anchors, or to other traditional protection, allowing the rope to move through the anchoring system with minimal friction. A quickdraw consists of two non-locking carabiners connected together by a short, pre-sewn loop of webbing. Alternatively, and quite regularly, the pre-sewn webbing is replaced by a sling of the above-mentioned dyneema/nylon webbing. This is usually of a 60&amp;nbsp;cm loop and can be tripled over between the carabiners to form a 20&amp;nbsp;cm loop. Then when more length is needed the sling can be turned back into a 60&amp;nbsp;cm loop offering more versatility than a pre-sewn loop. Carabiners used for clipping into the protection generally have a straight gate, decreasing the possibility of the carabiner accidentally unclipping from the protection. The carabiner into which the rope is clipped often has a bent gate, so that clipping the rope into this carabiner can be done quickly and easily. Quickdraws are also frequently used in indoor [[lead climbing]]. The quickdraw may be pre-attached to the wall. When a climber ascends the wall, (s)he must clip the rope through the quickdraw in order to maintain safety. The safest, easiest and most effective place to clip into a quickdraw is when it is at waist height.

== Harnesses ==
{{Main article|Climbing harness}}

A harness is a system used for connecting the rope to the climber. There are two loops at the front of the harness where the climber ties into the rope at the working end using a [[figure-eight knot]]. Most harnesses used in climbing are preconstructed and are worn around the pelvis and hips, although other types are used occasionally. 

Different types of climbing warrant particular features for harnesses.  [[sport climbing|Sport climbers]] typically use minimalistic harnesses, some with sewn-on gear loops.  Alpine climbers often choose lightweight harnesses, perhaps with detachable leg loops. [[Big wall climbing|Big Wall]] climbers generally prefer padded waist belts and leg loops. There are also full body harnesses for children, whose pelvises may be too narrow to support a standard  harness safely. These harnesses prevent children from falling even when inverted, and are either manufactured for children or constructed out of webbing. Some climbers use full body harnesses when there is a chance of inverting, or when carrying a heavy bag.  There are also chest harnesses, which are used only in combination with a sit harness; this combination provides the same advantages as a full body harness.  However, test results from UIAA show that chest harnesses can put more impact on the neck than sit harnesses, making them slightly more dangerous to use.

Apart from these harnesses, there are also caving and canyoning harnesses, which all serve different purposes.  For example, a caving harness is made of tough waterproof and unpadded material, with dual attachment points.  Releasing the [[maillon]] from these attachment points loosens the harness quickly.

Canyoning harnesses are somewhat like climbing harnesses, often without the padding, but with a seat protector, making it more comfortable to [[rappel]].  These usually have a single attachment point of [[Dyneema]].

== Belay devices ==
{{main article|Belay devices}}
[[Glossary of climbing terms#belay|Belay]] devices are mechanical friction brake devices used to control a rope when belaying. Their main purpose is to allow the rope to be locked off with minimal effort to arrest a climber's fall. Multiple kinds of belay devices exist, some of which may additionally be used as descenders for controlled descent on a rope, as in [[abseil]]ing or rappelling.

Belay devices are available in both passive and active designs:

If a belay device is lost or damaged, a [[Munter hitch]] on a carabiner can be used as an improvised passive belay device.

== Rappel devices (descenders) ==
These devices are friction brakes which are designed for descending ropes. Many [[belay device]]s can be used as descenders, but there are descenders that are not practical for belaying, since it is too difficult to feed rope through them, or because they do not provide sufficient friction to hold a hard fall.

=== Figure eight ===
{{main article|Figure 8 (belay device)}}
Sometimes called "figure of eight" or just "eight", this device is most commonly used as a descender, but may also be used as a belay device in the absence of more appropriate equipment.

It is an aluminum or steel "8" shaped device, but comes in several varieties.  Its main advantage is efficient heat dissipation.  A square eight, used in rescue applications, is better for rappelling than the traditional 8.

[[File:Belaying8.jpg|thumb|right|A figure eight descender]]

Figure eights allow fast but controlled descent on a rope. They are easy to set up and are effective in dissipating the heat caused by friction but can have a tendency to cause a rope to twist.  Holding the brake hand off to the side twists the rope, whereas holding the brake hand straight down, parallel to the body, allows a controlled descent without twisting the rope.  An 8 descender can wear a rope more quickly than a tube style belay/rappel device because of the many bends it puts into the rope.  Many sport climbers also avoid them because of the extra bulk a Figure 8 puts on the [[Climbing terms#R|climbing rack]].  However, many ice climbers prefer to use the 8, because it is much easier to thread with stiff or frozen rope.

==== Rescue eight ====
[[File:Figure eight descender with rope.jpg|thumb|Rescue eight]]
A rescue eight is a variation of a figure eight, with "ears" or "wings" which prevent the rope from "locking up" or creating a [[larks head]] or [[girth hitch]], thus stranding the rappeller on the rope. Rescue eights are frequently made of steel, rather than aluminum.

=== Rappel Rack ===
This consists of a 'U' shaped frame, attached to the rappeller's harness, into which snap multiple bars  that pivot from the other side of the frame. The rope is woven through as many of the bars as are required to provide sufficient friction. This arrangement allows for variations in rope diameter and condition, as well as controlled rate of descent.  Racks are seldom used in sport climbing.  Cavers often use racks on long rappels because friction can be adjusted by adding or removing bars.

== Ascenders ==
{{Main article|Ascender (climbing)}}
Ascenders are mechanical devices for ascending on a rope. They are also called Jumars, after a popular brand.

Jumars perform the same functionality as friction knots but less effort is needed to use them. A Jumar employs a cam which allows the device to slide freely in one direction but tightly grip the rope when pulled on in the opposite direction. To prevent a jumar from accidentally coming off the rope, a locking carabiner is used. The Jumar is first attached to the climber's harness by a piece of webbing or sling, and then the Jumar is clipped onto the rope and locked. Two ascenders are normally used to climb a fixed rope.  For climbing a fixed rope attached to snow anchors on a steep slope, only one Jumar is used as the other hand is used for holding the [[ice axe]].

Another type of ascender allows rope to feed in either direction, slowly, but locks up when pulled quickly.  Such [[self-locking device]]s allow people to protect solo climbs because the amount of rope is automatically adjusted.

==Sling==
{{main article|Sling (climbing equipment)}}
A '''sling''' or '''runner''' is an item of [[climbing equipment]] consisting of a tied or sewn loop of [[webbing]] that can be wrapped around sections of rock, hitched (tied) to other pieces of equipment or even tied directly to a tensioned line using a [[Prusik|prusik knot]], for [[Climbing equipment#Protection devices|anchor]] extension (to reduce [[rope drag]] and for other purposes), equalisation, or climbing the rope.

===Daisy chain===
[[File:Daisychainclimbing.JPG|thumb|A daisy chain]]
A daisy chain is a strap, several feet long and typically constructed from one-inch tubular nylon webbing of the same type used in lengthening straps between anchor-points and the main rope. The webbing is [[bar tack]]ed at roughly two-inch intervals (or, in the past, tied) to create a length of small loops for attachment. Unlike the use of similar devices in backpacking, daisy chains in technical rock climbing are expected to be of sufficient strength to be "load bearing". Daisy chain pockets however are not rated to full strength, and can only take static loads.

When clipped in, daisy chains should not be shortened by clipping in another pocket to the same carabiner. Failure of the pocket stitching results in the daisy chain disconnecting from the anchor, with potentially fatal consequences. If shortening the daisy chain when clipped in, in order to eliminate dangerous slack, a second carabiner should be used to connect to the anchor.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110722082239/http://www.blackdiamondequipment.com/en-us/journal/climb/all/qc-lab-daisy-chain-dangers-en-glbl-en-us ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Though daisy chains are sometimes used by free climbers as a type of [[sling (climbing equipment)|sling]] (a quick attachment used from harness directly to a belay anchor), and for ad hoc purposes similar to those of the backpacker, the canonical use for a daisy chain is in [[aid climbing]], wherein the leader will typically attach one end to the harness, and the other to the top-most anchor placement (by [[carabiner]] or [[fifi hook]]), particularly after having ascended in [[étrier]]s as high as possible. This allows the leader to hang from the daisy chain while preparing the next anchor placement. The closely spaced loops allow fine-tuning the length from harness to anchor, thereby allowing the best possible reach for the next placement.

Daisy chains should not be confused with étriers, also known as ''aiders'', which are short ladders made in the same way, but with larger loops, also used in aid climbing, nor with load-limiting devices often known as [[screamer (climbing equipment)|screamers]] (from their first trade name) designed to simulate a dynamic [[belay]].

== Protection devices ==
Protection devices, collectively known as ''rock protection'' or ''pro'', provide the means to place temporary anchor points on the rock.  These devices may be categorized as ''passive'' (e.g., nuts) or ''active'' such as a [[spring-loaded camming device]] or SLCD.  Passive protection acts "merely" as a choke when pulled on, and constrictions in the rock prevent it from pulling out. Active protection transforms a pull on the device into an outward pressure on the rock that helps the device set more firmly. The type of protection that is most appropriate varies depending on the nature of the rock.

=== Nuts ===
{{main article|Nut (climbing)}}
[[File:Assorted Nuts and Nut Tool.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Typical nuts and a nut tool]]
[[File:Set of Hexcentrics.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Black Diamond Equipment, Ltd.|Black Diamond]] Hexcentrics]]
Nuts are manufactured in many different varieties.  In their simplest form, they are just a small block of metal attached to a loop of cord or wire.  They are used by simply wedging them into narrowing cracks in the rock, then giving them a tug to set them. Nuts are sometimes referred to by the [[slang]] term, ''wires''.

=== Hexes ===
{{main article|hexes (climbing)}}
''Hexes'' are the oldest form of active protection. They consist of a hollow eccentric hexagonal prism with tapered ends, usually threaded with cord or webbing.  They are frequently placed as a passive chock, but are more commonly placed in active camming positions. In the standard active placement, a fall causes the hex to twist in its placement exerting sideways force on the rock in which it is placed. They are manufactured by several firms, with a range of sizes varying from about 10mm thick to 100mm wide. Sides may be straight or curved.

=== Spring-loaded camming devices ===
[[File:Camalot number 6.JPG|thumb|right|An SLCD placed in a crack.]]
{{main article|Spring-loaded camming device}}
These consist of three or four [[cam]]s mounted on a common axle or two adjacent axles, in such a way that pulling on the shaft connected to the axle forces the cams to spread further apart.  The SLCD is used like a [[syringe]], by pulling the cams via a "trigger" (a small handle) which forces them closer, inserting it into a crack or pocket in the rock, and then releasing the trigger. The springs make the cams expand and grip the rock face securely.  A climbing rope may then be attached to the end of the stem via a [[sling (climbing equipment)|sling]] and [[carabiner]].  SLCDs are typically designed to maintain a constant camming angle with the rock to ensure that the normal force provided by the cam lobes against the rock face will supply enough friction to hold a cam in equilibrium with the rock. These devices are also known as "friends" for example, as they are in the UK. &lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081025052215/http://www.duke.edu/~mak25/research.html ]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tricams===
{{main article|Tricam}}
A ''Tricam'' is a device that can be used as either active or passive protection. It consists of a shaped aluminium block attached to a length of [[sling (climbing equipment)|tape]] (webbing). The block is shaped so that pulling on the tape makes it cam against the crack, gripping the rock tighter. Careful placement is necessary so that the "cam" does not loosen when not loaded. It is generally not as easy to place or remove as a [[Spring-loaded camming device|SLCD]] but is much cheaper and lighter, and often is the only thing that will work in  situations like quarry drill-holes and limestone pockets.  The smaller sizes can work well in old [[piton]] scars, and can also be used passively as nuts.

== Training equipment == &lt;!-- do not change heading this without fixing links to this subsection on Glossary_of_climbing_terms and other pages --&gt;

Various items of equipment are employed during climbing-specific training.

'''Hangboards'''
[[File:Concet Climbing Solution Hangboard .jpg|alt=A wooden hangboard designed for increasing contact strength|thumb|A wooden hangboard designed for increasing contact strength in rock climbers by Concept Climbing]]
A wooden or resin board  used for improving contact strength for climbers. It develops the forearm muscles along with the tendons and pulleys of the fingers.

They  consist of a variety of different-sized pockets and edges that are designed to be hung from with various training protocols.  These pockets and edges can range from large jug holds to micro crimp edges. When used effectively they can facilitate huge gains in forearm strength and lock off strength, mostly in the [[flexor digitorum profundus]] and [[flexor digitorum superficialis]] muscles of the fore arms. They are also an apparatus with the capability to injure the user, usually in the [[Annular ligaments of fingers|A1-4 pulleys]] or along sections of [[flexor carpi sheath]] linking the different FDS or FDP sections in the forearm.

Hangboards are the best way to increase contact strength for rock climbers, and when following a well established training protocol, tremendous gains in strength can be made over the long term. Training is usually done in cycles.

Hangboards are usually mounted above a doorway, or anywhere that allows the user's body to hang freely, one of the best available attachment areas is to roof beams. They are also called fingerboards''.''

=== Grip savers ===

A small device that can help in developing the antagonist muscles to those used while gripping with the hand.  Use of such a device can prevent the ligament injuries that are frequently experienced by climbers.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

=== Campus boards ===
{{main article|Campus board}}
A series of horizontal rungs attached to an overhanging surface that may be climbed up and down without the aid of the feet.  When used properly, campus boards can improve finger strength and so-called "contact strength".

===Bachar ladder===
{{main article|Bachar ladder}}
A bachar ladder is made by stringing large diameter PVC piping on webbing and  is climbed without using the feet. It can help improve overall upper body strength as well as core strength.

== Specialized clothing ==

In the early days of climbing, many would have considered specialised clothing to be cheating. In fact, the first climbers considered an untucked shirt or unbuttoned sport jacket a sign of weakness. Several climbers even chose to climb barefoot, an act that modern climbers would find amazing. In the 1980s and early 1990s, the trend was to wear tight, brightly coloured clothes often made from [[Spandex]]. The trend, now, is to wear looser-fitting clothing. Trousers can be tailored to prevent them from restricting movement by adding features such as articulated knee joints and diamond crotch.

=== Helmet ===
[[File:Climbing helmet.jpg|thumb|right|A Petzl Elios climbing helmet designed for caving and mountaineering]]
[[File:Black Diamond Half Dome Climbing Helmet.JPG|thumb|left|[[Black Diamond Equipment]] Half Dome climbing helmet]]

The climbing helmet is a piece of safety equipment that primarily protects     the skull against falling debris (such as rocks or dropped pieces of protection) and impact forces during a fall.  For example, if a lead climber allows the rope to wrap behind an ankle, a fall can flip the climber over and consequently impact the back of the head. Furthermore, any effects of pendulum from a fall that have not been compensated for by the belayer may also result in head injury to the climber.  The risk of head injury to a falling climber can be further significantly mitigated by [[Lead climbing injuries#Falling correctly|falling correctly]].

Climbers may decide whether to wear a helmet based on a number of factors such as the type of climb being attempted, concerns about weight, reductions in agility, added encumbrances, or simple vanity. Additionally, there is less incentive to wear a helmet in artificial climbing environments like indoor climbing walls  (where routes and [[Climbing hold|holds]] are regularly maintained) than on natural multi-pitch routes or ice climbing routes (where falling rocks and/or ice are likely).

=== Climbing shoes ===
{{main article|Climbing shoe}}
Specifically designed [[foot wear]] is usually worn for [[climbing]].  To increase the grip of the [[foot]] on a [[climbing wall]] or rock face due to [[friction]], the shoe is soled with a vulcanized rubber layer.  Usually, shoes are only a few millimetres thick and fit very snugly around the foot.  Stiffer shoes are used for "edging", more compliant ones for "smearing". Some have foam padding on the heel to make descents and rappels more comfortable. Climbing shoes can be re-soled which decreases the frequency that shoes need to be replaced.

=== Belay gloves ===
[[File:Belayglove.saa.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|A belay glove]]

A belay glove is a glove constructed from either leather or a synthetic substitute, is used to protect the hands when belaying, and is especially useful  if using a classic or body belay. They are also very useful for controlling the  belay with single, lead ropes that are 9.5&amp;nbsp;mm or smaller.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100316020555/http://www.supertopo.com/a/Climbing_Glove_and_Belay_Glove_Buying_Advice/a10553n.html ]&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, belay gloves can lessen the possibility of rope burn and the subsequent involuntary release of the rope.

== Miscellaneous equipment ==
=== Tape ===
Medical tape is useful to both prevent and repair minor injuries. For example, tape is often used to fix [[Glossary of climbing terms#flapper|flappers]].  Many climbers use tape to bind fingers or wrists to prevent recurring tendon problems.  Tape is also highly desirable for protecting hands on climbing routes that consist mostly of repeated [[Climbing technique#jamming|hand jamming]].

"Tape" can also refer to nylon webbing.

=== Haul bag ===
A haul bag refers to a large, tough, and often unwieldy bag into which supplies and climbing equipment can be thrown.  A rucksack or day pack often has a webbing, haul loop on the top edge.

Haul bags are often affectionately known as "pigs" due to their unwieldy nature.

=== Gear sling ===
A gear sling is usually used by [[trad climbing|trad]] (traditional), or big wall climbers when they have too much gear to fit onto the gear loops of their harnesses. The simplest forms are homemade slings of webbing; more elaborate forms are padded.

=== Chalk ===
Chalk is used by nearly all climbers to absorb problematic moisture, often sweat, on the hands. Typically, chalk is stored as a loose powder in a special chalk bag designed to prevent spillage, most often closed with  a drawstring. This chalk bag is then hung by a carabiner from the climbing harness or from a simple belt worn around the climber's waist . This allows the climber to re-chalk during the climb with minimal interruption or effort. To prevent excess chalking (which can actually ''decrease'' friction), some climbers will store their chalk in a chalk ball, which is then kept in the chalk bag. A chalk ball is a very fine, mesh sack that allows chalk release with minimum leakage when squeezed so that the climber can control the amount of chalk  on the hands.

Chalk is most frequently white, and the repeated use of holds by freshly-chalked hands leads to chalky build-up. While this isn't a concern in an indoor gym setting, white chalk build-up on the natural rock of outdoor climbs is considered to be an eyesore at best, and many consider it a legitimate environmental/conservation concern. In the United States, the [[Bureau of Land Management]] advocates the use of chalk that matches the color of the native rock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blm.gov/wo/st/en/prog/Recreation/recreation_national/Climbing.print.html |title=Climbing |website=Blm.gov |date=2016-04-07 |accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several popular climbing areas, like [[Arches National Park]] have banned white chalk, instead allowing the use of rock-colored chalk. [[Garden of the Gods]] has gone further, banning the use of [[magnesium carbonate]] (the most common chalk) outright, requiring the use of a rock-colored substitute. A handful of companies make colored chalk or a chalk substitute designed to comply with these environmental conservation measures.

'''Saputo Stadium''' ({{lang-fr|link=no|'''Stade Saputo'''}}) is a [[soccer-specific stadium]] at [[Olympic Park, Montreal|Olympic Park]] in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], Canada. The stadium opened on May 21, 2008, and is the current home of the [[Montreal Impact]]. The stadium is built on the former practice track and field site on the grounds of the [[1976 Summer Olympics]], while the stadium's east side has a view of [[Olympic Stadium (Montreal)|Olympic Stadium's]] inclined tower. It has a capacity of 20,801,&lt;ref name="capacity"/&gt; making it the second-largest soccer-specific stadium in Canada, after [[BMO Field]] in [[Toronto]].

==Construction==
The stadium cost {{CAD|link=yes|17 million}} (${{formatprice|{{Inflation|CA|17000000|2008}}}} in {{Inflation-year|CA}} dollars){{inflation-fn|CA}} to build, with $7.5 million paid by the Saputo family and the rest financed on a 25-year term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.impactmontreal.com/en/stadium/stadium-expansion|title=Stade Saputo Expansion|publisher=www.impactmontreal.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150314232948/http://www.impactmontreal.com/en/stadium/stadium-expansion|archivedate=March 14, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saputo Stadium is now the Impact's administrative headquarters and also includes a training field, 34 corporate suites and full player welfare areas. The complex covers approximately {{convert|1600000|sqft|m2}}. It was designed and fabricated by Dant Clayton Corporation and built by Broccolini Construction Inc.

The stadium features a natural grass playing surface and was reportedly preferred over BMO Field for this reason by members of the [[Canada men's national soccer team]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Morgan|last=Campbell|title=Natural Grass 'Not Hot on Radar' for BMO Field|url=https://www.thestar.com/Sports/Soccer/article/501277|newspaper=[[The Toronto Star]]|date=September 18, 2008|accessdate=September 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; BMO Field has since installed a heated and fully irrigated natural grass field similar to those found in the English [[Premier League]].

Anticipating a Montreal entry into [[Major League Soccer]], plans were made to expand the stadium from its initial 13,034 capacity to 20,000 to cope with the anticipated boost in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fanatique.ca/impact/montreal2012+6149.html Montréal se joint à la MLS en 2012] (May 7, 2010). &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cyberpresse.ca/sports/soccer/201005/07/01-4278193-joey-saputo-montreal-aura-enfin-le-soccer-quil-merite.php|title=Joey Saputo: Montréal aura enfin le soccer qu'il mérite|publisher=La Presse Canadienne|date= May 7, 2010|first=Frédéric|last=Daigle}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Quebec government put $23 million for the renovation and expansion of the stadium (the total cost of the stadium was therefore about $40 million). The construction plans went into effect after MLS granted Montreal their [[Montreal Impact|nineteenth franchise]], which began play in the [[2012 Major League Soccer season|2012 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Freedman|first=Jonah|title="Passionate" Montreal named as 19th MLS city|publisher=MLSSoccer.com|date=May 7, 2010|url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/passionate-montreal-named-19th-mls-city|accessdate=May 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports usage==
The stadium welcomed its first Impact home game on May 19, 2008, a scoreless draw against the [[Vancouver Whitecaps (1986–2010)|Vancouver Whitecaps]]. The Impact's first goal in the stadium was scored by [[Rocco Placentino]] against the [[Charleston Battery]] on June 13, 2008. This also gave the Impact its first victory in the stadium, with a score of 1–0. The Impact's first game in the newly renovated and expanded Saputo was played on June 16, 2012 against the [[Seattle Sounders FC]]. The Impact won the game 4–1.

The first international at Saputo Stadium was the second leg of Canada's second stage [[CONCACAF]] World Cup Qualifying match on June 20, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tsn.ca/soccer/story/?id=235495&amp;lid=sublink02&amp;lpos=headlines_soccer|title=Saputo Stadium to host Canada's World Cup qualifier|publisher=TSN.ca|date=April 22, 2008|accessdate=March 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Space Games''' is a [[freeflying | freefly]] [[skydiving]] competition event created by 'Father of '[[freeflying | FreeFly]]' [[Olav Zipser]].   &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalcuts.com/product_info.php?products_id=107 Zephyrhills Space Balls - Stock Footage]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early days of [[freeflying]], Zipser wanted to get the best freeflyers at the time together to research, develop, and document the performance evolution of human freeflight / [[freeflying]].

Human flight races, air games and competitions with an open-class and a pro-class were devised, and the first of its kind and first Space Games was held at Skydive America Palm Beach, Pahokee, Florida in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.1olav.com/en/space-games/ Space Games]&lt;/ref&gt;

A total of 16 Space Games events were organised between 1997 and 2006, with cash prizes totalling as much as US$35 000 per event awarded to the winners of different categories. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.1olav.com/en/space-games/history-development/ Olav Zipser Space Games History and Development]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dropzone.com/news/Competitions/2000_Skydive_America_Palm_Beach_Space_Games_8_Report_316.html Space Games 8 Report]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koyn.com/clouddancer/articles/ChiSPGA.html 1996 Skydive Chicago Space Games]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Space Games consists of human flight air races and competitions, and incorporates double elimination one-on-one races, open rounds, competition rounds, the FreeFly Indie 500, the FreeFly Atmosphere Dolphin Challenge, Fastest, Slowest and Furthest competitions, Freestyle, Sky Surf, and 3way and 4way FreeFly Challenges.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070214133219/http://www.bpa.org.uk/skydive/pages/articles/jun00/birthoffreefly.htm British Parachute Association article], retrieved 10 Sep 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Space Games came about as a result of the Atmosphere Dolphin FreeFly License Program ran through [[Olav Zipser | Olav ZIpser's]] [[The First School of Modern SkyFlying | First School of Modern SkyFlying]].  Zipser used a constant speed and direction measuring device (space balls) around which high speed precision [[freeflying | freefly]] athletes could train and be tested to fly to the same standard.  This provided the testing ground for the research and development of [[freeflying]], and opened up the possibility for a number of human flight air games and competitions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dropzone.com/cgi-bin/safety/detail_page.cgi?ID=316 DropZone.com article], retrieved 10 Sep 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1st Space Games was held at Skydive America Palm Beach, Pahokee, Florida in 1997.

The most recent and 16th Space Games was held at Skydive Sport Center Tortuga, Arezzo, Italy in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.1olav.com/en/space-games/history-development/ Space Games History and Development]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stade Aimé Giral''' is a [[multi-purpose stadium]] in [[Perpignan]], [[France]]. It is currently used mostly for [[rugby union]] matches and is the home stadium of [[USA Perpignan]]. 

==History==
The stadium also hosted the majority of [[Catalans Dragons]] home matches in the [[rugby league]] club's first two seasons in [[Super League]] in [[Super League XI|2006]] and [[Super League XII|2007]]. The Dragons have since renovated their own ground, [[Stade Gilbert Brutus]], and now play all their home matches there. The stadium has been expanded from a capacity of 13,500 to 14,593 in a project that ended in 2008.

The stadium has the name of early club fly-half Aimé Giral, who died during the [[First World War]]. Seven USA Perpignan players died during this war.

==Cricket fan==
Since 2003, Sudhir Chaudhary's passion has been to watch cricket matches played by India and to support the team. By April 2010, he had attended approximately 150 matches, often traveling by bicycle to reach the venue of match.&lt;ref name=bbc1&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8636516.stm |title= India's most devoted cricket fan?|last=Sugavanam  |first=Saisudha |work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=23 April 2010 | date=22 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He sometimes pedals his cycle to cricket playing venues, as he did to [[Bangladesh]] to witness a cricket match in 2007 &lt;ref name=bangla/&gt; and to [[Lahore]], Pakistan in 2006.&lt;ref name=ticket/&gt; To save money, he sometimes braves ticketless travel in trains to reach venues.&lt;ref name=bbc1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cricketcountry.com/cricket-articles/Sachin-Tendulkar-s-most-dedicated-fan-to-complete-a-decade-of-god-worship/32398&lt;/ref&gt; When attending cricket matches, he paints his body with the tri- colour, the colours of India flag, and he usually paints the name of Tendulkar on his chest.&lt;ref name=fan&gt;{{cite news|last=Lokapally|first=Vijay|title='I get affection from Sachin… and match tickets'|url=http://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/i-get-affection-from-sachin-and-match-tickets/article5340142.ece|accessdate=11 November 2013|newspaper=The Hindu|date=12 November 2013|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; He carries a conch with him and blows the conch to announce the arrival of the India cricket team.&lt;ref name=fan/&gt; Sudhir Chaudhary paints his body on the previous day of a match and skips sleep that night to preserve the paint on his body.&lt;ref name=fan/&gt; He cycled for 21 days from Muzaffarpur, Bihar to Mumbai to watch Sachin play for India against Australia on 28 October 2003&lt;ref name=que/&gt; and this was the first tri-series match where he started supporting India by waving Indian tri-colour.&lt;ref name=laha&gt;{{cite news|last=Laha|first=Somshuvra|title=Sachin's fan Sudhir just likes waving the flag for him|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sachinretirement/sachin-s-fan-sudhir-just-likes-waving-the-flag-for-him/article1-1147647.aspx|accessdate=13 November 2013|newspaper=Hindustan Times|date=6 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109003701/http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sachinretirement/sachin-s-fan-sudhir-just-likes-waving-the-flag-for-him/article1-1147647.aspx|archive-date=9 November 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attack by Bangladesh Cricket fans==
In 2015, during India - Bangladesh series in Mirpur, he was attacked and harassed by Bangladesh fans booing against India, when he was trying to leave the stadium. He feared his life but was eventually rescued by Bangladesh Police. &lt;ref name=espnbang&gt;{{cite web|last=Muthu|first=Alagappan|title=Indian fan given security cover in Mirpur|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/20636480/indian-fan-given-security-cover-mirpur|publisher=espn crick info|accessdate=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2011 ICC Cricket World Cup==
During the World Cup, Sudhir sported a kooky crown - a replica World Cup trophy. Sudhir's crowning moment came on April 2, 2011, the day India defeated Sri Lanka in the Final at [[Wankhede Stadium]], Mumbai, to become the World Champions. Sachin Tendulkar himself signaled Sudhir who was sitting among the cheering Indian fans, to come to the Indian dressing room and join the team's celebrations.&lt;ref name=fan/&gt; Tendulkar asked [[Zaheer Khan]] to bring the World Cup over. Tendulkar shook hands with Sudhir Chaudhary, hugged him and finally let him lift the cup from Zaheer’s hands. Tendulkar allowed Sudhir to hold the World Cup along with him and Sudhir celebrated the occasion by posing for photographs.&lt;ref name=espn&gt;{{cite web|last=Sharda|first=Ugra|title=Three tales from Indian cricket|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/657579.html|publisher=espn crick info 4.8.2013|accessdate=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sudhir chanted "India" as he lifted the [[ICC World Cup 2011]] trophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chakravartty|first=Sougat |title=Sudhir Choudhrie: The ultimate devotee of Indian cricket|url=http://www.sportskeeda.com/2013/10/15/sudhir-kumar-chaudhary-the-ultimate-devotee-of-indian-cricket/ |publisher=sportskeeda.com|accessdate=17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barton|first=Joe|title=Superfan readies for Sachin's last stand

===Apology by the police===
In March 2009, a Senior Police officer intercepted and thrashed Sudhir Kumar in [[Kanpur]], when he tried to shake hands with Sachin Tendulkar during a practice session. Later, after Tendulkar's intervention and request he was let off, and the police officer tendered an apology to Sudhir Kumar, repenting the event.&lt;ref name=apology/&gt; Sudhir Kumar stopped the practice of scaling fences to reach the team to celebrate a win, only after Tendulkar advised against such practice.&lt;ref name=fan/&gt; After this incident, the BCCI has sponsored Sudhir Kumar for every match.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

==Personal life==
Sudhir Choudhary was born in a very poor family in a semi-rural place of [[Muzaffarpur]], [[Bihar]]. He became obsessed with Indian cricket and a fan of Sachin Tendulkar at the age of 6. He left his studies at the age of 14 when he was in his secondary school.  He is unemployed, having previously worked for a milk company and trained as a teacher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cricages.com/others/a-die-hard-fan/|title=Sudhir Choudhary – A Die-Hard Sachin Fan|first=|last=|work=cricages.com|year=2011|accessdate=22 August 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110825200834/http://www.cricages.com/others/a-die-hard-fan/|archive-date=25 August 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He postponed his marriage so that he could watch all the matches played by the Indian cricket team,&lt;ref name=ticket/&gt; and wants to follow the team all over the world, wherever it plays.&lt;ref name=ticket/&gt; This style of living followed by Sudhir Kumar has made his parents unhappy,&lt;ref name=ticket/&gt; and he once threatened [[self-immolation]] if he was not assured of watching all cricket matches played by the Indian cricket team.&lt;ref name=dna/&gt; He declared that his life is dedicated to watching Indian cricket matches and he lives his life on public support.&lt;ref name=dna/&gt;

Sudhir Kumar is one of three principal roles of a documentary film ''Beyond All Boundaries'' which tells the stories of three different personalities of Indian Cricket and he is shown as a super fan of the sport.&lt;ref name=beyond&gt;{{cite news|last=Bhattacharya|first=Buddaditya|title=Being a sport |url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/being-a-sport/article5222502.ece|accessdate=13 November 2013|newspaper=The Hindu|date=11 October 2013|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title = Beyond All Boundaries|url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2428368/plotsummary?ref_=tt_ov_pl|date = 2013-04-01|accessdate = 2015-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Made by film maker Sushrut Jain, the film shows details about the personal life of Sudhir Kumar.

After the retirement of Sachin Tendulkar, Sudhir keeps cheering for the Indian Cricket Team sporting Miss-U Tendulkar on his body.

'''TIAA Bank Field''' is an [[American football]] stadium located in [[Jacksonville, Florida]], that primarily serves as the home facility of the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL). The stadium opened in 1995 as '''Jacksonville Municipal Stadium''' on the site of the old [[Gator Bowl Stadium]] (erected 1927), and included some portions of the older stadium. Located on the [[St. Johns River]], it sits on {{convert|10|acres}} of land in [[downtown Jacksonville]]. 

In addition to hosting the Jaguars, the stadium is also regularly used for [[college football]], concerts, and other events. It is the regular site of the annual [[Florida–Georgia football rivalry|Florida–Georgia game]], a college football rivalry game between the [[University of Florida]] and the [[University of Georgia]]. The stadium is also the home of the annual [[Gator Bowl]], a post-season college [[bowl game]]. Additionally, the stadium hosted [[Super Bowl XXXIX]] in 2005 and is one of the venues used by the [[United States men's national soccer team]]. 

From 1997 to 2006, the stadium was named '''Alltel Stadium''' after communications company [[Alltel]] purchased [[naming rights]]. The facility was renamed EverBank Field in 2010, following the approval of a five-year, naming rights deal with the financial services company [[EverBank]]. The agreement was extended in 2014 for an additional 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=EverBank, Jaguars extend stadium naming rights agreement|url=http://www.jaguars.com/news/article-JaguarsNews/EverBank-Jaguars-extend-stadium-naming-rights-agreement/5247142e-8941-41ea-9da3-2514d0391a75|publisher=Jacksonville Jaguars|date=July 25, 2014|accessdate=February 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jaguars announced in February 2018 the stadium would be renamed [[TIAA Bank]] Field for the [[2018 NFL season]] after EverBank was acquired by New York-based [[TIAA]].&lt;ref name="New name"&gt;{{cite news|last=Heilman|first=Phillip|title=New name for Jaguars’ stadium: TIAA Bank Field|url=http://www.jacksonville.com/sports/20180216/new-name-for-jaguars-stadium-tiaa-bank-field|newspaper=The Florida Times-Union|date=February 16, 2018|accessdate=February 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
TIAA Bank Field is located in the [[Downtown Jacksonville#Stadium District|Stadium District]] of [[downtown Jacksonville]], which has been home to football fields since the early 20th century. In 1928 the first permanent football stadium, Fairfield Stadium, was constructed. In 1948 this was expanded and renamed [[Gator Bowl Stadium]], in honor of the annual [[Gator Bowl]] game first played two years earlier.

The current structure was built using a few portions of the historic Gator Bowl Stadium. However, all of the elements included from the older stadium — the pedestrian ramp system and the more recent West Upper Deck section of the complex — dated back only to 1982. Construction started January 3, 1994, and the new stadium opened on August 18, 1995, with an [[exhibition game]] with the [[St. Louis Rams]]. Total construction time was under 20&amp;nbsp;months and total cost was US$134&amp;nbsp;million – $60&amp;nbsp;million of which was provided by the city of Jacksonville.

===Planning===
In January 1993, representatives from the [[University of Florida]] and [[University of Georgia]] began negotiating with Jacksonville representatives to renew the contract to host the [[Florida–Georgia football rivalry|Florida–Georgia game]], the annual rivalry game between the [[college football]] teams of the two universities. The universities' five-year contract with the Gator Bowl ended after the 1994 game, and the [[Citrus Bowl (stadium)|Citrus Bowl]] had offered Florida and Georgia a larger sum of money than the Gator Bowl for the right to host the game.&lt;ref&gt;Snook, Jeff. "UF-Georgia negotiations start today", ''[[The Palm Beach Post]]''. January 12, 1993. Page C1.&lt;/ref&gt;

To counter the Citrus Bowl's larger monetary offer, Jacksonville mayor [[Ed Austin]] proposed a $25.5 million renovation plan to Jacksonville's aging Gator Bowl Stadium, which had been built in 1949. Both teams had expressed concerns about the condition of the aging stadium, and renovations were considered key to enticing the teams to keep returning to Jacksonville, bringing tens of millions of dollars in consumer spending with them.&lt;ref&gt;Florida Sun-Sentinel staff reports. "College Football", ''[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel]]''. January 22, 1993. Page C2.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the promise of renovations, Georgia athletic director [[Vince Dooley]] was unswayed,&lt;ref&gt;Palm Beach Post staff reports. "Georgia may move '96 game to Athens", ''[[The Palm Beach Post]]''. February 18, 1993. Page C8.&lt;/ref&gt; so Austin widened the scope of the renovations, increasing their price tag to $49 million, and traveled to Athens, Georgia, to talk with Dooley in person.&lt;ref&gt;Sun-Sentinel staff and wire reports. "Sports in brief", ''[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel]]''. March 4, 1993. Page C2.&lt;/ref&gt; Austin's campaigning was partially successful. On March 23, 1993, the two universities announced they had signed a five-year contract with the Gator Bowl, running from 1997 to 2002. The contract was contingent on Austin successfully passing the $49 million renovation bond issue through the [[Jacksonville City Council]] and the city completing the renovations by the 1996 game.&lt;ref&gt;Dame, Mike. "Florida-Georgia moving for '95", ''[[The Orlando Sentinel]]''. March 23, 1993. Page D1.&lt;/ref&gt; On Tuesday, May 11, the Jacksonville City Council approved a $219.5 million bond issue, including the $49 million for the renovation of the Gator Bowl.&lt;ref&gt;The Associated Press. "Gator Bowl gets funds for repairs", ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]''. May 12, 1993. Page C6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harry, Chris. "Gator Bowl plan OK'd to delight of UF, Georgia", ''[[The Tampa Tribune]]''. May 12, 1993. Page Sports 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

===NFL expansion===
Soon after the approval of the bond issue, investors interested in attracting a new [[National Football League]] team to Jacksonville requested that another $30 million be added to the $49 million renovations in order to make the stadium more attractive for a professional team.&lt;ref&gt;Tampa Tribune staff. "Pro football", ''Tampa Tribune''. May 14, 1993. Page Sports 2.&lt;/ref&gt; That number climbed higher throughout the summer, and eventually the city reached an agreement with the leading group of investors hoping to attract an NFL team to Jacksonville. On July 1, the city and investors reached a lease agreement contingent on the city investing $112.3 million for improving the Gator Bowl.&lt;ref&gt;Banks, Don. "NFL expansion a fleeting dream for Jacksonville", ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]''. July 2, 1993. Page C1.&lt;/ref&gt; The lease agreement later collapsed when the Jacksonville City Council voted to send the lease back to a committee for further study rather than approving it.&lt;ref&gt;Tampa Tribune staff report. "TD Jax! pulls out of race", ''[[The Tampa Tribune]]''. July 22, 1993. Page Sports 9.&lt;/ref&gt; One month after the proposed deal fell through, city officials and investors tried again and were successful in negotiating a deal that included a pledge to spend $121 million on renovations to the Gator Bowl.&lt;ref&gt;Sun-Sentinel staff. "Jacksonville back in race", ''[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel]]''. August 25, 1995. Page C6.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the expanded renovations, it was announced that the 1994 Florida-Georgia game would have to be moved out of the Gator Bowl, as had the 1995 game, in order to provide time for the newly expanded renovation plan to be completed before 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Snook, Jeff. "UF could host 1994 Georgia game", ''[[The Palm Beach Post]]''. September 1, 1993. Page C9.&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, the expanded bond issue and renovation program proved to be successful, as Jacksonville was awarded the 30th NFL franchise—the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]]—on November 30, 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Browning, Michael. "Fantastic finish wins NFL team for Jacksonville", ''[[The Miami Herald]]''. Dec. 1, 1993. Page A1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost as soon as the celebration surrounding Jacksonville's new NFL team died down, however, a renovation contractor's plan to give 8% of the stadium work to [[Minority group|minority]]-owned businesses drew criticism. The [[NAACP]] and another group said African-American businesses should have been awarded twice that amount of work.&lt;ref&gt;The Associated Press. "Groups criticize contractor's plan", ''[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel]]''. December 25, 1993. Page A26.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current stadium==
The stadium's re-opening day was also the home debut of the Jaguars during the [[1995 NFL season]]. It was the first time that an expansion NFL team had played its first game in a new facility; they played the [[Tennessee Titans|Houston Oilers]] in the opener and lost 10&amp;ndash;3. The [[Gator Bowl]] returned as a New Year's Day bowl game on January 1, 1996, following the 1995 NCAA season.

The stadium contains 11,200 club seats, 88 luxury suites, and a "super suite".&lt;ref name="ballparks"/&gt;

In 1997, the stadium changed its name to Alltel Stadium after naming rights were acquired by [[Alltel]], a telecommunications company best known as a [[mobile phone|wireless]] carrier. The name Alltel Stadium stopped being used by the city after January 2007 when the contract expired; by that point, most of Alltel's assets had been purchased by [[Verizon]].

[[File:Superbowl XXXIX, 2005.JPG|thumb|left|238px|[[Super Bowl XXXIX]]]]
In 2005, the stadium hosted [[Super Bowl XXXIX]] in which the [[New England Patriots]] defeated the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] 24–21 in front of 78,125, the largest Super Bowl in attendance since 1994. [[Paul McCartney]] performed at halftime, performing [[Beatles]] classics "[[Drive My Car]]", "[[Get Back]]", and "[[Hey Jude]]", as well as a firework-filled "[[Live and Let Die (song)|Live and Let Die]]". In 2003 and 2004, $47&amp;nbsp;million in improvements to the stadium were implemented to prepare for the Super Bowl. These improvements included the addition of a unique sports bar in the south end zone called the "[[Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)|Bud]] Zone", a larger and wider video and scoring display from [[Daktronics]], escalators in the north and south end zone, and a new "terrace suite" called the "Sky Patio" right above the "Bud Zone" in the south end zone.&lt;ref name=Daktronics&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.daktronics.com/en-us/photos/details?pn=WP-18759&amp;cid=186431|title=Daktronics Photo Gallery: Jacksonville Jaguars, Jacksonville Municipal Stadium}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the 2005 season, mainly due to low attendance figures and looming [[blackout (broadcasting)|blackout]]s, team officials installed a series of tarps to reduce the [[seating capacity]] for Jaguars games. The covers were placed to block out seven sections in the upper north end zone and four in each upper deck section, located on the corners of each. This puts 9,703 seats out of service, leaving the stadium with 66,851 seats for the regular season.  However, in the event the Jaguars make the AFC Championship Game, the stadium can easily be expanded to full capacity.  Some believed that this was a sign that the city couldn't support an NFL team; the city is the second-smallest market in the league.  However, the current capacity is actually very close to what Wayne Weaver included in his original proposal to bring the Gator Bowl up to NFL standards.  The city council turned this plan down, mainly out of concern for not having enough seats to accommodate the annual Florida-Georgia game.

Despite the changes, however, blackouts have still occurred, including two of their first three home games in [[2007 NFL season|2007]] and nine of ten games in 2009. It is believed that the [[Great Recession|2008 US financial crisis]] played a major part in the 2009 season blackouts,{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} leading to insufficient ticket sales, with only the final home engagement of the regular season, with the [[Indianapolis Colts]], managing to sell out. However, the Jaguars' 2010 season saw a huge turnaround in ticket sales, with no games being blacked out that year. The Jaguars avoided blackouts in all games in 2011 and 2012.

For the Super Bowl, Florida–Georgia game, and occasionally the Gator Bowl, temporary bleachers are put up in the south end zone and the tarps are removed, raising capacity to over 84,000.

The attendance record was set on September 29, 2007, when 85,413 watched [[2007 Florida State Seminoles football team|Florida State]] defeat [[2007 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Alabama]] in what was dubbed the River City Showdown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=272720052|title=Lee comes off bench, rescues Florida State from Alabama|publisher=ESPN|date=September 29, 2007|accessdate=December 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each school received nearly 36,000 tickets, and the Gator Bowl Association added 5,800 seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openbuildings.com/buildings/alltel-stadium-profile-9988?_show_description=1|title=Alltel Stadium|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 26, 2010, naming rights to the stadium were bought by [[EverBank]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=EverBank buying naming rights to Jacksonville Municipal Stadium|url=http://jacksonville.com/sports/football/jaguars/2010-07-26/story/everbank-buying-naming-rights-jacksonville-municipal}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the nation's largest privately held bank holding companies with approximately $11.2 billion in assets. On August 10, the deal was officially approved by the [[Jacksonville City Council]] with a 14–3 vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Mitchell|first=Tia|title=City Council OKs EverBank Field deal|publisher=Jacksonville.com|date=August 10, 2010|url=http://jacksonville.com/sports/football/jaguars/2010-07-26/story/everbank-buying-naming-rights-jacksonville-municipal|accessdate=August 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013, Jacksonville's City Council approved $63 million in improvements to EverBank Field. Jaguars owner [[Shahid Khan]] helped finance $20 million of the cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=DiRocco|first1=Michael|title=Jaguars unveil mammoth video boards|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/jacksonville-jaguars/post/_/id/6885/jaguars-unveil-mammoth-video-boards|website=ESPN.go.com|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=October 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Renovations included two end zone video scoreboards 362-foot-long that are the largest [[High-definition video|HD]] [[LED]] of their kind in the world, a platform area in the north end zone with two wading pools, unique food and beverage offerings, interactive activities, and 55,000 square feet of HD video screens, which is a world record for a stadium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firstcoastnews.com/story/sports/2014/06/30/jaguars-video-board-dallas-texans/11820057/ Jaguars: 'Not everything is bigger in Texas']. Retrieved 16 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Construction of the platform resulted in the removal of approximately 7,000 seats, though temporary seating can be installed for major events that will require a larger stadium capacity. During the construction a live webcam was set up to view the progress of the new video scoreboards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jaguars.com/livecam/|title=Jaguars.com Live Cam|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scoreboards were publicly unveiled on July 26, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2014/7/27/5941601/jaguars-worlds-largest-scoreboards-everbank-field|title=Jaguars unveil world's largest scoreboards at EverBank Field|first=Ryan Van|last=Bibber|date=27 July 2014|publisher=SB Nation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the middle of 2016, the Jaguars and the city of Jacksonville announced $90 million in improvements to the stadium. Phase 1 includes the improvements to club seating, sponsored by [[US Assure]], new walkout patios at the 50-yard-line and the creation of a new south end zone tunnel that will be the new team entrance and create two new seating environments. Phase 2 includes the construction of an amphitheater ([[Daily's Place]]) and a covered flex field; both phases were completed in May 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jaguars.com/news/article-PressRelease/Jaguars-and-city-of-Jacksonville-unveil-totally-reimagined-US-Assure-Club-at-EverBank-Field/982673e3-7c0e-4520-a611-10e32ae14a9b Jaguars and city of Jacksonville unveil totally reimagined US Assure Club at EverBank Field] August 1, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

After the successful [[2017 Jacksonville Jaguars season|2017 season]] which saw the Jaguars return to the playoffs for the first time since the [[2007 Jacksonville Jaguars season|2007 season]] and host a playoff game for the first time since [[1999 Jacksonville Jaguars season|1999]], the Jaguars announced the removal of last of the tarps on the upper levels. The removal adds 3,501 seats to the capacity of the stadium bringing total capacity to 67,814.&lt;ref name="2018jjmg"/&gt;

'''''The Winning Season''''' is a 2004 [[television film]] with elements of a fantasy drama.  It chronicles a young boy's dream in 1985 with playing with the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]]' great [[Honus Wagner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=An Early Great|newspaper=New York Times|date=April 4, 2004|author=Margo Nash with Robert Strauss}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The film follows the dream to the point where the boy is assisting Wagner in his [[1909 World Series]] duel with fellow hall-of-famer [[Ty Cobb]].  It is adapted from the children's novel ''[[Honus &amp; Me]]'' by [[Dan Gutman]].

==Production==
The film was made by [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]] and first broadcast on April 4, 2004.  Modine prepared for his role as Wagner by playing with a minor-league team, the IronBirds in [[Aberdeen, Maryland]], owned by [[Cal Ripken, Jr.]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Leopold|first=Todd|title=Taking on 'The Flying Dutchman'|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2004/SHOWBIZ/TV/04/02/matthew.modine/index.html|accessdate=11 February 2013|newspaper=CNN|date=April 5, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reaction==
Variety condemned the film as "schlocky" and sentimental.  Their critic found Modine's performance started to wear and Davis brought "little conviction", but praised director John Kent Harrison for the performance he got out of Rendall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gallo|first=Phil|title=The Winning Season (Review)|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117923501/|work=Variety|date=Apr 1, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Kristin Davis]] - as Mandy
* [[Mark Rendall]] - as Joe Soshack

'''USA Cricket''' is the governing body of [[cricket]] in the United States. Founded on September 24, 2017, 173 years after the first international match between Canada and the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/20800742/new-american-governing-body-branded-usa-cricket|title=New American governing body branded as USA Cricket|work=ESPNcricinfo|access-date=2017-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; the organization replaced [[United States of America Cricket Association|USACA]] as the governing body in the US following USACA's expulsion from the [[International Cricket Council]] during the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.icc-cricket.com/news/481375|title=USA Cricket launch brand on historic day|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=2017-09-25|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="times of india"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gladson|first1=J.A.C.|title=USA Cricket getting closer to becoming a new federation|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/usa-cricket-getting-closer-to-becoming-a-new-federation/articleshow/60843288.cms|accessdate=8 November 2017|work=Times of India|date=September 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In June 2017, the ICC voted to expel the USACA from the ICC, due to issues with governance of the sport in the United States, with control of the [[United States national cricket team|United States national team]] handed over to [[ICC Americas]] until a new board was formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/19706136/usaca-expelled-icc|title=USACA expelled by the ICC|work=ESPNcricinfo|access-date=2017-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the year, on September 24, USA Cricket was launched as the USACAs replacement, as recognized by the ICC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/20800742/new-american-governing-body-branded-usa-cricket|title=New American governing body branded as USA Cricket|work=ESPNcricinfo|access-date=2017-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Constitution ==
On December 18, 2017 a new national governing body for cricket in the USA took a step closer to fruition with the formal approval of a new constitution for the sport – paving the way for historic elections in 2018. The Sustainable Foundation Advisory Group (SFAG), set up to unify the cricket community in the USA, has given the green light to a constitution that will see the election of a new Board, including three independent directors, of which one must be Chair.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.icc-cricket.com/media-releases/569234|title=Approved constitution marks historic landmark for cricket in USA|access-date=2017-12-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== About ==
USA Cricket is an organization in development that seeks to unify the United States based cricket community and become the sole U.S. governing body for the sport of cricket recognized by both the [[International Cricket Council|International Cricket Council (ICC)]] and the [[United States Olympic Committee|United States Olympic Committee (USOC)]]. Through a diverse Board of Directors, that will be elected by April 2018 and have representation from most cricket stakeholder groups, USA Cricket will lead the sport to new heights by creating and administering value added programs to grow and develop the sport at all levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usacricket.org/structure/|title=Structure - USA Cricket|work=USA Cricket|access-date=2017-12-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yarkon Sports Complex is surrounded by a Baptist Chapel and cottages. The large parking lot of the stadium made it extremely popular as tailgating was extremely easy. The stadium was also very popular due to the close distance to bus and train stations. The seat was a mix of stadium seats and picnic tables.&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Baseball's Longest Games: A Comprehensive Worldwide Record Book|author=Lowry, P.J.|date=2010|publisher=McFarland, Incorporated, Publishers|isbn=9780786457342|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RQtjqXmdFOsC|page=254|accessdate=2015-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
