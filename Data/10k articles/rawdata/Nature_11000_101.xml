[[File:Parhelio en La Cañada.JPG|thumb|160px|Faint 120° parhelion on the parhelic circle.]]
A '''120° parhelion''' (plural: '''120° parhelia''') is a relatively rare [[Halo (optical phenomenon)|halo]], an [[optical phenomenon]] occasionally appearing along with very bright [[sun dog]]s (also called parhelia) when [[ice crystal]]-saturated [[cirrus cloud]]s fill the atmosphere. The 120° parhelia are named for appearing in pair on the [[parhelic circle]] ±120° from the sun.&lt;ref name="paraselene"&gt;{{cite web

}} (including a [[HaloSim]] simulation.)&lt;/ref&gt;

When visible, 120° parhelia appear as white-bluish bright spots on the white parhelic circle and are the product of at least two interior reflections in the [[hexagon]]al ice crystals.  Their colour together with them being rather obscure can make observing them difficult as they tend to fuse with the clouds in the sky.&lt;ref name="atoptics-120-parhelia"&gt;{{cite web

== Overview ==
Several theories were made as to the origin of the sightings - from it being a [[meteoroid]] to a [[UFO]]. Initially, the most prominent theory was that it was an old [[artificial satellite]] (i.e. a large piece of [[space debris|space junk]]) re-entering the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2207180/Huge-fireballs-shoot-night-sky-spectacular-meteor-shower---turns-probably-space-junk-falling-Earth.html?ito=feeds-newsxml |title=Huge fireballs shoot across night sky in spectacular 'meteor' shower ... but turns out it was probably space junk falling back to Earth |date=22 September 2012 |publisher=[[The Daily Mail]] |archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120923035839/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2207180/Huge-fireballs-shoot-night-sky-spectacular-meteor-shower---turns-probably-space-junk-falling-Earth.html |archivedate=2012-09-23 |deadurl=no |access-date=2012-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thestar.co.uk/news/fireball-in-sky-above-sheffield-believed-to-be-space-junk-1-4957584 |title=Fireball in sky above Sheffield believed to be ‘space junk’ |date= 27 September 2012 |publisher=The Star | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014175839/http://www.thestar.co.uk/news/fireball-in-sky-above-sheffield-believed-to-be-space-junk-1-4957584 | archivedate=2012-10-14 | deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-19683728 |title='Meteor shower' over Northern Ireland 'space junk' |date=22 September 2012 |publisher=BBC News | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120923235849/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-19683728 | archivedate=2012-09-23 | deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, later analysis showed that it was highly unlikely to be space junk; it travelled too fast, towards the slow end of the range of possible meteor speeds&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sattrackcam.blogspot.nl/2012/09/more-on-21-september-2012-fireball-why.html |title=More on the 21 September 2012 fireball: why it definitely was a meteor |date=24 September 2012 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927171349/http://sattrackcam.blogspot.nl/2012/09/more-on-21-september-2012-fireball-why.html | archivedate=2012-09-27 | deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in addition, it traversed the sky from east to west while almost all satellites orbit from west to east or north and south.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sattrackcam.blogspot.nl/2012/09/fireball-over-n-europe-on-21-september.html |title=Fireball over N-Europe on 21 September 2012, 21:45 GMT was likely NOT a reentry |date=22 September 2012 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120925233007/http://sattrackcam.blogspot.nl/2012/09/fireball-over-n-europe-on-21-september.html | archivedate=2012-09-25 | deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Finnish mathematician Esko Lyytinen, the meteor was captured by Earth's gravity and entered the atmosphere once again above USA and Canada 155 minutes later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lunarmeteoritehunters.blogspot.fi/2012/09/breaking-news-uk-earth-hugging-asteroid.html |title=Breaking News - UK Earth-hugging Asteroid Circled the Earth and Hit Again |date=28 September 2012 |author=Esko Lyytinen |publisher=LunarMeteorite Hunter | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512182307/http://lunarmeteoritehunters.blogspot.fi/2012/09/breaking-news-uk-earth-hugging-asteroid.html | archivedate=2013-05-12 | deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; If confirmed, this would classify it as an [[Earth-grazing fireball|Earth-grazing meteor]].

'''{{mp|2017 VL|2}}''' is a micro-[[asteroid]], classified as a [[near-Earth object]] of the [[Apollo asteroid|Apollo group]]. It was first observed by [[Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System|ATLAS]] at [[Mauna Loa Observatory]] on 10 November 2017, a day after it passed inside the orbit of Earth.&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt;&lt;ref name="iawn" /&gt;

== Orbit and classification ==

{{mp|2017 VL|2}} is a [[Apollo asteroid]], the largest subgroup of [[near-Earth object]]s. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.9–1.5&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]] once every 16 months (498 days; [[semi-major axis]] of 1.23&amp;nbsp;AU). Its orbit has an [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 0.23 and an [[orbital inclination|inclination]] of 12[[Degree (angle)|°]] with respect to the [[ecliptic]].&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt; It is, however, not a [[Mars-crossing asteroid]], as its [[aphelion]] of 1.51&amp;nbsp;AU is less than the orbit of the Red Planet at 1.666&amp;nbsp;AU.&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;

=== Close approaches ===

The object has a [[minimum orbital intersection distance]] with Earth of {{convert |0.0012 |AU |km |abbr=on |lk=off |sigfig=3 |order=flip}}, which corresponds to 0.5 [[Lunar distance (astronomy)|lunar distances]].&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt; On 9 November 2017, it came within 0.31 [[Lunar distance (astronomy)|lunar distances]] of the Earth ''(see diagrams)''.&lt;ref name="iawn" /&gt;

== Physical characteristics ==

{{mp|2017 VL|2}} has been estimated to measure between 6 and 32 meters in diameter,&lt;ref name="metro" /&gt; comparable to the [[Chelyabinsk meteor]], which was also not observed before it hit the atmosphere over Russia in 2013. For an assumed [[astronomical albedo|albedo]] of 0.20, which is typical for the common [[S-type asteroid]]s, {{mp|2017 VL|2}}'s  diameter would be likely 18 meters only.&lt;ref name="h" /&gt;

As of 2018, no rotational [[lightcurve]] of this asteroid has been obtained from photometric observations. The object's [[rotation period]], [[Poles of astronomical bodies|pole]] and shape remain unknown.&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lcdb" /&gt;

== Numbering and naming ==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11331">'''Water chemistry analyses''' are carried out to identify and quantify the chemical components and properties of water samples. The type and sensitivity of the analysis  depends on the purpose of the analysis and the anticipated use of the water.
Chemical water analysis is carried out on water used in industrial processes, on waste-water stream, on rivers and stream, on rainfall and on the sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/379053/LIT_6898.pdf|title=Technical Guidance Note (Monitoring) M18  Monitoring of discharges to water and sewer|publisher= Environment Agency|access-date=30 July 2016| date= November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In all cases the results of the analysis provides information that can be used to make decisions or to provide re-assurance that conditions are as expected.
The analytical parameters selected are chosen to be appropriate for the decision making process or to establish acceptable normality.
Water chemistry analysis is often the groundwork of studies of [[water quality]], [[water pollution|pollution]], [[hydrology]] and [[Hydrothermal vent|geothermal water]]s.
Analytical methods routinely used can detect and measure all the natural elements and their inorganic compounds and a very wide range of organic chemical species using methods such as [[gas chromatography]] and [[mass spectrometry]]. In water treatment plants producing drinking water and in some industrial processes using products with distinctive taste and odours, specialised [[organoleptic]] methods may be used to detect smells at very low concentrations.

==Environmental water==
[[File:Everglades Sampling Location, September 20, 2014 (15834616445).jpg|thumb|An [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] scientist samples water in Florida [[Everglades]]]]
Samples of water from the natural environment are routinely taken and analysed as part of a pre-determined monitoring programme by  regulatory authorities to ensure that waters remain [[water pollution|unpolluted]], or if polluted, that the levels of pollution are not increasing or are falling in line with an agreed remediation plan. An example of such a scheme is the [[Harmonised monitoring scheme]] operated on all the major river systems in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.defra.gov.uk/evidence/statistics/environment/inlwater/iwhmsdb.htm |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130402151656/http://archive.defra.gov.uk/evidence/statistics/environment/inlwater/iwhmsdb.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2 April 2013 |title=Harmonised Monitoring Sceme |publisher=DEFRA |access-date=30 July 2016 |date=7 December 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The parameters analysed will be highly dependent on nature of the local environment and/or the polluting sources in the area. In many cases the parameters will reflect the national and local [[Freshwater environmental quality parameters|water quality standards]] determined by law or other regulations. Typical parameters for  ensuring that unpolluted surface waters remain within acceptable chemical standards include [[pH]], major [[cation]]s and [[anion]]s including [[Ammonia]], [[Nitrate]], [[Nitrite]], [[Phosphate]], [[Electrical conductivity|Conductivity]], [[Chemical oxygen demand|COD]], [[Phenol]] and [[Biochemical oxygen demand|BOD]].

==Drinking water supplies==
Surface or ground water abstracted for the supply of drinking water must be capable of meeting rigorous [[Drinking water quality standards|chemical standards]] following treatment. This requires a detailed knowledge of the water entering the treatment plant. In addition to the normal suite of environmental chemical parameters, other parameters such as [[Water hardness|hardness]], [[Phenol]], [[Oil]] and in some cases a real-time organic profile of the incoming water as in the [[Dee Regulation Scheme#Quality management|River Dee regulation scheme]].

==Industrial process water==
In industrial process, the control of the quality of process water can be critical to the quality of the end product. Water is often used as a carrier of reagents  and the loss of reagent to product must be continuously monitored to ensure that correct replacement rate. Parameters measured relate specifically to the process in use and to any of the expected contaminants that may arise as by-products. This may include unwanted organic chemicals appearing in an inorganic chemical process through contamination with oils and greases from machinery. Monitoring the quality of the waste water discharged from industrial premises is a key factor in controlling and minimising pollution of the environment. In this application  monitoring schemes analyse for all possible contaminants arising within the process and in addition contaminants that may have particularly adverse impacts on the environment such as [[Cyanide]] and many organic species such as [[pesticide]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyNET.exe/20008SJY.TXT?ZyActionD=ZyDocument&amp;Client=EPA&amp;Index=Prior+to+1976&amp;Docs=&amp;Query=&amp;Time=&amp;EndTime=&amp;SearchMethod=1&amp;TocRestrict=n&amp;Toc=&amp;TocEntry=&amp;QField=&amp;QFieldYear=&amp;QFieldMonth=&amp;QFieldDay=&amp;IntQFieldOp=0&amp;ExtQFieldOp=0&amp;XmlQuery=&amp;File=D%3A%5Czyfiles%5CIndex%20Data%5C70thru75%5CTxt%5C00000000%5C20008SJY.txt&amp;User=ANONYMOUS&amp;Password=anonymous&amp;SortMethod=h%7C-&amp;MaximumDocuments=1&amp;FuzzyDegree=0&amp;ImageQuality=r75g8/r75g8/x150y150g16/i425&amp;Display=p%7Cf&amp;DefSeekPage=x&amp;SearchBack=ZyActionL&amp;Back=ZyActionS&amp;BackDesc=Results%20page&amp;MaximumPages=1&amp;ZyEntry=1&amp;SeekPage=x&amp;ZyPURL |title=Handbook for Monitoring Industrial wastewater|publisher= Environmental Protection Agency (USA)|access-date=30 July 2016|date=August 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; In then nuclear industry analysis focuses on specific isotopes or elements of interest. Where the nuclear industry makes waste water discharges  to rivers which have drinking water abstraction on them, radio-isotopes which could potentially be harmful or those with long [[half-life|half-lives]] such as [[Tritium]] will form part of the routine monitoring suite.

==Research==
Many aspects of academic research and industrial research such as in pharmaceuticals, health products, and many others relies on accurate water analysis to identify substances of potential use, to refine those substances and to ensure that when they are manufactured for sale that the chemical composition remains consistent. The analytical methods used in these area can be very complex and may be specific to the process or area of research being conducted and may involve the use of bespoke analytical equipment.

==Forensic analysis==
In environmental management, water analysis is frequently deployed when pollution is suspected to identify the pollutant in order to take remedial action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ehp.qld.gov.au/water/monitoring/incidents.html|publisher=Queensland Government - Department of Environment and Heritage Proetection|access-date = 1 August 2016|title=Investigation of pollution incidents|date=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The analysis can often enable the polluter to be identified. Such forensic work can examine the ratios of various components and can "type" samples of oils or other mixed organic contaminants to directly link the pollutant with the source. 
In drinking water supplies the cause of unacceptable quality can similarly be determined by carefully targeted chemical analysis of samples taken throughout the distribution system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.86.8137&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|title=Forensics of water quality failure in distribution systems – a conceptual framework|access-date=2 August 2016|publisher=National Research Council Canada|date=December 2003|author1=Sadiq, R|author2= Kleiner, Y |author3=Rajani, B}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In manufacturing, off-spec products may be directly tied back to unexpected changes in wet processing stages and analytical chemistry can identify which stages may be at fault and for what reason.

==Methodology==
To ensure consistency and repeatability, the methods use in the chemical analysis of water samples are often agreed and published at a national or state level. By convention these are often referred to as "Blue book"s &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8FYkAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA128&amp;lpg=PA128&amp;dq=water+quality+%22Blue+book%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MHvjtBkTz1&amp;sig=vQnx_lWSZfM11Z19586MCDfWvMs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiRg5iLn5zOAhVOF8AKHRcWDOgQ6AEIODAD#v=onepage&amp;q=water%20quality%20%22Blue%20book%22&amp;f=false|title= State of Wisconsin Blue Book|date=1973|publisher = State of Wisconsin|page=128|access-date=30 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/standing-committee-of-analysts-sca-blue-books|title= Standing committee of analysts (SCA) blue books|access-date=30 July 2016|date=5 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The methods defined in the relevant standards can be broadly classified as:
* '''Conventional wet chemistry''' including [[Winkler method]] for [[dissolved oxygen]] , [[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]] , [[filtration]] for solids, acidification, neutralisation [[titration]] etc. Colourimetric methods such as [[MBAS assay]] which indicates [[anion]]ic [[surfactant]]s in water and on site [[comparator]] methods to determine [[Chlorine]] and [[Chloramine]]s. [[Nephelometer]]s are used to measure solids concentrations as turbidity. These methods are generally robust and well tried and inexpensive, giving a reasonable degree of accuracy at modest sensitivity.
*'''Electro chemistry''' including [[pH]], [[Conductivity (electrolytic)|Conductivity]] and dissolved oxygen using oxygen electrode. These methods yield accurate and precise results using electronic equipment capable of feeding results directly into a laboratory data management system
*[[Spectrophotometry]] particularly for metallic elements in solution producing results with very high sensitivity but which may require some sample preparation prior to analysis and may also need specialised sampling methods to avoid sample deterioration in transit.
*[[Chromatography]] is used for many organic species which are volatile or which can yield a characteristic volatile component of after initial chemical processing.
*[[Ion chromatography]] is a sensitive and stable technique that can measure [[lithium|Li]], [[Ammonium|NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] and many other low molecular weight ions using [[ion exchange]] technology.
*[[Gas chromatography]] can be used to determine [[methane]], [[carbon dioxide]], [[Cyanide]] oxygen and nitrogen and many other volatile components at reasonable sensitivities.
*[[Mass spectrometry]] is used where very high sensitivity is required and is sometimes used  as a back-end process after [[Gas liquid chromatography]] for detecting trace organic chemicals.
Depending on the components, different methods are applied to determine the quantities or ratios of the components. While some methods can be performed with standard [[laboratory]] equipment, others require advanced devices, such as [[Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry]] (ICP-MS).

The '''''Atlas of Victorian Birds''''' is a [[bird atlas]], published in 1987, covering the distribution of [[bird]]s in the Australian state of [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]].  It is based largely on 615,000 field records of birds in Victoria from the [[Atlas of Australian Birds]] database, gathered by volunteers in the course of the [[Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union]]’s atlas project from 1977 to 1981, as well as an additional 65,000 records gathered by officers of the [[National Parks and Wildlife Service (Victoria)|National Parks and Wildlife Service]] of Victoria from 1973 to 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Emison ''et al''., p.3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barrett ''et al''., p.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Layout==
The book is a [[Quarto (text)|quarto]]-sized, 272 page paperback, 295 mm in height by 210 mm wide.  The first 28 pages contain a list of contents and an introductory section explaining the scope and methodology of the atlas, including sections on Victoria’s environment and physiographic regions.  The following 244 pages are largely devoted to the accounts of about 480 species, mostly with maps showing both general and breeding distribution, a graph of the monthly recording index, a table showing breeding by month, and a brief text summary of each species’ biology and ecology in the state.&lt;ref&gt;Emison ''et al.'', pp.3-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{about|the type of lumber|the mineral property|Bird's eye maple (mineral property)}}
[[Image:Birds eye maple.jpg|right|thumb|Cutting Board made of Birdseye Maple]]

'''Bird's eye''' is a type of [[Figure (wood)|figure]] that occurs within several kinds of wood, most notably in [[hard maple]]. It has a distinctive pattern that resembles tiny, swirling eyes disrupting the smooth lines of [[wood grain|grain]]. It is somewhat reminiscent of a [[burl]], but it is quite different: the small knots that make the burl are missing.

It is not known what causes the phenomenon. Research into the cultivation of bird's eye maple has so far discounted the theories that it is caused by pecking birds deforming the wood grain or that an infecting fungus makes it twist. However, no one has demonstrated a complete understanding of any combination of climate, soil, tree variety, insects, viruses or genetic mutation that may produce the effect.

Bird's eye maple is most often found in ''[[Acer saccharum]]'' (sugar maple), but millers also find bird's eye figure in [[red maple]], [[Fraxinus americana|white ash]], [[mahogany|Cuban mahogany]], [[American beech]], [[black walnut]], and [[yellow birch]]. Trees that grow in the [[Great Lakes]] region of Canada and the United States yield the greatest supply, along with some varieties in the [[Rocky Mountains]]. It is not uncommon in Huon Pine, which grows only in Tasmania. Although there are a few clues in a tree's bark that indicate the lumber might have bird's eye figure, it is usually necessary to fell the tree and cut it apart to know for sure.

== Characteristics ==
In most characteristics, wood with bird's eye figure is no different from the rest of the wood from the same tree. Depending on the frequency of the birdseye swirls, each ⅛" to ⅜" wide (0.3–1&amp;nbsp;cm), the wood may be extremely valuable. While woodworkers prize the timber primarily for its use in [[Wood veneer|veneer]]s, it also turns well on a [[lathe]], allowing it to be shaped into decorative canes, chair legs, and handles.

== Uses ==
Bird's eye maple may be expensive, up to several times the cost of ordinary hardwood. It is used in refined specialty products, such as in automobile trim, both in solid form and veneer, boxes and bowls for jewelry, thin veneer, humidors, canes, furniture inlays, handles, guitars, bowed instruments and pool cues are popular uses. Items made with this wood tend to be more expensive not only because the wood is more costly but because it is harder to work.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}  When working with bird's eye wood, it is advisable to take care in what tools are used, so as to prevent grain tearout. Also the more "eyes" there are in lumber, the weaker  the wood tends to be.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17784">'''Discrete logarithm records''' are the best results achieved to date in solving the [[discrete logarithm]] problem, which is the problem of finding solutions ''x'' to the equation ''g''&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''h'' given elements ''g'' and ''h'' of a finite [[cyclic group]]&amp;nbsp;''G''.  The difficulty of this problem is the basis for the security of several [[cryptographic]] systems, including [[Diffie–Hellman]] key agreement, [[ElGamal encryption]], the [[ElGamal signature scheme]], the [[Digital Signature Algorithm]], and the [[elliptic curve cryptography]] analogs of these.  Common choices for ''G'' used in these algorithms include the multiplicative group of integers modulo&amp;nbsp;''p'', the multiplicative group of a [[finite field]], and the group of points on an [[elliptic curve]] over a [[finite field]].

==Integers modulo ''p''==

On 16 June 2016, Thorsten Kleinjung, Claus Diem, [[Arjen K. Lenstra]], Christine Priplata, and Colin Stahlke announced the computation of a discrete logarithm modulo a 232-digit (768-bit) [[safe prime]], using the number field sieve.  The computation was started in February 2015 and took approximately 6600 core years scaled to an Intel Xeon E5-2660 at 2.2&amp;nbsp;GHz.&lt;ref&gt;Thorsten Kleinjung, [https://listserv.nodak.edu/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=NMBRTHRY;a0c66b63.1606 “Discrete logarithms in GF(''p'') – 768 bits,”] June 16, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Previous records for integers modulo ''p'' include:

* On 18 June 2005, [[Antoine Joux]] and Reynald Lercier announced the computation of a discrete logarithm modulo a 130-digit (431-bit) [[strong prime]] in  three weeks, using a 1.15&amp;nbsp;GHz 16-processor HP [[AlphaServer GS1280]] computer and a [[number field sieve]] algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;Antoine Joux, [http://listserv.nodak.edu/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=ind0506&amp;L=nmbrthry&amp;T=0&amp;P=20 “Discrete logarithms in GF(''p'') – 130 digits,”] June 18, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 5 February 2007 this was superseded by the announcement by Thorsten Kleinjung of the computation of a discrete logarithm modulo a 160-digit (530-bit) [[safe prime]], again using the number field sieve.  Most of the computation was done using idle time on various PCs and on a parallel computing cluster.&lt;ref&gt;Thorsten Kleinjung, [http://listserv.nodak.edu/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=ind0702&amp;L=NMBRTHRY&amp;P=R45&amp;D=0&amp;I=-3&amp;T=0 “Discrete logarithms in GF(''p'') – 160 digits,”] February 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 11 June 2014, Cyril Bouvier, Pierrick Gaudry, Laurent Imbert, Hamza Jeljeli and Emmanuel Thomé announced the computation of a discrete logarithm modulo a 180 digit (596-bit) safe prime using the number field sieve algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;Cyril Bouvier, Pierrick Gaudry, Laurent Imbert, Hamza Jeljeli and Emmanuel
Thomé, [https://listserv.nodak.edu/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=ind1406&amp;L=NMBRTHRY&amp;F=&amp;S=&amp;P=3161 "Discrete logarithms in GF(''p'') – 180 digits"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Finite fields==

The current record ({{As of|2014|1|alt=as of January 2014}}) in a finite field of characteristic 2 was announced by Robert Granger, Thorsten Kleinjung, and Jens Zumbrägel on 31 January 2014.  This team was able to compute discrete logarithms in GF(2&lt;sup&gt;9234&lt;/sup&gt;) using about 400,000 core hours.  New features of this computation include a modified method for obtaining the logarithms of degree two elements and a systematically optimized descent strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Jens Zumbrägel, "Discrete Logarithms in GF(2^9234)", 31 January 2014, https://listserv.nodak.edu/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=NMBRTHRY;9aa2b043.1401.&lt;/ref&gt;

Previous records in a finite field of characteristic 2 were announced by:

* Antoine Joux on 21 May 2013.  His team was able to compute discrete logarithms in the field with 2&lt;sup&gt;6168&lt;/sup&gt; = (2&lt;sup&gt;257&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; elements using less than 550 CPU-hours. This computation was performed using the same index calculus algorithm as in the recent computation in the field with 2&lt;sup&gt;4080&lt;/sup&gt; elements.&lt;ref&gt;Antoine Joux, "Discrete logarithms in GF(2&lt;sup&gt;6168&lt;/sup&gt;) [=GF((2&lt;sup&gt;257&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;)]", May 21, 2013, https://listserv.nodak.edu/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=ind1305&amp;L=NMBRTHRY&amp;F=&amp;S=&amp;P=3034.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Robert Granger, Faruk Göloğlu, Gary McGuire, and Jens Zumbrägel on 11 Apr 2013.  The new computation concerned the field with 2&lt;sup&gt;6120&lt;/sup&gt; elements and took 749.5 core-hours.
* Antoine Joux on Mar 22nd, 2013. This used the same algorithm &lt;ref&gt;Antoine Joux. A new index calculus algorithm with complexity $L(1/4+o(1))$ in very small characteristic, 2013, http://eprint.iacr.org/2013/095&lt;/ref&gt; for small characteristic fields as the previous computation in the field with 2&lt;sup&gt;1778&lt;/sup&gt; elements. The new computation concerned the field with 2&lt;sup&gt;4080&lt;/sup&gt; elements, represented as a degree 255 extension of the field with 2&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; elements. The computation took less than 14100 core hours.&lt;ref&gt;Antoine Joux, "Discrete logarithms in GF(2&lt;sup&gt;4080&lt;/sup&gt;)", Mar 22, 2013, https://listserv.nodak.edu/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=ind1303&amp;L=NMBRTHRY&amp;F=&amp;S=&amp;P=13682.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Robert Granger, Faruk Göloğlu, Gary McGuire, and Jens Zumbrägel on 19 Feb 2013.  They used a new variant of the medium-sized base field [[function field sieve]], for binary fields, to compute a discrete logarithm in a field of 2&lt;sup&gt;1971&lt;/sup&gt; elements.  In order to use a medium-sized base field, they represented the field as a degree 73 extension of the field of 2&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt; elements.  The computation took 3132 core hours on an SGI Altix ICE 8200EX cluster using Intel (Westmere) Xeon E5650 hex-core processors.&lt;ref&gt;Faruk Gologlu et al.,  On the Function Field Sieve and the Impact of Higher Splitting Probabilities: Application to Discrete Logarithms in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_{2^{1971}}&lt;/math&gt;, 2013, http://eprint.iacr.org/2013/074.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Antoine Joux on 11 Feb 2013. This used a new algorithm for small characteristic fields. The computation concerned a field of 2&lt;sup&gt;1778&lt;/sup&gt; elements, represented as a degree 127 extension of the field with 2&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; elements. The computation took less than 220 core hours.&lt;ref&gt;Antoine Joux, "Discrete logarithms in GF(2&lt;sup&gt;1778&lt;/sup&gt;)", Feb. 11, 2013, https://listserv.nodak.edu/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=ind1302&amp;L=NMBRTHRY&amp;F=&amp;S=&amp;P=2317.&lt;/ref&gt;

The current record ({{As of|2014|alt=as of 2014}}) in a finite field of characteristic 2 of prime degree was announced by Thorsten Kleinjung on 17 October 2014. The calculation was done in a field of 2&lt;sup&gt;1279&lt;/sup&gt; elements and followed essentially the path sketched for &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_{2^{4 \cdot 1223}}&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;ref&gt;Granger, Robert, Thorsten Kleinjung, and Jens Zumbrägel. “Breaking `128-Bit Secure’ Supersingular Binary Curves (or How to Solve Discrete Logarithms in &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb F}_{2^{4 \cdot 1223}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb F}_{2^{12 \cdot 367}}&lt;/math&gt;).” arXiv:1402.3668 [cs, Math], February 15, 2014. https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.3668.&lt;/ref&gt; with two main exceptions in the linear algebra computation and the descent phase.  The total running time was less than four core years.&lt;ref&gt;Thorsten Kleinjung, 2014 October 17, "Discrete Logarithms in GF(2^1279)", https://listserv.nodak.edu/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=NMBRTHRY;256db68e.1410.&lt;/ref&gt;  The previous record in a finite field of characteristic 2 of prime degree was announced by the CARAMEL group on April 6, 2013.  They used the [[function field sieve]] to compute a discrete logarithm in a field of 2&lt;sup&gt;809&lt;/sup&gt; elements.&lt;ref&gt;The CARAMEL group:  Razvan Barbulescu and Cyril Bouvier and Jérémie Detrey and Pierrick Gaudry and Hamza Jeljeli and Emmanuel Thomé and Marion Videau and Paul Zimmermann, “Discrete logarithm in GF(2&lt;sup&gt;809&lt;/sup&gt;) with FFS”, April 6, 2013, http://eprint.iacr.org/2013/197.&lt;/ref&gt;

The current record ({{As of|2016|7|alt=as of July 2016}})  for a field of characteristic 3 was announced by 
Gora Adj, Isaac Canales-Martinez, Nareli Cruz-Cortés, Alfred Menezes, Thomaz Oliveira, Francisco Rodriguez-Henriquez, and Luis Rivera-Zamarripa on {{date|18 July 2016}}.  The calculation was done in the 4841-bit finite field with 3&lt;sup&gt;6&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;509&lt;/sup&gt; elements and was performed on several computers at [[CINVESTAV]] and
the [[University of Waterloo]]. In total, about 200 core years of computing time was expended on the computation.
&lt;ref&gt;Francisco Rodriguez-Henriquez, 18 July 2016, "Discrete Logarithms in GF(3^{6*509})", https://listserv.nodak.edu/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=NMBRTHRY;65bedfc8.1607.&lt;/ref&gt;

Previous records in a finite field of characteristic 3 were announced:

* in the full version of the Asiacrypt 2014 paper of Joux and Pierrot (December 2014).&lt;ref&gt;http://www-polsys.lip6.fr/~pierrot/papers/Simplified%20Frob%20Rep.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The DLP is solved in the field GF(3&lt;sup&gt;5&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;479&lt;/sup&gt;), which is a 3796-bit field. This work did not exploit any "special" aspects of the field such as Kummer or twisted-Kummer properties. The total computation took less than 8600 CPU-hours.
* by Gora Adj, Alfred Menezes, Thomaz Oliveira, and Francisco Rodríguez-Henríquez on 26 February 2014, updating a previous announcement on 27 January 2014.  The computation solve DLP in the 1551-bit field GF(3&lt;sup&gt;6&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;163&lt;/sup&gt;), taking 1201 CPU hours.&lt;ref&gt;Francisco Rodríguez-Henríquez, “Announcement,” 27 January 2014, https://listserv.nodak.edu/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=NMBRTHRY;763a9e76.1401.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gora Adj and Alfred Menezes and Thomaz Oliveira and Francisco Rodríguez-Henríquez, "Computing Discrete Logarithms in F_{3^{6*137}} and F_{3^{6*163}} using Magma", 26 Feb 2014, http://eprint.iacr.org/2014/057.&lt;/ref&gt;
* in 2012 by a joint Fujitsu, NICT, and Kyushu University team, that computed a discrete logarithm in the field of 3&lt;sup&gt;6&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;97&lt;/sup&gt; elements and a size of 923 bits,&lt;ref&gt;Kyushu University, NICT and Fujitsu Laboratories Achieve World Record Cryptanalysis of Next-Generation Cryptography, 2012, http://www.nict.go.jp/en/press/2012/06/PDF-att/20120618en.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; using a variation on the [[function field sieve]] and beating the previous record in a field of 3&lt;sup&gt;6&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;71&lt;/sup&gt; elements and size of 676 bits by a wide margin.&lt;ref&gt;Takuya Hayashi et al., Solving a 676-bit Discrete Logarithm Problem in GF(3&lt;sup&gt;6''n''&lt;/sup&gt;), 2010, http://eprint.iacr.org/2010/090.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over fields of "moderate"-sized characteristic, notable computations as of 2005 included those a field of 65537&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt; elements (401 bits) announced on 24 Oct 2005, and in a field of 370801&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt; elements (556 bits) announced on 9 Nov 2005.&lt;ref&gt;A. Durand, “New records in computations over large numbers,” The Security Newsletter, January 2005, http://eric-diehl.com/letter/Newsletter1_Final.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; The current record (as of 2013) for a finite field of "moderate" characteristic was announced on 6 January 2013.  The team used a new variation of the [[function field sieve]] for the medium prime case to compute a discrete logarithm in a field of 33341353&lt;sup&gt;57&lt;/sup&gt; elements (a 1425-bit finite field).&lt;ref&gt;Antoine Joux, “Discrete Logarithms in a 1425-bit Finite Field,” January 6, 2013, https://listserv.nodak.edu/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=ind1301&amp;L=NMBRTHRY&amp;F=&amp;S=&amp;P=2214.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Joux-ePrint"&gt;Faster index calculus for the medium prime case. Application to 1175-bit and 1425-bit finite fields,   Eprint Archive, http://eprint.iacr.org/2012/720&lt;/ref&gt;  The same technique had been used a few weeks earlier to compute a discrete logarithm in a field of 33553771&lt;sup&gt;47&lt;/sup&gt; elements (an 1175-bit finite field).&lt;ref  name="Joux-ePrint"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Antoine Joux, “Discrete Logarithms in a 1175-bit Finite Field,” December 24, 2012, https://listserv.nodak.edu/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=ind1212&amp;L=NMBRTHRY&amp;F=&amp;S=&amp;P=13902.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 June 2014, Razvan Barbulescu, Pierrick Gaudry, Aurore Guillevic, and François Morain announced a new computation of a discrete logarithm in a finite field whose order has 160 digits and is a degree 2 extension of a prime field.&lt;ref&gt;Razvan Barbulescu, “Discrete logarithms in GF(p^2) --- 160 digits,” June 24, 2014, https://listserv.nodak.edu/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=NMBRTHRY;2ddabd4c.1406.&lt;/ref&gt;  The algorithm used was the number field sieve (NFS), with various modifications. The total computing time was equivalent to 68 days on one core of CPU (sieving) and 30 hours on a GPU (linear algebra).

==Elliptic curves==

[[Certicom]] Corp. has issued a series of Elliptic Curve Cryptography challenges.  Level I involves fields of 109-bit and 131-bit sizes.  Level II includes 163, 191, 239, 359-bit sizes. All Level II challenges are currently believed to be computationally infeasible.&lt;ref&gt;Certicom Corp., “The Certicom ECC Challenge,” http://www.certicom.com/index.php/the-certicom-ecc-challenge.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Level I challenges which have been met are:&lt;ref&gt;Certicom Research, Certicom ECC Challenge (Certicom Research, November 10, 2009), {{cite web |url=http://www.certicom.com/images/pdfs/challenge-2009.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151022135946/https://www.certicom.com/images/pdfs/challenge-2009.pdf |archivedate=2015-10-22 |df= }} .&lt;/ref&gt;

* ECC2K-108, involving taking a discrete logarithm on a [[Koblitz curve]] over a field of 2&lt;sup&gt;108&lt;/sup&gt; elements.  The prize was awarded on 4 April 2000 to a group of about 1300 people represented by Robert Harley.  They used a parallelized [[Pollard's rho algorithm for logarithms|Pollard rho method]] with speedup.
* ECC2-109, involving taking a discrete logarithm on a curve over a field of 2&lt;sup&gt;109&lt;/sup&gt; elements.  The prize was awarded on 8 April 2004 to a group of about 2600 people represented by Chris Monico.  They also used a version of a parallelized [[Pollard's rho algorithm for logarithms|Pollard rho method]], taking 17 months of calendar time.
* ECCp-109, involving taking a discrete logarithm on a curve modulo a 109-bit prime.  The prize was awarded on 15 Apr 2002 to a group of about 10308 people represented by Chris Monico.  Once again, they used a version of a parallelized [[Pollard's rho algorithm for logarithms|Pollard rho method]], taking 549 days of calendar time.

None of the 131-bit (or larger) challenges have been met {{As of|2016|alt=as of 2016}}.

In July 2009, Joppe W. Bos, Marcelo E. Kaihara, Thorsten Kleinjung, Arjen K. Lenstra and [[Peter Montgomery (mathematician)|Peter L. Montgomery]] announced that they had carried out a discrete logarithm computation on an elliptic curve modulo a 112-bit prime.  The computation was done on a cluster of over 200 [[PlayStation 3]] game consoles over about 6 months.  They used the common parallelized version of [[Pollard's rho algorithm for logarithms|Pollard rho method]].&lt;ref&gt;Joppe W. Bos and Marcelo E. Kaihara, “PlayStation 3 computing breaks 2^60 barrier:  112-bit prime ECDLP solved,” EPFL Laboratory for cryptologic algorithms - LACAL, http://lacal.epfl.ch/112bit_prime&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014, [[Erich Wenger]] and [[Paul Wolfger]] from [[Graz University of Technology]] solved the discrete logarithm of a 113-bit Koblitz curve in extrapolated 24 days using an 18-core [[Virtex-6]] [[Field-programmable gate array|FPGA]] cluster.&lt;ref&gt;Erich Wenger and Paul Wolfger, “Solving the Discrete Logarithm of a 113-bit Koblitz Curve with an FPGA Cluster” http://eprint.iacr.org/2014/368&lt;/ref&gt;  In January 2015,the same researchers solved the discrete logarithm of an elliptic curve defined over a 113-bit binary field. The average runtime is around 82 days using a 10-core [[Kintex-7]] [[Field-programmable gate array|FPGA]] cluster.&lt;ref&gt;Erich Wenger and Paul Wolfger, “Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger - Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Computations on FPGAs” http://eprint.iacr.org/2015/143/&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 December 2016,  [[Daniel J. Bernstein]], [[Susanne Engels]], [[Tanja Lange]], [[Ruben Niederhagen]], [[Christof Paar]], [[Peter Schwabe]], and [[Ralf Zimmermann]] announced the solution of a generic 117.35-bit elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem on a binary curve, using an optimized FPGA implementation of a parallel version of [[Pollard's rho algorithm for logarithms|Pollard's rho algorithm]].  The attack ran for about six months on 64 to 576 FPGAs in parallel.&lt;ref&gt;Ruben Niederhagen, “117.35-Bit ECDLP on Binary Curve,” https://listserv.nodak.edu/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=NMBRTHRY;628a3b51.1612 {{dead link|date=August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, fuel production increased at more than 10% annually. [[Coal]] output grew from 5.2&amp;nbsp;million tons in 1975 to 6&amp;nbsp;million tons in 1978 and fell to 5.3 &amp;nbsp;million tons in 1980. According to official figures, 1985 coal production remained at, or somewhat below, the 1981 level of 6&amp;nbsp;million tons. Coal accounted for about two-thirds of energy consumption in the 1980s. [[Coal mining]] remained hampered by coordination and management problems at mining sites, incomplete rail connections to mines, equipment and materials shortages, and inadequate food and consumer goods for miners.&lt;ref name=cs&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/vntoc.html Vietnam country study]. [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (December 1987). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Electric power]] production, although handicapped by uncompleted projects and shortages of oil and spare parts, grew at an average of 8% per year in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Vietnamese statistics on the annual output of primary products showed that production of electricity increased by almost 60% to nearly 3.8&amp;nbsp;[[TWh]] from 1976 through 1978, then declined to around 3.7&amp;nbsp;TWh in 1980. By 1985, however, production of electricity had increased to 5.4&amp;nbsp;TWh. Energy-producing industries generally remained stagnant, however, which caused tremendous difficulties for the other sectors of the economy. Power output grew very slowly, and power shortages forced many factories to operate at only 45 to 50% of their capacity. The government planned that in the 1980s energy production would be tripled by the completion of three big Soviet-assisted projects: the 500-megawatt [[thermal plant]] at [[Pha Lai II Power Station|Pha Lai]] (now in [[Hải Dương Province]]); the 300-megawatt [[hydroelectric plant]] at [[Trị An Hydroelectric Power Station|Trị An]], [[Đồng Nai Province]], and the giant, 1,900-megawatt hydroelectric plant at [[Hòa Bình Dam|Hòa Bình]], [[Hòa Bình Province]], which has been called the "Asian Aswan Dam."

==Current status==
[[File:Oil Balance Vietnam.svg|thumb|Vietnam is now a net oil importer]]
[[Petroleum]] is the main source of commercial energy, followed by [[coal]], which contributes about 25 percent of the country’s energy (excluding biomass). Vietnam’s oil reserves are presently estimated at 600 million tonnes.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.worldenergy.org/data/resources/country/vietnam/oil/&lt;/ref&gt; Oil production rose rapidly to {{convert|403300|oilbbl/d|m3/d}} in 2004, but output is believed to have peaked and is expected to decline gradually. Vietnam’s anthracite coal reserves are estimated at 3.7 billion tons. Coal production was almost 19 million tons in 2003, compared with 9.6 million tons in 1999. Vietnam’s potential natural gas reserves are 1.3 trillion cubic meters. In 2002 Vietnam brought ashore 2.26 billion cubic meters of natural gas. [[Hydroelectric power]] is another source of energy. In 2004 Vietnam began to build a [[nuclear power plant]] with Russian assistance.&lt;ref name=cp&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Vietnam.pdf Vietnam country profile]. [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (December 2005). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Crude oil]] was Vietnam’s leading export until the late 2000s, when high-tech electrical manufactures emerged to become the biggest export market (by 2014, crude oil comprised only 5% of Vietnamese exports, compared to 20% of all exports in 1996).&lt;ref&gt;http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/explore/tree_map/export/vnm/all/show/1996/?prod_class=hs4&amp;details_treemap=2&amp;disable_widgets=false&amp;disable_search=false&amp;node_size=none&amp;queryActivated=true&amp;highlight=&amp;yaxis=complexity&lt;/ref&gt; This is because Vietnamese crude oil is estimated to have peaked in 2004, when crude oil represented 22 percent of all export earnings. Petroleum exports are in the form of crude petroleum because Vietnam has a very limited refining capacity. Vietnam’s only operational refinery, a facility at Cát Lái near [[Ho Chi Minh City]], has a capacity of only {{convert|800000|oilbbl/d|m3/d}}. Several consortia have abandoned commitments to finance a {{convert|130|Moilbbl/d|m3/d|sing=on}} facility at Dung Quat in central Vietnam. Refined petroleum accounted for 10.2 percent of total imports in 2002.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3150">'''Energy independence''' is [[wikt:independence|independence]] or [[autarky]] regarding [[energy resource]]s, [[energy supply]] and/or [[energy generation]] by the [[energy industry]].

'''Energy dependence''' in general refers to either mankind's general dependence on [[primary energy|primary]] or [[secondary energy]] for [[World energy consumption|energy consumption]] ([[fuel]], [[transport]], [[automation]], etc.). In a narrower sense, it may describe the dependence of one country on [[energy resource]]s from another country.
{{quote|Energy dependency shows the extent to which an [[economy]] relies upon [[imports]] in order to meet its energy needs. The indicator is calculated as net imports divided by the sum of gross inland energy consumption plus [[oil storage|bunker]]s.|[[Eurostat]]&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tsdcc310&amp;plugin=1&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Generally, a higher level of dependence is associated with a higher energy security risk, because of the possible interference of [[trade regulation]]s, international [[armed conflict]]s, etc..

A crucial contribution on the road to energy independence is [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] because efficient use of energy can build on individual efforts in [[power saving]] instead of having to rely on costly large-scale infrastructure.

Usually, a country will rely on local and global energy renewable and non-renewable resources, a mixed-model solution that presumes various energy sources and modes of [[energy transfer]] between countries like [[electric power transmission]], oil transport ([[oil pipeline|oil]] and [[gas pipeline]]s and [[Oil tanker|tankers]]), etc. 
The [[Russia in the European energy sector|European dependence on Russian energy]] is a case in point.

Planning and coordination in the strive for energy independence is the business of [[energy policy]] and [[energy management]].

Energy dependence is also used as a subindicator for Energy Globalisation Index.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Overland|first=Indra|date=2016-04-01|title=Energy: The missing link in globalization|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/296486356|journal="Energy Research &amp; Social Science"|volume=14|doi=10.1016/j.erss.2016.01.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ediacaran GSSP - closeup.JPG|thumb|The 'golden spike' marking the Ediacaran GSSP]]
A '''Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point''', abbreviated '''GSSP''', is an internationally agreed upon reference point on a [[stratigraphy|stratigraphic]] section which defines the lower boundary of a [[stage (stratigraphy)|stage]] on the [[geologic time scale]].  The effort to define GSSPs is conducted by the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy]], a part of the [[International Union of Geological Sciences]].  Most, but not all, GSSPs are based on [[paleontology|paleontological]] changes.  Hence GSSPs are usually described in terms of transitions between different [[faunal stage]]s, though far more faunal stages have been described than GSSPs.  The GSSP definition effort commenced in 1977.  As of 2012, 64 of the 101 stages that need a GSSP have been formally defined.&lt;ref name="International Chronostratigraphic Chart 2012"&gt;{{cite web|title=International Chronostratigraphic Chart 2012|url=http://stratigraphy.org/column.php?id=Chart/Time%20Scale|publisher=ICS|accessdate=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules==
A geologic section has to fulfill a set of criteria to be adapted as a GSSP by the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy|ICS]]. The following list summarizes the criteria:&lt;ref name="Remane 1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Remane|first=J.|author2=M. G. Bassett |author3=J. W. Cowie |author4=K.H. Gohrbandt |author5=H.R. Lane |author6=O. Michelsen |author7=Wang Naiwen |title=Guidelines for the establishment of global chronostratigraphic standards by the International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS)|journal=Episodes|date=1996|volume=19|pages=77–81|url=http://work.geobiology.cn/ebook/%E8%8B%B1%E6%96%87%E6%9C%9F%E5%88%8A/Permophiles%20NO.29/19%20Guidelines%20for%20the%20establishment%20of%20global%20chronostratigraphic%20standards%20by%20the%20International%20Commission%20on%20Stratigraphy%20(ICS)%20(Revised).pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GSSP Rules"&gt;{{cite web|title=GSSP Rules|url=https://engineering.purdue.edu/Stratigraphy/gssp/gssp_r.html|publisher=Geologic Timescale Foundation|accessdate=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A GSSP has to define the lower boundary of a geologic [[Stage (stratigraphy)|stage]].
* The lower boundary has to be defined using a primary marker (usually [[first appearance datum]] of a fossil species).
** There should also be secondary markers (other fossils, [[Chemostratigraphy|chemical]], [[geomagnetic reversal]]).
** The horizon in which the marker appears should have minerals that can be [[Radiometric dating|radiometrically dated]].
** The marker has to have regional and global correlation in outcrops of the same age
** The marker should be independent of [[facies]].
* The outcrop has to have an adequate thickness
* Sedimentation has to be continuous without any changes in facies
* The outcrop should be unaffected by tectonic and sedimentary movements, and metamorphism
* The outcrop has to be accessible to research and free to access.
** This includes that the outcrop has to be located where it can be visited quickly (International airport and good roads), has to be kept in good condition (Ideally a national reserve), in accessible terrain, extensive enough to allow repeated sampling and open to researchers of all nationalities.

The [[Precambrian]]-[[Cambrian]] boundary GSSP at [[Fortune Head]], [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] is a typical GSSP.  It is accessible by paved road and is set aside as a [[nature preserve]].  A continuous section is available from beds that are clearly Precambrian into beds that are clearly Cambrian.  The boundary is set at the first appearance of a complex trace fossil ''[[Treptichnus pedum]]'' that is found worldwide.  The Fortune Head GSSP is unlikely to be washed away or built over. Nonetheless, ''Treptichnus pedum'' is less than ideal as a marker fossil as it is not found in every Cambrian sequence, and it is not assured that it is found at the same level in every exposure. In fact, further eroding its value as a boundary marker, it has since been identified in strata 4m ''below'' the GSSP!&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author =    | first = J.| first2 = S.

However, no other fossil is known that would be preferable.  There is no [[radiometric dating|radiometrically datable]] bed at the boundary at Fortune Head, but there is one slightly above the boundary in similar beds nearby.
These factors have led some geologists{{who|date=March 2016}} to suggest that this GSSP is in need of reassigning.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Once a GSSP boundary has been agreed upon, a "golden spike" is driven into the geologic section to mark the precise boundary for future geologists (though in practice the "spike" need neither be golden nor an actual spike).  The first stratigraphic boundary was defined in 1977 by identifying the [[Silurian]]-[[Devonian]] boundary with a bronze plaque at a locality called [[Klonk]], northeast of the village of Suchomasty in the [[Czech Republic]].  GSSPs are also sometimes referred to as '''Golden Spikes'''.

==Global Standard Stratigraphic Ages==
{{main article|Global Standard Stratigraphic Age}}
Because defining a GSSP depends on finding well-preserved geologic sections and identifying key events, this task becomes more difficult as one goes farther back in time.  Before 630 million years ago, boundaries on the geologic timescale are defined simply by reference to fixed dates, known as "Global Standard Stratigraphic Ages".

The '''Great Rift Valley''' is part of an intra-continental ridge system that runs through [[Kenya]] from north to south.  It is part of the [[Gregory Rift]], the eastern branch of the [[East African Rift]], which starts in [[Tanzania]] to the south and continues northward into [[Ethiopia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chorowicz|first=Jean|title=The East African Rift System|journal=Journal of African Earth Sciences|date=10 November 2005|volume=43|issue=1-3|pages=379–410|doi=10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2005.07.019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was formed on the "Kenyan Dome" a geographical upwelling created by the interactions of three major tectonics: the Arabian, Nubian, and Somalian plates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Corti|first=Giacomo|title=Evolution and characteristics of continental rifting: Analog modeling-inspired view and comparison with examples from the East African Rift System|journal=Tectonophysics|date=February 2012|volume=522|pages=1–33|doi=10.1016/j.tecto.2011.06.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, it was seen as part of a "[[Great Rift Valley, geographical concept|Great Rift Valley]]" that ran from [[Madagascar]] to [[Syria]]. Most of the valley falls within the former [[Rift Valley Province]].

The valley contains the [[Cherangani Hills]] and a chain of volcanoes, some of which are still active.
The climate is mild, with temperatures usually below {{convert|28|C|F}}.
Most rain falls during the March–June and October–November periods.{{sfn|Firestone|2009|p=151}}
The Tugen Hills to the west of Lake Baringo contain fossils preserved in lava flows from the period 14 to 4 million years ago. The relics of many hominids, ancestors of humans, were found here.{{sfn|Firestone|2009|p=23}}

== Features ==
[[File:Kenya Rift Valley volcanoes and lakes.svg|thumb|Main volcanoes and lakes in the rift valley]]

The valley is bordered by escarpments to the east and west. The floor is broken by volcanoes, some still active, and contains a series of lakes. Some of the soils are [[Andisols]], fertile soils from relatively recent volcanic activity.

Lake Turkana occupies the northern end of the Great Rift Valley in Kenya. There are also volcanoes in Lake Turkana. The [[Suguta Valley]], or Suguta Mud Flats, is an arid part of the Great Rift Valley directly south of [[Lake Turkana]]. The [[shield volcano]] [[Emuruangogolak]] straddles the valley to the south of Suguta, and further south [[Mount Silali]] and [[Paka (volcano)|Paka]] rise from the valley floor. Paka is a shield volcano, with widespread geothermal activity. South of Paka are [[Mount Korosi]], [[Lake Baringo]] and [[Lake Bogoria]]. [[Menengai]] is a massive shield volcano in the floor of the rift with a caldera that formed about 8,000 years ago.{{sfn|Menengai}} It overlooks [[Lake Nakuru]] to the south.
This region also includes [[Lake Elementaita]], [[Mount Kipipiri]] and [[Lake Naivasha]].

The [[Hell's Gate National Park]] lies south of [[Lake Naivasha]]. In the early 1900s, [[Mount Longonot]] erupted, and ash can still be felt around Hell's Gate.{{sfn|Hell's Gate}} Mount Longonot is a dormant stratovolcano located southeast of [[Lake Naivasha]]. [[Suswa]] is a shield volcano located between [[Narok]] and [[Nairobi]]. Lava flows from the most recent eruptions are still not covered by vegetation, and may be no more than one hundred years old.{{sfn|Suswa}} [[Lake Magadi]] is the most southern rift valley lake in Kenya, although the northern end of [[Lake Natron]] in Tanzania reaches into Kenya.

The [[Elgeyo escarpment]] forms part of the western wall. The [[Kerio Valley]] lies between the [[Tugen Hills]] and the Elgeyo escarpment at an elevation of {{convert|1000|m|ft}}
There are large deposits of [[Fluorite]] in the [[Kerio Valley]] area.
Further south the [[Mau Escarpment]] is a steep natural cliff approximately 3,000&amp;nbsp;m (10,000&amp;nbsp;ft) high, running along the western edge of the Great Rift Valley about [[Lake Naivasha]].
Yet further south the [[Nguruman Escarpment]] is around 50 kilometers long and elongated in N-W direction. Its northern edge is about {{convert|120|km|mi}} southwest of Nairobi, while the southern edge is near the Tanzanian border, at the northwestern corner of [[Lake Natron]].
The [[Aberdare Range]] forms a section of the eastern rim of the Great Rift Valley to the north of Nairobi. [[Mount Satima]] lies at the northern end of the Aberdares and is their highest point, and [[Mount Kinangop]] at the southern end is the second highest. The mountains form a ridge between these two peaks. [[Ngong Hills]] are peaks in a ridge along the east of the Great Rift Valley, located southwest near Nairobi.

Kenya is home to 64 (9.50%) of the total lakes found within the continent of Africa.{{sfn|Singh|2006|p=2}} Eight of these make up the main lakes in the Kenyan Rift Valley.  From north to south, the names of these lakes are [[Lake Turkana]], [[Lake Logipi]], [[Lake Baringo]], [[Lake Bogoria]], [[Lake Nakuru]], [[Lake Elmenteita]], [[Lake Naivasha]], and [[Lake Magadi]]{{sfn|Firestone|2009|p=151}} Of those eight, only Lakes Baringo and Naivasha are fresh water.{{sfn|Britton|Harper|2006|p=334}}
[[File:East African Rift Valley, Kenya ISS 2012.jpg|thumb|East African Rift Valley, Kenya ISS 2012]]
Lake Turkana, at the northern end of the rift, is {{convert|250|km|mi}} long, between {{convert|15|km|mi}} and {{convert|30|km|mi}} wide and is {{convert|125|m|ft}} at its greatest depth.{{sfn|Anadón|Cabrera|Kelts|1991|p=6}}
Most of the other lakes are shallow and poorly drained, and therefore have become alkaline. They have waters that are rich in blue-green algae, which feed insect larvae, small crustaceans and [[lesser flamingo]]s. The larvae and crustaceans are food for fish and [[greater flamingo]]s.{{sfn|Firestone|2009|p=151}}
Massive flocks of these birds have been found to have an effect on the lakeside sediments also.  Their numbers cause trampling of the silts in certain areas, while the feeding grounds are oxygenated due to probing beaks in the mud.  Their nest mounds can also be preserved and cemented as the lake's water levels change.  These form irregularities in the lakeside topography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Scott|first=Jennifer J.|author2=Robin W. Renaut |author3=R.

[[Trona]], an evaporative mineral, used for sodium carbonate production, has been mined at [[Lake Magadi]] for nearly 100 years.  It produces about 250,000 metric tonnes per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Evaporites:Sediments, Resources and Hydrocarbons|last=Warren|first=John K.|year=2006|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|location=New York|isbn=3-540-26011-0|page=861|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ihny39BvVhIC&amp;pg=PA861&amp;lpg=PA861&amp;dq=trona+lake+magadi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EgoDxYnaLh&amp;sig=5n0W0HiP5H2djqEMQ-qy5qtdiBw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MbVMUvbZE8KbygGH9oCAAQ&amp;ved=0CGkQ6AEwDA#v=onepage&amp;q=trona%20lake%20magadi&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other precious minerals like rubies and pink sapphires have been found and mined from areas around Lake Baringo.  In 2004, over 2 kilograms of [[Corundum]] were collected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blauwet|first=Dudley|author2=B. M.

[[File:Flickr - Rainbirder - Born of Fire.jpg|thumb|[[Lake Bogoria]] is a caustic cauldron fringed by geysers and populated by over a million flamingos.]]
Three shallow alkaline lakes and the surrounding lands make up the Kenya Lake system: [[Lake Bogoria]] at {{convert|10700|ha|acre}},  [[Lake Nakuru]] at {{convert|18800|ha}} and [[Lake Elementaita]] at {{convert|2534|ha|acre}}. This system has one of the most diverse populations of birds in the world, and is the home of thirteen globally threatened species of bird. It is an important nesting and breeding site for [[great white pelican]]s, and is the most important feeding area for lesser flamingos in the world. The system is home to globally important populations of [[black-necked grebe]], [[African spoonbill]], [[pied avocet]], [[little grebe]], [[yellow-billed stork]], [[black-winged stilt]], [[grey-headed gull]] and [[gull-billed tern]].{{sfn|UNESCO}}

The Kenya Lake system is a key location on the [[West Asian-East African Flyway]], a route followed by huge numbers of birds in their annual migration from breeding grounds in the north to wintering places in Africa. The lands around the lakes include large populations of black rhino, Rothschild's giraffe, greater kudu, lion, cheetah and wild dogs.
The Kenya Lake system is surrounded by the steep escarpment of the Rift Valley, which provides a spectacular backdrop.{{sfn|UNESCO}}

Other lakes are [[Lake Chew Bahir]], in the northeast extension. This lake lies mainly in Ethiopia but extends into Kenya in the rainy season. [[Lake Kamnarok]] is another small lake.

'''Hirsholmene''' is a group of ten small [[List of islands of Denmark|Danish islands]] in the [[Kattegat]]; Hirsholm, Græsholm, Lilleholm, Tyvholm, Kølpen and Deget, located approximately 7&amp;nbsp;km to the northeast of [[Frederikshavn]]. Noted for their impressive bird populations, the islands have been a Danish nature reserve since 1938.[http://naturstyrelsen.dk/naturoplevelser/naturguider/hirsholmene/]

Only Hirsholm is inhabited, with a small settlement dating from the 16th century, and a lighthouse from 1886.

The island was the summer retreat for the noted Danish author [[Dines Skafte Jespersen]] who wrote the children's book series called ''Troldepus'' in addition to other works. He also wrote three autobiographical works, including one about his year living and working on the island, called ''Himmel, hav og en ø'' (Sky, Sea and an Island).

A '''Leyden jar''' (or '''Leiden jar''') stores a high-voltage [[electric charge]] (from an external source) between [[electrical conductor]]s on the inside and outside of a glass jar.  A Leyden jar typically consists of a glass jar with metal foil cemented to the inside and the outside surfaces, and a metal terminal projecting vertically through the jar lid to make contact with the inner foil. It was the original form of the [[capacitor]]&lt;ref name="Dummer"&gt;{{cite book| last1  = Dummer| first1 = G. W.

Its invention was a discovery made independently by German cleric [[Ewald Georg von Kleist]] on 11 October 1745 and by Dutch scientist [[Pieter van Musschenbroek]] of [[Leiden]] (Leyden) in 1745–1746.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Heilbron| first = J.L.| author-link=John L.

The Leyden jar was used to conduct many early experiments in electricity, and its discovery was of fundamental importance in the study of [[electrostatics]]. The Leyden jar was the first means of accumulating and preserving electric charge in large quantities that could be discharged at the experimenter's will, thus overcoming a significant limit to early research into electrical conduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Baigrie | first = B.  | year = 2007 | title = Electricity and Magnetism: A Historical Perspective | url =  | page =  29 | publisher = [[Greenwood Publishing Group|Greenwood Press]] | isbn = 978-0-313-33358-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leyden jars are still used in education to demonstrate the principles of electrostatics.

== History ==
[[Image:Cuneus discovering the Leyden jar.png|thumb|upright=1.8|Discovery of the Leyden jar in Musschenbroek's lab.  The static electricity produced by the rotating glass sphere [[electrostatic generator]] was conducted by the chain through the suspended bar to the water in the glass held by assistant Andreas Cunaeus. A large charge accumulated in the water and an opposite charge in Cunaeus' hand on the glass.  When he touched the wire dipping in the water, he received a powerful shock. ]]

The [[Ancient Greeks]] already knew that pieces of [[amber]] could attract lightweight particles after being rubbed. The amber becomes electrified by [[triboelectric effect]],{{efn|The prefix ''tribo-'' (Greek for ‘rub’) refers to ‘friction’}} mechanical separation of charge in a [[dielectric]]. The Greek word for amber is ἤλεκτρον ("ēlektron") and is the origin of the word "electricity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=electric|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/electric|website=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=12 May 2017|quote=Origin and Etymology of ''electric'': New Latin ''electricus'' 'produced from amber by friction, electric', from Medieval Latin, 'of amber', from Latin ''electrum'' 'amber, electrum', from Greek ''ēlektron''; akin to Greek ''ēlektōr'' 'beaming sun'. First Known Use: 1722}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1650, [[Otto von Guericke]] built a crude [[electrostatic generator]]: a [[sulfur|sulphur]] ball that rotated on a shaft. When Guericke held his hand against the ball and turned the shaft quickly, a static [[electric charge]] built up. This experiment inspired the development of several forms of "friction machines", that greatly helped in the study of electricity.

The Leyden jar was effectively discovered independently by two parties: German deacon [[Ewald Georg von Kleist]], who made the first discovery, and Dutch scientists [[Pieter van Musschenbroek]] and Andreas Cunaeus, who figured out how it worked only when held in the hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Gutenberg |bullet=none |no=5641 |name=Man or Matter |first=Ernst |last=Lehrs |accessdate=2017-05-12 |authorlink=Ernst Lehrs |origyear=1951 |publisher=Klostermann |year=1953 |edition=3rd  |ISBN= 3-465-00285-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its mundane and safe appearance, the Leyden jar is a high voltage device, and it is estimated that at a maximum the early Leyden jars could collect electrical energy from friction in a range from 20,000 to 60,000 volts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Anders |first1=A. |title=Tracking down the origin of arc plasma science I. Early pulsed and oscillating discharges |journal=IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science |date=2003 |volume=31 |issue=5 |page=1056 |doi=10.1109/tps.2003.815476|bibcode=2003ITPS...31.1052A |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc785933/ |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ball on the tip of the rod is a [[corona discharge|corona]] ball to prevent leakage of the energy into the air by point discharge.

===Von Kleist===
[[Ewald Georg von Kleist]] (aka JG von Kleist) discovered the immense storage capability of the Leyden jar while working under a theory that saw electricity as a fluid, and hoped a glass jar filled with alcohol would "capture" this fluid.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas S. Kuhn, ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'' (Chicago, Illinois: University of Chicago Press, 1996) page 17.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the deacon at the cathedral of Camin in Pomerania.

In October 1745 von Kleist tried to accumulate electricity in a small medicine bottle filled with alcohol with a nail inserted in the cork. He was following up on an experiment developed by [[Georg Matthias Bose]] where electricity had been sent through water to set alcoholic spirits alight. He attempted to charge the bottle from a large prime conductor (invented by Bose) suspended above his friction machine.

Kleist was convinced that a substantial electric charge could be collected and held within the glass which he knew would provide an obstacle to the escape of the 'fluid'. He received a significant shock from the device when he accidentally touched the nail through the cork while still cradling the bottle in his other hand. He communicated his results to at least five different electrical experimenters,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Heilbron| first = J.L.| author-link=John L. Heilbron | title = Electricity in the 17th and 18th Centuries: A Study of Early Modern Physics|publisher = [[University of California Press]]|year = 1979|page = 311|isbn= 978-0-520-03478-5|url= https://books.google.com/?id=UlTLRUn1sy8C&amp;pg=PA311}}&lt;/ref&gt; in several letters from November 1745 to March 1746, but did not receive any confirmation that they had repeated his results, until April 1746.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Silva|first1=C.S.|last2=Heering|first2=P. | title=Re-examining the early history of the Leiden jar: Stabilization and variation in transforming a phenomenon into a fact| journal=History of Science|volume=56|issue=3|pages=314–342| date=2018| doi=10.1177/0073275318768418|pmid=29683000}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daniel Gralath]] learned about Kleist's experiment from seeing the letter to Paul Swietlicki, written in November 1746. After Gralath's failed first attempt to reproduce the experiment in December 1746, he wrote to Kleist for more information (and was told that the experiment would work better if the tube half-filled with alcohol was used). Gralath (in collabration with {{ill |Gottfried Reyger|de}}) succeeded in getting the intended effect on 5 March 1746, holding a small glass medicine bottle with a nail inside in one hand, moving it close to an electrostatic generator, and then moving the other hand close to the nail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Silva|first1=C.S.|last2=Heering|first2=P. | title=Re-examining the early history of the Leiden jar: Stabilization and variation in transforming a phenomenon into a fact| journal=History of Science|volume=56|issue=3|pages=314–342| date=2018| doi=10.1177/0073275318768418 |pmid=29683000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kleist didn't understand the significance of his conducting hand holding the bottle—and both he and his correspondents were loath to hold the device when told that the shock could throw them across the room. It took some time before Kleist's student associates at Leyden worked out that the hand provided an essential element.{{cn|date=May 2018|reason=Kleist did not have student associates in Leiden}}

===Musschenbroek and Cunaeus===
{{refimprove section|date=July 2016}}
The Leyden jar's invention was long credited to [[Pieter van Musschenbroek]], the physics professor at [[University of Leiden]], who also ran a family foundry which cast brass cannonettes, and a small business (''De Oosterse Lamp'' – "The Eastern Lamp") which made scientific and medical instruments for the new university courses in physics and for scientific gentlemen keen to establish their own 'cabinets' of curiosities and instruments.

Like Kleist, Musschenbroek was also interested in and attempting to repeat Bose's experiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heilbron|first1=John L.|authorlink=John L. Heilbron |title=G. M. Bose: The prime mover in the invention of the Leyden jar?|journal=Isis|date=1966|volume=57|issue=2|pages=264–267|jstor=227966}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Andreas Cunaeus, a lawyer, came to learn about this experiment from visiting Musschenbroek's laboratory and Cunaeus attempted to duplicate the experiment at home with household items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |title=Electricity in the 17th and 18th centuries: a study of early Modern physics |last=Heilbron |authorlink=John L. Heilbron  |first=J.L. |year=1979 |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |isbn=978-0-520-03478-5 |pages=313 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UlTLRUn1sy8C&amp;pg=PA313}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using a glass of beer,{{cn|reason=water, not beer mentioned in Heilbron|date=April 2018}} Cunaeus was unable to make it work.{{cn|reason=Heilbron, p. 313 reports success|date=April 2018}}  Cunaeus was the first to discover that the experimental setup could deliver a severe shock when he held his jar in his hand while charging it rather than placing it on an insulated stand, not realising that was the standard practice, thus making himself part of the circuit.  He reported his procedure and experience to [[Jean-Nicolas-Sébastien Allamand|Allamand]], Musschenbroek's colleague.  Allamand  and Musschenbroek also received severe shocks.  Musschenbroek communicated the experiment in a letter from 20 January 1746 to [[René Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur]],  who was Musschenbroek's appointed correspondent at the Paris Academy. [[Jean-Antoine Nollet|Abbé Nollet]] read this report, confirmed the experiment, and then read Musschenbroek's letter in a public meeting of the Paris Academy in April 1746&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |title=Electricity in the 17th and 18th centuries: a study of early Modern physics |last=Heilbron |authorlink=John L. Heilbron  |first=J.L. |year=1979 |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |isbn=978-0-520-03478-5 |pages=313–314 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UlTLRUn1sy8C&amp;pg=PA313}}&lt;/ref&gt; (translating from Latin to French).&lt;ref&gt; Here is Nollet's own account of the event. [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k35444/f140 Observations sur quelques nouveaux phénomènes d'Électricité]" ''Mémoires de l' Académie Royale des Sciences De l'Année 1746'', Paris, 1751, pp. 1-3. The account from the Academy of Sciences only refers to the "Leyden experiment" (''l'expérience de Leyde''):  [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/87779#page/13/mode/1up Sur l'Électricité]" ''Histoire de l' Académie Royale des Sciences De l'Année 1746'', Paris, 1751, pp. 1-17.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Musschenbroek's outlet in France for the sale of his company's  'cabinet' devices was the Abbé Nollet (who started building and selling duplicate instruments in 1735&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Nollet, Jean-Antoine|edition=2nd | date=2000 | publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons |work=Concise dictionary of scientific biography |page=652| url=https://archive.org/stream/concisedictionar00#page/652/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;).  Nollet then gave the electrical storage device the name "Leyden jar" and promoted it as a special type of flask to his market of wealthy men with scientific curiosity.
The "Kleistian jar" was therefore promoted as the ''Leyden jar'', and as having been discovered by [[Pieter van Musschenbroek]] and his acquaintance Andreas Cunaeus.  Musschenbroek, however, never claimed that he had invented it, &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |title=Electricity in the 17th and 18th centuries: a study of early Modern physics |last=Heilbron |authorlink=John L.

===Further developments===
Within months after Musschenbroek's report about how to reliably create a Leyden jar, other electrical researchers were making and experimenting with their own Leyden jars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Priestley|first1=Joseph|title=The History and Present State of Electricity, with original experiments|date=1775|location=London|pages=108|edition=3rd|url=https://archive.org/stream/historyandprese00priegoog#page/n154/mode/2up/|accessdate=25 April 2018|publisher=London : Printed for C.

Cadell ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; One interest was to see if the total possible charge could be increased. [[Johann Heinrich Winckler]], whose first experience with a single Leyden jar was reported in a letter to the [[Royal Society]] on 29 May 1746, had connected three Leyden jars together in a kind of electrostatic battery on 28 July 1746.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Allerhand|first1=A.|title=Who invented the earliest capacitor bank  ("battery" of Leyden jars)?

It's complicated|journal=Proceedings of the IEEE |date=2018 |volume=106 |issue=3|pages=500–501|doi=10.1109/JPROC.2018.2795846|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=8303875 |accessdate=28 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1748, [[Benjamin Franklin]] developed a system involving 11 panes of glass with thin lead plates glued on each side, and then connected together. He used the term "electrical battery" to describe his electrostatic battery in a 1749 letter about his electrical research in 1748,&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Franklin (1961). [http://franklinpapers.org/franklin/framedVolumes.jsp?vol=3&amp;page=352a To Peter Collinson, April 29, 1749]. In Leonard W. Labaree, ed., ''The Papers of Benjamin Franklin'' vol. 3: 1745–1750. New Haven: Yale University Press,  p. 352: §18.
For a discussion of the significance of this and other Franklin letters and how they express Franklin's explanation of "Muschenbroek’s wonderful bottle" see: {{cite book|last1=Kuehn|first1=K| work=A student's guide through the great physics texts.

A Turky is to be killed for our Dinners by the Electrical Shock; and roasted by the electrical Jack, before a Fire kindled by the Electrified Bottle; when the Healths of all the Famous Electricians in England, France and Germany, are to be drank in Electrified Bumpers, under the Discharge of Guns from the Electrical Battery." §29.&lt;/ref&gt; This is the first recorded use of the term ''electrical battery''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Allerhand|first1=A.|title=Who invented the earliest capacitor bank  ("battery" of Leyden jars)?

Starting in late 1756, [[Franz Aepinus]], in a complicated interaction of cooperation and independent work with [[Johan Wilcke]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Home |first1=R.W.| work=Aepinus's Essay on the Theory of Electricity and Magnetism|date=2015|publisher=[[ Princeton University Press]]|title=The Electrical Background|isbn=978-1-4008-6952-7|orig-year=1979|pages=89–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;, developed an "air condenser", a variation on the Leyden jar, by using air rather than glass as the dielectric.  This functioning apparatus, without glass, created a problem for Benjamin Franklin's explanation of the Leyden jar, which maintained that the charge was located in the glass.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Heilbron| first = J.L.| author-link=John L.

By the middle of the 19th century, the Leyden jar had become common enough for writers to assume their readers knew of and understood its basic operation.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} Around the turn of the century it began to be widely used in [[spark-gap transmitter]]s and medical [[electrotherapy]] equipment. By the early 20th century, improved dielectrics and the need to reduce their size and undesired [[inductance]] and [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] for use in the new technology of [[radio]] caused the Leyden jar to evolve into the modern compact form of [[capacitor]].

== Design ==
[[Image:Leyden jar showing construction.png|thumb|upright=0.7|left|Leyden jar construction.]]
A typical design consists of a [[glass]] jar with conducting tin foil coating the inner and outer surfaces. The foil coatings stop short of the mouth of the jar, to prevent the charge from arcing between the foils. A metal rod [[electrode]] projects through the stopper at the mouth of the jar, electrically connected by some means (usually a hanging chain) to the inner foil, to allow it to be charged. The jar is charged by an [[electrostatic generator]], or other source of electric charge, connected to the inner electrode while the outer foil is [[ground (electricity)|grounded]]. The inner and outer surfaces of the jar store equal but opposite charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/capacitor3.htm | title=How Capacitors Work| date=2007-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original form of the device was just a glass bottle partially filled with water, with a metal wire passing through a cork closing it. The role of the outer plate was provided by the hand of the experimenter. Soon [[John Bevis]] found (in 1747) that it was possible to coat the exterior of the jar with metal foil, and he also found that he could achieve the same effect by using a plate of glass with metal foil on both sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wolf|first1=A|last2=McKie|first2=D.|title=A history of science, technology and philosophy in the 18th century|date=1962|publisher=George Allen &amp; Unwin|location=London|page=224|edition=2nd|url=https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.460063/2015.460063.A-History#page/n261/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; These developments inspired [[William Watson (scientist)|William Watson]] in the same year to have a jar made with a metal foil lining both inside and outside, dropping the use of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|{{cite book|last1=Wolf|first1=A|last2=McKie|first2=D.|title=A history of science, technology and philosophy in the 18th century|date=1962|publisher=George Allen &amp; Unwin|location=London|page=224|edition=2nd|url=https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.460063/2015.460063.A-History#page/n261/mode/2up}}|{{cite journal|last1=Watson|first1=W.|title=III.

Early experimenters (such as [[Benjamin Wilson (painter)|Benjamin Wilson]] in 1746) reported that the thinner the [[dielectric]] and the greater the surface, the greater the charge that could be accumulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Anders |first1=André |title=Cathodic Arcs: From Fractal Spots to Energetic Condensation |volume=50 |date=2008 |publisher=Springer |location=New York |isbn=978-0-387-79108-1 |url=https://books.google.dk/books?id=rwIUhsbBHQYC&amp;pg=PA9|page=9 |doi=10.1007/978-0-387-79108-1_2|chapter=A Brief History of Cathodic Arc Coating |series=Springer Series on Atomic, Optical, and Plasma Physics }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further developments in electrostatics revealed that the dielectric material was not essential, but increased the storage capability ([[capacitance]]) and prevented arcing between the plates. Two plates separated by a small distance also act as a capacitor, even in a [[vacuum]].

== Storage of the charge ==
[[File:Dissectible Leyden jar.png|thumb|upright=0.4|"Dissectible" Leyden jar, 1876]]
[[File:Leyden unit jar.png|thumb|upright|Measuring Leyden jar]]
It was initially believed that the charge was stored in the water in early Leyden jars. In the 1700s American statesman and scientist [[Benjamin Franklin]] performed extensive investigations of both water-filled and foil Leyden jars, which led him to conclude that the charge was stored in the glass, not in the water. A popular experiment, due to Franklin, which seems to demonstrate this involves taking a jar apart after it has been charged and showing that little charge can be found on the metal plates, and therefore it must be in the [[dielectric]].  The first documented instance of this demonstration is in a 1749 letter by Franklin.&lt;ref&gt;Letter IV: Benjamin Franklin to Peter Collinson, April 29, 1749 (Bigelow vol II p. 237-253) [http://www.compadre.org/precollege/items/Load.cfm?ID=3430 (PDF containing extracts)]&lt;/ref&gt;  Franklin designed a "dissectible" Leyden jar ''(right)'', which was widely used in demonstrations. The jar is constructed out of a glass cup nested between two fairly snugly fitting metal cups. When the jar is charged with a high voltage and carefully dismantled, it is discovered that all the parts may be freely handled without discharging the jar. If the pieces are re-assembled, a large [[electric spark|spark]] may still be obtained from it.

This demonstration appears to suggest that [[capacitor]]s store their charge inside their dielectric. This theory was taught throughout the 1800s. However, this phenomenon is a special effect caused by the high voltage on the Leyden jar.&lt;ref name="Mills"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mills | first = Allan | authorlink =  | title = Part 6: The Leyden jar and other capacitors | journal = Bulletin of the Scientific Instrument Society | volume =  | issue = 99 | pages = 20–22 | date = December 2008 | url = http://www.sis.org.uk/bulletin/99/mills.pdf | issn =  | doi =  | id =  | accessdate = 2010-06-13 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110727024546/http://www.sis.org.uk/bulletin/99/mills.pdf | archivedate = 2011-07-27 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the dissectible Leyden jar, charge is transferred to the surface of the glass cup by [[corona discharge]] when the jar is disassembled; this is the source of the residual charge after the jar is reassembled. Handling the cup while disassembled does not provide enough contact to remove all the surface charge. [[Soda glass]] is [[hygroscopic]] and forms a partially conductive coating on its surface, which holds the charge.&lt;ref name="Mills" /&gt; Addenbrook (1922) found that in a dissectible jar made of paraffin wax, or glass baked to remove moisture, the charge remained on the metal plates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Addenbrooke | first = G.

==Quantity of charge==
Originally, the amount of [[capacitance]] was measured in number of '[[jar (unit)|jars]]' of a given size, or through the total coated area, assuming reasonably standard thickness and composition of the glass. A typical Leyden jar of one [[pint]] size has a capacitance of about 1 [[farad|nF]].

== Residual charge ==
If a charged Leyden jar is discharged by shorting the inner and outer coatings and left to sit for a few minutes, the jar will recover some of its previous charge, and a second spark can be obtained from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title = Electrostatics | encyclopedia = Encyclopædia Britannica, 11th Ed. | volume = 9 | pages = 246 | publisher = The Encyclopædia Britannica Co. | year = 1910 | id = | url = https://archive.org/stream/EncyclopaediaBritannicaDict.a.s.l.g.i.11thed.chisholm.1910-1911-1922.33vols/09.EncyBrit.11th.1910.v.9.EDW-EVA.#page/n271/mode/2up/search/Leyden | accessdate = 2018-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often this can be repeated, and a series of 4 or 5 sparks, decreasing in length, can be obtained at intervals. This effect is caused by [[dielectric absorption]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Graf | first = Rudolf F. | authorlink = | title = Modern dictionary of electronics, 7th Ed. | publisher = [[Newnes]] | year = 1999 | location = | pages = 192 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=uah1PkxWeKYC&amp;pg=PA192 | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-7506-9866-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sites of Special Scientific Interest|SSSIs]] in the UK are [[SSSI notification|notified]] using the concept of an [[Area of Search]] (AOS), an area of between {{convert|400|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} and {{convert|4000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} in size.&lt;ref&gt;Joint Nature Conservation Committee (1998 revision); ''Guidelines for the Selection of Biological SSSIs'', section 4.11, p. 17. {{ISBN|1873701721}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Areas of Search were conceived and developed between 1975 and 1979 by the [[Nature Conservancy Council]] (NCC), based on regions created by the [[Local Government Act 1972]].&lt;ref&gt;Joint Nature Conservation Committee (1998 revision); ''Guidelines for the Selection of Biological SSSIs'', section 4.5, pp. 14–15. {{ISBN|1873701721}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas England had its Areas of Search based on 46 counties, those in Wales were based on a combination of the counties and smaller districts. In 1974, Wales was divided into 8 counties, with 37 [[Districts of Wales|districts]]. The NCC created 12 Welsh Areas of Search; they mostly follow county borders, but the larger counties ([[Dyfed]], [[Powys]] and [[Gwynedd]]) were divided into multiple Areas using district borders. [[Mid Glamorgan|Mid]] and [[South Glamorgan]] were merged into a single AOS, whilst [[Llanelli (district)|Llanelli district]] was included in the [[West Glamorgan]] AOS.

Due to subsequent local government reorganisation in the UK since 1972, many counties and districts have been divided, merged or renamed. Using the AOS system alone would make it difficult to search for individual SSSI citations via the [[Countryside Council for Wales]] (CCW) database without knowing 1972 region divisions. As a result, the CCW groups Welsh SSSIs using the [[Local government in Wales|subdivisions of Wales]] formed in April 1996 by the [[Local Government (Wales) Act 1994]], resulting in 22 [[Principal areas#Wales|principal areas]].

West Gwynedd AOS lies within the counties of Gwynedd and the [[Isle of Anglesey]].

Although the written history of [[California]] is not long, records of earthquakes exist that affected the [[Spanish missions in California|Spanish missions]] that were constructed beginning in the late 18th century. Those records ceased when the missions were [[Secularization|secularized]] in 1834, and from that point until the [[California Gold Rush]] in the 1840s, records were sparse. Other sources for the occurrence of earthquakes usually came from ship captains and other explorers. The earliest known earthquake was documented in 1769 by the Spanish explorers and Catholic missionaries of the [[Portolá expedition]] as they traveled northward from [[San Diego]] along the [[Santa Ana River]] near the present site of [[Los Angeles]]. For the period 1850–2004, there was about one potentially damaging event per year on average, though many of these did not cause loss of life or property damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=California earthquake history |url=http://www.annalsofgeophysics.eu/index.php/annals/article/view/3317/3363 |first=T.

The few damaging earthquakes that occurred in the [[Midwestern United States|American Midwest]] and the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] were well known ([[1755 Cape Ann earthquake|1755 Cape Ann]], [[1811–12 New Madrid earthquakes|1811–12 New Madrid]], [[1886 Charleston earthquake|1886 Charleston]]), and it became apparent to [[settler]]s that the earthquake hazard situation was much different in [[Western United States|the West]]. While the [[1812 San Juan Capistrano earthquake|1812 San Juan Capistrano]], [[1857 Fort Tejon earthquake|1857 Fort Tejon]], and [[1872 Lone Pine earthquake|1872 Lone Pine]] shocks were only moderately destructive in mostly unpopulated areas, the [[1868 Hayward earthquake|1868 Hayward]] event affected the thriving [[Financial centre|financial hub]] that is the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], with damage from [[Santa Rosa, California|Santa Rosa]] in the north to [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]] in the south. By this time, scientists were well aware of the threat, but [[seismology]] was still in its infancy. Reactions following destructive events in the late 19th and early 20th centuries included [[Real estate development|real estate developers]], [[News media|press]], and [[Boosterism|boosters]] minimizing and downplaying the risk out of fear that the ongoing [[Business cycle|economic boom]] would be negatively affected.&lt;ref name=Hough&gt;{{citation|title=Richter's Scale: Measure of an Earthquake, Measure of a Man|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rvmDeAxEiO8C|first=S.

According to seismologist [[Charles Francis Richter|Charles Richter]], the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]] moved the [[Federal government of the United States|United States Government]] into acknowledging the problem. Prior to that, no agency was specifically focused on researching earthquake activity. The [[National Weather Service|United States Weather Bureau]] did record when they happened and several [[United States Geological Survey]] scientists had briefly disengaged from their regular duties of mapping [[mineral]] resources to write reports on the New Madrid and Charleston events, but no trained geologists were working on the problem until the [[U.S. National Geodetic Survey|Coast and Geodetic Survey]] was made responsible after 1906. The outlook improved when Professor [[Andrew Lawson]] brought the state's [[Berkeley Seismological Laboratory|first monitoring program]] online at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1910 with seismologist [[Harry O. Wood|Harry Wood]], who was later instrumental in getting the [[Caltech Seismological Laboratory]] operational in the 1920s.&lt;ref name=Hough/&gt;&lt;ref name=Goodstein&gt;{{citation|title=Millikan's School: A History of the California Institute of Technology|first=J. R.|last=Goodstein|authorlink=Judith R. Goodstein|year=2006|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|isbn= 978-0393329988|pages=125–152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early developments at the [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]] lab in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] included an earthquake observation network using their own custom built short period [[seismometer]]s, the [[Richter magnitude scale]], and an updated version of the [[Mercalli intensity scale]]. In 1933, the [[1933 Long Beach earthquake|Long Beach earthquake]] occurred in a populated area and damaged or destroyed a large number of public school buildings in Long Beach and Los Angeles. Some decades later, the [[1971 San Fernando earthquake|San Fernando earthquake]] affected the [[San Fernando Valley]] north of Los Angeles with heavy damage to several hospitals. In both cases, the perception of those involved with policy making in California was changed, and state laws and [[building code]]s were modified (but not without much debate) to require commercial and residential properties to be built to [[Earthquake-resistant structures|withstand earthquakes]]. Higher standards were established for fire stations, hospitals, and schools and construction of dwellings was also restricted near [[active fault]]s.&lt;ref name=Geschwind/&gt;&lt;ref name=Goodstein/&gt;

==Tectonic setting==
{{see also|Los Angeles Basin|Mendocino Fracture Zone|Salton Trough}}

During the [[Cenozoic|last 66 million years]], nearly the entire west coast of North America was dominated by a [[subduction zone]], with the [[Farallon Plate]] subducting beneath the [[North American Plate]]. Presently, the [[Juan de Fuca Plate]] (with its [[Explorer Plate|Explorer]] and [[Gorda Plate|Gorda]] satellite plates) and the [[Rivera Plate|Rivera]] and [[Cocos Plate]]s are the only remnants of the once much larger Farallon Plate. The plate margin that remains in California is that of the [[Fault (geology)#Strike-slip faults|strike-slip]] [[San Andreas Fault]] (SAF), the [[wikt:diffuse|diffuse]] [[Pacific Plate|Pacific]]–North American plate boundary that extends east into the [[Basin and Range Province]] of [[eastern California]] and [[western Nevada]] (a seismically active area called [[Walker Lane]]) and southwest into the California Continental Borderland region off the central and southern coasts. This system of [[Fault (geology)|faults]] terminates in the north at the [[Mendocino Triple Junction]], one of the most seismically active regions in the state, where earthquakes are occasionally the result of [[intraplate deformation]] within the Gorda Plate. It terminates in the south at the [[Salton Sea]] where displacement transitions to a series of [[Extensional tectonics|spreading centers]] and [[transform fault]]s, beginning with the [[Brawley Seismic Zone]] in the [[Imperial Valley]].&lt;ref name=Yeats&gt;{{citation|title=Active Faults of the World|last=Yeats|first=R.|date=2012|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0521190855|pages=19, 80–83, 89–94, 96–114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], the San Andreas system of faults spans offshore and into the East Bay area, with the bulk of the faults lying to the east of the main SAF. There is a 70% probability that one of these faults will generate a M6.7 or greater earthquake before 2030, including the [[Hayward Fault Zone]], which has gone beyond its average [[return period]] of 130 years (150 years as of 2018). While the SAF north of [[San Francisco]] is quiet, the central SAF segment near [[San Juan Bautista, California|San Juan Bautista]] is where [[fault creep]] was first studied, and to the south is where the recurring [[Parkfield earthquake]]s occur. The secondary faults lay to the west of the main SAF at the extreme southern portion, including the active and young [[San Jacinto Fault Zone]], which may be taking over as the primary boundary south of [[Cajon Pass]]. A [[Paleoseismology|paleoseismic]] investigation using [[Lidar]] revealed that more than {{convert|5|m|sp=us}} of slip has accumulated since the [[1857 Fort Tejon earthquake|1857 event]] on the southern SAF, which borders the [[Mojave Desert]] to the north and east of the Greater Los Angeles Area. Near the [[Transverse Ranges]], [[Fault (geology)#Dip-slip faults|reverse]] and [[thrust fault]]s have produced damaging earthquakes in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] and the [[San Fernando Valley]].&lt;ref name=Yeats/&gt;

It is based on the area of perceptibility (as presented on [[isoseismal map]]s). {{M|w|link=y}} = moment magnitude scale and {{M|s|link=y}} = surface wave magnitude. The inclusion criteria for adding events are based on [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Earthquakes|WikiProject Earthquakes]]' [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Earthquakes/notability guidelines|notability guideline]] that was developed for stand alone articles. The principles described are also applicable to lists. In summary, only damaging, injurious, or deadly events should be recorded. &lt;br&gt; dmge = damage, m = million, b = billion&lt;/small&gt;

The following table lists the largest man-made dams by volume of fill/structure. By general definition, a dam is a barrier that impounds water or underground streams, hence [[tailings dam]]s are relegated to a separate list. Be aware that data on volume of structure is not as easily available or reliable as data on dam height and reservoir volume.

This is a list of ''[[lunar mare|maria]]'' (large, dark, [[basalt]]ic plains) on the [[Moon]]. It also includes the one ''oceanus'' and the features known by the names ''lacus'', ''palus'' and ''sinus''. The modern system of lunar nomenclature was introduced in 1651 by [[Giovanni Battista Riccioli]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Moore| first = Patrick | authorlink = Patrick Moore | title = The Guinness book of astronomy facts and feats | publisher = Guinness Superlatives Ltd | location = Enfield, Middlesex | date = 1983 | page = 25 | doi = | isbn = 0-85112-258-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Riccioli's map of the moon was drawn by [[Francesco Maria Grimaldi]], who has a crater named after him.

This '''list of old waterbodies of the Rhine''' contains a selection of ox-bow lakes and [[meander]]s of the [[River Rhine]] which go under various names that mean Old Rhine or Old Arm [of the Rhine]: '''[[Alter Rhein]]''', '''Altrhein''', '''Altrheinarm''', '''Altrheinzug''', '''Altarm''', '''Rheinaltarm''' or '''Restrhein'''. Artificially created waterbodies, such as [[quarry]] ponds; e.&amp;nbsp;g. the ''Altrheinsee'', which may be confused with old branches of the Rhine are mentioned in the section [[#Waterbodies linked to the Rhine|Waterbodies linked to the Rhine]]''.
[[File:Altrheinärme.jpg|thumb|300px|upright|Rhine with old waterbodies between [[Germersheim]] and [[Speyer]] (looking downstream); both in [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] (left) with [[Baden-Württemberg]] (right)]]

As a result of natural translocation, the ox-bows and meanders of the Rhine riverbed remain as side arms of the New Rhine (''Neurhein''); others were cut off as a result of artificial river canalisation, such as in the wake of the canalisation of the Rhine (''Rheinbegradigung'') from 1817 under the direction of [[Johann Gottfried Tulla]]. These old waters, together with the New Rhine, circumscribe islands or peninsulas. The old river courses have mostly lost their water-bearing link to the New Rhine. Many lie within nature reserves, offer breeding sites for water birds or act as [[washland]]s during flooding. Sometimes they are used by canoeists or anglers.

== Old Rhine waterbodies ==&lt;!-- if possible with "GKZ"/"ID" --&gt;
''Locating old Rhine waterbodies in the list:''
Some names of old Rhine waterbodies include the name of a nearby town or village; others do not. In order to make it easy to find in every case, the nearby settlement is usually written in alphabetical order and ''italics'' before each waterbody name as a means of locating it. Next, the [[coordinates]] of the waterbody and its position on the Rhine (l/r&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp; left/right) follow, then comes either the waterbody name itself in normal lettering, as well as other names of the waterbody in italics. Or there may just be a reference to the name of another place name behind the town name, under which the river is listed in'' italics''.

=== Altarm ===

The '''Luzon rainforest''' is a [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|moist broadleaf forest]] that contains the [[lowland]]s (below 1000 m) of [[Luzon]] and the [[Montane forest#Montane forests|montane rainforests]] located on a several [[Volcano|volcanic]] and non-volcanic [[mountains]] of the [[island]]. The [[rainforest]] encompasses about 95,571 square kilometers (36,900 sq mi) out of the 109,965 sq kilometers (42,458 sq mi) of total area of the island of Luzon.&lt;ref name="WWF"&gt;Lamoreux, John. [http://worldwildlife.org/ecoregions/im0123 "Southeastern Asia: Luzon Island in the Philippines"]. WWF - Endangered Species Conservation. World Wildlife Fund, n.d.  24 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Luzon is the largest and most northern island of the [[Philippines]], located in the western [[Pacific Ocean]]. Though it is the most extensive rainforest ecoregion of the Philippines, very little of the original rainforest remains. Considered a part of the Luzon rainforest ecoregion are the [[Batanes]] and [[Babuyan Islands]] to the north, [[Catanduanes]] and [[Polillo Islands]] to the east, and [[Marinduque]] to the southwest.&lt;ref name="WWF"/&gt; The status of this area is [[critically endangered|critical]]/[[endangered]].&lt;ref name="WWF"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Ph Territorial Map.png|thumb|left|Territorial limits of the [[Philippines]]. ]]

===Geography===
Luzon has never been connected to mainland [[Asia]]. Even when [[glacial]] advances during the [[Pleistocene]] caused sea levels to fall over 100 meters worldwide, this only connected Luzon to the modern islands of [[Polillo Islands|Polillo]], [[Marinduque]], and [[Catanduanes]].&lt;ref name="WWF"/&gt; At least 15 million years ago, friction between the [[Australian plate|Australian]] and [[Eurasian Plate|Asian]] [[tectonic plates]] and volcanic activity created parts of the Luzon [[highlands]], which over the next 10 million years morphed into their modern form.&lt;ref name="WWF"/&gt; This long period of [[topographic isolation|isolation]] and complex internal [[geography]] is a primary cause for the great [[biodiversity]] and high degree of [[endemism]] found on the island of Luzon.&lt;ref name="elevation"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rickart | first1 = E. A. | last2 = Heaney | first2 = L. R. | last3 = Balete | first3 = D. S. | last4 = Tabaranza | first4 = Jr. | year = 2010 | title = Small Mammal Diversity Along An Elevational Gradient In Northern Luzon, Philippines | doi = 10.1016/j.mambio.2010.01.006 | journal = Mammalian Biology - Zeitschrift fur Saugetierkunde | volume = 76 | issue = 1| pages = 12–21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human activity===

====Pre-historic====
In 2005, evidence for human occupation in northern Luzon since at least 25,000 years ago, was found in [[Callao Cave]].&lt;ref name="callao"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mijares | first1 = Salvador B. | last2 = Armand | first2 =  | year = 2008 | title = The Late Pleistocene to Early Holocene Foragers of Northern Luzon | url = | journal = Indo-Pacific Prehistory Association Bulletin | volume = 28 | issue = | pages = 99–107 | doi=10.7152/bippa.v28i0.12022}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence included [[chert]] [[flake tools]], charred [[parenchymatous]] tissues, starch grains, grasses, and [[Moraceae]] [[phytolith]].&lt;ref name="callao"/&gt; The possibility of [[hunter-gatherers]] subsisting in [[Holocene]] [[tropical rain forests]] without support from [[agriculturalists]] was debated, based on the patchy and [[seasonal]] [[resources]].&lt;ref name="callao"/&gt; Wild forest animals are lean and lacking in [[food energy|calorie]]-rich [[fat]].&lt;ref name="callao"/&gt;

[[File:Aetas on stage.jpg|thumb|right|[[Agta]] people performing on a stage.]]
However, hunters and gatherers may have managed by strategizing and moving to correspond to the shifting food resources.&lt;ref name="callao"/&gt; Information on skeletal [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] and [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] is merely speculative as no human remains were recovered from this time period. This idea is supported by the Sierra Madre [[Agta]] of the recent [[ethnographic]] past who would plan their movements based on the seasons and available resources; they hunted in the montane forest during the [[rainy season]] and in the lowland forest during the [[summer]].&lt;ref name="callao"/&gt; Most of their food supply came from [[fishing]], [[shellfish]] gathering, wild [[yam (vegetable)|yams]], [[nut (fruit)|nuts]], and [[Caryota]] palms.&lt;ref name="callao"/&gt;

In the same cave two years later, in 2007, the same scientist found a [[metatarsal]] bone dated to at least around 67,000 years ago, which is speculated to possibly be of ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' origin. The bone (Right MT3 – the small bone from the end of the middle toe of the right foot) has been identified as belonging to a species of the genus ''[[Homo]]''. To tell if the bone belongs to an ancient [[anatomically modern humans|anatomically modern human]], a [[skull]] or [[mandible]] from the specimen is needed. This [[fossilized]] remain from [[Callao Cave]] is referred to as [[Callao Man]].

====World War II====
During [[World War II]], the [[Japanese people|Japanese]] invaded the [[Philippines]], and a small band of the [[Communist Party of the Philippines]] (CPP) [[activists]] used the dense mountain [[jungles]] and vast [[swamps]] of the Luzon rainforest for protection.&lt;ref name="WWII"&gt;Greenberg, Major Lawrence M. "The Hukbalahap Insurrection:  A Case Study of a Successful Anti-Insurgency Operation in the Philippines, 1946-1955." Historical Analysis Series 93-8 (1987). U.S. Army Center of Military History. Web. 2 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[communist]] activists established a base of operations in the nearby [[Mt. Arayat]] and the [[Candaba Swamp]].&lt;ref name="WWII"/&gt; These activists launched small yet annoying attacks against the Japanese.&lt;ref name="WWII"/&gt; On December 10, 1941, CPP leaders issued a [[manifesto]] vowing their support for the anti-Japanese efforts of the [[Commonwealth]] and the [[United States]], and urging the peasants to support this united anti-Japanese front.&lt;ref name="WWII"/&gt; Resulting was the organization of the [[Hukbalahap]], an acronym for the Hukbong Bayan Laban sa Hapon (the Anti-Japanese Army), in a small lowland forest clearing near Mt. Arayat on March 29, 1942 by the merging of the CPP with the remaining [[socialist]] and peasant organizations of Luzon.&lt;ref name="WWII"/&gt;

==Habitats==

===Lowlands===
[[File:Oriod burnt.jpg|thumb|right|Destruction of lowland areas of the [[Sierra Madre (Philippines)|Sierra Madre]]. ]]
The rainforest of the lowlands encompass all areas below {{convert|1000|m|ft}} in [[altitude]].&lt;ref name="WWF"/&gt; Much of the lowland rainforest has been destroyed by human [[deforestation]] activities.&lt;ref name="elevation"/&gt; 

[[Dipterocarp]] trees with wide [[buttress root|buttresses]] dominate this area.&lt;ref name="montane"&gt;McGinley, Mark. [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Luzon_montane_rain_forests "Luzon Montane Rain Forests"]. ''The Encyclopedia of Earth''. World Wildlife Fund, 30 May 2007. 24 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; These trees are massive, growing up to {{convert|60|m|ft}} tall with diameters between {{convert|1|-|2|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="WWF"/&gt; ''[[Vatica pachyphylla]]'' is a [[critically endangered]] tree species [[endemic]] to the ecoregion. &lt;ref name=iucn&gt;[http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/33157/0  2006 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, Critically Endangered A1cd ver 2.3: Report for ''Vatica pachyphylla'']; Ashton, P. 1998 . accessed 10.31.2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mature lowland forests tend to have an uneven [[canopy (biology)|canopy]] height. [[Rattan]]s and [[lianas]] grow in the [[understory]], receiving the light they need to thrive through areas of disturbance.&lt;ref name="WWF"/&gt; There is generally a large amount of [[herbaceous]] [[undergrowth]], with [[epiphyte|epiphytic]] [[fern]]s and [[orchids]] growing on the thick [[branches]] of tall trees.&lt;ref name="WWF"/&gt;

===Montane forests===
In the south of the island, the [[ecoregion]] comprises several [[volcanic]] as well as non-volcanic [[mountains]] that exceed {{convert|1000|m|ft}}  in altitude.&lt;ref name="WWF"/&gt; The volcanic mountains include [[Mt. Makiling]], [[Mt. Banahaw]], [[Mt. Isarog]], [[Mayon Volcano]], and [[Bulusan Volcano]].&lt;ref name="WWF"/&gt; Also within the ecoregion are the Northern and Southern [[Sierra Madre (Philippines)|Sierra Madre]], Mt. Sapacoy, Mt. Magnas, and Mt. Agnamala in the northern [[Cordillera Central (Luzon)|Cordillera Central]] highlands and the [[Zambales Mountains]] in the west.&lt;ref name="montane"/&gt;
[[File:Ultrabasic forests above 1200 m at Barangay Diddadungan - ZooKeys-266-001-g006.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Sierra Madre (Philippines)|Sierra Madre]] mountain range.]]

In some areas, annual [[rainfall]] can be about quadruple what the lowland rainforests receive (as high as 10,000&amp;nbsp;mm).&lt;ref name="montane"/&gt; The Sierra Madres have very mild [[seasons]], with a slight [[dry season|dry period]] between December and April. The [[Zambales Mountains]] and northern [[Cordillera Central (Luzon)|Central Cordillera]] highlands are more strongly seasonal with a longer dry period and slightly less rainfall generally.&lt;ref name="montane"/&gt;
[[File:BatongBuhay1872.jpg|thumb|right|Batong Buhay jeep on its 5-hour once a day journey through the [[Cordillera Central (Luzon)|Cordillera Central]] to [[Tabuk, Kalinga|Tabuk]], the capital of [[Kalinga (province)|Kalinga province]].]]

The [[dipterocarp]] trees of the lowlands are gradually replaced by [[Quercus|oak]] and [[laurel forest]] species with increasing altitude.&lt;ref name="montane"/&gt; The forests generally have less undergrowth and become shorter in stature as altitude increases.&lt;ref name="montane"/&gt; With the decreasing temperature from increasing altitude, [[decomposition]] is slowed and results in a forest floor thick with [[humus]].&lt;ref name="montane"/&gt; 

In the montane forests, [[epiphytes]], [[vines]], and [[moss]]-covered branches are very common.&lt;ref name="montane"/&gt; The highest altitudes of montane forests are caller upper montane forest, or [[elfin forest]], and are more extreme: trees are shorter in stature, and tree branches are so thick with moss and [[organic material]] that they can sustain aerial plants that are not typically [[epiphytes]].&lt;ref name="montane"/&gt; Many [[endemic]] animal species reside in the thick, matty soil of the upper montane forests.&lt;ref name="montane"/&gt;

In fact, [[species richness]] is greatest along the highest elevations of the montane rainforests of Luzon.&lt;ref name="elevation"/&gt; Areas with the greatest levels of endemism are reported to be the [[Cordillera Central, Luzon|Cordillera Central]] highlands, the [[Sierra Madre (Philippines)|Sierra Madre]], the [[Zambales Mountains]], and [[highlands]] on the [[Bicol Peninsula]].&lt;ref name="elevation"/&gt;

==Biodiversity==
There are at least 31 [[endemic]] species of [[mammals]] on the island of [[Luzon]].&lt;ref name="conservation"/&gt; Sixty-eight percent of all known native non-flying mammals are endemic to the area (23 of 34).&lt;ref name="elevation"/&gt;
[[File:Pithecophaga jefferyi.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Philippine eagle]]. ]]
The [[Philippine eagle]] (Pithecophaga jefferyi) is the second-largest [[eagle]] in the world found primarily in the Sierra Madre mountain range of Luzon.&lt;ref name="conservation"&gt;[http://www.conservation.org/Pages/default.aspx "Philippines"]. ''Conservation International'' (24 May 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="birds"/&gt; Primary lowland rainforests of the Philippines have been heavily [[deforested]], and the Philippine eagle needs this area to breed, as well as nesting in large trees and hunting within the trees.&lt;ref name="conservation"/&gt;&lt;ref name="birds"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Poulsen | first1 = M. K. | year = 1995 | title = The Threatened and Near-Threatened Birds of Luzon, Philippines, and the Role of the Sierra Madre Mountains in Their Conservation | url = http://www.journals.cup.org/download.php?file=%2FBCI%2FBCI5_01%2FS0959270900002963a.pdf&amp;code=02b3b066159cb294533e435a6523a1b7 | journal = Bird Conservation International | volume = 5 | issue = 1| pages = 79–115 | doi=10.1017/s0959270900002963}}&lt;/ref&gt; The eagle is restricted to the islands of [[Luzon]], [[Samar]], [[Leyte]], and [[Mindanao]].&lt;ref name="birds"/&gt; Attempts for [[captive breeding]] have been unsuccessful and it is estimated that less than 700 individuals remain.&lt;ref name="conservation"/&gt;

Often called Myer’s snake in honor of Dr. [[George S. Myers]], the genus ''Myersophis'' represented only by the species ''alpestris'' is a [[snake]] found only in the northern highlands of Luzon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Taylor | first1 = E.

About sixty-eight percent of all [[Indigenous (ecology)|native]] [[reptiles]] are [[endemic]] to the area (about 160 of 235).&lt;ref name="conservation"/&gt; The [[Philippine crocodile]], Crocodylus mindorensis, is a [[freshwater crocodile]] that is considered the most threatened crocodile in the world and is endemic to the area; it is only found in [[Mindanao]], [[Negros (island)|Negros]], and [[Luzon]].&lt;ref name="croc"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ploeg | first1 =  | last2 = Weerd | first2 =  | year = 2003 | title = A New Future for the Philippine Crocodile, Crocodylus mindorensis | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235800476_A_new_future_for_the_Philippine_crocodile_Crocodylus_mindorensis/file/9fcfd5139f795a09df.pdf | format = PDF | journal = The Technical Journal of Philippine Ecosystems and Natural Resources | volume = 13 | issue = 1&amp;2| pages = 31–50 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wild populations in 1982 totaled somewhere between 500 and 1000 individuals.&lt;ref name="conservation"/&gt; In 1995, this number decreased to a mere 100 individuals.&lt;ref name="conservation"/&gt; The discovery of a population of this crocodile in the Northern Sierra Madre on Luzon gives hope for its [[conservation biology|conservation]].&lt;ref name="croc"/&gt; Active in the conservation of ''Crocodylus mindorensis'' is the Crocodile Rehabilitation Observance and Conservation (CROC) Project of the Mabuwaya Foundation.&lt;ref name="conservation"/&gt;

The Sierra Madres give hope to many other threatened animals by providing one of the largest areas of intact rainforest in the Philippines thereby maintaining the naturally high level of [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref name="birds"/&gt; Many species of [[threatened]] [[birds]] are found in this location.&lt;ref name="birds"/&gt;

Recently, a presidential proclamation established the Quirino Protected Landscape covering 206,875 hectares in northeastern Luzon.&lt;ref name="conservation"/&gt; There is also the [[Quezon Protected Landscape]], covering about 164&amp;nbsp;km (102 miles) of lowland rainforest in Southern Sierra Madres. The Luzon rainforest is not a priority preservation area according to the [[World Wildlife Fund]].

'''''Mautam''''' ([[Mizo language|Mizo]] for "bamboo death") is a cyclic [[ecology|ecological]] phenomenon that occurs every 48 - 50 years in the northeastern [[India]]n states of [[Mizoram]] and [[Manipur]], which are 30% covered by wild [[bamboo]] forests, as well as [[Chin State]] in [[Myanmar]], particularly [[Hakha Township|Hakha]], [[Thantlang Township|Thantlang]], [[Falam Township|Falam]], [[Paletwa Township|Paletwa]], and [[Matupi Township]]s. One of its stages involves a rat boom, which in turn creates a widespread famine in those areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.mizzima.com/news/inside-burma/4-inside-burma/831-swarms-of-rats-destroy-crops-in-townships-in-chin-state | publisher = Mizzima | title = Inside Burma | contribution = Swarms of rats destroy crops in townships in Chin state}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

During ''mautam'', ''[[Melocanna|Melocanna baccifera]]'', a species of bamboo, [[flowering|flowers]] at one time across a wide area. This event is followed invariably by a plague of [[black rat]]s in what is called a '''rat flood'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/rats/janzen.html | title = Rat Attack, Plant vs. Predator | publisher = PBS}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Normile | first = D |title=Holding back a torrent of rats |journal=Science |volume=327 |issue=5967 |pages=806–7 |date=February 2010 | pmid = 20150483 |doi=10.1126/science.327.5967.806}}&lt;/ref&gt; This occurs as the rats multiply in response to the temporary windfall of seeds, and leave the forests to forage on stored grain when the bamboo seeds are exhausted, which in turn causes devastating [[famine]].&lt;ref name = species&gt;{{Citation | first = Peter | last = Foster | url = http://www.papillonsartpalace.com/bamfboo.htm | title = Bamboo threatens to bring Indian famine | date = 14 October 2004 | publisher = Papillons art palace}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Famines thus caused have played a significant part in shaping the region's political history. The most recent spate of flowering, on the bamboo species' genetically linked timetable, began in May 2006, and the state government and the [[Indian Army]] attempted to prevent a famine.

==Mechanism==
After flowering, the bamboo dies and regenerates from the seeds.  The [[rodent]]s feast on these seeds which are  plentiful.  As a consequence, a sudden boom in the rat population occurs. The action of the rats is thought to be an ecological control mechanism.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} The seeds of any [[culm (botany)|culm]] of bamboo that might flower off-cycle are all eaten  by rodents, thus reinforcing the rhythm of this extreme version of a [[Mast (botany)#Mast seeding|mast year]].{{Citation needed|reason=This is a vague, group-selection flavored evolutionary claim which is made without providing any credible source.|date=October 2016}} Some experts{{who| date= April 2012}} believe that the flower has a positive effect on the [[fertility]] of the rats, as well as on increasing the viable size of a rat [[litter (animal)|litter]]. All available explanations point to the fact that the increase in their numbers during the peak year is a natural after-effect of the flowering of the bamboos.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} However, once they exhaust this temporarily abundant food supply, the rats turn their attention to [[Plant cultivation|cultivated]] [[crops]].

==History==
Records from the [[British Raj]] indicate that Mizoram suffered famine in 1862 and again in 1911, after the region witnessed similar bamboo flowerings.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} In each case, the records suggest that the flowering of the bamboo leads to a dramatic increase in the local rat population. The increase led to raids on [[granary|granaries]] and the destruction of [[paddy field]]s, and subsequently to a year-long famine.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

The 1958&amp;ndash;59 ''mautam'' resulted in the recorded deaths of at least 100 people, besides heavy loss to human property and crops.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} Some elderly villagers in the undeveloped, more traditional region, recalling this event, have claimed that their warnings based on folk traditions were dismissed as superstition by the government of [[Assam]], which then ruled what is now the [[States of India|state]] of Mizoram.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} An estimated  two million rats were killed and collected by the locals, after a bounty of 40 paisa (about US$0.01 according to present-day rates) was placed on each. However, even after the increase in the rat population was noted, preparations by the government to avoid a famine were limited.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

This negligence led to the foundation of the [[Mizo National Famine Front]], set up to provide relief to the far-flung areas. This body later became the [[Mizo National Front]] (MNF), which staged a [[March 1966 Mizo National Front uprising|major uprising in 1966]]. Under its leader [[Laldenga]] (who later became the [[Chief Minister of Mizoram|chief minister of Mizoram]]), MNF fought a bitter [[separatist]] struggle for 20 years against the [[Indian Army]] until an accord that guaranteed Mizoram's [[autonomy]] as a separate state was signed in 1986.&lt;ref name ="Arnold2011"&gt;{{cite book | first1 =Arnold P | last1 = Kaminsky | first2 =Roger D | last2 = Long | title=India Today: An Encyclopedia of Life in the Republic: An Encyclopedia of Life in the Republic | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=VVxlfDHGTFYC&amp;pg=PA473 | accessdate=28 August 2013 | date=30 September 2011 | publisher=ABC-CLIO | isbn=978-0-313-37463-0 | pages= 473–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chief Minister [[Zoramthanga]], a former [[guerrilla]] leader, made preparations for the predicted 2006 ''mautam'' for two years. In June 2006, the Indian Army was pressed into service as an emergency measure to assist the state administration in reaching remote areas. The state administration arranged for alternate [[food crop]]s to be grown locally, and also arranged for the army to provide instructions on [[pest control]]. Villagers were encouraged to grow [[turmeric]] and [[ginger]], partially as an insurance against variations in [[purchasing power]], and also because the [[aroma]]tic [[spice]]s ward off rodent raids.

Regular rodent outbreaks associated with bamboo flowering (and subsequent fruiting and seeding) also occur in the nearby Indian states of [[Arunachal Pradesh]], [[Manipur]], and [[Nagaland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.aciar.gov.au/web.nsf/att/JFRN-6BN99Y/$file/mn96chapter2.pdf | title = Rodent problems in India and strategies for their management | format = [[PDF]] | publisher = Aciar | place = [[Australia|AU]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in [[Laos]], [[Japan]], [[Madagascar]] and [[South America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.aciar.gov.au/web.nsf/att/JFRN-6BN99X/$file/mn96chapter1.pdf | title = Rodent outbreaks in the uplands of Laos: analysis of historical patterns and the identity of nuu khii | format = [[PDF]] | publisher = Aciar | place = AU}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Thingtam'', a similar famine, occurs with the flowering of another bamboo, ''[[Bambusa tulda]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = HY Mohan | last = Ram | url = http://www.ias.ac.in/jbiosci/dec2002/651.pdf | title = A passion for plant life | journal = Journal of Biosciences | volume = 27 | number = 7 | year = 2002 | pages = 659–660 | format = PDF | publisher = IAS | place = IN | doi=10.1007/bf02708373}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''mediterranean sea''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|m|ɛ|d|ɪ|t|ə|ˈ|r|eɪ|n|i|ə|n}} is, in [[oceanography]], a mostly enclosed [[sea]] that has limited exchange of water with outer [[ocean]]s and with water circulation dominated by [[salinity]] and temperature differences rather than winds. The eponymous [[Mediterranean Sea]], for example, is almost completely enclosed by [[Europe]], [[Asia]], and [[Africa]].

==Types of mediterranean seas==
There are two types of mediterranean sea

===Concentration basin===

*A '''concentration basin''' has a higher salinity than the outer ocean due to evaporation, and its water exchange consists of inflow  of the fresher oceanic water in the upper layer and outflow of the saltier mediterranean water in the lower layer of the connecting [[channel (geography)|channel]].
**The Red Sea
**The Persian Gulf
**The Eurafrican Mediterranean Sea is also a concentration basin as a whole, but the Black Sea and the Adriatic Sea are dilution basins (see below) owing to the [[Danube]], [[Don River, Russia|Don]], and [[Dnieper River|Dnieper]] Rivers and the [[Po River]] respectively.

===Dilution basin===

*A '''dilution basin''' has a lower salinity due to freshwater gains such as rainfall and rivers, and its water exchange consists of outflow of the fresher mediterranean water in the upper layer and inflow of the saltier oceanic water in the lower layer of the channel.  Renewal of deep water may not be sufficient to supply [[oxygen]] to the bottom.
**The Arctic Ocean
**The American Mediterranean Sea
**The Baltic Sea
**Baffin Bay
**The Australasian Mediterranean Sea

==Exceptions==
*The [[Hudson Bay]] is so shallow it functions like a huge [[estuary]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}
*Having shallow channels and deep basins, the [[Sea of Japan]] could form a mediterranean sea, but the strong currents from the Pacific prevent it from having an independent water circulation.
*The [[Baltic Sea]] is a [[brackish water|brackish]] [[Inland sea (geology)|inland sea]], alleged to be the largest body of brackish water in the world (other possibilities include the [[Black Sea]]). It occupies a basin formed by glacial erosion.

[[Image:Mixing length.jpg|thumb|400px|The mixing length is a distance that a fluid [[fluid parcel|parcel]] will keep its original characteristics before dispersing them into the surrounding [[fluid mechanics|fluid]]. Here, the bar on the left side of the figure is the mixing length.]]
[[File:Law of the wall (English).svg|thumb|400px|law of the wall, horizontal velocity near the wall with mixing length model]]

In [[fluid dynamics]],  the '''mixing length model''' is a method attempting to describe [[momentum]] transfer by [[turbulence]] [[Reynolds stresses]] within a [[Newtonian fluid]] [[boundary layer]] by means of an [[Viscosity#Eddy viscosity|eddy viscosity]]. The model was developed by [[Ludwig Prandtl]] in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="Holton"&gt;{{cite book |last=Holton |first=James R. |title=Dynamic Meteorology |edition=4th |series=International Geophysics Series |volume=88 |year=2004 |publisher=Elsevier Academic Press |location=Burlington, MA |pages=124–127 |chapter=Chapter 5 – The Planetary Boundary Layer }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prandtl himself had reservations about the model,&lt;ref name = "prandtl"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Prandtl | first = L. | title = Z. angew  | journal = Math. Mech. | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 136–139 | date = 1925 | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; describing it as, "only a rough approximation,"&lt;ref name = "nature"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/249135b0 | last = Bradshaw | first = P. | title = Possible origin of Prandt's mixing-length theory  | journal = Nature | volume = 249 | issue = 6 | pages = 135–136 | date = 1974 | bibcode = 1974Natur.249..135B }}&lt;/ref&gt;
but it has been used in numerous fields ever since, including [[atmospheric science]], [[oceanography]] and [[stellar structure]].&lt;ref name = "science"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.235.4787.465 | last = Chan | first = Kwing |author2=Sabatino Sofia | title = Validity Tests of the Mixing-Length Theory of Deep Convection | journal = Science | volume = 235 | issue = 4787 | pages = 465–467 | date = 1987 | pmid = 17810341|bibcode = 1987Sci...235..465C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical intuition==
The mixing length is conceptually [[analogy|analogous]] to the concept of [[mean free path]] in [[thermodynamics]]: a [[fluid parcel]] will conserve its properties for a characteristic length, &lt;math&gt;\ \xi' &lt;/math&gt;, before mixing with the surrounding fluid. Prandtl described that the mixing length,&lt;ref name = "prandtl2"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Prandtl | first = L. | title = Proc. Second Intl. Congr. Appl. Mech. | journal = Zurich | date = 1926 | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|may be considered as the diameter of the masses of fluid moving as a whole in each individual case; or again, as the distance traversed by a mass of this type before it becomes blended in with neighbouring masses...}}

In the figure above, [[temperature]], &lt;math&gt;\ T&lt;/math&gt;, is conserved for a certain distance as a parcel moves across a temperature [[gradient]]. The fluctuation in temperature that the parcel experienced throughout the process is &lt;math&gt;\ T'&lt;/math&gt;. So &lt;math&gt;\ T' &lt;/math&gt; can be seen as the temperature deviation from its surrounding environment after it has moved over this mixing length &lt;math&gt;\ \xi'&lt;/math&gt;.

==Mathematical formulation==
To begin, we must first be able to express quantities as the sums of their slowly varying components and fluctuating components.

===Reynolds decomposition===

This process is known as [[Reynolds decomposition]]. Temperature can be expressed as:

&lt;math&gt; T = \overline{T} + T'&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;ref name="reynolds"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eng.fsu.edu/~dommelen/courses/flm/flm00/topics/turb/node2.html |title=Reynolds Decomposition | publisher=[[Florida State University]] | date=6 December 2008 | accessdate=2008-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\ \overline{T}&lt;/math&gt;, is the slowly varying component and &lt;math&gt;\ T'&lt;/math&gt; is the fluctuating component.

In the above picture, &lt;math&gt;\ T'&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed in terms of the mixing length:

&lt;math&gt;\ T' = -\xi' \frac{\partial \overline{T}}{\partial z}.&lt;/math&gt;

The fluctuating components of velocity, &lt;math&gt;\ u'&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\ v'&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\ w'&lt;/math&gt;, can also be expressed in a similar fashion:

&lt;math&gt;\ u' = -\xi' \frac{\partial \overline{u}}{\partial z}, \qquad \ v' = -\xi' \frac{\partial \overline{v}}{\partial z}, \qquad \ w' = -\xi' \frac{\partial \overline{w}}{\partial z}.&lt;/math&gt;

although the theoretical justification for doing so is weaker, as the [[pressure gradient force]] can significantly alter the fluctuating components. Moreover, for the case of vertical velocity, &lt;math&gt;\ w'&lt;/math&gt; must be in a neutrally stratified fluid.

Taking the product of horizontal and vertical fluctuations gives us:

&lt;math&gt;\ \overline{u' w'} = \overline{\xi' ^2} \left | \frac{\partial \overline{w}}{\partial z}\right| \frac{\partial \overline{u}}{\partial z}&lt;/math&gt;.

The eddy viscosity is defined from the equation above as:

&lt;math&gt;\ K_m=\overline{\xi'^2} \left| \frac{\partial \overline{w}}{\partial z}\right|&lt;/math&gt;,

so we have the eddy viscosity, &lt;math&gt;\ K_m&lt;/math&gt; expressed in terms of the mixing length, &lt;math&gt;\ \xi'&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Mount Kailash'''  (also '''Kailasa'''; '''''Kangrinboqê''''' or ''Gang [[Rinpoche]]''; [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]]: གངས་རིན་པོ་ཆེ; {{lang-zh|s=冈仁波齐峰}} &lt;small&gt;([[Simplified Chinese|simplified]]);&lt;/small&gt; {{lang-zh|t=岡仁波齊峰}} &lt;small&gt;([[Traditional Chinese|traditional]])&lt;/small&gt;), is a '''6,638 m''' (21,778&amp;nbsp;ft) high peak in the [[Gangdise Shan|Kailash Range]] (Gangdisê Mountains), which forms part of the [[Transhimalaya]] in the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] of [[China]].

The mountain is located near [[Lake Manasarovar]] and [[Lake Rakshastal]], close to the [[river source|source]] of some of the [[List of the longest Asian rivers|longest Asian rivers]]: the [[Indus River|Indus]], [[Sutlej]], [[Brahmaputra River|Brahmaputra]], and Karnali also known as [[Ghaghara]] (a tributary of the [[Ganges]]) in India. Mount Kailash is considered to be sacred in four religions: [[Bon]], [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]] and [[Jainism]].

==Etymology==

The mountain is known as “''{{transl|sa|IAST|Kailāsa}}''” ({{lang|sa|कैलास}}; var. ''{{transl|sa|IAST|Kailāśa}}'' {{lang|sa|कैलाश}}) in Sanskrit.&lt;ref&gt;[[Monier-Williams]] Sanskrit Dictionary, [http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/cgi-bin/monier/serveimg.pl?file=/scans/MWScan/MWScanjpg/mw0311-kesaragrAma.jpg page 311 column 3]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.2:1:1523.apte Entry for कैलासः] in Apte Sanskrit-English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; The name also could have been derived from the word “''{{transl|sa|IAST|kelāsa}}''” ({{lang|sa|केलास}}), which means "crystal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://faculty.washington.edu/prem/mw/k.html |title= Monier-Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary |last= Williams |first= Monier |quote= kelāsa m. crystal W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his Tibetan-English dictionary, Chandra (1902: p.&amp;nbsp;32) identifies the entry for 'kai la sha' ({{bo|w=kai la sha}}) which is a [[loan word]] from Sanskrit.&lt;ref&gt;Sarat Chandra Das (1902). ''Tibetan-English Dictionary with Sanskrit Synonyms''. Calcutta, India: Bengal Secretariat Book Depot, [https://archive.org/stream/tibetanenglishdi00dassuoft#page/32/mode/1up page 32].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Tibetan languages|Tibetan]] name for the mountain is '''Gangs Rin-po-che''' ([[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]]: གངས་རིན་པོ་ཆེ་; {{zh|s=冈仁波齐峰}}). ''Gangs'' or ''Kang'' is the Tibetan word for ''snow peak'' analogous to [[Wiktionary:alp|''alp'']] or ''hima''; ''[[rinpoche]]'' is an honorific meaning "precious one" so the combined term can be translated "precious jewel of snows". [[Alice Albinia]] lists some of the names for the mountain, and its religious significance to various faiths:

{{quote|"Tibetan Buddhists call it Kangri Rinpoche; 'Precious Snow Mountain'. [[Bon]] texts have many names: Water's Flower, Mountain of Sea Water, Nine Stacked Swastika Mountain. For Hindus, it is the home of the wild mountain god [[Shiva]] and a symbol of his penis; for [[Jains]] it is where their first leader was enlightened; for Buddhists, the navel of the universe; and for adherents of Bon, the abode of the sky goddess Sipaimen."&lt;ref name="Albinia2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alice Albinia|authorlink=Alice Albinia|title=Empires of the Indus: The Story of a River|url=https://books.google.com/?id=oOQvAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22wild+mountain+god%22|year=2008|publisher=[[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]]|isbn=9780719560033|page=288}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Another local name for the mountain is '''Tisé''' mountain, which derives from ''ti tse'' in the [[Zhang-Zhung language]], meaning "water peak" or "river peak", connoting the mountain's status as the source of the mythical Lion, Horse, Peacock and Elephant Rivers, and in fact the [[Indus]], [[Yarlung Tsangpo]]/Dihang/[[Brahmaputra]], [[Ghaghara River|Karnali]] and [[Sutlej]] all begin in the Kailash-Lake Manasarovara region.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last=Camaria|first=Pradeep|title=Kailash Manasarovara on the Rugged Road to Revelation| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ftuRYXyX9S4C&amp;lpg=PA19&amp;dq=kailash%20manasarovar%20mythical%20rivers&amp;pg=PA15#v=onepage&amp;q=kailash%20manasarovar%20mythical%20rivers&amp;f=false | publisher=Abhinav | location=New Delhi | year=1996 | accessdate = 11 June 2010|isbn=9788170173366}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious significance==

===In Hinduism===
{{Saivism}}

[[Image:Hindukailash.JPG|thumb|left|An illustration depicting the Hindu holy family of Shiva]]

According to [[Hinduism]], [[Shiva]] resided at the summit of a mountain named ''Kailāsh'', where he sat in a state of meditation along with his wife [[Pārvatī]]. 

According to [[Charles Allen (writer)|Charles Allen]], one description in the [[Vishnu Purana]] of the mountain states that its four faces are made of [[crystal]], [[ruby]], [[gold]], and [[lapis lazuli]].&lt;ref name=allen/&gt; It is a pillar of the world and is located at the heart of six mountain ranges symbolizing a lotus.&lt;ref name=allen&gt;[[Charles Allen (writer)|Allen, Charles]].

===In Jainism===
[[File:Photo of lord adinath bhagwan at kundalpur.JPG|thumb|left|[[Rishabhanatha|Rishabhadeva]] attained [[nirvana]] near Mount Kailash]]
According to Jain scriptures, Ashtapada, the mountain next to Mt. Kailash, is the site where the first Jain [[Tirthankara]], [[Rishabhanatha|Rishabhadeva]], attained [[Moksha (Jainism)|moksha]] (liberation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-09-21/spiritual-destinations/29739255_1_manasarovar-water-moon |title=To heaven and back – Times Of India |publisher=Articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com |date=2012-01-11 |accessdate=2012-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Jain tradition, it is believed that after [[Rishabhanatha|Rishabhdeva]] attained nirvana, his son emperor [[Bharata Chakravartin]] had constructed three stupas and twenty four shrines of the 24 tirthankaras over there with their idols studded with precious stones and named it ''Sinhnishdha''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=y4aVRLGhf-8C&amp;pg=RA1-PA273&amp;dq=mount+Kailash+jainism#v=onepage&amp;q=mount%20Kailash%20jainism&amp;f=false | title=Faith &amp; Philosophy of Jainism| isbn=9788178357232| last1=Jain| first1=Arun Kumar| year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Jain tradition the 24th and last Tirthankara, [[Mahavira|Vardhamana Mahavira]] was taken to the summit of Kailash by [[Indra]] shortly after his birth, after putting his mother [[Trishala|Queen Trishala]] into deep slumber. There he was bathed and anointed with precious unctions.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.in/books?id=MEvZaVmBQtgC&amp;pg=PA71&amp;dq=mahavira+mount+meru&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiikN261IPfAhUMu48KHWhsBHgQ6AEIJTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=mahavira%20mount%20meru&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://sites.fas.harvard.edu/~pluralsm/affiliates/jainism/ritual/shantikalash.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Buddhism===
[[Image:KailashTanka.JPG|thumb|left|Tibetan and Nepalese [[Thangka]] depicting Mount Kailash]]
Mount Kailash (Kailasa) is known as Mount Meru in Buddhist texts. It is central to its cosmology, and a major pilgrimage site for some Buddhist traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert E. Buswell|title=Encyclopedia of Buddhism: A-L|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L34YAAAAIAAJ|year=2004|publisher=Macmillan Reference |isbn=978-0-02-865719-6|pages=407–408}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vajrayana]] Buddhists believe that Mount Kailash is the home of the [[buddhahood|buddha]] [[Cakrasaṃvara Tantra|Cakrasaṃvara]] (also known as Demchok),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.khandro.net/deity_Chakrasamvara.htm |title=Heruka Chakrasamvara |publisher=Khandro.net |date= |accessdate=2012-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; who represents supreme bliss.

There are numerous sites in the region associated with [[Padmasambhava]], whose [[tantra|tantric practices]] in holy sites around Tibet are credited with finally establishing Buddhism as the main religion of the country in the 7th–8th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;''The Sacred Mountain'', pp. 39, 33, 35, 225, 280, 353, 362–363, 377–378&lt;/ref&gt;

It is said that [[Milarepa]] (c. 1052 – c. 1135), champion of Vajrayana, arrived in Tibet to challenge Naro Bön-chung, champion of the [[Bön]] religion of Tibet. The two magicians engaged in a terrifying sorcerers' battle, but neither was able to gain a decisive advantage. Finally, it was agreed that whoever could reach the summit of Kailash most rapidly would be the victor. While Naro Bön-chung sat on a magic [[drum]] and soared up the slope, Milarepa's followers were dumbfounded to see him sitting still and meditating. Yet when Naro Bön-chung was nearly at the top, Milarepa suddenly moved into action and overtook him by riding on [[sunlight]], thus winning the contest. He did, however, fling a handful of snow on to the top of a nearby mountain, since known as Bönri, bequeathing it to the Bönpo and thereby ensuring continued Bönpo connections with the region.&lt;ref&gt;''The Sacred Mountain'', pp. 31, 33, 35&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The World's Most Mysterious Places Published by Reader's Digest {{ISBN|0-276-42217-1}} pg.85&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Sacred Mountain'', pp. 25–26&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In Bön ===
[[Bön]], a religion native to Tibet, maintain that the entire mystical region and Kailash, which they call the "nine-story [[Swastika]] Mountain", is the [[axis mundi]], [[Tagzig Olmo Lung Ring]].

==Pilgrimage==
[[File:Jains at Kailash.jpg|thumb|[[Jain]] pilgrims paying obeisance to Tirthankar [[Rishabhdev]]a.]]
Every year, thousands make a pilgrimage to Kailash, following a tradition going back thousands of years. [[Pilgrim]]s of several religions believe that circumambulating Mount Kailash on foot is a holy ritual that will bring good fortune. The peregrination is made in a clockwise direction by Hindus and Buddhists, while Jains and Bönpos circumambulate the mountain in a counterclockwise direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://explorechinatibet.com/tour-tag/kailash-manasarovar-tours/|title=Mt Kailash and Lake Manasarovar pilgrim tour in 2018 - Explore China Tibet Travel|website=Tibet &amp; China Travel Services by Locals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The path around Mount Kailash is {{convert|52|km|mi|abbr=on}} long. Some pilgrims believe that the entire walk around Kailash should be made in a single day, which is not considered an easy task. A person in good shape walking fast would take perhaps 15 hours to complete the entire trek. Some of the devout do accomplish this feat, little daunted by the uneven terrain, [[altitude sickness]] and harsh conditions faced in the process. Indeed, other pilgrims venture a much more demanding regimen, performing body-length [[prostration]]s over the entire length of the circumambulation: The pilgrim bends down, kneels, prostrates full-length, makes a mark with his fingers, rises to his knees, prays, and then crawls forward on hands and knees to the mark made by his/her fingers before repeating the process. It requires at least four weeks of physical endurance to perform the circumambulation while following this regimen. The mountain is located in a particularly remote and inhospitable area of the Tibetan Himalayas. A few modern amenities, such as benches, resting places and refreshment kiosks, exist to aid the pilgrims in their devotion. According to all religions that revere the mountain, setting foot on its slopes is a dire sin. It is a popular belief that the stairways on Mount Kailash lead to heaven.

Because of the [[Sino-Indian border dispute]], pilgrimage to the legendary abode of Shiva was stopped from 1954 to 1978. Thereafter, a limited number of Indian pilgrims have been allowed to visit the place, under the supervision of the Chinese and Indian governments either by a lengthy and hazardous trek over the Himalayan terrain, travel by land from [[Kathmandu]] or from [[Lhasa]] where flights from Kathmandu are available to Lhasa and thereafter travel over the great Tibetan plateau by car. The journey takes four night stops, finally arriving at [[Darchen]] at an elevation of {{convert|4600|m|abbr=on}}, a small outpost that swells with pilgrims at certain times of the year. Despite its minimal infrastructure, modest guest houses are available for foreign pilgrims, whereas Tibetan pilgrims generally sleep in their own tents. A small regional medical center serving far-western Tibet and funded by the Swiss Ngari Korsum Foundation was built here in 1997.

Walking around the mountain—a part of its official park—has to be done on foot, [[pony]] or [[domestic yak]], and takes some three days of trekking starting from a height of around {{convert|15000|ft|abbr=on}} past the Tarboche (flagpole) to cross the Drölma pass {{convert|18200|ft|abbr=on}}, and encamping for two nights en route. First, near the meadow of Dirapuk [[gompa]], some {{convert|2|to|3|km|abbr=on}} before the pass and second, after crossing the pass and going downhill as far as possible (viewing [[Gauri Kund]] in the distance).

[[Image:Mt Kailash sat.jpg|thumb|Satellite view of Mount Kailash with lakes [[Lake Rakshastal|Rakshastal]] (left) and [[Lake Manasarovar|Manasarovar]] (right)]]

The region around Mount Kailash and the Indus headwaters area is typified by wide scale [[faulting]] of  [[metamorphosed]] late [[Cretaceous]] to mid [[Cenozoic]] [[sedimentary rocks]] which have been [[intruded]] by [[Igneous rock|igneous]]  Cenozoic [[granitic]] rocks. Mt. Kailash appears to be a [[metasedimentary]] [[roof pendant]] supported by a massive [[granite]] base. The [[Cenozoic]] rocks represent offshore marine [[limestone]]s deposited before [[subduction]] of the [[Tethys Ocean|Tethys oceanic]] [[Crust (geology)|crust]]. These sediments were deposited on the southern margin of the Asia block during subduction of the Tethys oceanic crust  prior to the [[Indian Plate|collision between the Indian and Asian continents]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shangri-la-river-expeditions.com/wchinageo/indushwgeo/kailash&amp;indushwgeo.html Geology and Geography of the Mt.

==Mountaineering==
[[File:2005 Kailash with moon Tibet.jpg|thumb|upright|North View of Mount Kailash]]

Mount Everest is 8848 metre (29029&amp;nbsp;ft) in height and its summit has been scaled by over 4,000 people, while Mount Kailash is 6638 metre (21778&amp;nbsp;ft) and its summit is unclimbed.

In 1926, [[Hugh Ruttledge]] studied the north face, which he estimated was 6,000&amp;nbsp;ft (1,800 m) high and "utterly unclimbable"&lt;ref&gt;''The Sacred Mountain'', p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; and thought about an ascent of the northeast ridge, but he ran out of time. Ruttledge had been exploring the area with Colonel R. C. Wilson, who was on the other side of the mountain with his Sherpa named Tseten. According to Wilson, Tseten told Wilson, "'Sahib, we can climb that!' ... as he too saw that this [the SE ridge] represented a feasible route to the summit."&lt;ref&gt;''The Sacred Mountain'', p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; Further excerpts from Wilson's article in the ''[[Alpine Journal]]'' (vol. 40, 1928) show that he was serious about climbing Kailash, but Colonel Wilson, ''“Just when I discovered an easy walk to the summit of the mountain, heavy snow began to fall, making the ascent impossible.”''. [[Herbert Tichy]] was in the area in 1936, attempting to climb [[Gurla Mandhata]]. When he asked one of the Garpons of Ngari whether Kailash was climbable, the Garpon replied, "Only a man entirely free of sin could climb Kailash. And he wouldn't have to actually scale the sheer walls of ice to do it – he'd just turn himself into a bird and fly to the summit."&lt;ref&gt;''The Sacred Mountain'', p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reinhold Messner]] was given the opportunity by the Chinese government to climb in the mid-1980s but he declined.&lt;ref name="tew.org"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.tew.org/archived/kailash.ban.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718190919/http://www.tew.org/archived/kailash.ban.html|archivedate=18 July 2011|title=China to Ban Expeditions on Mt Kailash|publisher=tew.org|accessdate=16 September 2016 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, reports emerged that the Chinese had given permission for a Spanish team to climb the peak, which caused an international backlash. Chinese authorities disputed the reports, and stated that any climbing activities on Mt Kailash were strictly prohibited.&lt;ref name="tew.org"/&gt; Reinhold Messner, who condemned the reported Spanish plans, said: {{cquote|If we conquer this mountain, then we conquer something in people's souls. I would suggest they go and climb something a little harder. Kailas is not so high and not so hard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tew.org/archived/kailash.story.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427191621/http://www.tew.org/archived/kailash.story.html|archivedate=27 April 2011|title=Scaling a Mountain to Destroy The Holy Soul of Tibetans|publisher=tew.org|accessdate=18 September 2016|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The '''neck''', '''nicor''', '''nixie''' or '''nokken''' ({{lang-de|[[wikt:Nixe|Nixe]]}}; {{lang-nl|[[wikt:nikker|nikker]]}}, {{lang|nl|[[wikt:nekker|nekker]]}}; [[Danish language|Danish]]: ''nøkke;'' {{lang-no|[[wikt:nøkk|nøkk]]}}; {{lang-sv|[[wikt:näck|näck]]}}; {{lang-fi|[[wikt:näkki|näkki]]}}; {{lang-et|[[wikt:näkk|näkk]]}}) are [[shapeshifting]] water spirits in [[Germanic mythology]] and [[Germanic folklore|folklore]] who usually appeared in forms of other creatures.

Under a [[#Names|variety of names]], they were common to the stories of all [[Germanic peoples]],&lt;ref name="nordisknäck"&gt;The article ''Näcken'', [http://runeberg.org/nfbt/0177.html tome 20, p. 317], in {{lang|no|[[Nordisk familjebok]]}} (1914)&lt;/ref&gt; although they are perhaps best known from [[Scandinavian folklore]]. The related English ''[[knucker]]'' was generally depicted as a [[European dragon|wyrm]] or [[European dragon|dragon]], although more recent versions depict the spirits in other forms. Their sex, bynames, and various transformations vary geographically. The German '''{{lang|de|Nix}}''' and his Scandinavian counterparts were males. The German {{lang|de|Nixe}} was a female river [[mermaid]].&lt;ref name="nordisknäck"/&gt;

[[File:Kittelsen - Nøkken (Nasjonalmuseet)2.jpg|thumb|In Norway, [[Theodor Kittelsen]]'s {{lang|no|Nøkken}} from 1904 is equally famous.]]
The names are held to derive from [[Proto-Germanic|Common Germanic]] ''*nikwus'' or ''*nikwis(i)'', derived from [[Proto-Indo-European language|PIE]] ''{{PIE|*neig&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;}}'' ("to wash").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.koeblergerhard.de/germanistischewoerterbuecher/indogermanischeswoerterbuch/idgN.pdf |last=Köbler |first=Gerhard |title=Indogermanisches Wörterbuch |format=PDF |accessdate=26 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112220846/http://www.koeblergerhard.de/germanistischewoerterbuecher/indogermanischeswoerterbuch/idgN.pdf |archivedate=12 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are related to [[Sanskrit]] {{lang|sa-Latn|nḗnēkti}}, Greek {{lang|grc|νίζω }} {{lang|grc-Latn|nízō}} and {{lang|grc|νίπτω }} {{lang|grc-Latn|níptō}}, and [[Irish language|Irish]] {{lang|ga|nigh}} (all meaning to wash or be washed).&lt;ref name="hellquist"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://runeberg.org/svetym/0620.html |title=Svensk etymologisk ordbok |first1=Elof |last1=Hellquist |year=1922 |location=Lund |publisher=C.

Gleerups förlag Berlingska boktryckeriet |page=532 |accessdate=26 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The form ''neck'' appears in English and Swedish ({{lang|sv|näck}} or {{lang|sv|nek}}, meaning "nude").&lt;ref name="hellquist"/&gt; The Swedish form is derived from Old Swedish {{lang|non|neker}}, which corresponds to Old Icelandic {{lang|non|nykr}} ({{abbr|gen.|genitive}} {{lang|non|nykrs}}), and {{lang|nn|nykk}} in [[Nynorsk|Norwegian Nynorsk]].&lt;ref name="hellquist"/&gt; In Finnish, the word is {{lang|fi|[[näkki]]}}. In Old Danish, the form was {{lang|non|nikke}} and in modern Danish and Norwegian [[Bokmål]] it is {{lang|da|nøkk}}.&lt;ref name="hellquist"/&gt; The Icelandic and Faroese {{lang|is|nykur}} are horselike creatures. In [[Middle Low German]], it was called {{lang|gml|necker}} and in [[Middle Dutch]] {{lang|dum|nicker}} (compare also {{lang|gmh|Nickel}} or {{lang|gmh|Nikkel}} plus {{lang|gmh|Kobolt}}) .&lt;ref name="hellquist"/&gt; The [[Old High German]] form {{lang|goh|nihhus}} also meant "crocodile",&lt;ref name="nordisknäck"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hellquist"/&gt; while the [[Old English]] {{lang|ang|nicor}}&lt;ref name="nordisknäck"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hellquist"/&gt; could mean both a "water monster" like those encountered by [[Beowulf]],&lt;ref name="Kemble1837"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kemble |first=John Mitchell |title=Beowulf: A Translation of the Anglo-Saxon Poem of Beowulf |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DqIYAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PR17 |year=1837 |pages=17– }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a "hippopotamus".&lt;ref name="hellquist"/&gt; The Norwegian {{lang|no|[[Fossegrim]]}} and Swedish {{lang|sv|Strömkarlen}} are related figures sometimes seen as by-names for the same creature.&lt;ref name="hellquist"/&gt; The southern Scandinavian version can transform himself into a horse-like ''[[kelpie]]'', and is called a {{lang|sv|Bäckahästen}} (the "brook horse"), whilst the Welsh version is called the {{lang|cy|[[Ceffyl Dŵr]]}} (the "water horse").

==England==
English folklore contains many creatures with similar characteristics to the ''Nix'' or {{lang|sv|Näck}}. These include [[Jenny Greenteeth]], the [[Shellycoat]], the river-hag [[Peg Powler]], the {{lang|sv|Bäckahäst}}-like [[Brag (folklore)|Brag]], and the [[Grindylow]].

At [[Lyminster]] near Arundel in the English county of [[Sussex]], there are today said to dwell "water-wyrms" called [[knucker]]s, in a pool called the ''Knucker-hole''. The great Victorian authority Skeat had plausibly suggested the pool's name of ''knucker'' (a name attested from 1835, Horsfield)&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Walker Horsfield, ''The History, Antiquities, and Topography of the County of Sussex'', Volume 2, 1835.&lt;/ref&gt; was likely derived from the [[Old English]] {{lang|ang|nicor}}, a creature-name found in ''Beowulf''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.prestel.co.uk/aspen/sussex/dragon.html Dragons &amp; Serpents In Sussex] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405144710/http://www2.prestel.co.uk/aspen/sussex/dragon.html |date=5 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. Yet the waters at the pool were badly muddied by a local antiquarian named Samuel Evershed, who from 1866 tried assiduously to connect the pool with dragons and thus with the tale of [[St. George and the Dragon]]. Any authentic water-sprite folklore the site may originally have had was thus trampled down by Evershed's enthusiastic inculcation of the local people in ideas about water-dragons.

==Scandinavia==

===Näck, Nøkk===
[[File:Näckens polska.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Näckens polska'' by [[Bror Hjorth]]]]
The Scandinavian ''näcken'', ''näkki'', ''nøkk'' were male water spirits who played enchanted songs on the violin, luring women and children to [[drown]] in lakes or streams.  However, not all of these spirits were necessarily malevolent; many stories indicate at the very least that nøkker were entirely harmless to their audience and attracted not only women and children, but men as well with their sweet songs.  Stories also exist wherein the Fossegrim agreed to live with a human who had fallen in love with him, but many of these stories ended with the nøkk returning to his home, usually a nearby waterfall or brook. (Compare the legend of [[Llyn y Fan Fach]] in Wales.) The nøkker were said to grow despondent unless they had free, regular contact with a water source.

The Norwegian [[Fossegrim]] or ''Grim'', Swedish ''strömkarl'',&lt;ref&gt;Or strömkarl (singular), per Grimm 1835:17:11.&lt;/ref&gt; is a related figure who, if properly approached, will teach a musician to play so adeptly "that the trees dance and waterfalls stop at his music".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/celt/tfm/tfm056.htm |title=The Fairy Mythology: Scandinavia : The Power of the Harp |publisher=Sacred-texts.com |accessdate=26 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is difficult to describe the appearance of the nix, as one of his central attributes was thought to be [[shapeshifting]]. Perhaps he did not have any true shape. He could show himself as a man playing the violin in brooks and waterfalls (though often imagined as fair and naked today, in folklore he was more frequently described as wearing more or less elegant clothing) but also could appear to be treasure or various floating objects, or as an animal—most commonly in the form of a "brook horse" (see below). The modern Scandinavian names are derived from [[Old Norse]] ''nykr'', meaning "river horse". Thus, it is likely that the figure of the brook horse preceded the personification of the nix as the "man in the rapids".  Fossegrim and derivatives were almost always portrayed as especially beautiful young men, whose clothing (or lack thereof) varied widely from story to story.

The enthralling music of the nøkk was most dangerous to women and children, especially pregnant women and [[baptism|unbaptised]] children.  He was thought to be most active during [[Midsummer's Night]], on Christmas Eve, and on Thursdays.  However, these superstitions do not necessarily relate to all the versions listed here. Many,  if not all of them, developed after the Christianizing of the northern countries, as was the case of similar stories of faeries and other entities in other areas.

[[File:Ernst Josephson-Näcken.jpg|thumb|upright|''Näcken'' ("The Water Sprite") by [[Ernst Josephson]], 1884]]

When malicious nøkker attempted to carry off people, they could be defeated by calling their name; this was believed to cause their death.&lt;ref&gt;Francis James Child, ''The English and Scottish Popular Ballads'', v 1, p 95-6, Dover Publications, New York 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another belief was that if a person bought the nøkk a treat of three drops of blood, a black animal, some "brännvin" (Scandinavian [[vodka]]) or [[snus]] (wet snuff) dropped into the water, he would teach his enchanting form of music.

The nøkk was also an omen for drowning accidents. He would scream at a particular spot in a lake or river, in a way reminiscent of the [[loon]], and on that spot, a fatality would later take place. He was also said to cause drownings, but swimmers could protect themselves against such a fate by throwing a bit of steel into the water.&lt;ref name="phantoms" /&gt;

In the later Romantic folklore and folklore-inspired stories of the 19th century, the nøkk sings about his loneliness and his longing for salvation, which he purportedly never shall receive, as he is not "a child of God". In a poem by Swedish poet [[Erik Johan Stagnelius|E. J. Stagnelius]], a little boy pities the fate of the nøkk, and so saves his own life. In the poem, arguably Stagnelius' most famous, the boy says that the Näck (nøkk) will never be a "child of God" which brings "tears to his face" as he "never plays again in the silvery brook". 

On a similar theme, a 19th-century text called "Brother Fabian's Manuscript" by [[Sebastian Evans]] has this verse:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Where by the marishes boometh the [[bittern]],
Neckar the soulless one sits with his ghittern.
Sits inconsolable, friendless and foeless.
Waiting his destiny, - Neckar the soulless.&lt;ref name="phantoms"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/stream/cu31924079619411/cu31924079619411_djvu.txt |title=Phantoms of the Deep, or : Legends and Superstitions of the Sea and of Sailors |accessdate=3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

(The source has "bloometh" for "boometh", but this is clearly an error; a bittern is not a plant, but a bird, and it is known for its booming call. A "ghittern" is a guitar. The spelling "Nickar" ''vice'' "Neckar" is sometimes used.)

In Scandinavia, [[Nymphaea alba|water lilies]] are called "nix roses" (''näckrosor/nøkkeroser''). A tale from the forest of [[Tiveden]] relates that a father promised his daughter to a nøkken who offered him great hauls of fish in a time of need; she refused and stabbed herself to death, staining the water lilies red from that time on:
{{quote|At the lake of Fagertärn, there was once a poor fisherman who had a beautiful daughter. The small lake gave little fish and the fisherman had difficulties providing for his little family. One day, as the fisherman was fishing in his little [[Dugout (boat)|dugout]] of oak, he met the Nøkken, who offered him great catches of fish on the condition that the fisherman gave him his beautiful daughter the day she was eighteen years old. The desperate fisherman agreed and promised the Nøkken his daughter. The day the girl was eighteen she went down to the shore to meet the Nøkken. The Nøkken gladly asked her to walk down to his watery abode, but the girl took forth a knife and said that he would never have her alive, then stuck the knife into her heart and fell down into the lake, dead. Then, her blood coloured the water lilies red, and from that day the water lilies of some of the lake's forests are red (Karlsson 1970:86).}}

===Bäckahäst, bækhest===
[[File:Theodor Kittelsen - Nøkken som hvit hest.jpg|thumb|The Neck as a brook horse by Theodor Kittelsen, a depiction of the Neck as a white horse]]
[[File:Gutt på hvit hest.jpg|thumb|''Gutt på hvit hest'' (Boy on white horse) by the same Kittelsen]]
[[File:Arthur Rackam Die Rheintöchter.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Rhinemaidens]] by [[Arthur Rackham]]]]

The '''bäckahäst''' or '''bækhest''' (translated as ''the brook horse'') is a [[mythology|mythological]] horse in [[Scandinavian folklore]]. It has a close parallel in the Scottish [[kelpie]], and the Welsh [[Ceffyl Dŵr]].

It was often described as a majestic white horse that would appear near rivers, particularly during foggy weather.  Anyone who climbed onto its back would not be able to get off again.  The horse would then jump into the river, drowning the rider. The brook horse could also be harnessed and made to plough, either because it was trying to trick a person or because the person had tricked the horse into it. The following tale is a good illustration of the brook horse:
{{quote|A long time ago, there was a girl who was not only pretty but also big and strong. She worked as a maid on a farm by Lake Hjärtasjön in southern [[Nerike]]. She was ploughing with the farm's horse on one of the fields by the lake. It was springtime and beautiful weather. The birds chirped and the [[white wagtail|wagtail]]s flitted in the tracks of the girl and the horse in order to pick worms. All of a sudden, a horse appeared out of the lake. It was big and beautiful, bright in colour and with large spots on the sides. The horse had a beautiful mane which fluttered in the wind and a tail that trailed on the ground. The horse pranced for the girl to show her how beautiful he was. The girl, however, knew that it was the brook horse and ignored it. Then the brook horse came closer and closer and finally he was so close that he could bite the farm horse in the mane. The girl hit the brook horse with the bridle and cried: "Disappear you scoundrel, or you'll have to plough so you'll never forget it." As soon as she had said this, the brook horse had changed places with the farm horse, and the brook horse started ploughing the field with such speed that soil and stones whirled in its wake, and the girl hung like a mitten from the plough. Faster than the cock crows seven times, the ploughing was finished and the brook horse headed for the lake, dragging both the plough and the girl. But the girl had a piece of [[Iron in mythology|steel]] in her pocket, and she made the [[sign of the cross]].  Immediately she fell down on the ground, and she saw the brook horse disappear into the lake with the plough. She heard a frustrated neighing when the brook horse understood that his trick had failed. Until this day, a deep track can be seen in the field. (Hellström 1985:16)}}

==Germany==
The German ''Nix'' and ''Nixe'' (and ''Nixie'') are types of river [[merman]] and [[mermaid]] who may lure men to drown, like the Scandinavian type, akin to the Celtic [[Melusine]] and similar to the Greek [[Siren (mythology)|Siren]]. The German epic ''[[Nibelungenlied]]'' mentions the Nix in connection with the [[Danube]], as early as 1180 to 1210.

Nixes in folklore became [[Sprite (creature)|water sprites]]&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Grimm 1835:17:11.&lt;/ref&gt; who try to lure people into the water. The males can assume many different shapes, including that of a human, fish, and snake. The females bear the tail of a fish. When they are in human forms, they can be recognised by the wet hem of their clothes. The Nixes are portrayed as malicious in some stories but harmless and friendly in others.

By the 19th century [[Jacob Grimm]] mentions the Nixie to be among the "[[Sprite (creature)|water-sprites]]" who love music, song and dancing, and says "Like the sirens, the Nixie by her song draws listening youth to herself, and then into the deep."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; According to Grimm, they can appear human but have the barest hint of animal features: the nix had "a slit ear", and the Nixie "a wet skirt". Grimm thinks these could symbolise they are "higher beings" who could [[Shapeshifting|shapeshift]] to animal form.&lt;ref&gt;Grimm 1835:33:2.&lt;/ref&gt;

One famous Nixe of recent [[German folklore]], deriving from 19th-century literature, was [[Lorelei]]; according to the legend, she sat on the rock at the [[Rhine]] which now bears her name, and lured fishermen and boatmen to the dangers of the reefs with the sound of her voice. In Switzerland there is a legend (myth) of a sea-maid or Nixe that lived in [[Lake Zug]] (the lake is in the Canton of Zug).

''[[The Yellow Fairy Book]]'' by [[Andrew Lang]] includes a story called "[[The Nixie of the Mill-Pond]]" in which a malevolent spirit that lives in a mill pond strikes a deal with the miller that she will restore his wealth in exchange for his son. This story is taken from the Tales of Grimm.

The legend of [[Heer Halewijn]], a dangerous lord who lures women to their deaths with a magic song, may have originated with the Nix.

{{See also|Lorelei}}
{{See also|Wagner's Rhinemaidens}}
Alternate names (kennings) for the female German Nixe are Rhine maidens ({{lang-de|link=no|Rheintöchter}}) and [[Lorelei]].

In a fictional depiction, the '''Rhine maidens''' are among the [[protagonist]]s in the four-part Opera ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'' by the composer [[Richard Wagner]], based loosely on the nix of the ''Nibelungenlied''.

The Rhine maidens [[Wellgunde]], [[Woglinde]], and [[Floßhilde]] ([[Flosshilde]]) belong to a group of characters living in a part of nature free from human influence.  [[Jörð|Erda]] and the [[Norns]] are also considered a part of this 'hidden' world.

They are first seen in the first work of the Nibelungen cycle, ''[[Das Rheingold]]'', as guardians of the ''Rheingold'', a treasure of gold hidden in the [[Rhine|Rhein]] river.  The dwarf [[Alberich]], a [[Nibelung]], is eager to win their favour, but they somewhat cruelly dismiss his flattery.  They tell him that only one who is unable to love can win the ''Rheingold''.  Thus, Alberich curses love and steals the ''Rheingold''.  From the stolen gold he forges a [[Ring (jewellery)|ring]] of power. Further on in the cycle, the Rhine maidens are seen trying to regain the ring and transform it back into the harmless ''Rheingold''. But no one will return the ring to them; not even the supreme god [[Odin|Wotan]], who uses the ring to pay the giants Fasolt and Fafner for building [[Valhalla]], nor the hero [[Sigurd|Siegfried]], when the maidens appear to him in the third act of ''[[Götterdämmerung]]''. Eventually [[Brynhildr|Brünnhilde]] returns it to them at the end of the cycle, when the fires of her funeral pyre cleanse the ring of its curse.

Descendants of German immigrants to Pennsylvania sometimes refer to a mischievous child as being "nixie".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26733">'''Nuclear marine propulsion''' is [[Marine propulsion|propulsion of a ship]] or submarine with heat provided by a [[nuclear reactor|nuclear power plant]]. The power plant heats water to produce steam for a turbine used to turn the ship's propeller through a gearbox or through an electric generator and motor. Naval nuclear propulsion is used specifically within naval warships such as [[supercarrier]]s (see ''[[nuclear navy]]''). A small number of experimental civil nuclear ships have been built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John G |last=Wirt |chapter=A Federal Demonstration Project: N.S. Savannah |title=Innovation in the maritime industry |volume=1 |location= |publisher=National Academies, for Maritime Transportation Research Board, National Research Council (US) |year=1979 |pages=29–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to oil or coal fuelled ships, nuclear propulsion offers the advantages of very long intervals of operation before refueling. All the fuel is contained within the nuclear reactor, so no cargo or supplies space is taken up by fuel, nor is space taken up by exhaust stacks or combustion air intakes. However, the low fuel cost is offset by the high operating costs and investment in infrastructure, so nearly all nuclear-powered vessels are military ones.

[[File:50 Let Pobedy.jpg|thumb|right|When the nuclear-powered {{sclass-|Arktika|icebreaker|4}} {{ship|NS|50 Let Pobedy}} was put into service in 2007, it became the world's largest icebreaker.]]

==Power plants==

===Basic operation of naval ship or submarine===

Naval reactors are of the [[Pressurized water reactor|pressurized water]] type. A primary water circuit transfers heat generated from [[nuclear fission]] in the fuel to a [[steam generator]]; this water is kept under pressure so it does not boil. This circuit operates at a temperature of around  {{convert|250|to|300|C}}.  Any radioactive contamination in the primary water is confined.  Water is circulated by pumps; at lower power levels, reactors designed for submarines may rely on natural circulation of the water to reduce noise generated by the pumps.

The hot water from the reactor heats a separate water circuit in the steam generator.  The water turns to steam and passes through [[steam dryer|steam driers]] on its way to the [[steam turbine]]. Spent steam at low pressure is run through a [[condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]] cooled by seawater and returns to liquid form.  The water is pumped back to the steam generator and continues the cycle. Any water lost in the process can be made up by [[Desalination|desalinated]] sea water added to the steam generator feed water.&lt;ref&gt;Viren Chopra, Rob Houston (ed), ''DK Eyewitness Books: Transportation'', Penguin, 2012, {{ISBN|1465408894}}  page 60&lt;/ref&gt;

In the turbine, the steam expands and reduces its pressure as it imparts energy to the rotating blades of the turbine.  There may be many stages of rotating blades and fixed guide vanes.  The output shaft of the turbine may be connected to a gearbox to reduce rotation speed, then a shaft connects to the vessel's propellers. In another form of drive system, the turbine turns an electrical generator, and the electric power produces is fed to one or more drive motors for the vessel's propellers. The [[Russian Navy|Russian]], [[United States Navy|US]] and [[Royal Navy|British]] navies rely on  direct steam turbine propulsion, while the French and Chinese ships use the turbine to generate electricity for propulsion ([[turbo-electric transmission]]).

Most nuclear submarines have a single reactor, but Russian submarines have two, and so had {{USS|Triton|SSRN-586|6}}. Most American aircraft carriers are powered by two reactors, but {{USS|Enterprise|CVN-65|6}} had eight. The majority of marine [[Nuclear reactor|reactors]] are of the [[Pressurized water reactor|pressurized water]] type, although the US and Soviet navies have designed warships powered with [[liquid metal cooled reactor]]s.

===Differences from land power plants===
Marine-type reactors differ from land-based commercial electric power reactors in several respects.

While land-based reactors in nuclear power plants produce up to around 1600 megawatts of electrical power, a typical marine propulsion reactor produces no more than a few hundred megawatts. Space considerations dictate that a marine reactor must be physically small, so it must generate higher power per unit of space. This means its components are subject to greater stresses than those of a land-based reactor. Its mechanical systems must operate flawlessly under the adverse conditions encountered at sea, including vibration and the pitching and rolling of a ship operating in rough seas. Reactor shutdown mechanisms cannot rely on gravity to drop control rods into place as in a land-based reactor that always remains upright. Salt water corrosion is an additional problem that complicates maintenance.

[[File:Nuclear fuel element.jpg|thumb|A nuclear fuel element for the cargo ship {{ship|NS|Savannah}}. The element contains four bundles of 41 fuel rods. The uranium oxide is enriched to 4.2 and 4.6 percent U-235]]

As the core of a seagoing reactor is much smaller than a power reactor, the probability of a neutron intersecting with a fissionable nucleus before it escapes into the shielding is much lower. As such, the fuel is typically more highly enriched (i.e., contains a higher concentration of &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U vs. &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U) than that used in a land-based nuclear power plant, which increases the probability of fission to the level where a sustained reaction can occur. Some marine reactors run on relatively low-enriched [[uranium]] which requires more frequent refueling. Others run on [[highly enriched uranium]], varying from 20% &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U, to the over 96% &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U found in U.S. [[submarine]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nti.org/e_research/e3_74.html |title=Global Submarine Proliferation: Emerging Trends and Problems |first=James Clay |last=Moltz |publisher=[[NTI]] |date=March 2006 |accessdate=2007-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the resulting smaller core is quieter in operation (a big advantage to a submarine).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.armscontrolwonk.com/1738/silence-is-highly-enriched-uranium |title=Silence is highly enriched uranium |date=December 13, 2007 |first=James |last=Acton |accessdate=2007-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using more-highly enriched fuel also increases the reactor's power density and extends the usable life of the nuclear fuel load, but is more expensive and a greater risk to nuclear proliferation than less-highly enriched fuel.&lt;ref name="ANTIENRICHED"&gt;{{cite web |title=Ending the Production of Highly Enriched Uranium for Naval Reactors |work=James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies |url= http://cns.miis.edu/npr/pdfs/81mahip.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=September 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A marine nuclear propulsion plant must be designed to be highly reliable and self-sufficient, requiring minimal maintenance and repairs, which might have to be undertaken many thousands of miles from its home port. One of the technical difficulties in designing fuel elements for a seagoing nuclear reactor is the creation of fuel elements which will withstand a large amount of radiation damage. Fuel elements may crack over time and gas bubbles may form. The fuel used in marine reactors is a metal-[[zirconium]] alloy rather than the ceramic UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ([[uranium dioxide]]) often used in land-based reactors. Marine reactors are designed for long core life, enabled by the relatively high enrichment of the uranium and by incorporating a "burnable [[Nuclear poison|poison]]" in the fuel elements, which is slowly depleted as the fuel elements age and become less reactive. The gradual dissipation of the "nuclear poison" increases the reactivity of the core to compensate for the lessening reactivity of the aging fuel elements, thereby lengthening the usable life of the fuel. The life of the compact [[Reactor vessel|reactor pressure vessel]] is extended by providing an internal [[neutron]] shield, which reduces the damage to the steel from constant bombardment by neutrons.

In December 2017 the UK government is expected to announce up to £100m funding to support the development of small land based nuclear power plants in effort to make the UK a leader in this technology and provide fresh source of clean power.  Rolls Royce is a leading developer of nuclear power plants for submarines with power outputs in the order of 100MWe and above which would make such plants highly effective for decentralised power generation.  Since the operational environment of such land based plants would be much simpler and less restricted than in a submarine, it is expected that these units could be constructed and built much cheaper than their marine based equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/03/mini-nuclear-power-stations-uk-government-funding |title=UK government to release funding for mini nuclear power stations |date=December 3, 2017 |first= Adam |last= Vaughan |accessdate=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decommissioning==
Decommissioning nuclear-powered submarines has become a major task for US and Russian navies. After defuelling, U.S. practice is to cut the reactor section from the vessel for disposal in shallow land burial as low-level waste (see the ''[[ship-submarine recycling program]]''). In Russia, whole vessels, or sealed reactor sections, typically remain stored afloat, although a new facility near [[Sayda Bay]] is to provide storage in a concrete-floored facility on land for some submarines in the far north.

==Future designs==
Russia is well advanced with plans to build a [[Russian floating nuclear power station|floating nuclear power plant]] for their far eastern territories. The design has two 35 MWe units based on the [[KLT-40 reactor]] used in [[icebreaker]]s (with refueling every four years). Some Russian naval vessels have been used to supply electricity for domestic and industrial use in remote far eastern and Siberian towns.

[[Lloyd's Register]] is investigating the possibility of civilian nuclear marine propulsion and rewriting draft rules (see text under ''Merchant Ships'').&lt;ref name="wnnLL"&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN_Full_steam_ahead_for_nuclear_shipping_1811101.html | title = Full steam ahead for nuclear shipping | newspaper = World Nuclear News | date = 18 November 2010 | accessdate = 27 November 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hirdaris 101–130"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Hirdaris |first1 =Spyros| first2 =YF | last2 = Cheng | first3 = P | last3 = Shallcross | first4 = J | last4 = Bonafoux | first5 = D | last5 = Carlson | first6 = B | last6 = Prince | first7 = GA | last7 = Sarris|title=Considerations on the potential use of Nuclear Small Modular Reactor (SMR) technology for merchant marine propulsion|journal=Ocean Engineering|date=15 March 2014|volume=79|pages=101–130|doi=10.1016/j.oceaneng.2013.10.015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hirdaris A37-A60"&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Hirdaris | first1 = Spyros| first2 = YF | last2 = Cheng | first3 = P | last3 = Shallcross | first4 = J | last4 = Bonafoux | first5 = D | last5 = Carlson | first6 = B | last6 = Prince | first7 = GA | last7 = Sarris | title = Concept Design for a Suezmax Tanker Powered by a 70 MW Small Modular Reactor|journal=Transactions of the Royal Institution of Naval Architects, International Journal of Maritime Engineering|date=March 2014|volume=156|issue=A1|pages =A37–A60|doi= 10.3940/rina.ijme.2014.a1.276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil liability==
Insurance of nuclear vessels is not like the insurance of conventional ships. The consequences of an accident could span national boundaries, and the magnitude of possible damage is beyond the capacity of private insurers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf67.html |title=Liability for Nuclear Damage |publisher=World Nuclear Association |accessdate=March 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A special international agreement, the ''Brussels Convention on the Liability of Operators of Nuclear Ships'', developed in 1962, would have made signatory national governments liable for accidents caused by nuclear vessels under their flag&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://english.dipublico.com.ar/treaties/brussels-convention-on-the-liability-of-operators-of-nuclear-ships/ |title=Brussels Convention on the Liability of Operators of Nuclear Ships |work=International Law |publisher=Public International Law |accessdate=March 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was never ratified owing to disagreement on the inclusion of warships under the convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ola.iaea.org/OLA/documents/liability%20regime.pdf |title=? |publisher=International Atomic Energy Association |accessdate=March 17, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101217222929/http://ola.iaea.org/OLA/documents/liability%20regime.pdf |archivedate=December 17, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nuclear reactors under United States jurisdiction are insured by the provisions of the [[Price Anderson Act]].

==History==

===Military===
By 1990 there were more nuclear reactors powering ships (mostly military) than there were generating electric power in commercial power plants worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Nuclear Weapons at Sea |journal=[[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]] |date=September 1990 |pages=48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rickover]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |isbn=978-0-306-80189-1 |page=388 |last1= Groves |first1=Leslie R. |last2=Teller |first2=Edward |title=Now it can be told |year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; the design, development and production of nuclear marine propulsion plants started in the [[United States]] in the 1940s. The first prototype naval reactor was constructed and tested at the [[Naval Reactor Facility]] at the National Reactor Testing Station in Idaho (now called the [[Idaho National Laboratory]]) in 1953.

====Submarines====
{{Further|Nuclear submarine}}
The first [[nuclear submarine]], {{USS|Nautilus|SSN-571}}, put to sea in 1955 (SS was a traditional designation for US submarines, while SSN denoted the first "nuclear" submarine).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |isbn=978-0-16-059185-3 |last=Stacy |first=Susan |title=Proving the Principle: A History of the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory, 1949-1999 |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soviet Union also developed nuclear submarines. The first types developed were the Project 627, NATO designated {{sclass2-|November|submarine|4}} with two water-cooled reactors, the first of which, K-3 ''Leninskiy Komsomol'', was underway under nuclear power on July 4, 1958.

Nuclear power revolutionized the submarine, finally making it a true "underwater" vessel, rather than a "submersible" craft, which could only stay underwater for limited periods. It gave the submarine the ability to operate submerged at high speeds, comparable to those of surface vessels, for unlimited periods, dependent only on the endurance of its crew. To demonstrate this {{USS|Triton|SSRN-586|6}} was the first vessel to execute a submerged [[circumnavigation]] of the Earth ([[Operation Sandblast]]), doing so in 1960.

''Nautilus'', with a [[pressurized water reactor]] (PWR), led to the parallel development of other submarines like a unique liquid metal cooled (sodium) reactor in {{USS|Seawolf|SSN-575|6}}, or two reactors in ''Triton'', and then the {{Sclass-|Skate|submarine|2}}s, powered by single reactors, and a cruiser, {{USS|Long Beach|CGN-9|6}}, in 1961, powered by two reactors.

By 1962 the [[United States Navy]] had 26 operational nuclear submarines and another 30 under construction. Nuclear power had revolutionized the Navy. The United States shared its technology with the [[United Kingdom]], while [[France|French]], [[Soviet Union|Soviet]], [[India]]n and [[China|Chinese]] development proceeded separately.

After the ''Skate''-class vessels, US submarines were powered by a series of standardized, single-reactor designs built by [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation|Westinghouse]] and [[General Electric]]. [[Rolls-Royce plc]] built similar units for [[Royal Navy]] submarines, eventually developing a modified version of their own, the PWR-2 ([[pressurized water reactor]]).

The largest nuclear submarines ever built are the 26,500 tonne Russian {{Sclass2-|Typhoon|submarine|4}}. The smallest nuclear warships to date are the 2,700 tonne French {{sclass-|Rubis|submarine|0}} attack submarines. The US Navy operated an unarmed nuclear submarine, the [[NR-1 Deep Submergence Craft]], between 1969 and 2008, which was not a combat vessel but was the smallest nuclear powered submarine at 400 tons.

====Aircraft carriers====
[[File:USS Enterprise FS Charles de Gaulle.jpg|thumb|''Enterprise'', the world's first nuclear-powered carrier (left) with what was then the newest: French carrier {{ship|French aircraft carrier|Charles de Gaulle|R91|2}}, 16 May 2001]]

United States and France have built nuclear [[aircraft carrier]]s.

* The sole French nuclear [[aircraft carrier]] example is {{ship|French aircraft carrier|Charles de Gaulle||2}}, commissioned in 2001 (a second one is planned&lt;ref&gt;https://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2018/10/23/le-programme-du-porte-avions-qui-remplacera-le-charles-de-gaulle-est-lance_a_23569015/&lt;/ref&gt;).
* The United States Navy have a much broader experience. {{USS|Enterprise|CVN-65|6}}, in service 1962–2012, powered by eight reactor units, is still the only aircraft carrier to house more than two nuclear reactors, with each [[A2W reactor]] taking the place of one of the conventional boilers in earlier constructions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navweaps.com/index_tech/tech-028.htm |title=Speed Thrills III&amp;nbsp;— Max speed of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers |publisher=Navweaps.com |date=29 April 1999 |accessdate=20 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent US vessels include the {{sclass-|Nimitz|aircraft carrier|5}} and successor {{sclass-|Gerald R. Ford|aircraft carrier|4}}es.

====Destroyers and cruisers====
{{see also|Nuclear powered cruisers of the United States Navy}}
The [[United States Navy]] has examples of these vessels, utilising the [[D2G reactor|D2G]] and [[C1W reactor|C1W]] reactors.

===Merchant ships===
Nuclear-powered, civil merchant ships have not developed beyond a few experimental ships. The US-built {{ship|NS|Savannah}}, completed in 1962, was primarily a demonstration of civil nuclear power and was too small and expensive to operate economically as a merchant ship. The design was too much of a compromise, being neither an efficient freighter nor a viable passenger liner. The German-built {{ship||Otto Hahn|ship|2}}, a cargo ship and research facility, sailed some {{convert|650000|nmi|km}} on 126 voyages over 10 years without any technical problems.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} However, it proved too expensive to operate and was converted to diesel. The Japanese {{ship||Mutsu|nuclear ship|2}} was dogged by technical and political problems. Its reactor had significant radiation leakage and fishermen protested against the vessel's operation. All of these three ships used low-enriched uranium. ''[[Sevmorput]]'', a Soviet and later Russian [[Lighter aboard ship|LASH carrier]] with icebreaking capability, has operated successfully on the [[Northern Sea Route]] since it was commissioned in 1988. {{Asof|2012}}, it is the only nuclear-powered merchant ship in service.

Civilian nuclear ships suffer from the costs of specialized infrastructure. The Savannah was expensive to operate since it was the only vessel using its specialized nuclear shore staff and servicing facility.  A larger fleet could share fixed costs among more operating vessels, reducing operating costs.

Recently there has been renewed interest in nuclear propulsion, and some proposals have been drafted. For example, the cargo coaster&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.janleenkloosterman.nl/reports/thesis_jacobs_2007.pdf |last=Jacobs |first=JGCC |year=2007 |title=Nuclear Short Sea Shipping |publisher=Green Nuclear Energy |format=pdf |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a new design for a nuclear cargo ship.

In November 2010 British Maritime Technology and Lloyd's Register embarked upon a two-year study with US-based Hyperion Power Generation (now [[Gen4 Energy]]), and the Greek ship operator Enterprises Shipping and Trading SA to investigate the practical maritime applications for small modular reactors. The research intended to produce a concept tanker-ship design, based on a 70 MWt reactor such as Hyperion's. In response to its members' interest in nuclear propulsion, Lloyd's Register has also re-written its 'rules' for nuclear ships, which concern the integration of a reactor certified by a land-based regulator with the rest of the ship. The overall rationale of the rule-making process assumes that in contrast to the current marine industry practice where the designer/builder typically demonstrates compliance with regulatory requirements, in the future the nuclear regulators will wish to ensure that it is the operator of the nuclear plant that demonstrates safety in operation, in addition to the safety through design and construction. Nuclear ships are currently the responsibility of their own countries, but none are involved in international trade. As a result of this work in 2014 two papers on commercial nuclear marine propulsion were published by Lloyd's Register and the other members of this consortium.&lt;ref name="Hirdaris 101–130"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hirdaris A37-A60"/&gt; These publications review past and recent work in the area of marine nuclear propulsion and describe a preliminary concept design study for a {{DWT|155,000}} Suezmax tanker that is based on a conventional hull form with alternative arrangements for accommodating a 70 MWt nuclear propulsion plant delivering up to 23.5 MW shaft power at maximum continuous rating (average: 9.75 MW). The Gen4Energy power module is considered. This is a small fast-neutron reactor using lead-bismuth eutectic cooling and able to operate for ten full-power years before refueling, and in service last for a 25-year operational life of the vessel. They conclude that the concept is feasible, but further maturity of nuclear technology and the development and harmonisation of the regulatory framework would be necessary before the concept would be viable.

===Icebreakers===
{{main|Nuclear-powered icebreaker}}
Nuclear propulsion has proven both technically and economically feasible for [[nuclear-powered icebreaker]]s in the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Arctic]]. Nuclear-fuelled ships operate for years without refueling, and the vessels have powerful engines, well-suited to the task of icebreaking.

The [[Lenin (nuclear icebreaker)|Soviet icebreaker ''Lenin'']] was the world's first nuclear-powered surface vessel in 1959 and remained in service for 30 years (new reactors were fitted in 1970). It led to a series of larger icebreakers, the 23,500 [[Tonnage|ton]] {{Sclass-|Arktika|icebreaker|4}} of six vessels, launched beginning in 1975. These vessels have two reactors and are used in deep Arctic waters. [[Arktika (1972 nuclear icebreaker)|NS ''Arktika'']] was the first surface vessel to reach the [[North Pole]].

For use in shallow waters such as estuaries and rivers, shallow-draft, [[Nuclear-powered icebreaker#Taimyr class|''Taymyr''-class icebreakers]] are being built in [[Finland]] and then fitted with their single-reactor, nuclear propulsion system in [[Russia]]. They are built to conform to international safety standards for nuclear vessels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Cutler J |editor-last=Cleveland |title=Encyclopedia of Energy |volume=1 - 6 |location= |publisher=Elsevier |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-12-176480-7 |pages=336–340}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''Ozone Action Day''', which can be declared by a local municipality, country or state, is observed at certain times during the [[summer]] months, when [[weather]] conditions (such as heat, humidity, and [[air stagnation]]) run the risk of causing health problems.

Ozone Action Days, alternately called an "Ozone Alert" or a "Clean Air Alert", primarily center in the midwestern portion of the [[United States]]; particularly in well-urbanized areas such as [[Chicago]], [[Cleveland]], [[Detroit]], and [[Indianapolis]].

==Surface ozone vs. the ozone layer==

Although the [[ozone]] found at the Earth's surface is the same chemical species as that found in the [[ozone layer]], they have very different sources, atmospheric chemistry, and affect human health differently as well. The ozone layer protects people from the sun's most damaging ultraviolet rays. Because the ozone layer is located high in the atmosphere, people are not directly exposed to it.

Ground-level ozone, however, is a health hazard because people breathe it.  It is formed through a complex set of chemical reactions involving hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides and sunlight on calm summer days where the weather may also be warm and humid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/ARD-R5/naaqs/o3info.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060929230400/http://www.epa.gov/ARD-R5/naaqs/o3info.htm |date=September 29, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  High levels of ground ozone affect the breathing process and aggravate [[asthma]] in chronic sufferers.  The young, elderly, and those with lung diseases are especially susceptible.

Ozone is most likely to exceed safety limits from May through October when seasonal heat and sunlight are at their highest &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.setrpc.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=123&amp;Itemid=217 |title=SETRPC |publisher=SETRPC |date= |accessdate=2013-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, similar conditions can occur at other times of the year in specific urbanized areas; namely the [[Los Angeles]] area, which is well known for [[smog]] formation.

==Sources of ground ozone==

A major cause of the conditions is due to pollutants in the air released by heavy industry (manufacturing plants, refineries, [[coal]]-fired power plants). Therefore, Ozone Action Days occur most frequently in the Midwestern United States. In recent years, many sites have taken steps to help reduce the amount of pollutants they discharge.

Secondary sources include automotive emissions (leaky auto exhaust systems, excessive engine idling) and liberal use of household chemicals or sprays.

==Surface Ozone Limits==
In 2008, the EPA created “non-attainment areas” for ozone in which ozone levels shall not exceed the federal standard of 75 parts per billion averaged over the course of three years. The EPA put the revised ozone standard into effect on October 1, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Salley, Mark. "EPA Lowers Federal Ozone Standard; Colorado, Other States Face More Difficult Compliance." Home. Colorado Department of Public Health &amp; Environment, 2016. Web. 15 Oct. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  This means that high altitude cities will have a more difficult time meeting the new federal standards.  This is due to higher ozone concentrations (Denver-metro area) moving to areas of lower ozone concentrations (rural, mountain areas).

For example, the high altitude state of Colorado is working on reducing the overall amount of ozone throughout the state.  The Denver Metropolitan and North Front Range areas specifically have violated the national ozone standards in the last several years.  All other counties in Colorado are in compliance with the 75 ppb standard set by the EPA in 2015.  Denver is currently the 8th most polluted area due to ozone in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Finley, Bruce. "Denver Ranks 8th Most-polluted Due to Ozone Contamination of Air." The Denver Post. The Denver Post, 22 Apr. 2016. Web. 25 Oct. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2015, Denver was ranked the 13th most-polluted city in the United States.  Experts cite coal mining, population growth, and the oil and gas industries as potential reasons for the Denver metro area becoming more polluted.

==Occupational Safety and Ozone==

In order to ensure safe ozone levels in an occupational setting, federal regulations are in place in order to enforce workplace exposure limits for all working men and women.  These measures are not implemented as a response to Ozone Action Days but rather they are in place in order to reduce the levels of ozone and contribute to the overall reduction of ground ozone in the environment. 
 
===OSHA===

Congress created the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in response to the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970.  To address the issue of ozone in the work environment, OSHA set a legal airborne permissible exposure limit of 0.1 parts per million (ppm) averaged over an 8-hour work shift. 
 
===NIOSH===

The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) also provides thorough information to ensure a safe working environment by conducting research and making recommendations for the prevention of work-related disease and injury.&lt;ref&gt;(www.cdc.gov/niosh)&lt;/ref&gt;  They recommend an airborne exposure limit for ozone of 0.1ppm, which should not be exceeded at any time.
 
===ACGIH===

The American Conference of Government Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) is a member-based organization of industrial hygienists and individuals in the occupational and environmental health and safety industry.  They recommend an airborne exposure limit of 0.05ppm for heavy work, 0.08ppm for moderate work, and 0.1ppm for light work.  If work is done for less than two hours the ACGIH recommends an exposure airborne limit of 0.20pmm averaged over an 8-hour work shift.
 
It is important to note that engineering controls are the most effective way of reducing airborne exposure of ozone (unless the exposure is the result of chemical use, in which exposure can possibly be reduced by substituting a less hazardous chemical).  These controls include proper ventilation systems, proper respirators and protective clothing.

==Public Health and Ground Ozone==

===Surface Ozone as Asthma Trigger===

Millions suffer from asthma and it is one of the most common long term illnesses of children. It causes wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and coughing. If symptoms get worse, they may end up getting hospitalized. Asthma exacerbations can be triggered by many factors such as tobacco smoke, dust mites, air pollution, pets, and mold. Surface ozone is also one of them. Surface ozone is one of the most common air pollutants and causes airway irritation. It can also reduce lung function. Studies show that areas with higher ozone levels have higher doses of asthma medications and increased emergency room visits, &lt;ref&gt;Lin, Shao, et al. "Chronic exposure to ambient ozone and asthma hospital admissions among children." Environmental Health Perspectives116.12 (2008): 1725.(Shao et al., 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Differences in Health Risk After Ozone Exposure===

There are differences between groups in both the magnitude of exposure to ozone as well as the ultimate health effects from the exposure. A study of 98 communities found that community characteristics changed the health impacts of ozone exposure. A greater effect of ozone was associated with higher unemployment, increased African American populations, increased public transportation use and use of central air conditioning.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Michelle L., and [[Francesca Dominici]]. "Effect modification by community characteristics on the short-term effects of ozone exposure and mortality in 98 US communities." American journal of epidemiology 167.8 (2008): 986-997.&lt;/ref&gt; This could be due to increased exposure in these communities or other underlying health disparities that are exacerbated by the exposure to ozone.

This differential effect of ozone on health holds true for asthma and ozone exposure as well. In a longitudinal, prospective study, men who were exposed to a 27 parts per billion increase were found to have a 2-fold increase in asthma diagnosis. Although this trend was not found for women, the size of this ozone effect was not diminished when the researchers considered other air pollutants such as (PM10, SO4, NO2, and SO2).&lt;ref&gt;McDonnell, William F., et al. "Long-term ambient ozone concentration and the incidence of asthma in nonsmoking adults: the AHSMOG Study."Environmental Research 80.2 (1999): 110-121.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, it was found that after ozone levels equaled or exceeded 0.11 ppm, there was a 37% increase in hospital visits for asthma for African American families in low income areas.&lt;ref&gt;White, Mary C., et al. "Exacerbations of childhood asthma and ozone pollution in Atlanta."Environmental Research 65.1 (1994): 56-68.&lt;/ref&gt;  These gender, socioeconomic status and race differences need to be investigated further and solidify ozone exposure as a public health problem to be solved in the coming years.

=== Legalities of States Exceeding EPA Ozone Limits ===
Colorado is working on reducing the overall amount of ozone throughout the state.  The Denver Metropolitan and North Front Range areas specifically have violated the national ozone standards in the last several years.  All other counties in Colorado are in compliance with the 75 ppb standard set by the EPA in 2015.  Denver is currently the 8th most polluted area due to ozone in the United States (Finley, 2016).  In 2015, Denver was ranked the 13th most-polluted city in the United States.  Experts cite coal mining, population growth, and the oil and gas industries as potential reasons for the Denver metro area becoming more polluted.

In 2008, the EPA created “nonattainment areas” for ozone in which ozone levels shall not exceed the federal standard of 75 parts per billion averaged over the course of three years.

The EPA put the revised ozone standard into effect on October 1, 2015 (Salley, 2015).  This means that high altitude cities will have a more difficult time meeting the new federal standards.  This is due to higher ozone concentrations (Denver-metro area) moving to areas of lower ozone concentrations (rural, mountain areas).

==Notification==

State, county, and even local governments can announce Ozone Action Days as much as a day in advance through the monitoring of approaching weather conditions and the [[Air Quality Index]] (AQI).  The AQI is divided into six levels: the higher the number (on a 0-300 scale), the more severe the ozone threat [[Air quality index]].

AQI of greater than 101 is considered dangerous for people with asthma, and asthma sufferers can take necessary precautions to avoid attacks. An AQI above 150 is considered unhealthy for all populations. They may check the current air quality index at [[www.airnow.gov]] for the most up to date information.

==What can be done==

Heavy industries make up a high percentage of pollutants causing ground ozone.  Without drastically altering or eliminating industrial production in an area altogether, air quality improvements are very slight, though noticeable.  Non-industrial pollutants, while not thought of to be a major pollutant group, can be more controlled with more positive change occurring.

Basic steps in limiting ground ozone during Ozone Action Days are:

* Controlling of [[auto emissions]]
** Eliminate excessive engine idling
*** Avoid rush hour when slowdowns on roads are most common
*** Park and go inside instead of drive-thru lines at school, fast-food restaurants, and pharmacies
** Ensure the vehicle is functioning properly
*** This includes maintaining the exhaust system, proper air pressure in tires, and oil changes
** Avoid unnecessary driving by combining trips and carpooling
** Refuel after 6:00 pm (or after dusk)
*** Do not ‘top off’; stop fueling once the nozzle has stopped the first time
** Take public transportation (some cities provide free or discounted public transportation on Ozone Action Days).
*** Kansas City (http://www.kcata.org/about_kcata/entries/ozone_alert)
*** Oklahoma City (http://embarkok.com/tools/frequently-asked-questions)
*** New Jersey (http://www.njtransit.com/tm/tm_servlet.srv?hdnPageAction=OzoneTo)
*** Denver (http://everytripcounts.org/routes-and-resources/)
** Bring lunch to work or walk to lunch
** Walk or ride a bicycle
** Work from home

At home reduction activities include:
* Limit the use of lawn mowers and outdoor grills to after 6:00 pm, or even better, utilize push mowers, manual racks and brooms
* Limit the use of [[aerosol]] cans around the home (for example, hair [[gel]] instead of hair spray)
** Dispose of the aerosol can properly
* Conserve energy
**Turn home air conditioning thermostat up to at least 78 as the [https://www3.epa.gov/region1/airquality/reducepollution.html EPA] recommends
**Utilize fans, turn the thermostat up when not at home, close blinds to reduce sun penetration
**Turn off or unplug electrical devices when not in use- computers especially can heat up rooms
**Install LED lights that utilize less energy. The prices of the lights are now affordable and many electric companies offer subsidized pricing at local stores such as Home Depot, Lowes and Ace Hardware

Some cities, such as Phoenix, Evansville, Dallas, and most cities in Alaska prohibit outdoor burning during Ozone Action Days. Even if not prohibited, not doing any burning would be heavily advised.

==How to protect yourself on High Ground Level Ozone Days==
On days with an AQI greater than 100, you can take several steps to reduce your exposure to ground level ozone.

Avoid prolonged exertion outdoors- any activity that will cause you to be outdoors for several hours where you are breathing harder than normal

Avoid heavy exertion outdoors- any activity that causes you to breathe heavily. For example- go on a walk instead of a run.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.airnow.gov/index.cfm?action=aqi_brochure.index&lt;/ref&gt;

==Long term ozone action plan==
Although the immediate concern is today’s Ozone Action Day, here are some longer term solutions

Use alternative-fuel vehicles, such as natural gas and hybrid electric

Some communities even expanded its line of buses, garbage trucks and even company vehicles, such as UPS trucks, to use alternative fuels

Choose environmentally friendly products

Such as reduced volatile organic compounds (VOCs) for paint &lt;ref&gt;Randall, Paul M. "Pollution prevention methods in the surface coating industry." Journal of Hazardous Materials 29.2 (1992): 275-295.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Store and dispose of chemicals correctly==
Local groups have chemical round ups.  For example, Colorado chemical information is at https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdphe/household-hazardous-waste-collection-programs

Some waste companies also have disposal options, such as Waste Management http://www.wm.com/enterprise/municipalities/residential-solutions/household-hazardous-waste.jsp

Proper disposal of fridge and air conditioners that contain chemicals. Some energy companies will even pay you to take it! For example, Xcel Energy has $50 rebates https://www.xcelenergy.com/Programs_and_Rebates/Residential_Programs_and_Rebates/Equipment_and_Appliances/

The '''Schumann resonances''' ('''SR''') are a set of spectrum peaks in the [[extremely low frequency]] (ELF) portion of the [[Earth]]'s [[electromagnetic field]] spectrum. Schumann resonances are global electromagnetic [[resonance]]s,  generated and excited by [[lightning]] discharges in the cavity formed by the Earth's surface and the [[ionosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sunearth/news/gallery/schumann-resonance.html |title=Schumann Resonance |publisher=NASA |language=en |access-date=2017-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
This global electromagnetic resonance phenomenon is named after physicist [[Winfried Otto Schumann]] who predicted it mathematically in 1952. Schumann resonances occur because the space between the surface of the Earth and the conductive ionosphere acts as a closed [[waveguide]]. The limited dimensions of the Earth cause this waveguide to act as a [[resonant cavity]] for [[electromagnetic waves]] in the [[extremely low frequency|ELF]] band. The cavity is naturally excited by electric currents in lightning. Schumann resonances are the principal background in the part of the electromagnetic spectrum&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url={{google books|plainurl=yes|id=_NbHNj7KJecC|page=114}} |title=The electrical nature of storms |last=MacGorman |first=D.

In the normal mode descriptions of Schumann resonances, the [[Fundamental frequency|fundamental mode]] is a [[standing wave]] in the Earth–ionosphere cavity with a [[wavelength]] equal to the circumference of the Earth. This lowest-frequency (and highest-intensity) mode of the Schumann resonance occurs at a [[frequency]] of approximately 4.11&amp;nbsp;Hz, but this frequency can vary slightly from a variety of factors, such as solar-induced perturbations to the ionosphere, which compresses the upper wall of the closed cavity.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} The higher resonance modes are spaced at approximately 6.5&amp;nbsp;Hz intervals,{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} a characteristic attributed to the atmosphere's spherical geometry. The peaks exhibit a spectral width of approximately 20% on account of the damping of the respective modes in the dissipative cavity. The 8th partial lies at approximately 60&amp;nbsp;Hz.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Observations of Schumann resonances have been used to track global lightning activity. Owing to the connection between lightning activity and the Earth's climate it has been suggested that they may also be used to monitor global temperature variations and variations of water vapor in the upper troposphere. It has been speculated that extraterrestrial lightning (on other planets) may also be detected and studied by means of their Schumann resonance signatures. Schumann resonances have been used to study the lower ionosphere on Earth and it has been suggested as one way to explore the lower ionosphere on celestial bodies. Effects on Schumann resonances have been reported following geomagnetic and ionospheric disturbances. More recently, discrete Schumann resonance excitations have been linked to [[transient luminous event]]s – [[upper-atmospheric lightning#Sprites|sprites]], [[Upper-atmospheric lightning#ELVES|ELVES]], [[upper-atmospheric lightning#Blue jets|jets]], and other [[upper-atmospheric lightning]].{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} A new field of interest using Schumann resonances is related to short-term [[earthquake prediction]].{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}  Interest in Schumann resonances was renewed in 1993 when E.

== History ==

In 1893, [[George Francis FitzGerald]] noted that the upper layers of the atmosphere must be fairly good conductors. Assuming that the height of these layers is about 100&amp;nbsp;km above ground, he estimated that oscillations (in this case the lowest [[Mode (music)|mode]] of the Schumann resonances) would have a period of 0.1 second.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=FitzGerald |first=G. F. |author-link=George Francis FitzGerald |date=1893 |title=On the period of vibration of electrical disturbances upon the Earth |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/95445#page/800/mode/1up |journal=Report of the British Association for the Advancement of Science |volume=63rd Meeting |page=682}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this contribution, it has been suggested to rename these resonances "Schumann–FitzGerald resonances".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=J. D. |last=Jackson |title=Examples of the zeroth theorem of the history of science |journal=American Journal of Physics |volume=76 |issue=8 |pages=704–719 |date=August 2008 |url=http://www-theory.lbl.gov/jdj/ZerothT_AJP.pdf|arxiv = 0708.4249 |bibcode = 2008AmJPh..76..704J |doi = 10.1119/1.2904468 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However FitzGerald's findings were not widely known as they were only presented at a meeting of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]], followed by a brief mention in a column in ''Nature''.

Hence the first suggestion that an ionosphere existed, capable of trapping [[electromagnetic waves]], is attributed to [[Heaviside]] and Kennelly (1902).&lt;ref name="Heaviside 1902"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Telegraphy, Sect. 1, Theory |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |location=London |last=Heaviside |first=O. |date=1902 |edition=10 |volume=9 |pages=213–218}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kennelly 1902"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Kennelly |first=A. E. |date=1902 |title=On the elevation of the electrically-conducting strata of the earth's atmosphere |journal=World and Engineer |volume=32 |pages=473}}&lt;/ref&gt; It took another twenty years before [[Edward Victor Appleton|Edward Appleton]] and Barnett in 1925&lt;ref name="Appleton 1925"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Appleton|first1=E.

Although some of the most important mathematical tools for dealing with spherical [[waveguide]]s were developed by [[G. N. Watson]] in 1918,&lt;ref name="Watson"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Watson|first=G. N. |title=The diffraction of electric waves by the Earth |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London A |volume=95 |issue=666 |date=1918| pages=83–99|bibcode=1918RSPSA..95...83W|doi=10.1098/rspa.1918.0050}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was [[Winfried Otto Schumann]] who first studied the theoretical aspects of the global resonances of the earth–ionosphere [[waveguide]] system, known today as the Schumann resonances.

Since then there has been an increasing interest in Schumann resonances in a wide variety of fields.

== Basic theory ==

Lightning discharges are considered to be the primary natural source of Schumann resonance excitation; lightning channels behave like huge antennas that radiate [[electromagnetic energy]] at frequencies below about 100&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref name="Volland 1984"&gt;{{cite book |last=Volland|first=H. |title=Atmospheric Electrodynamics |publisher=Springer-Verlag, Berlin |date=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; These signals are very weak at large distances from the lightning source, but the Earth–ionosphere [[waveguide]] behaves like a [[resonator]] at ELF frequencies and amplifies the spectral signals from lightning at the resonance frequencies.&lt;ref name="Volland 1984"/&gt;

In an ideal cavity, the [[resonant frequency]] of the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-th mode &lt;math&gt;f_{n}&lt;/math&gt; is determined by the [[Earth radius]] &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and the [[speed of light]] &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Schumann 1952a"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;f_{n} =\frac{c}{2 \pi a}\sqrt{n(n+1)}&lt;/math&gt;

The real Earth–ionosphere [[waveguide]] is not a perfect electromagnetic resonant cavity. Losses due to finite ionosphere [[electrical conductivity]] lower the propagation speed of electromagnetic signals in the cavity, resulting in a resonance frequency that is lower than would be expected in an ideal case, and the observed peaks are wide. In addition, there are a number of horizontal asymmetries – day-night difference in the height of the ionosphere, latitudinal changes in the [[Earth's magnetic field]], sudden ionospheric disturbances, polar cap absorption, variation in the [[Earth radius]] of ± 11&amp;nbsp;km from equator to geographic poles, etc. that produce other effects in the Schumann resonance power spectra.

== Measurements ==

Today Schumann resonances are recorded at many separate research stations around the world. The sensors used to measure Schumann resonances typically consist of two horizontal [[magnetic inductive coil]]s for measuring the north-south and east-west components of the [[magnetic field]], and a vertical electric dipole antenna for measuring the vertical component of the [[electric field]]. A typical passband of the instruments is 3–100&amp;nbsp;Hz.  The Schumann resonance electric field amplitude (~300 microvolts per meter) is much smaller than the [[Fair weather condition|static fair-weather electric field]] (~150 V/m) in the [[atmosphere]]. Similarly, the amplitude of the Schumann resonance magnetic field (~1 picotesla) is many [[orders of magnitude]] smaller than the [[Earth's magnetic field]] (~30–50 microteslas).&lt;ref name="Price et al."&gt;{{cite journal |last=Price|first=C.|first2=O. |last2=Pechony|first3=E. |last3=Greenberg |title=Schumann resonances in lightning research |journal=Journal of Lightning Research |volume=1 |date=2006| pages=1–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specialized receivers and antennas are needed to detect and record Schumann resonances. The electric component is commonly measured with a ball antenna, suggested by Ogawa et al., in 1966,&lt;ref name="Ogawa"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ogawa|first=T.|first2=Y. |last2=Tanka|first3= T. |last3=Miura|first4=M. |last4=Yasuhara|title=Observations of natural ELF electromagnetic noises by using the ball antennas |journal=Journal of Geomagnetism and Geoelectricity |volume=18 |issue=4|date=1966| pages=443–454 |doi=10.5636/jgg.18.443|bibcode=1966JGG....18..443O}}&lt;/ref&gt; connected to a high-impedance [[amplifier]]. The magnetic [[induction coil]]s typically consist of tens- to hundreds-of-thousands of turns of wire wound around a core of very high [[magnetic permeability]].

=== Dependence on global lightning activity ===

From the very beginning of Schumann resonance studies, it was known that they could be used to monitor global lightning activity. At any given time there are about 2000 [[thunderstorms]] around the [[globe]].&lt;ref name="Heckman 1998"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Heckman |first=S. J.|first2=E. |last2=Williams |title=Total global lightning inferred from Schumann resonance measurements |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |volume=103 |issue=D24 |date=1998| pages=31775–31779 |doi=10.1029/98JD02648 |bibcode=1998JGR...10331775H}}&lt;/ref&gt; Producing ~50 lightning events per [[second]],&lt;ref name="Christian "&gt;{{cite journal |display-authors=4|last=Christian |first=H. J.|first2=R. J. |last2=Blakeslee|first3=D. J. |last3=Boccippio|first4=W. L. |last4=Boeck|first5=D. E. |last5=Buechler|first6=K. T. |last6=Driscoll|first7=S. J. |last7=Goodman|first8=J.

Determining the spatial lightning distribution from Schumann resonance records is a complex problem: in order to estimate the lightning intensity from Schumann resonance records it is necessary to account for both the distance to lightning sources and the wave propagation between the source and the observer. A common approach is to make a preliminary assumption on the spatial lightning distribution, based on the known properties of lightning [[climatology]]. An alternative approach is placing the receiver at the [[North Pole|North]] or [[South Pole]], which remain approximately [[equidistant]] from the main thunderstorm centers during the day.&lt;ref name="Nickolaenko 1997"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nickolaenko|first=A. P. |title=Modern aspects of Schumann resonance studies |journal=Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics |volume=59 |issue=7 |date=1997| pages=806–816 |doi=10.1016/s1364-6826(96)00059-4|bibcode = 1997JASTP..59..805N }}&lt;/ref&gt; One method not requiring preliminary assumptions on the lightning distribution&lt;ref name="Shvets 2001"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shvets |first=A. V. |title=A technique for reconstruction of global lightning distance profile from background Schumann resonance signal |journal=Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics |volume=63 |issue=10 |date=2001| pages=1061–1074 |doi=10.1016/s1364-6826(01)00024-4|bibcode = 2001JASTP..63.1061S }}&lt;/ref&gt; is based on the decomposition of the average background Schumann resonance spectra, utilizing ratios between the average electric and magnetic spectra and between their linear combination. This technique assumes the cavity is spherically symmetric and therefore does not include known cavity asymmetries that are believed to affect the resonance and propagation properties of electromagnetic waves in the system.

==== Diurnal variations ====

The best documented and the most debated features of the Schumann resonance phenomenon are the diurnal variations of the background Schumann resonance power spectrum.

A characteristic Schumann resonance diurnal record reflects the properties of both global lightning activity and the state of the Earth–ionosphere cavity between the source region and the observer. The vertical [[electric field]] is independent of the direction of the source relative to the observer, and is therefore a measure of global lightning. The diurnal behavior of the vertical electric field shows three distinct maxima, associated with the three "hot spots" of planetary lightning activity: one at 9 UT ([[Universal Time]]) linked to the daily peak of [[thunderstorm]] activity from [[Southeast Asia]]; one at 14 UT linked to the peak of [[Africa]]n lightning activity; and one at 20 UT linked to the peak of [[South America]]n lightning activity. The time and [[amplitude]] of the peaks vary throughout the year, linked to seasonal changes in lightning activity.

===== "Chimney" ranking =====

In general, the African peak is the strongest, reflecting the major contribution of the African "chimney" to global lightning activity. The ranking of the two other peaks—Asian and American—is the subject of a vigorous dispute among Schumann resonance scientists. Schumann resonance observations made from Europe show a greater contribution from Asia than from South America, while observations made from North America indicate the dominant contribution comes from South America.

Williams and Sátori&lt;ref name="Williams Satori"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Williams |first=E. R.|first2=G. |last2=Sátori |title=Lightning, thermodynamic and hydrological comparison of the two tropical continental chimneys |journal=Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics |volume=66 |issue=13–14|date=2004| pages=1213–1231 |doi=10.1016/j.jastp.2004.05.015|bibcode = 2004JASTP..66.1213W }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that in order to obtain "correct" Asia-America chimney ranking, it is necessary to remove the influence of the day/night variations in the ionospheric conductivity (day-night asymmetry influence) from the Schumann resonance records. The "corrected" records presented in the work by Sátori, et al.&lt;ref name="Satori "&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sátori |first=G.|first2= M. |last2=Neska|first3=E. |last3=Williams|first4=J. |last4=Szendrői |title=Signatures of the non-uniform Earth–ionosphere cavity in high time-resolution Schumann resonance records |journal=Radio Science |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=RS003483 |year=2007 |doi=10.1029/2006RS003483|bibcode = 2007RaSc...42.2S10S }}&lt;/ref&gt; show that even after the removal of the day-night asymmetry influence from Schumann resonance records, the Asian contribution remains greater than American.

Similar results were obtained by Pechony et al.&lt;ref name="Pechony et al."&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pechony|first=O.|first2=C. |last2=Price|first3=A. P. |last3=Nickolaenko |title=Relative importance of the day-night asymmetry in Schumann resonance amplitude records |journal=Radio Science |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=RS2S06 |year=2007 |doi=10.1029/2006RS003456|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1040408|bibcode = 2007RaSc...42.2S06P }}&lt;/ref&gt; who calculated Schumann resonance fields from satellite lightning data. It was assumed that the distribution of lightning in the satellite maps was a good proxy for Schumann excitations sources, even though satellite observations predominantly measure in-cloud lightning rather than the cloud-to-ground lightning that are the primary exciters of the resonances.  Both simulations—those neglecting the day-night asymmetry, and those taking this asymmetry into account—showed the same Asia-America chimney ranking.  On the other hand, some optical satellite and climatological lightning data suggest the South American thunderstorm center is stronger than the Asian center.&lt;ref name="Christian "/&gt;

The reason for the disparity among rankings of Asian and American chimneys in Schumann resonance records remains unclear, and is the subject of further research.

In the early literature the observed diurnal variations of Schumann resonance power were explained by the variations in the source-receiver (lightning-observer) geometry.&lt;ref name="Balser Wagner a"/&gt; It was concluded that no particular systematic variations of the ionosphere (which serves as the upper [[waveguide]] boundary) are needed to explain these variations.&lt;ref name="Madden 1965"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Madden |first=T. |last2=Thompson |first2=W. |date=1965 |title=Low-frequency electromagnetic oscillations of the Earth–ionosphere cavity |journal=Reviews of Geophysics |volume=3 |issue=2 |page=211 |bibcode=1965RvGSP...3..211M |doi=10.1029/RG003i002p00211}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent theoretical studies supported the early estimations of the small influence of the ionosphere day-night asymmetry (difference between day-side and night-side ionosphere conductivity) on the observed variations in Schumann resonance field intensities.&lt;ref name="Nick 2002"&gt;{{cite book |last=Nickolaenko |first=A. P.|first2=M. |last2=Hayakawa|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht-Boston-London |date=2002 |title=Resonances in the Earth–ionosphere cavity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The interest in the influence of the day-night asymmetry in the ionosphere conductivity on Schumann resonances gained new strength in the 1990s, after publication of a work by Sentman and Fraser.&lt;ref name="Sentman Fraser"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Sentman |first=D. D. |last2=Fraser |first2=B. J. |date=1991 |title=Simultaneous observations of Schumann resonances in California and Australia – Evidence for intensity modulation by the local height of the D region |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |volume=96 |issue=9 |pages=15973–15984 |bibcode=1991JGR....9615973S |doi=10.1029/91JA01085}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sentman and Fraser developed a technique to separate the global and the local contributions to the observed field power variations using records obtained [[simultaneously]] at two stations that were widely separated in longitude. They interpreted the diurnal variations observed at each station in terms of a combination of a diurnally varying global excitation modulated by the local ionosphere height. Their work, which combined both observations and energy conservation arguments, convinced many scientists of the importance of the ionospheric day-night asymmetry and inspired numerous experimental studies. However, recently it was shown that results obtained by Sentman and Fraser can be approximately simulated with a uniform model (without taking into account ionosphere day-night variation) and therefore cannot be uniquely interpreted solely in terms of ionosphere height variation.&lt;ref name="Pechony Price"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Pechony |first=O. |last2=Price |first2=C. |date=2006 |title=Schumann Resonances: interpretation of local diurnal intensity modulations |journal=Radio Science |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=RS2S05 |bibcode=2006RaSc...41.2S05P |doi=10.1029/2006RS003455}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schumann resonance [[amplitude]] records show significant diurnal and seasonal variations which in general coincide in time with the times of the day-night transition (the [[Terminator (solar)|terminator]]). This time-matching seems to support the suggestion of a significant influence of the day-night ionosphere asymmetry on Schumann resonance amplitudes. There are records showing almost clock-like accuracy of the diurnal amplitude changes.&lt;ref name="Satori "/&gt; On the other hand, there are numerous days when Schumann Resonance amplitudes do not increase at [[sunrise]] or do not decrease at [[sunset]]. There are studies showing that the general behavior of Schumann resonance [[amplitude]] records can be recreated from diurnal and seasonal [[thunderstorm]] migration, without invoking ionospheric variations.&lt;ref name="Pechony et al."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nick 2002"/&gt; Two recent independent theoretical studies have shown that the variations in Schumann resonance power related to the day-night transition are much smaller than those associated with the peaks of the global lightning activity, and therefore the global lightning activity plays a more important role in the variation of the Schumann resonance power.&lt;ref name="Pechony et al."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yang-Pasko"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Yang |first=H. |last2=Pasko |first2=V. P. |date=2007 |title=Three-dimensional finite difference time domain modeling of the diurnal and seasonal variations in Schumann resonance parameters |journal=Radio Science |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=RS2S14 |bibcode=2006RaSc...41.2S14Y |doi=10.1029/2005RS003402}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is generally acknowledged that source-observer effects are the dominant source of the observed diurnal variations, but there remains considerable controversy about the degree to which day-night signatures are present in the data. Part of this controversy stems from the fact that the Schumann resonance parameters extractable from observations provide only a limited amount of information about the coupled lightning source-ionospheric system geometry. The problem of inverting observations to simultaneously infer both the lightning source function and ionospheric structure is therefore extremely underdetermined, leading to the possibility of non-unique interpretations.

==== "Inverse problem" ====

One of the interesting problems in Schumann resonances studies is determining the lightning source characteristics (the "inverse problem"). Temporally resolving each individual flash is impossible because the mean rate of excitation by lightning, ~50 lightning events per second globally, mixes up the individual contributions together.  However, occasionally extremely large lightning flashes occur which produce distinctive signatures that stand out from the background signals. Called "Q-bursts", they are produced by intense lightning strikes that transfer large amounts of charge from clouds to the ground and often carry high peak current.&lt;ref name="Ogawa"/&gt; Q-bursts can exceed the [[amplitude]] of the background signal level by a factor of 10 or more and appear with intervals of ~10 s,&lt;ref name="Shvets 2001"/&gt; which allows to consider them as isolated events and determine the source lightning location. The source location is determined with either multi-station or single-station techniques and requires assuming a model for the Earth–ionosphere cavity. The multi-station techniques are more accurate, but require more complicated and expensive facilities.

=== Transient luminous events research ===

It is now believed that many of the Schumann resonances transients (Q bursts) are related to the [[Upper-atmospheric lightning|transient luminous events (TLEs)]]. In 1995 Boccippio et al.&lt;ref name="Boccippio 95"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Boccippio |first=D. J. |last2=Williams |first2=E. R. |last3=Heckman |first3=S. J. |last4=Lyons |first4=W.

==== Global temperature ====

Williams [1992]&lt;ref name="Williams 1992"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Williams |first= E.R. |date=1992 |title=The Schumann resonance: a global tropical thermometer |journal=Science |volume=256 |issue=5060 |pages=1184–1186 |bibcode=1992Sci...256.1184W |doi=10.1126/science.256.5060.1184 |pmid=17795213}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that global temperature may be monitored with the Schumann resonances. The link between Schumann resonance and temperature is lightning flash rate, which increases nonlinearly with temperature.&lt;ref name="Williams 1992" /&gt; The [[nonlinearity]] of the lightning-to-temperature relation provides a natural [[amplifier]] of the temperature changes and makes Schumann resonance a sensitive "thermometer".

Schumann resonances may therefore help us to understand these [[feedback]] effects. In 2006 a paper was published linking Schumann resonance to global surface temperature&lt;ref name="M. Sekiguchi M.

==== Upper tropospheric water vapor ====

Tropospheric [[water vapor]] is a key element of the Earth’s climate, which has direct effects as a [[greenhouse gas]], as well as indirect effect through interaction with [[clouds]], [[aerosols]] and tropospheric chemistry. Upper tropospheric water vapor (UTWV) has a much greater impact on the [[greenhouse effect]] than [[water vapor]] in the lower [[atmosphere]],&lt;ref name="Hansen 1984"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Climate Processes and Climate Sensitivity |last=Hansen |first=J. |last2= Lacis |first2=A. |last3=Rind |first3=D.  |last4= Russel |first4=G. |last5= Stone |first5=P. |last6= Fung |first6=I. |last7= Ruedy |first7=R. |last8= Lerner |first8=J. |date=1984 |editor-last=Hansen  |editor-first=J.

Continental deep-convective [[thunderstorms]] produce most of the lightning discharges on Earth. In addition, they transport large amount of [[water vapor]] into the upper [[troposphere]], dominating the variations of global UTWV. Price [2000]&lt;ref name="Price 2000"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Price |first=C. |date=2000 |title=Evidence for a link between global lightning activity and upper tropospheric water vapor |journal=Nature |volume=406 |issue=6793 |pages=290–293 |doi=10.1038/35018543 |pmid=10917527}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that changes in the UTWV can be derived from records of Schumann resonances.

== On other planets and moons ==

The existence of Schumann-like resonances is conditioned primarily by two factors:
# A closed, planetary-sized and approximately spherical cavity, consisting of conducting lower and upper boundaries separated by an insulating medium.  For the earth the conducting lower boundary is its surface, and the upper boundary is the ionosphere. Other planets may have similar electrical conductivity geometry, so it is speculated that they should possess similar resonant behavior.
# A source of electrical excitation of [[electromagnetic waves]] in the ELF range.
Within the [[Solar System]] there are five candidates for Schumann resonance detection besides the Earth: [[Venus]], [[Mars]], [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]] and its biggest moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]].
Modeling Schumann resonances on the planets and [[moons]] of the Solar System is complicated by the lack of knowledge of the [[waveguide]] parameters. No ''in situ'' capability exists today to validate the results.

=== Venus ===

The strongest evidence for lightning on Venus comes from the impulsive electromagnetic waves detected by [[Venera]] 11 and 12 landers. Theoretical calculations of the Schumann resonances at Venus were reported by Nickolaenko and Rabinowicz [1982]&lt;ref name="Nickolaenko Venus"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Nickolaenko  |first=A. P. |last2=Rabinowicz |first2=L. M.  |date=1982 |title=On the possibility of existence of global electromagnetic resonances on the planets of Solar system |journal=Space Research |volume=20 |pages=82–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Pechony and Price [2004].&lt;ref name="Pechony Price 2004"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Pechony |first=O. |last2= Price |first2=C. |date=2004 |title=Schumann resonance parameters calculated with a partially uniform knee model on Earth, Venus, Mars, and Titan |journal=Radio Science |volume=39 |issue=5 |pages=RS5007 |bibcode=2004RaSc...39.5007P |doi=10.1029/2004RS003056}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both studies yielded very close results, indicating that Schumann resonances should be easily detectable on that planet given a lightning source of excitation and a suitably located sensor.

=== Mars ===

&lt;!-- ToDo: reduce redundancy --&gt;
In the case of Mars there have been terrestrial observations of radio emission spectra that have been associated with Schumann resonances.&lt;ref name="Ruf" /&gt; The reported radio emissions are not of the primary electromagnetic Schumann modes, but rather of secondary modulations of the nonthermal microwave emissions from the planet at approximately the expected Schumann frequencies, and have not been independently confirmed to be associated with lightning activity on Mars. There is the possibility that future lander missions could carry in situ instrumentation to perform the necessary measurements. Theoretical studies are primarily directed to parameterizing the problem for future planetary explorers.

Detection of lightning activity on Mars has been reported by Ruf et al. [2009].&lt;ref name="Ruf"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ruf |first=C. |last2=Renno |first2=N. O.  |last3=Kok |first3=J.

=== Titan ===

It was long ago suggested that lightning discharges may occur on [[Titan (moon)|Titan]],&lt;ref name="Lammer 2001"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Lammer  |first=H. |last2=Tokano |first2=T.  |last3=Fischer |first3=G.  |last4= Stumptner |first4=W. |last5=Molina-Cuberos |first5=G.

Since the landing of the Huygens probe on Titan's surface in January 2005, there have been many reports on observations and theory of an atypical Schumann resonance on Titan. After several tens of fly-bys by Cassini, neither lightning nor thunderstorms were detected in Titan's atmosphere. Scientists therefore proposed another source of electrical excitation: induction of ionospheric currents by Saturn's co-rotating magnetosphere. All data and theoretical models comply with a Schumann resonance, the second eigenmode of which was observed by the Huygens probe.

=== Jupiter and Saturn ===

Lightning activity has been optically detected on Jupiter. Existence of lightning activity on that planet was predicted by Bar-Nun [1975]&lt;ref name="Bar-Nun"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bar-Nun  |first=A. |date=1975 |title=Thunderstorms on Jupiter |journal=Icarus |volume=24 |pages=86–94 |bibcode=1975Icar...24...86B |doi=10.1016/0019-1035(75)90162-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is now supported by data from [[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo]], [[Voyager program|Voyagers]] 1 and 2, [[Pioneer program|Pioneers]] 10 and 11 and Cassini. Saturn is also confirmed to have lightning activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ciclops.org/view_event/178/Lightning_Flashing_in_Daylight |title=Lightning Flashing in Daylight (Saturn Images from NASA's Cassini Spacecraft) |website=www.ciclops.org |access-date=2017-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though three visiting spacecraft – [[Pioneer 11]] in 1979, [[Voyager 1]] in 1980 and [[Voyager 2]] in 1981, failed to provide any convincing evidence from optical observations, in July 2012 the Cassini spacecraft detected visible lightning flashes, and electromagnetic sensors aboard the spacecraft detected signatures that are characteristic of lightning. Little is known about the electrical parameters of Jupiter and Saturn interior. Even the question of what should serve as the lower [[waveguide]] boundary is a non-trivial one in case of the gaseous planets. There seem to be no works dedicated to Schumann resonances on Saturn. To date there has been only one attempt to model Schumann resonances on Jupiter.&lt;ref name="Sentman 1990"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Sentman  |first=D. D. |date=1990 |title=Electrical conductivity of Jupiter's Shallow interior and the formation of a resonant planetary-ionosphere cavity |journal=Icarus |volume=88 |pages=73–86 |bibcode=1990Icar...88...73S |doi=10.1016/0019-1035(90)90177-B}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, the electrical conductivity profile within the gaseous atmosphere of Jupiter was calculated using methods similar to those used to model stellar interiors, and it was pointed out that the same methods could be easily extended to the other gas giants Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. Given the intense lightning activity at Jupiter, the Schumann resonances should be easily detectable with a sensor suitably positioned within the planetary-ionospheric cavity.

A '''sebil''' or '''sabil''' ({{lang-ar|سبيل}}; [[Turkish language|Turkish]]: ''sebil'') is a small kiosk where water is freely dispensed to members of the public. Historically, it is a structure of both civic and religious importance in [[Islam|Muslim]] cities, most characteristically under the [[Ottoman Empire]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ottoman Architecture|last=Kuban|first=Doğan|publisher=Antique Collectors' Club|year=2010|isbn=9781851496044|location=Woodbridge, Suffolk, UK|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Strolling Through Istanbul: The Classic Guide to the City|last=|last1=Sumner-Boyd |last2=Freely|first=|first1=Hilary |first2=John|publisher=Tauris Parke Paperbacks|year=2010|isbn=9781848851542|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, but also in other regions and periods such as [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk]] [[Cairo]]&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cairo of the Mamluks : A History of Architecture and Its Culture|last=Behrens-Abouseif|first=Doris|publisher=The American University in Cairo Press|year=2007|isbn=9789774160776|location=Cairo|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It is sometimes also used to refer to simple fountains for drinking water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dictionary of Islamic Architecture|last=Petersen|first=Andrew|publisher=Routledge|year=1996|isbn=0415213320|location=New York|pages=254}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sebils were built at [[Intersection (road)|crossroads]], in the middle of city squares, and on the outside of [[mosque]]s and other religious complexes throughout the [[Ottoman Empire]] to provide [[drinking water]] for travelers and enable [[ritual purification|ritual purification (ablutions)]] before [[prayer]].

== Description and function ==
A typical sebil was built over an underground [[cistern]] which supplied the water for distribution.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Islamic Monuments in Cairo: The Practical Guide (6th edition)|last=Williams|first=Caroline|publisher=American University in Cairo Press|year=2008|isbn=9789774162053|location=Cairo|pages=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the pumped water ran down a decorative carved marble panel called a ''selsebil'', which may also have served the purpose of aerating the water as it came from the cistern.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This service was free to members of the public, and was paid for by the revenues or funds of a charitable endowment, an Islamic [[waqf]], provided or set up by the patron who commissioned the building.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Endowing money for the construction of sebils was considered an act of piety, and the construction of many sebils was considered the hallmark of a beneficent ruler.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pages.drexel.edu/~cfh27/Jerusalem/Ottoman_Sabils_of_Jerusalem.pdf Ottoman sabils of Jerusalem] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150424131453/http://www.pages.drexel.edu/~cfh27/Jerusalem/Ottoman_Sabils_of_Jerusalem.pdf |date=2015-04-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;gallery widths="200" heights="200"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==History==
In [[16th century]] [[Istanbul]], sebils were a symbol of public possession. The attempt to add [[Tap (valve)|spigots]] was opposed because this was perceived as limiting public access to the blessings of nature. Initially, they functioned as kiosks where water was distributed to passersby.&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:WkzyMAcKJcEJ:www.az.itu.edu.tr/azv7n1web/05onayugurlu0701.pdf+&amp;hl=en&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESirhcFB2kH2hOAW1xRgR771aEPcWy0karWmVS9ABfZQ8Yj6DQ7gtHTcWF195pZ_ydHFO-kX6TkRmcgJu2NjI67bkfvBIJpI3qoRRLP_5r2Rot0P8ezw19NT38k9hnQhGHlZ3kID&amp;sig=AHIEtbRwlPKFYc0ZRgX9XUuetMpXIHOgGg&amp;pli=1 A public meeting point: Sebil of Nuruosmaniye]&lt;/ref&gt;
Often they were decorated in the [[Ottoman Rococo]] style and inscribed with [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] verses that formed a [[chronogram]] using the [[Abjad number]]s to date the construction.
Until the spread of inhouse plumbing by the end of the [[20th century]], they were essential for the daily life of the inhabitants of Istanbul.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1854">The '''Ship Security Reporting System''' (SSRS) is a counter piracy system that has been developed to combat the increasing instances of hijack and ransom on cargo ships predominantly occurring in the [[Gulf of Aden]] and around the [[Horn of Africa]].

Before the development of SSRS, commercial shipping was reliant on the Ship Security Alerting System&lt;ref&gt;"[[Ship Security Alerting System]]"&lt;/ref&gt; (SSAS) that contributes to the [[International Maritime Organization]]’s initiative to improve maritime security through the [[Safety of Life at Sea]] (SOLAS) convention and, more recently, through the [[International Ship and Port Facility Security Code]] (ISPS).

The SSRS builds on the [[Ship Security Alert System]] (SSAS) that exists on most cargo and passenger ships over 300 gross tonnes flagged to [[Safety of Life at Sea|SOLAS]] contracting governments by linking the SSAS to naval forces responsible for maritime security in a specific area. The SSRS continually monitors ship security alerts and transmits critical data to participating Naval Operations Centres. The NOC alerts the nearest naval vessel, thus initiating an almost immediate military response.

In [[Turkic mythology]], '''Su Iyesi''' ([[Tatar language|Tatar]]: ''Су Иясе'' or ''Su İyäse''; [[Chuvash language|Chuvash]]: ''Шыв Ийӗ''; [[Sakha language|Sakha]]: ''Уу Иччи''; literally "water master") is a water spirit. It corresponds to the [[nymph]] in Turkic cultures. It is a disembodied, incorporeal, intangible entity, but she [[shapeshifting|can turn into]] a female creature and daughter of [[Yer Tanrı]].

==Features==
When angered, she breaks dams, washes away water mills,&lt;ref&gt;[http://turkoloji.cu.edu.tr/HALKBILIM/culpan_zaripova_cetin_tatar_turkleri_mitoloji.pdf Creatures of Turkic Tatars (Tatar Türklerinde Varlıklar), Çulpan Zaripova]{{tr}}&lt;/ref&gt; and drowns people and animals. She drags people down to her underwater dwelling to serve her as slaves. She is in Tatar&lt;ref&gt;[http://tatarile.org/maglumat/%D0%BC%D3%99%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BB%D3%99/%D0%B8%D0%B1%D0%BD%D0%B5-%D1%84%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%BD-%D1%8F%D0%B7%D0%BC%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%8B ИБНЕ ФАЗЛАН ЯЗМАЛАРЫ]{{tt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; fairy tales the same creature as the Su Anası ("water mother"). In Turkic tales, she lives in ponds or rivers. There is no mention of a particular dwelling, and the 'half-sunken log' is unapparent. She rides on a log to travel.

Su Iyesi is sometimes associated with perilous events such as floods, storms, shipwrecks and drownings. In other Turkic folk traditions, she can be benevolent or beneficent.

===Su Ana===
'''Su Ana''' ("water mother") is often mentioned as the female form of Su Iyesi. She is said to appear as a naked young woman with a fairy-like face and yellow and long hair, usually covered in black fish scales. She has a fish's tail and eyes that burn like fire. She usually rides along her river on a half-sunken log, making loud splashes. Local drownings are said to be the work of the Su Anası. She is the wife of Su Ata. She likes shores and likes to get out of the water.

Its name in [[Hungary|Hungarian]] culture is ''Víz Anya'' and in [[Mongolia]]n belief is ''Ус Ээж'' ([[Buriat language|Buryat]]: ''Уһан Эхэ''; [[Oirat language|Oirat]]: ''Усн Эк''). These entities have many similarities, and each name has the same meaning, "aqua mother".

===Su Ata===
'''Su Ata''' ("water father") is the male form of Su Iyesi. He appears as an old man with a frog-like face, greenish beard, with his body covered in algae and muck. He has webbed paws instead of hands. He usually rides along his river. Consequently, he is often dubbed '''Vudaş''' ([[Chuvash language|Chuvash]]: ''Вутăш, Vutăş'') by the [[Chuvash people]]. He is a river and lake god. When someone has drowned, people often say "Su Ata took him." He also reportedly hates people who pollute the waters. The advice on how to please him goes that one should throw a whole bread into the water to make him happy. Also, when a bride must go far away, she has to be introduced to Su Ata.

A '''subaqueous volcano''' is a [[volcano]] formed beneath freshwater and never builds above [[lake]] level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haller|first1=Kathleen M.|last2=Wood|first2=Spencer Hoffman|title=Geological Field Trips in Southern Idaho, Eastern Oregon, and Northern Nevada|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cgE6XG-uL-0C&amp;pg=PA108&amp;lpg=PA108&amp;dq=Subaqueous+volcano&amp;source=web&amp;ots=WxL2iZ1PXb&amp;sig=GOJw-QwX81zynGK_udBzwYLvVWQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ct=result|publisher=Geosciences Department, Boise State University|ref=Geological Field Trips in Southern Idaho, Eastern Oregon, and Northern Nevada|language=en|date=1 January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are commonly in the form of gently sloping [[tuff cone]]s, although they can sometimes have an {{Clarify span|unvolcano-like form|reason=what form do they have and why is it "unvolcano-like"?|date=July 2016}}, such as [[White Horse Bluff]] in the [[Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field]] of east-central [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/volcanoes/cat/belt_wells_e.php|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061008193700/http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/volcanoes/cat/belt_wells_e.php|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2006-10-08|ref=Catalogue of Canadian volcanoes - Wells Gray - Clearwater volcano field}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subaqueous volcanoes can be compared to [[subaerial volcano]]es which are formed and erupt on land surface, or under the air. The major differences of volcanic eruptions are due to the effects of pressure, heat capacity or conductivity of water, the presence of steam and water rheology. The [[thermal conductivity]] of water is about 20 times that of air and steam has a thermal conductivity nearly 50 times that of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.d.umn.edu/~rmorton/ronshome/Volcanology/Subaqueous%20Pyroclastic%20Flows%202010%20Hudak.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Subaqueous volcanoes are most commonly formed in oceans, but can also form in lakes, rivers and subglacial lakes. In improving our understanding of subaqueous volcanoes, it is important to consider the differences between the characteristics of modern and ancient approaches to the study. Modern studies offer fresh and unaltered observances, can see and map surface features and the water depth is known in areas that allow observation. Ancient studies have had stratigraphic exposure to sections, are easier to work on, have more and better exposures and have an existing relationship to resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=http://www.d.umn.edu/~rmorton/ronshome/Volcanology/subaqueouslavasclass.pdf|url=http://www.d.umn.edu/~rmorton/ronshome/Volcanology/subaqueouslavasclass.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some geologists would restrict the term subaqueous pyroclastic flow deposits to volcaniclastic units that show characteristics of emplacement in a hot state deposited underwater—however, this can’t always be done because of the subsequent process of alteration/diagenesis such as active hot springs and associated [[hydrothermal alteration]]. Deposits from pyroclastic flows that interact with water and are transformed into water-supported mass flows are called subaqueous pyroclastic debris flow deposits by some geologists. On the other hand, processes that are associated with eruption, transportation and deposition are notably different because of the presence of water. Such differences that the presence of water entails is the ability to vaporize when in contact with water, a high density and resulting confining pressure, high viscosity relative to air and differences in the thermal conductivities/heat capacities in the air relative to water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.d.umn.edu/~rmorton/ronshome/Volcanology/Subaqueous%20Pyroclastic%20Flows%202010%20Hudak.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some understanding of subaqueous volcanoes can be inferred from knowledge of volcanic processes based on ancient successions. Subaqueous volcano deposits have been occurring in the south of Honshu, the largest island among Japan’s four principal islands. The four subaqueous volcanic deposits have been documented and are located throughout Japan offer significant evidence to study.

Subaqueous volcanic deposits are associated with subaqueous sedimentary deposits and these deposits range from near shore, off-shore and abyssal mudstone deposits. Unfortunately, paleo-depth constraints for sedimentary strata are poor and subject to contradicting interpretations. However, the depth of emplacement can be conjectured with minor control of water depth. In determining the characteristics of pyroclastic flows in subaerial versus subaqueous deposits, it is commonly believed that water fluidized volcaniclastic flows become normally graded in terms of all components except for large, buoyant pumice blocks which settle to form large pumice layers. However, this phenomenon is usually seen as subaerial ignimbrite (pumice rich pyroclastic flows) deposits. Because of this, the characteristic is not considered clear evidence for the interpretation of the fluidizing agent (hot gas or water) and can therefore only be used in conjunction with other criteria.

Characteristics can be sorted to infer subaqueous eruption or emplacement of silicic pyroclastic deposits. Larger pumice blocks rise for a more extended period of time (minutes to hours) in comparison to smaller pumice fragments because of gases trapped within vesicles and the very fine ash fragments may become entrained into the rising plume of gas and heated water because of the low density and weight. Therefore, subaqueous silicic pyroclastic eruptions may be diminished in the course size fraction as well as the very fine ash size fraction based on the buoyancy of the material in the water medium. These characteristics may be important in determining the style of subaqueous eruption and emplacement mechanism. The characteristics of texture, such as grain morphology and grain size abundances can also provide knowledge on the process of controlling the eruption style or transport/flow properties, whether turbulent or laminar.

Seafloor exploration has discovered that more volcanic eruptions occur at the bottom of the sea than on land. However, the effects of ambient water and hydrostatic pressure on silicic volcanic eruptions in subaqueous settings are not entirely understood because deep marine eruptions are not directly observed and studied. Because of this, information of recent deep-water volcanic eruptions are still incomplete and limited.

The conclusions of the studies of subaqueous volcanoes in Japan determine that clear evidence for eruption and/or emplacement of pyroclastic flows continue to be determined from the examination of these deposits although inferential evidence such as grain morphology, sorting and grading can be used to identify and document ancient subaqueous volcanic deposits. 
The University of California, Santa Barbara will continue to conduct further research which may be able to provide further information on styles of subaqueous volcanic eruptions and/or flow characteristics of volcanic deposits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ssr#00-04|url=https://www.nsf.gov/od/iia/ise/tokyo/reports/ssr/ssr00-04.html|website=www.nsf.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Titanic''''' is a 1996 American two-part television [[miniseries]] which premiered on [[CBS]] on November 17 and 19, 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Bellafante, Gina (November 25, 1996). [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,985612,00.html?iid=chix-sphere "Disaster: That'S Entertainment"]. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Titanic'' follows several characters on board the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] when she sinks on her maiden voyage in 1912. The miniseries was directed by [[Robert Lieberman]]. The original music score was composed by [[Lennie Niehaus]].

==Plot==
''Titanic'' follows three main story threads.

Isabella Paradine is traveling on the ''Titanic'' to join her husband after attending her aunt's funeral in England. On the ''Titanic'', she meets Wynn Park, her former lover. She falls in love with him again, and after a brief affair, she sends her husband a wireless saying they cannot be together anymore (despite their daughter). When the ship starts sinking, Isabella reluctantly leaves Wynn when he forces her to board a [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]]. As the boat is lowered, Isabella confesses a long kept secret that her daughter Claire is actually Wynn's. Later on board the [[RMS Carpathia|RMS ''Carpathia'']] she is grief-stricken when she finds Wynn's lifeless body on deck, having died of [[hypothermia]], but luckily, when the ''Carpathia'' reaches [[New York City|New York]] she is reunited with her family who are blissfully unaware of Isabella's tryst because the telegram was never sent out due to the sinking.

Also in first class is the [[Allison family]], a family travelling on the Titanic, returning home to [[Montreal]] with their two small children and new nurse, [[Alice Cleaver]]. They gradually become wary and suspicious of her hysterical and neurotic behavior. Later on, a fellow maid asks her if she'd seen her in Cairo the previous month, but soon realizes that she remembers her from the highly publicized trial where Alice was accused of throwing her baby off a train. When the ''Titanic'' starts sinking, Alice Cleaver panics and quickly boards a lifeboat with Trevor, the Allisons' infant son. The parents with their small daughter are unaware that the baby is safe and refuse to leave the ship without him, which in the end costs them their lives.

In third class, a young vagrant named Jamie Perse steals a ticket to get on board. He manages to become friends with one of the crewmen, Simon Doonan, who is also a robber, but later is revealed to be a much more violent and callous criminal than Jamie. The young man falls in love with Aase (pronounced "Osa") Ludvigsen, a recent Christian convert and missionary. On the night of the sinking, Aase is brutally raped and beaten by Doonan, causing her to lose her faith and will to live, but Jamie manages to get her into Isabella's boat. Unbeknownst to them, Doonan also sneaks aboard that same boat, disguised as an old woman. After the ship sinks, Aase is knocked off the lifeboat by Doonan after she recognizes him, and he attempts to hold the passengers in the boat hostage at gunpoint, but Officer [[Harold Lowe|Lowe]], who is in charge of the boat, hits Doonan in the head with a paddle, snapping his neck and killing him. Jamie himself manages to survive when he accidentally falls into one of the last lifeboats before the ''Titanic'' sinks. He subsequently atones for his past life after he finds Aase in the makeshift hospital aboard the ''Carpathia''. In the end, upon arriving in New York, the two plan to start a new life together.

==Reception==
''Titanic'' received mixed to negative reviews from critics. The ''[[New York Daily News]]'' commented on the fact that the acting was substandard and the ship's operators and owner are portrayed "about as sympathetically as those connected with the [[Exxon Valdez]]."&lt;ref&gt;Bianculli, David (November 15, 1996).

== Poem ==
The first poem to be launched into orbit about the Earth was inscribed on the instrument panel of TRAAC. Entitled ''Space Prober'' and written by Prof. [[Thomas G. Bergin]] of [[Yale University]], it reads in part:
:''And now 'tis man who dares assault the sky...''
:''And as we come to claim our promised place, aim only to repay the good you gave,''
:''And warm with human love the chill of space.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.jsc.nasa.gov/er/seh/quotes.html |title=Space Quotes |work=Space Educator's Handbook |publisher=[[NASA]] |accessdate=2007-10-07 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121213140940/http://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/slsd/about/divisions/hefd/index.html |archivedate=December 13, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Roots blower - 2 lobes.svg|thumb|right|The [[Roots blower]] is one example of a vacuum pump]]

A '''vacuum pump''' is a device that removes gas molecules from a sealed volume in order to leave behind a partial [[vacuum]].  The first vacuum pump was invented in 1650 by [[Otto von Guericke]], and was preceded by the [[Vacuum pump#History|suction pump]], which dates to antiquity.

== History ==
[[Image:HiVacuumApparatus-Tesla.png|thumb|333px|Tesla's vacuum apparatus, published in 1892]]

The predecessor to the vacuum [[pump]] was the '''[[suction]] pump''', which was known to the Romans. Dual-action suction pumps were found in the city of [[Pompeii]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imss.fi.it/pompei/tecnica/epompa.html|title=Pompeii: Technology: Working models: IMSS|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arabic engineer [[Al-Jazari]] also described suction pumps in the 13th century. He said that his model was a larger version of the [[siphons]] the Byzantines used to discharge the [[Greek fire]].&lt;ref name="Hill" /&gt; The suction pump later reappeared in Europe from the 15th century.&lt;ref name="Hill"&gt;[[Donald Routledge Hill]] (1996), ''A History of Engineering in Classical and Medieval Times'', [[Routledge]], pp. 143 &amp; 150-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hill2&gt;[[Donald Routledge Hill]], "Mechanical Engineering in the Medieval Near East", ''Scientific American'', May 1991, pp. 64-69 ([[cf.]] [[Donald Routledge Hill]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20110101193750/http://home.swipnet.se/islam/articles/HistoryofSciences.htm Mechanical Engineering])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ahmad Y Hassan |title=The Origin of the Suction Pump: Al-Jazari 1206 A.D |url=http://www.history-science-technology.com/Notes/Notes%202.htm |accessdate=2008-07-16 |authorlink=Ahmad Y Hassan |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226102543/http://www.history-science-technology.com/Notes/Notes%202.htm |archivedate=February 26, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Molchanova by levitskiy.jpg|thumb|Student of [[Smolny Institute]] Catherine Molchanova with vacuum pump, by [[Dmitry Levitzky]], 1776]]
By the 17th century, water pump designs had improved to the point that they produced measurable vacuums, but this was not immediately understood. What was known was that suction pumps could not pull water beyond a certain height: 18 Florentine yards according to a measurement taken around 1635. (The conversion to metres is uncertain, but it would be about 9 or 10 metres.) This limit was a concern to irrigation projects, mine drainage, and decorative water fountains planned by the Duke of [[Tuscany]], so the duke commissioned [[Galileo]] to investigate the problem. Galileo advertised the puzzle to other scientists, including [[Gasparo Berti]] who replicated it by building the first water barometer in Rome in 1639.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.denmark.com.au/en/Worlds+Largest+Barometer/default.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216140317/http://www.denmark.com.au/en/Worlds+Largest+Barometer/default.htm |archivedate=2008-02-16 |title=The World's Largest Barometer |accessdate=2008-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Berti's barometer produced a vacuum above the water column, but he could not explain it. The breakthrough was made by [[Evangelista Torricelli]] in 1643.  Building upon Galileo's notes, he built the first [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] [[barometer]] and wrote a convincing argument that the space at the top was a vacuum. The height of the column was then limited to the maximum weight that atmospheric pressure could support; this is the limiting height of a [[suction pump]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Calvert|2000|loc="[http://mysite.du.edu/~jcalvert/tech/fluids/hydstat.htm#Maxh Maximum height to which water can be raised by a suction pump]"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1654, [[Otto von Guericke]] invented the first vacuum pump and conducted his famous [[Magdeburg hemispheres]] experiment, showing that teams of horses could not separate two hemispheres from which the air had been evacuated. [[Robert Boyle]] improved Guericke's design and conducted experiments on the properties of vacuum. [[Robert Hooke]] also helped Boyle produce an air pump which helped to produce the vacuum. The study of vacuum then lapsed{{Dubious|date=September 2011}} until 1855, when [[Heinrich Geissler]] invented the mercury displacement pump and achieved a record vacuum of about 10&amp;nbsp;Pa (0.1 [[Torr]]). A number of electrical properties become observable at this vacuum level, and this renewed interest in vacuum. This, in turn, led to the development of the [[vacuum tube]].

In the 19th century, [[Nikola Tesla]] designed an apparatus that contains a [[Sprengel pump]] to create a high degree of exhaustion.

== Types ==
Pumps can be broadly categorized according to three techniques:&lt;ref name="VCH"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Van Atta | first = C. M. |author2=M. Hablanian | editor = Rita G. Lerner | editor2 = George L. Trigg | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Physics | title = Vacuum and Vacuum Technology | edition = Second | date = 1991 | publisher = VCH Publishers Inc. | pages = 1330–1333 | isbn = 978-3-527-26954-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Positive displacement pumps use a mechanism to repeatedly expand a cavity, allow gases to flow in from the chamber, seal off the cavity, and exhaust it to the atmosphere. Momentum transfer pumps, also called molecular pumps, use high speed jets of dense fluid or high speed rotating blades to knock gas molecules out of the chamber. Entrapment pumps capture gases in a solid or adsorbed state. This includes [[cryopump]]s, [[getter]]s, and [[Ion pump (physics)|ion pump]]s.

Positive displacement pumps are the most effective for low vacuums. Momentum transfer pumps in conjunction with one or two positive displacement pumps are the most common configuration used to achieve high vacuums.  In this configuration the positive displacement pump serves two purposes.  First it obtains a rough vacuum in the vessel being evacuated before the momentum transfer pump can be used to obtain the high vacuum, as momentum transfer pumps cannot start pumping at atmospheric pressures.  Second the positive displacement pump backs up the momentum transfer pump by evacuating to low vacuum the accumulation of displaced molecules in the high vacuum pump.  Entrapment pumps can be added to reach ultrahigh vacuums, but they require periodic regeneration of the surfaces that trap air molecules or ions.  Due to this requirement their available operational time can be unacceptably short in low and high vacuums, thus limiting their use to ultrahigh vacuums. Pumps also differ in details like manufacturing tolerances, sealing material, pressure, flow, admission or no admission of oil vapor, service intervals, reliability, tolerance to dust, tolerance to chemicals, tolerance to liquids and vibration.

=== Positive displacement pump===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Vacuum]] --&gt;
[[Image:L-Pumpe2.png|thumb|The manual water pump draws water up from a well by creating a vacuum that water rushes in to fill. In a sense, it acts to evacuate the well, although the high leakage rate of dirt prevents a high quality vacuum from being maintained for any length of time.]]
[[Image:Two moving spirals scroll pump.gif|frame|Mechanism of a scroll pump]]

A partial vacuum may be generated by increasing the volume of a container. To continue evacuating a chamber indefinitely without requiring infinite growth, a compartment of the vacuum can be repeatedly closed off, exhausted, and expanded again. This is the principle behind a '''positive displacement pump''', for example the manual water pump. Inside the pump, a mechanism expands a small sealed cavity to reduce its pressure below that of the atmosphere. Because of the pressure differential, some fluid from the chamber (or the well, in our example) is pushed into the pump's small cavity. The pump's cavity is then sealed from the chamber, opened to the atmosphere, and squeezed back to a minute size.

More sophisticated systems are used for most industrial applications, but the basic principle of cyclic volume removal is the same:
* [[Rotary vane pump]], the most common
* [[Diaphragm pump]], zero oil contamination
* [[Liquid ring]] high resistance to dust 
* [[Reciprocating compressor|Piston pump]], fluctuating vacuum
* [[Scroll compressor|Scroll pump]], highest speed dry pump
* [[Archimedes' screw|Screw pump]] (10 Pa)
* [[Wankel]] pump
* External vane pump
* [[Roots blower]], also called a booster pump, has highest pumping speeds but low compression ratio
* Multistage Roots pump that combine several stages providing high pumping speed with better compression ratio
* [[Toepler pump]]
* [[Lobe pump]]

The base pressure of a [[rubber]]- and [[plastic]]-sealed piston pump system is typically 1 to 50 kPa, while a scroll pump might reach 10 Pa (when new) and a rotary vane oil pump with a clean and empty metallic chamber can easily achieve 0.1 Pa.

A positive displacement vacuum pump moves the same [[volume]] of gas with each cycle, so its pumping speed is constant unless it is overcome by backstreaming.

=== Momentum transfer pump===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Vacuum]] --&gt;
[[Image:Cut through turbomolecular pump.jpg|thumb|A cutaway view of a turbomolecular high vacuum pump]]
In a '''momentum transfer pump''', gas molecules are accelerated from the vacuum side to the exhaust side (which is usually maintained at a reduced pressure by a positive displacement pump). Momentum transfer pumping is only possible below pressures of about 0.1 kPa. Matter flows differently at different pressures based on the laws of [[fluid dynamics]]. At atmospheric pressure and mild vacuums, molecules interact with each other and push on their neighboring molecules in what is known as viscous flow. When the distance between the molecules increases, the molecules interact with the walls of the chamber more often than with the other molecules, and molecular pumping becomes more effective than positive displacement pumping. This regime is generally called high vacuum.

Molecular pumps sweep out a larger area than mechanical pumps, and do so more frequently, making them capable of much higher pumping speeds. They do this at the expense of the seal between the vacuum and their exhaust. Since there is no seal, a small pressure at the exhaust can easily cause backstreaming through the pump; this is called stall. In high vacuum, however, pressure gradients have little effect on fluid flows, and molecular pumps can attain their full potential.

The two main types of molecular pumps are the [[diffusion pump]] and the [[turbomolecular pump]]. Both types of pumps blow out gas molecules that diffuse into the pump by imparting momentum to the gas molecules. Diffusion pumps blow out gas molecules with jets of oil or mercury, while turbomolecular pumps use high speed fans to push the gas. Both of these pumps will stall and fail to pump if exhausted directly to atmospheric pressure, so they must be exhausted to a lower grade vacuum created by a mechanical pump.

As with positive displacement pumps, the base pressure will be reached when leakage, [[outgassing]], and [[backstreaming]] equal the pump speed, but now minimizing leakage and outgassing to a level comparable to backstreaming becomes much more difficult.

=== Regenerative pump ===
Regenerative pumps utilize vortex behavior of the fluid (air). The construction is based on hybrid concept of [[centrifugal pump]] and turbopump. Usually it consists of several sets of perpendicular teeth on the rotor circulating air molecules inside stationary hollow grooves like multistage centrifugal pump.  They can reach to 1×10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; mbar (0.001 Pa)(when combining with Holweck pump) and directly exhaust to atmospheric pressure. Examples of such pumps are Edwards EPX &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edwardsvacuum.com/Products/List.aspx?r=32|title=EPX on-tool High Vacuum Pumps|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (technical paper &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130915114706/http://edwardsvacuum.com/uploadedFiles/Resource/Technical_Articles/Toward+the+Single+Pumping+Solution.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|author=|date=15 September 2013|website=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and Pfeiffer OnTool™ Booster 150.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pfeiffer-vacuum.com/products/side-channel-pumps/container.action|title=Side Channel Pump, Vacuum pump for High-vacuum - Pfeiffer Vacuum|author=Pfeiffer Vacuum|website=Pfeiffer Vacuum|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130401112132/http://www.pfeiffer-vacuum.com/products/side-channel-pumps/container.action|archivedate=2013-04-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes referred as side channel pump. Due to high pumping rate from atmosphere to high vacuum and less contamination since bearing can be installed at exhaust side, this type of pumps are used in load lock in semiconductor manufacturing processes.

This type of pump suffers from high power consumption(~1&amp;nbsp;kW) compare to turbomolecular pump (&lt;100W) at low pressure since most power is consumed to back atmospheric pressure. This can be reduced by nearly 10 times by backing with a small pump.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal= Vacuum |volume= 85 |issue= 12 |year= 2011 | pages= 1174–1177 |title= High vacuum side channel pump working against atmosphere |first1= A. |last1= Shirinov |first2= S. |last2= Oberbeck | doi=10.1016/j.vacuum.2010.12.018|bibcode= 2011Vacuu..85.1174S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Entrapment pump===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Vacuum]] --&gt;
An '''entrapment pump''' may be a [[cryopump]], which uses [[cryogenic|cold]] temperatures to condense gases to a solid or adsorbed state, a chemical pump, which reacts with gases to produce a solid residue, or an [[Ion pump (physics)|ion pump]], which uses strong electrical fields to ionize gases and propel the ions into a solid substrate. A [[cryomodule]] uses cryopumping. Other types are the [[sorption pump]], non-evaporative [[getter]] pump, and [[titanium sublimation pump]] (a type of evaporative getter that can be used repeatedly).

=== Other types ===
*Venturi vacuum pump ([[Aspirator (pump)|aspirator]]) (10 to 30 kPa)
*[[Injector|Steam ejector]] (vacuum depends on the number of stages, but can be very low)

== Performance measures ==
Pumping speed refers to the volume flow rate of a pump at its inlet, often measured in volume per unit of time.  Momentum transfer and entrapment pumps are more effective on some gases than others, so the pumping rate can be different for each of the gases being pumped, and the average volume flow rate of the pump will vary depending on the chemical composition of the gases remaining in the chamber.

Throughput refers to the pumping speed multiplied by the gas pressure at the inlet, and is measured in units of pressure·volume/unit time. At a constant temperature, throughput is proportional to the number of molecules being pumped per unit time, and therefore to the [[mass flow rate]] of the pump. When discussing a leak in the system or backstreaming through the pump, throughput refers to the volume leak rate multiplied by the pressure at the vacuum side of the leak, so the leak throughput can be compared to the pump throughput.

Positive displacement and momentum transfer pumps have a constant volume flow rate (pumping speed), but as the chamber's [[pressure]] drops, this volume contains less and less mass. So although the pumping speed remains constant, the throughput and [[mass flow rate]] drop exponentially. Meanwhile, the leakage, [[evaporation]], [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]] and backstreaming rates continue to produce a constant throughput into the system.

== Techniques ==
Vacuum pumps are combined with chambers and operational procedures into a wide variety of vacuum systems. Sometimes more than one pump will be used (in [[Series circuits|series]] or in [[Parallel circuits|parallel]]) in a single application. A partial vacuum, or rough vacuum, can be created using a positive displacement pump that transports a gas load from an inlet port to an outlet (exhaust) port. Because of their mechanical limitations, such pumps can only achieve a low vacuum. To achieve a higher vacuum, other techniques must then be used, typically in series (usually following an initial fast pump down with a positive displacement pump). Some examples might be use of an oil sealed rotary vane pump (the most common positive displacement pump) backing a diffusion pump, or a dry scroll pump backing a turbomolecular pump.  There are other combinations depending on the level of vacuum being sought.

Achieving high vacuum is difficult because all of the materials exposed to the vacuum must be carefully evaluated for their [[outgassing]] and [[vapor pressure]] properties. For example, oils, [[grease (lubricant)|grease]]s, and [[rubber]] or [[plastic]] [[gasket]]s used as [[seal (mechanical)|seal]]s for the vacuum chamber must not [[Boiling point|boil]] off when exposed to the vacuum, or the gases they produce would prevent the creation of the desired degree of vacuum. Often, all of the surfaces exposed to the vacuum must be baked at high temperature to drive off [[adsorption|adsorbed]] gases.

Outgassing can also be reduced simply by [[desiccation]] prior to vacuum pumping.
High vacuum systems generally require metal chambers with metal gasket seals such as Klein flanges or ISO flanges, rather than the rubber gaskets more common in low vacuum chamber seals. The system must be clean and free of organic matter to minimize outgassing. All materials, solid or liquid, have a small vapour pressure, and their outgassing becomes important when the vacuum pressure falls below this vapour pressure. As a result, many materials that work well in low vacuums, such as [[epoxy]], will become a source of outgassing at higher vacuums.
With these standard precautions, vacuums of 1 mPa are easily achieved with an assortment of molecular pumps. With careful design and operation, 1 µPa is possible.

Several types of pumps may be used in sequence or in parallel. In a typical pumpdown sequence, a positive displacement pump would be used to remove most of the gas from a chamber, starting from atmosphere (760 [[Torr]], 101 kPa) to 25 Torr (3 kPa). Then a sorption pump would be used to bring the pressure down to 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; Torr (10 mPa). A cryopump or turbomolecular pump would be used to bring the pressure further down to 10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt; Torr (1 µPa). An additional ion pump can be started below 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; Torr to remove gases which are not adequately handled by a cryopump or turbo pump, such as [[helium]] or [[hydrogen]].

[[Ultra high vacuum]] generally requires custom-built equipment, strict operational procedures, and a fair amount of trial-and-error. Ultra-high vacuum systems are usually made of [[stainless steel]] with metal-gasketed [[vacuum flange]]s. The system is usually baked, preferably under vacuum, to temporarily raise the vapour pressure of all outgassing materials in the system and boil them off. If necessary, this outgassing of the system can also be performed at room temperature, but this takes much more time. Once the bulk of the outgassing materials are boiled off and evacuated, the system may be cooled to lower vapour pressures to minimize residual outgassing during actual operation. Some systems are cooled well below room temperature by [[liquid nitrogen]] to shut down residual outgassing and simultaneously cryopump the system.

In ultra-high vacuum systems, some very odd leakage paths and outgassing sources must be considered. The water absorption of [[aluminium]] and [[palladium]] becomes an unacceptable source of outgassing, and even the absorptivity of hard metals such as stainless steel or [[titanium]] must be considered. Some oils and greases will boil off in extreme vacuums. The porosity of the metallic [[vacuum chamber]] walls may have to be considered, and the grain direction of the metallic flanges should be parallel to the flange face.

The impact of molecular size must be considered. Smaller molecules can leak in more easily and are more easily absorbed by certain materials, and molecular pumps are less effective at pumping gases with lower molecular weights. A system may be able to evacuate nitrogen (the main component of air) to the desired vacuum, but the chamber could still be full of residual atmospheric hydrogen and helium. Vessels lined with a highly gas-permeable material such as [[palladium]] (which is a high-capacity [[hydrogen]] sponge) create special outgassing problems.

==Applications==
Vacuum pumps are used in many industrial and scientific processes including composite plastic moulding processes, production of most types of [[lighting|electric lamps]], [[vacuum tube]]s, and [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]]s where the device is either left evacuated or re-filled with a specific gas or gas mixture, [[semiconductor]] processing, notably [[ion implantation]], dry etch and PVD, ALD, PECVD and CVD deposition and so on in [[photolithography]], [[Electron microscope|electron microscopy]], medical processes that require suction, [[uranium enrichment]], medical applications such as [[radiotherapy]], [[radiosurgery]] and [[radiopharmacy]], analytical instrumentation to analyse gas, liquid, solid, surface and bio materials, [[mass spectrometer]]s to create a high vacuum between the ion source and the detector, vacuum coating on glass, metal and plastics for decoration, for durability and for energy saving, such as [[low-emissivity]] glass, hard coating for engine components (as in [[Formula One]]), ophthalmic coating, [[milking machine]]s and other equipment in dairy sheds, vacuum impregnation of porous products such as wood or electric motor windings, air conditioning service (removing all contaminants from the system before charging with refrigerant), trash compactor,{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} [[vacuum engineering]], [[sewage system]]s (see EN1091:1997 standards), [[freeze drying]], and [[Fusion power|fusion]] research. In the field of oil regeneration and rerefining, vacuum pumps create a low vacuum for oil dehydration and a high vacuum for oil purification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Speight|first1=James|last2=Exall|first2=Douglas|title=Refining Used Lubricating Oils|date=2014|publisher=[[CRC Press]]|location=Boca Raton|isbn=9781466551503|ref=RefiningOil}}&lt;/ref&gt; Especially in the field of transformer maintenance, vacuum pumps play an essential role in transformer oil purification plants which are used to extend the lifetime of transformers in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vacuum transformer oil purification plants|url=http://www.hering-vpt.de/eok-oil-purifying-plants/|publisher=Hering-VPT GmbH|accessdate=6 Jul 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vacuum may be used to power, or provide assistance to mechanical devices.  In hybrid and [[diesel engine]] [[motor vehicle]]s, a pump fitted on the engine (usually on the [[camshaft]]) is used to produce vacuum.  In [[petrol engine]]s, instead, vacuum is typically obtained as a side-effect of the operation of the engine and the flow restriction created by the [[throttle]] plate, but may be also supplemented by an electrically operated vacuum pump to boost braking assistance or improve fuel consumption.  This vacuum may then be used to power the following motor vehicle components:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hellahd.com/index.php/default/electrics/universal-electric-vacuum-pumps/electrics-product-11/|publisher=Hella|title=UP28 Universal Electric Vacuum Pump|accessdate=14 Jun 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[vacuum servo]] booster for the [[hydraulic brakes]], motors that move [[zone damper|damper]]s in the ventilation system, [[throttle]] driver in the [[cruise control]] [[servomechanism]], door locks or trunk releases.

In an [[aircraft]], the vacuum source is often used to power [[gyroscope]]s in the various [[flight instrument]]s.  To prevent the complete loss of instrumentation in the event of an [[Electricity|electrical]] failure, the instrument panel is deliberately designed with certain instruments powered by electricity and other instruments powered by the vacuum source.

== Hazards ==
Old vacuum-pump oils that were produced before circa 1980 often contain a mixture of several different dangerous [[polychlorinated biphenyl|polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)]], which are highly [[toxic]], [[carcinogenic]], [[persistent organic pollutant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Martin G Broadhurst | title=Use and replaceability of polychlorinated biphenyls | journal=Environmental Health Perspectives | volume=2 |date=October 1972 | pages=81–102 | doi=10.2307/3428101 | pmid=4628855 | pmc=1474898 | jstor=3428101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=C J McDonald | author2=R E Tourangeau | last-author-amp=yes | title=PCBs: Question and Answer Guide Concerning Polychlorinated Biphenyls | publisher=Government of Canada: Environment Canada Department | date=1986 | isbn=978-0-662-14595-0 | url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/wmd-dgd/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=AD2C1530-1&amp;offset=3&amp;toc=show | accessdate=2007-11-07 | df= }}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Western Gulf coastal grasslands''' are a [[tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands|subtropical grassland]] [[ecoregion]] of the southern [[United States]] and northeastern [[Mexico]]. It is known in Louisiana as the '''"Cajun Prairie"''', Texas as '''"Coastal Prairie,"''' and as the '''Tamaulipan pastizal''' in Mexico.

==Setting==
The ecoregion covers an area of {{convert|77425|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, extending along the shore of the [[Gulf of Mexico]] from southeastern [[Louisiana]] (west of the [[Mississippi Delta]]) through [[Texas]] and into the Mexican state of [[Tamaulipas]] as far as the [[Laguna Madre (Mexico)|Laguna Madre]]. Specific areas include a number of [[barrier island]]s, and the ''[[Resaca (channel)|resacas]]'' or natural [[levee]]s of the Laguna Madre.&lt;ref name="WWF"&gt;{{WWF ecoregion |id=na0701 |name=Western Gulf coastal grasslands|accessdate=2010-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coast is vulnerable to tropical storms that can seriously damage habitats.&lt;ref name="WildWorld"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nationalgeographic.com/wildworld/profiles/terrestrial/na/na0701.html |title=Western Gulf coastal grasslands (NA0701) |work=WildWorld Ecoregion Profiles |publisher=National Geographic Society |accessdate=2010-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This ecosystem is edaphic in origin; the soils in this region are of a heavy clay that contributed to difficulty for woody species to establish, allowing grasses and herbaceous species to be more competitive.&lt;ref&gt;http://gulfcoast.harc.edu/Biodiversity/PrairieHabitat/CoastalPrairie/tabid/2285/Default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;The region name, though, is a bit of a misnomer. It is not a wide open, treeless prairie; instead, the grassy areas are broken up by many pockets/groves of forest, usually along water courses, or isolated silt/sand pockets among the substrate (where the soil is more permissive for tree growth).&lt;ref&gt;https://tpwd.texas.gov/education/hunter-education/online-course/wildlife-conservation/texas-ecoregions&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate==
From Louisiana west to the Upper Texas coast, the climate of the region is wet [[humid subtropical climate|humid subtropical]], featuring high annual rainfall. The climate becomes more arid going down the Texas coast, and into Northeastern Mexico, though precipitation totals still remain high enough for humid subtropical classification.

==Flora==
The natural habitat of the area is a mix of [[tallgrass prairie]] similar to those found in inland Texas, with Indiangrass (''[[Sorghastrum nutans]]''), big bluestem (''[[Andropogon gerardi]]''), little bluestem (''[[Schizachyrium scoparium]]''), and switchgrass (''[[Panicum virgatum]]'') the primary tallgrass species that are typical of the coastal prairie, with several other [[Shortgrass prairie|shorter grasses]] and many [[Herbaceous plant|herbaceous]] and [[Woody plant|woody]] species. 

In addition, the region has bottomland forests lining the floodplains of the many waterways in the region. In the wetter regions along the upper Texas coast and Louisiana, the tree species include many of those seen in forest of the [[Southern United States]], such as the [[Quercus virginiana|southern live oak]], [[Taxodium distichum|bald cypress]], [[Pinus taeda|loblolly pine]], [[Quercus stellata|post oak]], and [[Celtis laevigata|southern hackberry]].

The southern third of the Texas stretch and all of the Tamaulipan portion contains shrubby areas of honey mesquite (''[[Prosopis glandulosa]]''), huisache ([[Vachellia farnesiana var. farnesiana|''Vachellia farnesiana'' var. ''farnesiana'']]), lime prickly-ash (''[[Zanthoxylum fagara]]''), and Texas persimmon (''[[Diospyros texana]]'').&lt;ref name="WWF"/&gt;

==Fauna==
This coast is rich in wildlife, and 700 species of birds, animals and reptiles have been counted here, although many are now threatened or endangered. This coast is a critical habitat for the [[Attwater's prairie chicken]]s (''Tympanuchus cupido attwateri''), over one million of which inhabited the prairie in Texas and Louisiana in the 19th century, but extreme reduction of their habitat put them on the U.S. [[Endangered Species Preservation Act of 1966|endangered species list]] in 1967. Another endangered bird of the coast is the [[whooping crane]] (''Grus americana'') while other birds include [[least grebe]], [[Morelet’s seedeater]] (''Sporophila morelleti''), [[red-billed pigeon]] (''Columba flavirostris''), [[brown jay]] (''Cyanocorax morio''), [[Neotropic cormorant]], [[white-winged dove]] (''Leptotila verrequxi'') and [[Audubon's oriole]] (''Icterus graduacauda'').

Mammals of the area include ocelot (''[[Leopardus pardalis]]''), [[Gulf Coast jaguarundi]] (''Puma yagouaroundi cacomitli''), [[southern yellow bat]] (''Lasiurus ega''), [[Mexican spiny pocket mouse]] (''Liomys irroratus''), [[bobcat]]s, [[collared peccary]] and [[eastern cottontail]]s. Rancho Nuevo beach in Tamaulipas and along the Texas coast are the only two nesting sites in the world for the [[Kemp's ridley]] sea turtle (''Lepidochelys kempii'') while other herpetofauna of the ecoregion include Río Grande chirping frog (''[[Eleutherodactylus cystignathoides]]'') and Mexican white-lipped frog (''[[Leptodactylus fragilis]]'').

==Threats and preservation==
Less than 1% of the ecoregion remains in pristine condition, almost entirely in Texas, while most of the coast has been converted to farmland, including rice paddies, grazing land, or urban areas including [[Houston, Texas]]. Estuaries and other coastal wetlands are better preserved than the prairie and indeed the protected areas of the coast are mainly sanctuaries for waterbirds.

A '''whistler''' is a [[very low frequency]] or VLF [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic (radio) wave]] generated by [[lightning]].&lt;ref name=RAH1965&gt;{{cite book|title=Whistlers and Related Ionospheric Phenomena|author=[[Robert Helliwell|Robert A. Helliwell]]|publisher=[[Dover Publications|Dover Publications, Inc]]|year=2006|isbn=978-0-486-44572-4}} Originally published by Stanford University Press, Stanford, California (1965).&lt;/ref&gt; Frequencies of terrestrial whistlers are 1&amp;nbsp;[[kHz]] to 30&amp;nbsp;kHz, with a maximum amplitude usually at 3&amp;nbsp;kHz to 5&amp;nbsp;kHz.  Although they are electromagnetic waves, they occur at [[Audio frequency|audio frequencies]], and can be converted to audio using a suitable receiver. They are produced by lightning strikes (mostly intracloud and return-path) where the impulse travels along the Earth's magnetic field lines from one hemisphere to the other. They undergo [[Dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] of several kHz due to the slower velocity of the lower frequencies through the [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] environments of the [[ionosphere]] and [[magnetosphere]].  Thus they are perceived as a descending tone which can last for a few seconds. The study of whistlers categorizes them into Pure Note, Diffuse, 2-Hop, and Echo Train types.

[[Voyager 1]] and 2 spacecraft detected whistler-like activity in the vicinity of [[Jupiter]], implying the presence of lightning there.

==Source==

The pulse of electromagnetic energy of a lightning discharge producing whistlers contains a wide range of frequencies below the electron cyclotron frequency. Due to interactions with free electrons in the ionosphere, the waves becomes highly dispersive and like guided waves, follow the lines of geomagnetic field. These lines provide the field with sufficient focusing influence and prevents the scattering of field energy.Their paths reach into the outer space as far as 3 to 4 times the Earth's radius in the plane of equator and bring energy from lightning discharge to the Earth at a point in the opposite hemisphere which is the magnetic conjugate of the position of radio emission for whistlers. From there, the whistler waves are reflected back to the hemisphere from which they started. The energy is almost perfectly reflected from earth surface 4 or 5 times with increase dispersion and diminishing amplitude. Along such long paths the speed of propagation of energy is between c/10 to c/100 and the exact value depends upon frequency.

==History==
Whistlers were probably heard as early as 1886 on long telephone lines, but the clearest early description was by Barkhausen in 1919. In 1953, Storey showed that whistlers originate from lightning discharges.&lt;ref name=RAH1965/&gt;

==Nomenclature==
A type of electromagnetic signal propagating in the [[Earth–ionosphere waveguide]], known as a [[radio atmospheric|radio atmospheric signal or sferic]], may escape the ionosphere and propagate outward into the magnetosphere. The signal is prone to bounce-mode propagation, reflecting back and forth on opposite sides of the planet until totally attenuated. To clarify which part of this hop pattern the signal is in, it is specified by a number, indicating the portion of the bounce path it is currently on.&lt;ref name="SmithAngerami1968"&gt;{{cite journal |first1= R.L. |last1= Smith |first2= J.J. |last2= Angerami |title= Magnetospheric Properties Deduced from OGO 1 Observations of Ducted and Nonducted Whistlers |journal= Journal of Geophysical Research |volume= 73 |issue= 1 |pages= 1 |date= Jan 1, 1968 |doi=10.1029/ja073i001p00001|bibcode= 1968JGR....73....1S }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On its first upward path, it is known as a &lt;code&gt;0&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.  After passing the [[geomagnetic equator]], it is referred to as a &lt;code&gt;1&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.  The + or - sign indicates either upward or downward propagation, respectively.  The numeral represents the half-bounce currently in progress.  The reflected signal is redesignated &lt;code&gt;1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, until passing the geomagnetic equator again; then it is called &lt;code&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and so on.

== Finding of whistlers ==
Whistlers were first detected during World War 1. On the wide-band spectrogram, the observed characteristic of a whistler is that the tone rapidly descends over a few seconds. This is the origin of the name "whistlers".

The first spectrogram through which people heard the whistlers was taken from a 48 second long nightside plasmaspheric pass on March 26, 1996. These whistlers were seen at a frequency below 1.5 kHz.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://pwg.gsfc.nasa.gov/istp/polar/polar_pwi_descs.html |title= Polar Sound Descriptions: VLF Plasma Waves |publisher= [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] (GSFC) |website= Polar, Wind, Geotail Science Data (PWG) |access-date= 2016-06-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
