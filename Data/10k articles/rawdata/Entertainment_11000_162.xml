[[File:Twelve Angry Men Trailer.theora.ogv|thumb|245px|Film trailer]]

'''''12 Angry Men''''' is a 1957 American [[legal drama|courtroom drama film]] adapted from a [[Twelve Angry Men (Westinghouse Studio One)|teleplay of the same name]] by [[Reginald Rose]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Variety Film Reviews|Variety]]'' film review; February 27, 1957, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Harrison's Reports and Film Reviews|Harrison's Reports]]'' film review; March 2, 1957, page 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Written and co-produced by Rose and directed by [[Sidney Lumet]], this [[trial film]] tells the story of a [[jury]] made up of 12 men as they deliberate the conviction or acquittal of a defendant on the basis of [[reasonable doubt]], forcing the jurors to question their morals and values. In the United States, a verdict in most criminal trials by jury must be unanimous. The film is notable for its almost exclusive use of one set: out of 96 minutes of run time, only three minutes take place outside of the jury room.

''12 Angry Men'' explores many techniques of consensus-building and the difficulties encountered in the process among a group of men whose range of personalities adds intensity and conflict. It also explores the power one person has to elicit change. No names are used in the film; the jury members are identified by number until two members exchange names at the end. The defendant is referred to as "the boy" and the witnesses as "the old man" and "the lady across the street". The film forces the characters and audience to evaluate their own self-image through observing the personality, experiences, and actions of the jurors.

In 2007, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".&lt;ref name="12AngryMen1957film-r1" /&gt; The film was selected as the second-best courtroom drama ever by the American Film Institute during their AFI's 10 Top 10 list&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | publisher = [[American Film Institute]] | title = AFI's 10 Top 10 Courtroom Drama | date = 2008-06-17 | url = http://www.afi.com/10top10/category.aspx?cat=9 | accessdate=2014-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the highest courtroom drama on [[Rotten Tomatoes]]' Top 100 Movies of All Time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/top/bestofrt/|title = Top 100 Movies of All Time|publisher = [[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=2014-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
In a [[New York City]] [[New York County Courthouse|courthouse]] a jury commences deliberating the case of an 18-year-old boy&lt;ref&gt;http://www.umass.edu/legal/Hilbink/250/12Angry.pdf, see page 8 of PDF&lt;/ref&gt; from a slum, on trial for allegedly stabbing his father to death. If there is any [[reasonable doubt]] they are to return a verdict of not guilty. If found guilty, the boy will receive a death sentence.

In a preliminary vote, all jurors vote "guilty" except Juror 8, who argues that the boy deserves some deliberation. This irritates some of the other jurors, who are impatient for a quick deliberation, especially Juror 7 who has tickets to the evening's [[New York Yankees|Yankees]] game, and 10 who demonstrates blatant prejudice against people from slums. Juror 8 questions the accuracy and reliability of the only two witnesses, and the prosecution's claim that the murder weapon, a common switchblade (of which he possesses an identical copy), was "rare". Juror 8 argues that reasonable doubt exists and that he, therefore, cannot vote "guilty", but concedes that he has merely [[Hung jury|hung the jury]].

Juror 8 suggests a secret ballot, from which he will abstain, and agrees to change his vote if the others unanimously vote "guilty". The ballot is held and a new "not guilty" vote appears. An angry Juror 3 accuses Juror 5, who grew up in a slum, of changing his vote out of sympathy towards slum children. However, Juror 9 reveals it was he that changed his vote, agreeing there should be some discussion. Juror 8 argues that the noise of a passing train would have obscured the verbal threat that one witness claimed to have heard the boy tell his father "I'm going to kill you". Juror 5 then changes his vote. Juror 11 also changes his vote, believing the boy would not likely have tried to retrieve the murder weapon from the scene if it had been cleaned of fingerprints.

Jurors 5, 6 and 8 question the witness' claim to have seen the defendant fleeing 15 seconds after hearing the father's body hit the floor since he was physically incapable of reaching an appropriate vantage point in time due to a stroke. An angry Juror 3 shouts that they are losing their chance to "burn" the boy. Juror 8 accuses him of being a [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] "public avenger", which causes Juror 3 to nearly attack Juror 8. Jurors 2 and 6 then change their votes, tying the vote at 6–6. Shortly after, a [[thunderstorm]] begins, which will cancel Juror 7's baseball game.

Juror 4 doubts the boy's alibi of being at the movies, because he could not recall it in much detail. Juror 8 tests how well Juror 4 remembers previous days, which he does, with difficulty. Juror 2 questions the likelihood that the boy, who was almost a foot shorter than his father, could have inflicted the downward stab wound found in the body.  Jurors 3 and 8 then conduct an experiment to see whether a shorter person could stab downwards on a taller person. The experiment proves the possibility but Juror 5 then steps up and demonstrates the correct way to hold and use a switchblade, revealing that anyone skilled with a switchblade, as the boy would be, would always stab underhanded at an upwards angle against an opponent who was taller than them, as the grip of stabbing downwards would be too awkward and the act of changing hands too time consuming.

Increasingly impatient, Juror 7 changes his vote to hasten the deliberation, which earns him the ire of other jurors (especially 11) for voting frivolously; still he insists, unconvincingly, that he actually thinks the boy is not guilty. Jurors 12 and 1 then change their votes, leaving only three dissenters: Jurors 3, 4 and 10. Juror 10 then vents a torrent of condemnation of slum-born people, claiming they are no better than animals who kill for fun. Most of the others turn their backs to him, with Juror 4 finally telling Juror 10 to be quiet. Juror 8 reminds the rest that personal prejudice can cloud judgments. When the remaining "guilty" voters are pressed to explain themselves, Juror 4 states that, despite all the previous evidence, the woman from across the street who saw the killing still stands as solid evidence. Juror 12 then reverts his vote, making the vote 8–4.

Juror 9, seeing Juror 4 rub his nose (which is being irritated by his glasses), realizes that the woman who allegedly saw the murder had impressions in the sides of her nose, indicating that she probably wears glasses, but did not wear them in court out of vanity. Other jurors, most notably Juror 1, confirm that they saw the same thing. Juror 8 adds that she would not have been wearing them while trying to sleep, and points out that on her own evidence the attack happened so swiftly that she wouldn't have had time to put them on. Jurors 12, 10 and 4 then change their vote to "not guilty", leaving only Juror 3. Juror 3 gives a long and increasingly tortured string of arguments, building on earlier remarks that his relationship with his own son is deeply strained, which is ultimately why he wants the boy to be guilty. He finally loses his temper and tears up a photo of him and his son, but suddenly breaks down crying and changes his vote to "not guilty", making the vote unanimous. Outside, Jurors 8 and 9 finally exchange names, and all of the jurors descend the courthouse steps to return to their individual lives.

==Production==
[[Reginald Rose]]'s screenplay for ''12 Angry Men'' was initially produced for television (starring [[Robert Cummings]] as Juror 8), and was broadcast live on the [[CBS]] program ''[[Studio One (CBS series)|Studio One]]'' in September 1954. A complete [[kinescope]] of that performance, which had been missing for years and was feared lost, was discovered in 2003. It was staged at [[Chelsea Studios]] in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wDpSaPkSt-8C&amp;pg=PA231|title=New York: The Movie Lover's Guide: The Ultimate Insider Tour of Movie New York|first=Richard|last=Alleman|publisher=Broadway Books|date=February 1, 2005|page=231|ISBN=978-0-7679-1634-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of the television production resulted in a film adaptation. [[Sidney Lumet]], whose prior directorial credits included dramas for television productions such as ''[[The Alcoa Hour]]'' and ''[[Studio One (CBS series)|Studio One]]'', was recruited by Henry Fonda and Rose to direct. ''12 Angry Men'' was Lumet's first feature film, and the only producing credit for Fonda and Rose. Fonda later stated that he would never again produce a film.

The filming was completed after a short but rigorous rehearsal schedule, in less than three weeks, on a tight budget of $340,000 ({{Inflation|US|340000|1957|r=-3|fmt=eq}}).

At the beginning of the film, the cameras are positioned above eye level and mounted with [[wide-angle lens]]es, to give the appearance of greater depth between subjects, but as the film progresses the [[focal length]] of the lenses is gradually increased. By the end of the film, nearly everyone is shown in closeup, using [[telephoto lens]]es from a lower angle, which decreases or "shortens" [[depth of field]]. Lumet stated that his intention in using these techniques with cinematographer [[Boris Kaufman]] was to create a nearly palpable [[claustrophobia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playhousesquare.org/bbuzz/12angrymen/d-evolution.html |title=Evolution of TWELVE ANGRY MEN |website=Playhouse Square |archivedate=January 6, 2009 |accessdate=September 11, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106012115/http://www.playhousesquare.org/bbuzz/12angrymen/d-evolution.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Initial response===
On its first release, ''12 Angry Men'' received critical acclaim. [[A. H. Weiler]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, "It makes for taut, absorbing, and compelling drama that reaches far beyond the close confines of its jury room setting." His observation of the twelve men was that "their dramas are powerful and provocative enough to keep a viewer spellbound."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9f02e3de1730e23bbc4d52dfb266838c649ede&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=Twelve%20Angry%20Men%20(1957)%20Movie%20Review&amp;st=cse|title=''Twelve Angry Men (1957)'' Movie Review|work=The New York Times|date=April 15, 1957|accessdate=August 28, 2011|first=A.H.|last=Weiler}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called it an "absorbing drama" with acting that was "perhaps the best seen recently in any single film,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |date=February 27, 1957 |title=12 Angry Men |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |page=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Philip K. Scheuer of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' declared it a "tour de force in movie making,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Scheuer |first=Philip K. |date=April 11, 1957 |title=Audience Sweats It Out—Literally—With Jury |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |at=Part II, p. 13 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]]'' deemed it "a compelling and outstandingly well handled drama,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |date=June 1957 |title=Twelve Angry Men |magazine=[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]] |volume=24 |issue=281 |page=68 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John McCarten]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' called it "a fairly substantial addition to the celluloid landscape."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=McCarten |first=John |date=April 27, 1957 |title=The Current Cinema |magazine=[[The New Yorker]] |page=66 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the film was a [[box office bomb|box office disappointment]].&lt;ref name="filmsite"&gt;[http://www.filmsite.org/twelve.html ''12 Angry Men'' Filmsite Movie Review.] [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] [[Filmsite.org|FilmSite]].

Retrieved April 14, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The advent of color and widescreen productions may have contributed to its disappointing box office performance.&lt;ref name="filmsite" /&gt; It was not until its first airing on television that the movie finally found its audience.&lt;ref&gt;''Beyond a Reasonable Doubt: Making 12 Angry Men'' Featurette on Collector's Edition DVD&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy===
The film is viewed as a classic, highly regarded from both a critical and popular viewpoint: [[Roger Ebert]] listed it as one of his "Great Movies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20020929/REVIEWS08/209290301/1023 |title=''12 Angry Men'' Movie Reviews, Pictures |work=Chicago Sun-Times |accessdate=August 17, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100913153843/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20020929%2FREVIEWS08%2F209290301%2F1023 |archivedate=September 13, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Film Institute]] named Juror 8, played by [[Henry Fonda]], 28th [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes &amp; Villains|in a list of the 50 greatest movie heroes of the 20th century]].

==Cultural influences==
Speaking at a screening of the film during the 2010 [[Fordham University Law School]] Film festival, [[Supreme Court Justice]] [[Sonia Sotomayor]] stated that seeing ''12 Angry Men'' while she was in college influenced her decision to pursue a career in law. She was particularly inspired by immigrant Juror 11's monologue on his reverence for the American justice system. She also told the audience of law students that, as a lower-court judge, she would sometimes instruct juries to not follow the film's example, because most of the jurors' conclusions are based on speculation, not fact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

| accessdate =October 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sotomayor noted that events such as Juror 8 entering a similar knife into the proceeding; performing outside research into the case matter in the first place; and ultimately the jury as a whole making broad, wide-ranging assumptions far beyond the scope of reasonable doubt (such as the inferences regarding the woman wearing glasses) would not be allowed in a real life jury situation, and would in fact have yielded a [[mistrial (law)|mistrial]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nycourts.gov/cji/1-General/CJI2d.Jury_Admonitions.pdf |title=Jury Admonitions In Preliminary Instructions (Revised May 5, 2009)1 |format=PDF |accessdate=June 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (assuming, of course, that applicable law permitted the content of jury deliberations to be revealed).

The movie has had a number of adaptations. A 1963 German TV production ("Die Zwölf Geschworenen") was directed by Günter Gräwert, while a 1991 homage by [[Kōki Mitani]], ''Juninin no Yasashii Nihonjin'' ("12 gentle Japanese"), posits a Japan with a jury system and features a group of Japanese people grappling with their responsibility in the face of Japanese cultural norms.  The 1987 Indian film ''[[Ek Ruka Hua Faisla]]'' ("a pending decision") is a remake of the film, with an almost identical storyline.  Russian director [[Nikita Mikhalkov]] also made a 2007 adaptation, ''[[12 (2007 film)|12]]''.  A 2015 Chinese adaptation, ''[[12 Citizens]]'', follows the plot of the original 1957 American movie, while including characters reflecting contemporary Beijing society, including a cab driver, guard, businessman, policeman, a retiree persecuted in a 1950s' political movement, and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/12-citizens-shanghai-review-804416|title='12 Citizens' Shanghai Review|first=Deborah|last=Young|publisher=Hollywood Reporter|date=2015-06-23|accessdate=2015-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The detective drama television show ''[[Veronica Mars]]'', which like the film includes the theme of class issues, featured an episode, "[[One Angry Veronica]]", in which the title character is selected for jury duty. The episode flips the film's format and depicts one holdout convincing the jury to ''convict'' the privileged defendants of assault against a less well-off victim, despite their lawyers initially convincing 11 jury members of a not guilty verdict.

In 1997, a television remake of the film [[12 Angry Men (1997 film)|under the same title]] was directed by [[William Friedkin]] and produced by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. In the newer version, the judge is a woman and four of the jurors are Black, but the overall plot remains intact. Modernizations include not smoking in the jury room, changes in references to pop culture figures and income, references to execution by lethal injection as opposed to the electric chair, more race-related dialogue and profanity.

The film has also been subject to parody. In 2015, the [[Comedy Central]] TV series ''[[Inside Amy Schumer]]'' aired a half-hour parody of the film titled "12 Angry Men Inside Amy Schumer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vulture.com/2015/05/amy-schumer-12-angry-men-pictures.html |title= Behold Inside Amy Schumer's Dead-On ''12 Angry Men''

''[[The Flintstones]]'' story "Disorder in the Court" and ''[[The Simpsons]]'' story "[[The Boy Who Knew Too Much (The Simpsons)|The Boy Who Knew Too Much]]" similarly feature the respective patriarchs of both families playing holdout jurors. ''[[Family Guy]]'' paid tribute to the film with its Season 11 episode titled "[[12 and a Half Angry Men]]", and ''[[King of The Hill]]'' acknowledged the film with their parody "Nine Pretty Darn Angry Men" in season 3. Sitcom ''Happy Days'' also features a similar story in the season 5 episode "Fonzie for the Defense", when Howard Cunningham and Fonzie are picked for a jury, and Fonzie is the lone hold-out for innocence, swaying the rest of the jury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0596193/|title="Happy Days" Fonzie for the Defense (TV Episode 1978)|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Saturday Night Live'' parodied the film in 1984 in a sketch called First Draft Theater. The American TV situation comedy, [[The Odd Couple (1970 TV series)|''The Odd Couple'']], starring Jack Klugman (juror 5 in the movie), satirizes the film in "The Jury Story".

'''''2012''''' is a 2009 American [[epic film|epic]] [[Science fiction film|science fiction]] [[disaster film]] directed by [[Roland Emmerich]] and starring [[John Cusack]], [[Chiwetel Ejiofor]], [[Amanda Peet]], [[Oliver Platt]], [[Thandie Newton]], [[Danny Glover]] and [[Woody Harrelson]]. The film was produced by [[Centropolis Entertainment]] and distributed by [[Columbia Pictures]].&lt;ref name="2012AFI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/DetailView.aspx?s=&amp;Movie=65014|work=[[American Film Institute]]|title=2012|accessdate=May 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Filming, originally planned for [[Los Angeles]], began in [[Vancouver]] in August 2008.&lt;ref name="cusack" /&gt; The plot follows novelist Jackson Curtis as he attempts to bring his family to safety amid a worldwide [[geology|geological]] [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|disaster]]. The film refers to [[Mayanism]] and the [[2012 phenomenon]] in its portrayal of cataclysmic events.

After a lengthy advertising campaign which included the creation of a website from its main character's point of view&lt;ref name="atlantis" /&gt; and a [[viral marketing]] website on which filmgoers could register for a lottery number to save them from the ensuing disaster,&lt;ref name="first" /&gt; ''2012'' was released internationally on November&amp;nbsp;13,&amp;nbsp;2009. Critics gave the film mixed reviews, praising its [[special effect]]s and dark tone relative to Emmerich's other work and criticizing its screenplay and length. It was a commercial success and one of 2009's highest-grossing films.

==Plot==
&lt;!-- PER WP: FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS. --&gt;
In 2009, [[United States|American]] geologist Adrian Helmsley visits astrophysicist Satnam Tsurutani in [[India]] and learns that [[neutrino]]s from a huge [[solar flare]] are heating [[Inner core|Earth's core]]. Helmsley presents his information to [[White House Chief of Staff]] Carl Anheuser, who brings him to meet the [[President of the United States|president]].

The following year, U.S. President Thomas Wilson and other world leaders begin a secret project to ensure the survival of humanity. [[China]] and the [[G8]] nations begin building nine arks, each capable of carrying 100,000 people, in the [[Himalayas]] near Cho Ming, [[Tibet]]. Nima, a [[Tibetan Buddhism|Buddhist]] monk, is evacuated and his brother Tenzin joins the ark project. Funding is raised by selling tickets at [[Euro|€]]1&amp;nbsp;billion per person. By 2011, articles of value are moved to the arks &lt;!-- STOP! THE FILM MENTIONS THAT THE ART IS BEING SHIPPED TO THE ALPS, BUT THAT'S JUST A COVER STORY. THEIR DESTINATION IS THE ARKS. --&gt; with the help of art expert and [[First Family of the United States|First Daughter]] Laura Wilson.

In 2012, struggling Los Angeles science-fiction writer Jackson Curtis is a chauffeur for Russian billionaire Yuri Karpov. Jackson's former wife Kate and their children Noah and Lilly live with Kate's boyfriend, plastic surgeon and pilot Gordon Silberman. Jackson takes Noah and Lilly camping in [[Yellowstone National Park]]. When they find an area fenced off by the [[United States Army|Army]], Jackson and his children climb over the fence. They are caught and brought to Adrian, who has read Jackson's books. After they are released they meet conspiracy theorist Charlie Frost, who hosts a radio show from the park.

That night, after the military evacuates Yellowstone, Jackson watches Charlie's video of [[Charles Hapgood]]'s theory that [[polar shift]]s and the [[Mesoamerican Long Count calendar]] predict a [[2012 phenomenon]] and the end of the world as we know it. According to Charlie, anyone who attempted to inform the public was killed. Soon after Jackson and his children return home, earthquakes begin in California; Jackson heeds Charlie's warning, and rents a private plane. He rescues his family as the [[Pole shift hypothesis|Earth-crust displacement]] begins, causing a 10.9 magnitude earthquake, and Jackson and his family escape from [[Los Angeles]] by air as the city collapses and sinks into the [[Pacific Ocean]], killing millions of residents. 

They fly to Yellowstone to retrieve a map from Charlie with the arks' location. As they leave, the [[Yellowstone Caldera]] erupts; Charlie is killed when he stays behind to cover the eruption. The group lands in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] to find a larger plane and meet Yuri, his twin sons Alec and Oleg, his girlfriend Tamara and their pilot Sasha. Sasha and Gordon fly them out in an [[List of fictional aircraft#Commercial|Antonov An-500]]&lt;!-- STOP! THE PLANE IS CLEARLY SHOWN ONSCREEN AS BEING A FICTIONAL 500 AND NOT THE REAL LIFE 250. http://www.cinesargentinos.com.ar/noticia/1860-avion-de-cinesargentinos-com-en-2012/ --&gt; as the Yellowstone ash cloud envelops [[Las Vegas]]. An attempted refueling stop in [[Hawaii]] is abandoned after seeing the islands consumed by flows of lava as a result of the erupting volcanos.

Adrian, Carl, and Laura fly to the arks on [[Air Force One]]. Knowing that his daughter will survive, President Wilson remains in Washington, D.C. to address the nation for the last time while millions of people die in [[earthquakes]] and [[megatsunamis]] worldwide, including himself. With the [[United States presidential line of succession|presidential line of succession]] gone, Carl assumes the position of acting commander-in-chief.

When Jackson's group reaches [[China]], their plane runs out of fuel. Sasha continues flying the plane as the others escape on a [[Bentley Continental Flying Spur (2005)|Bentley Continental Flying Spur]] stored in the cargo hold. Sasha is killed when the plane crashes, and the others are spotted by [[People's Liberation Army Air Force|Chinese Air Force]] helicopters. Yuri and his sons (who have tickets) are brought to the arks and the Curtis family, Tamara and Gordon are left behind as Sasha and Tamara were having an affair. The remaining group is picked up by Nima and brought to the arks with his grandparents. With Tenzin's help, they stow away on Ark 4, where the U.S. contingent is located. As a megatsunami breaches the Himalayas and approaches the site, an [[impact driver]] lodges in the ark-door gears. This keeps a boarding gate open, which prevents the ship's engines from starting. In the ensuing chaos, Yuri, Tamara, and Gordon are killed. Tenzin is injured, the ark begins filling with water and is set adrift. Jackson and Noah dislodge the tool and the crew regains control of the Ark before it strikes [[Mount Everest]]. Jackson is reunited with his family and reconciles with Kate.

Twenty-seven days later, the waters are receding. The arks approach the [[Cape of Good Hope]], where the [[Drakensberg]] (now the tallest mountain range on Earth) is emerging. Adrian and Laura begin a relationship, and Jackson and Kate rekindle their romance.

===Alternate ending===
An alternate ending appears in the film's DVD version. After Captain Michaels (the Ark 4 captain) announces that they are heading for the Cape of Good Hope, Adrian learns by phone that his father (Harry) is still alive. Harry tells him that he, Tony (whose arm is in a sling) and some passengers and crew survived the megatsunami which struck the Genesis, and Captain Michaels says that they should soon see the ocean liner. Kate thanks Laura for taking care of Lily, and Laura tells Jackson that she enjoyed his book. Jackson returns Noah's cell phone, which he recovered during the Ark 4 flood. Lily says that she sees an island, and the ark finds the shipwrecked Genesis and her survivors on a beach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/exclusive-video-watch-the-alternate-ending-for-2012|title=EXCLUSIVE VIDEO: Watch the Alternate Ending for ‘2012’!|author=B.

A number of studios heard a budget projection and story plans from Emmerich and his representatives, a process repeated by the director after ''[[Independence Day (1996 film)|Independence Day]]'' (1996) and ''[[The Day After Tomorrow]]'' (2004).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Michael | last=Fleming | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117981155.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1 | title=Studios vie for Emmerich's ''2012'' | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | publisher=| date=February 19, 2014 | accessdate=July 14, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''2012'' was marketed by the fictional Institute for Human Continuity, featuring a book by Jackson Curtis (''Farewell Atlantis''),&lt;ref name="atlantis" /&gt; [[streaming media]], [[blog|blog updates]] and [[radio|radio broadcasts]] from [[Zealotry|zealot]] Charlie Frost on his website, ''This Is The End''.&lt;ref name="atlantis" /&gt; On November&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2008, the studio released the first trailer for ''2012''. With a [[tsunami]] surging over the [[Himalayas]] and a purportedly-scientific message that the world would end in 2012, the trailer's message was that international governments were not preparing their populations for the event. The trailer ended with a suggestion to viewers to "find out the truth" by entering "2012" on a search engine. ''[[The Guardian]]'' called the film's marketing "deeply flawed", associating it with "websites that make even more spurious claims about 2012".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Pickard | first=Anna | url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/nov/25/2012-ronald-emmerich | title=''2012'': a cautionary tale about marketing | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=November 25, 2014 | accessdate=December 10, 2008 | location=London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090122074947/http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2008/nov/25/2012-ronald-emmerich| archivedate=January 22, 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The studio introduced a [[viral marketing]] website operated by the Institute for Human Continuity, where filmgoers could register for a lottery number to be part of a small population which would be rescued from the global destruction.&lt;ref name="first"&gt;{{cite news | last=Billington | first=Alex | url=http://www.firstshowing.net/2008/11/15/roland-emmerichs-2012-viral-institute-for-human-continuity/ | title=Roland Emmerich's ''2012'' Viral — Institute for Human Continuity | work=FirstShowing.net | date=November 15, 2012 | accessdate=December 10, 2014 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081220133933/http://www.firstshowing.net/2008/11/15/roland-emmerichs-2012-viral-institute-for-human-continuity/| archivedate=December 20, 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Morrison of [[NASA]], who received over 1,000 inquiries from people who thought the website was genuine, condemned it. "I've even had cases of teenagers writing to me saying they are contemplating suicide because they don't want to see the world end", Morrison said. "I think when you lie on the internet and scare children to make a buck, that is ethically wrong."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/relax-the-end-isnt-nigh-1804340.html |title=Relax, the end isn't nigh |last=Connor|first=Steve |date=October 17, 2015 |work=The Independent |accessdate=October 20, 2015 | location=London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091020091758/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/relax-the-end-isnt-nigh-1804340.html| archivedate=October 20, 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another marketing website promoted ''Farewell Atlantis'', the fictional novel about the events of 2012.&lt;ref name="atlantis"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://farewellatlantis.com/ | title=Farewell Atlantis by Jackson Curtis – Fake website | publisher=[[Sony Pictures]] | accessdate=June 30, 2013| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110710224325/http://farewellatlantis.com/| archivedate=July 10, 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Comcast]] organized a "roadblock campaign" to promote the film in which a two-minute scene was broadcast on 450 American commercial television networks, local English-language and Spanish-language stations, and 89 cable outlets during a ten-minute window between 10:50 and 11:00&amp;nbsp;pm [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern]] and [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific Time]] on October&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;2009.&lt;ref name="2012block"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118009036.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1&amp;nid=2562 |title=Sony readies 'roadblock' for 2012 |last=Graser|first=Mark |date=September 23, 2009 |work=Variety |accessdate=September 29, 2015| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091011065817/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118009036.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1&amp;nid=2562| archivedate=October 11, 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scene featured the destruction of Los Angeles and ended with a cliffhanger, with the entire 5:38 clip available on Comcast's Fancast website. According to ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', "The stunt will put the footage in front of 90% of all households watching ad-supported TV, or nearly 110&amp;nbsp;million viewers. When combined with online and mobile streams, that could increase to more than 140&amp;nbsp;million".&lt;ref name="2012block" /&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] praised ''2012'', giving it {{frac|3|1|2}} stars out of 4 and saying that it "delivers what it promises, and since no sentient being will buy a ticket expecting anything else, it will be, for its audiences, one of the most satisfactory films of the year".&lt;ref name="ebert1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20091111/REVIEWS/911119994 |title=''2012'' :: rogerebert.com |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |author=Ebert, Roger |date=November 12, 2009 |accessdate=November 14, 2009 |authorlink=Roger Ebert |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091115111837/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20091111%2FREVIEWS%2F911119994 |archivedate=November 15, 2009 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ebert and Claudia Puig of ''[[USA Today]]'' called the film the "mother of all disaster movies".&lt;ref name="ebert1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/reviews/2009-11-13-2012rev13_ST_N.htm |title='2012': Now that's Armageddon! |work=USA Today |author=Puig, Claudia |date=November 13, 2009|accessdate=November 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; But [[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' compared it to ''[[Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen]]'': "Beware ''2012'', which works the dubious miracle of almost matching ''Transformers 2'' for sheer, cynical, mind-numbing, time-wasting, money-draining, soul-sucking stupidity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/25457899/review/30842785/2012 |title=''2012'': Review |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |author=Travers, Peter |date=November 12, 2009 |accessdate=November 12, 2009 |authorlink= Peter Travers| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091115093733/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/25457899/review/30842785/2012| archivedate=November 15, 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===North Korean ban===
[[North Korea]] reportedly banned the possession or viewing of ''2012''. The year was the 100th [[Day of the Sun|anniversary of the birth]] of the nation's founder, [[Kim Il-sung]], and was designated as "the year for opening the grand gates to becoming a rising superpower"; a film depicting the year negatively was deemed offensive by the North Korean government. Several people in North Korea were reportedly arrested for possessing (or viewing) imported copies of ''2012'' and charged with "grave provocation against the development of the state".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.asahi.com/english/TKY201003250328.html |title=Watching '2012' a no-no in N.

==Canceled television spin-off==
{{Anchor|Sequel}}
In 2010 ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' reported a planned spin-off television series, ''2013'', which would have been a sequel to the film.&lt;ref name="ewee"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hollywoodinsider.ew.com/2010/03/02/abc-passes-2012-tv-show |title=ABC passes on '2012' TV show |publisher=''Entertainment Weekly'' |date=March 2, 2010 |accessdate=July 3, 2014 |author=Rice, Lynette |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101017150120/http://hollywoodinsider.ew.com/2010/03/02/abc-passes-2012-tv-show/ |archivedate=October 17, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''2012'' executive producer [[Mark Gordon]] told the magazine, "ABC will have an opening in their disaster-related programming after ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' ends, so people would be interested in this topic on a weekly basis. There's hope for the world despite the magnitude of the 2012 disaster as seen in the film. After the movie, there are some people who survive, and the question is how will these survivors build a new world and what will it look like. That might make an interesting TV series."&lt;ref name="ewee" /&gt; However, plans were later canceled for budgetary reasons.&lt;ref name="ewee" /&gt; It would have been Emmerich's third film to spawn a spin-off; the first was ''[[Stargate (film)|Stargate]]'' (followed by ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'', ''[[Stargate Infinity]]'', ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]'', ''[[Stargate Universe]]''), and the second was ''[[Godzilla (1998 film)|Godzilla]]'' (followed by the animated ''[[Godzilla: The Series]]'').

'''''Alhambra''''' ({{lang-de|'''Der Palast von Alhambra'''}}, literally "The Palace of the Alhambra") is a [[2003 in games|2003]] [[Tile-based game|tile-based]] [[German-style board game]] [[Game designer|designed]] by [[Dirk Henn]]. It was originally published in [[Germany]] by [[Queen Games]] in a language-interdependent version; an English-specific version was released in [[North America]] by the now-defunct [[Überplay]]. The game is an [[Arab World|Arabian]]-themed update, set during the construction of the [[Alhambra]] palace in 14th century [[Granada]], of the 1998 [[Stock exchange|stock trading]] board game ''Stimmt So!'', which in turn was an update of the 1992 [[mafia]] influence board game ''Al Capone''; the original version was subsequently released as ''[[Alhambra: The Card Game]]''.

''Alhambra'' won the [[Spiel des Jahres]] award, the [[Schweizer Spielepreis]] for Family Games, the [[As d'Or]] and the [[Essen Feather]] for the year of its release and placed second in the [[Deutscher Spiele Preis]]. Its success has led to the release of numerous [[expansion pack]]s and [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] games, and is becoming Queen Games' flagship franchise.

==Gameplay==
The game consists of a deck of "currency cards" of various values in four [[Currency|currencies]] ([[Suit (cards)|suits]]) and a bag of "building tiles" of various prices, as well as a number of boards (a currency market, a building market, a reserve board for each player and a scoring track). Six of the building tiles are "Alhambra tiles"; these are taken out of the bag and one is given to each player. Each player is then dealt currency cards until the total value of cards in their hand is greater than or equal to twenty. The currency cards are shuffled into five piles, and the two special scoring cards are inserted into the second and fourth piles. The five piles are then placed in order to form the currency deck. Four currency cards are drawn and placed on the currency market, and four building tiles are drawn and placed on the four spaces of the building market. The set of tiles connected to a player's Alhambra tile is called their "Alhambra."

Players then take turns, during which they may perform one of the following actions:
*'''Draw currency cards''' – either one card of any value or multiple cards totalling five or less.
*'''Buy building tiles''' – by discarding currency cards totalling the value of the tile or greater.  Each space on the building market has a currency type next to it; all cards discarded must be of that suit.  If the value of cards discarded exactly equals the price of the tile, the player gets another action.  Tiles must be placed in the reserve board or attached to their Alhambra (players do not have to place tiles in the order they were purchased however).
*'''Move a building tile''' – either from their reserve board to their Alhambra, from their Alhambra to their reserve board, or swap two tiles (one from their reserve and one currently in their Alhambra).
Currency cards and Building tiles are then added to any spaces on the Currency market or the Building market.

Some tiles have walls along one or more edges.  When players add tiles to their Alhambra, it must be possible to trace a path from the new tile to the fountain that was their start tile, remaining within tiles and without crossing any walls. It is also not permitted to create "holes" such that all four sides of a gap are closed in.

When the scoring cards are drawn from the Currency deck, or when there are fewer than four buildings remaining to be sold, scoring occurs.  Each player scores one point for each wall segment in their longest wall. The player with the most of a given building card type scores points according to that type; in case of a tie, points are split between players.  More common building types are worth more points, and building types are worth more points in later scoring rounds.  In the final scoring round, the player with the most of a given currency type takes the tile of that currency type and may add it to their Alhambra before scoring.

==Expansions==
Due to the original game's popularity, there are, as of 2013, six expansion packs, termed "extensions," to ''Alhambra'', each of which adds four "modules" to the game. These modules may be played together or separately and modules may be combined from different expansions. The extensions are designed by both [[Dirk Henn]] and [[Wolfgang Panning]] and are named for one of its modules. These are, in order of release:
# '''''The Vizier's Favor''''' (''Die Gunst des Wesirs,'' 2004)
#*''Winning the Vizier's Favor'' introduces a [[vizier]] for each player. The vizier may be used to play out of turn. A player's vizier may be brought back into play by skipping their turn.
#*''The [[Bureau de Change]]'' introduces special cards to the deck.  These special cards allow players to mix currencies when buying tiles.
#*''The Bonus Cards'' introduces cards which are given out to each player at the start of the game. The cards grant its player a bonus if they possess the tile on the card in their Alhambra.
#*''The Worker's Hut'' introduces worker hut tiles. Worker hut tiles are free for the taking, but ends a player's turn.  They score only if other tiles of the same colour are adjacent.
# '''''The City Gates''''' (''Die Tore der Stadt,'' 2004)
#*''The City Gates'' introduces six [[city gate]]s and six city gate cards to the deck. A player may during their turn pick up a city gate card, which allows them to, at a later point in time, place a city gate. City gates, which are placed on walls, allow buildings to be separated by walls while still being accessible - as if the wall did not exist.
#*''The Diamonds'' introduces a new currency into the game: diamonds. Diamonds may be used in place of any currency when buying tiles but may not be combined with other currencies when doing so.
#*''The Camps'' introduces eight camp tiles, which are bought as with other buildings. However, camps must be separated from the city by a wall, and may not be adjacent to each other if there is a wall in the way. Camps score points for every building tile in the direction of its walls.
#*''The Characters'' adds ten character cards representing persons. These character cards, once uncovered, are immediately auctioned off to the highest bidder and grant the winning player different abilities, some of which are used once, some of which may be used repeatedly.
# '''''The Thief's Turn''''' (''Die Stunde der Diebe'', 2005)
#*''The City Walls'' adds eight city wall cards to the deck, which allows the player to add wall segments to tiles without them. Walls added in this manner, however, cannot be removed for the remainder of the game, and may not have city gates built on them.
#*''The Thieves'' adds 12 thief cards, which are given to the players at the start of the game. A player may play a thief card between turns (except before their own turn) and take a currency card matching the type of thief card played.
#*''The Change'' adds coins to the game.  Whenever a player overpays for a building, half of the difference is refunded in coins of random currencies.  Coins are worth one unit of their particular currency, and may be used with cards to buy buildings.
#*''The Street Trader'' adds traders and circular trader tiles. Trader tiles are given to each player at the start of the game, and are placed adjacent to any tile.  If a player builds in the location of the trader tile, they may place a trader of a matching colour from the trader tile to the building (or exchange a trader for one of another color), and the trader tile is moved.  There are three traders on the trader tile at any given time.  Points are awarded based on the number of traders in building tiles.
# '''''The Treasure Chamber''''' (''Die Schatzkammer des Kalifen'', literally "The Caliphs' Treasury," 2006)
#*''The Treasure Chamber'' adds treasure chests to the game.  There are three treasure chambers, each containing four chests.  At any point in the game players may buy the chests in one chamber, and place the chests on buildings in their Alhambra matching the colour of the chests.  Players gain additional points for the number of chests in their Alhambra.
#*''The Master Builders'' adds Master Builder cards, which are given to players at the start of the game.  Master Builder cards may be used either as currency or may be discarded to move a building tile.
#*''The Invaders'' adds invasion cards and scout cards to the game.  Whenever scoring occurs, an invasion card is drawn.  Players lose points for each building tile on the edge of their Alhambra without a wall in the direction specified by the invasion card.  Scout cards may be used to look into the next invasion card, and may be taken whenever a building of the same type is bought.
#*''The Bazaars'' adds [[bazaar]] tiles to the game. Bazaars, when drawn, are placed next to the building market, and may be bought (with exact change only) for the same price as the building of the corresponding currency type being sold.  Bazaars score only in the final round of play, and score a point for each adjacent or diagonal building matching the colours on the bazaar.
# '''''The Power of Sultan''''' (''Die Macht des Sultans'', 2008)
#*''The Caravanserai'' adds special Caravanserai cards to the game.  Each player may buy up to two Caravanserai (which cost less if their Alhambra is more diverse).  Caravanserai cards provide income to the player, and appreciates in value the longer they are unused.
#*''The Art of the Moorish'' adds culture counters to the game.  Culture counters are obtained when a player builds at least two buildings of the same cost.  During a player's turn, a player may choose to develop culture, in addition to the existing actions.  Victory points are awarded during normal scoring based on the number of times that culture was developed as well as the number of buildings of the same cost that has been built.
#*''The new Score Cards'' changes the relative score values of the six basic types of buildings in each of the three scoring phases.
#*''The Power of Sultan'' adds Sultan cards to the game.  Sultan cards may be bought as with any other building.  Once bought, a special die is rolled, and the building type corresponding to the rolled value (or the building type opposite to this value) is marked.  When a new building is drawn, players who have marked the particular type of building may use the Sultan card to immediately claim the tile and use it.
# '''''The Falconers''''' (''Die Falkner'', 2013)
#*''The Falconers'': players can now purchase and place falcons on intersections of four buildings in their Alhambra. The magnificent birds of prey will certainly delight their owners – with victory points.
#*''The Portals'': portals offer players new ways to build their walls and gain even more victory points for them, especially if they are part of their longest contiguous wall.
#*''The Building Sites'': allows players to purchase and place buildings for half price. Its walls are completed instantly but the building itself will only score once it's finished.
#*''The Exchange Certificates'': if a player overpays for a purchase he gains a voucher for the amount he overpaid in a currency of his choice.

==Promo Expansion==
The promo expansion/module "The Magic Buildings" adds 6 magic building tiles to the game. When drawn, these tiles can be placed to score extra points depending on their surrounding tiles.
The promo expansion/module "The Medina Buildings" adds 9 Medina building tiles to the game. During the scoring rounds, they award "negative" points to the player with the fewest of these tiles in his/her Alhambra.

== Spin-offs ==
The success of ''Alhambra'' has also led Henn to release or re-release some other games under the ''Alhambra'' name and [[Moors|Moorish]] theme:
*''The Gardens of the Alhambra'' (''Die Gärten der Alhambra'', 2004) is an updated version of the tile-laying board game ''[[Carat (board game)|Carat]]'', originally released in a more abstract form by db Spiele in 1993.
*''Troisdorf'' (2005) is a limited, re-themed edition of ''Alhambra'', with identical rules, set in and only sold in [[Troisdorf]], the town in which Queen Games is based.
*''Alhambra: The Dice Game'' (''Alhambra: Das Würfelspiel'', 2006) is a [[Dice game|die-rolling game]], broadly similar in play to ''[[Yahtzee]]''.

'''Archetypal literary criticism''' is a type of [[critical theory]] that interprets a text by focusing on recurring [[mythology|myths]] and archetypes (from the Greek ''archē'', "beginning", and ''typos'', "imprint") in the [[narrative]], [[symbols]], [[image]]s, and character types in literary work. As a form of literary criticism, it dates back to 1934 when [[Maud Bodkin]] published ''[[Archetypal Patterns in Poetry]]''.

Archetypal literary criticism's origins are rooted in two other academic disciplines, [[social anthropology]] and [[psychoanalysis]]; each contributed to literary criticism in separate ways, with the latter being a sub-branch of critical theory. Archetypal criticism was at its most popular in the 1940s and 1950s, largely due to the work of Canadian literary critic [[Northrop Frye]]. Though archetypal literary criticism is no longer widely practiced, nor have there been any major developments in the field, it still has a place in the tradition of literary studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Devika|first1=S.|title=Archetypal Criticism|url=https://drdevika.wordpress.com/2016/11/02/archetypal-criticism/|website=Dr. S.

==Origins==

===Frazer===
The anthropological origins of archetypal criticism can pre-date its analytical psychology origins by over 30 years. ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' (1890–1915), written by the Scottish anthropologist [[Sir James George Frazer]], was the first influential text dealing with cultural mythologies. Frazer was part of a group of comparative anthropologists working out of [[Cambridge University]] who worked extensively on the topic. ''The Golden Bough'' was widely accepted as the seminal text on myth that spawned numerous studies on the same subject. Eventually, the momentum of Frazer's work carried over into literary studies.

In ''The Golden Bough'' Frazer identifies practices and mythological beliefs shared among primitive religions and modern religions. Frazer argues that the death-rebirth myth is present in almost all cultural mythologies, and is acted out in terms of growing seasons and vegetation. The myth is symbolized by the death (i.e., final harvest) and rebirth (i.e., spring) of the god of vegetation. As an example, Frazer cites the Greek myth of [[Persephone]], who was taken to the [[Underworld]] by [[Hades]]. Her mother [[Demeter]], the goddess of the harvest, was so sad that she struck the world with fall and winter. While in the underworld [[Persephone]] ate six of the twelve pomegranate seeds given to her by Hades; consequently, she was forced to spend half the year, from then on, in the Underworld, representative of autumn and winter, or the death in the death-rebirth myth.  The other half of the year Persephone was permitted to be with Demeter in the mortal realm, which represents spring and summer, or the rebirth in the death-rebirth myth.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

===Jung===
While Frazer's work deals with mythology and archetypes in material terms, the work of [[Carl Gustav Jung]], the Swiss-born founder of analytical psychology, is, in contrast, immaterial in its focus. Jung's work theorizes about myths and archetypes in relation to the [[Collective unconscious|unconscious]], an inaccessible part of the mind. From a Jungian perspective, myths are the "culturally elaborated representations of the contents of the deepest recess of the human psyche: the world of the archetypes" (Walker 4).

Jungian analytical psychology distinguishes between the personal and [[collective unconscious]], the latter being particularly relevant to archetypal criticism. The collective unconscious, or the [[objective psyche]] as it is less frequently known, is a number of innate thoughts, feelings, instincts, and memories that reside in the unconsciousness of all people. Jung's definition of the term is inconsistent in his many writings. At one time he calls the collective unconscious the "a priori, inborn forms of intuition" (Lietch 998), while in another instance it is a series of "experience(s) that come upon us like fate" (998). Regardless of the many nuances between Jung's definitions, the collective unconsciousness is a shared part of the unconscious.

To Jung, an archetype in the collective unconscious, as quoted from Leitch et al., is "irrepresentable, but has effects which make visualizations of it possible, namely, the archetypal images and ideas" (988), due to the fact they are at an inaccessible part of the  mind. The archetypes to which Jung refers are represented through primordial images, a term he coined. Primordial images originate from the initial stages of humanity and have been part of the collective unconscious ever since. It is through primordial images that universal archetypes are experienced, and more importantly, that the unconscious is revealed.

With the same death-rebirth myth that Frazer sees as being representative of the growing seasons and agriculture as a point of comparison, a Jungian analysis envisions the death-rebirth archetype as a "symbolic expression of a process taking place not in the world but in the mind. That process is the return of the [[Ego, super-ego, and id|ego]] to the unconscious—a kind of temporary death of the ego—and its re-emergence, or rebirth, from the unconscious" (Segal 4).

By itself, Jung's theory of the collective unconscious accounts for a considerable share of writings in archetypal literary criticism; it also pre-dates the height of archetypal literary criticism by over a decade. The Jungian archetypal approach treats literary texts as an avenue in which primordial images are represented. It would not be until the 1950s when the other branch of archetypal literary criticism developed.

===Frye===
Bodkin's ''Archetypal Patterns in Poetry'', the first work on the subject of archetypal literary criticism, applies Jung's theories about the collective unconscious, archetypes, and primordial images to literature. It was not until the work of the Canadian literary critic [[Northrop Frye]] that archetypal criticism was theorized in purely literary terms. The major work of Frye's to deal with archetypes is ''[[Anatomy of Criticism]]''
but his essay "The Archetypes of Literature" is a precursor to the book. Frye's thesis in "The Archetypes of Literature" remains largely unchanged in ''Anatomy of Criticism''. Frye's work helped displace [[New Criticism]] as the major mode of analyzing literary texts, before giving way to [[structuralism]] and [[semiotics]].

Frye's work breaks from both Frazer and Jung in such a way that it is distinct from its anthropological and psychoanalytical precursors. For Frye, the death-rebirth myth, that Frazer sees manifest in agriculture and the harvest, is not ritualistic since it is involuntary, and therefore, must be done. As for Jung, Frye was uninterested about the collective unconscious on the grounds of feeling it was unnecessary: since the unconscious is unknowable it cannot be studied. How archetypes came to be was also of no concern to Frye; rather, the function and effect of archetypes is his interest. For Frye, literary archetypes "play an essential role in refashioning the material universe into an alternative verbal universe that is humanly intelligible and viable, because it is adapted to essential human needs and concerns" (Abrams 224-225).

There are two basic categories in Frye's framework, comedic and tragic. Each category is further subdivided into two categories: [[comedy]] and [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]] for the comedic; [[tragedy]] and [[satire]] (or ironic) for the tragic. Though he is dismissive of Frazer, Frye uses the seasons in his archetypal schema. Each season is aligned with a literary genre: comedy with spring, romance with summer, tragedy with autumn, and satire with winter.

Comedy is aligned with spring because the genre of comedy is characterized by the birth of the hero, revival and [[resurrection]]. Also, spring symbolizes the defeat of winter and darkness. Romance and summer are paired together because summer is the culmination of life in the seasonal calendar, and the romance genre culminates with some sort of triumph, usually a marriage. Autumn is the dying stage of the seasonal calendar, which parallels the tragedy genre because it is, above all, known for the "fall" or demise of the protagonist. Satire is [[Metonymy|metonymized]] with winter on the grounds that satire is a "dark" genre; satire is a disillusioned and mocking form of the three other genres. It is noted for its darkness, dissolution, the return of chaos, and the defeat of the heroic figure.

Summer – Romance. The birth of the hero.
Autumn – Tragedy. Movement towards the death or defeat of the hero.
Winter – Irony/Satire. The hero is absent. 
Spring – Comedy. The rebirth of the hero.

The context of a genre determines how a symbol or image is to be interpreted. Frye outlines five different spheres in his schema: human, animal, vegetation, mineral, and water. The comedic human world is representative of wish-fulfillment and being community centred. In contrast, the tragic human world is of isolation, tyranny, and the fallen hero. Animals in the comedic genres are docile and pastoral (e.g. sheep), while animals are predatory and hunters in the tragic (e.g. wolves). For the realm of vegetation, the comedic is, again, pastoral but also represented by gardens, parks, roses and lotuses. As for the tragic, vegetation is of a wild forest, or as being barren. Cities, a temple, or precious stones represent the comedic mineral realm. The tragic mineral realm is noted for being a [[desert]], [[ruins]], or "of sinister geometrical images" (Frye 1456). Lastly, the water realm is represented by rivers in the comedic. With the tragic, the seas, and especially [[floods]], signify the water sphere.

Frye admits that his schema in "The Archetypes of Literature" is simplistic, but makes room for exceptions by noting that there are neutral archetypes. The example he cites are islands such as [[Circe]]'s or [[Prospero]]'s which cannot be categorized under the tragic or comedic.

==Other contributors==
Maud Bodkin wrote ''Archetypal Patterns in Poetry'' in 1934, applying the ideas of Jung to poetry, and examining archetypes such as the ancient mariner and rebirth, heaven and hell, images of the devil, the hero and God. 
Bodkin book.

In his 1949 book ''Hero with a Thousand Faces'', [[Joseph Campbell]] pioneered the idea of the ‘monomyth' (though the term was borrowed from James Joyce), a universal pattern in heroic tales across different cultures and genres. His deep examination of the eight step hero's journey (and the common variations that exist) had a huge impact on the Abstract Expressionists of the 1950s, and continues to inspire creative artists today.

==Theory critiques==
It has been argued that Frye's version of archetypal criticism strictly categorizes works based on their genres, which determines how an archetype is to be interpreted in a text. According to this argument the dilemma Frye's archetypal criticism faces with more [[contemporary literature]], and that of [[post-modernism]] in general, is that genres and categories are no longer distinctly separate and that the very concept of genres has become blurred, thus problematizing Frye's schema. For instance [[Samuel Beckett|Beckett]]'s ''[[Waiting For Godot]]'' is considered a [[tragicomedy]], a play with elements of tragedy and satire, with the implication that interpreting textual elements in the play becomes difficult as  the two opposing seasons and conventions that Frye associated with genres are pitted against each other. But in fact arguments about generic blends such as tragicomedy go back to the [[Renaissance]], and Frye always conceived of genres as fluid. Frye thought literary forms were part of a great circle and were capable of shading into other generic forms. (He contemplated including a diagram of his wheel in ''[[Anatomy of Criticism]]'' but thought better of it.)Myth and archetype deals with origin of literary.

== Examples of archetypes in literature ==
* [[Femme fatale|Femme Fatale]]: A female character type who brings upon catastrophic and disastrous events. [[Adam and Eve|Eve]] from the story of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] or [[Pandora]] from Greek mythology are two such figures.
* The Journey: A narrative archetype where the protagonist must overcome a series of obstacles before reaching his or her goal. The quintessential journey archetype in Western culture is arguably [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]''.

Archetypal symbols vary more than archetype narratives or character types. The best archetypal pattern is any symbol with deep roots in a culture's mythology, such as the [[forbidden fruit]] in Genesis or even the poison apple in [[Snow White]]. These are examples of symbols that resonate with archetypal critics.

Archetypes reveal shared roles among universal societies. This archetype may create a shared imaginary which is defined by many stereotypes that have not separated themselves from the traditional, biological, religious and mythical framework.

==Plot==

=== Season 1 ===
The series is told through a fictional [[vlog]] broadcast by Laura Hollis ([[Elise Bauman|Bauman]]), a freshman studying journalism who has decided to document her college experience. When her roommate Betty (Glowicki) suddenly goes missing at a swim team party, Laura is assigned a new roommate, Carmilla Karnstein (Negovanlis), whom Laura describes as "broody."

Laura, aided by her friends, discovers that her former roommate is not the only girl to have abruptly gone missing from Silas. The season follows Laura's investigation and her relationship with Carmilla, which progresses from hostile to romantic over the course of the season.

=== Story between seasons ===
Between the first and second seasons, series story editor [[Ellen Simpson]] published additional story content. Canon Twitter accounts under Laura, Carmilla, and LaFontaine's names relay the group's encounters with supernatural Styrian dangers while trying to escape the Silas campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Shaftesbury {{!}} Carmilla|url = http://shaftesbury.ca/carmilla/|website = shaftesbury.ca|accessdate = 2015-12-03|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151208051523/http://shaftesbury.ca/carmilla/#|archive-date = 2015-12-08|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between stories on the Twitter accounts, a Christmas special was released detailing the group's not-so-pleasant encounter with a seemingly-pleasant Mama Klaus.

===Season 2===
The second season begins with Laura, Carmilla, LaFontaine, and Perry's return to the Silas campus. Laura decides to investigate the murder of several members of the newspaper staff. Other strange occurrences on campus draw the attention of Carmilla's sister—a powerful vampire—and the Silas Board of Governors.

New characters include:
* Matska "Mattie" Belmonde (Sophia Walker), Carmilla's adoptive vampiric sister and chair of the Silas Board of Governors.
* Baron Vordenberg (Ian D. Clark), the descendant of a vampire hunter whose family was murdered by Carmilla 300 years prior.
* Melanippe "Mel" Callis ([[Nicole Stamp]]), a sister in the Summer Society.
* Theodore "Theo" Straka (Shannon Kook), a brother in Zeta Omega Mu.

===Season Zero===
A teaser [[Teaser campaign|trailer]] announcing this season was released on October 1, 2015. This season consisted of twelve episodes instead of in previous, where there was thirty-six episodes. All the episodes except the first episode were released on U by Kotex's YouTube channel.

While Carmilla and Laura are trapped in the library, they watch [[VHS]] tapes that document interactions between Carmilla, Perry, and Mel while they are trapped in a room where U by Kotex brand tampons are stored. These events occur a year before Laura is a student at Silas University.

===Season 3===
The series was renewed for a third and final season on February 13, 2016. It premiered on September 15, 2016 and finished on October 13, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/kimberly-clark-scores-hit-video-series-with-carmilla-1472464800|title=Kimberly-Clark Scores Hit Video Series With 'Carmilla'|last=Shields|first=Mike|date=2016-08-29|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|issn=0099-9660|access-date=2016-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This season's episodes were released differently than in previous seasons. Season three was released in three acts with several episodes released within each act. Act I consisted of episodes 1-17, Act II was episodes 18-24, and Act III was episodes 25-36.

Laura and her friends face the Dean yet again, who has now possessed Perry and intends to open the gates of Hell. Laura and her friends spend most their time hiding out in the sentient campus library, that has been mentioned in previous seasons. They are in search of a way, once and for all, to stop the Dean. 
New characters include Sherman Hollis ([[Enrico Colantoni]]), Laura's father.

Extra content from this season includes: Mel's transmissions from the pit. Thirteen podcasts of Mel, detailing the daily life and several different events that happen while the students of Silas University are trapped in the pit digging for the dean.

=== Main characters ===
[[File:Fan Expo Canada 2015 - Embrace (21555023051).jpg|left|thumb|Negovanlis (left) and Bauman (right) at [[Fan Expo Canada|Fan Expo 2015]]]]
* '''Laura Eileen Hollis''' (played by [[Elise Bauman]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://starrymag.com/?p=5133 |title=Interviews - TV. Elise Bauman – Carmilla. |date=9 January 2015 |work=Starrymag.com |accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the sheltered and courageous protagonist. As the series begins, she is a 19-year-old journalism major at Silas. Despite her love of sugary foods, Laura is tiny and, as a child, was signed up for Krav Maga classes by her overprotective father so she, his only child, could learn how to defend herself. Though somewhat bookish and dorky, she is courageous and fiercely loyal to her friends. Laura enjoys various forms of pop culture, including ''[[Harry Potter]]'', ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' and ''[[Doctor Who]]'', and is deeply inspired by historical strong female icons. Laura does not hide her initial dislike towards Carmilla, but as the series progresses and after discovering who Carmilla truly is, she finds herself falling in love with her and the two enter into a relationship by season 2. They break up during that same season, but during season 3 are working towards getting back together. It is implied that Laura does not have a mother; if her family correlates with her character's family in the [[Carmilla|original novella]], Laura's mother died when she was young. Little is known of her past and of Laura herself other than basic facts discovered in season 1, and the fact she is out of the closet as a lesbian, revealed in season 3.
* '''Countess Mircalla "Carmilla" von Karnstein''' (played by [[Natasha Negovanlis]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afterellen.com/people/405049-elise-bauman-natasha-negovanlis-carmilla-talk-fandom-hopes-season-2/2 |title=Elise Bauman and Natasha Negovanlis of "Carmilla" talk fandom and hopes for Season 2. |date=19 December 2014 |work=Afterellen.com |accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is Laura's new roommate and the series' second protagonist. Born in [[Styria]] in 1680 as Mircalla Karnstein, the daughter of a Count, Carmilla was murdered at a ball and resurrected as a vampire, eternally aging her at 18. She is the "adopted" daughter of the Dean of Silas University, Lilita Morgan (also a vampire), who forces Carmilla to bring her girls to offer in sacrifice to the angler fish god in her cult. During the 1800s, Carmilla fell deeply in love with Elle, one of her mother's targets, and tried to prevent her sacrifice. When her mother revealed to Elle that Carmilla is a vampire, however, Elle rejected Carmilla. Carmilla was tortured and buried in a coffin full of blood for several decades, as punishment for disobeying her mother. She was freed during the Second World War when a bomb exploded and unearthed her coffin. Carmilla was eventually found by her mother and forced to continue entrapping girls. She was brought to Silas University and eventually becomes roommates with Laura Hollis, one of her mother's next targets. However, Carmilla becomes passionately drawn to Laura and vows not to let her mother harm her. Carmilla and Laura enter into a relationship by the end of season one, but it falls apart by the end of season 2. In season 3, the couple is working on rebuilding their trust. Carmilla is a strong willed, sarcastic, philosophy student who consistently fails to clean up after herself and often uses Laura's possessions without permission. She possesses supernatural strength and speed, and can transform into a giant black cat.
* '''Danielle "Danny" Lawrence''' (played by [[Sharon Belle]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fempop.com/2014/12/03/carmilla-webseries-lesbian-vampires-creampuffs |title=The Carmilla Webseries: On Lesbian Vampires and Creampuffs. |author=Alex Cranz |date=3 December 2014 |work=Fempop.com |accessdate=24 April 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702074015/http://www.fempop.com/2014/12/03/carmilla-webseries-lesbian-vampires-creampuffs/|archive-date=July 2, 2017|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a third year student and English Literature TA at Silas. She is a member of the Summer Society at the university and has a strong will to protect those she cares about. Danny is athletic and charming; from their first meeting she shows a romantic interest in Laura, which appeared to be returned; as season one progresses, however, Laura finds Danny's over-protectiveness to be suffocating and reminiscent of her father. Danny takes an immediate dislike to Carmilla, finding her to be rude and messy, but tries to hide this for Laura's sake. In Season 2, she and Laura's friendship is repaired and the two work together again. She becomes the Student Representative of the Board of Silas, but is later ostracized by the Summer Society when she protects Kirsch from the other Summers and later joins forces with Laura. During the finale of season 2, she is killed and then resurrected as a vampire under the Dean's orders. Initially, using Kirsch as human feeding bag, she offers him up to Laura and friends as a peace offering towards the end of season three.

They go by their last name, and are quick to correct anyone who calls them 'Susan'. After episode 26, creators and cast confirmed on tumblr that LaFontaine's pronouns are [[Singular they|they/them/their]]. They are a biology major and one of the few characters not put off by the supernatural and strange aspects of Silas University. They are known to be a truth-speaker, being very observant, e.g. LaFontaine was the first to accuse Carmilla of being a vampire and concluded that the house Laura and Carmilla inhabited in Season Two was Carmilla's Mother's. During season 1, they were kidnapped by the Dean as a message to Laura. Laura mentions that she thinks LaFontaine and J.P. are dating, but it is never confirmed by either. In season 3, they clearly explicitly state they are non-binary. They lose an eye in the process of saving Perry from the Dean.
* '''Lola Perry''' (played by [[Annie M. Briggs]])&lt;ref name=DA1/&gt; is a German major at Silas University, LaFontaine's roommate, and Laura and Carmilla's floor don. Regularly referred to as simply 'Perry', she is caring and nurturing, and often mothering her friends and classmates. She has a strong urge for constant order and fiercely believes in normality. She initially refuses to believe that Carmilla is a vampire, coming up with various excuses for Carmilla's strange behavior. She states in the [[Christmas]] Special that she celebrates [[Hanukkah]], making her the only explicitly non-Christian character on the show to date. She's hinted to have feelings for LaFontaine, whom she's known since grade school.  In Season Zero, set in 2012, Perry is shown to have an interest in the occult and new age practices, wearing flowers in her hair. In season 2, she has been possessed by Lilita Morgan, the Dean and Carmilla's adoptive mother, although this only becomes apparent towards the end of the season. She's rescued by Carmilla, Laura and Lafontaine at the end of season 3.
* '''Lilita Morgan''' (played by [[Sharon Belle]], [[Elise Bauman]] and more commonly [[Annie M. Briggs]])&lt;ref name=DA1/&gt; is the Dean of the Silas University and Carmilla's adoptive vampire mother. She is also revealed to be the Goddess [[Inanna]] during Season 3. She initially uses Carmilla to lure young girls to be her human sacrifice for the Angler Fish God. In Season 2, she possesses Perry and uses her in an attempt to open the gates of Hell to reunite with her former lover in Season 3.

Laura mentions that she thinks LaFontaine and J.P. are dating at the end of season one, but this has yet to be confirmed by either of them. During the second season, the library disappears due to Matska taking charge at Silas and so does much of J.P. with it, until LaFontaine manages to bring him to life in Will's body after finding it on a trip to visit the Lustig crater. Due to the fact that the body J.P. inhabited is that of a vampire, he now possesses the same traits and abilities as the aforementioned supernatural. In Season 3, he is retained against his will by the Dean.
* '''Theodore "Theo" Straka''' (played by [[Shannon Kook]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://talknerdywithus.com/2015/07/21/exclusive-interview-with-shannon-kook |title=Exclusive Interview with Shannon Kook. |author=Michelle Rose Micor |date=21 July 2015 |work=talknerdywithus.com|accessdate=21 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a member of the Zeta Omega Mu fraternity and is introduced in the second season.

Mel strives to claim the title of the president of the Summer Society the following year from Danny assuming her budding friendship with the Zetas and interactions with Laura and Carmilla will end up in her demotion once and for all. When Mel plans to kill Kirsch in the Adonis Hunt, Danny stops her, this allows Mel to win the election to become the president of the Summer Society, despite this she still takes orders from Danny who is the Student Representative of the Board of Silas.

Despite this, Mattie often chides Carmilla over her relationship with Laura. When she loses her power as the Chair of the Silas Board to Vordenberg, she becomes a fugitive when Vordenberg orders the detainment of all known vampires. She is eventually killed by Danny, who only got the information to kill her from Laura who gained the information from Carmilla. Her death also sets Carmilla against Laura and the others.

He was killed by Laura at the end of the second season.
* '''Sherman Hollis''' (played by [[Enrico Colantoni]]) is the father of Laura Hollis. He is an overprotective man whose main focus is protecting his daughter of all possible harm.

Elle leaves with Carmilla's mother, and from there is sacrificed to the angler fish god.

She works with Elle Sheridan in hopes that she will finally pass, but is tricked by her. At the end of the movie, she is able to finally pass.

The '''Center for Cartoon Studies (CCS)''' is a [[Two-year college#United States|two year]] institution focusing on [[sequential art]], specifically [[comics]] and [[graphic novel]]s&lt;ref name= "FAQ"&gt;[http://www.cartoonstudies.org/index.php/about/faqs/ About CCS: FAQ's]. The Center for Cartoon Studies. Accessed December 13, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Located in the village of [[White River Junction, Vermont|White River Junction]], in the town of [[Hartford, Vermont|Hartford]], [[Vermont]], the Center offers a [[Master of Fine Arts]] degree, both one and two-year certificate programs, as well as summer programs,&lt;ref name= "Programs"&gt;[http://www.cartoonstudies.org/index.php/programs/ Programs]. The Center for Cartoon Studies. Accessed December 13, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and is "the only college-level training program of its kind in the United States." &lt;ref name= "Magic" &gt;Milliken, Joe. [http://www.vermontguardian.com/culture/042007/CartoonStudies.shtml Just Like Magic]. Vermont Guardian. April 27, 2007. Accessed December 13, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Center for Cartoon Studies was founded by [[cartoonist]] [[James Sturm]] and [[Michelle Ollie]] in 2004, with its first class of 18 students  beginning their schooling in the Fall of 2005.&lt;ref name = "Fact" /&gt; The first class of students were accepted less on the quality of their drawing and more on their [[critical thinking]] skills, literary merit, storytelling abilities and curiosity.&lt;ref&gt;Sturm, James. [http://www.slate.com/id/2114711/entry/2114849/ James Sturm: Entry 2]. [[Slate.com]] Diary. March 15, 2005. Accessed December 13, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Center's first commencement took place on May 19, 2007, with  roughly 20 students graduating.&lt;ref name= "Magic" /&gt; In 2007 CCS was approved by the State of Vermont to award [[Master of Fine Arts]] degrees and certificates, which have been awarded to students from all subsequent classes.&lt;ref name= "NECN" /&gt; It currently has a student body of 48 students with an average age of 24.&lt;ref name="Fact"&gt;[http://www.cartoonstudies.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/ccs_facts_sheet.pdf CCS Factsheet]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. The Center for Cartoon Studies. Accessed December 13, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; About 20 new students are accepted each year.&lt;ref name="NECN"&gt;[http://www.necn.com/Boston/Arts--Entertainment/Center-for-Cartoon-Studies-in-VT/1201143528.html Center for Cartoon Studies in VT] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100120112048/http://www.necn.com/Boston/Arts--Entertainment/Center-for-Cartoon-Studies-in-VT/1201143528.html |date=January 20, 2010 }}. [[New England Cable News]]. January 23, 2008. Accessed December 13, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The school educates students to be proficient in all aspects of [[graphic design]] and production, including self-publication and promotion.  This is a notable step away from the specialized production model of mainstream comics companies such as [[Marvel Comics]] and [[DC Comics]], wherein writing, pencilwork, inking, coloring, and lettering are most often handled by separate individuals.  This inclination is in part due to many of the faculty's and significant donor [[Peter Laird]]'s experience with [[alternative comics]]. The State of Vermont Department of Education approved CCS for degree granting authority and the school is also a member of Vermont Higher Education Council.

== Campus ==
[[File:CCS by Nick Langley.JPG|thumb| The front window of the Center for Cartoon Studies in the former Colodny’s Surprise Department Store.]]
The Center for Cartoon Studies currently operates out of two buildings in the [[White River Junction Historic District|historic district]] of [[White River Junction]], [[Vermont]]. The school rents space in the former Colodny’s Surprise Department Store Building, and in December 2011 the school purchased a former Post Office a few buildings down from Department Store Building. The schools Schulz Library used to be housed in a former fire station on Bridge Street, a building also occupied by the [[Main Street Museum]], but had to be evacuated in August 2011 due to flood waters from [[Hurricane Irene (2011)#Vermont|Hurricane Irene]].&lt;ref name='new home'&gt;Polston, Pamela.

=== Colodny’s Surprise Department Store ===
All the main operational and educational facilities of the Center for Cartoon Studies are located in the former Colodny’s Surprise Department Store Building. Built in 1929, the building is the only [[Art Deco]] building in downtown White River Junction, and is built partially with Antique Verde marble quarried from [[Rochester, Vermont|Rochester]], [[Vermont]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hartford-vt.org/downloads/495 White River Junction Historic District: Historic Tour No. 1 in the Town of Hartford, Vermont] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508180132/http://www.hartford-vt.org/downloads/495 |date=May 8, 2012 }}.

=== Post Office ===
The Former Post office Building in downtown White River Junction was purchased by the school in December 2011. The brick building is constructed in a [[colonial revival]] architectural style and was built in 1934 as a [[Works Progress Administration]] structure. This building will become the main structure for the Center for Cartoon Studies and includes classrooms, faculty offices and lounges, and the Schulz Library. The top floor of the Post Office Building is still rented to the current tenants. It also includes studio space for the Inky Solomon Center, a grant-program geared towards CCS alumni, their comics and community outreach.&lt;ref name='new home' /&gt;

== Schulz Library ==
[[File:White River Junction Former Post office.jpg|thumb|left|Former White River Junction Post Office and future CCS main building]]
The Schulz Library, named after [[Charles M. Schulz]] is the official library of the Center for Cartoon Studies and currently houses over 9,000 titles &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.librarything.com/catalog.php?view=CartoonStudies Member: Cartoon Studies].

Accessed December 13, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; in one room.&lt;ref name= "Dart" /&gt; The Library is currently in storage, but was previously housed in the former Bridge Street firehouse, owned by the [[Main Street Museum]]. The material in the library had to be evacuated in August 2011 due to flood waters from [[Hurricane Irene (2011)#Vermont|Hurricane Irene]]. The Library's collection focuses on [[comic book]]s, [[graphic novel]]s, as well as "books about cartooning – both academic and instructional." The Schulz's collection has grown largely from donations from collectors and publishers, as well as artists.&lt;ref name= "Schulz"&gt;[http://www.cartoonstudies.org/index.php/schulz-library/ Schulz Library].

A '''coupon-eligible converter box''' ('''CECB''') was a [[digital television adapter]] that met eligibility specifications for [[subsidy]] "coupons" from the [[United States government]].  The subsidy program was enacted to provide [[terrestial television|over-the-air]] television viewers with an affordable way to continue receiving free [[digital terrestrial television|digital over-the-air television]] services after the nation's television service [[DTV transition in the United States|transitioned to digital transmission]] and [[analog shutdown|analog transmissions ceased]].  The specification was developed by the [[National Telecommunications and Information Administration]] (NTIA), with input from the broadcast and [[consumer electronics]] industries as well as [[public interest]] groups.

== History ==

=== Early proposals ===
In March 2005, [[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce|United States House Commerce Committee]] chairman [[Joe Barton]] of Texas said he would introduce a bill requiring the transition to digital television "sometime in the spring", saying he wanted analog broadcasting to end on December 31, 2006. Included in his plan was a $400–$500 million subsidy for converter boxes, which were expected to cost $50 each. The subsidies were intended only for people who could not afford a [[Multichannel Video Programming Distributor|pay service]] such as cable or satellite television. Each home would receive a rebate coupon for one box, which could be mailed to the [[United States Treasury]] for redemption. Barton estimated that 8 to 10 million converters would be needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/156484-Barton_Targets_DTV_Bill_for_Spring.php |title=Barton Targets DTV Bill for Spring |work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]] |first=Bill |last=McConnell |date=March 15, 2005 |accessdate=August 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Digital Transition and Public Safety Act of 2005 ===
The United States [[Digital Transition and Public Safety Act of 2005]],  part of the [[Deficit Reduction Act of 2005]], required that the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) direct all full-power television stations to cease [[analog TV]] broadcasting  before midnight on February 17, 2009. (This deadline later changed to June 12.) Recognizing that consumers might wish to continue receiving broadcast programming over-the-air using analog-only televisions, the Act authorized the NTIA to create a digital-to-analog converter box assistance program. [[Consumer education]] plans for the subsidy program were targeted to [[low-income]], [[elderly]], [[disabled]], [[inner city]], immigrant, and rural Americans, because these groups were more likely to use an antenna instead of [[cable television|cable]] or satellite television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-08-1040 | accessdate =June 26, 2011 | title = Digital Television Transition: Implementation of the Converter Box Subsidy Program Is Under Way, but Preparedness to Manage an Increase in Subsidy Demand Is Unclear | work = GAO | publisher = United States Government Accountability Office | date = September 16, 2008 | id = GAO-08-1040 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act also established a new [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury]] fund, known as the Digital Television Transition and Public Safety Fund. It directed the FCC to deposit the receipts from the [[spectrum auction]] of the returned analog television frequencies into the fund.

The Act directed the NTIA to implement and administer a program through which eligible US households could obtain a maximum of two "coupons" (actually [[payment]] [[voucher]]s) of $40 each, to be applied towards the purchase of a digital-to-analog converter box. The Act defines the term ''converter box'' to mean "a stand-alone device that does not contain features or functions except those necessary to enable a consumer to convert any channel broadcast in the digital television service into a format that the consumer can display on television receivers designed to receive and display signals only in the analog television service, but may also include a [[remote control]] device." The Act, however, did not define "eligible household".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=http://www.techpolicyinstitute.org/files/the_dtv_coupon_program.pdf |title=The DTV Coupon Program: A Boon to Retailers, not Consumers |last=Wallsten |first=Scott |date=September 15, 2008 |publisher=Technology Policy Institute |location=Washington, DC |accessdate=June 26, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728083308/http://techpolicyinstitute.org/files/the_dtv_coupon_program.pdf |archivedate=July 28, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of April 2006, 20 million people (some with more than one set) received only over-the-air TV. When the number of people subscribing to [[Multichannel Video Programming Distributor|cable or satellite]] who also had TVs that only used an antenna, an estimated 70 million TVs would need upgrading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/103959-Old_TVs_Steal_Show_at_NAB.php |title=Old TVs Steal Show at NAB |work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]] |first=Glen |last=Dickson |date=April 30, 2006 |accessdate=August 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Implementing the program ===
In 2006, the NTIA let people see its plan for distributing coupons and comment on it.  The plan prohibited people with cable or satellite service from requesting coupons.  In order to get two coupons, consumers had to state that they had two television sets. In an effort to limit misconduct, coupon requests would be only be taken between January 1, 2008 and March 31, 2009; each coupon would be valid for three months. The consumer-education program only had a budget of $5 million, so the companies participating in the transition would have to help.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/93696-Cable_Households_Won_t_Get_Converter_Subsidy.php |title=Cable Households Won't Get Converter Subsidy |work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]] |first=John |last=Eggerton |date=July 24, 2006 |accessdate=August 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 12, 2007, the NTIA held a news conference to announce the standards for the converter boxes and the requirements for receiving coupons. With the standards established, manufacturing could begin and the NTIA could select a company to send out coupons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first= Ira |last = Teinowitz | title = News briefs: Digital TV One Step Closer |journal = Television Week| date= March 12, 2007 | page = 4 | volume = 26 | issue = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With $1.5 billion in funding, the coupons would account for only half of the 73 million analog TVs not using a pay service, including 18 million in homes having only over-the-air TV reception. The [[United States Commerce Department|Commerce Department]] had no plans to make coupons available only to the poor.

Coupons could be requested by phone, mail, or online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/products/2007-03-12-tv-box-coupons_N.htm|title=All in U.S. eligible for TV box coupons|work=USA Today|date=March 13, 2007|accessdate=August 6, 2009 | first=Paul | last=Davidson}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first, anyone would be able to apply, even for those who had one or more TVs connected to cable or satellite.

The NTIA set the standards for the converter box based on what manufacturers and broadcasters wanted. [[LG Electronics]], [[Thomson SA|Thomson]], [[Samsung Group|Samsung]], and [[Jasco Products Company|Jasco]] were the first companies to announce plans to make the devices. After June 1, 2007, retailers could apply to sell converter boxes. Each would have to be in the NTIA's Central Contractor Registration database, and have been in the consumer-electronics business for at least a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Four Suppliers Plan To Build Converter Boxes |journal=TWICE |date=March 26, 2007 |publisher=NewBay Media |location=New York, NY |url=http://www.twice.com/article/250270-Four_Suppliers_Plan_To_Build_Converter_Boxes.php |accessdate=June 26, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406112453/http://www.twice.com/article/250270-Four_Suppliers_Plan_To_Build_Converter_Boxes.php |archivedate=April 6, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:FCC DTV Coupon Card.png|right|thumb|275px|An example of the NTIA converter box $40 subsidy "coupon", which is in the form of a [[ATM card|bank card]] that can only be used as payment for a converter box purchase.]]
To implement the coupon program, the Act authorized NTIA to use up to $990 million from the fund, including $100 million for program administration.  Those funds supported an initial "non-contingent" program that was available to all requesting households. NTIA was also authorized to spend up to $1.5 billion for the program (including $160 million for administration) if the initial $990 million were insufficient to fulfill the non-contingent coupon requests.  In that case, a "contingent" fund would be available for US households not serviced by cable or satellite.&lt;ref name=ntiafinalrule&gt;{{cite report | url = http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/frnotices/2007/DTVFinalRule_2a.htm | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090603214653/http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/frnotices/2007/DTVFinalRule_2a.htm | archivedate = June 3, 2009 | title = Rules to Implement and Administer a Coupon Program for Digital-to-Analog Converter Boxes | docket = 0612242667-7051-01 | author = National Telecommunications and Information Administration | publisher = United States Department of Commerce }}&lt;/ref&gt;  If the funds were insufficient, the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the [[United States Senate|Senate]] would be notified.

An initial funding of $990 million was expected to allow all US households an opportunity to apply for the coupons, which expired 90 days after they were mailed. After that money was used up, $510 million in additional funds was available to households that stated they did not already subscribe to cable or satellite television services. Neither allotment had a [[means test]].&lt;ref name=ntiafinalrule/&gt;

The NTIA planned to start processing coupon requests a year before the original transition date of February 17, 2009; 2.4 million people had applied for 4.7 million coupons, out of an estimated 13 million homes that still received television with an antenna.&lt;ref name=ready&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/112503-Ready_or_Not_Here_Comes_DTV.php|title=Ready or Not, Here Comes DTV|first=John|last=Eggerton|work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]|date=February 18, 2008|accessdate=September 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 2008, the ''New York Times'' said "about 40 million coupons have been requested, but to date 16 million have been redeemed, compared with an estimated 35 million televisions that will lose a signal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/22/technology/22digital.html | title = In Move to Digital TV, Confusion Is in the Air | last = Taub | first = Eric A. | newspaper = The New York Times | location = New York | accessdate =June 26, 2011 | publisher = The New York Times Company | date=December 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Institutions, such as [[retirement home]]s, were initially excluded from the program; while this was partially remedied (to allow one coupon per retirement-home resident),{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} prisons,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26548827 |title=Prisons scramble to make digital TV switch|first =Jim |last=Davenport|work=MSNBC|date=September 4, 2008|accessdate=June 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; homeless shelters&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-coverside1-2009mar01,0,1094570.story |title=Digital TV may bypass skid row|first=Nathan|last= Olivarez-Giles|newspaper= [[Los Angeles Times]]|date= March 1, 2009|accessdate=June 26, 2011|location = Los Angeles}}&lt;/ref&gt; and residential hotels remained disqualified from the coupon program.

On January 4, 2009, the NTIA began placing coupon requests on a [[wikt:waiting list|waiting list]] after the program reached its maximum allowed funding.  Only after unredeemed coupons expire could new requests be fulfilled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hart|first=Kim|title=TV Converter Program Runs Out of Funding|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2009/01/06/ST2009010600089.html|work=The Washington Post|page=D01|date=January 6, 2008|accessdate=January 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; By January 7, NTIA's waiting list included just under a million requested coupons.

On January 7, both [[Consumers Union]] and Representative [[Ed Markey]] of Massachusetts (who headed the [[U.S. House]] [[Energy and Commerce Committee]]’s [[Telecommunication|telecom]] subcommittee) advocated that the February 17, 2009 analog shutoff date be postponed, due to the lack of coupons and NTIA's inability to handle the expected public enquiries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.tvweek.com/news/2009/01/key_congressman_floats_dtvswit.php |title=Key Congressman Floats DTV-Switch Delay |last=Teinowitz |first=Ira |date=January 7, 2009 |journal=TVWeek |publisher=Crain Communications |accessdate=June 26, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308225026/http://www.tvweek.com/news/2009/01/key_congressman_floats_dtvswit.php |archivedate=March 8, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 8, [[Presidential transition of Barack Obama|President-Elect Barack Obama's transition team]] contacted key legislators to express support for a delay, largely because of problems funding coupons for converters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/la-fi-dtv9-2009jan09,0,1586472.story | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20090118214941/http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/la-fi-dtv9-2009jan09,0,1586472.story | archivedate = January 18, 2009 | title = All-digital TV?

== Specifications ==
The NTIA Specification is arranged in three categories, describing required, permitted, and disqualifying features.

=== Absolute requirements ===
[[Image:Converterbox.JPG|thumb|right|A digital TV converter box]]
These features were absolutely required, but varied in the way they are provided by the box.

Coupon-eligible converter boxes had to convert all [[ATSC Standards#Resolution|ATSC (digital) formats]] to the traditional [[NTSC]] analog system used by analog US television sets. The box must output signals both as a [[radio frequency]] output (compatible with a television's antenna input), as well as [[composite video]] and stereo audio outputs. It must include a remote control, and be compatible with [[universal remote]]s.

The units had to support both a [[4:3]] center [[Cropping (image)|crop]] of a [[16:9]] transmitted image, and a [[letterbox]] rendition of a [[16:9]] transmitted image. The video outputs had to produce video at an [[ITU-R]] BT.500-11 [[video quality|quality scale]] of Grade 4 or higher. Various technical performance parameters for the digital tuner were also specified.

The boxes must decode [[Emergency Alert System]] (EAS) messages, [[Closed Captioning]] data,  and [[TV Parental Guidelines|Parental Control]] ([[V-Chip]]) descriptors.  They must decode the [[Program and System Information Protocol]] (PSIP) data from the digital transmission, and use it to provide the user with tuned channel and program information.

CECBs must consume no more than an average of 2 watts of [[Standby power|power when not in use]] (no video or audio display). They must provide an automatic power-down option that can put the unit in standby mode when it has not received any commands for a while.

=== Optional features ===
Manufacturers could self-certify compliance with these requirements, but had to provide test results and two units to the NTIA for ''ad hoc'' testing.  The FCC could also test converter boxes at the NTIA's request.  Among the optional features permitted, but not required, were the following:

* Support for a [[smart antenna]], through the use of the [[CEA-909]] Antenna Control Interface. The manufacturer could optionally provide a promotional package discount for the combination of a smart antenna and a CECB.
* [[Multichannel television sound]] (BTSC) stereo at the RF output.
* [[S-Video]] output.
* [[Analog passthrough]], as needed for [[LPTV]], [[broadcast translator]], and foreign signal reception.
* [[Electronic program guide]]
* [[patch (computing)|Software updates]].
* Support for the [[Television content rating systems#Canadian ratings|Canadian television ratings]] system, allowing the manufacturer to sell the same device in Canada.
* Support for secondary audio channels, such as foreign languages or [[Descriptive Video Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url = http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/consumerfacts/dtvvideodescription.pdf | format = PDF | title = Video Descriptions and the Digital Television Transition | series = FCC Consumer Advisory | author = Consumer &amp; Governmental Affairs Bureau | publisher = Federal Communications Commission | location = Washington, DC | accessdate =June 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While an outdoor antenna is required for adequate digital reception in most locations beyond {{convert|10|–|25|mi|km|0}} from [[TV transmitter]]s, and [[smart antenna]] interfaces were an optionally permitted feature of coupon-eligible converter boxes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.dtv.gov/outreach_article_antennas.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100527171925/http://www.dtv.gov/outreach_article_antennas.html | archivedate = May 27, 2010 | title = Outreach Toolkit—Article: DTV and Antenna | work = DTV.gov | publisher = Federal Communications Commission | location = Washington, DC }}&lt;/ref&gt; there were no subsidies for antennas. Although manufacturers could sell a converter/smart-antenna bundle, they were required to also offer the converter by itself to consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/consumerfacts/dtvantennas.html |title = Antennas and Digital Television | work = FCC.gov | publisher = Federal Communications Commission | author = Consumer and Government Affairs Bureau | accessdate =June 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DTV converter boxes could earn a [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] [[Energy Star]] label if they consume no more than eight watts of electricity while operating, no more than one watt while in [[standby mode]], and if they automatically power-down after four hours of inactivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=dta.pr_dta |title=EPA: energystar.gov |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205045254/http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=dta.pr_dta |archivedate=December 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disqualifying features ===
Some features disqualified a converter box from coupon eligibility, such as  [[High-definition television|high-definition]] video output and built-in [[digital video recorder|DVR]] functionality. [[Digital cable]] and [[direct broadcast satellite|satellite]] [[set-top box]]es that incorporate a digital tuner were also disqualified.

Certain output features were prohibited from coupon-eligible devices: [[component video]], [[Video Graphics Array|VGA]], [[RGB color model|RGB]], [[Digital Visual Interface|DVI]], [[High-Definition Multimedia Interface|HDMI]], [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] video, IEEE-1394/iLink/[[Firewire]] video, [[Ethernet]] video, and IEEE-802.11/[[WiFi]] video outputs.&lt;ref name=ntiafinalrule/&gt;

=== Limitations ===
Coupon-eligible converter boxes only tune to one channel at a time, as they only contain one digital tuner and no analog tuner.  In order to watch one channel while recording another, one must have two such converter boxes, unless the recording device has its own digital TV tuner.

Most [[Videocassette recorder|video recorders]] were also unable to change channels under control of built-in [[timer]]s when using a converter, as channel selection was then handled by the converter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.mercurynews.com/businessheadlines/ci_11692884 | title = With shift to digital TV, how long can VCRs stay afloat? | first = Troy | last = Wolverton | newspaper = San José Mercury News | location = San Jose, CA | date = February 16, 2009 | archiveurl = http://benton.org/node/22185 | archivedate = February 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some converter boxes have a programmable timer, which the user could program to match the recording schedule of their VCR. Then, the converter's tuner will change to the appropriate channel at the time the VCR needs to record. This requires a separate box for the VCR, or the viewer will have to watch what is being recorded.  Another, less common option is an "[[IR blaster]]", which a recorder can use to control an external tuner, like a cable set-top box or converter box.  However, older devices with IR blasters may not be fully compatible with [[digital subchannel]]s; the converter box may require the use of a [-] or [.] button to specify the subchannel, which the pre-digital recorder may not know how to transmit.  Some older [[TiVo]] brand digital recorders received software updates specifically to control digital converter boxes via the TiVo's included IR blaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://support.tivo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/310 | title = Which digital converter boxes for antenna are compatible with my TiVo DVR? | publisher = TiVo | accessdate = June 26, 2011 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140917105103/http://support.tivo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/310 | archivedate = September 17, 2014 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Small battery-operated portable televisions, while valuable in time of [[disaster]], are generally poorly suited to digital conversion. While at least one CECB (Winegard's RCDT09A) is operable from an external battery pack,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://reviews.cnet.com/tv-hdtv-tuners-receivers/winegard-rcdt09a/4505-6487_7-33280760.html | title = Winegard RCDT09A | first =  Matthew | last = Moskovciak | work = CNET Reviews | date = September 30, 2008 | publisher = CBS Interactive | accessdate =June 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the combination of television, converter, external antenna, and power supply limits portability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.beaumontenterprise.com/news/local/se_texans_might_have_more_time_to_prep_for_digital_switch_02-16-2009.html | title = Southeast Texans might have more time to prep for digital switch | last = Guy | first = Colin | newspaper = Beaumont Enterprise| date=February 16, 2009| location = Beaumont, TX | accessdate =June 26, 2011 | quote = Although Burlington, Iowa-based Winegard produces a battery-powered digital converter box, some viewers might find that the tiny antennas attached to portable televisions and the rabbit-ears in their living room aren't sufficient to pick up a digital signal. | publisher = Hearst Newspapers  }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2009}}, portable digital [[LCD]] [[TV set]]s cost at least $100, and could not be used while in motion at significant speeds (restoring this analog functionality would require broadcasters to transmit [[mobile TV]] via the separate [[ATSC-M/H]] standard, which would in itself require new tuners).

The inability of some boxes to add new digital channels without a full re-scan—deleting all existing channel settings—renders them unusable to viewers who rely on [[directional antenna]]s and [[antenna rotator|rotors]] to receive distant stations. Signal strength meters, where available, are awkward, typically only displaying information for channels that have already been found.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dtv.broadcastnewsroom.com/articles/viewarticle.jsp?id=428905 DTV Broadcast Newsroom] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122102615/http://dtv.broadcastnewsroom.com/articles/viewarticle.jsp?id=428905 |date=January 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is problematic, as digital signals are most often transmitted on higher frequencies or with far less power than their analog counterparts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report | url = http://www.dtvanswers.com/webcasts/060408_FinalSlides.ppt | format = PPT | title = Digital Television (DTV) Transition Campaign Overview | author = DTVAnswers.com | publisher = National Association of Broadcasters | date = June 4, 2008 | accessdate =June 26, 2011}} NAB's DTVanswers.com estimates 1,295 stations relocating to a channel different than their NTSC channel, many across bands.&lt;/ref&gt; requiring careful antenna installation, orientation and location to avoid obstructions, fading and [[multipath interference]] problems.  Where the converter fails to receive a channel, an often-cumbersome manual process is usually provided; however, this requires knowledge of which frequencies each missing station is actually transmitting on, rather than the [[virtual channel]]s each is mapped to by the ATSC protocol.

Since the NTIA did not require CECBs to output [[multichannel television sound|MTS]] stereo signals via their radio-frequency output,  [[THAT Corporation]]&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Which licensed the now-expired patents to the [[dbx (noise reduction)|dbx noise reduction]] technology used in MTS, and still holds patents on some digital implementations of MTS&lt;/ref&gt; noted that consumers using RF-only connections with CECBs will lose stereo TV sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thatcorp.com/dbxTV-DTV-transition.html | title = dbx-TV and the Digital TV Transition | publisher = THAT Corporation | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081015130126/http://www.thatcorp.com/dbxTV-DTV-transition.html | archivedate = October 15, 2008 | deadurl = yes | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This problem may be avoided by using the converter's [[line level]] audio outputs.

== Low-power television concerns ==
{{Anchor|LPTV concerns}}
A year before the transition, Ron Bruno, president of the [[Community Broadcasters Association]] (CBA), said only four of 37 NTIA-certified converter boxes had analog passthrough, and none had analog tuners.&lt;ref name=ready/&gt;

In late March 2008, the CBA filed a [[lawsuit]] in the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia]] seeking an [[injunction]] to halt the sale and distribution of CECBs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=90157323|title=What Will Digital Do to Low-Power TV?|first=Joel|last=Rose|publisher=[[NPR]]|date=May 3, 2008|accessdate=August 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://broadcastengineering.com/newsrooms/community_broadcasters_association_petitions_0328 |title=Community Broadcasters Association petitions court to order DTV converter halt |work=[[Broadcast Engineering]] |date=March 28, 2008 |accessdate=August 20, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204165323/http://broadcastengineering.com/newsrooms/community_broadcasters_association_petitions_0328 |archivedate=December 4, 2008 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the CBA, the converters' lack of support for analog transmissions would harm its member stations, which include [[low-power broadcasting|low-power]] and [[class A television]] stations, as it was cost-prohibitive for many of them to convert to digital transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/articles/2007/11/15/daily.2/?promo|title=For LPTV, DTV Is a Countdown to Disaster|publisher=TVNewsCheck|date=November 15, 2007|accessdate=August 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CBA claimed that the new boxes would prevent viewers from being able to watch these analog-only stations; viewers might not even be aware such stations still existed, because the boxes would not list them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/techinvestor/industry/2008-03-26-small-stations-digital-tv_N.htm|title=Small stations claim digital TV switch will bankrupt them|work=USA Today|date=March 26, 2008|accessdate=August 20, 2009 | first=John | last=Dunbar}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the digital transition, the FCC did not set a deadline for existing LPTV stations to convert to digital service; however, it announced that no new analog LPTV stations would be authorized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fcc.gov/guides/low-power-television-lptv-service | title = Low Power Television (LPTV) Service | work = Consumer and Government Affairs Bureau | publisher = Federal Communications Commission | accessdate =July 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Responding to the CBA, the FCC and NTIA urged manufacturers to include analog support voluntarily in all converter boxes. Manufacturers responded by releasing a new generation of models with the feature.  Some new [[DVD recorder]]s and [[personal video recorder]]s also provide both analog and digital tuners, and therefore could perform the basic functions of a set-top box in both modes.

In early May 2008, the D.C. district court denied the CBA petition without comment. The CBA felt that the court wanted them to continue working with the FCC. The association said it would continue to pressure the FCC to support analog functionality as a requirement of the [[All-Channel Receiver Act]], urge more government funding for low power and Class A broadcasters to transition to digital, and ask Congress to increase the number of such stations eligible for funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tvtechnology.com/pages/s.0157/t.13436.html |title=Court Denies CBA Petition on Analog Pass-Through |work=TV Technology |date=March 9, 2008 |accessdate=August 20, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724082750/http://tvtechnology.com/pages/s.0157/t.13436.html |archivedate=July 24, 2008 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 13, 2009, the CBA announced that it would cease operations.  One reason given was the cost required to fight "restrictive regulations that kept the Class A and LPTV industry from realizing its potential", including the campaign to require analog passthrough.  Amy Brown, former CBA executive director, said "some 40 percent of Class A and LPTV station operators believe they will have to shut down in the next year if they are not helped through the digital transition."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/327560-Community_Broadcasters_Association_to_Shutter.php?rssid=20068&amp;q=digital+tv|title=Community Broadcasters Association to Shutter|work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]|date=August 13, 2009|accessdate=August 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2010, the FCC stopped accepting new applications for digital LPTV stations while it considered the spectrum needs of the [[National Broadband Plan (United States)|National Broadband Plan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.televisionbroadcast.com/article/102784 | title = New LPTV Station Applications Halted by Broadband Demands | date = June 29, 2010 | journal = Television Broadcast | last = McAdams | first = Deborah D. | publisher = NewBay Media | accessdate =July 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking published in September 2010, the FCC suggested setting a shutoff date for all analog TV transmissions, including LPTV stations, in 2012.&lt;ref name=fcc-10-172&gt;{{cite report|title=In the Matter of Amendment of Parts 73 and 74 of the Commission's Rules to Establish Rules for Digital Low Power Television, Television Translator, and Television Booster Stations and to Amend Rules for Digital Class A Television Stations: Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and Memorandum Opinion and Order |url=http://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2010/db0917/FCC-10-172A1.pdf |author=Federal Communications Commission |year=2010 |publisher=Federal Communications Commission |accessdate=July 7, 2011 |docket=FCC 10-172, MB 03-185 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314024902/http://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2010/db0917/FCC-10-172A1.pdf |archivedate=March 14, 2012 |df=mdy }} ({{USFR|2010|26062}})&lt;/ref&gt; It also proposed moving all low-power stations on channels 52–69 to new frequencies, to free the 700&amp;nbsp;MHz band for other uses.&lt;ref name=fcc-10-172/&gt;  In April 2011, the NTIA announced that it would stop accepting applications for grants toward upgrading LPTV stations to digital transmission as of July 2, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.televisionbroadcast.com/article/119896 | title = Fed Sets Deadline on LPTV Upgrade Program | date = April 28, 2011 | last = McAdams | first = Deborah | journal = Television Broadcast | accessdate =July 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The grant program was initially funded with $44 million; {{as of|2011|06|lc=y}}, over $30 million in grant funding remained available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ntia.doc.gov/lptv/index.html | title = Low Power Television and Translator Digital Upgrade Program | work = Digital Television Transition and Public Safety | publisher = National Telecommunications and Information Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce | date = June 6, 2011 | accessdate =July 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final deadline for LPTV Shutdown is 1 September 2015. The last NTIA grants offered to LPTV Broadcasters/Repeaters to convert their systems to digital ended in July 2012.  The September 2015 deadline is to allow for possible new construction to accommodate digital equipment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadcastlawblog.com/2011/07/articles/low-power-televisionclass-a-tv/fcc-sets-deadlines-for-lptv-tv-translator-and-class-a-stations-to-convert-to-digital-and-gives-hints-when-television-spectrum-may-be-reclaimed-for-broadband/ FCC Sets Deadlines for LPTV, TV Translator and Class A Stations To Convert to Digital - And Gives Hints When Television Spectrum May Be Reclaimed for Broadband] ''Broadcast Law Blog'' July 19, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the TV Full-Power Transmitter Digital Conversion in 2009, there will be no consumer subsidy program for the final LPTV digital conversion deadline since it is anticipated that without DTV Set-Top Converter Boxes, the majority of remaining SDTV/EDTV models in use should have left the consumer market by then.

== End of subsidies ==
By early January 2009, the NTIA had issued $1.34 billion worth of coupons for converter boxes, reaching the obligation limit set by the U.S. Congress in the Digital Television Transition and Public Safety Act of 2005.  As a result, the NTIA started placing requests for coupons on a waiting list, issuing coupons as previously-issued but unredeemed coupons reached their expiration date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url = http://www.ntia.doc.gov/press/2009/DTV_WaitList_090105.html | title = Commerce's NTIA Announces New Coupon Applicants Will be Placed on Waiting List Due to High Demand for TV Converter Box Coupons | publisher = National Telecommunications and Information Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce | date = January 5, 2009 | accessdate =July 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2008, FCC commissioner McDowell urged "those who don't need the government subsidy not to wait on that process before purchasing a converter box for themselves or as a gift for someone else.  During the weeks it takes for the government to process coupon requests, you will lose precious time to hook up the box, check antenna connections, and start enjoying free digital broadcast TV right away."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report | url  = http://www.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2008/db1224/FCC-08-281A6.txt | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090123144112/http://www.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2008/db1224/FCC-08-281A6.txt | archivedate = January 23, 2009 | publisher = Federal Communications Commission | last = McDowell | first = Robert M. | title = Statement of Commissioner Robert M.

[[Nielsen Media Research]] estimated in August 2008 that 25 percent of affected viewers would opt for inexpensive converters instead of replacing existing televisions or switching to [[cable television|cable]] and satellite television subscriptions.{{citation needed|date=July 2011}} By November 2008, 38.3 percent were planning to buy the less-costly converter boxes.{{citation needed|date=July 2011}}

Many retailers had stocked converters based on coupon use and shortages of the converter boxes themselves remained possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.wral.com/news/local/story/4247992/ | title = Cash for digital TV converter-box coupons runs out | last = Laliberte | first = Monica | work = WRAL | location =  Raleigh, NC | date = January 5, 2009 | publisher = Capitol Broadcasting Company | accessdate =July 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early February 2009, the [[Consumer Electronics Association]] estimated that three to six million converters were available,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/173700-Worst_Case_Converter_Boxes_Could_Run_Out_By_End_Of_Month.php | title = Worst Case: Converter Boxes Could Run Out By End Of Month | last = Eggerton | first = John | journal = Broadcasting &amp; Cable | date = February 5, 2009 | publisher = NewBay Media | accessdate =July 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Nielsen estimated 5.8 million American households were completely unready for digital transition.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} The ''New York Times'' estimated that converter supplies could run out by the end of the month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/06/forget-coupons-are-there-enough-dtv-converters/?apage=1 | title = Forget Coupons—Are There Enough DTV Converters? | first= Saul |last= Hansell | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date = February 6, 2009 | accessdate =July 7, 2011 | location = New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manufacturers who had halted production ahead of the original February 17, 2009 deadline were to resume converter box assembly but this new stock was not expected in stores until April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29056983/ns/technology_and_science-tech_and_gadgets/t/industry-dtv-converter-boxes-could-run-out/ | title = Industry: DTV Converter Boxes Could Run Out | agency = [[Associated Press]]| date=February 6, 2009 | last = Svensson |first = Peter | newspaper = MSNBC | accessdate =July 7, 2011 | publisher = NBC Universal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legislators from the American southwest were among those supporting a delay in the digital cutover, citing safety concerns because as many as a quarter of households in television markets there had not prepared to receive digital signals by January 2009. A judge from Hildago County, Texas noted that Latino, low-income, elderly, and rural homes were at risk.&lt;ref name=saen&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/state/38437874.html | title = Border areas lag in being ready for digital TV switch| first = Lynn | last = Brezosky | newspaper = [[San Antonio Express-News]] | date = January 27, 2009 | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20090129224405/http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/state/38437874.html | archivedate = January 29, 2009 | accessdate =July 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some residents could receive analog signals from Mexico;&lt;ref name=saen/&gt; Mexico does not plan to transition to digital transmission until [[Digital television in Mexico|the end of 2015]].

=== DTV Delay Act ===
The [[DTV Delay Act]], signed into law on February 11, 2009, extended the digital transition deadline to June 12, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/televisionNews/idUKTRE5136YP20090204 | title =  Congress approves digital TV delay | first = Kim | last = Dixon| work= Reuters| date = February 4, 2009 | accessdate =July 9, 2011 | publisher = Thomson Reuters }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/174041-Obama_Signs_DTV_Delay_Bill.php | title =  Obama Signs DTV-Delay Bill | journal = Broadcasting &amp; Cable | date =  February 11, 2009 | last = Eggerton | first = John | accessdate =July 9, 2011 | publisher = NewBay Media }}&lt;/ref&gt; The DTV Delay Act did not address the shortfall in funding for converter-box coupons; the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act]], part of a larger appropriations bill signed into law on February 17, 2009, added $650 million in funding—$490 million of that for coupons, increasing the total coupon-fund expenditure to $1.83 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/industryNews/idUKTRE51G5ZG20090218 | title = DTV coupon backlog seen gone within weeks |agency=Reuters | date =  February 18, 2009 | last = Dixon | first = Kim | publisher = Thomson Reuters | accessdate =July 9, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=migoya&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.denverpost.com/search/ci_11988674 | title = Those with expired coupons for digital-converter boxes may now reapply | first = David | last = Migoya | newspaper = [[The Denver Post]]| date= March 25, 2009 | location = Denver, CO | accessdate =July 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=exceeds&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/316344-Government_Exceeds_Original_Converter_Box_Coupon_Funding_Limit.php?rssid=20068&amp;q=digital+tv |title=Government Exceeds Original Converter Box Coupon Funding Limit|last=Eggerton |first=John |date=July 24, 2009|journal=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]] |accessdate=August 3, 2009 | publisher = NewBay Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By February 18, 36 percent of the United States's full-power stations had transitioned to digital-only, but five million of the nation's 115 million households remained entirely unready;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.tvweek.com/news/2009/02/dtv_switch_report_5_mil_homes.php |title=DTV Switch Report: 5 Mil Homes Not Ready |first=Greg |last=Baumann |journal=TV Week |date=February 18, 2009 |accessdate=July 9, 2011 |publisher=Crain Communications |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323170929/http://www.tvweek.com/news/2009/02/dtv_switch_report_5_mil_homes.php |archivedate=March 23, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; at the time, 4.3 million coupon requests remained on the NTIA waiting list.&lt;ref name="NTIA stats"/&gt; The NTIA resumed issuing coupons in early March 2009, expecting to clear its backlog in two and a half weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29530464/ | title = TV converter box coupons start flowing again | work = [[MSNBC]] | date = March 5, 2009 | agency = Associated Press | accessdate =July 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political issues had contributed to the delays in sending out coupons; the NTIA could not issue coupons above the spending limit set in the bill, even knowing that many already-issued coupons would expire.&lt;ref name=reg-muddle&gt;{{cite news|title=Regulatory muddle stalled DTV switch |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2008746214_dtv15.html |last=Hart |first=Kim |last2=Whoriskey |first2=Peter |newspaper=The Seattle Times |location=Seattle, WA |date=February 15, 2009 |accessdate=July 9, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524144940/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2008746214_dtv15.html |archivedate=May 24, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though unused coupons meant more money for the program, the coupons had to actually expire before the money could be "reused" for newly issued coupons.&lt;ref name=final&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/328786-Treasury_to_Get_Nine_Figure_Return_On_Coupon_Program.php?rssid=20068&amp;q=digital+tv

The NTIA was legally required to issue coupons on a first-come, first-served basis; viewers in markets where individual stations ended analog broadcasts by the original deadline did not receive priority  handling of their DTV coupon requests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2009-02-16-dtv-coupons_N.htm | title = Backlog still large for TV converter box coupons | first =  Peter | last = Svensson | agency= [[Associated Press]] | newspaper = USA Today | date =  January 14, 2009 | accessdate =July 9, 2011 | publisher = Gannett }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 24, 2009, the NTIA announced that the four-million-person waiting-list backlog had been cleared, meaning those whose coupons had expired could reapply. The NTIA estimated 17 million coupons had expired, while 25.7 million—56 percent of those issued—had been used.&lt;ref name=migoya/&gt; On April 12, Nielsen estimated that 3.6 million households remained unready.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/tampabay/stories/2009/04/13/daily51.html  |title=Digital TV transition becoming more common in Tampa-St. Pete  |date=April 16, 2009|work=[[Tampa Bay Business Journal]]|accessdate=June 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Completing the transition ===
The [[analog shutdown]] for full-power TV stations was completed in mid-2009, with several stations ending analog transmissions well before the June 12, 2009 deadline. (Many transitioned on the original February 17 date.)  In most cases, at least one station in each [[media market]] continued analog broadcasts for up to 30 days afterward as an "[[analog nightlight]]"—prohibited from broadcasting regular programming, but allowed to transmit information on how to obtain and connect a converter box to receive digital programming (and send [[Emergency Alert System]] broadcasts.).  This allowed viewers who had not converted by the deadline to receive at least one channel that would explain the absence of the other analog channels. The half-hour [[public service announcement]] with English and Spanish segments seen on most such stations was produced by the [[National Association of Broadcasters]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

Nielsen said 2.5 million homes were still incapable of receiving a digital signal two days after the deadline.&lt;ref name=stillnot/&gt; On June 17, 2009, the NTIA said two million requested coupons had not yet been mailed.&lt;ref name=stillnot&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.multichannel.com/article/294834-2_5_Million_Households_Still_Not_Receiving_DTV_Signals.php?rssid=20059&amp;q=converter+box |title=2.5 Million Households Still Not Receiving DTV Signals |last=Eggerton |first=John |date=June 17, 2009|work=[[Multichannel News]]|accessdate=June 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NTIA reported that, as of July 22, 2009, 33,578,000 coupons had been used—more than the 33.5 million possible with the original $1.34 billion allocation. $435 million of the extra money added was already owed for pending requests.&lt;ref name=exceeds/&gt;

U.S. Representative [[Peter DeFazio]] and Senator [[Bernie Sanders]] introduced legislation which would have extended the converter-box coupon program beyond July 31, 2009, subsidized antennas, and require satellite and cable TV companies to provide a $10 basic-broadcast-channel package available to those who had lost the ability to receive at least one over-the-air channel because of the transition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/294816-House_Version_of_Sanders_DTV_Bill_Introduced.php |title=House Version of Sanders DTV Bill Introduced |last=Eggerton |first=John |date=June 17, 2009|work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]|accessdate=July 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither Congressman's bill was passed into law.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|110|sres|3740}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|hres|2867}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At midnight on July 31, 2009, the CECB program expired, without extension.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Toward the end of July, consumers were making 35,000 requests for coupons per day, with just over half those issued being used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/326025-Nielsen_98_9_of_U_S_Homes_Can_Get_DTV_Signal.php?rssid=20068&amp;q=digital+tv

By August 5, 2009, consumers had used 33,962,696 coupons.&lt;ref name=cecb-spike&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/326586-Converter_Box_Coupon_Program_Ends_With_Spike_in_Applications.php?rssid=20065&amp;q=digital+tv|title=

The NTIA said 4,287,379 coupons had been requested but not redeemed. As of August 12, $310,796,690 was available, and if all requested coupons were redeemed, $139,300,174 would be left.&lt;ref name=final/&gt;

An unidentified NTIA source said the agency returned $241.6 million to the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]]; $2.6 million went to "final closeout costs".&lt;ref name=unused/&gt;  After the program ended, $250 million from the original bill had not been used, and the additional $490 million allocated in February 2009 had not been touched.&lt;ref name=unused&gt;{{cite news|url=

'''Dandia Dhamaka''' (dD) is an [[India]]n [[Dandiya Raas]] dance competition.  In 2001, students from the [[University of Michigan]] created an organization called the RAAS Association to coordinate Dandia Dhamaka.  Dandia Dhamaka showcases the South Asian traditional dance form of raas, a traditional, yet expressive form of [[Folk dance in India|Indian folk dance]] involving wooden sticks called dandias, representing the swords of [[Durga]]. The dancers hit each other's sticks to the beat of the music.  The women wear traditional dresses such as colorful embroidered [[choli]], [[Gagra choli|ghagra]] and bandhani [[dupattas]] (traditional attire) that shine with mirror work and heavy jewellery. The men wear special [[turbans]] and kedias, but this varies regionally.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.annarbor.com/entertainment/top-college-indian-dance-teams-compete-at-ums-dandia-dhamaka/&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2013 competition was held on January 26, 2013 at the [[Michigan Theater (Ann Arbor, Michigan)|Michigan Theater]] in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]].

Dandia Dhamaka has held mixers on the Friday night that teams have arrived at the competition. These mixers allow teams to participate in team building activities so teams can interact with their own teams and their competing teams.

'''Dawn O'Donnell''' (born 1927/1928 – died 10 June 2007), was a prominent Sydney [[entrepreneur]] and supporter of the Sydney LGBT community.&lt;ref name=smh1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/gay-sydney-says-goodbye/2007/06/15/1181414542675.html|title=Gay Sydney says goodbye to one who made it so|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald|date=16 June 2007|accessdate=16 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has been credited with being a defining early influence on the gay and lesbian club scene in Sydney's [[Oxford Street, Sydney|Oxford Street]] and [[Newtown, New South Wales|Newtown]].&lt;ref name=smh2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/obituaries/a-leading-lady-of-sydneys-gay-club-scene/2007/06/12/1181414295974.html|title=Obituaries: A leading lady of Sydney's gay club scene|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald|date=13 June 2007|accessdate=16 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Born circa 1928 in the Sydney suburb of [[Paddington, New South Wales|Paddington]], she won a bursary to St Vincent's College, [[Potts Point]], run by the [[Sisters of Charity]]. She left school at age 15, and three years later, aged 18, won the Australian ladies speed skating championship, turned professional and taught at the Glaciarium before going to London and Paris. She was briefly married to a butcher named Des Irwin.&lt;ref name="ninglun"/&gt; Her career began as an international [[Ice skating|ice skater]] when she was a teenager. It was while touring Paris as a performer in the ''[[Puss in Boots (fairy tale)|Puss in Boots]]'' on ice show, she had her first romance with another woman.&lt;ref name=smh2/&gt;

==Career==
After her promising skating career was cut short by injury, O'Donnell ran a butcher shop in [[Double Bay, New South Wales|Double Bay]] and a [[parking lot]] in [[Ultimo, New South Wales|Ultimo]], before opening her first [[gay bar]], '''The Trolley Bar''', off [[Broadway, New South Wales|Broadway]] in 1968. Next she opened a gay bath-house (above a cake shop in [[Bondi Junction, New South Wales]]), followed in 1969 by '''Capriccio's''', a gay night club on [[Oxford Street, Sydney|Oxford Street]] famous for its [[Drag queen|drag]] shows, which drew visiting celebrities from around the world.&lt;ref name=smh2/&gt;

She recognised the gay and lesbian potential of [[Oxford Street, Sydney|Oxford Street]]. At this time, homosexual acts between men were still illegal in [[New South Wales]], and Dawn O'Donnell was known to pay bail to release gay men from police custody. Her gay and lesbian venues gave many "a place to [[Coming out|come out]]".&lt;ref name=smh1/&gt; In 2001, O'Donnell recounted: ''"The most fascinating thing in the world for me was eventually to see the [[New South Wales Police Force]] have a gay public relations officer. I never thought to my dying day I'd ever see that."''&lt;ref name=abc1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/stories/s251185.htm|title=Exhibition reveals a century of gay life|publisher=ABC News 'Lateline'|date=23 February 2001|accessdate=16 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, O'Donnell controlled a string of lesbian and gay venues in [[East Sydney, New South Wales|East Sydney]], including:
* '''Jools''' on [[Crown Street, Sydney|Crown Street]]
* '''Patchs''' nightclub on [[Oxford Street, Sydney|Oxford Street]]
* '''Flo's Palace'''
* '''The Exchange Hotel'''
* '''Ruby Reds''' on [[Crown Street, Sydney|Crown Street]] (Sydney's first lesbian bar)

Some of these ventures were run in partnership with the late French restaurateur Roger Claude Teyssedre and controversial Sydney businessman [[Abe Saffron]].&lt;ref name=smh2/&gt; The clubs attracted gays and lesbians from across Australia and around the world.&lt;ref name=aus1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21889969-2702,00.html|title=Mother of gay Sydney dies at 79|publisher=The Australian|date=12 June 2007|accessdate=3 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1980s, O'Donnell began to shift her focus from [[Oxford Street, Sydney|Oxford Street]] to the inner-west suburb of [[Newtown, New South Wales|Newtown]]. She bought the Newtown and Imperial Hotels in nearby [[Erskineville, New South Wales|Erskineville]], transforming the Newtown area into a gay precinct to rival [[Oxford Street, Sydney|Oxford Street]]. The Imperial Hotel featured in the opening scenes of the movie, ''[[The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert]]''. {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

According to Graeme Browning (a.k.a. "Mitzi Macintosh") who performed [[Drag queen|drag]] shows at O'Donnell-owned venues for 10 years, "She made the Sydney drag scene what it is, but our gay scene wouldn't be what it is without her either." Another [[Drag queen|drag]] performer, David Williams (aka "Beatrice") said "she invented the idea of Oxford Street", helping to make Sydney one of the gay capitals of the world.&lt;ref name=smh1/&gt;

==Personal life and death==
In 1977, aged 49, O'Donnell met her long-term partner, [[Dutch (ethnic group)|Dutch]]-born Aniek Baten, who was 26 years old. They later married, both wearing white for the wedding.

O'Donnell's funeral service was held at St Canice's Catholic Church in [[Elizabeth Bay, New South Wales|Elizabeth Bay]], Sydney.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

'''Employee Appreciation Day''' is an [[holiday#unofficial holiday|unofficial holiday]] observed on the first Friday in March in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. It is a day for companies to thank their employees for their hard work and effort throughout the year. This day was created for the purpose of strengthening the bond between employer and employee.

Though the holiday is still gaining in adoption in the U.S. and abroad, like [[Boss's Day]], Employee Appreciation Day has become an opportunity for managers, company leadership and HR to remember the importance of appreciating employees.&lt;ref name="t&amp;d"&gt;{{cite web|title=Time and Date — Employee Appreciation Day in United States|url=http://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/us/employee-appreciation-day|publisher=Timeanddate.com|accessdate=2015-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Companies often celebrate by letting employees leave early,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisaquast/2017/02/27/5-ways-to-celebrate-employee-appreciation-day-friday-march-3rd/#6f91d01b2c7f|title=5 Ways To Celebrate Employee Appreciation Day|last=Quast|first=Lisa|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-03-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; offering gifts, events or special recognition for workers.&lt;ref name="Inc - 5 Ideas for Employee Appreciation Day"&gt;{{cite web|title= Inc - 5 Great Ideas for Employee Appreciation Day|url=http://www.inc.com/suzanne-lucas/5-great-ideas-for-employee-appreciation-day.html|publisher=Inc.com|accessdate=2015-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies show that recognition and appreciation are growing in importance as drivers of employee happiness and engagement.  This has resulted in more and more companies and organizations using the day to thank their employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Law Review on Employee Appreciation Day|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/some-thoughts-employee-appreciation-day-including-potential-wage-and-hour-pitfall|publisher=Natlawreview.com|accessdate=2015-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Showing employees appreciation can result in a company's higher retention  rate, not only increasing the productivity of employees but the company as a whole.

'''Enna Kodumai Saravanan Idhu''' ({{lang-ta|என்ன கொடுமை சரவணன் இது}}; abbreviated to '''EKSI''') is a quote from the 2005 [[Tamil film]] ''[[Chandramukhi]]'' spoken by the character Senthilnathan, played by [[Prabhu Ganesan]]. The line has gained popularity&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hindu.com/fr/2008/09/12/stories/2008091250810100.htm "Prabhu’s penchant for comedy is well known. "I hope I get to play light roles. Incidentally, I quite like the way in which these young actors have made a joke of my serious line in ‘Chandramukhi’ — ‘Enna Kodumai Saravana Idhu.'"&lt;/ref&gt; as an expression of irony or surprise.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-08-31/news-interviews/29948789_1_vazhi-dialogues-popular-culture&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
In the film, actor [[Prabhu Ganesan]] exclaims this to his friend Saravanan, portrayed by [[Rajinikanth]].  He says this dialogue, when he comes to know that his wife Ganga, played by [[Jyothika]], has an alternate personality called "Chandramukhi".

"Enna Kodumai Saravanan Idhu" literally means "What atrocity is this, Saravanan?" Saravanan, originally a name of the Hindu God [[Kartikeya|Murugan]], is also a frequently used [[personal name]] among [[Tamil people]].

==Other usage==
The line, however, gained notable attention and popularity, after being varied slightly to "Enna Kodumai, Sir", used by comedian [[Premji Amaran]] in the comedy film, ''[[Chennai 600028]]'' (2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.behindwoods.com/tamil-movie-news-1/oct-09-02/goa-09-10-09.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-09-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140926070233/http://www.behindwoods.com/tamil-movie-news-1/oct-09-02/goa-09-10-09.html |archivedate=2014-09-26 |df= }} "It is worth a mention here that the director, in his debut venture Chennai 28, had modified the famous “Enna Kodumai Saravanan” dialogue in Chandramukhi to “Enna Kodumai Sir,” which was well received by the audience."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/tamil/article/37299.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.behindwoods.com/features/visitors-1/premji-11-12-08.html&lt;/ref&gt; The line is reused by Premji in nearly all his subsequent comedy roles, in films such as ''[[Santosh Subramaniam]]'', ''[[Goa (film)|Goa]]'' and ''[[Mankatha]]''. In the 2007 film ''[[Sivaji (film)|Sivaji: The Boss]]'', actor [[Livingston (actor)|Livingston]] uses the variant "Enna Kodomai Saravanan Sir."
Enna Kodumai Saravanan Ithu is also abbreviated to "EKSI" in chat and [[SMS language]].

'''''Fatale''''' is a supernatural [[Crime fiction|noir]] [[comic book]] created by [[Ed Brubaker]] and [[Sean Phillips]]. It was published by [[Image Comics]] between January [[2012 in comics|2012]] and July 2014. The series was initially announced as a 12-issue [[limited series (comics)|limited series]], but it was later extended to 24 issues.

==Publication history==
The series was originally announced in the back of the final issue of Brubaker and Phillips' previous collaboration, ''[[Criminal (comics)|Criminal]]: [[List of Criminal story arcs#The Last of the Innocent|Last of the Innocent]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Criminal'' vol 4 #4&lt;/ref&gt; Further details about the series, including its publisher, were revealed at the [[2011 in comics|2011]] [[New York Comic Con]].&lt;ref&gt;Harper, David, [http://multiversitycomics.com/news/nycc-updated-brubaker-phillips-roll-out-fatale-at-image/ NYCC Updated Brubaker Phillips roll out Fatale at Image], [[Multiversity Comics]], 14 October 2011, retrieved 26 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Brubaker also released a video teaser for the series.&lt;ref&gt;Harper, David, "[http://multiversitycomics.com/news/nycc-the-trailer-to-brubaker-and-phillips-fatale-revealed/ NYCC: The Trailer to Brubaker and Phillips’ "Fatale" Revealed] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151124105416/http://multiversitycomics.com/news/nycc-the-trailer-to-brubaker-and-phillips-fatale-revealed/ |date=November 24, 2015 }}", Multiversity Comics, 15 October 2011, retrieved 26 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The series began publishing monthly in January 2012. Although initially billed as a twelve-issue series, the length was increased in November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Brothers, David, "[http://www.comicsalliance.com/2012/11/01/the-ed-brubaker-captain-america-exit-interview-marvel-fatale-image/ The Ed Brubaker 'Captain America' Exit Interview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104065004/http://www.comicsalliance.com/2012/11/01/the-ed-brubaker-captain-america-exit-interview-marvel-fatale-image |date=2012-11-04 }}", [[Comics Alliance]] 01 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The series concluded after 24 issues.&lt;ref&gt;Ching, Albert [http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=50171 IMAGE EXPO: Keynote Announces New Series From Snyder, Morrison, Remender &amp; More], ''Comic Book Resources'', 9 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Several issues featured an article written by [[Jess Nevins]] and others on the crime/noir characters, both fictional and real.

==Plot==
''Fatale'' chronicles the life of Josephine, or "Jo", an archetypal [[femme fatale]] who is seemingly immortal, having survived from the 1930s to the modern day unaged, and also has a supernatural ability to hypnotize men into becoming intensely infatuated with her, whether she wants them to be or not.

Through the decades, Jo struggles to understand and control her powers while being pursued by a violent cult. The cult worships cosmic gods reminiscent of [[Cthulhu Mythos|Lovecraftian horrors]], which are somehow tied to Jo.

During her travels, Jo also encounters many men who quickly become entranced by her, often to fanatical degrees. They become entangled in her escapades, possibly as guardians, collaborators, and lovers. A motif of the series is how these men pay dearly for becoming involved with Jo.

The narrative jumps back and forth between different time periods and points of view, primarily Jo and the men entranced by her. The majority of the action in the first story arc takes place in the 1950s, the second in the 1970s, the third during the 1930s and [[World War II]], while the fourth arc is set in the 1990s.

A couple of issues featured stand-alone stories focused on "fatales" before Jo. Issue #12 tells the story of Mathilda in 13th century France, while Issue #13 tells the story of "Black" Bonnie in the [[Wild West]]. Aside from her powers, both women also shared striking physical similarities with Jo and found themselves pursued by the same cult.

'''''Forever Kingdom''''', known in Japan as {{nihongo|'''''Evergrace II'''''|エヴァーグレイス|Evāgureisu Tsu}}, is an [[action role-playing game]] released for the [[PlayStation 2]] by [[FromSoftware]]. It is the prequel to ''[[Evergrace]]''.

==Story==
''Forever Kingdom'' takes place directly before the events of ''Evergrace''. Darius lived a somewhat sheltered life with his parents in the small village of Solta. Though not having any siblings, Darius was very close to his friend Sharline, whom he cared for like a sister. However, Darius' simple home life in Solta would come to a tragic end when assassins hired by the secluded village of Morea murdered Darius' parents for unknown reasons. In addition to facing the loss of his family, Sharline was nowhere to be found, leaving Darius with the conclusion that she was also killed.

Shortly after the tragedy, Darius sought refuge with his childhood friend, Ruyan, from the village of Seclue. Ruyan's father agreed to take Darius under his wing, as well as training him in swordplay so that he might one day take vengeance against his adversaries. As time passed, Darius and Ruyan tirelessly trained together, eventually forming "The Four Swordsmen of Solta" with two other mentionable warriors, Drumhort and Saris.

Once prepared for his journey, Darius left Seclue in search of some answers into his parents' murder, as well as the disappearance of Sharline. Ruyan, being close to Darius, also decided to come along in hopes of aiding Darius in realizing his revenge. Though they travelled far abroad the continent of Edinbury, Darius and Ruyan's efforts had proven daunting. Just when they were about to give up all hope, however, the two suddenly stumbled upon an unconscious girl, who later claimed to suffer from amnesia. She could only recall her name—Faeana. Having nowhere else to go, Faeana decided to tag along with Darius and Ruyan, hoping that she might recognize someone or something along their journey.

===The Eve of Disaster===

A year or so ago, as Darius and Ruyan were on their journey, a great 'cataclysm' had taken place, believed to be a war between Rieubane and another political power. The war generally affected much of Edinbury and its people, causing somewhat of a great depression. Though the political affairs of Rieubane—as well as the cause of the war—yet remain unknown, Faeana is believed to have some strange involvement in the Eve of Disaster. However, she herself cannot recall the events.

===Solca, Darsul, and the Soul Bind===

Along their travels, Darius and co. happen upon a mysterious girl named Solca. Before any acquaintances can be made, however, a dark wizard named Darsul and his clad guardian appear to abduct the girl, making quick work of Darius and his party. Before vanishing into thin-air with Solca, however, Darsul places a curse known as the 'Soul Bind' on Darius and his friends. It is later discovered that the 'Soul Bind' is a powerful spell which links the lifeforce of those afflicted, causing them to share the same experiences through a form of empathy. Baring this in mind, the three have no choice but to temporarily set aside their affairs and seek a cure, lest they otherwise perish together.

==Characters==

'''Darius''' - 
A young swordsman from the village of Solta. His parents were murdered as a child, and his childhood friend Sharline was abducted, as well. He spent the rest of his childhood with his friend Ruyan, training to become one of "The Four Swordsmen of Solta."

He has somewhat of a reserve about him, which often intimidates others. However, Darius has a genuine heart, and ultimately wishes to help those in need of his abilities.

'''Ruyan''' - 
A close childhood friend of Darius. Having much sympathy toward Darius' tragic past, Ruyan trains himself as a skilled swordsman so that he may fight by Darius' side and bring an end to the Eve of Disaster.

Ruyan is a very warm-hearted young man whose kind ethos prevents him from intently harming another. However, no cost—whether it be bloodshed or otherwise—is too great to achieve peace.

'''Faeana''' - 
An amnesiac young girl who was discovered unconscious by Darius and Ruyan on their travels. Having felt a warm presence about them, she travels at their side, hoping that she might recognize something along the way, or perhaps otherwise recall her memory.

'''Darsul''' - 
A rather shady wizard who has some interest in a girl named Solca. Upon running into Darius and his party, Darsul inflicts them with the Soul Bind, and abducts Sulca without much revealing much of his reasoning.

'''Drumhort''' - 
A clad swordsman currently travelling with Darsul for unknown reasons. He also aids in the abduction of Solca.

'''Solca''' - 
A mysterious young girl who was being pursued by Darsul and Drumhort. Before her abduction, Darius and co. had shortly run into Solca, causing Faeana to experience strange feelings. Perhaps she and Faeana have some connection, though details are yet unknown.

'''Karmyla''' - 
A dark woman with a very gothic-appearance who later accompanies Darsul, aiding him with much great wisdom. However, her intentions with Darsul otherwise remain shadowed from Darius and his party.

'''Felk''' - 
Currently leading the Solta army, Felk spends most of his time searching for his lost half-brother. He is usually accompanied by a swordsman named Saris.

'''Saris''' - 
A nomadic mercenary foreign to Edinbury. He often accompanies Felk, serving as his right-hand man.

==Gameplay==

===The Soul Bind===

The Soul Bind is a curse placed on Darius and his party which causes them to share the same lifeforce. Thus, if a member of Darius' party is attacked, then they all endure damage. Consequently, healing one character also heals the other two, as well.

Generally, a 'Soul' gauge measures the overall lifeforce of the party, which is displayed at the bottom-left corner of the screen. When damage is taken by any of the three player-characters, the gauge decreases. If the gauge is completely depleted, then the entire party perishes simultaneously. While proving to be somewhat frustrating, the game features an option which allows Life Extracts (healing potions) to be used at the press of the button, removing some of the challenge of managing three characters who share one life gauge.

===Character Growth===

Rather than implementing a level-up system like most RPGs, Forever Kingdom utilizes character growth through equipment upgrading. Each item either raises or lowers attributes respectively, and may be tampered with at shops to increase this effectivity. Though very cost-heavy, character growth is seen to be more customizable with this method.

===Battle Mechanics===

:'''Real-Time Combat:''' Forever Kingdom focuses on real-time combat environments between the player, two character allies controlled by AI, and real-time enemies. Since the player may only control one party member at any given time, the other two characters will engage enemies based on a strict AI script. Although, there is no way to customize this based on preference or character build. However, the player may switch between the three characters at any given time, allowing the computer to control the other.

:'''Palmira Actions:''' Palmira actions are special skills associated with various equipment found in the game, each having its own set of Palmira. The available actions to a particular character are determined entirely by what that character is currently equipped with. Once the equipment is replaced with something else, the character's Palmira actions are replaced with new ones. Each character has a specific button associated with Palmira usage -- triangle, square and circle. The order may change depending on which character is currently under control of the player.

:'''Combos:''' Forever Kingdom also implements a combo system, allowing the player to execute Palmira actions in large multitudes based on timing. When a Palmira action is used by one character, an icon will appear to indicate which button should be pressed to start the combo, though the icon will disappear shortly if the player does not react quickly enough. Once a combo is stringed, two or more characters will simultaneously bombard foes with their equipped actions, resulting in damage bonuses.

'''Gaslight Village''' was a [[Vaudeville]] themed amusement park in [[Lake George (village), New York|Lake George, New York]]. The park was located along [[New York State Route 9N]], [[U.S. Route 9 in New York|U.S. Route 9]] and [[County Route 69 (Warren County, New York)|Warren County Route 69]] (West Brook Road) in the village. It opened in 1959, designed by [[Arto Monaco]] and built by amusement park builder [[Charles Wood (businessman)|Charles Wood]]. The park was approximately 3-4 city blocks in size, and featured some standard amusement rides, (a [[Ferris wheel]], [[merry-go-round]], [[bumper car]]s, [[Tilt a Whirl]], etc.) as well as some unusual rides. The main feature of the park was the Opera House where Vaudeville-style shows, including an Ice Show, melodramas, and a wide variety of stage acts performed all day and until lights-out each evening. The park was closed in 1989. Its site later became the now defunct Lake George Action Park.&lt;ref name=Anderson/&gt;

==Charles R. Wood Park==
In December 2010, it was reported that the Lake George Association, Lake George Land Conservancy, and other organizations had acquired the land and were demolishing the site in order return the area to [[wetlands]] to filter water draining into [[Lake George (New York)|Lake George]], at a cost of up to $12 million.&lt;ref name=Anderson&gt;{{cite news|last=Anderson|first=Eric|title=Last flicker for Gaslight Village|url=http://www.timesunion.com/business/article/Last-flicker-for-Gaslight-Village-847694.php|accessdate=26 July 2012|newspaper=[[Times Union (Albany)|Times Union]]|date=1 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2012, it was announced that the foundation of Gaslight Village's late founder, the Charles R. Wood Foundation, contributed $750,000 towards a $1.8 million nature park, to be called Charles R. Wood Park. Along with offering picnic and recreational space, the area will treat storm water from NY&amp;nbsp;9N via a [[settling pond]] and a [[constructed wetland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Putney|first=Chris|title=Former Gaslight Village To Become Charles R.

In the July 1937 issue of ''[[Strength &amp; Health]]'' magazine, Rosetta Hoffman made the claim that Minerva had lifted 23 men and a platform, in a 3,564–lb hip-and-harness lift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Onstage Competition purpose in question |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/9062723/seguin_gazetteenterprise_january_6/ |newspaper=[[Seguin Gazette|Seguin Gazette Enterprise]] |date=January 6, 1985 |page=15 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |access-date=February 20, 2017}} {{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For several years, the ''Guinness Book of World Records'' listed Minerva as having lifted the greatest weight ever by a woman—3,564-lb in a hip-and-harness lift&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/9062247/the_kokomo_tribune_august_19_1990_page/ |title=Sports facts |newspaper=[[Kokomo Tribune]] |date=August 19, 1990 |access-date=February 20, 2017}} {{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt;— "at the Bijou Theatre, Hoboken, N.J., on April 15, 1895."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sport Day |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/9062325/gettysburg_times_april_15_1982_sport/ |newspaper=[[The Gettysburg Times]] |date=April 15, 1982 |page=14 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |access-date=February 20, 2017}} {{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoffman may be the source for ''Guinness'' record, even though it contradicts, and even enhances, the published claim of the time from the sponsor of the event, the ''[[National Police Gazette]]''. The ''Gazette'', a sensationalist tabloid of the period, claimed she lifted a platform with only 18 men weighing "approximately 3000 pounds".

For this feat, the ''Gazette'' awarded Minerva with a solid gold [[loving cup]] on April 29, 1895; this trophy is now lost.

==Wrestling career==
Blatt was the first woman to ever hold a professional wrestling championship, the original [[Women's World Championship]], won in the 1890s.

In the 1890s she competed across Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=In Woman's World: The Fair Sex takes An Interest in Athletics |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/9041121/josie_wahlford_logansport/ |newspaper=[[Pharos-Tribune|Logansport Pharos-Tribune]] |date=June 18, 1892 |page=14 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |access-date=February 19, 2017 |quote= There are Fannie Gorman and Josie Wahlford both of whom have won fame in their ?ine not of mere national limit. The latter is now traveling Mexico where she is astonishing the people with her various feats of prowess.}} {{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Late life==
Blatt retired from performance in 1910, and invested in New Jersey [[real estate]]. She died on September 1, 1923.

'''''Just Dance Now''''' is a video game in the ''[[Just Dance (video game series)|Just Dance]]'' series developed by [[Ubisoft]]. It was released on September 25, 2014, available in both the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] and [[Google Play]]. The trailer for the game was revealed at the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014]] on June 9, 2014. Without the purchase of VIP an ad-supported version of the game is available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gadgets.ndtv.com/apps/news/just-dance-now-releasing-september-25-for-free-on-android-and-ios-594602|title=Just Dance Now Releasing September 25 for Free on Android and iOS|work=NDTV Gadgets360.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few months prior, a beta version was available in the previously mentioned stores for most parts of Europe.

''Just Dance Now'' is intended for people who may not have access to a [[Video game console|console]] to play the original game. The [[Mobile app|app]] version instead uses an internet connection to the Just Dance Now website through either a television, a computer, a laptop, a tablet or a [[Chromecast]]. The device acts as a controller, much like the [[Wiimote]], the Wii's main controller. Multiple players may connect simultaneously, and there is no limit to the number of players allowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/09/e3-2014-just-dance-now-lets-you-play-using-a-smartphone|title=E3 2014: Just Dance Now Lets You Play Using a Smartphone|author=Brian Albert|date=9 June 2014|work=IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the June 2017 update, the game now allows players to play any song that they want for in-game currency instead of the previous model of providing a playlist offering limited free songs. The app offers a library of songs requiring a time-limit VIP pass which can be purchased through the app or coins which are automatically earned overtime or purchased through the app.

[[Canada's Wonderland]] is a {{convert|330|acre|ha|adj=on}} [[Amusement park|theme park]] located in [[Vaughan]], [[Ontario]], Canada, a suburb directly north of [[Toronto]]. When Canada's Wonderland first opened in 1981, there were 26 attractions. Today, there are 69, including the attractions inside [[Splash Works]], a [[water park]] adjacent to the main theme park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadaswonderland.com/park-history/park-history |title=Canada's Wonderland History |publisher=Canada's Wonderland |accessdate=November 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the opening of the amusement park, at least one attraction has been added every year except 2009 and 2013.&lt;ref name=timeline&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadaswonderland.com/park-history/timeline |title=Canada's Wonderland Timeline |publisher=Canada's Wonderland |accessdate=April 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[Freestyle (roller coaster)|SkyRider]] closed permanently in 2014; it was the only roller coaster to close in the park's history and was relocated to Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Karstens-Smith|first1=Gemma|title=After 29 years, SkyRider’s ride comes to an end|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2014/08/07/after_29_years_skyriders_ride_comes_to_an_end.html|accessdate=September 1, 2014|newspaper=The Toronto Star|date=August 7, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140902022154/http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2014/08/07/after_29_years_skyriders_ride_comes_to_an_end.html|archivedate=September 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; SkyHawk, a Sky Roller by [[Gerstlauer|Gerstlauer Rides]], and Flying Eagles from [[Larson International]] opened in 2016. The 2017 additions include Soaring Timbers and Muskoka Plunge and the 2018 additions include Lumberjack and Flying Canoes; Soaring Timbers, Lumberjack, and Flying Canoes are flat rides, while Muskoka Plunge is a water ride.

Up until 1992, Canada's Wonderland did not have a water park. Eleven years after the park opened, Splash Works was constructed in the area surrounding the [[Mighty Canadian Minebuster]].&lt;ref name=timeline /&gt; Original plans and park maps during construction of the park show that the area that is now Splash Works and White Water Canyon was originally planned to be a themed area called "Frontier Canada", a section of the park devoted to the Canadian wilderness.&lt;ref name=brown&gt;{{cite book|title=Memories of Canada's Wonderland|publisher=International Sports Properties (1980)|location=Toronto ON|pages=46–47|editor=Dick Brown, Louis Cauz|accessdate=November 27, 2012|chapter=It's a great beginning but look what's ahead|url=http://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/detail.jsp?Entt=RDM2433093&amp;R=2433093|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525200900/http://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/detail.jsp?Entt=RDM2433093&amp;R=2433093|archivedate=May 25, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CWhistory /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pcwjunkies.com/pcw/vault/guides/map81s.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080617133856/http://www.pcwjunkies.com/pcw/vault/guides/map81s.htm |archivedate=June 17, 2008 |title=1981 CW Souvenir Map |publisher=PCW Junkies |accessdate=November 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this section was never built, several of the elements that were to be included are now scattered across the park.&lt;ref name=brown /&gt;

For safety, Canada's Wonderland uses a ride rating system that classifies the attractions based on the intensity of the ride. The ratings vary from 1, for rides that are calm and gentle, to 5, for rides that have high speeds, aggressive forces, and rapid elevation changes. A separate set of ride ratings criteria is used for attractions inside Splash Works, though the rides are still rated on a scale from 1 to 5.&lt;ref name=Rating&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.canadaswonderland.com/images/uploads/file/2015_GuestAssistanceGuide.pdf |title=Canada's Wonderland 2015 Guest Assistant Guide |format=PDF |publisher=Canada's Wonderland |accessdate=May 5, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304115137/https://www.canadaswonderland.com/images/uploads/file/2015_GuestAssistanceGuide.pdf |archivedate=March 4, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Late Show.jpg|200px|thumb|right|The [[Ed Sullivan Theater]], where the ''Late Show'' was taped.]]

[[CBS]]'s '''''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]''''' regularly featured different sketches that follow the monologue and precede interviews with guests. Often these are repeated [[absurdism|absurdist]] segments, involving various cast members, Dave's friends, audience participation, edited or contrived news or promotional videos, or competitions or stunts staged outside the [[Ed Sullivan Theater]]. Many of the same sketches originally debuted on Letterman's previous series, [[NBC]]'s ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' and ''[[The David Letterman Show]]''.

The show's regularly scheduled segments consisted of "Small Town News" on Mondays and "Fun Facts" on Fridays. Thursdays often featured a rotating set of three audience participation segments: "Know Your Current Events", "Stump the Band", and "Audience Show and Tell."

"Stupid Pet Tricks" and "Stupid Human Tricks", two of Letterman's trademark bits from ''Late Night'', continued to be presented on the ''Late Show'', though much less frequently.

There were also [[running gag]]s, which may continue for about a month, such as playing [[José Feliciano#Sense of humor|José Feliciano]]'s "Old Turkey Buzzard" or Do The Hammerlock Or other sound effects when a card "crashes through the window" or telephone calls from "Len Easton, California Highway Patrol" or [[Joe McCain#911 call on October 18, 2008|Joe McCain]] on a telephone that Dave acknowledges is a prop that is not connected. Dave expresses amusement or annoyance when these recurring events.&lt;sup&gt;Needs a verb.&lt;/sup&gt;

This article focuses on sketches that have been featured on the ''Late Show with David Letterman''.

==Kalter introduction==
Announcer [[Alan Kalter]]'s (and before him, [[Bill Wendell]]'s) introduction of Letterman, while technically not a skit, assigned a bizarre modification to Letterman's name and appears at the beginning of every show. ("''And now: Microscopic Sea Creature, David Letterman!''") Letterman's title changes every night and often makes reference to a current event. ("''And now: Disenfranchised French Youth, David Letterman!''")  Prior to [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11, 2001]], the first line of Wendell's and Kalter's introductions contained humorous descriptions of New York City ("''From New York!  Where the rats hate the subways, too!''").  Once the ''Late Show'' returned to air on September 17, 2001, the introduction changed simply to, "''From New York!  The ''greatest'' city in the world!''"  This remained the standard introduction for over ten years; however, "The '''greatest''' city in the world!" is omitted from episodes with guest hosts, as is the host 'title'. In 2011, Kalter took to shortening 'David' to 'Dave', in his introduction of Letterman. At some point prior to late 2012, he once again returned to using 'David'. Beginning on January 2, 2013, the introduction began "''From the heart of Broadway, broadcasting across the nation and around the world!''", while Alan also included a brief self-introduction of himself ("''I'm Alan Kalter''") after introducing Paul Shaffer &amp; The CBS Orchestra at this time as well.

==Sketch participants==
While Letterman himself often participated in many of the show's non-"desk comedy" routines in its earlier years (as well as on ''Late Night''), over time he has increasingly preferred to have others star in them instead. Letterman is now rarely featured in any of the show's frequent pre-taped bits.

Kalter, bandleader and sidekick [[Paul Shaffer]], and [[Hello Deli]] proprietor [[Rupert Jee]] are often used instead in comedy routines, as are [[stage manager]] [[Biff Henderson]], stagehands [[Pat Farmer (stagehand)|Pat Farmer]] and [[Kenny Sheehan]], [[handyman]] [[George Clarke (handyman)|George Clarke]], "[[cue card]] boy" Tony Mendez, head [[carpenter]] [[Harold Larkin]], [[cameraman]] [[Dave Dorsett]], assistant [[Stephanie Birkitt]], former writers Gerard Mulligan and [[Chris Elliott]] (who almost always appear together), and [[Johnny Dark]] (a personal comedy friend of Letterman's).

Letterman's mother, [[Dorothy Mengering|Dorothy]], also made appearances (via satellite from [[Indianapolis, Indiana|Indianapolis]]) from time to time, including each [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]]. She perhaps rose to fame mostly as a result of her nightly reporting from the [[1994 Winter Olympics]] in Norway.

Former recurring players from the show include [[Mujibur and Sirajul|Mujibur Rahman and Sirajul Islam]] (employees of a nearby gift store which has since relocated), [[Calvert DeForest]] (a.k.a. Larry "Bud" Melman), and [[scenic designer]] [[Kathleen Ankers]] (reprising her ''Late Night'' role of "Peggy, the Foulmouthed Chambermaid"; on CBS, she was the equally censored "Helen, the Ill-tempered Ticket Lady").

Random [[cameo appearance]]s were made during the span of the show, most notably in the earlier years by the [[Tony Randall]], with [[Regis Philbin]] later filling that void.

For a while, Letterman took great delight in making fun of his employer, continuing a tradition established at NBC, with senior [[CBS Corporation]] executive [[Les Moonves]] often serving as the target of his abuse. In time, Letterman's relationship with Moonves improved; a segment titled "''More with Les''" featured jocular phone calls between Letterman and Moonves.

===Alan Kalter===
Announcer Alan Kalter was frequently used in comedy bits, often with Kalter as the butt of the joke:

;Kalter the Pervert
:In some skits, Kalter is portrayed as a deluded sexual deviant, often referring to himself as "Big Red." Letterman will frequently follow them up by jokingly commenting to Shaffer on Kalter's disturbing, sickening nature, while Kalter grins mischievously. Often such skits begin with Letterman informing the audience that Kalter had approached Letterman prior to the show (about which Letterman often adds, "I've asked him not to do that"), and explaining that Kalter had asked to comment on a current news or pop cultural event.

:Kalter then begins a monologue where he speaks directly to the camera, setting up the nature of the topic (often the separation of a public couple) in a serious manner. He then addresses a separate, closer camera in a sexually provocative manner as amorous music plays in the background. The material is often a series of [[double entendre]], with Kalter offering to romantically console the woman that is the center of the issue, and ends with him making passionate moans. A disturbed Letterman then interrupts Kalter and chides him for behaving inappropriately. Kalter often ends the bit by making a provocative quip to Letterman and then rips off his headset and exits the stage in a "huff."

;Kalterworld
:Occasionally, Kalter used his segments to promote "Kalterworld", a supposed web site selling "the finest in adult toys, games, and novelties." The Kalterworld.com [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] leads to the official ''Late Show'' web site.

;"Alan Kalter Makes Your Product Sound Sexy"
:Kalter promotes an actual commercial product (such as [[Ajax (cleanser)|Ajax]]) in a provocative, suggestive manner. He then pours the product on his head and smears it on his body, often moaning as he does so and then screaming in pain as it gets into his eyes. A bland voice-over then encourages companies to participate in the segment by submitting their own product to a particular address.

;Kalter the Singer
:Kalter is introduced with the implication that he will provide a serious commentary on current events, but instead exuberantly sings a contemporary pop song filled with sexual innuendos (often from the female perspective). Songs thus far have included "[[My Humps]]" on "Alan Kalter's Political Roundup", "[[Don't Cha]]" on "Alan Kalter's Mideast Update" and "[[London Bridge (Fergie song)|London Bridge]]." As he performs, Kalter struts across the stage with a disturbed and annoyed Letterman visible at his desk, and ultimately exits at the other side.

;Kalter Gets Maimed
:The show will often employ bits where severe bodily harm is supposedly inflicted on Kalter (such as when a [[cocktail waitress]] walks across the stage in Kalter's direction and then tosses the drink into his face). He then writhes on the ground groaning and acting as if in serious pain. A wry Letterman will sometimes advise an inattentive Kalter to use a medication normally used for more mild injuries, such as [[Neosporin]] or [[Ibuprofin]].

;The Guy Who Beats Up Alan
:In one recurring gag, Kalter will make a statement on a particular topic, only to have a large man appear from nowhere and object to Kalter's comments. He then proceeds to pummel him, which results in Kalter rolling on the ground in agony, and storms off backstage. Letterman will often amusedly ridicule the obviously fake nature of the violence, as the man's blows never come anywhere near Kalter, despite Kalter's best efforts to sell his pain. ("That last punch came at least within a foot.")

:Later the beatings were followed up by pre-taped pieces, in which the relationship between Alan and the man who beats him (identified as "Brian") was shown to be more complicated. One sketch involved Kalter catching Brian being "unfaithful" by beating up another man on the street, and the two being heartbroken by the event. Another followed Brian punching Kalter in the face despite his "Not the face!" pleas. After Brian storms off backstage, a video shows Brian expressing guilt to his wife or girlfriend about his abuse towards Kalter, fearing it was "pushing him away." The two later make up at the end with Brian meeting Kalter and punching him in the stomach instead of the face, much to Kalter's happiness. The videos are presented in a mock romance-drama style, with a soundtrack of emotional pop songs.

;"TV's Uncle Jerry"
:In 2006, Alan began to introduce himself by saying "I'm Alan Kalter, TV's Uncle Jerry", much to Letterman's delight at first, but over time Letterman would regard the moniker with faux-irritation, which appeared to be part of the joke. In August of that year, several weeks after the bit started, the ''Late Show'' aired a clip from a new, fake CBS domestic [[sitcom]] entitled "Oh, Brother!" where Kalter played the aforementioned "Uncle Jerry" character. In the clip, Jerry abandons babysitting his brother's children on his wedding anniversary to instead join a friend at a [[bar (establishment)|bar]] who had met two [[flight attendants]]. He then uses a would-be catch-phrase: "Hey, Uncle Jerry's gonna get ''busy''!" Despite introducing the clip with some enthusiasm, Letterman quickly dismissed it afterwards, saying "That sucked! That just sucked!" Kalter has taken to introducing himself as other beloved television characters such as TV's Professor Withers, TV's Johnny Mambo and TV's Uptown Ricky Brown. He has also introduced himself as "TV's [[Howie Mandel]]", to which Dave said that made no sense at all.

;"Alan Kalter's Campaign Roundup"
:A near-daily [[running gag]] presented late in the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential election]] season began with Letterman introducing Kalter, who would ostensibly give a summary of the latest campaign news. Instead, Kalter would perform an energetic rendition of the chorus to "[[Who Let the Dogs Out?]]" which was a popular and ubiquitous song at the time, and walk across the stage. In the skit's later occurrences, Kalter would sometimes rip off his shirt as he sang (revealing a pale and flabby physique), while adding a manic and deranged tone to his performance. Kalter has demonstrated a compulsion to disrobe in many of his other segments before and since.

;Alan Punches Someone Out
:In another long-running gag, Kalter would take issue with something said at his expense, such as a Top Ten List entry, or a letter read during the "CBS Mailbag" segment. Kalter would press Letterman about the statement, asking "Did he ''really'' say that?" and Letterman would confirm its accuracy. Kalter would then leave the stage to hunt down the person who said it, usually up in the ''Late Show'' offices. During his transit, an individual would often greet Kalter with "Hi, Alan!" only to be ignored. Upon finding the guilty party, Kalter would then punch him out and walk away with a look of satisfaction. In one instance, the person on the receiving end was Regis Philbin, who had just been shown in a "[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]" clip where a question described Kalter as "creepy."

;Alan Kalter's Celebrity Interview
:Occasionally after the first or second guest, Letterman will turn over the show to Kalter, who's supposed to conduct an interview of his own with a celebrity. Invariably, it turns out the guest booked for "Celebrity Interview", who is seated next to Kalter, has already appeared on the show as the first or second guest earlier that night. An angry Kalter accuses Letterman of deliberately booking the same person as a regular guest on the show in an attempt to sabotage Kalter's segment and steal the limelight. The sketch typically ends with Kalter storming off the stage after hurling insults at Letterman, as well as the celebrity interviewee, who usually deadpans confusion or mortification.

==Regular sketches==
When Letterman left NBC and moved to CBS to begin the ''Late Show'' in the summer of 1993, several of ''Late Night's'' long-running comedy bits made the move with him, including perhaps his best known, the [[Top Ten list (David Letterman)|Top Ten List]].  Letterman renamed a few of his regular bits to avoid legal problems over [[trademark]] infringement (NBC claimed that what he did on ''Late Night'' was "[[intellectual property]]" of the network). For example, "Viewer Mail" on NBC became the "CBS Mailbag", and Larry "Bud" Melman began to use his real name, [[Calvert DeForest]].

One recurring sketch on both the NBC and CBS shows has been the destruction of household items by various methods including explosives, steamrollers, and - most often - throwing them off the roof of the Ed Sullivan Theater. While popular with fans, Letterman gradually lessened the frequency of such segments.

Letterman also has a knack for consuming food products and drinks that appear on his show. Among the items that he has consumed are: wine from a bottle used for a cooking demonstration; various kinds of liquor (while quipping "''We're gonna lose our liquor license''"); [[Popeyes]] "''Full Flavor Green Beans'';" "''motor oil''" (actually [[chocolate syrup]]) from a bottle that bore a "[[SOPUS Products|Quaker State]]" label; [[Red Bull]]; liquid from a bottle that supposedly contained [[Wite-Out]]; pills from boxes labeled "[[Lipitor]]" and "[[Cialis]]" (obviously not really the drugs); and even [[cosmetics|cosmetic products]]. On one occasion, Letterman took a healthy swig of "low-carb suntan lotion" and immediately spit it out, having discovered that it actually ''was'' suntan lotion.

''The Late Show'' is well known for its repeated [[absurdism|absurdist]] segments, often taking the form of competitions or audience participation. The charm of such segments is often that they are completely pointless, yet are taken seriously by Letterman and all involved.

===Top Ten List===
The [[Top 10 List|Top Ten List]] appears almost daily on the ''Late Show'', and remains one of the few regular segments carried over from ''Late Night.'' It is often the last comedic segment presented prior to the show's first guest. List topics are often inspired by current news and pop cultural events, with typical lists bearing titles such as "Top Ten Signs..." and "Top Ten Reasons..." The Top Ten List is compiled by the show's writing staff, and is usually read by Letterman, although the show occasionally uses guest presenters. Some Top Ten List themes reappear seasonally, such as the carolers singing "Top Ten Least Popular Holiday Songs."[http://lateshow.cbs.com/latenight/lateshow/top_ten/index/php/20081218.phtml]

For a long time, the Top Ten Lists were said to have been written in a so-called "Home Office". There were various Home Offices before the part was dropped, but the list included [[Sioux City, Iowa]]; [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]]; and [[Wahoo, Nebraska]] - all actual, extant towns. (''Late Show'' staffer [[Mike McIntee]]'s nightly online recap of the show, the "[http://www.cbs.com/latenight/lateshow/wahoo Wahoo Gazette]," is named after the Nebraska town.)

The Top Ten List has occasionally been a casualty of time constraints.  Letterman may announce that the Top Ten List is coming up, or Kalter will promote it before the first commercial, when, in fact, it is not delivered on that night's show and is instead held until the next morning, when it is broadcast across [[Westwood One (1976–2011)|Westwood One]]/[[CBS Radio Network]].

===Great Moments in Presidential Speeches===
''Great Moments in Presidential Speeches'' was a near-daily segment which presented a series of three video excerpts. Originally, the first two come from actual famous moments, [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s inaugural speech ("The only thing we have to fear is fear itself") and [[John F. Kennedy]]'s inaugural speech ("Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country").

The third excerpt featured President [[George W. Bush]] in an unintentionally comical moment, often during press conferences or town hall gatherings. These moments frequently focused on President Bush stuttering, finding himself at a loss for words, or uttering a nonsensical [[Bushism]]. The excerpts were also often taken out of context for humorous effect, such as when Bush declared, "My kids can't read!", "[[Alberto Gonzales|My lawyer's a Latino]]" or "Why should I care about Africa?"

The "Great Moments" presentation also featured [[Dwight Eisenhower]], [[Harry S. Truman]], [[Jimmy Carter]], [[Ronald Reagan]], [[Bill Clinton]], and even [[George H. W. Bush|President Bush's father]], followed by Bush himself. One adaptation was of President Kennedy's Berlin speech, with the words "[[Ich bin ein Berliner]]", followed by President [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]]'s Berlin speech ("Mr. [[Mikhail Gorbachev|Gorbachev]], [[tear down this wall]]") in 1987 (Reagan was also featured in another Letterman skit "The Reagan Diaries"), and as always, an excerpt from President Bush's recent speeches. An [[Abraham Lincoln]] [[impostor]] (Johnny Dark) has also given the "Tear down this wall" speech. President [[Lyndon Johnson]] made his debut on "Great Moments" with his declaration not to seek [[1968 U.S. Presidential Election|reelection in 1968]].  [[George Washington]]'s, [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s, Roosevelt's, and Kennedy's portraits were shown in the graphic at the beginning and end of "Great Moments."

After a few months into the segment's inception, the Kennedy inauguration clip began to include a ''Late Show'' staffer (often dressed in formal period garb) superimposed over the empty seat to Kennedy's right. The staffers included announcer [[Alan Kalter]], "cue card boy" [[Tony Mendez (Late Show)|Tony "Inky" Mendez]] (who showed cue cards to President Kennedy), costume designer [[Susan Hum]] (whose actions included taking his picture with a disposable camera, removing lint from his shoulder, stealing his wallet, and eating a jumbo pretzel), associate producer [[Nancy Agostini]], and stage manager [[Biff Henderson]].  All "cameos" ended with the staffers clapping along in real-time response to Kennedy's speech.

After the incident when an [[Muntadhar al-Zaidi|Iraqi journalist]] threw his shoes at Bush, flying shoes were shown in the introductory vignettes of the other Presidents, including shoes thrown at [[Abraham Lincoln]] giving the [[Gettysburg Address]].

The last airing of the sketch involving Bush was January 16, four days before the inauguration of President [[Barack Obama]].

The first airing of the sketch after President Obama entered office was Monday January 26, 2009, but the Obama speech that was captured appeared to have no comedic value, thus heralding the beginning of the Obama presidency as well as fulfilling the actual purpose of the Great Moments segment. On the next GMIPS, aired January 28, 2009, President Obama's face was superimposed over the body of former President Bush in one of his speeches, pretending that Obama was speaking comically, but it was actually the voice of President Bush. After that, other sketches, such as "This Day in the Clinton Marriage", were substituted in the time slot when "Great Moments" previously appeared.

===Will It Float?===
An item is dropped into a tank of water by two [[Model (person)|models]], often referred to by Letterman as "The Hi-Ho Girls." The segment starts out with Kalter identifying a household item that will be tested, and a faux prize that is supposedly at stake. A picture of that prize is flashed on screen for a split second. Letterman and Shaffer debate the [[buoyancy|buoyant]] properties of the item before they each decide on whether it will sink or float (a frequent deciding factor is the nature of the item's container).

Two models then drop the item into the tank while the ''Late Show'' "Hula Hoop Girl" (Anna Jack) and "Grinder Girl" (Kiva Kahl) perform on either side of the tank. Depending upon the outcome, large flashing words appear reading, "It Floats!" (accompanied by a ringing bell) or "It Sinks!" (accompanied by a buzzer).

Letterman often espouses the educational merit of the game in jest, citing positive feedback from parents, educators, and clergymen. He has acknowledged that while the segment is not popular with the ''Late Show'' staff, he insists on continuing it for his own amusement. Letterman joked that the skit was adapted from a similar [[BBC]] programme entitled "Is It Buoyant?" He also often advertises the (fictional) "Will It Float" home game, which "has everything you need in a box to play the game for only $19.99." The game consists only of a list of suggested household items and a bottle of water. Recently{{When|date=March 2011}}, Letterman has also been advertising the [[PlayStation 3]] version of the "Will It Float?" home game, and in the past would highlight the [[Xbox 360]] version. At one point, he issued viewers a warning to stay away from the knockoff version, "Does it Sink?", which could be found being hawked by street vendors on Canal Street. After the game is over, Letterman often addresses the women by saying he will see them at "the big 'Will It Float?' party" after the show.

===Is This Anything?===
In this segment, the stage curtain is raised to reveal an individual or team performing an unusual [[stunt]], often accompanied by music from the [[CBS Orchestra]]. Flanking the performer, who varies, are two previous performers who became regulars for the segment:

* The "Hula Hoop Girl" (Anna Jack), who spins numerous [[hula hoop]]s around different parts of her body, and
* The "Grinder Girl" (Kiva Kahl), who operates a [[Angle grinder|hand-held grinder]] against metal parts of her costume, producing sparks.

After about thirty seconds the curtain is lowered and Letterman discusses with Shaffer whether the act was "something" or "nothing." As the segment continued over the course of time, Letterman would increasingly express disinterest in the featured performer, opting instead to admire the Grinder Girl. Shaffer in turn would often admit to having been too distracted with his performance of the music.

On an episode in June 2003, the curtain rose to reveal members of the [[Stanley Cup]] champion [[New Jersey Devils]]. [[Martin Brodeur]] hoisted the trophy, leading the crowd in a chant of "Devils! Devils!" Letterman and Shaffer ruled it as definitely "something."

''Is This Anything'' lay dormant for almost a year before it was resurrected on the March 22, 2006 episode.  A man balanced himself on a ladder and juggled: [[Paul Shaffer]] voted a clear "nothing", and Letterman was going to vote "something" before he noticed a safety mat.  Letterman then concurred with Shaffer.

In an uncharacteristic move, Letterman invited [[Sharon Osbourne]] to assist in officiating ''Is This Anything'' on the July 26, 2007 episode, due to her involvement with ''[[America's Got Talent]]''.  The act consisted of a man balancing an aluminum ladder on his chin while riding a unicycle, and all three agreed that it was nothing.

===Small Town News===
Often presented on Mondays, Letterman presents a series of actual news items, advertisements, and [[police]] blotter excerpts which are shown to be unintentionally humorous. In earlier incarnations, Letterman would precede the segment by asking the audience to "please wait for the humorous comment", which consisted of him reciting a scripted follow-up to each news item. While this ostensibly differentiated the segment from Jay Leno's similar sketch, "[[Headlines (Jay Leno)|Headlines]]" (though "Small Town News" was a segment on Late Night from its 1982 inception, and even appeared on Letterman's 1980 daytime show), the later revival of "Small Town News" only includes an occasional impromptu remark from Letterman. On at least one occasion, Letterman has claimed that Leno's headlines is a copy of the sketch.

===Audience participation games===
Thursday episodes usually include one of three rotating variations of audience participation segments. Each game starts with Letterman making small talk with each of the featured audience members, asking about their background and occupations, often with humorous results. When the individual has completed their portion, they are given a gift certificate to a local restaurant as well as random gift items. Occasionally, the participant is a [[List of sports idioms#R|ringer]] from the show staff.

;Know Your Current Events
:In what Letterman describes as "America's Fastest Growing Quiz Sensation", a "contestant" is chosen from the audience to play a quiz game. He or she first chooses a category. Besides the title category, there are often a total of "six big ways to win big", with other categories being topical and often esoteric, and rarely reappearing. Some of these have included "Know Your [[Home Depot]] Locations in [[Delaware]]", "Know Your Late Show Production Accountant Joe DeGeorge", "Know Your Department Store Return Policies", and "Know Your Shocking Facts about [[Peter Jennings]]." Some categories are merely for show; in the event a fake category is picked, Letterman will encourage the contestant to pick a different category.

:A regular category is "Know Your Cuts of [[Meat]]", which itself consists of five categories: [[beef]], [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]], [[veal]], [[pork]], and [[Offal|"variety meats"]], as Shaffer heavily accentuates when he chuckles and says, "Variety meats, David." After playing, the individual is also rewarded with a box of assorted meat cuts from "Lobel's: pound for pound, the finest butcher shop in the world."

:Throughout the course of the segment's history on the show, Letterman has varied back and forth between discreetly feeding the contestants the answers, and making them guess.

:Each selected category is accompanied by a brief theme song, based on ''[[Nobody but Me (The Human Beinz song)|Nobody But Me]]''.

;Stump the Band
:This is a variation of the segment from [[Johnny Carson]]'s (and earlier, [[Jack Paar]]'s) tenure on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|The Tonight Show]]''. A pre-selected audience member requests an obscure song from the CBS Orchestra, which then performs a humorous pre-scripted song based only on the title of the requested song (often a [[parody]] of a more popular song). The band will then jokingly insist that they have correctly played the song, only to be told otherwise by the individual, who then performs the actual song. The novelty song "[[Wadaliacha]]" is a recurring joke on the show, having been suggested multiple times, but yet never performed right. However, on more than one occasion, the audience member affirmed that the band correctly performed the song, which always surprised Letterman and Shaffer, since the performances were meant to be humorously inaccurate. These segments often feature a segment with Shaffer in character as [[Carnac the Magnificent]], another Carson carryover.

;Audience Show and Tell
:This revolves around a pre-selected audience member relating an anecdote, presenting a personal item of note, or demonstrating a hidden talent.

===Fun Facts===

Usually presented on Fridays, the segment consists of Letterman reading a series of trivia, records, and statistics. Letterman explains that the "Fun Facts" are submitted to the show each week by "Gary Sherman", the head of the fictional "Federal Bureau of Miscellaneous Information" (FBMI) and a supposed acquaintance of Shaffer whom Letterman claims he met at Shaffer's wedding. The segment often begins with Letterman presenting a few real facts to set up the premise (although they are often of a humorous nature in their own right and are mistaken by some audience members as made-up). He then presents several humorous, fictional "facts." Most of these are of an absurdist nature, such as "The first pair of [[binoculars]] had a 1x magnification", or "For a short amount of time, the rock band [[The Who]] broke up, and formed two new bands called The When and The What." An irrelevant promotional announcement of some kind is mixed in on occasion, much to Letterman's confusion.

The segment was initially presented on the show sporadically before being made a regular weekly feature. Letterman is also promoting a Fun Facts book (unlike the ''Will it Float?'' game, a real book, {{ISBN|978-1-4013-2307-3}}).

===Hello Deli Games===
A camera crew is sent to [[Rupert Jee]] in the neighboring Hello Deli, where Jee is asked to invite a potential player from the crowd outside. The player introduces him or herself, relates his or her background, and is told what prize is to be won. Regardless of the outcome, the player is also awarded a "Hello Deli Platter" by the Hi-Ho Girls.

Recurring games include "Beat the Clock"—echoing the title of [[Beat the Clock|a game show from the early days of television]]—in which the confused player helplessly attempts to stop a clock from counting down to zero, and "What's on the [[iPod]]?", in which Rupert tunelessly sings{{dubious|reason= More like "tries to recite the lyrics, phrase by phrase"; i question whether he was even &gt;trying&lt; to sing|date= October 2016}} along to a song on his iPod and the contestant has to guess what song he is listening to.

Other games involve a player searching for a hidden item in the deli, and guessing the nature of an item obscured under an item of clothing worn by Jee (such as a [[Hillary Clinton]]-esque{{according to whom|date=October 2016|Note= Does this perhaps mean "with very long and straight, almost cylindrical, jackets"?}} [[pantsuit]]). Occasionally, the supposed player is a "[[Plant (professional wrestling)|plant]]" and the segment ends when the "player" appears to be severely injured. [[Johnny Dark]] has appeared, under various names, as the contestant, in which case the routine consists of him asking so many questions that there is no time for the game itself. [[Biff Henderson]] has hosted similar games on the street.

===Stupid Pet Tricks/Stupid Human Tricks===

These segments were carried over from ''Late Night'', and consist of three pre-selected participants (or in the case of "Pet Tricks", pets and their owners), who each demonstrate an unusual talent or stunt on the stage. Letterman will often precede the segment with the tongue-in-cheek warning: "Remember, this is not a competition, it is only an exhibition — please, no wagering." While still a trademark feature of the ''Late Show'', the segment has been featured on a more sporadic basis in recent years. The show's regular "Audience Show and Tell" bit will often include an audience member performing a "Stupid Human Trick"-type act.

===Explod-O-Pop===
Explod-O-Pop is a brand of [[popping corn]], and is usually given as a prize to the participants of the audience participation games. Letterman often describes the product using various slogans such as "America's Only Atomic Popping Corn", "It's Carbolicious", and "It's Contaminated with Flavor!"

It was available at CBS's online store, with the proceeds benefitting the [[The Letterman Foundation for Courtesy and Grooming|American Foundation for Courtesy and Grooming]], a charity of Letterman's which contributes its proceeds to a wide variety of foundations, most of which are of a health, youth, or educational nature.

===Audience sweep===

Late in the show, a short segment will consist of a camera panning across the audience as it applauds during the break. A comedy piece will usually be superimposed above this video; in most cases this is either a graphic presenting a game or announcement narrated by Kalter, or a comedy piece featuring Kalter himself. Since returning from the hiatus caused by the [[2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike]], however, these segments now usually feature a Kalter voice-over promoting future guests, concluded by a phrase such as "Get your VCRs ready!"

;Games

:Games often consist of parodies of simple time-killers such as word jumbles or quizzes. One example consists of the viewer being shown a short jumble where the letters are barely mixed up, seemingly making for an obvious answer. When the letters are supposedly shuffled into their "correct" order, the answer will actually consist of a completely different, longer set of letters.

;Announcements

:Some examples of announcements include "Late Show Reminders" (advising viewers to set their VCR for an "upcoming" episode featuring guests that have already appeared earlier that very night), "contest winners" (such as a supposed "My Pet Looks Like Dave" contest), and promotions for "all-new" episodes of old CBS shows, such as ''[[Jake and the Fatman]]''.

;Bored Kalter

:A common example of Kalter's audience sweep comedy bits consists only of a silent and apathetic Kalter engaging in some mundane activity, such as eating or shaving.

===The Quiz Machine===
During the mid-1990s a frequent ''Late Show'' routine was The Quiz Machine, a large device wheeled out onto the stage, which progressively got bigger and more advanced as weeks went on.  The Quiz Machine contained answers to questions that Letterman had on his note cards, and would be revealed by contestants pushing buttons or pulling levers.  Frequently the machine failed to work, adding to its humor.  In a notable appearance by Bill Gates, dressed in lab coat and hard hat, he joked that if Microsoft would have invented a machine this bad, he would have it recalled.

==Non-regular sketches==
;[[7-Eleven]] Giveaways
:Letterman introduces a man claiming to be James Keyes, President and CEO of 7-Eleven, who then announces to the audience and viewers of the convenience store's latest promotional tie-in with the ''Late Show''. The announcements first began with a commemoration of the date of July 11, 2006 ("7-11"), when all 7-Eleven stores would supposedly give away free Slurpees, hot dogs, and muffins to anyone who said "Dave sent me!" (all items were said to be paid for by Letterman). Since then, the man portraying Keyes (actor [https://www.backstage.com/RogerRathburn/ Roger Rathburn]) has sporadically appeared, enthusiastically announcing other food item giveaways and lavish prize drawings. After the man walks off stage, Shaffer then asks Letterman if the man really is president and CEO of 7-Eleven, only to have Letterman reluctantly admit that he isn't.

;"Action News"
:Letterman will occasionally interrupt a bit for "Action News", a bit that mocks "teaser" promos for local newscasts. Dave will look to the camera to his left and read a fake news headline with an ostensibly disingenuous smile and cheery demeanor. On the screen, in the style of a newscast, appears a news graphic next to Dave's face and the legend "Dave Letterman, Action News" at the bottom of the screen. After delivering the headline, Dave will then turn to the camera to his right and deliver another fake headline. He'll then "promote" Action News ''("That's all coming up tonight on 'Action News.'")'', and then return to the original bit as if nothing had happened. Occasionally, a weather reporter from an actual CBS affiliate will also deliver a pre-recorded fake weather tease. "Action News" most frequently interrupts "[[Sketches on Letterman#Fun Facts|Fun Facts]]", although it occasionally interrupts other bits, including the Top Ten List. "Action News" began appearing in early 2008.

;Cameraman Dave Dorsett Leaves the Theatre
:During the segment of the show following the monologue, Letterman will be setting up a comedy bit when the camera trained on him begins to drift downward and stops with Letterman's head out of frame. Letterman will continue for several seconds before noticing the camera's new position, when he stops his bit and asks the cameraman, Dave Dorsett, what is happening. Dorsett explains that he has to leave the theatre for one reason or another (normally tied to a hyped event such as a new movie or video game release), and speaks of his disdain for the show as he exits through the guest entrance. The camera remains in its resting position for the remainder of the segment, causing Letterman to have to lean down and turn his head sideways to get into the shot. In another variation, Dorsett will not leave the studio, but will be preoccupied with something else, such as reading. When the show returns from commercial, the camera shot is back to normal.

;Campaign 2000
:Throughout the summer and fall of 2000, Dave and the cast (featuring producer Maria Pope) would ostensibly recap the latest on the presidential campaign between [[Al Gore]] and [[George W. Bush]].  An opening animation would roll accompanied by the orchestra, after which Alan Kalter would read a series of "sponsors", which included party ice (available in clear, semi-clear and opaque), the "ComposTumbler", onetime informercial sensation [[Hairagami]] and the then-new "Liquid Plumbr Foaming Pipe Snake".  One of the most notable (and well-worn) bits from this segment was a video clip of then-candidate Bush whispering (despite an open lavalier microphone) to [[Dick Cheney]] that a reporter was a "major league asshole", to which Cheney chuckled back "Oh, big time."  Outside this, however, it was common for Campaign 2000 to include no campaign-related content whatsoever.

:Coincidentally, that was the same summer in which ''[[Survivor (U.S. TV series)|Survivor]]'' achieved its initial meteoric success.  Campaign 2000 segments on days following new Survivor episodes (usually Monday, but occasionally other days) soon included that week's eliminated castaway.  Dave often feigned disinterest with the castoffs, forcing them to stand next to Pope at the producer's podium; in fact, only one contestant, [[Elisabeth Hasselbeck|Elisabeth Filarski]] from ''[[Survivor: The Australian Outback]]'', was ever invited to sit in a guest chair.  Generally Dave would ask the contestants irrelevant, nonsensical questions; over time, he began to work [[Stephanie Birkitt]] into the segment, initially calling her upstairs in the office and later having her appear on stage in costume.  She would routinely ask the castaways, "Did you see or touch any monkeys?" to which Dave would scold her.  As time passed, she would promise, increasingly vehemently, not to ask the question and then ask it anyway.

:For reasons unknown, the Campaign 2000 segment would appear at first regularly and then sporadically into 2001 (retaining the name "Campaign 2000"); Dave would feign exasperation at discovering its inclusion in the show, open the segment, and immediately close it without any of the "sponsors" or jokes.

;"CBS Mailbag"
:A ''Late Show'' staple on Fridays (originally Thursdays) until it was phased out in Letterman's later years (the last time it aired was December 3, 2004), the CBS Mailbag carried on the ''Late Night'' tradition of taking actual viewer letters (usually four at a time), and responding to each of them with a pre-written comedy routine. This segment was a carryover from ''Late Night'', where it was known by the name "Viewer Mail;" NBC kept the segment when Letterman moved to CBS, though he quickly revived it under the "CBS Mailbag" name. "[[Please Mr. Postman]]" was the segment's theme song for the last few years (replacing the "We Get Letters" theme from ''The Perry Como Show'' that was originally used).

;"Charts and Graphs"
:Letterman displays poster boards with various charts and graphs, usually with the last element on each being the absurd one. (Pie Chart: What will be the top priority of the next president? 43%: Stabilizing [[Iraq]]. 31%: Stabilizing climate change. 26% Stabilizing ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]''.)

;"A Day in the Life of..." (such as "A Day in the Life of George W. Bush")
:A slide show with the time of day indicated on each slide, accompanied by a humorous caption, such as "4:30 p.m. Receives FTD's 'Good Luck Bouquet' from Osama bin Laden", "5:30 p.m. [[Yoo-Hoo]] break", "6:00 p.m. Nap."

;"Fun with Rupert"
:One of the most popular pre-taped pieces during the show's earlier years was a ''[[Candid Camera]]''-style bit which featured the normally mild-mannered [[Rupert Jee]] interacting with ordinary, unsuspecting people around the city. Letterman - usually hidden in a van - would covertly observe the action and provide a disguised Jee (wearing a cap, glasses, backpack, and headphones) with ad-libbed instructions via two-way communication. This resulted in Jee performing humorous and unusual antics while amusing, confusing, and in some cases irritating, various victims. The segment was ceased after an unaired incident in which Letterman would only explain that a man had pulled a knife on Jee. It was unofficially revived in a few live bits in 2006 where Jee (not in disguise) would visit a neighboring restaurant and perform similar antics.

;George Clarke's "It's a Fact"
:Handyman Clarke is seen backstage, bloodied and severely injured from an earlier incident. He addresses the camera, indirectly explaining the incident by imparting advice such as "Women on the street don't like to be called 'Candy Pants.'" He will then point to the camera and say, "It's a ''fact''!"

;The Guy Who Swears at Dave
:A man, often portraying a ''Late Show'' staffer, calls out Letterman, expressing his irritation with him. He then addresses Kalter and Shaffer in turn, [[Finger (gesture)|flipping off]] each while shouting something that is [[Bleep censor|bleep]]ed. He then repeats this with Letterman, using both hands and repeating the same phrase with extra emphasis. He then storms away, much to the shock of the three men. One time, after Dave and Paul decided that an "[[Sketches featured on Late Show with David Letterman#Is This Anything?|Is This Anything]]" act was nothing, the performer turned out to be the Guy, who then went into that routine. After a Stupid Pet Trick, in which a dog barked at someone giving it the finger, Dave said that he hoped the dog would not run into the Guy backstage, but in the segue before the next commercial, they were together.

;"How Many Guys in... Suits Can Get into a ...?"
:Examples include "How Many Guys in Spider-Man Suits Can Get Into a [[Jamba Juice]]?" and "How Many Guys in Pirate Costumes Can Fit Into A Sandwich Shop?" As the title indicates, the camera is focused on a local establishment, and Dave counts the number of persons wearing the costumes entering the store (first one at a time, then "send in 5 more") until the store is crowded.  The bit usually ends with persons in other random costumes being sent in, like a horse, tooth fairy, panda bear or wizard.

;"Late Show Equations"
:Similar in concept to "Charts and Graphs", except there is a slide covering the comic answer to the equation. ("A rollercoaster + the smell of goat = New York City cab ride.")

;"NBC 4 News Update"
:A portion of a news report from [[WNBC]] in New York City is aired and then at the very end of the clip is punctuated by [[Sue Simmons]]'s infamous "What the (censored) are you doing?" outburst.

;"On 53rd Street"
:A [[Stunt performer|daredevil]] demonstrates his or her skills outside the theater (such as [[Tony Hawk]] performing skateboarding jumps), a half-ton pumpkin is exploded on the street, or dogs compete in the Diving Dog Competition (in which the dogs long jump into a pool). The remainder of one show was canceled when a snowboarder was injured while performing a stunt.[http://www.cnn.com/2004/SHOWBIZ/TV/02/06/letterman.accident/index.html]

;[[Osama bin Laden]] Tapes
:Usually on the heels of recent news reports of actual [[propaganda]] video announcements released by bin Laden or [[Al-Qaeda]], the ''Late Show'' will present their own satires of such videos. Often this consists of a stock clip of bin Laden speaking into a microphone, with the audio being overdubbed. The new dialogue will range from bin Laden partaking in distinctly American pastimes (such as giving personal [[American football|football]] predictions) to providing Al-Qaeda members with mundane advice (such as staying home during periods of extreme weather).

:A common conclusion to the bin Laden parodies depicts him putting down his microphone, only to pick it back up and declare in a blasé manner: "Oh, and [[death to America]]."

;"Pat and Kenny Read [[Oprah Winfrey|Oprah]] [[Transcription (linguistics)|Transcripts]]"
:The segment starts with a taped opening theme song, in which stagehands Pat Farmer and Kenny Sheehan perform a brief re-enactment of Winfrey's opening sequence ("Run on with Oprah"). Then Farmer and Sheehan read from an actual transcript of an episode of ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'', usually involving a female celebrity guest, with Farmer taking the part of Winfrey and Sheehan the guest. Each read their lines in a distinctly monotone fashion, in humorous contrast to the enthusiastic nature of the original interview (which often includes Winfrey utterances such as "Woo hoo!" and "You go, girl!" to Letterman's amusement). During the reading, Sheehan sports a [[cigarette]] consisting mostly of ash which rarely breaks off. On some occasions the absurd nature of the bit will cause the two to break character (more often just Sheehan). At the end of the routine, Kalter gives an address for where to write to obtain a transcript of ''Pat and Kenny Read Oprah Transcripts''.  He finishes with a plug for "PK -- The Pat &amp; Kenny Magazine" which is shown onscreen, and styled after Oprah's [[O, The Oprah Magazine]].

;Pat Farmer's "Surprise, You're on TV!"
:Presented as a supposed clip from Farmer's own reality prank show, Farmer is seen standing next to an unsuspecting male victim in an ordinary setting, such as an elevator. Farmer is then shown to be holding a baseball bat, which he uses to strike the man in the pelvic area. As the man doubles over in pain, Farmer will address him and point to the camera, saying "Surprise, you’re on TV!" Ostensibly this is a blunt satire of reality shows which utilize [[low culture|lowbrow]] physical humor, such as ''[[Jackass (TV series)|Jackass]]'', as well as slapstick shows such as ''[[America's Funniest Home Videos]]''.

;"...Quiz" (such as the "Auto Show Quiz", "Boat Show Quiz", and "Toy Show Quiz")
:Letterman presents video clips of people at a current event, on which is superimposed a multiple choice question, with the last choice being the punchline.  For example the circus is in town.  A slide shows a couple of clowns performing with a mode of transportation not quite visible with the question being "These brave and daring clowns are performing on A) An Unicycle, B) A small Car, or C) A small bear that devoured Regis Philbin.

;"Rejected [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] Products"
:A desk segment where Letterman displays samples of bad food concepts, such as "NyQuil Dessert Topping", and eats some of them. Likely inspired by the Topps card series ''[[Wacky Packages]]'', which utilizes a similar emphasis on food.

;"Sorry, Tom"
:Letterman will explain that while not a scheduled guest, actor [[Tom Hanks]] is waiting backstage to make a surprise appearance. Hanks is then shown in the [[green room]], smiling and waving to the delight of the audience. Letterman then informs Hanks that the show doesn’t have enough time for him, causing Hanks to yell at an individual off-screen (ostensibly including obscenities). In reality, the footage of Hanks is a recycled clip from his visit on a much older episode, recorded specifically for later use in this bit. A notable use of this bit occurred during an interview with Hanks' own actor son, [[Colin Hanks|Colin]]. (Hanks also does many other comedy bits for the show whenever he's a guest, from making a glass-breaking noise, to a memorable "Audience Q &amp; A" where he posed as a seat-filler for a member of the audience and was told "Wanna get outta my seat now, Fathead" by the angry woman.)

;Susan Hum
:As Letterman presents a comedy bit or converses with Shaffer, costume designer Hum will approach his desk carrying a food or drink item. Only after some time will Letterman acknowledge Hum, who will then inform him of the item she has with her. She then stands silently as Letterman attempts to proceed with the show. After noticing that she is still there, he will politely inform her that he is not interested in the item, provoking Hum to angrily insult Letterman (and sometimes throw the item to the floor) and walk off stage.

;Ticket Scalper
:Letterman will be setting up a bit when a man wearing a ski cap and jacket walks onto the set behind Dave and nervously and quietly gets Dave's attention and offers to sell him scalped tickets to a high-profile sporting event or concert that has already taken place. Dave points out that the man is obviously holding tickets to the past year's [[Super Bowl]] (which is when the bits began), and that the current event for which he's trying to sell tickets has already taken place. The man will then quickly change his story, announcing another event which grab's Dave's attention. Dave pulls out his wallet and approaches the man, when the nervous broker thinks he hears the police and both he and Dave quickly scatter. Dave then returns to his original bit.

;''Weekend Late Show''
:On Friday shows, Letterman sometimes threw to a promotion for a purported Saturday edition of the ''Late Show''. The hosts, identified only as Bruce and Linda, discussed "upcoming" features, which might include interviews with B-list celebrities and cooking segments. The segment served as a parody of the weekend editions of [[breakfast television|network morning news shows]] (e.g. ''[[Weekend Today]]'' and ''[[CBS This Morning|CBS This Morning Saturday]]''); these editions normally have different hosts and an even greater focus on [[human interest]] stories than their weekday counterparts.

:Letterman often spent a great deal of time complaining about the ''Weekend Late Show'', and especially about Bruce, whom he felt should "be in prison".  ''The Weekend Late Show'' was ostensibly cancelled as of the episode of February 15, 2013, when Letterman walked into the midst of a ''Weekend Late Show'' promotion and fired Bruce and Linda.  However, by March, Bruce and Linda were back on a recurring basis to promote their hosting of the very similar ''Showbiz Weekend'', a show Letterman frequently calls "unwatchable" and "even worse" than the cancelled ''Weekend Late Show''.

== Recurring comedy bits ==
The following is a partial list of recurring comedy bits that now{{when|date=June 2018}} appear on the show on a sporadic basis, as well as other notable bits from the show's past:

* Alan Kalter's "Are You F*cking Kidding Me?" segment, which questions the sanity behind major news stories (for example, after the [[Michael Jackson]] verdict, Kalter's response: "Are You F*cking Kidding Me?!!")
* Alan Kalter's "Oh No You Didn't!" in which Kalter mentions a recent news story (such as a 5-week working vacation George W. Bush had once announced) and then says "Oh No You Di-int!", which is immediately followed by a mention of a celebrity who has recently done something which Alan finds sexy, and a "Oh, yes you ''did.''"
*[[Alex Trebek]] Came Back Too Soon. Starting with a premise such as that Alex Trebek is losing it, or just [[Alex Trebek#2007 heart attack|suffered a heart attack]] and came back to work too soon, an edited piece of ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' is shown where the question does not match the answer and Alex says "correct", such as "The J in J.D. stands for this kind of doctor", the contestant says "What are [[Jujube (confectionery)|jujubes]]?", and Alex says "correct." It began with Ken Jennings' long winning streak on the show being lampooned in the same manner after the rule of a Jeopardy player's winning streak being capped at 5 episodes was abolished.
* "Ape Or Artist?" A game in which an abstract painting is shown to Letterman and Shaffer, who then discuss whether it was an ape or an artist who painted it. After the first couple of instances, Letterman based his guesses more on psychology than the painting itself (saying things along the lines of "They ''want'' me to think it's an artist this time, so I'm going with ape"). After a while, the game became "Ape or Artist or Elephant?"
* "Ask ..." Dave says that a celebrity, such as Hillary Clinton or Paris Hilton, will appear to answer questions the audience has submitted in advance. However, it is always Gerard Mulligan. There is usually one question about the celebrity being egotistical, which Mulligan does not initially answer, and then says to Dave, "Oh, sorry. I thought that one was for you."
* "[[Bruce Willis]]'s Mystery Word." Bruce Willis says a random word from a pre-recorded video.
* "Can A ... Hail A Cab?" Usually someone in an animal (Can a Guy in a Turkey Suit ...") or superhero ("Can [[Spider-Man]]...") suit stands on Broadway and hails a cab, seeing if a taxi driver will stop and give the person a ride. This has also been tried by a person wearing a surgical mask portraying the [[2007 tuberculosis scare|traveler with drug resistant tuberculosis]].
* ... Cards. Before [[Valentine's Day]] or [[Mother's Day]], Dave displays a series of mock greeting cards, with messages such as "I'm sorry I called you a dirty whore on ''[[Maury (TV series)|Maury]]''."
* CBS News Special Report. The news bulletin slide appears, but there is no bulletin.
* Chris and Gerry. Dave introduces former writers Chris Elliot and Gerry Mulligan, who are there to promote their latest television program, which end up being parodies of existing shows (e.g., "Skink the Bounty Hunter"). Often they explain that the development of their new shows are due to the failure of their previous efforts. After the interview, a short clip of the contrived show is played. The interview segments usually involve the two wearing the outlandish costumes they don in the clip. Another recent version consists of clips from ''[[John Adams (miniseries)|John Adams]]'' on [[HBO]], where Elliot plays President Adams, and Mulligan plays a portrait artist or some other part. In one of these, Adams and companion did a Mac vs. PC commercial.
:Chris and Gerry also appear in "Late Show Tips for Green Living with Chris and Gerry." In addition to the recorded spots, showing the unexpected effects of carpooling or turning out the lights, they were together on stage in a sketch in which Gerry implied that Chris would taste organic and conventional produce, but instead tasted organically fertilized and chemically treated soil.
* Coach's Corner. Debuting in 2008 to 2011, the sketch features Art Kelly, a receptionist at the Letterman studio, who imitates former [[San Francisco 49ers]] coach [[Mike Singletary]]. When asked by Letterman about football related topics, Kelly as Singletary would sometimes give a delayed or an answer not relating to the question also talking in football jargon which makes no sense. Sometimes he is repeating responses from someone off screen. He always has called Dave by the name of "Jim". Kelly is usually dressed in 49ers clothing with a red shirt and hat and glasses like the real Mike Singletary. He sometimes would appear with a headset on. When asked about his schedule he either has no idea who his team is playing, or who he is coaching as once he referenced coaching in Tampa during a supposed week off, or playing against defunct teams such as the [[Birmingham Stallions]] of the then [[United States Football League]] which Dave reminds him that it has been defunct since 1987. The segment returned for one last time on November 4, 2011 when Singletary was with the [[Minnesota Vikings]].
* Cool or Not Cool. Debuting in June 2008, this is a sketch designed to juxtapose presidential candidate [[Barack Obama]] with President [[George W. Bush]]. First, a clip of Obama engaging in an activity is shown, followed by an on screen graphic reading "COOL" and the sound of a bell. That is immediately followed by a clip of Bush engaging unsuccessfully in a similar activity, and then a graphic reading "NOT COOL" with the sound of a buzzer.
* Crystal Clear Party Ice - In 2000, Kalter presented a running gag in which he promoted this fake sponsor of the show. The lengthy pitch was recited daily with little variation: "Campaign 2000 has been brought to you by Crystal Clear Party Ice. It's not a party without Party Ice, and it's not Crystal Clear Party Ice unless it's crystal clear, the way party ice is supposed to be! Have you been to a party where the ice was cloudy? How did that make you feel? (Letterman would respond, 'Like a loser.') Like a loooooooseeer! Crystal Clear Party Ice is really, REALLY clear! AAAAND, it comes in a bag! Crystal Clear Party Ice is available in 'Crystal Clear,' 'Semi-Clear,' and the all new 'Opaque.' Visit our website at: 'www.CrystalClearPartyIce.com,' and find out how you can win a million dollars worth of Crystal Clear Party Ice for your next party, wedding or get together! Aaaaah, Party Ice!" He would sometimes add, "The weekend is right around the corner, so why not pick up a 'couple' of bags of Crystal Clear Party Ice? You'll be glad you did!" As the bit wore on, Letterman would respond to Kalter's pitch, such as pointing out that the weekend was still several days away.
* "Get To Know [[Delaware]]." In recognition of [[Joe Biden]] being selected as the Democratic Vice Presidential nominee, this series promoted tourist attractions such as [[Independence Hall (United States)|Independence Hall]] and the [[Franklin Institute]] in [[Pennsylvania]], which is next to Delaware, or, in another installment, the announcer described the Battle of New Castle, and then admitted that he made it up because he knows nothing about Delaware.
* Hose cam. On a hot day, a hose shoots water on pedestrians near the Ed Sullivan Theater. Inside, Dave uses a toggle switch to turn the water on and off, and a microphone (similar to one used with a taxicab radio) to make comments to the people on the street.
* "Immigration Success Stories." A segment running since immigration reform was brought to the [[United States Congress]] in 2006.  The segment profiles various well-known immigrants, before switching to archival footage of actor and [[Governor of California]] [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] shown doing suggestive things with females.
* Jeter's place. [[Derek Jeter]]'s mansion, which, according to the staff, is horrendous, is shown repetitively when Letterman calls for a picture to be seen. The staff says the viewers can call or email them if they want to get rid of Jeter's mansion, but the audience loves it (the repetition and the nature of the "error").
* Joe Grossman: Sometimes based on the premise that it is difficult to write jokes about President [[Barack Obama]], ''Late Show'' writer Joe Grossman appears on stage to read his proposed material (usually substituting Obama's name for references to George Bush or [[Al Gore]]) from a note pad.
* Joe McCain Call. Following the incident when [[Joe McCain#2008 presidential election|Joe McCain ended a 911 call with an expletive]], Dave receives a call from McCain, usually saying something irrelevant followed by "Bleep you." The setup by Barbara Gaines is essentially the same as for a Lt. Len Easton call. While a guest, Regis Philbin was told to answer a call on Dave's cell phone, which was from "McCain." Similar calls have also been received from "[[Christian Bale]]" after his tirade.
* "Johnny Twain Tonight." [[Johnny Dark]] dressed as [[Mark Twain]] sits in a [[rocking chair]] and recites [[Rodney Dangerfield]] jokes. Dark has also appeared in a similar segment called "Johnny Lincoln Tonight", with the only modification being Dark dressed as [[Abraham Lincoln]].
* Lance Armstrong. An overweight man pretending to be a prominent athlete of the day, usually [[Lance Armstrong]], but also (among other examples) a recently victorious [[NASCAR]] driver, golfer, or jockey, but always dressed in Armstrong's yellow [[Discovery Channel Pro Cycling Team|Discovery Team]] jersey.  He is introduced with, "Ladies and gentleman, ''name of athlete''" while riding a bicycle through the aisles of the theatre and exiting through a door in the back.  This segment is always accompanied by the CBS Orchestra playing the [[Ike and Tina Turner]] version of "[[Proud Mary]]".  On the August 21, 2006 show, the segment was mixed up even further, with an introduction of golfer [[Tiger Woods]], and a caption of cyclist [[Floyd Landis]]. (This sketch had its roots in a 1994 sketch, when [[Johnny Carson]] was introduced to the crowd and [[Calvert DeForest]] came out instead. After DeForest left, Letterman summoned to "Johnny" that he had the wrong [[Late Show Top Ten List|Top Ten List]], and the real Johnny Carson came out, with the list in his hand.)
* "Let's Talk About the Candidates." A faux audience participation bit where Letterman initially chats with actual audience members about the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential campaign]]. After Letterman comments on a recent candidate's departure from the race, a plant in the audience, always played by the same show staffer, reacts with disbelief and outrage. He then storms out of the theater and pummels pages along the way. In one segment, the plant reacts in this manner to the news that [[John Edwards]] was ending his campaign. Afterwards, the first audience member, himself a staffer, reacts in the same violent manner upon learning that [[Rudy Giuliani]] was also dropping out, and beats the same pages as he leaves. Letterman often closes the segment by lamenting that they no longer have any time due to the outbursts. This series of sketches culminated with "Let's Talk About the Election" on November 5, 2008, where the mock assault occurred after the plant complained that he was duped by a flier that Democrats vote on Wednesday.
** For the [[United States presidential election, 2012]], "Get to know the candidates" in which faux facts about the [[Republican Party presidential candidates, 2012]] are shown; (and, the even more obscure "Get to know the guy behind the Get to know the Candidates" in which a video editor declares personal despair after giving "10 hours a day" to the effort of watching the Republican candidate tapes.)
* Live Crash Footage. Letterman will point to his ear, as if taking instructions from the director, and announce that he is being told that they have "live" footage of various celebrities and public figures driving to a particular destination, and ultimately crashing (actually [[stock footage|stock news footage]] of actual, spectacular crashes). Subjects have included [[Patrick J. Kennedy]], [[Billy Joel]], [[Nicole Richie]], and [[National Football League|NFL]] [[quarterback]] [[Ben Roethlisberger]] (on a [[motorcycle]]). Letterman will then assure the audiences that he is being told that the celebrity is "all right."
* Lt. Len Easton. [[Barbara Gaines (television producer)|Barbara Gaines]] asks Letterman to pick up his phone, on which he gets a radio call from a fictitious Lt. Len Easton (voiced by [[Jeff Altman]]) of the [[California Highway Patrol]] driving on a California freeway on police business, requesting backup. The majority of these calls begin by sounding seemingly normal but will end with an absurd, humorous statement or request. In recent sketches, Letterman says that he is not the only one who is getting Easton's calls, and then shows a clip from a popular [[Talk show|call-in show]] showing its host, such as [[Larry King]], [[Suze Orman]], or [[Mike and the Mad Dog]], receiving a call with the audio of Easton being overdubbed, and occasionally a caption such as "Len from California" superimposed.
* Lyle the Intern. A supposed ''Late Show'' intern (played by actor [[Jimmi Simpson]]) who appears out of nowhere to interrupt a befuddled Letterman for a casual chat. He is portrayed as a smooth, laid-back [[slacker]]-type who often uses [[hipster (contemporary subculture)|hipster]] slang and fancies himself a ladies man. In his first appearance, he encouraged Letterman to act as his "wingman" at a bar after the show.  On his February 17, 2009 appearance, several stations on the [[eastern time zone]] shut off their [[analog signal]]s at 11:59pm in accordance with the original [[Digital Television]] transition date, including [[WDEF-TV]] in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je0YRBKQRmY WDEF-TV Final Analog Signoff]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[WWNY]] in [[Watertown, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPUE0ksC87Q WWNY Analog Sign-Off: Feb 17, 2009 ]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this, the last words that ever aired on these stations were Lyle saying "I know where you live, be-''yooooooooo''tch!" before the signal cuts out for good.
* Mac vs. PC. A parody of [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[Get a Mac]] series of commercials, with former writers [[Chris Elliott]] and Gerard Mulligan portraying the roles of Mac and PC, respectively. The bits often end with Mulligan inflicting bodily harm on Elliott.
* The Man on Fire. A stuntman wildly runs across the stage back and forth while screaming with his clothes on fire before being extinguished backstage. A variation of this was performed in which the man was not on fire but acted as if he were.
* "Millionaire or Kenny?" A man is shown while Dave and Paul debate whether the man is a millionaire or a man named Kenny.
* News Bulletin. Suddenly, an old [[ABC Radio News]] theme is played, Dave confusedly looks through his papers, and then tells Barbara Gaines that he thought he had to read a bulletin.
* Portrait of Biff Henderson. Various artists create a [[portrait]], using [[ketchup]], [[Lego]]s,  [[post-it note]]s, and other "[[Media (arts)|art media]]."
* "[[Psychic]] Sandwich." In the Hello Deli, Deborah Lynn - a self-described "intuitive" - attempts to guess the sandwich being made by Jee, which are all named after various ''Late Show'' staffers. Lynn, who is blindfolded, had never successfully named a sandwich. In 2005, a variation of the game involving [[chocolate]]s was played, in which Lynn picked up a piece at random before guessing its content. On her second try, Lynn successfully guessed "[[nougat]]." On another episode later that year, a variation was played involving Jee's [[Slurpee]]-like drinks, and Lynn correctly guessed "cherry" on her first try. In these segments, Lynn is often asked by Letterman to explain the difference between a psychic and intuitive.  On a recent episode, Lynn was asked to guess the price of a gallon of gas that Rupert provided her in a gasoline can.  She guessed $4.40, however the gas was actually $4.30.  Dave made note of the fact that Lynn admitted she had heard something on the news that morning about gas prices in New York by saying she had integrity in disclosing that information up front.
* Putting Away the Late Show [[Bear]]. A man in a bear suit is pushed and locked into a closet. The last time this sketch was played, a young intern lost control of the bear and it went on a rampage before finally calling for a taxi.
* Quarterback Challenge. Letterman challenges an NFL quarterback on the show to throw as many footballs at some target, such as into the open back window of a moving cab, as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Bouchette, Ed. [http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/04329/416604.stm "Ben to Letterman: Goal is to match Brady's feat,"] ''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'' (November 24, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; A version of this challenge gave rise to the annual throwing of the football at the ornament at the top of the [[Christmas tree]], when [[Vinny Testaverde]] could not hit the target, but [[Jay Thomas]] did. In recent years, the ornament has been replaced by a meatball.
* "[[Telemundo]] Highlight of the Night." Usually a short clip from a Telemundo show, such as ''[[Laura Bozzo|Laura en América]]'',[http://www.cbs.com/latenight/lateshow/wahoo/index/php/20050516.phtml] showing something similar to a [[Jerry Springer Show]] fight, but, of course, in Spanish. A similar concept is "Spanish Television is Better."
* This Day In The Clinton Marriage: While Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] is out of the country on a diplomatic mission, this clip purportedly shows what [[Bill Clinton]] is doing, implying partying and possibly marital [[infidelity]].
* "[[Donald Trump|Trump]] or [[Monkey]]?" Played in the Hello Deli, the game involves a contestant being presented by Jee with two photos of monkeys, and a photo of celebrity businessman Donald Trump. Only the tops of the heads are visible, with the rest covered by a card. The contestant then attempts to guess which of the photos is Trump's. Around the release of the film ''[[Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith]]'' in 2005, a variation of the game called "Trump or [[Wookiee]]?" was played.
* "What the Hell is it?" In the style of "Is this Anything" and "Will it Float", this game had Letterman guess the name of a mystery object. The game was played only a handful of times. A running gag was that when Alan Kalter would announce the object's name to the audience, Letterman would unintentionally hear it clearly, thus leading to greater and greater amounts of [[soundproofing]] each time the game was played.
* "What's the Deal with Old Guys and Giant Glasses?" Letterman simply presents a series of photographs of celebrity men (and occasionally, women). The photos are often dated with the subjects sporting large, old-fashioned style glasses.
* "Who Asked for It?" A staple of late-night television, audience members approach a microphone and ask a question, resulting in a prearranged sketch in response (such as a person asking if [[Regis Philbin]] will run into the theater, and a staffer does instead).
* "Women in Prison." Dave offers to conduct a remote interview of [[Martha Stewart]] or [[Paris Hilton]] in jail, but the show then runs [[stock footage]] of women in prison having a [[food fight]] or [[riot]]ing.
* [[Writers Guild of America strike (2007–present)|Writers' Guild Strike]]. Some other routine (usually a fake promotional announcement) is interrupted by Head Writer Bill Scheft, who announces that the Writers Guild is currently in negotiations for a new contract, and at this time we have chosen not to reveal the punchline to this hilarious joke until the big media companies show they're ready to play fair with the writers. The routine continued after Worldwide Pants settled with the WGA and the ''Late Show'' returned, to show solidarity with the other writers still on strike, and Scheft has interrupted other routines, such as one dealing with [[Hillary Clinton]]'s pantsuit, to protest having to write those jokes after she should have left the race.
* Biff Henderson's "Fun with a [[Bullhorn]]"
* Biff Henderson's "Fun with a [[Stopwatch]]"
* Biff Henderson's "Wanna Hang Out?"
* "Celebrity [[X-Ray]] Challenge"
* "Dave's [[Phonograph record|Record]] Collection"
* [[Dick Assman]], who made several appearances in 1995
* "[[Phil McGraw|Dr. Phil]]'s Words of Wisdom." Out-of-context clips from the ''[[Dr. Phil (TV series)|Dr. Phil Show]]''. This bit was similar to the "Great Moments in Presidential Speeches" sketch.
* "Dumb Ads"
* "George W. Bush Joke That's Not Really a Joke"
* Harold Larkin's "Sidewalk [[American Idol|Idol]]"
* "Late Show Checklist"
* "Late Show Pay Phone Trifecta"
* "Late Show Unfair Edit", later "Late Show Fun with Editing", later "Late Show Editing Fun"
* "May We See Your Photos Please?"/"May We See Your Digital Photos Please?"
* Pat Farmer's "Gaffe-Busters"
* Pat Farmer's "Long Story Short"
* Pat Farmer's "Anything Can Be a Musical Instrument"
* Paul Shaffer's [[James Brown (musician)|James Brown]] cape routine (with various celebrities, including James Brown himself on one occasion, caping Shaffer)
* "Pedestrian [[Theme Song]]s" - A sketch in which various clips of pedestrians walking around New York City were accompanied by a humorous short song clip performed by The CBS Orchestra.
* "Week in Review" (used to be a regular Friday feature, using a variation of the "[[Rowan &amp; Martin's Laugh-In|Laugh-In Looks at the News"]] theme).
* "Who Said It?"
* "Dave interviews coach Mike Singletary"

'''''Little Iodine''''' was an American [[Sunday strip|Sunday comic strip]], created by [[Jimmy Hatlo]], which was syndicated by [[King Features Syndicate|King Features]] and ran 1943 until 1985. The strip was a spin-off of ''[[They'll Do It Every Time]]'', an earlier Hatlo creation.

== Publication history ==
From 1943 to 1963, ''Little Iodine'' was written and drawn by Hatlo, who said, "I tried to make her the embodiment of all the brats I knew... I tried to make her naughty as hell&amp;mdash;and still likable."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=m5G4yNh2B-AC&amp;pg=PA61&amp;lpg=PA61&amp;dq=%22little+iodine%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=9BWgss-jj6&amp;sig=p-Hcmk-ogTeC2ZcOYiFZcTXjZzs&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mT-VScj1Hce_tgeXhKCgCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=89&amp;ct=result Reynolds, Moira Davidson. ''Comic Strips in American Newspapers, 1945-1980''. McFarland, 2003.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Al Scaduto]] also contributed to the strip in 1966, with [[Hy Eisman]] and [[Bob Dunn (cartoonist)|Bob Dunn]] taking the strip from 1967 through its end in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cartoonician.com/getting-hy-on-comics-a-profile-of-hy-eisman/ ''A Profile of Hy Eisman'', Hogan's Alley #15]&lt;/ref&gt; Iodine also appeared in a series of 56 [[Dell Comics]] between 1949 and 1962.

==Characters and story==
First seen during the 1930s in a supporting role in Hatlo's popular gag panel, ''They'll Do It Every Time'', Little Iodine was the daughter of Henry Tremblechin and his wife, Cora. Her purpose was to serve as a pesky nuisance to the strip's star, Henry, and her behavior caused endless misery for her mild-mannered, easily unsettled father.

However, Iodine proved to be popular in her own right, stealing the strip from her parents, so Hatlo promoted the character into her own strip in 1943. Iodine's antics gave the [[Sunday comics]] page a female precursor to [[Hank Ketcham]]'s ''[[Dennis the Menace (U.S.)|Dennis the Menace]]''.

==Film adaptation==
{{Main|Little Iodine (film)}}
In 1946, Comet Productions, a company established by [[Mary Pickford]], her husband, [[Charles Rogers (actor)|Charles Rogers]] and [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]] executive Ralph Cohn, produced a 56-minute feature film, ''Little Iodine'', starring [[Hobart Cavanaugh]] as Henry, [[Irene Ryan]] as Cora and Jo Ann Marlowe as Little Iodine. The film was directed by [[Reginald Le Borg]].

In the movie, Iodine thinks that her mother is having an affair with Professor Simkins (Leon Belasco). Consequently, she tries one antic after another to break up the adulterous couple. Her efforts backfire when they cause conflict between Henry and his employer, Mr. Bigdome ([[Emory Parnell]]). 
[[File:Littleiodinehatlo.jpg|right|thumb|500px|[[Jimmy Hatlo]]'s ''Little Iodine'' (November 7, 1948)]]
The film was scheduled for release earlier than October 20, 1946 (its actual distribution date), but that date was postponed due to an epidemic of polio that prevented children across the United States from attending films. The film is currently believed to be [[lost films|lost]].&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0038695|Little Iodine (1946)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Adventures of Luntik and his friends (Приключения Лунтика и его друзей) (or Moonzy)''''' or simply '''''Luntik (Лунтик)''''' is a Russian [[animated series]] for children.

The title character is a purple furry alien named Luntik. In the first episode Luntik is shown hatching from an egg on the moon and then falling to Earth. All of the following series take place at a forest glade near a pond where Luntik finds a new home. Early on in the series, Luntik is adopted by two anthropomorphic bees that become his grandfather and grandmother. Like the bees, the majority of the characters are small anthropomorphic animals such as insects, fish, frogs, and turtles, playing the roles of adults and children. The main characters learn about the world through new experiences and interactions with one another. The series provides a positive message; even the negative characters, such as the two trouble-making caterpillars and the angry leech are shown as also having positive qualities. The series runs in a format of 6-minute episodes, each unfolding as a separate, self-contained story.

In [[Russia]], the show premiered on the TV channel [[Russia-1]] and was broadcast for 8 years from 1 September 2006 until 15 May 2014. On 16 June 2014, it moved to the  channel [[Russia-K]]. It is also broadcast on [[Carousel (TV channel)|Carousel]] as of 24 March 2008, on Mult as of 1 June 2014-present.

In [[Ukraine]] the show airs on channels [[TET (TV channel)|TET]] (2011—2016) (Russian original and without subtitles) and [[Novyi Kanal]] (2017—) (with Ukrainian dubbing).

'''Marshall Pinckney Wilder''' (September 19, 1859 – January 10, 1915) was an American actor, [[monologist]], humorist and sketch artist.

==Early life==

Marshall Pinckney Wilder (sometimes spelled Marshal) was born along the north shore of [[Seneca Lake (New York)|Seneca Lake]] at [[Geneva, New York]],&lt;ref name="SyracuseHerald_1-11-1915"&gt;The Syracuse Herald January 11, 1915, pg. 7&lt;/ref&gt; the son of Dr. Louis de Valois Wilder and the former Mary A. Bostwick. He shared the same name as his great-uncle, a distinguished amateur [[pomologist]] and [[floriculturist]] who helped found the [[Massachusetts Horticultural Society|Boston Horticultural Society]] and [[American Pomological Society]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;The New York Times February 17, 1933 pg. 19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;History of Horticulture - Wilder, Marshall Pinckney 1798-1886 (Ohio State University)&lt;/ref&gt; His father was an 1843 graduate of the [[Geneva Medical College]] and for a number of years an attending physician at Flower Hospital at the [[New York Medical College]] and a member of the New York [[Homeopathic]] Medical Society.&lt;ref&gt;Medical record, Volume 79  edited by George Frederick Shrady, Thomas Lathrop Stedman – 1911 pg. 309&lt;/ref&gt;

While still a boy, Wilder's family moved to [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]] where he became popular for his talent as a [[Storytelling|storyteller]] and apparent gift as a [[clairvoyant]]. It was also at Rochester that Wilder received his early inspiration for a later vocation after attending a public reading at Corinthian Hall. In his youth he worked as a pin-boy at a [[bowling alley]] and storeroom clerk for a summer resort,&lt;ref name="AppletonPost_1-23-1923"&gt;Appleton Post Crescent  January 23, 1923 pg. 4&lt;/ref&gt; before moving to New York City  around the age of twenty where found employment as a file boy with a commercial firm. Wilder starting augmenting his income by giving humorous monologues for 50 cents a performance.&lt;ref name="SyracuseHerald_1-11-1915"/&gt;

==Career==

These early performances held in the [[drawing rooms]] of wealthy New Yorkers gained him the notoriety to soon join the ranks of full-time entertainers.&lt;ref name="AppletonPost_1-23-1923"/&gt;  In 1883 Wilder traveled to [[London, England|London]] where he became a favorite of the [[British Royal Family]].  While still the [[Prince of Wales]], [[King Edward VII]] became an admirer of Wilder and over the years would attend nearly twenty of his performances. Wilder's career eventually branched into [[vaudeville]] and in 1904 embarked on a [[round the world]] tour.&lt;ref&gt;The Bookseller, Newsdealer and Stationer, Volume 42 – 1915- pg. 77&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Who's Who on the Stage edited by Walter Browne, Frederick Arnold Austin 1908 pg 455 -&lt;/ref&gt;

In describing his monologues the ''[[Syracuse Herald]]'' wrote in a 1907 article: "His pathos, his humor, his indescribable droll and uplifting optimism keeps bubbling forth all through the evening".&lt;ref&gt;Syracuse Herald February 17, 1907 pg. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilder, who always signed his correspondence "Merrily yours", authored three books over his career: ''The People I've Smiled With'' (1899),&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_Us49AAAAYAAJ ''The People I’ve Smiled With'' at archive.org]&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Sunnyside of the Street'' (1905), and ''Smiling Around the World'' (1908); and edited a number of volumes of ''The Wit and Humor of America'' and ''The Ten Books of the Merrymakers''. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' wrote in 1915 of his coping with physical disabilities ([[dwarfism]] and [[kyphosis]]), "Wilder coaxed the frown of adverse fortune into a smile."&lt;ref&gt;January 15, 1915 pg. 3 (News Notes of the Stage)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OaklandTribune_2-6-1915"&gt;The Oakland Tribune February 6, 1915 pg. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Though nearly forgotten today, Wilder was heralded in his lifetime and did not let his dwarfism be an excuse for cheap entertainment. Wilder shunned offers by showmen like [[P.T. Barnum]] to instead become an established [[legitimate stage]] actor and [[sketch artist]]. He made his earliest [[motion picture]] appearance in 1897, for which he received $600,&lt;ref&gt;The Moving Picture World, Volume 27 By Moving Picture Exhibitors' Association 1916 pg. 1136&lt;/ref&gt;  and his last in 1913. Wilder also left recordings of his routines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsq-sds.org/article/view/1271/1294 ''Marshall P. Wilder and Disability Performance History'' by Susan Schweik, University of California/Berkeley c.2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of each performance Wilder was known to seek out everyone involved in the show to shake their hand always with a generous tip in his palm. Wilder was until his final curtain call a headliner earning a five-figure annual income. At one point in his career Wilder was willing to take a cut in pay in order to play a vaudeville circuit he felt catered to an audience that better appreciated his humor. This did not happen, however, because of booking issues.&lt;ref&gt;The Lyceum magazine, Volume 29  edited by Ralph Albert Parlette  1919 pg. 44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Kings of Jesters by Elbert Hubbard - The Fra: for Philistines and Roycrofters, Volume 14  edited by Elbert Hubbard, Felix Shay 1914 pg. viii&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MarshallPinckneyWilder01.jpg|center|thumb|600px|'''Marshall P. Wilder "The Ten Books of the Merrymakers, Volume 1"''' ('''1909''')]]

==Marriage==

In 1903 Marshall Wilder married Sophie Cornell Hanks, the daughter of a New Jersey dentist. Sophie was a writer and [[dramatist]] who collaborated with Wilder on his books. Their daughter Grace was born in 1905 around the time the couple returned from the world tour. Marshall Jr. followed a year or so later. On December 20, 1913, Sophie died at the age of 35 in New York City after a brief illness and failed operation.&lt;ref name="AppletonPost_1-23-1923"/&gt; She was in the city to give dramatic readings of her new book, ''The Golden Lotus''.&lt;ref&gt;The Hartford Courant December 22, 1913&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==

Following the loss of his wife, Wilder's health began to decline and a little over a year later fell ill while in St. Paul, Minnesota, for an engagement. His death there on January 10, 1915, was attributed to [[heart disease]] complicated by [[pneumonia]].&lt;ref name="SyracuseHerald_1-11-1915"/&gt;  The funeral service was held a few days later at the Stephen Merritt Mortuary Chapel in New York.&lt;ref&gt;The New York Times January 12, 1915&lt;/ref&gt; The writer and artist Elbert Hubbard wrote an obituary for Wilder which declared Wilder "picked up the lemons that Fate had sent him and started a lemonade-stand."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/food-and-drink/when-life-gives-you-lemons-delicious-aphorisms-and-their-interesting-origins-1.2513761&lt;/ref&gt; Marshal Wilder was survived by his children, who shared the bulk of his quarter-million-dollar estate,&lt;ref name="OaklandTribune_2-6-1915"/&gt; and a sister, Jennie Cornelia Wilder, who also had some success as an entertainer of diminutive stature.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

During the [[Great Depression]] Grace Wilder served as director of the [[Puppets]] and [[Marionettes]] department of the [[Public Works Administration]] (PWA) Drama Division.&lt;ref&gt;The New York Times June 21, 1934 pg. 25&lt;/ref&gt; She would later serve in a similar capacity as a [[social worker]] in New York City &lt;ref&gt;The New York Times October 11, 1944 pg.18&lt;/ref&gt; and with community puppet theaters in [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;Oakland Tribune June 19, 1949 pg. 58&lt;/ref&gt; According to one of his obituaries, [[puppetry]] was a childhood interest of her father's who would entertain his neighbors with [[Punch and Judy]] shows charging two cents admission or a nickel for reserved seating.&lt;ref&gt;The Newark Advocate  January 16, 1915 pg. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Marshall P. Wilder Jr. (1913–1964) became a pioneer in the development of [[television]] when in 1931 he participated in the first successful transmission of a signal to a ship stationed some 50 miles offshore.&lt;ref&gt;The New York Times September 9, 1931 pg. 55 – pg. 25&lt;/ref&gt; And later during [[World War II]] was one of the technicians who helped develop what today are called [[smart bombs]] by engineering a [[television camera]] small enough to fit into the [[nosecone]] of a [[bomb]] or [[unmanned aircraft]] that could be directed by [[remote control]].&lt;ref&gt;The Harford Courant October 28, 1945&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Mavlin: Vesmírný únik''''' is a 1994 adventure game developed and published by Mael Software Group as its debut title. The game was one of the first Czech point-and-click adventures.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;https://dspace.cuni.cz/bitstream/handle/20.500.11956/52702/DPTX_2010_2_11230_0_322985_0_111952.pdf?sequence=1&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Development ==
Mael Software Group was formed in 1994 in [[Děčín]] by Petr Mandík.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The game was worked on by Petr Mandík, who programmed on a black-and-white PC, and Tomáš Jerie, who created the graphics once it was already programmed on the [[Commodore Amiga 500]] computer.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The game engine is similar to [[Sierra Entertainment]]'s ''[[Leisure Suit Larry 5: Passionate Patti Does a Little Undercover Work|Leisure Suit Larry 5]]'', which Mandík had played in the summer of 1994.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After finishing that title, he tried to program a similar one, which took about four weeks.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The following four weeks after that saw the game's narrative and graphics come into being.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The duo playtested the game together in their house and decided that it was fun; they chose to distribute it to players after the holidays, which they did by copying the game to floppy disks and offering it to retail stores.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Plot and gameplay ==
The player takes control of Earthling Mavlin Malner who is kidnapped by aliens in a flying saucer to the planet of Moguns, and must make his way back home again.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.databaze-her.cz/hry/mavlin-vesmirny-unik/|title=Mavlin: Vesmírný únik – Databáze-her.cz|website=www.databaze-her.cz|language=cs|access-date=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game has fail-states; it is possible for the main character to die.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The gameplay takes the form of a point and click sci-fi adventure, whereby players control Mavlin via six graphically presented commands. The game contains an inventory, however items may only be interacted with hotspots on the screen, and can't be combined.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Critical reception ==
Unlike other contemporary Czech games such as ''[[Tajemství Oslího ostrova]]'' (1994) and ''[[7 dní a 7 nocí]]'' (1994), ''Mavlin: Vesmírný únik'' received a negative reception. For instance, ''Excalibur'' magazine only gave the game a rating of 18%, particularly criticising the music and graphic design.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Computer Experts likened the title to ''[[Stíny noci]]''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''''Me and Bessie''''' is a [[musical revue]] about the life and career of [[blues]] singer [[Bessie Smith]]. The basically one-woman show, conceived and written by [[Will Holt]] and [[Linda Hopkins]] and performed by Hopkins, features songs by [[Lil Green]], [[Clarence Williams (musician)|Clarence Williams]], [[Henry Creamer]], [[Andy Razaf]], and [[Jimmy Cox]], among others. 

It originally was presented at [[Ford's Theatre]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] from November 1-17, 1974, &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.inthefirstperson.com/atho/atho.detail.productions.aspx?productioncode=PR004117 North American Theatre Online]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; then produced by the [[Center Theatre Group]] and staged by [[Robert Greenwald]] at the [[Mark Taper Forum]] from April 4 through May 3, 1975. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centertheatregroup.org/_pdf/MTF_Production_History.doc Mark Taper Forum production history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214043702/http://www.centertheatregroup.org/_pdf/MTF_Production_History.doc |date=2007-12-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production was directed by Greenwald, with special dance sequences choreographed by [[Lester Wilson]] for two characters, identified only as Man and Woman (Lester Wilson and Gerri Dean). Howlett Smith and [[Lenny Hambro]] were co-Musical Directors.&lt;ref&gt;Ida Peters. The Afro-American. 22 Jun. 1976&lt;/ref&gt; Donald Harris was responsible for scenic design.

Following two previews, it opened at the [[Ambassador Theatre (New York)|Ambassador Theatre]] on October 22, 1975. It transferred to the [[Edison Theatre]] on December 3, 1975 and remained there until December 5, 1976, running for a total of 453 performances. Between September 24 and its closing, it ran in [[repertory]] with ''[[Oh! Calcutta!]]''

''In and Around Town'', a weekly critical guide for entertainment in ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'', included a capsule review for ''Me and Bessie'' that read, "The raw fervor of Linda Hopkins's blues singing is all that matters here, and it's enough. Unfortunately, the show is also burdened with a silly script by Will Holt, which consists mostly of having Miss Hopkins disavow the fact that she's Bessie Smith with all the fervor of a Kennedy disavowing politics." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = New York Media, LLC| title = New York Magazine| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=buMCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA20| date = 1976-11-15| publisher = New York Media, LLC| page = 20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2011, Backstage magazine remembered Hopkin's performance as Smith: "It's been 36 years since I saw her in it at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles, but she's stayed with me as the definitive Bessie Smith, and of course the cast album plays even more powerfully than Smith's original." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=robert windeler|url=http://www.backstage.com/review/ny-theater/off-broadway/the-devils-music-the-life-and-blues-of-bessie-smith/|title=The Life and Blues of Bessie Smith|publisher=Backstage|date=22 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linda Hopkins was nominated for the [[Drama Desk Award for Unique Theatrical Experience]] but lost to ''[[The Norman Conquests]]''. &lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20080704130530/http://www.dramadesk.com/1975_1976dd.html Drama Desk Awards archives]&lt;/ref&gt; The production held the record for the longest-running one-woman show in Broadway history until ''[[Golda's Balcony]]'', starring [[Tovah Feldshuh]], surpassed it by forty performances. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=13535 ''Golda's Balcony'' at the Internet Broadway Database]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Culture of Canada}}
'''[[Canada]]''' has a well-developed '''[[Mass media|media]] sector''', but its cultural output{{snd}} particularly in [[English language|English]] films, television shows, and magazines{{snd}} is often overshadowed by imports from the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="Brake1990"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mike Brake|title=Comparative Youth Culture: The Sociology of Youth Cultures and Youth Subcultures in America, Britain, and Canada|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vcv2-Gc7nWYC&amp;pg=PA160|date=December 31, 1990|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-05108-8|page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; Television, magazines, and newspapers are primarily for-profit corporations based on [[advertising]], [[subscription]], and other sales-related revenues. Nevertheless, both the television broadcasting and publications sectors require a number of government interventions to remain profitable, ranging from regulation that bars foreign companies in the broadcasting industry to tax laws that limit foreign competition in magazine advertising.&lt;ref name="GlobermanPolicy1983"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Steven Globerman|author2=Institute for Research on Public Policy|title=Cultural Regulation in Canada|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jlBGJyEdDy4C&amp;pg=PR18|year=1983|publisher=IRPP|isbn=978-0-920380-81-9|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the broadcasting sector, Canada has a government-funded broadcaster, the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]/[[Société Radio-Canada]], which operates radio and TV networks in English and French. As well, some provincial governments offer their own public educational TV broadcast services as well, such as Ontario's [[TVOntario]] and Quebec's [[Télé-Québec]]. Given Canada's small market and its position next to the dominant producer of feature films (the United States), the Canadian film industry receives substantial assistance from the government. In the 2000s, about half of the budget of a typical Canadian film came from various federal and provincial government sources.

The organization [[Reporters Without Borders]] compiles and publishes an annual ranking of countries based upon the organization's assessment of their [[Press Freedom Index|press freedom records]]. In 2011-12 Canada was ranked 10th out of 179 countries, which was an improvement from the preceding year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.rsf.org/spip.php?page=classement&amp;id_rubrique=1043 |title=A Press Freedom Index 2011–2012 |publisher=[[Reporters Without Borders]] |accessdate=July 15, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120131012309/http://en.rsf.org/spip.php?page=classement&amp;id_rubrique=1043 |archivedate=January 31, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Further|Mass Media in Canada}}

The history of Canadian media performers goes back to the first days of radio. In the 1940s, the Radio Artists of Toronto Society (RATS) was formed. Radio performers in [[Montreal]], [[Winnipeg]] and [[Vancouver]] also organized to fight for artists' rights, working conditions and better fees. In 1943, the Association of Canadian Radio Artists (ACRA) was formed as a loose national coalition of actors' groups. Over the years, ACRA evolved to become the [[Association of Canadian Radio and Television Artists]], the Canadian Council of Authors and Artists, the Association of Canadian Television and Radio Artists and, in 1984, the Alliance of Canadian Cinema, Television and Radio Artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.actra.ca/actra/control/insideActra_what?menu_id=902 |title=ACTRA 2005 |publisher=Actra.ca |accessdate=2011-02-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706164704/http://www.actra.ca/actra/control/insideActra_what?menu_id=902 |archivedate=July 6, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian Broadcasting Act, historically and in its modern conception, is based on the fact that since the start of the 20th century, it was important for broadcasters to ensure that information flowed freely and reflected the diversity of Canadian points of view, as opposed to the classic approach, which gives media owners more freedom to express their views. The Canadian broadcasting system as it exists today "would probably not exist if we had allowed the marketplace to regulate ownership rights."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parl.gc.ca/37/2/parlbus/commbus/senate/Com-e/tran-e/10evb-e.htm?Language=E&amp;Parl=37&amp;Ses=2&amp;comm_id=19 Pierre Trudel], Professor, L.R. Wilson Chair, Information Technologies and Electronic Commerce Law, Public Law Research Centre, University of Montreal, May 29, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulation==
The Canadian government regulates [[media ownership in Canada|media ownership]] and the state of media through the [[Canadian Radio and Telecommunications Commission]]. Section 3 of the [[Canadian Broadcasting Act]] states that media organizations should reflect "equal rights, the linguistic duality and multicultural and multiracial nature society and the special place of aboriginal peoples within that society".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canada Broadcast Act|publisher=Government of Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television broadcasting==
{{Main|Television in Canada}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}

The Canadian [[television]] broadcasting industry is split between public and private ownership. Canada currently has 130 originating television stations, which broadcast on 1,456 transmitters across the country, on both the [[VHF]] and [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] bands.

In addition to the public [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]/[[Société Radio-Canada]], which operates both English ([[CBC Television]]) and French ([[Ici Radio-Canada Télé]]) television networks, there are five major private TV networks. [[CTV Television Network|CTV]], [[Global Television Network|Global]], and [[Citytv]] broadcast in English, and are available throughout the country. [[TVA (TV network)|TVA]] and [[V (TV network)|V]] broadcast in French and operate over-the-air in French-language markets (including Quebec and parts of Ontario and New Brunswick), although are also available across Canada via pay television. Ici Radio-Canada Télé, TVA and V function in the particular cultural context of [[Quebec television]]. Most network stations are owned and operated by the networks themselves, although all networks have some affiliates with different ownership.

In addition, the [[Aboriginal Peoples Television Network]], a service devoted mainly to programming of interest to the [[Aboriginal peoples of Canada]], is considered a network by the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]], although the network airs terrestrially only in the three Canadian territories, and must be carried by all television providers in the rest of Canada. There are, as well, a number of smaller [[television system]]s, such as [[CTV Two]] (a compliment to the main CTV network in smaller and secondary markets), and [[Omni Television]]{{snd}} a group of Rogers-owned ethnic broadcasters.

Several provinces maintain provincial public broadcasting networks in addition to the CBC, including [[Télé-Québec]], [[TVOntario]], [[TFO]], and [[Knowledge (TV channel)|Knowledge]] (British Columbia). [[Citytv Saskatchewan]] and [[CTV Two Alberta]] were formerly provincial public broadcasters (SCN and Access), but both have since been privatized and amalgamated into commercial networks operated by their current owners ([[Rogers Communications|Rogers]] and [[Bell Canada|Bell]]). While both outlets devote a portion of their schedules to their networks' respective, advertising-supported entertainment programming, both networks are still required to adhere to an educational remit in the majority of their programming. Unlike in the United States, where a statewide public network is usually the state's primary [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] member station, the provincially owned public systems in Canada are independent of each other and have their own programming.

Only CBC/Radio-Canada, TVA and APTN are officially considered national networks by the CRTC, while V is a provincial network in Quebec. City, CTV and Global are legally considered "television services" even though they operate as networks for all practical purposes. As well, there are a few independent stations, including [[CFTU-TV|CFTU]] in [[Montreal]], [[CJON-TV|CJON]] in [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]] and [[CJIL-TV|CJIL]] in [[Lethbridge]]. However, most of these are not general entertainment stations like independent stations in the United States, but are instead specialty [[community channel (Canada)|community channel]]s or educational services. CJON is the only independent commercial station currently operating in Canada, although CJON sublicenses a mix of programming from Global, CTV and other sources rather than purchasing program rights independently.

TV station [[callsign]]s in Canada are usually made up of four letters, although two stations have three call letters ([[CKX-TV|CKX]] in [[Brandon, Manitoba|Brandon]] and [[CKY-TV|CKY]] in [[Winnipeg]]) and some (primarily CBC-owned Radio-Canada stations) have five. The first call letter is always ''C'', and callsigns of privately owned television stations start with the [[ITU prefix|two-letter combinations]] of ''CF'', ''CH'', ''CI'', ''CJ'', or ''CK''. The combinations ''CG'', ''CY'', ''CZ'' and several combinations beginning with ''V'' and ''X'' are also assigned to Canada, but to date no Canadian television station has ever been licensed to take a call sign within those ranges. There is no clear rule for the call letters of [[rebroadcaster]]s&amp;mdash;some are labelled by the call-letters of the originating station, followed by a number, while others have their own distinct call letters. Low-power repeater transmitters (LPRTs) have their own unique callsign format, which consists of the letters CH followed by four numbers. Some rebroadcast transmitters are licensed as ''semi-satellites'', which are licensed to air separate commercials (and, on rarer occasions, a limited amount of distinct programming) targeted to their community of license.

CBC-owned stations use call letters beginning with the combination ''CB'' (through a special agreement with the government of [[Chile]]); private affiliates of the CBC use the same combinations as other private stations. The CBC has also sometimes directly acquired former private affiliate stations; these usually (although not always) retain their historic call sign rather than changing to a CB call. While Canadian TV stations are technically required to identify themselves over the air by their call letters, the rule is rarely enforced by the CRTC. As a result, most TV stations never use their call letters for any purpose other than official CRTC business, and instead brand under regional names such as [[CTV Northern Ontario]] or [[CFRE-DT|Global Regina]]. Even then, most network-owned stations may only use these brands for station identification and newscasts, and promote the majority of their programming under the network brand without any disambiguation.

Due to their proximity to American media markets, a number of Canadian cities and regions receive US broadcasters as part of their local media. This has required special dispensation for Canadian content for broadcasters in the [[Windsor, Ontario]] region (due to it falling within the [[Detroit]] media footprint), and there has also been a case of a US-based broadcaster ([[KCND-TV]] of [[Pembina, North Dakota]], now [[CKND-DT]] of Winnipeg) targeting its programming and advertising at Canadian viewers.

Although all broadcast networks in Canada are required to produce and air some [[Canadian content]], only the English and French networks of the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] run predominantly Canadian-produced schedules, though, the English network does run some imported programming (such as ''[[Coronation Street]]'' and ''[[Grand Designs]]''). Both [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] and [[Global Television Network|Global]] have at times faced criticism over their level of commitment to producing and airing Canadian programming. Both networks often find it easier to purchase rights to hit American series than to invest in Canadian productions, which are often prohibitively costly for the comparatively small size of the Canadian market. The French-language networks traditionally have had less difficulty meeting their Canadian content obligations, as the language difference makes Francophone audiences much more readily receptive to home-grown programming than to dubbed American imports.

[[Digital television]] is an emerging technology in Canada. Although some TV stations have begun broadcasting digital signals in addition to their regular VHF or UHF broadcasts, this is not yet as widespread as in the [[United States]]. Although most markets have digital channel assignments already in place, to date digital broadcasts have only launched in the largest [[metropolitan area]]s. Digital television sets are available in Canadian stores, but are not widely owned by consumers at this time.

Several broadcasters, including the CBC, have argued that there is no viable business case for a comprehensive digital conversion strategy in Canada. At [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission|CRTC]] hearings in 2007 on the future direction of regulatory policy for television, broadcasters proposed a number of strategies, including funding digital conversion by eliminating restrictions on the amount of advertising that television broadcasters are permitted to air, allowing terrestrial broadcasters to charge cable viewers a subscription fee similar to that already charged by cable [[specialty channels]], permitting [[Television licence|license fees]] similar to those which fund the [[BBC]] in the [[United Kingdom]], or eliminating terrestrial television broadcasting entirely and moving to an exclusively cable-based distribution model.

In May 2007, the CRTC set August 31, 2011 as the deadline for digital conversion in Canada. This is approximately two years later than the cutoff date in the United States. The CRTC ultimately decided to relax restrictions on advertising as the funding mechanism. However, a CRTC statement issued in June 2008 indicated that as of that date, only 22 digital transmitters had been fully installed across the entire country,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080624.wrcable24/BNStory/Technology/home "Networks unprepared for digital TV shift: CRTC"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080628212056/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080624.wrcable24/BNStory/Technology/home/ |date=June 28, 2008 }}, ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', June 24, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and expressed the regulator's concern that Canada's television broadcasters were not adequately preparing for the shift to digital broadcasting.

==Cable television==
{{Main|Multichannel television in Canada}}

[[Cable television]] is a very common method of television programming delivery in Canada. Many Canadian cities have cable penetration rates of 90 per cent or more of television households.

There are currently 739 licensed cable distributors in Canada. This significant decline from over 2000 just a few years ago is attributable both to major cable companies acquiring smaller distributors and to a recent change in CRTC rules by which independent cable operators with fewer than 2,000 subscribers are no longer required to operate under full CRTC licences. (However, the CRTC does retain some regulatory authority over these operators. This is an exemption granted by the CRTC to previously licensed companies that continue to meet certain conditions, and does ''not'' mean that anybody can simply set up their own small cable company without CRTC approval.)

Major Canadian cable companies include [[Rogers Communications|Rogers]], [[Shaw Communications|Shaw]], [[Cogeco]], [[Vidéotron]] and [[EastLink (company)|EastLink]]/[[Persona Communications|Persona]]. Most Canadian cities are served by only one cable company per market; in the few cities that are served by more than one cable company, each company is restricted to a specific geographical division within the market. For instance, in [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], [[Cogeco Cable]], [[Mountain Cablevision]] and [[Source Cable]] are all licensed operators, but each has a monopoly in a specific area of the city.

However, two major companies offer [[direct broadcast satellite]] delivery as an alternative to cable: [[Bell TV]], which is a division of [[Bell Canada|BCE Inc.]], and [[Shaw Direct]], which is a division of Shaw. ''[[Grey market]]'' DBS dishes can also be obtained from American services such as [[DirecTV]] and [[Dish Network]], but as these are not licensed Canadian providers, stores that sell those packages&amp;mdash;and users who buy them&amp;mdash;are at risk of criminal charges.

In some remote communities in the Territories ([[Yukon]], [[Northwest Territories]], [[Nunavut]]), cable delivery is prohibitively costly, so similar services are offered through [[MMDS]] technology.

A ''basic cable'' package in English Canada traditionally includes:

* the major English-language Canadian commercial networks ([[CTV Television Network|CTV]], [[CTV Two]], [[Global Television Network|Global]], [[City (TV network)|City]]),
* [[CBC Television]] and [[Ici Radio-Canada Télé]], the English- and French-language CBC networks
* a provincial educational broadcast undertaking (e.g. [[TVOntario|TVO]] in Ontario) (if one is available, as not all provinces have one),
* a [[Community channel (Canada)|community channel]] produced by the cable company which usually includes public affairs and information programming and community events listings),
* [[Aboriginal Peoples Television Network|APTN]], a network devoted to [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal]] programming,
* [[TVA (TV network)|TVA]], one of the two private French-language broadcasters in Quebec&lt;sup&gt;[[#Notes|1]]&lt;/sup&gt;,
* nearby independent channels or channels from smaller television systems such as [[Omni Television]] or [[Yes TV]]
* [[CPAC (TV channel)|CPAC]], which broadcasts [[Parliament of Canada|parliamentary]] sessions and committee meetings, along with some political public affairs programming,
* a similar channel broadcasting the proceedings of the provincial legislature,
* [[network affiliates]], typically from the nearest major American city, of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]], [[Fox Network|Fox]], [[NBC]], and [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]&lt;sup&gt;[[#Notes|2]]&lt;/sup&gt;,
* a mixture of Canadian and American special interest channels such as [[The Sports Network|TSN]], [[MuchMusic]], [[CNN]], [[CTV News Channel (Canada)|CTV News Channel]] and [[Showcase (Canadian TV channel)|Showcase]]&lt;sup&gt;[[#Notes|3]]&lt;/sup&gt;.

A further set of Canadian and American special interest channels are offered as ''extended cable'' packages, which are available for additional fees. In the past, cable companies have engaged in the controversial practice of [[negative option billing]], in which a subscriber is automatically given and billed for the new services unless he or she specifically declines them, but this is now illegal.

As well, a package of ''pay TV'' channels is also available for further fees, including movie networks such as [[The Movie Network]], [[Movie Central]], [[Super Channel (Canada)|Super Channel]] and [[Super Écran]], and American [[superstation]]s such as [[WSBK-TV|WSBK]], [[WPIX]], [[WGN America|WGN]] and [[KTLA]] (which are often affiliated with [[The CW Television Network|The CW]] and [[MyNetworkTV]].) These services, however, require a [[Cable converter box|descrambler box]].

A study in 2006 said the CRTC had licensed five ethnic specialty and pay-television services, and 44 digital specialty services across the country.&lt;ref name=ojo/&gt;

Cable companies now offer [[digital cable]] packages in most Canadian cities, including a number of channels which have been licensed exclusively for digital package distribution. Digital cable also typically includes a range of audio broadcast services such as [[Galaxie (radio)|Galaxie]] and [[Max Trax]]. In some markets, digital cable service may also include local radio stations; where this is offered, it has largely ''replaced'' the availability of [[cable FM]] service. Digital cable, however, is provided only if a customer chooses to subscribe to that package. As of 2016, cable companies are also now required to offer a "skinny basic" option, whereby a small selection of channels{{snd}} typically the main over-the-air networks, along with "public service" channels such as [[The Weather Network]] and [[CPAC (TV channel)|CPAC]]{{snd}} are packaged for a maximum fee of $25 with additional channels available on a [[A la carte pay television|pick and pay]] basis at the subcriber's discretion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/skinny-basic-tv-consumers-explainer/article28951724/ "The skinny on skinny basic TV"]. ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', March 1, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Although this package has had some popularity, the traditional larger and more expensive cable packages remain the dominant subscription mode.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.torontosun.com/2016/04/15/skinny-basic-cable-packages-popular-crtc "'Skinny basic' cable packages popular: CRTC"]. ''[[Toronto Sun]]'', April 15, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although this is sometimes controversial, Canadian cable companies are required by the CRTC to practise [[simultaneous substitution]] when a Canadian channel and a non-Canadian channel (which is usually American) are airing the same program at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Super Bowl TV commercials – why are the ads different?|url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/info_sht/tv12.htm|work=crtc.gc.ca|publisher=[[Canadian Radio and Telecommunications Commission]]|accessdate=September 10, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011015823/http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/info_sht/tv12.htm|archivedate=October 11, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Programming on an American service may also be blocked if it has significant bearing on a Canadian legal matter (one episode of ''[[Law &amp; Order]]'', inspired by the trials of [[Paul Bernardo]] and [[Karla Homolka]], was blocked in Canada) or if it interferes with a Canadian channel's broadcast rights (such as [[James Bond]] movies airing on [[Spike TV]]; the Canadian broadcast rights are held by [[Bell Media]].)

Many cable companies also offer high speed [[cable Internet]] service.

===Notes===
# The other French-language broadcaster in Quebec, [[V (TV network)|V]], does not have mandatory national carriage rights, although some cable companies in [[Ontario]] and [[New Brunswick]] offer the network on a discretionary basis, and the network does have mandatory carriage in Quebec.
# Under CRTC rules, American networks are offered on a "4 + 1" basis, meaning that a cable company may offer any four American commercial networks and [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] on basic cable; other American networks can only be offered on a pay tier. In most cities, this means that [[The CW]] and [[MyNetwork TV]] are not available on basic cable because of lower demand for those networks. However, cable providers in border cities have been allowed to offer all American networks on basic cable that are available over the air in that market, even if that means more than four commercial networks are provided. American network affiliates are usually provided from the nearest available American market. However, signals distributed by [[Shaw Broadcast Services]] (particularly affiliates from [[Detroit]] and [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]]) are frequently substituted where cost or technical limitations prevent use of a closer signal.
# Under CRTC rules, cable companies cannot offer a new American service if a comparable Canadian service already exists. However, if a Canadian equivalent begins operations after an American service has already been added to cable packages, the cable company is not required to discontinue the American service. (For example, Canadian cable companies cannot offer [[MTV]], as the station was not yet available in Canada when MuchMusic began broadcasting in 1984. However, cable companies can offer CNN, as they were already offering that service when CBC Newsworld first aired in 1989.) The rules formerly required that the American service be removed if a Canadian equivalent is launched; this caused controversy when the US version of [[Country Music Television|CMT]] was removed from the lineup when [[CMT (Canada)|a new Canadian country music channel]] called the ''New Country Network'' launched. CMT had contested that this was a violation of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]]. Ultimately, Viacom purchased a minority share in the network, and rebranded it under the CMT name.

==Radio broadcasting==
Canada is served by approximately 2,000 radio stations, on both the [[AM radio|AM]] and [[FM radio|FM]] bands.

As with television stations, radio callsigns in Canada are made up of four letters beginning with the [[ITU prefix|two-letter combinations]] of ''CF'', ''CH'', ''CI'', ''CJ'', or ''CK'', although a few stations use three-letter callsigns. In addition to private stations [[CKX-FM|CKX]] and [[CKY-FM|CKY]], some CBC stations have three-letter callsigns, generally in major cities where the stations first aired in the 1930s. Newer CBC stations have normal four-letter callsigns, however. As with CBC television, CBC radio uses callsigns beginning with ''CB'', through a special arrangement with the government of [[Chile]]. A few exceptions, such as [[CKSB (AM)|CKSB]] in [[Winnipeg, Manitoba|Winnipeg]] and [[CJBC (AM)|CJBC]] in [[Toronto]], exist where the CBC acquired an existing station with a historically significant callsign.

The combinations ''CG'', ''CY'', ''CZ'' and several combinations beginning with ''V'' and ''X'' are also assigned to Canada. Only four Canadian radio stations, all in [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador]], have taken call signs in those ranges. Three of these stations, [[VOAR (AM)|VOAR]], [[VOWR]] and [[VOCM (AM)|VOCM]], began broadcasting before Newfoundland was a Canadian province, and retained their ''VO'' call letters when Newfoundland joined [[Canadian Confederation]] in 1949. The other station, [[VOCM-FM]], adopted the callsign in 1981 because of its ownership association with VOCM. With the exception of VOCM-FM, radio stations licensed in Newfoundland after 1949 use the same ''CF''-''CK'' range as other Canadian stations.

The future of ''VO'' callsigns in Canada is unknown. It would not be at all unusual for [[Industry Canada]] to simplify all callsigns used in Canada as part of the ongoing modernization and simplification of domestic telecom regulations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/sp_dgse-ps_dggs.nsf/eng/gg00073.html Broadcasting undertaking callsigns possibly available for assignment]{{snd}} [[Industry Canada]]&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no clear rule for the call letters of repeater stations&amp;mdash;some repeaters are labelled by the call-letters of the originating station, followed by a number, while others have their own distinct call letters. Low-power repeater transmitters (LPRTs) have their own unique callsign format, which consists of the letters VE or VF followed by four numbers.

As of 2014, the four largest major commercial radio broadcast groups in Canada are [[Newcap Broadcasting]], [[Rogers Communications]], [[Corus Entertainment]], and [[Bell Media]]. However, many smaller broadcasters operate radio stations as well. Most genres of music are represented on the Canadian commercial radio spectrum, including [[pop music|pop]], [[rock music|rock]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[country music|country]], [[jazz]] and [[european classical music|classical]]. News, sports, talk radio and religious stations are also available in many cities. In addition, many Canadian universities and colleges have licensed [[campus radio]] stations, and some communities also have [[community radio]] stations or [[List of Christian radio stations in Canada|Christian radio stations]] licensed to [[non-profit]] groups or [[co-operative]]s. Canada has approximately 14 full-time ethnic radio stations.&lt;ref name=ojo&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ojo |first=Tokunbo |title=Ethnic print media in the multicultural nation of Canada |journal=Journalism |date=August 2006 |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=343–361 |doi=10.1177/1464884906065517}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well, the publicly owned [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] operates four national radio networks, two each in [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]]. The English [[CBC Radio One|Radio One]] and the French ''[[Ici Radio-Canada Première]]'' provide news and information programming to most communities in Canada, regardless of size, on either the AM or FM band. The English [[CBC Music]] and French ''[[Ici Musique]]'' provide arts and culture programming, including classical music and opera, and are always on FM, generally serving larger communities only.

Music-based commercial radio stations in Canada are mandated by the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] to reserve at least 35 per cent of their playlists for [[Canadian content]], although exemptions are granted in some border cities (e.g. [[Windsor, Ontario]]) where the competition from American stations threatens the survival of Canadian broadcasters, and for stations whose formats may not have enough Canadian recordings available to meet the 35 per cent target (e.g. classical, jazz or pop standards).

In recent years, a notable trend in Canadian radio has been the gradual abandonment of the AM band, with many AM stations applying for and receiving authorization from the CRTC to convert to the FM band. In some Canadian cities, in fact, the AM band is now either nearly or entirely vacant. Because Canada is more sparsely populated than the United States, the limitations of AM broadcasting (particularly at night, when the AM dial is often overwhelmed by distant signals) have a much more pronounced effect on Canadian broadcasters. AM radio stations have the additional protection that [[cable television|cable]] companies which offer [[cable FM]] services are required by the CRTC to distribute all locally available AM stations through conversion to a cable FM signal, but cable FM only accounts for a small percentage of radio listeners in Canada.

[[Digital audio broadcasting]], or DAB, is an emerging technology in Canada. Although there are currently 73 licensed digital audio broadcasters in Canada, not many consumers yet own digital radios, and the existing digital audio broadcast signals duplicate AM or FM broadcasts. No Canadian radio broadcaster currently offers an exclusively DAB signal.

On November 1, 2004, the CRTC began hearing applications for [[satellite radio]] services. Three applications were filed: one by [[XM Radio Canada]], one by [[Sirius Canada]], and one by the partnership of [[CHUM Limited]] and [[Astral Media]]. These services, which were approved by the CRTC on June 16, 2005, were Canada's first official satellite radio services, although a small ''[[grey market]]'' already existed for American satellite radio receivers. Sirius and XM both launched in December 2005. The CHUM-Astral service, however, was never launched, and its license expired on June 16, 2007; CHUM stated that its business plan was based in part on the expectation that in the interests of Canadian content, the CRTC would have rejected the Sirius and XM applications, approving ''only'' the CHUM-Astral service. The two active services, XM and Sirius, merged into [[Sirius XM Canada]] in 2011, several months after a similar merger between their American counterparts.&lt;ref name=broadcaster&gt;[http://www.broadcastermagazine.com/news/sirius-canada-and-xm-canada-complete-merger/1000486539/ "Sirius Canada and XM Canada Complete Merger"].

==Newspapers==
{{Main|History of Canadian newspapers}}
{{See also|List of Canadian newspapers}}
Almost all Canadian cities are served by at least one daily [[newspaper]], along with community and neighbourhood weeklies. In large cities which have more than one daily newspaper, usually at least one daily is a [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] format. Bilingual cities like [[Montreal]] and [[Ottawa]] have important papers in both French and English.

Canada currently has two major "national" newspapers, ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' and the ''[[National Post]]''. ''[[Le Devoir]]'', though not widely read outside Quebec, is the French-language counterpart to the national newspapers.

The newspaper with the highest circulation overall is the ''[[Toronto Star]]'', while the newspaper with the highest readership per capita is the ''[[Windsor Star]]'' (with the ''[[Calgary Herald]]'' running a very close second).

Canadian newspapers are mostly owned by large chains. The largest of these is the [[CanWest News Service]] chain, owned by [[CanWest]]. [[Quebecor]] owns many tabloid newspapers through its [[Sun Media]] subsidiary, including ''[[Le Journal de Montréal]]'' and the ''[[Toronto Sun]]''.

At various times there have been concerns about [[Concentration of media ownership#Canada|concentration of newspaper ownership]], notably in 1970 and 1980 with two commissions, the [[Keith Davey|Davey Committee]] on combines and the [[Royal Commission on Newspapers|Kent Royal Commission on Newspapers]] respectively, and most recently when [[Conrad Black]]'s [[Hollinger Inc.|Hollinger]] acquired the Southam newspapers in the late 1990s. When Hollinger sold its Canadian properties, however, many of their smaller-market newspapers were in fact purchased by a variety of new ownership groups such as [[Osprey Media]], increasing the diversity of newspaper ownership for the first time in many years.

The 1980s and 1990s have seen the emergence of city-based [[alternative weekly]] newspapers, geared toward a younger audience with coverage of the arts and alternative news. In recent years, many of these weeklies have also been acquired or driven out of business by conglomerates like [[Canwest]], [[Quebecor]] and [[Brunswick News]]. Smaller newspapers like ''[[The Dominion (Canada)|The Dominion]]'', publishing primarily online but in a newspaper format, have attempted to fill gaps in Canada's journalistic coverage while avoiding the vulnerabilities of the previous generation of [[alternative media]]. Canada has over 250 ethnic newspapers.&lt;ref name=ojo/&gt;

In the 2000s, a number of online news and culture magazines have launched to provide [[Alternative Media|alternative sources of journalism]]. Some important online publications include ''[[rabble.ca]]'', ''[[The Tyee]]'', ''[[The Vancouver Observer]]'', [[CBC Radio 3]]/[[Bande à part (radio)|Bande à part]] and ''[[SooToday.com]]''.

==Motion pictures==
{{Main|Cinema of Canada}}
Most of Canada's film (and television) industry produces output geared towards mainstream [[North America]]n audiences, with [[Alliance Atlantis]] and [[Lions Gate Entertainment]] in particular enjoying significant successes in recent years. [[Montreal]], [[Toronto]] and [[Vancouver]] are major production centres, with Vancouver being the second largest film and television production centre in North America (after [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]). The [[Toronto International Film Festival]] is considered one of the most important events in North American film, showcasing both Canadian talent and Hollywood films.

Alliance Atlantis has become by far the largest and most successful Canadian film studio, both as a film and television production house (the company's television properties include ''[[Due South]]'', ''[[This Hour Has 22 Minutes]]'' and ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation|C.S.I.]]''), and as the major Canadian distributor of independent American and international films. Lions Gate Entertainment has also become a major player in recent years.

Canada also produces films of a characteristically "Canadian" nature, and of all Canadian cultural industries, this segment of the film industry has the hardest time escaping the shadow of its (North) American counterpart. Between the marketing budgets of mainstream films, and the largely American-controlled film distribution networks, it has been nearly impossible for most distinctively Canadian films to break through to a wide audience. In many Canadian cities, in fact, moviegoers don't even have the ''option'' of seeing such films, as there aren't any theatres showing them. As a result, a Canadian film is usually considered a runaway hit if it makes as little as $1 million at the box office.

French Canadian films, on the other hand, are often more successful&amp;mdash;as with French-language television, the language difference makes Quebec audiences much more receptive to Canadian-produced film. In many years, the top-grossing Canadian film is a French-language film from Quebec.

As a result of the economic challenges involved in Canadian film production, film funding is often provided by government bodies such as [[Telefilm Canada]], and CBC television is often a Canadian film's most lucrative potential market. However, there is an established network of film festivals which also provide important marketing and audience opportunities for Canadian films. In addition to Toronto's film festival, the smaller [[Vancouver International Film Festival]] features films from around the world, and festivals in [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec]] and [[Greater Sudbury, Ontario]]&amp;mdash;among other cities&amp;mdash;are also important opportunities for Canadian filmmakers to gain exposure among more populist film audiences.

One particular film production house, the [[National Film Board of Canada]], has become internationally famous for its animation and documentary production.

==Publishing==

===Books===
Canada's most famous book publisher is [[McClelland and Stewart]], which made its name in the 1970s as the leading publisher of English language [[Canadian literature]]. English Canada also has many smaller publishing houses, including [[Coach House Press]], [[the Porcupine's Quill]], [[House of Anansi]], [[Key Porter Books]], [[Hidden Brook Press]], and [[Douglas &amp; McIntyre]]. Numerous American and British publishers, including [[Random House]], [[HarperCollins]], [[Alfred A. Knopf]] and [[Penguin Books]], also have Canadian divisions.

Major francophone publishers in Quebec include Bibliothèque québécoise, Alire, Québec-Amérique, Éditions Guérin and Groupe Beauchemin. Several small francophone publishers also operate outside of Quebec, including [[Éditions Le Nordir]] and [[Prise de parole]].

Canada's largest English [[science fiction]] genre publisher is EDGE Science Fiction and Fantasy Publishing, which now also owns the Tesseract Books imprint, well known for producing excellent Canadian speculative fiction.

A notable controversy in Canadian magazine publishing in recent years has been the existence of ''split run'' magazines, where a title published in another country, such as ''[[TIME]]'' or ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', is republished in Canada with a few pages of special Canadian content, in order to take advantage of Canadian [[advertising]] sales revenues. The government of Canada imposed a special [[excise tax]] on split run publications in 1995 to discourage the practice, although this continues to be controversial.

The '''media of Greece''' refers to [[mass media]] outlets based in the [[Republic of Greece]]. Television, magazines, and newspapers are all operated by both state-owned and for-profit corporations which depend on [[advertising]], [[subscription]], and other sales-related revenues. The [[Constitution of Greece]] guarantees freedom of speech.

[[Press freedom]] sharply eroded in Greece during [[Greek government-debt crisis|the economic and financial crisis of 2010–2015]], passing from the 35th place in 2009 in [[Reporters Without Borders]] [[Press Freedom Index]] to the 99th place in 2014, well below all [[Western Balkans]] countries as well as states with repressive media policies such as [[Gabon]], [[Kuwait]] or [[Liberia]].&lt;ref name=euroscope&gt;Thomas Van Der Heijden, [http://publications.europeintheworld.com/media-landscape-greece-must-reform-quickly-3/ Media landscape in Greece must reform quickly], ''Euroscope'', 28 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Greece is today the [[EU member state]] "where journalism and the media face their most acute crisis".&lt;ref name=OSF&gt;Petros Iosifidis and Dimitris Boucas, [https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/sites/default/files/media-policy-independent-journalism-greece-20150511.pdf Media Policy and Independent Journalism in Greece] (PDF), ''[[Open Society Foundation]] report'', 1 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{expand section}}
--&gt;

==Legislative framework==
[[Freedom of expression]] is guaranteed by the [[Constitution of Greece]] since the return to civilian rule in 1975. According to Article 14, everyone may express his thoughts orally, in writing and through the press in compliance with the laws. 
The same article establishes that the press is free, that [[censorship]] and the seizure of publications are forbidden, and that the [[right to reply]] to errors is also guaranteed.
Art.14(9) foresees that media ownership and financing are registered, and prohibits concentration of ownership.
&lt;ref name=EJClaw&gt;Maria Kontochristou and Nagia Mentzi, [http://ejc.net/media_landscapes/greece#link_258 Greece #Media Legislation], Media Landscapes, European Journalism Centre, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Art.15 states that “protective provisions for the press are not applicable to films, sound recordings, radio, television or any other similar medium for the transmission of speech or images. Radio and television shall be under the direct control of the state. The control and imposition of administrative sanctions are under the exclusive competence of the NCRTV, which is an independent authority, as specified by law.”.&lt;ref name=EJClaw/&gt;

The law restricts speech that incites fear, violence and public unrest, as well as publication that are obscene, offending religious belief or calling for violence against the political system. Defamation and insults are crimes punished up to imprisonment.&lt;ref name=FH&gt;[https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2015/greece Greece], Freedom House report 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Access to information]] is established by the Constitution, and individual access mechanisms are detailed by a 1999 amendment to the Administrative Procedure Code. Access can be restricted for information concerning national security, criminal investigations, as well as [[privacy]] concerns.&lt;ref name=FH/&gt;

The press is regulated first by Law 1092/1938, which includes obligations to respect privacy and separate news from comments, as well as to publish corrections. The press is deemed to respect different opinion and refrain from inciting mass panic.&lt;ref name=EJClaw/&gt;

The [[public service broadcaster]] [[Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation]] (ERT) is regulated by Law 1730/1987. ERT is mandated to manage and develop state radio and TV, and broadcast the activities of the Greek Parliament. It should aim at reaching as many social groups possible and cover a wide range of topics, to satisfy the public interest.&lt;ref name=EJClaw/&gt;

Commercial radio and TV stations were allowed following Law 1866/1989. The state monopoly was finally abolished with Law 2328/1995, which conditions the granting of licenses by NCRTV for commercial channels to whether they would serve a public interest. Commercial channels have quality requirements to maintain their licences.&lt;ref name=EJClaw/&gt;
The same Law 1866/1989 sets limits for media ownership, outlawing cross-ownership among the main newspaper publications. Companies are also limited to owning only one TV station, radio station, or electronic media company.
The 2007 “Law of the Basic Shareholder” allows acquisition of shares in other media companies if for a minor quota in the company (beyond the 10 first shareholders) and in the market (not beyond 35% of sector market share).
Foreign companies are also limited to acquire maximum 25% shares in a Greek media company.&lt;ref name=EJClaw/&gt;

Subscription-based radio and television services are regulated by Law 2644/1998. Terrestrial transmissions require a competitive licensing procedure; licenses are granted only to limited companies (S.A.), whose shares must be registered. Satellite transmissions must anyway submit an application to NCRTV. Licenses are limited to ensure pluralism and prevent [[dominant market position]]s. Cross-ownership is limited: "an interested party may only participate in one company that provides subscription-based services using the same means of distribution as well as a second company that uses different means of distribution".&lt;ref name=EJClaw/&gt; The maximum share that an entity can own in a broadcasting media is of 40%. Further provisions on media ownership are included in Law 3592/2007.

The [[Television Without Frontiers]] (TVWF) directive was transposed in Greece with the Decree 100/2000. The New [[Audiovisual Media Service Directive]] (AVMS) has also been transposed by 2009.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} TV programmes are classified and labelled according to their potential negative influence on minors.&lt;ref name=EJClaw/&gt;

The state has as traditional strong interventionist role in the media field in Greece, both as a censor (in dictatorship times), an owner (of TV and radio broadcasting channels) and a subsidizer of the media. This has proved feritle ground for patronage politics, with the intertwining of political, economic and sectoral interest, and a culture of self-censorship in journalism.&lt;ref name=OSF/&gt;

Deregulation is deemed to have increased the choice menu of viewers, but also to have promoted ownership concentration of press, TV and radio outlets in the hands of few large organisations. At the same time, law in Grek has been ineffective, e.g. in license regulation, leaving the market be dominated by few big interests, which regulatory authorities have proved only superficial and ambivalent in the work.&lt;ref name=OSF/&gt;

===Status and self-regulation of journalists===
The journalists' job in Greece has been heavily affected by the financial crisis of the last years. With the decline in advertising revenues and circulation, many media outlets have scaled down or closed. Strikes for unpaid wages have happened more and more often.&lt;ref name=FH/&gt;

The [[NCRTV]] issues a Code of Journalist Ethics which is regulatory and mandatory for printed press journalists in Greece. 
The NCRTV also developed a Code of Conduct for News and Other Political Programs, for broadcast media, in consultation with professional bodies (the National Federation of the Reporters' Associations, advertising agencies, and public and private broadcasters), which was ratified by the Presidential Decree 77/2003.
Finally, the NCRTV issued a Code of Ethics on Broadcasting Advertisement. The NCRTV can issue penalties for non-compliance with its codes, up to halting the operations of the broadcasting station for three months.&lt;ref name=EJClaw/&gt;

Other non-mandatory codes of conduct have been developed by unions and professional organisations. 
In 1988 the five main journalists' unions ratified a Code of Ethics of Greek journalists. The [[Union of Owners of Daily Newspapers of Athens]] (AADNP) and the Union of Owners of Regional Newspapers also co-issued a Code of Ethics.&lt;ref name=EJClaw/&gt;

Self-regulation in advertising is contained in the Hellenic Advertising Code, agreed upon by the major media and the advertising industry. The Code establishes a two-tier system for hearing complaints, through a Committee for the Control of Advertisements, and a second-level Joint Committee for the Control of Advertisements.&lt;ref name=EJClaw/&gt;

=== Public service broadcaster ===

Until the Greek government closed the company down on 11 June 2013, the state [[radio]] and [[television]] [[broadcasting]] agency was [[Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation|ERT]] (Elliniki Radiofonia kai Tileorasi - Greek Radio &amp; Television).  The station owned 3 national television stations, [[ET1 (Greece)|ET-1]], [[New Hellenic Television|NET]] (Nea Elliniki Tileorasi) and [[ET3 (Greece)|ET-3]] which was based out of [[Thessaloniki]]. In January 2006, ERT launched [[Digital Terrestrial Television]] with 3 channels. By March 2006, at least 65% of the Greek population was able to view Digital TV for free with the use of set-top boxes. ERT also operated 7 national radio stations, including [[ERA 5]], the [[Voice of Greece]], which broadcast internationally via shortwave.  ERT was based in Athens.

As above, the Greek government announced the closure of ERT on 11 June 2013 with effect from midnight that evening. Since its official closure, employees of ERT have continued broadcasting with their feed being retransmitted online by various websites both inside and outside of Greece notably the CYBC in Cyprus and via the website of the EBU (European Broadcasting Union). The closure of ERT has had political implications in Greece with the smallest party of the Greek coalition government, the Democratic Left withdrawing from government leaving Greece with a New Democracy / PASOK coalition government which has a majority of only three seats.

The closure of ERT left Greece without a broadcaster with national reach, and deprived the country of a voice that, although seen as promoting the government line and having a state-appointed board, also aired opposition views and employed competent and professional journalists.&lt;ref name=euroscope/&gt; The end of ERT was deemed to damage pluralism in Greek journalism, as ERT was the only broadcaster legally obliged to air unbiased news.&lt;ref name=OSF/&gt; The loss of job security for almost 3,000 permanent and temporary employees was a big blow, forcing professional Greek journalists to accept work under deteriorated conditions in private media.&lt;ref name=OSF/&gt;

After the closure of ERT, due to its perceived lack of financial transparency, many journalists protested with sit-ins and continued self-managed broadcasts of "[[ERT OPEN]]",&lt;ref name=euroscope/&gt; also in regional facilities, until evicted by police forces. Electricity cuts to the ERT HQ in [[Rhodes]] led to a transmitter being taking off air and the facility being looted.&lt;ref name=FH/&gt;  ERT OPEN survived for one year based on donations from unions and workers.&lt;ref name=euroscope/&gt;
At the end of 2014, many former ERT employees still had not received severance pay, while others had been disqualified from it or had to face severance cuts.&lt;ref name=FH/&gt;

ERT was later replaced with [[NERIT]], a media with a smaller budget and staff base (around 500), under the control of the government.

The first non-[[pirate radio|pirate]] private radio station to broadcast in Greece was [[Athena 98.4 FM]], in 1987.  Private television began in November 1989 when [[Mega Channel]] began operating.  Today, over 1,000 radio stations and approximately 150 television stations broadcast in Greece.  Digital satellite broadcasting began in 1999 by the South-African conglomerate [[Naspers]] which uses the trademark Nova.

The Broadcasting Media in Greece was deemed considerably free and fair in 2012. Established state-run and commercial TV networks broadcast nationally and compete actively against each other, and hundreds of thousands of viewers subscribe to satellite pay-TV services.Domestically-made variety programmes, comedies and game shows dominate the peak-time TV schedules and are highly popular and widely shown in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/country_profiles/1009249.stm BBC], 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The last licensing tender for the broadcast media was held in 2002 and licenses have since expired. The government has repeatedly issued one-year extensions, notwithstanding a 2011 decision of the [[Council of State (Greece)|Council of State]] declaring the practice unconstitutional. Many stations rely on "certificates of legality" that are subject to arbitrary revocation.&lt;ref name=FH/&gt;

TV and radio stations operate on the same frequencies as in 1999, notwithstanding interferences from neighbouring countries. Since August 2014, "news station" radios can change into "non-news stations", but not the other way around, giving rise to risk of insulation of the news station market.&lt;ref name=FH/&gt;

Licensing and regulations constitute strong barriers in the media market, particularly for broadcasting, since purchasing an existing station is the only way to enter the market.&lt;ref name=FH/&gt;

Information on [[media ownership]] is available to the public, but it is often "veiled" through holding companies and other little-known legal entities. No ownership information is provided for print or online media.&lt;ref name=FH/&gt;

Media ownership concentration in Greece is a growing issue, with cross-media ownership also affecting [[media independence]], due to the economic interests of media owners in other sectors of the economy (particularly [[shipping]] and telecommunications). The sector is dominated by six large multimedia companies: [[Antenna Group]], [[Lambrakis Press Group]], [[Pegasus Press Group]], [[Skai Group]], [[Alpha Media Group]], and [[Vardiniogiannis Group]].&lt;ref name=FH/&gt;

Notwithstanding the dire financial conditions of many enterprises in the sector, media have been able to secure loans even during bank recapitalisation and selective lending periods. [[Mega Channel]] received a 98 million € loan in 2013.&lt;ref name=FH/&gt;

The placement of state advertising in the media has been pointed as based on political patronage rather than audience size. Political parties also tend to favour favourable media outlets for advertising campaigns (e.g. [[Syriza]]'s relation with [[Hot Doc]] magazine). Th 20% tax on advertising revenues for TV stations, introduced in 2010, has never been collected; TV stations were once again exempted in 2014.&lt;ref name=FH/&gt;

===Print media===
{{See also|List of newspapers in Greece}}

The main newspapers in Greece are [[Kathimerini]] (established 1919, 47,682 copies daily in 2010), [[To Vima]] (1922, 44,144 copies in 2010), [[Ta Nea]] (1931, 55,014 copies in 2010) and [[Εleftherotypia]] (1975, 40,848 copies in 2010).&lt;ref name=EG&gt;[http://www.ellinikiglossa.eu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=91&amp;Itemid=99&amp;lang=en Elleniki Glossa]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 there were 82 national newspapers in Greece, of which 8 morning editions, 13 evening, 22 Sunday and 16 weekly. Sunday newspapers remained the main format, with 56.2% of sales. Most Sunday readers in 2010 chose [[Proto Thema]] and [[To Vima tis Kyriakis]] (189,389 and 187,664 copies) followed by [[Kyriakatiki Eleftherotypia]] (153,085 copies).&lt;ref name=EJCprint&gt;Maria Kontochristou and Nagia Mentzi, [http://ejc.net/media_landscapes/greece#link_242 Greece #Print Media], Media Landscapes, European Journalism Centre, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

607 regional/local editions also circulated, of which 65 for [[Attica]]. The free press was introduced in Greece in 2000 with Metrorama (later Metro), later followed by City Press.&lt;ref name=EJCprint/&gt;

Introduction of private television in the late 1980s likely led to a [[decline of newspapers]] sales throughout the 1990s, from a daily average of 2.6m copies in 1989 to 1.9m in 1992. Most Greek newspapers found themselves in a dire financial situation already in the mid-1990s. The end of the decade  brought the system back to stability, with increasing circulation for a pluralistic and critical press, although linked to parties' partisanships. Sunday newspapers brought quality editions to readers. The good period (+26% circulation) went on till around 2005. The 2005–2010 years brought the Greek press back in the state of the early 1990s.&lt;ref name=EJCprint/&gt;

The press market in Greece shows a strong concentration of ownership among few publishers: Lambrakis Press S.A., Pegasus Publishing and Printing S.A (Bobolas Publishing Group), Tegopoulos Publishing S.A (Tegopoulos Publishing Group), Kathimerini Publications S.A. (Alafouzos Publishing Group) and Acropolis (Apogevmatini Publishing Group).&lt;ref name=EJCprint/&gt;

Interest- and sector-based [[magazines]] also have a strong market in Greece, with around 174 magazines in 2010; glossy publications have to compete with Sunday supplements of newspapers, including popular issues such as To Vima's [[Vimagazino]].&lt;ref name=EJCprint/&gt;

The print sector has shrunk recently, due to the fallout of the financial crisis. Circulation figures have fallen, and many outlets were forced to shut down,&lt;ref name=FH/&gt; due to reduced advertisement revenues. This has also affected employment, with journalists driven to accept lower work conditions and to resort to self-censorship to preserve job security.&lt;ref name=OSF/&gt;

Major public and private publications show strong partisan bias. The relations between media owners and political (and governmental) officers have a cooling effect on the presence of critical commentaries in the press.&lt;ref name=FH/&gt;

Examples of new models of journalism include the Editors' Newspaper (''[[EfSyn]]''), the magazine ''Unfollow'' and the online ''Press Project''.&lt;ref name=OSF/&gt;
Online news portals include [[in.gr]], [[TV Without Borders]], and [[The Press Project]].&lt;ref name=EG/&gt; Internet has grown in prominence, yet it also has been indicated as a source of low-quality journalism and dependence on big-firm advertisement.&lt;ref name=OSF/&gt;

===Publishing===
{{Main article|Category:Publishing companies of Greece}}

The Greek publishing industry mainly features [[small and medium enterprises]], often family-based, and mostly founded after the democratisation in 1974, with very little agglomeration among them.&lt;ref name=BIEF/&gt;
Publishing companies active on the Greek market were 374 in 1990 and grew to 841 in 2008. Most of them were based in Athens (82%), 11% in Thessaloniki, and only 7% elsewhere. The market is quite concentrated: 23% of companies published 81% of books in 2008.&lt;ref name=EKEBI/&gt;{{Update inline|date=January 2016}} 
Only one publishing company is listed at the [[Athens Stock Exchange]]. Most of the production is outsourced. Book selling is done through networks of small and medium distributors, selling different publishers' books through companies salespeople. Book prices are set by the publishers, and since 1998 retailers are compelled by law not to sell at more than 10% discount for the first two years, nor to add more than a 5% surcharge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nosycrow.com/blog/selling-books-in-greece-a-guest-post-by-nikos-argyris-of-ikaros-publishing/ Nosy Crow]&lt;/ref&gt; Average paperback book prices reached 17,00 euros in  2007/2008.&lt;ref name=EKEBI&gt;National Book Centre EKEBI: The book market in Greece, 5th revised edition, May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; VAT on books is of 4.5%, compared to 9% and 19% on other products.{{Update inline|date=January 2016}}&lt;ref name=BIEF&gt;BIEF (Bureau International de l’Edition Française): L’édition en Grèce, study by Karen Politis, Département Etudes, January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FKF&gt;[http://www.buchmesse.de/pdf/buchmesse/buchmarkt_griechenland_e.pdf Frankfurter Buchmesse], Greece, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The publishing industry doubled the number of published titles in the 1990s, arriving at a total sale in 2004 of 569.7 million euros.&lt;ref&gt;estimate of the National Book Centre EKEBI&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the market came at an approximate number of 9,500 new titles yearly in 2005–08, of which around 2,000 in humanities and social sciences.&lt;ref name=FKF/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Biblionet, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; These numbers have shrunk since the financial crisis.{{Update inline|date=January 2016}}

The 10 leading Greek publishing companies in 2008 included [[Patakis]] (346 titles), [[Modern Times (publishing house)|Modern Times]] (343 titles), [[Lambrakis Press]] (268 titles), [[Minoas]] (211 titles), [[Metaichmio]] (204 titles), [[Livanis]] (193 titles),  [[Savalas]] (191 titles),  [[Kastaniotis]] (185 titles),  [[Kedros]] (180 titles), and [[Psichogios]] (146 titles). Other important Greek publishing companies are [[Ellinika Grammata]] (2007: 295 titles) and [[A.N. Sakkoulas]] (2007: 226 titles)&lt;ref name=EKEBI/&gt;&lt;ref name=FKF/&gt;

Bookshops in Greece are more than 2,000, with 3,500 other sales outlets, including magazine retailers and supermarkets. Most of them are in Athens (50%) and in other major centres. The major chainstores are [[Papasotiriou]],  [[Eleftheroudakis]],  [[Ianos]], [[Protoporia]],  [[Kosmos-Floras]], [[Leader Books]], [[Hellenic Distribution Agency / Newsstand]], [[Fnac]], [[Public (publishing house)|Public]].&lt;ref name=EKEBI/&gt;&lt;ref name=FKF/&gt;

The [[Greek Federation of Publishers and Booksellers]] is member of the [[International Publishers Association]] (IPA), the [[Federation of European Publishers]] (FEP) and the [[European Booksellers Federation]] (EBF).&lt;ref name=FKF/&gt;

The main book fair in the country is the [[International Thessaloniki Book Fair]], held every year in April or May and open to the public. It is organised by the [[NationalBook Centre of Greece]] in cooperation with [[HELEXPO]] S.A., the [[Hellenic Federation of Publishers and Booksellers]], and the city of [[Thessaloniki]], and has the Greek ministry of culture as its patron.&lt;ref name=FKF/&gt;

===Radio broadcasting===
{{See also|List of radio stations in Greece}}
The use of radio is widespread in Greece, with 5.02 million receivers in 1997. The [[public service broadcaster]] [[Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation|ERT]] owns five radio stations: Second Programme, ERA-3, NET Radio, ERA Sport, KOSMOS.

[[Athena 9.84 FM]] was in 1987 the first non-pirate private radio station in Greece, aired by the Municipality of Athens. In 2010 there were around 1,000 radio stations (56 in Attica) mostly private and with local coverage. 90% of them did not hold an official license, but could be deemed eligible for one. Around 60 Athens radio had been shut down in 2001, allegedly for interfering with frequencies used by the new [[Athens International Airport]], but most of them re-opened in 2002-2005. The licensing process remains inconsistent.

The main channels were the music stations [[Skai Radio]] (owned by Alafouzos Publishing Company) with 10.8% and [[Rythmos]] (8.4%); the main sports station was Nova Sport FM (7.1%).&lt;ref name=EJCradio&gt;Maria Kontochristou and Nagia Mentzi, [http://ejc.net/media_landscapes/greece#link_243 Greece #Radio], Media Landscapes, European Journalism Centre, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Hellenic Radio Network]], managed by [[Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation|ERT]], broadcasts Greek radio abroad. Radio programmes in other languages than Greek are foreseen by e.g. Athens 9.84 and Skai Radio.&lt;ref name=EJCradio/&gt;

A 2007 law requires radio stations to use the [[Greek language]] as the main language, as well as to have certain funds in reserve and to employ a minimum number of full-time employees. This creates a disproportionate burden for smaller and municipality-owned radio stations; there is no separate provision for community-based radios, and several student-run radios were subject to attempts by authorities to shut them down in 2014.&lt;ref name=FH/&gt;
The 2007 law also allows those radio stations affiliated to political parties represented in the [[Hellenic Parliament]] to broadcast without a license. This was extended in 2013 by a NCRTV decision to Art TV, owned by LAOS, that only had [[European Parliament]] representation. Art TV remained on air also after LAOS lost European Parliament representation at the [[European Parliament election, 2014 (Greece)|2014 elections]].&lt;ref name=FH/&gt;
Since August 2014, "news station" radios can change into "non-news stations", but not the other way around, giving rise to risk of insulation of the news station market.&lt;ref name=FH/&gt;
Rising utility costs and prohibitive music licensing fees led to many radio stations facing large unpaid debts by the end of 2014.&lt;ref name=FH/&gt;

===Television broadcasting===
{{Main article|Television in Greece}}

Television broadcasting in Greece was officially allowed in 1951. Broadcasts started in 1966.

Television was the main means of information for most Greek citizens in 2010, with 3.7 million households with a TV set. The market was de-regulated in 1989 with the end of state monopoly and the creation of private television stations, that now dominate the market.&lt;ref name=EJCtv&gt;Maria Kontochristou and Nagia Mentzi, [http://ejc.net/media_landscapes/greece#link_244 Greece #Television], Media Landscapes, European Journalism Centre, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The public service broadcasters are [[Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation|ERT]] and Vouli TV (dedicated to Parliament debates). Eight national TV stations are licensed: [[902 Aristera sta FM]], [[Alpha TV]], [[Alter Channel]], [[ANT1]], [[Mega Channel]], [[Skai TV]], [[Star Channel (Greece)|Star Channel]], [[Makedonia TV]]. The three licensed local/regional TVs are [[Tileasti]], [[Tiletora]] and the Municipal Channel of Thessaloniki. Other 123 had applied for a license in 2010.&lt;ref name=EJCtv/&gt;

Satellite broadcasting channels include the public ERT-World and Vouli TV and the private [[Antenna-Sat]], [[Mega Cosmos]], [[Alpha Without Frontiers]], [[Star Channel (Greece)|Star International]], [[Teleasty]], [[Alter Globe]], [[Channel 10 (Greece)|Channel 10]], [[Mad International]] and [[Extra 3]]. Foreign satellite channels are broadcast by ERT for free, including [[CNN International]], [[Cyprus Sat]], [[RIK 1]]. The [[Hellas-Sat 2]] satellites allows to re-broadcast programmes to Europe, the Middle East and South Africa.&lt;ref name=EJCtv/&gt;

In 2010, the TV market was led by [[Mega Channel]] (22.1 percent audience) and Antenna (16.8%), followed by Alpha TV (15.1 percent) and Star (11.4 percent). Public channels have lower viewerships (NET 10.09 percent, ET-3 4 percent and ET-1 3.7 percent). Advertisers likewise favour private channels.&lt;ref name=EJCtv/&gt;

[[Pay-TV]] was introduced by [[Multichoice Hellas]] with its NOVA bouquet of satellite channels. Poor infrastructure has kept back the development of [[cable TV]] (below 1% penetration). Until 1998, only public service broadcasters could lay and operate cable infrastructure. At 8.9%, Greece had the lowest EU rate of cable and satellite TV penetration in 2010.&lt;ref name=EJCtv/&gt;

In 2013 the company [[Digea]] (co-owned by Greece's main private TV network) won the tender for a nationwide license to operate Greece's [[digital television]] transmitters, also due to the closure of the possible competitor, the public broadcaster ERT.&lt;ref name=OSF/&gt; The tender, which was reported as "heavily tailored", created a new [[monopoly]], since Digea is able to collect monthly fees from all TV stations wishing to broadcast digitally, despite a law prohibiting a network provider from being a content provider too.&lt;ref name=FH/&gt;

On September 2, 2016, four national television licenses were auctioned in Greece in a highly unusual competitive bidding process. The licenses were bought by ANT1 TV (Thodoris Kyriakou) for €75.9m, Alter Ego (Evangelos Marinakis) for €73.9m, Ioannis-Vladimiros Kalogritsas for 52.6m and SKAI TV (Iannis Alafouzos) for €43.6m.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tradewindsnews.com/incoming/775802/marinakis-wins-greek-tv-licence|title=Marinakis wins Greek TV licence|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Tradewinds|access-date=2016-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.parapolitika.gr/article/377337/se-marinaki-kyriakoy-kalogritsa-kai-alafoyzo-oi-tileoptikes-adeies-poso-kostisan|title=Σε Μαρινάκη, Κυριακού, Καλογρίτσα και Αλαφούζο οι τηλεοπτικές άδειες - Πόσο κόστισαν|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Parapolitika|access-date=2016-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cinema===
{{Main article|Greek cinema}}
[[File:John Malkovich press conference, TIFF 2007.jpg|thumb|Press conference at the [[Thessaloniki International Film Festival]]]]

Cinema first appeared in Greece in 1896 but the first actual cine-theatre was opened in 1907.  In 1914 the ''Asty Films Company'' was founded and the production of long films begun. ''Golfo'' (Γκόλφω), a well known traditional love story, is the first Greek long movie, although there were several minor productions such as newscasts before this. In 1931, [[Orestis Laskos]] directed ''Daphnis and Chloe'' (''Δάφνις και Χλόη''), contained the first nude scene in the history of European cinema; it was also the first Greek movie which was played abroad.  In 1944 [[Katina Paxinou]] was honoured with the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls (film)|For Whom the Bell Tolls]]''.

The 1950s and early 1960s are considered by many as the Greek Golden age of Cinema. Directors and actors of this era were recognized as important historical figures in Greece and some gained international acclaim: [[Mihalis Kakogiannis]], [[Alekos Sakellarios]], [[Melina Mercouri]], [[Nikos Tsiforos]], [[Iakovos Kambanelis]], [[Katina Paxinou]], [[Nikos Koundouros]], [[Ellie Lambeti]], [[Irene Papas]] etc. More than sixty films per year were made, with the majority having film noir elements.  Notable films were ''Η κάλπικη λίρα'' (1955 directed by [[Giorgos Tzavellas]]), ''Πικρό Ψωμί'' (1951, directed by Grigoris Grigoriou), ''[[O Drakos]]'' (1956 directed by [[Nikos Koundouros]]), ''[[Stella (1955 film)|Stella]]'' (1955 directed by Cacoyannis and written by Kampanellis). Cacoyannis also directed ''Zorba the Greek'' with Anthony Quinn which received Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film nominations. [[Finos Film]] also contributed to this period with movies such as ''Λατέρνα, Φτώχεια και Φιλότιμο'', ''Η Θεία από το Σικάγο'', ''Το ξύλο βγήκε από τον Παράδεισο'' and many more.  During the 1970s and 1980s [[Theo Angelopoulos]] directed a series of notable and appreciated movies. His film ''[[Eternity and a Day]]'' won the [[Palme d'Or]] and the [[Prize of the Ecumenical Jury]] at the [[1998 Cannes Film Festival]].

There were also internationally renowned filmmakers in the Greek diaspora such as the Greek-American [[Elia Kazan]].

The Greek Film Centre recorded 13 fiction films and 14 documentaries shot in Greece in 2008. 
In 2007, 274 cinemas were registered in Greece, and in 2008 38.5 percent of Greeks went to cinema at least once.&lt;ref name=EJC&gt;Maria Kontochristou and Nagia Mentzi, [http://ejc.net/media_landscapes/greece#link_242 Greece], Media Landscapes, European Journalism Centre, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Telecommunications===
[[File:Athens-Kiffisia-aerial.jpg|thumb|240px|[[OTE]] headquarters in Athens]]
{{Main article|Telecommunications in Greece}}
The telecommunications and postal services market in Greece is regulated by the [[Hellenic Telecommunications and Post Commission]] (EETT), which issing{{Clarify|date=March 2016}} official licences to service providers.&lt;ref name=EJC/&gt;

[[OTE]], the former state monopoly until 1994, is the main player in [[fixed line telephony]]. Since the liberalization of the telecommunications market, OTE has been slowly losing market share to competing telecom operators, such as [[hellas online]], [[WIND HELLAS|Wind]], [[Cyta]], [[Forthnet]] and [[Tilefonia]]. As of 2005, OTE's share on the market hovered around 76%. Land lines in use were 6,348,800 in 2004.

Greece has three [[mobile telecom]] companies; [[Cosmote]] (state-owned), [[Vodafone Greece|Vodafone]], [[WIND Hellas|WIND]] and [[CYTA]]. Active mobile lines were 20,285,000 in September 2009, which means 180% penetration.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.enet.gr/?i=news.el.ellada&amp;id=100711&lt;/ref&gt;

Greece owns one [[telecommunications satellite]], named [[Hellas-sat]], which provides telecommunication services in a major part of Eastern Europe and Western Asia.

===Internet===
{{main article|Internet in Greece}}

The '''Internet in Greece''' relied on [[public switched telephone network|PSTN]]/[[Integrated Services Digital Network|ISDN]] modem [[dial-up Internet access|dial-up]] from 1990 until 2003, when [[Asymmetric digital subscriber line|ADSL]] was commercially launched by incumbent operator [[OTE]]. ADSL2+ and VDSL2 is currently the main broadband standard. Greece also has [[Universal Mobile Telecommunications System|3G]] and 4G+ [[mobile broadband]] ([[High Speed Packet Access|HSPA]]) and a more expensive [[Satellite Internet access]].
Greece has an extensive fiber optic network throughout the country.

63% of the Greek population regularly accessed the internet in 2014.&lt;ref name=FH/&gt;

==Media Organisations==

===News agencies===

Greece's public news agency is the [[Athens-Macedonian News Agency]] (AMNA), created in 2006 by the merger of [[Athens News Agency]] (ANA, est. 1895) with the [[Macedonian News Agency]] (MPA, est. 1991). In 2010 AMNA had 250 employees, of which 180 journalists, and it publishes items in Greek, English and French. Other news agencies include regional ones ([[Cretian News Agency]], [[Aegean News]]), sport-focused (Sport Idea, Action image), religion (The Religious News Network), agriculture (Agronews Agency), Greek diaspora (Hellenic World, Greek American news agency, Diaspora News Agency etc.), photography (Inke photography agency, EPA photography agency).&lt;ref name=EJC/&gt;

===Trade unions===

[[Trade union]]s among journalists are widespread in Greece and organised on a regional base. They include the [[Union of Journalists of Daily Newspapers of Athens]], the [[Union of Journalists of Daily Newspapers of Macedonia-Thrace]]; the [[Union of Journalists of Daily Newspapers of Peloponissos, Epirus and Islands]]; the [[Union of Journalists of Daily Newspapers of Thessaly, Sterea, Evia]]; and the Union of Journalists of Periodical Press. 
The [[Pan Hellenic Confederation of Associations of ERT Personnel]] represents the [[public service broadcaster]]'s employees.

Media employers' associations include the [[Association of Athens Daily Newspaper Publishers]], the Association of Daily Provincial Newspaper Publishers, the Association of Regional TV Channels, the [[Union of Owners of Athenian Private Radio Stations]].

Other major industry organisations include: The National Private TV Channels Association, the [[Hellenic Association of Radio Owners]], the [[Hellenic Radio Technicians Association]], the [[Greek Association of Film Critics]] and the [[Association of Greek Film Producers – Directors]].

===Regulatory authorities===
The main regulatory authority in Greece is the General Secretariat of Information – Communication (formerly the Ministry of Press &amp; Mass Media), which fomulates policy and supervises the implementation of legislation in the media sector.&lt;ref name=EJCreg&gt;Maria Kontochristou and Nagia Mentzi, [http://ejc.net/media_landscapes/greece#link_260 Greece #Regulatory Authority], Media Landscapes, European Journalism Centre, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Greek National Council for Radio and Television]] (ESR/NCRTV), founded in 1989, is the independent supervisory and regulatory administrative authority of the radio and television market. It consists of seven members – a President, a Vice President and five members, which are all appointed by the Greek Parliament.
The NCRTV is the main regulator for private and public broadcast media, established by the Law 1866/1989 as an independent authority whose action is only subordinated to the courts. It grants licenses to private radios and TV, and ensures the respect of the law by license-holders. It can impose penalties, up to suspending or cancelling licenses.&lt;ref name=EJCreg/&gt;
The last licensing tender was held in 2002 and licenses have since expired. The government has repeatedly issued one-year extensions, notwithstanding a 2011 decision of the [[Council of State (Greece)|Council of State]] declaring the practice unconstitutional. Many stations rely on "certificates of legality" that are subject to arbitrary revocation.&lt;ref name=FH/&gt;
The terms of several NCRTV members, included its President, expired in 2012, but they have remained in their position despite the [[Council of State (Greece)|Council of State]]'s 2013 declaration of unconstitutionality of the status quo.&lt;ref name=FH/&gt;
The NCRTV has been accused of lacking impartiality and of uneven implementation of regulations and penalties, based on political affiliations of media outlets.&lt;ref name=FH/&gt;

The TV Audience Research Control Committee ([[TV ARCC]]) is the audience measurement authority. It includes representatives from the [[Union of Hellenic Advertisers]], the [[Union of Hellenic Advertising Agencies]], the public broadcaster ([[Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation|ERT]]), the major commercial broadcasters and the [[Association of Hellenic Market and Opinion Research Companies]].&lt;ref name=EJCreg/&gt;

The Assembly of Viewers and Listeners (ASKE) has a consultative role on TV programming and advertising.&lt;ref name=EJCreg/&gt;

The [[Hellenic Telecommunications and Post Commission]] (EETT) is the main authority in the telecommunication and postal services field.&lt;ref name=EJCreg/&gt;

The Ministry of Culture is the responsible body for regulating the cinema sector, in collaboration with the [[Greek Film Centre]], aiming to ensure “the protection, support and development of the art of film in Greece” and “the presentation, promulgation and promotion of Greek films both at home and abroad.”&lt;ref name=EJCreg/&gt;

Other independent regulatory bodies include the [[Hellenic Authority for Communication Security and Privacy]] ([[ADAE]]), and the [[Hellenic Data Protection Authority]].&lt;ref name=EJCreg/&gt;

The [[Greek Self-Regulating Organisation for Internet Content]], or Safenet, is a [[no profit organisation]] founded in 1999 by the three main Greek ISPs, together with the [[Greek National Research Network]], the [[Greek Association of Internet Users]] and a large Greek Consumers Association ([[Ekpizo]]). Safenet aims to promote internet self-regulation to combat illegal and offensive Web content, as well as raising awareness about it.&lt;ref name=EJCreg/&gt;

==Media concentration and pluralism==

===Overview===

In Greece, level of media concentration is high. It affects both the print and broadcasting sectors and has increased in last decades together with the emergence of cross-ownership problems. The interdependence between political and media elites is considered among the major factors leading to ineffective and contradictory media policies and poor implementation of anti-corruption rules.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The Greek media landscape changed significantly after the deregulation process affecting the broadcasting sector in the late 1980s.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=LEANDROS|first=NIKOS|year=2010|title=Media Concentration and Systemic Failures in Greece|url=http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/viewFile/795/464|journal=International Journal of Communication|volume=4|pages=|access-date=24 March 2017|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the 1980s, the media landscape was dominated by the monopoly of public broadcaster (ERT) while private owners of publishing firms had their business activities limited to this sector (i.e. newspaper, periodical printing and publishing).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Tis situation changed in the 1980s with the entrance in the media market of new investors and big industrials and led to a transformation of ownership patterns.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; During this transition, the owners of some renowned newspapers (''Akropolis'', ''Khatimerini'', etc.), unable to implement modernization programs were forced to sell their activities. At the same time, new editorial projects were launched by entrepreneurs whose activities extended also in other sectors. This process went together with the increase of business opportunities in the information sector.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The process of deregulation of broadcasting and radio sectors happened in a legal void which provided opportunities to media owners to grab television and radio frequencies and to initiate broadcasting without licenses.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Media market concentration in terms of market concentration was a consequence of the diversification of newspaper publishers in the field of television, which happened in a poorly regulated and hardly transparent media environment.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=BÁRD|first=Petra|last2=BAYER|first2=Judith|year=2016|title=A comparative analysis of media freedom and pluralism in the EU Member States.

Policy Department Citizens' Rights and Constitutional Affairs|publisher=European Parliament|volume=|pages=|access-date=24 March 2017|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Private TV expanded rapidly, without embracing a pluralistic profile.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The internet and digital information services have become more increasingly relevant in the Greek media landscape, in particular among young people. This, in principle, offered the potentials for more pluralism in the news offer and variety, yet, such services have often offered low-quality information, gossip, copy-and-paste news and dependence on big firms for advertisements.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, despite these problems, Internet is beginning to host also alternative voices, independent and quality journalism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The re-opening of the Greek public broadcaster, the [[Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation|ERT SA]] in 2015, after a two-year closure, was considered a positive step towards pluralism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Media ownership concentration===
In Greece, the "levels of concentration of media ownership and cross-media concentration are high".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reinventing Public Service Communication: European Broadcasters and Beyond|last=Iosifidis|first=P.|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2010|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main reason for is lies in the diversification and deregulation process which led several newspaper groups to invest in electronic media. This happened in a poorly regulated media environment.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=BÁRD|first=Petra|last2=BAYER|first2=Judith|year=2016|title=A comparative analysis of media freedom and pluralism in the EU Member States. Study for the LIBE Committee|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2016/571376/IPOL_STU(2016)571376_EN.pdf|journal=Directorate-General for Internal Policies. Policy Department Citizens' Rights and Constitutional Affairs|publisher=European Parliament|volume=|pages=|access-date=24 March 2017|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As for the print sector, the three largest press groups - Lambrakis Press SA (DOL), Tegopoulos Publishing, and Pegasus SA (Bobolas family) - are also shareholders in the main terrestrial channel MEGA. Press Institution SA holds shares in terrestrial channel STAR, and the Alafouzos family owns terrestrial channel SKAI and several radio stations. The rise of the Internet has added a concentration problem as the highest-visited websites include those of the mainstream publishing groups like DOL, Pegasus and also MEGA chennel.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the last decade, the problem of media concentration worsened significantly.,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; as demonstrated by the following data: in 2008 the four leading publishing house controlled 69.7% of the market compared to 57.3% in 2000, 62.9% in 1995 and 59% in 1990.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The publishers of such outlets adopted a diversification strategy, leading to investment into other different sectors and industries.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=LEANDROS|first=NIKOS|year=2010|title=Media Concentration and Systemic Failures in Greece|url=http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/viewFile/795/464|journal=International Journal of Communication|volume=4|pages=|access-date=24 March 2017|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As for the broadcasting sector, after the deregulation process of the late 1980s, the number of private television stations increased significantly. However, despite the large number of media outlets, the media scene is dominated by five private channels (MEGA, Ant1, Alpha, Star and Alter) belonging to conglomerates with activities also in other sectors.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Concerning the regulation of media concentration, the relevant law, i.e. Law 2328/1995 did not prevent high levels of concentration, whereas the more recent Law 3592/2007 named "New Act on concentration and Licensing of Media Undertakings" provided more opportunities for deregulation and market liberalisation by abolishing some older regulations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A 2014 amendment to the above Law further relaxed ownership and cross-media ownership requirements by allowing partnerships between electronic media businesses of the same type (television, online, or radio) if this results in a cut of operating costs (through [[economies of scale]] or joint utilization of financial resources). This is an indicator of the government's intention to create large media conglomerates for economic viability.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Cross-ownership===

Another problem affecting the Greek media system is cross-ownership.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Anti-concentration rules and restrictions were never enforced. According to some experts, governments preferred to satisfy the interest of media owners aspiring to boost their position and power in the media communication landscape emerged after the dismissal of state monopoly, instead of regulating the system.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Furthermore, political instability in the years 1989-1990 created the conditions for media owners to exercise pressure on the government.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This led to the creation of a powerful oligopoly, constructed around a small number of media corporations owning national dailies, radio and TV stations, several magazines and publishing houses and involved also in the fields of new media, telecommunications and culture.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The problem of cross-ownership, as well as media concentration and instrumentalization of the media have become highly important in Greece to the point to dominate the public and political debate in the country.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Transparency of media ownership==

{{See also|Transparency of media ownership in Europe}}

Transparency of media ownership refers to the public availability of accurate, comprehensive and up-to-date information about media ownership structures. A legal regime guaranteeing transparency of media ownership makes possible for the public as well as for media authorities to find out who effectively owns, controls and influences the media as well as media influence on political parties or state bodies.

=== Legal framework ===
The [[Constitution of Greece|Greek Constitution]], under Article No. 14 (9), affirms the importance of transparency and pluralism in the media sector.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Evangelia Psychogiopoulou, dia Anagnostou, Anna Kandya |date= December 2011 |title= Does media policy promote media freedom and independence? The case of Greece. Case Study report |url= http://www.mediadem.eliamep.gr/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Greece.pdf |journal= Ellenic Foundation for European and Foreign Policy |access-date= 14 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the Constitution affirms that the law "may specify that the means of financing newspapers and periodicals should be disclosed" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Doina Costin, Mamuka Andguladze |date= 2012 |title= Transparency of media ownership in the Republic of Moldova |url=http://www.ijc.md/Publicatii/studii_mlu/transparenta%20media%20eng/studiu-transparenta-eng.pdf |publisher= Centrul pentru Jurnalism Independent; National Endowment for Democracy (NED) |access-date= 16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years a number of measures have been undertaken to increase transparency of the media. For instance, the [[Secretariat-General of Mass Media]], a governmental body, monitors the allocation of state subsidies and other support measures addressed to the media, including public sector advertising and press distribution and telecommunications subsidies. Specifically, the Secretariat makes public through its website:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://media.gov.gr/|title=Secretariat General of Mass Media|last=|first=|date=|website=media.gov.gr|access-date=April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; approved programs and accounts of the advertising expenditure of public bodies; data on procurement of all services related to the supply of goods and services; information on government grants to the press; names of staff employed at the Secretariat for each directorates and departments.&lt;ref name="OS"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Petros Iosifidis, Dimitris Boucas |date= 1 May 2015 |title=Media policy and independent journalism in Greece |url= https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/sites/default/files/media-policy-independent-journalism-greece-20150511.pdf |journal= Open Society Foundation |issue= Programme on Independent Journalism &amp; Open Society Foundations for Europe |access-date= 14 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, such information is not always comprehensive and updated.&lt;ref name="OS" /&gt;

As for electronic media, the broadcast regulator, namely the [[National Council on Radio and Television]] (NCRTV) makes public all radio and TV’s licenses through its website. The information published includes the name of the company, contact details, and the scope of the media outlet’s territorial coverage. However, a comprehensive legislative framework for transparency of online media has not been established yet.&lt;ref name="OS" /&gt; The regulator is also responsible for collecting and keeping records and shareholders information on media outlets and media-related enterprises, such as press agencies, advertising, etc. All these data are publicly available and accessible to the public.&lt;ref name="OS" /&gt;

Article 6 of the Presidential Decree 109/2010 which incorporated the EU [[Audio-visual Media Services Directive]] sets forth rules for enhancing transparency in the audiovisual sector by obliging providers to make public information such as company name, address, contact details, etc. Also, press enterprises are required to disclose the names of their owners, publisher and managers in their editions.&lt;ref name="OS" /&gt; In order to obtain the license to broadcast, radio and TV stations must submit to the NCRT a declaration on their shareholdings. Any transfer of ownership above 1% of the capital of a TV or radio station has to be notified to, and approved by, the NCRT. The role of owner, partner, main shareholder or management executive of a media outlet is not compatible with the role of owner, partner, main shareholder or management executive of an enterprise working for the public sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://monitor.cmpf.eui.eu/results-2014/greece/ |title= Media Pluralism Monitor. Country report: Greece  |date= June 2014 |website=monitor.cmpf.eui.eu|publisher=Centre for MEdia Pluralism and Media Freedom |access-date=14 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, there is no independent financial supervision of the public-service broadcasters.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2016/571376/IPOL_STU(2016)571376_EN.pdf|title=A comparative analysis of media freedom and pluralism in the EU Member States|last=BÁRD|first=Petra|last2=BAYER|first2=Judit|date=September 2016|website=europarl.europa.eu|publisher=Policy Department for Citizens' Rights and Constitutional Affairs, European Parliament|access-date=April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their financial status is problematic.

The principle of transparency in all areas of public life, including media, is expected to be enhanced given that there is an Action Plan Promoting Open Government since 2014 ([[Greek Action Plan 2014-16]]). Technical and institutional changes have been adopted to enhance the principle of transparency and these should lead to the enhancement of the functionality of the [[DIAVGEIA]] project (Transparency Program Initiative),&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://diavgeia.gov.gr/en|title=DIAVGEIA Project, Transparency Program Initiative|last=|first=|date=|website=diavgeia.gov.gr|access-date=April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the publication of public procurements and to the open, transparent and secure exchange of public documents. The DIAVGEIA project began on October 1, 2010. Under this Transparency Program Initiative, all government institutions are obliged to upload their acts and decisions on the Internet with special attention to issues of national security and sensitive personal data. Each document is digitally signed and assigned a unique Internet Uploading Number (IUN) certifying that the decision has been uploaded at the “Transparency Portal”. Following the latest legislative initiative (Law 4210/2013) of the Ministry of Administrative Reform and e-Governance, administrative acts and decisions are not valid unless published online.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Censorship and media freedom==

The Greek Constitution provides for [[freedom of speech]] and [[Freedom of the press|press]], under Article 14.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/quotes/constitution-of-greece-article-14-freedom-of-expression-and-of-the-press|title=Constitution of Greece, Article 14: Freedom of Expression and of the Press|last=|first=|date=|website=berkleycenter.georgetown.edu|publisher=Berkley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs|access-date=May 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Independent media are active and express a wide variety of views. The law permits any prosecutor to order the seizure of publications that insult the president, offend any religion, contain obscenity, advocate for the violent overthrow of the political system, or disclose military secrets. The law provides criminal penalties for [[defamation]], however, in most criminal defamation cases, authorities released defendants on bail pending trial and they served no time in jail. Both the Greek Constitution and Greek legislation prohibit arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, or correspondence. However, NGOs such as the [[Greek Helsinki Monitor]] report that authorities do not always respect these provisions in practice.&lt;ref name=USDOS-CRHRP-Greece-2012/&gt;

[[Press freedom]] sharply eroded in Greece during the economic and financial crisis of 2010-2015, passing from the 35th place in 2009 in [[Reporters Without Borders]]  [[Press Freedom Index|World Press Freedom Index]] to the 99th place in 2014, well below all [[Western Balkans]] countries as well as states with repressive media policies such as [[Gabon]], [[Kuwait]] or [[Liberia]].&lt;ref name=euroscope/&gt;  Greece is ranked in the 88th place in the 2017 World Press Freedom Index of Reporters Without Borders. Greece is today the [[EU member state]] "where journalism and the media face their most acute crisis".&lt;ref name=OSF/&gt;

The crisis has laid bare the unsustainability of Greek media, and the dependence of media owners on state support in terms of tax breaks and public advertisement revenues, and reciprocating by publishing favourable stories, in a [[self-censorship]] mode. When public funds dried up, media went bankrupt, while the government resorted to more open tactics of [[media manipulation]] via coercion, censorship, and shutdowns. Lack of job security for journalists have driven them to self-censorship too, limiting themselves to stories understood to be acceptable to owners and politicians.&lt;ref name=euroscope/&gt;

=== Legal framework ===
Defamation, insult and slander are criminalized in Greece, respectively under Articles 361-364 of the Greek Criminal Code.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.c00.org/p/greek-penal-code.html|title=Greek Penal Code|last=|first=|date=|website=c00.org|language=Greek|access-date=May 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, defamation of a corporation is provided by the latter provision.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://legaldb.freemedia.at/legal-database/greece/|title=Media Laws Database- Greece|last=|first=|date=|website=legaldb.freemedia.at|publisher=International Press Institute|access-date=May 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prosecutions under these provisions can only be initiated upon complaint, but may be conducted [[Ex-Officio|ex officio]] when the offended party is a public official.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Defaming the Head of the State is a crime under art. No. 168 of the Criminal Code; moreover, the Constitution permits seizures of publications offending the Head of the State. Malicious [[blasphemy]] is a criminal offence under Art. 198 of the Criminal Code, as well as publicly reviling the Eastern Orthodox Church of Christ or any other religion tolerated in Greece (Article No. 199). The Greek Constitution allows the seizure of publications insulting religions, too.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

On December 22, 2015, the Press Law was amended, specifically the so-called “press killer” provisions regarding civil defamation.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcmediafreedom.eu/Publications/Reports/Greece-Press-Freedom-and-Defamation-Laws-in-a-Time-of-Crisis|title=Greece: Press Freedom and Defamation Laws in a Time of Crisis|last=Polymenopoulou|first=Eleni|last2=Griffen|first2=Scott|date=October 2015|website=|publisher=South East Europe Media Organisation|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, such provisions led, among other things,  to non-proportionate fees against media outlets &lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ipi.media/greece-passes-bill-aiming-to-combat-abuse-of-defamation-law-against-journalists/|title=Greece passes bill aiming to combat abuse of defamation law against journalists|last=|first=|date=January 5, 2016|website=ipi.media|publisher=International Press Institute|access-date=May 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to a consequent climate of self- censorship. The president of the [[Panhellenic Federation of Journalists' Unions|Panhellenic Federation of Journalists’ Unions]] (POESY) noticed that “huge amounts that the plaintiffs were asking from the journalists were aiming to terrorise them, impose censorship and hinder a free and democratic dialogue on contemporary political issues”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ipi.media/in-depth-greek-defamation-reforms-only-first-step-toward-greater-press-freedom/|title=In Depth: Greek libel reforms only first step toward greater press freedom|last=Papadopoulou|first=Lambrini|date=March 30, 2017|website=ipi.media|access-date=May 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attacks and threats against journalists===
In the last years several instances have been reported in which either extremists or security forces have attacked journalist while they were covering newsworthy events. Impunity is too often the norm.&lt;ref name=FH/&gt; The inappropriate use of violence by police forces against journalists has been attributed both to a strategy of silencing and to the lack of competence of police about how to deal with city riots.&lt;ref name=euroscope/&gt;
According to the [[Hellenic Photojournalists' Union]] (EFE), only 1 out of 16 incidents of police attacks against photojournalists between 2010 and 2014 resulted in legal consequences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.balcanicaucaso.org/eng/Media-Freedom/New-report-highlights-impunity-for-police-violence-against-Greek-photojournalists New report highlights impunity for police violence against Greek photojournalists], [[Osservatorio Balcani e Caucaso]], 25 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In a 2016 statement, reporters Without Borders condemned impunity for police violence against journalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rsf.org/en/news/rwb-condemns-impunity-police-violence-against-journalists|title=RWB condemns impunity for police violence against journalists|last=|first=|date=January 20, 2016|website=rsf.org|publisher=Reporters Without Borders|access-date=May 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political interferences===
Political interferences in the media sphere in Greece often happen through judicial ruling, themselves deemed to be politically motivated or influenced. In May 2014 the [[Council of State (Greece)|Council of State]] declared the constitutionality of ERT 2013 closure, notwithstanding procedural irregularities. Lower courts' rulings invalidating dismissals were not enforced by the government in 2014.&lt;ref name=FH/&gt;

Political influence in the Greek media has been on the rise in 2014. The set-up of ERT's successor, [[NERIT]], was marked by scandals and irregularities, including the undue involvement of the Ministr of State. An August 2014 law stripped NERIT of its administrative independence and entrusted the government with the power to name its supervisory body, which in turn selects the public broadcaster's president. This was deprecated by the [[European Broadcasting Union]], resulting in complications in NERIT's membership application.&lt;ref name=FH/&gt;

[[NERIT]] has been accused repeatedly of political bias, including after blocking the airing of Syriza opposition leader [[Alexis Tsipras]] at the [[Thessaloniki International Fair]], while giving ample space to [[Antonis Samaras]]' campaign. Several NERIT officials later resigned, citing widespread governmental interference. Hiring scandals and preferential legal treatment from the authorities complete the framework.&lt;ref name=FH/&gt;

Audience shares of NERIT never approached those of ERT, being limited to 5% of viewers. According to former ERT employee Nicos Tsibidas, this left Greece with "a stern state broadcaster", controlled by the government, and "private media oligarchs".&lt;ref name=euroscope/&gt;

Private channels also presented partisan bias, particularly pro-governmental. [[ANT1 TV]] featured reports warning citizens about the negative consequences of not voting for the governmental coalition.&lt;ref name=FH/&gt;

* In February 2014 a court attempted to prevent Mega TV from airing information about a shipwreck in [[Farmakonisi]] leading to the death of uncounted migrants, officially to preserve the integrity of ongoing investigations.&lt;ref name=FH/&gt;
* In April 2014, the government was reported to have intervened to change the words from an [[Athens News Agency]] wire about [[Angela Merkel]]'s visit, replacing the term "austerity measures" with "consolidation measures".&lt;ref name=FH/&gt;
* On 30 August 2016, the Greek Government launched an auction for four of the eight private national television broadcasting licenses. Such auction came together with a recent law which reduces to four the number of national television licenses issued to private broadcasters. The auction was to lead to the closure of the relevant four televisions, including some of the largest television operators in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcmediafreedom.eu/Publications/Reports/Attacks-against-journalists-and-media-freedom-in-Europe|title=Attacks against journalists and media freedom in Europe|last=|first=|date=January 2017|website=rcmediafreedom.eu|publisher=Council of Europe|access-date=May 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcmediafreedom.eu/Multimedia/Video/The-Greek-TV-Licencing-Series-Story-Explained|title=The Greek TV Licencing Series Story Explained|last=|first=|date=October 10, 2016|website=rcmediafreedom.eu|publisher=Athens Live|access-date=May 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such process that was soon afterwards deemed unconstitutional by the Greek High Court.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

The Court found that the journalists’ conviction did not meet any “pressing social need” and there were not relevant and sufficient reasons to justify the applicants’ conviction to pay civil damages for insult and defamation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://globalfreedomofexpression.columbia.edu/cases/koutsoliontos-v-greece/|title=Koutsoliontos v.

Such surveillance would be, according to Sanidas's mandate, completely legal. Following this proclamation, Greek bloggers, legal experts and notable personalities from the media have claimed that Sanidas's mandate contravenes both the Greek constitution and current EU laws regarding the privacy of Internet communications. Furthermore, this mandate has been greatly criticised as being a first step towards full censorship of all Internet content.&lt;ref&gt;* [http://www.ethnos.gr/article.asp?catid=11424&amp;subid=2&amp;tag=8777&amp;pubid=4356891 "Σπάει το απόρρητο των επικοινωνιών στο Ιντερνετ" {{gr icon}}] ([https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ethnos.gr%2Farticle.asp%3Fcatid%3D22768%26subid%3D2%26pubid%3D4356891%26tag%3D8777&amp;sandbox=1 "Breaks the confidentiality of communications on the Internet" {{en icon}}]), Alexander Avlonitis, ΕΘΝΟΣ.gr, Nation Publishing SA, 30 June 2009.

{{good article}}
The music for the ''[[Drakengard (series)|Drakengard]]'' series, known as {{nihongo|''Drag-On Dragoon''|ドラッグ オン ドラグーン|Doraggu on doragūn|commonly abbreviated as ''DOD''|lead=no}} in Japan, has been handled by multiple composers since the release of the [[Drakengard|original game]] in 2004. ''Drakengard''{{'}}s composers were [[Nobuyoshi Sano]] and Takayuki Aihara, ''[[Drakengard 2]]'' was handled by Ryoki Matsumoto and Aoi Yoshiki, and ''[[Drakengard 3]]'' was composed for by Keiichi Okabe, the composer for series spin-off ''[[Nier (video game)|Nier]]''. Sano remained as a sound director for the second game, and his music was used as a reference for the third. Multiple albums have been released for the music of the series: ''Drag-On Dragoon Original Soundtrack Vol.1'' and ''Vol.2'' were released on October and November 2004, while a two-disc re-release titled ''Drag-On Dragoon Original Soundtrack'' was released in April 2011. The ''Drag-On Dragoon 2 Original Soundtrack'' was released on July 20, 2005. A promotional disc with two tracks from the soundtrack was released in the same year. The official soundtrack for the third game, ''Drag-On Dragoon 3 Original Soundtrack'', was released January 21, 2014. An compilation of [[chiptune]] remixes of the previous games and ''Nier'', ''Drag-On Dragoon Chips Music'', was released on December 19, 2013 as part of the ''Drag-On Dragoon 10 Anniversary Box''.

The series has also received theme songs from multiple Japanese pop artists, all of which have been released as singles. A re-orchestration of [[Mika Nakashima]]'s single "Hitori" was used as the theme for ''Drakengard 2'', incorporating elements from the game. Two theme songs were written for ''Drakengard 3'': "Kuroi Uta" and "This Silence is Mine". The former was sung by [[Eir Aoi]], a fan of the series, and written by ''Nier'' writer Kikuchi Hana. The latter was specially written and sung by [[Onitsuka Chihiro]], who created the song around the themes and characters of the game. Both songs were composed by Okabe. All three singles have been in the top 40 best-selling singles in the Japanese [[Oricon]] music charts.

The soundtracks have received mixed to positive reviews from both dedicated video game music outlets and video game critics. The first game was noted for its disturbing style, which both drew criticism for repetitiveness and praise for suiting the game's atmosphere. It has been generally cited as an experimental soundtrack. The second game's soundtrack received a more positive reception, with the general opinion being that it was a more traditional and consequently more comfortable soundtrack. The third game's soundtrack also received fairly positive comments, mainly praising its quality, although critiques were made concerning its variety. The chiptune compilation was generally liked, except for its exclusivity to the special release. The singles have also received praise.

==Creation and influence==
The music of the [[Drakengard|first game]] in the [[Drakengard (series)|''Drakengard'' series]] was composed by [[Nobuyoshi Sano]] and Takayuki Aihara. In creating the score, they sampled excerpts from pieces of classical music (selected by Aihara), then rearranged, remixed and layered them in various ways. Their main objective was to create music that emulated the game's hack-and-slash gameplay, as well as the dark story and general narrative theme of "madness". The music was intended to be "experimental" and "expressionistic" rather than "commercial". After being composed, all the tracks were performed by a full orchestra.&lt;ref name= "SEmusicLiners"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.squareenixmusic.com/features/liners/drakengard.shtml|title=Drag-on Dragoon Original Soundtrack :: Liner Notes Translated by Ben Schweitzer|author=Schweitzer, Ben|publisher=Square Enix Music Online|accessdate=2014-02-15|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222144620/http://www.squareenixmusic.com/features/liners/drakengard.shtml|archivedate=2014-02-22|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team who worked on the music also worked on the ''[[Tekken]]'' series, and they sought to emulate the music of [[Northern Europe]].&lt;ref name="IGN1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2003/05/22/drakengard-interview?page=1| title=Drakengard Interview  | accessdate=2013-08-24 | author=Dunham, Jeremy | date=2003-05-23| publisher=[[IGN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the soundtracks that inspired Sano and Aihara in their work was the score for ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]''.&lt;ref name= "GWexorcist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://game.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/20031110/dod.htm|script-title=ja:「ドラッグ オン ドラグーン」サウンドクリエイター インタビュー|language=Japanese|publisher=Game Watch|date=2003-11-10|accessdate=2014-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theme song, {{nihongo|"Exhausted"|尽きる|Tsukiru}}, was composed by Sano, written by the game's scenario writer Sawako Natori and sung by [[Eriko Hatsune]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.squareenixmusic.com/lyrics/drakengard/exhausted.shtml|title=Square Enix Music Online :: Drakengard - Exhausted|publisher=Square Enix Music Online|accessdate=2014-03-01|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301164247/http://www.squareenixmusic.com/lyrics/drakengard/exhausted.shtml|archivedate=2014-03-01|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shiba wanted a composer less linked to video games to compose the music: Matsumoto was brought in because of his work on the non-video-game [[J-pop]] songs "[[Yuki no Hana]]" and "Tsuki no Shizuku". Because of the size of the project, Matsumoto in turn brought in his friend Yoshiki to help.&lt;ref name= "SEmusicLiners2"/&gt; The soundtrack was designed a fusion of J-pop and video game music, and to evoke the emotions of the various characters and the feeling of battle.&lt;ref name= "DengMusic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dengekionline.com/data/news/2005/7/8/82cf6ea966daf55a023c7a6a3c474d80.html|script-title=ja:“融合”をテーマにした『ドラッグオンドラグーン2』のサウンドトラックが7月20日発売|language=Japanese|publisher=[[ASCII Media Works|Dengeki Online]]|date=2005-07-08|accessdate=2014-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theme song for the game's English release was "Growing Wings", a localized version of the first game's theme song sung by [[Kari Wahlgren]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.squareenixmusic.com/lyrics/drakengard/growingwings.shtml|title=Square Enix Music Online :: Drakengard 2 - Growing Wings|publisher=Square Enix Music Online|accessdate=2014-03-01|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301151216/http://www.squareenixmusic.com/lyrics/drakengard/growingwings.shtml|archivedate=2014-03-01|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Drakengard 3|The third game]]'s music was composed by Keiichi Okabe, who also created the [[Music of Nier|score for ''Nier'']], a spin-off game of the series. While writing the music, Okabe felt he needed to match Sano's work on ''Drakengard'', rather than copy it, and so felt that there was no need to "rehash" the original music despite the potential merits. He commented that the musical creation was "a tough production, but for this game, there's part of it I'm doing that I've never experienced before."&lt;ref name="DG3music"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/7/17/4530966/abot-drakengard-3-and-making-the-music-for-a-very-strange-game|title=Drakengard 3 will not 'feel much like a Square Enix' release, if music department has its way|author=Gifford, Kevin|publisher=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=2013-07-17|accessdate=2013-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; At director [[Taro Yoko]]'s request, Okabe worked on separating the style of the music from that of ''[[Nier (video game)|Nier]]'': he did this by including both soft, gentle tunes similar to ''Nier'' and more intense tracks. The two styles were also inspired by the game's world theme of "the sense of contrast".&lt;ref name="DOD3okabe"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.siliconera.com/2014/05/06/drakengard-3-sound-director-music-different-niers/ |title=Drakengard 3 Sound Director On How The Music Is Different From Nier's |author=Ishaan |publisher=Siliconera |accessdate=2014-05-08 |date=2014-05-06 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508100605/http://www.siliconera.com/2014/05/06/drakengard-3-sound-director-music-different-niers/ |archivedate=2014-05-08 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; One musical piece, "Exhausted 3", is a re-orchestration of ''Drakengard''{{'}}s theme song, intended by Okabe as a nod to earlier installments while staying true to Yoko's wishes.&lt;ref name= "ObakeFamitsu"/&gt;

The reviewer for ''RPGFan'' was weakly positive about the first album, calling it "extremely experimental" and stating that people needed to be open-minded while listening, while also citing it as better than the soundtrack for ''[[Xenosaga Episode I: Der Wille zur Macht]]''.&lt;ref name=RPGFAN1&gt;{{cite web | title=Drag-on Dragoon OST Vol. 1 | url = http://www.rpgfan.com/soundtracks/drag-on1/index.html |publisher=RPGFan | author=Dragon God | accessdate=2008-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reviewer echoed most of these sentiments for the second album, while also stating that it contained the better musical pieces from the game of the two albums.&lt;ref name=RPGFAN2&gt;{{cite web | title=Drag-on Dragoon OST Vol. 2 | url = http://www.rpgfan.com/soundtracks/drag-on2/index.html |publisher=RPGFan | author=Dragon God | accessdate=2008-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luc Nadeau of ''Game Music Online'', who reviewed all three releases of the soundtrack, was mixed to positive in his opinions. He generally liked the music, but noted, like the ''RPGFan'' reviewer, that it was highly experimental and would not be to everyone's taste. He also cited his preference for the 2011 two-disc re-release over the original albums.&lt;ref name= "DODvol1Rev"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vgmonline.net/drakengardvol1/|title=Drakengard Original Soundtrack Vol. 1|author=Nadeau, Luc|publisher=Game Music Online|date=2011-08-20|accessdate=2014-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "DODvol2Rev"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vgmonline.net/drakengardvol2/|title=Drakengard Original Soundtrack Vol. 2|author=Nadeau, Luc|publisher=Game Music Online|date=2011-08-20|accessdate=2014-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "DODcompleteRev"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vgmonline.net/drakengard/|title=Drakengard Original Soundtrack|author=Nadeau, Luc|publisher=Game Music Online|date=2011-08-20|accessdate=2014-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewing the re-release, Jayson Napolitano of ''Original Sound Version'' called it "one of the most experimental and disturbing soundtracks I've heard in a while". He praised the soundtrack despite not finding it memorable, and commented that he found it more appealing when he knew some of the plot details that were censored in the game's western release.&lt;ref name= "OSVreview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.originalsoundversion.com/a-disturbing-experiment-the-drag-on-dragoon-dual-disc-reprint-review/|title=A Disturbing Experiment: The Drag-On Dragoon Dual-Disc Reprint (Review)|author=Napolitano, Jayson|publisher=Original Sound Version|date=2014-05-09|accessdate=2014-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewers of the game itself also noted the soundtrack. Greg Kasavin of ''[[GameSpot]]'' mentioned it as the most distinctive aspect of the game, stating that it was "the most nerve-racking and most intense aspect of [''Drakengard'']".&lt;ref name= "GSdg1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/drakengard-review/1900-6089873/|title=Drakengard Review|author=Kasavin, Greg|publisher=[[GameSpot]] |date=2004-02-23 |accessdate=2013-11-14 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140326064920/http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/drakengard-review/1900-6089873/|archivedate=2014-03-26|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adam Jarvis of ''VideoGamer.com'' was also positive, calling the soundtrack "haunting" and saying that it "helps create a suitably dark atmosphere".&lt;ref name= "VGdg1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.videogamer.com/ps2/drakengard/review.html|title=Drakengard Review|author=Jarvis, Adam|publisher=VideoGamer.com|date=2004-08-20|accessdate=2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[IGN]]''{{'}}s Jeremy Dunham was both impressed by the atmosphere of the tracks and critical of multiple instances of grueling repetition, summing the music up as "disappointing".&lt;ref name= "IGNdg1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2004/02/13/drakengard-3|title=Drakengard Review|author=Dunham, Jeremy|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=2004-02-13|accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike ''Drakengard'', ''Drakengard 2'' has only had one soundtrack album released. ''Drag-On Dragoon 2 Original Soundtrack'' was released on July 20, 2005 under the catalog number ''AICL-1628''. It consists of 22 tracks lasting 1:13:03.&lt;ref name= "OSTdod2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.game-ost.com/albums/15689/drag-on_dragoon_2_original_soundtrack/|title=Drag-on Dragoon 2 Original Soundtrack|publisher=Game-OST |author=Smith, Simon|accessdate=2014-09-24|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140806003303/http://game-ost.com/albums/15689/drag-on_dragoon_2_original_soundtrack/|archivedate=2014-08-06|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; It contains the tracks used during gameplay and not those used during cutscenes, but does include the game's theme song, "[[Hitori (Mika Nakashima song)|Hitori]]", which was also released as a separate [[Single (music)|single]].&lt;ref name= "VGMOdod2"/&gt; Two tracks from the game were released as a promotional CD for the game, both as a limited giveaway and part of press kits. It included concept art, interviews, and trailers.&lt;ref name= "OSTdod2sample"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.game-ost.com/albums/44879/drag-on_dragoon_2_web_material/|title=Drag-on Dragoon 2 Web Material|publisher=Game-OST|accessdate=2014-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The album has received very positive reviews. Chris Greening of ''Game Music Online'' praised the shift to a more classical style and the general intensity of multiple tracks, ending the review by applauding Yoshiki's hard work.&lt;ref name= "VGMOdod2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vgmonline.net/drakengard2/|title=Drakengard 2 Original Soundtrack|author=Greening, Chris|publisher=Game Music Online|date=2005-07-20|accessdate=2014-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mike Wilson, writing for ''RPGFan'', echoed many of these sentiments despite thinking that there were too few tracks on the album, giving the soundtrack ten out of ten.&lt;ref name= "RPGFdod2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rpgfan.com/soundtracks/drag-on-2/index.html|title=Drag-on Dragoon 2 OST|author=Wilson, Mike|publisher=RPGFan|accessdate=2014-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both reviewers stated that it was an easier listening experience than the soundtrack for the first ''Drag-on Dragoon'' game.&lt;ref name= "RPGFdod2"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "VGMOdod2"/&gt; ''Game-OST''{{'}}s Simon Smith also praised it, calling the soundtrack "a complete attack on the senses as an entire orchestra and full sized choir rampage as much power and tension on you as possible."&lt;ref name= "OSTdod2"/&gt;

Outside soundtrack reviews, opinions from reviews of the game itself have also been positive. ''IGN''{{'}}s Ed Lewis called the music "appropriately dramatic", though stated it was often drowned out by the ambient noise and voice acting.&lt;ref name= "IGNdg2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2006/02/16/drakengard-2|title=Drakengard 2|author=Lewis, Ed|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=2006-02-16|accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''GameSpot''{{'}}s Greg Mueller called the music "varied and interesting", while stating that the vocal theme was "sappy, but it's used sparingly enough, so it doesn't get terribly annoying".&lt;ref name= "GSdg2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/drakengard-2-review/1900-6144299/|title=Drakengard 2 review|author=Mueller, Greg|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|date=2006-02-14|accessdate=2013-11-14|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140215220951/http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/drakengard-2-review/1900-6144299/|archivedate=2014-02-15|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[GameTrailers]]'' reviewer cited the score as "top-notch", referring to it as one of the few well-done aspects of the game.&lt;ref name= "GTdg2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gametrailers.com/reviews/uh7rrc/drakengard-2--review|title=Drakengard 2 review|author=|publisher=[[GameTrailers]]|date=2006-07-06|accessdate=2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the second game, there has only been one soundtrack album release for ''Drakengard 3''. ''Drag-on Dragoon 3 Original Soundtrack'' was released on January 21, 2014 under the catalog number ''SQEX-10414~5''. The game's two theme songs were released both as part of the soundtrack and as singles.&lt;ref name= "VGMdod3ost"/&gt;

Christopher Huynh of ''Game Music Online'' generally praised the soundtrack's quality, but felt there was too little variety.&lt;ref name= "VGMdod3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vgmonline.net/drakengard3/|title=Drakengard 3 Original Soundtrack|author=Huynh, Christopher|publisher=Game Music Online|date=2014-05-21|accessdate=2014-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''RPGFan''{{'}}s Patrick Gann was generally positive, although he had little commentary on individual tracks, and recommended the album to people who had enjoyed the soundtrack of ''Nier''.&lt;ref name= "RPGFdod3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rpgfan.com/soundtracks/drag-on-3/|title=Drag-on Dragoon 3 OST|author=Gann, Patrick |publisher=RPGFan|date=2014-10-04 |accessdate=2014-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album reached #18 in the Oricon charts and remained in the charts for four weeks.&lt;ref name="ORIdod3"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.oricon.co.jp/prof/artist/67810/products/music/1056182/1/| publisher = [[Oricon]]| script-title=ja:Ｄｒａｇ－Ｏｎ　Ｄｒａｇｏｏｎ　３　Ｏｒｉｇｉｎａｌ　Ｓｏｕｎｄｔｒａｃｋ |language = Japanese | accessdate=2014-09-30 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140930191235/http://www.oricon.co.jp/prof/artist/67810/products/music/1056182/1/ |archivedate=2014-09-30 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewers of the game have also praised the soundtrack. ''USGamer''{{'}}s Kat Bailey was fairly positive about it despite not finding it very memorable, calling it "aggressively anime, mixing piano riffs with the odd bit of J-Pop for emphasis".&lt;ref name= "USGreview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usgamer.net/articles/drakengard-3-review-the-gods-must-be-crazy|title=Drakengard 3 PS3 Review: The Gods Must Be Crazy|author=Bailey, Kat|publisher=USGamer|date=2014-05-20|accessdate=2014-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chris Carter of ''[[Destructoid]]'' called the music "stupendous, and one of the best JRPG soundtracks I've heard in a long while."&lt;ref name="DesReview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.destructoid.com/review-drakengard-3-274631.phtml|title=Review: Drakengard 3|author=Carter, Chris|publisher=[[Destructoid]]|date=2014-05-20|accessdate=2014-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Barker, writing an analysis of the game for ''RPGFan'', called the music "the backbone" of ''Drakengard 3''. He also cited the music as being "universally praised" by critics.&lt;ref name= "RPGfanAna"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rpgfan.com/news/2014/1854.html|title=Of Blood and Song – An Analysis of Drakengard 3|author=Barker, Andrew|publisher=RPGFan|date=2014-08-08|accessdate=2014-11-08|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022045319/http://www.rpgfan.com/news/2014/1854.html|archivedate=2014-10-22|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the soundtrack albums, a single compilation of music from across the series has been produced. ''Drag-On Dragoon Chips Music'' was released on December 19, 2013 under the catalog number ''TGCS-7750''. The release consists of a selection of tracks from ''Drakengard'' (Sano, Aihara), ''Drakengard 2'' (Aoi, Matsumoto) and ''Nier'' (Okabe) remixed as [[chiptune]]s. Also included is a version of "Exhausted" by Sano for the piano, used as background music for ''Drakengard 3''{{'}}s Japanese website.&lt;ref name= "RPGchips"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "VGMchips"/&gt; The compilation was exclusively released as part of the ''Drag-On Dragoon 10th Anniversary Box'', featuring a copy of ''Drakengard 3'' and multiple books and artwork relating to the series. The music was accompanied by images representative of scenes from the game where the selected music plays.&lt;ref name= "DengChips"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dengekionline.com/elem/000/000/758/758304/|script-title=ja:『ドラッグ オン ドラグーン3』10周年記念ボックスが追加受注開始。『DOD』『ニーア』ファン必携の限定版を手に入れるラストチャンス|language=Japanese|publisher=[[ASCII Media Works|Dengeki Online]]|date=2013-11-25|accessdate=2014-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The compilation received mixed to positive opinions from music reviewers.

"This Silence Is Mine", the game's second theme song, was specially written and sung by [[Onitsuka Chihiro]]. It was composed by Okabe. Okabe asked Chihiro to help with the song because he felt she would be the perfect singer to project the world and themes of ''Drakengard 3''. The intention was to make the song emotionally intense, but at the same time "cold" and "empty". While writing the song, Chihiro was inspired by Zero's presentation within the game. The original draft of the song was created in around five minutes, and Chihiro had to sing the song five times before Okabe was satisfied with her performance.&lt;ref name= "DengChihiro"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dengekionline.com/elem/000/000/741/741531/|script-title=ja:ドラッグ オン ドラグーン3』鬼束ちひろさんインタビュー。歌詞や曲に込めた想い＆『ニーア』の岡部さんと作る新たな世界とは？【電撃DOD3】|language=Japanese|publisher=[[ASCII Media Works|Dengeki Online]]|date=2013-09-24|accessdate=2014-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song debuted in the game's trailer at the 2013 [[Tokyo Game Show]].&lt;ref name= "TGStrailerDengeki"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dengekionline.com/elem/000/000/719/719038/|script-title=ja:『ドラッグ オン ドラグーン3』テーマ曲『This Silence Is Mine』は鬼束ちひろさんが担当。最新PVは血まみれのファイブなど意味深な場面が連続|trans-title=Onitsuka Chihiro is in charge of "Drag-On Dragoon 3" theme song "This Silence Is Mine".

The film had its world premiere on September 5, 2013, at the [[2013 Toronto International Film Festival]] (TIFF) and received a [[Wide release|wide theatrical release]] on April 11, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marketwatch.com/story/wwe-studios-relativity-and-blumhouse-productions-partner-on-intrepid-pictures-oculus-2014-01-18 WWE® Studios, Relativity and Blumhouse Productions Partner on Intrepid Pictures' ''Oculus'']. Marketwatch.com.&lt;/ref&gt; It received generally positive reviews from critics,&lt;ref name="MC" /&gt; and was a box office success.&lt;ref name="Oculus 2014" /&gt;

==Plot==
The film takes place in two different times: the present and 11 years earlier. The two plot lines are told in parallel through [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]]. In 2002, software engineer Alan Russell moves into a new house with his wife Marie, 10-year-old son Tim, and 12-year-old daughter Kaylie. Alan purchases an antique mirror to decorate his office. Unbeknownst to them, the mirror supernaturally induces hallucinations. Marie is haunted by visions of her own body decaying, while Alan is seduced by a ghostly woman named Marisol, who has mirrors in place of eyes.

Over time, the parents become psychotic; Alan isolates himself in his office, and Marie becomes withdrawn and paranoid. All of the plants in the house die, and the family dog disappears after being shut in the office with the mirror. After Kaylie sees Alan with Marisol, she tells her mother, and the parents fight. One night, Marie goes insane and attempts to kill her children, but Alan locks her away. When the family runs out of food, the children realize that their father is under the influence of the mirror, so Kaylie goes to seek help from their mother, and finds her chained to the wall, acting like an animal. Kaylie and Tim try going to their neighbors for help, but the neighbors disbelieve their stories. When Kaylie attempts to use the phone, she discovers that all of her phone calls are answered by the same man.

One night, Alan unchains Marie, and both parents attack the children. Marie briefly comes to her senses, only to be shot dead by Alan. The children try to destroy the mirror but it tricks them, making them believe they are hitting the mirror when they are actually hitting the wall. Alan also experiences a moment of lucidity and kills himself by forcing Tim to pull the trigger of the gun and shoot him. Before dying, he begs the children to run, but Marisol and other victims of the mirror appear as horrific ghosts. The police arrive and take Tim into custody. Before the siblings are separated, they promise to reunite as adults and destroy the mirror. As Tim is taken away, he sees the ghosts of his parents watching him from the house.

Eleven years later, Tim is discharged from a psychiatric hospital, having come to believe that there were no supernatural events involved in his parents' deaths. Kaylie has spent most of her young adulthood researching the history of the mirror. Using her position as an employee of an auction house, she obtains access to the mirror and has it transported to the family home, where she places it in a room filled with surveillance cameras and a "kill switch" — an anchor weighted to the ceiling. Kaylie intends to destroy the mirror, but first wants to document its powers, proving Tim's innocence.

Tim attempts to convince Kaylie that she's wrong and the siblings argue. When they notice the houseplants begin to wilt, they review the camera footage and see themselves performing actions they have no memory of. Tim finally accepts that the mirror has an evil power and attempts to escape the house with Kaylie, only for the pair to be drawn back by the mirror's influence. Seeing a hallucination of her mother, Kaylie stabs it in the neck, only to realize that she has stabbed her fiancé. They try to call the police, but are only able to reach the same voice who spoke to them on the phone as children. Tim activates the kill switch, realizing too late that Kaylie stood in its path, and he has killed her. The police arrive and arrest Tim, who is hysterical, just as they did when he was younger. As both a boy and an adult, Tim claims the mirror is responsible. As he is taken away, Tim's adult incarnation sees Kaylie's ghost standing in the house with his parents.

==Production==
The film is based on Flanagan's earlier 2005 short horror film, also called ''Oculus''. The short contained only one setting, a single actor, and a mirror.&lt;ref name=moviesonline.ca&gt;{{cite web|title=Director Mike Flanagan Interview,Oculus|url=http://www.moviesonline.ca/2014/04/director-mike-flanagan-interview-oculus/|website=moviesonline.ca|accessdate=Aug 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The short became highly acclaimed, and interest quickly arose regarding the adaptation of the short into a feature.&lt;ref name=moviesonline.ca/&gt; Initially, studios were interested in making the film in accordance with the [[Found footage (pseudo-documentary)|found footage]] genre;&lt;ref name=Denofgeek&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kaye|first1=Don|title=Interview: Oculus director Mike Flanagan|url=http://www.denofgeek.us/movies/oculus/234666/interview-oculus-director-mike-flanagan|website=Den of Geek|accessdate=August 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, Flanagan was opposed to this and passed on such offers.&lt;ref name=Denofgeek/&gt; Eventually, Intrepid Pictures expressed interest in producing the film "as long as you don't do it found footage".

Expanding the premise to a feature-length screenplay proved challenging, as Flanagan felt like he had "pushed the limit" of what could be done with the premise in the short. The solution Flanagan came across was to combine two storylines, past and present, intercut with one another. The idea was to "create a sense of distortion and disorientation that would be similar for the viewer as it was for Tim and Kaylie in the room."&lt;ref name=moviesonline.ca/&gt; In early drafts, it was difficult to distinguish between the two timelines, until the team hit upon the idea of writing all of the scenes from the past in [[italics]].&lt;ref name=moviesonline.ca/&gt;

Inspired by the stories of [[H. P. Lovecraft]], Flanagan chose to not explain the mirror's origins, describing to Den of Geek that he liked how [[Lovecraftian horror|Lovecraftian]] literature often seemed to be an "alien force that if you even were to try to comprehend it completely it would drive you mad."&lt;ref name=Denofgeek/&gt; He expanded: "Evil in the world doesn't have an answer."&lt;ref name=Denofgeek/&gt;

On October 27, 2012, filming wrapped in [[Fairhope, Alabama]], after three weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title={{-'}}Oculus', starring Katee Sackhoff &amp; Karen Gillan, filming underway in Alabama |url=http://www.onlocationvacations.com/2012/10/24/oculus-starring-katee-sackhoff-karen-gillan-filming-underway-in-alabama/ |accessdate=17 February 2014 |publisher=On Location Vacations |date=24 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6470">'''Raise the Roof''' is a Broadway producing entity. It is composed of the producers [[Harriet Leve]], Jennifer Isaacson, and the members of [[WalkRunFly Productions]]: [[Brandon Victor Dixon]] and Warren Adams.

The group was founded by Jean Doumanian, Elaine Krauss, [[Harriet Leve]], and Jennifer Isaacson. Their first venture together was ''Burn the Floor'' as Raise the Roof 1. Next, Krauss, Leve, and Manocherian came together as Raise the Roof 2 to produce the recent Broadway production of ''[[Superior Donuts]]'' by [[Tracy Letts]], the [[Pulitzer Prize]] winning playwright of ''[[August: Osage County]]''. Doumanian was a lead producer on that production. In 2010, the group, as Raise the Roof 3, produced the Tony nominee for Best Revival, ''[[A Little Night Music]]'', starring [[Catherine Zeta Jones]] (who won a Tony for this performance) and [[Angela Lansbury]] (who was nominated for a Tony for this performance). On July 13, 2010, Broadway legends [[Bernadette Peters]] and [[Elaine Stritch]] joined the cast and assumed those roles. They were also represented, as Raise the Roof 4, by the Tony Award winning Best Revival of ''[[La Cage aux Folles (musical)|La Cage Aux Folles]]'', starring [[Kelsey Grammer]] (who was nominated for a Tony for this performance) and [[Douglas Hodge]] (who won a Tony for this performance).

With more than 13,000 islands and warm water all year, [[Indonesia]] is considered an idyllic destination for [[surfing]].&lt;ref name="Find the best surf spots"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wannasurf.com/spot/Asia/Indonesia/|title=Find the best surf spots|publisher=WannaSurf|accessdate=2014-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of surfing in Indonesia==
The first surfer in Indonesia was the American Bob Koke who surfed the waves at Kuta Beach, [[Bali]] in the mid to late 1930s. Due to [[World War II]],&lt;ref&gt;''Sweetness and blood : how surfing spread from Hawaii and California to the rest of the world, with some unexpected results'' by Michael Scott Moore. {{ISBN|9781605294278}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Koke left Bali and surfing did not catch on again until the late 1960s and early 1970s when traveling surfers began discovering surf spots off Bali, made especially famous (although they were not named) in the classic surfing film ''[[Morning of the Earth]]'' by Albert Falzon. Later Bali would become a stepping-stone for other Indonesian wave discoveries such as Nias, G-Land, and the [[Mentawai Islands]]. Although much of the Indonesian coastline has been scoured in search of surfing areas, every year continues to yield new discoveries, even today.
 
Today, surfing is an ubiquitous multi-million dollar Indonesian industry, which includes transportation, accommodation, dining, entertainment, and surfing services and products. Some islands have beach communities that make a living directly from surfing, such as Lakey Peak in Sumbawa, Sorake Beach in Nias, and Uluwatu Beach in Bali.&lt;ref name="Lakey Peak Guide"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.traveller.com.au/whos-who-at-lakey-peak-1jbsc|title=Who's Who At Lakey Peak|publisher=Traveller.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bali Surfing Guide"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.asiaholidayretreats.com/bali-surfing-guide/|title=Bali Surfing Guide|publisher=Asia Holiday Retreats}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multinational surfing brands such as [[Billabong]], [[Quiksilver]], and [[Oakley, Inc.]] run their entire [[Southeast Asia]] operation and distribution out of their Bali headquarters, most of which are found in the Kuta district.

Indonesian surfers are among the most successful in Asia and are ranked by the [[Asian Surfing Championships (ASC)|Asian Surfing Championships]], an organization that holds surfing contests throughout Asia. Raditya Rondi from Kuta Beach, Bali, was crowned the ASC Champion 2015, retaining both the Indonesian and Asian titles.&lt;ref name="Traveller.com.au Press Release"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asiansurfingtour.com/content/post/raditya-rondi-and-nilbie-blancada-win-the-rote-open-2016-presented-by-billabong-in-excellent-boa-wave-conditions|title=Raditya Rondi And Nilbie Blancada Win The Rote Open 2016 Presented By Billabong In Excellent Boa Wave Conditions|publisher=Asian Surfing Championships}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several international contests have been held in Indonesia over the years and 2013 alone saw two big international pro events, the Rip Curl Cup at Padang Padang invite-only event (won by Mega Semadhi from Pecatu, Bali), and the Oakley Pro Bali, which was the 5th stop of the world tour (won by 2012 World Champion [[Joel Parkinson]], Australia). Both contests were broadcast live online to over 2 million viewers worldwide.

Regional governments have realized the positive impact surfing has on their communities and the travel industry and have held ASC surfing contests in order to promote their waves and beaches. Surfing was admitted into the 2007 Asian Beach Games in Bali as a sport by the International Olympic Committee, the first major stepping stone to getting into the [[Olympic Games]]. Indonesian surfers are making an impact nationally and overseas with media coverage and contests result and strive to qualify for the ASP World Championship Tour. Still, the Indonesian central government has not acknowledged surfing as a major sport in Indonesia or supported it in any way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/09/17/sport/diah-rahayu-surfing-bali/ |title=Diah Rahayu: Bali's pioneer female surfer - CNN.com |publisher=Edition.cnn.com |date= |accessdate=2016-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Surf spots in Indonesia (famous locations)==
Indonesia is considered a surfer's paradise as it is composed of numerous islands with world class surf spots in warm water, some of them still unexplored.

===Bali===
The island of Bali is the most touristic destination for surfing in Indonesia as it has many world class waves and infrastructures to put up the tourists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.surfinglife.com.au/news/sl-news/12025-objectify-me-diah-rahayu |title=Objectify Me, Diah Rahayu |publisher=Surfinglife.com.au |date=2014-08-05 |accessdate=2016-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=World |url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/waves-of-change-and-degradation-how-surf-tourism-dumped-on-bali-and-indonesia-20151230-glwtzi.html |title=Waves of change and degradation: How surf tourism dumped on Bali and Indonesia |publisher=Smh.com.au |date= |accessdate=2016-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous surfing destinations on the island are Padang Padang, [[Uluwatu, Bali]] and Keramas.&lt;ref name="Bali Surf Spots"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.balisurfingparadise.com/bali-surf-spots.html|title=Bali Surf Spots|publisher=Bali Surf Sports|accessdate=2014-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Lombok===
Lombok island is the neighboring island eastward of Bali, as beautiful but much less developed.

'''Gerupuk Inside ''' is a couple of hollow lefts and rights. It fits well for beginners. 

'''Gerupuk Outside ''' is the most famous surfing spot in Lombok,  it is composed of two rights a quarter of miles apart.

'''Ekas''' is located opposite to the small harbour of Awang. It is right and left.

'''Mawi''' is also located on the south coast, but at the opposite west near Selong Belanak. It is also right and left.

===Mentawai===
The Mentawai is a chain of islands consisting of four main islands surrounded by numerous smaller islands. It is located near Sumatra island. There are several surf spots accessible by boat, with the best known being Macaroni, Lances Left and Lances Right.

'''Macaroni''' is a hollow left located in [[North Pagai]].

'''Lances Right''' is a right with hollow barrels, located in [[Sipura]].

'''Lances Left''' is located near Lances Right. It is similar to Lances Right except that it is a left.

===Panaitan Islands===
The Panaitan Islands are located near Java. These islands host many surf spots, the most famous being One Palm Point and Apocalypse.

'''One Palm Point''' is a legendary left point break with a shallow bottom.

'''Apocalypse''' is a hollow right slab.

===Sumatra===
[[Krui]] in [[Lampung Province]]. {{coord|5|11|0|S|103|56|0|E}}

===Sumbawa===
Sumbawa island is located at the east of Lombok. It has plenty of popular surf spots, with the most famous being Lakey Peak and Scar Reef.

==Famous surfers==
Bob Koke (USA) was the first surfer to ride Indonesian waves in the late 1930s. He then settled there and taught some Balinese to surf. 
 
'''Rizal Tanjung''' is one of the best known Indonesian surfers in the world as he was the first Indonesian to compete on the WQS. He was one of the first Indonesian surfers to travel as a professional surfer. He won the Indonesian Surfing Championship circuit in 2002 and 2006. He was called "The most recognizable Asian surfer alive" by Transworld Surf magazine. He also owns Kurawa and Rizt (two brands). He appeared in many surfing videos, including the famous Loose Change and Stranger Than Fiction.

'''Oney Anwar''' was the first surfer from Sumbawa to compete on the WQS. He learned to surf in Lakey Peak and joined the Rip Curl team when he was 10. He moved to Australia in a Rip Curl program for young surfers and came back later in Indonesia. He is now internationally known and looking to qualify for the WCT.

'''Raditya Rondi''' has been winning the Asian Surfing Championships since their creation in 2011. Indeed, he won the title of champion three consecutive years. He built a solid reputation in the Asian surfing scene and is internationally known.

==Indonesian Surfing Championships==
The Indonesian Surfing Championships (ISC) were launched by Tipi Jabrik in 2003, with a first edition in 2004 in partnership with Quiksilver. Its goal was to promote the growth of the sport of surfing in Indonesia through the organization of surfing competitions. It immediately met a big success, finally leading to a partnership with Coca-Cola Amatil Indonesia in 2008. This partnership lasted almost five years, including the creation of the Asian Surfing Championships (ASC) from the success of the ISC. The ISC still exists today, with competitions part of the ASC tour, which is also based in Indonesia. Therefore, the ASC is the leading player of the Asian Surfing scene.

==Importance of surfing for tourism==
Indonesia is a popular tourist destination because of its warm water and climate, its beautiful landscapes, and its perfect waves.

Tourism is the second largest sector of employment in Indonesia. 3% of the national GDP is generated by the tourism industry for a total amount of 4.5 billion $. In the island of Bali, which attracts the most foreign tourists, this sector represents two thirds of the local economy. There are no data to count the part of surfers among the tourists but according to the crowd in the water and to the part of foreigners in it, it attracts a lot of people. It is estimated that the surfing business generates more than half billion dollars in Bali alone, which represents more than 10% of the amount generated by tourism. Taking into account that the largest part of the surfers in Bali are tourists, surfing can be considered as a major part of tourism in Indonesia.

Indonesia has various other spots in other islands (like Lakey Peak or G-Land) which attract tourists only for surfing. Surfing has therefore developed a touristic activity in places which probably would not have attracted people otherwise.

==Dangers==
Some surf spots contain sharp reefs which are best avoided by beginners. Sunburns can also pose a problem, as the sun is strong and can quickly cause burns. Shark attacks occur (though rarely), and the water is also the home of several kinds of jellyfish which can sting surfers severely.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29487">'''Telephone recording laws''' are laws that govern the civilian recording of telephone conversations by the participants. Recording of private conversations by government or law enforcement ([[wiretapping]]) are usually covered by distinct laws.

[[Telephone tapping]] is strictly regulated in many countries, especially in all developed [[democracy|democracies]], to safeguard the [[privacy]] of telephone users. Telephone tapping often must be authorized by a [[court]], and is normally only approved when [[evidence (law)|evidence]] shows it is not possible to detect [[criminal]] or [[subversive]] activity in less intrusive ways;{{cn|date=April 2014}} often the law and regulations require that the crime investigated must be at least of a certain severity.{{cn|date=April 2014}} In many jurisdictions, however, permission for telephone tapping is easily obtained on a routine basis without further investigation by the court or other entity granting such permission. Illegal or unauthorized telephone tapping is often a criminal offense. However, in certain jurisdictions such as [[Germany]], criminal courts may accept illegally recorded phone calls without the other party's consent as evidence.

==Australia==
{{See also|Mass surveillance in Australia|}}

The federal ''Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979'' and State and Territory listening devices laws may both apply to monitoring or recording of telephone conversations.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Office of the Australian Information Commissioner, [[Advisory privacy guidelines]], https://www.oaic.gov.au/agencies-and-organisations/app-guidelines/&lt;/ref&gt; The general rule is that the call may not be recorded. Section 7 of the ''Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979'' prohibits intercepting a telephone call. "Interception" is defined in section 6, of which one element is that it is made "without the knowledge of the person making the communication". There are exceptions to these rules in very limited circumstances, including where a warrant applies.

If a call is to be recorded or monitored, an organization must tell you at the beginning of the conversation so that you have the chance either to end the call, or to ask to be transferred to another line where monitoring or recording does not take place (if this is available).&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

Reasons organizations may monitor or record conversations could include:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
*to protect you in your dealings with the organization
*to provide a record in the event of a dispute about the transaction
*to improve customer service.

In the state of Queensland it is not illegal to simply record a telephone conversation if you are a party to the conversation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legalaid.qld.gov.au/legalinformation/livinginthecommunity/Yourrights/Pages/Privacy.aspx#When can I record a telephone conversation?&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==

===Organizations===
In Canada, organizations subject to the [[Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-8.6/ ''Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act'', SC 2000, c 5.]&lt;/ref&gt; (PIPEDA) must comply with PIPEDA when recording calls.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada. {{cite web|url=https://www.priv.gc.ca/resource/fs-fi/02_05_d_14_e.asp|title=Guidelines for Recording of Customer Telephone Calls|date=June 2008|accessdate=September 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to comply with the PIPEDA, organizations should take the following steps when recording conversations:&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;
# The individual must be informed that the conversation is being recorded at the beginning of the call. This can be done by an automated recording or by the customer service representative.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;
# The individual must be advised of the purposes. The organization must be clear about the purposes; an organization should not state that it is recording the conversation for quality assurance purposes if, in fact, the recording will be used for other purposes. Informing the individual of the purposes can be done in a variety of ways—verbally, by pressing a number on the keypad (in the case of automated messages) or with clear messages on monthly statements. (For example: If you have any questions about your bill please call 1-800-XXX-XXXX. Please note your call will be recorded for...) If the individual proceeds knowing the conversation is being recorded and the purpose of the recording, consent is implied.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;
# If the caller objects to the recording, the organization should provide the caller with meaningful alternatives. The alternatives might involve not taping the call; visiting a retail outlet; writing a letter; or, conducting the transaction over the Internet.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

===Individuals===
An individual may record a call as long as he or she is one of the participants of the call.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/careers/career-advice/experts/am-i-allowed-to-record-conversations-at-work/article21877154/|title=Am I allowed to record conversations at work?|last=Lublin|first=Daniel|work=Globe and Mail|date=December 2, 2014|accessdate=September 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recording can be used as evidence in a lawsuit.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

However, it is illegal to record communications that the recording party is not participating in.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; An illegal recording can lead to a sentence of up to five years in prison. Section 183 (Part VI) of the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]] also outlaws surreptitious recording of communications without consent of one of the intended recipients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legaltree.ca/node/908|title=Is it legal to record a private conversation? Wiretapping and the one party consent exception to the rule against interception|date=May 6, 2008|accessdate=September 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Denmark==
Calls and conversations may be recorded by any active participant, with no requirement to make other parties aware of the recording. But forwarding or playing calls considered private is illegal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.retsinformation.dk/Forms/r0710.aspx?id=181992#Kap27 Straffeloven § 264 d]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Finland==
In the case of private persons, calls and conversations may be recorded by any active participant. There is no requirement to make other parties aware of the recording, but the use of recordings, depending on their content, may be subject to various laws, such as data protection (privacy) legislation, libel laws, laws governing trade and national secrets, and any agreements, such as non-disclosure agreements.&lt;ref name=Finland&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tietosuoja.fi/fi/index/ratkaisut/puheluidennauhoittaminen.html|title=Omien keskustelujen ja puheluiden nauhoittaminen työpaikalla (Data Protection Ombudsman)|year=2006|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recording of calls by a company or an employer is subject to data protection legislation and, as a general rule, requires informing the participants prior to recording.&lt;ref name=Finland/&gt;

==Germany==
Germany is a two-party consent state—telephone recording without the consent of the two or, when applicable, more, parties is a criminal offence according to Sec. 201 of the German Criminal Code&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iuscomp.org/gla/statutes/StGB.htm#201 Sec. 201 of the German Criminal Code]&lt;/ref&gt;—violation of the confidentiality of the spoken word. Telephone tapping by authorities has to be approved by a judge. Telephone recording by a private citizen can be allowed in cases of self-defence, Sec. 32 of the German Criminal Code&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html#p0172 Sec. 32 of the German Criminal Code]&lt;/ref&gt;, or Necessity, Sec. 34 of the German Criminal Code&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html#p0177 Sec. 34 of the German Criminal Code]&lt;/ref&gt;.

For discussion on lawful interception in Germany please see [[:de:Telekommunikationsüberwachung|de:Telekommunikationsüberwachung]] (German language).

==India==
In India, telephone tapping has to be approved by a designated authority. It is illegal otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Phone Nice What 1997 Supreme Court verdict says|url=http://news.rediff.com/report/2010/apr/26/phone-tapping-what-1997-supreme-court-verdict-says.htm|publisher=Rediff|accessdate=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Central Government or State Government is empowered to order interception of messages per 12section 5 of Indian Telegraph Act 1885.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trai.gov.in/telegraphact.asp Indian Telegraph Act, 1885]&lt;/ref&gt; Rule 419 and 419A sets out the procedure of interception and monitoring of telephone messages. There is a provision for a review committee to supervise the order of interception.

Phone tapping is permitted based on Court order only and such permission is granted only if it is required to prevent a major offence involving national security or to gather intelligence on anti-national/terrorist activities.

Though economic offences/tax evasion were initially covered under the reasons for interception of phones, the same was withdrawn in 1999 by the Government based on a Supreme Court order citing protection to privacy of the individual.

As per Rule 428 of the India telegraphic rules, no person without the sanction of the telegraph authority, use any telephone or cause or suffer it to be used, purposes other than the establishment of local or trunk calls.

The Government of India instructions provide for approved attachments. There is no provision for attachment for recording conversation.

==Italy==
According to the [[Supreme Court of Cassation (Italy)|Supreme Court of Cassation]], recorded conversations are legal and can be used as evidence in court, even if the other party is unaware of being recorded, provided that the recording party takes part of the conversation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Registrare di nascosto: per la Cassazione è legale|author=Francesco Polimeni|date=5 May 2014|url=http://notizie.tiscali.it/socialnews/articoli/polimeni/13230/registrare-di-nascosto-per-la-cassazione-e-legale/|language=Italian|publisher=[[Tiscali]] News|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011100301/http://notizie.tiscali.it/socialnews/articoli/polimeni/13230/registrare-di-nascosto-per-la-cassazione-e-legale/|archivedate=11 October 2016|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ireland==

Recorded calls are legal and can be used as evidence in court, providing the person recording is a participant to the conversation, or has consent from at least one participant from the conversation. &lt;ref&gt; https://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/q-a-what-are-the-legal-implications-1.1740070&lt;/ref&gt;

==Latvia==
Calls and conversations by private persons may be recorded by any active participant. There is no requirement in laws to make other parties aware of the recording, but the use of recordings, depending on their content, may be subject to various laws.&lt;ref name=Latvia&gt;{{cite web|url=https://likumi.lv/doc.php?id=4042|title=Fizisko personu datu aizsardzības likums (Personal Data Protection Law)|year=2010|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Zealand==
Recording of phone calls by private persons falls under interception-related provisions of the Crimes Act 1961, which has a general prohibition on the use of interception devices. An exception is made for when the person intercepting the call is a party to the conversation. There is no requirement that both parties be aware of the interception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1961/0043/latest/DLM329814.html|title=Crimes Act 1961, Section 216B|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Romania==
Intercepting communications falls under the provisions of the Penal Code and, in the case of electronic communications, under the [http://legislatie.just.ro/Public/DetaliiDocument/56973#id_artA88_ttl Telecommunications Act (506/2004)]. The recording of a conversation by a private member to that conversation is specifically permitted. Nevertheless, while such recordings are legal, making use of them may fall subject to further civil or criminal law. Their admissibility as evidence also depends on the circumstances.

== Turkey ==
There are strict conditions for both the act of surveillance as well as the storage of that data, but as long as it is clear enough of what exactly is being used for as well as implementation procedures were legal by authorities, it is deemed as alright. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2016|title=UNLAWFUL USE OF INFORMATION OBTAINED BY MEANS OF TELEPHONE TAPPING IN DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS AGAINST A PUBLIC PROSECUTOR.|url=https://libproxy.berkeley.edu/login?qurl=http%3a%2f%2fsearch.ebscohost.com%2flogin.aspx%3fdirect%3dtrue%26db%3da9h%26AN%3d116819005%26site%3deds-live|journal=Juridical Current|volume=19|pages=169-171|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subject at hand was suspected for not related criminal investigation therefore the telephone tapping was justified. 

==Sweden==
According to the Swedish Penal Code (Brottsbalken) [http://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-lagar/dokument/svensk-forfattningssamling/brottsbalk-1962700_sfs-1962-700 (SFS1962/700)] Chapter 4, 8–9 §§, it is illegal to make ''unauthorized'' recordings of telephone conversatios. A court can grant permission for law enforcement agencies to tap telephone lines. Also, anyone participating in the telephone call may record the conversation — at least one party in the call must be aware of the recording being made. A recording is always admissible as evidence in a court, even if obtained in illegal matters.

==United Kingdom==

===England and Wales===
The [[Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000]] in general prohibits interception of communications by a third party, with exceptions related to government agencies. A recording made by one party to a phone call or e-mail without notifying the other is not prohibited provided that the recording is for their own use; recording without notification is prohibited where some of the contents of the communication—a phone conversation or an e-mail—are made available to a third party. Businesses may record with the knowledge of their employees, but without notifying the other party, to
*provide evidence of a business transaction,
*ensure that a business complies with regulatory procedures,
*see that quality standards or targets are being met,
*protect national security,
*prevent or detect crime,
*investigate the unauthorised use of a telecommunications system, or
*secure the effective operation of the telecommunications system.

They may monitor without recording phone calls or e-mails that have been received to see whether they are relevant to the business (e.g., to check for business communications addressed to an employee who is away); but such monitoring must be proportional and in accordance with data protection laws and codes of practice.

This summary does not necessarily cover all possible cases. The main legislation which must be complied with is:
* [[Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000]] ("RIPA")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/23/contents|title=UK Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000|year=2000|chapter=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Telecommunications (Lawful Business Practice)(Interception of Communications) Regulations 2000 ("LBP Regulations")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2000/2699/contents/made|title=Telecommunications (Lawful Business Practice) (Interception of Communications) Regulations 2000|year=2000|issue=2699}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Data Protection Act 1998
* Telecommunications (Data Protection and Privacy) Regulations 1999&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1999/2093/contents/made|title=Telecommunications (Data Protection and Privacy) Regulations 1999|year=1999|issue=2093}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Human Rights Act 1998]]

Under RIPA unlawful recording or monitoring of communications is a [[tort]], allowing civil action in the courts. There is a summary of applicable rules on the Oftel website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofcom.org.uk/static/archive/oftel/consumer/advice/faqs/prvfaq3.htm|title=Oftel (UK) FAQ: Recording and monitoring telephone calls or e-mails|date=June 24, 2010|accessdate=September 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recording is sometimes advised, as in recording business transactions carried out by telephone to provide a record. It is sometimes mandatory; from March 2009 [[Financial Services Authority]] rules required firms to record all telephone conversations and electronic communications relating to client orders and the conclusion of transactions in the equity, bond, and derivatives markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsa.gov.uk/library/communication/pr/2008/017.shtml|title=FSA Web site: FSA publishes new rules on telephone recording|publisher=FSA|date=March 3, 2008|accessdate=September 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2011 this was extended to cover the recording of mobile phone conversations that related to client orders and transactions by regulated firms.

==United States==
In ''[[Rathbun v United States]]'', the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled in regard to interstate or foreign communication that "the clear inference is that one entitled to receive the communication may use it for his own benefit or have another use it for him. The communication itself is not privileged, and one party may not force the other to secrecy merely by using a telephone. It has been conceded by those who believe the conduct here violates Section 605 [of the Federal Communication Act]  that either party may record the conversation and publish it." See United States v. Polakoff, 113 F. 2d 888, 889. (Therefore, every communications including interstate phone calls, to and from any States in the USA and every foreign phone call to and from the USA, are under the control and the jurisdiction of the Federal government of the USA pursuant to the Federal communication Act of June 19, 1934, 48 Stat. 1064, 1104, 47 U.S.C. Section 605. That any party to the phone conversation can him/herself record the phone conversation or have another person record the phone conversation for him/her and publish it, including posting it on social media.)

Federal law requires that at least one party taking part in the call must be notified of the recording ([[Title 18 of the United States Code|18 U.S.C.]] §2511(2)(d)). For example, it would be illegal to record, without notification, the phone calls of people who come into a place of business and ask to use the telephone. 

Telephone recording laws in some U.S. states require only one party to be aware of the recording, while other states require both parties to be aware. Several states require that all parties consent when one party wants to record a telephone conversation.&lt;ref name="rcfp.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rcfp.org/reporters-recording-guide/tape-recording-laws-glance |title=Tape-recording laws at a glance |publisher=Reporters Committee |date=August 1, 2012|access-date=September 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Telephone scammers and others intentionally violating the federal [[National Do Not Call Registry|Do Not Call list]] may try to locate in those states, or use their area codes. Many businesses and other organizations record their telephone calls so that they can prove what was said, train their staff, or monitor performance. This activity may not be considered telephone tapping in some, but not all, jurisdictions because it is done with the knowledge of at least one of the parties to the telephone conversation.

Telephone recordings are governed by federal law and by mainly two types of state laws:

===Two-party consent states===
States that currently require that all parties consent to the recording include:

* California&lt;ref&gt;[http://codes.findlaw.com/ca/penal-code/pen-sect-632.html California Penal Code Section 632(a)] Retrieved September 28, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Illinois Supreme Court's decision in ''People v. Clark'' on March 20, 2014, which struck down Illinois' two-party consent law,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://law.justia.com/cases/illinois/supreme-court/2014/115776.html|title=People v. Clark|work=Justia Law|access-date=2018-06-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Illinois was a one-party consent state. However, the state legislature amended the statute and, as of December 30, 2014, Illinois is once again a two-party consent state,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; although the revised law establishes a one-party consent rule for private electronic communications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/fulltext.asp?DocName=072000050K14-2|title=Illinois General Assembly - Illinois Compiled Statutes|website=www.ilga.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Michigan Court of Appeals]] ruled in 1982 that participants in a conversation may record a discussion without getting the permission of other participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/07/michigan-pol-reportedly-tried-to-fake-male-prostitute-scandal-to-hide-affair/?intcmp=hpbt4|title=Michigan pol reportedly tried to fake male prostitute scandal to hide relationship|agency=[[Fox News]]|date=August 7, 2015|accessdate=September 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ruling stated that eavesdropping only applies to: "a third party not otherwise involved in the conversation being eavesdropped on". This is because the law uses the wording, "the private discourse of others", rather than the wording, "the private discourse of others ''or with others''{{-"}}.&lt;ref name="publicdocs"&gt;{{cite web|date=August 21, 2003|url=http://publicdocs.courts.mi.gov:81/OPINIONS/FINAL/COA/20030821_C234723_55_161O.234723.OPN.COA.PDF|title=State of Michigan Court of Appeals|publisher=publicdocs.courts.mi.gov:81|accessdate=September 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Michigan law is often misinterpreted as requiring the consent of all parties to a conversation.&lt;ref name=dmlp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmlp.org/legal-guide/michigan-recording-law|title=Michigan Recording Law &amp;#124; Digital Media Law Project|publisher=dmlp.org|accessdate=September 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[California Supreme Court]] ruled in 2006 that if a caller in a one-party state records a conversation with someone in California, that one-party state caller is subject to the stricter of the laws and must have consent from all callers (cf. ''Kearney v. Salomon Smith Barney Inc.'', 39 Cal. 4th 95&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/opinions/documents/S124739.PDF California courts document on ''Kearney v. Salomon Smith Barney, Inc.''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823045528/http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/opinions/documents/S124739.PDF |date=2006-08-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). However, non-disclosure recordings by one of the parties can legally be made if the other party is threatening [[kidnapping]], [[extortion]], [[bribery]], [[human trafficking]], or other felony violence. Also included in the exception is misdemeanor [[obscenity]] and threats of injury to persons or property via an electronic communication device (usually a telephone) if directed in whole or in part towards a conversation participant or family members.&lt;ref&gt;California Penal Code § 633.5&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Digital Media Law Project]], 'New York is a one-party consent state.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmlp.org/legal-guide/new-york-recording-law|work=Digital Media Law Project|title=New York Recording Law|date=April 26, 2016|accessdate=September 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;N.Y. Penal Law sections 250.00 (1), found at [http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/lawssrch.cgi?NVLWO: New York Laws]. Retrieved April 26, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some states distinguish between electronic and in-person communication. For example, Oregon is a one-party consent state for electronic communication, but requires all-party consent for live in-person communication, with a few exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rcfp.org/reporters-recording-guide/state-state-guide/oregon|title=Oregon|date=August 1, 2012|accessdate=September 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accepted forms of notification recording by a telephone company===
The [[Federal Communications Commission]] defines accepted forms of notification for telephone recording by telephone companies as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Subpart E--Use of Recording Devices by Telephone Companies|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2010-title47-vol3/pdf/CFR-2010-title47-vol3-sec64-501.pdf|publisher=United States Government Publishing Office|accessdate=September 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Prior verbal (oral) or written notification of all parties to the telephone conversation.
* Verbal (oral) notification before the recording is made. This is the most commonly used type.
* An audible beep tone repeated at regular intervals during the call.

'''''The House of the Dead: Overkill''''' is a [[First-person shooter|first-person]] [[rail shooter]] [[Light gun shooter|gun game]] developed by [[Headstrong Games]] and published by [[Sega]] in 2009. It is the fifth game entry in ''[[The House of the Dead (series)|The House of the Dead]]'' series, a prequel to the [[The House of the Dead (video game)|original game]] chronologically and the first in the series to be released solely on a home console. An ''Extended Cut'' edition for [[PlayStation 3]], compatible with the [[PlayStation Move]] accessory, was released in 2011. A mobile version, '''''The Lost Reels''''' was released on [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices in 2013.

An alternate version, '''''The Typing of The Dead: Overkill''''', was released for [[Microsoft Windows]] in 2013, replacing the game's shooting gameplay with keyboard typing mechanics from 1999's ''[[The Typing of the Dead]]''. It includes the original shooting mechanics as an option.

==Gameplay==
Like previous games in the ''House of the Dead'' series, ''Overkill'' is a [[Shoot 'em up#Tube and rail shooters|rail shooter]], with pre-determined character movement, with the shooting element under player control by pointing the [[Wii Remote]] at the screen, moving the aiming [[reticle]]. The player can point the reticle near the edge of the screen to move the camera angle slightly in that direction, allowing a further field of view known as "Danger Cam".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | year=2009 | editor=Sega Europe Limited | title=House of the Dead: Overkill instruction booklet (PAL) | publisher=Sega | page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story mode can be played solo or with another human player, with one weapon or [[dual-wield]]ing controls.

Players can also build up a combo meter by killing mutants to receive a score, with further points gained by performing head-shots, shooting bonus pickup, saving civilians and attaining multiple kills without missing a shot. If a player dies, points from his or her overall score can be spent to continue playing. At the end of each level, the player is awarded a grade that depends on his or her final score among other factors such as not dying, and accuracy of shots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | year=2009 | editor=Sega Europe Limited | title=House of the Dead: Overkill instruction booklet (PAL) | publisher=Sega | page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with score bonuses, other pick ups scattered throughout levels include health packs, grenades, the "Slow Mo-Fo" pick up that puts everything into slow motion temporarily&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | year=2009 | editor=Sega Europe Limited | title=House of the Dead: Overkill instruction booklet (PAL) | publisher=Sega | page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the "Evil Eye" feature in which shooting a certain environmental point destroys any lurking mutants nearby.

New guns and gun upgrades can be bought with cash earned from the player's end of level score, between levels at the Gun Shop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | year=2009 | editor=Sega Europe Limited | title=House of the Dead: Overkill instruction booklet (PAL) | publisher=Sega | page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon completing the story mode, Director's Cut is unlocked providing the same game as story mode but with tougher enemies, extended levels and a limited amount of continues.

==Plot==

===Characters===
*Agent G: Inexperienced but already highly trained and deadly, he graduated top of his class at the AMS academy and is now on his first assignment.
*Detective Isaac Washington: A hard-drinking, ladies' man, Washington is also a habitual rule and heart-breaker. He took the assignment to exact revenge for his father's death. He has a habit of dropping [[Fuck|F-bombs]].  ''[[Game Informer]]'' ranked him among the "Top 10 Heroes of 2009", declaring that "Foul-mouthed, uncompromising, hard drinking, and unceasingly funny, Isaac Washington keeps everything grounded when the world is going crazy all around him. With tongue set firmly in cheek, Washington is a stereotypical career cop who can't finish a sentence without a few expletives thrown in for color. He keeps the action going, and never fails to say what the player is thinking when the zombie outbreak gets out of hand."&lt;ref&gt;"Top 10 Heroes of 2009", ''GameInformer'' 202 (): 31.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Papa Caesar: Deranged crime lord Caesar has forced Varla's brother Jasper into devising a strange compound with mutagenic effects. With the help of Warden Darling he sets to work transforming the innocent inhabitants of Bayou City into mutants and monsters. He also likes Chinese food. ''Game Informer'' ranked him among the "Top 10 Villains of 2009", declaring that "Many villains have unleashed genetic abominations and blown us up, but none did it while wearing a stylish ascot.  Papa Caesar makes engineering the zombie apocalypse look good.  Analogizing Isaac Washington's death to a sweet and sour Chinese dinner seals his position on the list."&lt;ref&gt;"Top 10 Villains of 2009", ''GameInformer'' 202 (): 35.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Varla Guns: The hottest stripper on the Bayou City club scene, Varla is also the older sister to crippled scientific genius Jasper Guns. She joins the agents to stop Papa Caesar, and a love triangle develops. In the Lost Reels, she is a [[downloadable content]] (DLC) playable character and can be unlocked by purchasing the DLC chapter—Naked Terror.
*Candi Stryper: A young stripper and former lover of Varla Guns' younger brother Jasper. After finding out the death of Jasper, Candi joins Varla to seek revenge against Papa Caesar and together, they fight off the mutants and seek Papa Caesar to avenge the death of Jasper. Candi is exclusive to the PlayStation 3 version. In the Lost Reels, like Varla, she is also a DLC playable character and can be unlocked by purchasing the DLC chapter—Naked Terror.
*Warden Clement Darling: A strange and unsettling man who oversees a high security prison just outside town, Darling is involved in gruesome scientific experiments to prolong the life of his elderly mother. He is later revealed to be the main antagonist and mastermind of the events.

===Plot===
Years ago during the [[Cold War]], the U.S. military made a new superhuman formula called Formula X but the project for its use failed. The bunker for the experiments was shut down and abandoned. In 1991, seven years before The Curien Mansion Incident, AMS Special Agent G is given his first assignment and sent to a small town in [[Louisiana]] to investigate a series of disappearances and hunt down a deranged crime boss, Papa Caesar. Due to the presence of mutants, G is forced to team up with police detective Isaac Washington who is out to avenge his father's murder, which Caesar masterminded.

In the first episode "Papa's Palace of Pain", the pair first storm a mansion owned by Caesar out in the woods. Upon entering the basement, they find Caesar has fled, and the disabled scientist Jasper Guns, whom Caesar used, is horrifically mutated from injecting himself with an unknown substance. Upon defeating Jasper, G and Isaac meet Varla Guns, a stripper and Jasper's older sister who vows revenge on Caesar. In the second episode, "Ballistic Trauma", G and Isaac track Caesar to a hospital that is swarming with mutants. After killing the mutants and a mutant woman called the Screamer, they find a ringing phone hidden inside it. Caesar answers from the other end and the hospital is set to explode. G and Isaac escape in the nick of time with Varla on a motorbike. In the third episode, "Carny", they stop at a mutant infested [[carnival]] to investigate the mutant situation, in the process defeating former circus entertainers turned horrific creature Nigel &amp; Sebastian. Afterwards, they continue to follow Caesar on an ice cream truck. In the fourth episode, "Scream Train", they and Varla catch Caesar at a train station. But they argue over what to do with him: G wants to arrest him, Issac wants to avenge his father, and Varla wants to avenge her brother. Caesar then escapes on a train with G and Isaac giving chase while Varla is left behind. The pair made their way through the mutant-infested train, defeating a mutated mantis, the Crawler, in the process. An explosion causes the train to crash in a swamp where Caesar takes Varla hostage and drives off before throwing a [[cassette tape]] to Isaac. In the fifth episode, "Fetid Waters", G and Isaac make their way to the swamps, finding an alternate way to wherever Caesar and Varla were heading for, and in the process, defeat another boss mutant called the Lobber.

In the sixth, penultimate episode 'Jailhouse Judgment', G and Isaac track Caesar to a high security prison. Before they enter, they run into its strange warden, Clement Darling, who noticed where Caesar and Varla headed but knows nothing about the mutants. As G and Isaac shoot their way through the prison they finally reach the [[electric chair]] theater where Varla and Caesar are strapped into the chairs. Clement then appears and, in a plot twist, reveals that he was behind the mutant outbreak and that Caesar was just an accomplice. Clement then executes Caesar, robbing Isaac of his revenge. Clement explains that his experiments were to save his dying mother (following this, it is implied Clement has an [[incest]]uous relationship with his mother). Clement then descends on a giant elevator along with Varla, his mother, and Caesar's corpse. Seconds later, Clement tells G and Isaac to look at the stage behind them where two gigantic, physically enhanced, convicts wearing black masks lumber in through the door. Clement reads the two convicts' previous crimes which include murder, assault, rape, and even eating a little boy's puppy. One of the convicts, Brutus, suddenly turns around and beats his fellow convict to death before turning his attention to G and Isaac.

After killing Brutus and descending the elevator in pursuit of Clement in the final episode "Overkill", G and Isaac shoot their way through hordes of mutants inside Clement's underground lab before finally reaching his center of operations. They discover Varla's brain has been taken out, kept alive in a jar, while Clement's mother's brain has been transplanted into Varla's body. At first it seems the experiment was a success, then Varla's body begins to vomit and she falls into a pit after being gunned down by G and Isaac, mutating her into a giant monster. G and Isaac draw their guns and aim them at the newly mutated Mother. The duo's statements lead gamers to believe that they are about to play a frantic last stand shootout against the giant mutant, but then the screen cuts to a missing reel screen for a few moments. Once the reel resumes G and Isaac are outside claiming victory over Clement and the giant monster, thanking the use of [[minigun]]s they found randomly lying around nearby. However, the monster returns and the pair battle her again. After finally killing it, Clement appears and seeks to atone for all the problems he caused by "returning to the womb" and enters the monster's body.

G and Isaac are picked up by a helicopter along with Varla's (still active) brain in a jar where Isaac releases the detonator to destroy the facility. G tells Varla of his feelings for her, prompting him and Isaac to discuss the moral and political messages in the game's storyline and potential backlash, particularly from feminists. Soon after, the two realize the helicopter is being piloted by a mutant and point their guns at it, ending the game.

In ''Extended Cut'', there are two new levels featuring Varla Guns and a stripper named Candi Stryper, who was in love with Jasper Guns. It is a side story during the main game (set after the second and fourth levels). It sees the girls traveling through a strip club and a meat packing plant, fighting grotesque mutant strippers Coco and Sindy, as well as Meat Katie, a [[minotaur]]-like female butcher. The side story ends with Candi dying of blood loss after the battle with Meat Katie.

After the credits roll, Caesar's tape recording from before is played, revealing a message to Isaac that Clement's plans were small-minded but he has powerful friends (possibly the future DBR corporation), and that Isaac's father is still alive.

==Development==
The game was originally intended to follow the same style as previous ''The House of the Dead'' games, while other themes such as [[steampunk]] were also considered. Headstrong ultimately chose a theme inspired by [[exploitation film]]s after watching the film ''[[Planet Terror]]'', which inspired the art direction, plot and marketing.&lt;ref name=makingof&gt;[http://www.britishgaming.co.uk/?p=2347 The Making Of… The House of the Dead: Overkill] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215132713/http://www.britishgaming.co.uk/?p=2347 |date=15 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the main characters were modeled after several famous individuals. For example, Detective Washington was modeled after rapper [[Common (rapper)|Common]], Varla Guns after glamor model Vikki Blows, Papa Caesar after [[Burt Reynolds]], Jasper Guns after [[Stephen Hawking]], and Agent G on [[Keanu Reeves]] as he appears in ''[[Point Break]]''.&lt;ref name=makingof/&gt;

==Music==
The soundtrack is written and composed by John Sanderson and Nadeem Daya. The songs are pop, rock, funk, country and disco genres of the 1970s era. Despite many requests from fans, neither Sega nor Headstrong Games have any plans to release an official soundtrack, although there exist bootleg versions on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=MomoiroKaichou|title=House of The Dead: Overkill Soundtrack|url=http://rateyourmusic.com/release/unauth/john_sanderson_and_nadeem_daya/house_of_the_dead__overkill_soundtrack/|website=Rate Your Music|accessdate=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
''The House of the Dead: Overkill'' was originally released on the [[Wii]] on February 10, 2009 in North America and February 13, 2009 in Europe.&lt;ref name="IGN announce"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/899/899925p1.html|title=The House of the Dead: Overkill announced.|last=Casamassina|first=Matt|publisher=IGN|date=2008-08-19|accessdate= 2008-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was later released in Japan on September 17, 2009 bundled with the [[Wii Zapper]] accessory.&lt;ref name="JPrelease"/&gt;

The game was also released in a limited collector's edition that includes a graphic novel prequel to the game called ''Prelude to an Overkill''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kotaku.com.au/games/2008/11/house_of_the_dead_overkill_collectors_edition_and_graphic_novel-2.html House Of The Dead: Overkill Collector's Edition And Graphic Novel] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223195514/http://www.kotaku.com.au/games/2008/11/house_of_the_dead_overkill_collectors_edition_and_graphic_novel-2.html |date=23 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A special release of the game in Australia, the "Bang Bang Box", comes packaged with the graphic novel in addition to two [[Wii Remote]] gun shells modeled after the AMS pistols carried by the main characters in the game (similar to a [[Desert Eagle]] pistol).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McWhertor|first=Michael|title=The House Of The Dead Overkill Gets A Hand Cannon|url=http://kotaku.com/5134683/the-house-of-the-dead-overkill-gets-a-hand-cannon|publisher=Kotaku}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Extended Cut''===
On October 25, 2011, the game was released on the [[PlayStation 3]] with [[PlayStation Move]] compatibility in North America, Europe and Australia and on February 23, 2012 in Japan. It came with the Sixaxis controllers and DualShock 3 titled, {{nihongo|''The House of the Dead: Overkill – Extended Cut''|ザ・ハウス・オブ・ザ・デッド オーバーキル ディレクターズカット|Za hausu Obu za deddo ōbākiru Direkutāzukatto|lit. ''The House of the Dead: Overkill Director's Cut''}}. ''Extended Cut'' features the same on-rails gameplay with all new redone [[High-definition video|High Definition]] cutscenes and levels, albeit still virtually identical to the Wii version, including that the missing reel is restored. The game also has 3D compatibility with the use of an HD 3D TV. Music and audio are still the same along with new music featured.

Exclusive are two new levels not included in the original Wii release, "Naked Terror" and "Creeping Flesh". They both serve as a sidestory in-between the main game featuring Varla Gunns and a new female character, stripper Candi Stryper. They contain new enemy types (strippers, meat plantation workers and skinless zombies), additional bonus materials for you to collect, and two new boss battles. New weapons like a crossbow and a few others have been added to ''Extended Cut'' as well as an entirely new in-game screen layout. Extras from the Wii version like the mini games and Director's Cut mode also make it to the ''Extended Cut'', along with new content. A pre-order comic book, ''Prelude to an Overkill'' is available in-game as a collectible bonus material.

===''The Lost Reels''===
''The House of the Dead: Overkill – The Lost Reels'' was released for [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices on April 25, 2013. The game is split into three chapters, with the first two included and the latter third requiring an additional fee. Money can also be spent in exchange for coins that can unlock better weapons, including some based on other Sega games such as ''[[Vectorman]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.sega.com/2013/04/25/house-of-the-dead-overkill-the-lost-reels-arrives-on-ios-and-android/|title=SEGA Blog - House of the Dead: Overkill – The Lost Reels Arrives on iOS and Android!|publisher=Blogs.sega.com|accessdate=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lost Reels eventually became free-to-play until Sega removed the game from the App Store a year later due to negative reviews.

===''The Typing of the Dead: Overkill''===
''The Typing of the Dead: Overkill'', developed by Modern Dream, was simultaneously announced and released on [[Microsoft Windows]] on October 29, 2013. The game follows the same premise of the 1999 game, ''[[The Typing of the Dead]]'', following the same storyline of ''Overkill: Extended Cut'', but requiring players to type out words and phrases using a keyboard to defeat zombies as opposed to shooting them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/10/29/5042924/typing-of-the-dead-overkill-release-pc-steam|title=The Typing of the Dead: Overkill out now for PC|work=Polygon|accessdate=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game also includes the ''Extended Cut'' version of ''The House of the Dead: Overkill'', playable with mouse or controller, and features [[downloadable content|downloadable]] dictionaries and multiplayer after an update.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tssznews.com/2013/10/30/dlc-planned-for-typing-of-the-dead-overkill/|title=DLC Planned for Typing of the Dead Overkill|work=TSSZ News|accessdate=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game began development at [[Blitz Games Studios]], which was liquidated in September 2013. Upon the studio's closure, the development team were able to convince Sega to let them complete the game under a new license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/203801/How_Typing_of_the_Dead_Overkill_survived_its_studios_apocalypse.php|title=Gamasutra - How Typing of the Dead: Overkill survived its studio's apocalypse|author=Kris Ligman|publisher=Gamasutra.com|accessdate=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several DLC text packs have been released that replace the typed words.

}}

Upon release, ''The House of the Dead: Overkill'' received a generally favorable response from critics, with an average review score of 81% at [[GameRankings]] and 79/100 at [[Metacritic]]. Many critics praised the fast-paced balanced gameplay, with [[X-Play]] stating "the arcade style shooting is satisfying and provides a challenge for experienced players" yet "easily conquered for those who can't aim a Wiimote to save their life." [[Games Radar]] found the simple gameplay to be "varied enough to keep the momentum going."&lt;ref name="gamesradar"/&gt; Although considered to be easier than past games of the series, [[GameSpot]] calling the difficulty a "cake walk" at pure gore and bloodiest game times,&lt;ref name="gamespot"/&gt; [[Eurogamer]] opined the game "almost never tries your patience, and it's made with such infectious and irreverent glee and such obvious pride, you can't help but join in."&lt;ref name="Eurogamer"/&gt; The over-the-top [[B movie]] grindhouse style was particularly praised. ''[[Game Informer]]'' stated "the parade of [[Fuck|F-bombs]] and one-liners fit in perfect harmony with the grindhouse presentation", even recommending it to [[Quentin Tarantino|Tarantino]] fans. GameSpot claimed it "reinvents the aging shooter series for the better with an over-the-top grindhouse theme that resonates in its every aspect, from the hilarious story to the fantastic vintage soundtrack."&lt;ref name="gamespot"/&gt; ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' stated that ''Overkill'' "raises the bar for third party production values on this generation's best-selling console."&lt;ref name="edge"/&gt; Though [[1UP.com|1UP]] "still enjoyed the game", they did consider that "with its constant stream of expletives and [[Off-color humor|toilet humor]], it may turn just as many people away" and started their review with a disclaimer for younger gamers not to play, being strictly an adult game. Another issue critics found was a number of technical issues, particularly with the frame rate, which [[IGN]] called "sketchy" and "sad to see in a game that has so much amazing content in it."&lt;ref name="ign"/&gt; ''[[GamePro]]'' also experienced this, notably when "the screen became cluttered with enemies", originally hoping the issue to be fixed before the game's final release.&lt;ref name="gamepro"/&gt; Another issue were glitches, with ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' reportedly experiencing no enemies appearing at all at times and sometimes requiring to restart the console.

On the Special Achievement Award, [[GameSpot]] awarded ''Overkill'' Funniest Game of 2009, going on to say: "The interplay between Washington and Special Agent G is pure gold. Like [[Martin and Lewis]] with [[Fuck|F-bombs]]. Mix that up with grindball atmosphere and Overkill cements its place as the funniest game of 2009." &lt;ref&gt;[http://au.gamespot.com/best-of/special-achievement/index.html?page=15]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225224825/http://au.gamespot.com/best-of/special-achievement/index.html?page=15 |date=December 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The game received a ''[[Guinness World Records|Guinness World Record]]'' for being the most profane video game in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/30861/house-dead-overkill-sets-record|title=House of the Dead: Overkill Sets Record|publisher=DreadCentral|accessdate=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brian Crecente, "[http://kotaku.com/5170505/house-of-the-dead-overkill-breaks-f+ing-record ''House of the Dead: Overkill'' Breaks F-ing Record]", ''Kotaku'' (Mar 16 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2009/03/16/house-of-the-dead-overkill-has-most-swearing-ever/|title=House of the Dead: Overkill has most swearing ever|work=Joystiq|accessdate=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jonathan Burroughs, the game's writer, said: "It is a dubious honor to receive such an accolade working in an industry where so often the fruits of your labors are derided and dismissed for being puerile or irresponsible. But in the case of ''The House Of The Dead: Overkill'', a little puerility was the order of business. Parodying the profane excess of grindhouse cinema was (game developer) Headstrong Games' objective and I am flattered that this record acknowledges that we not only rose to that challenge, but entirely exceeded it."&lt;ref&gt;[http://ca.news.yahoo.com/s/afp/090316/world/entertainment_britain_game_record_offbeat_1] {{dead link|date=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This record was beaten a year later by ''[[Mafia II]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Good|first=Owen|title=Guinness Gives Mafia II The F-Bomb Record|url=http://kotaku.com/5640174/guinness-gives-mafia-ii-the-f+bomb-record|publisher=Kotaku|accessdate=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Lockers''' (originally named '''The Campbell Lockers''') were a dance group formed by [[Toni Basil]] and [[Don Campbell (dancer)|Don "Campbellock" Campbell]] in 1971. Active throughout the 1970s, they were pioneers of street dance. Don Campbell is the founder of the [[Locking (dance)|locking dance style]], and originally, Locking was called The Campbellock - a style that was based on the dance and song that Don Campbell created. Toni Basil met Campbell at a club in 1971 and together they formed The Lockers as a dance group. Toni Basil also served as The Lockers' manager, and was responsible for staging the act. All the dancers contributed steps and choreography with their unique and individual styles. By 1975 they were "Dancing their way to stardom" on their own.&lt;ref name="Banes"&gt;Banes, Sally (1994) ''Writing Dancing in the Age of Postmodernism'', Wesleyan University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-8195-6268-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Individual members' contributions (as soloist performers) to the dance style and group image coupled with their unique presentation in staging and concept broke down many barriers.  It has been said on the reality dance competition ''[[So You Think You Can Dance (U.S. TV series)|So You Think You Can Dance]]'' that "The Lockers' emergence on the dance scene changed the face of dance not only for street dancers but for dance in general and has made [[street dance]] a true American art form."&lt;ref name="Banes"/&gt;

==Performances==
The Lockers' many television appearances include ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', ''[[Soul Train]]'', ''[[The Carol Burnett Show|Carol Burnett]]'', ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' and ''[[The Midnight Special (TV series)|The Midnight Special]]'' (Ohio Players performance). They have performed live on stage at [[Radio City Music Hall]], [[Carnegie Hall]], [[Disneyland]], The [[MGM Grand Las Vegas]], [[Harrah's Reno]], and [[Harrah's Lake Tahoe]]. The group was animated for their appearance in the 1982 film ''[[Hey Good Lookin' (film)|Hey Good Lookin']]'' directed by [[Ralph Bakshi]]. They appeared in commercials for Schlitz Malt Liquor and Billy Preston's "[[Nothing from Nothing (Billy Preston song)|Nothing From Nothing]]".

==Members==
From 1973 to 1976, The Lockers consisted of the following members:
*[[Don Campbell (dancer)|Don "Campbellock" Campbell]]
*[[Toni Basil|Toni "Mickey" Basil]]
*[[Fred Berry|Fred "Mr. Penguin" Berry]]
*Greg "Campbellock Jr" Pope{{ref|Pope|A}}
*Adolfo "[[Shabba-Doo]]" Quinones&lt;ref name="Herguth"&gt;Herguth, Bob (1987) "Shabba-Doo", ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', July 31, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;
*Bill "Slim the Robot" Williams
*Leo "Fluky Luke" Williamson
*Anthony "Tony Go Go" Foster


There were alternates who filled in for original members from time to time:

In mid 1976, three and a half years after the inception of The Lockers, Mr. Berry and Ms. Basil left the group amicably. At the end of 1976, dancer Tony "GO GO" Lewis Foster became an alternate member.

==Post-Lockers==
After The Lockers disbanded, group members continued to find success individually. Both Don Campbell and Toni Basil have received the "Living Legend of Hip Hop" award from Hip Hop International.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Living Legend |url=http://hiphopinternational.com/living-legend/ |accessdate=March 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Basil, who already had a successful career as a choreographer and actress prior to the Lockers, would go on to achieve pop music success with the Grammy nominated single "[[Mickey (song)|Mickey]]."

Adolfo Quinones starred as Ozone in the street dance films, ''[[Breakin']]'' and ''[[Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo]]''.&lt;ref name="Adamas"&gt;Adams, Michael (2010) "[http://www.heraldsun.com.au/entertainment/movies/michael-adams-discovers-top-ten-films-so-bad-theyre-actually-worth-watching/story-e6frf9h6-1225817381028 Michael Adams discovers top ten films so bad they're actually worth watching]", ''[[Herald Sun]]'', January 8, 2010, Retrieved 2010-01-22.&lt;/ref&gt; He also did the choreography for [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s "[[Who's That Girl World Tour|Who's That Girl]]" tour. His awards include the "Lifetime Achievement Award" for outstanding contributions to hip-hop from [[The Carnival: Choreographer's Ball]] and the Drama Critic's Circle Award for Best Choreography for the musical ''Standup Tragedy''.

Fred Berry would later find greater fame in the role of "Rerun" on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] sitcom ''[[What's Happening!!]]''. One episode would feature a performance by The Lockers (except for Toni Basil).  Berry also makes a cameo appearance in Toni Basil's "Shoppin' from A to Z" video.

{{As of|2011|12}} Leo "Fluky Luke" Williamson was attending classes with Ultimate Medical Academy, Tampa, Florida.

'''The Misshapes''' are a [[New York City]]-based creative collective composed of [[DJ]]s Leigh Lezark, Geordon Nicol, and Greg Krelenstein.

==Group history==

=== Night club years, 2003–2008 ===
Leigh Lezark met Geordon Nicol and Greg Krelenstein at college, and in 2003 they formed The Misshapes.  Beginning in 2004, the trio cultivated a large following when they brought the "Misshapes Dance Party" to downtown New York City.  The name was taken from the title of a [[Pulp (band)|Pulp]] song, "''Mis-Shapes''."{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}  The party was first hosted at 21 Seventh Avenue South in the [[West Village]] of New York City.  Geordon and Leigh had to lie about their ages as well as falsify resumes to obtain access to the space at the time.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

==Group's career==
With the help of the Internet, the party's popularity grew within the fashion, music and art scene.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}  In 2005, following a performance by [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and [[Stuart Price]], Misshapes experienced continued capacity issues and the party was moved to [[SoHo]] club, Don Hill's.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}  At its new location, the event, as well as the DJs, enjoyed growing success. Downtown it-kids and celebrities partied together. Creative DIY-style flyers were created and sent around. A big part of the Misshapes party is its accompanying website, Misshapes.com. Early adopters of social media, the Misshapes posted weekly photos of the party, as well as portraits taken against a white wall.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

DJs and Live performers included: [[Agyness Deyn]], [[Alexandre Herchcovitch]], [[Arcade Fire]], [[Bloc Party]], [[Cassie (singer)|Cassie]], [[Chromeo]], [[Cory Kennedy]], [[David Byrne]], [[Dash Snow]], [[Dev Hynes]], [[The Drums]], [[Felix da Housecat]], [[Franz Ferdinand (band)|Franz Ferdinand]], [[Gareth Pugh]], [[Gemma Ward]], [[The Gossip]], [[Hedi Slimane]], [[Henry Holland (fashion designer)|Henry Holland]], [[The Horrors]], [[Hot Hot Heat]], [[Interpol (band)|Interpol]], [[James Iha]], [[Jarvis Cocker]], [[Jeremy Scott]], [[Junior Sanchez]], [[Junior Senior]], [[Kelis]], [[Kelly Osbourne]], [[The Killers]], [[Klaxons]], [[Lady Sovereign]], [[Ladytron]], [[Lady Miss Kier]], [[Le Tigre]], [[Lily Donaldson]], [[M.I.A. (artist)|M.I.A]], Madonna, [[MSTRKRFT]], Nan Golden, [[Patrick Wolf]], [[Peaches (musician)|Peaches]], [[Pharrell Williams]], [[The Rapture (band)|The Rapture]], [[Rilo Kiley]], [[Rufus Wainwright]], [[Selma Blair]], [[Sienna Miller]], [[Siouxsie Sioux]], [[The Sounds]], [[Steve Aoki]],  [[The Strokes]], [[These New Puritans]], [[Uffie]], [[The Virgins]], [[Yeah Yeah Yeahs]], and [[Yoko Ono]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

After a 5-year run, the trio decided to discontinue Misshapes as a weekly party, but continued to produce special Misshapes events in new locations.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

== Book ==
The Misshapes also expanded into publishing with the release of their eponymous stylebook.  The book contains almost 300 pages of fashion portraits and over 2,500 images with photography by Julian Gilbert, [[Karl Lagerfeld]], [[Leigh Lezark]], Nick Haymes, Miguel Villalobos, [[Patrick McMullan]], [[Ryan McGinley]], Ryan Pfluger, Scott Meriam and [[Yeah Yeah Yeahs]] [[guitar]]ist [[Nick Zinner]].  The book's introduction is written by "Vogue" magazine and Vogue.com editor Sally Singer and additional text by writer [[Legs McNeil]], and [[Pulp (band)|Pulp]] frontman, [[Jarvis Cocker]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1576873811 ''Misshapes'']; MTV Press; retrieved .&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sound design ==
In 2008, the Misshapes began designing the soundtracks to the first fashion shows of London based designer Henry Holland.  Since then the Misshapes have provided runway soundtracks for designers including [[Adidas Originals]], [[Bill Blass]], [[Calvin Klein]], [[Costello Tagliapietra]], [[Cynthia Rowley]], [[Diesel (brand)|Diesel]] Black Gold, [[Jeremy Scott]], Karl Lagerfeld, [[Rachel Zoe]], [[Sophia Kokosalaki]], [[Tory Burch]], [[Viktor &amp; Rolf]] and [[Zac Posen]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

'''''The Painted Veil''''' is a 1934 American drama directed by [[Richard Boleslawski]] and starring [[Greta Garbo]]. The film was produced by [[Hunt Stromberg]] for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. Based on the 1925 novel ''[[The Painted Veil (novel)|The Painted Veil]]'' by [[W. Somerset Maugham]], with a screenplay by [[John Meehan (screenwriter)|John Meehan]], [[Salka Viertel]], and Edith Fitzgerald, the film is about a woman who accompanies her new husband to China while he conducts medical research. Feeling neglected by her husband, the woman soon falls in love with a handsome diplomatic attaché. The film score was by Herbert Stothart, the cinematography by [[William H. Daniels]], the art direction by [[Cedric Gibbons]], and the costume design by [[Adrian (costume designer)|Adrian]]. The film earned $1,658,000 at the box office.

==Plot==
After her sister Olga marries and leaves home, Katrin Koerber, the daughter of an Austrian medical professor, fights loneliness and dreams of a more exciting life outside Austria.  Consequently, when Dr. Walter Fane, a British bacteriologist, asks her to marry him and move to Hong Kong, she agrees, even though she is not in love with him.

As soon as the newlyweds arrive in Hong Kong, however, Walter becomes consumed with his medical work, and Katrin becomes the romantic target of Jack Townsend, the unhappily married attaché to the British embassy.  While showing her the city's exotic sights, Jack flirts with Katrin and kisses her.  Katrin, unnerved by Jack's actions, retreats to her house, but soon rejoins him to observe local dancers performing at a Buddhist festival.  Stimulated by the dancing and the atmosphere of a Buddhist temple, Jack confesses his love to Katrin, and Katrin admits that she is not in love with Walter.

At home, Katrin then treats Walter coolly and reveals that his chronic lateness and fatigue annoy her. To make amends, Walter comes home early the next day, but discovers Katrin's bedroom door locked and Jack's hat on a table.  That evening, Walter confronts Katrin with his suspicions, and she admits that she loves Jack.  Distraught, Walter tells Katrin that he will grant her a divorce only if Jack promises in writing that he will divorce his wife and marry her.  When Katrin presents Walter's conditions to Jack, he tells her that a divorce would ruin both his career and his reputation and backs out of the affair.

Heartbroken, Katrin reluctantly accompanies Walter to an inland region of China, where a [[cholera]] epidemic is raging.  While Walter struggles to arrest the epidemic, Katrin grows more and more despondent and lonely.  Eventually, Walter's inundation in the death and destruction wrought by the epidemic causes him to see his resentment toward Katrin as insignificant.  He tells her that he still loves her and will end her suffering by sending her back to Hong Kong, while he prepares to leave for a remote river village that has been identified as the root of the epidemic.  She replies that although she is still conflicted in her feelings for Jack, she nonetheless now understands what a good man Walter is and that she's ashamed of having cuckolded him.

After Walter has left, Jack realizes his genuine love for Katrin and leaves Hong Kong for the inland.  Walter returns from the village after ordering it to be burned to combat the spread of the disease.  He is overjoyed to find that Katrin has remained to help young cholera victims at a local orphanage, rather than returning to Hong Kong.  Walter is knifed in the melee when villagers riot over having their houses burned and Katrin rushes to be near him.  While waiting to see her husband, Katrin is confronted by Jack, but tells him that she now loves only Walter and at last understands the sacrifices he makes for medicine.  After Jack departs, Katrin assures the wounded Walter that she at last has fallen in love with him.

So far, only the Executive Committee and the Community Council has been officially announced.&lt;ref name="executive_committee" /&gt;&lt;ref name="community_council_results" /&gt;

The Executive Committees purpose is to assist, direct and act as ambassadors for UK eSports to the wider public.

*Stuart Saw - eSports Commentator, [[QuadV]].

Also on the board for the Community Council is Ray Mia, who sits in as the permanent Executive Committee members of the Council and Peter Simpson as the Senior Operational Manager.

The Ethics Commission is charged with defining and updating a framework of ethical principles, including a Code of Ethics &amp; Conduct, based upon the values and principles enshrined in the UKeSA Charter.&lt;ref name="internal_structure" /&gt;

The Players Association is a separate entity that is supported by the UKeSA. This body, once established will be permanently represented on the Ethics Commission.&lt;ref name="internal_structure" /&gt;

== General Assembly ==

Meetings are set up between the Executive Committee, Community Council, Ethics Commission, Players Association and other leading figures among the government, the eSports community (such as the [[International eSports Federation]]) and video games industry. Held three times a year, these meetings consist of debated issues concerning eSports in the United Kingdom, how they relate to operational aspects of UKeSA and the endorsement of the UKeSA Charter. The General Assembly is invitational only, with permanent membership endorsed by elective procedures.

== Competition structure ==

Competitions are split into three divisions, some of which will comprise a league and a cup tournament. Each of the divisions represent the different levels, citing grassroots amateur level to the professional level. There are three seasons per year, which last approximately three months per season. Teams from each division can face promotions and relegation depending on how they perform in each of the leagues during the season.&lt;ref name="eventstructure" /&gt; Throughout each of the seasons, a trophy cup tournament is held between teams of the Open and Championship Division.&lt;ref name="cup_tournament"&gt;van Manen, Hidde.

Cadred.org. Retrieved 21 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Competition finals of the Cup Tournament, Championship and Premiership divisions are hosted at a specially selected venue in the United Kingdom each season. Qualifying eSports teams are gathered to play against each other in offline, local area network (LAN) setups as opposed to online play in the initial stages of the tournament.&lt;ref name="final_dates_announced"&gt;Ivan, Tom.

The Open Division represents the grassroots of eSports and form part of the amateur competitions. Playing restrictions are set to a minimum standard and games are played for fun or for practise.&lt;ref name="eventstructure" /&gt; Because the Open Division is viewed as the amateur level of eSports, many teams that participate are generally those who have just started or want to determine whether they are suitable at competitive level before moving to the semi-professional side of eSports.

The Championship Division represents the semi-professional competition level. Teams that choose to play in this division are generally groups who wish to move to the next stage of eSports and play for financial gain. Many of these team are established and may have squads for each individual game/title. Teams can be promoted from this division into the Premiership Division, through participation. Support and training are given to teams to aid their development. Such training includes both management and business elements, which is seen as crucial to building a team into global brand.&lt;ref name="eventstructure" /&gt;

The Premiership Division represents the professional level. Teams are given retainers to support themselves and develop their internal infrastructure as well as business support and training. Teams can be demoted through participation of competitions and must follow guidelines and rules throughout their participation.&lt;ref name="eventstructure" /&gt;

A seasonal Cup Tournament is held between the teams of the Open Division and the Championship Division. Teams are required to pay to enter and games are then carried out online. The final remaining teams will face at an offline, [[local area network]] (LAN) event. Premiership Division teams are not allowed to enter.&lt;ref name="cup_tournament" /&gt;

== Teams ==

Currently, there are 13 selected eSports teams that represent the professional level of eSports. These teams participate in the UKeSA Premiership Division and play in different leagues that represent the video games they compete in.&lt;ref name="premiership_teams" /&gt; These teams are given media coverage through website editorials, terrestrial, satellite and cable television, internet protocol television and podcast. Business, management and financial support are given throughout the season, offering training managerial skills and business development, which will prepare the teams for sponsorships from companies like [[Dell]], [[Adidas]] and other major business companies. Retainers are paid to Premiership teams at the end of each season, which will give financial support they need to carry on pushing the team brand as a primary business.

The number of Championship Division teams are determined by several factors such as paid entry fees and completion of team data like video game user identification tags, with teams submitting themselves for the competition each season. These teams are working towards being promoted into the UKeSA Premiership Division, which will offer the team the support they need to get their brand off the ground. Teams in the UKeSA Championship Division are given limited support for business and management training, while financial support comes from winning the competition.

== Competitive Video Games ==

There are a total of 17 video game titles currently used throughout the different divisions. They consist from a range of [[first person shooters]], [[racing game|driving simulation]], [[fighting game|beat 'em ups]], [[real-time strategy]], [[sports simulation]] and [[Music video game#Rhythm games|rhythm action]] genres. Each of the video game titles have some element of competitive online and offline multiplayer modes, which allow the players to play against each other, specifically using competitive gaming rules set by UKeSA.&lt;ref name="games_list"&gt;Felix.

Goruchaf. Retrieved 2009-03-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

New video games titles are added when the eSports community requests for the inclusion in the competition. Titles are first placed into the Open Division to gauge the amount of sign-ups for that specific video game. If enough players register in the Open Division, UKeSA will move to include it into the semi-professional, Championship Division, where eSports athletes will be able to register to play for the prize fund. If a particular video game title is popular enough in the Championship Division, UKeSA will warrant that video game a place in the Premiership Division.

Not all video game titles are suitable for use in a competitive environment as certain video game titles do not allow private sessions hosted by the players via [[peer-to-peer]] or server-led gaming rooms. Such games include UbiSoft's [[Tom Clancy's EndWar|EndWar]], where online play is restricted to its open [[Tom Clancy's EndWar|Theatre of War]] lobby system.

A '''vicinal''' is a [[logology|logological]] term for a word where all its letters have "alphabetic neighbors".  For instance, if a word has an "O" in it, to be a vicinal it must also have an "N" and/or a "P".  If none of the letters have alphabetic neighbors, it is known as a nonvicinal.

The '''Wolf System''' was founded in 1988 by fight [[choreographer]] and [[stage combat]]/[[martial arts]] instructor  Tony Wolf. It has been applied to a range of production genres including professional [[theatre]], [[opera]], [[ballet]], [[film]], [[television]] and [[motion capture]], notably including ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' film trilogy, as well as to [[physical theater]], martial arts and [[self defense]] training.

== History ==

The Wolf System (under the name "Re:Action") was originally a collection of techniques adapted from [[professional wrestling]], [[historical fencing]], [[mime]] and various [[martial arts]] styles.  Over time, and due in part to the pedagogical influence of the [[modern dance]] discipline of [[contact improvisation]] and of the Russian martial art of Ryabko [[Systema]], the Wolf system's emphasis shifted from a curriculum of specific techniques to an open-ended progression of largely improvised training [[game]]s and [[exercises]].

The system was first introduced to the international community at the Paddy Crean International Stage Combat Conferences held at the [[Banff Centre]] in [[Alberta]], [[Canada]], in 1998.  Since that time, aspects of the system have been taught to [[actor]]s, [[Theatre director|directors]], martial artists, [[dancers]], [[choreographers]] and [[stunt]] performers throughout [[New Zealand]], [[Australia]], Canada and the [[United States|U.S.]], as well as at master-class seminars in [[England]], [[Ireland]], [[Norway]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Italy]] and [[Germany]].

== Philosophy and pedagogy ==

The Wolf System is designed to teach a series of fundamental [[motion (physics)|movement]] and/or [[performance]] skills. 

The skills are divided into the following categories:

'''Synergy''' - non-verbal, especially [[Touch|tactile]] responsiveness and communication 

'''Articulation''' - cycles of preparation, action and reaction in performing stage combat techniques, both for the safety of the performers and for clarity of live or on-camera performance

'''Illusion''' - methods of misdirection and of concealing certain safety measures from the audience or camera to preserve the [[illusion]] of actual [[combat]]

'''Alignment''' - methods of skeletal alignment supported by muscular control as used in maintaining balance and in supporting another person's body weight

'''Extension''' - methods of projecting momentum

'''Cascade''' - methods of safely moving from a standing position to the floor by collapsing or rolling 

'''Measure''' - methods of judging the active distance between oneself and another person

Of the above list, both Articulation and Illusion are specific to the use of the Wolf System in stage combat training. The two fundamental premises of the Wolf System in stage combat are defined as Safety and Storytelling, both with reference to performance combat as a skill of theatrical illusion.

== Wolf System exercises ==
 
Some of the games and exercises may be performed individually while others may be performed in pairs or by groups of up to twenty people.  

Participants in this form of training constantly alternate between co-operating and competing with their partner(s) during different exercises. [[Co-operative]] games require the participants to work together to achieve a specific result, such as balancing against each other's bodies while in physically awkward positions or keeping their hands in contact while performing various improvised movement exercises.  [[Competitive]] games require the participants to work against each other, as in contests of balance and speed.

Participants also alternate between moving "in character" and as themselves, between improvised and choreographed exercises and between assuming active and passive [[roles]] during the various exercises.

To perform Wolf System exercises with a partner or in a group environment is known as [[Jam session|jamming]], a term borrowed from contact improvisation and from [[jazz]].

The Wolf System can be used to introduce [[combative]] concepts and skills to students who may not have any previous background in fencing, martial arts or related disciplines.  Also, the open-ended nature of the exercises allow participants to experiment with a wide range of unusual fighting techniques and styles, including many that are not typically offered in more orthodox stage combat or martial arts training programs.
