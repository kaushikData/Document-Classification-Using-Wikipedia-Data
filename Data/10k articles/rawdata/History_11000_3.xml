'''''Atlantis''''' is an album by American jazz musician [[Sun Ra]] and his Astro-Infinity Arkestra, released in 1969 by [[El Saturn Records]].

The album heavily features the "Solar Sound Instrument", a [[Clavinet|Hohner Clavinet]]. One of the four compositions which originally featured on Side 1 of the original release was substituted by a different piece for the 1973 reissue, though reusing the same name, "Yucatan". Both pieces appear on the later CD reissue.

The title track covered the second side of the LP and is regarded as a key prototype for Sun Ra's performances through the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Litweiler, John| title=The Freedom Principle: Jazz After 1958 | publisher=Da Capo | year=1984|isbn=0-306-80377-1|page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was recorded at a 1967 concert at the [[Babatunde Olatunji|Olatunji]] Center of African Culture in New York &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Szwed, John F| title=Space is the Place | publisher=Payback Press | year=1997|isbn=0-86241-722-8|page=248}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been described as "a masterpiece that twists and turns through many soundscapes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=McLaren, Trevor |publisher=All About Jazz|title =Sun Ra: Atlantis| url =http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=580 | date = 2003-10-03| accessdate = 2008-03-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;'[The title track ''Atlantis'' is] one of Ra's most epic pieces, which is free or "space" jazz at its most invigorating. While virtually indescribable, the sonic churnings and juxtaposed images reveal a brilliant display of textures and tonalities set against an ocean of occasional rhythms. Its diversity alone makes this is an essential entry in the voluminous Sun Ra catalog.' Lindsay Planer &lt;ref&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r148326/review|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Recording sessions==
Side one was likely recorded at Sun Studios, New York (the Arkestra's commune) between 1967 and 1969;&lt;ref name="campbell"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100316044924/http://homepage.uab.edu/moudry/disc_b.htm#35. Sun Ra's Discography, R Campbell]&lt;/ref&gt; The title track on side two, Atlantis was recorded at the Olatunji Cultural Center on 125th Street, NY, in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.villagevoice.com/2006-05-30/music/the-sun-ra-guide/ John Szwed, Village Voice]&lt;/ref&gt; A different piece, similarly titled Yucatan was also recorded at the same period and later included for the Impulse reissue in 1973. Both versions of ''Yucatan'' were included when a record label, Evidence reissued Atlantis in the 1990s. This arrangement remained when Sun Ra's entire back catalog was remastered and reissued by Ra's estate (under the supervision of [[Irwin Chusid]]) in 2014.

[[Image:Badge 1012.jpg|thumb|[[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey Police Department]] badge]]
A '''badge''' is a device or accessory, often containing the insignia of an organization, which is presented or displayed to indicate some feat of service, a special accomplishment, a symbol of authority granted by taking an oath (e.g., police and fire), a sign of legitimate employment or student status, or as a simple means of identification. They are also used in advertising, publicity, and for branding purposes. Police badges date back to medieval times when knights wore a coat of arms representing their allegiances and loyalty.

Badges can be made from [[metal]], [[plastic]], [[leather]], [[textile]], [[natural rubber|rubber]], etc., and they are commonly attached to clothing, bags, [[footwear]], vehicles, home electrical equipment, etc. [[Textile badges]] or patches can be either woven or embroidered, and can be attached by gluing, ironing-on, sewing or applique.

Badges have become highly collectable: in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], for example, the Badge Collectors' Circle has been in existence since 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.badgecollectorscircle.co.uk/history#1980-1984 | title = The history of the Badge Collectors Circle | accessdate = 2011-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[military]], badges are used to denote the unit or arm to which the wearer belongs, and also qualifications received through military training, rank, etc. Similarly, youth organizations such as [[scouting]] and guiding use them to show group membership, awards and rank.

==History==
Badges were popular as jewellery in the [[Middle Ages]], and varied from extremely expensive works of jewellery, like the [[Dunstable Swan Jewel]], to simple mold-made badges in lead or other base metals. Specialized forms were the [[pilgrim badge]], worn by those who had completed a [[pilgrimage]], and [[heraldic badge|heraldic]] or [[livery badges]], worn to denote service or allegiance to a political figure — these last were especially popular in England, and became very controversial in the period leading up to the [[Wars of the Roses]].  One royal celebration in 1483 was marked by the distribution of 13,000 badges, a huge number relative to the population at the time.  Other types were funerary badges, presumably presented to mourners for the funeral of important figures, and simple decorative badges with animals or hearts.  The grandest form of badge was worn as a pendant to a metal collar, often in gold or [[silver-gilt]]. 

From the livery badge, various badges of service evolved, worn by officials, soldiers and servants. In the [[British Army]] a metal (today often plastic) [[cap badge]] denoting the soldier's [[regiment]] became standard by the 17th century, as in most European armies (though not always navies).  By the 19th century a badge was an almost invariable part of any [[uniform]], including [[school uniform]]s, which in the UK usually still feature the school's badge in cloth on the breast pocket of the jacket or [[blazer]].

==Various uses==
One of the best-known badges is the typically star-shaped [[Sheriffs in the United States|U.S. sheriff]]'s badge, made famous in [[Western (genre)|Westerns]]. The [[Chairman Mao badge]] is probably the most famous political badge. Members of [[fraternities]] and [[sororities]] often refer to the pins that signify their membership as badges.

[[File:A Badge Pinning.jpg|thumb|Badge pinning]]

The [[BBC]] children's programme [[Blue Peter]] also awards its own "[[Blue Peter badge]]" to members of the public who appear on the show. These are highly collectable as they cannot be bought—except from people who have been awarded one and wish to sell it.

Case badges are thick, about {{convert|3|mm|abbr=on}} deep, {{convert|3|x|3|cm|adj=on}} [[lucite]] stickers that are often packaged with various computer parts, such as processors and video cards. Modern computer cases are frequently embellished with an indentation on the case's front panel to facilitate the affixing of a case badge. 

Button badges are a highly collectible round badge with a plastic coating over a design or image. They often have a metal pin back or a safety pin style back. The most popular size is {{convert|25.4|mm|adj=on}} but the badges can range anywhere from this size right up to {{convert|120|mm|adj=on}} badges. This style of badge is used in [[political campaigning]] and often given as part of a birthday greeting such as a [[birthday card]].

In the United States, the badges used by [[law enforcement]], [[Fire guard|fire]], and [[security guards]] are usually made of metal in various colors and finishes and are worn above the left chest pocket on the uniform shirt or jacket. [[Detective]]s and other [[Undercover|plainclothes personnel]] may wear them on a belt holder, or on a chain around the neck. Shapes are manifold, with [[municipal]] [[police]] departments tending to have some variation of a shield shape, and sheriff's departments usually going with a 5, 6, or 7 point star shape. In most cases, an enameled seal of the organization, city, county, or company can be found in the center of the badge.

In [[computing]], badges are used to demonstrate skills.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wiki.mozilla.org/Badges Mozilla Open Badges Project]&lt;/ref&gt; In education, [[digital badges]] are used as alternative forms of credentials, similar to those being used in the MacArthur Foundation's Badges for Lifelong Learning initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://hastac.org/competitions  | title = Badges for Lifelong Learning | accessdate = 2012-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://dmlcompetition.net/Competition/4/badges-about.php  | title = About the Badges for Lifelong Learning initiative | accessdate = 2012-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christian Magnus Falsen''' (14 September 1782 – 13 January 1830) was a [[Norway|Norwegian]] constitutional father, statesman, [[jurist]], and historian. He was an important member of the  [[Norwegian Constituent Assembly]]  and was one of the writers of the [[Constitution of Norway]].

==Biography==
Christian Magnus Falsen was born at [[Oslo|Christiania]], now Oslo, Norway. He was the son of [[Enevold de Falsen]] (1755–1808), a dramatist and author of a  war song ''Til vaaben''. In 1802, he graduated with a degree in law at the [[University of Copenhagen]]. In 1807, Christian Magnus Falsen was appointed a barrister. In 1808 he became circuit judge at [[Follo]] in [[Akershus]], Norway.&lt;ref&gt;[https://nbl.snl.no/Christian_Magnus_Falsen ''Christian Magnus Falsen, Embedsperson og Politiker'' (Norsk biografisk leksikon)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eidsvoll1814.no/?aid=9061021&amp;selected=9062045 ''Christian Magnus Falsen'' (Eidvoll 1812)]&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Denmark]] ceded [[Norway]] to [[Sweden]] in 1814 he played an important part in politics.  Falsen led the Independent Party (''Selvstendighetspartiet'') that wanted complete independence and was prepared to resist Sweden militarily. He upheld [[Christian VIII of Denmark|King Christian Frederick]] and, after the separation of Norway from Denmark, assisted in drafting a constitution for Norway. This document was modeled upon that adopted by [[France]] in 1791 and which was approved on 17 May 1814 by the [[Norwegian Constituent Assembly]] (''Riksforsamlingenat'')  at [[Eidsvoll]]. He was also strongly inspired by [[Thomas Jefferson]] and the [[Constitution of the United States of America]]. He is often called Father of the Norwegian Constitution — ''Grunnlovens far''.
&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.stortinget.no/no/Stortinget-og-demokratiet/Historikk/Historiske-biografier/https://www.stortinget.no/no/Stortinget-og-demokratiet/Historikk/Historiske-biografier/Christian-Magnus-Falsen---Grunnlovens-far//https://www.stortinget.no/no/Stortinget-og-demokratiet/Historikk/Historiske-biografier/ ''Christian Magnus Falsen- Grunnlovens far''  (Stortinget)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://partileksikon.blogspot.com/2009/01/selvstendighetspartiet.html ''Selvstendighetspartiet'' (Norsk partipolitisk leksikon)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Falsen held a seat in the [[Storting]] and generally favored conservative political positions.  In 1822 he was appointed Attorney General of the Kingdom, a post which he held for three years.  In 1825 he became [[bailiff]] for [[Bergen]], and in 1827 president of the Supreme Court. In 1828 he suffered from a stroke and did not return to the office. Christian Magnus Falsen is buried at Gamlebyen Churchyard. Next to his gravestone is the gravestone of his second wife.

In 1804 he married Anna Birgitte Munch (1787-1810), with whom he had the son Enevold Munch Falsen (1810–80). In 1811, after her death, he married Elisabeth Severine Böckmann (1782-1848). She was the widow of Brede Stoltenberg, a brother of the tradesman Gregers Stoltenberg. With her he had the children Henrik Anton Falsen (1813–66) and Elisabeth Christine Falsen (1820–76).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hemneslekt.net/familygroup.php?familyID=F31020&amp;tree=Hemne ''Familie: Christian Magnus Falsen/Elisabeth Severine Bøckmann'' (Hemneslekt)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Clonoe Ambush''' was a military action between the [[British Army]] and the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] that occurred during [[The Troubles]] in Northern Ireland. On 16 February 1992 an IRA unit attacked the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] security base at the village of [[Coalisland]] in [[County Tyrone]], and was ambushed shortly afterwards by the [[Special Air Service Regiment]] in the grounds of a church at the village of [[Clonoe]] whilst attempting to make its escape, resulting in several IRA fatalities.

From 1985 onwards, the [[Provisional IRA East Tyrone Brigade|IRA in East Tyrone]] had been at the forefront of a campaign against British state police and army facilities and their personnel. In 1987 an East Tyrone IRA unit [[Loughgall ambush|was ambushed with eight of its members being killed]] by the SAS while they were making an attack upon a police station in [[Loughgall]], [[County Armagh]]. This was the IRA's greatest loss of life in a single incident during [[The Troubles]]. Despite these losses the IRA's campaign continued, with it attacking nearly 100 police and military facilities over the next five years, wrecking thirty three and damaging to varying degrees the remainder.&lt;ref&gt;Toolis, Kevin (1995). ''Rebel Hearts: journeys within the IRA's soul''. Picador, p. 53; {{ISBN|0-330-34243-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SAS ambush had no noticeable long-term effect on the level of IRA activity in East Tyrone. In the two years before the Loughgall ambush the IRA killed seven people in East Tyrone and North Armagh, and eleven in the two years following the ambush.&lt;ref&gt;Urban, Mark (1992).

Three other IRA members — Gerard Harte, Martin Harte and Brian Mullin — had been ambushed and killed by the SAS as they tried to kill an off-duty [[Ulster Defence Regiment]] soldier near [[Carrickmore]], County Tyrone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nuzhound.com/articles/irish_news/arts2003/sep12_DUP_protest_IRA_commemoration.php DUP slams GAA club IRA commemoration] Newshound 27 September 2003&lt;/ref&gt; British intelligence identified them as the perpetrators of the [[Ballygawley bus bombing]], which killed eight British soldiers.

On 3 June 1991, three IRA men, Lawrence McNally, Michael "Pete" Ryan and Tony Doris, were killed at the town of [[Coagh]], when a stolen car they were driving in on their way to kill an off-duty Ulster Defence Regiment soldier was ambushed by the Special Air Service. Ryan was the same man who according to Irish journalist and author [[Ed Moloney]] had led an [[attack on Derryard checkpoint]] on the orders of [[IRA Army Council]] member [[Thomas Murphy (Irish republican)|'Slab' Murphy]] two years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Moloney, Ed (2003).

==The ambush==
At 10.30 P.M. during the night of 16 February 1992, a stolen car and lorry carrying multiple IRA attackers drove into the centre of the village of [[Coalisland]] and, pulling up at its fortified Royal Ulster Constabulary security base, fired 30 rounds of armour-piercing [[tracer ammunition]] into it at close range from a [[Soviet Union]] made [[DSHK]] heavy machine-gun that they had mounted on the back of the lorry. The heavy machine gun was fired by IRA member Kevin O'Donnell, the rest of the unit being armed with Soviet made [[AKM]] machine-guns. The IRA attackers then drove off at speed away up Annagher hill, without any apparent pursuit from the security forces. Whilst making their escape they drove past the home of Tony Doris, an IRA man who had been killed by the British Army the previous year, where they stopped to fire into the air, shouting: "Up the 'RA, that's for Tony Doris!". After this they drove on at speed to the car park of St. Patrick's Roman Catholic Church in the village of [[Clonoe]], two miles away from Coalisland police station, arriving at 10.45 P.M., where getaway cars were waiting. Immediately on arrival the IRA attackers were in the process of preparing to abandon the attack vehicles and dismounting the DShk to take with them when they were assailed by a British Army detachment that had been lying in wait for them in the car park's perimeter, primarily composed of soldiers from the Special Air Service, which raked them with sustained automatic fire. Patrick Vincent (20 years of age), the driver of the stolen lorry, was shot dead with five bullets whilst still in its cab. Peter Clancy (19) (hit by ten bullets) and Kevin O'Donnell (21) (shot twice) were killed whilst dismounting the DShk on the back of the lorry. Sean O'Farrell (23) was pursued on foot across the church grounds over a distance of 100 yards before being shot dead with five bullets whilst trying to clamber over a fence. Two other IRA men, one of them being Aidan McKeever, who were found sitting in a car in the car park with the intention of acting as getaway drivers, surrendered after being wounded and were taken prisoner.&lt;ref&gt;'Ambush, Assassination &amp; Impunity', (Pub.

Several witnesses to the ambush later claimed that some of the IRA men tried to surrender to the British Army engaging unit during the ambush, but were [[summarily executed]].&lt;ref name=obrien&gt;O'Brien, pp. 232–35&lt;/ref&gt; Mr Justice Treacy of Northern Ireland's [[Courts of Northern Ireland#High Court|High Court]] awarded McKeever, the IRA getaway driver, ₤75,000 in damages in 2011. It is unclear whether or not this decision was appealed, or whether the damages were ever paid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tyronetimes.co.uk/news/tyrone-news/getaway-driver-s-compensation-award-was-unfathomable-1-3163204 Aidan McKeever, IRA getaway driver, awarded ₤75,000 by Justice Treacy], bbc.co.uk; accessed 19 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internal IRA criticism===
A local IRA source pointed out a several areas of incompetence in the attack by the IRA unit involved that led to its destruction:

* The use of a long-range weapon for a short-range shooting. The DShK could be used up to 2,000 meters from the target, and its armour-piercing capabilities at 1,500 meters are still considerable.
* The use of tracer rounds was ill-judged as they easily reveal the firing location of the gun if it is not being fired from well-hidden position.
*The escape route was chosen at random, with the machine-gun in full sight and the support vehicle flashing its hazard lights.
*The gathering of so many men at the same place after such an attack was another factor in the failure to escape for most of the attacking force.&lt;ref name=obrien/&gt;

==Aftermath==
During the funeral services for O'Donnell and O'Farrell in Coalisland, the parish priest criticised the security forces for what happened at Clonoe church, which had resulted in the deaths of the four IRA men. The priest, Fr. MacLarnon, then appealed to the IRA and Sinn Fein to replace "the politics of confrontation with the politics of cooperation".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pf6BAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT290&amp;lpg=PT290&amp;dq=Father+MacLarnon+of+Tyrone&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0Sny6ftiRW&amp;sig=UBLXoilF2s4fmKdKK0ZiOUCotpw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAWoVChMInqDd9Iu2xwIVyKseCh17PwFf#v=onepage&amp;q=Father%20MacLarnon%20of%20Tyrone&amp;f=false Father MacLarnon comments at O'Donnell/O'Farrell funerals], books.google.com; accessed 19 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; While [[Francis Molloy]], a local [[Sinn Féin]] councillor, walked out of the church in protest, leading Sinn Fein politicians [[Gerry Adams]] and [[Martin McGuinness]] remained in their seats. There were hundreds of Royal Ulster Constabulary police officers outside the church during the funeral, the RUC having changed its policy after the recent [[Milltown Cemetery attack]]. This show of force was criticised by Sinn Fein.&lt;ref name=obrien/&gt;

This was the last occasion that IRA members were killed in a series of ambushes by the British Army of IRA attacks, spearheaded by the Special Air Service Regiment in Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Peter (2001).

Bloomsbury Publishing, p. 306. {{ISBN|0-7475-5806-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Growing tension between local IRA supporters and the British military foot-patrols led to [[Coalisland riots (1992)|street confrontations]] with soldiers from the [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|Parachute Regiment]] three months later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/1992/0528/28051.html|title=British Take Paratroopers Off Ulster Security Detail|date=1992-05-28|work=Christian Science Monitor|access-date=2018-06-22|issn=0882-7729}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cornelius Hazart''' (28 October 1617 &amp;ndash; 25 October 1690) was a Belgian [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] priest, controversialist, [[Sacred orator|orator]] and writer of polemical history.

==Life==
Hazart was born at [[Oudenaarde]] in the [[County of Flanders]].  He entered the [[Society of Jesus]] on 24 September 1634 and was ordained [[Catholic priest|priest]], 6 April 1647, at [[Louvain, Belgium|Louvain]], where he had already the reputation of ''perfectus orator''. He made his [[religious profession]] on 1 November 1651; and preached during a period of thirty-six years, for a time at [[Dunkirk]] and [[Brussels]], then permanently at [[Antwerp]], where he died.

Hazart's life, apart from the duties of his pastoral office, was almost exclusively taken up with his struggle against the [[Calvinist]]s of the [[Low Countries]]. His "Epistola ad Langravium Hassiæ-Rheinfeldtium" suggests some activity in Germany too. He delivered, at the church of the [[professed house]] at [[Antwerp]], a series of sermons on controversial questions. Some of these he preached in the '[[Grote Markt (Antwerp)|Grote markt]]' (main market-place) of Antwerp, there for the festivities held in connection with church dedication services. His sacred [[eloquence]] attracted [[Calvinism|Calvinists]] too.

==Works==

[[Sommervogel]] enumerates about ninety writings of his, chiefly in Flemish. The "Kerckelycke Historie van de gheheele werelt" (''Ecclesiastical history of the whole world''), 4 vols. (Antwerp, 1667–71) was translated into [[High German]] and enlarged by other Jesuits, under the title "Kirchengeschichte, das ist katholiches Christendum, durch die ganze Welt verbreitet".

All of Hazart's writings are [[Apologetics|apologetic]] and polemical in character. They treat of controversial questions: [[Holy Mass]], the [[Real Presence]] of Christ in the Blessed Sacrament, the invocation and veneration of the saints, the force of good works, auricular confession, extreme [[Unction of God|unction]], [[purgatory]], [[idolatry]], the primacy and authority of the pope, the [[Roman catechism]]. Hazart relied on [[Sacred Scripture|Scripture]] and the early [[Church Fathers]]: he was quick to refute, but himself was flawed.

In the case of Schuler, he contented himself with a "Vriendelyke t'saemen-spraek tuschen D. Joannes Schulen Predicant tot Breda ende P. C. Hazart" (''A friendly colloquy between John Schuler, preacher of Breda, and P. C. Hazart''). Many of his writings, such as "Triomph de pausen van Roomen" (''Triumph of the pope of Rome''), gave rise to a controversial literature.

{{redirect|Cult classic|the album by Blue Öyster Cult|Cult Classic{{!}}''Cult Classic''}}
A '''cult following''' is a group of [[Fan (person)|fans]] who are highly dedicated to a work of [[culture]], often referred to as a '''cult classic'''. A film, book, musical artist, television series or video game, among other things, is said to have a cult following when it has a small but very passionate fanbase. A common component of cult followings is the emotional attachment the fans have to the object of the cult following, often identifying themselves and other fans as members of a [[community]]. Cult followings are also commonly associated with niche markets. Cult media are often associated with [[Subculture|underground culture]], and are considered too [[:wikt:eccentric|eccentric]] or [[anti-establishment|subversive]] to be appreciated by the [[general public]] or to be commercially successful.

Many cult fans {{clarify span|express a certain [[irony]] about their devotion.|reason=This phrasing goes back to versions of this article from 2010, and was intended to describe ironic appreciation for things generally considered bad, like movies made by Ed Wood. If this sentiment is still of value in the article, it needs to be clarified, since it lacks sufficient context.|date=November 2017}} Sometimes, these cult followings cross the border to [[camp (style)|camp]] followings. Fans may become involved in a [[subculture]] of [[fandom]], either via [[Fan convention|conventions]], [[online communities]] or through activities such as writing [[Fan fiction|series-related fiction]], costume creation, replica prop and model building, or creating their own audio or video productions from the formats and characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cult.tv |title=The Official Cult TV Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forms==

===Film===
{{main|Cult film}}
There is not always a clear difference between cult and [[mainstream]] media. Franchises such as ''[[Star Trek]]'', ''[[Star Wars]]'', ''[[Doctor Who]]'', ''[[Harry Potter (film series)|Harry Potter]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[Game of Thrones]]'', ''[[The Rocky Horror Show|Rocky Horror]]'', ''[[Clueless (film)|Clueless]]'', ''[[Ethel &amp; Ernest (film)|Ethel &amp; Ernest]]'', ''[[Batman in film#The Dark Knight Trilogy (2005–2012) – Christopher Nolan|The Dark Knight]]'' and ''[[Mean Girls]]'' attract mass audiences but also have core groups of fanatical followers. Professors Xavier Mendik and Ernest Mathijs, authors of ''100 Cult Films'', argue that the devoted following among these films make them cult classics. In many cases, films that have cult followings may have been financial flops during their theatrical box office run, and even received mixed or mostly negative reviews by mainstream media, but still be considered a major success by small core groups or communities of fans devoted to such films.

Some cults are only popular within a certain [[subculture]]. The film ''[[Woodstock (film)|Woodstock]]'' (1969) is especially loved within the [[hippie]] subculture, while ''[[Hocus Pocus (1993 film)|Hocus Pocus]]'' (1993) holds cult status among American women born in the 1980s. Certain [[mainstream]] icons can become cult icons in a different context for certain people. ''[[Reefer Madness]]'' (1936) was originally intended to warn youth against the use of [[marijuana]], but because of its ridiculous plot, overwhelming amount of factual errors and cheap look, it is now often watched by audiences of [[cannabis smoking|marijuana-smokers]] and has gained a cult following.&lt;ref name="Peary"&gt;{{cite book |last=Peary |first=Danny |authorlink= |title=Cult Movies |year=1981 |publisher=Delacorte Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-440-01626-7 |pages=203–205|title-link=Cult Movies (book) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Quentin Tarantino]]'s films borrow stylistically from classic cult films, but are appreciated by a large audience, and therefore lie somewhere between cult and mainstream.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Certain cult phenomena can grow to such proportions that they become [[mainstream]].

===Television===
Many cancelled television series (especially ones that had a short run life) see new life in a fan following. One notable example is ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]'', which was cancelled after three seasons and, because of the large fanbase, returned for a 15-episode season which was released on Netflix on May 26, 2013. ''[[Futurama]]'' is another notable series that was originally put on permanent hiatus after its initial 72-episode run. Strong DVD sales and consistent ratings on [[Cartoon Network]]'s [[Adult Swim]] block led to four direct-to-DVD films which, in turn, led to the revival of the series in 2010 on [[Comedy Central]] following Adult Swim's expiration of the broadcast rights. ''[[Space Ghost Coast to Coast]]'' had a cult following throughout its 10-year run on television, and help pave the wave of other shows of similar style, which also had cult followings, specifically ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]''. ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'' is highly notable in that it was cancelled after three seasons but later gained a cult following through [[broadcast syndication]] and ultimately spawned a [[Star Trek|media franchise]].

Another cancelled series that has attained cult status is the NBC teen dramedy ''[[Freaks and Geeks]]'' which had an 18-episode run. Another series that was cancelled but gained a second life with cult status is the FOX teen medical dramedy ''[[Red Band Society]]'' which had a 13-episode run. Other examples include ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'', ''[[Roswell (TV series)|Roswell]]'', ''[[Community (TV series)|Community]]'',  ''[[Joan of Arcadia]]'', ''[[Millennium (TV series)|Millennium]]'', ''[[Twin Peaks]]'', ''[[Veronica Mars]]'', ''[[Invasion (U.S. TV series)|Invasion]]'', ''[[Pushing Daisies]]'', ''[[Gargoyles (TV series)|Gargoyles]]'' and ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'', which had short lives, yet achieved large fanbases.

In a [[BBC]] review of ''[[Farscape]]'' episode "Throne for a Loss", Richard Manning said "''Farscape'' is now officially a cult series because it's being shown out of sequence". The episode in question was actually shown as the second episode, after the premiere; despite originally being intended as the fifth episode to be shown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/farscape/story/ep_2_review.shtml |publisher=[[BBC.co.uk]] |title=Throne to a loss |first=Richard |last=Manning |date=September 2005 |accessdate=18 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Series often considered cult classics include the long-running BBC series ''[[Doctor Who]]'' (1963–present), ''[[The Prisoner]]'' (1967–1968)&lt;ref name="DW"&gt;{{cite news|last=Nussbaum|first=Emily|title=Fantastic Voyage|work=The New Yorker|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/06/04/fantastic-voyage|date=June 2012|accessdate=January 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Prisoner"&gt;{{cite news|last=Jeffery|first=Morgan|title=The Prisoner: Cult classic TV series to be revived for new audio drama|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/news/a619443/the-prisoner-cult-classic-tv-series-to-be-revived-for-new-audio-drama/|date=January 5, 2015|accessdate=January 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Australian soap opera ''[[Prisoner (TV series)|Prisoner: Cell Block H]]'' (1979–1986).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.express.co.uk/showbiz/tv-radio/425875/Wentworth-Prison-Prisoners-return-to-cell-block-H| title=Wentworth Prison: Prisoners return to cell block H| publisher=[[Daily Express]]| date=31 August 2013| accessdate=8 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Video games ===
{{See also|List of cult video games}}
Some video games attract cult followings, which can influence the design of later video games. An example of a cult video game is ''[[Ico]]'' (2001), an initial commercial flop which gained a large following for its unique gameplay and [[Minimalism|minimalist]] aesthetics, and was noted as influencing the design of ''[[Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons]]'' (2013) and ''[[Rime (video game)|Rime]]'' (2017), among other games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2013/09/ico/|title=The Obscure Cult Game That's Secretly Inspiring Everything|work=WIRED|access-date=2018-03-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other games which have cult followings include ''[[EarthBound]]'' (1994), a commercial flop that later resulted in the creation of a "cottage industry" selling memorabilia to the [[EarthBound fandom|''EarthBound'' fandom]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usgamer.net/articles/giving-thanks-two-new-books-on-a-cult-classic-embody-gamings-rich-culture|title=Giving Thanks: Two New Books on a Cult Classic Embody Gaming's Rich Culture|website=USgamer.net|language=en|access-date=2018-03-11|date=2016-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scott Cawthon's [[Five Nights at Freddy's]] (2014), and ''[[Yume Nikki]]'' (2004), a surreal free-to-play Japanese [[horror game]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/1/10/16873602/yume-nikki-steam-download-new-project-dream-diary-sequel|title=A disturbing cult classic finally hits Steam, with a follow-up on the way|last=Frank|first=Allegra|date=2018-01-10|website=Polygon|access-date=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Darwin among the Machines'''" is the name of an article published in ''[[The Press]]'' newspaper on 13 June 1863 in [[Christchurch]], New Zealand, which references the work of [[Charles Darwin]] in the title. Written by [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]] but signed ''[[Cellarius (name)|Cellarius]]'' ([[q.v.]]), the article raised the possibility that [[machines]] were a kind of "mechanical life" undergoing constant [[evolution]], and that eventually machines might supplant humans as the dominant species:
{{quote|We refer to the question: What sort of creature man’s next successor in the supremacy of the earth is likely to be. We have often heard this debated; but it appears to us that we are ourselves creating our own successors; we are daily adding to the beauty and delicacy of their physical organisation; we are daily giving them greater power and supplying by all sorts of ingenious contrivances that self-regulating, self-acting power which will be to them what intellect has been to the human race. In the course of ages we shall find ourselves the inferior race.
...

Day by day, however, the machines are gaining ground upon us; day by day we are becoming more subservient to them; more men are daily bound down as slaves to tend them, more men are daily devoting the energies of their whole lives to the development of mechanical life. The upshot is simply a question of time, but that the time will come when the machines will hold the real supremacy over the world and its inhabitants is what no person of a truly philosophic mind can for a moment question.}}

The article ends by urging that, "War to the death should be instantly proclaimed against them. Every machine of every sort should be destroyed by the well-wisher of his species. Let there be no exceptions made, no quarter shown; let us at once go back to the primeval condition of the race."

==''Book of the Machines''==
Butler developed this and subsequent articles into ''The Book of the Machines'', three chapters of ''[[Erewhon]]'', published anonymously in 1872. The Erewhonian society Butler envisioned had long ago undergone a revolution that destroyed most mechanical inventions. The narrator of the story finds a book that details the reasons for this revolution, which he translates for the reader. In &lt;span style=
"font-variant:small-caps"&gt;
chapter xxiii: the book of the machines&lt;/span&gt;, a number of quotes from this imaginary book discuss the possibility of machine consciousness:
{{quote|"There is no security"--to quote his own words--"against the ultimate development of mechanical consciousness, in the fact of machines possessing little consciousness now. A mollusc has not much consciousness. Reflect upon the extraordinary advance which machines have made during the last few hundred years, and note how slowly the animal and vegetable kingdoms are advancing. The more highly organized machines are creatures not so much of yesterday, as of the last five minutes, so to speak, in comparison with past time.
...

“Either,” he proceeds, “a great deal of action that has been called purely mechanical and unconscious must be admitted to contain more elements of consciousness than has been allowed hitherto (and in this case germs of consciousness will be found in many actions of the higher machines)—Or (assuming the theory of evolution but at the same time denying the consciousness of vegetable and crystalline action) the race of man has descended from things which had no consciousness at all. In this case there is no ''à priori'' improbability in the descent of conscious (and more than conscious) machines from those which now exist, except that which is suggested by the apparent absence of anything like a reproductive system in the mechanical kingdom.}}
Later, in &lt;span style=
"font-variant:small-caps"&gt;chapter xxiv: the machines—continued&lt;/span&gt;, the imaginary book also discusses the notion that machines can "reproduce" like living organisms:
{{quote|“But the machines which reproduce machinery do not reproduce machines after their own kind. A thimble may be made by machinery, but it was not made by, neither will it ever make, a thimble. Here, again, if we turn to nature we shall find abundance of analogies which will teach us that a reproductive system may be in full force without the thing produced being of the same kind as that which produced it. Very few creatures reproduce after their own kind; they reproduce something which has the potentiality of becoming that which their parents were. Thus the butterfly lays an egg, which egg can become a caterpillar, which caterpillar can become a chrysalis, which chrysalis can become a butterfly; and though I freely grant that the machines cannot be said to have more than the germ of a true reproductive system at present, have we not just seen that they have only recently obtained the germs of a mouth and stomach?  And may not some stride be made in the direction of true reproduction which shall be as great as that which has been recently taken in the direction of true feeding?

“It is possible that the system when developed may be in many cases a vicarious thing. Certain classes of machines may be alone fertile, while the rest discharge other functions in the mechanical system, just as the great majority of ants and bees have nothing to do with the continuation of their species, but get food and store it, without thought of breeding. One cannot expect the parallel to be complete or nearly so; certainly not now, and probably never; but is there not enough analogy existing at the present moment, to make us feel seriously uneasy about the future, and to render it our duty to check the evil while we can still do so?  Machines can within certain limits beget machines of any class, no matter how different to themselves. Every class of machines will probably have its special mechanical breeders, and all the higher ones will owe their existence to a large number of parents and not to two only.

“Complex now, but how much simpler and more intelligibly organised may it not become in another hundred thousand years? or in twenty thousand?  For man at present believes that his interest lies in that direction; he spends an incalculable amount of labour and time and thought in making machines breed always better and better; he has already succeeded in effecting much that at one time appeared impossible, and there seem no limits to the results of accumulated improvements if they are allowed to descend with modification from generation to generation.}}
This notion of machine "reproduction" anticipates the later notion of [[self-replicating machine]]s, although in &lt;span style=
"font-variant:small-caps"&gt;chapter xxv: the machines—concluded&lt;/span&gt;, the imaginary book supposes that while there is a danger that humans will become subservient to machines, the machines will still need humans to assist in their reproduction and maintenance:
{{quote|“Herein lies our danger. For many seem inclined to acquiesce in so dishonourable a future. They say that although man should become to the machines what the horse and dog are to us, yet that he will continue to exist, and will probably be better off in a state of domestication under the beneficent rule of the machines than in his present wild condition. We treat our domestic animals with much kindness. We give them whatever we believe to be the best for them; and there can be no doubt that our use of meat has increased their happiness rather than detracted from it. In like manner there is reason to hope that the machines will use us kindly, for their existence will be in a great measure dependent upon ours; they will rule us with a rod of iron, but they will not eat us; they will not only require our services in the reproduction and education of their young, but also in waiting upon them as servants; in gathering food for them, and feeding them; in restoring them to health when they are sick; and in either burying their dead or working up their deceased members into new forms of mechanical existence.}}
The author of the imaginary book goes on to say that while life under [[machine rule]] might be materially comfortable for humans, the thought of the human race being superseded in the future is just as horrifying to him as the thought that his distant ancestors were anything other than fully human (apparently Butler imagines the author to be an [[Anti-evolution]]ist), so he urges that all machines which have been in use for less than 300 years be destroyed to prevent this future from coming to pass:
{{quote|“The power of custom is enormous, and so gradual will be the change, that man's sense of what is due to himself will be at no time rudely shocked; our bondage will steal upon us noiselessly and by imperceptible approaches; nor will there ever be such a clashing of desires between man and the machines as will lead to an encounter between them. Among themselves the machines will war eternally, but they will still require man as the being through whose agency the struggle will be principally conducted. In point of fact there is no occasion for anxiety about the future happiness of man so long as he continues to be in any way profitable to the machines; he may become the inferior race, but he will be infinitely better off than he is now. Is it not then both absurd and unreasonable to be envious of our benefactors?  And should we not be guilty of consummate folly if we were to reject advantages which we cannot obtain otherwise, merely because they involve a greater gain to others than to ourselves?

“With those who can argue in this way I have nothing in common. I shrink with as much horror from believing that my race can ever be superseded or surpassed, as I should do from believing that even at the remotest period my ancestors were other than human beings. Could I believe that ten hundred thousand years ago a single one of my ancestors was another kind of being to myself, I should lose all self-respect, and take no further pleasure or interest in life. I have the same feeling with regard to my descendants, and believe it to be one that will be felt so generally that the country will resolve upon putting an immediate stop to all further mechanical progress, and upon destroying all improvements that have been made for the last three hundred years. I would not urge more than this. We may trust ourselves to deal with those that remain, and though I should prefer to have seen the destruction include another two hundred years, I am aware of the necessity for compromising, and would so far sacrifice my own individual convictions as to be content with three hundred. Less than this will be insufficient.”}}
Erewhonian society came to the conclusion "...that the machines were ultimately destined to supplant the race of man, and to become instinct with a vitality as different from, and superior to, that of animals, as animal to vegetable life. So... they made a clean sweep of all machinery that had not been in use for more than two hundred and seventy-one years..." (from &lt;span style=
"font-variant:small-caps"&gt;
chapter ix: to the metropolis&lt;/span&gt;.)

Despite the initial popularity of ''Erewhon'', Butler commented in the preface to the second edition that reviewers had "in some cases been inclined to treat the chapters on Machines as an attempt to reduce Mr. Darwin’s theory to an absurdity." He protested that "few things would be more distasteful to me than any attempt to laugh at Mr. Darwin", but also added "I am surprised, however, that the book at which such an example of the specious misuse of analogy would seem most naturally levelled should have occurred to no reviewer; neither shall I mention the name of the book here, though I should fancy that the hint given will suffice",&lt;ref&gt;[[Project Gutenberg]] eBook [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/1906 ''Erewhon'' by Samuel Butler.]&lt;/ref&gt; which may suggest that the chapter on Machines was in fact a satire intended to illustrate the "specious misuse of analogy", even if the target was not Darwin; Butler, fearing that he had offended Darwin, wrote him a letter explaining that the actual target was [[Joseph Butler]]'s 1736 ''The Analogy of Religion, Natural and Revealed, to the Constitution and Course of Nature''. The [[Victorian era|Victorian]] scholar Herbert Sussman has suggested that although Butler's exploration of machine evolution was intended to be whimsical, he may also have been genuinely interested in the notion that living organisms are a type of mechanism and was exploring this notion with his writings on machines,&lt;ref&gt;Breuer, Hans-Peter. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/436868 'Samuel Butler's "the Book of the Machines" and the Argument from Design.'] Modern Philology, Vol. 72, No. 4 (May 1975), pp. 365–383&lt;/ref&gt; while the philosopher Louis Flaccus called it "a mixture of fun, satire, and thoughtful speculation."&lt;ref&gt;Flaccus, Louis. [https://books.google.com/books?id=JigdAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA143#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false University lectures delivered by members of the faculty in the free public lecture course], p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Evolution of Global Intelligence''==
[[George Dyson (science historian)|George Dyson]] applies Butler's original [[premise]] to the [[artificial life]] and [[artificial intelligence|intelligence]] of [[Alan Turing]] in '''''Darwin Among the Machines: The Evolution of Global Intelligence''''' (1998) {{ISBN|0-7382-0030-1}}, to suggest that the internet is a living, [[sentient]] [[being]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;Dyson's main claim is that the evolution of a conscious mind from today's technology is inevitable. It is not clear whether this will be a single mind or multiple minds, how smart that mind would be, and even if we will be able to communicate with it. He also clearly suggests that there are forms of intelligence on Earth that we are currently unable to understand.

From the book: "What mind, if any, will become apprehensive of the great coiling of ideas now under way is not a meaningless question, but it is still too early in the game to expect an answer that is meaningful to us."&lt;ref&gt;[http://tal.forum2.org/darwin Excerpted from review] by [http://tal.forum2.org/author_Tal%20Cohen Tal Cohen], 30 September 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Origins==
[[Vitruvius]] records how in [[Sparta]], in 59 BC, "paintings have been taken out of certain walls by cutting through the bricks, enclosed in wooden frames, and brought to the [[Comitium]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0072%3Abook%3D2%3Achapter%3D8%3Asection%3D9 |title=Vitruvius, ''De Architectura'' II.8.9 |publisher=[[Perseus Project]] |accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A century later, apprised of paintings of [[Atalanta]] and [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] without drapery and "enflamed with lust", [[Caligula]] attempted to carry them off, but was prevented by the makeup of the [[Plaster#In art|plaster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D35%3Achapter%3D6 |title=Pliny the Elder, ''Natural History'' XXXV.6.17-18 |publisher=[[Perseus Project]] |accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amedeo Maiuri|Maiuri]] cites examples of wall paintings in wooden frames excavated at [[Pompeii]], a precursor to [[Pompeii#Rediscovery|what was to follow]] in the 18th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Motivation==
In their study, Mora, Mora, and Philippot cite four reasons for the "over-use" of detachment: the 19th-century division of [[the arts]] that privileged a "painting" divorced from its architectural and historical context; insensitivity to the [[aesthetic]] consequences, often partially concealed by [[Conservation-restoration|restorers]]; the curiosity of [[Art history|art historians]] looking for ''[[Sinopia|sinopie]]''; or perceived savings relating to the initial cost of treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Conservation of Wall Paintings |author1=Mora, Paolo |author2=Mora, Laura |author3=Philippot, Paul |publisher=[[Butterworth-Heinemann|Butterworths]] |year=1984 |pages=245f |ISBN=0-408-10812-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial gain and exploitation as consumer goods by collectors, dealers and restorers provides another possible incentive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reversibility - Does it Exist? |editor1=Oddy, Andrew |editor1-link=William Andrew Oddy |editor2=Carroll, Sara |publisher=[[British Museum Press#British Museum Press|British Museum Press]] |year=1999 |ISBN=0-86159-135-6 |chapter=Aspects of reversibility in transferred paintings |pages=64f |author=Brajer, Isabelle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Dialectic of Enlightenment''''' ({{lang-de|Dialektik der Aufklärung}}) is a work of [[philosophy]] and [[social criticism]] written by [[Frankfurt School]] philosophers [[Max Horkheimer]] and [[Theodor W. Adorno]] and first published in 1944. A revised version appeared in 1947.

One of the core texts of [[Critical Theory]], ''Dialectic of Enlightenment'' explores the socio-psychological ''status quo'' that had been responsible for what the [[Frankfurt School]] considered the failure of the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. Together with ''[[The Authoritarian Personality]]'' (1950; also co-authored by Adorno) and Frankfurt School member [[Herbert Marcuse]]'s ''[[One-Dimensional Man]]'' (1964), it has had a major effect on 20th-century philosophy, sociology, culture, and politics, inspiring especially the [[New Left]] of the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Held, D. (1980).Introduction to Critical Theory:  Horkheimer to Habermas.Berkeley, University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical context==
{{Frankfurt School}}
One of the distinguishing characteristics of the new Critical Theory, as Adorno and Horkheimer set out to elaborate it in ''Dialectic of Enlightenment'', is a certain ambivalence concerning the ultimate source or foundation of social domination. This ambivalence gave rise to the "pessimism" of the new Critical Theory over the possibility of human emancipation and [[Political freedom|freedom]].&lt;ref&gt;Adorno, T. W., with Max Horkheimer. ''Dialectic of Enlightenment''. Trans. Edmund Jephcott. Stanford: Stanford UP, 2002. 242.&lt;/ref&gt;

This ambivalence was rooted in the historical circumstances in which ''Dialectic of Enlightenment'' was originally produced: the authors saw [[National Socialism]], [[Stalinism]], [[state capitalism]], and [[mass culture]] as entirely new forms of social domination that could not be adequately explained within the terms of traditional Critical Theory.&lt;ref&gt;"Critical Theory was initially developed in Horkheimer’s circle to think through political disappointments at the absence of revolution in the West, the development of Stalinism in Soviet Russia, and the victory of fascism in Germany. It was supposed to explain mistaken Marxist prognoses, but without breaking Marxist intentions."  "The Entwinement of Myth and Enlightenment: Horkheimer and Adorno." in Habermas, Jürgen. ''The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity: Twelve Lectures''. trans. Frederick Lawrence. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 1987. 116. Also, see Helmut Dubiel, ''Theory and Politics: Studies in the Development of Critical Theory'', trans. Benjamin Gregg (Cambridge, Massachusetts and London, 1985).&lt;/ref&gt;

For Adorno and Horkheimer (relying on the economist [[Friedrich Pollock]]'s thesis on National Socialism),&lt;ref&gt;Willem van Reijen and Jan Bransen. "The Disappearance of Class History in the Dialectic of Enlightenment." in ''Dialectic of Enlightenment''. 248. Also see, Friedrich Pollock. "Is National Socialism a New Order?" ''Studies in Philosophy and Social Science'' 9 (1941), 453.&lt;/ref&gt; [[state intervention]] in the economy had effectively abolished the tension in capitalism between the "[[relations of production]]" and the "material [[productive forces]] of society," a tension which, according to traditional Critical Theory, constituted the primary [[contradiction]] within capitalism. The market (as an "unconscious" mechanism for the distribution of goods) and [[private property]] had been replaced by [[centralized planning]] and socialized ownership of the [[means of production]].&lt;ref&gt;"[G]one are the objective laws of the market which ruled in the actions of the entrepreneurs and tended toward catastrophe. Instead the conscious decision of the managing directors executes as results (which are more obligatory than the blindest price-mechanisms) the old law of value and hence the destiny of capitalism." ''Dialectic of Enlightenment''. p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet, contrary to [[Marx]]’s famous prediction in the ''Preface to a Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy'', this shift did not lead to "an era of [[social revolution]]," but rather to [[fascism]] and [[totalitarianism]]. As such, traditional Critical Theory was left, in [[Jürgen Habermas]]'s words, without "anything in reserve to which it might appeal; and when the forces of production enter into a baneful symbiosis with the relations of production that they were supposed to blow wide open, there is no longer any dynamism upon which critique could base its hope."&lt;ref&gt;"The Entwinement of Myth and Enlightenment," p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; For Adorno and Horkheimer, this posed the problem of how to account for the apparent persistence of domination in the absence of the very contradiction that, according to traditional Critical Theory, was the source of domination itself.&lt;ref&gt;Held, D. (1980).Introduction to Critical Theory:  Horkheimer to Habermas.Berkeley, University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Topics and themes==

The problems posed by the rise of fascism with the demise of the [[Liberalism|liberal]] state and the market (together with the failure of a social revolution to materialize in its wake) constitute the theoretical and historical perspective that frames the overall argument of the book – the two theses that "Myth is already enlightenment, and enlightenment reverts to mythology."&lt;ref&gt;''Dialectic of Enlightenment'', xviii&lt;/ref&gt;  The history of human societies, as well as that of the formation of individual ego or self, is re-evaluated from the standpoint of what Horkheimer and Adorno perceived at the time as the ultimate outcome of this history: the collapse or “regression” of reason, with the rise of National Socialism, into something (referred to as merely "enlightenment" for the majority of the text) resembling the very forms of superstition and myth out of which reason had supposedly emerged as a result of historical progress or development.

Horkheimer and Adorno believe that in the process of "enlightenment," modern philosophy had become over-rationalized and an instrument of [[technocracy]]. They characterized the peak of this process as [[positivism]], referring to both the [[logical positivism]] of the [[Vienna Circle]] and broader trends that they saw in continuity with this movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | location = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 |page = 244–5 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 978-0-226-40336-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Horkheimer and Adorno's critique of positivism has been criticized as too broad; they are particularly critiqued for interpreting [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] as a positivist and for failing to examine critiques of positivism from within [[analytic philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;Josephson-Storm (2017), p. 242, 243-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

To characterize this history, Horkheimer and Adorno draw on a wide variety of material, including the [[philosophical anthropology]] contained in Marx’s early writings, centered on the notion of "[[Labour (economics)|labor]]"; [[Nietzsche]]’s [[genealogy of morals]] (and the emergence of [[conscience]] through the renunciation of the [[will to power]]); [[Freud]]’s account in ''[[Totem and Taboo]]'' of the emergence of civilization and law in murder of the primordial father;&lt;ref&gt;See ''Dialectic of Enlightenment'', 7, 159, 162.&lt;/ref&gt; ethnological research on magic and rituals in primitive societies;&lt;ref&gt;''Dialectic of Enlightenment'', 10, 256.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[myth criticism]], [[philology]], and literary analysis.

The authors coined the term ''[[culture industry]]'', arguing that in a capitalist society mass culture is akin to a factory producing standardized cultural goods — films, radio programmes, magazines, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=l-75zLjGlZQC&amp;pg=PA94 pp. 94–5]  quotation: {{quotation|Culture today is infecting everything with sameness. Film, radio, and magazines form a system. Each branch of culture is unanimous within itself and all are unanimous together. Even the aesthetic manifestations of political opposites proclaim the same inflexible rhythm...All mass culture under monopoly is identical... Films and radio no longer need to present themselves as art. The truth that they are nothing but business is used as an ideology to legitimize the trash they intentionally produce.}}&lt;/ref&gt; These homogenized cultural products are used to [[Media manipulation|manipulate]] mass society into docility and passivity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=l-75zLjGlZQC&amp;pg=PA95 pp. 94–5]  quotation: {{quotation|...The standardized forms, it is claimed, were originally derived from the needs of the consumers: that is why they are accepted with so little resistance. In reality, a cycle of manipulation and retroactive need is unifying the system ever more tightly.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of the radio, a mass medium, no longer permits its listener any mechanism of reply, as was the case with the telephone. Instead, listeners are not subjects anymore but passive receptacles exposed "in authoritarian fashion to the same programs put out by different stations."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=l-75zLjGlZQC&amp;pg=PA95 pp. 95–6]  quotation: {{quotation|The step from telephone to radio has clearly distinguished the roles. The former liberally permitted the participant to play the role of subject. The latter democratically makes everyone equally into listeners, in order to expose them in authoritarian fashion to the same programs put out by different stations. No mechanism of reply has been developed...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Editions==
The book made its first appearance in 1944 under the title ''Philosophische Fragmente'' by Social Studies Association, Inc., New York. A revised version was published in 1947 by [[Querido]] Verlag in Amsterdam with the title ''Dialektik der Aufklärung.'' It was reissued in 1969 by S Fischer Verlag GmbH. There have been two English translations: the first by John Cumming (New York: Herder and Herder, 1972) and a more recent translation, based on the definitive text from Horkheimer's collected works, by Edmund Jephcott (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2002).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13874">In general, '''expansionism''' consists of policies of governments and states that involve territorial, military or economic expansion. While some have linked the term to promoting [[economic growth]] (in contrast to [[Steady-state economy|no growth]] or sustainable policies), more commonly expansionism refers to the doctrine of a state expanding its territorial base or economic influence. This occurs usually, though not necessarily, by means of military aggression. Compare [[empire-building]], [[colonialism]], and ''mensurable''.

[[Anarchism]], [[reunification]] or [[pan-nationalism]] are sometimes used to justify and legitimize expansionism, but only when the explicit goal is to reconquer territories that have been lost, or to take over ancestral lands. A simple territorial dispute, such as a border dispute, is not usually referred to as expansionism.

Countries with nuclear weapons are more likely to exhibit expansionist behavior; particularly, if the state is not a democracy, and even if such state's public ideology is non-interference. Depending on chosen strategy, expansionism manifests in brute force or any threat of it, or in economic measures (a debt trap through infrastructure "investments" via burdensome loans), active measures (such as espionage, sabotage, manipulation of critical infrastructure), or a combination thereof. With conflicts that involve war, mutual accusations of expansionism are inevitable between nuclear powers that have strategic overlap.

==Past examples==
{{expand section|more historical examples|date=November 2017}} 
The militarist and nationalistic reign of [[Czar Nicholas I]] (1825–1855) led to wars of conquest against [[Russo-Persian War (1826–1828)|Persia (1826–1828)]] and [[Russo-Turkish War (1828–1829)|Turkey (1828–1829)]]. Various rebel tribes in the [[Caucasus]] region were crushed. A [[November Uprising|Polish revolt]] in 1830 was ruthlessly crushed. Russian troops in 1848 crossed into [[Austria-Hungary]] to put down the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|Hungarian revolt]]. [[Russification]] policies were implemented to weaken minority ethnic groups. Nicholas also built the [[Kremlin Palace]] and a new cathedral in Saint Petersburg. But [[Pan-slavism]] ambition led to further war with Turkey (the [[Sick man of Europe]]) in 1853 provoked Britain and France into [[Crimean War|invading Crimea]], and Nicholas died, supposedly of grief at his defeat. &lt;ref&gt; [[Orlando Figes]], Crimea, Penguin, 2011, chapter one &lt;/ref&gt;

The German [[Second Reich]] (1871–1918) underwent an industrial revolution under [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]], who also reformed and expanded the army. Poles and Catholics were persecuted. Colonies were acquired in Africa and China. In 1890, [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] dismissed Bismarck and resolved to build a world-class Navy, which led to an [[arms race]] with Britain and thence to World War One. &lt;ref&gt; [[Allan Mallinson]], '1914; Fight the Good Fight', Bantam Press, 2013, chapter two &lt;/ref&gt;

From 1933 the [[Third Reich]] under Hitler laid claim to the [[Rhineland]], the [[Sudetenland]], unification (''[[Anschluss]]'') with Austria in 1938, and the whole of the Czech lands the following year. After war broke out, Hitler and Stalin divided Poland between Germany and the USSR. In a ''[[Drang nach Osten]]'' aimed at achieving ''[[Lebensraum]]'' for the German people, Germany invaded the USSR in 1941. &lt;ref&gt; [[Sebastian Haffner]], [[The Meaning of Hitler]], Phoenix, 2000, chapters 2,3 and 4 &lt;/ref&gt;

[[Colonialism]], a form of expansionism is the policy of a nation seeking to extend or retain its authority over other people or territories, generally with the aim of developing or exploiting them to the benefit of the colonizing country.&lt;ref&gt;''Colonialism'', Webster's Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language (1989 ed.) p. 291.; ''Colonialisme'', Nouveau Petit Robert de la langue française (1993 ed.), p. 456.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[History of colonialism|European colonial period]] was the era from the 15th century to the mid-20th century when several European powers had established colonies in the [[Americas]], [[Africa]] and [[Asia]].

[[Expansionist nationalism]] is an aggressive and radical form of [[nationalism]] that incorporates autonomous, patriotic sentiments with a belief in expansionism. The term was coined during the late nineteenth century as European powers indulged in the '[[Scramble for Africa]]' in the name of national glory, but has been most associated with militarist governments during the 20th century including [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist_regime_.281922.E2.80.931943.29|Fascist Italy]], [[Nazi Germany]], the [[Japanese empire]], and the [[Balkans]] countries of [[Albanian nationalism|Albania]] ([[Greater Albania]]), [[Bulgarian nationalism|Bulgaria]] ([[Greater Bulgaria]]), [[Croatian nationalism|Croatia]] ([[Greater Croatia]]), [[Hungarian nationalism|Hungary]] ([[Hungarian irredentism|Greater Hungary]]), [[Romanian nationalism|Romania]] ([[Greater Romania]]) and [[Serbian nationalism|Serbia]] ([[Greater Serbia]]).

==21st century==
===China===
The People's Republic of China is expanding its operations and influence in the [[South China Sea]], claiming possession of disputed offshore islands in the search for oil and gas.&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Tisdall]], 'Vietnam's fury at China's expansionism can be traced to a troubled history', [[The Guardian]], 15/5/2004&lt;/ref&gt; A major instrument of influence is the [[Belt and Road Initiative]].

===Israel===
[[Israel]] has tried to expand its territory and power through the occupation of the [[Syria|Syrian]] Golan Heights,&lt;ref&gt;https://theintercept.com/2018/01/23/israel-syria-safe-buffer-zone-golan-heights/&lt;/ref&gt; the killing of [[Palestinians|Palestinian]] civilians in the [[Gaza Strip]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/04/gaza-protest-latest-updates-180406092506561.html&lt;/ref&gt; warring with neighbouring [[Lebanon]] (2006) and openly considering future wars,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.economist.com/leaders/2006/08/17/nasrallah-wins-the-war&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.businessinsider.com/a-new-war-could-erupt-as-tensions-rise-between-israel-and-lebanon-2017-10&lt;/ref&gt; striking Syrian and Iranian forces that purport to defend the Syria against [[Daesh]] terrorists.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rt.com/news/437647-israel-strikes-syria-iran/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iran]], the largest [[Shi'ite]] state, has extended its influence in Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tim Arango]], 'Iran Dominates in Iraq after US 'handed the country over'', [[The New York Times]], 15/7/2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia===
[[Russia]]'s behavior threatens the integrity and existence of [[NATO]] member states and Russia's non-NATO neighbors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Walker |first=Peter |title=Russian expansionism may pose existential threat, says NATO general |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date=2015-02-20 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/20/russia-existential-threat-british-nato-general |accessdate=2018-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The events associated with Russia are: the 2008 [[Russo-Georgian War]] and Russia's [[Occupied territories of Georgia|occupation of South Ossetia and Abkhazia]]; the [[Russian military intervention in Ukraine (2014–present)|Russian military intervention in Ukraine]], which began in 2014 with the [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|Annexation of Crimea]] and the [[War in Donbass]]; and the [[Russian military intervention in the Syrian Civil War|military intervention in Syria]].

===United States===
The [[United States]] is seen to be using its power to expand its influence. Criticism is meted out for large-scale events (wars); for expressing support in favor of opposition groups, and for aiding the rebel groups' aspirations to remove governments. The war in [[Afghanistan]] was begun in response to the [[September 11 attacks|9/11]] attacks; despite opposition by traditional allies such as [[France]], a war in [[Iraq]] was declared based on the inaccurate information of Iraq hosting weapons of mass destruction. No weapons of mass destruction were ever found, however a controversial [[Iraqi oil law|oil law]] was passed through American influence, largely privatising the valuable commodity of oil to foreign companies. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-afghanistan-announce-war-us-army-escalation-pakistan-a7905821.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.defensenews.com/congress/2018/02/23/trump-administration-troops-can-stay-in-iraq-syria-indefinitely/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/13/opinion/13juhasz.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of the United States extends to: embargoing countries such as Cuba;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cuba-economy-un/us-trade-embargo-has-cost-cuba-130-billion-un-says-idUSKBN1IA00T&lt;/ref&gt; building military bases around the world, especially in the [[Arab countries]] of the [[Persian Gulf]];&lt;ref&gt;https://www.americansecurityproject.org/national-security-strategy/u-s-bases-in-the-middle-east/&lt;/ref&gt; supporting opposition groups in [[Libya]] and [[Syrian Civil War|Syria]] during the [[Arab Spring]] and the [[Syrian Civil War]];&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-libya-usa-order/exclusive-obama-authorizes-secret-help-for-libya-rebels-idUSTRE72T6H220110330&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-turkey/turkey-to-u-s-end-support-for-syrian-kurd-ypg-or-risk-confrontation-idUSKBN1FE297&lt;/ref&gt; implementing sanctions against the leaderships of countries [[Venezuela]], [[Russia]], and Iran;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/01/world/europe/us-sanctions-turkey-pastor.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-russia-sanctions/us-senators-introduce-russia-sanctions-bill-from-hell-idUSKBN1KN22Q&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/21/us/politics/trump-maduro-venezuela-sanctions.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/10/global-powers-condemn-us-sanctions-against-iran-and-encourage-business.html&lt;/ref&gt; deploying its navy in the [[South China Sea]], widely seen as a way to counter Chinese claims in the South China Sea.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scmp.com/news/china/military/article/2166910/us-navy-plans-major-show-strength-south-china-sea-warning&lt;/ref&gt;

The explicit rhetoric of president [[Donald Trump|Trump]] and his political satellites has had a damaging effect on the United States itself. Examples of such are the overt rhetoric advocating the overthrow of democratically-elected governments deemed undemocratic by the United States, such as in [[Venezuela]], [[Iran]], and [[Syria]];&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/08/trump-nicolas-maduro-overthrow-venezuelan-meetings&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-iran-opposition/trump-lawyer-giuliani-says-irans-government-will-be-overthrown-idUSKCN1M3005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.strategic-culture.org/news/2016/12/08/officials-obama-prioritized-defeating-assad-above-defeating-jihadists.html&lt;/ref&gt; the influencing of the blockade of countries such as [[Qatar]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/06/timeline-gcc-egyptian-discord-qatar-170605063154230.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent times, the United States is also seen to be asserting its dominance economically. Faced by a rapidly-internationalising Renminbi and a growing eurozone, the United States is using the global dominance of the US dollar in worldwide trade to indiscriminately sanction [[NATO]] allies such as [[Turkey]], as well as rival countries such as [[Russia]], Venezuela and Iran;&lt;ref&gt; https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/01/world/europe/us-sanctions-turkey-pastor.html &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-russia-sanctions/us-senators-introduce-russia-sanctions-bill-from-hell-idUSKBN1KN22Q &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/21/us/politics/trump-maduro-venezuela-sanctions.html &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/10/global-powers-condemn-us-sanctions-against-iran-and-encourage-business.html &lt;/ref&gt; using protectionist measures against traditional allies and fellow [[World Trade Organization|WTO]]-members, [[Canada]], [[Mexico]], and the [[European Union]];&lt;ref&gt;https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-trade-tariffs-in-us-canada-china-eu-mexico-world-2018-7&lt;/ref&gt; and initiating a major trade war with economic rival [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45294162&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideologies==

In the nineteenth century, theories of racial unity such as [[Pan-Germanism]], [[Pan-Slavism]], [[Pan-Turkism]] and the related [[Turanism]], evolved. In each case, the dominant nation (respectively, [[Prussia]], [[Russia]]&lt;ref&gt; [[Orlando Figes]], ''Crimea'', Penguin, 2011, p.89 &lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Ottoman Empire]], especially under [[Enver Pasha]],) used these theories to legitimise their expansionist policies.

==In popular culture==

[[George Orwell]]'s satirical novel ''[[Animal Farm]]'' is a fictional depiction, based on [[Stalin]]'s [[USSR]], of a new elite seizing power, establishing new rules and hierarchies, then expanding economically while compromising their ideals; while [[Robert Erskine Childers]] in ''[[The Riddle of the Sands]]'' portrayed the threatening nature of the German [[Second Reich]]. [[Elspeth Huxley]]'s novel [[Red Strangers]] shows the effects on local culture of colonial expansion into sub-Saharan Africa.

'''Flaminius Annibali de Latera''' (born at [[Latera]], near [[Viterbo]], 23 November 1733; died at Viterbo, 27 February 1813) was an Italian historian.

He received his first education from a priest, Paolo Ferranti, and at the age of sixteen entered the [[Order of Friars Minor Observants]] in the [[Roman Province]], taking the habit at the convent of St. Bernardine at [[Orte]], 23 January 1750; a year later on the same day he made his solemn profession. Being in due time ordained priest, he passed his examinations as lector generalis (professor), and successively taught theology in various convents &amp;mdash; Viterbo, [[Fano]], [[Velletri]], and Rome. 

From 1790 to 1791 he was [[definitor genera]]l of the Roman Province . When the convents in Italy were suppressed by [[Napoleon I]] in 1810, Annibali retired to Viterbo, and died there in a private residence. 

De Latera during fifty years developed immense activity as a writer. He lived at a time when [[Franciscan]] history had just passed through the great and passionate [[Spader]]-[[Ringhieri]] and [[Lucci]]- [[Marczic]] controversies. This had a notable influence on his writings: he wrote mostly with a polemical motive. 

==Works (incomplete list)==
"*Ad Bullarium Franciscanum a P. Hyacintho Sbaralea Ord. Min.Conv...editum, Supplementum" (Rome, 1780), dedicated to Pope Pius VI, by whose orders it was written to correct the Conventual interpretations of Sbaralea [see 'Archiv f. Litt. u. Kirchengeschichte", I (1885), 516-17.] 
*"Manuale de' Frati Minori... con un'appendice, o sia risposta all'autore (P. Sangallo, O. M. Con.) del Saggio compendioso della dottrina di Giustino Febbronio (Rome, 1776). This latter work occasioned great controversies, which partly took a violent and abusive form. 
*"Dissertationes critico-historicae in quarum una Ser. Patriarcha Franciscus Tertii Ordinis institutor, in altera Indulgentiae Portiunculae veritas assertir et vindicatur (Rome, 1784). 
*"Veritas impressiones Sacrorum Stimatum in corpore Seraphici S. Francisci Assisiensis..."(Rome, 1786). 
*"La storia della Indulgenza concessa da Gesu Cristo...nella Chiesa della Portiuncula si dimostra vera..." (Rome, 1796). The last three books were written against rationalistic attacks of the time, concerning which see Pezzana, "Memorie degli Scrittori e Letterati Parmigiani", VI, pt. I, 127 (Parma, 1825) When the Benedictine Pujati had, by order of [[Scipio Ricci]], written against the traditional form of the Stations of the Cross, Annibali, with the Franciscans Affo and Tommasco da Cireglio, was charged to answer; he then wrote 
*"La Pratica del pio Esercizio della Via Crucis...vendicata dalle obbiezioni di D. Giuseppe Ma Pujati, Monaco Casinese..." (Viterbo, 1783; 2nd ed., Viterbo, 1785). 
*"La Difesa dell' antico metodo della Via Crucis e la Censura del nuovo..." (against the "Annali ecclesiastici" of Florence) (Viterbo, 1783). An important but little-known work is 
*"Compendio della Storia degli Ordini religiosi esistensi (4 vols., Rome, 1790-91); 2nd ed. of the same with the title " Storia degli Ordini regolari...." (Naples, 1796). 
*A life of St. Collette, in Italian (Rome, 1805; 2nd ed., Rome, 1807). 
*Italian life of St. Hyacintha Mariscotti (Rome, 1805; 2nd ed., Rome, 1807). 
*New edition of "F. Francisci Horantii Hispani (O. F. M.)... Locorum Catholicorum ...libri VII" (2 vols., Rome, 1795–96). 
*Annibali worked on the reform of the Franciscan Breviary, 1784–85, and composed many new offices edited separately at Rome, 1785 (see "Archivum Franc. Hist.", I, Quaracchi, 1908, 45-49). 
*An Italian hymn-book (Viterbo, 1772). (14) "Notizie storiche della Casa Farnese della fu Citta di Castro...coll' aggiunta di due Paesi Latera e Farnese" (in 2 parts, Montefiascone, 1817–18), which appeared after his death.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9776">In [[astronomy]], '''Galactocentrism''' is the theory that the [[Milky Way Galaxy]], home of [[Earth]]{{'}}s [[Solar System]], is at or near the center of the [[Universe]].&lt;ref name="Merriam"&gt;{{cite web |title=Definition of galactocentric |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/galactocentric |website=Merriam-Webster Dictionary |accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Definition of galactocentric in English: |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/galactocentric |website=English Oxford Living Dictionaries |accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Observations by [[William Herschel]] in 1785 suggested that the [[Milky Way]] was a disk-shaped galaxy with the sun in a central position. Although [[heliocentric]], Herschel's observations were the first attempt at an [[observational cosmology]].&lt;ref name="Berendzen"/&gt; 

Herschel's heliocentric theory was overthrown by astronomer [[Harlow Shapley]]'s work on [[globular cluster]]s in 1918. Shapley's research marked the transition from heliocentrism to galactocentrism, placing the [[Galactic Center]] of the Milky Way Galaxy far away from the sun, towards [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]]. [[Heber Doust Curtis]] and [[Edwin Hubble]] further refuted the heliocentric view of the universe by showing that spirals are themselves far-flung galactic systems.  By 1925, the galactocentric model was established.&lt;ref name="Berendzen"/&gt;

The theory of Galactocentrism was an important step in the development of [[cosmological]] models as speculation on the existence of other galaxies, comparable in size and structure to our own, placed the earth in its proper perspective with respect to the rest of the [[universe]]. Shifts from heliocentrism to galactocentrism and later acentrism have been compared in significance to the [[Copernican Revolution]].&lt;ref name="Berendzen"/&gt;

==William Herschel's Heliocentrism==
Work by [[Thomas Wright (astronomer)|Thomas Wright]] and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] indicated that fuzzy patches of light called [[nebula]]e were actually distant "island universes" consisting of many [[star system|stellar systems]].&lt;ref name="Harrison"&gt;{{Citation |date=2000 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=67–71 |isbn=0-521-66148-X |url=https://books.google.com/?id=-8PJbcA2lLoC&amp;pg=PA71&amp;lpg=PA71&amp;dq=galactocentric+theory |title=Cosmology: The Science of the Universe |first=Edward Robert |last= Harrison }}&lt;/ref&gt; The shape of our own galaxy was expected to resemble that of the nebulae. 

[[File:Herschel-galaxy.jpg|thumb | right| William Herschel's model of the Milky Way, 1785]]
In 1783, amateur [[astronomer]] [[William Herschel]] attempted to determine the shape of the galaxy by examining stars through his handmade [[telescopes]]. Herschel was the first to propose a model of the galaxy based on observation and measurement. He concluded that it was in the shape of a [[spiral galaxy|disk]], but incorrectly assumed that the sun was in the center of the disk.&lt;ref name="Kamp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berendzen"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Berendzen |first1=Richard |title=Geocentric to heliocentric to galactocentric to acentric: the continuing assault to the egocentric |journal=Vistas in Astronomy |date=1975 |volume=17 |pages=65–83 |doi=10.1016/0083-6656(75)90049-5 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0083665675900495 |accessdate=6 June 2018|bibcode=1975VA.....17...65B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Shape of the Milky Way from Starcounts |url=https://www.e-education.psu.edu/astro801/content/l8_p3.html |website=Astro 801 |accessdate=5 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PBS"&gt;{{cite web |title=Meet the Stargazers |url=https://www.pbs.org/seeinginthedark/meet-the-stargazers/in-history.html |website=WHYY |accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seeing that the stars belonging to the [[Milky Way]] galaxy appeared to encircle the Earth, Herschel carefully counted stars of given apparent magnitudes, and after finding the numbers were the same in all directions, concluded Earth must be close to the center of the galaxy. However, there were two flaws in Herschel's [[methodology]]: magnitude is not a reliable index to the distance of stars, and some of the areas that he mistook for empty space were actually dark, obscuring nebulae that blocked his view toward the center of the Milky Way.&lt;ref name="Ferris"&gt;{{Citation |title=Coming of Age in the Milky Way |pages=150–159
|first= Timothy |last=Ferris |date=2003 |publisher=HarperCollins |isbn=0-06-053595-4 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=k0vCHGD5Y00C&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq=Coming+of+Age+in+the+Milky+Way
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Herschel model remained relatively unchallenged for the next hundred years, with minor refinements. [[Jacobus Kapteyn]] introduced motion, [[density]], and [[luminosity]] to Herschel's star counts, which still implied a near-central location of the Sun.&lt;ref name="Kamp"&gt;{{Citation |title=The Galactocentric Revolution, A Reminiscent Narrative |date=October 1965 |last=van de Kamp |first=Peter |journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific |volume=77 |pages=324–328 |issue=458 |bibcode=1965PASP...77..325V |doi = 10.1086/128228 |url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1965PASP...77..325V}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Harlow Shapley and Galactocentrism==
In 1918, as Kapteyn was refining his model, Herschel's heliocentric theory was overthrown by astronomer [[Harlow Shapley]]'s work on [[globular cluster]]s. 
Shapley's [[observational cosmology]] marked a transition from [[Heliocentrism]] to Galactocentrism.&lt;ref name="Bergh"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bergh |first1=Sidney van den |title=Hubble and Shapley—Two Early Giants of Observational Cosmology |journal=Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada |date=2011 |volume=105 |issue=6 |url=https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1110/1110.2445.pdf |accessdate=5 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kamp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berendzen"/&gt;

Shapley had been studying the [[Asymmetry|asymmetrical]] distribution of globular clusters, estimating the distance and location of individual objects by using [[variable stars]] as [[standard candle]]s. Globular clusters contain many [[cepheid variable]] stars, whose precise relationship between luminosity and variability period was established by [[Henrietta Swan Leavitt|Henrietta Leavitt]] in 1908.&lt;ref name="Kamp"/&gt; Using cepheid and [[RR Lyrae variable]]s to systematically chart the distribution of globular clusters, Shapley discovered that the stars in the Milky Way orbited a common center thousands of light years away from the [[Sun]].&lt;ref name="Nasa"&gt;{{Citation |url=http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/htmltest/gifcity/shapley_obit.html |title= `Great Debate:' Obituary of Harlow Shapley |publisher=NASA |journal=Nature |date=1972 |last=Kopal |first=Z. |pages=429–430 |volume=240 |doi=10.1038/240429a0 |issue=5381|bibcode = 1972Natur.240..429. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The galactic center was determined to be in the direction of the [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius constellation]], approximately 50,000 [[light-year]]s from us.&lt;ref name="Nasa" /&gt;

[[File:Local.group.arp.600pix.jpg|thumb | right | [[Sextans A]], a member of the local group of galaxies, which includes the [[Andromeda Galaxy|Andromeda]] and Milky Way spirals, [[Lowell Observatory]], 2013 ]]
In 1920 [[Heber Doust Curtis]] and Harlow Shapley participated in the [[Great Debate (astronomy)|Great Debate]] on the nature of nebulae and [[galaxy|galaxies]], and the size of the universe. Shapley believed that distant nebulae were relatively small and lay within the Milky Way galaxy. Curtis advocated the now-accepted view that nebulae were farther away, and that other galaxies apart from the [[Milky Way]] therefore existed.&lt;ref name="Berendzen"/&gt;
By 1925, [[Edwin Hubble]] had confirmed that many objects previously thought to be clouds of dust and gas and classified as "[[nebulae]]" were actually [[Galaxy|galaxies]] beyond the Milky Way.&lt;ref name="Distillations"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Roberts |first1=Jacob |title=A Giant of Astronomy |journal=Distillations |date=2017|volume=3|issue=3 |pages=6–11 |url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/a-giant-of-astronomy|accessdate=May 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hubble |first=Edwin |title=Extragalactic nebulae |journal=Astrophysical Journal |date=December 1926 |issue=64 |pages=321–369 |doi=10.1086/143018 |bibcode = 1926ApJ....64..321H |volume=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hetherington"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hetherington |first1=Edith W. |last2=Hetherington |first2=Norriss S. |title=Astronomy and culture |date=2009 |publisher=Greenwood Press/ABC-CLIO |location=Santa Barbara, Calif. |isbn=0313345368 |pages=174 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Iu8UBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2099">'''Gilla Mo Dutu Úa Caiside''' ([[floruit|fl.]] 1147) was a Gaelic [[Irish people|Irish]] poet.

==Biography==

Closely associated with [[Tighearnán Ua Ruairc]], King of [[Bréifne]], he was attached to the monastery of [[Daminis]], and possibly to the church of [[Ard Brecáin]], apparently been a cleric.

His two famous compositions are ''[[Éri óg inis na náem]]'' and the [[Banshenchas]].

The [[Ó Caiside]] family later became – from the 14th century – prominent in [[Fermanagh]], and many of them became hereditary doctors to the Maguire chieftains.

His known compositions are:

* ''Éri óg inis na náem''
* The ''[[Banshenchas]]'' (''Ádam óenathair na ndóene'')
* Eight poems in the lives of St. Mo Laisse and M'Áedóc
** ''Ca lion mionn ag Maodhócc''
** ''Cert Maodhócc ar shluagh Mhancach''
** ''Comhroinn Maodhócc, fa mór modh''
** ''Eittirbretha Maodhócc min''
** ''Uasal an mac, mac Setna''
** ''Cia is fearr cairt ar dháil mláisi''
** ''Cia thairngir mlaisi ria theacht''
** ''Molaisi eolach na heagna'' 
* ''Cuibdea comanmann na rig''
* ''Sé rígh déag Eoghain anall''

'''Hendrik Bernardus Thom''' (13 December 1905 &amp;ndash; 4 November 1983) was born in [[Jamestown, Eastern Cape|Jamestown]], [[Cape Colony]], and grew up in [[Burgersdorp]], [[South Africa]]. Because he was the 5th grandchild of his grandfather and namesake with the first names Hendrik Bernardus, his parents decided to call him by the nickname Quintus ("Five") to distinguish him from his cousins; he was known as Quintie Thom throughout his life.
He matriculated at Burgersdorp High School and studied at [[Stellenbosch University]] (BA History and Dutch, ''cum laude'', 1926 and MA History, ''cum laude'', 1928). He continued his studies in history in Germany at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Friedrich Wilhelms Universität]] in Berlin (1928–1929), at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] in Paris (1930) and in Amsterdam, researching his doctoral thesis, which he completed on his return to Stellenbosch. The title of his doctoral thesis (Ph.D., 1930) was: ''Die geskiedenis van die skaapboerdery in Suid-Afrika'' (The history of sheep farming in South Africa).

During the next year he was appointed as Lecturer of History at the Stellenbosch University, and promoted to Senior Lecturer in 1935. In 1937 he was appointed as professor of history at the same institution.
[[File:HBThom .jpg|thumb|Prof HB Thom]]From 1954 H.B. Thom was Rector of the Stellenbosch University until his retirement in 1969. In 1983 he was voted Chancellor, but he died at the end of the same year having served as Chancellor of the university for only nine months. The HB Thom theatre at the university was named in his honour.

H.B. Thom enjoyed tennis, fishing and photography and married Maria du Toit in 1934; the marriage was childless.

He played a major role in the cultural life of the Afrikaner people, and wrote a number of important historical books.

He served on the ''Archives Commission'' (Argiefkommissie) and acted as chairman from 1950 to 1955. He was a member of the ''Historical Monuments Commission'' (Historiese Monumentekommissie, later Raad vir Nasionale Gedenkwaardighede), 1948–1954; ''Van Riebeeck-Vereniging''; ''Simon van der Stel Foundation''; ''Stellenbosch Museum'' and chairman of its Board of Trustees, 1962 - 1968.

He received honorary memberships of the following organisations:
* Nederlandse Koninklijke Akademie voor Wetenschappen 1952
* Maatschappij der Nederlandse Letterkunde te Leiden
* Linschoten Vereniging
* The Hakluyt Society
* Suid-Afrikaanse Akademie vir Wetenskap en Kuns 1981
* Suid-Afrikaanse Historiese Vereniging

For 18 years he was chairman of the ''FAK'' (Federasie van Afrikaanse Kultuurvereniginge) and he was a sought after speaker.
He served as Administrator of the ''Woordeboek van die Afrikaanse Taal'' (WAT).

'''Hayden White''' (July 12, 1928 – March 5, 2018) was an American [[historian]] in the tradition of [[literary criticism]], perhaps most famous for his work ''[[Metahistory: The Historical Imagination in Nineteenth-Century Europe]]'' (1973/2014). He claimed that the manifest historical text{{Jargon-inline|date=September 2018}} is marked by strategies of explanation, which include explanation by argument, explanation by emplotment, and explanation by ideological implication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Metahistory: The Historical Imagination in Nineteenth-century Europe|last=White|first=Hayden|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=1975|isbn=9780801817618|location=Baltimore|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that historical writing was influenced by literary writing in many ways, sharing the strong reliance on narrative for meaning, therefore eliminating the possibility of objective or truly scientific history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = White | first = Hayden | title = Interpretation in History | journal = New Literary History | date = Winter 1973 | volume = 4 | issue =  | pages = 281–314 | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; White also argued, however, that history is most successful when it uses this "narrativity", since it is what allows history to be meaningful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = White | first = Hayden | title = The value of narrativity in the representation of reality | journal = Critical Inquiry | date = Autumn 1980 | volume = 1 | pages = 5–27 | issue =  | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He ended his career as [[Professor|University Professor Emeritus]]&lt;ref&gt;https://histcon.ucsc.edu/faculty/singleton.php?&amp;singleton=true&amp;cruz_id=hayden&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[history of consciousness]] department of the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]], having previously retired from the [[comparative literature]] department of [[Stanford University]].

==Career==
White received his B.A. from [[Wayne State University]] (1951) and his M.A. (1952) and Ph.D. (1955) degrees from the [[University of Michigan]]. While an undergraduate at Wayne State, White studied history under William J. Bossenbrook alongside then-classmate [[Arthur Danto]].&lt;ref name=hat /&gt;

In 1998, White directed a seminar ("The Theory of the Text") at the [[School of Criticism and Theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=William B.|title=Robert Louis Stevenson Reconsidered: New Critical Perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OINf5fU1mKwC&amp;pg=PA63|accessdate=8 February 2012|year=2003|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-1399-7|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawsuit against the LAPD==
White figured prominently in a landmark [[California Supreme Court]] case regarding covert intelligence gathering on college campuses by police officers in the [[Los Angeles Police Department]].  ''White v. Davis'', 13 Cal.3d 757, 533 P.2d 222, 120 Cal. Rptr. 94 (1975).  During 1972, while a professor of history at [[UCLA]] and acting as sole plaintiff, White sued Chief of Police [[Edward M. Davis]], alleging the illegal expenditure of public funds in connection with covert intelligence gathering by police at UCLA.  The covert activities included police officers registering as students, taking notes of discussions occurring in classes, and making police reports on these discussions.  ''White v. Davis'', at 762.  The Supreme Court found for White in a unanimous decision.  This case set the standard that determines the limits of legal police surveillance of political activity in [[California]]; police cannot engage in such surveillance in the absence of reasonable suspicion of a crime ("Lockyer Manual").

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3402">'''Ka'b Ibn Mama al-Iyadi''' ({{lang-ar|كعب بن مامة الإيادي}}) was a pre-[[Islamic]] [[Arab]] figure proverbial for his munificence, and in particular for "giving water to a companion and himself dying of thirst as result".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rowson|first=Everett K.|title=Religion and Politics in the Career of Badîʿ al-Zamân al-Hamadhânî |journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|year=1987|volume=107|issue=4|pages=653–673|jstor=603306|publisher=American Oriental Society|doi=10.2307/603306}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Ibn Abd Rabbih|Ibn `Abd Rabbih]], he was one of three people who reached the highest point of generosity in the pre-Islamic era, the other two were [[Hatim al-Tai]] and [[Harim ibn Sinan al-Murri]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn Abd Rabbih|Ibn `Abd Rabbih (Aḥmad ibn Muḥammad)]], Al-‘Iqd al-farīd&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaʻb died of [[dehydration]] in one of his travels when he favored his companion, al-Namari ({{lang-ar|النمَّري}}), over himself for the remaining water they had carried. His story with al-Namari displays a high degree of ''i'thar'' ([[altruism]]), a trait which the pre-Islamic Arabs regarded with great admiration.

== Story with al-Namari ==

While traveling in the scorching heat of the sun with a company that included a man from al-Namr ibn Qasit, the group ran short of water and decided to split all the water they had carried equally amongst them. Each time the man who served the water turned around the group and reached Kaʻb for his share, Kaʻb's companion, al-Namari, would look upon Kaʻb and stare at him with an appeal for the water, to which Kaʻb responded by telling the server: "Serve your brother al-Namari" ({{lang-ar|اسق أخاك النمري}}) which later became a classical Arabic proverb. This was done repeatedly until Kaʻb became completely exhausted and weak that the moment they found a well some time later, he wasn't able to move and eventually died of thirst.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn al-Sayyid al-Baṭalyawsī (‘Abd Allah ibn Muḥammad), Ḥulal fī sharḥ abyāt al-jumal, p.104. الحلل في شرح أبيات الجُمَل,

The '''Korean Archaeological Society''' is a professional and scholarly association of archaeologists in [[South Korea]]. The Society publishes the peer-reviewed ''Journal of the Korean Archaeological Society'' ([[Hanja]]: {{lang|ko-Hani|韓國考古學報}}; [[Revised Romanization of Korean|RR]]: ''Hanguk Kogo-Hakbo''). This journal is the South Korean equivalent of scholarly archaeological journals such as ''[[American Antiquity]]'', ''[[Kaogu]]'', ''[[Antiquity (journal)|Antiquity]]'', and ''Kokogaku Kenkyu''. The Society also hosts a national conference every year in early November.   

The organization has been around in one form or another since the Koreanization of archaeology began in the wake of [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese colonial rule in Korea]] (c. 1910–1945). Antecedents of the Korean Archaeological Society include the Korean Art Historical Society (''Hanguk Misulsa Hakhwoe'') and the Korean Archaeology and Ancient Art History Society ({{lang|ko-Hani|考古美術同人會}}; ''Gogo Misul Dongin Hwoe''), the latter of which was formed in 1961. The first issue of the journal ''Archaeology and Ancient Art History'' ({{lang|ko-Hani|考古美術}}; ''Gogo Misul'') was published the previous year. In 1968 the name of the journal was changed to ''Studies in Art History'' ({{lang|ko-Hani|美術史硏究}}; ''Misulsahak Yeongu'').  

==Origins==
The year 1967 also marked the foundation of another academic society by Kim Je-won, the Head of the Korean National Museum, along with a small coterie of scholars including [[Kim Won-yong]], Kim Jeong-gi, Yun Mu-byeong, Han Byeong-sam, Im Hyo-jae, and several others (Yoon 2006:265). These scholars were concerned about publicizing archaeological excavations in Korea more than anything else, and together they published the first issue of a journal called ''Archaeology'' (''Gogohak'') in 1968. Subsequent issues were published occasionally between 1969 and 1979.

Yet another competing group emerged in 1967: the Association of Korean Archaeology ({{lang|ko-Hani|韓國考古學協會}}; ''Hanguk Gogohak Hyeophoe''). This group was led by the ancient-historian/archaeologist Kim Gi-ung of [[Dong-A University]].

===Consolidation===
In 1976, Kim Won-yong and 38 other scholars met at [[Korea University]] for a conference and formed what is essentially the modern version of the Korean Archaeological Society. However, the name adopted in the meeting, the Society of Korean Archaeological Studies (''Hanguk Gogohak Yeongu Hakhoe'') slightly differs from the name used today. During the same meeting, they officially dissolved the old Association of Korean Archaeology. Kim was installed as the first President of the Society. The regular publication of ''Hanguk Gogo-Hakbo'' began from this time.
In 1986 the Korean Archaeological Society adopted its present name.

==Structure and administration==
The Society is hosted and run on a rotating basis by university departments and other institutions for a period of approximately 1-2 years. The current host of the Society is the Department of History at Sungsil University, [[Seoul]]. The current President of the Korean Archaeological Society is Professor Choi Byeong-hyeon of the Department of History, Sungsil University. Choi was became president in mid-2006. The former president of the Korean Archaeological Society is the Professor Lee Baek-kyu of [[Kyungpook National University|Gyeongbuk National University]] in Daegu.

The society has several thousand individual members in South Korea who consist of regular (i.e. professors, instructors, researchers) and student members. University libraries around the world subscribe to the ''Journal of the Korean Archaeological Society'' as institutional members. Most of the hundred or so individual members from outside South Korea live in [[Japan]]. This is emblematic of the good work that Korean and Japanese professional archaeologists have accomplished in establishing friendly and mutually beneficial relations. 

The Korean Archaeological Society has actively lobbied the South Korean central and provincial governments on important matters related to the preservation and protection of Korean cultural heritage. They also offer periodic professional workshops for archaeologists in South Korea.

===Journal===
The Korean Archaeological Society published its 60th issue of ''Hanguk Kogo-Hakbo'' with a 30th anniversary issue in Autumn 2006.

The majority of those who read and contributed articles to the journal until the 1990s were ancient historians and historical archaeologists. As such, the subject matter dealt with in the journal was heavily weighted to the [[Korean Three Kingdoms]] Period and culture. In the last 15 years the scope of Korean salvage and academic archaeological excavations has widened considerably, and thus the content of the journal has changed to reflect that. Now the journal has published articles ranging chronologically from the Korean Palaeolithic to the [[Jeulmun pottery period|Jeulmun]], [[Mumun pottery period|Mumun]], and [[Samhan|Protohistoric]] periods.

The '''Longhua Temple''' ({{zh|s={{linktext|龙|华|寺}}|t={{linktext|龍|華|寺}}|p={{linktext|Lóng|húa| Sì}}''; &lt;small&gt;[[Shanghainese]]&lt;/small&gt;:'' Lon-ngu-zy}}, literally ''"[[Lustre (mineralogy)|Lustre]] of the [[Chinese dragon|Dragon]] Temple''") is a [[Buddhist temple]] dedicated to the [[Maitreya|Maitreya Buddha]] located in [[Shanghai]]. Although most of the present-day buildings date from later reconstructions, the temple preserves the architectural design of a [[Song dynasty]] (960&amp;ndash;1279) monastery of the [[Chinese Chán|Chan School]]. It is the largest, most authentic and complete ancient temple complex in the city of Shanghai.{{sfnb|Zi Yan|2012|p=78&amp;ndash;79}}

==History==
[[Image:Longhua temple1.JPG|right|thumb|Newly constructed front gate of Longhua. The site of the original gates, further in front, is now marked by two standing pillars and a set of original stone lions.]]

The temple was first built in 242 AD, during the [[Three Kingdoms Period]] (220&amp;ndash;165). According to a legend, [[Sun Quan]], King of the [[Eastern Wu|Kingdom of Wu]] (222&amp;ndash;280), had obtained [[Ringsel|Sharira]] relics, which are cremated remains of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. To house these precious relics, the king ordered the construction of 13 pagodas. Longhua Pagoda ({{zh|s=龙华塔|t=|labels=no}}), part of the Longhua temple complex, is said to have been one of them. Like the function of the pagoda, the name of the temple also has its origin in a local legend according to which a dragon once appeared on the site.{{sfnb|Zi Yan|2012|p=78&amp;ndash;79}}

The temple was destroyed by war towards the end of the [[Tang dynasty]] (618&amp;ndash;907) and rebuilt in 977 AD, under the autonomous Kingdom of [[Wuyue]] during the [[Song dynasty|Northern Song dynasty]] period (960&amp;ndash;1127). (According to another version of the story, as contained in [[Song dynasty|Song]] (960&amp;ndash;1279) and [[Yuan dynasty]] (1271&amp;ndash;1368) local histories, the temple was first built by the King of [[Wuyue]].) Later in the Song dynasty, in 1064, it was renamed "Kongxiang Temple" ({{zh|s=空相寺|t=|labels=no}}), but the original name "Longhua Temple" was restored in the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368&amp;ndash;1644) during the reign of the [[Wanli Emperor]] (1573&amp;ndash;1620).

The present architectural design follows the [[Song dynasty]] (960&amp;ndash;1279) original. However, whereas the core of the present Longhua Pagoda survives from that period, most buildings in the temple proper were rebuilt during the reigns of the [[Tongzhi Emperor]] (1862&amp;ndash;1874) and the [[Guangxu Emperor]] (1875&amp;ndash;1908) in the [[Qing dynasty]] (1644&amp;ndash;1911). A modern restoration of the entire temple complex was carried out in 1954.

The temple and monastery were originally surrounded by extensive gardens and orchards. Viewing of the peach blossom in the Longhua gardens was an annual attraction for people in surrounding cities.

The temple grounds have been used as a site for internment as well as for executions. Public executions were held on the site in the 19th century. In 1927, the [[Kuomintang]] carried out a purge of suspected communists in Shanghai. Thousands of victims of this purge were brought to the temple grounds to be executed. They are commemorated today by the Longhua Martyrs Cemetery behind the temple. During the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], the [[Japanese people|Japanese]] operated their largest civilian internment camp in the area, where [[United States|American]], [[Great Britain|British]], as well as nationals of other [[Allies of World War II|allied countries]] were held under poor conditions.

The temple's extensive gardens have since been almost entirely absorbed into the neighbouring Longhua Martyrs Cemetery and have been extensively reconstructed in a contemporary monumental style. A small traditional garden remains immediately adjacent to the temple buildings.

==Architectural design and artwork==
[[Image:500lohan longhuatemple.jpg|right|thumb|Statues of the 500 arhats]]
[[Image:Longhua Pagoda.JPG|thumb|right|The exterior of the Longhua Pagoda]]

The Longhua Temple occupies an area of more than {{Convert|20000|m2|sqft|-3}} and the main axis of the compound is {{Convert|194|m|ft}} long. The tallest structure is the Longhua Pagoda which stands {{Convert|40.4|m|ftin}} high.

The layout of the temple is that of a Song dynasty monastery of the Buddhist Chan sect, known as the ''Sangharama Five-Hall Style''. Five main halls are arranged along a central north-south pointing axis. From the entrance, the buildings are:

===Maitreya Hall===
The Maitreya Hall housing a statue of [[Maitreya]] buddha and another in his manifestation as "[[Budai]]", or ''Cloth bag monk''.

===Four Heavenly Kings Hall===
The [[Four Heavenly Kings Hall]] housing statues of the [[Four Heavenly Kings]].

===Mahavira Hall===
The [[Mahavira Hall]] is the main hall, housing statues of the historical Buddha ([[Shakyamuni]]) and two disciples. At the back of the hall is a bas-relief carving, including a depiction of [[Guanyin]], or the Buddistava [[Avalokiteśvara]] in his female manifestation. Around the front portion are arranged the twenty Guardians of Buddhist Law, and around the back the sixteen principal [[arhat]]s. The hall also features an ancient bell cast in 1586, during the [[Wanli Emperor|Wanli]] era of the [[Ming dynasty]].

===Three Sages Hall===
The Three Sages Hall ({{zh|s=三圣殿|t=|labels=no}}) houses statues of the [[Amitabha]] buddha, and the Buddistavas [[Avalokiteśvara]] (male form) and Mahāsthāmaprāpta.

===Abbot's Hall===
The Abbot's Hall ({{zh|s=方丈室|t=|labels=no}}) is a place for lectures and formal meetings.

===Bell tower and Drum tower===
A Bell Tower and a Drum Tower are arranged off the central axis. The Bell Tower houses a copper [[Bell (instrument)|bell]] cast in 1382, the bell is {{convert|2|m|adj=on}} tall, has a maximum diameter of {{convert|1.3|m|adj=on}}, and weighs {{convert|5000|kg|adj=on}}. The bell is used in the ''Evening Bell-Striking Ceremony'' conducted on New Year's Eve. Also situated off the main axis is a shrine to [[Ksitigarbha]] (Dizang the King Bodhissatva).

===Buddhist Texts Library===
The [[Buddhist Texts Library]] houses various versions of Buddhist [[sutra]]s and other Buddhist works, as well as ceremonial instruments, antiques, and artefacts.

Artworks in the temple include statues of the Maitreya Buddha in his [[Bodhisattva]] form and in his ''Cloth Bag Monk'' incarnation, statues of the [[Eighteen Arhats]] and 20 Guardians of Buddhist Law, as well as statues of the 500 [[arhat]]s.

===Longhua Pagoda===
[[Image:Longhuata300x400.jpg|right|thumb|Longhua Pagoda]]

The Longhua Pagoda is best well-known of the 16 historic pagodas that still stand within the Shanghai municipality. It has an octagonal floor layout. The size of the seven storeys decreases from the bottom to the top. The pagoda consists of a hollow, tube-like brick core surrounded by a wooden staircase. On the outside, it is decorated with balconies, banisters, and upturned eaves. These outer decorations have been reconstructed in keeping with the original style.{{sfnb|Zi Yan|2012|p=78&amp;ndash;79}}

Although previous pagodas existed on the same site, the current brick base and body of the pagoda was built in 977 under the [[Wuyue]] kingdome (907&amp;ndash;978), with continuous renovations of its more fragile wooden components on the exterior. Because of its age, the pagoda is fragile and is not open to the public.{{sfnb|Zi Yan|2012|p=78&amp;ndash;79}}

==Temple fair==
The Longhua Temple Fair has been held since the [[Ming dynasty]] annually on the third day of the third month of the [[Lunar Calendar]], when - according to local legend - the dragons visit the temple to help grant the people's wishes. It coincides with the blossoming of the peach trees in Longhua Park. Since its inception, the fair has been an annual event interrupted only by the [[Cultural Revolution]] and the [[Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome|SARS]] outbreak.

==Location==
The Longhua Temple is located on the Longhua area (formerly Longhua township) of Shanghai (named after the temple). Its street address is No. 2853 Longhua Road (Longhua Lu). It is open to the public for a fee (10 [[Renminbi|RMB]]) which includes incense.{{Citation needed|reason=I didn't get any incense! (2 January 2010)|date=January 2010}}

==In popular culture==
[[J.G. Ballard]] in his World War II-era autobiographical novel ''[[Empire of the Sun]]'' describes the Japanese military use of the Longhua pagoda as a flak cannon tower.  In Steven Spielberg's film adaptation of the book, the pagoda is clearly visible above the prison camp.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

'''Paleodemography''' is the study of human [[demography]] in [[ancient history|antiquity]] and [[prehistory]].
More specifically, paleodemography looks at the changes in pre-modern populations in order to determine something about the influences on the lifespan and health of earlier peoples.

Reconstruction of ancient population sizes and dynamics are based on [[bioarchaeology]], [[ancient DNA]] as well as inference from modern [[population genetics]].

==Skeletal analysis==
Skeletal analysis can also yield information such as an estimation of age at time of death. There are numerous methods that can be used,&lt;ref name="Estimation of age in the living_Aggrawal"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Aggrawal |first=A. | title=Estimation of age in the living: in matters civil and criminal | journal=J Anat | year=2009 | pmid=19470083 |format=PDF |url=http://anilaggrawal.com/ij/sundry/news_and_notes/estimation%20of%20age%20in%20the%20living_j_anatomy_2009.pdf | doi=10.1111/j.1469-7580.2009.01048.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is best to field questions of further interest to an osteologist or [[Bioarchaeology|bioarchaeologist]]. In addition to [[age estimation]] and [[sex estimation]], someone versed in basic [[osteology]] can ascertain a [[minimum number of individuals]] (or MNI) in cluttered contexts—such as in mass graves or an [[ossuary]]. This is important, as it is not always obvious how many bodies compose the bones sitting in a heap as they are excavated.

Occasionally, historical disease prevalnce for illnesses such as [[leprosy]] can also be determined from bone restructuring and deterioration.  [[Paleopathology]], as these investigations are called, can be useful in accurate estimation of [[mortality rate]]s.

== Genetic analysis ==
The increasing availability of [[DNA sequencing]] since the late 1990s has allowed estimates on Paleolithic [[effective population size]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Drummond |first=A. J. |last2=Rambaut |first2=A. |last3=Shapiro |first3=B. |last4=Pybus |first4=O.

Such models suggest a human effective population size of the order of 10,000 individuals for the [[Late Pleistocene]].

Our findings are consistent with this hypothesis, but, depending on the mutation rate, we find either an effective population size of NA = 12,000 (95% C.I. = 9,000–15,500 when averaging over all three demographic models) using the mutation rate calibrated with the human-chimp divergence or an effective population size of NA = 32,500 individuals (95% C.I. = 27,500–34,500) using the mutation rate given by whole-genome trio analysis (The 1000 Genomes Project Consortium 2010) (supplementary figure 4 and table 6, Supplementary Material online). Not surprisingly, the estimated effective mutation rates ? = 4NAµ are comparable for the two mutation rates we considered, and are equal to 1.4 × 10&lt;sup&gt;?3&lt;/sup&gt;/bp/generation (95% C.I. = (1.1–1.7) × 10&lt;sup&gt;?3&lt;/sup&gt;). Relating the estimated effective population size to the census population size during the Pleistocene is a difficult task because there are many factors affecting the effective population size (Charlesworth 2009). Nevertheless, based on published estimates of the ratio between effective and census population size, a comprehensive value on the order of 10% has been found by Frankham (1995). This 10% rule roughly predicts that 120,000–325,[0]00 individuals (depending on the assumed mutation rate)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The authors also note that their model disfavours the assumption of an early (pre-''[[Recent African origin of modern humans|Out-of-Africa]]'') population bottleneck 
affecting all of ''Homo sapiens''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sjödin|Sjöstrand|Jakobsson|Blum|2012|loc=In contrast to the bottleneck theory, we show that a simple model without any bottleneck during the penultimate ice age has the greatest statistical support compared to bottleneck models.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''partition of Bosnia and Herzegovina''' was discussed and attempted during the 20th century. The issue came to prominence during the [[Bosnian War]], which also involved [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]'s largest neighbors, [[Croatia]] and [[Serbia]]. {{As of|2018}}, the country remains one state while internal [[political divisions of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] based on the 1995 [[Dayton Agreement]] remain in place.

==Background==
[[File:Scs kingdom provinces 1920 1922 en.png|thumb|right|300px|Provinces of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] in 1920-1922.]]
{{main|History of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}
Bosnia and Herzegovina has been a single entity occupying roughly the same territory since the rise of the medieval [[Kingdom of Bosnia]] and the subsequent [[Ottoman conquest of Bosnia]] between the 1380s and 1590s. The borders of today's Bosnia and Herzegovina were largely set as the borders of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]-era [[Eyalet of Bosnia]], fixed in the south and west by the 1699 [[Treaty of Karlowitz]], in the north by the 1739 [[Treaty of Belgrade]], and in the east by the 1878 [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]].

Although formally under Ottoman sovereignty, [[Austria-Hungary]] occupied the territory and created the [[Condominium of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in 1878 before officially annexing it in 1908. Following [[World War I]] and the dissolution of Austria-Hungary, the territory passed in whole to the newly formed [[Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] in 1918. In 1922, it was internally divided into six [[oblasts of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]].

==Kingdom of Yugoslavia==
[[File:Banovine Jugoslavia.png|thumb|250px|Yugoslav banovinas in 1929]]
In 1929, the oblasts were replaced with four [[Banovinas of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], but all of them also included regions outside of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The [[Cvetković-Maček agreement]] that created the [[Banovina of Croatia]] in 1939 encouraged what was essentially a partition of Bosnia between [[Croatia]] and [[Serbia]].&lt;ref name=Imamovic&gt;Imamović, Mustafa (1996). Historija Bošnjaka. Sarajevo: BZK Preporod. {{ISBN|9958-815-00-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious|Cvetković-Maček agreement|reason=Serbian Banovina did not gain any land from the agreement|date=October 2017}} The agreement angered [[Bosniaks]], then known as Yugoslav Muslims, including the [[Yugoslav Muslim Organization]] (JMO) that denounced the agreement's partition of Bosnia and Herzegovina.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=57}}

==Yugoslav Wars==
During the [[Bosnian War]], it was proposed that BiH be divided into three ethnic states,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Helen E. Purkitt|title=World Politics 94/95|issue=15|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6it7wDZ5auEC|date=1 January 1994|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-1-56134-290-7|p=112–115|quote=Bosnia would be divided into three ethnically homogeneous states. The Croatian and Serbian states would be free to join Greater Croatia and Greater Serbia, respectively; the Bosnian-Muslim state would stand alone as an independent entity.}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Bosnian Muslim Republic]], a [[Republika Srpska|Serb Republic]], and a [[Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia|Croat Republic]].

The Serb and Croat political leadership agreed on a partition of Bosnia with the 1991 [[Karađorđevo agreement]] and the 1992 [[Graz agreement]], resulting in the Croat forces turning against the [[Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and the [[Croat–Bosniak War]] (1992&amp;ndash;94).&lt;ref&gt;Silber, L (1997), ''Yugoslavia: Death of a Nation''. Penguin Books, p.185&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, negotiations continued between Serb and Croat leaderships over the partitioning of Bosnia and Herzegovina.&lt;ref&gt;Lukic, Reneo; Lynch, Allen. 1996. ''Europe from the Balkans to the Urals. The Disintegration of Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press. p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Franjo Tuđman]] argued that Bosnia-Herzegovina should form part of the federal Croatian unit because it was linked historically to Croatia.&lt;ref name="ICTYblaskic2000"/&gt; Tuđman did not take a separate Bosnia seriously as shown by his comments to a television crew, saying "Bosnia was a creation of the Ottoman invasion [...] Until then it was part of Croatia, or it was a kingdom of Bosnia, but a Catholic kingdom, linked to Croatia."&lt;ref name=tanner2001&gt;{{cite book|last=Tanner|first=Marcus|title=Croatia: A nation forged in war (second edition)|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|location=New Haven and London|year=2001|isbn=978-0-300-09125-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981 Tuđman stated that a federal Bosnia-Herzegovina "was more often a source of new divisions between the Serb and Croat population than their bridge".&lt;ref name=tudjman1981&gt;{{cite book |last=Tuđman | first=Franjo|title=Nationalism in contemporary Europe |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] |year=1981 |isbn=0-914710-70-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Tuđman observed that from an ethnic and linguistic viewpoint most Bosniaks were of Croatian origin.&lt;ref name="ICTYblaskic2000"/&gt; He argued that a Bosniak identity could only benefit the Serbs and hence advance the timing of Bosnia's "reasonable territorial division".&lt;ref name=tudjman1981/&gt;

According to [[Warren Zimmermann]], the last [[United States Ambassador to Yugoslavia|US ambassador to Yugoslavia]], Tuđman claimed that Bosnia and Herzegovina should be divided between the Croats and the Serbs. "Tuđman admitted that he discussed these fantasies with Milošević, the [[Yugoslav Army]] leadership and the [[Bosnian Serbs]]," writes Zimmermann, "and they agreed that the only solution is to divide up Bosnia between Serbia and Croatia".&lt;ref name=mahmutcehajic2000&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mahmutćehajić|first1=Rusmir|last2=Jones|first2=Francis|last3=Bowder|first3=Marina|title=The Denial of Bosnia|publisher=[[Penn State University Press]]|page=47|year=2000|isbn=978-0-271-02030-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wXooH0vZVd4C&amp;pg=PA47|accessdate=2009-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=zimmermann1996&gt;{{cite book|last=Zimmermann|first=Warren|title=Origins of a Catastrophe: Yugoslavia and Its Destroyers|publisher=Times Books|year=1996|isbn=978-0-8129-6399-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=January 2013}} Zimmermann also testified about Tuđman's fears of an "Islamic fundamentalist state", referring to Izetbegović as a "fundamentalist front man for [[Turkey]]"  and accused them of "conspiring to create a Greater Bosnia" by "flooding Bosnia with 500,000 [[Turkish people|Turks]]."&lt;ref name=p49mahmutcehajic2000&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mahmutćehajić|first1=Rusmir|last2=Jones|first2=Francis|last3=Bowder|first3=Marina|title=The denial of Bosnia|publisher=[[Penn State University Press]]|year=2000|page=49|isbn=978-0-271-02030-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wXooH0vZVd4C&amp;pg=PA49|accessdate=2009-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mario Nobilo, a senior advisor to Tuđman, is reported by [[Tim Judah]] to have informed him directly that talks took place "to resolve the Yugoslav conflict by carving up the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and creating an Islamic buffer-state between them".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Creation of Islamic buffer state discussed in secret|date=12 July 1991 |publisher=The Times |first=Tim |last=Judah }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Testimonies of other American and British politicians such as Ambassador [[Herbert Okun]] (a US veteran diplomat) suggested that the meeting was about the division of Bosnia and Herzegovina.&lt;ref name="sense2007"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.sense-agency.com/icty/bh-partition-plans-in-form-of-a-stain.29.html?cat_id=1&amp;news_id=10205|title= BH partition plans in form of a stain | date=April 2, 2007 | publisher=Sense Tribunal |accessdate=2009-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paddy Ashdown]] also claimed that the division of Bosnia and Herzegovina between Croatia and Serbia was a goal of Tuđman's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kay |first=Sean |title=NATO and the future of European security |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc. |year=1998 |page=82 |chapter= |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Meurs |first=Wim |title=Prospects and Risks Beyond EU Enlargement: Southeastern Europe |publisher=VS Verlag |year=2003 |page=168 |chapter= |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[...] The common objective of the joint criminal enterprise was to ethnically recompose the territories targeted by the Bosnian-Serb leadership by drastically reducing the proportion of Bosnian Muslims and Bosnian Croats through expulsion. The Chamber finds that the crimes of deportation and forced transfer were the original crimes of this common objective. Mr Krajišnik gave the go-ahead for the expulsion programme to commence during a session of the Bosnian-Serb Assembly when he called for [and I quote], "implementing what we have agreed upon, the ethnic division on the ground".}}

The Trial Chamber found that the strategic plan of the Bosnian Serb leadership consisted of "a plan to link Serb-populated areas in BiH together, to gain control over these areas and to create a separate Bosnian Serb state, from which most non-Serbs would be permanently removed".&lt;ref name="ICTY: Radoslav Brđanin judgement"/&gt; It also found that media in certain areas focused only on [[Serbian Democratic Party (Bosnia and Herzegovina)|SDS]] policy and reports from [[Belgrade]] became more prominent, including the presentation of extremist views and promotion of the concept of a [[Greater Serbia]], just as in other parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina the concept of a [[Greater Croatia]] was openly advocated.&lt;ref name="ICTY: Dusko Tadic"/&gt;

On 13 October 1997, Croatian weekly ''[[Feral Tribune]]'' published a document drafted by the Bosnian HDZ in 1991 and signed by its leading members [[Mate Boban]], Vladimir Šoljić, Božo Raić, Ivan Bender, Pero Marković, [[Dario Kordić]] and others. It stated, among other things, that "[...] the Croat people in Bosnia-Herzegovina must finally undertake a decisive and active policy that should bring about the realisation of our centuries-old dream: a common Croatian state."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Plans for a 'Greater Croatia' (document)|url=http://www.bosnia.org.uk/bosrep/report_format.cfm?articleID=2910&amp;reportid=119|publisher=Bosnia Report|accessdate=26 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ICTY: Kordić and Čerkez verdict"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/kordic_cerkez/tjug/en/kor-tj010226e.pdf|title=Prosecutor v.

Based on the evidence of Croat attacks against Bosniaks, the ICTY Trial Chamber concluded in the ''Kordić and Čerkez case'' that by April 1993 Croat leadership had a common design or plan conceived and executed to ethnically cleanse Bosniaks from the [[Lašva Valley ethnic cleansing|Lašva Valley]].&lt;ref name="ICTY: Kordić and Čerkez verdict"/&gt; Kordić, as the local political leader, was found to be the planner and [[wikt:instigator|instigator]] of this plan. Further concluding that the [[Croatian Army]] was involved in the campaign, the ICTY defined the events as an international conflict between Bosnia and Herzegovina and [[Croatia]].&lt;ref name="HRW: Conflict between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/reports/2004/ij/icty/2.htm#_Toc62882594|title=HRW: Conflict between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kordić along with commander Mario Čerkez were sentenced to 25 and 15 years respectively.&lt;ref name="Judgement of Trial Chamber III in the Kordić and Čerkez Case"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/sid/8016|title=Judgement of Trial Chamber III in the Kordić and Čerkez Case| publisher = [[United Nations]] [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Tihomir Blaškić]] verdict, of March 2000, the Trial Chamber concluded "[...] that Croatia, and more specifically former President Tudjman, was hoping to partition Bosnia and exercised such a degree of control over the Bosnian Croats and especially the [[Croatian Defence Council|HVO]] that it is justified to speak of overall control."&lt;ref name =ICTYblaskic2000&gt;{{cite web|title= Prosecutor v.

[[Jadranko Prlić]], [[Bruno Stojić]], [[Slobodan Praljak]], [[Milivoj Petković]], [[Valentin Ćorić]], and Berislav Pušić were all charged with conducting a joint criminal enterprise with a purpose of politically and military subjugating, permanently removing and ethnically cleansing Bosniaks and other non-Croats from certain areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina in an effort to join these areas as part of a Greater Croatia.&lt;ref name="The Prosecutor v.

{{quote|[...] to about April 1994 and thereafter, various persons established and participated in a joint criminal enterprise to politically and militarily subjugate, permanently remove and [[ethnically cleanse]] [[Bosnian Muslims]] and other non-Croats who lived in areas on the territory of the [[Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] which were claimed to be part of the Croatian Community and later [[Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia|Republic of Herceg-Bosna]]; and to join these areas as part of a '[[Greater Croatia]]' whether in the short term or over time and whether as part of the Republic of Croatia or in close association with it. [...] The territorial ambition of the joint criminal enterprise was to establish a Croatian territory with the borders of the [[Croatian Banovina]], a [[territorial entity]] that existed from 1939 to 1941.}}

The Prosecution submitted that part of the Greater Croatia-Herceg-Bosna program had at least three important goals.&lt;ref name=view /&gt;&lt;ref name=huwu /&gt;

{{quote|First, it was clear to probably anyone who looked at it with any sort of intellectual objectivity that some municipalities and areas claimed by Herceg-Bosna were more Croat than others and with some of the areas on the fringes more toward the east, more towards Central Bosnia not having a strong Croat majority or even plurality. [...] As a second reason, as a matter of political, military, and economic practicalities and part of the ultimate what I will call horse trading with the Serbs and the Muslims, Tudjman and the Herceg-Bosna leaders recognised that they might have to give up or trade away some of the areas furthest from the core [[Banovina of Croatia|Banovina]] territory. [...] Third and equally important and as already mentioned, relocating Croats from other parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina and moving them into houses and flats which had been seized from or abandoned by Muslim families or Muslim families which have been expelled would make it more difficult, if not impossible, for the Muslims to return to those areas, their houses having been taken over by Croats.}}

{{main|Proposed secession of Republika Srpska}}
 [[File:Milorad Dodik mod.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Milorad Dodik]], the president of the Republika Srpska]]
Secessionist rhetoric in Bosnia and Herzegovina made a comeback after 2006, with the coming to power of the SNSD party in Republika Srpska, headed by [[Milorad Dodik]],&lt;ref&gt;Adis Maksic, [https://theses.lib.vt.edu/theses/available/etd-10252009-160522/unrestricted/Maksic_A_T_2009.pdf Referendum Discourse in Republic of Srpska Politics 2006- 2008: An Analysis of its Emergence and Performative Structure], Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; notwithstanding international experts such as James Ker-Lindsay had defined it as a "hollow threat" and an unfeasible plan.&lt;ref&gt;James Ker-Lindsay, [http://www.lse.ac.uk/europeanInstitute/research/LSEE/PDFs/Publications/KerLindsay%20-%20Hollow%20Threat%20of%20Secession%20in%20BiH.pdf The Hollow Threat of Secession in Bosnia and Herzegovina: Legal and Political Impediments to a Unilateral Declaration of Independence by Republika Srpska], LSEE, April 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 April 2015 the ruling SNSD party adopted a declaration entitled "Republika Srpska — free and independent — future and responsibility", stating its intention to organize a referendum on the independence of the Republika Srpska in case competences are not returned from the State to the Entities by 2017. The declaration also suggests that RS authorities might decide "by law which decisions made by the Bosnia and Herzegovina authorities shall be applicable on the territory of Republika Srpska".&lt;ref name=OHR48&gt;[http://www.securitycouncilreport.org/atf/cf/%7B65BFCF9B-6D27-4E9C-8CD3-CF6E4FF96FF9%7D/s_2015_841.pdf 48th report to the United Nations Security Council of the High Representative for Implementation of the Peace Agreement on Bosnia and Herzegovina], 5 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

RS president [[Milorad Dodik]] reiterated to the press the commitment to an independence referendum in the coming years if his demands are not met.&lt;ref&gt;"We have told everybody that we want a dialogue. If you do not want to have a dialogue with us, if you do not want to harmonize Bosnia and Herzegovina with Dayton, in 2017 our proposal will be a referendum on the status of the RS.

The proposal will be an independent state." Milorad Dodik, ''Blic online/FENA'', Istocno Sarajevo SNSD Congress, 25 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; His stated political goal is to scale back the institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the letter of the 1995 Dayton Peace Agreement, undoing the developments of the last twenty years including the Court of BiH and BiH Prosecutor's Office, as well as tweak such letter by getting rid of international judges sitting in the BiH Constitutional Court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bosniatoday.ba/republika-srpska-to-hold-independence-referendum-in-2018/ Bosnia Today], 25 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Physiocracy''' ({{Lang-fr|Physiocratie}}; from the [[Greek language|Greek]] for "government of nature") is an [[economic theory]] developed by a group of 18th-century [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] French [[economists]] who believed that the wealth of nations was derived solely from the value of "land [[agriculture]]" or "[[land development]]" and that agricultural products should be highly priced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=physiocrat|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/physiocrat?q=physiocracy#physiocrat__5|work=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=27 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their theories originated in [[France]] and were most popular during the second half of the 18th century. Physiocracy is one of the first well-developed theory of [[economics]].

The movement was particularly dominated by [[François Quesnay]] (1694–1774) and [[Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot]] (1727–1781).&lt;ref name="Steiner 2003 p62"&gt;Steiner (2003), pp. 61–62&lt;/ref&gt; It immediately preceded the first modern school, [[classical economics]], which began with the publication of [[Adam Smith]]'s ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' in 1776.

The most significant contribution of the physiocrats was their emphasis on productive work as the source of national wealth. This is in contrast to earlier schools, in particular [[mercantilism]], which often focused on the ruler's wealth, accumulation of gold, or the [[balance of trade]]. Whereas the mercantilist school of economics said that value in the products of society was created at the point of sale,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; by the seller exchanging his products for more money than the products had "previously" been worth, the physiocratic school of economics was the first to see labor as the sole source of value.  However, for the physiocrats, only agricultural labor created this value in the products of society.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Karl Marx and Frederick Engels (1988), pp. 348, 355, 358.&lt;/ref&gt;  All "industrial" and non-agricultural labors were "unproductive appendages" to agricultural labor.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

At the time the physiocrats were formulating their ideas, economies were almost entirely agrarian. That is presumably why the theory considered only agricultural labor to be valuable. Physiocrats viewed the production of goods and services as equivalent to the consumption of the agricultural surplus, since the main source of power was from human or animal muscle and all energy was derived from the surplus from agricultural production.  Profit in capitalist production was really only the "[[Economic Rent|rent]]" obtained by the owner of the land on which the agricultural production was taking place.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

"The physiocrats damned cities for their artificiality and praised more natural styles of living. They celebrated farmers."&lt;ref&gt;''Why Americans Value Rural Life'' by [[David B. Danbom]]&lt;/ref&gt; They called themselves ''[[Economist|Les Économistes]]'', but are generally referred to as physiocrats to distinguish them from the many schools of economic thought that followed them.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;'The Penguin Dictionary of Economics' George Bannock, R. E. Baxter and Evan Davis. 5th Edition. Penguin Books 1992 p. 329.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Precursors==
Physiocracy is an [[Agrarianism|agrarianist]] philosophy which developed in the context of the prevalent European rural society of the time. In the late [[Roman Republic]], the dominant [[Roman Senate|senatorial class]] was not allowed to engage in banking or commerce&lt;ref name="Byrd, 34"&gt;Byrd (1995), 34&lt;/ref&gt; but relied on their ''[[latifundia]]'', large plantations, for income. They circumvented this rule through freedmen proxies who sold surplus agricultural goods.

Other inspiration came from [[Economic history of China (pre-1911)|China's economic system]], then the largest in the world. Chinese society broadly distinguished [[four occupations]], with [[scholar-bureaucrats]] (who were also [[Gentry (China)|agrarian landlords]]) at the top and merchants at the bottom (because they did not produce but only distributed goods made by others). Leading physiocrats like [[François Quesnay]] were avid [[Confucianism|Confucianists]] who advocated China's agrarian policies.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Derk Bodde (2005), [http://www.learn.columbia.edu/nanxuntu/html/state/ideas.pdf Chinese Ideas in the West] p.6, Reprinted with permission in China: A Teaching Workbook, Asia for Educators, Columbia University&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars have advocated connections with the school of [[agriculturalism]], which promoted utopian communalism.&lt;ref&gt;Maverick, Lewis A. (1938). "Chinese Influences Upon the Physiocrats". Economic History 3.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the integral parts of physiocracy, [[laissez faire]], was adopted from Quesnay's writings on China,&lt;ref name=Baghdiantz&gt;{{cite book|last=Baghdiantz McCabe|first=Ina|title=Orientalism in Early Modern France: Eurasian Trade Exoticism and the Ancien Regime|year=2008|publisher=Berg Publishers|isbn=978-1-84520-374-0|pages=271–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; being a translation of the Chinese term [[wu wei]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clarke|first=J.J.|title=Oriental Enlightenment: The Encounter Between Asian and Western Thought|year=1997|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415133760|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept natural order of physiocracy originated from "Way of Nature" of Chinese Taoism.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==History==
[[Pierre Le Pesant, sieur de Boisguilbert]] served as a member of [[Louis XIV]]'s local administration of Paris, and wrote pamphlets and booklets on subjects related to his work: taxation, grain trade, and money. Le Pesant asserted that wealth came from [[homo economicus|self-interest]] and markets were connected by money flows (i.e. an expense for the buyer is revenue for the producer). Thus he realized that lowering prices in times of shortage – common at the time – was dangerous economically as it acted as a disincentive to production. Generally, Le Pesant advocated less government interference in the grain market, as any such interference would generate "anticipations" which would prevent the policy from working.&lt;ref name="Steiner 2003 p. 61"&gt;Steiner (2003), p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, if the government bought corn abroad, some people would speculate that there was likely to be a shortage and would buy more corn, leading to higher prices and more of a shortage. This was an early example of advocacy of free trade. In anonymously published tracts, [[Vauban]] proposed a system known as ''La dîme royale'': this involved major simplification of the French tax code by switching to a relatively [[flat tax]] on property and trade. Vauban's use of statistics contrasted with earlier empirical methods in economics.&lt;ref name="Steiner 2003 p62" /&gt;

Around the time of the [[Seven Years' War]] between France and England (1756–63), the physiocracy movement grew. Several journals appeared, signaling an increasing audience in France for new economic ideas. Among the most important were the ''Journal Œconomique'' (1721–72), which promoted [[agronomy]] and rational [[husbandry]] and the ''Journal du commerce'' (1759–62), which was heavily influenced by the Irishman [[Richard Cantillon]] (1680–1734), both dominated by physiocrats; the ''Journal de l'agriculture, du commerce et des finances'' (1765–74) and the ''Ephémérides du citoyen'' (1767–72 and 1774–76).&lt;ref name="Steiner 2003 p62"/&gt;

Also, [[Jean Claude Marie Vincent de Gournay|Vincent de Gournay]] (1712–1759), the [[Intendant|Intendant du commerce]], brought together a group of young researchers including [[François Véron Duverger de Forbonnais]] (1722–1800) and one of the two most famous physiocrats, [[Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot]] (1727–1781). The other, [[François Quesnay]] (1694–1774), was among those writing prolifically in contemporaneous journals.&lt;ref name="Steiner 2003 p62"/&gt;

In the 19th century [[Henry George]] in the United States advocated the collection of [[land rent]] as the primary if not the sole source of public revenue.

== ''Tableau économique'' ==
The ''[[Tableau économique]]'' or ''Economic Table'' is an economic model first described by [[François Quesnay]] in 1759, which laid the foundation of the physiocrats’ economic theories.&lt;ref name="Spiegel 1983 p.189"&gt;Henry William Spiegel (1983) ''The Growth of Economic Thought'', Revised and Expanded Edition, Duke University Press. pp. 189, 195–96&lt;/ref&gt; It also contains the origins of modern ideas on the circulation of wealth and the nature of interrelationships in the economy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The model Quesnay created consisted of three economic agents: the "proprietary" class consisted only of landowners; the "productive" class consisted of agricultural laborers; the "sterile" class was made up of artisans and merchants. The flow of production and cash between the three classes originated with the proprietary class because they owned the land and bought from both of the other classes.

== Characteristics ==

===Natural order===
The physiocrats thought there was a "[[Natural order (philosophy)|natural order]]" that allowed human beings to live together. Men did not come together via a somewhat arbitrary "[[social contract]]".  Rather, they had to discover the laws of the natural order that would allow individuals to live in society without losing significant freedoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofeconomi00gideiala|title=A history of economic doctrines from the time of the physiocrats to the present day|last=Rist|first=Charles|last2=Gide|first2=Charles|year=1915|publisher=D.C. Heath and Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept of natural order had originated in China. The Chinese had believed that there can be good government only when a perfect harmony exists between the "Way of Man" (governmental institutions) and the "Way of Nature" (Quesnay's natural order).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Individualism and laissez-faire===
{{main|Individualism|Laissez-faire}}
The physiocrats, especially Turgot, believed that self-interest was the motivation for each segment of the economy to play its role. Each individual is best suited to determine what goods they want and what work would provide them with what they want out of life. While a person might labor for the benefit of others, they will work harder for their own benefit; however, each person's needs are being supplied by many other people. The system works best when there is a complementary relationship between one person's needs and another person's desires, and so trade restrictions place an unnatural barrier to achieving one's goals. Laissez-faire was popularized by physiocrat [[Vincent de Gournay]] who is said to have adopted the term from [[François Quesnay]]'s writings on China.&lt;ref name=Baghdiantz/&gt;

===Private property===
None of the theories concerning the value of land could work without strong legal support for the ownership of private property. Combined with the strong sense of individualism, private property becomes a critical component of the Tableau's functioning.
The physiocrats believed in the institution of private property. They saw property as a tree and its branches, as social institutions.
They actually stated that landlords must enjoy 2/5 on the land surpluses. They also advocated that landlords should be given dues, otherwise they would take the land away from the cultivators.

===Diminishing returns===
{{main|Diminishing returns}}
Turgot was one of the first to recognize that "successive applications of the variable input will cause the product to grow, first at an increasing rate, later at a diminishing rate until it reaches a maximum."&lt;ref name="Spiegel 1983 p.189" /&gt; This was a recognition that the productivity gains required to increase national wealth had an ultimate limit, and, therefore, wealth could not be infinite.

===Investment capital===
Both Quesnay and [[Anne Robert Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune]] recognized that capital was needed by farmers to start the production process, and both were proponents of using some of each year’s profits to increase productivity. Capital was also needed to sustain the laborers while they produced their product. Turgot recognizes that there is opportunity cost and risk involved in using capital for something other than land ownership, and he promotes interest as serving a "strategic function in the economy".&lt;ref name="Spiegel 1983 p.189" /&gt;

==Subsequent developments==
The ideas of the Physiocrats had an influence on [[Adam Smith]], [[David Ricardo]], [[John Stuart Mill]], and above all [[Henry George]], who appears at first to have come to similar beliefs independently. George was the driving force behind what became known as the [[Single Tax]] movement (not to be confused with [[Flat Tax]]). The Single Tax is a proposal for the use of the annual rental value of land ([[land value taxation]]) as the principal or sole source of public revenue.

== The New Physiocrats ==
The New Physiocratic League, also known as the New Physiocrats, is the most recent development in Physiocratic ideology. It introduced a comprehensive platform rooted in the original Physiocratic philosophy, and expanded and updated it to be adopted by modern political platforms. The New Physiocrats advocate for an implementation of a variant of the [[Land value tax|Land Value Tax]], referred to as the Unified Location Tax, as a main source of government revenues, while returning all income taxes back to the labour market as an income supplement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://newphysiocrats.org/platform/|title=Economic Reform Platform {{!}} New Physiocrats|work=New Physiocrats|access-date=2018-03-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Marketing}}

In response to shifts in [[consumer behavior]] and conditions brought on by [[postmodernism]], many companies changed their [[marketing]] approach to address and create more nimble, immersive experience and customer engagements.  It is stated that the traditional means of [[brand management]] has grown increasingly hard and complex within the postmodern marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;Massi, Marta and Paul Harrison "Re-Imagining the Cultural Brand: Postmodernism and Next Wave", Academy of Marketing Conference (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;    A [[brand]] in its modernist or traditional interpretation by marketing schools of thought and accredited, professional associations is defined as a, “name, term, design, symbol or any other feature that identifies one seller’s good or services as distinct from those of other sellers.&lt;ref&gt;"Dictionary." [[American Marketing Association]]. http://www.marketingpower.com/_layouts/Dictionary.aspx. Retrieved 2011-06-29. The [[Marketing Accountability Standards Board (MASB)]] endorses this definition as part of its ongoing [http://www.themasb.org/projects/common-language-project/ Common Language: Marketing Activities and Metrics Project] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203165846/http://www.themasb.org/projects/common-language-project/ |date=2012-02-03 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  This definition, argued by Muzellec and McDonagh refers to the brand as a single reality or focus on only one-way addressable interaction partners that in many way are not current with customer communications.&lt;ref&gt;Muzellec, Laurent and Pierre McDonagh "Post-Modern Brand Management: The Virtual Case of Red Apple Cigarettes” in Halldór Örn Engilbertsson (Ed.), Proceedings of the 36th European Marketing Academy Conference, Reykjavik University, Reykjavik.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, many companies are rapidly changing the way they manage the created names, terms, designs, symbols and other marketing material on behalf of the brand.  The significance here is not only focusing on and tracking the organizational created material, but also identifying, monitoring and tracking the material created or suggested by the enthusiast, loyalist, defectors and the like.

In order to properly engage within the postmodern world of marketing a brand will need to adapt of set of new systems that that give great insights.

Newly developed systems are in need for a brand to be more nimble and personal with their customers.  Although this is an ever-evolving time it bears witness that there are new rules to the “new now” or “new new now” of marketing.  And although an [[organization]] employs any platforms and processes the brand manager should realize that the brand they are managing is still just a participant in the community they wish to create.  With that said, the organization should come to grips with the idea that they may not own the very brand they created.&lt;ref&gt;Massi, Marta and Paul Harrison "Re-Imagining the Cultural Brand: Postmodernism and Next Wave", Academy of Marketing Conference (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influential postmodern brands==

===Coke===
[[Coca-Cola|Coke]] is one of the more influential brands within the carbonated beverage industries.  Although they have experienced an ongoing soda war with [[Pepsi]] dating back to the 1960s, they have emerged recently with an approach, Wendy White implies as agnostic and focused on telling engaging stories no matter where the consumer is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zmuda |first=Natalie |title=How Pepsi Blinked, Fell Behind Diet Coke|url=http://adage.com/article/news/pepsi-blinked-fell-diet-coke/149496/|publisher=Ad Age}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, this approach allows the user to take part in the brand, identify with the story being told and engage in the way he or she feels fit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Building and Growing Brands in the Evolved Customer|url=http://www.livestream.com/adage/video?clipId=pla_10afca10-70c3-4637-adfa-4d23cfe76312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the approach the brand has seen great success in capturing the number two beverage position in terms of units sold while defending their legacy position as number one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zmuda |first=Natalie |title=How Pepsi Blinked, Fell Behind Diet Coke|url=http://adage.com/article/news/pepsi-blinked-fell-diet-coke/149496/|publisher=Ad Age}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Starbucks===
Although [[Starbucks]] has had minor setbacks in navigating the “new now”, postmodern marketing landscape (53% drop in profits in 2009),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Allison |first=Melissa |title=Starbucks Expect Sales in Existing Cafes to Drop in 2009 |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2008430875_retailreportdigestar25.html |work=Seattle Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;  they are still seen to be a leader in the space.  At the current writing of this document,{{when|date=February 2014}} the brand has over 25M likes on [[Facebook]] with 279 people talking about their brand online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Starbucks Brand Page|url=http://www.facebook.com/Starbucks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally the brand has also ushered in a sea of change by creating one of the most intuitive and innovative [[mobile apps]] in the market.  In partnership with mFoundry, Starbucks created a mobile payment application that is in current use nationwide&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Starbucks Card Mobile Page|url=http://www.mfoundry.com/starbucks-moble-case-study/|publisher=mFoundry}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and within the first two months of the application being live over 3M customers downloaded and used it.

If these two examples are not enough to illustrate the brands commitment to the postmodern model of consumer engagement the use and execution of the branded social network, “MyStarbucksIdea.com” does.  MyStarbucksIdea is a perfect example of giving up control of the brand to [[consumers]].  The [[social network]] allows consumers and loyalists to suggest ideas based on their personal experience with the company.  Based on these suggest and the recommendations for the community Starbucks is able to more efficiently plan strategic roadmaps around consumer interactions.  To date the brand has received over 120k ideas ranging from ordering, atmosphere, [[coffee]] and drinks to new technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=My Starbucks Idea |url=http://mystarbucksidea.force.com/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110619120505/http://mystarbucksidea.force.com/ |archivedate=2011-06-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''René Adolphe Schwaller de Lubicz''' (December 7, 1887 &amp;ndash; 1961), born René Adolphe Schwaller in [[Alsace-Lorraine]], was a French [[mysticism|mystic]] who popularized the [[pseudoarchaeology]] of [[sacred geometry]] in [[Egyptology]] during his study of the art and architecture of the [[Temple of Luxor]] in [[Egypt]] and his subsequent book ''The Temple In Man''.&lt;ref&gt;R. A. Schwaller de Lubicz, ''The Temple In Man: Sacred Architecture and The Perfect Man'' (Inner Traditions paperback, 1981). {{ISBN|0-89281-021-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
René Schwaller left home at the age of eighteen after having completed an apprenticeship with his father in [[Medicinal chemistry|pharmaceutical chemistry]]. Moving to Paris from Alsace to study modern chemistry and physics, he developed an interest in [[Alchemy]], reading every alchemical text he could find including those by [[Paracelsus]] and [[Ramon Llull]]. He also developed an interest in painting and became the student of [[Matisse]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Robert Lawlor, Translator's Preface to ''The Temple In Man''.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was given the title "de Lubicz" in 1919 by the Lithuanian writer, mystic and diplomat [[Oscar Milosz|Oscar Vladislas de Lubicz Milosz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Malkowski | first = Edward | authorlink = | title = Spiritual Technology of Ancient Egypt: Sacred Science and the Mystery of Consciousness | publisher = Deep Books | year = 2007 | url = | isbn = 1-59477-186-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also wrote under the mystical name 'Aor',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vandenbroeck|first=Andre|title=Al-Kemi: Hermetic, Occult, Political and Private Aspects of R.A.Schwaller De Lubicz|year=1987|publisher=Lindisfarne|isbn=978-0-940262-31-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wg2nYIYpLAEC&amp;pg=PA212&amp;dq=%22Schwaller+de+Lubicz%22++name+%22Aor%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=n5P9TvKtJ4208QO2gOnTAQ&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Schwaller%20de%20Lubicz%22%20%20name%20%22Aor%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Quest|year=2000|volume=88|title=Rene Schwaller de Lubicz and the Intelligence of the Heart|publisher=Theosophical Society in America}}&lt;/ref&gt; signifying "Light of the Higher Mind".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

He became a student of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] and [[Saint Yves d'Alveydre]]'s [[Synarchy]].

==Les Veilleurs==
Schwaller de Lubicz was the founder in 1919, with other members of the Theosophical Society, of the esoteric right-wing French group called ''Affranchis'', that published a journal ''L'Affranchi-Hiérarchie, Fraternité, Liberté, a monthly journal of art and philosophy'', dealing with a spiritual and social renewal within the framework of a mystical political philosophy. Its president was  René Bruyez. On 23 July 1919 the group dissolved and another group was formed in its place: ''Les Veilleurs'' ("the Vigilants"), to which (at least according to the historian Pierre Mariel) the young [[Rudolf Hess]] belonged. Its uniform consisted of a dark shirt, [[high-boot]]s and riding-breeches, akin to the ''[[Sturmabteilung]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Joscelyn Godwin, "Schwaller de Lubicz: les Veilleurs et la connexion Nazie", in ''Politica Hermetica'', number 5, pages 101-108 (Éditions L'Âge d'Homme, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Greer|first=John Michael|title=The new encyclopedia of the occult|year=2003|publisher=Llewellyn Worldwide|isbn=978-1-56718-336-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xAmMNnJlfnoC&amp;pg=PA501&amp;dq=R.+A.+Schwaller+de+Lubicz+les+veilleurs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Sq8OT-3fDMuFhQfBv-iTAg&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=R.%20A.%20Schwaller%20de%20Lubicz%20les%20veilleurs&amp;f=false|page=501}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joscelyn Godwin, ''Arktos: The Polar Myth in Science, Symbolism, and Nazi Survival'', pages 54-55 (Adventures Unlimited Press, 1996). {{ISBN|0-932813-35-6}}. For Hess being a member of ''Les Veilleurs'', Godwin cited Pierre Mariel, ''L'Europe païenne du XXe siècle, magie noire en Angleterre, tziganes, gitans et romanichels, l'Allemagne païenne'' (Paris, Genève: la Palatine, 1964).&lt;/ref&gt;

''Les Veilleurs'' delivered its manifesto in December 1919, its politics conveyed through a series of letters called "Appeals" and signed by its members. The letter signed by "Aor" was addressed "To the Jews", where he advised all Jews to "go back home". The first issue of its journal, ''Veilleur'', contained an anonymous [[anti-semitic]] article that first appeared in a Masonic journal from 1898.

The artist André VandenBroeck in his memoirs and biography of Schwaller de Lubicz described him as anti-semitic,&lt;ref&gt;André VandenBroeck, ''Al-Kemi: Hermetic, Occult, Political and Private Aspects of R.A.Schwaller De Lubicz''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Joscelyn Godwin]] commented "Schwaller de Lubicz was not sufficiently vindictive to persist in the course of action followed by Hess and Hitler, but nor was he sufficiently humane, it would seem, to regret his contribution to the currents of the time."&lt;ref&gt;Joscelyn Godwin, "Schwaller de Lubicz: les Veilleurs et la connexion Nazie".&lt;/ref&gt;

In his biography of Schwaller de Lubicz, ''La Vie et loeuvre de Rene Schwaller de Lubicz'',&lt;ref&gt;Erik Sablé, La vie et l'œuvre de René Schwaller de Lubicz (Éditions Dervy, Paris, 2003). {{ISBN|2-84454-173-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Erik Sable writes, "The feigned Nazi connections of de Lubicz, some purportedly claim, are spurious, unfounded, and totally without merit; which only exposes the shallow nature of those authors who succumb to the victor’s stories." It should be noted in this context that in his writings, Schwaller de Lubicz often referred to the books of Moses in the same light as Egyptian theocratic philosophy—as containing universal esoteric principles.

==Suhalia==
During the 1920s with his wife Isha, Schwaller de Lubicz established in Switzerland the ''Station Scientifique Suhalia'', a research centre consisting of "laboratories for physics, chemistry, micro-photography and the manufacture of homeopathic tinctures was set up, along with an astronomical observatory, a machine shop, workshops for woodworking, blacksmithing, printing, weaving, rugmaking and glassmaking and a theater." &lt;ref&gt;Deborah Lawlor, "R. A. Schwaller de Lubicz and ''Nature Word''", in R. A. Schwaller de Lubicz, ''Nature Word'', page 52 (The Lindisfarne Press, 1982). {{ISBN|0-940262-00-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there, Schwaller de Lubicz brought to a total whole his philosophical vision and in 1926 published his book ''L'Appel du Feu'', where his "inspiration and higher intelligence is personified as 'Aor' (Hebrew for 'intellectual light')." Suhalia became the location where he began to "elaborate his philosophy of the evolution of consciousness." &lt;ref&gt;Deborah Lawlor, page 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Egypt==
Schwaller de Lubicz lived in Egypt for twelve years&lt;ref&gt;Aaron Cheak, (2011), University of Queensland, Light Broken Through the Prism of Life: René Schwaller de Lubicz and the Hermetic Problem of Salt, p477.&lt;/ref&gt; studying the [[Egyptian temple|temples]] of [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] in detail. He, with the French Egypologist [[Alexandre Varille]], developed the symbolist approach to ancient Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt, Oxford, (2001), vol. 1, p456.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that Egyptian temples were used for mystical [[initiation]]s, and that their design incorporated symbolism expressing a belief system that combined religion, philosophy, art, and science.&lt;ref name="Montserrat"&gt;Dominic Montserrat, ''Akhenaten: History, Fantasy and Ancient Egypt'', pp. 129, 196  (Routledge, 2000). {{ISBN|0-415-18549-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believed, for instance, that the Egyptians were aware of astronomical concepts like [[axial precession]], which was reflected in their [[ancient Egyptian religion|religious beliefs]]. He linked the [[astrological age]] of [[Gemini (astrology)|Gemini]] with the development of the [[Dualistic cosmology|dualistic]] themes in Egyptian religion, the age of [[Taurus (astrology)|Taurus]] with the bull god [[Apis (god)|Apis]], and the age of [[Aries (astrology)|Aries]] with the god [[Amun]], who was depicted as a ram. He also argued that the human form was the basis for [[ancient Egyptian architecture]], and he equated parts of the temples with parts of the human body. His three-volume work ''The Temple in Man'' includes a drawing that compares the plan of [[Luxor Temple]] to the shape of a human skeleton.&lt;ref name="Hornung"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Secret Lore of Egypt: Its Impact on the West|year=2002|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=0801438470|author=Erik Hornung|pages=175–176}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Vc-gwWcWUmgC&amp;pg=PA34#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false See picture here].&lt;/ref&gt; Lynn Picknett and Clive Prince argue that these ideas were influenced by Schwaller de Lubicz's existing beliefs, such as Synarchy and Theosophy. Like many other esotericist figures, he believed that Egyptian civilization dated back much farther than conventional [[Egyptian chronology]] allows.&lt;ref name="Picknett &amp; Price"&gt;{{cite book|title=Consuming Ancient Egypt|editor=Sally MacDonald &amp; Michael Rice|chapter=Alternative Egypts|author=Lynn Picknett &amp; Clive Prince|year=2003|publisher=UCL Press|isbn=978-1-84472-003-3|pages=175–176, 179–182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mainstream [[Egyptology|Egyptologists]] have largely ignored his claims or viewed them with hostility, although [[Erik Hornung]] points out that his survey of Luxor Temple contains information useful to anyone studying the temple today.&lt;ref name="Hornung"/&gt; 
He is an influential figure among the advocates of theories about ancient Egypt that challenge the conclusions of mainstream Egyptology—theories that are sometimes labeled "alternative Egyptology".&lt;ref name="Picknett &amp; Price"/&gt; Many adherents of [[George Gurdjieff]]'s [[Fourth Way]] find parallels in Schwaller de Lubicz's writings,&lt;ref&gt;''The Quest'', volume 6 (Theosophical Society In America, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt; and he has been an inspiration to authors like [[John Anthony West]], whose claims about the great age of the [[Great Sphinx of Giza]] are inspired by those of Schwaller de Lubicz,&lt;ref name="Picknett &amp; Price"/&gt; and Naomi Ozaniec.&lt;ref name="Montserrat"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5707">The '''Ray Allen Billington Prize''' is given biennially by the [[Organization of American Historians]] (OAH) for the best book about [[American frontier]] history. The "American frontier" includes all of North and South America, all post-1492 pioneer experiences, and comparisons between American frontiers and others around the world.  First given in 1981, this prize honors [[Ray Allen Billington]], OAH President (1962-1963) and prolific writer about American frontiers. A three-member committee, chosen by the OAH President for a two-year term, selects the winner who receives $1000.  The first award was made posthumously to John D. Unruh who died in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bluffton.edu/library/coll/ms/unruh |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110804224353/http://www.bluffton.edu/library/coll/ms/unruh/ |archivedate=2011-08-04 |df= }} (last retrieved 02/16/2011)&lt;/ref&gt;  No award was made in 1997, and two awards were made in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Ray Allen Billington Prize | work = The Organization of American Historians: Programs &amp; Resources: OAH Awards and Prizes | publisher = The Organization of American Historians | url = http://www.oah.org/programs/awards/ray-allen-billington-prize/ | accessdate = 2013-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2846">'''Severin Binius''' (1573, [[Randerath]], present-day Western [[Germany]] &amp;ndash; 14 February 1641) was a German [[Roman Catholic]] priest, historian and critic.

==Life==
He studied at the gymnasium of St. Lawrence, in [[Cologne]], and later taught in the same school for several years. After his ordination to the priesthood he obtained the degree of doctor of divinity from the [[University of Cologne]], where he taught general ecclesiastical history and ecclesiastical discipline, eventually becoming (1627–30) Rector Magnificus of the university. Binius was successively canon in two chapter-churches of Cologne and finally in the cathedral. In 1631 he was made counselor and vicar-general of the archdiocese, a promotion due to his learning and one which was justified by his ability in managing the affairs of the archdiocese. Besides his many ordinary occupations he was active in the ecclesiastical ministry and was known for his charity towards the poor, especially to needy students.

==Works==
Binius is best known for his edition of the ''Councils of the Church''. The previous collections by [[Jacques Merlin]], [[Peter Crabbe]] and [[Lorenzo Surius]] appeared incomplete to him, lacking as they did explanatory notes. With the help of other scholars he prepared a new edition of the councils in four folio volumes (Cologne, 1606) under the title ''Concilia generalia et provincialia''. It gives only the Latin text, and contains the acts of the councils, the decretal letters, and the lives of the popes. Binius added copious explanatory notes drawn largely from the ''[[Ecclesiastical Annals]]'' of [[Caesar Baronius]]. A second edition, considerably enlarged and containing also the Greek text, appeared at Cologne in 1618. In 1639 a third edition in nine volumes appeared at Paris, in preparation for which extensive use was made of the collection of councils published at Rome from 1608 to 1612. Binius also prepared an edition of the ecclesiastical histories of [[Eusebius of Caesarea]], [[Socrates of Constantinople]], [[Theodoret]], [[Sozomen]] and [[Evagrius Scholasticus]].

The '''list of stolpersteine in Prague-Břevnov, Bubeneč and Dejvice''' contains the [[Stolpersteine|stumbling blocks]] that were placed in the Prague district of [[Břevnov]] and [[Bubeneč]] as well as in the cadastral district of [[Dejvice]]. Břevnov has partially belonged to Prague since 2002, Dejvice is entirely part of Prague 6. Bubeneč was divided between [[Prague 6]] and [[Prague 7]]. The stumbling blocks remind and make aware of the fate of the people who were murdered, deported, expelled or driven into suicide by the [[national socialists]]. The Stolpersteine were designed and placed by [[Gunter Demnig]].

The Czech stumbling block project [[Stolpersteine.cz]] was launched in 2008 by [[Česká unie židovské mládeže]] (Czech Union of Jewish Youth) under the patronage of the Prague mayor. The Stolpersteine lie in front of the victim‘s last freely-chosen place of residence. In Czech, the stumbling blocks are called Kameny zmizelých; stones of the disappeared.

&lt;small&gt;The tables are partially sortable; The sorting is carried out alphabetically according to the family name.&lt;/small&gt;

| Ing. '''{{SortKeyName|Emil|Aschner|nl=1}}''' was born on 29 November 1884 in [[Vienna]]. His parents were Samuel Aschner (c. 1849-1917) and Paula b. Blaustern (1853-1924). His father was the owner of a shirt and underwear factory in Vienna. He completed an engineering degree and married Alice b. Fenichel, also called Lilly (born March 11, 1894 in Vienna). The couple had two children, Peter (1918-1984) and Eva (1923-2014), both born in Vienna. His wife died in the 1920s. The children were brought up in Prague by Adele Kajak, the housekeeper. Emil Aschner and his children were able to flee from Vienna to England in 1938. Emil Aschner returned to Vienna to help his brother after his arrest. It is unclear what happened after 1941. The last place of residence of Emil Aschner before deportation was in Prague XIII, Ruská 22/563. On October 26, 1941, Emil Aschner, his brother Richard and his wife were transported from Prague to the [[Łódź Ghetto]], with transport C. Their transport numbers were 421, 495 and 496. There, all three family members were murdered by the Nazi regime.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Central Database of Shoah Victims' Names]]: ''[https://yvng.yadvashem.org/nameDetails.html?language=en&amp;itemId=4823302&amp;ind=0 EMIL ASCHNER]'',&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;holocaust.cz: ''[http://www.holocaust.cz/en/database-of-victims/victim/143115-emil-aschner/ EMIL ASCHNER]'', retrieved on 26 May 2017 (with a portrait)&lt;/ref&gt;

Both children remained in England and survived. His son Peter Aschner, who had attended the textile school in Vienna, worked as a weaver in exile. He was married twice and had a total of four children from both marriages. In England he met the journalist Ilse Maria b. Römer from Vienna, who became his second wife. Both of them returned to Vienna in 1945-46 and worked as a journalist there. Among other things Peter Aschner published for the [[Wiener Tagebuch]] and the [[International Presseschau]], he also worked as a translator. He passed away in Vienna in 1984.  Emil Aschner's daughter Eva became an interpreter, returned to Prague, married Walter Vergeiner and had a child with him. She died in Prague in 2014.

Two of his four brothers were able to survive in exile: Bernhard Aschner (1883-1960) became a respected doctor, was married to Johanna b. King and had a child with her. He is considered a pioneer of endocrinology and died in New York City. Felix Aschner (1888-1959) emigrated to South America, was married twice and had three children. He died in Bogotá.

'''Theophanes of Byzantium''' ({{lang-el|Θεόφανης ὁ Βυζάντιος}}; [[floruit|fl.]] 6th century) was a [[Byzantine]] historian.

He wrote, in ten books, the history of the Eastern Empire during the [[Roman–Persian War of 572–591|Persian war]] under [[Justin II]], beginning from the second year of Justin (567), in which the truce made by [[Justinian I]] with [[Khosrau I]] was broken, and going down to last year of the war. The work has not survived, but [[Photios I of Constantinople|Patriarch Photius]]&lt;ref&gt;Photius, ''Bibl. Cod.'' 64&lt;/ref&gt; gives an account of the work of Theophanes, and he repeats the author's statement that, besides adding other books to the ten which formed the original work, he had written another work on the history of Justinian. Among the historical statements preserved by Photius from Theophanes is the discovery, in the reign of Justinian, of the fact that [[silk]] was the product of a [[silk worm|worm]], which had not been before known to the people of the Roman Empire. A certain [[Persian people|Persian]], he tells us, coming from the land of the [[Seres]], brought to Constantinople "the seed" (i.e. the eggs) of the silk-worm, and these "seeds" being hatched in the spring, and the worms fed with mulberry leaves, they spun their silk, and went through their transformations.

'''Ugolino Brunforte''' (c. 1262 &amp;ndash; c. 1348) was an Italian [[Order of Friars Minor|Friar Minor]] and chronicler, known principally as the author of the ''Fioretti'' or ''Little Flowers of St. Francis''.

==Life==
Few details of Ugolino's life are known. His father Rinaldo, Lord of [[Sarnano]] in the [[Marche]]s, belonged to an ancient and noble family from which had sprung the famous Countess [[Matilda of Tuscany]]. Ugolino entered the [[Order of Friars Minor]] at the age of sixteen. He served his novitiate at the convent of [[Roccabruna]], but passed most of his life at the convent of Santa Maria in Monte Giorgio, whence he is often called ''Ugolino of Monte Giorgio''. In 1295 he was chosen Bishop of [[Abruzzi]] (Teramo) under [[Pope Celestine V]], but before his consecration Celestine had resigned and [[Pope Boniface VIII|Boniface VIII]], who suspected Ugolino as belonging to the ''[[zelanti]]'', annulled the appointment with the bull ''In supremae dignitatis specula''. Nearly fifty years later he was elected provincial of [[Macerata]].&lt;ref name=Robinson&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03011a.htm Robinson, Paschal. "Ugolino Brunforte." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 3. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 15 Jun. 2016&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his death in 1348, was provincial of the Friars Minor in the March.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06078b.htm Robinson, Paschal. "Fioretti di San Francesco d'Assisi." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 6. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 15 June 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Fioretti''==
Most scholars are now agreed that Ugolino was the author of the ''[[Fioretti]]'', or ''Little Flowers of St. Francis'', in their original form. Ugolino was probably one of several collectors of traditions in the Marches. The ''Fioretti'' appears to have been written sometime between 1322 and 1328.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=u-A8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA522&amp;lpg=PA522&amp;dq=Ugolino+Brunforte&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=M9LNHWTRQv&amp;sig=3cgkAELn5-wnUFtGYr7l4N3YfrE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiH9MudlqnNAhUKFx4KHXetBIIQ6AEIPTAH#v=onepage&amp;q=Ugolino%20Brunforte&amp;f=false Cuthbert O. S. F. C., ''Life of St. Francis of Assisi'', Longmans, Green, 1914]&lt;/ref&gt;

In some ways the ''Fioretti'' says as much about its author as its subject. "Ugolino, it is true, draws himself when he draws his master. It is a singularly, fresh, simple, child-like character with its unfailing belief in the love of God, and the essential goodness of all he has created."&lt;ref name=Hutton&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=81pCAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA66&amp;lpg=PA66&amp;dq=Ugolino+Brunforte&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jfgYhgXU87&amp;sig=DdKrZQjOKsQCqtN19i4SnurgIzk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiH9MudlqnNAhUKFx4KHXetBIIQ6AEIOjAG#v=onepage&amp;q=Ugolino%20Brunforte&amp;f=false Hutton, William Holden. ''The Influence of Christianity Upon National Character Illustrated by the Lives and Legends of the English Saints'', W. Gardner, Darton &amp; Company, 1903]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Filled with the romance of his native country, the simple friar, so pure in his insight, and so vivid in his realization, painted an immortal picture of the Saintly life as it was lived in the Middle Ages, on the background of the enchanted country between the Apennines and the Adriatic, the land of Monte Giorgio, the heart of Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Sabatier, Paul. ''Fioretum S. Francisci'' (Paris, 1902), preface&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although the Latin original has not come down to us, we have in the ''Actus B. Francisci et Sociorum Ejus'', edited by [[Paul Sabatier (theologian)|Paul Sabatier]] in ''Collection d’Études'' (Paris, 1902, IV), an approximation to it which may be considered on the whole as representing the original of the ''Fioretti''. That Ugolino was the principal compiler of the ''Actus'' seems certain; how far he may be considered the sole author of the ''Fioretti'' is not so clear. His labour, which consisted chiefly in gathering the flowers for his bouquet from written and oral local tradition, appears to have been completed before 1328.

'''Veliky Novgorod''' ({{lang-rus|Вели́кий Но́вгород|p=vʲɪˈlʲikʲɪj ˈnovɡərət}}), also known as '''Novgorod the Great''', or '''Novgorod Veliky''', or just '''Novgorod''', is one of the most important historic [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|cities]] in [[Russia]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Archaeology of Novgorod,'' by [[Valentin L. Yanin]], in ''Ancient Cities, Special Issue,'' (Scientific American), pp.&amp;nbsp;120–127, c.&amp;nbsp;1994. Covers, History, Kremlin of Novgorod, Novgorod Museum of History, preservation dynamics of the soils, and the production of [[Birch bark document]]s.&lt;/ref&gt; which serves as the [[administrative center]] of [[Novgorod Oblast]]. It is situated on the [[M10 highway (Russia)|M10 federal highway]] connecting [[Moscow]] and [[Saint Petersburg|St.&amp;nbsp;Petersburg]]. The city lies along the [[Volkhov River]] just downstream from its outflow from [[Lake Ilmen]]. [[UNESCO]] recognized Novgorod as a [[World Heritage site]] in 1992. Population: {{ru-census|p2010=218,717|p2002=216,856|p1989=229,126}}

At its peak during the 14th century, the city was the capital of the [[Novgorod Republic]] and one of Europe's largest cities.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Formation of Muscovy 1300 - 1613|author=Crummey, R.O.|date=2014|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9781317872009|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MMwFBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA23|page=23|accessdate=September 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Early developments===
The [[Sofia First Chronicle]] makes initial mention of it in 859, while the [[Novgorod First Chronicle]] first mentions it in 862, when it was purportedly already a major [[Baltics]] to [[Byzantium]] station on the [[trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks]].&lt;ref name="Tikhomirov"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://historic.ru/books/item/f00/s00/z0000082/st003.shtml |script-title=ru:Древнерусские города |last=Тихомиров |first=М.Н. |year=1956 |publisher=Государственное издательство Политической литературы |language=Russian |accessdate=June 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Charter of Veliky Novgorod recognizes&amp;nbsp;859 as the year when the city was first mentioned.&lt;ref name="Established"&gt;Charter of Veliky Novgorod, Article&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/ref&gt; Novgorod is traditionally considered to be the cradle of Russian statehood.

Archaeological excavations in the middle to late 20th century, however, have found cultural layers dating back only to the late 10th century, the time of the [[Christianization of Rus']] and a century after it was allegedly founded, suggesting that the chronicle entries mentioning Novgorod in the 850s or 860s are later interpolations.&lt;ref&gt;Valentin Lavrentyevich Ianin and Mark Khaimovich Aleshkovsky. "Proskhozhdeniye Novgoroda: (k postanovke problemy)," ''Istoriya SSSR'' 2 (1971): 32-61.&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological dating is fairly easy and accurate to within 15–25 years, as the streets were paved with wood, and most of the houses made of wood, allowing [[dendrochronology|tree ring dating]].

The [[Varangian]] name of the city {{lang|da|Holmgård}} or {{lang|da|Holmgard}} ({{lang|non|Holmgarðr}} or {{lang|non|Holmgarðir}}) is mentioned in [[Norse Saga]]s as existing at a yet earlier stage, but the correlation of this reference with the actual city is uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;The name {{lang|da|Holmgard}} is a Norse [[toponymy|toponym]] meaning ''[[Islet]] town'' or ''Islet [[grad (Slavic settlement)|grad]]'', and there are various explanations for why they gave this name. According to Rydzevskaya, the Norse name is derived from the Slavic {{lang|sla|Holmgrad}} which means "town on a hill" and may allude to the "old town" preceding the "new town", or Novgorod.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, {{lang|da|Holmgård}} referred to the stronghold, now only {{convert|2|km|abbr=in}} to the south of the center of the present-day city, [[Rurikovo Gorodische]] (named in comparatively modern times after the Varangian chieftain [[Rurik]], who supposedly made it his "capital" around 860). Archaeological data suggests that the Gorodishche, the residence of the [[Knyaz]] (prince), dates from the mid-9th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vnovgorod.info/gorod.html |script-title=ru:Городище |publisher=Великий Новгород |language=Russian |accessdate=March 27, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas the town itself dates only from the end of the 10th century; hence the name Novgorod, "new city", from [[Old Church Slavonic]] {{lang|cu|Новъ}} and {{lang|cu|Городъ}} ({{lang|cu-Latn|Nov}} and {{lang|cu-Latn|Gorod}}), although German and Scandinavian historiography suggests the Old Norse term {{lang|non|Nýgarðr}}, or the [[Old High German]] term {{lang|goh|Naugard}}. First mention of this Nordic or Germanic etymology to the name of the city of Novgorod (and that of other cities within the territory of the then [[Kievan Rus']]) occurs in the 10th-century policy manual {{lang|la|[[De Administrando Imperio]]|italic=yes}} by [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] emperor [[Constantine VII]].

Slightly predating the chronology of the legend of Rurik (which dates the first Norse arrival in the region around 858–860), an earlier record for the Scandinavian settlement of the region is found in the {{lang|la|[[Annales Bertiniani]]|italic=yes}} (written up until 882) where a Rus' delegation is mentioned as having visited [[Constantinople]] in 838 and, intending to return to the [[Rus' Khaganate]] via the [[Baltic Sea]], were questioned by [[list of Frankish kings|Frankish Emperor]] [[Louis the Pious]] at {{lang|de|[[Ingelheim am Rhein]]|italic=no}}, where they said that although their origin was Swedish, they had settled in Northern Rus' under a leader who they designated as {{lang|la|chacanus}} (the Latin form of ''[[Khagan]]'', a title they had likely borrowed from contact with the [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]]).&lt;ref&gt;I. Kh. Garipzanov, [http://www.history.org.ua/JournALL/ruthenica/5/1.pdf The Annals of St. Bertin (839) and Chacanus of the Rhos]. ''Ruthenica'' 5 (2006) 3–8 sides with the old theory.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gwyn Jones, ''A History of the Vikings'', 2nd ed., London, Oxford University Press, 1984, pp. 249–250.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Princely state within Kievan Rus'===
In 882, Rurik's successor, [[Oleg of Novgorod]], conquered [[Kiev]] and founded the state of [[Kievan Rus']]. Novgorod's size as well as its political, economic, and cultural influence made it the second most important city in Kievan Rus'. According to a custom, the elder son and heir of the ruling Kievan monarch was sent to rule Novgorod even as a minor. When the ruling monarch had no such son, Novgorod was governed by [[posadnik]]s, such as the legendary [[Gostomysl]], [[Dobrynya]], [[Konstantin Dobrynich|Konstantin]], and [[Ostromir]].

Of all their princes, Novgorodians most cherished the memory of [[Yaroslav I the Wise|Yaroslav the Wise]], who sat as Prince of Novgorod from 1010 to 1019, while his father, [[Vladimir the Great]], was a prince in Kiev. Yaroslav promulgated the first written code of laws (later incorporated into [[Russkaya Pravda]]) among the Eastern Slavs and is said to have granted the city a number of freedoms or privileges, which they often referred to in later centuries as precedents in their relations with other princes. His son, [[Vladimir of Novgorod|Vladimir]], sponsored construction of the great [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod|St.&amp;nbsp;Sophia Cathedral]], more accurately translated as the Cathedral of Holy Wisdom, which stands to this day.

===Early foreign ties===
In [[Norse saga]]s the city is mentioned as the capital{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} of [[Gardariki]]. Four [[Viking]] kings—[[Olaf I of Norway]], [[Olaf II of Norway]], [[Magnus I of Norway]], and [[Harald III of Norway|Harald Hardrada]]—sought refuge in Novgorod{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} from enemies at home. No more than a few decades after the 1030 death and subsequent [[canonization]] of Olaf&amp;nbsp;II of Norway, the city's community had erected in his memory [[Saint Olaf's Church in Novgorod]].

The [[Gotland]] town of [[Visby]] functioned as the leading trading center in the Baltic before the [[Hansa League]]. At Novgorod in 1080, Visby merchants established a trading post which they named Gutagard (also known as Gotenhof).&lt;ref name="european-heritage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.european-heritage.org/germany/m%C3%BCnster/hanseatic/cronicle-hanse |title=The Cronicle of the Hanseatic League |publisher=european-heritage.org|accessdate=September 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in the first half of the 13th century, merchants from northern Germany also established their own trading station in Novgorod, known as Peterhof.&lt;ref&gt;Justyna Wubs-Mrozewicz, ''Traders, ties and tensions: the interactions of Lübeckers, Overijsslers and Hollanders in Late Medieval Bergen'', Uitgeverij Verloren, 2008 p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; At about the same time, in 1229, German merchants at Novgorod were granted certain privileges, which made their position more secure.&lt;ref&gt;Translation of the grant of privileges to merchants in 1229: {{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/1229novgorod-germans.html|title=Medieval Sourcebook: Privileges Granted to German Merchants at Novgorod, 1229|publisher=Fordham.edu|date=|accessdate=July 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Novgorod Republic===
{{Main|Novgorod Republic}}

In 1136, the Novgorodians dismissed their prince [[Vsevolod Mstislavich of Novgorod and Pskov|Vsevolod Mstislavich]]. The year is seen as the traditional beginning of the [[Novgorod Republic]]. The city was able to invite and dismiss a number of princes over the next two centuries, but the princely office was never abolished and powerful princes, such as [[Alexander Nevsky]], could assert their will in the city regardless of what Novgorodians said.&lt;ref&gt;Michael C. Paul, "The Iaroslavichi and the Novgorodian Veche 1230–1270: A Case Study on Princely Relations with the Veche", ''Russian History/ Histoire Russe'' 31, No. 1-2 (Spring-Summer 2004): 39-59.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[city state]] controlled most of Europe's northeast, from lands east of today's [[Estonia]] to the [[Ural Mountains]], making it one of the largest states in medieval Europe, although much of the territory north and east of Lakes [[Lake Ladoga|Ladoga]] and [[Lake Onega|Onega]] was sparsely populated and never organized politically.

[[File:Saint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod.jpg|thumb|[[Cathedral of St. Sophia, Novgorod|Cathedral of St. Sophia]], a symbol of the city and the main cathedral of the Novgorod Republic]]

One of the most important local figures in Novgorod was the ''[[posadnik]]'', or mayor, an official elected by the public assembly (called the [[Novgorod veche|Veche]]) from among the city's [[boyars]], or aristocracy. The [[tysyatsky]], or "thousandman", originally the head of the town militia but later a commercial and judicial official, was also elected by the Veche. Another important local official was the [[Archbishop of Novgorod]] who shared power with the boyars.&lt;ref&gt;Michael C. Paul, "Secular Power and the Archbishops of Novgorod Before the Muscovite Conquest". ''Kritika: Explorations in Russian and Eurasian History'' 8, no. 2 (Spring 2007): 231-270.&lt;/ref&gt; Archbishops were elected by the Veche or by the drawing of lots, and after their election, were sent to the [[Metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] for consecration.&lt;ref&gt;Michael C. Paul, "Episcopal Election in Novgorod, Russia 1156–1478". ''Church History: Studies in Christianity and Culture'' 72, No. 2 (June 2003): 251-275.&lt;/ref&gt;

While a basic outline of the various officials and the Veche can be drawn up, the city-state's exact political constitution remains unknown. The boyars and the archbishop ruled the city together, although where one official's power ended and another's began is uncertain. The prince, although his power was reduced from around the middle of the 12th century, was represented by his ''[[namestnik]]'', or lieutenant, and still played important roles as a military commander, legislator and jurist. The exact composition of the Veche, too, is uncertain, with some historians, such as [[Vasily Klyuchevsky]], claiming it was democratic in nature, while later scholars, such as [[Marxist historiography|Marxists]] Valentin Ianin and Aleksandr Khoroshev, see it as a "sham democracy" controlled by the ruling elite.

In the 13th century, Novgorod, while not a member of the [[Hanseatic League]], was the easternmost [[kontor]], or [[entrepôt]], of the league, being the source of enormous quantities of luxury ([[sable]], [[ermine]], [[fox]], [[marmot]]) and non-luxury furs (squirrel pelts).&lt;ref&gt;Janet Martin, ''Treasure of the Land of Darkness: the Fur Trade and its Significance for Medieval Russia''. (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985).&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the Middle Ages, the city thrived culturally. A large number of [[birch bark document|birch bark letters]] have been unearthed in excavations, perhaps suggesting widespread literacy, although this is uncertain (some scholars{{who|date=March 2012}} suggest that a clerical or scribal elite wrote them on behalf of a largely illiterate populace{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}). It was in Novgorod that the [[Novgorod Codex]], the oldest Slavic book written north of Bulgaria, and the oldest inscription in a Finnic language ([[Birch bark letter no. 292]]) were unearthed. Some of the most ancient Russian chronicles ([[Novgorod First Chronicle]]) were written in the scriptorium of the archbishops who also promoted iconography and patronized church construction. The Novgorod merchant [[Sadko]] became a popular hero of Russian [[folklore]].

Novgorod was never conquered by the Mongols during the [[Mongol invasion of Rus]]. The Mongol army turned back about {{convert|200|km|sp=us}} from the city, not because of the city's strength, but probably because the Mongol commanders did not want to get bogged down in the marshlands surrounding the city. However, the grand princes of Moscow, who acted as tax collectors for the khans of the Golden Horde, did collect tribute in Novgorod, most notably [[Yury of Moscow|Yury Danilovich]] and his brother, [[Ivan Kalita]].

In 1259, [[Golden Horde|Hordes]] tax-collectors and census-takers arrived in the city, leading to political disturbances and forcing [[Alexander Nevsky]] to punish a number of town officials (he cut off their noses) for defying him as [[Vladimir-Suzdal|Grand Prince of Vladimir]] (soon to be the khan's tax-collector in Russia) and his Mongol overlords. In the 14th century, raids by Novgorod [[pirate]]s, or [[ushkuiniki]],&lt;ref&gt;Janet Martin, “Les Uškujniki de Novgorod: Marchands ou Pirates.” ''Cahiers du Monde Russe et Sovietique'' 16 (1975): 5-18.&lt;/ref&gt; sowed fear as far as [[Kazan]] and [[Astrakhan]], assisting Novgorod in wars with the Grand Duchy of Moscow.

During the era of [[Kievan Rus'|Old Rus' State]], Novgorod was a trade hub at the northern end of both the [[Volga trade route]] and the "[[Trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks|route from the Varangians to the Greeks]]" along the [[Dnieper river]] system. A vast array of goods were transported along these routes and exchanged with local Novgorod merchants and other traders. The farmers of [[Gotland]] retained the Saint Olof trading house well into the 12th century. Later German merchantmen also established tradinghouses in Novgorod. Scandinavian royalty would intermarry with Russian princes and princesses.

After the [[East–West Schism|great schism]], Novgorod struggled from the beginning of the 13th century against [[Sweden|Swedish]], [[Denmark|Danish]], and German crusaders. During the [[Swedish-Novgorodian Wars]], the Swedes invaded lands where some of the population had earlier [[Novgorodian raids into Finland|paid tribute]] to Novgorod. The Germans had been trying to conquer the [[Baltic region]] since the late 12th century. Novgorod went to war 26 times with Sweden and 11 times with the [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword]]. The German [[knight]]s, along with Danish and Swedish feudal lords, launched a series of uncoordinated attacks in 1240–1242. Novgorodian sources mention that a Swedish army was defeated in the [[Battle of the Neva]] in 1240. The Baltic German campaigns ended in failure after the [[Battle on Lake Peipus|Battle on the Ice]] in 1242. After the foundation of the castle of [[Vyborg|Viborg]] in 1293 the Swedes gained a foothold in [[Karelia]]. On August 12, 1323, Sweden and Novgorod signed the [[Treaty of Nöteborg]], regulating their border for the first time.

===Expansion of Muscovy===
The city's downfall occurred partially as a result of its inability to feed its large population,{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} making it dependent on the [[Vladimir-Suzdal]] region for grain. The main cities in the area, [[Moscow]] and [[Tver]], used this dependence to gain control over Novgorod. Eventually [[Ivan III of Russia|Ivan&amp;nbsp;III]] forcibly annexed the city to the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] in 1478. The Veche was dissolved and a significant part of Novgorod's population was either killed or deported. The Hanseatic League kontor was closed in 1494 and the goods stored there were seized by Muscovite forces.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

At the time of annexation, Novgorod became the third largest city under Muscovy (with 5,300 homesteads and 25–30&amp;nbsp;thousand inhabitants in the 1550s;&lt;ref&gt;Boris Zemtsov, [http://www.ecsocman.edu.ru/images/pubs/2005/02/02/0000203630/006_zemtsov_2.pdf Откуда есть пошла... российская цивилизация], Общественные науки и современность. 1994. № 4. С. 51-62. p. 9 {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and remained so until the famine of the 1560s and the [[Massacre of Novgorod]] in 1570. In the Massacre, [[Ivan the Terrible]] sacked the city, slaughtered thousands of its inhabitants, and deported the city's merchant elite and nobility to Moscow, [[Yaroslavl]] and elsewhere. The last decade of the 16th century was a comparatively favorable period for the city as [[Boris Godunov]] restored trade privileges and raised the status of Novgorod bishop. The German trading post was reestablished in 1603.&lt;ref name=view&gt;{{cite book |title= Великий Новгород.

[[File:Novgorod 1701-1745.png|left|thumb|City plan of Novgorod in the first half of the 18th century]]

During the [[Time of Troubles]], Novgorodians submitted to [[Sweden|Swedish]] troops led by [[Jacob De la Gardie]] in the summer of 1611. The city was restituted to Muscovy, a brief six years later, by the [[Treaty of Stolbovo]] and only regained a measure of its former prosperity towards the end of the century, when such ambitious buildings as the Cathedral of the Sign and the Vyazhischi Monastery were constructed. The most famous of Muscovite patriarchs, [[Patriarch Nikon|Nikon]], was active in Novgorod between 1648 and 1652. The Novgorod Land became one of the Old Believers' strongholds after the [[Great Russian Schism|Schism]].&lt;ref name=view/&gt;

In 1727, Novgorod was made the administrative center of [[Novgorod Governorate]] of the [[Russian Empire]], which was detached from [[Saint Petersburg Governorate]] (see [[Administrative divisions of Russia in 1727–1728]]). This administrative division existed until 1927. Between 1927 and 1944, the city was a part of [[Leningrad Oblast]], and then became the administrative center of the newly formed [[Novgorod Oblast]].

===Modern era===
On August&amp;nbsp;15, 1941, during [[World War II]], the city was occupied by the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]]. Its historic monuments were systematically obliterated. The [[Red Army]] liberated the city on January&amp;nbsp;19, 1944. Out of 2,536 stone buildings, fewer than forty remained standing. After the war, thanks to plans laid down by [[Alexey Shchusev]], the central part was gradually restored. In 1992, the chief monuments of the city and the surrounding area were inscribed on the UNESCO [[World Heritage Sites|World Heritage Site]] list as the [[Historic Monuments of Novgorod and Surroundings]]. In 1999, the city was officially renamed Veliky Novgorod (literally, Great Novgorod), thus partly reverting to its medieval title "Lord Novgorod the Great". This reduced the temptation to confuse Veliky Novgorod with [[Nizhny Novgorod]], a larger city the other side of Moscow which, between 1932 and 1990, had been renamed Gorky, in honor of [[Maxim Gorky]].

==Administrative and municipal status==
Veliky Novgorod is the [[administrative center]] of the [[oblast]] and, within the [[subdivisions of Russia#Administrative divisions|framework of administrative divisions]], it also serves as the administrative center of [[Novgorodsky District]], even though it is not a part of it.&lt;ref name="Ref534"&gt;Law #559-OZ&lt;/ref&gt; As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as the '''[[city of federal subject significance|city of oblast significance]] of Veliky Novgorod'''—an administrative unit with status equal to that of the [[administrative divisions of Novgorod Oblast|districts]].&lt;ref name="Ref534"/&gt; As a [[subdivisions of Russia#Municipal divisions|municipal division]], the city of oblast significance of Veliky Novgorod is incorporated as '''Veliky Novgorod Urban Okrug'''.&lt;ref name="Ref832"&gt;Oblast Law #284-OZ&lt;/ref&gt;

The city is known for the variety and age of its medieval monuments. The foremost among these is the [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod|St.&amp;nbsp;Sophia Cathedral]], built between 1045 and 1050 under the patronage of Vladimir Yaroslavich, the son of [[Yaroslav the Wise]] (Vladimir is buried in the cathedral along with his mother, [[Anna Porphyrogenita|Anna]]).&lt;ref&gt;Tatiana Tsarevskaia, ''St. Sophia's Cathedral in Novgorod'' (Moscow: Severnyi Palomnik, 2005), 3.&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the best preserved churches from the 11th century. It's also probably the oldest structure still in use in Russia and the first one to represent original features of Russian architecture (austere stone walls, five helmet-like domes). Its frescoes were painted in the 12th century originally on the orders of Bishop Nikita (died 1108) (the "porches" or side chapels were painted in 1144 under [[Nifont of Novgorod|Archbishop Nifont]]) and renovated several times over the centuries, most recently in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Tsarevskaia, 14, 19-22, 24, 29, 35.&lt;/ref&gt; The cathedral features famous bronze gates, which now hang in the west entrance, allegedly made in [[Magdeburg]] in 1156 (other sources see them originating from [[Płock]] in [[Poland]]) and reportedly snatched by Novgorodians from the Swedish town of [[Sigtuna]] in 1187. More recent scholarship has determined that the gates were most likely purchased in the mid-15th century, apparently at the behest of Archbishop [[Euthymius II of Novgorod|Euthymius II]] (1429–1458), a lover of Western art and architectural styles.&lt;ref&gt;Jadwiga Irena Daniec, ''The Message of Faith and Symbol in European Medieval Bronze Church Doors'' (Danbury, CT: Rutledge Books, 1999), Chapter III "An Enigma: The Medieval Bronze Church Door of Płock in the Cathedral of Novgorod," 67-97; Mikhail Tsapenko, ed., ''Early Russian Architecture'' (Moscow: Progress Publisher, 1969), 34-38
&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Novgorod Kremlin]], traditionally known as the ''Detinets'', also contains the oldest palace in Russia (the so-called Chamber of the Facets, 1433), which served as the main meeting hall of the archbishops; the oldest Russian bell tower (mid-15th century), and the oldest Russian clock tower (1673). The Palace of Facets, the bell tower, and the clock tower were originally built on the orders of Archbishop Euphimius II, although the clock tower collapsed in the 17th century and had to be rebuilt and much of the palace of Euphimius II is no longer standing. Among later structures, the most remarkable are a royal palace (1771) and a bronze monument to the [[Millennium of Russia]], representing the most important figures from the country's history (unveiled in 1862).
[[File:St. Nicholas Cathedral, Novgorod.JPG|thumb|left|[[Saint Nicholas Cathedral, Novgorod|St.&amp;nbsp;Nicholas Cathedral]], built by Mstislav&amp;nbsp;I near his palace at [[Yaroslav's Court]], Novgorod, contains 12th-century [[fresco]]es depicting his illustrious family]]

Outside the Kremlin walls, there are three large churches constructed during the reign of [[Mstislav I of Kiev|Mstislav the Great]]. [[Saint Nicholas Cathedral, Novgorod|St.&amp;nbsp;Nicholas Cathedral]] (1113–1123), containing frescoes of Mstislav's family, graces [[Yaroslav's Court]] (formerly the chief square of Novgorod). The [[Yuriev Monastery]] (one of the oldest in Russia, 1030) contains a tall, three-domed cathedral from 1119 (built by Mstislav's son, [[Vsevolod of Pskov|Vsevolod]], and Kyurik, the head of the monastery). A similar three-domed cathedral (1117), probably designed by the same masters, stands in the [[Antoniev Monastery]], built on the orders of [[Anthony of Rome|Antony]], the founder of that monastery.

There are now some fifty medieval and early modern churches scattered throughout the city and its surrounding areas. Some of them were blown up by the Nazis and subsequently restored. The most ancient pattern is represented by those dedicated to [[Feast of Saints Peter and Paul|Saints Pyotr and Pavel]] (on the Swallow's Hill, 1185–1192), to Annunciation (in Myachino, 1179), to Assumption (on [[Volotovo Church|Volotovo Field]], 1180s) and to St.&amp;nbsp;Paraskeva-Piatnitsa (at [[Yaroslav's Court]], 1207). The greatest masterpiece of early Novgorod architecture is the [[Nereditsa Church|Savior church at Nereditsa]] (1198).

In the 13th century, tiny churches of the three-paddled design were in vogue. These are represented by a small chapel at the [[Peryn Chapel|Peryn Monastery]] (1230s) and St.&amp;nbsp;Nicholas' on the Lipnya Islet (1292, also notable for its 14th-century frescoes). The next century saw the development of two original church designs, one of them culminating in [[:ru:Церковь Фёдора Стратилата на Ручью|St Theodor's church]] (1360–1361, fine frescoes from 1380s), and another one leading to the [[Church of the Transfiguration on Ilyina Street|Savior church on Ilyina street]] (1374, painted in 1378 by [[Feofan Grek]]). The [[Transfiguration Church in Kovalyovo|Savior' church in Kovalevo]] (1345) was originally frescoed by [[Serbia]]n masters, but the church was destroyed during the war. While the church has since been rebuilt, the frescoes have not been restored.

During the last century of the republican government, some new churches were consecrated to Saints&amp;nbsp;Peter and Paul (on Slavna, 1367; in Kozhevniki, 1406), to Christ's Nativity (at the Cemetery, 1387), to St.&amp;nbsp;John the Apostle's (1384), to the Twelve Apostles (1455), to St Demetrius (1467), to St.&amp;nbsp;Simeon (1462), and other saints. Generally, they are not thought{{by who|date=June 2018}} to be as innovative as the churches from the previous period. Several shrines from the 12th century (i.e., in Opoki) were demolished brick by brick and then reconstructed exactly as they used to be, several of them in the mid-fifteenth century, again under Archbishop Yevfimy&amp;nbsp;II (Euthymius II), perhaps one of the greatest patrons of architecture in medieval Novgorod.

Novgorod's conquest by [[Ivan III of Russia|Ivan&amp;nbsp;III]] in 1478 decisively changed the character of local architecture. Large commissions were thenceforth executed by Muscovite masters and patterned after cathedrals of [[Moscow Kremlin]]: e.g., the Savior Cathedral of [[Khutyn Monastery]] (1515), the Cathedral of the Mother of God of the Sign (1688), the St. Nicholas Cathedral of Vyaschizhy Monastery (1685). Nevertheless, the styles of some parochial churches were still in keeping with local traditions: e.g., the churches of Myrrh-bearing Women (1510) and of Saints&amp;nbsp;[[Boris and Gleb]] (1586).

In Vitoslavlitsy, along the [[Volkhov River]] and the [[Myachino Lake]], close to the [[Yuriev Monastery]], a museum of wooden architecture was established in 1964. Over twenty wooden buildings (churches, houses and mills) dating from the 14th to the 19th century were transported there from all around the Novgorod region.

==Transportation==
===Intercity transport===
[[File:Novgorod - Main railstation.jpg|thumb|Novgorod main railway station, built in 1953]]

Novgorod has connections to [[Moscow]] (531&amp;nbsp;km) and [[Saint Petersburg|St.&amp;nbsp;Petersburg]] (189&amp;nbsp;km) by the [[Russian Route M10|federal highway M10]]. There are public buses to [[Saint Petersburg]] and other destinations.

The city has direct railway passenger connections with [[Moscow]] ([[Leningradsky Rail Terminal]], by night trains), [[St. Petersburg]] ([[Moskovsky Rail Terminal (Saint Petersburg)|Moscow Rail Terminal]] and [[Vitebsk Rail Terminal]], by [[suburban train]]s), [[Minsk]] ([[Belarus]]) ([[Minsk Passazhirsky railway station]], by night trains) and [[Murmansk]].

The city's airports [[Yurievo Airport|Yurievo]] and [[Krechevitsy Airport|Krechevitsy]] do not serve any regular flights since the middle 1990s. The nearest international airport is St.&amp;nbsp;Petersburg's [[Pulkovo Airport|Pulkovo]], some {{convert|180|km|0|abbr=off}} north of the city.

===Local transportation===
Local transportation consists of a network of buses and [[trolleybus]]es. The trolleybus network, which currently consists of five routes, started operating in 1995 and is the first trolley system opened in Russia after the fall of the [[Soviet Union]].

The '''1954 to 1959''' phase of the '''[[Vietnam War]]''' was the era of the two nations. Coming after the [[First Indochina War]], this period resulted in the military defeat of the [[French Fourth Republic|French]], a [[Geneva Conference (1954)|1954 Geneva meeting]] that [[partition of Vietnam|partitioned Vietnam]] into North and South, and the French [[Withdrawal of French troops from Vietnam|withdrawal from Vietnam]], leaving the [[Republic of Vietnam]] regime fighting a [[communist]] insurgency with USA aid. During this period, [[North Vietnam]] recovered from the wounds of war, rebuilt nationally, and accrued to prepare for the anticipated war. In South Vietnam, [[Ngô Đình Diệm]] consolidated power and encouraged [[anti-communism]]. This period was marked by [[U.S. support to South Vietnam before Gulf of Tonkin]], as well as communist infrastructure-building.

The period ended with major negotiations, but formal discussions had started as early as 1950, with less formal meetings during and immediately after the Second World War. France gave limited autonomy in February 1950, Associated States of [[Indochina]] ([[Vietnam]], Laos, and Cambodia) within the French Union.&lt;ref name=Eckhardt&gt;{{citation

==U.S. missions to Indochina==
U.S. aid to the non-Communist forces of the area had started in 1950, both with materiel and assistance to the French doing the primary training. It had to wait for  U.S. aid was administered by the Military Assistance Advisory Group, Indochina (MAAG-I), which had been established in October 1950 under the command of [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] (BG) Francis G. Brink, followed by [[Major general (United States)|major general]] (MG) T.J.H. Trapnell.

Starting in 1952, a more senior officer, [[Lieutenant general (United States)|lieutenant general]] (LTG) [[John W. O'Daniel]], Commanding General, U.S. Army, Pacific (USARPAC), made three fact-finding trips to France, after  Marshal [[Jean de Lattre de Tassigny]], dying of cancer, had been replaced by General [[Raoul Salan]] on 1 April 1952, and after General Henri-Eugene Navarre had succeeded General Salan in May of the following year. While he had no effect on French operations, he did build relationships. O'Daniel had been a [[Division (military)|division]] commander during the [[Korean War]], so was not unknown since the French had forces in that war.&lt;ref&gt;Eckhardt, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the relationships both with the French and Vietnamese changed with the French defeat and gradual withdrawal. French trainers did not abruptly withdraw in 1954 after the Geneva accords, and, indeed, there was a French desire to stay involved in training the South Vietnamese. Part of this may have been pride, and partially a desire to maintain French influence.

France's painful withdrawal may have led to its lack of cooperation in European defense arrangements that included the United States.  France rejected European Defense Community on August 30, 1954, possibly to thank the Soviets for help at Geneva. But it is certain that many French were persuaded that the U.S. and the UK furnished inadequate support to France during the latter phases of the war, and at the Conference. And it is equally certain that American policy in the aftermath of Geneva widely alienated affection for the U.S. in France, and created that lack of confidence which the Suez crisis of summer, 1956, translated into outright distrust.

All the foregoing tension resolved to two central issues between the United States and France. The first was the question of how and by whom Vietnam's armed forces were to be trained. In addition, the Geneva accords limited the number of advisers that could be assigned, and specified that equipment could be replaced, but that no additional quantities be given. These agreements were ignored by all.

The second, and more far-reaching, was whether Ngô Đình Diệm was to remain at the head of Vietnam's government, or whether he was to be replaced by another nationalist leader more sympathetic to Bảo Đại and France. The first issue was resolved relatively quickly. General Collins struck an agreement with General Ely in Vietnam by which, despite serious misgivings in Paris, France agreed to turn over the training of the Vietnamese army to the U.S. and to withdraw French cadres.

US personnel dealing with the Government of Vietnam had difficulty in understanding the politics. The diplomats were not getting clear information in 1954 and early 1955, but the CIA station "had and has no mandate or mission to perform systematic intelligence and espionage in friendly countries, and so lacks the resources to gather and evaluate the large amounts of information required on political forces, corruption, connections, and so on."&lt;ref name=PPv1D95&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, after the end of French rule, Laos became independent, but with a struggle there among political factions, with neutralists heading the government and a strong Pathet Lao insurgency. Laos, also not to have had foreign military involvement according to the Geneva agreement, quickly had the [[CIA activities in Asia-Pacific#Politics of Laos and the CIA|beginnings of U.S. involvement]] as well as the continuing effects of North Vietnam sponsoring the Pathet Lao.

==Communist strategy==
In a section titled "The Viet Minh Residue", the ''Pentagon Papers'' cited a study of 23 Viet Minh who had, according to U.S. analysts, gave consistent stories of being given stay-behind roles by the Viet Minh leadership going north. Some were given political roles, while others were told to await orders. "It is quite clear that even the activists were not instructed to organize units for guerrilla war, but rather to agitate politically for the promised Geneva elections, and the normalization of relations with the North. They drew much reassurance from the presence of the ICC, and up until mid-1956, most held on to the belief that the elections would take place. They were disappointed in two respects: not only were the promised elections not held, but the amnesty which had been assured by the Geneva Settlement was denied them, and they were hounded by the Anti-Communist campaign. After 1956, for the most part, they went "underground.""&lt;ref name=PntV1Ch05Sec0314-346&gt;{{citation
 | title =The Pentagon Papers, Gravel Edition, Volume 1
 | contribution = Volume 1, Chapter 4, "U.S. and France in Indochina, 1950-56", Section 3, pp. 314-346
 | url = http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/pentagon/pent14.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Viet Minh went underground in 1956, but there was no major decision until 1959. A 1964 interrogation report said "The period from the Armistice of 1954 until 1958 was the darkest time for the VC in South Vietnam. The political agitation policy proposed by the Communist Party could not be carried out due to the arrest of a number of party members by RVN authorities...In 1959 the party combined its political agitation with its military operations, and by the end of 1959 the combined operations were progressing smoothly." Note that this prisoner did not deny there were guerilla operations, but the document does not identify specific acts until 1957.

==Southern strategy==
After partition, the South worked on defining an identity. Its core had been Buddhist, but also had a number of influential groups, some religious and some simply taking power. Now, hundreds of thousands, close to a million, Northern refugees, mostly Catholic, joined the approximate 5 million population in the South.

Diệm, who was backed by the U.S.  was an Annamite, from Central Vietnam (although not the Central Highlands) in the South upon taking power. In seeking political support from Southerners, he was not nearly as visible as Bảo Đại, nor was he seen as sympathetic to Buddhism or the smaller minorities. Diệm had to create a viable alternative to the Viet Minh in those areas where the French had provided security, both the cities and towns, but also in pockets of the rural areas inhabited by people of the regional or "folk" religions, such as the [[Cao Đài]]. The existing upper class might be wealthy, but the French had found it was neither popular nor internally cohesive.&lt;ref name=Sorley&gt;{{citation

While the Communists certainly had external assistance, they still considered themselves Vietnamese Communists. Clearly, pure geography would prevent them from being a Soviet satellite, and the long history of Chinese conquest and Sino-Vietnamese conflict would also limit the role of Great Powers in defining the DRV.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Vis-a-vis Great Powers and the South, however, the situation was quite different. [[John Foster Dulles]] and the [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower administration]] had a priority of stopping Communism everywhere, and saw South Vietnam as a key barrier to Communist expansion.&lt;ref name=Patti&gt;{{cite book

}}, pp.443-444&lt;/ref&gt; Diệm, despite his personal rigidity, distrust of those outside his immediate circle, and minority ethnicity and religion, was, most  importantly to the U.S., neither pro-Communist nor pro-French. That he was a nationalist was secondary. The ideal of U.S. policy was for Diệm to form a representative government, oust Bảo Đại, and introduce democracy. French relations with the U.S., with France seen as an important anti-Communist resource in Europe, complicated the situation. The French ambassador to the U.S. warned John Foster Dulles that American support was being offered to Diệm without conditions that he form a stable and representative government. Guy le Chambre, French minister for the Associated States (i.e., Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia) reportedly felt Diệm would lead the country into disaster, but, since the U.S. had so visibly supported him, 

&lt;blockquote&gt; We would prefer to lose in Vietnam with the US than to win without them...we would rather support Diệm knowing he is to lose and thus keep Franco-US solidarity than to pick someone who could retain Vietnam for the free world if this meant breaking Franco-US solidarity.&lt;ref&gt;Patti, p. 444&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Events==

===1954===
[[Lieutenant general|Lieutenant General]] (LTG) Michael "Iron Mike" O'Daniel had been a U.S. observer in Indochina before Dien Bien Phu.&lt;ref name=Beech&gt;{{citation
 | url = http://webstorage4.mcpa.virginia.edu/lbj/oralhistory/beech_keyes_1983_0322.pdf
 | title = Oral interviews of Keyes Beech
 | date =March 22, 1983
 | editor = Ted Gittinger
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keyes Beech, a reporter for the ''Chicago Daily News'', said that O'Daniel was optimistic of forming tank divisions and saving Dien Bien Phu, but was both sensitive to, and contemptuous of, the French. Beech quoted him as saying "I can understand why they are sensitive, but not what they are proud of."

In deference to French sensibilities and to ensure the seniority of the French Commander in Chief in Indochina, O'Daniel relinquished his third star and reverted to the rank of major general.

LTG O'Daniel was to have retired, but was convinced to come to Vietnam, in April 1954, as the third head of MAAG-I. Lieutenant General John W. O'Daniel, Commanding General, U.S. Army, Pacific (USARPAC), on three trips to Indochina. General O'Daniel's visits were made after General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny had been replaced by General Raoul Salan on 1 April 1952, and after General Henri-Eugene Navarre had succeeded General Salan in May of the following year.  With him was then-[[Lieutenant Colonel]] William B. Rosson, who would later rise to high rank with the U.S. combat forces in Vietnam.

====Agreements and arrivals in June====
[[Ngô Đình Diệm]] arrived in Saigon from France on 25 June 1954. and, with U.S. and French support, was named Premier of the State of Vietnam by Emperor Bảo Đại, who had just won French assent to "treaties of independence and association" on 4 June.

On June 15, O'Daniel had established an informal agreement for U.S. training of native forces, with General [[Paul Ély]], who had replaced Navarre in the dual roles of French High Commissioner and commander of military forces. This arrangement, however, was not to be formalized until December.

The initial [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) team in Saigon was the Saigon Military Mission (SMM), headed by United States Air Force Colonel [[Edward Lansdale]], who arrived on 1 June 1954. The SMM was ''not'' part of the CIA Station in the Embassy. His [[Clandestine HUMINT operational techniques#Station under Diplomatic Cover|diplomatic cover job]] was Assistant Air Attaché. The broad mission for the team was to undertake paramilitary operations against the enemy and to wage political-psychological warfare.&lt;ref name=PPv1D95 /&gt; Beech observed Lansdale to become an "adviser and confidant" of Diệm.&lt;ref&gt;Beech, p. I-5&lt;/ref&gt;

Working in close cooperation with the [[United States Information Agency]] (USIA), a new psychological warfare campaign was devised for the Vietnamese Army and for the government in Hanoi. Shortly after, a refresher course in combat [[Information Operations (United States)|psychological warfare]] was constructed and Vietnamese Army personnel were rushed through it.

The second SMM member, MAJ [[Lucien Conein]], arrived on July 1.  A paramilitary specialist, well-known to the French for his help with French-operated maquis in Tonkin against the Japanese in 1945, he was the one American guerrilla fighter who had not been a member of the Patti Mission. Conein was to have a continuing role, especially in the coup that overthrew Diệm in November 1963. In August, Conein was sent to Hanoi, to begin forming a guerilla organization. A second paramilitary team for the south was formed, with Army LT Edward Williams doing double duty as the only experienced counter-espionage officer, working with revolutionary political groups.

In August, a National Intelligence Estimate, produced by the CIA, predicted that the Communists, legitimized by the Geneva agreement, would take quick control of the North, and plan to take over all of Vietnam. The estimate went on that Diệm's government was opposed both by Communist and non-Communist elements. Pro-French factions were seen as preparing to overthrow it, while [[Việt Minh]] would take a longer view. Under command of the north, Viet Minh individuals and small units will stay in the south and create an underground, discredit the government, and undermine French-Vietnamese relations.

The final agreement between France and the U.S., executed with the senior French official in Vietnam with GEN [[J. Lawton Collins]], President Eisenhower's special envoy to Saigon, General [[J. Lawton Collins]], concluded a formal agreement with General Ely on 13 December. Collins had served as [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Chief of Staff of the Army]], and was the U.S. representative to the [[NATO]] Military Committee until 1956. His additional duties to Saigon were within the scope of the U.S. defense system centered on NATO; he had the personal diplomatic rank of Ambassador. This was his last assignment before retirement.&lt;ref name=Collins-CSI&gt;{{citation

===1955: Establishing two Vietnams===
Cardinal Francis Spellman, in the region to visit U.S. troops, came to Vietnam in early January, celebrated masses, and gave a donation to Catholic Relief Services.  While various reports suggested Spellman was Diệm's patron in the U.S., it seems likely that his visit was one for his coreligionists. Obviously, Spellman would not be unhappy with a Catholic leader, but the U.S. was quite aware that Diệm's Catholicism isolated him from the majority of South Vietnamese. When an Australian cardinal visited Vietnam shortly afterwards, J. Lawton Collins suggested to Diệm's brother, the Bishop of Huế, that there be a moratorium on high-level Catholic visits. Collins suggested that these visits aggravated the isolation of Diệm from the majority.

Lansdale also advised against Diệm being too visible with his Catholicism, citing an anti-Catholic bias in U.S. politics and a concern about creating a "Vatican state".  As a response to Spellman's visibility as a member of the hierarchy, Lansdale encouraged U.S. support of Dr. Tom Dooley, a physician volunteer for the "Passage to Freedom" refugee program, who was Catholic but not clerical.&lt;ref name=Anderson&gt;{{citation

The U.S. and France, going into 1955, were dubious of Diệm's ability to unify South Vietnam, but there was no obvious alternative: anti-French, nationalist, anti-Bảo Đại.  The French supported the Vietnamese National Army chief of staff, Gen. Nguyen van Hinh.  Hinh, working with the [[Cao Đài]], [[Hòa Hảo]], and [[Bình Xuyên]], failed to organize a coup.

In January, the Republic of Vietnam received its first direct shipment of military supplies from the U.S. The U.S. also offers to train the fledgling South Vietnam Army. A paramilitary group had cached its supplies in Haiphong, having had them shipped by [[Civil Air Transport]], a CIA proprietary airline belonging to the Directorate of Support.

On February 12, 1955, the U.S. assumed responsibility for training Vietnamese forces, and the French disassociation began.&lt;ref name=PntV1Ch05Sec01179-214&gt;{{citation

 | url = http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/pentagon/pent9.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Tây Ninh]] on February 22, the "United Front" against Diệm was formed, composed of Cao Đài, Hòa Hảo, [[Dan Xa Dang]], [[Lien Minh]] and Bình Xuyên representatives.  On 28 April, Diệm, against U.S. advice, against French advice, and against the advice of his cabinet, [[Ngo_Dinh_Diem#Becoming_Prime_Minister_and_consolidation_of_power|moved again against the sects]].

In June, concerned that Viet Minh might win, Diệm abolished elections for village councils.&lt;ref name=PntV1Ch05Sec01&gt;{{citation

By replacing it at all, he inherited responsibility for corruption at that level. His appointments were usually from outside the villages; outsiders that he considered "dependable" Catholics, Northerners, or others not tied to the rural culture. This drove the villagers to the sort of conspiracy that they used against the French.

The Geneva agreements had specified the start of consultations on the 1956 referendum would begin, between Hanoi and Saigon, in July 1955.&lt;ref&gt;Patti, p. 447&lt;/ref&gt; Diệm refused to enter into talks. On 20 July, Vietnam announced that it would not participate in talks for the reunification of North and South Vietnam through the elections that were scheduled for the following year, according to the Geneva agreements.&lt;ref name="Eckhardt, p. 13"&gt;Eckhardt, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Diệm pointed out that his government had not signed the Geneva agreements, and thus was not subject to them. The U.S. did not—as is often alleged—connive with Diệm to ignore the elections. The U.S. expected elections to be held and fully supported them.&lt;ref name=PntV1Ch05Sec01 /&gt;

====Northern developments====
In 1999, Robert McNamara wrote that both sides had missed opportunities. As he entered government in 1960, he freely admits he knew little about Vietnam, but his colleagues, ranging from the President and Vice President, to the [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] and [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] were convinced that China and the Soviet Union saw Vietnam as the starting point for the Communist conquest of Southeast Asia. Postwar discussions between McNamara and North Vietnamese told him that the Hanoi leadership saw the U.S. as the main enemy, "imperialists" bent on crushing the North and occupying the entire country. His 1999 conclusion (''his emphasis'') was 

&lt;blockquote&gt;But what was the reality? ''Hanoi was no domino! Washington was no imperialist!''...In 1961 the North Vietnamese government and the Kennedy Administration saw each other through fifteen years of Cold War rhetoric. 
&lt;ref name=McNamara1999&gt;{{citation

Both sides, according to McNamara, had missed opportunities both after the end of the Second World War, and at the Geneva conferences. In 1945, China was in civil war, and some of the Vietnamese politicians in exile were in China. An [[Office of Strategic Services]] team, commanded by MAJ [[Archimedes Patti]], had been in China with the Vietnamese, and moved south with them; Washington paid little attention to their reporting, but Ho did not follow up the lack of response.&lt;ref name=Patti2&gt;{{citation

Huynh said his delegation failed, given that as encouragement, to seek out the Americans and explain the nationalist position. An American diplomat, Chester Cooper, was at the conference, and said he could never decide to whom, or if, the North Vietnamese were "reporting".&lt;ref&gt;McNamara, pp. 96-97&lt;/ref&gt;

====Autumn and winter; the fall of Diệm opponents====
On 26 October Ngô Đình Diệm became President and Commander-in-Chief after defeating Bảo Đại in an election.&lt;ref name="Eckhardt, p. 13"/&gt; The election, however, seemed less than ideally honest; Diệm's overall margin over Bảo Đại was 98.2 percent, and Diệm received 605,000 votes from the 405,000 registered voters of Saigon.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, pp. 86-87&lt;/ref&gt;

In America, President Eisenhower pledges his support for the new government and offers military aid. U.S. representatives tell Hinh that another coup attempt would cut off U.S. aid. Diệm ordered Hinh out of the country in September, but Hinh refused. Eventually, Bảo Đại invited Hinh to France, and Hinh left Vietnam on November 19.

December was a time of land reform in both North and South. In the North, it was a period of ideological purges, with thousands of landowners executed or imprisoned (see Giap below)

In 1955, the first part of Diệm's land reforms involved resettling refugees and other land destitute Vietnamese on uncultivated land;&lt;ref name=PntV1Ch05Sec01 /&gt; the ownership of this land was not always clear.

===1956===
Under the French, the [[Montagnard (Vietnam)|Montagnard]] tribes of the [[Central Highlands, Vietnam|Central Highlands]] had had autonomy from the lowland colonial government. In 1956, these areas were absorbed into the Republic of Vietnam, and Diêm moved ethnic Vietnamese, as well as refugees from the North,  into "land development centers" in the Central Highlands. Diệm intended to assimilate the unwilling tribes, a point of ethnic resentment that was to become one of the many resentments against Diệm.&lt;ref name=HRW-RoM-Ch03&gt;{{citation

 | url = https://www.hrw.org/reports/2002/vietnam/viet0402-03.htm#TopOfPage}}&lt;/ref&gt; These resentments both cost internal support, and certainly were exploited by the Communists.

The US [[Military Assistance Advisory Group]] (MAAG) assumed responsibility, from French, for training South Vietnamese forces.

As part of a response to excesses in Northern land reform, for which Ho dismissed [[Trường Chinh]] as head of the program, Võ Nguyên Giáp, in the fall of 1956, offered the self-criticism for the Party:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We made too many deviations and executed too many honest people. We attacked on too large a front and, seeing enemies everywhere, resorted to terror, which became far too widespread. . . . Whilst carrying out our land reform program we failed to respect the principles of freedom of faith and worship in many areas . . . in regions inhabited by minority tribes we have attacked tribal chiefs too strongly, thus injuring, instead of respecting, local customs and manners. . . . When reorganizing the party, we paid too much importance to the notion of social class instead of adhering firmly to political qualifications alone. Instead of recognizing education to be the first essential, we resorted exclusively to organizational measures [using punishment].&lt;ref name=PntV1Ch05Sec01 /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

In late 1956 one of the leading communists in the south, [[Lê Duẩn]], returned to [[Hanoi]] to urge that the [[Vietnam Workers' Party]] take a firmer stand on national reunification, but Hanoi hesitated in launching a full-scale military struggle. In the fall of 1956, Diệm dealt strongly with another group not considered of his circle: the approximately 1,000,000 Chinese-identified people of Vietnam, who dominated much of the economy.&lt;ref name="time.com.1957"&gt;{{cite web |ref=harv|date= May 13, 1957|url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,867643,00.html|title = South Vietnam: 500,000 Uncles|publisher = [[Time (magazine)|TIME magazine]]| accessdate = May 4, 2010 | last=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]| first= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He barred "foreigners", including Chinese, from 11 kinds of businesses, and demanded the half-million Vietnamese-born men, known as "uncles",  "Vietnamize", including changing their names to a Vietnamese form. His vice-president, Nguyen Ngoc Tho, was put in charge of the program.

===1957===
As opposition to Diệm's rule in South Vietnam grew, a low-level [[insurgency]] began to take shape there in 1957, conducted mainly by [[Viet Minh]] cadres who had remained in the south and had hidden caches of weapons in case unification failed to take place through elections. This widespread campaign of terror included bombings and assassinations. Guerilla attacks reported included the killing of a group, not further identified, of 17 people in [[Châu Đốc]] in July, 1957. A District chief and his family were killed in September. In October, the clandestine radio of the "National Salvation Movement" began to broadcast support for armed opposition to Diệm. By year's end, over 400 South Vietnamese officials were killed. Operations appeared to solidify in October, beyond what might have been small group actions:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In Washington, U.S. intelligence indicated that the "Viet Minh underground" had been directed to conduct additional attacks on U.S. personnel "whenever conditions are favorable." U.S. intelligence also noted a total of 30 armed "terrorist incidents initiated by Communist guerillas" in the last quarter of 1957, as well as a "large number" of incidents carried out by "Communist-lead [sic] [[Hòa Hảo]] and [[Cao Đài]] dissident elements", and reported "at least" 75 civilians or civil officials assassinated or kidnapped in the same period.&lt;ref name="PntV1Ch05Sec01"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In December 1957, the Soviet Union and China agreed to proposals to seat both the North and South, as independent countries, in the United Nations. Their decision was based on a growing east-west détente, but the North Vietnamese saw it as a sellout of their goal of reunification, and this may have led to their decision, in 1959, to seek reunification through military means.&lt;ref name="Donaldson, p. 88"&gt;Donaldson, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Elbridge Durbrow]] became U.S. Ambassador in April, succeeding [[G. Frederick Reinhardt]].

===1958: North Vietnam looks South===
Beginning with a plantation raid in January and a truck ambush in February, there was steady guerilla ambushes and raids became more regular in 1958, and of serious concern to the GVN.  This intensity level was consistent with Mao's Phase I, "the period of the enemy's strategic offensive and our strategic defensive." &lt;ref name=MaoProtracted&gt;{{citation

}}, pp. 136-137&lt;/ref&gt; Mao's use of "strategic defensive" refers to the guerilla force making its presence known and building its organization, but not attempting to engage military units.  George Carver, the principal CIA analyst on Vietnam, said in a ''Foreign Affairs'' article, 

&lt;blockquote&gt;A pattern of politically motivated terror began to emerge, directed against the representatives of the Saigon government and concentrated on the very bad and the very good. The former were liquidated to win favor with the peasantry; the latter because their effectiveness was a bar to the achievement of Communist objectives. The terror was directed not only against officials but against all whose operations were essential to the functioning of organized political society, school teachers, health workers, agricultural officials, etc. The scale and scope of this terrorist and insurrectionary activity mounted slowly and steadily. By the end of 1958 the participants in this incipient insurgency, whom Saigon quite accurately termed the "Viet Cong", constituted a serious threat to South Viet Nam's political stability&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On March 7, President Diệm received a letter from North Vietnam Prime Minister [[Phạm Văn Đồng]] proposing a discussion on troop reductions and trade relations as a renewed step towards reunification. On 26 April, Diệm rejected any discussion until North Vietnam had established "democratic liberties" similar to those in the South. A coordinated command structure was formed by Communists in the [[Mekong Delta]] where 37 armed companies were being organized in June 1958. North Vietnam [[North Vietnamese invasion of Laos|invaded Laos]] and occupied parts of the country. Fall reported that the GVN lost almost 20% of its village chiefs through 1958.&lt;ref name=PntV1Ch05Sec01 /&gt;

===1959===
On March 1959, the armed revolution began as Ho Chi Minh declared a People's War to unite all of Vietnam under his leadership. His Politburo now ordered a changeover to an all-out military struggle. Thus began the [[Second Indochina War]].

On July 1959, North Vietnam [[North Vietnamese invasion of Laos|invaded Laos]], opening the first tracks of what was to become the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]].

'''Youssef Seddik''' ({{lang-aeb|يوسف الصديق}}) (born in 1943 in [[Tozeur]]) is a noted [[Tunisia]]n [[philosopher]] and [[anthropologist]] specializing in [[Ancient Greece]] and the anthropology of the [[Qur'an]].

==Biography==

In 1966, he obtained a master's degree in philosophy and a degree in French literature and civilization. During the next four years, he taught at the French school in [[Compiègne]] in 1967 and obtained a DES  (''{{Interlanguage link multi|diplôme d'études supérieures|fr}}'', roughly equivalent to an [[Master of Arts|MA]]) in Philosophy and a degree in Ancient Greece.&lt;ref name="arte"&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.arte.tv/fr/permis-de-penser/Ce-mois-ci/834976.html Portrait of Youssef Seddik] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090821165909/http://www.arte.tv/fr/permis-de-penser/Ce-mois-ci/834976.html |date=August 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

From 1971 to 1977 he taught philosophy in secondary schools in Tunisia and at the [[University of Paris III: Sorbonne Nouvelle]], before becoming director of a publishing company specializing in books for young people between 1984 and 1987. He was also a reporter of the journal ''[[La Presse de Tunisie]]'' between 1975 and 1983.&lt;ref name="RF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sites.radiofrance.fr/chaines/france-culture2/emissions/camedit/fiche.php?diffusion_id=57308 |title=Youssef Seddik |publisher=[[Radio France]] |accessdate=August 22, 2009 |language=fr |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090901003134/http://sites.radiofrance.fr/chaines/france-culture2/emissions/camedit/fiche.php?diffusion_id=57308 |archivedate=September 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based in [[Paris]] in 1988, he obtained a DEA in the Greek language and civilization from the  University of Paris III: Sorbonne Nouvelle (1988) and a doctorate at the [[École des hautes études en sciences sociales]] (1995).&lt;ref name="arte"/&gt; He lectured there and also in modern Islamic philosophy at the Sorbonne from 1995 to 1996.

Seddik has published many books and translations based on Ancient Greece and Islamic heritage, including works related to the Prophet [[Muhammad]], [[Imam Ali]], and the [[Qur'an]]. He also attempted to publish a Qur'an  in the form of seven volumes of comics, but was halted after objections from the Tunisian religious authorities in 1992.&lt;ref name="RF"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iesr.ephe.sorbonne.fr/index3689.html|title=Seddik, Youssef|publisher=European Institute of Sciences and Religions|accessdate=August 22, 2009|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 he published a book entitled ''Brins de chicane. La vie quotidienne à Bagdad au Xe siècle'' about daily life in [[Baghdad]] in the tenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ellipse.ch/Produit.aspx?Produit=899938 |title=Brins de chicane.

His book, ''Nous n'avons jamais lu le Coran'', released in September 2004 explores the language and symbols that are present in the Koran. In the book the author begins with the questioning of the politics of Islam and the role of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://livre.fnac.com/a1553849/Youssef-Seddik-Nous-n-avons-jamais-lu-le-Coran?PID=1|title=Nous n'avons jamais lu le Coran |publisher=livre.fnac.com|accessdate=August 22, 2009|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also directed documentaries including a series of five episodes on Muhammad.&lt;ref name="arte"/&gt;
