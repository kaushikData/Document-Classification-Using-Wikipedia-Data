The timely-ness of the exhibit was remarked on in several exhibition reviews.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="150835">The city of Paris has notable examples of architecture of every period from the Middle Ages to the 21st century.  It was the birthplace of the [[Gothic style]],  and has important monuments of the [[French Renaissance]], the Classical revival, and flamboyant style of the reign of [[Napoleon III]]; the [[Paris architecture of the Belle Époque|Belle Époque]], and the [[Art Nouveau]] style.  The great Paris Universal Expositions of 1889 and 1900 added Paris landmarks, including the [[Eiffel Tower]] and [[Grand Palais]].  In the 20th century, the [[Art Deco]] style of architecture first appeared in Paris, and Paris architects also influenced the [[postmodern architecture]] of the second half of the century.

==Gallo-Roman architecture==

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Very little architecture remains from the ancient town of [[Lutetia]], founded by a Celtic tribe known as the [[Parisii (Gaul)|Parisii]] in about the 3rd century BC.  It was conquered by the Romans in 52 BC, and turned into a Gallo-Roman garrison town.  It was rebuilt in the 1st century AD on the classic Roman plan;  a north-south axis, or ''cardo'' (now rue Saint-Jacques); and an east-west axis, or ''decumanus'', of which traces have been found on the [[Île de la Cité]], at rue de Lutèce.  The center of Roman administration was on the island;  the Roman governor's palace stood where the Palais de Justice is located today.  The right bank was largely undeveloped.  The city grew up the Left Bank, on the slopes of Mount Saint-Geneviève.  The Roman forum was on the summit of the hill, under the present Rue Soufflot, between the boulevard Saint-Michel and rue Saint-Jacques,{{Sfn|Fierro|1997|pages=11–12}}

The Roman town had three large baths near the forum, supplied with water by a 46-kilometer-long aqueduct. Vestiges of one bath, the [[Thermes de Cluny]], can still be seen on [[Boulevard Saint-Michel]].  It was the largest of the three baths, one hundred meters by sixty-five meters, and was built at the end of the 2nd century or beginning of the 3rd century BC, at the height of the town's grandeur. The baths are now part of the [[Musée national du Moyen Âge]], or National Museum of the Middle Ages. Nearby, on rue Monge,  are the vestiges of the Roman amphitheater, called the [[Arènes de Lutèce]], which was discovered and restored in the 19th century.  Though the population of the town was probably no more than 5–6 thousand persons, the amphitheater measured 130 meters by 100 meters, and could seat fifteen thousand persons. Fifteen tiers of seats remain from the original thirty-five. It was built in the 1st century AD and was used for the combat of gladiators and animals, and also for theatrical performances.{{Sfn|Fierro|1997|pages=11–12}}

Another notable piece of Gallo-Roman architecture was discovered under the choir of Notre-Dame de Paris; the [[Pillar of the Boatmen]], a fragment of a Roman column with carvings of both Roman and Gallic gods. It was probably made at the beginning of the 1st century during the reign of the Emperor [[Tiberius]] to honor the league of the boatmen, who played an important part in the town's economy and religious and civic life. It is now on display in the Roman baths at the Museum of the Middle Ages.  Other fragments of Gallo-Roman architecture are found in the crypt under the square in front of the Cathedral of Notre Dame;  and in the Church of [[Saint-Pierre de Montmartre]], where several Roman columns, probably from a temple, were re-used in the late 12th century to build a Christian church. {{Sfn|Texier|2004|pages=8–9}}

==Romanesque churches==
&lt;gallery mode="packed" heights="150px&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Unlike the south of France, Paris has very few examples of Romanesque architecture; most churches and other buildings in that style were rebuilt in the Gothic style.  The most remarkable example of Romanesque architecture in Paris is the church of the [[Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés]], built between 990 and 1160 during the reign of [[Robert II of France|Robert the Pious]].  An earlier church had been destroyed by the [[Vikings]] in the 9th century.  The oldest elements of the original church existing today are the tower (the belfry at the top was added in the 12th century), and the chapel of Saint Symphorien, on the south flank of the bell tower, built in the 11th century.  It is considered the earliest existing place of worship in Paris.  The gothic choir, with its flying buttresses, was added in the mid-12th century, it was consecrated by [[Pope Alexander III]], in 1163.  It was one of the earliest gothic style elements to appear in a Paris church.&lt;ref&gt;Brochure of the Church of Saint-Germain-des-Prés, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Romanesque and Gothic elements are found together in several old Paris churches. The church of [[Saint-Pierre de Montmartre]] (1147–1200) is only surviving building of the vast Abbey of Montmartre, which once covered the top of the hill; it has both ancient Roman columns and one of the first examples of a Gothic arched ceiling, in the nave near the choir.  The interior of the church of [[Saint-Julien-le-Pauvre]] (1170–1220) has been extensively rebuilt, but it still has massive Romanesque columns and the exterior is a classic example of the Romano-Gothic style. The former priory of Saint-Martin-des-Champs (1060–1140) has a choir and chapels supported by ''contreforts'' and a Romanesque bell tower. It now belongs to the Musee des Arts et Metiers. {{sfn|Texier|2012|pages=10–11}}

===The Palais de la Cité===
In 987 [[Hugues Capet]] became the first King of France, and established his capital in Paris, though at the time his kingdom was little bigger than the Île-de-France, or modern Paris region. The first royal residence, the [[Palais de la Cité]], was established within the fortress at the western end of the [[Île de la Cité]], where the Roman governors had established their residence. Capet and his successors gradually enlarged their kingdom through marriages and conquests.  His son, [[Robert II of France|Robert the Pious]] (972–1031), built the first palace, the Palais de la Cité,  and royal chapel within the walls of the fortress, and his successors embellished it over the centuries; by the reign of [[Philippe le Bel]] in the 14th century, it was the most magnificent palace in Europe.  The tallest structure was the Grosse Tour, or great tower, built by [[Louis VI of France|Louis le Gros]] between 1080 and 1137. It had a diameter of 11.7 meters at the base and walls three meters thick, and remained until its demolition in 1776. The ensemble of buildings (seen in the image at right as they were between 1412 and 1416) included a royal residence, a great hall for ceremonies, and four large towers along the Seine on the north side of the island, as well as a gallery of luxury shops, the first Paris shopping center. Between 1242 and 1248 King [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]], later known as Saint Louis,  built an exquisite gothic chapel, [[Sainte-Chapelle]],  to house the relics of the [[Passion of Christ]] which he had acquired from the Emperor of Byzantium. {{sfn|Delon|2000|pages=6–8}}

In 1358 a rebellion of the Parisian merchants against the royal authority, led by [[Étienne Marcel]], caused the King, [[Charles V of France|Charles V]], to move his residence to a new palace, the [[Hôtel Saint-Pol]], near the [[Bastille]] at the eastern edge of the city. The Palace was used occasionally for special ceremonies and to welcome foreign monarchs, but housed the administrative offices and courts of the Kingdom, as well as an important prison. The Great Hall was destroyed by a fire in 1618, rebuilt;  another fire in 1776 destroyed the residence of the King, the tower of Mongomery.  During the [[French Revolution]], the revolutionary tribunal was housed in the building; hundreds of persons, including Queen [[Marie Antoinette]], were tried and imprisoned there, before being taken to the guillotine.  After the Revolution the Conciergerie served as a prison and courthouse. It was burned by the [[Paris Commune]] in 1871, but was rebuilt.  The prison was closed in 1934, and the Conciergerie became a museum. {{sfn|Delon|2000|pages=12–37}}

Several vestiges of the medieval Palais de la Cité, extensively modified and restored, can still be seen today; the royal chapel, [[Sainte-Chapelle]];  the Hall of the Men-at-Arms, (early 14th century), the former dining hall of the palace officials and guards, located underneath the now-vanished Great Hall;  and the four towers along the Seine facing the right bank. The façade was built in the 19th century. The tower on the far right, the Tour Bonbec, is the oldest, built between 1226 and 1270 during the reign of Louis IX, or Saint Louis. It is distinguished by the crenolation at the top of the tower. It originally was a story shorter than the other towers, but was raised to match their height in the renovation of the 19th century. The tower served as the primary torture chamber during the Middle Ages.  The two towers in the center, the Tour de César and the Tour d'Argent, were built in the 14th century, during the reign of [[Philippe le Bel]]. The tallest tower, the Tour de l'Horloge, was constructed by [[Jean le Bon]] in 1350, and modified several times over the centuries. The first public clock in Paris,  was added by Charles V in 1370. The sculptural decoration around the clock, featuring allegorical figures of The Law and Justice, was added in 1585 century by Henry III. {{sfn|Texier|2012|pages=12–13}}

===City walls and castles===

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Much of the architecture of medieval Paris was designed to protect the city and King against attack;  walls, towers, and castles.  Between 1190 and 1202, King [[Philippe-Auguste]] began construction of a wall five kilometers long to protect the city on the right bank. The wall was reinforced by seventy-seven circular towers, each no more than six meters in diameter.  He also began construction of a large castle, the [[Louvre]], where the wall met the river. The Louvre was protected by a moat and a wall with ten towers.  In the center was a massive circular ''donjon'' or tower,  thirty meters high and fifteen meters in diameter.  It was not then the residence of the King, but Philippe Auguste placed the royal archives there.  Another walled complex of buildings, the Temple, the headquarters of the [[Knights Templar]], was located on the right bank, centered around a massive tower. {{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=12–13}}

The city on the right bank continued to grow outwards.  The Provost of the Merchants, [[Étienne Marcel]], began building a new city wall in 1356, which doubled the area of the city.  The Louvre, now surrounded by the city, was given rich decoration and a grand new stairway, and gradually became more of residence than a fortress. [[Charles V of France|Charles V]], in 1364–80, moved his primary residence from the City Palace to the Hôtel Saint-Pol, a comfortable new palace in the new [[Le Marais]] quarter. To protect his new palace and the eastern flank of the city, in 1570 Charles began building the [[Bastille]], a fortress with six cylindrical towers.  At the same time, further east, in the forest of Vincennes, Charles V built an even larger castle, the [[Château de Vincennes]], dominated by another massive keep or tower fifty-two meters high.  It was completed in 1369. Beginning in 1379, close to the Château, he began constructing a replica of Sainte-Chapelle.  Unlike the Sainte-Chapelle in the city, the interior of the Sainte-Chapelle of Vincennes was not divided into two levels; the interior was a single space, flooded with light. {{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=14–15}}

===Churches - the birth of the Gothic Style===

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The style of [[Gothic architecture]] was born in the rebuilding of the chevet of the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]], just outside Paris, finished in 1144. Twenty years later, the style was used on a much larger scale by [[Maurice de Sully]] in the construction of the Cathedral of [[Notre-Dame de Paris]]. The construction continued until the 14th century. beginning with the twin towers on the west toward the choir in the east. The style evolved as the construction continued;  the opening of the rose window on the western façade were relatively narrow;  the great rose windows of the central transept were much more delicate, and allowed in much more light.  At the western end, the walls were supported by buttresses built directly against the walls;  in the center, completed later, the walls were supported by two steps of flying buttresses.  In the last century of construction, the buttresses were able to cross the same distance with a single stone arch.  The towers on the west were more stately and solemn, in the classic Gothic style,  while the eastern elements of the Cathedral, with its combination of rose windows, spires, buttresses and pinnacles, belonged to more elaborate and decorative style, called the Gothic rayonnant. {{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=14–15}}

Other Paris churches soon adapted the Gothic style; the choir of Abbey church of Saint-Germain-des-Prés was completely rebuilt in the new style, with pointed arches and flying buttresses.  The church of [[Saint-Pierre de Montmartre]] was rebuilt with ''ogives'', or gothic pointed arches. The church of Saint-Germain l'Auxerois, next to the Louvre, was given a portal inspired by Notre Dame, and the [[Church of Saint-Séverin]] was given a Gothic nave with the first [[triforium]], or first-story side gallery,  in Paris. The supreme example of the new style was the upper chapel of [[Sainte-Chapelle]], where the walls seemed to be made entirely of stained glass. {{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=14–15}}

The Gothic Style went through another phase between 1400 and about 1550; the [[Flamboyant Gothic]],  which combined extremely refined forms and rich decoration.  The style was used not only in churches, but also in some noble residences. Notable existing examples are the [[Church of Saint-Séverin]] (1489–95) with its famous twisting pillar;  the elegant choir of the church of [[St-Gervais-et-St-Protais]],;  the [[Tour Saint-Jacques]], the flamboyant Gothic vestige of an abby church destroyed during the Revolution;  and the chapel of the residence of the Abbots of Cluny, now the Museum of the Middle Ages. and the ceiling of the Tour Saint-Jean-Sans-Peur, a vestige of the former residence of the Dukes of Burgundy, in the 2nd arrondissement.

===Houses and manors===

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The houses in Paris during the Middle Ages were tall and narrow; usually four or five stories.  They were constructed of wooden beams on a stone foundation, with the walls covered by white plaster, to prevent fires.  There was usually a shop located on the ground floor.  Houses built of stone reserved for the wealthy;  the oldest house in the Paris is considered to be the Maison de Nicolas Flamel, at 51 rue Montmorency in the 3rd arrondissement, built in 1407.  it was not a private residence, but a kind of hostel. Two houses with exposed beams at 13-15 rue François-Miron in the 4th arrondissement, often described as Medieval, were actually built in the 16th and 17th centuries. {{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=22–23}}

While there are no ordinary houses from the Middle Ages, there are several examples of manors built for the nobility and the high clergy.  The [[Tour Jean-sans-Peur]], at 20 rue Étienne-Marcel in the 2nd arrondissement, built in 1409–11, was part of the Hôtel de Burgogne, the Paris residence of the Dukes of Burgundy.  Built by Robert de Helbuterne, It contains a stairway with a magnificent flamboyant gothic ceiling.  The [[Hôtel de Cluny]] residence of the abbots of the Cluny Monastery, now the [[Musée national du Moyen Âge]], or National Museum of the Middle Ages,  (1490–1500), has a typical feature of manors of the period; a stairway in a tower on the exterior of the building, in the courtyard.  It also contains a chapel with a spectacular flamboyant gothic ceiling.  The [[Hôtel de Sens]] was the Paris residence of the Archbishop of Sens, who had authority over the Bishops of Paris. It also featured a separate stairway tower in the courtyard. {{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=22–23}}

The [[Italian Wars]] conducted by [[Charles VIII of France|Charles VIII]] and [[Louis XII of France|Louis XII]], at the end of the 15th and early 16th century were not very successful from a military point of view, had a direct and beneficial effect on the architecture of Paris. The two Kings returned to France with ideas for magnificent public architecture in the new Italian Renaissance style, and brought Italian architects to build them.  A new manual of classical Roman architecture by the Italian [[Serlio]] also had a major effect on the new look of French buildings.  A distinctly French Renaissance style, lavishly using cut stone and lavish ornamental sculpture, developed under [[Henry II of France|Henry II]] after 1539, {{Sfn|Texier|2012|page=26}}

The first structure in Paris in the new style was the old Pont Notre-Dame (1507–12), designed by the Italian architect [[Fra Giocondo]].  It was lined with 68 artfully designed houses, the first example of Renaissance urbanism. King [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] commissioned the next project; a new [[Hôtel de Ville, Paris|Hôtel de Ville]], or city hall, for the city. It was designed by another Italian, [[Domenico da Cortona]], and begun in 1532 but not finished until 1628. The building was burned in 1871 by the [[Paris Commune]], but the central portion was faithfully reconstructed in 1882.  A monumental fountain in the Italian style, the [[Fontaine des Innocents]], was built in 1549 as a tribune for the welcome of the new King, Henry Ii, to the city on June 16, 1549.  It was designed by [[Pierre Lescot]] with sculpture by [[Jean Goujon]], and is the oldest existing fountain in Paris.{{Sfn|Texier|2012|page=24}}

The first Renaissance Palace built in Paris was the [[Château de Madrid]]; it was a large hunting lodge designed by [[Philibert Delorme]] and erected between 1528 and 1552 west of the city in what is now the [[Bois de Boulogne]]. It was combination of both French and Italian Renaissance styles, with a high French-style roof and Italian loggias. It was demolished beginning in 1787, but a fragment can still be senen today in the Trocadero Gardens in the 16th arrondissement.

Under Henry II and his successors, the Louvre was gradually transformed from a medieval fortress into a Renaissance palace.  The architect Pierre Lescot and sculptor Jean Gouchon made the Lescot wing of the Louvre, a masterpiece of combined French and Italian Renaissance art and architecture, on the southeast side of the Cour Carrée of the Louvre (1546–53).  Inside the Louvre, they made the staircase of Henry II (1546–53) and the Salle des Cariatides (1550).  Both French and Italian elements were combined;  the antique orders and paired columns of the Italian renaissance were combined with sculpted medallions and high roofs broken by windows (later known as the Mansard roof), which were characteristic of the French style.{{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=26–27}}

After the accidental death of [[Henry II of France]] in 1559, his widow [[Catherine de' Medici]] (1519–1589) planned a new palace. She sold the medieval [[Hôtel des Tournelles]], where her husband had died, and began building the [[Tuileries Palace]] in using architect [[Philibert de l'Orme]]. During the reign of [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] (1589–1610), the building was enlarged to the south, so it joined the long riverside gallery, the Grande Galerie, which ran all the way to the older [[Louvre Palace]] in the east. {{Sfn|Texier|2012|page=24}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Most of the churches built in Paris in the 16th century are in the traditional [[flamboyant gothic]] style, though some have features borrowed from the Italian Renaissance. The most important Paris church of the Renaissance is [[Saint-Eustache, Paris|Saint-Eustache]], 105 meters long, 44 meters wide and 35 meters high,  which in size and grandeur, approaches that of the Cathedral of Notre-Dame. King Francis I wanted a monument as the centerpiece for the neighborhood of [[Les Halles]], where the main city market was located. The church was designed by the King's favorite architect, [[Domenico da Cortona]], The project was begun in 1519, and construction began in 1532.  The pillars were inspired by the monastery church of Cluny, and the soaring interior is taken from the gothic cathedrals of the 13th century, but Cortona added details and ornament taken from the Italian Renaissance. It was not completed until 1640.{{Sfn|Texier|2012|page=24}}

The other churches of the period follow the more traditional flamboyant gothic models. They include [[Saint-Merri]] (1520–52), with a plan similar to Notre-Dame; [[Saint-Germain l'Auxerrois]], which features impressive flying buttresses;  and the Église Saint-Medard. whose choir was built in beginning in 1550; [[St-Gervais-et-St-Protais]] features a soaring gothic vault in the apse, but also had a transept a more sober classical style inspired by the Renaissance.  (The baroque façade was added in the 17th century).in the  [[Saint-Étienne-du-Mont]] (1510–86), near the modern Pantheon on Mont Sainte-Genevieve, has the only remaining Renaissance [[rood screen]] (1530–35), a magnificent bridge across the center of the church. The flamboyant gothic church of [[Saint-Nicholas-des-Champs, Paris|Saint-Nicholas-des-Champs]] (1559) has a striking Renaissance feature; a portal on right side inspired by designs of [[Philibert Delorme]] for the former royal residence, the Palace of Tournelles in the Marais.{{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=24–25}}

===Houses and hotels===
&lt;gallery mode="packed" heights="200px&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The ordinary Paris house of the Renaissance was little changed from the medieval house; they were four to five stories high, narrow, built on a stone foundation of wood covered with plaster. They usually had a ''pigeon'', or gabled roof.  The two houses at 13-15 rue François Miron (actually built in the 16th or 17th century, but often described as medieval houses) are good examples of the Renaissance house.{{Sfn|Texier|212|pages=22–23}}

Once the French court returned to Paris from the Loire Valley, the nobility and wealthy merchants began to build ''[[Hôtel particulier|hôtels particuliers]]'', or large private residences, mostly in the Marais.  They were built of stone and richly decorated with sculpture.  They were usually built around a courtyard, and separated from the street. The residence was a located between the courtyard and garden. The façade facing the courtyard had the most sculptural decoration;  the façade facing the garden was usually rough stone. The [[Hôtel Carnavalet]] at 23 rue de Sévigné, (1547–49), designed by [[Pierre Lescot]], and decorated with sculpture by [[Jean Goujon]], is the best example of a Renaissance h As the century advanced, the exterior stairways disappeared and the façades became more classical and regular.  A good example of the later style is the [[Hôtel d'Angoulême Lamoignon]], at 24 rue Pavée in the 3rd arrondissement (1585–89), designed by Thibaut Métezeau.{{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=28–29}}

==The 17th century - The Baroque, the dome, and the debut of Classicism==

The architectural style of the French Renaissance continued to dominate in Paris through the Regency of [[Marie de' Medici]].  The end of the wars of religion allowed the continuation of several building projects, such as the expansion of the Louvre, begun in the 16th century but abandoned because of the war.  With the arrival in power Louis XIII and the ministers Richelleu and Mazarin, a new architectural style, the baroque, imported from Italy, began to appear in Paris.  Its purpose, like Baroque music and painting, was to awe Parisians with its majesty and ornament, in opposition to the austere style of the Protestant [[Reformation]]. The new style in Paris was characterized by opulence, irregularity, and an abundance of decoration.  The straight geometric lines of the buildings were covered with curved or triangular ''frontons'', niches with statues or ''cariatides'', ''cartouches'', garlands of drapery, and cascades of fruit carved from stone.

[[Louis XIV]] distrusted the unruly Parisians, and spent as little time as possible in Paris,  finally moving his Court to Versailles in,  but at the same time he wanted to transform Paris into "The New Rome", a city worthy of the Sun King.  Over the course of his long reign, from 1643 until 1715, the architectural style in Paris gradually changed from the exuberance of the baroque to a more solemn and formal classicism, the embodiment in stone of the King's vision of Paris as "the new Rome."   The new Academy of Architecture, founded in 1671,  imposed an official style, as the Academies of art and literature had earlier done. The style was modified again beginning in about 1690, as the government began to run short of money;  new projects were less grandiose.{{sfn|Renault|2006|page=48}}

}}
In the 17th century, the first large-scale urban planning of Paris was initiated by royal ordinance, largely based on the model of Italian cities, including the construction of the first residential squares.  The first two squares, Place Royale (now [[Place des Vosges]], 1605–12) and [[Place Dauphine]], the latter in place of the old royal garden on the Île-de-la-Cité, were both begun by [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]],  who also completed the first Paris bridge without houses, the [[Pont Neuf]] (1599–1604).  The Place Royale had nine large residences on each of its four sides, with identical façades. The Place Dauphine had forty houses on its three sides (of which just two remain today). Louis XIV continued the style with [[Place des Victoires]] (1684–97) and [[Place Vendôme]] (1699–1702).  Both of these squares were (1) designed by [[Jules Hardouin-Mansart]], (2) had statues of the King in the center, and (3) were financed largely by the sale of the houses around the squares.  The residences around the latter two squares had identical classical façades and were built of stone, following Hardouin-Mansart's ''Grand Style'' used in his monumental buildings. The residential squares all had pedestrian arcades on the ground floors, and what became known as a ''mansart'' window breaking the line of the high roof. They set a model for European squares in the [[18th century]].{{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=38–39}}

Urban planning was another important legacy of the 17th century. In 1667 formal height limits were imposed on Paris buildings; 48 ''pieds'' ({{convert|15.6|m|ft}}) for wooden buildings and 50 to 60 ''pieds'' ({{convert|16.25|to|19.50|m|ft}}) for buildings of stone, following earlier rules set in place in 1607.  To prevent fires, the traditional gabled roof was banned. Beginning in 1669, under the new regulations, large blocks of houses of uniform height and uniform façades were built along several Paris streets on the right bank, notably rue de la Ferronnerie (1st arr.), [[rue Saint-Honoré]] (1st arr.), rue du Mail (2nd arr.), and rue Saint-Louis-en-Île on the [[Île Saint-Louis]].  They usually were built of stone and composed of an arched arcade on the ground floor with two to four stories above, the windows separated by decorative columns, and a high roof broken by rows of windows.  This was the birth of the iconic Paris street architecture that dominated for the next two centuries. {{Sfn|Texier|2102|pages=36–37}}

Another element of the new architecture of Paris was the bridge. The [[Pont Neuf]] (1599–1604) and [[Pont Royal]] (1685–89), by engineer François Romain and architect [[Jules Hardouin-Mansart]], were built without the rows of houses that occupied earlier bridges, and were designed to match the grand style of the architecture around them.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
After the assassination of [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] in 1610, his widow, [[Marie de' Medici]], became the regent for the young [[Louis XIII]] and between 1615 and 1631 she built a residence for herself, the [[Luxembourg Palace]], on the left bank.  It was inspired by the palaces of her native Florence, but also by the innovations of the French Renaissance. The architect was [[Salomon de Brosse]], followed by [[Marin de la Vallée]] and [[Jacques Lemercier]].  In the gardens, she built a magnificent fountain, the [[Medici Fountain]], also on the Italian model.

The construction of the Louvre was one of the major Paris architectural projects of the 17th century, and the palace architecture clearly showed the transition from the French Renaissance to the classical style of Louis XIV. [[Jacques Lemercier]] had built the Pavillon de l'Orloge in 1624–39 in an ornate baroque style.  Between 1667 and 1678 [[Louis Le Vau]], [[Charles Le Brun]], [[François d'Orbay]] and [[Claude Perrault]] rebuilt the east exterior façade of the courtyard with a long colonnade.  A competition was held in 1670 for the south façade, which included a proposal from the Italian architect [[Bernini]].  Louis XIV rejected Bernini's Italianate plan in favor of a classical design by Perrault, which had a flat roof concealed by a balustrade and a series of massive columns and triangular pediments designed to convey elegance and power. [[Louis Le Vau]] and [[Claude Perrault]] rebuilt the interior façade of the ''cour Carée'' of the Louvre in a more classical version than that of the facing Renaissance façade. The Louvre was gradually transformed from a Renaissance and baroque palace to the classical ''grand style'' of Louis XIV.{{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=40–41}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Church architecture in the 17th century was slow to change. Interiors of new parish churches, such as [[Church of Saint-Sulpice, Paris|Saint-Sulpice]], [[Saint-Louis-en-l'Île]] and [[Saint-Roch, Paris|Saint-Roch]] largely followed the traditional gothic floor-plan of Notre-Dame,  though they did add façades and certain other decorative features from the Italian Baroque, and follow the advice of the [[Council of Trent]] to integrate themselves into the city's architecture, and they were aligned with the street. In 1675, an official survey on the state of church architecture in Paris made by architects [[Daniel Gittard]] and [[Libéral Bruant]] recommended that certain churches "so-called Gothic, without any good order, beauty or harmony" should be rebuilt "in the new style of our beautiful modern architecture", meaning the style imported from Italy, with certain French adaptations.

The architect [[Salomon de Brosse]] (1571–1626) introduced a new style of façade,  based on the traditional orders of architecture (Doric, Ionic and Corinthian),  placed one above the other.  He first used this style in the façade of the Church of [[St-Gervais-et-St-Protais]] (1616–20).  The style of the three superimposed orders appeared again in the Eglise Saint-Paul-Saint-Louis, the new Jesuit church in Paris, designed by the Jesuit architects [[Étienne Martellange]] and [[François Derand]]. Saint-Roch (1653–90), designed by [[Jacques Lemercier]], had a Gothic plan but colorful Italian-style decoration. {{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=30–31}}

The most dramatic new feature of Paris religious architecture in the 17th century was the [[dome]], which was first imported from Italy in about 1630, and began to change the Paris skyline, which hitherto had been entirely dominated by church spires and bell towers. The domed churches began as a weapon of the Counter-Reformation against the architectural austerity of the Protestants.  The prototype for the Paris domes was the Church of the Jesu, the Jesuit church in Rome, built in 1568–84 by [[Giacomo della Porta]].  A very modest dome was created in Paris between 1608 and 1619 in the chapel of the Louanges on rue Bonaparte.  (Today it is part of the structure of the École des Beaux-Arts).  The first large dome was on the church of Saint-Joseph des Carmes, which was finished in 1630.  Modifications in the traditional religious services, strongly supported by the growing monastic orders in Paris, led to modification in church architecture, with more emphasis on the section in the center of the church, beneath the dome. The circle of clear glass windows of the lower part of the dome filled the church center with light.

The most eloquent early architect of domes was the architect [[François Mansart]].  His first dome was at the chapel of the Minimes (later destroyed), then at the chapel of the Church of the Convent of the Visitation Saint-Marie at 17 rue Saint-Antoine (4th arr.), built between 1632 and 1634.  Now the [[Temple du Marais]], It is the oldest surviving dome in the city. Another appeared on the Eglise-Saint-Joseph in the convent of the Carmes-dechaussés at 70 rue de Vaugirard (6th arr.) between 1628 and 1630. Another dome soon was built in the Marais;  the dome of the Church of [[Saint-Paul-Saint-Louis]] at 899-101 rue Saint-Antoine (1627–41), by [[Étienne Martellange]] and [[François Derand]].  It was followed by church of the Abbey of [[Val-de-Grâce (church)|Val-de-Grâce]] (5th arr.) (1624–69), by Mansart and [[Pierre Le Muet]];  then by a dome on the Chapel of Saint-Ursule at the College of the [[Sorbonne]] (1632–34), by [[Jacques Lemercier]]; and the College des Quatres-Nations (now the [[Institute of France]] (1662–68), by [[Louis LeVau]] and [[François d'Orbay]];  and the church of [[Notre-Dame de l'Assomption de Paris]] on rue Saint-Honoré (1st arr.) (1670–76) by [[Charles Errard]]. The most majestic dome was that of the chapel of [[Les Invalides]], by [[Jules Hardouin-Mansart]], built between 1677 and 1706.  The last dome of the period was for a Protestant church, the Temple de Pentemont on rue de Grenelle  (7th arr.) (about 1700) by [[Charles de La Fosse]]. {{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=44–45}}

===Residential architecture - the rustic style===

&lt;/gallery&gt;
An elegant new form of domestic architecture, the rustic style, appeared in Paris in the wealthy [[Le Marais]] at the end of the 16th and beginning of the 17th century. This style of architecture was usually used for ornate apartments in wealthy areas, and for Hôtel Particuliers. It was sometimes called the "style of three crayons" because it used three colors;  black slate tiles, red brick, and white stone. This architecture was expensive, having a variety of different materials, and ornate stone work. This style inspired the unique [[Palace of Versailles|Palais de Versailles]]. The earliest existing examples are the house known as the ''Maison de Jacques Cœur''at 40 rue des Archives (4th arr.) from the late 16th century; the Hôtel Scipion Sardini at 13 rue Scipion in the (5th arr,) from 1532, and the Abbot's residence at the [[Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés]] at 3-5 rue de l'Abbaye, (6th arr.), from 1586.  The most famous examples around found around the [[Place des Vosges]], built between 1605 and 1612. Other good examples are the Hospital of Saint-Louis on rue Buchat (10th arr.) from 1607 to 1611; the two houses at 1-6 [[Place Dauphine]] on the Île de la Cité, from 1607 to 1612; and the Hôtel d'Alméras at 30 rue des Francs-Bourgeois (4th arr.), from 1612.

===Residences - the classical style===
&lt;gallery mode="packed" heights="200px&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The palatial new residences built by the nobility and the wealthy in the Marais featured two new and original specialized rooms; the dining room and the ''[[Drawing room|salon]]''.  The new residences typically were separated from the street by a wall and gatehouse.  There was a large court of honor inside the gates, with galleries on either side, used for receptions, and for services and the stables. The house itself opened both onto the courtyard and onto a separate garden.  One good example in its original form, between the Place des Vosges and rue Saint-Antoine,  is the [[Hôtel de Sully]], (1624–29), built by [[Jean Androuet du Cerceau]]. {{sfn|Renault|2006|page=52}}

After 1650 the architect [[François Mansart]] introduced a more classical and sober style to the hôtel particular. The Hôtel de Guénégaud des Brosses at 60 rue des Archives (3rd arrondissement) from 1653 had a greatly simplified and severe façade. Beginning in the 1660s Mansart remade the façades of the [[Hôtel Carnavalet]], preserving some of the Renaissance decoration and a 16th portal but integrating them into a more classical composition, with columns, pediments and stone ''bossages''.

==The 18th century – The triumph of neoclassicism==

&lt;/gallery&gt;
During the first half of the 18th century, the grand style of Louis XIV, defined by the Royal Academy of Architecture and evoking power and grandeur, dominated Paris architecture.  In 1722, Louis XV returned the court to Versailles, and visited the city only on special occasions.&lt;ref&gt;Sarmant, Thierry, ''’Histoire de Paris'', pp. 117–118&lt;/ref&gt;  While he rarely came into Paris, he did make important additions to the city's landmarks. His first major building was the ''[[École Militaire]]'', a new military school, on the Left Bank. It was built between 1739 and 1745 by [[Ange-Jacques Gabriel]].  Gabriel borrowed the design of the Pavillon d'Horloge of the Louvre by Lemercier for the central pavilion, a façade influenced by Mansart, and Italian touches from [[Palladio]] and [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi]]. {{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=58–59}}

In the second part of the century,  a more purely neoclassical style, based directly on Greek and Roman models, began to appear. It was strongly influenced by a visit to Rome in 1750 by the architect [[Jacques-Germain Soufflot]] and the future Marquis de Marigny, the director of buildings for King [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]].  They and other architects who made the obligatory trip to Italy brought back classical ideas and drawings which defined Paris architecture until the 1830s.{{Sfn|Texier|2012|page=60}}
 
Soufflot's Roman trip led to the design of the new church of Saint Genevieve, now the [[Panthéon]], the model of the neoclassical style, constructed on the summit of Mont Geneviéve between 1764 and 1790.  It was not completed until the [[French Revolution]], at which time it became a mausoleum for Revolutionary heroes. Other royal commissions in the new style included the royal mint,  the [[Hôtel des Monnaies, Paris|Hotel des Monnaies]] on the Quai de Conti (6th arr.), with a 117-meter-long façade along the Seine, dominated by its massive central ''Avant-corps'' and vestibule decorated with doric columns and caisson ceilings (1767–75).

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Churches in the first half of the 18th century, such as the church of Saint-Roche at 196 rue Saint-Honoré (1738–39) by [[Robert de Cotte]] and [[Jules-Robert de Cotte]],  stayed with the late baroque style of superimposed orders. Later churches ventured into neoclassicism, at least on the exterior.  The most prominent example of a neoclassical church was the Church of Saint Genevieve (1764–90), the future Pantheon. The church of Saint-Philippe-du-Roule at 153 rue du Faubourg-Saint-Honoré (8th arr.) (1764–84) by [[Jean-François Chalgrin]] had an exterior inspired by the early Paleo-Christian church, though the nave in the interior was more traditional.  The Church of [[Church of Saint-Sulpice, Paris|Saint-Sulpice]] in the 6th arrondissement, by Jean-Nicolas Servandont, then by Oudot de Maclaurin and Jean-François Chalgrin was given a classical façade and two bell towers (1732–80).  Funding was exhausted before the second tower was finished, leaving the two towers different in style. The church of Saint-Eustache on rue-du-Jour (1st arr.) an example of both Gothic and Renaissance architecture, had its west faced redone by [[Jean Hardouin-Mansart]] and then [[Pierre-Louis Moreau-Desproux]], into a neoclassical façade with two orders (1754–78), and was intended to have two towers, but only one was finished. {{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=52–53}}

A large church with a dome, similar to Les Invalides,  had been planned for the [[Place de la Madeleine]] beginning in the 1760s. the King laid the cornerstone on April 3, 1763, but work halted in 1764.  The architect, [[Pierre Contant d'Ivry]], died in 1777,  and was replaced by his pupil Guillaume-Martin Couture, who decided instead to base his church on the [[Pantheon, Rome|Roman Pantheon]];  a classic colonnade topped by a massive dome. At the start of the [[French Revolution|Revolution of 1789]], however, only the foundations and the grand portico had been finished.

===Regency and Louis XV residential architecture===

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The Regency and then the rule of [[Louis XV]] saw a gradual evolution of the style of the ''hôtel particular'', or mansion. The ornate wrought-iron balcony appeared on residences, along with other ornamental details called [[rocaille]] or [[rococo]], often borrowed from Italy. The style first appeared on houses in the Marais, then in the neighborhoods of Saint-Honoré and Saint-Germain, where larger building lots were available. These became the most fashionable neighborhoods by the end of the 18th century. The new hôtels were often ornamented with curve façades, rotundas and lateral pavilions, and had their façades decorated with sculpted ''mascarons'' fruit, cascades of trophies and other sculptural decoration.  The interiors were richly decorated with carved wood panels. The houses usually looked out onto courtyards on the front and gardens to the rear. The Hôtel de Chenizot, 51 rue Saint-Louis-en-Ile, by Pierre-Vigné de Vigny (about 1720), was a good example of the new style; it was a 17th-century house transformed by a new rocaille façade. {{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=54–55}}

===Urbanism – the Place de la Concorde===

&lt;/gallery&gt;
In 1748, the Academy of Arts commissioned a monumental statue of the king on horseback by the sculptor [[Bouchardon]], and the Academy of Architecture was assigned to create a square, to be called ''Place Louis XV'', where it could be erected. The site selected was the marshy open space between the Seine, the moat and bridge to the Tuileries garden, and the [[Champs-Élysées]], which led to the ''Étoile'', convergence of hunting trails on the western edge of the city (now ''[[Place Charles de Gaulle|Place Charles de Gaulle-Étoile]]''). The winning plans for the square and buildings next to it were drawn by the architect [[Ange-Jacques Gabriel]]. Gabriel designed two large ''hôtels'' with a street between them, [[Rue Royale, Paris|''Rue Royale'']], designed to give a clear view of the statue in the center of the square.  The façades of the two hotels, with long colonnades and classical pediments, were inspired by Perrault's neoclassical façade of the Louvre. Construction began in 1754, and the statue was put in place and dedicated on 23 February 1763. The two large  ''hôtels'' were still unfinished, but the ''façades'' were finished in 1765–66. The Place was the theater for some of the most dramatic events of the [[French Revolution]], including the executions of [[Louis XVI]] and [[Marie Antoinette]].  {{sfn|Antoine|1989|pages=556–557}}

===Urbanism under Louis XVI===
The later part of the 18th century saw the development of new residential blocks, particularly on the left bank at Odéon and Saint-Germain, and on the right bank in the first and second arrondissements.  The most fashionable neighborhoods moved from the Marais toward the west. with large residential buildings constructed in a simplified and harmonious neoclassical style. The ground floors were often occupied by arcades to give pedestrians shelter from the rain and the traffic in the streets.  Strict new building regulations were put into place in 1783 and 1784, which regulated the height of new buildings in relation to the width of the street, regulating the line of the cornice, the number of stories and the slope of the roofs.  Under a 1784 decree of the Parlement of Paris, the height of most new buildings was limited to 54 ''pieds'' or 17.54 meters, with the height of the attic depending upon the width of the building.{{Sfn|Texier|2012|page=66}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Paris in the 18th century had many beautiful buildings, but it was not a beautiful city. The philosopher [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] described his disappointment when he first arrived in Paris in 1731: 
I expected a city as beautiful as it was grand, of an imposing appearance, where you saw only superb streets, and palaces of marble and gold. Instead, when I entered by the Faubourg Saint-Marceau, I saw only narrow, dirty and foul-smelling streets, and villainous black houses, with an air of unhealthiness; beggars, poverty; wagons-drivers, menders of old garments; and vendors of tea and old hats."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel Roche|title=The People of Paris: An Essay in Popular Culture in the 18th Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ct-vURCb2BYC&amp;pg=PA10|year=1987|publisher=U. of California Press|page=10|accessdate=2016-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1749, in ''Embellissements de Paris'', [[Voltaire]] wrote: "We blush with shame to see the public markets, set up in narrow streets, displaying their filth, spreading infection, and causing continual disorders… Immense neighbourhoods need public places. The center of the city is dark, cramped, hideous, something from the time of the most shameful barbarism."{{sfn|Sarmant|2012|page=133}}

The uniform neoclassical style all around the city was not welcomed by everyone.  Just before the Revolution the journalist [[Louis-Sébastien Mercier]] wrote: "How monotonous is the genius of our architects! How they live on copies, on eternal repetition! They don't know how to make the smallest building without columns… They all more or less resemble temples."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Louis-Sébastien Mercier|title=Paris: Including a Description of the Principal Edifices and Curiosities of that Metropolis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uIceJv8ct40C&amp;pg=PA21|year=1817|page=21|accessdate=2016-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even functional buildings were built in the neoclassical style; the grain market (now the Chamber of Commerce) was given a neoclassical dome (1763–69) by [[Nicolas Le Camus de Mézières]].  Between 1785 and 1787, the royal government built a new wall around the edges of the city (The [[Wall of the Ferme générale]]) to prevent smuggling of goods into the city. it had fifty-five barriers, many of them in the form of Doric temples, designed by [[Claude Nicolas Ledoux]]. A few still exist, notably at [[Parc Monceau]]. The wall was highly unpopular and was an important factor in turning opinion against Louis XVI, and provoking the French Revolution.

In 1774 Louis XV had constructed a monumental fountain, the [[Fontaine des Quatre-Saisons]], richly decorated with classical sculpture by [[Bouchardon]] glorifying the King, at 57–59 rue de la Grenelle. While the fountain was huge, and dominated the narrow street, it originally had only two small spouts, from which residents of the neighborhood could fill their water containers. It was criticized by [[Voltaire]] in a letter to the Count de Caylus in 1739, as the fountain was still under construction:

{{quote|I have no doubt that Bouchardon will make of this fountain a fine piece of architecture; but what kind of fountain has only two faucets where the water porters will come to fill their buckets? This isn't the way fountains are built in Rome to beautify the city. We need to lift ourselves out of taste that is gross and shabby. Fountains should be built in public places, and viewed from all the gates. There isn't a single public place in the vast [[faubourg Saint-Germain]]; that makes my blood boil. Paris is like [[Daniel 2|the statue of Nabuchodonosor]], partly made of gold and partly made of muck.&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Voltaire to Caylus, extract published in A. Roserot (1902), cited by Rabreau, pg. 99.Translation by D.R Siefkin.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
During the French Revolution, the churches of Paris were closed and nationalized, and many were badly damaged.  Most destruction came not from the Revolutionaries, but from the new owners who purchased the buildings, and sometimes destroyed them for the building materials they contained.  The Abbey of Saint-Pierre de Montmartre was destroyed, and its church left in ruins. Parts of the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés were turned into a gunpowder factory;  an explosion destroyed many of the buildings outside the church. The Church of Saint-Genevieve was turned into a mausoleum for revolutionary heroes.  The sculpture on the façade of the Cathedral of Notre-Dame was smashed or removed, and the spire torn down. Many of the abandoned religious buildings, particularly in outer neighborhoods of the city, were turned into factories and workshops.  Much of the architecture of the Revolution was theatrical and temporary, such as the extraordinary stage sets created for the [[Festival of the Supreme Being]] on the Champs-de-Mars in 1794.  However, work continued on some pre-revolutionary projects.  The rue des Colonnes in the second arrondissement, designed by Nicolas-Jacques-Antoine Vestier (1793–95), had a colonnade of simple Doric columns, characteristic of the Revolutionary period. {{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=66–67}}

===Monuments===
In 1806, in imitation of Ancient Rome, Napoléon ordered the construction of a series of monuments dedicated to the military glory of France. The first and largest was the [[Arc de Triomphe]], built at the edge of the city at the Barrière d'Étoile, and not finished before July 1836. He ordered the building of the smaller [[Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel]] (1806–08), copied from the arch of [[Arch of Septimius Severus]] and Constantine in Rome, next to the Tuileries Palace. It was crowned with a team of bronze horses he took from the façade of [[St Mark's Basilica]] in [[Venice]].  His soldiers celebrated his victories with grand parades around the Carrousel. He also commissioned the building of the [[Place Vendôme|Vendôme Column]] (1806–10), copied from the [[Trajan's Column]] in Rome, made of the iron of cannon captured from the Russians and Austrians in 1805. At the end of the Rue de la Concorde (given again its former name of Rue Roya on 27 April 1814), he took the foundations of an unfinished church, the [[La Madeleine, Paris|Église de la Madeleine]], which had been started in 1763, and transformed it into the Temple de la Gloire, a military shrine to display the statues of France’s most famous generals.

Many of Napoleon's contributions to Paris architecture were badly needed improvements to the city's infrastructure; He started a new canal to bring drinking water to the city, rebuilt the city sewers, and began construction of the Rue de Rivoli, to permit the easier circulation of traffic between the east and west of the city.&lt;ref name="Villefosse, René p. 303"&gt;Héron de Villefosse, René, ‘’Histoire de Paris’’, p. 303&lt;/ref&gt; He also began construction of the [[Paris Bourse|Palais de la Bourse]] (1808–26), the Paris stock market, with its grand colonnade.  it was not finished until 1826.  In 1806 He began to build a new façade for the [[Palais Bourbon]], the modern National Assembly, to match the colonnade of the Temple of Military Glory (now the Madeleine),  directly facing it across the Place de La Concorde. {{Sfn|2012|Texier|pages=68–69}}

===The Egyptian style===

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Parisians had a taste for the Egyptian style long before Napoleon;  pyramids, obelisks and sphinxes occurred frequently in Paris decoration, such as the decorative sphinxes decorating the balustrade of the Hotel Sale (now the [[Musée Picasso]]), (1654–59), and small pyramids decorating the Anglo-Chinese gardens of the [[Château de Bagatelle]] and [[Parc Monceau]] in the (18th century). However, Napoleon's Egyptian campaign gave the style a new prestige, and for the first time it was based on drawings and actual models carried back the scholars who traveled with Napoleon's soldiers to Egypt; the style soon appeared in public fountains and residential architecture, including the [[Fontaine du Fellah]] on rue de Sèvres by [[François-Jean Bralle]]  (1807) and the [[Fontaine du Palmier]] by Bralle and Louis Simon Boizot (1808). The sphinxes around this fountain were Second-Empire additions in 1856–58 by the city architect of Napoleon III, [[Gabriel Davioud]].  The grandest Egyptian element added to Paris was the [[Luxor Obelisk]] from the Temple of Thebes, offered as a gift by the Viceroy of Egypt to Louis-Philippe, and erected on the [[Place de la Concorde]] in 1836.  Examples continued to appear in the 20th century, from the Luxor movie palace on boulevard de Magenta in the 10th arrondissement (1921)  to the Louvre pyramid by [[I. M. Pei]] (1988). {{Sfn|Texier|2012|page=64}}

===The debut of iron architecture===
Iron architecture made its Paris debut under Napoleon, with the construction of the [[Pont des Arts]] by Louis-Alexandre de Cessart and Jacques Lacroix-Dillon (1801–03).  This was followed by a metal frame for the cupola of the Halle aux blé, or grain market (now the Paris [[Bourse de commerce (Paris)|Bourse de Commerce]], or Chamber of Commerce).  Designed by the architect [[François-Joseph Bélanger]] and the engineer François Brunet (1811). It replaced the wooden-framed dome built by [[Nicolas Le Camus de Mézières]]  in 1767, which burned in 1802.  It was the first iron frame used in a Paris building. {{Sfn|Texier|2012|page=98}}

===Public buildings and monuments===
The royal government restored the symbols of the old regime, but continued the construction of most of the monuments and urban projects begun by Napoleon. All of the public buildings and churches of the Restoration were built in a relentlessly [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] style.  Work resumed, slowly, on the unfinished [[Arc de Triomphe]], begun by Napoleon.  At the end of the reign of Louis XVIII,  the government decided to transform it from a monument to the victories of Napoleon into a monument celebrating the victory of the Duke of Angôuleme over the Spanish revolutionaries who had overthrown their Bourbon king. A new inscription was planned: "To the Army of the Pyrenees"  but the inscription had not been carved and the work was still not finished when the regime was toppled in 1830. {{sfn|Héron de Villefosse|1958|page=313}}

The [[Canal Saint-Martin]] was finished in 1822, and the building of the [[Bourse de Paris]], or stock market, designed and begun by [[Alexandre-Théodore Brongniart]] from 1808 to 1813, was modified and completed by [[Éloi Labarre]] in 1826. New storehouses for grain near the Arsenal, new slaughterhouses, and new markets were finished. Three new suspension bridges were built over the Seine;  the Pont d'Archeveché,  the Pont des Invalides and footbridge of the Grève.  All three were rebuilt later in the century.

===Religious architecture===
The church of [[La Madeleine, Paris|La Madeleine]], begun under Louis XVI, had been turned by Napoleon into the Temple of Glory (1807).  It was now turned back to its original purpose, as the Royal church of [[La Madeleine, Paris|La Madeleine]].  To commemorate the memory of [[Louis XVI]] and [[Marie Antoinette]] to expiate the crime of their execution,  King Louis XVIII built the [[Chapelle expiatoire]] designed by [[Pierre-François-Léonard Fontaine]] in a neoclassical style similar to the Paris Pantheon.on the site of the small cemetery of the Madeleine, where their remains (now in the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]]) had been hastily buried following their execution. It was completed and dedicated in 1826.

Several new churches were begun during the Restoration to replace those destroyed during the Revolution. A battle took place between architects who wanted a neogothic style, modeled after Notre-Dame, or the neoclassical style, modeled after the basilicas of ancient Rome.  The battle was won by a majority of neoclassicists on the Commission of Public Buildings, who dominated until 1850. [[Jean Chalgrin]] had designed Saint-Philippe de Role before the Revolution in a neoclassical style; it was completed (1823–30) by [[Étienne-Hippolyte Godde]]. Godde also completed Chalgrin's project for Saint-Pierre-du-Gros-Caillou {1822–29), and built the neoclassic basilicas of Notre-Dame-du-Bonne Nouvelle ((1823–30) and Saint-Denys-du-Saint-Sacrament (1826–35). {{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=84–85}}  Other notable neoclassical architects of the Restoration included [[Louis-Hippolyte Lebas]], who built [[Notre-Dame-de-Lorette, Paris|Notre-Dame-de-Lorette]] (1823–36); (1823–30); and [[Jacques Ignace Hittorff]], who built the church of [[Saint-Vincent-de-Paul, Paris|Church of Saint-Vincent-de-Paul]] (1824–44).  Hittorff went on to along a brilliant career in the reigns of Louis Philippe and Napoleon III, designing the new plan of the Place de la Concorde and constructing the [[Gare du Nord]] railway station (1861–66). {{sfn|Sarmant|2012|page163}}

===Commercial architecture - the shopping gallery===
[[File:Galerie of the Palais Royal - interior, 1831.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Galerie d'Orleans at the [[Palais-Royal]] (1818–29), a shopping arcade covered with a glass roof, by [[Pierre-François-Léonard Fontaine]]]]
A new form of commercial architecture had appeared at the end of the 18th century; the passage, or shopping gallery, a row of shops along a narrow street covered by a glass roof. They were made possible by improved technologies of glass and cast iron, and were popular since few Paris streets had sidewalks and pedestrians had to compete with wagons, carts, animals and crowds of people.  The first indoor shopping gallery in Paris had opened at the [[Palais-Royal]] in 1786;  rows of shops, along with cafes and the first restaurants,  were located under the arcade around the garden.  It was followed by the passage Feydau in 1790–91,  the passage du Caire in 1799, and the [[Passage des Panoramas]] in 1800.{{sfn|Fierro|2003|page=36}}   In 1834 the architect [[Pierre-François-Léonard Fontaine]] carried the idea a step further, covering an entire courtyard of the Palais-Royal, the Galerie d'Orleans, with a glass skylight. The gallery remained covered until 1935.  It was the ancestor of the glass skylights of the Paris department stores of the later 19th century. {{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=70–71}}

===Residential architecture===
[[File:Square d'Orléans.jpg|thumb|right|200px|English neoclassical house in the [[Square d'Orleans]] (1829–35) by [[Edward Cresy]]]] 
During the Restoration, and particularly after the coronation of King [[Charles X]] in 1824.  New residential neighborhoods were built on the Right Bank, as the city grew to the north and west.  Between 1824 and 1826, a time of economic prosperity, the quarters of Saint-Vincent-de-Paul, Europe, Beaugrenelle and Passy were all laid out and construction began.  The width of lots grew larger;  from six to eight meters wide for a single house to between twelve and twenty meters for a residential building. The typical new residential building was four to five stories high, with an attic roof sloping forty-five degrees, broken by five to seven windows.  The decoration was largely adapted from that of the Rue de Rivoli;  horizontal rather than vertical orders, and simpler decoration. The windows were larger and occupied a larger portion of the façades.  Decoration was provided by ornamental iron shutters and then wrought-iron balconies. Variations of this model were the standard on Paris boulevards until the Second Empire. {{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=74–75}}

The hôtel particular, or large private house of the Restoration, usually was built in a neoclassical style, based on Greek architecture or the style of [[Palladio]], particularly in the new residential quarters of Nouvelle Athenes and the Square d'Orleans on Rue Taibout (9th arrondissement), a private residential square (1829–35) in the English neoclassical style designed by Edward Cresy.  Residents of the square included [[George Sand]] and [[Frédéric Chopin]].  Some of the houses in the new quarters in the 8th arrondissement, particularly the quarter of François I, begun in 1822,  were made in a more picturesque style, a combination of the Renaissance and classical style, called the ''Troubadour'' style. This marked the beginning of the movement away from uniform neoclassicism toward eclectic residential architecture.{{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=74–75}}

===Monuments and public squares===
The architectural style of public buildings under the Restoration and Louis-Philippe was determined by the ''Academie des Beaux-Arts'', or Academy of Fine Arts, whose Perpetual Secretary from 1816 to 1839 was [[Quatremère de Quincy]], a confirmed neoclassicist. The architectural style of public buildings and monuments was intended to associate Paris with the virtues and glories of ancient Greece and Rome, as it had been under Louis XIV, Napoleon and the Restoration. {{Sfn|Renault|2006|page=104}}

The first great architectural project of the reign of [[Louis-Philippe]] was the remaking of the [[Place de la Concorde]] into its modern form.  The moats of the Tuileries were filled,  two large fountains, one representing the maritime commerce and industry of France, the other the river commerce and great rivers of France, designed by [[Jacques Ignace Hittorff]], were put in place, along with monumental sculptures representing the major cities of France.&lt;ref&gt;*Beatrice de Andia (editor), ''Paris et ses Fontaines, de la Renaissance a nos jours'', Collection Paris et son Patrimoine, Paris, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;  On 25 October 1836, a new centerpiece was put in place; a stone [[Luxor Obelisk|obelisk]] from [[Luxor]], weighing two hundred fifty tons, brought on a specially built ship from [[Egypt]], was slowly hoisted into place in the presence of Louis-Philippe and a huge crowd. {{sfn|Héron de Villefosse|1959|page=325}}  In the same year, the ''Arc de Triomphe'', begun in 1804 by Napoleon, was finally completed and dedicated. Following the return to Paris of the [[Retour des cendres|ashes of Napoleon]] from [[Saint Helena]] in 1840, they were placed with great ceremony in a tomb designed by [[Louis Visconti]] beneath the church of [[Les Invalides]].  Another Paris landmark, the [[July Column|column]] on the [[Place de la Bastille]], was inaugurated on 28 July 1840, on the anniversary of the July Revolution, and dedicated to those killed during the uprising.

Several older monuments were put to new purposes: the [[Élysée Palace]] was purchased by the French state and became an official residence, and under late governments the residence of the Presidents of the French Republic. The Basilica of Sainte-Geneviève, originally built as a church, then, during the Revolution, made into a mausoleum for great Frenchmen, then a church again during the Restoration, once again became the [[Panthéon]],  holding the tombs of great Frenchmen.

===Preservation and restoration===
The reign of Louis-Philippe saw the beginning of a movement to preserve and restore some of the earliest landmarks of Paris, inspired in large part by Victor Hugo's hugely successful novel ''[[The Hunchback of Notre-Dame]]'' (''Notre-Dame de Paris''), published in 1831. The leading figure of the restoration movement was [[Prosper Mérimée]], named by Louis-Philippe as the inspector General of [[Monument historique|Historic Monuments]].  The Commission of Public Monument was created in 1837, and in 1842, Mérimée began compiling the first official list of classified historical monuments, now known as the [[Base Mérimée]].

The first structure to be restored was the nave of the [[Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés|church of Saint-Germain-des-Prés]], the oldest in the city. Work also began in 1843 on the cathedral of Notre Dame, which had been badly damaged during the Revolution, and stripped of the statues on its façade. Much of the work was directed by the architect and historian [[Viollet-le-Duc]] who, sometimes, as he admitted, was guided by his own scholarship of the "spirit" of [[Middle Ages|medieval]] architecture, rather strict historical accuracy. The other major restorations projects were [[Sainte-Chapelle]] and the Hôtel de Ville, dating to the 17th century; the old buildings which pressed up against the back of the Hôtel de Ville were cleared away; two new wings were added, the interiors were lavishly redecorated, and the ceilings and walls of the large ceremonial salons were painted with murals by [[Eugène Delacroix]]. Unfortunately, all the interiors were burned in 1871 by the [[Paris Commune]].{{sfn|Héron de Villefosse|1959|page=325}}

===The Beaux-Arts style===
&lt;gallery mode="packed" heights=200px&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
At the same time, a small revolution was taking place at the [[École des Beaux-Arts]], led by four young architects; [[Joseph-Louis Duc]], [[Félix Duban]], [[Henri Labrouste]] and [[Léon Vaudoyer]], who had first studied Roman and Greek architecture at the Villa Medici in Rome, then in the 1820s began the systematic study of other historic architectural styles; including French architecture of the Middle Ages and Renaissance. They instituted teaching about a variety of architectural styles at the École des Beaux-Arts,  and installed fragments of Renaissance and Medieval buildings in the courtyard of the school so students could draw and copy them. Each of them also designed new non-classical buildings in Paris inspired by a variety of different historic styles; Labrouste built the [[Sainte-Geneviève Library]] (1844–50);  Duc designed the new [[Palais de Justice, Paris|Palais de Justice]] and [[Court of Cassation (France)|Court of Cassation]] on the Île-de-la-Cité (1852–68); and Vaudroyer designed the [[Conservatoire national des arts et métiers]] (1838–67), and Duban designed the new buildings of the École des Beaux-Arts. Together, these buildings, drawing upon Renaissance, Gothic and romanesque and other non-classical styles, broke the monopoly of neoclassical architecture in Paris. {{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=76–77}}

===The first train stations===
[[File:Victor Hubert - Paris-Saint Germain Railway 1837.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The first Paris train station, on the site of the modern [[Gare Saint-Lazare]] (1837)]]
The first train stations in Paris were called ''embarcadéres'' (a term used for water traffic), and their location was a source of great contention, as each railroad line was owned by a different company, and each went in a different direction. The first ''embarcadére'' was built by the [[Péreire brothers]] for the line Paris-Saint-Germain-en-Laye, at the [[Place de l'Europe]]. It opened on 26 August 1837, and with its success was quickly replaced by a larger building on rue de Stockholm, and then an even larger structure, the beginning of the [[Gare Saint-Lazare]], built between 1841 and 1843. It was the station for the trains to Saint-Germain-en-Laye, Versailles and Rouen.

The Péreire brothers argued that Gare Saint-Lazare should be the unique station of Paris, but the owners of the other lines each insisted on having their own station. The first ''Gare d'Orléans'', now known as the ''[[Gare d'Austerlitz]]'', was opened on 2 May 1843, and was greatly expanded in 1848 and 1852. The first [[Gare Montparnasse]] opened on 10 September 1840 on ''avenue du Maine'', and was the terminus of the new Paris-Versailles line on the left bank of the Seine. It was quickly found to be too small, and was rebuilt between 1848 and 1852 at the junction of rue de Rennes and boulevard du Montparnasse, its present location. {{sfn|Fierro|1996|pages=900–901}}

The banker [[James Mayer de Rothschild]] received the permission of the government to build the first railroad line from Paris to the Belgian border in 1845, with branch lines to [[Calais]] and [[Dunkerque]]. The first ''embarcadére'' of the new line opened on ''rue de Dunkerque'' in 1846. It was replaced by a much grander station, [[Gare du Nord]], in 1854. The first station of the line to eastern France, the [[Gare de l'Est]] was begun in 1847, but not finished until 1852. Construction of a new station for the line to the south, from Paris to [[Montereau-Fault-Yonne]] began in 1847 and was finished in 1852. In 1855 it was replaced by a new station, the first [[Gare de Lyon]], on the same site. {{sfn|Fierro|1996|pages=900–901}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The rapidly growing French economy under [[Napoleon III]] led to major changes in the architecture and urban design of Paris. New types of architecture connected with the economic expansion;  railroad stations, hotels, office buildings, department stores and exposition halls, occupied the center of Paris, which previously had been largely residential. To improve traffic circulation and bring light and air to the center of the city,  Napoleon's Prefect of the Seine, destroyed the crumbling and overcrowded neighborhoods in the heart of the city and built a network of grand boulevards. The expanded use of new building materials, especially iron frames, allowed the construction of much larger buildings for commerce and industry. {{Sfn|Renault|2006|page=101}}

When he declared himself Emperor in 1852, Napoleon III moved his residence from the [[Élysée Palace]] to the [[Tuileries Palace]], where his uncle Napoleon I had lived, adjoining the Louvre.  He continued the construction of the [[Louvre]], following the grand design of Henry IV;  he built the Pavillon Richelieu (1857), the guichets of the Louvre (1867), and rebuilt the Pavillon de Flore;  he broke with the neo-classicism of the wings of the Louvre built by Louis XIV; the new constructions were perfectly in harmony with the Renaissance wings. {{Sfn|Texier|2012|page=48}}

The dominant architectural style of the Second Empire was the eclectic, drawing liberally from the architecture of the Gothic style, Renaissance style, and style of Louis XV and Louis XVI. The best example was the [[Opéra Garnier]],  begun in 1862 but not finished until 1875.  The architect was [[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]] (1825–1898), who won the competition against a Gothic-revival style by [[Viollet-le-Duc]]. When asked by the Empress Eugenie what the style of the building was called, he replied simply "Napoleon III."   It was at the time the largest theater in the world, but much of the interior space was devoted to purely decorative spaces; grand stairways, huge foyers for promenading, and large private boxes.  The façade was decorated with seventeen different materials, marble, stone, [[Porphyry (geology)|porphyry]] and bronze. Other notable examples of Second Empire public architecture include the [[Palais de Justice, Paris|Palais de Justice]] and the [[Court of Cassation (France)|Court of Cassation]] by [[Joseph-Louis Duc]] (1862–68); the Tribunal de Commerce by [[Antoine-Nicolas Bailly]] (1860–65), and the [[Théâtre du Châtelet]] by [[Gabriel Davioud]] (1859–62) and Theater de la Ville, facing each other on Place du Châtelet.

The Second Empire also saw the restoration of the famed stained glass windows and structure of [[Sainte-Chapelle]] by [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc]]; and extensive restoration of  [[Notre-Dame de Paris]].  Later critics complained that some of the restoration was more imaginative than precisely historical.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The map and look of Paris changed dramatically under Napoleon III and Baron Haussmann. Haussmann demolished the narrow streets and crumbling medieval houses in the center of the city (including the house where he was born) and replaced them with wide boulevards lined by large residential buildings, all of the same height (Twenty meters to the cornice, or five stories on boulevards and four on narrower streets), with façades in the same style, and faced with the same cream-colored stone.  He completed the east-west axis of the city center, the [[Rue de Rivoli]] begun by Napoleon, built a new North-south axis, Boulevard de Sébastopol, and cut wide boulevards on both the right and left banks, including the [[Boulevard Saint-Germain]], [[Boulevard Saint-Michel]], usually culminating in a domed landmark. if a dome was not already there, Haussmann had one built, as he did with the Tribunal de Commerce and the Church of Saint-Augustin.

The centerpiece of the new design was the new Paris Opera, designed by [[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]].  In the latter years of the Empire, he built new boulevards to connect the city center with the eight new arrondissements which Napoleon III attached to the city in 1860, along with new city halls for each arrondissement. New city halls were also built for many of the original arrondissements.  The new city hall of the First arrondissement by [[Jacques Ignace Hittorff]] (1855–60), close the medieval church of Saint-Germain-Auxerois the historic center of the city.  The new city hall was in neo-Gothic style, echoing the medieval church, complete with a rose window.  A neo-Gothic bell tower by [[Théodore Ballu]]  (1862),

To provide green space and recreation for the residents of the outer neighborhoods of the city,  Haussmann built large new parks [[Bois de Boulogne]], [[Bois de Vincennes]], [[Parc Montsouris]] and [[Parc des Buttes Chaumont]] to the west, east, north and south, filled with picturesque garden follies, as well as numerous smaller parks and squares where the new boulevards met. City architect [[Gabriel Davioud]] devoted considerable attention to the details of the city infrastructure. Haussmann also built a new water supply and sewer system under the new boulevards, planted thousands of trees along the boulevards, and ornamented the parks and boulevards with kiosks, gateways, lodges and ornamental grills, all designed by Davioud.{{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=90=91}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Religious architecture finally broke away from the neoclassical style which had dominated Paris church architecture since the 18th century.  Neo-Gothic and other historical styles began to be built, particularly in the eight new arrondissements farther from the center added by Napoleon III in 1860. The first neo-Gothic church was the [[Sainte-Clotilde, Paris|Basilica of Sainte-Clothilde]], begun by Christian Gau in 1841, finished by [[Théodore Ballu]] in 1857.  During the Second Empire, architects began to use metal frames combined with the Gothic style;  the Eglise Saint-Laurent, a 15th-century church rebuilt in Neo-Gothic style by Simon-Claude-Constant Dufeux (1862–65), and [[Église Saint-Eugène-Sainte-Cécile|Saint-Eugene-Sainte-Cecile]] by Louis-Auguste Boileau and Adrien-Louis Lusson (1854–55);   and Saint-Jean-Baptiste de Belleville by Jean-Bapiste Lassus (1854–59).  The largest new church built in Paris during the Second Empire was [[Saint-Augustin, Paris|Church of Saint Augustine]] (1860–71), by [[Victor Baltard]], the designer of the metal pavilions of the market of [[Les Halles]]. While the structure was supported by cast-iron columns, the façade was eclectic.{{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=78–79}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The industrial revolution and economic expansion of Paris required much larger structures, particularly for railroad stations, which were considered the new ornamental gateways to the city. The new structures had iron skeletons, but they were concealed by Beaux-Arts façades. The [[Gare du Nord]], by [[Jacques Ignace Hittorff]] (1842–65), had a glass roof with iron columns thirty-eight meters high, while the façade was in the beaux-arts style faced with stone and decorated with statues representing the cities served by the railway.

The most dramatic use of iron and glass was in the new central market of Paris, [[Les Halles]] (1853–70), an ensemble of huge iron and glass pavilions designed by [[Victor Baltard]] (1805–1874).
[[Henri Labrouste]] (1801–1875)  used iron and glass to create a dramatic cathedral-like reading room for the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]], site Richelieu (1854–75). {{Sfn|Renault2006|pages=106}}

==The Belle Époque (1871–1913)==
{{see also|Paris architecture of the Belle Époque}}

The architecture of Paris created during the ''Belle Époque'', between 1871 and the beginning of the First World War in 1914, was notable for its variety of different styles, from [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]],  neo-Byzantine and neo-Gothic to [[Art Nouveau]], and [[Art Deco]].  It was also known for its lavish decoration and its imaginative use of both new and traditional materials, including iron, plate glass, colored tile and reinforced concrete.

===The Great Expositions===

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The fall of Napoleon III in 1871 and advent of the Third Republic was followed by the brief Paris rule of the [[Paris Commune]]  (March–May 1871).  In the final days of the Commune, as the French Army recaptured the city, the Communards pulled down the column in [[Place Vendôme]] and burned a number of Paris landmarks, including the 16th-century [[Tuileries Palace]], the 17th-century [[Hôtel de Ville, Paris|Hôtel de Ville]], the Ministry of Justice, the Cour des Comptes,  the Conseil d'Etat, the [[Palais de la Légion d'Honneur]], the Ministry of Finance, and others.  The interior of the Tuileries Palace was completely destroyed, but the walls were still standing.  Haussmann and others called for its restoration, but the new government decided it was a symbol of the monarchy and had the walls torn down. (A fragment of the building can be seen today in the Park of the Trocadero).  Most of the others were restored to their original appearance.  To celebrate the rebuilding of the city the Parisians hosted the first of three universal expositions which attracted millions of visitors to Paris, and transformed the architecture of the city. 
* The [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|Paris Universal Exposition of 1878]] saw the building of the [[Palais du Trocadéro]],  an eclectic composition of Moorish, renaissance and other styles, on the hill of Chaillot by [[Gabriel Davioud]] and Jules Bourdais (1876–78),  It was used in the Expositions of 1889 and 1900, and remained until 1937, when it was replaced by the [[Palais de Chaillot]]. 
*  The [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|Paris Universal Exposition of 1889]] celebrated the centenary of the [[French Revolution]].  The [[Eiffel Tower]], (1887–89), conceived by entrepreneur [[Gustave Eiffel]], and built by engineers Maurice Koechlin and Émile Nougier and architect [[Stephen Sauvestre]], was the tallest structure in the world, was the gateway to the Exposition, and the Gallery of Machines, designed by Ferdinand Dufert and [[Victor Contamin]],  was the largest covered space in the world when it was built.  It combined modern engineering with colorful polychrome decoration, typical of the Belle Epoque.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
* The [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Paris Universal Exposition of 1900]] extended to both the right and left banks of the Seine.  It gave Paris three new landmarks;  the [[Grand Palais]], the [[Petit Palais]] and the [[Pont Alexandre III]].  The Beaux-Arts façade of the Grand Palais (1897–1900), designed by Henri Deglane, [[Charles Girault]], Albert Louvet and Albert Thomas, was a synthesis of the grand neoclassical styles of Louis XIV and Louis XV. concealed a vast interior space covered by a glass roof resting on slender iron pillars. The Petit-Palais (1897–1900), by Charles Girault, borrowed elements of Italian Renaissance architecture, and French neoclassical decorative elements from [[Les Invalides]], the hotels beside the [[Place de la Concorde]] and the palatial stables of Chantilly by [[Jean Aubert the Elder|Jean Aubert]].  Its interior was more revolutionary than the Grand Palais; Girault used reinforced concrete and iron to create a winding stairway along brightly lit galleries. The style of these two buildings, along with the colossal neoclassical style of Louis XVI, influenced the design of Paris residential and commercial buildings until 1920. {{Sfn|Texier|2012|page=108}}

The ''[[Art Nouveau]]'' became the most famous style of the ''Belle Époque'', particularly associated with the [[Paris Métro]] station entrances designed by [[Hector Guimard]], and with a handful of other buildings, including Guimard's ''Castel Béranger'' (1898) at 14 ''rue La Fontaine'', in the [[16th arrondissement of Paris|16th arrondissement]], and the ceramic-sculpture covered house by architect [[Jules Lavirotte]] at 29 Avenue Rapp (7th arrondissement). {{sfn|Sarmant|2012|page=202}} The enthusiasm for ''Art Nouveau'' did not last long; in 1904 the Guimard Metro entrance at Place de l'Opera it was replaced by a more classical entrance. Beginning in 1912, all the Guimard metro entrances were replaced with functional entrances without decoration.{{sfn|Marchand|1993|page=169}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
From the 1870s until the 1930s the most prominent style for Paris churches was the Romano-Byzantine style;  the model and most famous example was the [[Basilique du Sacré-Cœur, Paris|Sacré-Cœur]], by [[Paul Abadie]], whose design won a national exposition.  Its construction lasted the entire span of the Belle Epoque, between 1874 and 1913, under three different architects; it was not consecrated until 1919.  It was modeled after the romanesque and Byzantine cathedrals of the early Middle Ages, which Abadie had restored.  The style also appeared in the church of Notre-Dame d'Auteuil by [[Émile Vaudremer]] (1878–92)  The church of Saint-Dominque, by Leon Gaudibert, (1912–25) followed the style of Byzantine churches, with a massive central dome.  The first church in Paris to be constructed of [[reinforced concrete]] was [[Saint-Jean-de-Montmartre]], at 19 ''rue des Abbesses'' at the foot of Montmartre. The architect was [[Anatole de Baudot]], a student of [[Viollet-le-Duc]]. The nature of the revolution was not evident, because Baudot faced the concrete with brick and ceramic tiles in a colorful ''Art nouveau'' style, with stained glass windows in the same style.{{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=118–119}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[Aristide Boucicaut]] launched the first modern department store in Paris Au [[Bon Marché]], in 1852. Within twenty years, it had 1,825 employees and an income of more than 20 million francs.  In 1869 Boucicault began constructing a much larger store, with an iron frame, a central courtyard covered with a glass skylight. The architect was [[Louis-Charles Boileau]],  with assistance from the engineering firm of [[Gustave Eiffel]].  After more enlargements and modifications, the building was finished in 1887, and became the prototype for other department stores in Paris and around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.gouv.fr/culture/actualites/celebrations2002/bonmarche.htm Naissance des grands magasins : le Bon Marché (by Jacques Marseille, in French, on the official site of the Ministry of Culture of France]&lt;/ref&gt;
Au Bon Marché was followed by au Louvre in 1865;  the [[Bazar de l'Hôtel de Ville]]) in 1866, [[Printemps|Au Printemps]] in 1865; [[La Samaritaine]] in 1870, and [[Galeries Lafayette]] in 1895. All the new stores glass skylights whenever possible to fill the stores with natural light, and designed the balconies around the central courts to provide the maximum of light to each section. {{sfn|Plum|2014|page=28}}
Between 1903 and 1907 the architect [[Frantz Jourdain]] created the interior and façades of the new building of [[La Samaritaine]].{{sfn|Plum|2014|page=20}}

The safety elevator had been invented in 1852 by [[Elisha Otis]], making tall office buildings practical, and the first skyscraper, The first skyscraper, the [[Home Insurance Building]], a ten-story building with a steel frame. had been built in Chicago by [[Louis Sullivan]] in 1893–94,  but Paris architects and clients showed little interest in building tall office buildings.  Paris was already the banking and financial capital of the continent, and moreover, as of 1889 it had the tallest structure in the world, the Eiffel Tower. While some Paris architects visited Chicago to see what has happening, no clients wanted to change the familiar skyline of Paris. {{sfn|Plum|2014|pages=34–35}}

The new office buildings of the Belle Époque often made use of steel, plate glass, elevators and other new architectural technologies, but they were hidden inside sober neoclassical stone façades, and the buildings matched the height of the other buildings on Haussmann's boulevards.  The headquarters of the bank [[Crédit Lyonnais]],  built in 1883 on the boulevard des Italiens in 1883 by William Bouwens Van der Boijen, was in the Beaux-Arts style on the outside, but inside one of the most modern buildings of its time, using an iron frame and glass skylight to provide ample light to large hall where the title deeds were held.  In 1907 the building was updated with a new entrance at 15 rue du Quatre-Septembre, designed by [[Victor Laloux]], who also designed the Gare d'Orsay, now the [[Musée d'Orsay]] The new entrance featured a striking rotunda with a glass dome over a floor of glass bricks, which allowed the daylight to illuminate the level below, and the three other levels below.  The entrance was badly damaged by a fire in 1996;  the rotunda was restored, but the only a few elements still remain of the titles hall.{{sfn|Plum|2014|page=26}}

The Belle Époque was the golden age of the Paris railroad station; they served as the gateways of the city for the visitors who arrived for the great Expositions.  A new [[Gare de Lyon]] was built by Marius Tudor between 1895 and 1902, making the maximum use of glass and iron combined with a picturesque bell tower and Beaux-Arts façade and decoration. The café of the station looked down on the platform where the trains arrived.  The Gare d'Orsay (now the [[Musée d'Orsay]] was the first station in the center of the city, on the site of the old Ministry of Finance, burned by the [[Paris Commune]].  It was built in 1898–1900 in the palatial Beaux-Arts style by architect [[Victor Laloux]].  It was the first Paris station to be electrified and to place the train platforms below street level, a model soon copied by New York and other cities. {{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=86–87}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Private houses and apartment buildings in the Belle Époque were usually in the Beaux-Arts style, either neo-Renaissanace or neoclassical, or a mixture of the two. A good example is the Hôtel de Choudens (1901) by [[Charles Girault]], built for a client who wanted a house in the style of the [[Petit Palais]], which Giraud had designed.  Apartment buildings saw changes in the interiors;  with the development of elevators, the apartment of the wealthiest residents moved from the first floor above the street to the top floor. The rooflines of the new apartment buildings also changed, as the city removed the restrictions –imposed by Haussmann; the most extravagant example was the apartment building at 2729 quai Anatole-France in 7th arrondissement (1906) which sprouted profusion of turrets, spires and decorative arches, made possible by reinforced concrete.{{Sfn|Texier|2012|page=2012}}   A competition for new façades was held in 1898, and one winner was [[Hector Guimard]] for the design of a new apartment building, the [[Castel Béranger]] (1895–98]], the first Paris building in the [[Art Nouveau]] style.  The façade was inspired by the work of the Belgian Art-Nouveau pioneer [[Victor Horta]];  it used both elements of medieval architecture and curved motifs inspired by plants and flowers. Horta designed every detail of the house, including furniture, wallpaper, door handles and locks. The success of the Castel Beranger led to Guimard's selection to design the entrance of stations of the new [[Paris Métro]].  In 1901 the façade competition was won more extravagant architect, [[Jules Lavirotte]],  who designed a house for the ceramic maker [[Alexandre Bigot]] which was more a work of inhabited sculpture than a building.  The façade was entirely covered with decorative ceramic sculpture. The popularity of Art Nouveau did not last long; the last Paris building in the style was Guimard's own house, the Hôtel Guimard at 122 Avenue Mozart (1909–13).{{sfn|Lahor|2007|page=139}}

==Between the wars - Art Deco and modernism  (1919–39)==

===Art Deco===
&lt;gallery mode="packed" heights="150px"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The [[Art Nouveau]] had its moment of glory in Paris beginning in 1898, but was out of fashion by 1914.  The [[Art Deco]], which appeared just before the war, became the dominant style for major buildings between the wars.  The primary building material of the new era was reinforced concrete. The structure of the buildings was clearly expressed on the exterior, and was dominated by horizontal lines, with rows of bow windows and small balconies, They often had classical features, such as rows of columns, but these were expressed in a stark modern form; ornament was kept to a minimum;  and statuary and ornament was often applied, as a carved stone plaque on the façade,rather than expressed in the architecture of the building itself. {{Sfn|Sarmant|2012|page=206}}

The leading proponents of the art deco were [[Auguste Perret]] and [[Henri Sauvage]].  Perret designed the [[Théâtre des Champs-Élysées]], the first art deco building in Paris, in 1913, just before the War.  His major achievements between the wars were the building of the ''Mobilier National'' (1936) and the Museum of Public Works (1939), now the Economic and Social Council, located on place d'Iéna, with its giant rotunda and columns inspired by ancient Egypt.  Sauvage expanded the [[La Samaritaine]] department store in 1931, preserving elements of the Art-Nouveau interior and façades, while giving it an art-deco form.  He experimented with new, simpler forms of apartment buildings, including the stepped building, creating terraces for the upper floors;  and covered concrete surfaces with white ceramic tile, resembling stone. He also was a pioneer in the use of prefabricated building materials, reducing costs and construction time.

A related Paris fashion between the wars was the ''pacquebot'' style, buildings that resembled the ocean liners of the period, with sleek white façades, rounded corners, white façades, and nautical railings.  They often were built on narrow pieces of land, or on corners.  One example is the building at 3 boulevard Victor in the 15th arrondissement, built in 1935.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The international expositions of the 1920s and 1930s left fewer architectural landmarks than the earlier exhibitions.  The 1925 Exposition of decorative arts had several very modern buildings, the Russian pavilions, the art deco ''Pavillon du Collectionneur'' by Ruhlmann and the ''Pavillon d'Esprit'' by [[Le Corbusier]], but they were all torn down when the exhibit ended.  One impressive art deco building from the 1934 Colonial Exposition survived;  the Museum of the Colonies at la Port Doréé, by Albert Laprade, 89 meters long, with a colonnade and a front wall entirely covered with a bas-relief by [[Alfred Janniot]] on the animals, plants, and cultures the theme the cultures of the French colonies. The interior was filled with sculpture and murals from the period, still visible today.  Today the building is the [[Cité nationale de l'histoire de l'immigration]], or museum of the history of immigration.

The [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne|Paris International Exposition of 1937]], held on the eve of World War II,  was not a popular success;  its two largest national pavilions were those of Nazi Germany and Stalinist Russia, facing each other across the central esplanade.  The chief architectural legacies were the [[Palais de Chaillot]], where the old Palais de Trocadero had been, by [[Jacques Carlu]], Louis Hippolyte Boileau and [[Léon Azéma]], (1935–37), built of concrete and beige stone, and the Palais de Iena, facing it.  Both were built in a monumental neoclassical style.  The nearby [[Palais de Tokyo]] was another exhibit legacy, designed by André Auber], Jean-Claude Dondel, Paul Viard and Marcel Dastugue (1934–37),  in a similar neoclassic style, with a colonnade.  It is now the modern art museum of the city of Paris.  Another exhibit legacy is the former Museum of Public Works (1936–48) at Place and Avenue Iena,  by [[Auguste Perret]].  It contains an impressive rotunda and conference hall with a neoclassical façade, all built of reinforced concrete. After the War it was converted into the headquarters of the French Economic, Social and Environmental Council. {{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=138–39}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The architect [[Auguste Perret]] had anticipated modern residential style in 1904, with an art deco house of reinforced concrete faced with ceramics on Rue Franklin. [[Henri Sauvage]] also made art-deco residential buildings with clean geometric lines, made of reinforced concrete faced with white ceramic tiles. The architect Charles-Édouard Jeanneret-Gris, better known as [[Le Corbusier]]. went further,  designing houses in geometric forms, lacking any ornament. At age of twenty-one worked as an assistant in the office of Perret.  In 1922 he opened his own architectural office with his cousin [[Pierre Jeanneret]] in 1922 and built some of his first houses in Paris, notably the [[Villa La Roche]] at 10 square du Docteur-Blanche in the 16th arrondissement, built for a Swiss pharmaceuticals magnate. Built in 1923, it introduced elements found in many of Corbusier's later buildings, including white concrete walls, was constructed in 1923, and introduced many of the themes found in Corbusier's later work, including an interior ramp between levels and horizontal bands of windows.  He also designed the furniture for the house. [[Robert Mallet-Stevens]] pursued a similar modernist style, composed of geometric shapes, walls of glass, and an absence of ornament. He built a studio and residence with a large glass wall and spiral stairway for glass designer Louis Barillet at 15 square Vergennes (15th arrondissement) and constructed a series of houses for artists, each one different, on what is now known as rue Mallet-Stevens in the 16th arrondissement.  One of the most striking houses of the 1920s was the house of artist [[Tristan Tzara]] 15 avenue Junot in the 18th arrondissement. Designed by the Austrian architect [[Adolf Loos]]. The interior was completely irregular; each room was of a different size, and on a different level. Another unusual house was the [[Maison de Verre]] or "Glass house" at 31 rue Saint-Guillaume in the 7th arrondissement, built for Doctor Dalace by [[Pierre Chareau]], with Bernard Bijvoet (1927–31).  It was made entirely of bricks of glass, supported by a metal frame. {{Sfn|Texier|2012|page=128}}

Modernist buildings built in the 1920s and 1930s were relatively rare. The most characteristic Paris residential architect of the 1920s was [[Michel Roux-Spitz]],  who built a series of large luxury apartment buildings in the 1920s and 1930s, mostly in the 6th and 7th arrondissements. The buildings were all built of reinforced concrete, and featured and had white walls, often faced with stone, and horizontal rows of three-faced bow windows, a modernized version of the Haussmann apartment buildings on the same streets.{{Sfn|Texier|2012|page=128}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Beginning in 1919, soon after the end of World War I, the French government began building public housing on a huge scale, particularly on the vacant land of the former fortifications around the city.  The new buildings were called HBMs, or ''Habitations à Bon Marché'' (Low-cost residences].  They were concentrated to the north, east and south of the city, while a more expensive type of housing, the ILM, or ''Immeubles à loyer moyen'', or moderate priced residences,  intended for the middle class, were built to the west of the city. A special agency of architects was established to design the buildings. The first group of 2,734 new housing units, called the ''Cité de Montmartre''  was built between the Portes of Clignancourt and Montmartre between 1922 and 1928. The new buildings were constructed of concrete and brick. The earliest buildings had many decorative elements, particularly at the roofline, including concrete pergolas. The decoration became less over the years, and over time the brick gave way gradually to reinforced concrete façades. {{Sfn|Texier|2012|page=236}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Several new churches were built in Paris between the wars, in varied styles.  The [[Église du Saint-Esprit (Paris)|Église du Saint-Esprit]], (1928–32), designed by Paul Tournon, located at 186 Avenue Daumesnil in the 12th arrondissement, designed by Paul Tournon.  has a modern exterior, made of reinforced concrete covered with red brick and modern bell tower 75 meters high, but the central feature is a huge dome, 22 meters in diameter, The design, like that of the Basilica of Sacré-Cœur, was inspired by Byzantine churches. The interior was decorated with murals by several notable artists, including [[Maurice Denis]].  The [[Église Saint-Pierre-de-Chaillot]], at 31 avenue Marceau (16th), was designed by Émile Bois (1932–38).  Its tower and massive Romanesque entrance was inspired by the churches of the [[Périgord]] region.&lt;ref&gt;Dumoulin, Aline, ''Églises de Paris'' (2010), Éditions Nassin, {{ISBN|978-2-7072-0683-1}}, pages 166–167.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Church of Sainte-Odile at 2 Avenue Stephane-Mallarmé (17th arrondissement), by [[Jacques Barges]] (1935–39) has a single nave, three neo-Byzantine cupolas, and the highest bell tower in Paris.{{Sfn|Texier|2012|page=129}}

The [[Grand Mosque of Paris]] was one of the more unusual buildings constructed during the period. Intended to honor the Muslim soldiers from the French colonies who died for France during the war, it was designed by the architect [[Maurice Tranchant de Lunel]], and built and decorated with the assistance of craftsmen from North Africa. The project was funded by the National Assembly in 1920, construction began in 1922, and it was completed in 1924, and dedicated by the President of France, [[Gaston Doumergue]], and the Sultan of Morocco, [[Moulay Youssef]].  The style was termed "Hispano-Moorish"  and the design was largely influenced by the Grand Mosque of [[Fez]], Morocco. {{Sfn|Sarmant|2012|page=206}}

==After World War II (1946–2000)==

===The triumph of modernism===

&lt;/gallery&gt;
In the years after World War II, modernism became the official style for public buildings, both because it was new and fashionable, and partly because it was usually less expensive to build.  Buildings were designed to express their function, using simple geometric forms, with a minimum of ornament and decoration.  They were usually designed so that every office had its own window and view.  The materials of choice were reinforced concrete, sometimes covered with aluminum panels, and glass. The term "Palais" used for many public buildings before the war was replaced by the more modest term "Maison", or "House."   In place of decoration, the buildings often contained works of sculpture in interior courtyards and were surrounded by gardens.  There was little if anything specifically French about the new buildings; they resembled modernist buildings in the United States and other parts of Europe, and, particularly under President Mitterrand, were often designed by internationally famous architects from other countries.

Among the earliest and most influential of the new public buildings was the Maison de la Radio, the headquarters of French national radio and television, along the Seine in the 16th arrondissement, designed by [[Henry Bernard (architect)|Henry Bernard]] (1952–63).  Bernard had studied at the [[École des Beaux-Arts]], won the [[Prix de Rome]], and eventually became the head of the Academy of Beaux-Arts, but he converted with enthusiasm to the new style. The Maison de Radio was composed of two circular buildings fitted one inside the other;  an outer circle facing the river, with a thousand offices;  an inner circle made up of studios;  and a 68-meter tall tower in the center, which contains the archives. It was originally designed with a concrete façade on the outer building, but it was modified and covered with a skin of aluminum and glass. It was described by its builders as a continuation toward the west of the line of great monuments beside the Seine;  the Louvre, the Grand Palais, and Palais de Chaillot. {{Sfn|Lemoine|2000|page=181}}

Other major public buildings in the monumental modernist style included the headquarters of UNESCO, the United Nations cultural headquarters, on Place Fontenoy in the 7th arrondissement, by [[Marcel Breuer]], [[Bernard Zehrfuss]] and [[Pier Luigi Nervi]] (1954–58), in the form of a tripod of three wings made of reinforced concrete, with gardens between the wings.  Each office in the building benefited from natural light and an exterior view. {{Sfn|Texier|2012|page=156}}  The headquarters of the French Communist Party at 2 Place du Colonel Fabien (19th arrondissement), was designed by [[Oscar Niemeyer]], who had just finished designing [[Brasília]], the new Brazilian capital city.  It was constructed between 1969 and 1980, and was an eight-story block built on columns above the street, with a smooth undulating glass façade.  The auditorium next to the building was half buried underground, covered by a concrete dome that allowed light to enter {{Sfn|Lemoine|2000|page=186}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
In the 1970s, French Presidents began to build major architectural projects which became their legacy, usually finished after they left office. The first was [[Georges Pompidou]], a noted admirer and patron of modern art, who made plans for what became, after his death in 1974, the [[Centre Pompidou]].  It was designed by [[Renzo Piano]] and [[Richard Rogers]], and expressed all of its mechanical functions on the exterior of the building, with brightly colored pipes, ducts and escalators. The principal architectural projects begun by his successor, [[Giscard d'Estaing]], were the conversion of the [[Musée d'Orsay]], a central railroad station transformed into a museum devoted to 19th-century French art,  (1978–86), and the [[Cité des Sciences et de l'Industrie|City of Sciences and Industry]] (1980–86) in the [[Parc de la Villette]] in the 19th arrondissement,  whose features included the [[La Géode]], a geodesic sphere 36 meters in diameter made of polished stainless steel, now containing an [[omnimax]] theater (1980–86), designed by Adrien Feinsilber. {{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=170–171}}

[[François Mitterrand]] (1981–95) had fourteen years in power, enough time to complete more projects than any president since Napoleon III. In the case of the Louve pyramid, he personally selected the architect, without a competition.  He completed the projects begun by Giscard and began even more ambitious projects of his own, many of them designed for the celebration of the bicentennial of the French Revolution in 1989;   his ''Grands Travaux'' i("Great Works") included the [[Institut du Monde Arabe]], by architect [[Jean Nouvel]],  finished in 1987;  the Grand Louvre, including the glass pyramid (1983–89) designed by [[I. M. Pei]];  the [[Grande Arche]] of [[La Défense]] by the Danish architect [[Johan Otto von Spreckelsen]], a building in the form of a giant ceremonial arch, which marked the western end of the historical axis that began at the Louvre;   (inaugurated July 1989);  the [[Opéra Bastille]], by architect [[Carlos Ott]], opened on July 13, 1989, the day before the bicentennial of the French Revolution, and a new building for the Ministries of the Economy and Finance, at Bercy (12th arrondissement) (1982–88), a massive building next to the Seine which resembled both a gateway to the city and a huge bridge with its feet in the river, designed by [[Paul Chemetov]] and Borja Huidobro.  His last project was located on the other side of the Seine from the Finance Ministry; a group of four book-shaped glass towers for the [[French National Library]] (1989–95), designed by [[Dominique Perrault]].  The books were stored in the towers, while the reading rooms were located beneath a terrace between the buildings, with windows looking out onto a garden. {{Sfn|Texier|pages=170–71}}{{Sfn|Bezbakh|2004|pages=799–815}}

===The age of towers===
&lt;gallery mode="packed" heights="150px"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Until the 1960s there were no tall buildings in Paris to share the skyline with the [[Eiffel Tower]], the tallest structure in the city; a strict height limit of thirty-five meters was in place. However, in October 1958, under the Fifth Republic,  in order to permit the construction of more housing and office buildings, the rules began to change. A new urban plan for the city was adopted by the municipal council in 1959. Higher buildings were permitted, as long as they met both technical and aesthetic standards. The first new tower to be constructed was an apartment building, the Tour Croulebarbe, at 33 rue Croulebarbe in the 13th arrondissement. It was twenty-two stories, and 61 meters high, and was completed in 1961. Between 1960 and 1975, about 160 new buildings higher than fifteen stories were constructed in Paris, more than half of them in the 13th and 15th arrondissements. Most of them were about one hundred meters high; several clusters of high-rises the work one developer, Michel Holley, who built the towers of Place d'Italie, Front de Seine, and Hauts de Belleville. {{Sfn|Texier|2012|page=158}}

Two of the projects of residential towers were especially large; 29 hectares along the banks of the Seine at [[Beaugrenelle]], and 87 hectares between Place de l'Italie and Tolbiac. Blocks of old buildings were torn town and replaced with residential towers.{{Sfn|Marchand|1993|page=302}}

Between 1959 and 1968, the old Montparnasse railway station was demolished and rebuilt nearby, making a large parcel of land available for construction. The municipal council learned of the project only indirectly, through a message from the ministry in charge of construction projects. The first plan, proposed in 1957, was a new headquarters for Air France, a state-owned enterprise, in a tower 150 meters high. In 1959, the proposed height was increased to 170 meters. In 1965, to protect the views in the historic part of the city, the municipal council declared that the new building should be shorter, so it would not visible from the esplanade of Les Invalides. In 1967, the Prefect of Paris, representing the government of President de Gaulle, overruled the municipal council decision, raised the height to two hundred meters, to create more rentable office space. The new building, built between 1969 and 1972, was (and still is) the tallest building within the city limits.{{Sfn|Marchand|1993|page=302}}

The growing number of skyscrapers appearing on the Paris skyline provoked resistance from the Paris population.  In 1975, President [[Giscard d'Estaing]] declared a moratorium on new towers within the city, and in 1977 the City of Paris was given a new ''Plan d'Occupation des Sols'' (POS) or Land use plan, which imposed a height limit of twenty-five meters in the center of Paris and 31 meters in the outer arrondissements.  Also, new buildings are required to be constructed right up to the sidewalk, without setbacks, further discouraging very tall buildings.{{Sfn|Texier|2012|page=164}}  The building of skyscrapers continued outside of Paris, particularly in the new business district of [[La Défense]].

At the end of the 20th century, the tallest structure in the City of Paris and the [[Île-de-France]] was still the [[Eiffel Tower]] in the 7th arrondissement, 324 meters high, completed in 1889. The tallest building in the Paris region was the [[Tour First]], at 225 meters, located in [[La Défense]] built in 1974.

===Public housing - the HLM and the ''barre''===
[[File:Cité.JPG|thumb|right|200px|HLM, or public housing project, in the Paris suburb of Saint-Denis]]
After the War Paris faced a severe housing shortage;  most of the housing in the city dated to the 19th century, and was in terrible condition. Only two thousand new housing units were constructed between 1946 and 1950.  The number rose to 4,230 in 1951 and more than 10,000 in 1956. The office of public housing of the City of Paris acquired the cheapest land it could buy, at the edges of the city. In 1961, when land within the city was exhausted, they were authorized to begin buying land in the surrounding suburbs. The first postwar social housing buildings were relatively low- three or four stories. Much larger buildings began to appear in the mid-1950s. They were built with prefabricated materials and placed in clusters. They were known as HLMs, or ''Habitations à loyer moderé'', or moderate-cost housing. A larger type of HLM began to appear in the mid-1950s, known as a ''barre'', because it was longer than it was high. The usually had between 200 and 300 apartments, were built in clusters, and were often some distance from shops and public transportation. They were welcomed by the families who lived there in the 1950s and early 1960s, but in later years they were crowded with recent immigrants and suffered from crime, drugs and social unrest.{{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=152–153}}

==Contemporary (2001- )==
Paris architecture since 2000 has been very diverse, with no single dominant style.  In the field of museums and monuments, the most prominent name has been [[Jean Nouvel]].  His earlier work in Paris included the [[Institut du Monde Arabe]] (1982–87), and the [[Fondation Cartier]] (1992–94), which features a glass screen between the building and the street. In 2006 he completed the [[Musée du Quai Branly]], the Presidential project of [[Jacques Chirac]], a museum presenting the cultures of Asia, Africa and the Americas. It also included a glass screen between the building and the street, as well as a façade covered with living plants. In 2015, he completed the new Paris symphony hall at La Villette. {{Sfn|Poisson|2009|pages=285–286}}

The American architect [[Frank Gehry]] also made a notable contribution to Paris architect, for his American Center in Bercy (1994), which became the home of the Cinémathèque Française in 2005; and for the building of the [[Louis Vuitton Foundation]], a museum of modern and contemporary art in the [[Bois de Boulogne]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Supermodernism===
A notable new style of French architecture, called Supermodernism by critic Hans Ibeling, gives precedence to the visual sensations, spatial and tactile, of the viewer looking at the façade. The best-known architects in this school are Jean Nouvel and [[Dominique Perrault]].
* The Hôtel Berlier (1986–89) by [[Dominique Perrault]], an office building at 26-34 rule Brunneseau in the 13th arrondissement, is a block of glass, whose structure is nearly invisible. Perrault also designed the new [[French National Library]].
* The headquarters of the newspaper ''[[Le Monde]]'' at 74–84 boulevard August-Blanqui in the 13th arrondissement, designed by Christian de Portzamparc (2005), has a façade that resembles the front page of the newspaper. 
* The administration building of the French Ministry of Culture at 182 rue Saint-Honoré (2002–04), by Francis Soler and Frédéric Druot, is an older structure whose façade is completely covered with an ornamental metal mesh. 
* The Hôtel Fouquet's Barrière at 2 rue Vernet, 23 rue Quentin-Bauchart and 46 avenue George-V, in the 8th arrondissement, designed by Édouard François, is covered by a skin of concrete which is a molding of the façade of an historic neighboring building.

===Ecological architecture===
One important theme of early-21st-century Paris architecture was making buildings that were ecologically friendly.

* The "Flower-Tower" built in 2004 by Édouard François, located at 23 rue-Albert-Roussel in the 17th arrondissement, is covered with the living foliage of bamboo plants, placed in concrete pots at the edges of the terraces on each floor, and watered automatically.
* The façade of the university restaurant building at 3 rue Mabillon in the 6th arrondissement, built in 1954,  was recovered by architect Patrick Mauger with the logs of trees, to provide better thermal isolation.
* A public housing hostel for the homeless, the Centre d'hebergement Emmaüs, designed by Emmanuel Saadi in 2011, located at 179 quai de Valmy in the 10th arrondissement, is entirely covered by photo-voltaic panels for generating solar electricity. {{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=180–181}}

===Conversions===
Another important theme in 21st-century Parisian architecture is the conversion of older industrial or commercial buildings for new purposes, called in French "reconversions" or  "transcriptions". 
* A large grain warehouse and flour mill in the 13th arrondissement were converted between 2002 and 2007 into buildings for the [[Paris Diderot University]] campus. The architects were Nicolas Michelin and Rudy Ricciotti.
* Les Docks, a large warehouse structure built before World War I alongside the Seine at 34 quai d'Austerlitz, was converted 2005–08 into the City of Fashion and Design, by means of a "plug-over" of ramps, stairways and passages.  The architects were Jakob and MacFarlane. {{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=178–179}}

===Public housing===
Since the 1980s the more recent constructions of HLMs, or public housing, in Paris have tried to avoid the massive and monotonous structures of the past, with more picturesque architectural detail, variety of styles, greater use of color,  and large complexes broken into smaller mini-neighborhoods.  The new style, called ''fragmentation'', was particularly pioneered by architects Christian de Portzamparc and Frédéric Borel. In one complex on rue Pierre-Rebière in the 17th arrondissement the 180 residences were designed by nine different teams of architects. {{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=172–173}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11420">'''Avvisi''' ({{IPA-it|avˈviːzo|lang}}; plural: ''avvisi'') were hand-written [[newsletters]] used to convey political, military, and economic [[news]] quickly and efficiently throughout [[Europe]], and more specifically [[Italy]], during the [[early modern period|early modern era (1500-1700)]].  In the beginning avvisi were very similar to letters written from one dignitary to another, but diverged from such letters in the sixteenth century with more standardized practices.  Avvisi can be divided into two categories: 'public' avvisi and 'secret' avvisi, though each copy was often written by the same person.&lt;ref&gt;Infelise, Mario. "Roman Avvisi: Information and Politics in the Seventeenth Century." Court and Politics in Papal Rome, 1492-1700. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002. 212,214,216-217.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Italian language|Italian]], the word '''[[wikt:avviso|avviso]]''' translates to ''notice'', ''warning'', ''advice'', or ''announcement''.

==Origin==
The avvisi found their origins, and peaked, in the early modern Italian world - primarily Rome and Venice.  The popularity and distribution of the avvisi was driven by each court's desire to know what the opposing and even the allied courts are up to.  News networks spread all across Europe, but the avviso itself was generally created in either Rome or Venice, with the rest of Europe simply consuming.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Importance==
Avvisi influenced many aspects of the early modern world including public opinion, political battles, the nature of propaganda, careers, and historical records.

'''Public Opinion'''&lt;br /&gt;
Avvisi helped to develop public opinion by informing, organizing, and providing a voice for the public.  They allowed the general public to learn of the secret dealings of the nation's leaders, form a response, and then have that response actually be heard by their fellow citizens - essentially making them new players in the game of politics.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

'''Politics and War'''&lt;br /&gt;
Though officially renounced by many leaders at the time, avvisi were then used by those very same leaders to wage their political campaigns against one another.  Destruction and [[censorship]] of avvisi was selective, demonstrating that the authorities recognized the importance of spreading news but would have preferred to spread only news that was of benefit to themselves.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}  Competition quickly led to avvisi being used as propaganda devices both as a machine of war{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} and in attempts to turn the mob on their own country.&lt;ref name="DeVivo, Filippo 2005"&gt;DeVivo, Filippo. "Paolo Sarpi and the Uses of Information in Seventeenth-Century Venice." Media History, 11:1, 38. London: Routledge. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  Conflict as a result of avvisi being used as propaganda is certainly not out of the question, either with the public or between nations.&lt;ref&gt;Infelise, Mario. "Roman Avvisi: Information and Politics in the Seventeenth Century." Court and Politics in Papal Rome, 1492-1700. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;  Further the avvisi provided the public with political power rarely seen before in the form of 'secret' information that could have allowed them to have influence upon the courts,{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} and government decisions.&lt;ref name="DeVivo, Filippo 2005"/&gt;  A minority of people, such as [[Paolo Sarpi]], believed that government institutions should rescind their censorship of avvisi and make full use of publication to combat enemy publication.  An example of this includes several pamphlets written by Sarpi in defense of Venice's rights over the Adriatic.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

'''Finances and Wealth'''&lt;br /&gt;
Creation and distribution of avvisi required writers, those who can deliver the news, and those who can grant the information that makes the news and this provided many people with jobs, earning them money through standard means.  In addition, invaluable secrets provided by the avvisi could be used in extortion or allowing individuals to influence prices at market.  Those who used the avvisi in this way held the opinion that the information provided by avvisi could not be stopped and it was thus better to capitalize on it.&lt;ref&gt;DeVivo, Filippo. "Paolo Sarpi and the Uses of Information in Seventeenth-Century Venice." Media History, 11:1, 37,38. London: Routledge. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''History'''&lt;br /&gt;
Avvisi led to a realization of the importance of the after-effects of historical records, whether they be true or not.  [[Paolo Sarpi]]'s work is an excellent example of this, as he states that he may cause more damage dead (through his writing) than he ever had alive.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Types==
;Public avvisi
Public avvisi were news letters that were available to anyone who wished to travel to a distribution center in a city.  They were limited to generic, often harmless facts.&lt;ref&gt;Infelise, Mario. "Roman Avvisi: Information and Politics in the Seventeenth Century." Court and Politics in Papal Rome, 1492-1700. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002. 216,217,220.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Secret avvisi
Secret avvisi were news letters available to a restricted audience, much akin to duplicated personal letters.  Their content could be considerably more harmful than the public counterpart, as it could include opinions of top officials and the discussions from secret meetings.  This form of communication often had a very specific purpose.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Distribution==
Distribution of the avvisi began with the sources of information.  Reporters (newsletter writers, menanti, reportisti, gazzettieri) had networks of contacts filtering information from chancelleries, Catholic churches, Protestant churches, foreign embassies,{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} and shops.&lt;ref&gt;DeVivo, Filippo. "Paolo Sarpi and the Uses of Information in Seventeenth-Century Venice." Media History, 11:1, 39,41. London: Routledge. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  Information was gathered and put together individually or at a [[Scrittoria]] (writer's workshop).  The avvisi would then be distributed by regular news services and organized postal service networks.  Whether newsletters were sent weekly, bi-weekly, or annually depended on the type of news and the writer.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;Infelise, Mario. "Roman Avvisi: Information and Politics in the Seventeenth Century." Court and Politics in Papal Rome, 1492-1700. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002. 212,219,224.&lt;/ref&gt;  As the public avvisi were presented the news would quickly spread by word of mouth among the illiterate, no longer relying on the avvisi reporters.  The range of information presented within avvisi was very broad, including countries such as France, Italy, and the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;DeVivo, Filippo. "Paolo Sarpi and the Uses of Information in Seventeenth-Century Venice." Media History, 11:1, 38,42. London: Routledge. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reporters==
Writers of avvisi received very little recognition which, quite often, was exactly how they wanted it.  Fear of censorship kept writers from signing work under their own name - for in the early modern era censorship could mean death.  Mutual bonds of trust developed between certain reporters and clients once they found they could trust each other to provide reliable information without any trouble.  The quality of avvisi may fall under question for numerous reasons; the recopying of documents, the translation of documents, and the insertion of opinions for example.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;Infelise, Mario. "Roman Avvisi: Information and Politics in the Seventeenth Century." Court and Politics in Papal Rome, 1492-1700. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002. 216,219,220.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Censorship==
Censorship of avvisi began with [[Pope Pius V]]'s campaign, beginning in 1570CE.  Writers caught distributing what the Catholic Church determined to be defamatory were punished severely - several examples of punishments include death, imprisonment, and torture (sometimes to death).  

The harsh punishments did not prevent writers from continuing in their task, though they were forced to use pseudonyms.&lt;ref&gt;DeVivo, Filippo. "Paolo Sarpi and the Uses of Information in Seventeenth-Century Venice." Media History, 11:1, 39. London: Routledge. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The avvisi were blamed for causing disputes by church officials and writers.  However, institutions that condemned avvisi found they could do nothing to quell the hand-written newsletters and began to use them to their own benefit, even with bans still in place.&lt;ref&gt;Infelise, Mario. "Roman Avvisi: Information and Politics in the Seventeenth Century." Court and Politics in Papal Rome, 1492-1700. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002. 214,215,217&lt;/ref&gt;  

Religious leaders were not alone in banning newsletters - more secular leaders also laid down limitations and prohibitions, including Venice's [[Council of Ten]] who held bans until at least 1567.&lt;ref&gt;DeVivo, Filippo. "Paolo Sarpi and the Uses of Information in Seventeenth-Century Venice." Media History, 11:1, 37. London: Routledge. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  

A popular reporter, [[Paolo Sarpi]], was a minority in his time for holding the belief that the spread of information could not be stopped so censorship was a waste of resources.  Sarpi believed that the only way to combat the enemy's newsletters is for the government to have their own avviso.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Printed vs. Written==
It was not until the middle of the seventeenth century that printed avvisi became more common, and even then Venice and Rome abstained from print.  Due to restrictions from censorship on printed works, a sense of urgency, and a desire for personalization hand written avvisi would not be easily replaced by the printing press.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}  

Printed works were produced much more slowly and as a result the public would lose interest in the topic before it came to print.&lt;ref&gt;DeVivo, Filippo. "Paolo Sarpi and the Uses of Information in Seventeenth-Century Venice." Media History, 11:1, 48. London: Routledge. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Further, printed avvisi were less robust in an effort to avoid censors and cut editing time.&lt;ref&gt;Infelise, Mario. "Roman Avvisi: Information and Politics in the Seventeenth Century." Court and Politics in Papal Rome, 1492-1700. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002. 227.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2909">A '''''badchen''''' or '''''badkhn''''' (a Hebrew word meaning [[jester]] that has been Yiddishized as ''badchen'') is a [[Jewish]] comedian with scholarly overtones who entertained guests at weddings among the [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazim]] of [[Eastern Europe]]. Today they are found in all countries with [[Hasidic Judaism|Chassidic]] populations, including the [[United States]], performing their [[shtick]] at weddings.

The ''badchen'' was considered a standard part of the wedding party, as ''de rigueur'' as the officiating [[rabbi]]. An elaborate traditional wedding might also involve a ''letz'' (lit. a clown, here a ''jongleur'' or musician) and a ''marshalik'' (a master of ceremonies).&lt;ref name=Liptzin&gt;[[Sol Liptzin|Liptzin, Sol]], ''A History of Yiddish Literature'', Jonathan David Publishers, Middle Village, NY, 1972, {{ISBN|0-8246-0124-6}}, 22-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''badchen'' has to be able both to provide the energy for a party before and after the ceremony itself and also to make the transition to a more serious tone immediately before the ceremony.&lt;ref name=Liptzin/&gt;  To this end his comedy was not of a [[slapstick]] variety but rather verbal with many intricate [[Talmud]]ic references and [[in-joke]]s.

Following the Council of Vilna on July 3, 1661, a decree was issued banning merry-making, including the setting of limitations on wedding celebrations, public drinking, fire dances, masquerades, and Jewish comic entertainers. The ''badchen'' was exempted from the decree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Gordon | first = Mel | title = Catastrophe in Ukraine, Comedy Today | newspaper = Reform Judaism | pages = 50–51 | date = Spring 2011 | accessdate = 2011-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some famous ''badchonim'' include [[Chaim Menachem Mermelstien|Chaim Menachem (Mendel) Mermelstein]] (born March 2, 1920 in [[Mukachevo|Munkacz]], died November 7, 1985 in [[New York City|New York]]), considered the father of modern-day ''badchonus'',{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} and the present-day performers [[Yankel Miller]] and [[Yoel Lebowits]].

The 19th-century [[Broder singer]]s began as ''badchonim'', but soon started to perform outside of the context of weddings. They, in turn, are usually seen as the forerunners of [[Yiddish theater]].

On the Jewish holiday of [[Purim]] many young men undertake to be ''badchonim'' during [[Purim spiel]]s.

The '''Benty Grange hanging bowl''' is a fragmentary [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] artefact from the 7th century AD. All that remains are two escutcheons; a third disintegrated soon after excavation, and no longer survives. The escutcheons were found in 1848, alongside the better-known [[Benty Grange helmet]], by the [[Antiquarian|antiquary]] [[Thomas Bateman]] in a [[tumulus]] at the [[Benty Grange]] farm in the English county of [[Derbyshire]]. They were undoubtedly buried as part of an entire [[hanging bowl]], placed in what appears to have been the burial mound of a high-status warrior.

What remains of one escutcheon belongs to [[Museums Sheffield]] and in 2018 was displayed at [[Weston Park Museum]].{{sfn|Museums Sheffield escutcheon}} The other is held by the [[Ashmolean Museum]] at the [[University of Oxford]]; as of 2018 it is not on display.{{sfn|Ashmolean Museum}}

==Description==
[[File:Benty Grange finds - Llewellynn Jewitt watercolour.jpg|thumb|alt=Colour image of a Llewellynn Jewitt watercolour depicting the Benty Grange hanging bowl escutcheons and associated finds|A contemporary watercolour by [[Llewellynn Jewitt]] depicts the surviving escutcheons, top, fragments of the third escutcheon, second-to-bottom row, and associated finds.]]
The two surviving escutcheons are made of [[Vitreous enamel|enamelled]] bronze and are {{convert|40|mm|abbr=on}} in diameter.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|2005|p=119}} They have the same design and plain frames, parts of which survive.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|2005|p=119}} Both escutcheons are fragmentary; enough survives of each for the design to be reconstructed,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|2005|p=119}} and, because of overlapping segments, for it to be certain that they represent two distinct pieces.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974|p=250 n.5}} Whether they are hook escutcheons, associated with the suspension hooks on the exterior of the bowl, or basal discs, placed at the base of the interior, is uncertain, but a ring on the back of one fragment suggests an association with the suspension chains, and a contemporary watercolour by [[Llewellynn Jewitt]] seems to show that a hook may have been present at excavation.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|2005|p=119}} The decomposed enamel background appears yellow to the eye,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|2005|pp=77, 119}} as it did when excavated.{{sfn|Bateman|1849|p=277}}{{sfn|Bateman|1855|p=160}}{{sfn|Bateman|1861|p=29}} A red-yellow colour scheme has also been suggested,{{sfn|Henry|1936|p=236}}{{sfn|Haseloff|1990|p=162}} but on minimal and possibly incorrect evidence.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|2005|pp=77, 119}} As sampling of the enamel was not permitted when the Sheffield escutcheon was analysed at the museum in 1968, however, the all-yellow hypothesis is not definitive.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|2005|p=77}}

The reconstructed design shows three "ribbon-style fish or [[dolphin]]-like creatures", each biting the tail of the animal ahead of it.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|2005|p=119}} The bodies are yellow like the background, and defined by their outlines.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974|p=250 n.5}} They are limbless, the tails curled in a circle, and the jaws both long and curved; where the tails should pass through the jaws of the animals behind, gaps appear, creating slight separations between segments of tail.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|2005|p=119}} Each animal has a small eye shaped like a pointed oval.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|2005|p=119}} The outer borders of the discs, the plain frames, and the contours and eyes of the animals, are all tinned or silvered.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|2005|p=119}}

Surviving records of the third escutcheon indicate that it was of a different style and size.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|2005|p=119}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974|p=250 n.5}} Drawings by Bateman and Jewitt show it with a scroll pattern and small piece of frame.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974|p=250 n.5}}{{sfn|Bateman|1849|p=277}}{{sfn|Bateman|1861|pp=29–30}} It appears to have been about half the size of the other two, and may have originally been placed at the bottom of the hanging bowl.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|2005|p=119}}

The escutcheons were undoubtedly part of an entire hanging bowl when buried.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|2005|p=119}} Nothing else survives.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|2005|p=119}} The mass of corroded chainwork discovered six feet away, which survives only in illustrations by Jewitt and descriptions by Bateman,{{sfn|Museums Sheffield chainwork 1}}{{sfn|Museums Sheffield chainwork 2}} is unlikely to be related; although a large and intricate chain was found with a cauldron from [[Sutton Hoo]], the Benty Grange chains appear dissimilar.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974|p=250 n.6}} They were also likely too heavy to have been used to suspend the hanging bowl.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974|p=250 n.6}}

The animal designs on the Benty Grange hanging bowl are paralleled by designs on other escutcheons, and even more closely by designs on medieval [[illuminated manuscript]]s.{{sfn|Henry|1936|p=236}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|2005|p=120}} Three escutcheons from a hanging bowl found in [[Faversham]] show animals that also look like dolphins,{{sfn|British Museum Faversham 1}}{{sfn|British Museum Faversham 2}}{{sfn|British Museum Faversham 3}} but with more developed bodies;{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|2005|p=120}} a better parallel is with a disc found near the [[Lullingstone]] hanging bowl that is also decorated with dolphin-like creatures.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|2005|pp=72, 120, 175, 428}}

Despite the similarities with other escutcheon and disc designs, several manuscript illustrations are more closely related to the Benty Grange designs.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|2005|p=120}} Bateman remarked on this as early as 1861, "shrewdly" as it turned out,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974|pp=224–225}} noting that similar patterns were used in "several manuscripts of the VIIth Century, for the purpose of decorating the initial letters."{{sfn|Bateman|1861|p=29}} In particular, the mid-seventh-century [[Gospel Book Fragment (Durham Cathedral Library, A. II. 10.)|Durham Gospel Fragment]] contains two similar fish-like motifs contained within the lateral stroke of the INI [[monogram]] that introduces the [[Gospel of Mark]].{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974|p=250 n.5}}

==Discovery==
[[File:Benty Grange - geograph.org.uk - 311410.jpg|thumb|alt=Colour photograph of the Benty Grange Farm|Benty Grange Farm, in the parish of [[Monyash]] in the [[Derbyshire Dales]] district]]
The hanging bowl was discovered on 3 May 1848 during an excavation on the [[Benty Grange]] farm in Derbyshire,{{sfn|Bateman|1861|p=28}} in what is now the [[Peak District]] National Park.{{sfn|Lester|1987|p=34}} It was found by [[Thomas Bateman]], an archaeologist and antiquarian who was nicknamed "The Barrow Knight" for his excavation of more than 500 [[tumulus|barrows]].{{sfn|Bateman|1861|p=vi}}{{sfn|Howarth|1899|p=v}} Bateman described Benty Grange as "a high and bleak situation";{{sfn|Bateman|1861|p=28}} its barrow, which still survives, is prominently located by a major Roman road, now the [[A515 road|A515]], possibly in order to display the burial to passing travellers.{{sfn|Brown|2017|p=21}} It may have also been designed to share the skyline with   two other nearby monuments, [[Arbor Low]] [[Stone circles|stone circle]] and [[Gib Hill]] barrow.{{sfn|Brown|2017|p=21}} The Benty Grange barrow comprises a circular central mound approximately {{convert|15|m|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter and {{convert|0.6|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} high, an encircling fosse about {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|0.3|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} deep, and outer penannular banks around {{convert|3|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|0.2|m|ft|abbr=on}} high.{{sfn|Historic England Benty Grange}} The entire structure measures approximately {{convert|23|by|22|m|ft|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Historic England Benty Grange}}

Unnoted in Bateman's account is that he was likely not the first person to dig up the grave.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974|p=229}} The fact that the objects were found in two clusters separated by six feet, and that other objects that normally accompany a helmet were absent, such as a sword and shield, suggests that the grave had previously been looted.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974|p=229}} Being so large it may alternatively or additionally have contained two inhumations, only one of which was discovered by Bateman.{{sfn|Historic England Benty Grange}}

The Benty Grange barrow was designated a [[scheduled monument]] on 23 October 1970.{{sfn|Historic England Benty Grange}} The list entry notes that "[a]lthough the centre of Benty Grange [barrow] has been partially disturbed by excavation, the monument is otherwise undisturbed and retains significant archaeological remains."{{sfn|Historic England Benty Grange}} It goes on to note that further excavation would yield new information.{{sfn|Historic England Benty Grange}} The nearby farm was renovated between 2012 and 2014;{{sfn|Peak District Applications|2012}}{{sfn|BentyGrange Twitter|2014}} as of 2018 it is rented out as a holiday cottage.{{sfn|Peak Venues Benty Grange}}

A '''frontispiece''' in books is a decorative or informative illustration facing a book's [[title page]] — on the left-hand, or [[verso]], page opposite the right-hand, or [[recto]], page.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin H. Silverman, ''Self-Publishing Textbooks and Instructional Materials'', Ch. 9, Atlantic Path Publishing, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; While some books depict thematic elements, other books feature the author's portrait as the frontispiece.  In medieval [[illuminated manuscript]]s, a [[presentation miniature]] showing the book or text being presented (by whom and to whom varies) was often used as a frontispiece.

==Origin==

The word comes from the [[French language|French]] ''frontispice'', or the [[late Latin]] ''frontispicium'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wedgwood|first=Hensleigh|authorlink=Hensleigh Wedgwood|title=On False Etymologies|journal=Transactions of the Philological Society|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3924121;view=1up;seq=78|year=1855|issue=6|pages=68-69}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[Latin]] ''frons'' ('forehead') and ''specere'' ('to look at'). It was [[synonym]]ous with '[[metoposcopy]]'. In English, it was originally used as an [[frontispiece (architecture)|architectural term]], referring to the decorative [[facade]] of a building. In the 17th century, the French term came to refer to the title pages in books, which were often decorated at the time with intricate [[engravings]] that borrowed stylistic elements from architecture, such as [[columns]] and [[pediments]]. Over the course of the 16th century, the title pages of books came to be accompanied by illustrations on the facing page, known as [[Wikt:antiporta|''antiporte'']], and the term took on the meaning it retains today as early as 1682. By then, the English spelling had also morphed, by way of [[folk etymology]], from 'frontispice' to 'frontispiece' ('front' + 'piece').&lt;ref&gt;Michael Quinion,  [http://www.worldwidewords.org/weirdwords/ww-fro1.htm World Wide Words Entry]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7450">'''Cairo Contemporary Dance Center''' ('''CCDC''') is an independent space for [[contemporary dance]] in [[Egypt]]. It’s the first contemporary dance school in Africa and the Middle East, offering a 3-year full-time professional training program for young dancers, choreographers and dance teachers.&lt;ref name="Drosos"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://drosos.org/en/projekte/centre-de-danse-contemporaine-du-caire/|title=Cairo Contemporary Dance Center - drosos(…) Foundation|newspaper=drosos(…)|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also provides artistic residencies, as well as open classes and workshops in different kinds of dance and activities.

==History==
Cairo Contemporary Dance Center was founded in 2012 by [[Karima Mansour]], under the patronage of the Egyptian Ministry of Culture, at the Creativity Center on the ground of [[Cairo Opera House]].&lt;ref name="Up in the Air"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.madamasr.com/en/2013/11/26/feature/culture/contemporary-dance-center-up-in-the-air/|title=Contemporary Dance Center up in the air|newspaper=مدى مصر|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DailyNews"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2013/07/07/contemporary-dance-programme-in-peril/|title=Contemporary dance programme in peril|date=2013-07-07|website=Daily News Egypt|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Right to Dance"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cairoscene.com/ArtsAndCulture/The-Right-to-Dance|title=The Right to Dance|website=Cairo Scene|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It moved to its current location in January 2014, and currently operates as an independent project under the umbrella of MAAT for Contemporary Art.&lt;ref name="Journey"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cairoscene.com/ArtsAndCulture/The-Arduous-Journey-to-An-Egyptian-Contemporary-Dance-Utopia|title=The Arduous Journey to An Egyptian Contemporary Dance Utopia|website=Cairo Scene|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The school==
Cairo Contemporary Dance Center was the first professional contemporary dance full-time school in Africa and the Arab world. The 3-year full-time professional training program is officially recognized by the UNESCO [[International Dance Council]].&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cid-portal.org/site/index.php/2012-01-08-15-56-32/register-of-members/|title=Register of Members|website=www.cid-portal.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The first generation of students graduated in June 2015, and a new generation started the three year program in September 2016.

CCDC welcomes every year a diversity of international and Egyptian teachers, including [[Laurance Rudic]],&lt;ref name="DN"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2013/03/10/the-promising-future-of-contemporary-dance/|title=The promising future of contemporary dance|date=2013-03-10|website=Daily News Egypt|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vincent Mantsoe]],&lt;ref name="Etrigg"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://etrigg.com/location/cairo-contemporary-dance-center-1-mousa-galal-square-mohandesin-12655-cairo-egypt/1152244/|title=Cairo Contemporary Dance Center مركز الرقص المعاصر - 1 Mousa Galal Square Mohandesin 12655 Cairo Egypt {{!}} etrigg.com|website=etrigg.com|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Tompkins (dancer)|Mark Tompkins]], [[Olivier Dubois]],&lt;ref name="Etrigg" /&gt; and [[Claude Brumachon]].&lt;ref name="Etrigg" /&gt;

==Other activities==

In addition to its professional training, CCDC also offers to the general public open classes and workshops for adults and children in several disciplines covering [[dance]], [[martial arts]] and other activities.&lt;ref name="Totally Egypt"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.totallyegypt.com/event/detail.php?id=22561|title=CCDC Open Classes, Workshops and Activities!|website=TotallyEgypt|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Workshops are also regularly organized with invited local and international artists, in different disciplines including [[contemporary dance]], [[contact improvisation]], [[acting]], [[tango]],&lt;ref name="Tango"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cairoscene.com/ArtsAndCulture/A-Taste-of-Tango-in-the-Heart-of-Cair|title=A Taste of Tango in the Heart of Cairo|website=Cairo Scene|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[yoga]].

The '''Cathedral Basilica of Salvador''' (''Catedral Basílica de Salvador''), officially dedicated to the Transfiguration of Christ and named '''''Primatial Cathedral Basilica of the Transfiguration of the Lord''''' is the seat of the [[Archbishop]] of the city of [[Salvador, Brazil|Salvador]], in the [[Bahia, Brazil|State of Bahia]], in [[Brazil]]. The Archbishop of Salvador is also ''ex officio'' '''Primate of Brazil'''.

The [[Diocese of São Salvador da Bahia de Todos os Santos]], the first in the Portuguese [[Colonial Brazil|colony of Brazil]], was created in 1551, only two years after the foundation of Salvador by nobleman [[Tomé de Sousa]]. The first bishop, [[Pero Fernandes Sardinha]], arrived in 1552. A cathedral was built in the centre of Salvador around this time.

In 1676 the city became the seat of an [[Archbishop|archdiocese]]. After 1758, when the [[Jesuit Order]] was [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus|expelled from Brazil]], the former Jesuit church of Salvador became the [[cathedral]] of the city. The building of the [[Old Cathedral of Salvador|former cathedral]]  was demolished in 1933. A scheme of its foundations can be seen on the pavement of the ''Praça da Sé'' (Se Square) in Salvador.

==Art and architecture==
In its origins the present cathedral building was the church of the [[Jesuit Order]] of Salvador. The Jesuits arrived in the city still in the 16th century and built a first church and college. In the second half of the 17th century the Jesuits built a new church - the one that exists today - in the [[Renaissance architecture|Mannerist style]] then fashionable in Portugal. The façade is very similar to contemporary Portuguese churches like the [[New Cathedral of Coimbra|Jesuit Church of Coimbra]].

The façade is made in light ''Lioz'' stone brought from Portugal and is flanked by two short bell towers. It has three portals with statues of Jesuit saints, [[Ignatius of Loyola]], [[Francis Xavier]] and [[Francis Borgia]]. The [[gable]] on the upper storey of the façade is flanked by typical Mannerist [[volute]]s.

[[Image:Salvador-JesuitChurch3-CCBY.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Interior of Cathedral of Salvador towards the main chapel.]]
Inside, the cathedral is a one-[[aisle]]d church of rectangular shape, without [[transept]] and with a very shallow main [[chapel]]. The side walls of the church have a series of lateral chapels decorated with altarpieces. This [[floorplan]] scheme is based on the [[Igreja de São Roque (Lisbon)|Church of São Roque in Lisbon]], the Jesuit church of the Portuguese capital, built a century earlier.

The chapels of the cathedral offer an interesting showcase of [[altarpiece]] art from the late 16th through the mid-18th centuries, all decorated with sculptures and paintings. Very rare are two 16th century [[Renaissance]] altarpieces that belonged to the previous Jesuit church and were reused in the new building. The altarpiece of the main chapel is a fine example of 17th century Mannerist art. Other chapels have [[Baroque]] altarpieces from the mid-18th century. The [[barrel vault]] covering the [[nave]] of the church is decorated with wooden panels dating from the 18th century and displays the Jesuit emblem "[[Christogram|IHS]]".

The [[sacristy]] of the church is richly decorated with Baroque furniture, 17th-century Portuguese tiles ([[azulejo]]s) and ceiling wooden panels painted with Mannerist motifs and portraits of important Jesuits.

The façade and floorplan of the Jesuit church of Salvador influenced several other colonial churches in [[Northeast Brazil]], including the [[São Francisco Church and Convent (Salvador)|São Francisco Church of Salvador]].

==Protected status==

The Cathedral of Salvador was listed as a historic structure by the [[National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage]] in 1938. The structure was registered under the Book of Historical Works, Inscription 77 and Book of Fine Arts, fls. 14. The directive is dated May 25, 1938.&lt;ref name="c"/&gt;

A '''cosmorama''' is an exhibition of [[perspective picture]]s of different places in the world, usually world [[landmark]]s. Careful use of illumination and lenses gives the images greater realism.

Cosmorama was also the name of an entertainment in 19th century London, at 207-209 [[Regent Street]], at which the public could view scenes of distant lands and exotic subjects through optical devices that magnified the pictures. It was later converted into an exhibition of curiosities named the [[Prince of Wales Bazaar]]. Exhibits included a sea lion, a sea serpent and L. Bertolotto's [[Flea circus]].

==Works==
Douglas Moggach has written on [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], [[Hegel]], [[Friedrich Schiller]], [[Bruno Bauer]], [[aesthetics]], [[Republicanism]], and history of ancient and modern political thought.&lt;ref&gt;[http://douglasmoggach.cgpublisher.com/biography.html CGS Publishers Page]&lt;/ref&gt;

Moggach's research falls into three principal areas: analysis of the philosophy, politics, and economic thought of the Hegelian School; the historical development of German idealism from Leibniz to Hegel; and aesthetics and politics. His archival research led to the discovery and publication of lost texts by Bruno Bauer, a leading figure in the Hegelian School of the 1830s and 1840s. Moggach argues that the political thinking of the German Hegelians represents a specific variant of republicanism, which recognizes modern social diversity and alienation.&lt;ref&gt;See also Volker Gerhart's preface to Moggach's volume, Bruno Bauer: Uber die Prinzipien des Schönen.&lt;/ref&gt; His works in German Idealism have focused on the foundational importance of Leibniz for Kant and Hegel, and trace the origins of Kant's juridical thought in the German Enlightenment debates about freedom,  perfection, and state economic direction.&lt;ref&gt;D. Moggach, Freedom and Perfection: German Debates on the State in the Eighteenth Century" Canadian Journal of Political Science, Dec. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Moggach has also published on aesthetics and politics, notably on Schiller and Bauer, developing the concept of an aesthetic republicanism based on an aesthetic version of Kant's moral idea of autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;Moggach, The Philosophy and Politics of Bruno Bauer&lt;/ref&gt; Moggach also traces the relations between German idealism and various strands of Romanticism, and contributes to conceptions of universality, freedom and republicanism in European political thought.&lt;ref&gt;See, Moggach, 2004, Reason, Universality, and History.&lt;/ref&gt; Moggach wrote the chapter on Marx in The Impact of Idealism, ed. N. Boyle and J. Walker, vol. 2 (CUP 2013), and the chapter on Romantic Political Thought in Oxford Companion to European Romanticism, ed. P. Hamilton (OUP, 2016).

Moggach discovered an unpublished manuscript by Bruno Bauer, which had been awarded the Prussian Royal Prize in philosophy by a panel headed by Hegel in 1829.&lt;ref&gt;D. Moggach/Winfried Schulze, Bruno Bauer, De pulchri principiis. Uber die Prinzipien des Schönen, Berlin 1996. Reviewed in Philosophische Rundschau, 43/3, 1996; Owl of Minerva, 30/2, 1999; Studi kantiani, XII, 1999; Revue d’esthétique, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; This manuscript, written in Latin, is held in the archives of the Humboldt Universität, Berlin, but had not been recognized before. Moggach shows how after attending Hegel's lectures on logic in 1828, Bauer applies this logic to the categories of aesthetic judgement that Kant had developed in his Third Critique. Starting from the Hegelian premise of the unity of thought and being, Bauer wants to show that the separation of subject and object in Kant's Critiques of Pure and of Practical Reason remains a feature of the Critique of Judgement. Bauer argues that Kant does make efforts to bridge the gap, and he opens the path that Hegel will follow, but Kant does not finally succeed in this objective. What prevents him from succeeding is his faulty treatment of the categories involved in making aesthetic judgements. Moggach thinks that in this early text Bauer also lays the foundations for his later theory of infinite self-consciousness, and for his specific type of ethical and historical idealism.

Moggach's book, The Philosophy and Politics of Bruno Bauer (CUP, 2003) traces the emergence of German republicanism from philosophical and religious polemics of the 1830s and 1840s, its relation to Kant and Hegel, and its assessment of political and economic change. This work was short-listed for the 2004 C.B. Macpherson Prize, awarded by the Canadian Political Science Association.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cpsa-acsp.ca&lt;/ref&gt; It was reviewed by Frederick Beiser in Times Literary Supplement, 24 September 2004; Choice, Nov. 2004; and other journals.&lt;ref&gt;Times Literary Supplement, 24 September 2004; Philosophy in Review, 24/5, Oct. 2004; Choice, Nov. 2004; Canadian Journal of Political Science, 37/3, 2004; Filosofia politica, 3, Dec. 2003; H-Net, Nov. 2004 &lt;www.h-net.org/reviews&gt;; History of European Ideas, 30/4, 2004; Dialogue (ΦΣΤ), 04/2005; European Journal of Philosophy, 14/1, 2006; Owl of Minerva, 38/ 1-2, 2006-07; Bulletin of the Hegel Society of Great Britain, 57/58, 2008; etc. Review essay, "Philosophie der Krise: Dimensionen der nachhegelschen Reflexion. Neuere Literatur zur Philosophie des Vormärz und der Junghegelianer," Zeitschrift für philosophische Forschung 63, 2009, pp. 313-334.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moggach's edited volume, The New Hegelians (CUP, 2006), is intended to show that after Hegel's death in 1831, members of his school developed his philosophy in new directions in order to understand the evolution of modern society, along with the modern state and economy. The Hegelians were not mere imitators of their teacher, but creative thinkers about modernity and its problems, especially social cohesion and the conflict of individual interests. According to Moggach, many of these New or Young Hegelians found a solution to these conflicts in republican ideas of virtue, rethought so that they are compatible with modern institutions. Moggach applies the idea of republican rigorism, introduced by other historians of political thought, to outline these solutions. For the Hegelians, this concept involves changing the boundaries between morality and legality that Kant had established. Kant had claimed that the legal sphere concerns the external aspects of action alone, but not its motivating principles or maxims. For the Hegelians, though, political action has to promote, or at least not hinder, the external freedom of others, but it must also have the right kinds of internal ethical motivation: this means not acting from private interest, but from an idea of the general good. In this way Kant's idea of autonomy is related to political as well as moral action, and to republican ideas of freedom as non domination.&lt;ref&gt;Reviewed in Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews 2007.05.02 &lt;http://ndpr.nd.edu/reviews.cfm&gt;; British Journal for the History of Philosophy, 15/2, 2007; Journal of the History of Philosophy, 45/4, 2007; Neue politische Literatur, 52/1, 2007; Bulletin of the Hegel Society of Great Britain,59/60, 2009; Foundations of Political Theory www.political-theory.org/books/reviews/moggach.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In a subsequent edited volume, Politics, Religion, and Art: Hegelian Debates (Northwestern UP, 2011), Moggach and his colleagues continue to establish the importance of the Hegelians of the 1830's and 1840's as innovators in theology, aesthetics, and ethics, and as creative contributors to foundational debates about modernity, state, and society. The political significance of religious and aesthetic debates, and the German contributions to republican political thought, receive further attention in this volume, which also draws heavily on archival material.

Moggach, Beiser, and other interlocutors debated Schiller's republicanism in a special issue of Inquiry (2008).&lt;ref&gt;Inquiry, Vol. 51 no. 1, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Moggach produced a critical discussion of multiculturalism, in a published conversation with [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]], [[Jeremy Waldron]], [[James Tully (philosopher)|James Tully]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;[[Omid Payrow Shabani]], ed., Multiculturalism and the Law: A Critical Debate, University of Wales Press, Cardiff, 2007; review here: {{cite web|url=http://www.bsos.umd.edu/gvpt/lpbr/reviews/2009/03/multiculturalism-and-law-critical.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607152453/http://www.bsos.umd.edu/gvpt/lpbr/reviews/2009/03/multiculturalism-and-law-critical.html |archivedate=7 June 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Emamzadeh Ahmad'''({{lang-fa|امامزاده احمد}}) is an [[imamzadeh]] in [[Isfahan]], [[Iran]]. The emamzadeh comprises a [[tomb]], to the north and west of which are two ''[[iwan]]s''; the tomb faces a vast yard where several famous people, like [[Amir Kabir]]'s daughter and [[Naser al-Din Shah Qajar|Naser al-Din Shah]]'s sister and wife, are buried. The emamzadeh himself was likely the [[Sultan Ali]]'s son, who has been buried in [[Mashhad-e Ardehal]].&lt;ref name="Rāhnamā 2004, p. 117"&gt;'{{cite book|first=Hosseyn |last=Yaghoubi|title=Rāhnamā ye Safar be Ostān e Esfāhān |trans-title=Travel Guide for the Province Isfahan|publisher=Rouzane|isbn=964-334-218-2|editor-first=Beheshti |editor-last=Arash|page=117|language=Persian|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest part of the structure is a single piece of white stone, which is {{Convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on}} long. The stone is placed under a wooden reticulated window  facing [[alley]]. It is said, that it is a piece of [[Somnath]] stone.&lt;ref name="Rāhnamā 2004, p. 117"/&gt; About the Somnath stone Jaberi Ansari has written in the history of Isfahan and [[Rey, Iran|Rey]] as follows:

''"[[Mahmud of Ghazni]] brought a stone as a souvenir from Somnath in India. It is said that it had been a part of the most important [[Idolatry|idol]] in that land. This stone was transferred to Isfahan and a century later it was cut in half  and made a stone trough from one half in Vazir Tahmasb school and the other half was dragged on the ground (for demonstrating the abjection of the idol) and then it was taken to emamzadeh Ahmad."''&lt;ref name="Rāhnamā 2004, p. 117"/&gt;

Emamzadeh Ahmad was built in [[Seljukid]] era, but the present structure belongs to [[Safavid]] age. The ceiling of the [[mausoleum]] is covered by [[Muqarnas]] works. Around the [[sepulcher]] there is a poem in golden [[Nastaliq script]], in which [[Mass'oud Mirza Zell-e Soltan|Zellossoltan]] has mentioned repairments and revampings of this structure by him.&lt;ref name="Rāhnamā 2004, p. 117"/&gt;

Unlike few decorations of the [[imamzadeh]]'s [[tomb]], the tomb of [[Amir Kabir]]'s daughter and [[Naser al-Din Shah Qajar]]'s sister and wife have been fully decorated with [[stucco]], [[painting]] and mirror decoration.

'''Entasis''' is a [[Denmark|Danish]] architecture firm based in [[Copenhagen]]. It takens its name from  the Greek word for tension.

==History==
Entasis was founded  by Christian and Signe Cold in 1996. Their first building, a new main entrance for [[Copenhagen Zoo]], was awarded the AIA Prize 'Best Building in Europe 1998'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-architect.co.uk/architects/entasis.htm|title=Entasis|publisher=e-architects|accessdate=2011-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2007 the firm won the open international competition for the redevelopment of the former [[Carlsberg Group|Carlsberg]] brewery site in Copenhagen, with a proposal which, in reaction to [[Modernist architecture|Modernist]] planning, relied on dense, [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] town centres for inspiration. An emphasis on physical density and the [[human scale]] are characteristic of their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldarchitecturenews.com/index.php?fuseaction=wanappln.projectview&amp;upload_id=12836|title=A city for the people|publisher=World Architecture News|accessdate=2010-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same trend is seen in their entry for the Søtorvet competition in [[Silkeborg]] which they won in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.silkeborgkommune.dk/kommunen/presserum/pressemeddelelser/pressemeddelelser+2010/december/byens+have+vandt+arkitektkonkurrence+om+s%C3%B8torvet |title=Byens Have vandt arkitektkonkurrence om Søtorvet |publisher=Silkeborg |language=Danish |accessdate=2011-05-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929031755/http://www.silkeborgkommune.dk/kommunen/presserum/pressemeddelelser/pressemeddelelser+2010/december/byens+have+vandt+arkitektkonkurrence+om+s%C3%B8torvet |archivedate=2011-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following '''translation of the [[Behistun Inscription]]''' was made by L.W. King and R.C. Thompson &lt;ref&gt;''The sculptures and inscription of Darius the Great on the rock of Behistûn in Persia'', 1907 London. (I&lt;!--I, who?--&gt; have made some minor changes and added the titles of the sections.)&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;Where names are rendered by the Greek or Biblical form, the Persian original regularly follows in square brackets. The letter "x" in Persian transcription represents the "kh" sound, like German "ch" as pronounced after "a", "o" or "u" in German.

==Column one==

===Introduction: Darius's titles and the extent of his empire===
[[File:Darius I the Great's inscription.jpg|thumb|300px|Modern photograph of the [[Behistun inscription]].]]
* (1) I am [[Darius I of Persia|Darius]] [Dâryavuš], the [[great king]], [[king of kings]], the king of Persia [Pârsa], the king of countries, the son of [[Hystaspes (father of Darius I)|Hystaspes]], the grandson of [[Arsames]], the Achaemenid.
* (2) King [[Darius I of Persia|Darius]] says: My father is [[Hystaspes (father of Darius I)|Hystaspes]] [Vištâspa]; the father of [[Hystaspes (father of Darius I)|Hystaspes]] was [[Arsames]] [Aršâma]; the father of [[Arsames]] was [[Ariaramnes]] [Ariyâramna]; the father of [[Ariaramnes]] was [[Teispes]] [Cišpiš]; the father of [[Teispes]] was [[Achaemenes]] [Haxâmaniš].
* (3) King [[Darius I of Persia|Darius]] says: That is why we are called Achaemenids; from antiquity we have been noble; from antiquity has our dynasty been royal.
* (4) King [[Darius I of Persia|Darius]] says: Eight of my dynasty were kings before me; I am the ninth. Nine in succession we have been kings.
* (5) King [[Darius I of Persia|Darius]] says: By the grace of [[Ahuramazda]] am I king; [[Ahuramazda]] has granted me the kingdom.
* (6) King [[Darius I of Persia|Darius]] says: These are the countries which are subject unto me, and by the grace of [[Ahuramazda]] I became king of them: [[Persia]] [Pârsa], [[Elam]] [Ûvja], [[Babylonia]] [Bâbiruš], [[Assyria]] [Athurâ], [[Arabia]] [Arabâya], [[Egypt]] [Mudrâya], the countries by the Sea, [[Lydia]] [Sparda], [[Ionia|the Greeks]] [Yauna ([[Ionia]])], [[Medes|Media]] [Mâda], [[Armenia]] [Armina], [[Cappadocia]] [Katpatuka], [[Parthia]] [Parthava], [[Drangiana]] [Zraka], [[Aria (satrapy)|Aria]] [Haraiva], [[Chorasmia]] [Uvârazmîy], [[Bactria]] [Bâxtriš], [[Sogdia]] [Suguda], [[Gandhara]] [Gadâra], [[Skudra|Scythia]] [Saka], [[Sattagydia]] [Thataguš], [[Arachosia]] [Harauvatiš] and [[Maka (satrapy)|Maka]] [Maka]; twenty-three lands in all.
* (7) King [[Darius I of Persia|Darius]] says: These are the countries which are subject to me; by the grace of [[Ahuramazda]] they became subject to me; they brought tribute unto me. Whatsoever commands have been laid on them by me, by night or by day, have been performed by them.
* (8) King [[Darius I of Persia|Darius]] says: Within these lands, whosoever was a friend, him have I surely protected; whosoever was hostile, him have I utterly destroyed. By the grace of [[Ahuramazda]] these lands have conformed to my decrees; as it was commanded unto them by me, so was it done.
* (9) King [[Darius I of Persia|Darius]] says: [[Ahuramazda]] has granted unto me [[Achaemenid Empire|this empire]]. [[Ahuramazda]] brought me help, until I gained this empire; by the grace of [[Ahuramazda]] do I hold this empire.

===Murder of Smerdis and coup of Gaumâta the Magian===

* (10) King [[Darius I of Persia|Darius]] says: The following is what was done by me after I became king. A son of [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]] [Kûruš], named [[Cambyses]] [Kabûjiya], one of our dynasty, was king here before me. That [[Cambyses]] had a brother, [[Smerdis]] [Bardiya] by name, of the same mother and the same father as [[Cambyses]]. Afterwards, [[Cambyses]] slew this [[Smerdis]]. When [[Cambyses]] slew [[Smerdis]], it was not known unto the people that [[Smerdis]] was slain. Thereupon [[Cambyses]] went to [[Egypt]]. When [[Cambyses]] had departed into [[Egypt]], the people became hostile, and the lie multiplied in the land, even in [[Persia]] and [[Medes|Media]], and in the other provinces.
* (11) King [[Darius I of Persia|Darius]] says: Afterwards, there was a certain man, a [[Magian]] [maguš], [[Gaumâta]] by name, who raised a rebellion in [[Paishiyauvada]], in a mountain called [[Arakadriš]]. On the fourteenth day of the month [[Viyaxana]] (11 March 522 BCE) did he rebel. He lied to the people, saying: 'I am [[Smerdis]], the son of Cyrus, the brother of [[Cambyses]].' Then were all the people in revolt, and from [[Cambyses]] they went over unto him, both [[Persia]] and [[Medes|Media]], and the other provinces. He seized the kingdom; on the ninth day of the month [[Garmapada]] (1 July 522 BCE) he seized the kingdom. Afterwards, Cambyses died of natural causes.
* (12) King [[Darius I of Persia|Darius]]  says: The kingdom of which [[Gaumâta]], the [[Magian]], dispossessed [[Cambyses]], had always belonged to our dynasty. After that [[Gaumâta]], the [[Magian]], had dispossessed [[Cambyses]] of [[Persia]] and [[Medes|Media]], and of the other provinces, he did according to his will. He became king.

===Darius  kills Gaumâta and restores the kingdom===

* (13) King [[Darius I of Persia|Darius]] says: There was no man, either [[Persian people|Persian]] or [[Medes|Mede]] or of our own dynasty, who took the kingdom from [[Gaumâta]], the [[Magian]]. The people feared him exceedingly, for he slew many who had known the real [[Smerdis]]. For this reason did he slay them, 'that they may not know that I am not [[Smerdis]], the son of Cyrus.' There was none who dared to act against [[Gaumâta]], the [[Magian]], until I came. Then I prayed to [[Ahuramazda]]; [[Ahuramazda]] brought me help. On the tenth day of the month [[Bâgayâdiš]] (29 September 522 BCE) I, with a few men, slew that [[Gaumâta]], the [[Magian]], and the chief men who were his followers. At the stronghold called [[Sikayauvatiš]], in the district called [[Nisaia]] in [[Medes|Media]], I slew him; I dispossessed him of the kingdom. By the grace of [[Ahuramazda]] I became king; [[Ahuramazda]] granted me the kingdom.
* (14) King [[Darius I of Persia|Darius]] says: The kingdom that had been wrested from our line I brought back and I reestablished it on its foundation. The temples which [[Gaumâta]], the [[Magian]], had destroyed, I restored to the people, and the pasture lands, and the herds and the dwelling places, and the houses which [[Gaumâta]], the [[Magian]], had taken away. I settled the people in their place, the people of [[Persia]], and [[Medes|Media]], and the other provinces. I restored that which had been taken away, as it was in the days of old. This did I by the grace of [[Ahuramazda]], I labored until I had established our dynasty in its place, as in the days of old; I labored, by the grace of [[Ahuramazda]], so that [[Gaumâta]], the [[Magian]], did not dispossess our house.
* (15) King [[Darius I of Persia|Darius]] says: This was what I did after I became king.

===Rebellions of Âššina of Elam and Nidintu-Bêl of Babylon===
[[File:Achaemenid Empire.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Achaemenid empire at its greatest extent]]

* (16) King [[Darius I of Persia|Darius]] says: After I had slain [[Gaumâta]], the [[Magian]], a certain man named [[Âššina]], the son of [[Upadarma]], raised a rebellion in [[Elam]], and he spoke thus unto the people of [[Elam]]: 'I am king in [[Elam]].' Thereupon the people of [[Elam]] became rebellious, and they went over unto that [[Âššina]]: he became king in [[Elam]]. And a certain [[Babylon]]ian named [[Nidintu-Bêl]], the son of [[Kîn-Zêr]], raised a rebellion in [[Babylon]]: he lied to the people, saying: 'I am [[Nebuchadnezzar IV|Nebuchadnezzar]], the son of [[Nabonidus]].' Then did all the province of [[Babylonia]] go over to [[Nidintu-Bêl]], and [[Babylonia]] rose in rebellion. He seized on the kingdom of [[Babylonia]] (3 October 522 BC).
* (17) King [[Darius I of Persia|Darius]] says: Then I sent (an envoy?) to [[Elam]]. That [[Âššina]] was brought unto me in fetters, and I killed him.
* (18) King [[Darius I of Persia|Darius]] says: Then I marched against that [[Nidintu-Bêl]], who called himself [[Nebuchadnezzar]]. The army of [[Nidintu-Bêl]] held the [[Tigris]]; there it took its stand, and on account of the waters (the river) was unfordable. Thereupon I supported my army on (inflated) skins, others I made dromedary-borne, for the rest I brought horses. [[Ahuramazda]] brought me help; by the grace of [[Ahuramazda]] we crossed the [[Tigris]]. Then did I utterly overthrow that host of [[Nidintu-Bêl]]. On the twenty-sixth day of the month [[Âçiyâdiya]] (13 December 522 BCE) we joined battle.
* (19) King [[Darius I of Persia|Darius]] says: After that I marched against [[Babylon]]. But before I reached [[Babylon]], that [[Nidintu-Bêl]], who called himself [[Nebuchadnezzar]], came with a host and offered battle at a city called [[Zâzâna]], on the [[Euphrates]]. Then we joined battle. [[Ahuramazda]] brought me help; by the grace of [[Ahuramazda]] did I utterly overthrow the host of [[Nidintu-Bêl]]. The enemy fled into the water; the water carried them away. On the second day of the month [[Anâmaka]] (18 December 522 BCE) we joined battle.

==Column two==

* (20) King [[Darius I of Persia|Darius]] says: Then did [[Nidintu-Bêl]] flee with a few horsemen into [[Babylon]]. Thereupon I marched to [[Babylon]]. By the grace of [[Ahuramazda]] I took [[Babylon]], and captured [[Nidintu-Bêl]]. Then I slew that [[Nidintu-Bêl]] in [[Babylon]].
* (21) King [[Darius I of Persia|Darius]] says: While I was in [[Babylon]], these provinces revolted from me: [[Persia]], [[Elam]], [[Medes|Media]], [[Assyria]], [[Egypt]], [[Parthia]], [[Margiana]] [Marguš], [[Sattagydia]] [Thataguš], and [[Scythia]] [Saka].

===Revolt of Martiya of Elam===

* (22) King [[Darius I of Persia|Darius]] says: A certain man named [[Martiya]], the son of [[Zinzakriš]], dwelt in a city in [[Persia]] called [[Kuganakâ]]. This man revolted in [[Elam]], and he said to the people: 'I am [[Ummaniš]], king in [[Elam]].'
* (23) King [[Darius I of Persia|Darius]] says: At that time, I was friendly with [[Elam]]. Then there were [[Elamites]] afraid of me, and that [[Martiya]], who was their leader, they seized and slew.
[[File:BehistunInscriptionSketch.jpg|thumb|300px|The '''Behistun Inscription''', carved into a cliffside, gives the same text in three languages, telling the story of [[Darius I of Persia|King Darius']] conquests, with the names of 23 provinces subject to him.  It is illustrated by life-sized carved images of King Darius with other figures in attendance.]]

=== Revolt of Phraortes of Media ===

* (24) King [[Darius I of Persia|Darius]] says: A certain [[Medes|Mede]] named [[Phraortes]] [Fravartiš] revolted in [[Medes|Media]], and he said to the people: 'I am [[Khshathrita]], of the family of [[Cyaxares]].' Then did the [[Medes]] who were in the palace revolt from me and go over to [[Phraortes]]. He became king in [[Medes|Media]].
* (25) King [[Darius I of Persia|Darius]] says: The [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] and [[Medes|Median]] army, which was with me, was small. Yet I sent forth an(other) army. A [[Persian people|Persian]] named [[Hydarnes]], my servant, I made their leader, and I said unto him: 'Go, smite that [[Medes|Median]] host which does not acknowledge me.' Then [[Hydarnes]] marched forth with the army. When he had come to [[Medes|Media]], at a city in [[Medes|Media]] called [[Maruš]], he gave battle to the [[Medes]]. He who was chief among the [[Medes]] was not there at that time. [[Ahuramazda]] brought me help: by the grace of [[Ahuramazda]] my army utterly defeated that rebel host. On the twenty-seventh day of the month [[Anâmaka]] (12 January 521 BCE) the battle was fought by them. Then did my army await me in a district in [[Medes|Media]] called [[Kampanda]], until I came into [[Medes|Media]].

===Revolt of the Armenians===

* (26) King [[Darius I of Persia|Darius]] says: An [[Armenians|Armenian]] named [[Dâdarši]], my servant, I sent into [[Armenia]], and I said unto him: 'Go, smite that  host which is in revolt and does not acknowledge me.' Then [[Dâdarši]] went forth. When he came into [[Armenia]], the rebels assembled and advanced against [[Dâdarši]] to give him battle. At a place in [[Armenia]] called [[Zuzza]] they fought the battle. [[Ahuramazda]] brought me help; by the grace of [[Ahuramazda]] did my army utterly overthrow that rebel host. On the eighth day of the month [[Thûravâhara]] (20 May 521 BCE) the battle was fought by them.
* (27) King [[Darius I of Persia|Darius]] says: The rebels assembled for the second time, and they advanced against [[Dâdarši]] to give him battle. At a stronghold in [[Armenia]] called Tigra they joined battle. [[Ahuramazda]] brought me help; by the grace of [[Ahuramazda]] did my army utterly overthrow that rebel host. On the eighteenth day of the month [[Thûravâhara]] (30 May 521 BCE) the battle was fought by them.
* (28) King [[Darius I of Persia|Darius]] says: The rebels assembled for the third time and advanced against [[Dâdarši]] to give him battle. At a stronghold in [[Armenia]] called [[Uyamâ]] they joined battle. [[Ahuramazda]] brought me help; by the grace of [[Ahuramazda]] did my army utterly overthrow that rebel host. On the ninth day of the month [[Thâigaciš]] (20 June 521 BCE) the battle was fought by them. Then [[Dâdarši]] waited for me in [[Armenia]], until I came into [[Armenia]].
* (29) King [[Darius I of Persia|Darius]] says: A [[Persian people|Persian]] named [[Vaumisa]], my servant, I sent into [[Armenia]], and I said unto him: 'Go, smite that  host which is in revolt, and does not acknowledge me.' Then [[Vaumisa]] went forth. When he had come to [[Armenia]], the rebels assembled and advanced against [[Vaumisa]] to give him battle. At a place in [[Assyria]] called [[Izalâ]] they joined battle. [[Ahuramazda]] brought me help; by the grace of [[Ahuramazda]] did my army utterly overthrow that rebel host. On the fifteenth day of the month [[Anâmaka]] (31 December 522 BCE) the battle was fought by them.
* (30) King [[Darius I of Persia|Darius]] says: The rebels assembled a second time and advanced against [[Vaumisa]] to give him battle. At a place in [[Armenia]] called [[Autiyâra]] they joined battle. [[Ahuramazda]] brought me help; by the grace of [[Ahuramazda]] did my army utterly overthrow that rebel host. At the end of the month [[Thûravâhara]] (11 June 521 BCE) the battle was fought by them. Then [[Vaumisa]] waited for me in [[Armenia]], until I came into [[Armenia]].

===End of the revolt of the Medes===

* (31) King [[Darius I of Persia|Darius]] says: Then I went forth from [[Babylon]] and came into [[Medes|Media]]. When I had come to [[Medes|Media]], that [[Phraortes]] [Fravartiš], who called himself king in [[Medes|Media]], came against me unto a city in [[Medes|Media]] called [[Kunduruš]] ([[Kangâvar]]?) to offer battle. Then we joined battle. [[Ahuramazda]] brought me help; by the grace of [[Ahuramazda]] did my army utterly overthrow that rebel host. On the twenty-fifth day of the month [[Adukanaiša]](8 May 521 BCE) we fought the battle.
* (32) King [[Darius I of Persia|Darius]] says: Thereupon that [[Phraortes]] fled thence with a few horseman to a district in [[Medes|Media]] called [[Rhagae]] [Ragâ]. Then I sent an army in pursuit. [[Phraortes]] was taken and brought unto me. I cut off his nose, his ears, and his tongue, and I put out one eye, and he was kept in fetters at my palace entrance, and all the people beheld him. Then did I crucify him in [[Ecbatana]] [Hagmatâna]; and the men who were his foremost followers, those at [[Ecbatana]] within the fortress, I flayed and hung out their hides, stuffed with straw.
* (33) King [[Darius I of Persia|Darius]] says: A man named [[Tritantaechmes]] [Ciçataxma], a [[Sagartian]], revolted from me, saying to his people: 'I am king in [[Sagartia]] [Asagarta], of the family of [[Cyaxares]].' Then I sent forth a [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] and a [[Medes|Median]] army. A Mede named [[Takhmaspâda]], my servant, I made their leader, and I said unto him: 'Go, smite that  host which is in revolt, and does not acknowledge me.' Thereupon [[Takhmaspâda]] went forth with the army, and he fought a battle with [[Tritantaechmes]]. [[Ahuramazda]] brought me help; by the grace of [[Ahuramazda]] my army utterly defeated that rebel host, and they seized [[Tritantaechmes]] and brought him unto me. Afterwards I cut off both his nose and ears, and put out one eye, he was kept bound at my palace entrance, all the people saw him. Afterwards I crucified him in [[Battle of Gaugamela|Arbela]].
* (34) King [[Darius I of Persia|Darius]] says: This is what was done by me in [[Medes|Media]].

===Revolt of the Parthians===

* (35) King [[Darius I of Persia|Darius]] says: The [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]] [Parthava] and [[Hyrcanians]] [Varkâna] revolted from me, and they declared themselves on the side of [[Phraortes]] [Fravarta]. My father [[Hystaspes (father of Darius I)|Hystaspes]] was in [[Parthia]]; and the people forsook him; they became rebellious. Then [[Hystaspes (father of Darius I)|Hystaspes]] [Vištâspa] marched forth with the troops which had remained faithful.

===Revolt of Frâda of Margiana===
* (38) King Darius says: The province called [[Margiana]] [Marguš] revolted against me. A certain Margian named Frâda they made their leader. Then sent I against him a [[Persia]]n named Dâdarši, my servant, who was satrap of Bactria [Bâxtriya], and I said unto him: 'Go, smite that  host which does not acknowledge me.' Then Dâdarši went forth with the army, and gave battle to the Margians. [[Ahuramazda]] brought me help; by the grace of Ahuramazda my army utterly overthrew that rebel host. Of the twenty-third day of the month Âçiyâdiya (28 December 521 BCE) was the battle fought by them.
* (39) King Darius says: Then was the province mine. This is what was done by me in Bactria.

===Revolt of Vahyazdâta of Persia===

* (40) King Darius [Dâryavuš] says: A certain man named Vahyazdâta dwelt in a city called Târavâ in a district in Persia called Vautiyâ. This man rebelled for the second time in Persia, and thus he spoke unto the people: 'I am [[Smerdis]] [Bardiya], the son of Cyrus [Kûruš].' Then the Persian people who were in the palace fell away from allegiance. They revolted from me and went over to that Vahyazdâta. He became king in Persia.
* (41) King Darius says: Then did I send out the Persian and the Median army which was with me. A Persian named Artavardiya, my servant, I made their leader. The rest of the Persian army came unto me in [[Medes|Media]]. Then went Artavardiya with the army unto Persia. When he came to Persia, at a city in Persia called Rakhâ, that Vahyazdâta, who called himself [[Smerdis]], advanced with the army against Artavardiya to give him battle. They then fought the battle. Ahuramazda brought me help; by the grace of Ahuramazda my host utterly overthrew the army of Vahyazdâta. On the twelfth day of the month Thûravâhara (24 May 521 BCE) was the battle fought by them.
* (42) King Darius says: Then that Vahyazdâta fled thence with a few horsemen unto Pishiyâuvâda. From that place he went forth with an army a second time against Artavardiya to give him battle. At a mountain called Parga they fought the battle. Ahuramazda brought me help; by the grace of Ahuramazda my host utterly overthrew the army of Vahyazdâta. On the fifth day of the month Garmapada (15 July 521 BCE) was the battle fought by them. And they seized that Vahyazdâta, and the men who were his chief followers were also seized.
* (43) King Darius says: Then did I [[crucify]] that Vahyazdâta and the men who were his chief followers in a city in Persia called Uvâdaicaya.
* (44) King Darius says: This is what was done by me in Persia.
* (45) King Darius says: That Vahyazdâta, who called himself [[Smerdis]], sent men to [[Arachosia]] [Harauvati] against a Persian named Vivâna, my servant, the [[satrap]] of Arachosia. He appointed a certain man to be their leader, and thus he spoke to him, saying: 'Go smite Vivâna and the host which acknowledges king Darius!' Then that army that Vahyazdâta had sent marched against Vivâna to give him battle. At a fortress called Kapiša-kaniš [= [[Kandahar]] ] they fought the battle. Ahuramazda brought me help; by the grace of Ahuramazda my army utterly overthrew that rebel host. On the thirteenth day of the month Anâmaka (29 December 522 BCE) was the battle fought by them.
* (46) King Darius says: The rebels assembled a second time and went out against Vivâna to give him battle. At a place called Gandutava they fought a battle. Ahuramazda brought me help; by the grace of Ahuramazda my army utterly overthrew that rebel host. On the seventh day of the month Viyaxana (21 February 521 BCE) the battle was fought by them.
* (47) King Darius says: The man who was commander of that army that Vahyazdâta had sent forth against Vivâna fled thence with a few horsemen. They went to a fortress in Arachosia called Aršâdâ. Then Vivâna with the army marched after them on foot. There he seized him, and he slew the men who were his chief followers.
* (48) King Darius says: Then was the province mine. This is what was done by me in Arachosia.

===Arakha Second Babylonian revolt===

* (49) King Darius says: While I was in Persia and in Media, the Babylonians revolted from me a second time. A certain man named [[Arakha]], an Armenian, son of Haldita, rebelled in Babylon. At a place called Dubâla, he lied unto the people, saying: 'I am Nabû-kudurrī-Aṣur (Nebuchadnezzar), the son of Nabonidus.' Then did the Babylonian people revolt from me and they went over to that Arakha. He seized Babylon, he became king in Babylon.
* (50) King Darius says: Then did I send an army unto Babylon. A Persian named Intaphrenes [Vidafarnâ], my servant, I appointed as their leader, and thus I spoke unto them: 'Go, smite that  Babylonian host which does not acknowledge me.' Then Intaphrenes marched with the army unto Babylon. Ahuramazda brought me help; by the grace of Ahuramazda Intaphrenes overthrew the Babylonians and brought over the people unto me. On the twenty-second day of the month Markâsanaš (27 November) they seized that Arakha who called himself Nebuchadnezzar, and the men who were his chief followers. Then I made a decree, saying: 'Let that Arakha and the men who were his chief followers be crucified in Babylon!'

===Summary===
* (52) King Darius says: This is what I have done. By the grace of [[Ahuramazda]] have I always acted. After I became king, I fought nineteen battles in a single year and by the grace of Ahuramazda I overthrew nine kings and I made them captive.
:*One was named Gaumâta, the [[Magian]]; he lied, saying 'I am [[Smerdis]] [Bardiya], the son of Cyrus [Kûruš].' He made Persia to revolt.
:*Another was named Âššina, the [[Elam]]ite [Ûvjiya]; he lied, saying: 'I am king the king of Elam.' He made Elam to revolt.
:*Another was named Nidintu-Bêl [Naditabaira], the [[Babylonia]]n [Bâbiruviya]; he lied, saying: 'I am [[Nebuchadnezzar]] [Nabukudracara], the son of [[Nabonidus]] [Nabunaita].' He made [[Babylon]] to revolt.
:*Another was named Martiya, the Persian; he lied, saying: 'I am Ummanniš, the king of [[Elam]].' He made Elam to revolt.
:*Another was [[Phraortes]] [Fravartiš], the Mede [Mâda]; he lied, saying:  'I am Khshathrita, of the dynasty of [[Cyaxares]] [Uvaxštra].' He made Media to revolt.
:*Another was [[Tritantaechmes]] [Ciçataxma], the [[Sagartians|Sagartian]] [Asagartiya]; he lied, saying: 'I am king in Sagartia, of the dynasty of [[Cyaxares]] [Uvaxštra].' He made Sagartia to revolt.
:*Another was named Frâda, of [[Margiana]]; he lied, saying: 'I am king of Margiana [Marguš].' He made Margiana to revolt.
:*Another was Vahyazdâta, a Persian; he lied, saying: 'I am Smerdis [Bardiya], the son of Cyrus [Kûruš].' He made Persia to revolt.
:*Another was [[Nebuchadnezzar_IV|Arakha]], an [[Armenia]]n [Arminiya]; he lied, saying: 'I am [[Nebuchadnezzar]], [Nabu-kudra-asura], son of [[Nabonidus]].' He made [[Babylon]] to revolt.

* (53) King Darius says: These nine kings did I capture in these wars.
* (54) King Darius says: As to these provinces which revolted, lies made them revolt, so that they deceived the people. Then Ahuramazda delivered them into my hand; and I did unto them according to my will.
* (55) King Darius says: You who shall be king hereafter, protect yourself vigorously from lies; punish the liars well, if thus you shall think, 'May my country be secure!'

===Affirmation of the truth of the record===

* (56) King Darius says: This is what I have done, by the grace of Ahuramazda have I always acted. Whosoever shall read this inscription hereafter, let that which I have done be believed. You must not hold it to be lies.
* (57) King Darius says: I call Ahuramazda to witness that is true and not lies; all of it have I done in a single year.
* (58) King Darius says: By the grace of Ahuramazda I did much more, which is not graven in this inscription. On this account it has not been inscribed lest he who shall read this inscription hereafter should then hold that which has been done by me to be excessive and not believe it and takes it to be lies.

===Affirmation that it is pious to make known the record===

* (59) King Darius says: Those who were the former kings, as long as they lived, by them was not done thus as by the favor of Ahuramazda was done by me in one and the same year.
* (60) King Darius says: Now let what has been done by me convince you. For the sake of the people, do not conceal it. If you do not conceal this edict but if you publish it to the world, then may Ahuramazda be your friend, may your family be numerous, and may you live long.
* (61) King Darius says: If you conceal this edict and do not publish it to the world, may Ahuramazda slay you and may your house cease.
* (62) King Darius says: This is what I have done in one single year; by the grace of Ahuramazda have I always acted. Ahuramazda brought me help, and the other gods, all that there are.

===The importance of righteousness===

* (63) King Darius says: On this account Ahuramazda brought me help, and all the other gods, all that there are, because I was not wicked, nor was I a liar, nor was I a despot, neither I nor any of my family. I have ruled according to righteousness. Neither to the weak nor to the powerful did I do wrong. Whosoever helped my house, him I favored; he who was hostile, him I destroyed.
* (64) King Darius says: You who may be king hereafter, whosoever shall be a liar or a rebel, or shall not be friendly, punish him!

===Blessings and curses===

* (65) King Darius says: You who shall hereafter see this tablet, which I have written, or these sculptures, do not destroy them, but preserve them so long as you live!
* (66) King Darius says: If you shall behold this inscription or these sculptures, and shall not destroy them, but shall preserve them as long as your line endures, then may Ahuramazda be your friend, and may your family be numerous. Live long, and may Ahuramazda make fortunate whatsoever you do.
* (67) King Darius says: If you shall behold this inscription or these sculptures, and shall destroy them and shall not preserve them so long as your line endures, may Ahuramazda slay you, may your family come to nought, and may Ahuramazda destroy whatever you do!
* (68) King Darius says: These are the men who were with me when I slew Gaumâta the [[Magian]] [maguš], who was called [[Smerdis]] [Bardiya]; then these men helped me as my followers:
:*Intaphrenes [Vidafarnâ], son of Vayâspâra, a Persian;
:*Otanes [Utâna], son of Thukhra [Thuxra], a Persian;
:*Gobryas [Gaubaruva], son of Mardonius [Marduniya], a Persian;
:*Hydarnes [Vidarna], son of Bagâbigna, a Persian;
:*Megabyzus [Bagabuxša], son of Dâtuvahya, a Persian;
:*Ardumaniš, son of Vakauka, a Persian.

* (69) King Darius says: You who may be king hereafter, protect the family of these men.
* (70) King Darius says: By the grace of Ahuramazda this is the inscription which I have made. Besides, it was in [[Aryan]] script, and it was composed on [[clay tablet]]s and on [[parchment]]. Besides, a sculptured figure of myself I made. Besides, I made my lineage. And it was inscribed and was read off before me. Afterwards this inscription I sent off everywhere among the [[province]]s. The people unitedly worked upon it.

==Column five==

===A new rebellion on Elam (Autumn 521 BCE)===

* (71) King Darius says: The following is what I did in the second and third year of my rule. The province called Elam [Ûvja] revolted from me. An [[Elam]]ite named Atamaita they made their leader. Then I sent an army unto Elam. A Persian named [[Gobryas]] [Gaubaruva], my servant, I made their leader. Then Gobryas set forth with the army; he delivered battle against the Elamites. Then Gobryas destroyed many of the host and that Atamaita, their leader, he captured, and he brought him unto me, and I killed him. Then the province became mine.
* (72) King Darius says:  Those [[Elam]]ites were faithless and Ahuramazda was not worshipped by them. I worshipped Ahuramazda; by the grace of Ahuramazda I did unto them according to my will.
* (73) King Darius says: Whoso shall worship Ahuramazda, divine blessing will be upon him, both while living and when dead.

===War against the Scythians (520/519 BCE)===

* (74) King Darius says: Afterwards with an army I went off to [[Scythia]], after the Scythians who wear the pointed cap. These Scythians went from me. When I arrived at the river, I crossed beyond it then with all my army. Afterwards, I smote the Scythians exceedingly; [one of their leaders] I took captive; he was led bound to me, and I killed him. [Another] chief of them, by name Skunkha, they seized and led to me. Then I made another their chief, as was my desire. Then the province became mine.
* (75) King [[Darius the Great|Darius]] says: Those [[Scythians]] [Sakâ] were faithless and Ahuramazda was not worshipped by them. I worshipped Ahuramazda; by the grace of Ahuramazda I did unto them according to my will.
* (76) King Darius says: Whoso shall worship [[Ahuramazda]], divine blessing will be upon him, both while living and when dead.

[[File:Gabrielle Enthoven by George Charles Beresford 1904.jpg|thumb|upright|Gabrielle Enthoven, photography by [[George Charles Beresford]], 1904]]
'''Gabrielle Enthoven [[OBE]]''' (born Augusta Gabrielle Eden Romaine, 12 January 1868 – 18 August 1950) was an English playwright, amateur actress, theatre archivist, and prolific collector of theatrical [[ephemera]] relating to the London stage. In 1911, Enthoven began campaigning for the establishment of a theatrical section in one of the British museums. In 1924, the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] accepted her private collection, at this time containing over 80,000 theatrical [[programme (booklet)|playbills]] and programmes.&lt;ref&gt;James Laver 'Gabrielle Enthoven and the Enthoven Theatre Collection' in ''Studies in English Theatre History'' (London: Society for Theatre Research, 1952), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The material became the founding collection of the museum's theatre and performance archives.
Enthoven's unparalleled knowledge of the London stage and its history earned her the sobriquet 'the theatrical encyclopaedia'.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Lady's Realm]]'', Vol. XXVI, pp.465–470&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==

Gabrielle Enthoven was born at 21 New Street, Spring Gardens, [[Westminster]], London to William Govett Romaine (1815–1893) and Frances Pheobe Romaine, née Tennant (1822/3-1909). Enthoven's year of birth was incorrectly listed in the family Bible as 1870, a fact which Enthoven did not discover until her sixtieth birthday. On finding this out, Enthoven remarked: 'Such a shock darling. I was giving a lovely party and [[John Gielgud]] and everybody was coming, and suddenly I discovered that I was not sixty at all, but sixty-two. Wasn't it awful?'&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;'Gabrielle Enthoven' by Barbara Vereker in ''The Queen'', 25 February 1942&lt;/ref&gt;

Her father was Judge Advocate General in the Crimea and India, Legal Advisor to the Board of Admiralty, and Minister in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Romaine, William Govett (DNB00)|Dictionary of National Biography, 1885–1900, Volume 49, Romaine, William Govett]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Sphere, 30 April 1927"&gt;''The Sphere'', 30 April 1927&lt;/ref&gt; Much of Enthoven's childhood was spent abroad as she accompanied her father on trips to various postings in both India and the Middle East. In Egypt, Enthoven used to ride in her own carriage during state occasions and rode in the desert with [[Charles George Gordon]]&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
On her father's retirement in 1879, the family returned to England, settling in a house named 'The Old Priory' just outside [[Windsor, Berkshire]] where Enthoven lived until her father's death in 1893. Enthoven had never been educated at school, nor had she been tutored by a governess. As a result, she was fifteen years old before she could either read or write. She could, however, as a result of her travels abroad, speak fluent Egyptian, Turkish, two Hindustani dialects, French, Italian, Spanish, and some German.&lt;ref name="The Sphere, 30 April 1927"/&gt;

There were occasions when a carriage was sent from nearby [[Windsor Castle]] to collect Enthoven and her friends to play with the young Princess Mary of Teck, later to become [[Queen Mary of Teck]]. Enthoven recalled slapping the young princess across the face on one occasion, an incident which the two women would recall in later years when the Queen visited Enthoven at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Gabrielle Enthoven Biographical File, Theatre and Performance Department, Victoria and Albert Museum&lt;/ref&gt;

Enthoven was a small child when she first visited the theatre. She climbed out of her bedroom window clutching a shilling and made the journey to the [[Gaiety Theatre, London]] to see a production of [[The Forty Thieves]]. Climbing beneath the legs of the waiting crowd, Enthoven was picked up by a large [[navvy]] who placed her upon his shoulders and pushed his way through the throng of people to find them a seat on the front row of the gallery. Half-way through the performance, he took out an orange from his pocket, bit into it, pushed some sugar in the hole with his thumb, and gave it to Enthoven to suck.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

== Personal life ==

In 1893, Enthoven married Major Charles Henfrey Enthoven (1866–1910), who at various times, occupied the role of Staff Captain in the Royal Engineers, General Staff Officer at the War Office, and Chief Officer of London County Council's Parks Department. The couple had no children. Charles Enthoven died of [[pneumonia]] on 30 April 1910.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 2 May 1910&lt;/ref&gt; Enthoven was not reported as being present at her husband's funeral.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', Thursday 5 May 1910&lt;/ref&gt;

Enthoven was a recognised and well-known figure within London's theatrical society. She was an inveterate first-nighter and had friendships with many members of the theatrical elite including [[John Gielgud]], [[Peggy Ashcroft]], [[Marda Vanne]], [[Edward Gordon Craig]], [[Edith Craig]] and [[Noël Coward]]. In 1921, Enthoven was staying in New York with [[Cecile Sartoris]], with whom she had translated ''The Honeysuckle'', a play by the Italian writer [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]]. The play was performed that year at the [[Lyceum Theatre (Broadway)|Lyceum Theatre]]. Noël Coward stayed with Enthoven and Sartoris during this period. Recalling his stay with the two women, he wrote: ‘they said that when I sold a play, or made some money somehow, I could pay rent, but until then I was to be their guest […] I accepted and moved in immediately, grateful not only for their kindness, but for their company.'&lt;ref&gt;Noël Coward, ''Autobiography: Consisting of Present Indicative, Future Indefinite and the Uncompleted Past Conditional'' (London: Methuen, 1986), p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; During Enthoven's stay in New York, in a flat on Washington Square South, she spent time with many influential people within artistic and theatrical society. The American poet and playwright [[Mercedes de Acosta]] wrote about Enthoven's stay in New York in her 1960s memoir [https://books.google.com/books?id=ra9qtgAACAAJ&amp;dq=here+lies+the+heart&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=kcamU4m-CayA0AWQ34DABw&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAQ Here Lies the Heart]. She described Enthoven as being 'a woman of rare culture, of heart, and remarkable intelligence. A woman, too, of great humour. There were few like her.'&lt;ref&gt;Mercedes de Acosta, ''Here Lies the Heart'' (New York: Reynal &amp; Company, 1960), p.123&lt;/ref&gt;

Enthoven knew [[Oscar Wilde]] very well and would visit him at his home as a young girl. After these visits she would return home and copy down the stories he had told her. In 1948, Enthoven presented the [[British Library]] with a pamphlet containing four prose poems of Wilde's that she had had printed and bound under the title [http://explore.bl.uk/primo_library/libweb/action/display.do?tabs=moreTab&amp;ct=display&amp;fn=search&amp;doc=BLL01001031394&amp;indx=2&amp;recIds=BLL01001031394&amp;recIdxs=1&amp;elementId=1&amp;renderMode=poppedOut&amp;displayMode=full&amp;frbrVersion=2&amp;dscnt=1&amp;scp.scps=scope%3A%28BLCONTENT%29&amp;frbg=&amp;tab=local_tab&amp;dstmp=1403441827113&amp;srt=rank&amp;mode=Basic&amp;vl(488279563UI0)=any&amp;dum=true&amp;tb=t&amp;vl(freeText0)=echoes&amp;vid=BLVU1 ''Echoes''].&lt;ref&gt;Rupert Hart-Davis (ed.), ''The Letters of Oscar Wilde'' (New York: Harcourt, Brace &amp; World, 1962), p. 809n&lt;/ref&gt; In 1889, Wilde dedicated a poem to Enthoven entitled ''Remorse. (a study in saffron)''.&lt;ref&gt;Bobby Fong, 'Oscar Wilde: Five Fugitive Pieces’ in ''English Literature in Translation'', 1880-1920, Vol. 22, No. 1 (1 January 1979), pp. 7-16, pp. 13-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible that Enthoven engaged in lesbian relationships after the death of her husband. She was a central member of London's lesbian haut monde. This group included women such as the writer [[Radclyffe Hall]], best known for writing the banned lesbian classic [[The Well of Loneliness]], the sculptor [[Una Troubridge]], the painter [[Romaine Brooks]], and the tennis player and fencer [[Toupie Lowther]]. The group referred to themselves as 'The Circle' and would regularly meet to have dinner parties at their homes in the exclusive London borough of [[Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea|Kensington and Chelsea]], visit the theatre, or dance at clubs in [[Soho]] such as the 'Cave of Harmony' and 'The Orange Tree'.&lt;ref&gt;Sally Cline, ''Radclyffe Hall: A Woman Called John'' (London: Faber and Faber Ltd., 2010), p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; The women lived a privileged lifestyle of grand houses, villas in the sun, inherited incomes, successful careers, and stylish lovers.&lt;ref&gt;Diana Souhami, ''The Trials of Radclyffe Hall'' (London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1998), p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s, however, Enthoven was dropped by her friends [[Radclyffe Hall]] and [[Una Troubridge]], with Troubridge accusing Enthoven of 'repudiating her own kind when opportune to do so' and adding 'she's a rat and we have no use for her'.&lt;ref name="Diana Souhami 1998 p. 242"&gt;Diana Souhami, ''The Trials of Radclyffe Hall'' (London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1998), p. 242&lt;/ref&gt; Enthoven had played the leading role in a production of [[Colette]]'s novel [[Chéri (novel)|Chéri]] which had been adapted by Troubridge. The play was an unequivocal failure, and this may have contributed to the demise of the women's friendship.&lt;ref name="Diana Souhami 1998 p. 242"/&gt;

In 1923, Enthoven was instrumental in bringing the Italian actress [[Eleonora Duse]] over to England for her farewell engagement.&lt;ref&gt;'Obituary: Mrs Gabrielle Enthoven' in ''The Times'', Saturday 19 August 1950&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theatrical Activities ==

Enthoven was a keen playwright and had her first play, ''Montmartre'', produced at the [[Alhambra Theatre]], London in 1912 as part of a [[revue]] called ''Kill That Fly!'' [[The Observer]] gave a favourable review of the sketch, writing: ‘the little wordless thrill, "Montmartre", by Gabrielle Enthoven, is the most thrilling thing of its kind we have seen'.&lt;ref&gt;''The Observer'', 19 January 1913&lt;/ref&gt;
She was the president and founding member, alongside her close friends [[Edith Craig]] and [[Christabel Marshall|Christopher St. John]], of the [[Pioneer Players]], a London-based theatre society founded in 1911. The company was formed from members of the [[Actresses' Franchise League]]. The [[Pioneer Players]] engaged heavily with socio-political issues of the era. The society 'acknowledged an interest in [[women's suffrage]] and in any other current movement of interest'.&lt;ref&gt;Katharine Cockin, ''Women and Theatre in the Age of Suffrage: The Pioneer Players, 1911–1925'' (Hampshire: Palgrave, 2001), p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; In 1916, the company produced the play ''Ellen Young'', written by Enthoven and [[Edmund Goulding]]. It was performed at the [[Savoy Theatre]] on 2 April 1916.

In 1921, Enthoven and [[Cecile Sartoris]]'s translation of [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]]'s ''The Honeysuckle'' played at the [[Lyceum Theatre (Broadway)]] in New York, as well as at 'Playroom 6' in [[Soho]], London on 9 May. 1927.&lt;ref&gt;''Play Pictorial'', 10 May 1927&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1930, ''The Confederates'', a play written by Enthoven in collaboration with [[H. M. Harwood]] was produced at the [[Ambassadors Theatre (London)|Ambassadors Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;'Mrs. Enthoven, 82, British Dramatist', ''The New York Times'', 19 August 1950&lt;/ref&gt;
Enthoven was an enthusiastic amateur actress and appeared with the 'Windsor Strollers', the 'Old Stagers' and other prominent amateur companies.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The Belgian playwright [[Maurice Maeterlinck]] asked Enthoven to appear in Paris in a production of his play [[Pelléas and Mélisande]], although she never did. [[Sarah Bernhardt]] and [[Mrs Patrick Campbell]] eventually performed together in this play after being introduced to one another by Enthoven.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
Enthoven was a councillor of the [[Stage Society]]&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; and, in 1933, the vice-president of the newly formed 'Passing Theatres Association', a society with the aim to collect records and visit sites of old theatres. Shortly before her death in 1950, Enthoven became the first Chairman of the [http://www.str.org.uk/ Society for Theatre Research]&lt;ref name="Jean Scott Rogers 1985"&gt;Jean Scott Rogers, ''Stage By Stage: The Making of the Theatre Museum'' (London: HMSO, 1985), p. xv&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theatre Collection ==

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Gabrielle Enthoven.jpg|thumb| Gabrielle Enthoven]] --&gt;After her marriage in 1893, Enthoven began to regularly attend the theatre and to paste various press cuttings relating to the London theatre into [[scrapbooking|scrapbooks]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;'Obituary: Mrs Gabrielle Enthoven', ''The Times'', Saturday 19 August 1950&lt;/ref&gt; Her great interest in theatre and theatre history led Enthoven to start collecting memorabilia and [[ephemera]] related to the stage. She recalled: 'It started when, in 1900, I noticed an inaccuracy in some book of stage history. Being passionately interested in the theatre, I wrote to the author who admitted a mistake. There the matter might have stopped; but soon afterwards I happened to find some old playbills that proved my point. That was when the "collecting" flea bit me.'&lt;ref&gt;''The Evening News'', 15 September 1938&lt;/ref&gt; A chance purchase of two-hundred playbills became the foundation of Enthoven's vast collection, and, after her husband's death in 1910, Enthoven's collecting increased.&lt;ref&gt;'Obituary: Mrs. Gabrielle Enthoven', ''The Times'' Saturday 19 August 1950&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1911, Enthoven mounted a national campaign to establish a permanent theatre collection in a British institution. Writing to [[The Observer]] she advocated for: 
&lt;div style="margin-left: 2em;"&gt;A comprehensive theatrical section in an existing museum to comprise specimens of all the different branches necessary to the working of a play from the construction of the theatre, the designing of the scenery and costumes to the smallest workings necessary in the house. Also a library and collection of playbills, prints, pictures and relics, etc. I want the section to be the place where the producer, actor, author and critic will naturally go for information, both of what is being done in this and other countries at present and what has been done before.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Scott Rogers, ''Stage By Stage: The Making of the Theatre Museum'' (London: HMSO, 1985), p. xii&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

National theatre collections had been established in America at the [[Harvard Library]], in Rome, Milan, Stockholm and Paris, but not in England.&lt;ref&gt;Gabrielle Enthoven Nominal File, Theatre and Performance Department, Victoria and Albert Museum&lt;/ref&gt; The [[British Museum]] contained a valuable collection of 600,000 playbills from across Britain and abroad. This collection was, however, considered incomplete.&lt;ref&gt;''The Referee'', 19 November 1911&lt;/ref&gt;

Enthoven's campaign continued to gain momentum with numerous letters and comments of support appearing in the national press. Enthoven's connections with well-known and celebrated members of theatrical society contributed to the success of the campaign, with people such as [[Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree]], [[George Alexander (actor)|Sir George Alexander]], and [[John Hare (actor)|Sir John Hare]] publicly declaring their support.&lt;ref&gt;''The Referee'', 12 November 1911&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1911, it was announced that the [[London Museum]] was to devote a section to a permanent exhibition of theatrical objects that would chart the developments and phases of theatre both in Britain and abroad.&lt;ref&gt;''The Morning Advertiser'', 22 November 1911&lt;/ref&gt; It was to be the first time that a British museum had a recognised theatrical section. The project was overseen by [[Guy Francis Laking]], the keeper of the [[London Museum]]. Enthoven's vast collection of playbills would remain at her home, but she asked the public to lend or give any theatrical objects they possessed to the museum to ensure the exhibition's success.&lt;ref&gt;''The Standard'', 27 November 1911&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition was, however, unsuccessful. A visitor to the museum wrote to the [[Pall Mall Gazette]] to declare that 'those looking for enlightenment must go away sadly baffled, and those who, having a regard for the sentiment and charm of what such a collection should be, must blush indeed as they see this scanty, mediocre, and careless assortment.'&lt;ref&gt;''Pall Mall Gazette'', 24 December 1912&lt;/ref&gt; A lacklustre response from the public and a lack of space at the museum were blamed for the exhibition's poor reception.

Undeterred, Enthoven continued to write to museums to establish a permanent theatrical section. Her first choice of a home for her collection and theatrical section was the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]. However, she continued to face difficulties and received a letter from the museum stating that 'there is so little chance of your scheme being adopted that we should scarcely be justified in asking you to come here, as you suggest, to discuss it.'&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Scott Rogers]], ''Stage By Stage: The Making of the Theatre Museum'' (London: HMSO, 1985), p. xiii&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922, the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] held the ''International Theatre Exhibition: Designs and Models for the Modern Stage'' and displayed a number of items from Enthoven's enormous collection. This gave Enthoven the motivation to continue her campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Scott Rogers, ''Stage By Stage: The Making of the Theatre Museum'' (London: HMSO, 1985), p. xiii&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s, Enthoven's collection had increased to such an extent that it could no longer remain in her home. In 1924, after more than a decade of campaigning, the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] finally agreed to house her collection, at this time containing more than 80,000 playbills, prints, books and engravings.&lt;ref&gt;'Obituary: Mrs. Gabrielle Enthoven', ''The Times'', Saturday 19 August 1950&lt;/ref&gt; The collection was named the ''Gabrielle Enthoven Theatrical Collection''. The playbills were housed in the Department of Engraving, Illustration and Design. In 1925, Enthoven and three members of staff arrived at the museum to begin to catalogue, index and arrange the collection. Enthoven received no payment for her work and paid the wages of her staff from her own funds.&lt;ref&gt;''The Daily Telegraph'', 21 April 1927&lt;/ref&gt; An appeal for financial aid to contribute to the cataloguing of the collection was launched in the national press, with theatrical personalities such as [[Sybil Thorndike]] supporting the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 16 December 1926&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Second World War]], the government provided Enthoven with two paid assistants, though she herself never received a salary.&lt;ref name="Stage 1985"&gt;[[Jean Scott Rogers]], ''Stage By Stage: The Making of the Theatre Museum'' (London: HMSO, 1985), p. xv&lt;/ref&gt;

Enthoven had substantial offers from American institutions to purchase her collection. She was once offered £9,000 by an American collector but refused&lt;ref&gt;''Daily Mail'', 22 April 1927&lt;/ref&gt; and upon her death it became known that she had once turned down an American offer of £30,000.&lt;ref name="Jean Scott Rogers 1985"/&gt;  The collection was to remain in England. Enthoven continued to add to the collection up until her death. At the age of 81, the 'Grand Old Lady of London theatre first-nighters' still arrived at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] at 10 o'clock every morning to sort and index her playbills.&lt;ref&gt;''The Evening News, 1 April 1949&lt;/ref&gt;

== First and Second World War ==

During the [[First World War]] Enthoven was one of the first eleven people to join the ''War Refugee Committee''&lt;ref name="The Sphere, 30 April 1927"/&gt; and became the head of the Correspondence and Indexing Department.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; In 1915 she began to work for the [[Red Cross]] in dealing with missing soldiers and prisoners of war and, in 1916, she eventually became head of the Records Department of the Central Prisoners of War and Missing Persons Committee dealing with the welfare of British prisoners of war in Germany, Russia and Turkey. This work ceased in 1920 owing to Enthoven's ill health.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; In 1921, Enthoven visited New York as a [[Red Cross]] representative to raise funds to build schools for children in devastated areas of France.&lt;ref name="The Sphere, 30 April 1927"/&gt; Enthoven was awarded an [[OBE]] in recognition of this work. [[Radclyffe Hall]] was said to be 'frankly envious' about Enthoven's activities during the war and the subsequent recognition of her endeavours. Hall had attended [[Red Cross]] lectures, learnt first-aid, and transported library books to casualty wards but felt this was not as heroic as the work undertaken by Enthoven.&lt;ref&gt;Sally Cline, ''Radclyffe Hall: A Woman Called John'' (London: Faber and Faber Ltd., 2010), p. 163&lt;/ref&gt;

On the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], Enthoven suspended her work at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] and returned to the [[War Office]] to work as the head of the Records Department of the Central Prisoners of War. Enthoven, in one of her scrapbooks at the museum, wrote: 'Work ceased here on declaration of War Sep.3 1939. I started work here alone on 13 August 1945.'&lt;ref name="Stage 1985"/&gt;

== Death ==
Enthoven died at her home in Cadogan Gardens, London aged 82 on 18 August 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mrs Gabrielle Enthoven|url=http://find.galegroup.com/dvnw/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=DVNW&amp;userGroupName=rho_ttda&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;docId=CS102583059&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0|accessdate=20 March 2014|newspaper=Times|date=19 August 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[obituary]] appeared in both [[The Times]] and [[The New York Times]]. Before her death Enthoven confirmed: 
&lt;div style="margin-left: 2em;"&gt;'I desire that my body shall be cremated without the celebration of any funeral service in the cheapest possible manner as my Trustees shall decide [and] that my ashes shall be scattered and I desire that none of my friends shall attend my funeral nor wear mourning for me of any kind and they shall be requested not to send any flowers'.&lt;ref name=v&amp;a&gt;Nominal File: Enthoven, Gabrielle (purchases made from the Enthoven Fund) Part 2, 1930-1950, Ref: MA/1/E732/2, Victoria and Albert Museum, Theatre and Performance Department.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Enthoven bequeathed the residue of her estate to the [[Ministry of Education (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Education]] who, at the time, were responsible for the Victoria and Albert Museum's finances. The bequest states that Enthoven's money would be used to ensure that ‘proper accommodation for the Gabrielle Enthoven Theatrical collection continues to be provided and for the cataloguing, maintenance arrangement, and description of the Playbills, Prints, Printed Tickets, and other material’.&lt;ref name=v&amp;a /&gt;

The '''Herakleia head''' is the portrait of a probable [[Achaemenid]] Satrap of [[Asia Minor]] of the late 6th century, found in [[Heraclea Pontica|Heraclea]], in [[Bithynia]], modern [[Turkey]].&lt;ref name="TAM"/&gt; The head is now located in the [[Museum of Anatolian Civilizations]] in [[Ankara]].

The man depicted in the sculpture was probably a [[Satrap]] under [[Darius I]].&lt;ref name="TAM"&gt;{{cite book |last1=CAHN |first1=HERBERT A. |last2=GERIN |first2=DOMINIQUE |title=Themistocles at Magnesia |date=1988 |pages=20 &amp; Plate 3 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/42668124}}&lt;/ref&gt; The man is the service of the Achaemenid Empire is bearded and mustachioed, but probably a Greek from [[Asia Minor]] rather than a Persian.&lt;ref name="MS97"/&gt; The statue is made of marble, and was probably made by a Greek sculptor.&lt;ref name="MS97"/&gt; The sculpture has been dated to circa 530 BCE, or at leat [[Archaic Greece|Late Archaic]].&lt;ref name="MS97"/&gt;

The Herakliea head is considered as an early attempt towards [[portrait|portraiture]] with a realistic likeliness.&lt;ref name="MS97"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stieber |first1=Mary |title=The Poetics of Appearance in the Attic Korai |date=2010 |publisher=University of Texas Press |isbn=9780292773493 |page=97 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DaIAAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA98 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Eastern portrait in purely [[Ionia|East Greek]] [[Archaic Greece|Archaic]] style, is one of the two known forerunners of extant Greek portraits, together with the [[Sabouroff head]].&lt;ref name="TAM"/&gt; It is comparable with the [[Sabouroff head]], from about the same period.&lt;ref name="MS97"/&gt; These nearly life-like portraits allow to define a date for early portraiture which is much earlier than had been previously thought.&lt;ref name="MS98"/&gt; The first truely individualistic portrait is often considered to be the 470 BCE portrait of [[Themistocles]].&lt;ref name="TAM"/&gt; In numismatics also, the first portraits of rulers appear with the coins of [[Themistocles]] as ruler of Magnesia, and continue with the nearby rulers of [[Lycia]] towards the end of the 5th century BCE.&lt;ref name="MS98"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"A rare silver fraction recently identified as a coin of Themistocles from Magnesia even has a bearded portrait of the great man, making it by far the earliest datable portrait coin. Other early portraits can be seen on the coins of Lycian dynasts." {{cite book |last1=Carradice |first1=Ian |last2=Price |first2=Martin |title=Coinage in the Greek World |date=1988 |publisher=Seaby |isbn=9780900652820 |page=84 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OVZmAAAAMAAJ |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Herakleia head is also an important marker for the depiction of Satraps in the period. In particuliar, the banned Athenian general [[Themistocles]], who became Achaemenid Satrap in [[Magnesia on the Meander|Magnesia]], is seen wearing a tight [[bonnet (headgear)|bonnet]] with [[Olive wreath]] on some of his coins (circa 465-459 BCE).&lt;ref name="HC19"&gt;{{cite book |last1=CAHN |first1=HERBERT A. |last2=GERIN |first2=DOMINIQUE |title=Themistocles at Magnesia |date=1988 |page=19 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/42668124}}&lt;/ref&gt; This possibly reflects the headwear of Achaemenid [[Satrap]]s, such as seen in the Herakleia head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=CAHN |first1=HERBERT A. |last2=GERIN |first2=DOMINIQUE |title=Themistocles at Magnesia |date=1988 |page=20 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/42668124}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MS98"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stieber |first1=Mary |title=The Poetics of Appearance in the Attic Korai |date=2010 |publisher=University of Texas Press |isbn=9780292773493 |page=98 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DaIAAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA98 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10530">The '''Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA) Singapore''' is the curatorial division of [[LASALLE College of the Arts]], dedicated to supporting innovative and emerging creative practices. Focusing on [[art]] and [[design]] from the present, it provides an active site for contemporary [[culture]] in [[Singapore]]. It comprises five galleries that span a total of 1,500 square metres, one of the largest spaces devoted to contemporary art in Singapore. It engages local and international audiences in critical viewing and discussion through a diverse programme of exhibitions, projects, publications and events.

The ICA Singapore provides a cultural and educational tool for students and the wider public to advance their knowledge and appreciation of the contemporary local, regional and international arts.

==History==
The Dr Earl Lu Gallery was established by LASALLE College of the Arts in 1986,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yap|first1=June|title=A Brief History of the Singapore Visual Arts Scene|journal=Singapore's Visual Artists|date=2016|volume=Singapore: National Arts Council.}}&lt;/ref&gt; in recognition of a major contribution of artworks by [[philanthropist]] and artist Dr [[Earl Lu]], it presented exhibitions of traditional and contemporary arts, often with a focus on practices from [[Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yap|first1=June|title=A Brief History of the Singapore Visual Arts Scene|journal=Singapore's Visual Artists|date=2016|volume=Singapore: National Arts Council.}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2001 to 2004, under the directorship of Binghui Huangfu, the gallery worked closely with LASALLE’s Contemporary Asian Art Centre, a research facility directed by T.K. Sabapathy that sought to advance knowledge and collaboration between artists across Asia through dialogue, research and publications. In 2004, Dr Earl Lu Gallery was renamed the '''Institute of Contemporary Arts Singapore''' and repositioned as a centre of Singapore and international contemporary art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tan|first1=Eugene|title=Art in Singapore and the Institute of Contemporary Arts Singapore|journal=Perspectives|date=July 2007|volume=Hong Kong: Asia Art Archive|url=http://www.aaa.org.hk/Diaaalogue/Details/31|accessdate=18 April 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160128050814/http://www.aaa.org.hk/Diaaalogue/Details/31|archivedate=28 January 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2007, the institute moved along with LASALLE College of the Arts from the Goodman Road campus to a new campus on McNally Street, where it is based today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LASALLE College of the Arts|url=http://www.mimoa.eu/projects/Singapore/Singapore/LASALLE%20college%20of%20the%20arts/?abvar3|website=Mimoa: Mi Modern Architecture|accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

In February 2016, two items that were part of the group show "Fault-lines: Disparate and desperate intimacies" were removed from artist [[Loo Zihan]]'s installation "Queer objects: An archive for the future".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = Jian Xuan|last = Lee|authorlink = |coauthors = |title = Sex objects removed from art show|url = http://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/arts/sex-objects-removed-from-art-show|work = The Straits Times|date = 16 February 2016|accessdate = 16 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This action was agreed after discussion between ICA Singapore staff, curator Wong Binghao, and Loo Zihan, and was due to the nature of the objects, which could potentially be considered offensive to some members of the public. The items were a penis sheath and a butt plug. The ICA Singapore, curator and artist emphasised that the decision was taken to make the exhibition accessible to all, including students of the LASALLE College of the Arts, half of whom are under 18 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Facebook|url = http://www.facebook.com/ICASgalleries/notifications/?section=activity_feed&amp;subsection=mention&amp;target_story=S%3A_I100000600513049%3A1228728023823870|website = www.facebook.com|access-date = 2016-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Julius Klinger Portrait.jpg|thumb|right|140px|Julius Klinger, date&amp;nbsp;unknown]] --&gt;
'''Julius Klinger''' (22 May 1876 – 1942) was an [[Austria]]n painter, draftsman, illustrator, commercial graphic artist, typographer and writer. Klinger studied at the Technologisches Gewerbemuseum in [[Vienna]].&lt;ref name="AEIOU "&gt;[http://www.aeiou.at/aeiou.encyclop.k/k464961.htm;internal&amp;action=_setlanguage.action?LANGUAGE=en Austrian AEIOU Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early works in Vienna and Munich ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Die Jugend 1896.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Die Jugend,&amp;nbsp;1896]] --&gt;
[[Image:Meggendorfer Blätter 27.03.1930.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Meggendorfer Blätter,&amp;nbsp;1930]]
Klinger was born in Dornbach near [[Vienna]]. In 1895, he found his first employment with the [[Vienna]] fashion magazine ''Wiener Mode''. Here he made acquaintance with [[Koloman Moser]], who later would be his teacher; Moser recommended him to the ''[[Meggendorfer-Blätter]]''.&lt;ref name="onbJK"&gt;[http://www2.onb.ac.at/siteseeing/flu/schaetze_neu/schaetze-kuenstler.htm Julius Klinger (Wien 22. 5. 1976-1942?)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918024028/http://www2.onb.ac.at/siteseeing/flu/schaetze_neu/schaetze-kuenstler.htm |date=2008-09-18 }}, biographical entry with the [[Austrian National Library]]&lt;/ref&gt;

1896 saw him moving to [[Munich]] where he worked as an illustrator for the ''Meggendorfer-Blätter''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Ciarlo|title=Advertising Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4ceZNb2h4BQC&amp;pg=PA292|accessdate=4 September 2016|date=January 2011|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-05006-8|page=292}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others. From 1897 to 1902 he was a collaborator to the eponymous [[Jugendstil]] magazine ''[[Die Jugend]]''.

== Berlin ==
[[Image:Julius Klinger Möhring Kronleuchter 1908.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Julius Klinger:&amp;nbsp;1908, Möhring&amp;nbsp;candelabra&amp;nbsp;factory]]
In 1897 he relocated to Berlin, where he worked extensively as a commercial graphic artist until 1915. Together with the printing house Hollerbaum und Schmidt, he developed a new fashion of functional poster design that soon gained him international reputation.&lt;ref name="onbJK" /&gt; In 1912 he designed the poster for the ''Rund um Berlin'' air show in [[Johannisthal Air Field|Johannisthal]]. In Berlin he also contributed to ''Das kleine Witzblatt'', ''Lustige Blätter'' and ''Das Narrenschiff'' humorous magazines.

== Advertising campaign for the "Tabu" company ==
[[Image:Julius Klinger Tabu Hauswand ca.1920.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Julius&amp;nbsp;Klinger: firewall,&amp;nbsp;ca.1920]]
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Julius Klinger Tabu Poster 1919.jpg|thumb|100px|left|J. Klinger: Poster&amp;nbsp;ca.&amp;nbsp;1919]] --&gt;
Beginning in 1918, Klinger designed a comprehensive and noted campaign promoting the "Tabu" company's cigarette rolling paper, that was advertised all over Vienna in 1918/19. Klinger devised a promotional strategy, spanning from small-sized newspaper advertisements to billboards and painted [[Firewall (construction)|firewalls]] – construction site fences and winterized fountain paneling were used as advertising space, too.&lt;ref name="onb2003"&gt;[http://www.onb.ac.at/sammlungen/plakate/archiv/erwerb/objekt_juni_2003.htm Plakat: Julius Klinger: Tabu, 1919] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040823140137/http://www.onb.ac.at/sammlungen/plakate/archiv/erwerb/objekt_juni_2003.htm |date=2004-08-23 }}, [[Austrian National Library]], 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nazi persecution ==
[[Image:Julius Klinger Ankerbrot 1938.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Julius Klinger, late&amp;nbsp;1937,&amp;nbsp;Vienna]]
Being of Jewish descent, he suffered from [[Nazism|national socialist]] harassment. According to Viennese police records, he was registered as ''moved to [[Minsk]]'' on 2 June 1942, i.e. deported. Presumably, he was killed the same year.&lt;ref name="onbJK" /&gt;

Probably towards the end of 1937 he designed his last poster for the Ankerbrot-Werke factory. The Jewish-owned company was transferred to "''Aryan''" proprietors in 1938; after 1945 legitimate ownership was restored.

[[File:Una escena de la caricatura 'Jungle Jitters'.png|thumb|left|A scene from the film.]]
In an African jungle, the natives are going about their day, with the jungle elements being intertwined with modern-day elements; for example, the people dancing around a tent when it turns into a makeshift merry-go-round, to the tune of ''[[The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down]]'' which has since become the longtime ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' theme song.

A traveling dog-like salesman named Manny (a parody of [[Al Pearce]]'s character Elmer Blurt) comes by to offer them the latest in "assorted useful, useless, utensils".  The natives capture him, throw him into a pot of boiling water, and ransack his goods.  They proceed to familiarize themselves with vacuum cleaners, batteries, light bulbs, etc.

When the salesman is introduced to the village queen (depicted as a chicken-like white woman, possibly to avoid any problems with the [[Motion Picture Production Code|Hays code]] over the issue of [[miscegenation]]), she takes a liking to him, imagining Manny the salesman as [[Clark Gable]] and [[Robert Taylor (actor)|Robert Taylor]].  The salesman finds himself with the choice between a forced marriage with the homely queen, or the boiling pot of water.  He chooses the pot, and in a closing shot as he sinks into the broth, hopes "they all get indigestion."

==Availability==
*''Jungle Jitters'' fell into the [[public domain]] in 1966, and is available on many public domain home video collections.

==Notes==
*Because of the [[ethnic stereotyping|racial stereotypes]] used against [[African-American|black people]] throughout the short, it prompted [[United Artists]] to withhold it from [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] within the United States in 1968. As such, the short was placed it into the so-called [[Censored Eleven]], a group of eleven ''Merrie Melodies'' and ''Looney Tunes'' shorts withheld from television distribution in the United States since 1968 due to heavy stereotyping of black people.&lt;ref&gt;The Straight Dope.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The short was also referenced in the ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' short, ''[[The Ducksters]]'' (1950), but is not related to what [[Daffy Duck]] was talking about because he mentioned a gorilla and the original short did not feature a gorilla.

'''''Kahaani''''' ({{IPA-hns|kəˈɦaːni|IPA}}; {{lit|Story}}) is a 2012 Indian [[Hindi]]-language [[mystery film|mystery]] [[thriller film]] co-written, co-produced and directed by [[Sujoy Ghosh]]. It stars [[Vidya Balan]] as Vidya Bagchi, a pregnant woman searching for her missing husband in [[Kolkata]] during the festival of [[Durga Puja]], assisted by Satyoki "Rana" Sinha ([[Parambrata Chatterjee]]) and Khan ([[Nawazuddin Siddiqui]]).

Made on a shoestring budget of {{INRConvert|80|m}}, ''Kahaani'' was conceived and developed by Ghosh, who co-wrote the film with [[Advaita Kala]]. The crew often employed [[guerrilla filmmaking|guerrilla-filmmaking]] techniques on [[Kolkata]]'s city streets to avoid attracting attention. The film was noted for its deft portrayal of the city and for making use of many local crew and cast members. ''Kahaani'' explores themes of feminism and motherhood in male-dominated Indian society. The film also makes several allusions to [[Satyajit Ray]]'s films such as ''[[Charulata]]'' (1964), ''[[Aranyer Dinratri]]'' (1970) and ''[[Joi Baba Felunath (film)|Joi Baba Felunath]]'' (1979).

''Kahaani'' was released worldwide on 9 March 2012. Critics praised the screenplay, the cinematography and the performances of the lead actors. Following critical acclaim and word-of-mouth publicity, the film earned {{INRConvert|1.04|b}} worldwide in 50 days. The film won [[List of accolades received by Kahaani|several awards]], including three [[National Film Awards]] and five [[Filmfare Awards]]. The latter included trophies for [[Filmfare Award for Best Director|Best Director]] (Ghosh) and [[Filmfare Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] (Vidya). A sequel, titled ''[[Kahaani 2: Durga Rani Singh]]'', was released on 2 December 2016.

&lt;!-- Per WP:FilmPlot, plot summaries for feature film articles should be between 400 and 700 words. Please do not expand it. Thanks --&gt;
A poison-gas attack on a [[Kolkata Metro]] Rail compartment kills the passengers on board. Two years later Vidya Bagchi ([[Vidya Balan]]), a pregnant [[software engineer]], arrives in [[Kolkata]] from London during the [[Durga Puja]] festivities in search of her missing husband, Arnab Bagchi. A police officer, Satyoki "Rana" Sinha ([[Parambrata Chatterjee]]), offers to help. Although Vidya claims that Arnab went to Kolkata on an assignment for the National Data Center (NDC), initial investigations suggest that no such person was employed by the NDC.

Agnes D'Mello, the NDC's head of human resources, suggests to Vidya that her husband resembled former employee Milan Damji ([[Indraneil Sengupta]]), whose file is probably kept in the old NDC office. Before Agnes can provide any further help she is killed by Bob Biswas ([[Saswata Chatterjee]]), an assassin working undercover as a life insurance agent. Vidya and Rana break into the NDC office and find Damji's file, barely escaping an encounter with Bob, who is searching for the same information. Meanwhile, the attempts to obtain Damji's records have attracted the attention of two [[Intelligence Bureau (India)|Intelligence Bureau]] (IB) officials in Delhi—the chief Bhaskaran K. ([[Dhritiman Chatterjee]]) and his deputy Khan ([[Nawazuddin Siddiqui]]). Khan arrives in Kolkata and reveals that Damji was a rogue IB agent responsible for the poison-gas attack. In spite of Khan's warnings, Vidya continues her search, fearing that Arnab's resemblance to Damji may have led him into trouble.

The address on Damji's record leads Vidya and Rana to a dilapidated flat. An errand boy from the neighbourhood tea stall identifies R. Sridhar (Shantilal Mukherjee), an NDC officer, as a frequent visitor to Damji's flat. Bob attempts to kill Vidya, but fails, and is run over by a car during a chase. Examination of Bob's mobile phone leads Vidya and Rana to an [[IP address]] sending instructions to kill her. They break into Sridhar's office to verify his IP address, but he is alerted electronically and returns to his office. Vidya accidentally shoots Sridhar dead during a scuffle, which upsets Khan, who had wanted him alive.

Sridhar's computer data reveals a code, which when deciphered reveals Bhaskaran's phone number. Vidya calls Bhaskaran to tell him that she has retrieved sensitive documents from Sridhar's office. She asks Bhaskaran to help find her husband in exchange for the documents, but Bhaskaran tells her to contact the local police. Vidya soon gets a call from an unknown number however, warning her that she should hand over the documents to the caller if she wishes to see her husband alive. Khan thinks the caller is Milan Damji.

Vidya goes to meet Damji, followed by Rana and Khan. Damji cuts the meeting short when Vidya expresses her doubt that he will be able to return her husband in exchange for the sensitive file, and he attempts to leave. Vidya tries to stop him, and in the ensuing struggle Damji draws a gun on her. Vidya disarms him using the prosthetic belly she has been using to fake her pregnancy and promptly stabbing him in the neck with her [[hair stick]], after shooting him with his own gun. She flees into the crowd before the police arrive, leaving a thank you note for Rana and a [[USB flash drive|pen drive]] containing data from Sridhar's computer, which leads to Bhaskaran's arrest. Rana concludes that no Vidya or Arnab Bagchi ever existed, and that Vidya had been using the police and the IB to achieve her own ends.

Vidya is revealed to be the widow of Arup Basu ([[Abir Chatterjee]]), an IB officer and Damji's colleague, who was killed in the poison-gas attack, which also caused Vidya to immediately fall unconscious upon seeing her husband's corpse and suffer a miscarriage. In her mission to avenge his and their unborn child's death, Vidya was helped by retired IB officer Pratap Bajpayee ([[Darshan Jariwala]]), who suspected the involvement of a top IB official.

=== Development ===
[[Sujoy Ghosh]] approached novelist and script writer [[Advaita Kala]] with the idea for the film.&lt;ref name=Kala@ZN&gt;{{cite news|url=http://zeenews.india.com/entertainment/movies/vidya-balan-is-the-hero-of-kahaani-says-scriptwriter-advaita-kala_75637.htm|title=Vidya Balan is the hero of ''Kahaani'', says scriptwriter Advaita Kala|publisher=[[Zee News]]|agency=[[Press Trust of India]] (PTI)|accessdate=30 March 2012|date=16 November 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120706041728/http://zeenews.india.com/entertainment/movies/vidya-balan-is-the-hero-of-kahaani-says-scriptwriter-advaita-kala_75637.htm|archivedate=6 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kala took inspiration from her experience in Kolkata, where she had moved in 1999, akin to the protagonist in the film.&lt;ref name="mitra toi 3-16"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-03-16/books/31142700_1_kahaani-sujoy-ghosh-vidya-balan|title=Vidya's journey was my own: Advaita Kala|first=Ipshita|last=Mitra|newspaper=The Times of India|accessdate=8 May 2012|date=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She reported that despite facing a language barrier and the chaos and poverty of the metropolis, she was charmed by the warmth of the people, which was reflected in the film.&lt;ref name="real life znews"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://zeenews.india.com/entertainment/movies/kahaani-story-inspired-from-real-life-experiences_107223.htm|title=''Kahaani'' story inspired from real-life experiences|publisher=Zee News|agency=PTI|accessdate=21 March 2012|date=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kala started writing in 2009 and finished the 185-page script by February 2010.&lt;ref name="dasgupta toi 1152012"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-01-15/news-interviews/30627829_1_novel-sujoy-ghosh-release|title=Vidya's ''Kahaani'' to release as novel|first=Priyanka|last=Dasgupta|newspaper=The Times of India|agency=[[Times News Network]] (TNN)|accessdate=26 March 2012|date=15 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/advaita-kala-had-to-tell-vidyas-story-right/237060-40-103.html|title=''Kahaani'': Advaita Kala says she had to tell Vidya's story right|first=Malvika|last=Bhardwaj|publisher=[[CNN-IBN]]|accessdate=21 March 2012|date=7 March 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309225621/http://ibnlive.in.com/news/advaita-kala-had-to-tell-vidyas-story-right/237060-40-103.html|archivedate=9 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her research included reading the books ''Open Secrets: India's Intelligence Unveiled'' by Maloy Krishna Dhar and ''India's External Intelligence: Secrets of [[Research and Analysis Wing]] (RAW)'' by V. K. Singh.&lt;ref name="mitra toi 3-16" /&gt;

Ghosh, who co-wrote the story and the screenplay, began to plan the film while awaiting the release of his previous film ''[[Aladin (2009 film)|Aladin]]'' (2009), but the dismal response to ''Aladin'' was a setback. He had to approach several producers to finance him for ''Kahaani'', but was refused&lt;ref name="abp 7 april ghosh" /&gt; and discouraged from making the film owing to three factors: a pregnant woman as the lead star, a bunch of unknown Bengali actors as the supporting cast and Kolkata as a backdrop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://zeenews.india.com/entertainment/bollywood/kahaani-everything-that-a-film-should-not-be-sujoy-ghosh_109182.htm|title=''Kahaani'' everything that a film should not be: Sujoy Ghosh|publisher=Zee News|agency=PTI|accessdate=10 April 2012|date=9 April 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120411001732/http://zeenews.india.com/entertainment/bollywood/kahaani-everything-that-a-film-should-not-be-sujoy-ghosh_109182.htm|archivedate=11 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yashraj Films]] were willing to produce the film, but wanted Ghosh to sign a three-film deal, which he declined because he did not want that much commitment.&lt;ref name="abp 7 april ghosh" /&gt;

Bengali film actor [[Prosenjit Chatterjee]] encouraged Ghosh to shoot in Kolkata.&lt;ref name="KahaaniOfKahaani"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newindianexpress.com/entertainment/hindi/article324563.ece|title=The story behind ''Kahaani''|first=Ayaz|last=Shaikh|newspaper=[[The Indian Express]]|accessdate=26 March 2012|date=26 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ghosh finally selected Kolkata for several reasons: the director's acquaintance with the city, its mix of modernity and old-world charm,&lt;ref name="KahaaniOfKahaani" /&gt; and budget constraints. Kolkata is a cheaper location than Mumbai or Delhi, where most Bollywood films are shot.&lt;ref name="moneycontrol ghosh iv"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/entertainment/if-kahaani-failed-id-have-to-pack-my-baggo-sujoy-ghosh_689018.html|title=If ''Kahaani'' failed I'd have to pack my bag &amp; go: Sujoy Ghosh|publisher=Moneycontrol|agency=CNBC-TV18|accessdate=5 April 2012|date=4 April 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407065305/http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/entertainment/if-kahaani-failed-id-have-to-pack-my-baggo-sujoy-ghosh_689018.html|archivedate=7 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ghosh admitted in an interview that after his two preceding directorial ventures—''Aladin'' and ''[[Home Delivery (film)|Home Delivery]]'' (2005)—performed poorly at the box office, ''Kahaani'' was his last chance to create a niche as a director.&lt;ref name="ibn ghosh interview flop"&gt;{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaNZSI4zX2o|title=Rajeev Masand interview with director Sujoy Ghosh on ''Kahaani''|publisher=CNN-IBN|people=Ghosh, Sujoy|type=Television production|date=March 2012|time=1:25|accessdate=30 March 2012|df=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150712021551/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaNZSI4zX2o|archivedate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added that the film's plot twist came somewhat accidentally. Having described the skeleton of the story to a friend during its development, the friend called him back a few days later to enquire about his film. The friend had mistakenly imagined sequences which he assumed to be parts of the plot, from which the twist ending was derived.&lt;ref name="ibn ghosh interview twist"&gt;{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaNZSI4zX2o|title=Rajeev Masand interview with director Sujoy Ghosh on ''Kahaani''|publisher=CNN-IBN|people=Ghosh, Sujoy|type=Television production|date=March 2012|time=4:10|accessdate=30 March 2012|df=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150712021551/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaNZSI4zX2o|archivedate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ghosh went against the expectations of casting a popular actor from Bollywood. He signed Bengali actor Abir Chatterjee to play Vidya's husband. According to Ghosh, popular Bollywood actors were not willing to work with him after his two previous flops. He also believed that audience might expect more screen-time from a better-known actor.&lt;ref name="Sujoy @ India West"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiawest.com/news/3597-sujoy-ghosh-kahaani-could-be-the-story-of-any-mother.html|title=Sujoy Ghosh: ''Kahaani'' could be the story of any mother|first=R.M|last=Vijayakar|publisher=India West|accessdate=22 May 2012|date=19 March 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512171352/http://indiawest.com/news/3597-sujoy-ghosh-kahaani-could-be-the-story-of-any-mother.html|archivedate=12 May 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several other Bengali film and television actors, such as Indraneil Sengupta and Kharaj Mukherjee, were cast in supporting roles.&lt;ref name="Team Tolly @ TT"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1120316/jsp/entertainment/story_15255285.jsp|title=The ''Kahaani'' of team tolly|date=16 March 2012|newspaper=[[The Telegraph (Calcutta)|The Telegraph]]|accessdate=26 March 2012|location=Calcutta, India|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322220245/http://www.telegraphindia.com/1120316/jsp/entertainment/story_15255285.jsp|archivedate=22 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Characters ===
Before the shooting of the film began, Vidya started to use a prosthetic belly to look as close to authentically pregnant as possible. According to news reports, she met doctors and pregnant women to learn about the typical lifestyle and nuances of a pregnant woman, and also made lists of rules and superstitions followed by pregnant women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://zeenews.india.com/entertainment/movies/vidya-balan-gets-into-character-of-pregnant-woman-for-kahaani_104909.htm|title=Vidya Balan gets into character of pregnant woman for ''Kahaani''|publisher=Zee News|agency=[[Asian News International]] (ANI)|accessdate=26 March 2012|date=30 January 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120201033124/http://zeenews.india.com/entertainment/movies/vidya-balan-gets-into-character-of-pregnant-woman-for-kahaani_104909.htm|archivedate=1 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vidya said that during her college days she often used to imitate pregnant ladies during stand-up acting among friends, an experience that helped her during the shooting.&lt;ref name="cakewalk"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/vidya-balan-the-dirty-picutre-kahaani-paa-heyy-babyy/1/168320.html|title=Playing pregnant woman was cakewalk for Vidya Balan|work=India Today|agency=IANS|date=11 January 2012|accessdate=3 February 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111103132/http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/vidya-balan-the-dirty-picutre-kahaani-paa-heyy-babyy/1/168320.html|archivedate=11 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While briefing Saswata Chatterjee about his character, the cold-blooded killer Bob Biswas, Ghosh used the phrase ''"Binito Bob"'' (meaning polite Bob), which crystallised the notion of Bob's manners. Further discussions led to the inclusion of paunch and a bald patch. Chatterjee devised the mannerism of rubbing his nails together as some Indians believe doing that helps prevent hair loss. The mannerism was well-noted and praised by the viewers.&lt;ref name="toi 30march12chatterjee" /&gt; Ghosh was surprised at how Bob Biswas was greeted by fans as a cult figure. He emphasised that the deliberate ordinariness of Bob Biswas was portrayed so convincingly by Chatterjee that the viewers can expect Bob to be around them at any time and any place.&lt;ref name="Pop art on Saswata # TOI"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-03-22/news-interviews/31224239_1_sujoy-ghosh-fan-frenzy-character|title=Pop art on Saswata Chatterjee's character|first=Roshni|last=Mukherjee|newspaper=The Times of India|agency=TNN|accessdate=11 June 2012|date=22 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parambrata Chatterjee said in an interview that he did not identify with the Rana character, owing to the difference between his own urban upbringing and Rana's rural background.&lt;ref name="param ready"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/im-not-thinking-of-future-in-bollywood-parambrata-chatterjee/927457/0|title=I'm not thinking of a future in Bollywood: Parambrata Chatterjee|first=Namita|last=Nivas|newspaper=The Indian Express|accessdate=26 March 2012|date=23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chatterjee visited police stations and did some research "on their work, mindset and other relevant things" to prepare for the role.&lt;ref name="param ready" /&gt; The character Khan was envisaged as a ruthless, arrogant, expletive-spewing officer who cares nothing about the emotional or social consequences of his behaviour.&lt;ref name="ghosh starananda interview khan"&gt;{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtNMKGLGbCU|title=Sujoy Ghosh, director of ''Kahaani'', exclusive interview with Star Ananda|publisher=Star Ananda|people=Ghosh, Sujoy|type=Television production|language=Bengali|date=March 2012|time=8:15|accessdate=30 March 2012|registration=yes|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150711015401/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtNMKGLGbCU|archivedate=11 July 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Siddiqui said that he was surprised on being offered the role, and wondered how he could portray the arrogance needed for the character.&lt;ref name="siddiqui prep"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-03-15/news-interviews/31196319_1_roles-actors-sarfarosh|title=Nawazuddin Siddiqui on a roll|first=Priyanka|last=Dasgupta|newspaper=The Times of India|agency=TNN|accessdate=26 March 2012|date=15 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ghosh built Khan as a character with lean physical build but full of mental strength, loyalty and patriotism.

Ghosh chose the guest house in which the protagonist stays after noticing it during his visit to a neighbouring hotel in April 2010. He booked it for 10 days for {{INRConvert|40|k}}, and requested the guest-house employees to keep the shooting schedule a secret. Choosing a room with windows overlooking a busy road, he proceeded to give it an old-fashioned look by replacing the windows' designer grilles with old-fashioned wooden ones, and by painting the room with some rough patches.&lt;ref name="StarChamber" /&gt;

A recurring theme is the fleeting hint of romance between Rana and Vidya. Ghosh said that this delicate romance was "the most progressive thing" in the film—a suggestion that a man could fall in love with a pregnant woman. The director explained that the boy was initially "fascinated by someone who is literally a hero in his eyes", as Rana was awed by the computer skills of Vidya. Gradually, the fascinated boy moves into a zone where he tries to protect her.&lt;ref name="ibn ghosh interview romance"&gt;{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaNZSI4zX2o|title=Rajeev Masand interview with director Sujoy Ghosh on ''Kahaani''|publisher=CNN-IBN|people=Ghosh, Sujoy|type=Television production|date=March 2012|time=2:07|accessdate=30 March 2012|df=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150712021551/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaNZSI4zX2o|archivedate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Traffic in Kolkata.jpg|thumb|left|A road in Kolkata showing congested traffic and yellow taxis. The skillful portrayal of the city in the film was noted by reviewers.|alt=A road in Kolkata showing congested traffic and yellow taxis]]

Some reviewers note that a major protagonist is Kolkata itself, which is "brimming with warm, sympathetic inhabitants".&lt;ref name="rediff Review" /&gt; A review in Rediff.com notes that the director pays a "fond yet understated tribute" to the city by incorporating imagery such as "yellow taxis, leisurely trams, congested traffic, claustrophobic metros, dilapidated brick houses, tapering alleys, rajnigandhas,{{efn|''Rajanigandha'' ([[tuberose]]) flowers are used in religious and social events in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=A.

Ghosh acknowledges the allusions to Ray's films. In one scene, Vidya asks the manager of the guest house why there is no hot water although the signboard had claimed "running hot water". The manager explains that the sign refers for his errand boy, who runs to deliver hot water in a kettle whenever required. This alludes to a similar scene in Ray's ''[[Joi Baba Felunath (film)|Joi Baba Felunath]]'' (1979).&lt;ref name="anandabazreview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anandabazar.com/archive/1120317/17cine1.html|title='Asamanya' |trans-title = Extraordinary|first=Jagari|last=Bandyopadhyay|work=Anandabazar Patrika|language=Bengali|accessdate=18 March 2012|date=17 March 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322045703/http://www.anandabazar.com/archive/1120317/17cine1.html|archivedate=22 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''The Telegraph'', Ghosh says that the way Vidya looks out and moves from window to window in the guest-house room is reminiscent of Ray's ''[[Charulata]]'' (1964), where the actress [[Madhabi Mukherjee]] enjoys glimpses of the outside world through the blinds of windows. He also acknowledges the influence of ''[[Mahanagar]]'' (1963), another Ray film noted for its portrayal of Kolkata. According to the director, he was inspired by particular scenes of Ray's ''[[Nayak (1966 film)|Nayak]]'' (1966) to plan the portrayal of complex emotional issues between Vidya and the police officer Rana, especially Rana's awe in the presence of Vidya. Ghosh expresses his inspiration from Ray's ''[[Aranyer Dinratri]]'' (1970) in which Ray "wanted the audience to be inside the car with the four guys all the time. So the camera never leaves the car." Ghosh shot a similar scene, hoping the audience would become "like Vidya's fellow passenger."&lt;ref name="gupta ghosh interview tt"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1120314/jsp/entertainment/story_15245793.jsp|title=Salaam namaste|first=Pratim D.|last=Gupta|newspaper=The Telegraph|accessdate=18 March 2012|date=14 March 2012|location=Calcutta, India|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316180512/http://www.telegraphindia.com/1120314/jsp/entertainment/story_15245793.jsp|archivedate=16 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides Ray's films, Ghosh also admits inspiration from what he calls "visually striking" films of the 1970s and 1980s, such as ''[[Deewaar]]'' (1975).&lt;ref name="gupta ghosh interview tt" /&gt; Critics have compared the fake-pregnancy twist of ''Kahaani'' with the 2004 American psychological thriller ''[[Taking Lives (film)|Taking Lives]]''.&lt;ref name="anandabazreview" /&gt; The sequences towards the end that explain the missing pieces of the mystery were compared with ''[[The Usual Suspects]]'' (1995).&lt;ref name="choprahindustan" /&gt; Ghosh writes that the film was heavily influenced by the colour scheme of the ''Pratima Visarjan'', a c.1915 watercolour by the [[Bengal School of Art|Bengal School]] artist [[Gaganendranath Tagore]].&lt;ref name="abp 7 april ghosh" /&gt;

The musical score was composed by [[Vishal–Shekhar]], and the lyrics for the film's six songs were written by Vishal Dadlani, Anvita Dutt and Sandeep Srivastava. Several of [[R. D. Burman]]'s Hindi and Bengali compositions were used in the background. An album of the music was released on 22 February 2012 and subsequently on the [[Music download|digital music]] platform [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[iTunes]] India since its inception from mid-2012.&lt;ref name="apple release"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/in/album/kahaani-original-motion-picture/id507392970|title=Kahaani (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)|publisher=iTunes|work=Vishal-Shekhar|accessdate=9 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105115627/https://itunes.apple.com/in/album/kahaani-original-motion-picture/id507392970|archivedate=5 November 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The soundtrack received positive reviews, and was praised for its amalgamation of Bengali and Hindi lyrics. A review in [[CNN-IBN]] states that the song "Ami Shotti Bolchi" is able to partially convey the feel of Kolkata, and that the soundtrack "features right voices with the overall mood of the album".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/music-review-kahaani-focuses-on-nostalgia/232715-45-76.html|title=Music review: ''Kahaani'' focuses on nostalgia|first=Rohit|last=Vats|publisher=CNN-IBN|accessdate=30 March 2012|date=24 February 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418153137/http://ibnlive.in.com/news/music-review-kahaani-focuses-on-nostalgia/232715-45-76.html|archivedate=18 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Mumbai Mirror]]'' rated the album with 3 stars out of 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-02-29/music-reviews/31110240_1_vishal-shekhar-special-appearance-guitars|title=''Kahaani'' music review|newspaper=The Times of India|author=[[Mumbai Mirror]]|accessdate=15 May 2012|date=29 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewing the soundtrack for [[Indiatimes]], Anand Vaishnav commented that "''Kahaani'', as an album, stays honest to the theme of the film".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.indiatimes.com/bollywood/music-review-kahaani-12663.html|title=Music review—''Kahaani''|first=Anand|last=Vaishnav|work=[[The Times of India]]|accessdate=15 May 2012|date=15 February 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317000028/http://www.indiatimes.com/bollywood/music-review-kahaani-12663.html|archivedate=17 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 March 2012, prior to release, Kolkata Metro authorities objected to a scene in which Vidya is pushed by a man onto the tracks as a train arrives. They requested that the scene be removed, as it would remind people of the past suicides, which had tarnished the railway's image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://zeenews.india.com/entertainment/movies/kahaani-s-dream-kolkata-metro-s-nightmare_107035.htm|title=''Kahaani''{{'}}s dream, Kolkata metro's nightmare

Ferris Building contains exhibition space, the Material ConneXion Library, and additional classroom and office space.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kcad.edu/about/history/|title=History  {{!}}  Kendall College of Art and Design of Ferris State University|website=www.kcad.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
David Wolcott Kendall was a nationally known furniture designer, during Grand Rapids' heyday as "Furniture City". The David Wolcott Memorial School was established in 1928 by the will of Helen M. Kendall, his widow. The school opened in 1931, offering a two-year program in design, with 35 students. The school was located at 145 Fountain Street, at the western edge of what is now [[Heritage Hill Historic District (Grand Rapids, Michigan)|Heritage Hill]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1947, growing from an influx of students following World War 2, the school's name was changed to Kendall School of Design. In 1961, having outgrown the Heritage Hill site, it relocated to 1110 College Avenue NE in the Highland Park neighborhood. In 1977, Kendall began offering baccalaureate degrees, and in 1981 was accredited by the National Association of Schools of Art and Design. It moved again, to the seven-story Manufacturer's Building at 111 Division Avenue North (on the corner of Fountain Street, a short distance from the original site) in 1984.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The name of the school was changed in 1987 to Kendall College of Art and Design. As part of a merger with Ferris State University, the college bought the adjacent Interstate Building in the 1990s, constructing an atrium which became the combined structures' main entrance at 17 Fountain Street NW. In 2000 the school became formally Kendall College of Art and Design of Ferris State University, and it continued renovating the new space for studio and classroom use. After the [[Grand Rapids Art Museum]] moved out of the Federal Building to the north, the university took ownership of it and reopened it as the Woodbridge N. Ferris Building in 2012 as part of the Kendall campus. In 2013, the college merged with the [[Urban Institute for Contemporary Art]], which had recently relocated to a new facility a few blocks to the south, and continues to operate as an arts organization.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

; ''Collecting Cartridges: The Price Guide for Classic Video Game Collectors'': ({{ISBN|9-781545-196113}}) By Michael S. Richardson.  The Atari VCS (2600), 5200, 7800, Mattel Intellivision, Coleco Colecovision and Milton Bradley Microvision. Collecting Cartridges is much more than a book, for many it’s a passion – likely the closest thing to a time machine to our childhoods and a period of time where video game consoles were a completely new concept. It’s technology that demands a fascination, not just by those of us that lived it, but by future generations who wish to enjoy part of this very unique period of time. This guide is a work of love. It came about through the lack of any other detailed price guide that was really reflective of what classic video games, in similar conditions, were selling for. The information took years to compile, but became a personal resource being referenced regularly. There was no reason that if one person found it helpful, many others might as well. The layout of this guide is extremely simple to reference. It explains, through words and pictures, how to categorize any particular game title by its condition. The game titles are then broken down by console, publisher and name. Each title generally has multiple conditions reflective of what the same game would be bought and sold for. Most important is the fact that these prices are, in no way, arbitrary. The prices are an average of each title’s actual selling price. Formulas are used to fill in the value of each game under varying conditions. Great care has also been provided to reference the author(s) of each game. These designers were the proverbial ‘rock stars’ of the day. Part of the enjoyment of collecting is getting to know each programmer and their library of work. This guide contains an appendix which provides a very thorough cross reference. Along with historical information on each console and adding a few fond memories, this guide should be a part of any classic gamer’s library. “Don’t pay too much or accept too little. If you have anything to do with classic video game systems, you need this guide. This is the most accurate way of determining a game’s value.”  Published April 24, 2017.

The '''Mikhailovsky Theatre''' ({{lang-ru|Миха́йловский теа́тр}}) is one of [[Russia]]'s oldest [[opera]] and [[ballet]] houses. It was founded in 1833 and is situated in a historical building on 1, [[Arts Square (Saint Petersburg)|Arts Square]] in [[Saint Petersburg]]. It is named after [[Grand Duke Michael Pavlovich of Russia]].

== History ==
=== Before 1917 ===
The theatre was established in 1833 by decree of Tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]].

Before the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|1917 Revolution]], the Mikhailovsky did not have its own resident company. Performances were given either by a French company, hired by the Russian Imperial Theatres, or at the end of the century by the [[Mariinsky Theatre]] and [[Alexandrinsky Theatre]] companies. Most of the great French actors of the period performed at the theatre, including [[Jeanne Sylvanie Arnould-Plessy]], [[Rachel Félix]], [[Lucien Guitry]] and [[Sarah Bernhardt]], as well as singers such as [[Hortense Schneider]]. Both classical and contemporary authors and composers had their works produced to great acclaim in French. Plays by [[Molière]], [[Victor Hugo]], [[Victorien Sardou]], and  [[Alexandre Dumas, fils]] and [[operettas]] by [[Jacques Offenbach]] were praised by the intelligentsia and the Russian aristocracy, such as [[Tolstoy]] and [[Tchaikovsky]].

When the [[Bolshevik]]s took power the French company was forced to leave Russia, and in 1917 the Mikhailovsky Theatre was closed.

=== Communist era ===

On March 6, 1918 the theatre was reopened as an opera theatre. Shortly afterwards the Mikhailovsky started changing its names: in 1918–20 it was called the Ex-Mikhailovsky Theatre, in 1920 it was renamed to the State Academic Comic Opera Theatre, in 1921 the theatre changed its name to the Maly Operny Teatr (Maly Opera Theatre), in 1926 it got the name of the Leningrad State Academic Maly Opera Theatre, MALEGOT for short. New management and artists followed. From 1920 to 1930 the Maly Operny Teatr established itself as one of the leading experimental stages in Russian new [[musical theatre]]. [[Shostakovich]] made his debut at the Maly Operny: [[Samuil Samosud]] conducted world premiere performances of his ''[[The Nose (opera)|The Nose]]'' and ''[[Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District (opera)|Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District]]'', the famous [[Vsevolod Meyerhold]] production of ''[[The Queen of Spades (opera)|The Queen of Spades]]'' was staged there, and the [[world premiere]] of [[Prokofiev]]'s epic opera ''[[War and Peace (Prokofiev)|War and Peace]]'' took place on the theatre's stage on June 12, 1946.&lt;ref name=official/&gt;

=== 1930: Creation of the Ballet Company ===

In 1930s Russian choreographer [[Fyodor Lopukhov]] founded the ballet company of the Theatre. The first ballet premiere, ''[[Les millions d'Arlequin|Harlequinade]]'', choreographed by Lopukhov, took place on June 6, 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citywalls.ru/house826.html?s=nhu3hgcosjoabru2p062mosrj6 |title=Михайловский театр - Театр Оперы и балета им.

=== The 2000s revival ===

From 1989 to 2007, the theatre bore the name of [[Modest Mussorgsky]], subsequently returning to its original name the Mikhailovsky Theatre.&lt;ref name=official&gt;[http://www.mikhailovsky.ru/theatre/ History of the Mikhaylovsky Theatre], official site.

In 2007, in what was seen as a controversial move, Russian businessman [[Vladimir Kekhman]] was appointed as General Director of the theatre. Vladimir Kekhman's strategy was to spend prolific amounts of money on ballet stars to build the Theatre's popularity.&lt;ref name="independent 6263239"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/russia-is-rocked-by-a-bolshoi-revolution-6263239.html|title=Russia is rocked by a Bolshoi revolution|website=Independent.co.uk|date=17 November 2011|author=Shaun Walker|accessdate=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He built a business-based organizational structures to the Ballet, donated 1 billion [[rouble]]s ($40m US) for renovation of the building, and invited [[Elena Obraztsova]] and [[Farouk Ruzimatov]] to coordinate the artistic revival of the Mikhailovsky.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/jan/01/mikhailovsky-ballet-bolshoi|title=Who’s pulling the strings in Russia’s Ballet Revolution?|website=Theguardian.com|date=1 January 2012|author=Luke Jennings|accessdate=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Elena Obraztsova was appointed Artistic Director of the Mikhailovsky Opera and Farouk Ruzimatov became Artistic Director of the Mikhailovsky Ballet. However, Obraztsova resigned in 2008 and Ruzimatov in 2009. From 2009 both Obraztsova and Ruzimatov held a seat on the Artistic Committee of the Theatre.

The ballet company of the Mikhailovsky Theatre made its London debut in July 2008 in [[London Coliseum]] arranged by the British ex-dancer [[Gavin Roebuck]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}. This season helped bring the company international recognition and led to a nomination for the Best Foreign Dance Company Award at the National Dance Awards in 2008, though Mikhailovsky lost out to the [[New York City Ballet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationaldanceawards.com/dance2008/foreign_dance.htm |title=National Dance Awards Best Foreign Dance Company |website=Nationaldanceawards.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2009, [[Mikhail Messerer]] was appointed Ballet Master in Chief of the Theater. For the Mikhailovsky, Messerer staged numerous ballets, including ''[[Swan Lake]]'', ''[[Don Quixote (ballet)|Don Quixote]]'', ''[[Flames of Paris]]'', ''[[Laurencia (ballet)|Laurencia]]'', ''[[Cinderella]]'' and ''[[Le Corsaire]]''. In 2009 - 2011 Peter Feranec was the Theatre's Musical Director.  [[Mikhail Tatarnikov]] began his tenure as the Theatre’s musical director in 2012 (he resigned in October 2018).   The Mikhailovsky Ballet returned to London in 2010, again arranged with Gavin Roebuck{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}.
 
From 2011 till 2013 [[Nacho Duato]] worked as the Mikhailovsky Ballet's Artistic Director, with Messerer as the Theatre's Ballet Master in Chief. Several of Duato ballets received their world premieres at the Mikhailovsky.

Under Mikhail Messerer's leadership the Mikhailovsky Ballet has won the Best Ballet Company award by the British Critics' Circle for it's 3rd London season in 2013. 
Also in 2013, the Mikhailovsky Opera made its debut at the Savonlinna Opera Festival,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.operafestival.fi/news/Mikhailovsky-Theatre-to-perform-Eugene-Onegin-and--Un-ballo-in-maschera-at-the-Savonlinna-Opera-Festival/3qe3bat3/77d5f26e-4801-4cf9-9409-01c3006d872b |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109134630/http://www.operafestival.fi/news/Mikhailovsky-Theatre-to-perform-Eugene-Onegin-and--Un-ballo-in-maschera-at-the-Savonlinna-Opera-Festival/3qe3bat3/77d5f26e-4801-4cf9-9409-01c3006d872b |archivedate=2013-11-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in November 2014, the Mikhailovsky Ballet debuted in the US at New York's [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts|Lincoln Center]].

In October 2012, Vladimir Kekhman was declared bankrupt at London's High Court of Justice, but he assured that the operation of the Mikhailovsky Theatre was not at risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theartsdesk.com/dance/bankruptcy-wont-stop-ballet-0|title=Bankruptcy won't stop the ballet|website=Theartdesk.com|date=28 January 2013|author=Ismene Brown|accessdate=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2013, top ballet dancer [[Natalia Osipova]] left the company to join [[The Royal Ballet]] in London, after she had made the headlines in December 2011 for choosing the Mikhailosky Theatre over the [[Bolshoi Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/dance/9981660/Natalia-Osipova-to-leave-Russia-for-London-principal-dancer-role.html|title=Natalia Osipova to leave Russia for London principal dancer role|website=Telegraph.co.uk|date=9 April 2013|accessdate=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="independent 6263239"/&gt;

In December 2013, Altynai Asylmuratova became Adviser to General Director of the Theatre (she resigned in March 2014). In 2013 Vasily Barkhatov was appointed Artistic Director of the Mikhailovsky Opera (he resigned in 2014). In 2014 Vasily Petrenko became the Theatre's Principal Guest Conductor (he resigned in 2015).
In 2015, the tenor [[Neil Shicoff]] was appointed Chief of the Mikhailovsky Opera,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.operanews.com/Opera_News_Magazine/2015/5/News/Shicoff_Chief_of_Opera_Mikhailovsky_Theatre.html|title=St. Petersburg’s Mikhailovsky Theatre Appoints Tenor Neil Shicoff as Company's Chief of Opera|website=Operanews.com|date=5 May 2015|accessdate=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and from July 2017 till July 2018, the bass Paata Burchuladze was the Chief of the Mikhailovsky Opera.

Mikhail Messerer resigned from the Theatre in September 2018.

The '''National Society of Mural Painters''' ('''NSMP''') is an American artists' organization originally known as '''The Mural Painters'''. The charter of the society is to advance the techniques and standards for the design and execution of mural art for the enrichment of architecture in the United States.    

==Background==
The NSMP was founded in 1895, in an era of [[Beaux-Arts architecture]] in America, a time when public architecture was integrated with murals, sculpture, mosaics and other artwork, coordinated and themed to assert the identity of the building.  Parallel organizations associated with the same principles of integrated public art include the [[National Sculpture Society]], which originally included a large percentage of architectural sculptors, and the [[Beaux-Arts Institute of Design]], founded in 1916 as the teaching wing of the Society of Beaux-Arts Architects.

Still in existence after more than a hundred years, the society presents exhibitions and organizes competitions.  The NSMP is a member of the Fine Arts Federation of New York.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25496">'''Fine art nude photography''' is a [[genre]] of [[fine-art photography]] which [[Nude photography|depicts the nude]] human body with an emphasis on form, [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]], emotional content, and other [[aesthetic]] qualities.

The [[Nude (art)|nude]] has been a prominent subject of [[photography]] since its invention, and played an important role in establishing photography as a [[fine art]] medium.

The distinction between fine art photography and other subgenres is not absolute, but there are certain defining characteristics.

[[Erotic photography|Erotic]] interest, although often present, is secondary,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Clark, Kenneth| year=1956| title=The Nude: A Study in Ideal Form|chapter=1. The Naked and the Nude|publisher=Princeton University Press| location=Princeton| isbn=0-691-01788-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which distinguishes art photography from both [[glamour photography]], which focuses on showing the subject of the photograph in the most attractive way, and [[pornographic photography]], which has the primary purpose of [[sexual arousal|sexually arousing]] the viewer. Fine art photographs are also not taken to serve any journalistic, scientific, or other practical purpose.

The distinction between these is not always clear, and photographers, as with other artists, tend to make their own case in characterizing their work,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.krosenthal.com/photography.html|author=Rosenthal,Karin|title=About My Work|accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lavondyss.com/silverbeauty/about.htm|author=Schiesser, Jody|title=Silverbeauty - Artist Statement|accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marcusart.net/|author=Mok, Marcus|title=Artist's Statement|accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the viewer may have a different assessment.

The nude remains a controversial subject in all media, but more so with photography due to its inherent realism.&lt;ref name="Met"/&gt; The male nude has been less common than the female, and more rarely exhibited or published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Weiermair, Peter  |author2=Nielander, Claus  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Hidden Image: Photographs of the Male Nude in the 19th and 20th Centuries|publisher=MIT Press, 1988|isbn=0-262-23137-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of children as subjects in nude photography is especially controversial.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Those early photographers in [[Western culture]]s who sought to establish photography as a fine art medium, frequently chose women as the subjects for their nude photographs, in poses that accorded with traditional [[Nude (art)|nudes]] in other media. Before nude photography, art nudes usually used allusions to [[classical antiquity]]; gods and warriors, goddesses and nymphs. Depictions of male and female nudes in traditional art mediums had been mostly limited to portrayals as an ideal warrior or athlete (for men) or that emphasized divinity and reproduction (for women),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/nuan/hd_nuan.htm|title=Sorabella, Jean. January 2008. The nude in western art and its beginnings in antiquity. In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000–.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and early photographic art first engaged these archetypes as well. Poses, [[Photographic lighting|lighting]], [[soft focus]], [[vignetting]] and hand [[Photo manipulation|retouching]] were employed to create photographic images that rose to the level of art comparable to the other arts at that time.&lt;ref name="Met"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-museum/press-room/exhibitions/2012/naked-before-the-camera|title=Naked before the Camera|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main limitation was that early photographs were [[monochrome]]. Although 19th century artists in other media often used photographs as substitutes for live models, the best of these photographs were also intended as works of art in their own right.

Nude photography was more controversial than painted nude works, and in order to avoid censorship some early nude photographs were described as "studies for artists",&lt;ref name="Met" /&gt; while others were used as references by artists to do drawings and paintings as a supplement to live [[Model (art)|models]]. [[Eugène Delacroix]] was an early adopter of the practice of using photographs taken specifically for him by his friend, [[Eugène Durieu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Two Delacroix Drawings Made from Photographs|author=Van Deren Coke|journal=Art Journal|volume=21|issue=3|date=Spring 1962|pages=172–174|publisher=College Art Association|jstor=774417|doi=10.2307/774417}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edgar Degas]] made his own photographs that he used for painting references.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artObjectDetails?artobj=47047|title=After the Bath, Woman Drying Her Back|publisher=The J. Paul Getty Museum|accessdate=2013-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
As fine art photography first embraced and then moved passed classical allegorical imagery, both male and female photographers began to use the male nude as another medium to examine issues of representation and identity, sexuality and voyeurism.&lt;ref&gt;Weiermair, Peter (Ed.). (1994). ''The male nude: A male view: An anthology''. Zurich: Edition Stemmle.&lt;/ref&gt;

Photographing nudes (and particularly male nudes) became a way for women artists to engage the subject of “the nude” from the position of power traditionally reserved for male artists;&lt;ref&gt;Weiermair, Peter (Ed.). (1995). ''Male nudes by women: An anthology''. Zurich: Edition Stemmle.&lt;/ref&gt; alternatively, nude self-portraiture allowed men to begin to re-evaluate accepted definitions of sensuality and masculinity by photographing themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Massengill, Reed. (2005). ''Self-exposure : the male nude self portrait''. New York: Universe.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Alfred Stieglitz ====
[[Alfred Stieglitz]] is a major figure in bringing modern art to America by exhibiting the new genre of art in his New York galleries at the beginning of the 20th century. He is known to the public perhaps more for his relationship with [[Georgia O'Keeffe]], whose nude photos he exhibited in 1921 while married to someone else.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 2, 2001|title=ART REVIEW: Proselytizing for Modernism|first=Michael|last=Kimmelman}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Stieglitz used the camera as a kind of mirror. 'My photographs,' he wrote in 1925, 'are ever born of an inner need--an Experience of Spirit. I do not make ''pictures . . .'' I have a vision of life and I try to find equivalents for it sometimes in the form of photographs.' Often he would write of ''true seeing'' and of ''inness''. As O'Keeffe noted rightly, the man she knew so well was 'always photographing himself.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=February 6, 1983|title=Looking Back at the Seer of the New - Alfred Stieglitz: The Man, The Battle, The Art|author=Paul Richard|page=L1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Imogen Cunningham ====
[[Imogen Cunningham]] began taking photographs in Seattle in 1905, in the soft-focused ''[[Pictorialism|pictorialist]]'' style popular at that time; but she is best known for the sharp-focused modern style she developed later. She is also attributed as the first woman photographer to take a nude photo of a man (her husband, [[Roi Partridge]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sampling Imogen Cunningham's Vibrant Diversity|author=Charles Hagan |newspaper=New York Times|date=13 Oct 1995|page=C27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the work of [[Judy Dater]], one particular photo, ''Imogen and Twinka'', became one of the most recognizable images caught by an American photographer. It features a 91 year old Imogen Cunningham and a nude [[Twinka Thiebaud]].&lt;ref&gt;Fallis, Greg. [http://www.utata.org/sundaysalon/judy-dater/ Judy Dater], Sunday Salon with Greg Fallis, UTATA.org&lt;/ref&gt; The photo was the first adult full frontal nude photograph published in [[Life (magazine)|''Life'']] magazine, in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine, Bicentennial Special Issue (1976) called: ''Remarkable American Women 1776-1976''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Man Ray ====
After [[World War I]], [[avant-garde]] photographers became more experimental in their portrayal of nudity, using reflective distortions and printing techniques to create abstractions or depicting real life rather than classical allusions.

Beginning in the late 1920s [[Man Ray]] experimented with the Sabattier, or [[solarization]] process, a technique that won him critical esteem, especially from the [[Surrealism|Surrealists]]. Many of the central figures of Surrealism—[[André Breton|Breton]], [[René Magritte|Magritte]], [[Salvador Dalí|Dalí]]—followed his example in using photography in addition to other media. Other photographers, such as [[Maurice Tabard]] and [[Raoul Ubac]], were directly inspired by Man Ray’s techniques, while photographers such as [[André Kertész]] and [[Brassaï]] were indirectly influenced by his innovative approach to the medium.

==== Edward Weston ====
[[Edward Weston]] evolved a particularly American aesthetic, using a [[Large format (photography)|large format]] camera to capture images of [[Nature photography|nature]] and [[Landscape photography|landscapes]] as well as nudes, establishing photography as a fine arts medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creativephotography.org/artists/edward-weston|title=Edward Weston|publisher=University of Arizona, Center for Creative Photography|accessdate=2013-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937 Weston became the first photographer to be awarded a [[Guggenheim Fellowship|John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Fellowship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccp.uair.arizona.edu/item/234|title=Edward Weston Photographs|publisher=Center for Creative Photography at the University of Arizona Libraries|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725011346/http://ccp.uair.arizona.edu/item/234|archivedate=2010-07-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a famous example of Weston's work see: [[Charis Wilson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Conger, Amy| title=Edward Weston: The Form of Nude|publisher=Phaidon Press|year=2006|isbn=0-7148-4573-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Bill Brandt ====
[[Bill Brandt]] is best known for a series of nudes developed primarily between 1945 and 1961, that are both personal and universal, sensual and strange, collectively exemplifying the “sense of wonder” that is paramount in his photographs. Brandt’s work is unpredictable not only in the range of his subjects but also in his printing style, which varied widely throughout his career. This exhibition is the first to emphasize the beauty of Brandt’s finest prints, and to trace the arc of their evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/visit/calendar/exhibitions/1343|title=Bill Brandt: Shadow and Light|publisher=The Museum of Modern Art|accessdate=2013-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Diane Arbus ====
Many fine art photographers have a variety of subjects in their work, the nude being one. [[Diane Arbus]] was attracted to unusual people in unusual settings, including a nudist camp. [[Lee Friedlander]] had more conventional subjects, one being [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] as a young model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/Music/02/12/madonna.photo.auction/index.html?iref=mpstoryview |title=Nude photo of Madonna goes for $37,500 |date=February 12, 2009 |publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The distinction between fine art and glamour is often one of [[marketing]], with fine art being sold through galleries or dealers in limited editions signed by the artist, and glamour photos being distributed through mass media.

For some, the difference is in the gaze of the model, with glamour models looking into the camera, while art models do not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| author=Conrad,Donna  | publisher=PhotoVision| title = A Conversation with Ruth Bernhard| newspaper = Vol. 1 No. 3| year = 2000  | url = http://www.photovisionmagazine.com/articles/bernhard.interview.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glamour and [[Fashion photography|fashion]] photographers have aspired to fine art status in some of their work. One of the first was [[Irving Penn]], who progressed from ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' magazine to photographing fashion models such as [[Kate Moss]] nude. [[Richard Avedon]], [[Helmut Newton]] and [[Annie Leibovitz]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/annie_leibovitz/|title=Exhibitions: Annie Leibovitz: A Photographer's Life, 1990–2005|publisher=The Brooklyn Museum|accessdate=10 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; have followed a similar path with [[portrait]]s of the famous, many of them nude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2006/feb/08/photography.art|title=Not naked but nude|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=12 November 2012|location=London|first=Jonathan|last=Jones|date=2006-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; or partially clothed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2008/06/miley200806|title=Miley Knows Best|publisher=Vanity Fair|year=2008|accessdate=11 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the post-modern era, where fame is often the subject of fine art,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/feb/22/andy-warhol-legacy-lives-on|title=Andy Warhol's legacy lives on in the factory of fame|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=1 November 2012|location=London|first=Alex|last=Needham|date=2012-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Avedon's photo of [[Nastassja Kinski]] with a python, and Leibovitz's magazine covers of [[More Demi Moore|Demi Moore pregnant]] and in [[Demi's Birthday Suit|body paint]], have become iconic. The work of [[Joyce Tenneson]] has gone the other way, from fine art with a unique, soft-focus style showing woman at all stages of life to portraiture of famous people and fashion photography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joyce Tenneson|url=http://www.tenneson.com/content/bio|accessdate=2013-05-18}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Although nude photographers have largely worked within established forms that show bodies as sculptural abstractions, some, such as [[Robert Mapplethorpe]], have created works that deliberately blur the boundaries between [[Erotic photography|erotica]] and art.

Several photographers have become controversial because of their nude photographs of underage subjects.&lt;ref name="Photo Flap"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reason.com/archives/1998/05/01/photo-flap|title=Photo Flap|publisher=Reason|year=1998|accessdate=11 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Hamilton (photographer)|David Hamilton]] often used erotic themes,&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Jock Sturges]] celebrates the beauty of people in naturist settings without emphasis on sexuality.&lt;ref name="Sturges, Jock and Phillips, Jayne Anne 1991"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Sturges, Jock  |author2=Phillips, Jayne Anne |lastauthoramp=yes | title=[[The Last Day of Summer (book)|The Last Day of Summer]] |publisher=Aperture |year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sturges, Jock 1994"&gt;{{cite book | author=Sturges, Jock |title=[[Radiant Identities: Photographs by Jock Sturges]]|publisher=Aperture|year=1994|ISBN=0-89381-595-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sally Mann]] was raised in rural Virginia, in a locale were [[Nude swimming|skinny-dipping]] in a river was common, so many of her most famous photographs are of her own children swimming in the nude.&lt;ref name="Mann1992"&gt;{{cite book | author1=Mann, Sally |author2=Price, Reynolds| title=Immediate family| publisher=Aperture| year=1992| ISBN=0-89381-523-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Less well-known photographers have been charged as criminals for photos of their own children.&lt;ref name="Powell, Lynn 2010"&gt;{{cite book |last=Powell|first=Lynn|title=Framing Innocence: A Mother's Photographs, a Prosecutor's Zeal, and a Small Town's Response|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BWshU7qUi-0C|publisher=The New Press|year=2010|isbn=978-1-59558-626-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Body image]] has become a topic explored by many photographers working with models whose bodies do not conform to conventional prejudices about beauty.&lt;ref name="R.Michelson Galleries"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rmichelson.com/artist_pages/nimoy/pages/MaxBeaut.htm|title=Leonard Nimoy: The Full Body Project|publisher=R.Michelson Galleries|accessdate=11 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==

===Public perception===
At the beginning of the 21st century, it has become difficult to make an artistic statement in nude photography, given the proliferation of non-artistic and pornographic images which taints the subject in the perception of most viewers, limiting the opportunities to exhibit or publish the images. When they appear in mainstream consumer magazines such as ''[[Popular Photography]]'', ''PC Photo'', and ''[[Shutterbug (magazine)|Shutterbug]]''; the editors receive sufficient negative response that they tend to reject the work of serious nude-image photographers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deitcher|first=Kenneth|year=2008|title=A Figure Study Workshop|journal=PSA Journal|volume=74|issue=3|pages=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children as subjects===
Several photographers have become controversial because of their nude photographs of [[Minor (law)|underage]] subjects.&lt;ref name="Photo Flap"/&gt; [[David Hamilton (photographer)|David Hamilton]] often used erotic themes in books such as ''[[The Age of Innocence (Hamilton book)|The Age of Innocence]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Hamilton, David |title=[[The Age of Innocence (Hamilton book)|The Age of Innocence]]|publisher=Aurum Press|year=1995|ISBN=1-85410-304-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; which have caused controversy in both the US and the UK. [[Jock Sturges]] celebrates the beauty of people in [[Naturism|naturist]] settings&lt;ref name="Sturges, Jock and Phillips, Jayne Anne 1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sturges, Jock 1994"/&gt; and states that his work is not exploitative; however in 1990 the FBI raided his studio and made charges that were later dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogallery.com/Sturges_Jock/sturges-bio.html|title=Jock Sturges Biography}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Photo Lab Sets Off FBI Probe : Art: Jock Sturges' photographs of nude families are at issue|date=July 5, 1990|author=Harold Maass|newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the local nature of US laws on the issue, books of both Hamilton's and Sturges' photos have been ruled obscene in the states of Alabama, South Carolina, and Colorado.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/mar/08/news/mn-26778|title=Child Porn Fight Focuses on 2 Photographers' Books|date=March 8, 1998|author=J. R. Moehringer|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=2013-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar controversy emerged in Australia in 2008 when photographs by [[Bill Henson]] were taken from an exhibit due to complaints regarding nudes of a thirteen-year-old girl, but no changes were proved.

[[Sally Mann]] was raised in rural Virginia, in a locale where [[Nude swimming|skinny-dipping]] in a river was common, so many of her most famous photographs are of her own children swimming in the nude.&lt;ref name="Mann1992" /&gt; Less well-known photographers have been charged as criminals for photos of their own children.&lt;ref name="Powell, Lynn 2010"/&gt; Some writers characterize many of these images as sexualizing children regardless of artistic merit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sexualizing Children: Thoughts on Sally Mann|first=Mary|last=Gordon|journal=Salmagundi|issue=111|year=1996|pages=144–145|publisher=Skidmore College|jstor=40535995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Body image===
[[Body image]] has become a topic explored by many photographers working with models who do not conform to [[Norm (social)|conventional]] ideas about beauty. [[Leonard Nimoy]], after many years photographing conventionally beautiful professional models, realized that he was not capturing individual personalities, so he created a series with women interested in "[[Fat acceptance movement|Fat Liberation]]".&lt;ref name="R.Michelson Galleries"/&gt; Sally Mann's more recent nudes have been of her husband, whose body shows the effects of [[muscular dystrophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sally Mann at Gagosian Gallery|last=Kuspit|first=Donald|journal=[[Artforum]]|volume=48|issue=5|date=Jan 2010|pages=198–199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Erotic art===
Many contemporary artists push the boundaries by having work with both aesthetic qualities and [[Erotic photography|explicit sexuality]]. Late in his life [[Robert Mapplethorpe]] created work that was controversial in part by being on display in Washington, DC in a gallery receiving public funds.&lt;ref name="moral"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Art and the morality of the artist|last=Bernays|first=Anne|journal=The Chronicle of Higher Education|volume=39|issue=20|date=Jan 20, 1993|page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a Mapplethorpe retrospective opened at the Cincinnati [[Contemporary Arts Center]] in 1990, [[Dennis Barrie]] became the first American museum director to be criminally prosecuted for the contents of an [[Art exhibition|exhibition]]. Although explicit photos were placed in a separate room with a content warning, Barrie was charged with "pandering obscenity" and showing minors in a state of nudity, but a jury acquitted Barrie and the Arts Center of all charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ummsp.lsa.umich.edu/content/mapplethorpe-cincinnati-controversy-myth-and-legacy|title=Exhibiting Controversy: From Mapplethorpe to "Body Worlds" and Beyond|publisher=University of Michigan|accessdate=2013-05-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130615164032/http://ummsp.lsa.umich.edu/content/mapplethorpe-cincinnati-controversy-myth-and-legacy|archivedate=2013-06-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Palace of Karabakh Khans''' ({{Lang-az|Qarabağ xan sarayı}}), is a historic palace located in north-east part of [[Shusha]], [[Azerbaijan]]. The palace belongs to the highly artistic palace buildings of [[Azerbaijani architecture|Azerbaijan]] of the 18th and 19th centuries. It is currently in ruined condition.&lt;ref&gt;Под общей редакцией М. А. Казиева. Азербайджан (Исторические и достопримечательные места. Город Шуша. Дворец карабахских ханов. Издательство АН Азербайджанской ССР. 1960.&lt;/ref&gt;
==Design==
The palace consisted of a large number of rooms located on two floors, and a large T-shaped main hall, which was the compositional center of the entire palace. This hall was separated from the external space by enormous lifting windows-web, widely used in palace, residential and religious construction in the 18th and 19th centuries on the territory of modern [[Republic of Azerbaijan]].

'''Pourān Derakh'shandeh''' ({{lang-fa|پوران درخشنده}}) (born 27 March 1951 in [[Kermanshah]], [[Iran]]) is an Iranian film director, producer, screen writer, and researcher.

Derakh'shandeh graduated in film directing in 1975 from [[Iran Broadcasting College|Advanced School of Television and Cinema]] (مدرسه عالی تلویزیون و سینما) in Tehran. She started her professional career by making documentary films for the [[Kermanshah]] Television and subsequently for the Tehran Television. Her motion pictures include ''Relationship'' (1986), ''A Little Bird of Happiness'' (1987), ''Passing Through the Dust'' (1988), ''Lost Time'' (1989), ''A Love Without Frontier'' (1998), ''Candle in the Wind'' (2003), ''Wet Dream'' (2005), ''Eternal Children'' (2006), and ''Hush! Girls Don't Scream'' (2013).

At the time she began working at NIRT and Produced “Plague”; A documentary about plague disease in Kurdistan Province. Next year, she produced a documentary about the "Last Wednesday of the Year" ceremony custom in some areas of Iran, “End Wednesday” (1976). In 1978 she directed “Mineral Springs of Rah Haraz” and a trilogy documentary series about handicrafts in [[Kurdistan]] titled, “Moj, janamaz and sajadeh”, “Nazok kari” and “Short–napped coarse carpet”. The four-part “Synthetic and Natural Fiber” was a research documentary about thread, worsted cotton, silk and [[synthetic fiber]]. During 1979-1980, Derakhshandeh produced “The Wheels Whirl”. It examines economic and social depression and closed manufactures like Iran National. “Shokaran” focused on addiction. The 17-part documentary explores difficulties for women, men and children who are addicted to drugs, drug smuggling, and means of preventing drug abuse. The production lasted from 1980 to 1982.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10037">'''RUCAPS''' (Riyadh University Computer Aided Production System) was a [[computer aided design]] (CAD) system for [[architect]]s, first developed during the 1970s and 1980s, and today credited as a forerunner of [[Building Information Modelling]] (BIM). It ran on [[minicomputer]]s from [[Prime Computer]] and [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC).

==Development==
The system was initially developed by two graduates of [[Liverpool University]], Dr John Davison and John Watts in the early 1970s. They took their work to architects Gollins Melvin Ward ([[GMW Architects]]) in London in the late 1970s, and developed it whilst working on a project for [[Riyadh University]]. It became the Really Universal Computer Aided Production System (RUCAPS), and from 1977 was sold through GMW Computers Ltd in several countries worldwide.&lt;ref name=Port&gt;{{cite book|last1=Port|first1=Stanley|title=The Management of CAD for Construction|date=1989|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=9781468466058}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term 'building model' (in the sense of BIM as used today) was first used in papers in the mid-1980s: in a 1985 paper by Simon Ruffle,&lt;ref&gt;Ruffle S. (1985) "Architectural design exposed: from computer-aided-drawing to computer-aided-design" Environments and Planning B: Planning and Design 1986 March 7 pp 385-389.&lt;/ref&gt; and later in a 1986 paper by Robert Aish&lt;ref&gt;Aish, R. (1986) "Building Modelling: The Key to Integrated Construction CAD" CIB 5th International Symposium on the Use of Computers for Environmental Engineering related to Building, 7–9 July.&lt;/ref&gt; - then at GMW Computers - referring to the software's use at London's Heathrow Airport.&lt;ref&gt;cited by Laiserin, Jerry (2008), Foreword to Eastman, C., ''et al'' (2008), ''op cit'', p.xii&lt;/ref&gt;

RUCAPS was a significant milestone in the development of building modellers, selling many hundreds of copies during the early 1980s when CAD was rare and expensive, and introducing thousands of architects to computer aided design. It is regarded as a forerunner to today's BIM software,&lt;ref name=Eastman1&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eastman|first1=Chuck|last2=Tiecholz|first2=Paul|last3=Sacks|first3=Rafael|last4=Liston|first4=Kathleen |title= BIM Handbook: a Guide to Building Information Modeling for owners, managers, designers, engineers, and contractors |date=2008|publisher=John Wiley|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|isbn=9780470185285|edition=1st|pages=xi–xii}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Eastman2&gt;{{cite book |last1= Eastman |first1=Chuck |last2=Tiecholz |first2=Paul |last3=Sacks |first3=Rafael |last4=Liston |first4=Kathleen |year = 2011 |title= BIM Handbook: A Guide to Building Information Modeling for Owners, Managers, Designers, Engineers and Contractors | location = Hoboken, New Jersey|publisher=John Wiley|edition=2nd |pages=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is seen by some writers, e.g.: Jerry Laiserin, as the inspiration behind [[Autodesk]]'s [[Autodesk Revit|Revit]]:

:''While Autodesk Revit may not contain genomic snippets of Reflex code, Revit clearly is spiritual heir to a lineage of BIM "begats" — RUCAPS begat Sonata, Sonata begat Reflex, and Reflex begat Revit.''&lt;ref&gt;Laiserin, J. (2003) "[http://laiserin.com/features/issue17/feature02.php LaiserinLetterLetters]" (see Laiserin's comment to letter from John Mullan), ''The Laiserin Letter'', January 06 2003.{{unreliable source?|date=June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RUCAPS was superseded in the mid-late 1980s by [[Sonata (building design software)|Sonata]], developed by Jonathan Ingram. This was sold to T2 Solutions (renamed from GMW Computers in 1987),&lt;ref name=Port /&gt; which was eventually bought by Alias|Wavefront&lt;ref name=Day&gt;{{cite news|last1=Day|first1=Martyn|title=Intelligent Architectural Modeling|url=http://www.caddigest.com/subjects/aec/select/Intelligent_modeling_day.htm|accessdate=15 June 2015|work=AEC Magazine|date=September 2002|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419072947/http://www.caddigest.com/subjects/aec/select/Intelligent_modeling_day.htm|archivedate=19 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but then "disappeared in a mysterious, corporate black hole, somewhere in eastern Canada in 1992."&lt;ref name=Crotty&gt;{{cite book|last1=Crotty|first1=Ray|title=The Impact of Building Information Modelling: Transforming Construction|date=2012|publisher=SPON/Routledge|location=London|isbn=9781136860560|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ingram then went on to develop [[Reflex (building design software)|Reflex]], bought out by Parametric Technology Corporation ([[PTC (software company)|PTC]]) in 1996.&lt;ref name=Crotty /&gt;

===Comparison with BIM===
In 1984, RUCAPS was described as a 2½ [[dimension]]al interactive system, closer to the philosophy of 2D interactive systems such as ARK/2 or DAISY,&lt;ref name=Reynolds&gt;Reynolds, R.A. (1984) ''Computer Methods for Architects'', Butterworths, London. pp 78-79.&lt;/ref&gt; and concentrating on the rapid production of 2D drawings (plans, [[Elevation (view)|elevation]]s and sections). During the early 1980s, Ingram worked on a supplementary 3D file structure for RUCAPS, where, by running a separate program and with manual intervention, a flat 3D file could be generated, allowing the production of perspectives and images. RUCAPS did carry the 'weather vane' concept from UK-based Applied Research's Building Design System, BDS,{{efn|developed at Cambridge by Paul Richens; not to be confused with [[Charles M. Eastman|Charles Eastman]]'s Building Description System, also BDS}} now found in most modern BIM systems, but did not have interactive 3D windows or rule-based language - core characteristics of today's BIM applications.

==The system==
RUCAPS was a building modelling system. It used the concept, introduced by BDS,&lt;ref name=Reynolds/&gt; of 2½ dimensional representation of components, straddling the divide between two dimensions (2D, i.e. flat) and three (3D). Here, all the elements of the design were placed in space in three dimensions, but each element, such as a window, door, chair or wall, was modelled in a series of 2D views. These views were of the plan and two elevations, each of which were drawn conventionally, as though on the side of a glass box. The "box" was then moved about the design and placed. By looking down on the model the plan view of the whole model was visible, and from the side just the elevation was seen. Because moving the component, or "box", moved both the plan view and the elevations for it, the plans and elevations remained in harmony, and designer's time was saved.

RUCAPS consisted of 38 different programs. For example, there was a program to generate the geometry for building components, another to assemble them into groups, and another to assemble those sub-assemblies into a model of the building. A dozen or more modules took care of printing, copying of floors, printing schedules, and so on. In the way of the time, the user directed operations by calling up the relevant program module rather than, as today, selecting from a menu.

A large computer screen displayed the building model. The screen, or sometimes two screens, was controlled from a keyboard for launching programs, and typing in coordinate data. Basic components were given several 2D views, from the top and sides. The information was usually coded onto A4 sheets of paper, and typed in as a series of coordinates. Once available to use in the building module, the components would be located using a large digitizer. This permitted a base drawing to be taped down, and used for locating the new components. The screen was then used to help ensure accuracy.

Along the bottom of the digitizer was a template with commands which could be selected as required, so the keyboard was often not required. Assembly was aided for many users by the familiar look of the large digitizer, which looked much like the drawing boards common at the time. To aid the process of aclimatistion, the digitizer was used with an electronic pen, which made placing components both quick and accurate.

MIni computers were used to power the system. Initially single-user, the system soon graduated to larger computers that could handle eight or more workstations simultaneously. The nature of building modeling systems is that very little information needs to be transferred from the database to the workstation, so performance levels were good despite what looks like limited equipment. Most early display screens were monochrome, but later RUCAPS systems were colour. All were using vector graphics, which was a step up from the earlier storage tubes. Plotters were large format and pen based, using amid of roller ball pens and Rotring wet ink pens of several thicknesses and colour.

RUCAPS was expensive, as was all CAD at the time, so its use was confined to large building projects. It was then necessary to have several people working on the same model. An early multi-user system was developed, allowing single building models to be worked on simultaneously by many people. It was a system that employed layers, where components were allocated categories allowing groups of them to be switched off or on when the drawings were produced. Layering allowed, for example, drainage to be printed separately from electrical components, but still maintained on the single model. No 3D was available in RUCAPS though a totally separate 3D modelling and perspective hidden-line program called AUTOPROD written by Col. Nigel Hitch was sold alongside RUCAP. There was no database or modelling connection of any sort between RUCAPS and AUTOPROD.

No clash-detection or calculations were undertaken on the model, but some hiding of one component by another was possible so that external walls showed on elevations while the internal elements were concealed in a 2½D fashion.

'''Rosaline''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|ɒ|z|əl|ɪ|n|,_|-|iː|n}}) is an [[unseen character]] and niece of Lord Capulet in [[William Shakespeare]]'s [[tragedy]] ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' (1597). Although silent, her role is important. [[Romeo Montague|Romeo]] is at first deeply in love with Rosaline and expresses his dismay at her not loving him back. Romeo first spots [[Juliet Capulet|Juliet]] while trying to catch a glimpse of Rosaline at a gathering hosted by the Capulet family.

Scholars generally compare Romeo's short-lived love of Rosaline with his later love of Juliet. The poetry Shakespeare writes for Rosaline is much weaker than that for Juliet. Scholars believe Romeo's early experience with Rosaline prepares him for his relationship with Juliet. Later performances of ''Romeo and Juliet'' have painted different pictures of Romeo and Rosaline's relationship, as filmmakers have experimented with making Rosaline a more visible character.

== Role in the play ==
Before [[Romeo Montague|Romeo]] meets [[Juliet Capulet|Juliet]], he loves Rosaline, Capulet's niece and Juliet's cousin. He describes her as wonderfully beautiful: "The all-seeing sun / ne'er saw her match since first the world begun."&lt;ref&gt;''Romeo and Juliet'', I.2.99–100.&lt;/ref&gt; Rosaline, however, chooses to remain [[chastity|chaste]]; Romeo says: "She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow / Do I live dead that live to tell it now."&lt;ref&gt;''Romeo and Juliet'', I.1.231–232.&lt;/ref&gt; This is the source of his depression, and he makes his friends unhappy; [[Mercutio]] comments: "That same pale, hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline, torments him so that he will sure run mad."&lt;ref&gt;''Romeo and Juliet'', II.4.4–5.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benvolio]] urges Romeo to sneak into a Capulet gathering where, he claims, Rosaline will look like "a crow" alongside the other beautiful women.&lt;ref&gt;''Romeo and Juliet'', I.2.365.&lt;/ref&gt; Romeo agrees, but doubts Benvolio's assessment. After Romeo sees Juliet his feelings suddenly change: "Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight / For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night."&lt;ref&gt;''Romeo and Juliet'', I.5.59–60.&lt;/ref&gt; Because their relationship is sudden and secret, Romeo's friends and [[Friar Laurence]] continue to speak of his affection for Rosaline throughout much of the play.

==Analysis==

"The Sonnet's Body and the Body Sonnetized in 'Romeo and Juliet'." ''Shakespeare Quarterly'' 40.1 (Apr 1989): 27–41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Alan. "Reading Shakespeare's Cupid." ''Criticism'' 47.2 (Apr 2005): 177–213.&lt;/ref&gt; The name Rosaline commonly appears in [[Sonnets|Petrarchan sonnets]], a form of poetry Romeo uses to woo Juliet and to describe both Rosaline and Juliet.  Since Rosaline is unattainable, she is a perfect subject for this style; but Romeo's attempt at it is forced and weak.  By the time he meets Juliet his poetic ability has improved considerably.&lt;ref name = Gayle/&gt;

[[Gender studies|Gender studies critics]] have argued that Rosaline's name suggests that Romeo never really forgets her but rather replaces her with Juliet.  Thus, when Juliet cries "What's in a name? A rose by any other name would smell as sweet," she is ironically expressing Romeo's own view of her as a substitute for Rosaline.  That is to say, Rosaline, replaced in name only by Juliet, is just as sweet to Romeo.&lt;ref name = queer/&gt; Gender critics also note that the arguments used to dissuade Romeo from pursuing Rosaline are similar to the themes of Shakespeare's [[procreation sonnets]]. In these sonnets Shakespeare urges the man (who can be equated with Romeo) to find a woman with whom to procreate—a duty he owes to society.  Rosaline, it seems, is distant and unavailable except in the mind, similarly bringing no hope of offspring.  As Benvolio argues, she is best replaced by someone who will reciprocate.  Rosaline reveals similarities to the subject of the sonnets when she refuses to break her vow of chastity.  Her name may be referred to in the [[Sonnet 1|first sonnet]] when the young man is described as "beauties Rose." This line ties the young man to both Rosaline and Romeo in Juliet's "What's in a name?" soliloquy.  When Juliet says "...that which we call a rose / By any other name would smell as sweet",&lt;ref&gt;Act 2 Scene 2&lt;/ref&gt; she may be raising the question of whether there is any difference between the beauty of a man and the beauty of a woman.&lt;ref name = queer/&gt;

Rosaline is used as a name for only one other Shakespearean character—the one of the main female figures in ''[[Love's Labours Lost]]'' (1598), although Rosalin''d'' is the name of the main female character in ''[[As You Like It]]''.  Scholars have found similarities between them: both are described as beautiful, and both have a way of avoiding men's romantic advances. Rosaline in ''Love's Labours Lost'' constantly rebuffs her suitor's advances and Romeo's Rosaline remains distant and chaste in his brief descriptions of her.  These similarities have led some to wonder whether they are based on a woman Shakespeare actually knew, possibly the [[Shakespeare's sonnets#The Dark Lady|Dark Lady]] described in his sonnets, but there is no strong evidence of this connection.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, Charles and Mary Clarke. ''The Shakespeare Key''. City: Kessinger Publishing, LLC (2007), 651–652. {{ISBN|1-4304-6745-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rosaline as plot device===
Analysts note that Rosaline acts as a plot device, by motivating Romeo to sneak into the Capulet party where he will meet Juliet. Without her, their meeting would be unlikely.&lt;ref name = ros&gt;Gray, Henry David. "Romeo Rosaline, and Juliet". ''Modern Language Notes'' 29.7 (Nov 1914): 209–212.&lt;/ref&gt; Rosaline thus acts as the impetus to bring the "star-cross'd lovers" to their deaths—she is crucial in shaping their fate (a common theme of the play).  Ironically, she remains oblivious of her role.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Bertrand. "The Brevity of Friar Lawrence." ''PMLA'' 65.5 (September 1950): 841–865.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rosaline and Juliet===
{{quote box|width=23em|"Rosaline and Paris...are the subtlest reflectors of all...they are cast like a snake's skin by the more robust reality of Romeo and Juliet."|—Ruth Nevo, on the Rosaline-Juliet, Paris-Romeo comparison&lt;ref&gt;Nevo, Ruth. "Tragic Form in Romeo and Juliet". ''Elizabethan and Jacobean Drama''. ''Studies in English Literature, 1500–1900''  9.2 (April 1969): 241–258.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Literary critics often compare Romeo's love for Rosaline with his feelings for Juliet.  Some see Romeo's supposed love for Rosaline as childish as compared with his true love for Juliet.  Others argue that the apparent difference in Romeo's feelings shows Shakespeare's improving skill.  Since Shakespeare is thought to have written early drafts of the play in 1591, and then picked them up again in 1597 to create the final copy, the change in Romeo's language for Rosaline and Juliet may mirror Shakespeare's increased skill as a playwright: the younger Shakespeare describing Rosaline, and the more experienced describing Juliet.  In this view, a careful look at the play reveals that Romeo's love for Rosaline is not as petty as usually imagined.&lt;ref name = ros/&gt;

Critics also note the ways in which Romeo's relationship with Rosaline prepares him for meeting Juliet.  Before meeting Rosaline, Romeo despises all Capulets, but afterwards looks upon them more favourably.  He experiences the dual feelings of hate and love in the one relationship.  This prepares him for the more mature relationship with Juliet—one fraught by the feud between Montagues and Capulets. Romeo expresses the conflict of love and hate in Act 1, Scene 1, comparing his love for Rosaline with the feud between the two houses:&lt;ref&gt;Bowling, Lawrence Edward. "The Thematic Framework of Romeo and Juliet." ''PMLA'' 64.1 (Mar 1949): 208–220.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.&lt;br&gt;
Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!&lt;br&gt;
O any thing, of nothing first create!&lt;br&gt;
O heavy lightness! serious vanity!&lt;br&gt;
Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!&lt;br&gt;
Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!&lt;br&gt;
Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!&lt;br&gt;
This love feel I, that feel no love in this.&lt;br&gt;
Dost thou not laugh?}}

[[Psychoanalytic criticism|Psychoanalytic critics]] see signs of repressed [[childhood trauma]] in Romeo's love for Rosaline. She is of a rival house and is sworn to chastity.  Thus he is in an impossible situation, one which will continue his trauma if he remains in it.  
Although he acknowledges its ridiculous nature, he refuses to stop loving her.  Psychoanalysts view this as a re-enactment of his failed relationship with his mother.  Rosaline's absence is symbolic of his mother's absence and lack of affection for him.  Romeo's love for Juliet is similarly hopeless, for she is a Capulet and Romeo pursues his relationship with her; the difference being that Juliet reciprocates.&lt;ref&gt;Krims, Marvin, "Romeo's Childhood Trauma?--'What Fray Was Here?'." ''PSYART: A Hyperlink Journal for Psychological Study of the Arts''. (November 1999) 3 article no. 991022. Reprinted in Shakespearean Criticism, Vol. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; This does not seem likely seeing as his mother died of grief after his banishment, indicating that she probably loved him deeply.

==Performances==
Rosaline has been portrayed in various ways over the centuries. [[Theophilus Cibber]]'s 1748 version of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' replaced references to Rosaline with references to Juliet. This, according to critics, took out the "love at first sight" moment at the Capulet feast.&lt;ref&gt;Marsden, Jean. ''The Re-Imagined Text''. Lexington: University Press of Kentucky, (1995), 87–88. {{ISBN|0-8131-1901-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1750s, actor and theatre director [[David Garrick]] also eliminated references to Rosaline from his performances, as many saw Romeo's quick replacement of her as immoral.&lt;ref&gt;Branam, George C. "The Genesis of David Garrick's Romeo and Juliet." ''[[Shakespeare Quarterly]]'' 35.2 (July 1984): 170–179.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stone, George Winchester, Jr. "Romeo and Juliet: The Source of its Modern Stage Career." ''Shakespeare Quarterly'' 15.2 (April 1964): 191–206.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in [[Franco Zeffirelli]]'s 1968 film version of ''[[Romeo and Juliet (1968 film)|Romeo and Juliet]]'', Romeo sees Rosaline (played by [[Paola Tedesco]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Romeo &amp; Juliet (1968)| work =Yahoo! Movies| publisher =Yahoo!| year =2007| url =https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1800341348/cast| accessdate =28 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; first at the Capulet feast and then Juliet, of whom he becomes immediately enamoured.  This scene suggests that love is short and superficial.  Rosaline also appears in Renato Castellani's 1954 film version.  In a brief non-Shakespearean scene, Rosaline (Dagmar Josipovitch) gives Romeo a mask at Capulet's celebration, and urges him to leave disguised before harm comes to him.  Other filmmakers keep Rosaline off-camera in stricter accordance with Shakespeare's script.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Jennifer L. "Tights vs. Tattoos: Filmic Interpretations of 'Romeo and Juliet'." ''The English Journal'' 92.1 (Sep 2002): 41–46.&lt;/ref&gt;  Rosaline also appears in the 2013 film adaptation of Romeo &amp; Juliet.

Robert Nathan's 1966 romantic comedy, ''Juliet in Mantua'', presents Rosaline as a fully developed character.  In this sequel, in which Romeo and Juliet did ''not'' die, the pair live ten years later in exile in Mantua.  After they are forgiven and return to Verona, they learn that Rosaline is now married to County Paris, and both couples must confront their disillusionment with their marriages.  Another play, ''[[After Juliet]]'', written by Scottish playwright [[Sharman Macdonald]], tells the story of Rosaline after Romeo dies. A main character in this play, she struggles with her loss and turns away the advances of [[Benvolio]], who has fallen in love with her. Macdonald's daughter, [[Keira Knightley]], played Rosaline in the play's 1999 premiere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Maxwell|first=Tom|title=Keira's helpful prompt| work =The Scotsman| date =20 July 2007| url =http://living.scotsman.com/performing.cfm?id=1135292007 |accessdate=27 May 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071201070555/http://living.scotsman.com/performing.cfm?id=1135292007 |archivedate = 1 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =After Juliet by Sharman McDonald| work =Plays| publisher =Acquis|url=http://www.acquis.org.uk/play_uk/macdonald_uk.html |accessdate=27 May 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928011634/http://www.acquis.org.uk/play_uk/macdonald_uk.html |archivedate = 28 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2012 young adult novel "When You Were Mine" by Rebecca Serle sets Rosaline's story in a contemporary high school.

[[Still Star-Crossed]] (2017) –  period drama television series created by Heather Mitchell and based on the book with same name by [[Melinda Taub]]. It follows Rosaline (played by Lashana Lynch). She and Benvolio of Montague are betrothed against their will by Prince Escalus, to end the feud between the two families. Both resolve to find a way to end the violence without having the union.

'''''Saint Jerome and the Angel of Judgement''''' is an oil on canvas painting by [[Jusepe de Ribera]], signed and dated by the artist in 1626. It was produced as a display for a side chapel next to the high altar of the church of [[Santissima Trinità delle Monache]], which also housed Ribera's ''Earthly Trinity''&lt;ref name=T232/&gt;. The religious order running the building was suppressed in 1813 and the canvas instead entered the Bourbon Collection and the [[National Museum of Capodimonte]] in Naples - it still hangs in the latter.&lt;ref name=T232&gt;AA.VV., ''Museo di Capodimonte'', Milano, Touring Club Editore, 2012, pag. 232. {{ISBN|978-88-365-2577-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=T232/&gt;

It is typical of Neapolitan [[Caravaggism]]. The figure of an angel blowing a trumpet draws on the angel in [[Caravaggio]]'s own ''[[Saint Matthew and the Angel]]''. The work shows [[Saint Jerome]] producing the [[Vulgate Bible]], shown as a scroll on the floor in front of him. Behind Jerome is his typical attribute of a lion, whilst to his right are a skull and a book, both also attributes of the saint.

The '''''Ascension of Christ''''' (also known as '''''Sansepolcro Altarpiece'''''; Italian: ''Pala di Sansepolcro'') is a painting by Italian Renaissance master [[Perugino]], dating from around 1510. It is housed in the [[Cathedral of Sansepolcro]], [[Tuscany]], central [[Italy]].

==Description==
The works adopts the same composition in the central panel of Perugino's ''[[San Pietro Polyptych]]''. However, due to the greater sizes, he enhanced some decorative details, such as the ribbons held by the angels. The work also saw a massive collaboration of the artist's workshop.

Christ is portrayed within an almond hovering at the top center of the panel, surrounded by flying or playing angels, while the frame has heads of cherubims  and seraphims. The lower group includes Mary and the Apostles, with an [[Umbria]]n landscape in the background, characterized by slender trees.

'''The Art and Olfaction Awards''' are a non-profit award mechanism designed to celebrate excellence in international artisan, experimental and independent [[perfume]]ry and [[olfactory art]] through a yearly blind-judged competition.

== Mission ==

The organization states the following as its mission:

"''Awarded to just four perfumes and one experimental project a year, The Art and Olfaction Award is designed to raise interest and awareness for independent and artisan perfumers - and experimental practitioners with scent - from all countries. By shining a spotlight on perfumery’s most outstanding creators, we hope to help generate support for independent practices in perfumery as a whole. The Art and Olfaction Awards are a program of [[The Institute for Art and Olfaction,]] a 501(c)3 non-profit organization based in Los Angeles, USA.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.artandolfactionawards.org/about-2/|title=About|date=2013-10-26|newspaper=The Art and Olfaction Awards|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The Art and Olfaction Awards were founded in 2013 as a program of [[The Institute for Art and Olfaction]] in Los Angeles. The first awards ceremony took place in April, 2014, at [[Goethe-Institut|Goethe Institut]] Los Angeles. At this first event, awards were given in two categories: Independent and Artisan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.perfumerflavorist.com/networking/news/company/Niche-Perfumers-Nab-Prizes-at-Art-and-Olfaction-Awards-257943561.html|title=Niche Perfumers Nab Prizes at Art and Olfaction Awards|newspaper=Skin Inc.|access-date=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the awards expanded upon their existing categories by adding The Sadakichi Award for Experimental Work with Scent - named after the critic and writer [[Sadakichi Hartmann]] in honor of his failed scent concert from the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/art-and-olfaction-awards-what-did-qaddafi-death-smell-like|title=What Did Qaddafi’s Death Smell Like?|date=2015-04-23|website=The New Yorker|access-date=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sadakichi Award was added as "a new category aimed at recognizing innovative uses of scent beyond the bounds of commercial perfumery"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.basenotes.net/features//3133-report-from-the-second-annual-art-and-olfaction-awards|title=Report from the second annual Art &amp; Olfaction Awards ~ by Deadidol — Basenotes.net|website=www.basenotes.net|access-date=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; - joining the artisan and independent awards to create what was intended as a broad snapshot of the diversity and creative potential in the field of perfume.

The third annual Art and Olfaction Awards were held on May 6, 2016 at [[Hammer Museum]] as part of their [https://hammer.ucla.edu/programs-events/2016/05/third-annual-art-and-olfaction-awards-with-emcee-zackary-drucker/ public programming]. The expanded event was hosted by artist and producer [[Zackary Drucker]], and was free, open to the public, and live streamed on the internet. In an effort to better cement the award's international commitment, the fourth annual Art and Olfaction Awards take place in May 2017 at [https://www.silent-green.net/ Silent Green kulturquartier] in [[Berlin]]. The finalists are announced yearly at [http://www.esxence.com/ Esxence] in Milan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.fragrantica.com/news/2016-Art-and-Olfaction-Awards-Finalists-Announced-at-Esxence-7780.html|title=2016 Art and Olfaction Awards Finalists Announced at Esxence ~ Art Books Events ~ Fragrantica|access-date=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Art and Olfaction Awards were created as mechanism to impartially judge and promote work being done by artisan perfumers, independent perfume houses, and creative practitioners working with scent in the context of arts or experimental practices. Limited to artists, [[artisan]] perfumers and independent perfume houses (which they define as brands that are independently owned, or owned by another independently-owned company&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.artandolfactionawards.org/submission/independent-award/|title=Independent Award|date=2014-09-17|newspaper=The Art and Olfaction Awards|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;), they are closed to larger-scale perfume releases - a space already served by [[The Fragrance Foundation]]'s [http://www.fragrance.org/fragrance-awards/ Awards].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.fragrantica.com/news/The-ART-and-OLFACTION-AWARDS-5020.html|title=The Art and Olfaction Awards ~ Art Books Events ~ Fragrantica|access-date=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that capacity they have been compared&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mary-orlin/art-and-olfaction-awards_b_6248560.html|title=Art and Olfaction Awards Celebrates Artisan Perfumers {{!}} Huffington Post|last=WineFashionista|first=Mary Orlin The|date=2014-12-01|website=The Huffington Post|access-date=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the film industry's [[Independent Spirit Awards]]. Indeed, the awards were created based on founder Saskia Wilson-Brown's experience with film festivals:

"''The awards represented a chance to apply what I learned in the film festival world to the perfume world. In fact, we adapted many of the structures that go into running a film festival for the Art and Olfaction Awards, namely: Low entry fees, [...] unbiased judging (in many film festivals you are excluded from judging a film that you have a personal tie to), a diversity of judges, and a non-profit art for arts-sake motivation.”''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cafleurebon.com/inside-the-institute-for-art-and-olfaction-awards-an-interview-with-saskia-wilson-brown-perfume-without-politics/|title=Saskia-Wilson Brown {{!}} Cafleurebon - Perfume and Beauty Blog|website=www.cafleurebon.com|access-date=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several further systems were put into place to ensure fairness, including blind, multiple-phase judging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://colognoisseur.com/tag/2016-art-and-olfaction-awards/|title=2016 art and olfaction awards {{!}} Colognoisseur|website=colognoisseur.com|access-date=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result was what Luca Turin called '[...]the only fluff-free fragrance contest in the world&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://arabia.style.com/beauty/beauty-guide/best-spring-summer-2015-perfumes-moschino-toy-tom-ford-noir-extreme-skive-canoe-goods-luca-turin-review/2/|title=Luca Turin Reviews Moschino Toy and Tom Ford Noir Extreme {{!}} Style.com/Arabia|date=2015-04-20|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;'.

'''''The Dance of the Villagers''''' is a 1635 painting by [[Peter Paul Rubens]]. now in the [[Prado Museum]] in Madrid. It is closely related to ''[[The Village Fête (Rubens)|The Village Fête]]'', of a similar date and on a similar subject. 

After Rubens' death, [[Philip IV of Spain]] sent his ambassador to buy paintings from the artist's estate - he bought this one for 800 florins and the king hang it in his summer dining room in the old [[Royal Alcázar of Madrid]]. It is now in the [[Prado Museum]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2624">'''Transitions''' in [[fiction]] are words, phrases, sentences, paragraphs, or [[punctuation]] that may be used to signal various changes in a story, including changes in time, location, [[narrative mode|point-of-view character]], [[Mood (psychology)|mood]], [[tone (literature)|tone]], [[emotion]], and [[pace (speed)|pace]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Morrell|Morrell]], 2006, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=qhufPkfjmXgC&amp;pg=PA281-2 281-2].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Polking|Polking]], 1990, p. 495.&lt;/ref&gt; Transitions are sometimes listed as one of various [[fiction-writing modes]].

==Purpose==
Transitions provide for a seamless [[narrative]] flow as a story shifts in time, location, or [[Point of view (fiction) | point-of view]].  They aid the internal logic of a story by moving readers from sentence to sentence, paragraph to paragraph, idea to idea, [[scene (drama)|scene]] to scene, and [[Chapter (books)|chapter]] to chapter with grace and ease.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Morrell|Morrell]], 2006, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=qhufPkfjmXgC&amp;pg=PA281-2 281-2].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Transitions in fiction may take any of several forms, including [[Chapter (books)|chapter]] breaks, [[section break]]s, and [[:wikt:summarization|summarization]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rosenfeld|Rosenfeld]], 2008, p. 258-265.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Marshall|Marshall]], 1998, p.

[[File:VisionsBeforeMidnight.jpg|thumb|First edition (publ. [[Jonathan Cape]])]]

'''''Visions Before Midnight''''' is a selection of the television criticism written by [[Clive James]] during his first four years (1972–1976) as ''[[The Observer]]'''s weekly television critic. The selection begins with a piece on the [[1972 Summer Olympics]] in Munich, and ends with a piece on the [[1976 Summer Olympics]] in Montreal. It was first published in 1977. The title derives from [[Sir Thomas Browne]]: ''Dreams out of the ivory gate, and visions before midnight.''

Before being contracted by ''Observer'' editor [[David Astor]], James had previously written one piece per month on television for ''[[The Listener (magazine)|The Listener]]'' and its editor, [[Karl Miller]], had been an important influence on James. He had allowed him to, "write a column which eschewed solemnity so thoroughly that it courted the frivolous. Like [[Georg Christoph Lichtenberg|Lichtenberg]] Karl Miller appreciated the kind of joke that unveils a problem: if your gags had a serious reason for being there, they stayed in." James explains in the preface: "Television was a natural part of my life. I loved watching it and I loved being on it. The second passion has since somewhat faded, but the first remains strong, and was very powerful at the time. I watched just about everything, including the junk. The screen teemed with unsummable activity. It was full of  visions, legends, myths, fables. T.V was scarcely something you could feel superior to. It was too various. What I had to offer was negative capability, a capability for submission to the medium. I was the first to submit myself to [[Alastair Burnet]] and find him fascinating. No critic before me had ever regarded [[David Vine]] as a reason for switching the set ''on''."

In the preface James says that the idea of publishing a selection of his television criticism had been in his mind since speaking with [[Kenneth Tynan]] at a reception at the [[Garrick Club]]. Tynan had said he hoped James would publish some of his criticism but averred that, "A television critic would have to know everything, and who knows everything?" James had been lost for an answer at the time but in the Preface replies, "It isn't necessary to know everything – just to remember that nobody else does either."

"'''Wild World'''" is a song written and recorded by English [[singer-songwriter]] [[Cat Stevens]]. It first appeared on his fourth album, ''[[Tea for the Tillerman]]'', recorded and released in 1970.

== Song meaning==
Stevens developed a relationship with actress [[Patti D'Arbanville]] and the two were a pair throughout a period of two years or so. During that time, he wrote several songs about her, including the song "Wild World." The song has struck many critics as being protective and caring{{Failed verification|date=January 2016}}; the  artist's expression of love includes words like "Because I never want to see you sad girl, don't be a bad girl".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/blurred-lines-the-worst-song-of-this-or-any-other-year-20131206|title=Rob Sheffield's Worst Song of 2013: 'Blurred Lines'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song is in the form of the singer's words to his departing lover, inspired by the end of their romance. Stevens later recalled to ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'': "It was one of those chord sequences that's very common in Spanish music. I turned it around and came up with that theme—which is a recurring theme in my work—which is to do with leaving, the sadness of leaving, and the anticipation of what lies beyond."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=291|title=Wild World by Cat Stevens Songfacts|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Released as a single in late 1970, it peaked at No. 11 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart.&lt;ref name="Yusuf Islam Lifeline 1970"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yusufislam.com/lifeline/10/a45dd1dc1476115ceb7fa21a45cbcd0f/|title=Yusuf Islam Lifeline 1970|last=Islam|first=Yusuf|year=2008|publisher=Yusuf Islam Official Website |accessdate=2008-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Wild World" has been credited as the song that gave Stevens' next album, ''[[Tea for the Tillerman]]'', "enough kick" to get it played on [[FM radio]]; and Island Records' [[Chris Blackwell]] has been quoted as calling it "the best album we've ever released" to that date.&lt;ref name="Scoppa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://majicat.com/articles/rock71.htm|title=Easy Does It|last=Scoppa|first=Bud|date=May 24, 1971 |publisher=Rock Magazine |accessdate=2008-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2008, the ''Tea for the Tillerman'' CD was re-issued in a deluxe version which included the original demo of "Wild World".

==Cover versions==
The song has been covered by many artists, with many of the [[cover version|covers]] becoming hits of their own. [[Jimmy Cliff]]'s version, released a few months after Stevens released the original version, reached number eight on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. Surprisingly, Stevens' version was not released as a single in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. Some of the subsequent covers have also been in the [[reggae]] style, indicating that they may be covers of Cliff's version, as opposed to direct covers of Cat Stevens' original arrangement. An example of this would be [[Maxi Priest]]'s version of the song. Recorded and released as a single in 1988, this version also did well on the charts, reaching number five on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and No. 25 on the [[United States|US]] ''Billboard'' Hot 100. 

In 1987, [[Jonathan King]] accused [[Pet Shop Boys]] of plagiarising the melody of "Wild World" for their UK No. 1 single "[[It's a Sin]]". He made the claims in ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', for which he wrote a regular column during the 1980s. King also released his own cover version of "Wild World" as a single, using a similar musical arrangement to "It's a Sin", in an effort to demonstrate his claims. This single flopped, while Pet Shop Boys sued King, eventually winning out-of-court damages, which they donated to charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Independent|title=Editor-At-Large: He lured boys.

On July 7, 2007, the song was performed twice at the [[Live Earth]] concerts. [[James Blunt]] sang it at [[Wembley Stadium]] in London, England, while [[Yusuf Islam]] (formerly Cat Stevens) himself sang it in [[Hamburg, Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Rolling Stone|title=James Blunt covers Cat Stevens at Live Earth|date=7 July 2007|url=http://www.nme.com/news/music/live-earth-14-1343829}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=NME|title=International Report: Live Earth Hamburg|date=7 July 2007|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/international-report-live-earth-hamburg-20070707}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993 American rock band [[Mr. Big (band)|Mr. Big]] released a [[pop rock]] [[ballad]] cover of "'''Wild World'''" on their third album [[Bump Ahead]]. The single charted at No. 27 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], No. 33 on the [[Top 40 Mainstream]] and No. 12 on the [[Mainstream Top 40]]. In Europe it was very successful, peaking at No. 4 in Denmark, No. 7 in Austria &amp; Switzerland, at No. 10 in Norway, Sweden &amp; Netherlands and No. 13 in Iceland.

===Critical reception===
The ''[[Gavin Report]]'' wrote about the song: "How many ways can a song be interpreted? In the case of Cat Stevens' 1971 smash there are at least three: The Catman's original, Maxi Priest, who gave it a reggae spin, and now Mr. Big's soulful, sensitive approach with a slight rock edge. Lead singer Eric Martin is powerful without overpowering the song."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first= Dave |last= Sholin |title= Singles |magazine= [[Gavin Report]] |accessdate= 2018-04-15 |page=|url= http://americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Gavin-Report/90/93/Gavin-1993-09-10.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music video===
The music video for "Wild World" was directed by Nancy Bennett.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://imvdb.com/video/mr.-big-1/wild-world|title=Wild World (1993) by Mr. Big|publisher=IMVDb.com|accessdate=2018-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bookman; a Review of Books and Life (1895-1933); July 1921; 53, 5; American Periodicals. pg. 428&lt;/ref&gt; This organization includes twelve active chapters in the United States, network members outside regional chapters, and corporate sponsorships.&lt;ref name="wnba-books.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wnba-books.org|title=WNBA|work=Women's National Book Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; WNBA is a broad-based, non-profit,&lt;ref&gt;US publishing 2008. (2008). London: Snapshots International Ltd. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/214295670&lt;/ref&gt; 501(c)(3) organization offering three distinguished national awards and a longstanding history of literary activism.&lt;ref name="wnba-books.org1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wnba-books.org/about-wnba|title=About WNBA|work=Women's National Book Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The organization started in 1917,&lt;ref name=walker/&gt; when women in the book industry were excluded from joining the professional organization, the Bookseller's League.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;The Woman Citizen: A Weekly Chronicle of Progress. Published by The Woman's Journal. Woman and the Stream of Thought. December 6, 1919, vol. IV, no. 20, page 545&lt;/ref&gt; Fifteen women met at Sherwood's Book Store in [[Lower Manhattan]] on November 13, 1917, and founded the Women's National Book Association as an organization to support and give voice to women in the book industry. The first President was Pauline Sherwood, of Sherwood's Book Store.&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous, Women in business, Woman's journal., 3/3 (1918), 53&lt;/ref&gt;

The early organization's unique characteristic was that membership was open to women in all facets of the book world-publishers, booksellers, librarians, authors, illustrators, agents, production people - the only criterion being that part of their income must come from books.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Almost 100 years later, with ten chapters spanning the country from Boston to San Francisco and with Network members across the country, the Women's National Book Association continues its mission to champion the role of women in the world of words, with women and men who are professionals in the publishing industry, who are authors, or are advocates of literature as members.&lt;ref name="wnba-books.org"/&gt; The organization's newsletter, ''The Bookwoman'', was created in 1936 by [[Constance Lindsay Skinner]] and has had continuous publication to the current date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wnba-books.org/bookwoman|title=Bookwoman|work=Women's National Book Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;
