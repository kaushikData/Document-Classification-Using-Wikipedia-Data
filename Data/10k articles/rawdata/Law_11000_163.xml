The '''1966 Sarawak constitutional crisis''' took place in the state of [[Sarawak]], Malaysia from 1965 to 1966. This crisis was started by a group of politicians who were dissatisfied towards [[Stephen Kalong Ningkan]]'s leadership as chief minister. Ningkan was later removed from the chief minister post by  the [[List of Yang di-Pertua Negeri of Sarawak|Governor of Sarawak]] in June 1966. However, Ningkan was reinstated by the High Court in early September 1966. He was ousted from the chief minister office for the final time at the end of September 1966 and was replaced by [[Tawi Sli]] as the new chief minister. It was widely believed that the ouster of Ningkan was a result of interference by the [[Malaysian federal government]] due to him being a strong advocate of greater state autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.malaysianbar.org.my/echoes_of_the_past/weakened_federalism_in_the_new_federation.html|title=Weakened federalism in the new federation|date=25 July 2007|work=The Sun (Malaysia)|accessdate=29 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boon Kheng Cheah|first=|title=Malaysia: The Making of a Nation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NOtXcEmHdjoC&amp;pg=PA60&amp;lpg=PA60&amp;dq=kalong+campaigning+state+right&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SdTt5k7Myx&amp;sig=6vSpHwxps1_AWWEMTo6b1CXIfH8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=_Dy6TdHmMoW8rAfo-pli&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2002|page=60|publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
On 22 July 1963, [[Stephen Kalong Ningkan]] was appointed as the first chief minister of Sarawak following his landslide winnings of the 1963 local council elections.&lt;ref name=humptydumpty&gt;Reddy O.C (2011).

Retrieved 3 February 2015.{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, Ningkan tried to initiate a land reform law that would allow the natives to acquire full title to Native Customary land. Therefore, the natives would be able to sell their land to anyone including the Chinese. Such a law would also allow the natives to acquire large tracts of forest land.&lt;ref name=TheEdge&gt;{{cite news |title=Background: Constitutional Crises |url=https://archive.org/download/BackgroundConstitutionalCrisesTheEdgeMalaysia/%27Background_%20Constitutional%20Crises%27%20-%20The%20Edge%20%28Malaysia%29.pdf|date=3 February 2009 |last= |first= |publisher=[[The Edge (Malaysia)]] |accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ningkan's action angered the leaders in Barisan Rakyat Jati Sarawak (BARJASA) party. Subsequently, Sarawak Native Alliance consisting of Parti Negara Sarawak (PANAS), BARJASA party, and Parti Pesaka Sarawak (PESAKA) was formed in order to challenge Ningkan's leadership.&lt;ref name=Syam&gt;Syam, M.F (2012).

==The political crisis==
On 16 June 1966, 21 out of 42 members of the [[Sarawak State Legislative Assembly|state legislature]] declared that they did not have confidence in [[Stephen Kalong Ningkan]].&lt;ref name="bpost"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theborneopost.com/?p=26472|title=The saga of Stephen Kalong Ningkan – the conclusion|date=26 April 2010|work=The Borneo Post|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 21 assemblymen wrote a petition to the [[List of Yang di-Pertua Negeri of Sarawak|Governor of Sarawak]] stating that they have lost confidence in the chief minister. The prime minister of Malaysia, [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]] also advocated the petition and asked Ningkan to resign.&lt;ref name=Syam/&gt;

On the same day, the Governor, [[Abang Haji Openg]], at the insistence of the federal government in Kuala Lumpur,&lt;ref name="vendetta"&gt;{{cite book|last=Shaari Isa|first=|title=Vendetta and Abuse of Power|url=http://www.mphonline.com/books/nsearchdetails.aspx?&amp;pcode=9789674151492 |year=2014|publisher=MPH Publishing|page=62|isbn=9789674151508}}&lt;/ref&gt; requested Ningkan to resign from the post. However, Ningkan refused to resign from the cabinet. Ningkan argued that the letter has not been supported by a formal motion of no confidence against him at the Council Negri (now [[Sarawak State Legislative Assembly]]). He also demanded the names of all the 21 Council Negri members who signed the petition.&lt;ref name="bpost"/&gt; Ningkan also claimed that he still commanded a majority of the state assembly members and challenged his dissidents into a formal debate of motion of no confidence in the Council Negeri.&lt;ref name=Syam/&gt; Since Ningkan refused to resign, the governor then declared that Ningkan has ceased to hold office and appointed [[Tawi Sli]] as the new chief minister. The Governor also forwarded the names who had signed the petition to Ningkan.&lt;ref name="bpost"/&gt;

==Judicial intervention in the political dispute==
Following the ouster, Ningkan decided bring the case into Kuching High Court and named the Governor as the first defendant and Tawi Sli as the second defendant.&lt;ref name="bpost" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants= Stephen Kalong Ningkan v. Tun Abang Haji Openg and Tawi Sli |reporter= 2 MLJ 187|opinion= |pinpoint= |court= |date= 1966 |url= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 September 1966, Chief Justice of Borneo, Justice Harley, delivered a verdict that reinstated Ningkan back to his chief minister post. According to Section 21 of the Interpretation Ordinance of the Sarawak state constitution, only the Council Negri has the power to appoint or dismiss a chief minister. The Governor does not have the power to dismiss a chief minister. However, chief minister can only be dismissed if he had lost the confidence of Council Negri or he refused to resign from the chief minister post but he also failed to advise a dissolution of the Council Negri.&lt;ref name="bpost"/&gt;

==The removal of Ningkan==
Following the court's decision, Ningkan tried to initiate a dissolution of Council Negri so that he could seek a fresh mandate from the voters.&lt;ref name=TheEdge/&gt; However, in September 1966, the federal government declared a [[state of emergency]] in Sarawak,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sarawak crisis brings state of emergency|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1301&amp;dat=19660916&amp;id=6_xjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=CucDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=937,4324030&amp;hl=en|accessdate=26 September 2015|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=16 September 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; citing chaos in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Imtiaz Omar|first=|title=Rights, Emergencies and Judicial Review|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v_PIX6WBZgcC&amp;lpg=PA135&amp;ots=jXj9UBsRMC&amp;dq=sarawak%20emergency%20ningkan%20declared&amp;pg=PA135#v=onepage&amp;q=sarawak%20emergency%20ningkan%20declared&amp;f=false|year=1996|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the Emergency (Federal Constitution and the Constitution of Sarawak) Act, an amendment was made to Article 150 of the Sarawak constitution.

==Aftermath==
Ningkan decided to bring the case to [[Federal Court of Malaysia]] after his second ouster. Ningkan also tried to seek legal advice from the British government about Britain's role in setting the conditions of Sarawak entering Malaysia and the signing of the London's agreement on behalf of Sarawak.&lt;ref name=Sarawakcrisis/&gt; Ningkan also argued that the Sarawak constitutional amendment was illegal because the state of emergency was declared under unusual circumstances. There was no riots or disturbances taking place in Sarawak. Furthermore, [[Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation]] was already over in August 1966. However, the federal court held that the word "emergency" has a broad meaning and it would also include the Sarawak constitutional crisis because such a crisis would cause a breakdown in the Sarawak state government and harm the political stability in Sarawak. Therefore, such declaration of emergency in Sarawak is legal.&lt;ref name=humptydumpty/&gt; On 1 August 1968, [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] dismissed Ningkan's appeal. [[John MacDermott, Baron MacDermott|MacDermott]] stated that, "their Lordships could not find any reason for saying that the emergency was not grave and did not threaten the security of Sarawak."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Porritt|first1=Vernon L|title=Constitutional change in sarawak 1963-1988: 25 years as a state within the federation of Malaysia.|journal=Borneo Research Bulletin|date=1 January 2007|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Constitutional+change+in+sarawak+1963-1988%3A+25+years+as+a+state...-a0179660415|accessdate=2 November 2015|quote=Ningkan's petition against his unconstitutional dismissal progressed slowly though the courts for another two years, finally ending on 1 August 1968 when he was advised that the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council had dismissed his appeal. Commenting on the controversial declaration of a state of emergency, Lord [[John MacDermott, Baron MacDermott|MacDermott]] observed: "their Lordships could not find any reason for saying that the emergency was not grave and did not threaten the security of Sarawak."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''allocution''', or '''allocutus''', is a formal statement made to the court by the defendant who has been found [[guilt (law)|guilty]] prior to being sentenced. It is part of the criminal procedure in some jurisdictions using [[common law]].

== Concept ==
An allocution allows the defendant to explain why the sentence should be lenient. In [[plea bargain]]s, an allocution may be required of the defendant. The defendant explicitly admits specifically and in detail the actions and their reasons in exchange for a reduced sentence.

In principle, that removes any doubt as to the exact nature of the defendant's guilt in the matter.

The term "allocution" is used generally only in jurisdictions in the United States, but there are vaguely similar processes in other [[common law countries]]. In many other jurisdictions, it is for the defense lawyer to mitigate on his client's behalf, and the defendant rarely has the opportunity to speak.

The right of victims to speak at sentencing is also sometimes referred to as allocution.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|volume=26|publisher=St. Mary's L.J.|pages=1103|date=1994–1995|title=Would You Like More Salt with That Wound - Post-Sentence Victim Allocution in Texas|author=Nicholson, Keith D.|url=http://heinonlinebackup.com/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/stmlj26&amp;section=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australia==
In [[Australia]], the term ''allocutus'' is used by the Clerk of Arraigns or another formal associate of the Court. It is generally phrased as, "Prisoner at the Bar, you have been found Guilty by a jury of your peers of the offense of XYZ. Do you have anything to say as to why the sentence of this Court should not now be passed upon you?" The defense counsel will then make a ''plea in mitigation'' (also called ''submissions on penalty'') in an attempt to mitigate the relative seriousness of the offense and heavily refer to and rely upon the defendant's previous good character and good works, if any.

The right to make a plea in mitigation is absolute. If a judge or magistrate refuses to hear such a plea or does not properly consider it, the sentence can be overturned on appeal.

==United States==
In most of the [[United States]], defendants are allowed the opportunity to allocute before a sentence is passed. Some jurisdictions hold that as an absolute right. In its absence, a sentence but not the conviction may be overturned, resulting in the need for a new sentencing hearing. In the federal system, [[Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure]] 32(i)(4) provides that the court must "address the defendant personally in order to permit the defendant to speak or present any information to mitigate the sentence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcrmp/Rule32.htm|title=Rule 32. Sentencing and Judgment|date=30 November 2011|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|accessdate=22 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Federal Public Defender]] recommends that defendants speak in terms of how a lenient sentence will be sufficient but not greater than necessary to comply with the statutory directives set forth in {{uscsub|18|3553|a}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.fd.org/pdf_lib/allocution+pleading.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=22 December 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019195150/http://fd.org/pdf_lib/allocution%20pleading.pdf |archive-date=19 October 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alternating custody''', also known as ''serial custody'' or ''shared custody'', is an arrangement in which children live for long periods of time with one parent, and then spend a similar amount of time with the other parent.&lt;ref name="Child Custody Made Simple"&gt;{{cite book|author=Webster Watnik|title=Child Custody Made Simple: Understanding the Laws of Child Custody and Child Support|date=April 2003|publisher=Single Parent Press|isbn=978-0-9649404-3-7|pages=16–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary difference between '''alternating custody''' and [[joint custody]] is that in some nations, under an '''alternating custody''' arrangement the parent that currently has the child also retains sole authority over the child/children for the duration that the child/children are with said parent.&lt;ref name="Child Custody Made Simple" /&gt; The general reason for using this arrangement rather than a more commonly used arrangement is that the parents tend to live too far away from each other to allow for other arrangements to be feasible.&lt;ref name="Child Custody Made Simple" /&gt;

== Other forms of custody ==
*[[Sole custody]] is an arrangement whereby only one parent has physical and legal custody of a child.
*[[Joint custody]] is an arrangement whereby both parents have legal custody and/or both parents have physical custody.
*[[Split custody]] is an arrangement whereby one parent has full-time custody over some children, and the other parent has full custody over the other children.
*[[Third-party custody]] is an arrangement in whereby the children do not remain with either biological parent, and are placed under the custody of a third person.
*[[Bird's nest custody]] is an arrangement whereby the parents go back and forth from a residence in which the child/children reside, placing the burden of upheaval and movement on the parents rather than the child/children.

A '''constitutional referendum''' was held in [[Anguilla]] on 6 February 1969.&lt;ref name=DD&gt;[http://www.sudd.ch/event.php?lang=en&amp;id=ai011969 Anguilla, 6 February 1969: Constitution] Direct Democracy {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the 1967 uprising on the island, which had seen the local police force expelled, British troops had taken over Anguilla, before leaving in January 1968. On 8 January 1969 [[Ronald Webster]] declared independence.&lt;ref name=DD/&gt; A republican constitution was put forward and approved by 99.71% of voters.&lt;ref name=DD/&gt; After the referendum, British troops returned to occupy the island on 19 March.&lt;ref name=DD/&gt;

Webster later proposed a referendum with three options; independence, association with the UK or remaining in the [[Saint Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla]] federation.&lt;ref name=DD/&gt; Option two was later introduced without a vote, and Anguilla was administered separately from 1971, before being officially separated from [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]] in 1980.&lt;ref name=DD/&gt;

The '''Anne Frank Human Rights Memorial''' is a {{convert|.81|acre|ha}}  [[cenotaph]] complex and [[educational park]] in [[Boise, Idaho]] near the Boise Public Library and the [[Boise Greenbelt|Greenbelt]], the centerpiece of which is a statue of [[Anne Frank]]; it is jointly maintained by the Wassmuth Center for Human rights and the Boise Department of Parks and Recreation, and is the only human rights memorial in the U.S.&lt;ref name="Only Human Rights Memorial in the U.S."&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.idahostatesman.com/news/local/article153899354.html |title=Bieter urges crowd to ‘stand up to power’ at anti-hate Anne Frank Memorial ceremony |last=Webb |first=Anna |date=2017-06-01 |website=The Idaho Statesman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Designed by Idaho Falls architect Kurt Karst, a sapling of the [[Anne Frank Tree]] and quotations from some sixty notables and unknowns (including poets, activists, politicians and diplomats, those who survived the [[Holocaust]], and those who did not) are prominent installations.&lt;ref name="Idaho Anne Frank Human Rights Memorial"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://parks.cityofboise.org/parks-locations/parks/idaho-anne-frank-human-rights-memorial/ |title=Idaho Anne Frank Human Rights Memorial |authorlink=Boise Parks &amp; Recreation}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also features one of the few installations where the full text of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] is on permanent [[public art|public display]]. The park been recognized and accepted by the [[International Coalition of Sites of Conscience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://wassmuthcenter.org/the-memorial/ |title=International Coalition of Sites of Conscience |website=Wassmuth Center for Human Rights}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was thoroughly renovated in September 2018, with an outdoor classroom and a new scrupture, "The Spiral of Injustice." &lt;ref name="September 2018 renovation"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.idahostatesman.com/news/local/community/boise/article218740890.html |title=With racist graffiti in the past, Boise celebrates new day for Anne Frank memorial  |last=Berg |first=Sven |date=2018-09-20 |website=The Idaho Statesman |access-date=2018-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site does not only serve as a convenient staging area for rallies, marches, and protests (and more generally as a contemplative spot), it is where the [[Boise Police Department]] takes their newly commissioned officers before field training.&lt;ref name="More Vandalism"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.idahostatesman.com/news/local/community/boise/article149968282.html |title=Anne Frank Memorial hit with another act of vandalism: ‘It’s a cowardly act, it’s a criminal act’ |last=Kyle |first=Zach |date=2017-05-11 |editor2-link=Idaho Statesman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vandalism==

In early May 2017 the plaque featuring the beginning of the complete Universal Declaration of Human Rights  was vandalized with [[Anti-semitism|antisemitic]] graffiti in red marker; more generally two different areas of the site were also defaced over the next few days with racist slurs against black people and Jews causing $20,000 in damage, due in part to the botched initial attempts at repair.&lt;ref name=" Woman donates $20,000 to repair Anne Frank Memorial"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ktvb.com/news/local/woman-donates-20000-to-repair-anne-frank-memorial/439023387 |title= Woman donates $20,000 to repair Anne Frank Memorial |last=Shaver |first=Natalie |date=2017-05-12 |website=KTVB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Anne Frank Memorial in Idaho Vandalized"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2017/05/10/anne-frank-memorial-idaho-vandalized |title=Anne Frank Memorial in Idaho Vandalized |last=Morlin |first=Bill |date=2017-05-10 |website=Southern Poverty Law Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;The vandalism, the first since the memorial's dedication in 2002, is being investigated as a potential [[hate crime]], and numerous donations for repair have poured in.&lt;ref name="Donations pour in to repair Boise’s Anne Frank Memorial after vandalism"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.idahostatesman.com/news/local/community/boise/article150299527.html |title=Donations pour in to repair Boise’s Anne Frank Memorial after vandalism |last=Sowell |first=John |date=2014-05-13 |website=Idaho Statesman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australian [[corporate tax|company tax]] rate has varied over time. It has been a [[flat rate]] and reached its peak of 49%. Before 1987, Australia had the classical dividend taxation system, whereby a company's profit would be taxed at the company tax rate and a shareholder would be taxed on a dividend received, giving raise to what is described as [[double taxation]]. In 1987, the [[Australian dividend imputation system]] was introduced to stop the double taxation,&lt;ref&gt;Act No. 59 of 1987&lt;/ref&gt; and to create a "level playing field". The company tax rate was reduced to 39% in 1988 and 33% in 1993, and increased again in 1995 to 36%, to be reduced to 34% in 2000 and 30% in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/factcheck/2016-06-29/fact-check-labor-on-corporate-tax-cuts/7549754|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|title=Fact check: Did Labor previously make the same arguments as the Government on company tax?|date=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

From 2015/16, designated "small business entities" with an aggregated annual turnover threshold of less than $2 million were eligible for a lower tax rate of 28.5%. Since 1 July 2016, small business entities with aggregated annual turnover of less than $10 million have had a reduced company tax rate of 27.5%. Additionally, the Australian Government announced that from 2017/18, corporate entities eligible for the lower tax rate will be known as "base rate entities". The small business definition will remain at $10 million from 2017/18 onwards, however the base rate entity threshold (the aggregated annual turnover threshold under which entities will be eligible to pay a lower tax rate) will continue to rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ato.gov.au/General/New-legislation/In-detail/Direct-taxes/Income-tax-for-businesses/Reducing-the-corporate-tax-rate/|title=Reducing the corporate tax rate|date=4 July 2017|publisher=Australian Taxation Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dividend imputation ==
{{main|Australian dividend imputation system}}
Australia introduced a dividend imputation system in 1987, making the company tax rate less relevant, especially on company profits distributed to [[Income tax in Australia#Residency for tax purposes|Australian-resident shareholders]] in the form of franked dividends.

Australian companies that have paid Australian company tax can declare how much of the tax paid is to be imputed or associated with any dividend it pays. Dividends with the maximum imputed tax amount is called a franked dividend, while any other dividend is unfranked. Australian-resident shareholders who receive franked dividends from Australian companies would declare both the dividends and the imputation credits on their tax returns, but are entitled to claim back a tax credit (called a franking credit) on those imputed tax credits. The franking credits associated with such dividends are a tax credit against the shareholder's tax liability. Initially, in 1987, excess franking credits over the tax liability were lost, but since 2000 such excess credits have been refundable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Investing/In-detail/Investing-in-shares/Refunding-franking-credits---individuals/|title=Refunding excess franking credits – individuals|date=28 June 2017|publisher=Australian Taxation Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; Effectively, the Australian shareholder receives a reimbursement of the company tax paid, and the company profit is taxed at the shareholders’ marginal tax rates. Company profits not distributed are taxed at the company tax rate, until such retained profits are distributed.

Non-resident shareholders are not entitled to claim a tax credit or refund of imputation credits. Unfranked dividends received by non-residents are subject to a [[withholding tax]], which does not apply to franked dividends.

==Proposed company tax cuts==
In the [[Australian federal budget, 2016|May 2016 budget]], the [[Turnbull government]] outlined company tax cuts. The small to medium business tax rate would be lowered by 1% to 27.5%, effective 1 July 2016.&lt;ref name="smh-smallbusiness"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Khadem|first1=Nassim|title=Federal Budget 2016: Tax cuts for small businesses, sole traders|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/federal-budget/federal-budget-2016-tax-cuts-for-small-businesses-sole-traders-20160503-1nvqgn.html|website=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|accessdate=6 May 2016|date=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="afr-smallbusiness"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mather|first1=Joanna|last2=Anderson|first2=Fleur|title=Budget 2016: Small business cleans up $5.3 billion tax cuts|url=http://www.afr.com/news/policy/budget/budget-2016-small-business-cleans-up-53-billion-tax-cuts-20160422-god25l|website=[[The Australian Financial Review]]|accessdate=6 May 2016|date=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The turnover threshold in which small businesses would be eligible for this lower tax rate would raise from $2 million to $10 million, with the expectation that it would be raised again to $25 million in 2017–18, $50 million in 2018–19, and eventually $100 million in 2019–20.&lt;ref name="abc-smallbusiness"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Janda|first1=Michael|title=Budget extends company tax breaks, multinational crackdown|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-05-03/budget-2016-company-tax-break-multinational-crackdown/7381134|website=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News Australia]]|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=6 May 2016|date=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="theaustralian-smallbusiness-1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kelly|first1=Joe|title=Up to 60,000 to get rate relief|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/budget-2016/budget-2016-small-business-tax-rate-slashed-by-25-per-cent/news-story/674570561904a9f76276e2de36380a8b|website=[[The Australian]]|publisher=[[News Corp Australia]]|accessdate=6 May 2016|date=4 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is expected this tax cut will affect over 870,000 businesses, employing 3.4 million workers.&lt;ref name="sbs-smallbusiness"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sinclair|first1=Hannah|title=Budget 2016: Small business tax cut to encourage ‘investment and enterprise’|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2016/05/03/budget-2016-small-business-tax-cut-encourage-investment-and-enterprise|website=[[SBS World News]]|publisher=[[Special Broadcasting Service]]|accessdate=6 May 2016|date=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 6,000 [[Sole proprietorship|Sole traders]], employing 1.5 million workers, will also receive a lower tax cut of 2.5% to 26.0%, subject to the same turnover threshold eligibility as small businesses and along with the same increase in turnover threshold over time.&lt;ref name="smh-smallbusiness"/&gt; The unincorporated small business tax discount will also be increased by 3%, up to a fixed rate of 8%,&lt;ref name="dailytelegraph-smallbusiness"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sexton|first1=Jennifer|title=Budget 2016: Small business cleans up $5.3 billion tax cuts|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/federal-budget-2016-small-business-players-just-had-a-big-win/news-story/e561a038852709de4100c726d8808cdf|website=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[News Corp Australia]]|accessdate=6 May 2016|date=4 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the turnover threshold being increased to $5 million. After 2016–17, it is expected that the discount for unincorporated small businesses will increase to 16% by stages, before the 2026-27 financial year.&lt;ref name="smh-smallbusiness"/&gt; In the forecast for the budget, [[Big business]]es will receive a 5% cut to the corporate income tax rate, down to the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] average of 25%, within a decade; the first reduction in the corporate tax rate in 15 years.&lt;ref name="guardian-bigbusiness"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hutchens|first1=Gareth|title=Corporate tax cuts to cost budget $5.3bn over four years|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/03/corporate-tax-cuts-to-cost-budget-53bn-over-four-years|website=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|accessdate=6 May 2016|date=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the rate will stay fixed at 30% in the meantime, the Turnbull Government plans to reduce it to a rate equal to the small and medium business tax rate of 27.5% in 2023-24, before being reduced to 27% in 2024-25, 26% in 2025-26, and eventually a fixed rate of 25% in 2026-27.&lt;ref name="guardian-bigbusiness"/&gt;

As at May 2018, the government had legislated the first phase of the plan, giving tax cuts to companies with turnover of up to $50 million at a cost of $29.8 billion over the first decade. The second phase, costing another $35.6 billion over the same period,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theage.com.au/politics/federal/nervous-coalition-mps-privately-consider-the-pros-and-cons-of-shelving-their-company-tax-cut-policy-20180522-p4zgv0.html&lt;/ref&gt; has already been blocked in the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theage.com.au/politics/federal/malcolm-turnbull-has-just-been-given-the-perfect-excuse-to-shelve-his-company-tax-cuts-20180522-p4zgq1.html Malcolm Turnbull has just been given the perfect excuse to shelve his company tax cuts]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bullfighting''' is a physical contest that involves humans and animals attempting to publicly subdue, immobilise, or kill a bull, usually according to a set of rules, guidelines, or cultural expectations. There are many different forms and varieties in various locations around the world.  Some forms involve dancing around or  over a cow or bull, or attempting to grasp an object from the animal.

The best-known form of bullfighting is [[Spanish-style bullfighting]], a traditional spectacle in countries including [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], parts of southern [[France]], and some [[Latin America]]n countries ([[Mexico]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Venezuela]] and [[Peru]]). While some forms are sometimes considered to be a [[blood sport]], in some countries, for example Spain, it is defined as an art form or cultural event&lt;ref&gt;http://dle.rae.es/?w=tauromaquia&lt;/ref&gt; and relevant regulatory frameworks liken it to other cultural events and heritage.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elmundo.es/cultura/2013/11/06/527ab20e684341e70a8b4576.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://revista.drclas.harvard.edu/book/las-corridas-de-toros-spanish-version&lt;/ref&gt; In Spain, ''toreros'' (see [[Bullfighter]]) are almost as popular as football stars, often supported by sponsors and appearing in press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.valenciavalencia.com/culture-guide/bull-fighting.htm|title=Bull-Fighting (Corrida de Toros) in Valencia}}&lt;/ref&gt; A particular breed of cattle, the [[Spanish Fighting Bull]], is used for this type of bullfighting. These bulls must be bred in large ranches, and in conditions as similar as possible to the way they would live in the wild.

There are many historic [[Bullring|fighting venues]] in the [[Iberian Peninsula]], France, and Latin America. The largest venue of its kind is the [[Plaza México]] in central [[Mexico City]], which seats 48,000 people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldstadiums.com/north_america/countries/mexico/central_mexico.shtml |title=www.worldstadiums.com |publisher=www.worldstadiums.com |date= |accessdate=28 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605140518/http://www.worldstadiums.com/north_america/countries/mexico/central_mexico.shtml |archivedate=5 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the oldest are the Plazas of [[Béjar]] and [[Ronda]], in the Spanish provinces of [[Salamanca]] and [[Málaga]]. All the bullrings have a complex pricing system, main factors being the sun and shadow, proximity to the action, and experience levels of ''torero''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rove.me/to/valencia/corrida-de-toros|title=Corrida de Toros}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of bullfighting is controversial because of a range of concerns including animal welfare, funding, and religion. Bullfighting is illegal in most countries, but remains legal in most areas of [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]], as well as in some [[Hispanic America|Hispanic American]] countries and some parts of southern [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsi.org/issues/bullfighting/facts/bullfighting_europe.html|title=Bullfighting in Europe|website=Humane Society International|access-date=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Knossos Bull-Leaping Fresco.jpg|thumb|[[Bull-leaping]]: [[Bull-Leaping Fresco|Fresco]] from [[Knossos]], Crete]]
Bullfighting traces its roots to prehistoric [[bull worship]] and [[animal sacrifice|sacrifice]] in Mesopotamia and the Mediterranean region. The first recorded bullfight may be the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]],'' which describes a scene in which Gilgamesh and Enkidu fought and killed the Bull of Heaven ("The Bull seemed indestructible, for hours they fought, till Gilgamesh dancing in front of the Bull, lured it with his tunic and bright weapons, and Enkidu thrust his sword, deep into the Bull's neck, and killed it").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ziolkowski|first=Theodore|title=Gilgamesh among Us: Modern Encounters with the Ancient Epic|year=2011|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0801450358|page=51|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=snz_Wle6zvgC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq=Bullfight+gilgamesh&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fDxxUaCPLMKNO-P1gegK&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Bullfight%20gilgamesh&amp;f=false|authorlink=Theodore Ziolkowski}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bull leaping was portrayed in Crete, and myths related to bulls throughout Greece. The killing of the sacred bull ([[tauroctony]]) is the essential central iconic act of [[Mithraic mysteries|Mithras]], which was commemorated in the [[mithraeum]] wherever Roman soldiers were stationed. The oldest representation of what seems to be a man facing a bull is on the [[Celtiberians|Celtiberian]] [[tombstone]] from [[Clunia]] and the [[cave painting]] ''El toro de hachos'', both found in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Guillaume ROUSSEL |url=http://www.arbre-celtique.com/encyclopedie/pierre-tombale-de-clunia-4473.htm |title=Pierre tombale de Clunia – 4473 – L'encyclopédie – L'Arbre Celtique |publisher=Arbre-celtique.com |date= |accessdate=28 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Toro de Lidia |url=http://www.cetnotorolidia.es/opencms_wf/opencms/toro_de_lidia/origen_e_historia/index.html |title=Toro de Lidia – Toro de lidia |publisher=Cetnotorolidia.es |date=15 November 2006 |accessdate=28 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bullfighting is often linked to [[Roman Empire|Rome]], where many human-versus-animal events were held as competition and entertainment, the ''[[Venatio]]nes''. These hunting games spread to [[Africa]], [[Europe]] and [[Asia]] during [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times. There are also theories that it was introduced into Hispania by the Emperor [[Claudius]], as a substitute for [[gladiator]]s, when he instituted a short-lived ban on gladiatorial combat. The latter theory was supported by [[Robert Graves]] ([[picador]]s are related to warriors who wielded the [[javelin]], but their role in the contest is now a minor one limited to "preparing" the bull for the matador.) Spanish colonists took the practice of breeding cattle and bullfighting to the American colonies, the Pacific and Asia. In the 19th century, areas of southern and southwestern France adopted bullfighting, developing their own distinctive form.

[[File:Fresque Mithraeum Marino.jpg|thumb|Mithras killing a bull]]
Religious festivities and royal weddings were celebrated by fights in the local plaza, where noblemen would ride competing for royal favor, and the populace enjoyed the excitement. In the Middle Ages across Europe, knights would joust in competitions on horseback. In Spain, they began to fight bulls.

In medieval Spain bullfighting was considered a noble sport and reserved to the rich, who could afford to supply and train their animals. The bull was released into a closed arena where a single fighter on horseback was armed with a lance. This spectacle was said to be enjoyed by [[Charlemagne]], [[Alfonso X of Castile|Alfonso X the Wise]] and the [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohad caliphs]], among others. The greatest Spanish performer of this art is said to have been the knight [[El Cid]].  According to a chronicle of the time, in 1128 "... when [[Alfonso VII of León and Castile]] married [[Berengaria of Barcelona]]  daughter of [[Ramon Berenguer III, Count of Barcelona]] at [[Saldaña, Palencia|Saldaña]] among other celebrations, there were also bullfights."&lt;ref&gt;Mariano José de Larra, [[:m:s:es:Corridas de toros|«Corridas de toros»]], en ''[[El Duende satírico del día]]'' (Madrid), 31 May 1828. {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the time of Emperor Charles V, Pedro Ponce de Leon was the most famous bullfighter in Spain and a renovator of the technique of killing the bull on a horse with blindfolded eyes.&lt;ref&gt;Pascual Barea, Joaquín. “[https://www.academia.edu/30661142/_Benito_Arias_Montano_y_su_maestro_de_poes%C3%ADa_Juan_de_Quir%C3%B3s_Benito_Arias_Montano_y_los_humanistas_de_su_tiempo_M%C3%A9rida_Editora_Regional_de_Extremadura_2006_1_125-149 Benito Arias Montano y su maestro de poesía Juan de Quirós]”, ''Benito Arias Montano y los humanistas de su tiempo.''

[[Francisco Romero (bullfighter)|Francisco Romero]], from [[Ronda, Spain]], is generally regarded as having been the first to introduce the practice of fighting bulls on foot around 1726, using the [[muleta]] in the last stage of the fight and an [[estoc]] to kill the bull. This type of fighting drew more attention from the crowds. Thus the modern ''corrida'', or fight, began to take form, as riding noblemen were replaced by commoners on foot. This new style prompted the construction of dedicated bullrings, initially square, like the ''[[Plaza de Armas]]'', and later round, to discourage the cornering of the action.

The modern style of Spanish bullfighting is credited to [[Juan Belmonte]], generally considered the greatest matador of all time. Belmonte introduced a daring and revolutionary style, in which he stayed within a few centimetres of the bull throughout the fight. Although extremely dangerous (Belmonte was gored on many occasions), his style is still seen by most matadors as the ideal to be emulated.

Originally, at least five distinct regional styles of bullfighting were practised in southwestern Europe: [[Andalusia]], [[Aragon]]&amp;ndash;[[Navarre]], [[Alentejo]], [[Camargue]], [[Aquitaine]]. Over time, these have evolved more or less into standardized national forms mentioned below. The "classic" style of bullfight, in which the bull is killed, is the form practiced in Spain and many Latin American countries.

===Spanish===
{{Main|Spanish-style bullfighting}}

Spanish-style bullfighting is called ''corrida de toros'' (literally "[[Coursing|coursing]] of bulls") or ''la fiesta'' ("the festival"). In the traditional corrida, three ''[[matador]]es'' each fight two bulls, each of which is between four and six years old and weighs no less than 460&amp;nbsp;kg (1,014&amp;nbsp;lb)&lt;ref&gt;[http://legislacion.060.es/8532-ides-idweb.html Royal Decree 145/1996, of {{Nowrap|2 February}}, to modify and reword the Regulations of Taurine Spectacles] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100925213032/http://legislacion.060.es/8532-ides-idweb.html |date=25 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each matador has six assistants—two ''[[picador]]es'' (lancers on horseback) mounted on horseback, three ''[[banderillero]]s'' – who along with the matadors are collectively known as ''[[torero]]s'' (bullfighters) – and a ''mozo de espadas'' (sword page). Collectively they comprise a ''cuadrilla'' (entourage). In Spanish the more general ''torero'' or ''diestro'' (literally 'right-hander') is used for the lead fighter, and only when needed to distinguish a man is the full title ''matador de toros'' used; in English, "matador" is generally used for the bullfighter.

[[File:José Arévalo en 2009 à Beaucaire.ogg|thumb|left|Welcoming of a toro" ''a porta gayola'' and series of ''verónica,'' terminated by a semi-verónica.]]

====Structure====
The modern corrida is highly ritualized, with three distinct stages or ''tercios'' ("thirds"); the start of each being announced by a bugle sound. The participants enter the arena in a parade, called the ''paseíllo'', to salute the presiding dignitary, accompanied by band music. Torero costumes are inspired by 17th-century Andalusian clothing, and matadores are easily distinguished by the gold of their ''[[traje de luces]]'' ("suit of lights"), as opposed to the lesser banderilleros, who are also known as ''toreros de plata'' ("bullfighters of silver").

=====''Tercio de Varas''=====
The bull is released into the ring, where he is tested for ferocity by the ''matador'' and ''banderilleros'' with the magenta and gold ''capote'' ("cape"). This is the first stage, the ''[[tercio de varas]]'' ("the lancing third"). The matador confronts the bull with the capote, performing a series of passes and observing the behavior and quirks of the bull.

Next, a picador enters the arena on horseback armed with a ''vara'' (lance). To protect the horse from the bull's horns, the animal wears a protective, padded covering called ''peto''.  Prior to 1930, the horses did not wear any protection. Often the bull would disembowel the horse during this stage. Until the use of protection was instituted, the number of horses killed during a fiesta generally exceeded the number of bulls killed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/84444/bullfighting "Bullfighting." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2009. Encyclopædia Britannica Online.] 14 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

At this point, the picador stabs just behind the ''morrillo'', a mound of muscle on the fighting bull's neck, weakening the neck muscles and leading to the animal's first loss of blood. The manner in which the bull charges the horse provides important clues to the matador about the bull such as which horn the bull favors. As a result of the injury and also the fatigue of striving to injure the armoured heavy horse, the bull holds its head and horns slightly lower during the following stages of the fight. This ultimately enables the matador to perform the killing thrust later in the performance. The encounter with the picador often fundamentally changes the behaviour of a bull; distracted and unengaging bulls will become more focused and stay on a single target instead of charging at everything that moves, conserving their diminished energy reserves.

=====''Tercio de Banderillas''=====
In the next stage, the ''tercio de banderillas'' ("the third of banderillas"), each of the three banderilleros attempts to plant two ''banderillas'', sharp barbed sticks, into the bull's shoulders. These anger and agitate the bull reinvigorating him from the ''aplomado'' (literally 'leadened') state his attacks on the horse and injuries from the lance left him in. Sometimes a matador will place his own banderillas. If so, he usually embellishes this part of his performance and employs more varied manoeuvres than the standard ''al cuarteo'' method commonly used by banderilleros.

[[File:Matador.JPG|thumb|Plaza de Toros Las Ventas in Madrid]]

=====''Tercio de Muerte''=====
In the final stage, the ''tercio de muerte'' ("the third of death"), the matador re-enters the ring alone with a smaller red cloth, or ''[[muleta]]'', and a sword. It is a common misconception that the color red is supposed to anger the bull; the animals are functionally [[colorblind]] in this respect: the bull is incited to charge by the movement of the muleta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itla.net/index.cfm?sec=Longhorn_Information&amp;con=handling |title=Longhorn_Information – handling |publisher=ITLA |date= |accessdate=28 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100511090201/http://www.itla.net/index.cfm?sec=Longhorn_Information&amp;con=handling |archivedate=11 May 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iacuc.tennessee.edu/pdf/Policies-AnimalCare/Cattle-BasicCare.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625012822/http://iacuc.tennessee.edu/pdf/Policies-AnimalCare/Cattle-BasicCare.pdf |archivedate=25 June 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The muleta is thought to be red to mask the bull's blood, although the color is now a matter of tradition. The matador uses his muleta to attract the bull in a series of passes, which serve the dual purpose of wearing the animal down for the kill and creating sculptural forms between man in animal that can fascinate or thrill the audience, and which when linked together in a rhythm create a dance of passes, or ''faena''. The matador will often try to enhance the drama of the dance by bringing the bull's horns especially close to his body. The faena refers to the entire performance with the muleta.

The faena is usually broken down into ''tandas'', or "series", of passes. The faena ends with a final series of passes in which the matador, using the cape, tries to maneuver the bull into a position to stab it between the shoulder blades going over the horns and thus exposing his own body to the bull. The sword is called ''estoque,'' and the act of thrusting the sword is called an ''estocada''. During the initial series, while the matador in part is performing for the crowd, he uses a fake sword (''estoque simulado''). This is made of wood or aluminum, making it lighter and much easier to handle. The ''estoque de verdad'' (real sword) is made out of steel. At the end of the tercio de muerte, when the matador has finished his faena, he will change swords to take up the steel one. He performs the estocada with the intent of piercing the heart of aorta or severing other major blood vessels to induce a quick death, if all goes according to plan. Often this does not happen and repeated efforts must be made to bring the bull down, sometimes the matador changing to the 'descabello', which resembles a sword, but is actually a heavy dagger blade at the end of a steel rod which is thrust between the cervical vertebrae to sever the spinal column and induce instant death. Even if the descabello is not required and the bull falls quickly from the sword one of the banderilleros will perform this function with an actual dagger to ensure the bull is dead. 

If the matador has performed particularly well, the crowd may petition the president by waving white handkerchiefs to award the matador an ear of the bull. If his performance was exceptional, the president will award two ears. In certain more rural rings, the practice includes an award of the bull's tail. Very rarely, if the public and the matador believe that the bull has fought extremely bravely - and the breeder of the bull agrees to have it return to the ranch - the event's president may grant the bull a pardon (''indulto''). If the indulto is granted, the bull's life is spared; it leaves the ring alive and is returned to its home ranch for treatment and then to become a ''semental'', or seed-bull, for the rest its life.

Recortes, a style of bullfighting practiced in [[Navarre]], [[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja]], north of Castile and [[Valencian Community|Valencia]], has been much less popular than the traditional corridas. But recortes have undergone a revival in Spain and are sometimes broadcast on TV.

This style was common in the early 19th century. Etchings by painter [[Francisco Goya|Francisco de Goya]] depict these events.

Recortes differ from a corrida in the following ways:
* The bull is not physically injured. Drawing blood is rare, and the bull is allowed to return to his pen at the end of the performance.
* The men are dressed in common street clothes rather than traditional bullfighting dress.
* Acrobatics are performed without the use of capes or other props. Performers attempt to evade the bull solely through the swiftness of their movements.
* Rituals are less strict, so the men have freedom to perform stunts as they please.
* Men work in teams but with less role distinction than in a corrida.
* Teams compete for points awarded by a jury.

Since horses are not used, and performers are not professionals, recortes are less costly to produce.

====Comic bullfighting====
Comical spectacles based on bullfighting, called ''espectáculos cómico-taurinos'' or ''charlotadas'', are still popular in Spain and Mexico. Troupes include ''El empastre'' or ''El bombero torero''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ganaderoslidia.com/webroot/rd-145-96.htm Bullfighting Spectacles: State Norms (in Spanish)] Example: ''Los espectáculos cómico-taurinos no podrán celebrarse conjuntamente con otros festejos taurinos en los que se dé muerte a las reses.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Encierros ====
{{Main|Running of the Bulls}}

An ''encierro'' or ''running of the bulls'' is an activity related to a bullfighting fiesta. Before the events that are held in the ring, people (usually young men) run in front of a small group of bulls that have been let loose, on a course of a sectioned-off subset of a town's streets.

====Toro embolado====
{{Main|Toro embolado}}

A ''toro embolado'' (in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]), ''bou embolat'' (in [[Catalan language|Catalan]]), roughly meaning "bull with balls", is a festive activity held at night and typical of many towns in [[Spain]] (mainly in the [[Valencian Community]] and Southern [[Catalonia]]). Balls of flammable material are attached to a bull's horns. The balls are lit and the bull is set free in the streets at night; participants dodge the bull when it comes close. It can be considered a variant of an ''encierro'' (''correbous'' in Catalan). This activity is held in a number of [[Spain|Spanish]] towns during their [[Fiesta patronal|local festivals]]. In recent years, animal welfare activists have tried to stop the practice because of [[animal cruelty|cruelty to the animal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=League Against Cruel Sports |title=We've come a long way, baby ... |url=http://www.league.org.uk/blogs_entry.aspx?id=117 |accessdate=5 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101109054022/http://www.league.org.uk/blogs_entry.aspx?id=117 |archivedate=9 November 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Typically Spanish - Spain News, [http://www.typicallyspanish.com/news/publish/article_32664.shtml Toro Jubilo fiesta returns to Medinaceli, Soria ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121029022313/http://www.typicallyspanish.com/news/publish/article_32664.shtml |date=29 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;PETA, [http://action.peta.org.uk/ea-campaign/clientcampaign.do?ea.client.id=5&amp;ea.campaign.id=4590&amp;c=pukfpaa Help Stop the Sadistic 'Fire Bull' Festival in Soria]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Toro Jubilo' 2011 en Medinaceli, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKLn8uGCguk on YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Portuguese===
[[File:Portuguese bullfight.jpg|''Cavaleiro'' and bull|thumb]]
{{Main|Portuguese-style bullfighting}}

Most Portuguese bullfights are held in two phases: the spectacle of the ''cavaleiro'', and the ''pega''. In the ''cavaleiro'', a horseman on a [[Lusitano|Portuguese Lusitano]] horse (specially trained for the fights) fights the bull from horseback. The purpose of this fight is to stab three or four ''bandeiras'' (small [[spear|javelins]]) into the back of the bull.

In the second stage, called the ''pega'' ("holding"), the [[forcado]]s, a group of eight men, challenge the bull directly without any protection or weapon of defence. The front man provokes the bull into a charge to perform a ''pega de cara'' or ''pega de caras'' (face grab). The front man secures the animal's head and is quickly aided by his fellows who surround and secure the animal until he is subdued.&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson, Andy, (2007), [http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2007/08/12/TRU1RCGLG.DTL "California's 'bloodless bullfights' keep Portuguese tradition alive"], San Francisco Chronicle.&lt;/ref&gt;  Forcados are dressed in a traditional costume of [[damask]] or [[velvet]], with long knitted hats as worn by the ''campinos'' (bull headers) from [[Ribatejo]].

The bull is not killed in the ring and, at the end of the ''corrida'', leading oxen are let into the arena and two ''campinos'' on foot herd the bull among them back to its pen. The bull is usually killed out of sight of the audience by a professional butcher. It can happen that some bulls, after an exceptional performance, are healed, released to pasture until the end of their days and used for breeding.

In the Portuguese [[Azores]] islands, there is a form of bullfighting called ''[[tourada à corda]]'', in which a bull is led on a rope along a street, while players taunt and dodge the bull, who is not killed during or after the fight, but returned to pasture and used in later events.

===French===
[[File:Amfitheater.jpg|thumb|The Roman amphitheatre at [[Arles]] being fitted for a corrida]]
[[File:Bullfight incident, Arles.jpg|thumb|A bullfight in Arles in 1898.]]

Since the 19th century, Spanish-style ''corridas'' have been increasingly popular in [[Southern France]] where they enjoy legal protection in areas where there is an uninterrupted tradition of such bull fights, particularly during holidays such as [[Whitsun]] or [[Easter]]. Among France's most important venues for bullfighting are the ancient Roman arenas of [[Nîmes]] and [[Arles]], although there are bull rings across the South from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic coasts. Bullfights of this kind follow the Spanish tradition and even Spanish words are used for all Bullfighting related terms. Minor cosmetic differences exist such as music. This is not to be confused with the bloodless bullfights referred to below which are indigenous to France.

[[File:Bull and Raseteur at 75th Cocarde dOr.jpg|thumb|left|A raseteur takes a rosette]]

====''Course camarguaise'' (''course libre'')====
A more indigenous genre of bullfighting is widely common in the [[Provence]] and [[Languedoc]] areas, and is known alternately as "''course libre''" or "''course camarguaise''". This is a bloodless spectacle (for the bulls) in which the objective is to snatch a rosette from the head of a young bull. The participants, or ''raseteurs'', begin training in their early teens against young bulls from the [[Camargue]] region of Provence before graduating to regular contests held principally in Arles and Nîmes but also in other Provençal and Languedoc towns and villages. Before the ''course'', an ''abrivado''—a "running" of the bulls in the streets—takes place, in which young men compete to outrun the charging bulls. The ''course'' itself takes place in a small (often portable) arena erected in a town square. For a period of about 15–20 minutes, the ''raseteurs'' compete to snatch rosettes (''cocarde'') tied between the bulls' horns. They do not take the rosette with their bare hands but with a claw-shaped metal instrument called a ''raset'' or ''crochet'' (''hook'') in their hands, hence their name. Afterwards, the bulls are herded back to their pen by ''[[gardian]]s'' (Camarguais [[cowboy]]s) in a ''bandido'', amidst a great deal of ceremony. The stars of these spectacles are the bulls.&lt;ref&gt;''Vaches Pour Cash: L'Economie de L'Encierro Provençale'', Dr. Yves O'Malley, Nanterre University 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Course landaise''====
Another type of French 'bullfighting' is the "[[course landaise]]", in which cows are used instead of bulls. This is a competition between teams named ''cuadrillas'', which belong to certain breeding estates. A cuadrilla is made up of a ''teneur de corde'', an ''entraîneur'', a ''sauteur'', and six ''écarteurs''. The cows are brought to the arena in crates and then taken out in order. The teneur de corde controls the dangling rope attached to the cow's horns and the entraîneur positions the cow to face and attack the player. The écarteurs will try, at the last possible moment, to dodge around the cow and the sauteur will leap over it. Each team aims to complete a set of at least one hundred dodges and eight leaps. This is the main scheme of the "classic" form, the ''course landaise formelle''. However, different rules may be applied in some competitions. For example, competitions for Coupe Jeannot Lafittau are arranged with cows without ropes.

At one point, it resulted in so many fatalities that the French government tried to ban it, but had to back down in the face of local opposition. The bulls themselves are generally fairly small, much less imposing than the adult bulls employed in the ''corrida''. Nonetheless, the bulls remain dangerous due to their mobility and vertically formed horns. Participants and spectators share the risk; it is not unknown for angry bulls to smash their way through barriers and charge the surrounding crowd of spectators. The ''course landaise'' is not seen as a dangerous sport by many, but écarteur Jean-Pierre Rachou died in 2003 when a bull's horn tore his [[femoral artery]].

Jallikattu is a traditional spectacle played in [[Tamil Nadu]], [[India]] as a part of [[Pongal]] celebrations on [[Mattu Pongal]] day. [[Bos indicus]] bulls are bred specifically for the sporting event and a specific breed of cattle bred for this purpose is known as "Jellicut".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tanuvas.tn.nic.in/nea/docs/AnGR_of_TN.pdf |title=Jellicut cattle breed |format=PDF |publisher=TANUVAS |access-date=1 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007040211/http://www.tanuvas.tn.nic.in/nea/docs/AnGR_of_TN.pdf |archivedate=7 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During jallikattu, a bull is released into a group of people, and participants attempt to grab the bull's hump and hold onto it for a determined distance, length of time, or with the goal of taking a pack of money tied to the bull's horns.

Freestyle bullfighting is a style of bullfighting developed in American [[rodeo]]. The style was developed by the [[rodeo clown]]s who protect [[bull riding|bull riders]] from being trampled or gored by an angry bull. Freestyle bullfighting is a 70-second competition in which the bullfighter (rodeo clown) avoids the bull by means of dodging, jumping and use of a barrel.
Competitions are organized in the US as the World Bullfighting Championship (WBC) and the [[Dickies]] National Bullfighting Championship under auspices of the [[Professional Bull Riders]] (PBR).

A distinct type of bloodless bullfighting is practised in California's [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]]. In this historically Portuguese-settled area, a form of bullfight has developed in which the bull is taunted by a matador, but the lances are tipped with [[Hook and loop fastener]]s (e.g. [[Velcro]]) and aimed at similar patches secured to the bull's shoulder. Fights occur from May through October around traditional Portuguese holidays.&lt;ref name="Rubin2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Saul Rubin|title=Northern California Curiosities: Quirky Characters, Roadside Oddities, and Other Offbeat Stuff|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mtAoDbEEYQkC&amp;pg=PA154|accessdate=15 September 2013|date=1 June 2005|publisher=Globe Pequot Press|isbn=978-0-7627-2899-2|pages=154–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tanzania===
Bullfighting was introduced by the Portuguese to [[Zanzibar]] and to [[Pemba Island]], in modern Tanzania, where it is known as ''[[mchezo wa ngombe]]''. Similar to the Portuguese Azorean ''tourada a corda'', the bull is restrained by a rope, generally neither bull nor player is harmed, and the bull is not killed at the end of the fight.&lt;ref name="Petterson2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald Petterson|title=Revolution in Zanzibar: An American's Cold War Tale|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vBqBLjGCOpMC&amp;pg=PA253|accessdate=15 September 2013|date=1 September 2004|publisher=Westview|isbn=978-0-8133-4268-9|pages=253–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://janus.lib.cam.ac.uk/db/node.xsp?id=EAD/GBR/0115/RCMS%20162/Y304Q/6/2|title=Janus: Papers and photographs of Fergus Wilson|publisher=|accessdate=21 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hazards==

Spanish-style bullfighting is normally fatal for the bull, but it is also dangerous for the matador. Danger for the bullfighter is essential; if there is no danger, it is not considered bullfighting in Spain. Matadors are usually gored every season, with picadors and banderilleros being gored less often. With the discovery of antibiotics and advances in surgical techniques, fatalities are now rare, although over the past three centuries 534 professional bullfighters have died in the ring or from injuries sustained there. Most recently, [[Iván Fandiño]] died of injuries he sustained after being gored by a bull on June 17, 2017 in Aire-sur-l'Adour, France.

Some matadors, notably [[Juan Belmonte]], have been seriously gored many times: according to [[Ernest Hemingway]], Belmonte's legs were marred by many ugly scars. A special type of [[surgeon]] has developed, in Spain and elsewhere, to treat ''cornadas'', or horn-wounds.

The bullring has a chapel where a matador can pray before the corrida, and where a [[priest]] can be found in case a [[sacrament]] is needed. The most relevant sacrament is now called "[[Anointing of the Sick]]"; it was formerly known as "Extreme Unction", or the "Last Rites".

The media often reports the more horrific of bullfighting injuries, such as the September 2011 goring of matador [[Juan José Padilla]]'s head by a bull in Zaragoza, resulting in the loss of his left eye, use of his right ear, and facial paralysis. He returned to bullfighting five months later with an eyepatch, multiple titanium plates in his skull, and the nickname 'The Pirate'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fiske-Harrison|first=Alexander|url=http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/comment/articles/2012-09/13/juan-jose-padilla-matador-bullfighting-interview|title=The Last Matador|journal=[[British GQ]]|date=13 September 2012|accessdate=24 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Up through the early twentieth century, the horses were unprotected and were commonly gored and killed, or left close to death (intestines destroyed, for example). The horses used were old and worn-out, with little value. Starting in the twentieth century horses were protected by thick blankets and wounds, though not unknown, were less common and less serious.

==Cultural aspects==
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2010}}
Many supporters of bullfighting regard it as a deeply ingrained, integral part of their national [[culture]]s; in Spain it is called "La fiesta nacional", literally "the national festival". The aesthetic of bullfighting is based on the interaction of the man and the bull. Rather than a competitive sport, the bullfight is more of a ritual of ancient origin, which is judged by ''aficionados'' based on artistic impression and command. Ernest Hemingway said of it in his 1932 non-fiction book ''[[Death in the Afternoon]]'': "Bullfighting is the only art in which the artist is in danger of death and in which the degree of brilliance in the performance is left to the fighter's honour." Bullfighting is seen as a symbol of [[Spanish culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bullfightingfreeeurope.org/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324042443/http://www.bullfightingfreeeurope.org/ |archivedate=24 March 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bullfight is regarded as a demonstration of style, technique and courage by its participants and as a demonstration of cruelty and cowardice by its critics. While there is usually no doubt about the outcome, the bull is not viewed by bullfighting supporters as a sacrificial victim — it is instead seen by the audience as a worthy adversary, deserving of respect in its own right.

Those who oppose bullfighting maintain that the practice is a cowardly, sadistic tradition of torturing, humiliating and killing a bull amidst pomp and pageantry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Laborde|first=Christian|title=Corrida, Basta!|year=2009|publisher=Editions Robert Laffont|location=Paris, France|pages=14–15, 17–19, 38, 40–42, 52–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of bullfights, called "[[aficionados]]", claim they respect the bulls, that the bulls live better than other cattle, and that bullfighting is a grand tradition; a form of art important to their culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|See Id. at 17-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women in bullfighting==
{{See also|List of female bullfighters}}

[[Conchita Cintron]] was a Peruvian female bullfighter, perhaps the most famous in the history of bullfighting.

[[Patricia McCormick (bullfighter)|Patricia McCormick]] began bullfighting as a professional ''Matadora'' in January 1952, and was the first American to do so.&lt;ref name=newyork&gt;{{cite news|last=Mealer|first=Bryan|title=Patricia McCormick, Bullfighter Who Defied Convention, Is Dead at 83|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/07/us/patricia-mccormick-a-pioneer-in-the-bullfighting-arena-dies-at-83.html?_r=0|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=13 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bette Ford]] was the first American woman to fight on foot in the [[Plaza México]], the world's largest bullfight arena.&lt;ref&gt;Muriel Feiner, ''Women in the Bullring'' (Gainesville, University Press of Florida) 2003, {{ISBN|0813026296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, Angela Hernandez (also known as Angela Hernandez Gomez and just Angela), of Spain, won a case in the Spanish Supreme Court allowing women to be bullfighters in Spain; a prohibition against women doing so was put in place in Spain in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/pov/matador/interview.php |title=Interview &amp;#124; Ella Es el Matador (She Is the Matador) &amp;#124; POV |publisher=PBS |date= |accessdate=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Campbell Lennie|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2209&amp;dat=19731218&amp;id=ZaArAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Y_wFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4820,2694045&amp;hl=en |title=Spanish Woman Wants To Be Matador; Ires Officials |publisher=The Telegraph|date=18 December 1973|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popularity, controversy, and criticism==

===Popularity===
In Spain, opposition to bullfighting is referred to as the ''antitaurino'' movement. Supporters of a ban on bullfighting remain a minority in Spain. About 30% of Spaniards actively follow bullfighting in Spain.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Despite its slow decrease in popularity among younger generations, it remains a widespread cultural activity with millions of followers throughout the country. Polls have had mixed results over the years with wide fluctuations, although the last large poll done by the Spanish newspaper ''[[El Pais]]'' suggested only 37% of Spanish were fans of the spectacle, although other polls have also said 57% were against banning it.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Fiske-Harrison|Fiske-Harrison, Alexander]][https://thelastarena.wordpress.com/2015/02/25/bullfighting-and-the-gallup-polls-lies-damned-lies-and-statistics/ 'Bullfighting and the Gallup Polls: “Lies, damned lies, and statistics.”'] Blog: The Last Arena: In Search Of The Spanish Bullfight&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animal welfare===
[[File:Stier geveld5.jpg|thumb|Bull dying in a bullfight]]

Many people, including animal rights and [[animal welfare]] advocates, consider this a cruel, barbaric [[blood sport]] in which the bull suffers severe stress, and may ultimately end in a slow, torturous death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=League Against Cruel Sports |title=What is bullfighting? |url=http://www.league.org.uk/content.asp?CategoryID=1938 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930072409/http://www.league.org.uk/content.asp?CategoryID=1938 |archivedate=30 September 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=PETA |title=Running of the Bulls Factsheet |url=http://www.runningofthenudes.com/bullfighting_facts.asp|website=www.runningofthenudes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=www.banbloodsports.com |title=ICABS calls on Vodafone to drop bullfighting from ad |url=http://www.banbloodsports.com/ln-0807c.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=www.english.stieren.net |title=The suffering of bullfighting bulls |url=http://english.stieren.net/index.php?id=390 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126084718/http://english.stieren.net/index.php?id=390 |archivedate=26 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of animal rights and animal welfare groups undertake anti-bullfighting actions in Spain and other countries.

[[RSPCA]] assistant director for public affairs, David Bowles, said: "The RSPCA is strongly opposed to bullfighting. It is an inhumane and outdated practice that continues to lose support, including from those living in the countries where this takes place such as Spain, Portugal and France."&lt;ref name="Huffpost"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Peru running of the bulls event in Cusco leaves eight injured|publisher=The Huffington Post, UK|author=Hartley, E.|accessdate=5 April 2016|date=January 2016|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2016/01/06/peru-running-of-the-bulls-event-goes-wrong-as-eight-left-injured-_n_8920536.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bullfighting guide ''The Bulletpoint Bullfight'' warns that bullfighting is "not for the squeamish", advising spectators to "Be prepared for blood." The guide details prolonged and profuse bleeding caused by horse-mounted lancers; the charging by the bull of a blindfolded, armored horse who is "sometimes doped up, and unaware of the proximity of the bull"; the placing of barbed darts by banderilleros; followed by the matador's fatal sword thrust. The guide stresses that these procedures are a normal part of bullfighting and that death is rarely instantaneous. The guide further warns those attending bullfights to "Be prepared to witness various failed attempts at killing the animal before it lies down."&lt;ref&gt;''The Bulletpoint Bullfight'', p. 6, {{ISBN|978-1-4116-7400-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexander Fiske-Harrison]], along with other defenders of bullfighting, has argued that the fact that the bull lives three times as long as other cattle used for meat - the meat of the fighting bull also enters the food chain - and is reared wild in meadow and forest should be considered when weighing its impact on animal welfare. Also that the adrenalizing nature of the 30 minute spectacle (per bull) for the animal may arguably reduce the suffering even below that of the stress and anxiety of queuing in the abattoir.

===Funding===
[[File:Ernest Hemingway Ticket Stub for Bullfight - NARA - 192658.tif|thumb|A ticket stub from 1926]]

The question of public funding is particularly controversial in Spain, since widely disparaged claims have been made by supporters and opponents of bullfighting. According to government figures, bullfighting in Spain generates €1600&amp;nbsp;million a year and 200,000 jobs, 57,000 of which are directly linked to the industry. Furthermore, bullfighting is the cultural activity which generates the most tax revenue for the Spanish state (€45&amp;nbsp;million in [[Value added tax|VAT]] and over €12&amp;nbsp;million in social security).

Critics often claim that bullfighting is financed with public money. However, despite bullfighting involving around 25 million spectators annually, it represents just 0.01% of those state subsidies allocated to cultural activities, and always under 3% of the cultural budget of regional, provincial and local authorities. The bulk of subsidies are paid by local town halls where there is a historical tradition and support for bullfighting and related events, which are often held without charge to participants and spectators. The European Union does not subsidize bullfighting but it does subsidize cattle farming in general, which also benefits those who rear Spanish fighting bulls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.es/cultura/toros/abci-tauromaquia-industria-cultural-rentable-genera-mas-1600-millones-201603301753_noticia.html|title=La Tauromaquia, una industria cultural muy rentable que genera más de 1.600 millones al año|date=30 March 2016|publisher=|accessdate=21 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, 438 of 687 Members of the European Parliament (MEP) voted in favour of amending the 2016 E.U. budget to indicate that the "[[Common Agricultural Policy]] (CAP) appropriations or any other appropriations from the budget should not be used for the financing of lethal bullfighting activities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/10/28/bullfighting-european-parliament-votes-end-eu-subsidies-farmers_n_8412542.html|title=Bullfighting: European Parliament Votes To End EU Subsidies For Farmers Raising Bulls To Fight In Spain: Animal Rights Groups Are One Step Closer To Ending 'Barbaric' Bullfighting|first=Kathryn |last=Snowdon (reporter)|work=The Huffington Post|location=UK|date=29 October 2015|publisher=|accessdate=21 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics===
In the late 19th and early 20th century, some Spanish ''[[regeneracionismo|regeneracionista]]'' intellectuals protested against what they called the policy of ''pan y toros'' ("bread and bulls"), an analogue of Roman ''[[panem et circenses]]'' promoted by politicians to keep the populace content in its oppression. Such belief was part of the wider current of thought known as ''anti-flamenquismo'' whereby they simultaneously campaigned against the popularity of both bullfighting and flamenco music, which they believed to be "oriental" elements of Spanish culture which were responsible for Spain's backwardness as compared to the rest of Europe. During the [[Spain under Franco|Franco]] dictatorship, bullfights were supported by the state as something genuinely Spanish, as the ''fiesta nacional'', so that bullfights became associated with the regime and, for this reason, many thought they would decline after the transition to democracy, but this did not happen. The government of [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]] was the first to be more opposed to bullfighting, prohibiting children under 14 from attending and limiting or prohibiting the broadcast of bullfights on national TV, although the latter measure was reversed after his party lost the elections in 2011. Nevertheless, his party is overall not opposed to bullfighting and anti-bullfighting measures have only been passed in municipalities where it governs in coalition with the far-left party [[Podemos (Spanish political party)|Podemos]] which has taken a clearer anti-bullfighting stance. However, even Podemos leader Pablo Iglesias has recently stated that even though he is opposed to it, he would not ban bullfighting if his party came to power.

Despite its long history in Barcelona, in 2010 bullfighting was outlawed across the [[Catalonia]] region, following a campaign led by an animal rights civic platform called "Prou!" ("Enough!" in [[Catalan language|Catalan]]). Critics have argued that the ban was motivated by issues of [[Catalan separatism]] and identity politics.&lt;ref name=BBC28Jul2010/&gt; In October 2016, the Constitutional Court ruled that the regional Catalan Parliament did not have competence to ban any kinds of spectacle that are legal in Spain.

Pro-bullfighting supporters include the former Spanish Prime Minister [[Mariano Rajoy]] and his party (Partido Popular), as well as most leaders of the major left-leaning opposition [[PSOE]] Party, including former Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez and the current Presidents of Andalusia, Extremadura and Castilla–La Mancha. Nevertheless, former PSOE Prime Minister Zapatero was more lukewarm towards the Fiesta, and under his government there was a 6-year ban on live bullfights broadcast on the state-run national TV channel. This has been lifted since his government was voted out in 2011. Live bullfights are shown at the traditional 6 p.m. time on [[Televisión Española|TVE]] as of September 2012.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news

Bullfighting has been seen as intertwined with religion and religious folklore in Spain at a popular level, particularly in the areas where it is most popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sevilla.abc.es/hemeroteca/historico-30-04-2004/sevilla/Andalucia/tauromaquia-y-religion_9621233689660.html|title=Tauromaquia y religión - Andalucía - Toros - Abc.es|first=|last=ABCDESEVILA|publisher=|accessdate=21 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cetnotorolidia.es/opencms_wf/opencms/system/modules/es.jcyl.ita.site.torodelidia/elements/galleries/galeria_downloads/Reportajes/Religion_y_Toros_Web.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Bullfighting events and festivities are as a rule celebrated as a core (yet profane) element of religious festivities celebrating local patron saints, always alongside a range of other festive activities. On the other hand, the bullfighting world is also inextricably linked to religious iconography involved with religious devotion in Spain, with bullfighters seeking the protection of various virgins and often being members of religious brotherhoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://aportagayola.wordpress.com/2009/07/16/la-religion-en-el-mundo-de-los-toros/|title=LA RELIGIÓN EN EL MUNDO DE LOS TOROS|date=16 July 2009|publisher=|accessdate=21 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/25/bullfighting-spain-national-fiesta-now-divides-its-people|title=It was Spain’s ‘national fiesta’.

===Media prohibitions===
State-run Spanish [[Televisión Española|TVE]] had cancelled live coverage of bullfights in August 2007 until September 2012, claiming that the coverage was too violent for children who might be watching, and that live coverage violated a voluntary, industry-wide code attempting to limit "sequences that are particularly crude or brutal".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news1130.com/news/international/article.jsp?content=w082258A No more 'ole'?

However the station will continue to broadcast ''Tendido Cero'', a bullfighting magazine programme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.typicallyspanish.com/news/publish/article_18648.shtml TVE explains the decision not to broadcast bullfighting is a financial one] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081102065003/http://www.typicallyspanish.com/news/publish/article_18648.shtml |date=2 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Having the national Spanish TV stop broadcasting it, after 50 years of history, was considered a big step towards its abolition. Nevertheless, other regional and private channels keep broadcasting it with good audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=AFP/ |url=http://www.abc.es/hemeroteca/historico-22-08-2007/abc/Nacional/las-corridas-de-toros-corren-peligro-en-tve-_164480243859.html |title=Las corridas de toros corren peligro en TVE – Nacional – Nacional |publisher=Abc.es |date=22 August 2007 |accessdate=28 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The former Spanish Prime Minister [[Mariano Rajoy]] and his government lifted the ban on live bullfights being shown on [[Televisión Española|TVE]] and live bullfights are now shown at the traditional 6 p.m. time on [[Televisión Española|TVE]] as of September 2012.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt;

A television station in Costa Rica stopped the broadcast of bullfights in January 2008, on the grounds that they were too violent for minors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=ASANDA |url=http://www.asanda.org/index.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=646 |title=¡PROHÍBEN CORRIDAS DE TOROS PARA NIÑOS!

===Declaration as cultural patrimony===
A growing list of Spanish and South American cities and regions have started to formally declare their celebrations of bullfighting part of their protected cultural patrimony. Most of these declarations have come into place as a counter-reaction in the aftermath of the 2010 ban in Catalonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=AIT/ |url=http://tauromaquia.org/proyecto-unesco/118-continuan-de-forma-incesante-declaraciones-de-patrimonio-cultural-inmaterial-a-favor-de-los-toros.html |title=CONTINÚAN DE FORMA INCESANTE DECLARACIONES DE PATRIMONIO CULTURAL INMATERIAL A FAVOR DE LOS TOROS |publisher=tauromaquia.org |date=25 November 2011 |accessdate=4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of April 2012, the latest addition to this list is the Andalusian city of Seville.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Aplausos Magazine/ |url=http://www.aplausos.es/noticia/11153/Noticias/sevilla-blinda-toros.html |title=Sevilla blinda los toros |publisher=aplausos.es |date=1 April 2012 |accessdate=4 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402025219/http://www.aplausos.es/noticia/11153/Noticias/sevilla-blinda-toros.html |archivedate=2 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pre-20th century====
[[File:Bullring-lima.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Plaza de toros de Acho]] in [[Lima]], [[Peru]]—the oldest bullring in South America, dating back to 1766]]
In November 1567, [[Pope Pius V]] issued a [[papal bull]] titled ''De Salute Gregis'' and forbidding fighting of bulls and any other beasts as the voluntary risk to life endangered the soul of the combatants, but it was abolished eight years later by his successor, [[Pope Gregory&amp;nbsp;XIII]], at the request of King [[Philip II of Spain|Philip&amp;nbsp;II]].

Bullfighting was introduced in [[Uruguay]] in 1776 by Spain and abolished by [[Uruguayan law]] in February 1912. Bullfighting was also introduced in [[Argentina]] by Spain, but after Argentina's independence, the event drastically diminished in popularity and was abolished in 1899 under law 2786.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Veronica Cerrato |url=http://www.animanaturalis.org/p/883 |title=Desde 1899, Argentina sin Corridas de Toros // |publisher=Animanaturalis.org |date= |accessdate=28 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bullfighting was present in [[Cuba]] during its colonial period, but was abolished by the United States military under the pressure of civic associations right after the [[Spanish–American War]] in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&amp;dat=19371210&amp;id=wfUZAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=DSIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6932,286542 Cuban Senators Vote to Lift Ban on Bull Fighting], ''[[The Milwaukee Journal]]'', 10 December 1937&lt;/ref&gt; Bullfighting was also banned for a period in Mexico in 1890; consequently some Spanish bullfighters moved to the United States to transfer their skills to the American [[rodeos]].&lt;ref name="Hudson2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Simon Hudson|title=Sport and Adventure Tourism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xGo6u70tnJkC&amp;pg=PA44|accessdate=15 September 2013|year=2003|publisher=Haworth Hospitality Press|isbn=978-0-7890-1276-0|pages=44–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 18th and 19th centuries, bullfighting in Spain was banned at several occasions {{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} (for instance by [[Philip V of Spain|Philip&amp;nbsp;V]]), but always reinstituted later by other governments.

Bullfighting had some popularity in the [[Philippines during Spanish rule]], though foreign commentators derided the quality of local bulls and toreros.&lt;ref name="Wolff1961"&gt;{{cite book|author=Leon Wolff|title=Little Brown Brother: How the United States Purchased and Pacified the Philippine Islands at the Century's Turn|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hHzvx94oiUgC&amp;pg=PA22|accessdate=15 September 2013|year=1961|publisher=Wolff Productions|isbn=978-1-58288-209-3|pages=22–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stickney1899"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph L.

====20th century onwards====
Bullfighting is now banned in many countries; people taking part in such activity would be liable for terms of imprisonment for [[animal cruelty]]. "Bloodless" variations, though, are often permitted and have attracted a following in [[California]], [[Texas]], and [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work= [[Los Angeles Times]] | title = Bloodless bullfights animate California's San Joaquin Valley | url = http://travel.latimes.com/articles/la-trw-californiabullfighting29jul29  | date=26 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In southern France, however, the traditional form of the corrida still exists and it is protected by French law. However, in June 2015 the Paris Court of Appeals removed bullfighting/"la corrida" from France's cultural heritage list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thedodo.com/french-court-bullfighting-removed-cultural-heritage-list-1186121724.html|title=France Will No Longer Support 'Tradition' Of Bullfighting|first=Carole Raphaelle|last=Davis|date=10 July 2015|publisher=|accessdate=21 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/fr|title=France - UNESCO World Heritage Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|last=Centre|publisher=|accessdate=21 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanouvellerepublique.fr/France-Monde/Actualite/24-Heures/n/Contenus/Articles/2015/06/06/La-corrida-n-est-plus-inscrite-au-patrimoine-culturel-immateriel-de-la-France-2356104|title=La corrida n'est plus inscrite au patrimoine culturel immatériel de la France - 06/06/2015 - La Nouvelle République France-Monde|publisher=|accessdate=21 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it is not very popular in Texas, bloodless forms of bullfighting occur at rodeos in small Texas towns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abc13.com/archive/6200136/|title=Bullfighting is coming to Ft. Bend County|first=Laura|last=Whitley|publisher=|accessdate=21 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, the [[Canary Islands]] became the first Spanish [[Autonomous communities of Spain|Autonomous Community]] to ban bullfighting,&lt;ref name=BBC28Jul2010/&gt; when they legislated to ban spectacles that involve cruelty to animals, with the exception of [[cockfighting]], which is traditional in some towns in the Islands;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gobiernodecanarias.org/boc/1991/062/001.html |title=Canary Islands Government.

Some supporters of bullfighting and even [[Lorenzo Olarte Cullen]],&lt;ref name="El Mundo Olarte"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2010/07/28/toros/1280350886.html |title=La prohibición de la tauromaquia: un capítulo del antiespañolismo catalán |publisher=[[El Mundo (Spanish newspaper)|El Mundo]] |date=29 July 2010 |accessdate=1 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canarian head of government at the time, have argued that the fighting bull is not a "domestic animal" and hence the law does not ban bullfighting.&lt;ref name="Mundotoro Canarias"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mundotoro.com/noticia/los-toros-no-estan-prohibidos-en-canarias/79708 |title=Los toros no están prohibidos en Canarias |publisher=Mundotoro |date=30 July 2010 |accessdate=31 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100802082334/http://www.mundotoro.com/noticia/los-toros-no-estan-prohibidos-en-canarias/79708# |archive-date=2 August 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The absence of spectacles since 1984 would be due to lack of demand. In the rest of Spain, national laws against cruelty to animals have abolished most [[blood sports]], but specifically exempt bullfighting.

Several cities around the world (especially in [[Catalonia]]) have symbolically declared themselves to be [[Anti-Bullfighting City|Anti-Bullfighting Cities]], including Barcelona in 2006.

==== Galicia ====
In Galicia, bullfighting has been banned in many cities by the local governments.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} Bullfighting has never had an important following in the region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.farodevigo.es/opinion/2010/07/30/galicia-toros-mu/460200.html Galicia: de toros, ni mu] (in Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Catalonia====
{{Main|Ban on bullfighting in Catalonia}}
{{Wikinews|Bull fighting banned in Catalonia}}
On 18 December 2009, the [[parliament of Catalonia]], one of Spain's seventeen [[Autonomous communities of Spain|Autonomous Communities]], approved by majority the preparation of a [[Ban on bullfighting in Catalonia|law to ban bullfighting in Catalonia]], as a response to a popular initiative against bullfighting that gathered more than 180,000 signatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avui.cat/cat/notices/2009/12/llum_verda_a_la_supressio_de_les_corrides_de_toros_a_catalunya_81775.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091221120744/http://www.avui.cat/cat/notices/2009/12/llum_verda_a_la_supressio_de_les_corrides_de_toros_a_catalunya_81775.php |dead-url=yes |archive-date=21 December 2009 |title=Llum verda a la supressió de les corrides de toros a Catalunya |publisher=Avui.cat |date=18 December 2009 |accessdate=28 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On {{Nowrap|28 July}} 2010, with the two main parties allowing their members a [[free vote]], the ban was passed 68 to 55, with 9 abstentions. This meant Catalonia became the second [[Autonomous communities of Spain|Community]] of Spain  (first was [[Canary Islands]] in 1991), and the first on the [[Iberian Peninsula|mainland]], to ban bullfighting. The ban took effect on 1 January 2012, and affects only the one remaining functioning Catalan bullring, the [[La Monumental|Plaza de toros Monumental de Barcelona]].&lt;ref name=BBC28Jul2010&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-10784611|title=Catalonia bans bullfighting in landmark Spain vote|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|date=28 July 2010|accessdate=28 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/29/world/europe/29spain.html?ref=world |title=Spanish Region Bans Bullfighting |publisher=nytimes.com|author= Raphael Minder |date=28 July 2010 |accessdate=28 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It does not affect the ''[[correbous]]'', a traditional game of the [[Ebro]] area (south of Catalonia) where lighted flares are attached to a bull's horns. The correbous are seen mainly in the municipalities in the south of [[Tarragona]], with the exceptions of a few other towns in other provinces of Catalonia. The name ''correbous'' is essentially [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and [[Valencian]]; in other parts of Spain they have other names.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.typicallyspanish.com/news/publish/article_27265.shtml#ixzz10NKQxwpk Now Catalonia votes to protect the torture of bulls&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330053829/http://www.typicallyspanish.com/news/publish/article_27265.shtml#ixzz10NKQxwpk |date=30 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a movement to revoke the ban in the Spanish congress, citing the value of bullfighting as "cultural heritage". The proposal is backed by the majority of parliamentarians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Congreso español admite a debate corridas de toros|url=http://www.tauromaquias.com/2013/02/congreso-espanol-admite-debate-corridas.html|work=Tauro Maquais|accessdate=1 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2016 the Spanish Constitutional Court ruled that the regional Catalan Parliament has no competence to ban any kind of spectacle that is legal in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/cultura/2016/10/20/57f4cf5ee5fdea5e408b4611.html|title=El Constitucional anula la prohibición de los toros en Cataluña|publisher=|accessdate=21 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Costa Rica====
In Costa Rica the law prohibits the killing of bulls and other animals in public and private shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fuerzapublica.go.cr/wp-content/uploads/downloads/2012/09/Reglamento-Actividades-Taurinas-N%C2%B0-19183-G-S-.pdf |title=Reglamento Actividades Taurinas, No. 19183-GS |date=15 July 1968 |accessdate=23 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904005151/http://www.fuerzapublica.go.cr/wp-content/uploads/downloads/2012/09/Reglamento-Actividades-Taurinas-N%C2%B0-19183-G-S-.pdf |archivedate=4 September 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are still bullfights at the end and beginning of the year that are televised from Palmares and Zapote. Volunteers confront a bull in a ring and try to provoke him into charging and then run away. In a December 2016 survey, 46.4% of respondents wanted to outlaw bullfights while 50.1% thought they should continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nacion.com/vivir/bienestar/Toros-tica-dividen-opinion-costarricenses_0_1602239821.html|title=Mitad de los ticos está en contra de prohibir las corridas de toros|publisher=|accessdate=21 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Los Toros a la [[Tico|Tica]] as they are called does not include spears or any other device to harm the bull.

====Ecuador====
Ecuador staged bullfights to the death for over three centuries due to being a former Spanish colony. On 12 December 2010, [[Ecuador]]'s president [[Rafael Correa]] announced that in an upcoming [[referendum]], the country would be asked whether to ban bullfighting;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www4.elcomercio.com/2010-12-17/Home/Noticia-Principal/corridas-toros-referendum-%281%29.aspx "Las corridas de toros irán a referendum" by ''[[El Comercio (Ecuador)|El Comercio]]''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101220010929/http://www4.elcomercio.com/2010-12-17/Home/Noticia-Principal/corridas-toros-referendum-%281%29.aspx |date=20 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegrafo.com.ec/actualidad/noticia/archive/actualidad/2010/12/17/Correa-anuncia-consulta-popular-sobre-corridas-de-toros.aspx "Correa anuncia consulta popular sobre corridas de toros" by ''El Telegrafo'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eluniverso.com/2010/12/17/1/1355/correa-anuncia-consulta-popular-sobre-seguridad-justicia-corridas-toros.html?p=1354&amp;m=27 "Correa anuncia consulta popular sobre seguridad, justicia y corridas de toros" by ''[[El Universo]]'']&lt;/ref&gt; in the referendum, held in May 2011, the Ecuadorians agreed on banning the final killing of the bull that happens in a corrida.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/world/2011/0509/1224296491068.html | work=The Irish Times | first=Tom | last=Hennigan | title=Ecuador votes to end 500 years of bullfighting | date=9 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means the bull is no longer killed before the public, and is instead taken back inside the barn to be killed at the end of the event. The other parts of the corrida are still performed the same way as before in the cities that celebrate it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quaker-animals.co.uk/?p=2650|title=ANALYSIS OF THE ECUADOR REFERENDUM – BULLFIGHT - Quaker Concern For Animals|publisher=|accessdate=21 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This part of the referendum is applied on a regional level, meaning that in regions where the population voted against the ban, which are the same regions where bullfighting is celebrated the most, killing the animal publicly in the bullfighting plaza is still performed. The main bullfighting celebration of the country, the Fiesta Brava in Quito was still allowed to take place in December 2011 after the referendum under these new rules.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elcomercio.com/fiesta-brava/toros-quito_0_597540438.html ''Los toros en Quito 2011''].

==== Portugal ====
Bullfighting was forbidden in several areas in Portugal, such as [[Viana do Castelo]].  In 2009, the mayor has claimed the city as the first "anti-bullfighting city" in Portugal when it was forbidden the use of the bullring for those activities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://jpn.up.pt/2009/04/23/fim-das-touradas-em-viana-vale-premio-a-defensor-moura/ ''Fim das touradas em Viana vale prémio a Defensor Moura''].  jpn.up.pt 23 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

====India====
{{Main article|Jallikattu}}
{{See also|2017 pro-jallikattu protests}}
Jallikattu, a type of bull-taming or bull-riding event is practiced in the [[India]]n state of [[Tamil Nadu]]. A bull is released into a crowd of people and participants attempt to grab the bull's hump and either hold on for a determined distance, length of time, or with the goal of liberating a packet of money tied to the bull's horns. The practice was banned in 2014 by India's Supreme Court over concerns that bulls are sometimes mistreated prior to jallikattu events.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10335">{{Tort law}}

A '''civil conspiracy''' or [[collusion]] is an agreement between two or more parties to deprive a third party of legal rights or deceive a third party to obtain an illegal objective.&lt;ref name="encarta.msn.com"&gt;[http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761552634/Conspiracy.html Encarta: Conspiracy]. [https://www.webcitation.org/5kwRJht8e?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761552634/Conspiracy.html Archived] 2009-10-31.&lt;/ref&gt;
A conspiracy may also refer to a group of people who make an agreement to form a partnership in which each member becomes the agent or partner of every other member and engage in planning or agreeing to commit some act. It is not necessary that the conspirators be involved in all stages of planning or be aware of all details. Any voluntary agreement and some [[overt act]] by one conspirator in furtherance of the plan are the main elements necessary to prove a conspiracy.  A conspiracy may exist whether legal means are used to accomplish illegal results, or illegal means used to accomplish something legal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://definitions.uslegal.com/c/conspiracy/ Conspiracy Law &amp; Legal Definition]&lt;/ref&gt;  "Even when no crime is involved, a civil action for conspiracy may be brought by the persons who were damaged."&lt;ref name="encarta.msn.com"/&gt;

In the law of [[tort law|tort]], the legal elements necessary to establish a civil '''conspiracy''' are substantially the same as for establishing a [[conspiracy (criminal)|criminal conspiracy]], i.e. there is an agreement between two or more [[natural person]]s to break the law at some time in the future or to achieve a lawful aim by unlawful means. The criminal law often requires one of the conspirators to take an overt step to accomplish the illegal act to demonstrate the reality of their [[intention (criminal law)|intention]] to break the law, whereas in a civil conspiracy, an overt act towards accomplishing the wrongful goal may not be required. Etymologically, the term comes from [[Latin]] ''con-'' "with, together", and ''spirare'' "to breathe".

== Civil conspiracy in United States business litigation ==

Business litigation often involves the use of conspiracy [[lawsuit]]s against two or more [[corporation]]s. Often joined in the lawsuit as [[defendant]]s are the officers of the [[company (law)|companies]] and outside [[accountant]]s, [[Lawyer|attorneys]], and similar fiduciaries. In many states, officers and directors of a corporation cannot engage in a conspiracy with the corporation unless acting for their private benefit independent of any benefit to the corporation.

Civil conspiracy law often takes the form of [[antitrust]] lawsuits, usually litigated in [[United States district court|federal court]], where the [[plaintiff]] seeks treble [[damages]] for overpayments caused by [[price-fixing]] above the market rate. The federal [[Sherman Antitrust Act]] provides both civil and criminal penalties. Other agreements among businesses and their agents for [[group boycott]]s, to [[Monopolization|monopolize]], and to set [[Predatory pricing|predatory prices]] with intent to drive a small competitor out of business, would be actionable.

Conspiracies in violation of the federal securities laws such as the [[Securities Act of 1933]] and the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]] form another area where intense civil and criminal lawsuits occur over the existence or non-existence of an alleged conspiracy. Both the [[Securities Exchange Commission]] (SEC) and the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] bring legal actions for conspiracies to violate the securities laws. For example,a regional bank called PNC Financial Services Group Inc. through a subsidiary agreed, in June 2003, to pay $115 million in civil fines and restitution to settle the SEC's allegations of securities fraud. The subsidiary was accused of conspiracy to violate securities laws by transferring $762 million in troubled loans and investments to off-balance-sheet entities in 2001. In that case, the Justice Department deferred prosecution of PNC, citing its cooperation in a related investigation. Similarly, the civil litigation against the tobacco companies to recover health care costs, alleges a conspiracy under the [[Medical Care Recovery Act]], {{UnitedStatesCode|42|2651}}, [[et seq]]. (Count One), the Medicare Secondary Payer provisions of Subchapter 18 of the [[Social Security Act]], {{UnitedStatesCode|42|1395y}}(b)(2)(B)(ii) &amp; (iii) (Count Two), and the civil provisions of the [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations]] ("RICO"){{UnitedStatesCode|18|1961|1968}}, to deceive the American public about the health effects of [[Tobacco smoking|smoking]].

Often the modern civil law of conspiracy is described in "plain language" jury instructions. The standard [[California]] [[jury instruction]] for conspiracy is governed by Rule 2.1050 of the California Rules of Court, The new California jury instructions are designated as the “official instructions for use in the state of California.” It is not mandatory for the California judges to use them; but it is strongly encouraged. Some of the "plain language" California civil instructions about conspiracy read as follows with fictional names placed in the blanks in the jury instruction form:

=== California "Plain Language" jury instructions on conspiracy: essential factual elements ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A conspiracy is an agreement between two or more persons to commit a wrongful act.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Such an agreement may be made orally or in writing or implied by the conduct of the parties.
 &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Plaintiff Smith, Inc., claims that it was harmed by Defendant Jones Corp. for refusing to sell widgets to Plaintiff Smith, Inc. with intent to unreasonably injure competition and that Defendant Brown &amp; Associates is also liable for the harm because it was part of the conspiracy with Jones Corp. to unreasonably injure competition under the California antitrust laws.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The facts of each case can vary widely as to exact nature of the underlying scheme. In the above example, a common fact pattern could be that widgets are necessary equipment needed for Smith, Inc. to manufacture its product, and Brown &amp; Associates is a competitor of Smith, Inc.

How the conspirators entice one another into the scheme also varies with each case. One fact pattern for the above example would be Brown &amp; Associates promises Jones, Corp. (the supplier of widgets) to give Jones part of the additional profits that Brown hopes to make if Smith, Inc goes out of business because it lacks the necessary widgets.

== English law ==

The tort of conspiracy requires there to be knowledge of the relevant circumstances and of the agreement made. Thus, as a precondition to [[corporate liability]], it must be possible to [[imputation (law)|attribute]] the relevant employee's or [[agent (law)|agent's]] knowledge to the corporation. There are two possible legal approaches:
*as a matter of [[agency (law)|agency law]], the acts and omissions constituting the alleged conspiracy must have been carried out within the actual or ostensible authority of the agent; or
*as a matter of [[vicarious liability]] the acts and omissions must have been carried out in and during the course of the employment.
There is little difficulty when the claim is that the company either conspired with a second company or with at least two natural persons. The requisite knowledge can be attributed under either head as appropriate. But there is a problem under the first heading when [[fraud]] is involved because there is a clash of authority. ''[[Lloyd v Grace, Smith &amp; Co]]'' [1912] AC 716 held that a Principal may be liable where the Agent commits a fraud within actual or apparent authority, whereas in ''[[In re Hampshire Land Company]]'' [1896] 2 Ch 743, it was held that the knowledge and, sometimes, the conduct of an Agent acting fraudulently so as to cause loss to the Principal will not be imputed to the Principal. In theory, vicarious liability may be of more assistance in that it is attributing the wrong done by one (natural) person to another (fictitious) but, in ''[[Belmont Finance Corporation v Williams Furniture Ltd]]'' [1979] Ch 250, the ''Hampshire Land'' agency line of authority was preferred. Belmont, a company in liquidation, sued a number of defendants, including the majority of its own directors, for conspiracy to procure Belmont to buy shares in another company at a gross overvalue. The purpose of this plan was to fund the acquisition of shares in Belmont itself by some of the defendants. Foster J. struck out the claim on the basis that Belmont was itself a party to the conspiracy. On [[appeal]], Buckley LJ. said:
:But in my view knowledge should not be imputed to the company, for the essence of the arrangements was to deprive the company improperly of a large part of its assets. As I have said, the company was a victim of the conspiracy. I think it would be irrational to treat the directors, who were allegedly parties to the conspiracy, notionally as having transmitted this knowledge to the company.
Because Belmont could only be a party to the conspiracy if knowledge was imputed, the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] insulated it from the knowledge of its directors even though those directors, with that knowledge, made relevant decisions at board meetings and attached the company seal to the relevant documents. To that extent, liability in conspiracy is different from the standard vicarious liability situations in which, say, a company will be deemed to know that vehicles or machinery have not been properly maintained or that a service has been negligently delivered.

'''Contract law in [[Saudi Arabia]]''' is governed by the conservative [[Hanbali]] school of [[Sharia Law]], which adopts a fundamentalist and literal interpretation of the [[Quran]].&lt;ref&gt;Otto, Jan Michiel (2010). ''Sharia Incorporated: A Comparative Overview of the Legal Systems of Twelve Muslim Countries in Past and Present''. p. 167. {{ISBN|978-90-8728-057-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Any contract that is not specifically prohibited under [[Sharia]] law is legally binding, with no discrimination against foreigners or non-Muslims.

The Hanbali school is the most liberal among the four [[Sunni]] schools with respect to the freedom of persons to contract.&lt;ref name="P. Nicholas"&gt;{{Citation

 | title= Influence of Islamic Law on Contemporary Middle Eastern Legal Systems: The Formation and Binding Force of Contracts
 | journal=Columbia Journal of Transnational Law
 | volume=9 | year=1970 | pages=429
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the degree of freedom of contract is governed by the prohibitions in the Quran, and two distinctive doctrines in Sharia law: ''[[riba]]'' ([[usury]]) and ''gharar'' (speculation).

Unlike other Sharia law jurisdictions, Sharia law remains [[uncodified]] in Saudi Arabia due to the strong literalist view of the Hanbali school. There is also no established case reporting in the courts. This has led to much uncertainty and variation in court decisions. Despite being the world's 11th easiest economy to do business in, Saudi Arabia ranks 140th out of 183 economies in terms of enforcement of contracts. (see below: [[#Appendix|Appendix]])

In 2007, [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia|King Abdullah]] initiated legal reforms to modernise the courts and codify Sharia law in Saudi Arabia. The [[ulama]], the religious body, approved a codification of Sharia law in 2010, and a sourcebook of legal principles and precedents was published on January 3, 2018. (see below: [[#Legal_Reform|Legal Reform]])

==Sources of Law in Saudi Arabia==
Saudi Arabia is principally governed by [[Sharia Law]], with royal decrees playing a complementary role.

=== Four Sources of Sharia Law ===
The Hanbali school of law acknowledges the following sources of law:

[[File:Hand written Quran in Saudi Arabia.jpg|left|250px|thumb|Hand written Quran in Saudi Arabia]]
#The Quran is a sacred book which contains the divine revelations made to the Prophet by God (Allah), and is the foundation for Sharia law.&lt;ref name ="H. Patrick Glenn"&gt;{{citation|author=H. Patrick Glenn|title=Legal Traditions of the World: Sustainable Diversity in Law|location=United States.|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2007|page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the Quran does deal with legal matters, but instead, sets out the goals and aspirations of Muslims, and the general accepted conduct and way of living.
#The [[Sunnah|Sunna]] (meaning "habitual practice" or "trodden path"&lt;ref name = "Bryant W"&gt;{{Citation
 | last=Seaman | first=Bryant W
 | title=Islamic Law and Modern Government: Saudi Arabia Supplements the ''Shari'a'' to Regulate Development
 | journal=Columbia Journal of Transnational Law
 | volume=18 | year=1979–1980 | pages=413–481
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the other primary source of law. It contains the explanations of the Quran and records the sayings, deeds, and approved practices by the Prophet [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref name="Bryant W" /&gt;
#''[[Ijma]]'' (consensus) is a secondary source of law. There are however, conflicting interpretations as to the meaning of consensus. The conservative Hanbali school prevailing in Saudi Arabia asserts that a legally binding consensus only arises from agreement of the Prophet and his Companions, and not the universal agreement of Muslim authorities today.&lt;ref name="H. Patrick Glenn" /&gt;
# ''[[Qiyas]]'' (reasoning by analogy) is another secondary source of law. Forms of analytical reasoning are categorised as law.&lt;ref name="H. Patrick Glenn"/&gt;
Both ''ijmas'' and ''qiyas'' constitute ''[[fiqh]]'', Islamic jurisprudence based upon scholar opinions amassed over the years.&lt;ref name="ABA Guide"&gt;{{citation|author=Gayle E. Hanlon|chapter=International Business Negotiations in Saudi Arabia|editor=James R Silkenat, Jeffrey M. Aresty &amp; Jacqueline Klosek eds.|title=The ABA Guide to International Business Negotiations|edition=3rd|location=Chicago, Illinois|publisher=[[American Bar Association]]|year=2009|pages=851–229 of 918|isbn=978-1-60442-369-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Regulations (''lai'hah'') and Ordinances (''nizma'') ===
Ordinances (''nizam''), consisting of royal decrees which address modern legal issues and bureaucratic matters, is another source of law.&lt;ref name="ABA Guide"/&gt; These royal decrees by the King supplement ''fiqh''.&lt;ref name="ABA Guide"/&gt; Royal decrees are considered subordinate to Sharia law as only religious law is considered "law" under Sharia law.&lt;ref name="Childress"&gt;{{citation|author=Carol Lee Childress|title=Saudi-Arabian Contract Law: A Comparative Perspective|journal=St. Thomas L. F.|year=1990|page=70 of 80}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The courts will apply ''fiqh'' over ''nizam'' if the legal issue is already considered in Sharia law, or if ''nizam'' conflicts with Sharia law.&lt;ref name="Childress"/&gt;

Other forms of regulations (''lai'hah'') including Royal Orders, Council of Ministers Resolutions, Ministerial Resolutions and, Ministerial Circulars,&lt;ref name="pdf"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lw.com/upload/pubContent/_pdf/pub3507_1.pdf|title=Doing Business in Saudi Arabia|author= |date=May 2010 |work= |publisher= Latham &amp; Watkins LLP}}&lt;/ref&gt; are likewise subordinate to Sharia law.&lt;ref name="pdf" /&gt; While contract law is generally governed under Sharia law, many areas of modern business and commercial activities are not considered under Sharia law and are hence governed by the applicable regulations.&lt;ref name="International Lawyer"&gt;{{citation|author=Jeanne Asherman|title=Doing Business in Saudi Arabia: The Contemporary Application of Islamic Law|journal=International Lawyer|year=1982|pages=321–337}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Saudi Arabia also abides by international treaties, which are approved by royal decree. One such example is Royal Decree No.11, dated 16 Rajab 1414, corresponding to 30 December 1993, which declared Saudi Arabia's ascension to the New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Formation of Contract==

[[File:Types of contracts table.png|thumb|750 px|center|Types of contracts at sharia law.&lt;ref name="islamicfinance-102-110"&gt;{{citation|author=Frank E. Vogel and Samuel L. Hayes|title=Islamic Law and Finance Religion Risk and Return|publisher=Koninklijke Brill NV|year=2006|pages=102–110}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A contract of sale (''bay’'') can be concluded for the exchange of anything regarded as a commodity or property (''mal'').&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=H. Gibb and K. Kramer|title=Shorter Encyclopedia of Islam |edition=57 |date=1961}} Marriage and employment agreements are also concluded by contract.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are certain things that are not included as ''mal'' under Sharia and therefore cannot be the subject of a sale.&lt;ref name="Gibb and Kramer, p. 57"&gt;Gibb and Kramer, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; These include: pigs, alcohol, and animals not ritually slaughtered. In accordance to the [[Quran]], there are two exceptions to contract formation: the taking of interest (''riba''), and the use of speculative contracts.&lt;ref&gt;Gibb and Kramer, p. 56. The Quran also prohibits games of chance (''maisir'')&lt;/ref&gt;

The rules on conclusion of the contract of sale are stricter than the rules in most modern legal systems. Conclusion of the contract must take place at the same transaction as offer and acceptance.&lt;ref name="Gibb and Kramer, p. 57"/&gt; Furthermore, there is a right of withdrawal of the offer even after acceptance.&lt;ref name="Gibb and Kramer, p. 57"/&gt;

At [[common law]], auctions, advertisements, displays of goods on shelves, tenders and the like are treated as mere invitations to create an offer. In contrast, Sharia law recognises these as valid offers (''Ijab'') which, upon being accepted (''Qabul''), will become binding by law upon the parties involved in the transaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Mohd Ma'sum Billah|title=Applied Islamic Law of Trade and Finance, A Selection of Contemporary Practical Issues, Third Edition|publisher=[[Sweet &amp; Maxwell]] Asia|year=2007|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, a statement with the description and price of goods constitutes an offer, and a display of goods with the price similarly is an offer.&lt;ref&gt;Billah, p. 11 and 19. {{citation|author=Liaquat Ali Khan Niazi|title=Islamic Law of Contract|location=Lahore|year=1990|page=124}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, advertisers can specify that the advertisement is only an invitation to treat.&lt;ref&gt;Billah, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Offer &amp; Acceptance===
[[File:Offer Table 2.png|thumb|left|280 px|As opposed to common law, many commercial actions are offers at sharia law.&lt;ref name="Billah, pp. 10-19"&gt;Billah, pp. 10-19.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Like the common law, offer and acceptance are among the vital ingredients of a contract in Islamic law. An offer is a proposal, which leads to an agreement when there is an acceptance of the offer. If there is an acceptance, the offeror is bound by law to perform his promise. The offeror has no right to revoke his offer after its acceptance and he must be prepared to complete his promised accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Michael Furmston|title=Cheshire, Fifoot &amp; Furmston's Law of Contract, 12th Edition|location=London.|publisher=[[Butterworths]]|year=1991|page=309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A statement of an offer has to be made in the past tense (''Sighatul-Madhi'') to be constituted as a valid offer in Sharia law.&lt;ref&gt;For example the seller saying, "I sold".&lt;/ref&gt; Making the statement in past tense signifies the seller's intention of making a valid offer which is capable of being accepted by the buyer. Once the offer has been accepted, the seller has no right to revoke his offer. If he does revoke his offer, it will be considered a breach of promise on his behalf, which is a great sin in Islam as it encourages rivalry and mischief among the people.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Quran, Chapter 2:177, 61:3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike common law, Saudi Arabian law requires acceptance to be made before the parties attempting to contract physically part.&lt;ref&gt;Khadduri, The Maslaha (Public Interest) and 'Illa (Cause) in Islamic Law, 12 N.Y.U. J. Int'l. &amp; Pol. 213 (1979), p. 430&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain terms must also be stated for a Saudi Arabian contract to be enforceable. These include: the items involved, quantity, price, parties and how payment will be made.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=J. Schacht|title=An Introduction to Islamic Law 21|year=1964|page=147.}} In contracts that involve hire and lease, the period of time must be definite.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consideration===
The concept of consideration implies the bargain, or value given in return for value received. Islamic law, unlike common law, does not require consideration.&lt;ref name="Childress"/&gt; A contract in Saudi Arabia is a bond between the parties and God, hence, the element of consideration is deemed superfluous.

===Defects of Consent – Vitiating Factors===

Similar to common law, defects of consent will prevent the formation of a valid agreement.&lt;ref name="Childress"/&gt; Vitiating factors include mistake, misrepresentation, duress&lt;ref&gt;Under the Hanbali school of Sharia law, both declared and undeclared intentions of the parties must be free from duress. The key is that duress must be justified.{{Citation

and undue influence...

== Limitations on Enforceability of Contracts ==
Not all contractual arrangements are condoned in Sharia law. Unless a term is positively allowed by revelation ("in the book of God"), it is invalid.&lt;ref&gt;"Any stipulation not in the Writ of God is void [''batil'']." This is often termed the 'Barira' ''hadith''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Classical Sharia law rarely discusses the idea of contractual freedom outside the standard contract types.&lt;ref&gt;M.E. Hamid, "Islamic Law of Contract or Contracts," ''Journal of Islamic and Comparative Law'' 3:1-11.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, it provides for situation where standard contracts can be altered or combined. There are specific prohibitions raised by other ''hadiths'', some important ones prohibiting a loan and a sale, two sales in one, and a sale of what one does not have.&lt;ref&gt;"Illicit are a loan and a sale [''salay wa-bay''], or two stipulations in a sale, or sale of what you do not have.": Abu Dawud, Tirmidhi; "The Messenger of God forbade two sales in one [''bay'atayn fi bay'a'']": Ibn Hanbal, Nasa'i, Tirmidhi.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stipulations are divided into three types:&lt;ref&gt;Sanhuri, 3:134-172.&lt;/ref&gt;
{|class="wikitable"
|-
|Condition (''ta’liq'')||conditioning of contract on a future event
|-
|Concomitance (''iqtiran'')||varying the terms of the contract
|-
|Extension (''idafa'')||delaying the beginning of a contract until a future time
|}
If the court finds stipulation a void, the contract itself may or may not be void- results vary casuistically.&lt;ref&gt;Vogel and Hayes, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;
In particular, concomitant stipulations that coincide with or contradict an entailment of the contract,&lt;ref&gt;Such as, for example, a buyer paying the price and the seller transferring full title.&lt;/ref&gt; such as a stipulation that a buyer must never resell the object, are forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;Vogel and Hayes, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

Combinations of contracts conditioned on each other are open to many objections, because they confuse the price of the individual contracts and obstruct meting out fair remedies for breach, thereby opening a door to ''riba'' and ''gharar''. There are two major types of contracts that are prohibited in Islamic law: contracts involving usury or uncertainty.

===''Riba'' (Usury)===
The Quran forbids ''[[riba]]'' in the strongest terms.&lt;ref&gt;"Devour not usury [''riba''], doubled and re-doubled..." [3:130]. See also the Quran at 2:275-79 and 4:161.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Riba'' is an unjustified enrichment and the principle encompasses a total ban on the charging of interest.&lt;ref&gt;Childress, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Usurious transactions were classified into three classes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mohammed|first=Noor|title=Principles of Islamic Contract Law|journal=Journal of Law and Religion|year=1988|volume=6|issue=1|pages=119|jstor=1051062|publisher=Journal of Law and Religion, Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{|class="wikitable"
|-
|''ribaal-fadl''||unlawful excess in exchange of counter values in a contemporaneous transaction
|-
|''riba al-nasi'a''||unlawful gain by deferring the completion of exchange of counter values
|-
| ''ribaal-jahilya''||exemplified by the lender asking the borrower at maturity date if he will settle the debt or increase it by charging interest
|}

''Riba al-fadl'' and ''riba al-nasi'a'' apply to the exchange of two precious metals (gold or silver) and four commodities (wheat, barley, dates and salt), based on the Prophet's tradition. It was further extended by analogy to the products of these six articles if their present or future exchange could have the smell or taint of ''riba''. Islamic law did not permit exchange of unequal values of these articles and by analogy to a variety of their products. These articles happened to be the basic necessities of life and were a convenient means of exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;Noor Mohammed, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; Promises for future performance were forbidden if goods comprised these articles as the transactions were suspected to contain ''riba''.&lt;ref&gt;N.A. Saleh, ''Unlawful Gain &amp; Legitimate Profit in Islamic Law'', 12-13 (1986), p.14-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

The interpretation of ''riba'' has continued to be revised under the changing economic setting. By the turn of the century, the leading Islamic scholars Abduh and Rida held the view that ''riba al-Jahilya'' was forbidden but it could be deemed lawful under extreme necessity, and that ''riba al-fadl'' and ''riba al nasi'a'' are under a rebuttable presumption of prohibition.&lt;ref&gt;Saleh, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ban against interest rates has been circumvented by both parties pretending that a greater amount was lent or that the difference between loan and debt is actually a commission rate.&lt;ref&gt;N. Anderson, Law Reform in the Muslim World 6 (1976), p. 100. If the former fiction is used, the contract will reflect the greater amount, while the extra money in the second method will be looked upon as a commission.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Gharar'' (Speculation)===
Gambling is another type of transaction condemned in the Quran.
:Intoxicants, games of chance [''maysir''], [worship of] idols, and [divination by] arrows are but an abomination, Satan's handiwork...&lt;ref&gt;Quran, 5:90.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sunna takes this prohibition much further; it not only condemns gambling but also sales of ''gharar'' (peril, risk or hazard).&lt;ref&gt;The term ''gharar'' does not appear in the Quran. Etymologically related words meaning 'delusion' do appear.&lt;/ref&gt;

:The Messenger of God forbade the 'sale of the pebble' [''hasah'', sale of an object chosen or determined by the throwing of a pebble] and the sale of ''gharar''.

Besides this, other transactions which are conditioned on uncertain events are also prohibited. Lack of knowledge about the existence or nonexistence of the subject matter, or concerning its quality, quantity, or date of performance, was held to trigger ''gharar''.&lt;ref&gt;Saleh, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; The ongoing refinement of the doctrine has been narrowed down to the presence or absence of uncertainty about future performance and not to the existence or non-existence of the subject matter at the time of contract. If the nonexistent article or subject matter is certain to be delivered or performed at a future date the prohibition of ''gharar'' does not apply.&lt;ref&gt;Saleh, p. 52-78.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Remedies for Breach of Contract==
Rescission is allowed under specific circumstances, such as when the seller fails to perform; the merchandise is defective or the quantity incorrect; the quality of service inferior; or when unforeseen circumstances prevent the completion of the contract.&lt;ref&gt;N. Coulson, Commercial Law in the Gulf States 9 (1984), pp. 65-69.&lt;/ref&gt;

In accordance with Islamic law, remedies for contract are restricted to direct and actual damages.&lt;ref name="ABA Guide" /&gt; The courts will not recognize economic loss of chance, interest, potential profits and other speculative awards that would normally might be given. Specific performance and injunctive relief are likewise generally unavailable.&lt;ref&gt;Halon, p. 908.&lt;/ref&gt;

Saudi Courts also preclude consequential damages based on anticipated profits.&lt;ref name="Carl"&gt;{{citation|author=David J. Carl|title=Islamic Law in Saudi Arabia: What Foreign Attorneys Should Know|journal=George Washington Journal of International Law and Economics|year=1991–1992|pages=131–170 at 162}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, contracts involving relationships over time such as continuous supply of goods will not attract full liability if wrongfully terminated.&lt;ref name="Carl"/&gt; Courts would only award reparations for immediate damages.&lt;ref name="Carl"/&gt;

Islamic law fixes the relationship of contracting parties to any object involved in the contract as to liability for loss or damage. A party holds the object either as a 'trustee' (''amin'') or as a 'guarantor' (''damin''). A trustee is not liable at all for injury to the object, unless shown to be in breach of trust. A ''damin'', however, bears the same risk of loss as an owner. If an object is destroyed through an act of God or force majeure, the guarantor has no recourse.&lt;ref&gt;Vogel and Hayes, p. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procedures and Prerequisites of Contract Enforcement==
Enforcing of a contract consists of three main stages:
[[File:Procedure of Contract Enforcement in Saudi Arabia.jpg|300px|thumb|Procedure of Contract Enforcement]]

=== Filing and Service ===

The plaintiff is to ask the defendant for compliance with the contract before filing his summons with the court. Before admitting a plaintiff's summons, a judge will examine it for formal requirements. The summons will be then delivered to a summoning officer for service of process on defendant.&lt;ref name="Contract Enforcement"/&gt;

=== Trial and Judgment ===

The defendant files a written defense in answer to the plaintiff's claim. The judge will then set a deadline for the plaintiff to answer the defendant's answer with a written pleading. A pre-trial conference will be held where the judge will discuss procedural issues with the parties. At trial, merits of the case will be argued, and cross examination of witnesses, if any, will take place. After receiving the judgment, the plaintiff is to formally notify the defendant of the judgment. The defendant will then be given a choice to appeal before a certain deadline.&lt;ref name="Contract Enforcement"/&gt;

=== Enforcement of Judgment ===

The plaintiff approaches a court enforcement office or private bailiff to request for an enforcement order. The defendant will be requested to voluntarily comply with the judgment. For contracted debt, the judge will call for a public auction for the property to be sold after the attachment of the defendant’s movable goods. The proceeds of the public auction are distributed to various creditors according to rules of priority.&lt;ref name="Contract Enforcement"/&gt;

==Enforcement of Foreign Law Contracts==
Foreign law contracts are generally enforceable so long as they conform to Sharia law.&lt;ref name="ICLG"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iclg.co.uk/khadmin/Publications/pdf/3834.pdf|title=The International Comparative Legal Guide to: International Arbitration 2010 |author=Alan Sfeir and Joe Tirado |year=2010 |work= |publisher= Global Legal Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus contracts deemed to be usury&lt;ref name="islamicfinance-72"&gt;{{citation|author=Frank E. Vogel and Samuel L. Hayes|title=Islamic Law and Finance Religion Risk and Return|location=Netherlands.|publisher=[[Koninklijke Brill NV]]|year=2006|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; or dealing with gambling or risk&lt;ref&gt;Vogel and Hayes, pg. 87&lt;/ref&gt; would not be enforceable. Courts and judicial committees in Saudi Arabia also do not recognise the doctrine of conflict of laws.&lt;ref name="ICLG" /&gt; Hence any action based on a foreign law contract can be submitted to the courts even if there are express choice of law provisions.&lt;ref name="ICLG" /&gt;

===Enforcement of Foreign Judgments and Arbitral Awards===
The Board of Grievances, a statutory tribunal&lt;ref name="saudilegal"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saudilegal.com/saudilaw/19_law.html|title=Saudi Arabian Law Overview|author= |date=|work= |publisher= Hatem Abbas Ghazzawi &amp; Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt; separate from the Sharia courts, is empowered to hear requests for the enforcement of foreign judgments&lt;ref name="BOG"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saudiembassy.net/about/country-information/laws/Board_of_grievances_law.aspx|title=Law of the Board of Grievances, Royal Decree No. M/51, 17 Rajab 1402 [10 May 1982]|publisher=Information Office of the Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia in Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt; and arbitral awards.&lt;ref name="saudilegal"/&gt; Article 6 of the Rules of Pleadings and Procedures of the Grievances Board provides that an applicant seeking to enforce foreign judgments or arbitral awards must prove that:&lt;ref name="update"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://update.legal500.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=470&amp;Itemid=93|title=Enforcing Foreign Judgments and Foreign Arbitral Awards in Saudi Arabia|author=Alan Sfeir and Joe Tirado |date=June 2004 |work= |publisher= Legal500.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#the judgment or award is not contrary to Sharia law or public policy; and
#the applicant proves reciprocity of enforcement ''ie'' that a Saudi judgment or award would be accepted and enforced in the applicant’s country.

Firstly, the judgment or award must not be contrary to Sharia law or public policy; it must not offend the Sharia principles of ''riba'' and ''gharar''. Judgments or awards involving conventional insurance, speculative loss of chance, interest and potential profits would not be recognized.&lt;ref name="update"/&gt;

The applicant must also show that a judgment or award by the Saudi Courts would be reciprocally enforced in the applicant’s country. In the past, the Board has declined to accept a legal opinion by a foreign lawyer or a letter from the UK government stating that foreign judgments would generally be enforced in the UK.&lt;ref name="update"/&gt; This second requirement applies in the absence of any bilateral or multilateral agreement relating to the reciprocal enforcement of decisions.&lt;ref name="pdf"/&gt; Despite being a signatory to regional reciprocity agreements&lt;ref&gt;The 1983 Arab Convention on Judicial Co-operation and the 1995 Protocol on the Enforcement of Judgments Letters Rogatory, and Judicial Notices.{{cite web |url=http://www.saudilegal.com/saudilaw/19_law.html|title=Saudi Arabian Law Review|author= |date=|work= |publisher= Hatem Abbas Ghazzawi &amp; Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an international convention on the enforcement of arbitral awards,&lt;ref&gt;The United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards 1958 following the Royal Decree No.11 dated 16 Rajab 1414. {{cite web |url=http://www.lw.com/upload/pubContent/_pdf/pub3507_1.pdf|title=Doing Business in Saudi Arabia|author= |date=May 2010 |work= |publisher= Latham &amp; Watkins LLP|page= 10}}&lt;/ref&gt; the decision to enforce such foreign judgements or awards is subject to compliance with Sharia law and public policy.

==Legal Reform==
[[File:King Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz of Saudi Arabia.jpg|thumb|120 px|King Abdullah has sought to implement various legal reforms since his accession to the throne.&lt;ref name="Billah, pp. 10-19"/&gt;]]

{{main|Copyright}}
[[Copyright]] protection is available to the creators of a range of works including literary, musical, dramatic and artistic works. Recognition of [[fictional characters]] as works eligible for copyright protection has come about with the understanding that characters can be separated from the original works they were embodied in and acquire a new life by featuring in subsequent works.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Goldstein, ''Copyright: Principles, Law And Practice'' (OUP 1989)158.&lt;/ref&gt;

== United States ==
{{main|Copyright law of the United States}}

In the United States, in order to avail of copyright protection, a work must be [[Threshold of originality|original]] that is, it must involve an element of creativity,&lt;ref&gt;F''eist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Services Co.'', 499 U.S. 340, 361 (1991). &lt;/ref&gt;  and must be fixed in a tangible medium.&lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C. § 102. &lt;/ref&gt;  Further, there can be no copyright in mere ideas and facts, but only in the unique expression of the same.&lt;ref&gt;''Mannion v. Coors Brewing Co''., 377 F.Supp.2d 444 (S.D.N.Y. 2006). &lt;/ref&gt;  [[Copyright Act of 1976|US Copyright Statute of 1976]] does not explicitly mention fictional characters as subject matter of copyright, and their copyrightability is a product of common law. Historically, the Courts granted copyright protection to characters as parts of larger protected work and not as independent creations. They were regarded as ‘components in a copyrighted works’ and eligible for protection as thus. &lt;ref&gt;''Walt Disney Prods. v. Air Pirates'', 581 F.2d 751, 754 (9th Cir. 1978).&lt;/ref&gt; Recognition of characters as independent works distinct to the plot in which they were embodied came about only in 1930 in the case of [[Nichols v. Universal Pictures Corp.|Nichols v Universal Pictures]].  &lt;ref&gt;45 F.2d 119, 121, 7 USPQ 84 (2d Cir. 1930).&lt;/ref&gt;
Following this, the American judiciary has evolved two main tests to determine whether a character in a work can be eligible for copyright protection.

=== Well-delineated test ===

In ''Nichols'', the Ninth Circuit Court denied protection to the plaintiff’s characters on the grounds that they were not “distinctly delineated”, but poorly developed. The plaintiff's characters of the Jewish gentleman and the poor Irish catholic girl he loved were regarded to be no more than mere ‘prototypes’. Justice Hand held that the less developed the character, the less the copyrightability of the same. Copyright protection shall therefore be enjoyed by a character provided it is well delineated. By applying this test, copyright protection was held to subsist in the character of [[Tarzan]] because it was found to be “sufficiently delineated.” &lt;ref&gt;''Burroughs v. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc.'', 683 F.2d 610 (2d Cir. 1982).&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the character of [[Superman]] was held to found to be well delineated by virtue of embodying original literary expressions and incidents, and therefore deserving of copyright.&lt;ref&gt;''Detective Comics, Inc. v. Burns Publications'', 111 F.2d 432; 434 (2d Cir. 1940)&lt;/ref&gt;

Under this approach, a three-step test is required to be followed. Firstly, the character must possess physical and conceptual attributes. Secondly, the character must be “sufficiently delineated” to be identified as the same character across multiple occasions. He must therefore show consistent traits.  Lastly, the character must be “especially distinctive” and “contain some unique elements of expression.&lt;ref&gt;''Halicki Films, LLC v. Sanderson Sales &amp; Mktg.'', 547 F.3d 1213, 1224 (9th Cir.2008).&lt;/ref&gt; The consistency of a character's traits and attributes is considered as the key factor for  whether the character qualifies for copyright protection. &lt;ref&gt;''DC Comics v. Towle'', 989 F. Supp. 2d 948 (C.D. Cal. 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

=== Story being told test ===

The other approach propounded by the Ninth Circuit Court as laid down in ''Warner Bros. v. Columbia Broadcast Systems'' &lt;ref&gt;216 F.2d 945, 950 (9th Cir. 1954).&lt;/ref&gt; is that a character can avail of copyright protection only if it “constitutes the story being told”. In this case, the character in question- Sam Spade of the [[The Maltese Falcon (novel)|Maltese Falcon]] detective novel was held to be a “mere vehicle” for carrying the story forward, and thus no copyright protection was afforded to it. Also known as the ''Sam Spade Test'', this approach does not allow for copyrightability if the character is a “mere chessman in the game of storytelling.”&lt;br /&gt;

On the other hand, if the character is central to the story, then it will be copyrightable. In the case of ''Universal City Studios v. Kamar Industries''&lt;ref&gt;217 U.S.P.Q. (BNA) 1162 (S.D. Tex. 1982).&lt;/ref&gt; this test was applied to hold that E.T was a distinctive character around whom the story in the movie ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial|E.T the Extra Terrestrial]]'' revolved. Therefore, the copyright in E.T was held to be enjoyed by Universal Studios, and the defendants were held liable for a violation of the Studios’ copyright by the manufacturing and sale of goods under the title ‘E.T Home Phones’.

The American judiciary has followed both these tests. There have also been a number of instances where the Court has used both the tests in its analysis. For instance, in ''[[Anderson v. Stallone|Anderson v Stallone]]'',&lt;ref&gt;11 USPQ2D 1161 (C.D. Cal. 1989).&lt;/ref&gt;  it was held that the character [[Rocky Balboa|Rocky]] played by movie star [[Sylvester Stallone|Sylvestor Stallone]] in the eponymous movie franchise had come to be identified with certain physical traits and mannerisms that qualified as a well delineated character. Further, this ‘highly developed’ character was held to constitute the story being told. Similarly, the character of [[James Bond (literary character)|James Bond]] was awarded copyright protection on the grounds of being both sufficiently delineated as well as central to the story being told. &lt;ref&gt;''Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer v. American Honda'', 900 F. Supp. 1287 (C.D. Cal. 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that the character had been played by multiple actors was not held to be relevant since the characteristics associated with Bond had remain consistent across sixteen films.

=== Visual and literary characters ===

Copyright protection is available to both characters that have been solely described in writing, as well as characters depicted in a visual or graphic form.&lt;ref&gt;Amanda Schreyer, 'An Overview Of Legal Protection For Fictional Characters', 6 CYBARIS IP L. Rev. Vol. 51 (2015) available at http://open.mitchellhamline.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1043&amp;context=cybaris&lt;/ref&gt;  What is required is that the character in question possesses original or a set of distinctive traits, and visual representation is not an essential. If the literary character is not depicted in a visual form, and has only been described in writing in a few lines, then the character cannot enjoy copyright.&lt;ref&gt;''Olson v. Nat’l Broad. Co''., 855 F. 2d 1446, 1452–53 (9th Cir. 1988). &lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, where the characters, like [[Sherlock Holmes]] and [[Dr. Watson]] are found to be distinctive enough, they are held to be subject matter of copyright, even if they are merely in written form.&lt;ref&gt;''Klinger v. Conan Doyle Estate Ltd''., 755 F.3d 496, 503 (7th Cir. 2014). &lt;/ref&gt;  Copyright protection may be granted to comic characters where the physical and conceptual characteristics find unique expression in graphic from.&lt;ref&gt;''Walt Disney Productions v. Air Pirates'', F.2d 751 (9th Cir. 1978).&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;

=== Components of character’s identity ===

Copyright protection may also be afforded to the individual components of a character’s identity. For instance, copyrightability was granted to the glove worn by the protagonist in the movie ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' on the grounds that it helped identify the character, and therefore enjoyed a distinct protection separate from the character.&lt;ref&gt;''New Line Cinema v. Russ Berrie'', 161 F. Supp. 2d 293, 302 (S.D.N.Y. 2001). &lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, the superhero [[Batman]]’s car the [[Batmobile]] was held to be protectable by copyright on account of the fact that firstly it had a set of distinctive traits, and secondly these traits could be separated from the utilitarian functions of the car and be represented in pictorial, sculptural and graphic form.&lt;ref&gt;''DC Comics'' Supra 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stock characters ===

The ''[[Scènes à faire|scenes a faire]]'' doctrine holds that those scenes or aspects that are indispensable to the story or are standard expressions cannot be copyrighted.&lt;ref&gt;''Alexander v. Haley'', 460 F.Supp 40 (S.D.N.Y. 1978).&lt;/ref&gt;  This limitation also applies to fictional characters.&lt;ref&gt;''Gaiman v. McFarlane'', 360 F.3d 644, 659 (7th Cir. 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, stock characters or archetypical and hackneyed elements are disqualified from protection by virtue of the fact that they are not unique in their expression.  &lt;ref&gt; ''Suntrust Bank v. Houghton Mifflin Co.'', 268 F.3d 1257 (11th Cir. 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[Copyright infringement|Infringement]] ===

In cases of copyright infringement of a fictional character, a two-step test developed by the American Courts has to be satisfied.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth E. Spahn, 'The Legal Protection of Fictional Characters', 9 U. MIAMI ENT. &amp; SPORTS L. REV. 331 (1992) available at: http://repository.law.miami.edu/umeslr/vol9/iss2/6. &lt;/ref&gt;  Firstly, it must be established that the character in question is capable of being copyrighted. Secondly, it must be demonstrated that there has been an infringement of this unique expression. &lt;ref&gt;''Zambito v. Paramount Pictures'', 613 F.Supp. 1107, 1111-12 (E.D.N.Y. 1985), aff'd, 788 F.2d 2 (2d Cir. 1985).&lt;/ref&gt; The delineation test and the story being told tests as explained above are used to determine the copyrightability of the character, and the Court must check whether the same is precluded from being afforded protection by virtue of applicability of the scenes a faire doctrine. Following this, the actual infringement is to be decided by comparing the original and allegedly infringing work for “[[Substantial similarity|substantial similarities]]” in appearance, as well as in personality traits. &lt;ref&gt;''United Artists v. Ford Motor Co''., 483 F. Supp. 89, 91 (S.D.N.Y. 1977).&lt;/ref&gt;
 
=== Other sources of protection ===

Protection of fictional characters may also be derived from certain alternative sources in American law.&lt;br /&gt;

'''[[United States trademark law|Trademark Law:]]''' Trademark rights may be enjoyed in a fictional character and can be enforced as such. To determine the infringement of the trademark it must be shown that the fictional character has acquired a “secondary meaning”, and that there is a likelihood of confusion to be caused to the public by the defendant’s mark which is deceptively similar to the original.&lt;ref&gt;''Universal City Studios v. Nintendo Co''., 746 F.2d 112, 115 (2d Cir. 1984). &lt;/ref&gt;  Characters such as [[Mickey Mouse]] have been held to have acquired such a secondary meaning and protected under trademark law.&lt;ref&gt; ''Walt Disney'' Supra 18&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

'''[[Personality rights#U.S. states that recognize rights of publicity|Right to Publicity]]:''' This right traces its origins in the tort of [[Privacy law|privacy]] and is the right to prevent others from commercially exploiting one’s name and likeness. The portrayal of the [[Marx Brothers|Marx brothers]] as characters in a play was held to be an infringement of their right to publicity.&lt;ref&gt;''Groucho Marx Prods. v. Day and Night Co''., 523 F.Supp. 485, 492-3 (S.D.N.Y.), rev'd on other grounds, 689 F.2d 278, 287 (2d Cir. 1981).&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

'''[[Trademark dilution|Dilution:]]''' Yet another remedy with its roots in trademark law is that of dilution. Under the [[Trademark dilution|doctrine of dilution]], the plaintiff can seek relief for whittling away of the value of character. This doctrine has been applied for protection of fictional characters including that of Superman. In ''DC Comics v. Unlimited Monkey Business'', &lt;ref&gt;598 F.Supp. 110 (N.D. Ga. 1984). &lt;/ref&gt; the defendants’ costumes were found to present a likelihood of dilution of the plaintiff’s trademark in the [[Superman in film|Superman]] character. &lt;br /&gt;

'''[[Misappropriation]]:''' In order to argue for misappropriation of fictional characters, the plaintiff must demonstrate that firstly, there has been an investment of substantial amount of time and effort by him, secondly, the defendant has appropriated the product of such investment, and thirdly, such appropriation has caused loss to the plaintiff. &lt;ref&gt; ''Spahn'' Supra 24 &lt;/ref&gt; The action of taking the plaintiff’s news bulletins and selling to its competitors was held to be a case of misappropriation.&lt;ref&gt;''International News Service v. Associated Press,'' 248 U.S. 215 (1918).&lt;/ref&gt;

== India ==
{{main|Copyright law of India}}

Section 13 of the [[Copyright law of India|Indian Copyright Act, 1957]] allows for copyright in original literary, artistic, musical and dramatic works, as well as in sound recordings and cinematography films. The statute  does not recognise fictional characters as subject matter of copyright, and protection for the same is derived from judge-made law. &lt;br /&gt;

The first instance where this issue was brought into light was in the case of ''Malayala Manorama v VT Thomas''. &lt;ref&gt;AIR 1989 Ker 49.&lt;/ref&gt; The Kerala High Court held that the defendant owned the copyright in his cartoon characters that he had created before entering into the plaintiff’s employment. &lt;br /&gt;

Subsequently, the Delhi High Court in ''Raja Pocket Books v Radha Pocket Books''&lt;ref&gt;1997 (40) DRJ 791. &lt;/ref&gt; found that the plaintiff’s copyright in his comic character the herpetologist ‘Nagraj’ had been infringed by the defendant’s character ‘Nagesh’ based on the semantic and phonetic similarities in their respective characters’ names, as well as in their visual representations and conceptual characteristics.&lt;br /&gt;
 
However, the Court in ''VT Thomas'' did not discuss independent copyright in characters as this case was concerned with the issue of ownership of copyright. &lt;ref&gt;Shan Kohli, 'Can Literary Characters Be Copyrighted?: Criticism Of The “Story Being Told” Test And The Indian Status –II' SPICY IP (April 14 2016) available at https://spicyip.com/2016/04/can-literary-characters-be-copyrighted-a-reformulation-of-the-especially-distinctive-test-ii.html. &lt;/ref&gt; Further, the comparative analysis in ''Raja Pocket Books'' to arrive at a conclusion of infringement was undertaken by the Court without firstly stating that copyright subsisted in the plaintiff’s character.&lt;ref&gt;Id.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

Therefore, in India, it can be implied that copyright protection is available to fictional characters, but the judiciary is yet to lay down any criteria for availing this protection.&lt;ref&gt;Inika Charles, 'Copyright-ing Fictional Characters: Bombay HC Permits Release of ‘Rangoon’'SPICY IP (March 6 2017) https://spicyip.com/2017/03/copyright-ing-fictional-characters-bombay-hc-permits-release-of-rangoon.html. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

In India, recourse can be had to [[Indian trademark law|trademark law]] which recognises that fictional characters enjoy goodwill, and provides relief for cases of ‘character merchandising’. Character merchandising has been defined as involving the exploitation of fictional characters by licensing these fictional characters in the case of ''Star India Private'' ''Limited vs Leo Burnett (India) Private Ltd''.&lt;ref&gt;2003 (2) BomCR 655. &lt;/ref&gt;  A prerequisite for character merchandising is that the character to be merchandised must have gained some public recognition, independently of the original product in which it appears. In this case, the characters in the plaintiff’s were found not have acquired an independent recognition as a commodity, and therefore the suit for character merchandising by the defendants failed.&lt;br /&gt;

{{History of Gibraltar}}
The '''Córdoba Agreement''' was an agreement between the Governments of [[Government of Spain|Spain]], the [[Government of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] and [[Government of Gibraltar|Gibraltar]] to establish a Tripartite forum for co-operation on [[Gibraltar]]. It was signed by Spanish Foreign Minister [[Miguel Ángel Moratinos]], UK Minister for Europe [[Geoff Hoon]] and Gibraltar's [[Chief Minister of Gibraltar|Chief Minister]] [[Peter Caruana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/5355942.stm | title = Historic deal agreed on Gibraltar | accessdate = 2011-02-04 | date = 18 September 2006 | publisher = BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]].

==Background==
The agreement, signed in 2006, was the result of nearly two years of talks between the three governments, giving a voice to Gibraltar in talks between Britain and Spain for the first time. The agreement stemmed from an initiative by the incoming [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] government in 2004, which proposed a Forum of Dialogue, in which for the first time Gibraltar would take part as an independent third party.

==Key agreements==
The key agreements were:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/5357864.stm | title = Business welcomes Gibraltar deal | accessdate = 2011-02-04 | last = Atkinson | first = Simon | date = 18 September 2006 | publisher = BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Aviation: Flights between Spain and Gibraltar
* Telecommunications: Spanish recognition of Gibraltar's [[International direct dialing|IDD]] telephone code phone, lifting of [[Telecom dispute between Gibraltar and Spain|limits on dialling]] Gibraltar from Spain and mobile roaming in Spain for Gibraltar mobile phones
* Dispute over pension payments to Spaniards who once worked in Gibraltar resolved
* Spain promised to reduce its border controls and ease movement across the frontier.

The agreement established the [[Trilateral Forum of Dialogue on Gibraltar|Tripartite Forum]], providing for regular dialogue between the three parties. In July 2009, the Spanish foreign minister Miguel Ángel Moratinos attended talks in Gibraltar, the first Spanish minister to ever make an official visit to the British Overseas Territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8161061.stm | title = Spain in rare talks on Gibraltar | accessdate = 2011-02-04 | date = 21 July 2009 | publisher = BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement has not been without criticism. In Spain it has been reported as "a shameful moment in Spain's history"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8163024.stm | title = Gibraltar visit ignites press debate | accessdate = 2011-02-04 | date = 22 July 2009 | work = BBC Monitoring | publisher = BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Gibraltar talks were criticised due to Moratinos role in the controversy of [[British Gibraltar Territorial Waters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8163024.stm | title = Gibraltar visit ignites press debate | accessdate = 2011-02-04 | date = 22 July 2009 | work = BBC Monitoring | publisher = BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The forum was designed to facilitate dialogue on a number of issues, putting the sovereignty issue to one side.

An independent appraisal by Peter Gold concluded that ''"given the fundamental differences in the ultimate objectives of the Forum participants and in particular Spain's sensitivity to Gibraltar's status, the agreements may only prove to be a means of managing the Gibraltar 'problem' rather than resolving it."''&lt;ref&gt;[[#Peter_Gold_2009|Gold, 2009]], pp.&amp;nbsp;79.&lt;/ref&gt; Spain has continued to insist it will only discuss sovereignty with the United Kingdom and not as part of the Tripartite Forum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://en.mercopress.com/2011/01/02/spain-will-only-discuss-gibraltar-sovereignty-issues-with-the-uk | title = Spain will only discuss Gibraltar sovereignty issues with the UK | accessdate = 2011-02-03 | date = January 2, 2011 | work = Gibraltar Chronicle | publisher = Mercopress | quote = Spain will not discuss any issue that affects Gibraltar’ sovereignty within the context of the Trilateral Forum, Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jimenez said in an interview over the Christmas break and some its extracts collected in the Gibraltar Chronicle.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4531">'''Effluent Guidelines''' (also referred to as Effluent Limitation Guidelines (ELGs)) are U.S. national standards for wastewater discharges to surface waters and [[publicly owned treatment works]] (POTW) (also called municipal [[sewage treatment]] plants). The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) issues Effluent Guideline regulations for categories of industrial sources of [[water pollution]] under Title III of the [[Clean Water Act]] (CWA).&lt;ref&gt;United States. Clean Water Act (CWA). CWA section 301(b), {{USC|33|1311(b)}}; sec. 304(b), {{USC|33|1314(b)}}; sec. 306, {{USC|33|1316}}; sec. 307(b), {{USC|33|1317(b)}}, sec. 307(c), {{USC|33|1317(c)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The standards are technology-based, i.e. they are based on the performance of treatment and control technologies (e.g., [[Best Available Technology]]). Effluent Guidelines are not based on risk or impacts of pollutants upon receiving waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/eg/industrial-effluent-guidelines |title=Industrial Effluent Guidelines |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2018-05-04 |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regulated pollutants range from acenaphthene to zinc, with maximum allowed contamination levels in discharge water (wastewater) varying by industry. The regulations cover pollutants for which there are approved [[Water pollution#Measurement|analytical testing methods]]. EPA has published many methods in its regulations,&lt;ref&gt;EPA. "Guidelines Establishing Test Procedures for the Analysis of Pollutants." {{CodeFedReg|40|136}} ''Code of Federal Regulations.''&lt;/ref&gt; and has approved the use of other methods published by peer-reviewed sources, such as ''Standard Methods.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Baird |editor1-first=Rodger B. |editor2-last=Clesceri |editor2-first=Leonore S. |editor3-last=Eaton |editor3-first=Andrew D. |display-editors=3 |editor4-last=Rice |editor4-first=Eugene W. |year=2017 |title=Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater |edition=23rd |url=http://www.standardmethods.org |subscription=yes |location=Washington, DC |publisher=American Public Health Association |isbn=9780875532875}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early years of the program (1970s-1980s) the agency published methods for a list of 126 "priority pollutants," consisting of various [[toxicity|toxic]] pollutants. Subsequently the agency has issued methods and regulated pollutants beyond those in the initial priority list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/eg/toxic-and-priority-pollutants-under-clean-water-act |title=Toxic and Priority Pollutants Under the Clean Water Act |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2018-03-15 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/cwa-methods |title=Clean Water Act Analytical Methods |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2018-03-22 |website= |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the mid-1970s, the EPA has promulgated ELGs for 59 industrial categories, with over 450 subcategories. Effluent Guidelines currently control pollution at approximately 40,000 facilities that discharge directly to the nation's waters, 129,000 facilities that discharge to POTWs, and construction sites. The regulations annually prohibit the discharge of 700 billion pounds of pollutants into U.S. surface waters. EPA periodically reviews the existing industrial regulations and occasionally updates an existing category or adds a new category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/eg/effluent-guidelines-plan |title=Effluent Guidelines Plan |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2018-05-02 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Effluent Guidelines are implemented in water discharge permits issued to facilities through the [[Clean Water Act#NPDES permits for point sources|National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System]] (NPDES).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/eg/learn-about-effluent-guidelines |title=Learn About Effluent Guidelines |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2018-01-16 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Extraterritorial jurisdiction''' ('''ETJ''') is the legal ability of a [[government]] to exercise [[authority]] beyond its normal boundaries.

Any authority can claim ETJ over any external territory they wish. However, for the claim to be effective in the external territory (except by the exercise of force), it must be agreed either with the legal authority in the external territory, or with a legal authority that covers both territories. When unqualified, ETJ usually refers to such an agreed jurisdiction, or it will be called something like "claimed ETJ".

The phrase may also refer to a country's laws extending beyond its boundaries in the sense that they may authorise the courts of that country to enforce their jurisdiction against parties appearing before them in with respect to acts they allegedly engaged in outside that country. This does not depend on the co-operation of other countries, since the affected people are within the relevant country (or at least, in a case involving a person being tried ''[[in absentia]]'',  the case is being heard by a court of that country). For example, many countries have laws which give their criminal courts jurisdiction to try prosecutions for [[piracy]] or [[terrorism]] committed outside their national boundaries. Sometimes such laws only apply to nationals of that country, and sometimes they may apply to anyone.

==Cases of exercised jurisdiction==

===Diplomatic missions===
[[Diplomatic immunity]] of foreign embassies and consulates in host countries is governed by the [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations]] and the [[Vienna Convention on Consular Relations]].

===Military forces===
[[Status of forces agreement]]s and [[visiting forces agreement]]s are in effect in many countries that allow visiting forces to exercise jurisdiction over members of their forces that are stationed in the host country.

===Criminal law===
{{See also|Universal jurisdiction|Criminal jurisdiction|International criminal law}}

Criminal jurisdiction can be of an extraterritorial nature where:

* a nation asserts it either generally or in specific cases under its domestic law,
* a [[supranational]] authority (such as the [[United Nations Security Council]]) has created an [[international court]] to deal with a specific case (e.g. [[war crime]]s in a certain country), or
* an [[international court]] has been created under a [[treaty]] to deal with a stated area of jurisdiction.

[[Criminal code]]s in certain countries assert jurisdiction over crimes committed outside the country:

* in [[France]], the ''Code pénal'' asserts general jurisdiction over crimes by, or against, the country's citizens, no matter where they may have occurred;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCode.do;jsessionid=6D8A5BC4C46F4DE462F7C9A5BF81D0F7.tpdjo10v_2?idSectionTA=LEGISCTA000006165263&amp;cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006070719&amp;dateTexte=20060701|title = ''Code pénal'', art. 113-6 à 113-12|accessdate = 2012-08-02|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* in [[Japan]], the [[Penal Code of Japan|Penal Code]] specifies certain cases and applicable lists of crimes over which jurisdiction will be asserted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.japaneselawtranslation.go.jp/law/detail/?ft=2&amp;re=02&amp;dn=1&amp;yo=penal+code&amp;x=0&amp;y=0&amp;ky=&amp;page=1|title = ''Penal Code'', ss. 2-6|accessdate = 2012-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many countries have implemented laws which allow their nationals to be prosecuted by their courts for crimes such as [[war crimes]] and [[genocide]] even when the crime is committed extraterritorially. In addition, the  [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]] has been incorporated into domestic law in many countries to provide for the [[International Criminal Court]] to exercise jurisdiction within their borders.

===Sanctions against foreign countries===
[[Economic sanctions]] against other countries may be instituted under either domestic law or under the authority of the [[United Nations Security Council]], and their severity can include measures against foreign persons operating outside the country in question.

===Competition law===
{{See also|Competition law|United States antitrust law|European Union competition law}}

Extraterritorial jurisdiction plays a significant role in regulation of transnational [[anti-competitive practices]]. In the US, extraterritorial impacts in this field first arose from ''[[Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey v. United States]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''The Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, et al. v. The United States'', 221 U.S. 1; 31 S. Ct. 502; 55 L. Ed. 619; 1911 U.S. LEXIS 1725&lt;/ref&gt; where [[Imperial Oil]] in [[Canada]] was ordered to be divested from [[Standard Oil]]. Current practice dates from ''[[United States v. Alcoa]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Aluminium Company of America (Alcoa)'' 148 F.2d 416 (2d Cir. 1945)&lt;/ref&gt; where the ''effects doctrine''&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1099485 A. Parrish, 'The Effects Test: Extraterritoriality's Fifth Business' (2008) 61 Vand. L. Rev. 1455]&lt;/ref&gt; was introduced, allowing for jurisdiction over foreign offenders and foreign conduct, so long as the economic effects of the anticompetitive conduct are experienced on the domestic market.&lt;ref&gt;JP Griffin, ''Extraterritoriality in U.S. and EU Antitrust Enforcement'' (1999) 67 Antitrust L.J. 159&lt;/ref&gt; The effects doctrine has been gradually developed in the U.S. and then in various forms accepted in other jurisdictions. In the [[European Union|EU]] it is known as the ''implementation test''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1175003 D Geradin, M Reysen, and D Henry, Extraterritoriality, Comity and Cooperation in EC Competition Law (2008)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Extraterritorial jurisdiction in the area of [[antitrust]] faces various limitations, such as the problem of accessing foreign-based evidence,&lt;ref&gt;B Sweeney, 'Combating Foreign Anti-competitive Conduct: What Role for Extraterritorialism?' (2007) 8 Melbourne Journal of International Law 35&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the difficulties of challenged anticompetitive conduct arising from foreign state involvement.&lt;ref&gt; [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1782888 M Martyniszyn, Avoidance Techniques: State Related Defences in International Antitrust Cases (2011)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application in specific countries==

===Commonwealth of Nations===
The ability of parliaments of [[British Commonwealth|Commonwealth]] countries to legislate extraterritorially was confirmed by s. 3 of the ''[[Statute of Westminster 1931]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/22-23/4/section/3|title = s.3, ''Statute of Westminster 1931''|accessdate = 2012-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Australia]], extraterritorial jurisdiction of the state parliaments was authorized by s.2 of the ''[[Australia Act 1986]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/2/section/2|title = s.2, ''Australia Act 1986''|accessdate = 2012-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
The ''[[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]]'' asserts jurisdiction over the following offences outside [[Canada]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-3.html|title = ''Criminal Code'', RSC 1985, c C-46, s 7|accessdate = 2012-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:* on a Canadian aircraft in flight, or on any other flight which terminates in Canada, for any [[indictable offence]]
:* on any aircraft or in any airport in the world, for endangering such facilities
:* by a [[Canadian citizenship|Canadian citizen]], [[Permanent resident (Canada)|permanent resident]], or [[statelessness|stateless]] person resident in Canada, for offences relating to [[cultural property]] protected by the ''[[Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict]]''
:* against or on board a Canadian ship on the [[high seas]] or a [[fixed platform]] attached to the [[continental shelf]] of Canada, or by or against a Canadian citizen on any ship or fixed platform, or by any person who is found in Canada after such offence
:* on a Canadian ship or aircraft, relating to
::* [[hostage taking]],

::* [[terrorism financing]]
:* on the [[International Space Station]]
:* involving [[nuclear material]]
:* involving [[terrorism]]
:* [[terrorist activity]] against Canadian citizens or Canadian government missions, or intended to compel the Canadian government, or any provincial government, to do or not do a particular act
:* relating to [[sexual offence]]s against children

===Ireland===
{{Main|Extraterritorial jurisdiction in Irish law}}

=== United Kingdom ===
Under Section 72 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003, British citizens can be prosecuted for sexual offences committed against children abroad. Section 72 was used to convict paedophile Richard Huckle on 71 counts of serious sexual offences against children in Malaysia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/01/britains-worst-paedophile-who-targeted-poverty-stricken-children/|title=Britain's 'worst paedophile' Richard Huckle who targeted poverty-stricken children faces life in prison after admitting scores of offences|last=Evans|first=Martin|date=2016-06-01|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2018-09-06|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huckle is serving 22 life sentences. While no official tally is kept, seven people are believed to have been convicted under Section 72.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/video/1705530/huckle-portrait-of-a-paedophile|title=Sky News - First For Breaking News From The UK And Around The World|website=Sky News|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===

====Municipal and state law====
In the [[United States|U.S.]], many [[U.S. state|states]] have [[law]]s or even [[constitution|constitutional provision]]s which permit [[city|cities]] to make certain decisions about the land beyond the town's [[incorporation (municipal government)|incorporated]] limits.

:* Examples of states which allow cities to claim ETJ with respect to [[zoning]] or other matters, either generally or prior to [[Municipal annexation in the United States|annexation]], are:
::* [[Alaska]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/akstatutes/29/29.35./01./29.35.020.|title = Alaska Statutes - Section 29.35.020.: Extraterritorial jurisdiction|publisher = FindLaw|accessdate = 2012-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:* In [[California]], county [[Local Agency Formation Commission]]s determine [[spheres of influence]] that cities may exercise over areas outside their boundaries.

====Federal law====
The U.S. [[Title 18 of the United States Code|Criminal Code]] asserts the following items to fall within the ''special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States'', much of which is extraterritorial in nature:&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|18|7}} (subject to the provisions of any treaty or international agreement)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--US, rather than "U.S." may be preferred here, as quote of law:--&gt;
# The [[high seas]] and any other waters within the [[admiralty law|admiralty and maritime jurisdiction]] of the United States and out of the jurisdiction of any particular state, including any vessels owned by US persons that are travelling on them&lt;ref&gt;as clarified under s. 901, {{USStatute|104-132|110|1317}}: “The Congress declares that all the [[territorial waters|territorial sea]] of the United States, as defined by Presidential Proclamation 5928 of December 27, 1988, for purposes of Federal criminal jurisdiction is part of the United States, subject to its sovereignty, and is within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States for the purposes of title 18, United States Code.” &lt;/ref&gt;
# Any US vessel travelling on the [[Great Lakes]], connecting waters or the [[Saint Lawrence River]] (where that river forms part of the [[Canada–United States border]])
# Any lands reserved or acquired for the use of the United States, and under the exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction thereof
# Any island claimed under the ''[[Guano Islands Act]]''
# Any US aircraft flying over waters in the same manner as US vessels
# Any US [[spacecraft]] when in flight
# Any place outside the jurisdiction of any nation with respect to an offense by or against a national of the United States
# Any foreign vessel during a voyage having a scheduled departure from or arrival in the United States with respect to an offense committed by or against a national of the United States
# Offenses committed by or against a national of the United States in [[diplomatic mission]]s, [[consulate]]s, military and other missions, together with related residences, outside the US
# [[International Parental Kidnapping Crime Act]]

In order to deal with the issue of [[private military contractor]]s and [[private security contractor]]s being used by U.S. Government agencies overseas, the ''[[Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|18|3261}}&lt;/ref&gt; was passed by Congress to subject them to a similar manner of jurisdiction.

Certain federal property has the status of [[federal enclave]], restricting the application of state laws,&lt;ref&gt;18 U.S.C. §7(3). See [http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/eousa/foia_reading_room/usam/title9/crm01630.htm United States Department of Justice Criminal Resource Manual § 1630]&lt;/ref&gt; but that has been partially rectified by the ''[[Assimilative Crimes Act]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|18|13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, state jurisdiction is restricted on [[Tribal sovereignty in the United States|Indian lands]].

Generally, the U.S. founding fathers and early courts believed that American laws could not have jurisdiction over sovereign countries. In a 1909 [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] case, Justice [[Oliver Wendel Holmes]] introduced what came to be known as the "presumption against extraterritoriality," making explicit this judicial preference that U.S. laws not be applied to other countries. American thought about extraterritoriality has changed over the years, however. For example, the [[Alien Tort Statute]] of 1789 allows foreign citizens in the United States to bring cases before federal courts against foreign defendants for violations of the "law of nations" in foreign countries. Although this statute was ignored for many years, U.S. courts since the 1980s have interpreted it to allow foreigners to seek justice in cases of [[human-rights]] violations in foreign lands, such as in ''[[Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain]]''.&lt;ref name=cabranes&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cabranes|first1=Jose|title=Withholding Judgment: Why U.S. Courts Shouldn’t Make  Foreign Policy|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2015-08-18/withholding-judgment|publisher=Foreign Policy|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Morrison v. National Australia Bank]],'' 2010, the Supreme Court held that in interpreting a statute, the "presumption against extraterritoriality" is absolute unless the text of the statute explicitly says otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/08-1191.ZS.html ''Morrison v. National Australia Bank'' syllabus]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Economic law====
[[Economic sanctions]] with extraterritorial impact have been instituted under:

:* the ''[[Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917|Trading with the Enemy Act]]'' (as in the case of the [[United States embargo against Cuba|embargo against Cuba]])
:* the ''[[Arms Export Control Act]]'' and ''[[International Traffic in Arms Regulations]]'' (in governing the re-export of subject goods and technologies after initial export from the US)
:* the ''[[International Emergency Economic Powers Act]]'' (especially in the case of [[sanctions against Iran]])

Unlike most nations, the United States also attempts extraterritorial application of U.S. personal tax laws.  The [[Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act]] is an extension of this concept, which focuses on enforcement.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5612">The '''''Federal Reporter''''' is a [[case law]] [[reporter (law)|reporter]] in the [[United States]] that is published by [[West Publishing]] and a part of the [[National Reporter System]]. It begins with cases decided in 1880; pre-1880 cases were later retroactively compiled by West Publishing into a separate reporter, ''[[Federal Cases]]''. The third and current ''Federal Reporter'' series publishes [[court decision|decisions]] of the [[United States courts of appeals]] and the [[United States Court of Federal Claims]]; prior series had varying scopes that covered decisions of other federal courts as well. Though West is a private company that does not have a legal monopoly over the court opinions it publishes, it has so dominated the industry in the United States that legal professionals, including judges, uniformly [[case citation|cite]] to the ''Federal Reporter'' for included decisions. It is estimated that the Fourth Series of the ''Federal Reporter'' will begin sometime around 2025.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|volume=60|publisher=Ohio St. L.J.|pages=177|year=1999|title=In Defense of Unpublished Opinions|author=Martin, Boyce F. Jr.|url=http://heinonlinebackup.com/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/ohslj60&amp;section=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[United States Reports]]'' are the official law reports of the rulings, orders, case tables, and other proceedings of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]].

==Features and print format==
The ''Federal Reporter'' organizes court opinions within each volume by the date of the decision, and includes the full official text of the court's opinion. West editors add headnotes that summarize key principles of law in the cases, and Key Numbers that classify the decisions by topic within the [[West American Digest System]].

Only decisions designated by the courts as "for publication—those with full [[precedent]]ial value for which citation in court filings is permissible—are included in the ''Federal Reporter''. "Unpublished" decisions of the U.S. Courts of Appeals may be found in the ''[[Federal Appendix]]'', also published by West. New opinions are first issued by West in weekly pamphlets called "Advance Sheets", to be eventually supplanted by the final hardbound, successively numbered volumes. Three series of ''Federal Reporter'' have been published to date.

==Electronic sources==
{{wikisource}}
The ''Federal Reporter'', including its supplementary material, is also available at websites including [http://openjurist.org OpenJurist.org], on [[CD-ROM]] compilations, and on West's online legal database, [[Westlaw]]. Because individual court cases are identified by [[case citation]]s that consist of printed page and volume numbers, the electronic text of the opinions incorporates the page numbers of the printed volumes with "star pagination"  formatting—the numbers are boldfaced within brackets and with asterisks prepended (i.e.,&amp;nbsp;'''[*4]''') to stand out from the rest of the text.

Though West has [[copyright]] over its original headnotes and keynotes, the opinions themselves are [[public domain]] and accordingly may be found in other sources, chiefly [[LexisNexis#Lexis.com|Lexis]], Westlaw's competitor. Lexis also copies the star-paginated ''Federal Reporter'' numbering in their text of the opinions to allow for proper citation, a practice that was the subject of an unsuccessful copyright lawsuit by West against the [[parent company]] of Lexis.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Matthew Bender &amp; Co. v. West Publ. Co.'', 158 F.3d 693 ([[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|2d Cir.]] 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Gun laws by country}}
About 230,000 [[Firearms licence (New Zealand)|licensed firearms owners]] own and use [[New Zealand]]'s estimated 1.1 million [[firearm]]s.&lt;ref name="guncontrol.org.nz"&gt;"Kiwis go for the big guns", ''[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|Dominion Post]]'', Tuesday 7 November 2006. Quoted at [https://web.archive.org/web/20080228124201/http://www.guncontrol.org.nz/index.php?%2Farchives%2F71-Dominion-Post-Kiwis-go-for-the-big-guns.html Gun Control blog] (archive), but not available from the newspaper's website any more.&lt;/ref&gt; As in Australia, but unlike the US and Canada, '''gun laws''' usually gain the support of both major parties before they are passed. Guns are not currently a major political issue, but have been immediately after the [[Aramoana massacre]] in 1990, and the Scottish [[Dunblane massacre|Dunblane]] and Australian [[Port Arthur massacre (Australia)|Port Arthur]] massacres in 1996.

Gun licenses are issued at the discretion of the police in New Zealand provided the police consider the person to be of good standing and without criminal, psychiatric or drug issues as well as meeting other conditions such as having suitable storage facilities. To be issued, they must be issued for a valid reason, which may not include self defense, although the law does not support this restriction for ownership for self defense. Several different categories of licenses are permitted, with the lowest one permitting access to restricted semi-automatic rifles and shotguns, with limited capacity, while the higher levels which permit fully automatic weaponry and pistols are rarely issued to civilians.

Various governments, groups behind the Thorp report, and the [[New Zealand Police]]&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10579653"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10579653 |title='Sporting' guns now classified military |author=Taylor, Phil |date=20 June 2009 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=2 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; have pushed for various forms of universal firearm registration. This has currently not succeeded but current manoeuvrings by the New Zealand Police are attempting to reclassify large numbers of 'A' category firearms as 'E' category ([[military-style semi-automatic]]s), which requires them to be registered. This has been done though even by their own admission&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.police.govt.nz/events/2008/research-symposium/papers-posters/Green%20J%20-%20Arms%20control%20the%20temptation%20to%20follow%20a%20myth%20in%20regulating%20the%20use%20of%20firearms.ppt New Zealand Police firearms control presentation]{{dead link|date=July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the New Zealand Police cannot reliably register the current military-style semi-automatic (MSSA) firearms.

In March 2009 the New Zealand police bid to reclassify certain types of civilian [[semi-automatic firearm]]s was overturned by the [[New Zealand High Court]] as a result of a legal challenge mounted by the New Zealand National Shooters Association (NSA) president Richard Lincoln.

== Current firearm law ==
Gun laws in New Zealand are notably more liberal than other countries in the Pacific and focus mainly on vetting firearm owners, rather than registering firearms or banning certain types of firearms.&lt;ref&gt;From the [http://www.police.govt.nz/service/firearms/arms-code.pdf Arms Code] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070624135816/http://www.police.govt.nz/service/firearms/arms-code.pdf |date=24 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Firearms legislation is provided for in the ''Arms Act'' and its associated regulations, though stricter unofficial police and government policies also apply{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}.

=== Categories of firearms ===

Firearms in New Zealand fall into one of four categories:

* '''[[Pistol]]s''' are firearms shorter than 762&amp;nbsp;mm (30&amp;nbsp;in). 
* '''Restricted weapons''' include machine guns, selective-fire [[assault rifle]]s, [[grenade]]s and [[Shoulder-launched missile weapon|rocket launcher]]s. This category also includes some non-firearm weapons such as [[pepper spray]]. [[New Zealand Cabinet|Cabinet]] can declare things to be restricted weapons by regulation.
* '''[[Military-style semi-automatic]]s''' (MSSAs) include semi-automatic rifles and shotguns that have one or more of the following components:
** A [[Stock (firearm)|folding or telescopic butt]]
** A [[bayonet lug]]
** A military pattern free-standing [[pistol grip]]
** A [[flash suppressor]]
** A [[Magazine (firearms)|magazine]] that holds more than 7 rounds (magazines holding a maximum of 10 rounds may be modified internally to hold only 7 as per legislation) excepting rimfire, where the limit is 15 rounds per magazine.
** A detachable [[Magazine (firearms)|magazine]] that appears to hold more than 10 rounds (excepting rimfire; 15 rounds).
* '''A Category''' firearms are those that do not fall into any other category, and are the vast majority of legally-owned firearms in New Zealand, and support a surprisingly wide number of types. For example semi-automatic [[AR-15 style rifle]]s ''are'' permitted in this category provided they can only hold 7 or less rounds as well as meeting the other criteria.

Registration is not required under the law but the police carry out a regime similar to registration for all but "A Category" firearms. Firearms in any other category require a "permit to procure" before they are transferred.

===Firearm license===
{{main|Firearms licence (New Zealand)}}

Except under supervision of a licence holder, owning or using firearms requires a [[firearms licence]] from the police. The licence is normally issued under the conditions that the applicant has secure storage for firearms, attends a safety program administered by the Mountain Safety Council and passes a written safety test. The police will also interview the applicant and two referees (one must be a close relative and the other not related) to determine whether the applicant is "fit and proper" to have a firearm. The applicant's residence is also visited to check that they have appropriate storage for firearms and ammunition. Having criminal associations or a history of [[domestic violence]] almost always leads to a licence being declined.

A standard firearms licence allows the use of "A Category" firearms. To possess firearms of another category a person is required to get an endorsement to their licence. There are different endorsements for different classes of firearm but they all require a higher level of storage security, stricter vetting requirements and the applicant must have an end use for wanting the endorsement. Be it pest control for E cat, [[cowboy mounted shooting|cowboy shooting]] and [[Shooting sports#3-Gun|3-gun]] for B cat, or just wanting to collect (provided one has adequate storage security) for C cat.

Each endorsement type has additional requirements

'''B Endorsement''' – Target (competition) pistols
* Applicant must be a current financial member of a pistol club, a financial member of Pistol New Zealand (or in some cases membership of an approved club) and have attended at least 12 club shoots in the last 6 months before they can apply
* Applicant must be sponsored by their club
* The endorsement holder must attend at least 12 club activities (either at their home club or to another recognised club) in a financial year
* Normally limited to no more than 12 pistols registered to their licence
* Pistols must be of an approved sporting type i.e. barrel length of more than 10&amp;nbsp;cm (3.9&amp;nbsp;in)
* Pistols can only be carried to and from the range in a locked container with ammunition in a separate container or to a gunsmith
* Pistols may only be shot on a Police approved pistol club range.

'''C Endorsement''' – Restricted weapons

Pistols can also be held on the C endorsement instead of the B. Common special reasons include:
* Collecting (must provide evidence in the form of books, club membership, collection of A type firearms), Museum curator, Family heirlooms and Theatrical.
* C category firearms must be stored in an inoperable condition
* Can never be used with live ammunition, but blanks are allowed for movie making and re-enacting
* Can only be taken to an approved display venue, re-enactment event or to another collector for sale.

'''D Licence''' – Dealers licence

For those that make an income from firearms. To sell restricted weapons the dealer also needs to have the appropriate endorsements.
* Renewed annually
* Further security requirements
* Must maintain a record (usually a book or register) of firearm purchases and sales.

'''E Endorsement''' – Military-style semi-automatics

New class of restricted weapon that was created after the [[Aramoana massacre|Aramoana shooting spree]]. At the time anyone with an MSSA that wanted to keep it in that configuration was given a E endorsement (after going through the vetting and extra security requirements). But presently few are issued. Common reasons for wanting an E endorsement are professional pest destruction, collecting, [[Shooting sports#3-Gun|3-gun]] and service rifle shooting. Those people that did not want the extra hassle and expense of the endorsement converted their rifles into 'A' configuration by removing the components that made it an 'E'.

'''F Endorsement''' – Dealers staff licence

This class allows a person working for a dealer to demonstrate a pistol, military-style semi-automatic or a collectable weapon without having to have that class of licence. They can demonstrate one but not possess one for personal use. This is not a well known endorsement

=== Buying and selling ===

Anyone buying firearms or ammunition, whether privately or from a dealer, needs to show their firearms licence. In addition, a permit to procure must be obtained prior to the transfer of pistols, military-style semi-automatics and restricted weapons. Sales can be made by mail-order, but a police officer must sign the order form to verify that the purchaser has a firearms licence.

== History ==
===Up to 1983===
Firearms first arrived in New Zealand with European traders and were traded in large numbers to the native [[Māori people|Māori]]. This lead partly to the [[Musket Wars]] of the early 19th century. The first gun control laws were enacted in 1845, but early regulations were ineffective until the passage of the ''Arms Act'' in 1860, which required licences and registration of firearms and firearm dealers. Early laws were mainly targeted at Māori during the [[New Zealand Land Wars|land wars]] in the Waikato and Taranaki, and were largely suspended at the end of the 1880s. By about 1910 the laws were ignored and unenforced, as crime and the threat of political unrest were minimal.

Strikes in 1912 and 1913, a Communist revolution in Russia, and large numbers of ex-military guns coming into the country after [[World War I]] were used as justification for a new law in 1920. The new law required the registration of all firearms and issuance of a "permit to procure" before a firearm was transferred. Semi-automatic pistols were banned and a special permit was needed for other pistols (e.g. revolvers), with the intent of discouraging the carrying of concealed weapons. Few changes were seen for the next forty years as crime remained low and the country avoided political violence.

Increasing gun crime in the 1960s led to greater police use of registration records, which were generally inaccurate or out-of-date. A project to check the register began in 1967, and found that 66 percent of entries were inaccurate in some way, with many guns not to be found at all. Police thought that the register was largely useless, and that substantial resources would be needed to keep it up-to-date. It was believed that the government would be unlikely to provide the resources required to update the register and that it would be politically difficult to demand registration information from firearm owners. Various new laws were introduced in the 1970s and 80s, proposing more government checks, registration of shotguns (which had been abandoned) and individual licensing.

An internal police report in 1982 criticised the proposals, saying there was no evidence that registration of guns helped to solve crimes, and that registration would use time and money better spent on other police work. This policy was adopted by the government in the 1983 Act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.police.govt.nz/resources/1997/review-of-firearms-control/review-of-firearms-control-in-new-zealand.pdf Thorp, T.M.: "Review of Firearms Control in New Zealand", 1997] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414094216/http://www.police.govt.nz/resources/1997/review-of-firearms-control/review-of-firearms-control-in-new-zealand.pdf |date=14 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arms Act 1983 ===

The 1983 Arms Act abandoned registration for most long guns, as Parliament felt it was prohibitively expensive and not particularly useful. The philosophy of the new system was to control users, rather than firearms. Police were required to conduct a background check before a licence would be issued (though existing owners would be issued a licence automatically), but once a person had a licence there was no requirement to register long guns or obtain a permit-to-procure when they were sold or lent.

Special restrictions applied to restricted weapons and pistols, which needed to be registered. Self-defence was no longer a valid reason to have a pistol (although the [[Crimes Act 1961]] states a person can use "reasonable force" to defend oneself and/or one's property, and nowhere in this act states a person cannot use a firearm for such purposes, while the arms act does not mention "directly in words" one cannot use a firearm for self-defence), but the new sport of target pistol shooting has become more popular, and pistol club shooters can own pistols with a special "B" endorsement.

=== Aramoana and the 1992 amendments to the Act ===

After the [[Aramoana massacre]] in November 1990, [[John Banks (New Zealand politician)|John Banks]], the Minister for Police, announced that the [[Fourth National Government of New Zealand|government]] would ban what he and others described as "[[Rambo (film series)|Rambo]]-style" weapons and substantially tighten gun laws generally. The law was eventually passed in 1992 and required written permits to order guns or ammunition by mail order, restricted ammunition sales to firearms licence holders, added photographs to firearms licences, required licence holders to have secure storage for firearms at their homes (which would be inspected before a licence was issued), and, controversially, required all licence holders to be re-vetted for new licences, which would be valid for only 10 years.

The law also created the new category of "military-style semi-automatic", which like the [[Federal Assault Weapons Ban]] two years later in the United States, mainly covered the appearance rather than the functionality of the guns. These required a special endorsement, security and registration in the same manner as pistols, but could be used wherever A-category guns could.

=== Thorp Report 1997 to today ===

After two shootings by police in 1995, the government ordered an inquiry into police procedures for storing and using firearms. Before the review started, massacres overseas at [[Dunblane massacre|Dunblane]] and [[Port Arthur massacre (Australia)|Port Arthur]] led the government to expand the scope to gun control generally. The police reported that the system was sound and that no major changes were needed.

The government decided to order another report, this time led by former judge [[Thomas Thorp]]. The report was released in 1997 and called for many new restrictions on legal gun ownership, including banning various features, and that all guns be registered (the last particularly unpopular with firearm owners).

The National government in 1999, its last year in office, introduced an Arms Amendment (No. 2) Bill to implement the recommendations, and the bill was supported by the new Labour government. After the strong weight of submissions made against the bill when it was in select committee, the government was persuaded that the changes were unneeded and would be difficult to implement. Due to the opposition, the bill was withdrawn. The government then introduced a much reduced Arms Amendment (No. 3) Bill, which increased penalties for distribution, manufacture and use of illegal weapons. It has been in select committee since 2005, and the government has not shown any sign of proceeding with it.

In August 2009, the Police decided that any firearm, including single shot bolt action rifles, with a free-standing pistol grip that could allow the firearm to be shot inaccurately from the hip would be defined as an MSSA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/taranaki-daily-news/news/2742360/Police-warning-on-new-weapons-rules|title=Police warning on new weapons rules|publisher=Taranaki Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the High Court rejected this attempt in Lincoln v Police [2010] BCL 194; 33 TCL 11/2.

== Notable groups ==

=== Enforcement ===

The [[New Zealand Police]] administer and enforce the [[Arms Act 1983]].&lt;ref name="act"&gt;http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1983/0044/latest/DLM72622.html&lt;/ref&gt; They are issued [[Bushmaster XM-15]] semi-automatic rifles, [[Glock#9×19mm_Parabellum|Glock 17]] gen 4 pistols, and [[Taser]]s, which are normally carried in patrol cars and not on the officers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/9847010/Police-try-stronger-pepper-spray&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lobby groups ===
The New Zealand Police Association, the police union / service association, has repeatedly lobbied for greater access to firearms for police officers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/5782719/Guns-to-be-stored-in-police-cars&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/4235281/Support-strong-for-all-police-to-be-armed&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/8120686/Attacks-on-police-lead-to-call-for-arms&lt;/ref&gt; As well as stricter regulations on licensed firearm owners.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.stuff.co.nz/timaru-herald/news/94217950/police-concerned-over-gun-discoveries-following-incidents-in-south-canterbury&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.stuff.co.nz/southland-times/news/94277845/police-association-president-says-gun-laws-need-tightening&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/99636184/frustrated-at-moves-to-tighten-gun-controls-firearms-owners-are-mobilising&lt;/ref&gt;
 	
The Council of Licensed Firearms Owners (COLFO) was set up in 1996.

The Sporting Shooters Association of New Zealand is a part-time lobby group that is usually only active at elections and when there are government calls for gun control laws. It is smaller than COLFO. 

The National Shooters Association is a nationwide civilian gun owners association that took the forefront in a 2009 legal challenge against unauthorised police interference with gun regulations. Its executive is largely made up of former members of the Practical Shooting Institute, a predecessor group which had similar success bringing court action against Police interference in 1990.

The two major anti-gun groups in recent years have been the Coalition for Gun Control, and Gunsafe NZ. Neither is still active, but were led by activist Philip Alpers and Mike Meyrick, a former police officer and lawyer.&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10008083"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10008083 |title=Ex-cop 'ignored law to view child porn' |author=Boyes, Nicola |date=26 January 2005 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=2 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Positions of political parties ===

The main parties, [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]] and [[New Zealand National Party|National]], generally treat gun control as a bi-partisan issue. Both support the passage of the Arms Amendment (No. 3) Bill{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}.

The [[Outdoor Recreation New Zealand|Outdoor Recreation]] party was formed in 2001 to support hunting and sport fishing. It failed to gain any seats in 2002, and again in 2005, when, with the United Future party, it contested the election.{{fact|date=May 2017}}

The [[Green Party of New Zealand|Green Party]] supports an increase in legislative restrictions on public access to firearms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.greens.org.nz/searchdocs/other9209.html |title=Green Party Justice Policy – Gun Control |access-date=14 May 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201151709/http://www.greens.org.nz/searchdocs/other9209.html#P12 |archive-date=1 December 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greens policies include the full ban of private ownership of all semi automatic firearms and the reintroduction of a national firearms registry.&lt;ref&gt;[https://home.greens.org.nz/policy/justice]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New Zealand First]] party supports the right of New Zealanders to own and use firearms safely and responsibly for hunting, sport, pest control, target shooting, and Home Defence ([[Castle Doctrine]]). The Party does not support calls for universal gun registration, preferring the licensing of individual users. New Zealand First believes restrictions on firearms ownership by type should be dictated by functionality rather than appearance.{{fact|date=May 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15239">'''Harmon Lynn Wilfred''' is a New Zealand-based businessman. [[List of former United States citizens who relinquished their nationality|Formerly a U.S. citizen]], he emigrated to Canada and then sought asylum in New Zealand after efforts to act as a [[whistleblower]] to expose alleged corruption during the resolution of the 1980s and 1990s [[savings and loan crisis]]. Wilfred eventually [[renunciation of United States citizenship|renounced his U.S. citizenship]] in 2005, becoming [[statelessness|stateless]] as a result.

==Real estate dealings==
Wilfred's first career was as a real estate developer in the [[Denver]] area. He did well during the 1980s real estate boom&lt;ref name="RTC" /&gt;, but after the advent of the [[savings and loan crisis]] his luck took a turn for the worse. By 1990, he had sold all but one of his properties, and the tenant in that property moved out, leaving him with no income to service the $3.2 million loan on the building.&lt;ref name="RTC" /&gt; Wilfred declared personal bankruptcy&lt;ref name="RTC" /&gt;, and attempted to work with the [[Resolution Trust Corporation]] to sell the building and pay off as much of the loan as possible.&lt;ref name="RTC" /&gt; However, Wilfred states that the RTC wasted two years ignoring potential deals and then sold the building for $500,000&lt;ref name="RTC" /&gt;, less than a third of the price Wilfred said he could have obtained for the building. The private company which eventually bought the building, immediately sold it for $1.25 million.&lt;ref name="RTC" /&gt; In response, Wilfred sued RTC, and made efforts to gain [[class action]] status for his suit; he alleged that RTC's wasteful practices had cost taxpayers as much as $30 billion.&lt;ref name="RTC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DP&amp;p_theme=dp&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB1DB486C07AAC4&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|first=Steven|last=Wilmsen|title=Angry developer sues RTC for $30 billion; Wasteful, underhanded dealings alleged|work=Denver Post|date=1992-10-17|accessdate=2013-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilfred also provided accounting information which led to a criminal investigation of the [[El Paso County, Colorado|El Paso County]] Retirement Fund in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DP&amp;p_theme=dp&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EAF442B9C09DEC8&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|title=Mismanagement of El Paso retirement fund suspected|work=Denver Post|date=1994-09-24|accessdate=2013-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The District Attorney's office did not find sufficient evidence to merit the filing of charges, but did not comment on whether or not they had discovered financial mismanagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=NewsLibrary&amp;p_multi=CSGB&amp;d_place=CSGB&amp;p_theme=newslibrary2&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0F34BAA4F7368519&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|title=DA finds no wrongdoing in shopping center probe|work=The Colorado Springs Gazette|date=1994-12-09|accessdate=2013-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emigration and renunciation of citizenship==
Wilfred moved to Canada in the late 1990s, but was removed to the United States in 2000, in what he contends was an illegal extradition.&lt;ref name="UNHRC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/undocs/1638-2007.pdf|title=Communication No. 1638/2007|publisher=United Nations Human Rights Committee|date=2008-10-30|accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then moved to New Zealand in 2001 with his Canadian wife Caroline Dare-Wilfred.&lt;ref name="Stuff20110214"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/4652003/Overstayer-gets-funds|first=Martin|last=Van Beynen|title=Overstayer gets funds|work=Stuff.co.nz|date=2011-02-14|accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to [[renunciation of United States citizenship|renounce U.S. citizenship]] in 2005, becoming stateless in the process;&lt;ref name="Stuff20110214"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2005/11/10/05-22417/quarterly-publication-of-individuals-who-have-chosen-to-expatriate-as-required-by-section-6039g|author=Angie Kaminski, Internal Revenue Service|title=Quarterly Publication of Individuals, Who Have Chosen To Expatriate, as Required by Section 6039G|work=Federal Register|volume=70|number=68511|date=2005-11-10|accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; the U.S. is one of the few countries which allows its citizens abroad to renounce citizenship without having acquired the citizenship of any other country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/8549890/Officials-can-t-get-rid-of-overstayer|first=Martin|last=Van Beynen|title=Official's [sic] can't get rid of overstayer|work=Stuff.co.nz|date=2013-04-15|accessdate=2013-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immigration New Zealand reportedly looked into deporting Wilfred, but he applied for New Zealand citizenship, and argued that deporting him to the United States would be inhumane.&lt;ref name="Stuff20110214"/&gt; In 2008, he filed a complaint with the [[United Nations Human Rights Committee]] regarding alleged violations of his rights under the [[International Convention on Civil and Political Rights]] by Canada and the United States in relation to his 2000 extradition. However, the Committee could not act on his complaint: the United States was not a signatory to that Convention's [[First Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|First Optional Protocol]], which recognises the competence of the ICCPR's individual complaint mechanism, and the Committee ruled that Wilfred had not provided sufficient evidence to prove his claims against Canada.&lt;ref name="UNHRC"/&gt;

==Activities in New Zealand==

===Charitable work===
In New Zealand, Wilfred became involved in charitable work, providing vocational services for people with disabilities. He was elected chairman of Floyds Creative Arts Charitable Trust, later renamed La Famia Creative Arts; he also set up a number of other charities under the La Famia name.&lt;ref name="Stuff20110214"/&gt; Wilfred and his wife also provided financial backing to the Champion Centre, an organisation for young children with [[special needs]].&lt;ref name="Stuff20130401"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/business/8493343/Liquidation-last-straw-in-overstayers-case-Peters|first=Martin|last=Van Beynen|title=Liquidation last straw in overstayer's case - Peters|work=Stuff.co.nz|date=2013-04-01|accessdate=2013-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Wilfred's charities suffered funding issues as well as disputes with staff.&lt;ref name="Stuff20110214"/&gt; To address funding issues, Wilfred looked into pursuing private business ventures through a charitable trust model, using investment proceeds to fund La Famia's continued operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thebigidea.co.nz/news/industry-news/2010/sep/74760-business-as-usual-at-floyds-creative-arts|title=Business as usual at Floyds Creative Arts|work=Stuff.co.nz|date=2010-09-09|accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of this activity, he pressured one of the companies in which he invested, Prenzel Distilling Company, to sell off its award-winning gin and vodka brands. Wilfred stated, "Anytime you're looking at hard liquor and then looking at family values there is going to be a conflict".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/small-business/3624908/Trust-link-behind-plan-to-sell-liquor-brands|first=Ben|last=Heather|title=Trust link behind plan to sell liquor brands|work=Stuff.co.nz|date=2010-04-27|accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilfred also use to run a radio show called [[List of radio stations in Canterbury|Radio La Famia]].&lt;ref name="Stuff20111119"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/5997386/Minister-guest-of-overstayer|first=Martin|last=Van Beynen|title=Minister guest of overstayer|work=Stuff.co.nz|date=2011-11-19|accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visa difficulties===
According to an April 2013 report by ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'', Wilfred's visa to remain in New Zealand expired in 2004, and he has since been out-of-status.&lt;ref name="NZH20130413"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10877269|first=Lincoln|last=Tan|title=Illegal alien ditches US allegiance to stay in NZ|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=13 June 2013|archiveurl=https://www.pressreader.com/new-zealand/weekend-herald/20130413/281930245456893 |archivedate=29 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Carter (politician)|David Carter]] and Christchurch MP [[Nicky Wagner]], both of the [[New Zealand National Party]], were impressed with his charitable work and business investments, and wrote letters of reference for him in support of his visa applications to remain in New Zealand.&lt;ref name="Stuff20130401"/&gt; In November 2011, Associate Immigration Minister [[Kate Wilkinson (politician)|Kate Wilkinson]] appeared as a guest on his show, sparking political controversy because of media allegations that Wilfred had overstayed his visa. News coverage about Wilfred such as this resulted in a complaint to the [[New Zealand Press Council]] by Wilfred's friend and business partner Hugh Steadman; however, the Press Council did not agree with Steadman that the coverage amounted to a "campaign of vilification and harassment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presscouncil.org.nz/display_ruling.php?case_number=2250|title=Case Number: 2250|publisher=New Zealand Press Council|date=May 2012|accessdate=2013-01-23|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130205132257/http://presscouncil.org.nz/display_ruling.php?case_number=2250|archivedate=2013-02-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2013, after Wilfred's trading company La Famia No. 2 Ltd was put into [[liquidation]], [[Winston Peters]] of [[New Zealand First]] called for his deportation, citing allegations that he owed nearly NZ$300,000 to the [[Inland Revenue Department (New Zealand)|Inland Revenue Department]] in unpaid [[Goods and Services Tax (New Zealand)|GST]] and [[Pay-as-you-earn tax|PAYE payments]].&lt;ref name="Stuff20130401"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stuff20130326"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/business/8471888/Overstayer-firm-put-into-liquidation|first=Martin|last=Van Beynen|title=Overstayer firm put into liquidation|work=Stuff.co.nz|date=2013-03-26|accessdate=2013-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Immigration New Zealand served a deportation order on Wilfred in 2011, but was unable to effect deportation due to the lack of a country to which he could be deported. In July 2013, INZ spokesman Dean Blakemore stated that his department had been discussing Wilfred's situation with U.S. authorities with a view to facilitating his removal from New Zealand, but that Wilfred's "position as a stateless individual is an impediment to him being allowed entry into the US".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/8889324/Overstayer-fights-for-manor-despite-owing-rent|first=Martin|last=Van Beynen|title=Overstayer fights for manor despite owing rent|work=Stuff.co.nz|date=2013-07-08|accessdate=2013-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2013, the [[Office of the Ombudsman (New Zealand)|New Zealand Office of the Ombudsman]] began an investigation into the [[Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment]], the ministry which oversees INZ, regarding its refusal to refer Wilfred's application for New Zealand citizenship to the [[Department of Internal Affairs (New Zealand)|Ministry of Internal Affairs]]. Two immigration lawyers expressed consternation at the Ombudsman's investigation, and suggested that INZ's inability to deport people who become stateless after renouncing foreign citizenships or to block their applications for New Zealand citizenship was a "loophole" presenting problems for enforcement actions against people lacking legal immigration status. In response to the news, immigration compliance officer Natalie Gardiner stated that INZ's position was that Wilfred "should leave the country as soon as possible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10912915|first=Lincoln|last=Tan|title=Probe into deportation decision: Immigration lawyers say Ombudsman's investigation could open floodgates for overstayers to gain residency|work=The New Zealand Herald|date=16 August 2013|archiveurl=https://www.pressreader.com/new-zealand/the-new-zealand-herald/20130816/281822871442601|archivedate=29 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; By March 2014, Gardiner stated that INZ remained unable to reach an agreement for the [[Embassy of the United States, Wellington|United States Embassy]] to issue a [[travel document]] to Wilfred, so he could be deported to the United States, despite the request of INZ Minister [[Michael Woodhouse]] that the U.S. government reconsider its position on the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/9807400/The-illegal-alien-no-one-wants|first=Martin|last=Van Beynen|title=The illegal 'alien' no one wants|work=Stuff.co.nz|date=2014-03-09|accessdate=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; His wife Caroline flew to Canada in September 2015 and subsequently had her New Zealand visa waiver revoked, effectively denying her re-entry to the country.

==Personal life==
Wilfred has been married three times, most recently to Caroline Dare-Wilfred of Canada, whose family runs the [[Dare Foods]] Group of [[Ontario]].&lt;ref name="Stuff20130326"/&gt; Dare-Wilfred's marriage to him created tensions with her relatives, which eventually led her to attempt to sell her 27% stake in the Dare Foods Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.campdenfb.com/article/fifth-gen-plans-sale-dare-foods-stake-due-family-feud|first=Jessica|last=Tasman-Jones|title=Fifth gen plans sale of Dare Foods stake due to family feud|work=Campden FB|date=2014-05-20|accessdate=2014-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has three children in the U.S. from his previous two marriages.&lt;ref name="Stuff20110214"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9172">The '''history of bankruptcy law in the United States''' refers primarily to a series of acts of [[The United States Congress|Congress]] regarding the nature of  [[bankruptcy]]. As the legal regime for [[bankruptcy in the United States]] developed, it moved from a system which viewed bankruptcy as a quasi-criminal act, to one focused on solving and repaying debts for people and businesses suffering heavy losses.

==Pre-Independence==
{{main|History of bankruptcy law}}
In the [[Thirteen Colonies]], laws regarding the payment and collection of debt were based on [[English law|English common law]]. Debtors who were unable to repay their debts had property confiscated and assigned to the creditor, or were imprisoned.&lt;ref&gt;Noel 1919, 35-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eighteenth and nineteenth centuries==
Upon the ratification of the [[United States Constitution]] in 1789, Congress was given the power under [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 8: Powers of Congress|Article I, Section 8, Clause 4]] to legislate for "uniform laws on the subject of Bankruptcies" throughout the United States. Congress' first law on the subject was the [[Bankruptcy Act of 1800]],&lt;ref&gt;Ch. 19, 2 Stat. 19 (repealed by Ch. 6, 2 Stat. 248).  See David A. Skeel, Jr., Bankruptcy Lawyers and the Shape of American Bankruptcy Law, 67 Fordham L.R. 497.&lt;/ref&gt; which was limited to traders and provided only for involuntary proceedings. This was repealed in 1803. [[Edmund Roberts (diplomat)|Diplomatist Edmund Roberts]], President [[Andrew Jackson]]'s envoy to the [[Far East]], incorporated American concepts of bankruptcy protection into Article VI of the [[Siamese-American Treaty of Amity and Commerce|Roberts Treaty with Siam]] of 1833.
Voluntary bankruptcy in the United States was first allowed by the Acts of 1841,&lt;ref&gt;Act of Aug. 19, 1841, section 1, 5 Stat. 440&lt;/ref&gt; and 1867.&lt;ref&gt;Act of Mar. 2, 1867, section 11, 14 Stat. 521, amended in 1874, 18 Stat. 182 and repealed in 1878.&lt;/ref&gt; These early acts and the [[Bankruptcy Act of 1898]], known as the Nelson Act,&lt;ref&gt;Act of July 1, 1898, ch. 541, 30 Stat. 544.&lt;/ref&gt; established the modern concepts of debtor-creditor relations.

==Twentieth century==
The [[Bankruptcy Act of 1938]], known as the [[Chandler Act]] expanded voluntary access to the bankruptcy system, and voluntary petitions were made more attractive to debtors. The Chandler Act gave authority to the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] in the administration of bankruptcy filings.

The [[Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978]], commonly referred to as the Bankruptcy Code, constituted a major overhaul of the bankruptcy system.  First, it covered cases filed after October 1, 1979. Second, the 1978 Act contained four titles. Title I was the amended Title 11 of the U.S. Code. Title II contained amendments to Title 28 of the U.S. Code and the Federal Rules of Evidence. Title III made the necessary changes in other federal legislation affected by the bankruptcy law changes. Title IV provided for the repeal of pre-Code bankruptcy, the effective dates of portions of the new law, necessary savings provisions, interim housekeeping details, and the [[pilot program]] of the United States trustee.

Perhaps the most important changes to bankruptcy law under the 1978 Act, however, were to the courts themselves.  The 1978 Act drastically altered the structure of the bankruptcy courts and conferred pervasive subject matter [[jurisdiction]] upon the courts.  The act granted the new jurisdiction over all "civil proceedings arising under title 11 or arising in or related to cases under title 11."  28 U.S.C. §1471(b) (1976 ed. Supp.) While the new courts were denominated adjuncts of the [[district court]], they were in practice free standing courts.  The expanded jurisdiction was to be exercised primarily by bankruptcy judges.  The bankruptcy judge would continue to be an Article I judge, who was appointed for a set term.

The provisions of the 1978 Act came under scrutiny in the case of ''[[Northern Pipeline Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co.]]'', 458 U.S. 50, 102 S. Ct. 2858, 73 L. Ed.2d 598 [6 C.B.C.2d 785] (1982). The Court held unconstitutional the broad grant of jurisdiction to bankruptcy judges because those judges were not appointed under and protected by the provisions of [[Article III of the United States Constitution|Article III of the Constitution]]. Under the United States Constitution, the Article III judges hold their offices during good behavior (an appointment for life), and their [[salary]] cannot be reduced during their tenure in office. Article I judges do not enjoy such rights. The jurisdictional challenge started when a creditor filed an [[Adversary proceeding in bankruptcy (USA)|adversary proceeding]] in [[bankruptcy court]], which covered issues such as [[breach of contract]], [[warranty]], and [[misrepresentation]]. The bankruptcy court denied the [[defendant]]'s [[motion to dismiss]], and the defendant appealed to the District Court.  The District Court held that 28 U.S.C. §1471 violated Article III of the Constitution because it delegated Article III powers to a non-Article III Court by its broad grant of jurisdiction to the bankruptcy courts.  In a [[plurality opinion]], the Supreme Court held that the broad grant of jurisdiction accorded bankruptcy courts by 28 U.S.C. '1471 was an unconstitutional delegation of Article III powers to a non-Article III Court.  Similarly, Section 241(a) of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, by establishing the jurisdictional provisions set forth in 28 U.S.C. '1471 was held unconstitutional. The Court stayed its judgment until October 4, 1982, to give "Congress an opportunity to reconstitute the bankruptcy courts or to adopt other valid means of adjudication, without impairing the interim administration of the bankruptcy laws."  Id. 458 U.S. at 89. After the stay had expired, Congress still failed to act. Instead, a model "[[Emergency rule|Emergency Rule]]" was adopted as a local rule by the district courts.  The purpose of the rule was to avoid the collapse of the bankruptcy system, and it was a temporary measure to provide for the orderly administration of bankruptcy cases and proceedings after Marathon.  The rule remained in effect until enactment of the 1984 legislation on July 10, 1984.  Although the [[constitutionality]] of the "Emergency Rule" was under constant attack, the Supreme Court consistently denied [[certiorari]].

In 1984, Congress implemented a "permanent" legislative solution to the issues addressed in ''Marathon'' by enacting the [[Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship Act of 1984]]. By this act, with few exceptions, such as the trial of personal injury and wrongful death claims and matters that require consideration of both Title 11 and organizations or activities affecting [[interstate commerce]], the new bankruptcy courts were allowed to exercise all of the subject matter jurisdiction of the district courts.  Thus, bankruptcy courts were allowed to hear cases such as ''Marathon''.

The Act of 1984 in many ways resembled the Bankruptcy Act of 1898.  Among other things, the law provided for the [[re-designation]] of separate units for bankruptcy judges under the district court system.  Bankruptcy cases pending on or filed after July 10, 1984, are subject to most of the [[Law|amendments]] relating to bankruptcy jurisdiction. The Bankruptcy Judges, United States Trustees, and Family Farmer Bankruptcy Act of 1986 made substantive changes relating to [[family farm]]ers and established a permanent United States trustee system.  The 1986 Act applies to cases filed since November 26, 1986. The Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994 is effective as to cases filed on or after October 22, 1994.  The reform act and the [[case law]] interpreting its provisions have a great impact upon the [[mortgage bank]]ing industry and the servicers of [[mortgage loan]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44011">The '''Japanese succession controversy''' refers to desires to change the [[Order of succession|laws of succession]] to the [[Chrysanthemum Throne]], which is currently limited to [[male]]s of the [[Imperial House of Japan|Japanese Imperial Family]].

== Overview ==
Traditionally, the imperial throne was passed on under custom which resembled the rule of [[agnatic seniority]]. Theoretically, any male or female with [[patrilineality|patrilineal]] lineage to early Japanese monarchs, who descended in direct male line from the first emperor, [[Emperor Jimmu|Jimmu]], could come to hold the throne. In practice, preference was given to first-born male offspring of a preceding male monarch, followed by his brothers, sons and other males of the immediate male-line family; and ultimately followed by representatives of [[Shinnōke]] houses, in other words, male-line relatives, occasionally very distant male cousins.

Because there existed no restrictions on remarriage or [[polygyny]] in historical Japan, there existed usually many male relatives who could take over the throne. However, there are several historical instances of women holding the throne. An empress's offspring does not have claim to the throne from the said maternal lineage, so assigning a female to the throne had the convenient effect of postponing succession disputes.

On other occasions, the direct male heir was yet a toddler and unable to perform imperial rituals. In such instance, his mother, aunt or elder sister, if also held Imperial lineage through her patriline, temporarily took over the throne until the child came to puberty, which was deemed sufficient for a boy's accession.

After the [[Meiji Restoration]], Japan imported the [[Prussia]]n model of imperial succession, in which princesses were explicitly excluded from succession. More significantly, as a part of the effort to westernise and modernise Japan, the Japanese government banned polygamy, which was previously allowed to any family with noble rank (samurai or kuge), particularly if the first wife could not produce male offspring. After World War II, a further restriction was instituted. New rules meant that only the closest relatives of the then emperor Hirohito (children and descendants, siblings and their descendants) could be part of the official Imperial family, and have a claim to succession.

The current emperor, [[Akihito]], has two sons: [[Naruhito, Crown Prince of Japan|Crown Prince Naruhito]] and [[Fumihito, Prince Akishino|Prince Akishino]]; Prince Akishino is the father of the Emperor's only grandson, [[Prince Hisahito of Akishino|Prince Hisahito]]. The Emperor's brother [[Masahito, Prince Hitachi|Prince Hitachi]] has no children. The Emperor's late uncle [[Takahito, Prince Mikasa|Prince Mikasa]] has no male-line grandsons.

Controversy exists as to what extent the current rule of succession under ''[[Imperial Household Act|the Imperial Household Act of 1947]]'' should be changed. Those on the Right advocate a change, holding the Prussian-style agnatic primogeniture, but bringing back the previously excluded male relatives into the Imperial household. Liberals advocate the adoption of [[absolute primogeniture]]. Moderates advocate re-adoption of earlier, indigenous customs of succession, that is, that a female can succeed to the throne as long as she holds precedence in seniority or proximity within the patrilineal kinship. [[Kikuko, Princess Takamatsu|Princess Takamatsu]], the last surviving [[Arisugawa]]-Takamatsu and aunt to the current Emperor, advocated the traditional, customary rights of female princesses to succession, in her media interviews and articles, after the birth of [[Aiko, Princess Toshi|Princess Aiko]].

Adoption of absolute primogeniture would permit, as has happened in history, unmarried or widowed female descendants in the male line of the Imperial House to inherit the [[Chrysanthemum Throne]], but would also allow something unprecedented: it would allow married princesses and princesses' children whose fathers are not descendants in the male line of the earlier emperors, to ascend the throne. This scenario could be interpreted as meaning a new dynasty would take over the Chrysanthemum Throne, since dynasties are traditionally defined patrilineally.  However, there is modern precedent for the children of a reigning queen to be considered as continuing her dynasty and not that of their father, including the Dutch [[House of Orange]].

== Historical background ==

=== Ruling Empresses in Japanese history ===

Eight women have served as ''tennō'', ''i.e.'' reigning [[Empress of Japan|empress]]es, during the recorded history of Japan on ten occasions. Two of those empresses have, after abdicating, reascended the throne under different names. The last time Japan had a reigning Empress was in 1771, when [[Empress Go-Sakuramachi]] abdicated in favor of her nephew, [[Emperor Go-Momozono]].

The ruling empresses have been:
* Nukatabe, [[Empress Suiko]] (推古天皇 Suiko Tennō) was the 33rd [[Emperor of Japan|empress of Japan]] from 593 until 628, according to the traditional order of succession, and the first historically attested woman to hold this position. She was the granddaughter of [[Tashiraga of Yamato]], herself sister of the childless [[Emperor Buretsu]], transferring some legitimacy in succession to the throne of [[Yamato period|Yamato]] to her husband [[Emperor Keitai]]. Tashiraga's mother had been [[Kasuga of Yamato]], sister of the childless [[Emperor Seinei]], whose own marriage with the future [[Emperor Ninken]] had a similar effect a generation earlier.  According to legends, these ladies descended from the legendary [[Empress Jingū]], who had been ruler (since Meiji-era rewrites of history, Regent) of [[Yamato Province|Yamato]] for decades at some time in the past, probably in the mid-4th century (if she really existed), and who herself descended, according to legends, from [[Amaterasu]] omikami, the Sun Goddess of the Japanese pantheon.
* Takara, [[Empress Kōgyoku]] (皇極天皇 Kōgyoku Tennō), also Empress Saimei (斉明天皇 Saimei Tennō) was the 35th and 37th [[Emperor of Japan|empress of Japan]], initially from February 18, 642, to July 12, 645, ascending upon the death of her uncle [[Emperor Jomei]] (who had also been her second husband). When she abdicated, her own younger brother succeeded her. However, upon the death of the said younger brother, she reascended the throne as [[Empress Saimei]] on February 14, 655, and ruled until her death on August 24, 661. She was succeeded by her and Emperor Jomei's son, Naka no Ōe, as [[Emperor Tenji]].
* Unonosasara, [[Empress Jitō]] (持統天皇 Jitō Tennō) was the 41st imperial ruler of Japan, and ruled from 686 until 697. The previous emperor was her uncle and husband, [[Emperor Tenmu]], and she later abdicated the throne to her grandson [[Emperor Monmu]].
* Ahe, [[Empress Genmei]] (also Empress Genmyō; 元明天皇 Genmei Tennō) was the 43rd imperial ruler of Japan ruling 707–715 (died December 7, 721). She was Empress Jitō's younger half-sister and the mother of [[Emperor Monmu]], who died in an young age.
* Hitaka, [[Empress Genshō]] (元正天皇 Genshō Tennō) was the 44th monarch of Japan (715–724). She succeeded after her mother Empress Genmei and later abdicated to her nephew [[Emperor Shōmu]], son of Emperor Monmu.
* Abe, [[Empress Kōken]] (孝謙天皇 Kōken Tennō) also Empress Shōtoku (称徳天皇 Shōtoku Tennō) was the 46th imperial ruler of Japan from 749 to 758, and the 48th from 764 to 770. Her posthumous name for her second reign (764–770) was [[Empress Shōtoku]]. She never married and her ex-crown prince was [[:ja:道祖王|Prince Bunado]], her first cousin twice removed, but after her death, another of her cousins ascended the throne as [[Emperor Kanmu]], who was also her brother-in-law.
* Okiko, [[Empress Meishō]] (明正天皇 Meishō Tennō) was the 109th [[Emperor of Japan|empress of Japan]], reigning from December 22, 1629, to November 14, 1643. She ascended upon the abdication of her father, being the eldest surviving child of her parents (the empress, [[Tokugawa Masako]], had only four daughters without surviving sons), holding priority over her younger half-brothers.
* Toshiko, [[Empress Go-Sakuramachi]] (後桜町天皇 Go-Sakuramachi Tennō) was the 117th [[Emperor of Japan|empress of Japan]], and ruled from September 15, 1762, to January 9, 1771. She abdicated in favor of her young nephew. Surviving over forty years, the retired Empress held all those decades the position of Dajo Tenno, and acted as sort of guardian of subsequent emperors.

=== Post Meiji-era laws ===

{{see also|Emperor of Japan#Succession}}

Women were barred from the throne for the first time in 1889 by a [[Prussia]]n-influenced constitution during the 19th century [[Meiji Restoration]]. This prohibition was continued by the [[Imperial Household Act]] of 1947, enacted under Japan's post-[[World War II]] constitution during the American occupation.  More importantly, as a part of reforming Japan, Japan introduced a ban on [[polygyny]] and the Meiji Emperor was the last to have an official secondary consort.

The 1947 law further restricts the succession to legitimate male descendants in the male line of [[Emperor Taishō]] only (excluding other male lines of the imperial dynasty, such as Fushimi, Higashikuni, Kitashirakawa, etc.), and specifically bars the emperor and other members of the imperial family from adopting children. During the recent controversy over the succession, commentators suggested that the current system could not possibly function in the long term as it is unlikely that there will always be a male heir to succeed to the throne.

[[Naruhito, Crown Prince of Japan|Crown Prince Naruhito]] and [[Masako, Crown Princess of Japan|Crown Princess Masako]] have one child, [[Aiko, Princess Toshi|Princess Aiko]], born on December 1, 2001. The child's birth, which occurred more than eight years after her parents' marriage and after the Crown Princess had considerable (and widely noted) difficulty in conceiving a child, sparked a lively debate in Japan about imperial succession.  To add to this dearth of male heirs, Crown Prince Naruhito's brother, [[Fumihito, Prince Akishino|Prince Akishino]], had only two daughters, [[Princess Mako of Akishino]], born on October 23, 1991, and [[Princess Kako of Akishino]], born December 29, 1994.

The two other collateral members of the Imperial Family also had only daughters. The late [[Prince Tomohito of Mikasa]] had two daughters, [[Princess Akiko of Mikasa]], born December 20, 1981, and [[Princess Yōko of Mikasa]], born October 25, 1983. The late [[Norihito, Prince Takamado|Prince Takamado]] had three daughters, [[Princess Tsuguko of Takamado]], born March 8, 1986, [[Princess Noriko of Takamado]], born July 22, 1988, and [[Princess Ayako of Takamado]] born September 15, 1990. No male heir had been born into the Imperial Family in nearly 41 years.

In the early 2000s, the succession controversy emerged as a political issue. The ''[[Asahi Shimbun]]'' published an editorial in May 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.asahi.com/english/Herald-asahi/TKY200605050077.html | title = EDITORIAL: The emperor's status | date = 2006-05-05 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060506231831/http://www.asahi.com/english/Herald-asahi/TKY200605050077.html | archivedate = 6 May 2006 | newspaper = [[Asahi Shimbun]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that the current system was unsustainable. In an ''Asahi Shimbun'' survey in March 2006, 82% of the respondents supported the revision of the [[Imperial Household Law]] to allow a woman to ascend to the Imperial Throne.&lt;ref name="asahi"&gt;女性天皇容認68%に、朝日新聞、2009年3月22日&lt;/ref&gt; Then [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] [[Junichirō Koizumi]] also strongly supported the revision, pledging to present a bill to the 2006 session of the parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.redorbit.com/news/international/385643/japan_koizumi_gives_up_on_female_royal_succession/ |title = Japan Koizumi gives up on female royal succession | date = February 9, 2006 | first = George | last = Nishiyama | location = Tokyo, Japan | publisher = Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some conservative lawmakers opposed Koizumi and said the debate was premature. The current emperor's cousin, Prince Tomohito of Mikasa, also opposed the proposal, saying that the official male members of the Japanese imperial family might take up concubines in order to produce male members because it was previously possible for a male illegitimate child to assume the imperial throne. Later he said that this remark was just a joke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/world/asia/20tomohito.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=1 | work=The New York Times | title=A Font of Commentary Amid Japan's Taciturn Royals | first=Norimitsu | last=Onishi | date=October 20, 2007 | accessdate=May 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another solution would be to restore the Shinnoke (agnatic collateral branches of the imperial dynasty which had been disinherited by the United States) to the line of succession.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Following the birth of Prince Hisahito, the political debate surrounding succession subsided. Koizumi withdrew his bill, though public opinion polling suggested that support for the change was still around 68%.&lt;ref name="asahi" /&gt;

==Timeline of recent events==
* On January 24, 2005, the Japanese government announced that it would consider allowing the Crown Prince and Princess to adopt a male child, in order to avoid a possible "heir crisis". [[Adoption]] from other male-line branches of the Imperial Line is an age-old imperial Japanese tradition for dynastic purposes, prohibited only in modern times by Western influence. The child would presumably be adopted from one of the former imperial branches which lost imperial status after [[World War II]].  A government-appointed panel of experts submitted a report on October 25, 2005, recommending that the imperial succession law be amended to permit equal primogeniture.
* In November 2005, it was reported&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/japan/story/0,7369,1627427,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Bring back concubines, urges emperor's cousin | first=Justin | last=McCurry | date=November 4, 2005 | accessdate=May 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Emperor [[Akihito]]'s cousin [[Prince Tomohito of Mikasa]] had objected to the reversal of the male-only succession, in a column of the magazine of the welfare association which he serves as president. Prince Tomohito had suggested four options to continue the male-only line succession there; the fourth was permitting the Emperor or Crown Prince to take a [[concubine]], which was allowed by the former law of imperial succession.
* On January 20, 2006, [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] [[Junichirō Koizumi]] used part of his annual keynote speech to address the controversy when he pledged to submit a bill to the [[Japanese Diet]] letting women ascend to the throne so that imperial succession may be continued into the future in a stable manner. Koizumi did not announce any particular timing for the legislation to be introduced, nor did he provide details about its content, but said that it would be in line with the conclusions of the 2005 government panel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4630464.stm | work=BBC News | title=Japan bill to let women on throne | date=January 20, 2006 | accessdate=May 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On February 1, 2006, former trade minister [[Takeo Hiranuma]] caused a controversy by arguing against the proposed reform bill because Princess Aiko might marry a foreigner in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4669408.stm | work=BBC News | title=Rally against Japan royals change | date=February 1, 2006 | accessdate=May 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On February 6, 2006, it was announced that [[Fumihito, Prince Akishino|Prince Akishino]]'s wife [[Kiko, Princess Akishino|Princess Kiko]] was pregnant, and would give birth due September.
* On September 6, 2006, Princess Kiko delivered a baby boy,&lt;ref name="cnn-birth"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/asiapcf/09/05/japan.princess/index.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081211040020/http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/asiapcf/09/05/japan.princess/index.html | archivedate = 11 December 2008 | publisher = CNN | title = Japan's Princess Kiko has boy | date = 6 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="time-birth"&gt;{{cite news | title = Japan Celebrates: It's a Boy! | first = Bryan |last = Walsh | location = Tokyo | date = 5 September 2006 | url = http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1531895,00.html?cnn=yes | publisher = TIME World}}&lt;/ref&gt; later named [[Prince Hisahito of Akishino|Prince Hisahito]]. According to the current succession law he is third in line to the throne, but Princess Aiko, who now holds no right to succession, would have precedence over him as well as over her uncle if the law is changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Curtin|first1=J.

* On January 3, 2007, [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] [[Shinzō Abe]] announced that he would drop the proposal to alter the [[Imperial Household Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.usatoday.com/money/world/2007-01-03-japan-female-monarch_x.htm |title=Report: Japan to drop plan to allow female monarch  |work=[[USA Today]] |date=January 3, 2007 |publisher=[[Gannett Company|Gannett]] |location=[[McLean, VA]] |issn=0734-7456 |agency=The Associated Press |accessdate=October 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In September 2007, Abe's successor [[Yasuo Fukuda]] stated he was in favour of reforming the Imperial Household Law to allow female succession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/09/21/asia/AS-GEN-Japan-Politics.php | title = PM candidate: government must clean up act, allow female monarch | author = The Associated Press | date = 21 September 2007 | publisher = International Herald Tribune | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080611062221/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/09/21/asia/AS-GEN-Japan-Politics.php | archivedate = 11 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In November 2009, in a speech commemorating his 20th anniversary since ascending the Chrysanthemum Throne, Emperor Akihito refrained from giving his own suggestions on the succession debate, but urged the government to consider the opinions of his sons Crown Prince Naruhito and Prince Akishino.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Sentaku Magazine |title = Royal challenge awaits Noda | newspaper = The Japan Times | year = 2012 | page = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On October 5, 2011, [[Shingo Haketa]], Grand Steward of the Imperial Household Agency, visited Prime Minister [[Yoshihiko Noda]] at his office and told him that it was a matter of urgency to enable female members of the imperial family to create family branches. According to the Grand Steward, the imperial family cannot maintain its activities in a stable manner. Twelve imperial family members were adults under the age of 60 but half of these were unmarried princesses between the ages of 20 and 30. As the princesses leave the family through marriage, it would become more and more difficult for the imperial family to perform its duties. Considering that Prince Hisahito was the only grandchild of Emperor Akihito eligible to assume the throne, the agency also said that it would be necessary to design a system to ensure stable succession to the imperial throne, although this would be a mid- to long-term concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.asiaone.com/News/Latest%2BNews/Asia/Story/A1Story20111126-312777.html | work=AsiaOne | title=Japan's Imperial family 'needs change' | last=The Yomiuri Shimbun/Asia News Network | date=November 26, 2011 | accessdate=May 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grand Steward Haketa has reportedly been worried about the succession issue when he took the top post at the agency in 2005. After the Democratic Party of Japan won the election in September 2009, he explained the situation to Cabinet members, urging the government to address the issue. The government has yet to act upon his request.&lt;ref name="thefreelibrary.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/FOCUS%3A+Imperial+succession+issue+behind+recent+talks+on+female...-a0274125295 | work=[[Kyodo News]] | title=Imperial succession issue behind recent talks on female members' status

* On November 25, 2011,  [[Chief Cabinet Secretary]] [[Osamu Fujimura]] said that a way had to be found to secure a "stable" accession to the Chrysanthemum Throne, expressing concern over the small number of successors to the crown. "The government is aware that future anxiety over securing a stable succession has not been resolved," Fujimura said. "Maintaining a steady succession is an issue that relates to the core of the nation and the government will consider it based on thorough discussions from various levels of the public."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20111126a4.html | work=Japan Times | title=Fujimura says 'stable' system of Imperial succession needed | first=Masami | last=Ito | date=November 26, 2011 | accessdate=May 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, former trade minister [[Takeo Hiranuma]], now a founding member of [[Sunrise Party|Sunrise Party of Japan]], contended during a meeting with conservative organizations that the male line of imperial heirs should be maintained. Hiranuma suggested that if female members were allowed to remain in the family after marrying a commoner, they should try and marry a member of the eleven branches of the imperial family that were removed from the line of succession in October 1947. Hiranuma also proposed to reinstate the former branches in the Imperial family, to increase its size.&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20111216f1.html | work=Japan Times | title=Imperial law revisited as family shrinks, Emperor ages | first=Alex | last=Martin | date=December 16, 2011 | accessdate=May 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On December 1, 2011, Prime Minister Noda called for a national debate on whether women should be allowed to retain their imperial status after marriage. He did not set any deadlines but declared his intention to build a framework to discuss the issue.&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt; Two days later, some government officials told [[Kyodo News]] that the issue of the female members' status "does not appear to be a pressing task. The government has no energy left to spare for that." According to Kyodo, a source close to the imperial family expressed concern because of the government's hesitant attitude. "It's obvious that the imperial family's range of activities will become narrower in the future without reforming the current system. A new system needs to be created before Princess Mako gets married. I'd like to see the public take more interest in the matter," said the source.&lt;ref name="thefreelibrary.com"/&gt;
* On January 6, 2012, Chief Cabinet Secretary Fujimura told a press conference that the government recognized "that maintaining the stability of the activities of the Imperial Household and lessening the burden of official duties placed on Their Majesties the Emperor and Empress are major issues of a high degree of urgency." He announced that they would focus on discussing the status of female members and the possibility for them to create new family branches but that there would be no debate about giving succession rights to them or to their children. He announced that "in order to contribute to the discussion," expert hearings would take place once or twice every month. Former Supreme Court Justice and lawyer Itsuo Sonobe was appointed to the position of Special Advisor to the Cabinet to lead the hearings, "as he is highly knowledgeable about the Imperial Household system" and formerly served as deputy chairman of the {{Interlanguage link multi|Advisory Council on Imperial Household Law|2=ja|3=皇室典範に関する有識者会議|preserve=1}} that recommended in 2005 that the right to ascend the Chrysanthemum Throne should be expanded to women and imperial family offspring of female lineage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.kantei.go.jp/foreign/tyoukanpress/201201/6_a.html | title=Press Conference by Chief Cabinet Secretary Fujimura (Excerpt) | date=January 6, 2012 | accessdate=May 18, 2012|quote=Advisory Council on the Imperial House Law held in 2005.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Takahashi|first=Hiroshi|contribution=Akihito and the Problem of Succession|editor-last=Shillony|editor-first=Ben-Ami|title=The Emperors of Modern Japan|publisher=BRILL|year=2008|format=snippet|url=//books.google.co.jp/books?id=FwztKKtQ_rAC&amp;pg=PA314|page=314|isbn=90-04-16822-2|quote=Prime Minister Koizumi Jun'ichirō in December 2004 set up a panel of experts, the ''kōshitsu tempan ni kansuru yūshikisha kaigi'' (Advisory Council on Imperial Household Law)}} {{ISBN|978-90-04-16822-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On January 7 and 8, 2012, a Kyodo News poll showed that 65.5% of the Japanese people supported the idea of allowing female members of the imperial family to create their own branches of the family and to retain their imperial status after marriage. The telephone survey drew valid responses from 1,016 eligible voters in 1,459 households randomly dialed across Japan, apart from parts of [[Fukushima Prefecture]] evacuated by the nuclear crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120109a1.html | work=Japan Times | title=Support rate for Cabinet sinks to 35.7% | last=Kyodo News | date=January 9, 2012 | accessdate=May 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On February 10, 2012, a ''[[The Japan Times|Japan Times]]'' editorial accused Fujimura of "beating around the bush" by solely talking about the importance of maintaining "the activities of the Imperial Family in a stable manner" and of lightening "the burden of the Emperor and Empress's official duties." It voiced concerns that "if male members of the Imperial Family become very few, it will become difficult to keep the Imperial line" and that "given the current situation of the Imperial Family, making a woman Imperial Family member serve as an emperor may become unavoidable," blaming the government for "shying away from discussing a possible situation in which there will be no males to succeed to the throne."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/ed20120210a1.html | work=Japan Times | title=Imperial Family talking point | last=Editorial | date=February 10, 2012 | accessdate=May 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colin Jones, a law professor at [[Doshisha University]] in Kyoto, warned that, without changes, there would not be a backup plan if Prince Hisahito should fail to have a son or be incapacitated in some way. "Monarchies have extended families just so that there's a source of spares," Professor Jones said. "Over time there will be no other members of the imperial family to act as proxies." According to Jones, it is necessary to also address the succession issue as soon as possible, since it may be too late to do so by the time Hisahito becomes emperor. "They can't just suddenly conjure up new imperials," he said. "They've got to do something now."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-02-16/emperor-s-surgery-highlights-scarcity-of-eligible-japanese-heirs.html | work=Bloomberg.com | title=Emperor's Surgery Highlights Scarcity of Japanese Heirs | first=Terje | last=Langeland | date= February 18, 2012 | accessdate=May 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On February 29, 2012, the first hearing took place. On this occasion Dr. Akira Imatani, Professor of medieval Japanese history at [[Teikyo University]], and Soichiro Tawara, a journalist, gave their opinions. Both recommended that female members of the imperial family should retain their status after marriage. "Times have changed and Japan has become a society that promotes gender equality. I think refusing to allow females to maintain their status is an anachronism," Tahara told the government panel. Tahara and Imatani proposed that commoner husbands of imperial princesses be granted quasi-imperial status, which would permit them to attend official events while keeping their jobs, if even with some restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120301a1.html | work=Japan Times | title=Keep females in Imperial clan: experts | first=Masami | last=Ito | date=March 1, 2012 | accessdate=May 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On March 29, 2012, the second hearing took place. Dr. Masayuki Yamauchi, professor of international affairs at the Graduate School of The [[University of Tokyo]], and Dr. Makoto Oishi, professor of constitutional law at the Graduate School of [[Kyoto University]], also expressed their endorsement of princesses establishing their own branches. Yamauchi proposed, in order to reduce the burden on the public budget, to limit the eligibility to princesses within the second degree of kinship to the emperor. (Currently that group includes the three granddaughters of Emperor Akihito, Princesses Aiko, Mako and Kako.) According to Yamauchi, at some point in the future the imperial family may consist of a single nuclear family, that of Prince Hisahito, and support by female-headed family branches might prove helpful in avoiding such isolation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work=Mainichi | title=2 more experts back princesses creating imperial family branches | last=Kyodo News | date=March 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On April 10, 2012, the third hearing took place. The experts at this hearing were [[Yoshiko Sakurai]] and Professor Akira Momochi, and these two were the first to clearly oppose the idea of letting imperial women retain their royal status upon marriage. Professor Momochi teaches law at [[Nihon University]], Japan's largest university. Ms. Sakurai is a well-known journalist and social critic in Japan, especially famous for her right-wing and sometimes ultra-nationalistic stance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.japansociety.org.uk/2127/japan-be-a-strong-nation-nihonyo-tsuyoki-kunto-nare/ | work=The Japan Society | title=Japan Be a Strong Nation (Nihonyo Tsuyoki Kuni to Nare) by Yoshiko Sakurai (review) | first=Takahiro | last=Miyao | accessdate=May 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there are no plans to give the princesses succession rights, Ms. Sakurai and Professor Momochi still have concerns that female-headed imperial family branches could eventually break the paternal lineage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120411a3.html | work= Japan Times | title=Conservative experts slam female Imperial branches | first=Masami | last=Ito | date= April 11, 2012 | accessdate=May 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a solution to the decrease of imperial family members and the lack of eligible male heirs, they suggested revising the [[Imperial Household Law]] so that male descendants of former imperial families which renounced their royal status in 1947 be allowed to return to the imperial family as adoptees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In the 19th century, more houses were created from branches of the [[Fushimi-no-miya]] house, the [[ōke]]. By 1935, there were eleven collateral branches of the imperial family altogether, in addition to the families of Emperor Showa's three brothers. According to the ''[[Yomiuri Shimbun]]'', the government is against the idea of reinstating the former collateral branches, "saying it will be difficult to obtain public support as the descendants were born as commoners."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/national/T120301006487.htm | work=Daily Yomiuri Online | title=Imperial family talks begin / Should female members retain royal status after marriage? | last=Takeshi Okimura/Katsumi Takahashi  | date= March 2, 2012 | accessdate=May 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On April 23, 2012, the fourth hearing took place. The experts at this hearing also backed the establishment of female branches of the imperial family. As the government plans to hear the views of "just under 20 experts," it is assumed that the hearings are halfway finished.
* On May 4, 2012, the ''Yomiuri Shimbun'' reported that the government plans to consult the ruling [[Democratic Party of Japan]] and major opposition parties on a draft for the revision of the [[Imperial Household Act]] before submitting a bill to an extraordinary Diet session in autumn or to an ordinary sitting of the legislature next year. Looking back at the hearings, one government official said, "A wider than expected range of views have been expressed," talking about the proposal to expand the number of imperial family members by allowing men of the former princely houses to return to the imperial family as adoptees. Another idea that raised attention was allowing female imperial family members to retain the title of "princess" even after leaving the imperial family by marriage, so they could still take part in the royal family's activities despite losing the formal imperial family member status. As this idea has been supported by proponents and opponents of the creation of female-headed family branches, officials said that it could be a compromise if the discussion "remains inconclusive." As there are still controversial viewpoints concerning the possibility of allowing princesses to keep their royal status after marriage, "the leadership of Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda will be crucial to government reform of the system," government officials told the ''Yomiuri Shimbun''. However, although Prime Minister Noda once underlined the urgency of the matter, he has not made any public remarks on this issue for many months. This has led to skepticism among some government officials about whether the issue is a major priority for him. A senior official of the [[Imperial Household Agency]] voiced his concern, telling the ''Yomiuri Shimbun'', "When considering the near future, the system needs to change." According to the Imperial Household Law, the Empress as well as princesses are temporarily allowed to act on behalf of the emperor in state matters. That means that if female members of the imperial family were allowed to keep their royal status after marriage, they would be able to considerably alleviate the burden of the few male royals by taking over some of their duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/national/20120504dy01.htm | work= Daily Yomiuri Online | title=Imperial revision draft set for autumn release | last=Yutaka Ito/Katsumi Takahashi/Takeshi Okimura | date=May 4, 2012  | accessdate=May 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* On October 27, 2016, Prince Mikasa, one of the only five family members eligible to inherit the throne, died at age 100.

* On June 8, 2017, the Japanese parliament passed legislation that would allow Emperor Akihito to [[Abdication | abdicate]]. If enacted the abdication would likely occur in December 2018 when he reaches age 85.

'''Jeffry A. House''' (born December 29, 1946) is a [[lawyer]] in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], Canada.  He is best known for his efforts on behalf and representation of [[fugitive]] [[Americans|American]] [[soldiers]] and Native Canadian protesters.

==American soldiers==
{{main|Canada and Iraq War Resisters}}

The cases of Jeremy Hinzman and Brandon Hughey have been heard and rejected by the [[Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada]], refused at the [[Federal Court of Canada]], refused at the [[Federal Court of Appeal]], and refused at the [[Supreme Court of Canada]]. {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

The presence of [[US Army]] [[deserters]] in Canada is being widely reported in the international [[news media]], as well as in Canada and in the United States. During the Vietnam War, upwards of 50,000 U.S. draft evaders and military deserters found refuge in Canada. {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

==Native protesters==
House has represented Native protesters involved in the [[Ipperwash Crisis]] in [[Ipperwash Provincial Park]], [[Ontario]] in 1995, especially Nick Cottrelle and Warren George, with the matter ending in an [[acquittal]] of the accused.

==Biography==
Jeffry House grew up in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]]. After a year as an exchange student in [[Norway]], he graduated from the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] in 1969. House was drafted into the [[US Armed Forces]] during the [[Vietnam War]]. In January 1970, House evaded the military draft and moved to Canada. {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

He received a master's degree in Political Theory from [[York University]] and a Law Degree from the [[Osgoode Hall Law School]] in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. He has practiced law for three decades. For six years, House served on the quasi-judicial tribunal enforcing the [[Ontario Human Rights Code]]. His decisions involve an early gay rights case in which spousal benefits were awarded to same sex partners (Clinton &amp; Mercaz), and the Northwestern General Hospital case, where Crown disclosure obligation was held to apply in Human  Rights cases. {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

In 1991, he was counsel on the [http://csc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/1991/1991rcs2-69/1991rcs2-69.html Osborne decision] in the Supreme Court of Canada which struck down the law which prevented public employees from participating in after-work political activities.

The '''Joint Intelligence Committee''' ('''JIC''') is an interagency deliberative body responsible for [[intelligence assessment]], coordination and oversight of the [[Secret Intelligence Service]], [[MI5|Security Service]], [[Government Communications Headquarters|GCHQ]] and Defence Intelligence. The JIC is supported by the [[Joint Intelligence Organisation (United Kingdom)|Joint Intelligence Organisation]] under the [[Cabinet Office]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/national-security/groups/joint-intelligence-committee
|title=Joint Intelligence Committee
|date=15 July 2016
|publisher=Joint Intelligence Committee|format=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The JIC was founded on 7 July 1936&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Spying on the World|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=9780748678570|location=|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a sub-committee of the [[Committee of Imperial Defence]], the advisory peacetime defence planning agency. During World War II, it became the senior intelligence assessment body in the UK. In 1957 the JIC moved to the [[Cabinet Office]], where its assessments staff prepare draft intelligence assessments for the committee to consider.

===Role in the Iraq dossier===
{{main article|Iraq Dossier}}
The JIC recently played a controversial role in compiling a dossier in which the UK government set out the threat posed by [[Iraq]]'s [[Weapons of Mass Destruction]] in the run up to war. There were allegations that the dossier was "sexed up" prior to publication in order to bolster the case for military action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/chilcot-report-iraq-war-alastair-campbell-cleared-sexed-up-dossier-tony-blair-spin-doctor-a7122571.html|title=Alastair Campbell cleared of 'sexing up' intelligence dossier ahead of Iraq War|date= 6 July 2016|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence that the wording of the dossier was "strengthened" was presented to the [[Hutton Inquiry]], a judicial review set up to investigate the circumstances leading up to the death of an eminent government weapons expert, [[David Kelly (weapons expert)|David Kelly]], who had criticised the wording of the dossier in off-the-record briefings to journalists. Dr. Kelly committed suicide shortly after his identity was confirmed to the media by the government. JIC members [[John Scarlett]] and Sir [[Richard Dearlove]] (both then head of MI6, the Secret Intelligence Service) gave evidence to the Inquiry in which they argued that the words used in the dossier were consistent with their assessment of the intelligence available at the time.

Despite the work of the 1400 strong [[Iraq Survey Group]] in post-war Iraq, no evidence of actual WMD capability has so far been uncovered; according to its final report in September 2004. The US and UK Governments both announced investigations into the assessment of WMD intelligence in the run up to war. The British [[Butler Inquiry|inquiry]], headed by [[Robin Butler, Baron Butler of Brockwell|Lord Butler of Brockwell]], in its report in July 2004, while critical of the British intelligence community, did not recommend that anyone should resign. Similarly, the [[United States Senate|US Senate]] Intelligence Committee, while critical of US intelligence officials, did not recommend any resignations in its report, also issued in July 2004.

==Structure==
The Committee is chaired by a permanent chairman, a member of the Senior Civil Service, and is supported by the [[Joint Intelligence Organisation (United Kingdom)|Joint Intelligence Organisation]] which includes an assessments staff. The assessment staff is made up of experienced senior analysts drawn from across government and the military and conducts all-source analysis on subjects of interest to the committee. JIC papers draw input from across the intelligence and security agencies and other related bodies.&lt;ref name="official-documents2006"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.archive.official-documents.co.uk/document/caboff/nim/0114301808.pdf
|title=National Intelligence Machinery
|date=November 2006
|publisher=[[The Stationery Office]]|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Membership comprises senior officials in the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]], [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] and [[United Kingdom Armed Forces]], [[Home Office]], [[Department for International Development]], [[HM Treasury]] and the [[Cabinet Office]].&lt;ref name="official-documents2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nationalarchives1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20070701230000/http://www.intelligence.gov.uk/central_intelligence_machinery/joint_intelligence_committee.html |title=The Joint Intelligence Committee |publisher=Webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk |date=2007-07-07 |accessdate=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The JIC is subject to oversight by the [[Intelligence and Security Committee]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://isc.independent.gov.uk/About the Committee] Intelligence and Security Committee&lt;/ref&gt; It is supported by the [[Joint Intelligence Organisation (United Kingdom)|Joint Intelligence Organisation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/national-security/groups/joint-intelligence-organisation
|title=Joint Intelligence Organisation
|date=July 2016
|publisher=[[Joint Intelligence Organisation (United Kingdom)|Joint Intelligence Organisation]]|format=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role and functions==
The JIC is responsible for:&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;
* assessing events and situations relating to external affairs, defence, terrorism, major international criminal activity, scientific, technical and international economic matters and other transnational issues, drawing on secret intelligence, diplomatic reporting and open source material
* to monitor and give early warning of the development of direct and indirect threats and opportunities in those fields to British interests or policies and to the international community as a whole
* to keep under review threats to security at home and overseas and to deal with such security problems as may be referred to it
* to contribute to the formulation of statements of the requirements and priorities for intelligence gathering and other tasks to be conducted by the intelligence agencies
* to maintain oversight of the intelligence community’s analytical capability through the Professional Head of Intelligence Analysis
* to maintain liaison with Commonwealth and foreign intelligence organisations as appropriate, and to consider the extent to which its product can be made available to them

The JIC has three functions:
* Advising the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] and Cabinet Ministers on intelligence collection and analysis priorities in support of national objectives.
* Periodically scrutinises the performance of the Agencies in meeting the collection requirements placed upon them.&lt;ref name="nationalarchives1"/&gt; 
* Assuring the professional standards of civilian intelligence analysis staff across the range of intelligence related activities in [[Her Majesty's Government]].

===Intelligence requirements===
The JIC drafts the annual Requirements and Priorities for collection and analysis, for approval by Ministers.  These support the strategic national security objectives of the UK:

* Protect UK and British territories, and British nationals and property, from a range of threats, including from terrorism and espionage;
* Protect and promote Britain's defence and foreign policy interests;
* Protect and promote the UK's economic well-being; and
* Support the prevention and detection of serious crime.

===Foreign liaison===
Ever since World War II, the chief of the London station of the [[United States]] [[Central Intelligence Agency]] has attended the JIC's weekly meetings. One former US intelligence officer has described this as the "highlight of the job" for the London CIA chief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The '''Judge Advocate General of the United States Army''' ('''TJAG''') is the commanding officer of the [[Judge Advocate General's Corps, United States Army|Judge Advocate General's Corps]] of the [[United States Army]].  Under [[Title 10 of the United States Code]], the TJAG is appointed by the [[President of the United States]].  Suitable candidates are recommended by the [[Secretary of the United States Army|Secretary of the Army]].  Title 10 requires the TJAG to hold the rank of [[Lieutenant General (United States)|lieutenant general]] and sets the term of office to four years per {{USC|10|3037}}.

==Creation==
The position of Judge Advocate General was the brainchild and creation of General [[George Washington]].  In a letter to the [[Continental Congress]] he wrote, "I would humbly propose that some provision should be made for a judge advocate, and provost-marshal.  The necessity of the first appointment was so great that I was obliged to nominate a Mr. Tudor, who was well recommended to me, and now executes the office under an expectation of receiving captain's pay--an allowance (in my opinion) scarcely adequate to the service, in new raised troops, where there are court-martials every day."&lt;ref&gt;Washington, George.  ''Official Letters to the Honorable American Congress, Written During the War Between the United Colonies and Great Britain by his Excellency George Washington.''.  Page 13.  Retrieved from Google Books.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=dCATAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PP9#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false].&lt;/ref&gt;  Congress agreed with Washington and Tudor was formally commissioned as a lieutenant colonel.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/download/journalsofcontin07unit/journalsofcontin07unit.pdf Journals of the Continental Congress, 1774-1789.] page 645.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3537">'''Mark Maxson''' is a formerly imprisoned convict, who was falsely accused and convicted of the [[murder]] of Lindsay Murdock a six-year-old boy and later [[exonerated]] by DNA evidence. Following the murder in August 1993, Maxson spent over two decades in prison before being released in September 2016.

==Murder and trial==
On August 29, 1993, the badly beaten body of six year old Lindsay Murdoch was found on South State Street, Chicago. Maxson had mentioned to a TV reporter that he had bought a packet of potato chips for the boy on August 28 and told him to go home.&lt;ref name = Tribune/&gt; The police picked up Maxson and, according to Maxson, he was beaten and tortured until he signed a confession (The State of Illinois Torture Inquiry and Relief Commission found in 2013 that Maxson's accusations were credible&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.illinois.gov/tirc/Documents/Meeting%20Minutes%20July%2017,%202013.pdf|title=Minutes of the State of Illinois  Torture Inquiry and Relief Commission|last=|first=|date=2013-07-17|website=State of Illinois  Torture Inquiry and Relief Commission|publisher=|location=Chicago, Illinois, USA|page=7|access-date=2016-10-01|quote=Claim No. 2011.019-M}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Maxson refused to sign and withdrew his confession. Fingerprints on a piece of broken glass, blood on the boys shirt and a pubic hair found at the crime scene did not match Maxson.  In spite of no physical evidence linking him to the crime, Maxson was convicted of the murder and sentenced to life in jail plus 50  years by Judge Daniel Locallo who said of Maxson: "You are a man of malignant heart and I find you must be eliminated from society,"&lt;ref name = Tribune&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-child-murder-conviction-tossed-inmate-freed-met-20160927-story.html|title=Inmate freed after nearly 25 years in prison when DNA clears him in boy's killing|last=Schmadeke|first=Steve|date=2016-09-17|website=Chicago Tribune|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exoneration==
The Cook County, Illinois Conviction Integrity Unit got the Illinois state's attorney's office to agree to DNA testing of the evidence in 2015.  The DNA on Lindsay Murdoch's shirt and pants matched another man Osborne Wade (who had been convicted of stabbing another man to death in 1974) but not Maxson.  In May 2016, Wade admitted in a confession that he had killed Lindsay Murdoch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://usa-general.com/chicago/accused-killer-wrote-to-boy-and-039;s-family-wrongly-convicted-man.html|title=Accused killer wrote to boy's family, wrongly convicted man|last=|first=|date=2016-09-30|website=USA  General|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On September 27, 2016, a Cook County judge threw out Maxson's conviction and he was released from jail.

[[File:MpieR Frankfurt.jpg|alt=|thumb|Institute building]]
The '''Max Planck Institute for European Legal History''' ({{lang-de|Max-Planck-Institut für europäische Rechtsgeschichte}}), situated in Frankfurt/Main, is one of 83 institutes and research facilities of the Max Planck Society (MPG). Since its foundation in 1964 researchers at the institute have been investigating the history of law in Europe and beyond.

== History ==

The founding director of the institute was Helmut Coing (1964–1979). Dieter Simon (1980-2001), Walter Wilhelm (1980-1987), Michael Stolleis (1991-2006) and [[Marie Theres Fögen]] (2001-2008) later became directors of the institute. After having retired in 2006 again Michael Stolleis became Managing Director of the MPIeR until 2009. In 2010 Thomas Duve, the new director and Scientific Member, took over the institute's management. In 2014, [[Stefan Vogenauer]] joined the Directorate and has been acting as Managing Director since 2016. Currently, Thomas Duve, Dieter Simon, Michael Stolleis and Stefan Vogenauer are Scientific Members of the institute. Knut Wolfgang Knörr is an External Scientific Member at the MPIeR.

== Research ==

Under Helmut Coing the research focus of the MPIeR was placed on the history of private law in Europe and its correlation to economic history. Dieter Simon, Walter Wilhelm, Michael Stolleis and Marie Theres Fögen gradually broadened the research scope of the institute to the theory and sociology of law, the history of public law, international law, criminal law, the law of modern Eastern Europe and the Europe of Dictatorship in the 20th century. Today, Thomas Duve and Stefan Vogenauer focus on the transnational approach to European Legal History by pursuing research in the fields of Global History and Comparative Law. The current research profile comprises four research areas which are Multinormativity, Translation, Legal Spaces and Conflict Regulation. In addition, 14 special research fields add to the institute's profile. These are Legal Historiography, Sources, History of Private Law, History of Criminal Law and Criminal Justice, Legal History of the Church, Regulating Regimes, History of Legal Methods and Practices, Legal History of the European Union, Legal Transfer in the Common Law World, Legal History of Ibero-America, Law as a Civilising Factor in the First Millennium, the Legal History of the School of Salamanca, Governance of the Universal Church after the Council of Trent as well as Law and Diversity. Areas of Expertise still present at the MPIeR are "Age and Law", "Kriminalbilder und Sicherheitsdiskurse im vormodernen Europa", "Communication and Representation of Law in (Pictorial) Media", "Confessionalism and the History of Church Law in the 19th and 20th Centuries", "The Europe of Dictatorships", "Gute Policey: Administrative Law and the science of public affairs", "History of International Law", "History of Private Law in the Modern Era", "Law in the Industrial Revolution", "Legal Cultures in Modern Eastern Europe", LOEWE Research Focus “Extrajudicial and Judicial Conflict Resolution”, LOEWE Junior Research Group “Canon Law, Moral Theology and Conflict Resolution in the Early Modern Period”, "Recht macht alt", "Rechtliche Aspekte konfessioneller Migration im neuzeitlichen Europa", "Rechtsgeschichte der Schule von Salamanca", "Scientific Communication in the 19th Century", "Scientific History of Public Law", "Venues Where Juridical and Economic Rationalities of Regulation Interact" and "Zur Ikonographie der Gesetzgebung".

== Infrastructure ==

The interdisciplinary research at the MPIeR, its specialised library with more than 440,000 media items, its publications and its numerous institutional and international cooperations offer a unique research environment for legal historians and other researchers worldwide. During the past fifty years the institute has turned into one of the central research hubs for the worldwide scientific community concerned with investigating our past and present national and transnational legal orders.

Collaboration in the Rhein-Main region, in particular with the Goethe University Frankfurt, plays an important role. Via the Cluster of Excellence entitled "The Formation of Normative Orders" or the Collaborative Research Center called "Discourses of weakness and Resource Regimes" the institute and the university jointly contribute to create a sustainable research site on normativity. Together they also established "The School of Salamanca" as long-term research project at the Academia of Science and Literature Mainz and thereby managed to combine research perspectives in the fields of legal history and philosophy.

== Publications ==

Since 2002 the institute's journal [http://www.rg-rechtsgeschichte.de/ ''Rechtsgeschichte''] appears annually in print (Klostermann Verlag) and is simultaneously available through open access since 2012. Its predecessors were IUS COMMUNE, journal for European legal history (1967-2001), and the Rechtshistorisches Journal (journal on legal history, 1982-2001). Research results of the institute are also published as working papers, pre-print editions or in a post-print format in the Legal History Research Paper Series, which has appeared online as SSRN since 2012. Beyond the journals, a number of book series reflect the work at the institute, i.e. ''Global Perspectives on Legal History'', ''Studien zur europäischen Rechtsgeschichte'', ''Studien zu Policey und Policeywissenschaft'' or ''methodica - Einführung in die rechtshistorische Forschung''.

== Organisation ==

The MPI for European Legal History has two research departments and is currently managed by Stefan Vogenauer. In addition, a Max Planck Research Group works at the institute, headed by Benedetta Albani. Her group works on the "Governance of the Universal Church after the Council of Trent". Friends and supporters of the institute founded an association in 2003, which is called "Freunde des Frankfurter Max-Planck-Instituts für europäische Rechtsgeschichte e.V.".

The service facilities of the institute comprise the Administration (headed by Carola Schurzmann), the Library (headed by Sigrid Amedick), the Editorial Staff (headed by Karl-Heinz Lingens) and the IT-Management (headed by Volker Novak). Stefanie Rüther has been the research coordinator since 2015.

'''Military expression''' is an area of [[military law]] pertaining to the [[United States military]] that relates to the [[free speech]] rights of its service members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vagts|first=Detlev F.|title=Free Speech in the Armed Forces|journal=[[Columbia Law Review]]|date=February 1957|volume=57|issue=12|pages=187–218|issn=0010-1958|oclc=4895173605}}&lt;/ref&gt; While "military free speech" was the term used during the [[Vietnam War]] era, "military expression" has become a niche area of [[military law]] since 2001.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.yaleconservativeparty.com/stm Yale Conservative Party] lecture for 2009 titled "Military Expression in the Modern Armed Forces"&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=February 2011}} Besides media references relating to specific cases, the term was used at military [[whistleblower]] committee hearings with members of the [[United States House of Representatives]] and Senate on May 14, 2008. Transcripts of the hearings show that attorney [[Mike Lebowitz]] was identified as testifying as a legal expert in "military expression".&lt;ref&gt;transcripts for May 14, 2008, see also [[C-SPAN]] coverage of hearings&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full|date=November 2012}} That hearing also included references by U.S. Representative [[Sheila Jackson Lee]] (D-TX) who also referred to the area of law as "military expression".{{Elucidate|date=February 2011}}

== Limitations on military expression ==

While the civilian population of the United States is afforded the right to free expression under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] has affirmed the notion that service members have a reduced level of free speech.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/135/550 ''United States v. Voorhees''] 135 U.S. 550 (10 S.Ct. 841, 34 L.Ed. 258)&lt;/ref&gt; While the Court acknowledged that service members do have First Amendment rights, these rights are limited:

{{quote|They do, in fact, have the same first amendment rights as their civilian brothers. They are, however, not absolute...The difference is that the military has peculiar needs and interests apart from those of the civilian community it serves, and they preclude the exercise of the right of free speech on as broad a basis as is the practice in the civilian community. No [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] or man in the armed forces has a right, be it constitutional, statutory or otherwise, to publish any information (or make any statement) which will imperil his unit or its cause.&lt;ref name="airpower.maxwell.af.mil"&gt;http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/aureview/1980/may-jun/moran.html  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071123235218/http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/aureview/1980/may-jun/moran.html |date=November 23, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=February 2011}}}}

== After September 11, 2001 ==

With the advent of the [[Iraq War]] in 2003, the issue of military expression was again in the public eye as a relatively small amount of service members and veterans began demonstrating. One case revolved around a former Marine (still under contract with the [[Individual Ready Reserve|IRR]]) who was photographed by the ''[[Washington Post]]'' wearing a partial uniform during an anti-war demonstration in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref name=david&gt;{{cite news|last=Montgomery|first=David|title=Antiwar to the Corps: Marine Reservist-Protesters Face Discipline|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/30/AR2007053002627_pf.html|newspaper=[[Washington Post]]|date=31 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The individual faced disciplinary action for his participation in this demonstration, as well as for a politically charged email he sent to a Marine officer.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Koff, "Corps accused of 'muzzle' tactics", ''Cleveland Plain Dealer'', May 31, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full|date=November 2012}} However, in this case, the service member avoided the other than honorable discharge being sought by the military due to the First Amendment arguments posed on his behalf.&lt;ref name=david/&gt; That case, which was argued by attorney [[Mike Lebowitz]] in representation of anti-war and political activist [[Adam Kokesh]], is regarded as the first military expression case of its kind to result generally favorably for the service member.&lt;ref name=justine&gt;{{cite news|last=Sharrock|first=Justine|title=Zip It, Soldier!: What happens to Iraq veterans who speak out against the war?|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2008/09/iraq-veterans-speak-out-against-war|newspaper=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]|date=29 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects of technology ==

Political speech, to include being active in a political party, also has become an issue as the Internet and email permits easier participation despite rules against such activity.&lt;ref&gt;"Modern Whig Party has Appeal to Some Troops," by William H. McMichael ''Military Times'' on June 23, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

The '''Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968''' ({{USStatute|90|351|82|197|1968|06|19}}, codified at {{usc|34|10101}} ''et seq.'') was legislation passed by the [[Congress of the United States]] and signed into law by President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] that established the [[Law Enforcement Assistance Administration]] (LEAA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=28939 |title=Lyndon B. Johnson: "Statement by the President Upon Signing the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968.," June 19, 1968 |author1=Peters, Gerhard |author2=Woolley, John T |work=The American Presidency Project |publisher=University of California - Santa Barbara}}&lt;/ref&gt; Title III of the Act set rules for obtaining [[Telephone tapping|wiretap]] orders in the United States. It had been started shortly after November 22, 1963 when evidence in the assassination of President [[John F. Kennedy]] increased public alertness to the relative lack of control over the sale and possession of guns in the United States. The act was a major accomplishment of Johnson's [[war on crime]].

== Grants ==
The LEAA, which was superseded by the [[Office of Justice Programs]], provided [[Federal grants in the United States|federal grant]] funding for criminology and criminal justice research, much of which focused on social aspects of crime.&lt;ref name="savelsberg"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Savelsberg, Joachim J., Lara L. Cleveland, Ryan D. King |date=June 2004 |title=Institutional Environments and Scholarly Work: American Criminology, 1951-1993 |journal=Social Forces |volume=82 |pages=1275–1302 | issue=4 |doi=10.1353/sof.2004.0093}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Research grants were also provided to develop alternative sanctions for punishment of young offenders. [[Block grant]]s were provided to the states, with $100 million in funding.&lt;ref name="brookings"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brook.edu/gs/cps/50ge/endeavors/crime.htm |title=Government's 50 Greatest Endeavors |publisher=Brookings Institution |accessdate=2006-10-31 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061016145623/http://www.brook.edu/gs/cps/50ge/endeavors/crime.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within that amount, $50 million was [[Earmark (politics)|earmark]]ed for assistance to local [[law enforcement agency|law enforcement agencies]], which included funds to deal with [[riot]] control and [[organized crime]].&lt;ref name="brookings"/&gt;

== Handguns ==
The Omnibus Crime Bill also prohibited [[interstate commerce|interstate]] trade in [[handgun]]s and increased the minimum age to 21 for buying handguns. This legislation was soon followed by the [[Gun Control Act of 1968]], which set forth additional [[gun control]] restrictions.

== Wiretaps ==
The [[wiretapping]] section of the bill was passed in part as a response to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] decisions ''[[Berger v. New York]]'', 388 U.S. 41 (1967) and ''[[Katz v. United States]]'', 389 U.S. 347 (1967), which both limited the power of the government to obtain information from citizens without their consent, based on the protections under the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] to the U.S. Constitution. In the ''Katz'' decision, the Court "extended the Fourth Amendment protection from unreasonable search and seizure to protect individuals with a 'reasonable expectation of privacy.'"

Section 2511(3) of the Crime Control Bill specifies that nothing in the act or the [[Federal Communications Act of 1934]] shall limit the constitutional power of the President "''to take such measures as he deems necessary''":
* "''to protect the nation against actual or potential attack or other hostile acts of a foreign power, to obtain foreign intelligence information deemed essential to the security of the United States or to protect national security information against foreign intelligence activities''"
* "''to protect the United States against the overthrow of the Government by force or other unlawful means, or against any other clear and present danger to the structure or existence of the Government''"

The section also limits use in evidence only where the interception was reasonable and prohibits disclosure except for purpose.

In 1975, the [[United States Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities]], (known as the "Church Committee") was established to investigate abuses by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), [[National Security Agency]] (NSA), [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), and the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS). In 1975 and 1976, the Church Committee published 14 reports on various U.S. intelligence agencies' operations, and a report on the FBI's [[COINTELPRO]] program stated that ''"the Fourth Amendment did apply to searches and seizures of conversations and protected all conversations of an individual as to which he had a [[reasonable expectation of privacy]]...At no time, however, were the Justice Department's standards and procedures ever applied to NSA's electronic monitoring system and its 'watch listing' of American citizens. From the early 1960s until 1973, NSA compiled a list of individuals and organizations, including 1200 American citizens and domestic groups, whose communications were segregated from the mass of communications intercepted by the Agency, transcribed, and frequently disseminated to other agencies for intelligence purposes''".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/94755_II.pdf|title=Intelligence Reports and the Rights of Americans: Book II|last=|first=|publisher=Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations With Respect to Intelligence Activities|date=April 24, 1976|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==FBI expansion==
The bill increased the FBI budget by 10% to fund police training at the [[FBI National Academy]]. Much of this training was for [[riot control]], a popular political issue at the time.&lt;ref name=McKnight&gt;{{cite book|last=McKnight|first=Gerald D.|title=The last crusade : Martin Luther King, Jr., the FBI, and the poor people's campaign|year=1998|publisher=Westview Press|location=Boulder [u.a.]|isbn=0-8133-3384-9|chapter='The Poor People Are Coming!' 'The Poor People Are Coming!'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Miranda warning ==
In 1966, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] decision in [[Miranda decision|''Miranda v. Arizona'']] (384 U.S. 436) created the requirement that a citizen must be informed of their legal rights upon their arrest and before they are interrogated, which came to be known as [[Miranda warning]]s. Responding to various complaints that such warnings allowed too many criminals go free, Congress, in provisions codified under 18 U.S.C. § 3501 with a clear intent to reverse the effect of the court ruling, included a provision in the Crime Control Act directing federal trial judges to admit statements of criminal defendants if they were made voluntarily, without regard to whether he had received the Miranda warnings.

The stated criteria for voluntary statements depended on such things as:
:(1) the time between arrest and arraignment;
:(2) whether the defendant knew the crime for which he had been arrested;
:(3) whether he had been told that he did not have to talk to the police and that any statement could be used against him;
:(4) whether the defendant knew prior to questioning that he had the right to the assistance of counsel; and,
:(5) whether he actually had the assistance of counsel during questioning.

It also provided that the "presence or absence of any of" the factors "need not be conclusive on the issue of voluntariness of the confession." (As a federal statute, it applied only to criminal proceedings either under federal laws, or in the District of Columbia.)

That provision was disallowed{{When|date=May 2010}} by a federal appeals court decision that was not appealed, and it escaped Supreme Court review until 32 years after passage, when another [[United States courts of appeals|appeals court]] (the [[Fourth Circuit]], covering states from [[South Carolina]] to [[Maryland]]) failed to follow suit and reversed one of its district courts in ''[[Dickerson v. United States]]''. It reasoned, following a paper by [[University of Utah]] law professor [[Paul G. Cassell]], that Miranda was not a constitutional requirement, that Congress could therefore overrule it by legislation, and that the provision had supplanted the requirement that police give Miranda warnings.

The Supreme Court then agreed to hear the case. Typically, it overrules constitutional decisions only when their doctrinal underpinnings have eroded, and the majority justices found, in 2000, that it had intended ''Miranda'' as an interpretation of the Constitution and that if "anything, our subsequent cases have reduced the impact of the Miranda rule on legitimate law enforcement while reaffirming the decision's core ruling that unwarned statements may not be used as evidence in the prosecution's case in chief."

'''Operation Green Sweep''' was a series of drug raids conducted by over 200 [[United States Army|U.S. Army soldiers]], [[National Guard of the United States|National Guardsmen]], and [[special agent|Federal agents]] in [[Humboldt County, California|Humboldt County]], [[California]].&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/10/us/military-takes-part-in-drug-sweep-and-reaps-criticism-and-a-lawsuit.html|title=Military Takes Part in Drug Sweep And Reaps Criticism and a Lawsuit|last=Bishop|first=Katherine|date=August 10, 1990|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=15 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The operation was the first time active-duty troops were used to combat [[marijuana]] growing in the United States.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1345&amp;dat=19900810&amp;id=E8gSAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=CPoDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4269,1325684|title=Soldiers used for first time in pot sweep|date=August 10, 1990|publisher=Spokane Chronicle|accessdate=15 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 29, 1990 a joint task force converged at a base camp in Humboldt County for what is known as 'Operation Green Sweep'.  The operation was led by the [[Bureau of Land Management]] and consisted of approximately 60 drug law enforcement agents, 110 California National Guardsmen and 60 regular [[U.S. Army]] soldiers&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://fmso.leavenworth.army.mil/documents/ilusive.htm Foreign Military Studies Office Publications - Counterdrug Strategy - Illusive Victory:From Blast Furnace to Green Sweep&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[7th_Infantry_Division_(United_States)|7th Infantry Division]], the same unit that was used in the [[United_States_invasion_of_Panama|invasion of Panama]] during the previous December.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-07-31/news/mn-1199_1_military-personnel | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Mark A. | last=Stein | title=Army Troops Join Marijuana Raids : Drugs: National Guardsmen also take part in the start of a campaign by the Administration to use active-duty military personnel in the drug ... | date=July 31, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; This marked the first time that the government had ever used military force against its own citizens in a drug operation.  It also established that law enforcement officials--now cooperating with U.S. military forces --have the ability to search, seize and detain, without warrant or probable cause, in the war on drugs. Property may be seized regardless of evidence and forfeited to the state or federal government without regards to the [[Fourth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution|Fourth Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;H. Jane Lehman, "Expanded War on Drugs May Threaten Landlords," Washington Post, November 17, 1990, p. E1; Michael Isikoff, "Drug Raids Net Much Valuable Property--and Legal Uproar," Washington Post, April 1, 1991, p. A1.&lt;/ref&gt;  

A contingent of 200 military troops conducted a massive [[marijuana]] eradication program where military helicopters flew overhead surveying residents, homes, and fields, and conducted road blocks, interrogations, and detentions. Violent demonstrations by Humboldt County locals against Green Sweep broke out. The first day of the raid resulted in the seizure of 200 marijuana plants and 700 pounds of farming equipment. In addition, three arrests for trespassing were made by BLM at the base camp (a diversion for others to photograph the camp). Two eradication teams were deployed the very next day and seized a further 523 plants.

Eradication continued on August 1, resulting in 683 plants and 2.6 tons of growing paraphernalia confiscated from the local farmers. Local citizens began attempts to disrupt military communications in order to slow the progress of the raid, the military responded by introducing code words into Task Force radio nets. The operation continued several more days in August. The public continued to protest (sometimes violently) the actions of the military and federal officials. On August 3, local residents threatened a military laundry unit with a pistol and another group fired shots at a [[Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk|UH-60]] helicopter. 

Though the operation was scheduled to continue until August 10th&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; all operations ceased on August 5, most likely due to the escalating demonstrations.  The results from the property seized during Operation Green Sweep were: 1400 marijuana plants (worth approximately $2000 each) and 12 tons of growing equipment.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

[[File:Oxford Law Citator Logo.jpg|thumb|right|Oxford Law Citator logo]]

The '''Oxford Law Citator''', developed by [[Oxford University Press]] ('[[OUP]]'), is an example of an authority control system, used within [[legal research]]. The Oxford Law Citator provides and manages hypertext links between items published on [[OUP]]’s online services, as well as to other externally referenced sources.&lt;ref name="oxfordlawcitator.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordlawcitator.com/about |title=OUP Citator—About Us |website=Oxfordlawcitator.com |accessdate=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The Oxford Law Citator links together [[OUP]] online materials that mention or discuss each other, and provides users with further information on all references which are available online.  An Oxford Law Citator record contains basic information on the referenced item to help the user to continue their research, as well as links to related cases, instruments and commentary.&lt;ref name="oxfordlawcitator.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="International Journal of Legal Information"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1155&amp;context=ijli |journal=International Journal of Legal Information |volume=36 |date=2009-09-28 |title=Book Reviews |author=Duncan Alford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The population of the Citator is an ongoing project, which is being undertaken by [[OUP]] alongside the development of its online services. The aim is to provide a tool which allows users to follow, and explore the relevance of, references in and between different types of legal content and commentary.&lt;ref name="infolaw.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infolaw.co.uk/newsletter/index.asp?p=141 |title=New online ventures for OUP - Internet Newsletter for LawyersInternet Newsletter for Lawyers |website=Infolaw.co.uk |date=2016-02-04 |accessdate=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''constitutional referendum''' was held in [[Peru]] on 18 June 1939.&lt;ref name=DD&gt;[http://www.sudd.ch/event.php?lang=en&amp;id=pe011939 Peru, 18 June 1939: Constitutional reform] Direct Democracy {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed changes were approved by 88% of voters.&lt;ref name=DD/&gt; Following the referendum, [[Manuel Prado Ugarteche]] was elected President on 4 December.

On 6 August 1945 the [[Congress of the Republic of Peru|Congress]] passed a Law 10334, which declared the amendments unconstitutional, as they were not passed in line with Article 236 of the [[Constitution of Peru|1933 constitution]].

==Background==
In 1933 Congress elected [[Óscar R. Benavides]] to serve the remainder of President [[Luis Miguel Sánchez Cerro]]'s five-year term in office.&lt;ref name=DD/&gt; In the [[Peruvian presidential election, 1936|1936 presidential elections]] no candidate received a majority of the vote. Due to this, and one candidate being supported by the banned [[American Popular Revolutionary Alliance]], the Electoral Tribunal later declared the election invalid.&lt;ref name=DD/&gt; Congress subsequently extended Benavides' term until 1939 and allowed him to rule by decree.&lt;ref name=DD/&gt;

On 19 April 1939 he issued Law 8875 calling for a referendum on constitutional reform. The changes included setting six-year terms for both the Congress (although one third of members would be elected every two years) and the President.&lt;ref name=DD/&gt;

Cases &amp; Materials on Evidence. Fourth Edition. Oxford University Press. 1994. p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[presumption]] that forms part of the law of evidence of [[England and Wales]].

It is expressed by the [[Legal maxim|maxim of law]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]], 1999, para 10-5 at p. 1130&lt;/ref&gt; ''omnia praesumuntur rite et solemniter esse acta donec probetur in contrarium'',&lt;ref&gt;For this version, see [[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]], 1999, para 10-5 at p. 1130&lt;/ref&gt; which may be shortened to ''omnia praesumuntur rite et solemniter esse acta''&lt;ref&gt;For this version, see Simon Cooper, Peter Murphy,  &amp; John Beaumont, ''Cases &amp; Materials on Evidence'', 4th edn (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1994), 86.&lt;/ref&gt; or ''omnia praesumuntur rite esse acta''.&lt;ref&gt;For this version, see[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]], 1999, para 10-5 at p. 1130&lt;/ref&gt;

==Official actions==
Where it has been proved that an "official act" has been done, it will be presumed, until the contrary is proved, that the said act "complied with any necessary formalities" and that the person who did it was "duly appointed".&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, Simon &amp; Murphy, Peter &amp; Beaumont, John.

This is a [[presumption of law]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]], 1999, p. 1130, see heading "B" to paras. 10-4 and 10-5&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9578">The '''regulation of chemicals''' is the legislative intent of a variety of national laws or international initiatives such as agreements, strategies or [[Treaty|conventions]]. These international initiatives define the policy of further regulations to be implemented locally as well as exposure or emission limits.  Often, [[regulatory agency|regulatory agencies]] oversee the enforcement of these laws.

== International initiatives ==
'''Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management''' 
([[SAICM]]) -.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saicm.org |accessdate=October 30, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100909094851/http://saicm.org/ |archivedate=September 9, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This initiative was adopted at the International Conference on Chemicals Management (ICCM), which took place from 4–6 February 2006 in Dubai gathering Governments and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations. It defines a policy framework to foster the sound worldwide management of chemicals. 
This initiative covers risk assessments of chemicals and harmonized labeling up to tackling obsolete and stockpiled products. Are included provisions for national centres aimed at helping in the developing world, train staff in chemical safety as well as dealing with spills and accidents. SAICM is a voluntary agreement. 
A second International Conference on Chemicals Management -ICCM2- held in May 2009 in Geneva took place in order to enhance synergies and cost effectiveness and to promote SAICM’s multi-sectorial nature.

'''Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals''' (GHS)[&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unece.org/trans/danger/publi/ghs/ghs_welcome_e.html|title=About the GHS|work=unece.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;]
The “[[Globally Harmonised System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals]]” (GHS) proposes harmonised hazard communication elements, including labels and safety data sheets. It was adopted by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) in 2002. This system aims to ensure a better protection of human health and the environment during the handling of chemicals, including their transport and use. The classification of chemicals is done based on their hazard. This harmonisation will facilitate trade when implemented entirely.

'''Stockholm Convention''' [http://www.unido.org/index.php?id=5279]- 
The [[Stockholm Convention]] is a global treaty to protect human health and the environment from [[persistent organic pollutants]](POPs). It entered into force, on 17 May 2004, and over 150 countries signed the Convention. In May 2009, nine new chemicals are proposed for listing which then contained 12 substances.

'''Rotterdam Convention''' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pic.int|title=Rotterdam Convention Home Page|work=pic.int}}&lt;/ref&gt; – 
The objectives of the [[Rotterdam Convention]] are:
• to promote shared responsibility and cooperative efforts among Parties in the international trade of certain hazardous chemicals in order to protect human health and the environment from potential harm;
• to contribute to the environmentally sound use of those hazardous chemicals, by facilitating information exchange about their characteristics, by providing for a national decision-making process on their import and export and by disseminating these decisions to Parties. 
The text of the Convention was adopted on 10 September 1998 by a Conference in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. The Convention entered into force on 24 February 2004. The Convention creates legally binding obligations for the implementation of the Prior Informed Consent (PIC) procedure.

'''Basel Convention''' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.basel.int/|title=Basel Convention Home Page|work=basel.int}}&lt;/ref&gt; –
The [[Basel Convention]] on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal is a global environmental agreement on hazardous and other wastes. It came into force in 1992. The Convention has 172 Parties and aims to protect human health and the environment against the adverse effects resulting from the generation, management, transboundary movements and disposal of hazardous and other wastes.

'''Montreal Protocol'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ozone.unep.org/Publications/MP_Handbook/index.shtml|title=Publications|work=unep.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ozone.unep.org/|title=OZONE SECRETARIAT|work=unep.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; – The [[Montreal Protocol]] was a globally coordinated regulatory action that sought to regulate ozone-depleting chemicals. 191 countries have ratified the treaty.

== Regional regulations ==

'''USA''':&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/oppt/existingchemicals/pubs/enhanchems.html
&lt;/ref&gt; The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of the US announced in 2009 that the chemicals management laws would be strengthened, and that it would initiate a comprehensive approach to enhance the chemicals management program, including:
* New Regulatory Risk Management Actions 
* Development of Chemical Action Plans, which will target the risk management efforts on chemicals of concern
* Requiring Information Needed to Understand Chemical Risks
* Increasing Public Access to Information About Chemicals
* Engaging Stakeholders in Prioritizing Chemicals for Future Risk Management Action. 
Chemicals are regulated under various laws including the [[Toxic Substances Control Act]] (TSCA). In 2010, Congress was considering a new law entitled the '''Safe Chemicals Act'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/News/2010/April/16041001.asp Congress proposes toxic chemical regulation reforms]. Royal Society of Chemistry.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following several years, the Senate considered a number of legislative texts to amend the TSCA. These included the '''Safer Chemicals Act''', several versions of which were introduced by Senator Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ), with the latest in 2013, and the '''Chemical Safety Improvement Act (S. 1009, CSIA)''' introduced by Senators Lautenberg and David Vitter (R-LA) in 2013. Senator Lautenberg died shortly after CSIA's introduction, and over time his mantle was picked up by Senator Tom Udall (D-NM), who continued to work with Senator Vitter on revisions to the CSIA. The result of that effort was the '''Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act''', passed by the Senate on December 17, 2015. The '''Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) Modernization Act of 2015''' (H.R. 2576), passed the House of Representatives on June 23, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Recent Regulatory Developments {{!}} Bergeson &amp; Campbell|url = http://www.lawbc.com/regulatory-developments/entry/tsca-reform-detailed-summary-of-key-changes-in-frank-r.-lautenberg-chemical|website = www.lawbc.com|access-date = 2016-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Revised legislation, which resolved differences between the House and Senate versions, was forwarded to the President on June 14, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=HR 2576 Frank R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6316">A '''representative assembly''' is a political institution in which a number of persons representing the population or privileged orders within the population of a state come together to debate, negotiate with the executive (originally the king or other ruler) and legislate. Examples in English-speaking countries are the [[United States Congress]] and the [[Parliament]] of the United Kingdom.

== History ==
The classical republics of [[Ancient Greece|Greece]], [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] and [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]] included citizen assemblies (e.g. the Roman ''[[comitia]]''). Popular assemblies (''[[thing (assembly)|thing]]s'') also emerged in pre-civilised Germanic and Scandinavian lands (and the modern assemblies in those countries are often named after the originals). However, all of these were ''direct'' rather than ''indirect'' expressions of democracy, since their members were the people themselves rather than representatives of the people. The idea of an assembly of representatives, a ''representative assembly'', as a political institution of a literate society first appeared in Europe in the [[Middle Ages]], more specifically in the twelfth to fifteenth centuries. Perhaps it was brought into being by rulers determined to avoid being overawed by their powerful warrior barons by appealing to lower ranks of society: lesser landowners, townsmen and clergy. Whatever the explanation for its emergence, it is considered by many to be the most important political innovation of the European Middle Ages.

The idea appeared first in Spain, then in England, France and Italy, then spread to Germany and Scandinavia, even Poland and Hungary. Various names were used for these institutions: in England, Ireland, Scotland, Sicily, the [[Papal States]] and the [[Kingdom of Naples]] they were called parliaments or ''parlamenti''; in the Iberian peninsula they were called ''[[Cortes Generales|cortes]]'' or ''corts''; in France they were called [[French States-General|estates-general]] and in the Low Countries the [[Estates-General of the Netherlands|estates- or states-general]]; in Germany the term used was ''[[landtag]]''; in Denmark and Norway it was ''[[rigsdag]]'', in Sweden ''[[Parliament of Sweden|riksdag]]'', and in Poland ''[[sejm]]''.

The number of chambers roughly corresponded to the organised orders or [[estates of the realm|estates]] of mediaeval society: typically the church, the nobility, and the rest of society. Sometimes however (as in Spain and Portugal) the gentry or lesser nobility formed a separate order; sometimes (as in Sweden) the richer peasantry did likewise. The English parliament, which was to be an important example, was a deviant case in that only two orders were represented: the nobility and the rest.

The representative assembly fell into disuse in many of the more important states of Europe in the seventeenth century. However, it survived in England, Sweden, Poland, Hungary and many of the German statelets, the southern ones particularly. In the eighteenth century, the English parliament was effectively transplanted to the United States, and in the nineteenth century it evolved there in an increasingly democratic direction. The American variant propagated in due course to Latin America, but meanwhile in Europe there was a general revival of the representative assembly based principally on the English model. France revived its Estates General in the wake of its revolution. Later, after the disintegration of the empire of Napoleon Bonaparte, assemblies re-emerged in Sweden, the Netherlands, France and Spain. The British Empire especially at the time of its dismantlement in the twentieth century was instrumental in spreading parliamentary democracy far and wide, and in modern times the immense international influence of the United States has encouraged the spread of representative democracy worldwide.

Where forms of representative democracy have spread to countries that already had a tradition of assemblies, a merger of ideas has often taken place and the traditional name has tended to be used. Examples include ''[[majlis]]'' in certain Muslim countries, ''[[jirga]]'' in Afghanistan, ''[[duma]]'' in Russia. See [[list of national legislatures]] for more examples.

=== The first instance: the councils of León and Galicia ===
In [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] in 1113, Bishop [[Diego Gelmírez|Diego II]] of [[Santiago de Compostela]] ordered a monthly convening of ''councils'' in the regions of his bishopric “as it was the custom of our ancestors”, bringing together churchmen, knights ('milites') and peasants to do justice, in what has been interpreted as a continuation of old Celtic or [[Suevi]] local traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=López Ferreiro|first=Antonio|title=Fueros municipales de Santiago y de su tierra|year=1975|publisher=Ediciones Castilla|location=Madrid|isbn=84-7040-107-6|pages=164–165}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in 1188, King [[Ferdinand II of León|Ferdinand II]] of [[Kingdom of León|León]] and [[Kingdom of Galicia|Galicia]] called for a general council of his kingdoms to meet in the capital, [[León, Spain|León]], bringing together bishops, nobility and – allegedly for the first time in European history – representatives of the major cities and towns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Keane|first=John|title=The life and death of democracy|year=2009|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Co.|location=New York|isbn=978-0-393-05835-2|edition=1st American}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== State of the art ==
In more modern times, the supremacy of the lower chamber became normal, so did the organisation of representatives into competing parties, so did election and an extended franchise, so did the idea that the ministers of the executive should be responsible to it.

The '''Saudi–Iraqi neutral zone''' was an area of 7,044&amp;nbsp;km² on the border between [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraq]] within which the border between the two countries had not been settled. The neutral zone came into existence following the [[Uqair Protocol of 1922]] which defined the border between Iraq and the [[Sultanate of Nejd]] (Saudi Arabia's predecessor state). The neutral zone officially ended in 1981, when Iraq and Saudi Arabia agreed on the partition of the zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/outofdate/bgn/saudiarabia/6075.htm|title=Saudi Arabia Background Note|publisher=US Department of State|date=September 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Treaty of Muhammarah ([[Khorramshahr]]), 5 May 1922,&lt;ref name="state"&gt;{{cite web |author=Office of the Geographer |title=International Boundary Study: Iraq – Saudi Arabia Boundary |pages=11–12 |publisher=US Department of State |date=1971-06-01 |url=http://www.law.fsu.edu/library/collection/LimitsinSeas/IBS111.pdf |accessdate=2007-01-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060916035544/http://www.law.fsu.edu/library/collection/LimitsinSeas/IBS111.pdf |archivedate=2006-09-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; forestalled the imminent conflict between the [[United Kingdom]], which held the mandate for Iraq, and the [[Kingdom of Nejd]], which later became Saudi Arabia (when combined with the [[Kingdom of Hejaz]]). The treaty specifically avoided defining boundaries. Following further negotiations, the [[Uqair Protocol of 1922|Protocol of Uqair]] (Uqayr), 2 December 1922, defined most of the borders between them and created the neutral zone.&lt;ref name="state" /&gt;

No military or permanent buildings were to be built in or near the neutral zone&lt;ref name="dope" /&gt; and the nomads of both countries were to have unimpeded access to its pastures and wells.&lt;ref name="dope" /&gt;

Administrative division of the zone was achieved in 1975,&lt;ref name="cia"&gt;{{cite web |author=Directorate of Intelligence |title=The World Factbook 1990 - Iraq - Saudi Arabia Neutral Zone (mirror) |url=http://wiretap.area.com/Gopher/Library/Classic/world90.txt |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19980522124233/http://wiretap.area.com/Gopher/Library/Classic/world90.txt |dead-url=yes |archive-date=1998-05-22 |year=1990 |accessdate=2007-01-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="arch" /&gt; and a border treaty{{clarify|What treaty?|date=December 2010}} concluded in 1981.&lt;ref name="dope"&gt;{{cite web |author=Adams, Cecil |title=What's up with the "neutral zones" near Saudi Arabia? |date=1991-02-01 |publisher=The Straight Dope |url=http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a3_304.html |accessdate=2007-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="arch" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cia2"&gt;{{cite web |author=Directorate of Intelligence |title=The World Factbook 1991 - Iraq - Saudi Arabia Neutral Zone (mirror) |url=http://wiretap.area.com/Gopher/Library/Classic/world91.txt |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19980522124329/http://wiretap.area.com/Gopher/Library/Classic/world91.txt |dead-url=yes |archive-date=1998-05-22 |year=1991 |accessdate=2007-01-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For unknown reasons, the treaty was not filed with the [[United Nations]]&lt;ref name="dope" /&gt; and nobody outside Iraq and Saudi Arabia was notified of the change or shown maps with details of the new boundary.&lt;ref name="dope" /&gt; As the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]] approached in early 1991, Iraq cancelled all international agreements with Saudi Arabia since 1968. Saudi Arabia responded by registering all previous boundary agreements negotiated with Iraq at the United Nations in June 1991.&lt;ref name="arch"&gt;{{cite web |author=Schofield, Richard |title=Arabian Boundary disputes, Archive Editions |publisher=Archive Editions |url=http://www.archiveeditions.co.uk/titledetails.asp?tid=34 |accessdate=2007-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; That ended the legal existence of the Saudi Arabian–Iraqi neutral zone.

Most official maps no longer show the diamond-shaped neutral zone but rather draw the border line approximately through the centre of the territory.

The '''St. Petersburg Human Rights Ordinance''' is a law that was passed in January 2002 in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]]. This law added sexual orientation as a protected status in housing, employment, and public accommodations. This movement was lead by Equality Florida's leader Nadine Smith, which took years to pass due to overruling in city meetings. [[Equality Florida]] is an advocacy group that advocates for equal LGBTQ rights for all Florida residents. This organization played a heavy hand in passing the first St. Petersburg Human rights ordinance .&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eqfl.org/Discrimination|title=Discrimination {{!}} Equality Florida|website=www.eqfl.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stpete.org/vision/points_of_pride.php|title=Mayor's Points of Pride - St. Petersburg|last=|first=|date=|website=www.stpete.org|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the years leading up to this event, the offices of St. Petersburg were consistently receiving mail from communities in an effort to address the city's failure to protect the LGBTQ community from discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sptimes.com|title=City to address human rights ordinance|last=Lapeter|first=Leonora|date=2001-11-02|work=The St. Petersburg Times|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill to pass sexual orientation as an addition to the human rights ordinance was previously denied in a county commissioners meeting in 2001. This means that discrimination against age, race, and gender was still prohibited in the workplace, real estate and in public, but sexual orientation is excluded from this law&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sptimes.com|title=Human rights ordinance omits sexual orientation|last=Humphrey|first=Joe|date=2000-10-06|work=St. Petersburg Times|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;. While supporters argued that this ordinance offers further protection in addition to civil rights laws, opposers of this ordinance argued that the city shouldn't have to further protect those with "alternate lifestyles".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sptimes.com/|title=Commission to vote on human rights ordinance|last=Tan|first=Shannon|date=2003-08-05|work=The St. Petersburg Times|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It wasn't until January of 2002 that the human right ordinance law was passed which protected discrimination against rage, gender, age AND sexual orientation in St. Petersburg. This later lead to the passing of Pinellas county's own human rights ordinance that protected against the same discriminations in 2008. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A '''referendum on repealing the constitution''' was held in [[Swaziland]] on 19 January 1964. It had been called by King [[Sobhuza II of Swaziland|Sobhuza II]] following the imposition of a constitution by the [[United Kingdom|British]] colonial authorities in 1963, which he opposed due to its democratic aspects and the weakening of his position.&lt;ref name=EISA/&gt; The constitution had been imposed on the colony due to the failure of the [[Swaziland National Council]] (which represented the Swazi traditional aristocracy) and the European Advisory Council (representing white settlers) to agree on one.

The referendum was boycotted by political parties, and the result (99.87% in favour of repealing)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sudd.ch/event.php?lang=en&amp;id=sz011964 Swasiland, 19.

{{split|Homosexuality in the Hebrew Bible|Homosexuality in the New Testament|date=December 2017}}
{{duplication|date=December 2017}}
Passages in the [[Hebrew Bible]] and [[New Testament]] have been interpreted as involving same-sex sexual acts and desires.

== Hebrew Bible ==
{{Main|Homosexuality in the Hebrew Bible}}
{{primary sources|date=January 2015}}

=== Leviticus 18 and 20 ===
{{Main|Leviticus 18}}
{{See also|Abomination (Bible)}}
Chapters 18 and 20 of [[Leviticus]] form part of the [[Holiness code]] and list [[Incest in the Bible|prohibited forms of intercourse]], including the following verses:

*"You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination." Chapter 18 verse 22&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Leviticus|18:22|ESV}} [[Bible Gateway]] provides [http://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Leviticus%2018:22 42 other English translations] of the verse.&lt;/ref&gt;
*"If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall surely be put to death; their blood is upon them." Chapter 20 verse 13&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Leviticus|20:13|ESV}}. [[Bible Gateway]] provides [http://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Leviticus%2020:13 42 other English translations] of the verse.&lt;/ref&gt;

These two verses have historically been interpreted by Jews and Christians as clear overall prohibitions against homosexual acts in general. More recent interpretations focus on its context as part of the [[Holiness Code]], a code of purity meant to distinguish the behavior of Israelites from the [[polytheistic]] [[Canaanites]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Coogan|first=Michael|title=God and Sex: What the Bible Really Says|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2_gPKQEACAAJ|accessdate=May 5, 2011|edition=1st|date=October 2010|publisher=Twelve. Hachette Book Group|location=New York, Boston|isbn=978-0-446-54525-9|oclc=505927356|page=135}} The Hebrew Bible only prohibits this practice for men. This is clearly seen by contrasting these verses with Lev. 18:23 and 20:15-16 respectively, where sex with animals is prohibited for both men and women. More recent interpretations focus on its context as part of the [[Holiness Code]], a code of purity meant to distinguish the behavior of Israelites from the [[Canaanites]]. {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N6nYCeP_w8YC&amp;pg=PA67 |last=Siker|first=Jeffrey S.|title=Homosexuality and Religion|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2007|isbn=978-0-313-33088-9|page=67 |via=Google Books|date= |accessdate=2013-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sodom and Gomorrah ===
{{Main|Sodom and Gomorrah}}
[[File:Sodoma - Aldegrever.jpg|thumb|''[[Lot (biblical person)|Lot]] prevents [[Sodom and Gomorrah|sodomites]] from raping the angels'', painting by [[Heinrich Aldegrever]], 1555]]

The story of the destruction of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]] in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] does not explicitly identify homosexuality as the sin for which they were destroyed. Some interpreters find the story of Sodom and a similar one in Judges 19 to condemn the violent rape of guests more than homosexuality,&lt;ref name="dict" /&gt; but the passage has historically been interpreted within Judaism and Christianity as a punishment for homosexuality due to the interpretation that the men of Sodom wished to rape the angels who retrieved Lot.&lt;ref name="dict" /&gt;

While the Jewish prophets spoke only of lack of charity as the sin of Sodom,&lt;ref name="crompton"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TfBYd9xVaXcC&amp;pg=PA37 |year=2006 |pages=37–39 |publisher=Harvard University Press |title=Homosexuality &amp; Civilization |first=Louis |last=Crompton }}&lt;/ref&gt; the exclusively sexual interpretation became so prevalent among Christian communities that the name "Sodom" became the basis of the word "[[sodomy]]", still a legal synonym for homosexual and non-procreative sexual acts, particularly anal or oral sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary
 | publisher = Merriam-Webster | url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sodomy | accessdate = 2012-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Jewish prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah, Amos and Zephaniah refer vaguely to the sin of Sodom,&lt;ref name="crompton" /&gt; Ezekiel specifies that the city was destroyed because of its commission of social injustice:&lt;ref name="dict" /&gt;
{{quote|Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride, fullness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy. And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me: therefore I took them away as I saw good.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Ezekiel|16:49–50|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Talmud]]ic tradition as written between c. 370 and 500 also interprets the sin of Sodom as lack of charity, with the attempted rape of the angels being a manifestation of the city's violation of the social order of hospitality;&lt;ref name="loader"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qJMA_zTueTMC&amp;pg=PA111 |title=J.A. Loader, '&amp;#39;A Tale of Two Cities: Sodom and Gomorrah in the Old Testament, Early Jewish and Early Christian Traditions'&amp;#39; |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; as does Jesus in the New Testament, for instance in [[Book of Matthew|Matthew]] 10:14–15 when he tells his disciples that the punishment for houses or towns that will not welcome them will be worse than that of Sodom and Gomorrah.&lt;ref name="crompton" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Matthew|10:14–15|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later traditions on Sodom's sin, such as ''[[Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs]]'', considered it to be an illicit form of heterosexual intercourse.&lt;ref name="greenberg" /&gt; In [[Epistle of Jude|Jude]] 1:7 the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah are stated to have been "giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh",&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jude|1:7|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; which may refer to homosexuality or to the lust of mortals after angels.&lt;ref name="dict" /&gt; Jewish writers [[Philo]] (d. AD 50) and [[Josephus]] (37&amp;nbsp;– c. 100) were the first to assert unambiguously that homosexuality was among the sins of Sodom.&lt;ref name="greenberg"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RKhFRgR-1awC&amp;pg=PA201|last=Greenberg|first=David F.|title=The Construction of Homosexuality|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1990|ISBN=978-0-226-30628-5|page=201|via=Google Books|accessdate=2013-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 1st century Jews commonly identified the sin of Sodom with homosexual practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IXVGBv2eEroC&amp;pg=PA117|last=Ellins|first=J. Harold|title=Sex in the Bible|publisher=Greenwood Publishing|year=2006|ISBN=0-275-98767-1|page=117|via=Google Books|accessdate=2013-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== David and Jonathan, Ruth and Naomi ===
{{Main|David and Jonathan#Homoeroticism}}
The account of the friendship between [[David and Jonathan]] in the [[Books of Samuel]] has been interpreted by traditional and mainstream Christians as a relationship only of [[Philia|affectionate regard]], but has been interpreted by some authors as of a [[sexual love|sexual nature]].&lt;ref&gt;Boswell, John. ''Same-sex Unions in Premodern Europe.'' New York: Vintage, 1994. (pp. 135–137)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Halperin, David M. ''One Hundred Years of Homosexuality.'' New York: Routledge, 1990. (p. 83)&lt;/ref&gt;

One relevant Bible passage on this issue is [[1 Samuel]] 18:1:
*And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul. (KJV)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Samuel%2018:1&amp;version=KJV 1 Samuel 18:1], King James version.&lt;/ref&gt;
Another relevant passage is [[2 Samuel]] 1:26, where David says:
*I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women. (KJV)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Samuel%201:26&amp;version=KJV 2 Samuel 1:26], King James version.&lt;/ref&gt;

The story of [[Ruth and Naomi]] in the Book of Ruth is also occasionally interpreted by contemporary scholars as the story of a lesbian couple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G5_H76kOJtkC&amp;pg=PA61 |title=Soliciting Interpretation|via=Google Books|date=2011-10-27 |accessdate=2013-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=May 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kE2k36XAkv4C&amp;pg=PA699&amp;lpg=PA699|title=Dictionary of the Old Testament: Wisdom, Poetry &amp; Writings|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=May 2017}}

=== Romans 1:26-27 ===
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:Saintpauloftarsus.jpg|thumb|250px|An early portrait of the Apostle Paul]] --&gt;

{{cquote|For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature: And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was meet.&lt;ref name="R1,26-27"&gt;{{Bibleverse||Romans|1:26–27|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
This passage has been debated by some 20th and 21st-century interpreters as to its relevance today and as to what it actually prohibits: although Christians of several denominations have historically maintained that this verse is a complete prohibition of all forms of homosexual activity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uVdmGZpSyr8C&amp;pg=PA58|last=Hertzog|first=Mark|page=58|isbn=0-8147-3530-4|publisher=NYU Press|year=1996|title=The lavender vote: Lesbians, gay men, and bisexuals in American electoral politics}}&lt;/ref&gt; some 20th and 21st-century authors contend the passage is not a blanket condemnation of homosexual acts, suggesting, among other interpretations, that the passage condemned heterosexuals who experimented with homosexual activity&lt;ref name="crompton" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kruse"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lSSWu9XsD3QC&amp;pg=PA111 |year=2012 |page=111 |publisher=Wm.

''New Testament Studies'' 45, no. 4 (1999): 533-52.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1 Corinthians 6:9-11 ===
In the context of the broader immorality of his audience, [[Paul the Apostle]] wrote in the [[1 Corinthians|First Epistle to the Corinthians]], chapter 6 verses 9-11,

{{cquote|Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God. And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.&lt;ref name="1C6,9-11"&gt;{{Bibleverse|1|Corinthians|6:9-11|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Greek word ''arsenokoitai'' ({{lang|grc|ἀρσενοκοῖται}}) in verse 9 has been debated for some time, and has been variously rendered as "abusers of themselves with mankind" (KJV), "sodomites" (YLT), or "men who have sex with men" (NIV).  Greek {{lang|grc|ἄῤῥην / ἄρσην}} [''arrhēn'' / ''arsēn''] means "male", and {{lang|grc|κοίτην}} [''koitēn''] "bed", with a sexual connotation.&lt;ref name="pregeant"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pregeant|first=Russell|editor=Stefan Koenemann &amp; Ronald A.

In the letter to the Corinthians, within the list of people who will not inherit the kingdom of God, Paul uses two Greek words: ''malakoi'' and ''arsenokoitai''. ''[[Malakoi]]'' is a common Greek word meaning, of things subject to touch, "soft" (used in Matthew 11:8 and Luke 7:25 to describe a garment); of things not subject to touch, "gentle"; and, of persons or modes of life, a number of meanings that include "[[pathicus|pathic]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=MALAKO%2FS |title=Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, '&amp;#39;A Greek-English Lexicon'&amp;#39;, entry μαλακός |publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowhere else in [[Malakia#Bible|scripture]] is malakoi used to describe a person. 

====Interpretation====
{{POV section|date=May 2016}}
Bishop [[Gene Robinson]] says the early church seemed to have understood it as a person with a "soft" or weak morality; later, it would come to denote (and be translated as) those who engage in masturbation, or "those who abuse themselves"; all we actually, factually, know about the word is that it means soft.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson 2012&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=May 2016}}

In a passage dealing with sexual misconduct, John speaks of ''arsenokoitia'' as active or passive and says that "many men even commit the sin of ''arsenokoitia'' with their wives".&lt;ref&gt;Τὸ μέντοι τῆς ἀρσενοκοιτίας μῦσος πολλοὶ καὶ μετὰ τῶν γυναικῶν αὐτῶν ἐκτελοῦσιν ([https://books.google.com/books?id=55TYAAAAMAAJ Migne PG 88, col. 1896]).&lt;/ref&gt; Although the constituent elements of the compound word refer to sleeping with men, he obviously does not use it to mean homosexual intercourse and appears to employ it for anal intercourse, not generic homosexual activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=John |last=Boswell |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v-MR5_AdG68C |title=Christianity, social tolerance, and homosexuality: gay people in Western Europe from the beginning of the Christian era to the fourteenth century |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1981 |isbn=978-0-226-06711-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particulars of Boswell's arguments are rejected by several scholars in a way qualified as persuasive by David F.

=== Jesus's discussion of marriage ===
In Matthew 19:3, Jesus is asked if a man can divorce his wife.  In that context,
{{cquote|He answered, ‘Have you not read that the one who made them at the beginning “made them male and female” [Genesis 1:27], and said, “For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh” [Genesis 2:24]? So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.’}}
(Matthew 19:4-6, NRSV translation; Mark 10:6-9 is a parallel text)

Robert Gagnon, an associate professor of New Testament studies, argues that Jesus's back-to-back references to Genesis 1 and Genesis 2 show that he "presupposed a two-sex requirement for marriage".&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. J. Gagnon, "Why the Disagreement over the Biblical Witness on Homosexual Practice?: A Response to David G. Myers and Letha Dawson Scanzoni, What God Has Joined Together?"

=== Matthew 8; Luke 7 ===
{{further information|Homosexuality in the New Testament#Pais|Healing the centurion's servant}}
In Matthew 8:5–13 and Luke 7:1–10, Jesus heals a centurion's servant who is dying. According to James Neill, the Greek term "pais" used for the servant in Matthew's account almost always had a sexual connotation.&lt;ref name="Neill" /&gt; In support of this view, he remarks that the word ''pais'', along with the word "erasthai" (to love) is the root of the English word "[[pederasty]]".&lt;ref name="Neill"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1ha9GgWNmy0C&amp;pg=PA216 |title=The Origins and Role of Same-Sex Relations In Human Societies |first=James |last=Neill |publisher=McFarland |page=216 |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He sees in the fact that, in Luke's parallel account, the centurion's servant is described as "valued highly"&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Luke|7:2|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the centurion an indication of a homosexual relationship between the two, and says that the Greek word "doulos" (a slave) used of him in Luke's account suggests he may have been a sex slave.&lt;ref name="Neill" /&gt; Daniel A. Helminiak writes that the word ''pais'' was sometimes given a sexual meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O4qhggrJFdYC&amp;pg=PA192|last=Helminiak|first=Daniel A.|title=Sex and the Sacred|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|ISBN=978-1-136-57075-9|page=192|via=Google Books|accessdate=2013-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Donald Wold states that its normal meaning is "boy", "child" or "slave" and its application to a boy lover escapes notice in the standard lexica of [[Liddell and Scott]] and [[Bauer lexicon|Bauer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K0XRIb2NCv4C&amp;pg=PA257|last=Moore|first=Stephen D.|title=God's Beauty Parlor|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=2001|ISBN=978-0-8047-4332-7|page=257|via=Google Books|accessdate=2013-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek-English Lexicon of Liddell and Scott registers three meanings of the word παῖς (''pais''): a child in relation to descent (son or daughter); a child in relation to age (boy or girl); a slave or servant (male or female). In her detailed study of the episode in Matthew and Luke, Wendy Cotter dismisses as very unlikely the idea that the use of the Greek word "pais" indicated a sexual relationship between the centurion and the young slave.&lt;ref name=Cotter&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nz-E3rdDbpEC&amp;pg=PA125|last=Cotter|first=Wendy|title=The Christ of the Miracle Stories|publisher=Baker Academic|year=2010|ISBN=978-0-8010-3950-8|page=125|via=Google Books|accessdate=2013-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neill himself compares the meanings of Greek "pais" to those of French "garçon", which "most commonly means 'boy'" even though it can also be used to mean "waiter".

Matthew's account has parallels in Luke 7:1–10 and John 4:46–53. There are major differences between John's account and those of the two synoptic writers, but such differences exist also between the two synoptic accounts, with next to nothing of the details in Luke 7:2–6 being present also in Matthew.&lt;ref name=Evans&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iZC-tdB35bAC&amp;pg=PA169|editor-first=Craig A.|editor-last=Evans|title=The Bible Knowledge Commentary: Matthew-Luke|publisher=David C. Cook|year=2003|ISBN=978-0-7814-3868-1|page=169|via=Google Books|accessdate=2014-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commentary of Craig A. Evans states that the word ''pais'' used by Matthew may be that used in the hypothetical source known as [[Q source|Q]] used by both Matthew and Luke and, since it can mean either son or slave, it became ''doulos'' (slave) in Luke and ''huios'' (son) in John.&lt;ref name=Evans /&gt; Writers who admit John 4:46–53 as a parallel passage generally interpret Matthew's ''pais'' as "child" or "boy", while those who exclude it see it as meaning "servant" or "slave".&lt;ref name=Voorwinde /&gt;

Theodore W. Jennings Jr. and Tat-Siong Benny Liew write that Roman historical data about patron-client relationships and about same-sex relations among soldiers support the view that the ''pais'' in Matthew's account is the centurion's "boy-love" and that the centurion did not want Jesus to enter his house for fear the boy would be enamoured of Jesus instead. D.B. Saddington writes that while he does not exclude the possibility, the evidence the two put forward supports "neither of these interpretations",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|jstor=27638351|title=The Centurion in Matthew 8:5–13: Consideration of the Proposal of Theodore W. Jennings, Jr., and Tat-Siong Benny Liew}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Stephen Voorwinde saying of their view that "the argument on which this understanding is based has already been soundly refuted in the scholarly literature"&lt;ref name=Voorwinde&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E49LP5IJ0JUC&amp;pg=PA18|last=Voorwinde|first=Stephen|title=Jesus' Emotions in the Gospels|publisher=Continuum|year=2011|ISBN=978-0-567-43061-8|page=18|via=Google Books|accessdate=2014-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Wendy Cotter saying that they fail to take account of Jewish condemnation of pederasty.&lt;ref name=Cotter /&gt; Others interpret Matthew's ''pais'' merely as a boy servant, not a male lover, and read nothing sexual into Luke's "valued highly".

=== Matthew 19:12 ===
In Matthew 19:12, Jesus speaks of [[eunuch]]s who were born as such, eunuchs who were made so by others, and eunuchs who choose to live as such for the kingdom of heaven.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Matthew|19:12|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus's reference to eunuchs who were born as such has been interpreted by some commentators as having to do with homosexual orientation; [[Clement of Alexandria]], for instance, is citing in his book "Stromata" (chapter III,1,1&lt;ref&gt;Clemente de Alejandria: Stromata II-III, Fuentes Patristicas, vol.10 (Marcelo Merino Rodriguez ed.), Madrid 1998, p. 315&lt;/ref&gt;) an earlier interpretation from [[Basilides]] on it that some men, from birth, are naturally averse to women and should not marry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZXAVf8m_HKgC&amp;pg=PA333|title=Homosexuality (DeYoung)|first=James B.|last=DeYoung|publisher=Kregel Academic|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The first category – those eunuchs who have been so from birth – is the closest description we have in the Bible of what we understand today as homosexual."&lt;ref name="thechurch"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Church and the homosexual |first=John J. |last=McNeill |pages=64–65 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UD-5Gnn87W8C&amp;pg=PA63 |year=1993 |publisher=Beacon Press |edition=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Acts 8 ===
{{Main|Ethiopian eunuch}}
The Ethiopian eunuch, an early gentile convert described in Acts 8, has been interpreted by some commentators as an early gay Christian, based on the fact that the word "eunuch" in the Bible was not always used literally, as in Matthew 19:12.&lt;ref name="thechurch" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McNeill|first=John J.|title=Freedom, Glorious Freedom: The Spiritual Journey to the Fullness of Life for Gays, Lesbians, and Everybody Else|year=2010|publisher=Lethe|page=211 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C0oWZsYv2RIC&amp;pg=PA211}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religious commentators generally suggest that the combination of "eunuch" together with the title "court official" indicates a literal eunuch — not a homosexual — who would have been excluded from the Temple by the restriction in Deuteronomy 23:1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=New Testament Commentary, Volume 6: Acts 1–12 |first=John |last=MacArthur|page=254 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2Vp7c2hCPUAC&amp;pg=PA254 |year=1994|publisher=Moody|isbn=0-8024-0759-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Acts of the Apostles |first1=Luke T.|last1=Johnson|first2=Daniel J. |last2=Harrington|page=155|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oVLF53DjFPsC&amp;pg=PA155 |year=1992|publisher=Liturgical Press|isbn=0-8146-5807-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was first published by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine on May 6, 1991, as an eight-page cover story,&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite news |last=Behar |first=Richard |title=Scientology: The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=May 6, 1991 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,972865,00.html |accessdate=March 20, 2014|pages=50-57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=healy/&gt; and was later published in ''[[Reader's Digest]]'' in October 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Behar |first=Richard |last2=Burton|first2=Thomas M. |title= A Dangerous Cult Goes Mainstream |work= [[Reader's Digest]] |date= October 1991 |url= http://www.skeptictank.org/hs/dancult.htm |accessdate= October 25, 2007 |pages=87-92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Behar had previously published an article on Scientology in ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine. He stated that he was investigated by [[lawyer|attorneys]] and [[private investigator]]s affiliated with the [[Church of Scientology]] while researching the ''Time'' article, and that investigators contacted his friends and family as well. Behar's article covers topics including [[L. Ron Hubbard]] and the development of Scientology, its [[Scientology controversies|controversies]] over the years and [[Scientology and law|history of litigation]], [[Scientology and psychiatry|conflict with psychiatry]] and the U.S. [[Internal Revenue Service]], the [[Scientology controversies#Noah Lottick|suicide of Noah Lottick]], its [[Scientology status by country|status as a religion]], and its [[Scientology as a business|business dealings]].

After the article's publication, the Church of Scientology mounted a public relations campaign to address issues in the piece. It took out advertisements in ''[[USA Today]]'' for twelve weeks, and Church leader [[David Miscavige]] was interviewed by [[Ted Koppel]] on ''[[Nightline]]'' about what he considered to be an objective bias by the article's author. Miscavige alleged that the article was actually driven by the company [[Eli Lilly and Company|Eli Lilly]], because of Scientology's efforts against the drug [[Prozac]]. The Church of Scientology brought a [[libel]] suit against [[Time Warner]] and Behar, and sued ''Reader's Digest'' in multiple countries in Europe in an attempt to stop the article's publication there. The suit against Time Warner was dismissed in 1996, and the Church of Scientology's petition for a [[writ]] of [[certiorari]] to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] was denied in 2001.

Behar received awards in honor of his work on the article, including the [[Gerald Loeb Award]], the [[Worth Bingham Prize]], and the [[Conscience-in-Media Award]]. The article has had ramifications in the current treatment of Scientology in the media, with some publications theorizing that journalists are wary of the [[litigation]] that Time Warner went through. The article has been cited by [[Anderson Cooper]] on [[CNN]], in a story on ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]''{{'s}} 2007 program "[[Scientology and Me]]" on the [[BBC]], and has been used as a reference for background on the history of Scientology, in books from both the [[cult]] and [[new religious movement]] perspectives.

Before penning "The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power", Behar had written a 1986 article in ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine, "The Prophet and Profits of Scientology", which reported on the Church of Scientology's business dealings and [[L. Ron Hubbard]]'s financial success.&lt;ref name=behar86&gt;{{cite news |last= Behar |first= Richard |title= The Prophet and Profits of Scientology |work=[[Forbes]] |date= October 27, 1986 |page=314}}&lt;/ref&gt; Behar wrote that during research for "The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power", he and a ''Time'' contributing editor were themselves investigated by ten attorneys and six private investigators affiliated with the Church of Scientology.&lt;ref name=bostonherald/&gt;&lt;ref name=aim/&gt;&lt;ref name=ayella/&gt;&lt;ref name=linn&gt;{{cite news |last= Linn |first= Virginia |first2=Alana |last2= Semuels |title= PostScript: When scientologists aren't so clear: Leaders of the Church of Scientology have long had the reputation of being uncooperative with the media.

Behar wrote that the motive of these operatives was to "threaten, harass and discredit him".&lt;ref name=bostonherald/&gt;&lt;ref name=linn/&gt; He later learned that the Church of Scientology had assigned its head private investigator to direct the Church's investigation into Behar.&lt;ref name=linn/&gt; ''[[Anderson Cooper 360°]]'' reported that Behar had been contacted by Church of Scientology attorneys numerous times while doing research on the article.&lt;ref name=cooper/&gt; The parents of [[Scientology controversies#Noah Lottick|Noah Lottick]], a Scientologist who had committed suicide, cooperated with ''Time'' and ''Reader's Digest''.&lt;ref name=survey/&gt;

While none of the parties assigned blame, they expressed misgivings about his death. Initially, his father had thought that Scientology was similar to [[Dale Carnegie]]'s self-improvement techniques; however, after his ordeal, the elder Lottick came to believe that the organization is a "school for psychopaths".&lt;ref name=leisure96&gt;{{cite court |litigants= Church of Scientology International v.

===Church of Scientology's response===
The Church of Scientology responded to the publication of "The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power" by taking out color full-page ads in ''[[USA Today]]'' in May and June 1991, on every weekday for twelve weeks, denouncing the ''Time'' magazine cover article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Staff |title= Scientology's Critical Ads |work= [[The New York Times]] |page=D5 |date= May 31, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two official Church of Scientology responses were titled "Facts vs. Fiction, A Correction of Falsehoods Contained in the May 6, 1991, Issues of ''Time Magazine''", and "The Story That ''Time'' Couldn't Tell".&lt;ref name=miller&gt;{{cite book |last= Miller |first= Timothy |title= America's Alternative Religions |publisher= SUNY Press |year= 1995 |isbn= 0-7914-2398-0 |page= 390}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the [[advertising]] campaign, Scientologists distributed 88-page bound booklets which disputed points from Behar's article.&lt;ref name=krueger&gt;{{cite news |last= Krueger |first= Curtis |title= Scientology lambasts Time magazine in ad |work= St. Petersburg Times |page= 1B |date= May 29, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Fact vs. Fiction" piece was a {{convert|1/4|in|cm|adj=mid|-thick}} booklet, which criticized Behar's article and asserted "Behar's article omits the information on the dozens of community service programs conducted by Scientologists&amp;nbsp;... which have been acknowledged by community officials".&lt;ref name=cote&gt;{{cite news |last= Cote |first= Neil |title= Church whiffs while trying to whomp Wogs |work= [[The Tampa Tribune]] |page= 1 |date= May 10, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the advertisements in ''USA Today'' accused ''Time'' of promoting [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Nazi Germany]], and featured a 1936 issue of ''Time'' which had Hitler's picture on the front cover.&lt;ref name=duckworth&gt;{{cite news |last= Duckworth |first= Erika N. |title= Church of Scientology Attacks Time |work= Greensboro News &amp; Record |page= B3 |date= May 29, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Church of Scientology sent out a news release condemning ''Time''{{'s}} "horrible history of supporting fascism", and said that the article was written because ''Time'' had been pressured by "vested interests".&lt;ref name=krueger/&gt; When asked by the ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'' whether this was the case, ''Time'' [[Editor in chief|Executive Editor]] Richard Duncan responded "Good Lord, no".&lt;ref name=krueger/&gt; [[Heber Jentzsch]], at the time president of Church of Scientology International, issued a four-page news release which stated "Advertising is the only way the church could be assured of getting its message and its side of the story out to the public without the same vested interests behind the Time article distorting it".&lt;ref name=duckworth/&gt;

After the advertising run critiquing ''Time'' magazine in ''USA Today'' had completed, the Church of Scientology mounted a $3 million public relations campaign about Scientology in ''USA Today'', in June 1991.&lt;ref name=holifield&gt;{{cite news |last= Holifield |first= Rhonda |title= Scientologists answer critics with advertising |work= St. Petersburg Times |date= June 29, 1991 |url= https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/sptimes/access/50640730.html?dids=50640730:50640730&amp;FMT=FT&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Church of Scientology placed a 48-page advertising supplement in 1.8&amp;nbsp;million copies of ''USA Today''.&lt;ref name=holifield/&gt; In a statement to the ''St. Petersburg Times'', Scientology spokesman Richard Haworth explained "What we are trying to do is put the actual facts of [[Dianetics]] and Scientology out there".&lt;ref name=holifield/&gt;

In response to the Church of Scientology's claims of inaccuracies in the article, a lawyer for ''Time'' responded "We've reviewed all of their allegations, and find nothing wrong with the ''Time'' story."&lt;ref name=howard&gt;{{cite news |last= Howard |first= Lucy |author2=Gregory Cerio |title= Scientology Takes On Time |work= [[Newsweek]] |page= 8 |date= June 10, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1991, ''[[Newsweek]]'' reported that staffers for ''Time'' said they had received calls from a man claiming to be a [[paralegal]] for ''Time'', who asked them if they had signed a confidentiality form about the article.&lt;ref name=howard/&gt; ''Time'' editors sent staffers a computer memo, warning them about calls related to the article, and staffers told ''Newsweek'' that "sources named in the story say detectives have asked about their talks with Time".&lt;ref name=howard/&gt; A Church of Scientology spokesman called the claims "scurrilous".&lt;ref name=howard/&gt;

On February 14, 1992, Scientology leader [[David Miscavige]] gave [[Ted Koppel]] his first interview on Scientology on the [[ABC News]] program ''[[Nightline]]''.&lt;ref name=abcnews&gt;{{cite news |first1= Ted |last1= Koppel |author1-link= Ted Koppel |first2= Forest |last2= Sawyer |orig-year=February 14, 1992 |title= Scientology Leader Gave ABC First-Ever Interview: David Miscavige, Scientology Leader and Best Man at Tom Cruise's Wedding, Spoke to ABC News' 'Nightline' in 1992 |work= [[Nightline]] |publisher= [[ABC News]] |pages= 1, 3 |date= November 18, 2006 |url= http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/story?id=2664713&amp;page=1 |accessdate= October 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program noted that Scientology has vocal critics and cited Behar's 1991 article. Behar appeared on the program and gave his opinion of why individuals join Scientology, stating that the organization's "ulterior motive" is really to get people to take high-priced [[auditing (Scientology)|audit counseling]].&lt;ref name=abcnews/&gt; Behar stated on the program that he had evidence that members of the Church of Scientology had obtained his personal phone records.&lt;ref name=abcnews/&gt; Later in the program, Koppel questioned Miscavige on the Church of Scientology's response to the ''Time'' magazine article, particularly the $3 million the church spent advertising in ''USA Today''.&lt;ref name=abcnews/&gt; Miscavige explained that the first three weeks of the advertising campaign was meant to correct falsehoods from the ''Time'' article, and the rest of the twelve-week campaign was dedicated to informing the public about Scientology. Koppel asked Miscavige what specifically had upset him about the ''Time'' article, and Miscavige called Behar "a hater".&lt;ref name=abcnews/&gt; Miscavige noted that Behar had written an article on Scientology and the Internal Revenue Service three years before he began work on the ''Time'' piece, and made allegations that Behar had attempted to get two Scientologists kidnapped. When Koppel questioned Miscavige further on this, Miscavige said that individuals had contacted Behar after an earlier article, and Behar had told them to "kidnap Scientologists out".&lt;ref name=abcnews/&gt; Koppel pressed further, noting that this was a serious charge to make, and asked Miscavige if his allegations were accurate, why he had not pressed charges for attempted kidnapping. Miscavige said Koppel was "missing the issue", and said that his real point was that he thought the article was not an objective piece.&lt;ref name=abcnews/&gt;

Miscavige alleged on ''Nightline'' that the article itself was published as a result of a request by [[Eli Lilly and Company]], because of "the damage we had caused to their killer drug Prozac".&lt;ref name=abcnews/&gt; When Koppel asked Miscavige if he had affidavits or evidence to this effect, Miscavige responded "You think they'd admit it?"&lt;ref name=abcnews/&gt; Miscavige stated that "Eli Lilly ordered a reprint of 750,000&amp;nbsp;copies of ''Time'' magazine before it came out", and that his attempts to investigate the matter with Eli Lilly and associated advertising companies were not successful.&lt;ref name=abcnews/&gt;

In a February 1992 issue of ''Time'', editor Elizabeth Valk congratulated Behar on his Conscience-in-Media Award, stating "Needless to say, we are delighted and proud".&lt;ref name=valk/&gt; Valk noted that the honor had only been awarded seven times in the previous seventeen years of its existence.&lt;ref name=valk/&gt; Managing editor Henry Muller also congratulated Behar in an April 1992 issue of ''Time''.&lt;ref name=muller&gt;{{cite news |last= Muller |first= Henry |title= From the Managing Editor |work= Time |date= April 13, 1992 |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,975279,00.html |accessdate= October 25, 2007 |page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
Several authors have commented on the article and used it as a reference for background on Scientology.&lt;ref name=healy/&gt;&lt;ref name=cooper/&gt; Not all analysis of the article has been positive. [[David Healy (psychiatrist)|David Healy]]'s book criticizing the [[pharmaceutical industry]], ''Let Them Eat Prozac'', was critical: "The ''Time'' article was way over the top. Even [[Saddam Hussein]] was portrayed less badly." Healy addressed the article's claim that lawsuits were one of the Church's key tactics against enemies. He noted that the [[Citizens Commission on Human Rights]] (CCHR), a Church of Scientology affiliated group discussed in the article, had filed a petition with the [[Food and Drug Administration]] inquiring what it was going to do about [[Prozac]]. Healy dismissed the notion that CCHR engaged in "orchestrated campaigns", writing that very few of the 50 lawsuits filed against Prozac were related to the Church of Scientology.&lt;ref name=healy/&gt; [[Mark Silk]] criticized Behar's article in his book ''Unsecular Media: Making News of Religion in America''.&lt;ref name=silk&gt;{{cite book |last= Silk |first= Mark |title= Unsecular Media: Making News of Religion in America |publisher= University of Illinois Press |year= 1995 |pages= 96–97 |isbn= 0-252-06742-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silk classified the work among what he referred to as the "false-prophecy [[Literary topos|topos]]", and characterized Behar's account of Noah Lottick's suicide as an "[[atrocity tale]]".&lt;ref name=silk/&gt;

''Insane Therapy'' noted that Scientology "achieved more notoriety&amp;nbsp;... with the publication of the journalist Richard Behar's highly critical article".&lt;ref name=ayella/&gt; ''[[Larson's Book of World Religions and Alternative Spirituality]]'' described the cover design of the article as it appeared in ''Time'', writing that it "shouted" the headline from the magazine cover.&lt;ref name=larson/&gt; In a 2005 piece, ''[[Salon.com]]'' magazine noted that for those interested in the Church of Scientology, the ''Time'' article still remains a "milestone in news coverage", and that those who back the Church believe it was "an outrageously biased account".&lt;ref name=salon&gt;{{cite news |last= Strupp |first= Joe |title= The press vs. Scientology: After years of conflict, the church and the media seem to have reached a truce.

==Legacy==
The Church of Scientology's use of private investigators was cited in a 1998 article in the ''[[Boston Herald]]'', and compared to Behar's experiences when researching "The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power".&lt;ref name=bostonherald/&gt; After the paper ran a five-part series of critical articles in 1998, Church of Scientology President [[Heber Jentzsch]] confirmed that a private investigative firm was hired to look into the personal life of Joseph Mallia, the reporter who wrote the articles.&lt;ref name=bostonherald/&gt; In a later piece titled "Church of Scientology probes Herald reporter—Investigation follows pattern of harassment" this investigation was likened to Behar's assertions of harassment, as well as other reporters' experiences from 1974, 1988, and 1997.&lt;ref name=bostonherald&gt;{{cite news |last= MacLaughlin |first= Jim |first2=Andrew |last2= Gully |title= Church of Scientology probes Herald reporter: Investigation follows pattern of harassment |work= [[Boston Herald]] |date= March 19, 1998 |page=004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the history of conflict between ''Reader's Digest'' and Scientology, the writer of a 2005 cover story on [[Tom Cruise]] agreed to certain demands, including giving Scientology issues equal play in the writer's profile of Cruise, submitting questions for Cruise to Church of Scientology handlers, and sending the writer of the article to a one-day Church immersion course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Staff |title= Reader's Digest on Cruise Control |work= [[Radar Online]] |date= June 8, 2005 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20050611003009/http://www.radaronline.com/fresh-intelligence/2005/06/08/index.php |url= http://www.radaronline.com/fresh-intelligence/2005/06/08/index.php |archive-date= June 11, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2005, an article in ''Salon'' questioned whether the tactics of the Church's litigation and private investigations of Time Warner and other media sources had succeeded in decreasing the amount of investigative journalism pieces on Scientology in the press.&lt;ref name=salon/&gt; A 2005 article in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' cited the article, and came to the determination that the Church of Scientology's lawsuit against Time Warner "served to warn off other potential investigations", and that "The chill evidently lingers still".&lt;ref name=sundaytimes&gt;{{cite news |last= Rowan |first= David |title= Tom, three questions for you: The film star should be facing robust media interrogation about Scientology, but there is craven silence |work= [[The Sunday Times]] |date= July 12, 2005 |url= http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article542911.ece |accessdate= October 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the interview, Anderson Cooper quoted directly from "The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power" article, when asking Rinder about the history of [[Operation Snow White]], and if those tactics were currently used by the Church.&lt;ref name=cooper/&gt; Rinder answered by stating that the individuals involved with Operation Snow White were no longer involved in Church of Scientology activities, and that the incident was "ancient history". Cooper then again referenced the ''Time'' magazine article noting that Behar asserted that he was illegally investigated by Scientology contacts during research for his article.&lt;ref name=cooper/&gt; Cooper questioned Rinder on the dismissed lawsuit against [[Time Warner]], and Rinder acknowledged that all of the Church of Scientology's appeals against Time Warner were eventually rejected.&lt;ref name=cooper/&gt;

The '''Truth in Lending Act''' '''(TILA)''' of 1968 is a [[United States federal law]] designed to promote the informed use of [[consumer credit]], by requiring disclosures about its terms and cost to standardize the manner in which costs associated with borrowing are calculated and disclosed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Intro to Business|last1=Dlabay|first1=Les R. |last2=Burrow |first2=James L. |last3=Brad |first3=Brad |year=2009|publisher=South-Western [[Cengage Learning]]|location=[[Mason, Ohio]]|isbn=978-0-538-44561-0 |page=469}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TILA also gives consumers the right to cancel certain credit transactions that involve a [[lien]] on a consumer's principal dwelling, regulates certain [[credit card]] practices, and provides a means for fair and timely resolution of credit billing disputes. With the exception of certain high-cost [[mortgage loan]]s, TILA does not regulate the charges that may be imposed for consumer credit. Rather, it requires uniform or standardized disclosure of costs and charges so that consumers can shop. It also imposes limitations on home equity plans that are subject to the requirements of {{USCFR|12|1026|40}} and certain "higher-priced" mortgage loans (HPMLs) that are subject to the requirements of {{USCFR|12|1026|35}}. The regulation prohibits certain acts or practices in connection with credit secured by a consumer's principal [[dwelling]].

==History==
The Truth in Lending Act was originally Title I of the [[Consumer Credit Protection Act]], {{USStatute|90|321|82|146|1968|05|29}}. The regulations implementing the statute, which are known as "Regulation Z", are codified at {{USCFR|12|226}}. Most of the specific requirements imposed by TILA are found in Regulation Z, so a reference to the requirements of TILA usually refers to the requirements contained in Regulation Z, as well as the statute itself.&lt;ref name="FRB-regz"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/bankinforeg/reglisting.htm#Z |title=Federal Reserve System Banking Information and Regulation |date=July 30, 2008|work=Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System |publisher=FRB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From TILA's inception,  the authority to implement the statute by issuing regulations was given to the Federal Reserve Board (FRB). However, effective July 21, 2011, TILA's general rule making authority was transferred to the [[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]] (CFPB), whose authority was established pursuant to provisions enacted by the passage of the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] in July 2010. Any forthcoming regulations implementing the statute, which are also formally referred to as Regulation Z, will be codified at {{USCFR|12|1026}} and attempt to mirror the FRB's Regulation Z whenever feasible.&lt;ref name="CFPB-02-13-13"&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.consumerfinance.gov/newsroom/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-lays-out-implementation-plan-for-new-mortgage-rules/ |title=CFPB Lays Out Implementation Plan for New Mortgage Rules |date=February 13, 2013|work=Consumer Financial Protection Bureau |publisher=CFPB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Federal Reserve will retain some limited rule making authority under TILA for loans made by certain motor vehicle dealers, and for certain other provisions.

The TILA introduced the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) calculation mandated for all consumer lenders.  Certain misleading interest rate calculations used previously, mainly on auto loans, were barred.  For more than a decade, consumer loans were reported by APR in an economically meaningful way.  Then in the 1980s the auto manufacturers began to exploit a loophole in TILA and its administration. Neither the Act nor its administrators adequately differentiated between "amount financed" and "finance charges," two terms that appear on the TILA required disclosure statements.  By "bundling" the price of the car and its financing charges (which come from the auto maker's captive finance company), auto makers were able to shift money between the two categories, even to eliminating the financing charge entirely.  Thus "zero percent APR" financing was born.

Typical offers from auto companies are "Zero Percent APR financing available or $1,000 rebate."  The consumer who elects "zero percent" financing gives up a $1,000 rebate (reduction in car price).  Effectively, he or she pays $1,000 to get the "interest free" loan.  Since only auto makers can do this type of bundling, banks, credit unions and other competitors are left at a disadvantage.  They must disclose true APR rates while the auto makers can claim no interest costs.  In the process, the typical consumer is left with a complex finance problem.  "Zero percent" financing can cost a lot less, or a lot more than conventional financing with a non-auto maker institution.

==Organization==
The regulation is divided into subparts.

Subpart B relates to open-end credit lines ([[revolving credit]] accounts), which includes credit card accounts and home-equity lines of credit (HELOCs).

Subpart C relates to closed-end credit, such as home-purchase loans and motor vehicle loans with a fixed loan term. It contains rules on disclosures, treatment of credit balances, [[annual percentage rate]] calculations, right of rescission,non requirements, and advertising.

Subpart D contains rules on oral disclosures, [[Spanish language]] disclosure in [[Puerto Rico]], record retention, effect on state laws, state exemptions (which only apply to states that had Truth in Lending-type laws prior to the Federal Act), and rate limitations.

==Right of rescission==
{{unsourced section|date=May 2018}}
For certain transactions secured by a borrower's principle dwelling, TILA requires that the borrower be granted three business days following loan consummation to rescind the transaction. The right of rescission allows borrowers time to reexamine the credit agreement and cost disclosures, as well as to reconsider whether they want to place their homes at risk by offering it as security for the credit.  Each borrower and any person who has a vested interest in the property may exercise the right to rescind until midnight of the third business day following consummation, or delivery of all material disclosures, whichever occurs last.  If the required rescission notice or material TILA disclosures are inaccurate or not delivered, the borrowers right to rescind may be extended from three days after consummation to up to three years.

When a borrower rescinds, the security interest becomes void and the borrower is not liable for any amount, including finance charges.  The bank must return any money or property given to anyone in connection with the transaction within 20 calendar days and remove any record of security interest that the bank may have taken for the new loan.  Until the rescission period has ended, the bank may not 1) disperse funds other than to a valid escrow account, 2) perform any services, or 3) deliver any materials.

The right of rescission does not apply to loans that are obtained for the purpose of purchasing a home, nor does it apply to a refinance or consolidation of a home loan with the same creditor unless the amount refinanced or consolidated exceeds the unpaid balance on the existing debt.

==Exemptions==
TILA requirements do not apply to the following types of loans or credit:

* Credit extended primarily for business, agricultural or commercial purposes;
* Credit extended to an entity (not a person, with an exception for certain trusts for tax or estate planning), including government agencies or instrumentalities.
* Credit in excess of an annually adjusted threshold, not secured by real estate or personal property, used or expected to be used as a principal dwelling;

The [[Joint Statement]] by the [[United States|USA]] and the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] (the [[superpower]]s of the time) was made to counteract state activity to restrict the passage of ships carrying potentially hazardous materials through states' [[territorial sea]], culminating mainly from the [[Basel Convention]] 1989. It was made on 23 September 1989.

It made it clear that the text of the 1982 [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] (UNCLOS) reflected [[customary international law]], and every ship, regardless of cargo, does not need permission to enter another state's [[territorial sea]] so long as it adheres to the definition of [[innocent passage]] in Article 19 of [[UNCLOS]].

'''''Virgin Killer''''' is the fourth studio album by German [[Rock music|rock]] band [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]]. It was released in 1976 and was the band's first album to attract attention outside Europe.&lt;ref name="twp"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Yasui | first = Todd Allan| title = The Sign of the Scorpions; The West German Metal Meisters' Tour de Force | newspaper = [[The Washington Post]] | pages = F3 | date = 30 August 1988 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title is described as being a reference to time as the killer of [[innocence]].&lt;ref name="title"&gt;{{cite web |title=Scorpions Guitarist: We Wanted To 'Make A Masterpiece For Our Own History' |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/BlabberMouth.Net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=82038 |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |date=3 October 2007 |accessdate=12 May 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606091751/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/BlabberMouth.Net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=82038 |archive-date=6 June 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original cover featured a nude [[puberty|prepubescent]] girl, which stirred controversy in the UK, US and elsewhere. As a result, the album was re-issued with a different cover in some countries.

In December 2008, the image again gave rise to [[Internet Watch Foundation and Wikipedia|controversy]] when the British [[Internet Watch Foundation]] placed certain pages from [[Wikipedia]] on its internet blacklist, since it considered the image to be "potentially illegal"  under the [[Protection of Children Act 1978]].&lt;ref name="bbc 6 music"&gt;{{cite web |title=Scorpions censored|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/6music/news/20081208_scorpians.shtml |publisher=BBC |date=8 December 2008 |accessdate=9 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in much of the UK being prevented from editing Wikipedia, and significant public debate on the decision. The decision was reversed by the IWF after four days of blocking.&lt;ref name="IWF"/&gt;

The success of ''Virgin Killer'' was similar to other Scorpions albums featuring [[Uli Jon Roth]] as lead guitarist; it "failed to attain any serious attention in the United States" but was "quite popular in Japan"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Weber, Barry |title=Scorpions  |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p5370/biography|pure_url=yes}} |publisher=Allmusic |accessdate=12 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it peaked at number 32 in the charts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Sharpe-Young, Garry |title=Scorpions discography |url=http://www.rockdetector.com/discography,7799.sm |publisher=[[Rockdetector]] |accessdate=12 May 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071228125138/http://www.rockdetector.com/discography,7799.sm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 28 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album was another step in the band's shift from [[psychedelic music]] to [[hard rock]].&lt;ref name="Buck"&gt;{{cite book |last=Berelian |first=Essi |editor=Buckley, Peter |editor2=Buckley, Jonathan |title=The Rough Guide to Rock |publisher=Rough Guides |year=2003 |location=London |page=909 |isbn=1-84353-105-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critic Vincent Jeffries of [[AllMusic]] contends in hindsight that the album was "the first of four studio releases that really defined the Scorpions and their urgent metallic sound that was to become highly influential".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Jeffries, Vincent |title=''Virgin Killer'' review |url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r17519|pure_url=yes}} |publisher=AllMusic |accessdate=12 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also counts the title track and "Pictured Life" among the "all-time Scorpions standouts". Among the band members, Uli Jon Roth considers ''Virgin Killer'' and the previous release ''[[In Trance]]'' as his favourite Scorpions albums.&lt;ref name="RothRules"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;We didn't actually have the idea. It was the record company. The record company guys were like, "Even if we have to go to jail, there's no question that we'll release that." On the song "Virgin Killer", time is the virgin killer. But then, when we had to do the interviews about it, we said "Look, listen to the lyrics and then you'll know what we're talking about. We're using this only to get attention. That's what we do." Even the girl, when we met her fifteen years later, had no problem with the cover. Growing up in Europe, sexuality, of course not with children, was very normal. The lyrics really say it all. Time is the virgin killer. A kid comes into the world very naive, they lose that naiveness and then go into this life losing all of this getting into trouble. That was the basic idea about all of it.&lt;ref name="title" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a separate interview, Schenker also notes that he thought the cover art was a "great thing" and that he had "pushed the band to really stay behind it" as he felt that people would "think differently" when they looked at the lyrics and realized that the cover art was only being used as "a symbol of the lyrics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Trunk, Russell A. |title=Scorpions: Yet Another Sting In The Tale! |url=http://www.annecarlini.com/ex_interviews.php?id=805 |publisher=Annecarlini.com |accessdate=12 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2008 interview, Schenker added "We would never again do something like this".&lt;ref name="sz"/&gt;&lt;!--'So etwas wie mit dem Mädchen würden wir nie wieder machen", sagte Scorpions-Gründer Rudolf Schenker kürzlich in einem Interview.'--&gt; The band's former lead guitarist [[Uli Jon Roth]] notes that the cover art of the "old Scorpion albums" were "usually done by other people".&lt;ref name="RothRules"/&gt; He has since expressed regret over the original album cover:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Looking at that picture today makes me cringe. It was done in the worst possible taste. Back then I was too immature to see that. Shame on me—I should have done everything in my power to stop it. The record company came up with the idea, I think. The lyrics incidentally were a take-off on Kiss, whom we had just supported on a tour. I was fooling around and played the riff of the song in the rehearsal room and spontaneously improvised 'cause he's a virgin killer!' trying to do a more or less way-off-the-mark Paul Stanley impersonation. Klaus immediately said 'that's great! You should do something with it.' Then I had the unenviable task of constructing a meaningful set of lyrics around the title, which I actually managed to do to some degree. But the song has a totally different meaning from what people would assume at first. Virgin Killer is none other than the demon of our time, the less compassionate side of the societies we live in today—brutally trampling upon the heart and soul of innocence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Uli Jon Roth Says 'Virgin Killer' Album Cover Makes Him Cringe |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=50508 |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |date=April 3, 2006 |accessdate=12 May 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100509235302/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=50508 |archive-date=9 May 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2008, photographer Michael von Gimbut emphasized that his wife, the model's mother and sister, and three female assistants had been present during the shooting&lt;!--"Bei der Aufnahme seien er, seine Frau, die Mutter des Kindes, die Schwester und drei Assistentinnen dabei gewesen"--&gt; and stated, "Back then, we loved and protected children and did not sleep with them."&lt;ref name="sz"/&gt;

The cover generated controversy: the album could only be sold sealed in black plastic in several countries&lt;ref name="sz"/&gt;&lt;!--'durfte "Virgin Killer" in einigen Ländern nur in schwarzem Kunststoff eingeschweißt verkauft werden'--&gt; and the cover was replaced in some countries with an alternative cover art depicting the band members.&lt;ref name="Buck"/&gt; The original is named in various "worst album cover" lists: ''[[Cracked (magazine)|Cracked]]'' magazine online named it the No. 1 "Worst Album Cover of All-Time",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cracked.com/article_16761_15-worst-album-covers-all-time.html "The 15 Worst Album Covers of All-Time"] by Ben Dennison, ''[[Cracked (magazine)|Cracked]]''&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Gigwise.com]] lists it as No. 1 on its March 2008 "The 50 Most Controversial Album Covers of All Time!" list. Similarly, it was named by [[UGO Networks]] one of the "Weirdest Album Covers"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Jensen |first=K.

This would not be the last time that the band attracted controversy with its album covers. Their next album, ''[[Taken by Force]]'', originally featured cover art that depicted "children playing with guns at a military cemetery in France and some people found that offensive".&lt;ref name="RothRules"/&gt; Their 1979 album ''[[Lovedrive]]'' featured a "bizarre artwork" that depicts "a woman on the back seat of a car with bubblegum over her breast".&lt;ref name="Buck"/&gt; Both covers were replaced by an alternative design.&lt;ref name="VV"&gt;{{cite web |author=Palmer, Andrew |title=Rock You Like a Piece of Meat |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/music/9951,218547,11369,22.html |date=28 December 1999 |publisher=[[Village Voice]] |accessdate=13 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Weber, Barry |title=Scorpions |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p5370/biography|pure_url=yes}} |publisher=Allmusic |accessdate=13 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vocalist [[Klaus Meine]] explains that the band's penchant for controversial cover art stems from a desire "to go over the edge" and not "to offend some people or make the headlines [as] that would be stupid", contrasting guitarist Rudolf Schenker's earlier statement, "We're using this only to get attention."&lt;ref name="twp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="title" /&gt; In a 2010 interview Meine commented on the cover art again stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Back in those days [the 1970s] it was RCA, our record label then, went over the edge with Virgin Killer. Today when you think of child pornography on the net, you would never do something like that. We never did this in the sense of pornography, we did it in the sense of art. It is about the song and the label was pushing the idea because they wanted to get the controversy to help the album sale and you cannot get better promotion than that. Looking back from the band point of view it was never an album cover that we took home to our parents and said, "Look what we just released.." There was always mixed feelings about it and even 30 years later it caused a scandal at Wikipedia because the site for that album was blocked and even the FBI was getting involved. All of that after so many years, can you believe that?&lt;ref name="Metal Exiles interview with Klaus Meine"&gt;{{cite web |author=Jeffrey Easton |title=Metal Exiles interview with Klaus Meine' |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=138640 |publisher=metalexiles.com |accessdate=May 27, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100418175654/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/BLABBERMOUTH.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=138640 |archive-date=18 April 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In August 2015, a court in Sweden said that it considered the album cover to be child pornography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.svd.se/scorpionsomslag-anses-vara-barnporr|title=Scorpionsomslag anses vara barnporr|publisher=Svenska dagbladet|language=Swedish|date=7 August 2015|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2008, the [[Internet Watch Foundation]] (IWF), a UK-based [[non-government organization]], added the Wikipedia article ''Virgin Killer'' to its internet blacklist due to concerns over legality of the image, which had been assessed as the lowest level of legal concern: "erotic posing with no sexual activity".&lt;ref name="rating"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/dec/08/amazon-internet-censorship-iwf|title=Wikipedia row escalates as internet watchdog considers censoring Amazon US over Scorpions image|last=Arthur|first=Charles|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|date=8 December 2008|accessdate=8 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, people using many major UK [[ISP]]s were blocked from viewing the entire article by the [[Cleanfeed (content blocking system)|Cleanfeed]] system,&lt;ref name="rating"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wikipedia child image censored  |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7770456.stm|publisher=BBC News |date=8 December 2008 |accessdate=8 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/wikipedia-article-blocked-in-uk-over-child-photo-1057010.html |title=Wikipedia article blocked in UK over child photo |agency=Associated Press |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=8 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a large part of the UK was blocked from editing Wikipedia owing to the means of blocking in use.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6634">'''Zura Bitiyeva''' (1948 – May 21, 2003) (Cyrilic:Зура Битиева; also transliterated as '''Bitieva''') was a locally well-known [[Chechen people|Chechen]] [[human rights]] activist who was extrajudicially executed by what is assumed to be a [[Russia]]n government [[death squad]] in 2003 after she complained to the [[European Court of Human Rights]] of ill treatment during an earlier illegal detention. Three other members of her immediate family were also killed in the same attack.

Bitiyeva's was not an isolated case and many people in [[Chechnya]] who have submitted cases of serious human rights violations to the ECHR have been also subjected to reprisals, including being killed or [[forced disappearance|forcibly disappeared]].&lt;ref name="amnesty"/&gt;

==Life==
Bitiyeva was born in 1948 in [[Kazakhstan]] during the forced exile of the entire Chechen nation. Later she returned to Chechnya, settling in the village of Kalinovskaya (Kalinovskaia). During the [[First Chechen War]], she was actively involved in [[anti-war]] protests. In February 2000, during the [[Second Chechen War]], she and her son Idris were arbitrarily detained by the Russian forces and taken to the unofficial detention centre known as [[Chernokozovo]], a "[[filtration camp (Chechnya)|filtration camp]]" infamous of torture, rape and other abuses.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/2000/russia_chechnya4/index.htm "Welcome to Hell": Arbitrary Detention, Torture, and Extortion in Chechnya], [[Human Rights Watch]], October 2000&lt;/ref&gt; When she has arrived at Chernokozovo, the guards told her she would "never leave alive." Bitiyeva, who tried to defend other prisoners, went on [[hunger strike]] and was released in a very ill condition. Her friends helped her go to [[Turkey]], but once her health was slightly better, she went back to Chechnya and began collecting evidence of crimes committed against civilian population of the republic, submitting it to [[United Nations]] and international human rights organizations. In February 2003, Bitiyeva had been part of the group of women that demanded the opening of a [[mass grave]] site discovered near the settlement of Kapustino. She also worked with the Russian NGO [[Union of the Committees of Soldiers' Mothers of Russia|Committee of Soldiers' Mothers]].&lt;ref name="memo"&gt;[http://www.memo.ru/eng/memhrc/texts/kalinkov.shtml Political Crime in the Kalinovskaia settlement], [[Memorial (society)|Memorial]], 26 May 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.watchdog.cz/?show=000000-000024-000002-000015&amp;lang=1 Heroes not of our time], [[Prague Watchdog]], 22 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/ja/news/2009/03/20/update-european-court-human-rights-judgments-against-russia-regarding-cases-chechnya Update on European Court of Human Rights Judgments against Russia regarding Cases from Chechnya], [[Human Rights Watch]], 20 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
On May 21, 2003, in the middle of a night, a group of over ten unidentified [[Russian language|Russian]]-speaking special forces troops (four of them masked) arrived in Kalinovskaya in two [[UAZ-452]] minivans. The troops broke into her family house and bound, gagged and hooded Zura and her son Idris, as well as her husband Ramzan and her brother Abubakar, and then shot all four of them in the back of their heads (Zura was shot also in her hands). Only her other son, Eldard, escaped death by hiding just in time. The killers also stole a [[videocassette recorder]] from the house. Later in the morning, two local men (Turpal Ismailov and Islambek Gadiyev) were also killed in their homes, presumably by the same group of attackers.&lt;ref name="amnesty"&gt;[http://asiapacific.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGEUR460272007?open&amp;of=ENG-RUS Russian Federation: European Court of Human Rights rulings on Bitiyeva and X v.

==ECHR ruling==
Bitiyeva had filed a complaint against Moscow with the European Court of Human Rights in 2000 for abuse while in detention (this was then-second ECHR case from Chechnya), but she was murdered before the ruling was issued. On June 21, 2007, in the case of '''Bitiyeva and X v. Russia''', the Court ruled that Russian forces were responsible for Bitiyeva's illegal detention, the inhuman and degrading treatment she suffered during detention, and for her subsequent "brutal" death.&lt;ref name="amnesty"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aT.YLrDA9XrQ Russia Is Blamed by Court for Chechen Family's 'Brutal' Deaths], [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]], 21 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2007/06/28d6e0c8-9793-476b-be09-22d4592d7286.html Russia Ruled Responsible For Killings Of Four Chechens], [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]], 21 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article2692483.ece Court rules against Russia in Chechen killing] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001105728/http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article2692483.ece |date=October 1, 2007 }}, ''[[The Independent]]'', 22 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?c=Article_C&amp;cid=1182444927842&amp;pagename=Zone-English-News/NWELayout Russia Convicted in Chechnya Killings], [[IslamOnline]], 22 Jun. 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/21/AR2007062102483.html?hpid=sec-world Rights Court Says Russian 'State Agents' Killed Chechen Activist], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', 22 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Russia was ordered by the court to pay €85,000 in damages to Bitiyeva's daughter, living as a refugee in [[Germany]].
