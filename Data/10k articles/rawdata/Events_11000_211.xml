      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3261">The '''1465 Moroccan revolt''' refers to a popular revolt by local Sharifs in [[Fes]] who overthrew the last [[Marinid]] sultan.&lt;ref name="Isichei1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=Isichei|first=Elizabeth Allo|title=A History of African Societies to 1870|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3C2tzBSAp3MC&amp;pg=PA190|accessdate=23 April 2012|date=13 April 1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-45599-2|page=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; The revolt marked the end of a 215-year reign (1244–1465). The sharifs formed a ''[[jihad]]'', against the last Marinid leader, a [[Jewish]] vizir, [[Aaron ben Batash]], appointed by [[Abd al-Haqq II|Abu Muhammad Abd Al-Haqq]]. They subsequently put him to death, cutting his throat. Almost all the Jewish community of [[Fes]] were also slaughtered in the revolt.&lt;ref name="Haddad1984"&gt;{{cite book|last=Haddad|first=Heskel M.|title=Jews of Arab and Islamic countries: history, problems, solutions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N5dtAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=23 April 2012|year=1984|publisher=Shengold Publishers|isbn=978-0-88400-100-3|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the troubles in Fes, the Portuguese king [[Afonso V of Portugal|Afonso V]] finally managed to take [[Tangier]].

After the execution of Abd al-Haqq, Muhammad b.

The demonstrators eventually broke through the security wall and entered the offices of the embassy. Six members of the embassy staff, who had been in a "[[safe room]]", were evacuated from the site by Egyptian [[commando]]s, following the personal intervention of United States President [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref name=rescue&gt;{{cite news|last=Hadid|first=Diaa|title=Egypt commandos save 6 Israelis in embassy attack|url=https://news.yahoo.com/egypt-commandos-save-6-israelis-embassy-attack-190607978.html|accessdate=30 April 2012|date=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Williams|first=Dan|title=Israel lauds Obama's role in Cairo crisis|url=https://af.reuters.com/article/egyptNews/idAFL5E7KA0UV20110910|accessdate=30 April 2012|date=10 September 2011|work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Obama asks Egypt to protect Israeli embassy|url=http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/obama-asks-egypt-protect-israeli-embassy|accessdate=30 April 2012|date=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
{{main|Egypt–Israel relations}}
[[File:Burning the Israeli flag at embassy in Cairo.jpg|thumb|right|On 15 May 2011, Egyptian protesters waved [[Palestinian flag]]s in front of the Israeli embassy in [[Giza]] as they burned a makeshift [[Israeli flag]].]]
During 2011, relations between Israel and Egypt deteriorated after the resignation of Egyptian President [[Hosni Mubarak]], reaching their lowest point since peace was established between the nations by the [[Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty|1979 Egypt&amp;ndash;Israel Peace Treaty]]. The Israeli-Egyptian border became a region of conflict and instability due to increased militant activity in Egypt's [[Sinai Peninsula]], and anti-Israeli sentiment was expressed in protests by masses of Egyptians in the streets of Giza.

On 18 August 2011, a squad of militants crossed the border from the Sinai Peninsula into southern Israel, [[2011 southern Israel cross-border attacks|killing eight Israelis]]. The ensuing Israeli counter-terrorist operations in close proximity to the border resulted in the deaths of "at least three" Egyptian soldiers.&lt;ref name=apology&gt;{{cite news|title=Egypt says Israel apology of troop deaths is insufficient|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2011-08-21/world/israel.egypt.tensions_1_israel-and-egypt-egyptian-border-amos-gilad?_s=PM:WORLD|accessdate=30 April 2012|newspaper=CNN|date=21 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The soldiers' deaths by Israeli fire{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} ignited protests at the Israeli Embassy in Giza. During a demonstration on 20 August 2011, an Egyptian protester climbed 20-feet up the building's facade to remove the [[Israeli flag]].

The Egyptian [[Supreme Council of the Armed Forces]] considered recalling the Egyptian ambassador in Tel Aviv. Eventually, Israel publicly apologized for the deaths of the Egyptian soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ehud Barak, Israel Defense Minister, Regrets Deaths Of Egyptian Troops|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/08/20/ehud-barak-egyptian-soldiers_n_932097.html|accessdate=30 April 2012|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=20 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Israel Apologizes For Deaths Of Egyptian Troops In Shootout With Militants|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2011/08/20/israel-apologizes-for-deaths-egyptian-troops-in-shootout-with-militants/|accessdate=30 April 2012|date=20 August 2011|work=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Egypt stated that Israel's apology was "insufficient."&lt;ref name=apology /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Egypt deems Israel's apology for policemen deaths 'insufficient'|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/middle-east/egypt-deems-israel-s-apology-for-policemen-deaths-insufficient-1.379797|accessdate=30 April 2012|newspaper=Haaretz Daily Newspaper|date=21 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The attack ==
{{see also|Timeline of the 2011 Egyptian revolution under Supreme Council of the Armed Forces#September}}
On 9 September 2011, hundreds of Egyptian protesters began gathering outside of the Israeli embassy. Around 6:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. local time, they began to assault a concrete security perimeter wall with hammers and a [[battering ram]]. Egyptian authorities had erected the wall following intense protests in August.

=== Building infiltration ===
At 12:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. Saturday morning, several thousand protesters&lt;ref name="numprotest"/&gt; breached the security wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Egyptians protest against military rule|url=http://aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2011/09/20119993150747146.html|accessdate=30 April 2012|date=9 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. they had entered the lobby and proceeded through the rest of the building. The demonstrators ransacked the embassy, located on the 20th and 21st floors of the building, and threw items including documents, some marked "[[confidential]]", from the windows of the building to the crowded street below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ali|first=Mostafa|title=The storming of Cairo's Israeli embassy: an eyewitness account (part I)|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContentP/1/20856/Egypt/The-storming-of-Cairos-Israeli-embassy-an-eyewitne.aspx|accessdate=30 April 2012|date=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The documents were quickly scanned and publicly commented on.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} Israel later revealed that the remaining Israeli security staff had been separated from the rioters only by the steel door of a safe room in which they had taken refuge.

In Jerusalem, Israeli Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] and various other senior Israeli officials watched the events unfold from a direct feed from the surveillance cameras installed in the embassy.

Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor estimated that about 3,000 protesters were involved in destroying the security wall.&lt;ref name=alert /&gt; An Israeli diplomat condemned the attack as a "serious violation" of diplomatic behavior.&lt;ref name=envoy&gt;{{cite news|title=Israel pulls envoy after embassy attack|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/09/201191064219436657.html|accessdate=30 April 2012|date=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately after the protesters had infiltrated the embassy, United States Secretary of Defense [[Leon Panetta]] received a call from Israeli [[Ministry of Defense (Israel)|Minister of Defense]] [[Ehud Barak]] asking for help. The United States assisted in assuring the protection of the Israeli embassy personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ravid|first=Barak|title=U.S. told Egypt it must rescue Israeli embassy workers or suffer 'consequences,'|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/u-s-told-egypt-it-must-rescue-israeli-embassy-workers-or-suffer-consequences-sources-say-1.383675|accessdate=30 April 2012|newspaper=Haaretz Daily Newspaper|date=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prime Minister Netanyahu later emphasized that he "would like to thank the US President Barack Obama for his help" in securing the lives of the Israeli embassy staff.&lt;ref name=envoy /&gt;

=== Rescue of embassy staff and end of the riots===
Six Israeli security staff who were on the premises hid inside a reinforced safe room. Egyptian commando forces entered the embassy building and rescued the six Israeli guards.&lt;ref name=rescue /&gt; All other embassy staff and their family members were escorted to [[Cairo International Airport]]. At 2:40&amp;nbsp;a.m., the Israeli ambassador and approximately 85 other Israeli diplomats and their family members arrived at the airport and were flown out of Egypt. Only the deputy Israeli ambassador remained in Egypt, staying at the United States embassy.&lt;ref name=stance /&gt; A senior Egyptian security official stated that the Egyptian commandos had been sent to the embassy after Israeli Ambassador [[Itzhak Levanon]] spoke on the phone with an anonymous member of [[Supreme Council of the Armed Forces|Egypt's ruling military council]], and asked him to arrange the safe evacuation of the embassy staff.&lt;ref name=rescue /&gt;

The demonstration and ransacking of the embassy building continued into the early morning hours as the protesters burned tires and set several police cars on fire. The Egyptian police eventually suppressed the riots and dispersed the thousands of rioters by using tear gas and firing warning shots into the air.&lt;ref name=alert /&gt;

Prime Minister Netanyahu and former [[Mossad]] director [[Efraim Halevy]] praised the actions of American president Obama in helping with the evacuation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wexler|first=Robert|title=Defending Obama’s pro-Israel credentials|url=http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Op-EdContributors/Article.aspx?id=238954|accessdate=30 April 2012|newspaper=The Jerusalem Post|date=22 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
Following the attack on the embassy, the Egyptian army heightened the state of alert in the country and reinstated martial law, otherwise known as [[State of Emergency]], on a temporary basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Egypt Declares Emergency After Attack on Israeli Embassy|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-09-10/egypt-declares-state-of-emergency-after-israeli-embassy-struck.html|publisher=Businessweek|accessdate=30 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the morning of Saturday, 10 September, Egypt's ruling military council rejected resignation requests that had been submitted by Egyptian Prime Minister [[Essam Sharaf]] and several Egyptian ministers. Their request was made because of the failure to handle the disturbances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lina|first=Yang|title=Egypt's ruling military council rejects PM's resignation|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/world/2011-09/10/c_131132013.htm|accessdate=30 April 2012|date=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One day after the attacks on the embassy, a group of reporters were attacked by a crowd of people still lingering near the scene of the riots. A reporter and producer were knocked to the ground and trampled, but managed to get to a vehicle in which they retreated, with protesters throwing stones at them. They were able to flee the area without sustaining any major injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Watson|first=Ivan|title=Angry crowd turns on journalists reporting embassy attack in Egypt|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/meast/09/10/egypt.journalists.targeted/|accessdate=30 April 2012|date=11 September 2011|work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrests===
In August 2012, an Egyptian court convicted 76 Egyptians who were linked to the attack on the Israeli embassy. 75 of those convicted received suspended one-year sentences, and one Egyptian, Omar Afifi who had fled abroad,&lt;ref name="Jpost convict"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=282646 | title=Egypt orders man to jail over Israel embassy attack | publisher=The Jerusalem Post | work=Reuters; The Jerusalem Post | date=August 26, 2012 | accessdate=August 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was tried in absentia was given a five-year prison term. Eight charges were listed by the court, including “an assault against diplomatic missions” and “sabotage.”&lt;ref name="TToI Convict"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/egypt-76-convicted-for-attack-on-israel-embassy/ | title=Egypt: 76 convicted for last year’s attack on Israeli Embassy | publisher=The Times of Israel | date=August 26, 2012 | accessdate=August 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The victim, a second year BA student of Derozio College, was walking home along the Kamduni BDO Office Road in the afternoon, when she was abducted and taken inside a factory where she was gang-raped by eight muslim men.

The '''2019 Cricket World Cup''' (officially '''ICC Cricket World Cup 2019''') is the 12th edition of the [[Cricket World Cup]], scheduled to be hosted by [[England]] and [[Wales]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/4956010.stm |title=England lands Cricket World Cup |accessdate=2006-04-30|work=BBC Sport |date=2006-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="espncricinfo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/245814.html |title=England awarded 2019 World Cup |accessdate=2006-04-30|work=espncricinfo}}&lt;/ref&gt; from 30 May to 14 July 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.icc-cricket.com/cricket-world-cup/news/2015/media-releases/84891/outcomes-from-icc-board-and-committee-meetings|title= OUTCOMES FROM ICC BOARD AND COMMITTEE MEETINGS|publisher= ICC|date= 29 January 2015|accessdate= 29 January 2015|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150202205353/http://www.icc-cricket.com/cricket-world-cup/news/2015/media-releases/84891/outcomes-from-icc-board-and-committee-meetings|archive-date= 2015-02-02|dead-url= yes|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The hosting rights were awarded in April 2006, after England and Wales withdrew from the bidding to host the [[2015 ICC Cricket World Cup]], which was held in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]. The first match will be played at [[The Oval]] while the final will be played at [[Lord's]]. It is the fifth time that the Cricket World Cup will be held in England and Wales, following the [[1975 Cricket World Cup|1975]], [[1979 Cricket World Cup|1979]], [[1983 Cricket World Cup|1983]] and [[1999 Cricket World Cup|1999]] World Cups.

The format for the tournament will be a single group of ten teams, with each team playing the other nine teams, and the top four teams progressing to a knockout stage of semi-finals and a final. The ten team tournament has gained criticism due to the lack of Associate teams in the tournament. Given the increase of the Test playing nations from 10 to 12, with the admission of [[Ireland cricket team|Ireland]] and [[Afghanistan national cricket team|Afghanistan]] in June 2017, it will be the first World Cup to be contested without all of the Test playing nations being present,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/icc-world-twenty20-2016/content/story/994995.html|title=ICC's Richardson wants more teams in World T20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and after the elimination of all the Associate teams at the [[2018 Cricket World Cup Qualifier|qualifying tournament]], this will be also be the first World Cup to feature no Associate members.

== Qualification ==
{{main|2018 Cricket World Cup Qualifier}}
The 2019 World Cup will feature 10 teams, a decrease from previous World Cups in 2011 and 2015 which featured 14 teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/cricket/33296828| title= Cricket World Cup 2019 to stay at only 10 teams|publisher=BBC Sport|date=26 June 2015|accessdate= 26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hosts, England, and the top seven other teams in the [[ICC ODI Championship|ICC One Day International rankings]] as of 30 September 2017 earned automatic qualification, with the remaining two spots being decided by the [[2018 Cricket World Cup Qualifier]].&lt;ref name="icc-cricket.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icc-cricket.com/news/2015/media-releases/84879/afghanistan-and-ireland-receive-opportunity-to-qualify-for-the-icc-cricket-world-cup-2019-with-full-members|title=Afghanistan and Ireland receive opportunity to qualify for the ICC Cricket World Cup 2019 with Full Members|work=icc-cricket.com|access-date=2015-07-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150129062811/http://www.icc-cricket.com/news/2015/media-releases/84879/afghanistan-and-ireland-receive-opportunity-to-qualify-for-the-icc-cricket-world-cup-2019-with-full-members|archive-date=2015-01-29|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the announcement of the qualification structure, [[ICC members|ICC Associate and Affiliate members]], who were guaranteed four spots in the previous two World Cup tournaments, could be represented by at most two teams, and possibly none at all if they were beaten by the lowest ranked Full Members in the Qualifier.&lt;ref name="icc-cricket.com"/&gt; It also meant that at least two of the 10 Test playing nations at the time of the announcement would have to play in the qualifying tournament, and could possibly miss the World Cup finals entirely.

Following recent success, Ireland and Afghanistan were promoted into the ICC ODI Championship and have also since been promoted to full members of the ICC, becoming the newest Test cricketing nations. However, they still needed to qualify for the World Cup via the current process.

Afghanistan won the qualifying tournament defeating the West Indies in the final. Both teams qualified for the World Cup, while Zimbabwe despite hosting the qualifying tournament failed to reach the final and will miss the World Cup for the first time since 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/cricket/live-cricket-score-zimbabwe-vs-uae-icc-world-cup-qualifiers-2018-super-six-harare/story-v0K4NDjN5pGSvu4Ccu539N.html |title= UAE stun Zim |accessdate=26 March 2018 |work=hindustantimes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently appointed full member Ireland will also miss the World Cup for the first time since 2007 and for the first time ever no Associate nation will be participating in the World Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/23/afghanistan-ireland-cricket-world-cup-qualifier |title= Ireland miss out on World Cup for the first time since 2003 |accessdate=26 March 2018 |work= The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Andrea Michaels was born in the [[Arbe concentration camp]] (today [[Rab]], [[Croatia]], on the northern shore of the [[Adriatic Sea]]) to Lelja Kauders (b. Zagreb, Yugoslavia, August 25, 1923 – d. Los Angeles California, May 30, 2009).&lt;ref&gt;Tributes.com/show/Lelja-Gerson&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ben7879&gt;Wright, David, ''Yes You Can! Reaching Your Potential While Achieving Greatness - with Dr. Warren Bennis, Andrea Michaels and Jim Rohn''. Sevierville, Tennessee: Insight Publishing, 2010, pp. 77-88.&lt;/ref&gt; Michaels and her mother, along with her mother's [[Jewish]] parents, Paul (Palvo) Kauders and Elza Ackerman Kauders, escaped in a small boat across the Adriatic to Italy.&lt;ref name="ben7879"/&gt; Michaels lived in Italy to the age of four with her grandparents until her mother, who had married an American pilot, sent for her to come live in America.&lt;ref name="ben7879"/&gt; The marriage ended, and after Michaels arrived in America, her mother married Peter Gerson, who adopted Andrea and moved the family from [[Silverlake, California]], to [[Hollywood]].&lt;ref name="ben7879"/&gt; When Michaels was ten, the family moved to [[Burbank, California]].&lt;ref name="ben7879"/&gt;

An only child Michaels graduated from [[Burbank High School (Burbank, California)|Burbank High School]] in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.classmates.com/places/school/school/3516/m?startYear=1900&amp;endYear=9999&amp;communityId=3516&lt;/ref&gt; Michaels attended the [[University of California at Berkeley]] in 1961 and 1962, transferring to the [[University of California at Los Angeles]] (UCLA) before marrying Bob Spritz on February 1, 1964.&lt;ref name="ben7879"/&gt; The marriage lasted ten years, and they had a son, Jon (b. July 24, 1970).&lt;ref name=reflect/&gt; After her divorce from Spritz, she changed her last name as well as that of her son's to "Michaels."&lt;ref name=reflect/&gt; Michaels returned to UCLA in 1970 and earned a degree, with honors, in [[Psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;2002 Hall of Fame, NAWBOLA.org./About_Us/2002_hof.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of pursuing a career in Psychology, Michaels began working with the Ron Rubin Orchestras in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, Maggie, "Spectacular Events Keep Encino Firm in Demand," Features Section, Los Angeles Times, November 23, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; During that time, she became interested in the [[event planning]] business when there was no formalized industry. She produced her first event in 1978—-a [[Anniversary|bicentennial]] celebration for Marsh McClellan Insurance Company. By 1982, the company had been restructured and renamed Michaels, Rubin and Associates.&lt;ref name=ben7879 /&gt; Michaels and Rubin dissolved their relationship in December 1988, and on that same day, Extraordinary Events was launched.&lt;ref&gt;"Coffee With Andrea Michaels - Meetings And Conventions".

'''Ankur''' (English: ''The Seedling'') is an Indian [[color motion picture film|colour film]] of [[Bollywood films of 1974|1974]]. It was the first [[feature film]] directed by [[Shyam Benegal]] and the debut of Indian actors [[Ananth Nag]] and [[Shabana Azmi]]. Ananth Nag was introduced in Ankur by Shyam Benegal after his higher education in Mumbai. The film was shot in Hyderabad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/ankur-1974/article3918198.ece|title=Blast from the Past, Ankur (1974)|publisher=[[the Hindu]]|date=September 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though [[Shabana Azmi]] had acted in other films as well, ''Ankur'' was her first release.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asiasource.org/news/special_reports/azmi.cfm Shabana Azmi interview]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202070430/http://www.asiasource.org/news/special_reports/azmi.cfm |date=2 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like many others of Benegal's films, ''Ankur'' belongs to the genre of Indian art films, or more precisely, Indian [[Parallel Cinema]]. The plot is based on a true story that occurred in [[Hyderabad district (India)|Hyderabad]], apparently in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="redhot"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; It was filmed almost entirely on location.

''Ankur'' has won three [[National Film Awards]] and 43 other prizes, both in [[India]] and abroad. It was nominated for the [[Golden Bear]] at the [[24th Berlin International Film Festival]].

This film includes one [[flagellation|whipping]] scene and more [[profanity]] than is usually found in Indian films.

==Plot==
''Ankur'' is a complex film that analyzes [[human behavior]] in general and heavily stresses [[characterization]] (though the story is not fictional). The story revolves around two characters, Lakshmi and Surya.

Lakshmi ([[Shabana Azmi]]) lives in a village with her husband Kishtayya ([[Sadhu Meher]]), a [[deaf-mute]] [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] [[pottery|potter]] who communicates using [[gesture]]s. The couple is poor and belongs to the lowly [[Dalit]] caste. Lakshmi attends a village festival and prays faithfully to the Goddess, stating that her only desire in life is to have a child.

Surya ([[Anant Nag]]), the son of the village [[landlord]], has just finished his studies in the nearby city of [[Hyderabad (India)|Hyderabad]] and arrives back home. Surya's father (Khader Ali Beg) has a [[mistress (lover)|mistress]] named Kaushalya with whom he has an [[illegitimacy|illegitimate]] son named Pratap. Surya's father claims to have given Kaushalya "the best land in the village", a gift which serves as both a token of his affection and also keeps Kaushalya quiet and satisfied. Surya is forced by his father into a [[child marriage]] with the under aged Saru (Priya Tendulkar), and begins to feel extremely [[sexual frustration|sexually frustrated]] due to the fact that they cannot have sex until Saru matures.

Surya reluctantly takes over the administrative responsibilities of his share of land in the village. Alone, he moves into a different, older house, and Lakshmi and Kishtayya are sent to act as his [[servant]]s. Not long after his arrival, he begins to exert his authority by introducing a number of different laws and measures, many of which are controversial among the village people. Almost immediately, Surya starts to form an attraction towards Lakshmi, and gives her the task of cooking his meals and serving him tea. This does not sit well with the village priest, a man who traditionally delivers food to the landowner, though at a higher price than Lakshmi asks.

Surya also hires Kishtayya to ride his [[bullock cart]] and go on errands. The following day, he has Kishtayya collect [[fertilizer]] from the landlord's house. Surya then uses Kishtayya's absence to try to [[flirting|flirt]] with Lakshmi, but she fails to reciprocate. In the meantime, the villagers have begun to gossip, and many (most notably the overseer, Police Officer [[Patel]] Sheikh Chand) believe that Surya has already slept with Lakshmi, and will act in the same way that his father did - try to conceal the scandal by giving his mistress a vast plot of land.

Kishtayya is caught stealing [[palm wine|toddy]] wine, after which he is publicly humiliated, and he decides to leave the village due to the embarrassment. In his absence, Surya and Lakshmi sleep together. Some while later, Saru arrives at the village, in order to live with her husband. Saru does not approve of Lakshmi's presence, partly because Lakshmi is a Dalit and partly because Saru has heard the villagers' [[rumor]]s. The next morning, Lakshmi begins suffering from [[morning sickness]], and Saru [[termination of employment|fires]] her, claiming that she is too sick to work.

Many days go by, and eventually Kishtayya returns, having cured himself of his alcoholism and made some money. Lakshmi is overwhelmed with a feeling of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], because she believes that she has betrayed her husband. On discovering Lakshmi's [[pregnancy]], he salutes the village goddess at her temple, acknowledging that his wife's wish has been granted. He then decides to return to work and hopefully ride the bullock cart once again for Surya. Surya sees Kishtayya and mistakenly believes that Kishtayya is seeking [[revenge]] from him due to his infidelity with Lakshmi.

Surya orders three men to grab hold of Kishtayya and then proceeds to [[flagellation|whip]] him with a rope used for [[lynching]]. The commotion attracts others, including Sheikh Chand and Pratap, to the scene, and Lakshmi rushes to defend her husband. She angrily [[curse]]s Surya, then slowly returns home with Kishtayya. In the final scene, after the others have left, a young child throws a stone at Surya's glass window and runs away.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmreference.com/Directors-Be-Bu/Benegal-Shyam.html Shyam Benegal at filmreference]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characters==
The plot is portrayed through the perspectives of Surya and Lakshmi. However, several other major characters and relatively minor characters also enhance the plot, each in his own way.

===Surya===
During his wedding, Surya glances first at Kaushalya and Pratap (who are sitting together), then at his own mother. Kaushalya is smiling because her son's wedding is to be held with Surya's, but Surya's mother appears relatively resigned. This is how he always saw marriage: the legitimate wife who suffers and the mistress who prospers.

Formerly an inhabitant of the city, he is not accustomed to the ways of the village. When Sheikh Chand expresses his hopes that the village will improve with Surya's presence, Surya's only reply is: "Yeah, well, they better." It is for this reason that Surya begins making changes as he deems fit.

In addition, Surya's father gives Pratap the "best" land in the village while Surya lives in an old house. As a result, Surya's second change in the village is to stop water from flowing into Pratap's and Kaushalya's fields. Kaushalya requests a reason from Surya, who points out that he is not her son. She responds, "I think of you that way" - a remark that makes Surya even more angry.

At least two days later, Pratap asks Surya to restore the water flow into his fields. When Surya refuses, Pratap threatens to report Surya's actions to their father. Surya initially dismisses this warning but is surprised when his father eventually does show up. Surya tries to defend his actions but is unsuccessful in doing so.

Before his father arrived (but after Pratap's visit), Surya had promised to take care of Lakshmi "forever." However, when he finds out that she is pregnant, he coaxes her to [[abortion|abort]] the child and refuses to take responsibility over the baby. She refuses to have an abortion because she always wanted a child, so Surya tells her to leave.

When Saru announces to Surya that she has caught Lakshmi stealing rice, he warns Lakshmi that he would have whipped her until she began bleeding if she were not a woman. Then he forbids her to come near his house again. Sheikh Chand requests Surya to consider Lakshmi's situation more thoroughly. Surya refuses while nervously wiping his hands.

===Lakshmi===
Lakshmi readily serves Surya as a servant, albeit at a low wage. That is what she is expected to do. However, the villagers did not realize that Surya would find her attractive and ask her to do additional chores.

She often appears to be worried: first about Kishtayya's alcoholism, then about where he has gone and how to live without him, and finally, about her loyalty to him.

It is clear that Lakshmi had an extended affair with Surya which seems to have started when she places her head on Surya's shoulder and the scene ends abruptly. After that there are several occasions when we see her dressing up or her lying next to Surya in bed.

===Rajamma===
Two days after Kishtayya's departure, Lakshmi witnesses (from a distance) two men dragging a village woman to the [[panchayat]]. The woman, Rajamma, refuses to go while the men accuse her of "dishonouring our brother." At the panchayat, the men reveal that she has committed [[adultery]].

Her brothers-in-law argue that they have "two wells" and "two crops a year," maintaining that Rajamma could not want more. Rajamma explains that she wants a child (Lakshmi immediately realizes the similarity to her own desires). "My not having a child," she claims, "is because of him, my husband." She threatens [[suicide]] if she is forced to live with her husband, Yadgiri. When asked what his argument is, Yadgiri simply allows the judges to make a decision.

Before Rajamma expresses her views, the judges reprimand her for disgracing "your house, your family, and your village" by living with another man. At this point, Surya looks at Lakshmi, who already lives with him. The final verdict is that Rajamma must live with her husband and that Yadgiri's brothers should compensate if she is dissatisfied. After the trial, Rajamma commits suicide.

Lakshmi can identify closely with Rajamma. After Rajamma's suicide, she tells Surya that she wishes to return to Kishtayya. However, she realizes that this is impossible, and Surya promises to look after her.

===Saru===
As soon as Saru arrives, she bows before Surya, and Lakshmi garlands her. She immediately begins adding decorations to the house, namely a frame with the message "Good Luck" (in English) and a picture from her wedding. She also puts a garland around a framed picture of two Hindu deities, and prays to them. She knows about Surya's affair with Lakshmi, but she is puzzled when she sees Lakshmi cursing Surya since she does not know about Kishtayya.

Saru is rarely shown smiling until she sacks Lakshmi. In fact, the very first day, just as Surya is hanging up the wedding picture and Lakshmi is walking into her room, she points out Lakshmi's presence by silently staring at him and nodding slightly towards Lakshmi's room. When Surya tries to avoid discussion of the affair by criticizing how he looks in the picture, Saru does not speak to him and does not even allow him to touch her. That same night, she suggests that he sack Lakshmi; an unconcerned Surya tells her to do as she wishes.

Saru is a supporter of the caste system. When Lakshmi makes tea for the new couple, Surya accepts his glass. Saru, on the other hand, refuses hers before expressing her surprise at Surya (not realizing that he was the one who had Lakshmi make tea in the first place). She then refuses to have "anything she [Lakshmi] has touched."

===Surya's father===
If not for Surya's father, Surya would have been far less likely to meet Lakshmi, change the village's rhythm of life, and cause a revolt. However, he insists that Surya control his share of land. He does not believe in hiring others to administer the land for him because he thinks they will "get rich at our cost" and seize the land for themselves.

===Kaushalya===
Though she always smiles when speaking to Surya, Kaushalya does not like him very much. In his absence, she calls him a "spoiled brat" and a "mere boy." She always calls him her "son", as if his legitimate wife was nonexistent. She has become rich at Surya's mother's cost. Many, if not all, of these facts provoke Surya to try to put an end to her progress by cutting off the water supply.

===Pratap===
Pratap does not seem to consider Surya's feelings about Kaushalya very thoroughly. He also does not hesitate to enter his half-brother's house without permission. However, he is perhaps more enraged than any of the other villagers when he observes the injured Kishtayya at the end of the film. In that scene, he appears to stay and stare at Surya's window longer than any of the other villagers.

===Sheikh Chand===
Sheikh Chand (played by Agha Mohammed Hussain) is the Muslim overseer of the landlord's property. When Surya arrives in the village, he is initially hopeful that the new arrival might improve the village. These hopes seem to disappear within a day: Surya monopolizes the toddy trade and demands that Sheikh Chand guard the toddy. Sheikh Chand promises to punish anyone who steals the toddy severely, but once Surya leaves, the expression on his face changes from a smile to a straight face.

===Kishtayya===
Kishtayya is strong both physically and mentally. It is because of Kishtayya's physical strength that Surya is afraid of him, and his mental strength is demonstrated by his ability to overcome alcoholism (facilities for alcoholics were generally not available in India during the 1950s, particularly not in villages). Surya, however, exploits Kishtayya's weaknesses (i.e. the fact that Kishtayya is deaf-mute, alcoholic, poor, and a Dalit). Kishtayya's alcoholism allows Surya to humiliate him so that Surya can be closer to Lakshmi. Kishtayya's physical handicap prevents him from understanding what is happening when Surya proceeds to beat him in the end, and his poverty and caste do not permit him to complain about Surya's actions.

In spite of his weaknesses, Kishtayya uses his job as a cart-driver to drive willing schoolchildren to their homes at the end of the day.

===The Boy===
One of the characters is an anonymous boy who first appears in the scene in which Kishtayya steals toddy. The boy is the one who reports the theft to Surya; from that day until the end of the film, they seem to be on friendly terms (just before Kishtayya is beaten, the boy is shown flying kites with Surya). However, at the end of the film, he suddenly turns against Surya by breaking his window.

==Motif of the seedling==
In addition to being the title of the film, the [[seedling]] makes various appearances (both physically and metaphorically) in the film and is used as a [[motif (literature)|motif]].
* In the first scene, a village woman appears to offer the seedling of a fruit to the goddess while Lakshmi prays for a child. (As she offers the seedling, it seems that the first word she utters is ''pandlu'' which means "fruits" in Telugu.)
* The seedling may also represent the child that Lakshmi desires.
* Not long before Kishtayya is caught stealing toddy, there is a scene in which Lakshmi is cooking dinner. Suddenly, near the doorstep, she notices a pot containing a seedling. The implication is that Kishtayya has gone out to drink again and has left Lakshmi the seedling as compensation. She steps outside the doorstep, finds Kishtayya staggering home, and breaks the pot in front of him before returning inside.
* Metaphorically speaking, the seedling of popular [[rebellion]] sprouts at the end of the film (the villagers begin to protest the village's [[social hierarchy]]).

==Social issues==
Many reviewers suggest that ''Ankur'' makes a statement concerning one particular social issue. In reality, it addresses several, including (but not necessarily limited to) those listed below:
* '''Alcoholism''': Kishtayya used to be a "good potter," Lakshmi tells Surya. However, demand for his [[clay]] pots decreased as [[aluminium]] vessels were becoming increasingly popular. As he could not sell many pots, he began to drown his sorrows in [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]]. Lakshmi claims that Kishtayya is a "good man" whose "only fault is drinking." Two scenes show Kishtayya returning home after a night of drinking while Lakshmi cooks dinner. In both scenes, a worried Lakshmi scolds her husband, trying to discourage him from drinking. Kishtayya's only response is to go to bed on a hungry stomach. He does not overcome his alcoholism until he abandons Lakshmi.
* '''Casteism''': The film provides a deeper insight into the ugliness of Indian caste system, particularly visible in the rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2007-11-12/kolkata/27953051_1_shyam-benegal-forgotten-hero-film Casteism through Benegal's eyes] ''[[Times of India]]'', 12 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The villagers expect Lakshmi to work as Surya's servant. However, being a Dalit, tradition forbids that she cook meals for Surya. Thus, when Surya asks Lakshmi to cook his meals, the villagers (particularly the [[Hindu]] [[greengrocer]]) begin to disapprove of him. When Saru moves to Surya's house, she refuses to touch "anything that she (Lakshmi) has touched."
* '''Rich vs. poor''': The first time Lakshmi is shown scolding Kishtayya, she claims that she is obliged to commit petty [[theft]] in order to care for herself and her husband. She initially steals no more than three handfuls a day of rice from Surya. Some time after she is dismissed from her job, she returns to Surya's house to look for work again. Saru offers Lakshmi food instead of work, and Lakshmi attempts to steal a little more rice than usual (as she is pregnant). Saru catches her red-handed as she brings a meal, then forces her to put back the rice, saying, "You people starve because you steal." In the end, Lakshmi refuses "your [Surya's] jobs, your money, anything of yours!" thus suggesting that [[poverty]] does not concern her in this context.
* '''Parent vs. child''': The relationship between Surya and his father appears to be rather unsteady; neither of them smiles when they are together. Surya tries to spend more time with his friends by asking his father for permission to study for a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree. However, his father (who already knows what Surya is trying to do) refuses him permission and forces him to marry Saru. Little does Surya's father initially know what the consequences of these actions of his will be.
* '''Sexual drive''': Surya, Lakshmi, and Rajamma have all engaged in adultery. Each has his own reasons. Surya is sexually frustrated, and Rajamma wants a child. Lakshmi's reasons are unclear, for ''Ankur'' does not reveal when her affair with Surya began. (See the Unanswered Questions section of this article.)
* '''Changing loyalties''': Saru is perhaps the only character who does not change her loyalty to something (in her case, tradition). Surya pretends to be loyal to Lakshmi but abandons her once she becomes pregnant. Lakshmi is loyal to her husband until she sleeps with Surya. We do not know whether Kishtayya has remained loyal to his wife in his absence (though it seems improbable considering his general respect for Lakshmi, adultery on his part might explain why he forgives her). Certainly, he has abandoned his loyalty to alcohol but remains supportive of his wife.
* '''Religious differences''': This less predominant issue characterizes the relationship between two of the minor characters, namely Sheikh Chand and the greengrocer. Their religious differences encourages them to play nonviolent [[practical joke]]s on one another. The greengrocer tricks Sheikh Chand into getting Surya's car out of the mud; later, Sheikh Chand reciprocates by stealing a few [[betel]] leaves from the greengrocer.
* '''[[Dowry]]''': This issue is a relatively minor one in the film. It is addressed only in one quote, when Lakshmi explains why she married Kishtayya. After Surya asks why Lakshmi chose to marry a "drunken deaf-mute," she answers that no one else would marry her as she could not afford to pay dowry. She then points out that Kishtayya was not yet a drunkard.

==Irony==
{{Original research section|date=February 2016}}
* The attitudes of Surya's mother and Lakshmi towards their husbands are ironic in different ways. Both are fiercely defensive of their husbands and forbid Surya to say anything negative about them. Yet, Surya's mother has suffered as the landlord prefers Kaushalya to his legitimate wife, and Lakshmi continues to defend Kishtayya after having an affair with Surya.
* Surya repeatedly criticizes Kishtayya for drinking. However, on the night of [[Diwali]], he and three other privileged villagers drink while [[gambling]] using cards. One of the participants, Swami, drinks more than his companions and stakes not only all his money but also his gold chain, his watch, and even his wife. He loses all three (though his [[wiktionary:adversary|adversary]] does not succeed in carrying away Swami's wife).

==Foreshadowing==
{{Original research section|date=February 2016}}
In ''Ankur'', there are multiple minor events that [[foreshadowing|foreshadow]] parts of the main plot. Examples are provided below.
* After his unsuccessful attempt to flirt with Lakshmi, Surya walks to his [[water well]] when suddenly he notices a snake approaching him. He is so scared that instead of running away, he stands still out of shock while calling Lakshmi for help, thus making it easier for the snake to bite him. Lakshmi saves his life by chasing the snake back to its hole, but Surya shows no [[gratitude]]. This act of [[cowardice]] in a small scene foreshadows the final scene, in which Surya runs back into his house on seeing Lakshmi, emotionally unable to confront her.
* The first time that Kishtayya is shown returning home drunk, he attempts to engage in [[sexual intercourse]] with Lakshmi after she scolds him. She resists at first but soon gives in. The same happens, though on a larger scale, between Lakshmi and Surya after Kishtayya leaves the village.

==Unanswered questions==
{{Original research section|date=February 2016}}
Although the plot of ''Ankur'' is very detailed, it does withhold enough information to leave some questions unanswered.
* Did Surya always oppose the caste system, or did he simply adopt this belief to be closer to Lakshmi?&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planetbollywood.com/Film/Ankur/ Planet Bollywood (Ankur Review)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060319130845/http://www.planetbollywood.com/Film/Ankur/ |date=19 March 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* When did Lakshmi and Surya begin their affair? Was it before or after Kishtayya left the village?
* Sheikh Chand discovers Lakshmi stealing his [[maize]] but tries to dissuade her, saying that Surya will grant land to her as his father did to Kaushalya. In the next scene, he tries unsuccessfully to convince Surya to look after Lakshmi. How much time elapsed between these two scenes? Did Sheikh Chand truly believe that Lakshmi would benefit, or was he simply trying to console her?
* Why, in fact, did Lakshmi decide to have an affair? Was it for fear of losing her job and only source of income? ([[Satyajit Ray]], on whom Benegal later made a [[documentary film]], had directed a film called ''[[Pratidwandi]]'' four years before the making of this film. In ''Pratidwandi'', the main character's sister "Topu" or Sutapa has an affair with her boss for this reason.)

==Production==
The characters in ''Ankur'' often speak the [[Dakhani language]], a variant of Standard Hindi-Urdu spoken in Southern India (particularly in the Hyderabad area). For example, when Surya asks Lakshmi where Kishtayya is, she responds, "''Mereku naheeN maaluum''" in Dakhani instead of "''Mujhe naheeN maaluum''" (I don't know) in Standard Hindi. (See [[Muslim culture of Hyderabad]] for more examples of Dakhani.)

[[Shabana Azmi]], a fresh graduate from [[Film and Television Institute of India]], [[Pune]] (FTII), wasn't the first choice for the role of Lakshmi. Benegal had earlier approached [[Waheeda Rehman]], [[Anju Mahendru]] and [[Sharada (actress)|Sharada]], all of whom had refused his offer. Thereafter, he chose [[Shabana Azmi]]; he had to alter the script a bit to suit the younger-looking Lakshmi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upperstall.com/films/1973/ankur Ankur Review] ''[[Upperstall.com]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Benegal was initially reluctant to hire Azmi, thinking she was a model and perhaps unsuitable for the role of a humble villager.

==Music==
Being an Indian art film, ''Ankur'' is a "straight" feature without musical sequences. However, Surya plays parts of two records over the course of the film. The first recording consists of the third stanza of the song "Yahi To Hai Woh" by Mohd. Rafi from ''Solvan Saal'' (1958). The fourth stanza is then played in the background while Surya talks to Lakshmi.

The film also includes several scenes in which villagers sing folk songs, mostly in Telugu.

==Cast==
* [[Anant Nag]] as Surya
* Mirza Qadir Ali Baig as Surya's father
* Prafullata Natu as Surya's mother
* [[Priya Tendulkar]] as Saru
* [[Shabana Azmi]] as Lakshmi

* [[Dalip Tahil]]
* Agha Mohammed Hussain as Sheik Chand

==Reception==
The film was both a commercial and critical success. The film's producer, Lalit M. Bijlani, who produced the film for just five lakhs rupees, went on to make one crore with its release.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southasiancinema.com/reviews.htm Benegal, Nihalani &amp; Mirza] www.southasiancinema.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''[[Channel 4]]'' review placed the film, in "the top ten classic films of the Indian Art House canon",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channel4.com/film/reviews/film.jsp?id=122590&amp;page=2 ''Ankur'' (The Seedling) Review] ''[[Channel 4]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; while according to the ''[[The Independent|Independent]]'', "the deeply impressive lead performance by Shabana Azmi demonstrates Ankur as one of the most mature and compelling films the Indian cinema has to offer".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cinematical.com/2007/09/07/rvbs-after-images-ankur-1974-by-shyam-benegal/ Ankur 1974 Review]&lt;/ref&gt; For the ''[[Time Out (company)|Time Out]]'' reviewer, the film "recalled the modest realism of Satyajit Ray".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeout.com/film/chicago/reviews/78024/the-seedling.html Ankur (1974) Review] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607051810/http://www.timeout.com/film/chicago/reviews/78024/the-seedling.html |date=7 June 2011 }} ''[[Time Out (company)|Time Out]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; A recent reviewer said, "Shyam Benegal creates a sublime and provocative examination of hypocrisy, economic disparity, and the social status of women in Ankur.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmref.com/directors/dirpages/benegal.html Benegal] www.filmref.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''NRG Astrodome''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nrgpark.com/nrg-astrodome|title=NRG Astrodome - NRG Park|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as the '''Houston Astrodome''' or simply the '''Astrodome''', is the world's first [[Multi-purpose stadium|multi-purpose]], [[stadium#Types|domed]] sports [[stadium]], located in [[Houston]], [[Texas]]. Construction on the stadium began in 1962, and it officially opened in 1965. It served as home to the [[Houston Astros]] of [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) from its opening in 1965 until 1999, and the home to the [[Houston Oilers]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL) from 1968 until 1996, and also the part-time home of the [[Houston Rockets]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) from 1971 until 1975. Additionally, the Astrodome was the primary venue of the [[Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo]] from 1966 until 2002. When opened, it was named the '''Harris County Domed Stadium''' and was nicknamed the "[[Eighth Wonder of the World]]".&lt;ref&gt;Barks, Joseph V. "[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3726/is_200111/ai_n9011574 Powering the (new and improved) 'Eighth Wonder of the World'] ", Electrical Apparatus, November 2001. Retrieved January 16, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the original natural grass playing surface died, the Astrodome became the first major sports venue to install [[artificial turf]], which became known as [[AstroTurf]]. In another technological first, the Astrodome featured the "Astrolite", which was the first animated scoreboard. The Astrodome was renovated in 1988, expanding seating and altering many original features.

By the 1990s, the Astrodome was becoming obsolete. Unable to secure a new stadium, Oilers owner [[Bud Adams]] moved the team to Tennessee after the 1996 season, where they eventually became the [[Tennessee Titans]]. The Astros played at the dome through the 1999 season, before relocating to Enron Field (later changed to [[Minute Maid Park]]) in 2000, while the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo continued to be held at the Astrodome until the opening of the adjacent [[NRG Stadium]] in 2002. Although it no longer had any primary tenants, the venue regularly hosted events during the early 2000s, and in 2005, was used as a shelter for residents of New Orleans affected by [[Hurricane Katrina]]. The Astrodome was declared non-compliant with [[fire code]] by the [[Houston Fire Department]] in 2008 and parts of it were demolished in 2013 after several years of disuse. In 2014 it was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name="NRHP listing" /&gt;

==History==

===Conception===
[[Major League Baseball]] expanded to Houston in 1960 when the National League agreed to add two teams. The Houston Colt .45s (renamed the [[Houston Astros|Astros]] in 1965) were to begin play in 1962, along with their expansion brethren [[New York Mets]]. [[Roy Hofheinz]], a former [[List of mayors of Houston|mayor of Houston]], and his group were granted the franchise after they promised to build a covered stadium. It was thought a covered stadium was a must for a major league team to be viable in Houston due to the area's [[subtropical climate]] and hot summers. Game-time temperatures are usually above {{Convert|97|F|C|0}} in July and August, with high humidity and a likelihood of rain. Hofheinz claimed inspiration for what became the Astrodome when he was on a tour of Rome, where he learned that the builders of the ancient [[Colosseum]] installed giant ''[[velarium|velaria]]'' to shield spectators from the Roman sun.

The Astrodome was conceived by Hofheinz as early as 1952, when he and his daughter Dede were rained out once too often at [[Buffalo Stadium]], home of Houston's minor league baseball team, the [[Houston Buffaloes|Houston Buffs]]. Hofheinz abandoned his interest in the world's first air-conditioned shopping mall, [[The Galleria (Houston)|The Galleria]], and set his sights on bringing major league baseball to Houston.&lt;ref name="Storied"/&gt;

===Design and construction===
The Astrodome was designed by architects Hermon Lloyd &amp; W. B. Morgan, and Wilson, Morris, Crain and Anderson (Morris Architects). Structural engineering and structural design was performed by [[Walter P Moore Engineers and Consultants]] of Houston. It was constructed by H. A. Lott, Inc. for [[Harris County, Texas]]. It stands 18 stories tall, covering {{Convert|9.5|acre}}. The dome is {{Convert|710|ft}} in diameter and the ceiling is {{Convert|208|ft}} above the playing surface, which itself sits {{Convert|25|ft}} below street level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-statistics.com/Ballparks/Hou/Astrodome.htm |title=Houston Astros – Stadium |publisher=Baseball-statistics.com |date= |accessdate=April 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Astrodome (Houston) Skylights.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Astrodome Skylights]]

The scoreboard, eventually known as the "Astrolite", was designed by [[Fair Play Scoreboards]] of Des Moines, Iowa.&lt;ref name="Astrolite"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-09-04/sports/sp-2073_1_astrodome-scoreboard |title=Astrodome Scoreboard Headed for Scrap Heap |author=Graczyk, Michael L. |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=September 4, 1988 |accessdate=February 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having designed the scoreboard for [[Dodger Stadium]] several years prior, team owner Roy Hofheinz was not impressed with the initial proposal for a much more generic type of scoreboard. Project designer Jack Foster teamed up with a creative professional based in Kansas City to create the first animated scoreboard. Its reported cost was $2.1 million.&lt;ref name="Astrolite" /&gt;

The Dome was completed in November 1964, six months ahead of schedule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Prominent-Houstonians-ideas-on-what-to-do-with-1683126.php |title=Prominent Houstonians' ideas on what to do with Dome|work=Houston Chronicle |date=April 4, 2011 |accessdate=April 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many engineering changes were required during construction, including the modest flattening of the supposed "hemispherical roof" to cope with environmentally induced structural deformation and the use of a new paving process called "lime stabilization" to cope with changes in the chemistry of the soil. The [[air conditioning]] system was designed by Houston [[mechanical engineers]] Israel A. Naman and Jack Boyd Buckley of I. A. Naman + Associates.

The multi-purpose stadium, designed to facilitate both football and baseball, is nearly circular and uses movable lower seating areas. It also ushered in the era of other fully domed stadiums, such as the [[Mercedes-Benz Superdome]] in [[New Orleans]], as well as the now-demolished [[Pontiac Silverdome]] near [[Detroit]], [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]] in [[Minneapolis]], [[Kingdome]] in [[Seattle]], and [[RCA Dome]] in [[Indianapolis]].

To test what effect the enclosed air-conditioned environment might have on the delivery of [[breaking ball]]s, [[Satchel Paige]], in full Astros uniform, threw the first pitches at the Astrodome on February 7, 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Dome is Hurlers' Heaven |work=[[The San Bernardino Sun]] |date=April 11, 1965 |page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=No Real Difference: Baseball Won't Change Indoors |author=Tagliabue, Emil |work=[[Corpus Christi Caller-Times]] |date=February 11, 1965 |page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later concluded that it was a "pitcher's paradise", as the lack of wind allowed for sensitive pitches to maneuver more easily.

Hofheinz had an opulent apartment in the Dome, which was removed when the facility was remodeled in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;Conniff, Richard  [http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1127102/index.htm Farewell To An Odd Dome Home Judge Hofheinz's private Astrodome quarters will soon be just a gaudy memory].

===Opening and reception===
On Opening Day, April 9, 1965, a sold-out crowd of 47,879 watched an exhibition game between the Houston Astros and the [[New York Yankees]]. President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] and his wife [[Lady Bird Johnson|Lady Bird]] were in attendance, as well as [[Texas Governor]] [[John Connally]] and [[Houston Mayor]] [[Louie Welch]]. Governor Connally tossed out the first ball for the first game ever played indoors. [[Turk Farrell|Dick "Turk" Farrell]] of the Astros threw the first pitch. [[Mickey Mantle]] had both the first hit (a single) and the first home run in the Astrodome. The Astros beat the Yankees that night, 2-1.&lt;ref name=OZY&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ozy.com/flashback/when-texas-opened-the-eighth-wonder-of-the-world/40459 | title=Flashback: When Texas Opened the 8th Wonder of the World | work=[[OZY]] | date=April 9, 2015 | accessdate=May 22, 2015 | author=Braswell, Sean}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President Johnson stopped at the Astrodome that evening en route to his home in Johnson City and paid his respects to baseball and Astros president Roy Hofheinz, a campaign manager for Johnson in the 1940s, just as the second inning got underway. He and Lady Bird watched the opening night game from behind the glass in Judge Hofheinz' private box high in right field just to the right of the giant scoreboard. LBJ ate hors d'œuvres and chicken and ice cream while watching the game.&lt;ref name=OZY/&gt; "Roy, I want to congratulate you; it shows so much imagination", he was heard to say. Later, he called the stadium "massive" and "beautiful." Although the president's visit overshadowed all others, dignitaries swarmed through the "Eighth Wonder of the World" during the three days of the exhibition series and for opening night against the [[1965 Philadelphia Phillies season|Phillies]] on April 12. Chris Short of the Phillies shut out the Astros on four hits, with 12 strikeouts.&lt;ref&gt;"Bob Hulsey (April 9, 1965). {{cite web |url = http://www.astrosdaily.com/history/19650409/|title = First Game In The Astrodome: The Indoor Era Begins}}''AstrosDaily''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Wilson (April 24, 1965). {{cite web |url = http://www.astrosdaily.com/history/19650409/#article|title = Everyone in Orbit Over Astrodome –  LBJ, Plus 188,762 Attend Liftoff of 'Eighth Wonder' }}''[[The Sporting News]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first artist to play the Astrodome was [[Judy Garland]] on December 17, 1965, where she was paid $43,000 for the one show. [[The Supremes]] were her opening act and tickets were priced $1.00 to $7.50. The dome seated 48,000, with another 12,000 seats added for this show. Garland appeared on stage at 10 p.m. and sang for 40 minutes, with her set of songs including: "He's Got The Whole World In His Hands"; "Just In Time"; "My Kind Of Town, Houston Is"/"Houston"; "As Long As He Needs Me"; "Joey, Joey, Joey"; "Do It Again"; "What Now My Love?"; "By Myself"; "Rock-A-Bye Your Baby"; "San Francisco"; "Chicago"; and "Over The Rainbow." [[Mort Lindsey]] conducted.&lt;ref name="Schechter2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Scott Schechter|title=Judy Garland: The Day-by-Day Chronicle of a Legend|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GMtT0rOMyS4C|accessdate=April 9, 2013|date=August 25, 2006|publisher=Taylor Trade Publishing|isbn=978-1-4616-3555-0|page=310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===June 15, 1976 "The Rainout"===
Ironically, the Astrodome suffered a [[Rainout (sports)|rainout]] on June 15, 1976. The [[1976 Houston Astros season|Astros]]' scheduled game against the [[1976 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pittsburgh Pirates]] was called when massive flooding in the Houston area prevented all but a few fans from reaching the stadium. Both teams had arrived early for practice, but the umpires were several hours late. At 5pm that day, with only a handful of fans on hand and already several hours behind, the umpires and teams agreed to call the game off. Tables were brought onto the field and the teams ate dinner together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/life/hoffman/6485163.html |title=Hoffman: Astros made history with a rainout|work=Houston Chronicle |date=June 17, 2009 |accessdate=April 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Astros still had a home series with Pittsburgh in August, this game was made up in Pittsburgh in July.

===Recent history===
[[File:Astrodome interior 2004.jpg|right|180px|thumb|Astrodome interior in 2004]]
In 1989, four cylindrical pedestrian ramp columns were constructed outside the Dome for [[accessibility]]. This enabled the Astrodome to comply with the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]].

The [[1992 Republican National Convention]] was held at the Astrodome in August of that year. The [[1992 Houston Astros season|Astros]] accommodated the convention by taking a month-long road trip.

On August 19, 1995, a scheduled preseason game between the [[1995 Houston Oilers season|Oilers]] and the [[1995 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego Chargers]] had to be canceled due to the dilapidated condition of the playing field. Oilers owner [[Bud Adams]] demanded a new stadium, but the city of Houston refused to fund it. After years of threats, Adams moved the team to [[Tennessee Titans|Tennessee]] after the 1996 season.&lt;ref name="governing1"&gt;{{cite web |last=Holeywell |first=Ryan |url=http://www.governing.com/topics/economic-dev/when-team-leaves-its-stadium-what-do-you-do.html |title=When Teams Leave, What Do You Do With the Stadium? |publisher=Governing.com |date=November 30, 2011 |accessdate=April 2, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508053624/http://www.governing.com/topics/economic-dev/when-team-leaves-its-stadium-what-do-you-do.html |archive-date=May 8, 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Around that time the Astros also threatened to leave the city unless a new ballpark was built.&lt;ref name="governing1"/&gt; The retractable-roofed Enron Field (now known as [[Minute Maid Park]]) opened for the [[2000 Houston Astros season|2000 season]] in downtown Houston.

One of the largest crowds in the Astrodome's history, more than 66,746 fans, came on Sunday, February 26, 1995, to see [[Tejano music|Tejano]] superstar [[Selena]] and her band Los Dinos perform for a sell-out crowd during the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tejanomusicvideos.com/play.php?vid=2249 |title=Mazz - Cuando Tu Te Vayas.wmv |publisher=Tejanomusicvideos.com |date= |accessdate=April 2, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140114114649/http://www.tejanomusicvideos.com/play.php?vid=2249 |archivedate=January 14, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Selena y Los Dinos performed two consecutive times before at the Astrodome, breaking previous attendance records each time. This was Selena's last televised concert before she was [[Murder of Selena|fatally shot]] on March 31, 1995 by [[Yolanda Saldívar|her fan club president]].
[[File:Astrophoto of Astrodome.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[NRG Park]] area, Houston, Texas. Astrodome, with [[NRG Stadium]] at center of this 2010 astronaut photo]]

The Astrodome was joined by a new neighbor in [[2002 Houston Texans season|2002]], the retractable-roofed Reliant Stadium (now known as [[NRG Stadium]]), which was built to house Houston's new [[National Football League|NFL]] franchise, the [[Houston Texans]]. The [[Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo]] moved to the new venue in 2003, leaving the Astrodome without any major tenants. The last concert at the Astrodome was [[George Strait]] &amp; the [[Ace in the Hole Band]] during the 2002 Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, before a record crowd of 68,266; the performance was recorded in ''[[For the Last Time: Live from the Astrodome]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thomas |first=Stephen |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/for-the-last-time-live-from-the-astrodome-r626617 |title=For the Last Time: Live from the Astrodome – George Strait : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic |date=February 11, 2003 |accessdate=April 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hurricane Katrina===
[[File:Katrina-14637.jpg|thumb|Survivors of Katrina in the Astrodome, 2005]]
On August 31, 2005, in the wake of [[Hurricane Katrina]], the [[Harris County, Texas|Harris County]] Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management and the State of [[Louisiana]] came to an agreement to allow at least 25,000 evacuees from [[New Orleans]], especially those that were sheltered in the [[Louisiana Superdome]], to move to the Astrodome until they could return home. The evacuation began on September 1, 2005. All scheduled events for the final four months of 2005 at the Astrodome were cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/news/story?id=2148638 |title=Superdome evacuation disrupted after shots fired |website=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2005-09-02 |accessdate=2017-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overflow refugees were held in the surrounding Reliant Park complex. There was a full field hospital inside the Reliant Arena, which cared for the entire Katrina evacuee community.

The entire Reliant Park complex was scheduled to be emptied of hurricane evacuees by September 17, 2005. Originally, the Astrodome was planned to be used to house evacuees until December. However, the surrounding parking lots were needed for the first Houston Texans home game. Arrangements were made to help Katrina evacuees find apartments both in Houston and elsewhere in the United States. By September 16, 2005, the last of the hurricane evacuees living in the Astrodome had been moved out either to the neighboring Reliant Arena or to permanent housing north of Houston.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2005-08-31-astrodome_x.htm | work=USA Today | first1=Thomas | last1=Frank | title=Astrodome to take refugees | date=September 1, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of September 20, 2005, the remaining Katrina evacuees were relocated to [[Arkansas]] due to [[Hurricane Rita]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/sep/21/nation/na-rita21/3 | work=Los Angeles Times | first1=John-Thor | last1=Dahlburg | first2=Scott | last2=Gold | first3=Maria L. | last3=La Ganga | title=Hurricane Rita Rattles Coast | date=September 21, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Closure==
In 2008, the facility was cited for numerous code violations. Since then, only maintenance workers and security guards have been allowed to enter the stadium while it is brought up to code.&lt;ref name="code violations"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.click2houston.com/news/16918767/detail.html |title=Astrodome Hit With Code Violations |accessdate=July 18, 2008 |publisher=click2houston.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080722053539/http://www.click2houston.com/news/16918767/detail.html |archivedate=July 22, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The city council rejected demolition plans on environmental grounds, over concerns that demolition of the Dome might damage the dense development that today closely surrounds it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.khou.com/news/Harris-County-officials-consider-the-future-of-the-Astrodome-145849295.html |title=Harris County officials consider the future of the Astrodome &amp;#124; khou.com Houston |publisher=Khou.com |date=April 2, 2012 |accessdate=April 2, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103093020/http://www.khou.com/news/Harris-County-officials-consider-the-future-of-the-Astrodome-145849295.html |archivedate=November 3, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Refurbishment plans==
Houston's plan to host the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] included renovating the Astrodome for use as a main stadium.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20151118200329/https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1683&amp;dat=20020626&amp;id=170aAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=lz8EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4576,4598265 ]&lt;/ref&gt; Houston became one of the [[USOC]]'s bid finalists, but the organization chose New York City as its candidate city and the Games were ultimately awarded to London by the [[IOC]].
[[File:The Astrodome, aerial view.jpg|thumb|190px|An aerial view of the Astrodome in 1999]]
Plans to convert the Astrodome into a luxury hotel were rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Financial-crunch-may-stall-effort-on-Astrodome-1647842.php |title=Financial crunch may stall effort on Astrodome hotel|work=Houston Chronicle |date=December 8, 2008 |accessdate=April 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A proposal to convert the Astrodome into a movie production studio was also considered but rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wrigley |first=Deborah |url=http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/story?section=news/local&amp;id=6111544 |title=Proposal suggests turning Astrodome into movie studio &amp;#124; abc13.com |website=Abclocal.go.com |date=2008-04-29 |accessdate=2017-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of the type of renovation, all renovation plans must deal with the problem of occupancy code violations that have basically shuttered the Astrodome for the near future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Liz Austin Peterson |url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/business/realestate/6273706.html |title=Broken-down Astrodome may have seen its last rodeo |website=Chron.com |date=2009-02-20 |accessdate=2017-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2013, a comprehensive plan was unveiled that would have seen the aging structure undergo an almost $200 million renovation into a multi-purpose event/convention facility. The measure would have to have been approved first through a bond election in Harris County for the publicly funded project to go forward or else, officials warned, the iconic structure would be demolished.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khou.com/news/Fans-react-to-194-million-Astrodome-renovation-plan-212266641.html Fans React to ,4 Million Astrodome Renovation Plan] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215183014/http://www.khou.com/news/Fans-react-to-194-million-Astrodome-renovation-plan-212266641.html |date=December 15, 2013 }} Retrieved November 5, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Voters ended up rejecting the measure on November 5, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/story?section=news/local&amp;id=9313897 |title=Voters strike down proposal to save Astrodome &amp;#124; abc13.com |website=Abclocal.go.com |date=2013-11-06 |accessdate=2017-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2013 referendum and aftermath===
On November 5, 2013, voters in Houston turned down a $213 million referendum to renovate and convert the Astrodome into a state-of-the-art convention center and exhibition space known as "New Dome Experience".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hernandez |first=Pat |url=http://app1.kuhf.org/articles/1376411501-Astrodome-Referendum-Will-Be-On-The-November-Ballot.html |title=Astrodome Referendum Will Be On The November Ballot |publisher=App1.kuhf.org |date=August 13, 2013 |accessdate=March 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until a final disposition is made, [[Harris County, Texas|Harris County]] commissioners will not approve demolition of the stadium. "The building's still there. There's no formal plan or authorization to demolish the building, and until somebody brings such a plan to fruition, there's a chance," according to Willie Loston, executive director of the Harris County Sports and Convention Corporation. "The proposal was rejected by the voters. We're back to where we were. Square one," according to Steve Radack, Harris County commissioner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csnhouston.com/texans/astrodome-may-see-1-last-inning-after-no-vote?ocid=yahoo |title=Astrodome may see 1 last inning after 'no' vote |publisher=CSN Houston |date=November 10, 2013 |accessdate=March 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three exterior pedestrian ramp towers were demolished on December 8, 2013. Around that time, the ramp bridges were disconnected from the main structure and the surrounding grass berms were lowered. The ticket booths were also removed along with the interior seats. The demolition was planned prior to the referendum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chron.com/default/article/3-pedestrian-towers-razed-at-Houston-Astrodome-5047730.php 3 pedestrian towers razed at Houston Astrodome.] ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'', December 9, 2013.

===Astrodome Indoor City Park===
After the failed bond election of 2013, the county went back to the drawing board and in August 2014 the County Commissioners Court announced a new plan to save and rejuvenate the Astrodome. The new concept centered around leaving the Dome's roof intact and converting the Astrodome's vast central space into a covered semi-climate-controlled city park that could have flexible uses for both public recreation and gatherings such as festivals and concerts. The remainder of the complex would have been redeveloped over time using a combination of public and private funds and include elements such as an educational exploration area to encourage students to learn about the sciences and engineering and possibly meeting, exhibition, and restaurant areas that would not only serve the general public, but could also add value to the Houston Texans' Game Day Experiences and be used by the Rodeo. A key element of this proposal centered around the ability for the county to proceed with the initial phases of the project using existing funds without having to seek voter approval for an expensive bond referendum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/houston/article/New-Astrodome-concept-would-turn-the-landmark-8196601.php|title=New Astrodome concept would turn the landmark into an outdoor, usable space|website=Chron.com|accessdate=2017-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this plan failed as well.

===Astrodome Revitalization Project===
After the failed plans of past years, the Astrodome Revitalization Project was proposed in September 2016. This plan would turn the dome into a massive underground parking garage. Specifically, the first step would raise the dome floor and use the space underneath that as parking, leaving the floor above for other uses. On September 27, 2016, the Harris County Commissioners approved the first part of the plan. This marked a major turning point for the dome, as some feared if the plan wasn't approved the building would be demolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Astrodome-parking-plan-could-save-Houston-s-9240124.php|title=Astrodome parking plan could save Houston's historic 8th Wonder|website=Chron.com|accessdate=2017-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/houston/news/2016/09/27/astrodome-renovation-project-gets-approved.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-10-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005120903/http://www.bizjournals.com/houston/news/2016/09/27/astrodome-renovation-project-gets-approved.html |archivedate=October 5, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/What-105-million-buys-for-the-Astrodome-9289084.php|title=What $105 million buys for the Astrodome|website=Chron.com|accessdate=2017-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 27, 2017, the Texas Historical Commission voted unanimously to designate the dome a State Antiquities Landmark.&lt;ref name=SAL&gt;{{Cite news|title=Astrodome joins Alamo as state antiquities landmark|url=http://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Astrodome-joins-Alamo-as-state-antiquities-10889746.php?t=433c576c3e438d9cbb|last=Banks|first=Gabrielle|newspaper=[[Houston Chronicle]]|date=January 27, 2017|location=Houston, Texas|access-date=January 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the designation, the Astrodome may no longer be removed, altered, damaged, salvaged, or excavated without a permit from the commission.&lt;ref name=THC/&gt;

*At the beginning of the 1980 play off series between the Astros and the Phillies, KILT AM radio announced that the Astros number one fan "Astroman" would live on top of the Domed stadium and would not come down until the Astros won the World Series. Over the next 10 days Astroman, played by KILT salesman Denver Griffith, lived on top of the Astrodome in a six-man tent. On top of the Astrodome was also a telephone hot line back to KILT radio where Griffith as Astroman would give interviews throughout the day. Astroman was completely cut off and could only get food and drink by lowering a rope with a basket the 18 stories from the top of the Astrodome to the center of the playing field. At one point Griffith got so desperate for food and drink that his mother had to intervene and interrupt an Oilers practice so that the needed supplies could be delivered. Every night a local TV station would sign off with a shot of Astroman on top of the Astrodome waving to a circling news chopper.
*On October 15, 1986 the Astros and the visiting [[New York Mets]] played Game 6 of the [[1986 National League Championship Series|1986 NLCS]]. The 16-inning contest was at the time the longest game in MLB post season history. The [[1986 New York Mets season|Mets]] would take a 7-4 lead into the bottom of the 16th inning and hold on for a 7-6 victory over the [[1986 Houston Astros season|Astros]]. Ironically, the record was broken in Houston 19 years later at [[Minute Maid Park]] during the [[2005 National League Division Series|2005 NLDS]] when the [[2005 Houston Astros season|Astros]] won an 18-inning game against the [[2005 Atlanta Braves season|Atlanta Braves]].
* On October 3, 1999, the [[1999 Houston Astros season|Astros]] played their final regular season game at the Astrodome, clinching the NL Central Division title with a 9–4 win over the [[1999 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Dodgers]]. The final Astros game in the stadium occurred 6 days later when the [[1999 Atlanta Braves season|Braves]] eliminated the Astros in Game 4 of the Division Series.

===Basketball===
*The [[Game of the Century (college basketball)|Game of the Century]] between the [[University of Houston]] [[1967–68 Houston Cougars men's basketball team|Cougars]] and the [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] [[1967–68 UCLA Bruins men's basketball team|Bruins]] took place at the Astrodome on January 20, 1968 before a crowd of 52,963—the record for the largest attendance ever at a basketball game until 2003. The first [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] regular season game broadcast nationwide in prime time, the Game of the Century established college basketball as a sports commodity on television, and paved the way for the modern "March Madness" television coverage. The Cougars, coached by [[Guy V. Lewis]], defeated coach [[John Wooden]]'s Bruins, led by [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar|Lew Alcindor]], 71-69 behind a 39-point scoring effort from [[Elvin Hayes]].
*The Astrodome hosted the [[1989 NBA All-Star Game]]. Attendance was 44,735 and [[Karl Malone]] won [[NBA All-Star Game MVP|MVP]] honors.

===Tennis===
The [[Battle of the Sexes (tennis)|Battle of the Sexes]] [[tennis]] match occurred on September 20, 1973, aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] with [[Billie Jean King]] defeating the late [[Bobby Riggs]] in three straight sets. While more of a publicity stunt than a serious match, it made national headlines and stands as a milestone in the progress of women's sports. Scenes were filmed here in the 2017 film ''[[Battle of the Sexes (2017 film)|Battle Of The Sexes]]'' which starred [[Emma Stone]] &amp; [[Steve Carell]], who respectively played these players.

===Boxing &amp; WWE===
*Three-time World Heavyweight Boxing Champion [[Muhammad Ali]] fought [[Cleveland Williams]] in the Astrodome in November 1966.
*On April 1, 2001, the [[WWE]] (then known as the WWF) hosted [[WrestleMania X-Seven]], which set an all-time record attendance for the Astrodome of 67,925. The main event of the card saw Texas native [[Steve Austin|"Stone Cold" Steve Austin]] challenge and defeat [[WWE Championship|WWF Champion]] [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] in a No Disqualification Match for The Rock's Championship. The card also featured the first of Houston native [[The Undertaker|The Undertaker's]] three [[WrestleMania]] victories over [[Triple H]], and the second [[Tables, Ladders and Chairs Match]] between [[Edge &amp; Christian]], [[The Dudley Boyz]] and [[The Hardy Boyz]]. The card is perceived by many fans and wrestling historians to be the greatest WrestleMania ever.

===Concerts===
* Live! The Last Concert is a live album by Mexican-American singer [[Selena]]. It was recorded on February 26, 1995, at the Houston Astrodome and was televised live on Univision. Over 60,000 people attended 
*[[Elvis Presley]] gave six performances there between February and March 1970, setting an attendance record with 200,000 over the six shows. He performed there again on March 3, 1974, setting a single day attendance record.
*[[Pink Floyd]] played a concert on November 18, 1987 as part of their [[A Momentary Lapse of Reason Tour|A Momentary Lapse of Reason Tour]].
* September 4, 1992; Co-headlining tour of Metallica and Guns N' Roses with special guest Faith No More. News footage of this concert can be found on YouTube at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CsH-TnpBdI. Additionally, [[MTV]] filmed an episode of Live n' Loud during the show. Footage from that can also be seen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw3NU8J_zal

===Motorsports===
The Astrodome held several motorsports events throughout its lifetime. The [[AMA Grand National Championship]] held events starting in 1968 and running for 18 years, utilizing the Short Track and TT Steeplechase track configurations in their visits. The [[AMA Supercross Championship]] held its first ever indoor Supercross at the Astrodome in 1974, won by [[Jim Pomeroy (motocross)|Jim Pomeroy]]. In the mid-1980s the [[Mickey Thompson Entertainment Group]] held several Stadium Off-Road Racing Series events, showcasing such drivers as [[Ivan Stewart]], [[Robby Gordon]], and [[Walker Evans]]. Beginning in the early 1980s, both [[TNT Motorsports]] and the [[United States Hot Rod Association]] held events showcasing mud bogging, truck and tractor pulling, and monster trucks in the Astrodome. After a buy-out of TNT Motorsports, the USHRA continued holding events that would later transform into the current [[Monster Jam]] events.

With the opening of [[NRG Stadium]] in late 2002, the events held in early 2002 by AMA Supercross and Monster Jam would be their last in the Astrodome before moving next door for 2003, where they continue to hold events every year.

*[[KTRK-TV]] Channel 13 Eyewitness News anchorman [[Dave Ward (reporter)|Dave Ward]] was injured during a motocross exhibition race (which also included Channel 13 sports anchor Bob Allen, as well as other local media figures) in the Astrodome in the early 1970s.
*[[Evel Knievel]] jumped 13 cars two nights in a row, drawing over 100,000 spectators to the Astrodome in January 1971, and though there was talk of him making an actual jump over the stadium itself sometime in the future, it never happened.
*The Astro Spiral car jump was performed January 12, 1972, by Chick Galiano of J.M. Productions' Hell Drivers. This stunt was later performed in the 1974 [[James Bond]] film ''[[The Man with the Golden Gun (film)|The Man With The Golden Gun]]''.

'''&lt;big&gt;Domecoming&lt;/big&gt;'''

On April 9, 2018, the Astrodome was used as a museum for the event known as "Domecoming"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://astrodomeconservancy.org/domecoming/|title=Join Us for Domecoming – April 9, 2018 – Astrodome Conservancy|website=astrodomeconservancy.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===In popular culture===
*[[Robert Altman]]'s 1970 comedy film ''[[Brewster McCloud]]'' is set at the Astrodome: the eponymous hero is an eccentric young man who lives at the stadium.
*The 1972 special ''[[Road Company]]'' was videotaped here, which starred [[Dom DeLuise]], [[Bob Hynes]], [[Sheila MacRae]] &amp; [[Kenny Rogers]].

*In 2004, the Astrodome was the setting of the 1988 5A Football State Championship in the movie ''[[Friday Night Lights (film)|Friday Night Lights]]'', between the [[Permian High School|Permian Panthers]] and the [[David W. Carter High School|Carter High Cowboys]].
*The Astrodome is a playable field on [[MVP Baseball 2005]] as in the 1999 format.

==Awards and recognitions==
*On June 19, 2013, the Astrodome was named to the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]]'s annual list of [[America's Most Endangered Historic Places|America's 11 Most Endangered Historic Places]] as well as to its [https://savingplaces.org/national-treasures National Treasures] portfolio.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chron.com/opinion/outlook/article/National-spotlight-shines-on-Dome-4639324.php|title=National spotlight shines on Dome|work=Houston Chronicle|access-date=2017-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Astrodome was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article/hou/astrodome-lands-on-national-register-of-historic-places?ymd=20140201&amp;content_id=67351980&amp;fs=true |title=Astrodome lands on National Register of Historic Places &amp;#124; astros.com: News |publisher=Mlb.mlb.com |date= |accessdate=March 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The dome celebrated its 50th anniversary on April 9, 2015. A time capsule buried under the site at the time of construction was located. However, it was not extricated to celebrate the occasion, based on concerns about the cost and potential to compromise the structure of a retaining wall. This was also one of the very few times that the Astrodome has been open for the public since 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Banks |first=Gabrielle |url=http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Search-for-Dome-time-capsule-hits-a-snag-6233773.php |title=Search for Dome time capsule hits a snag |publisher=Hearst Newspapers |accessdate= May 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 2017, the [[Texas Historical Commission]] designated the dome as a [[Texas State Antiquities Landmark|State Antiquities Landmark]].&lt;ref name=THC&gt;{{cite press release|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|title=Houston Astrodome Receives State Antiquities Landmark Designation from Texas Historical Commission|url=http://www.thc.texas.gov/news-events/press-releases/houston-astrodome-receives-state-antiquities-landmark-designation-texas|location=Austin, Texas|agency=[[Texas Historical Commission]]|access-date=January 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==

===Scoreboard===
[[File:Astrodome scoreboard 1969.jpg|thumb|260px|Astrolite, the Astrodome's scoreboard, during a 1969 Astros game. It was the world's first animated scoreboard.]]
The Astrodome was well-renowned for a four-story scoreboard called the "Astrolite", composed of thousands of light bulbs that featured numerous animations. After every Astros home run, the scoreboard featured a minute-long animated celebration of pistols, bulls, and fireworks. The scoreboard remained intact until 1988 when [[Houston Oilers]] (now [[Tennessee Titans]]) owner [[Bud Adams]] suggested the removal of the scoreboard to accommodate increased capacity demands for football, baseball and the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo. [[Harris County, Texas|Harris County]] spent $67 million of public funds on renovations.&lt;ref name="Loser"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fowler |first=Ed |title=Loser Takes All – Bud Adams, Bad Football, &amp; Big Business |publisher=Longview Press |page=8 |year=1997 |isbn=1-56352-432-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 15,000 new seats resembling the 1970s rainbow uniform pattern were installed to bring [[seating capacity]] to almost 60,000 for football. On September 5, 1988, a final celebration commemorating the scoreboard occurred prior to expansion renovations.

===Playing surface===
Originally, the stadium's surface was a Tifway 419 [[Bermuda grass]], specifically bred for indoor use. The dome's ceiling contained thousands of semitransparent panes made of [[Lucite]].&lt;ref name=agfwpt&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=5Q8dAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=A5sEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1385%2C3450389 |work=Tuscaloosa News |location=(Alabama)|agency=Associated Press |title=Astrodome glare fades with paint |date=April 23, 1966 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players quickly complained that glare coming off of the panes made it hard for them to track fly balls; to solve the problem, two sections of panes were painted white in April.&lt;ref name=agfwpt/&gt;&lt;ref name=ndsant&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GjlWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=AOkDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4293%2C3262038 |work=Spokesman-Review |location=(Spokane, Washington) |agency=Associated Press |title=Dome needs another coat |date=May 24, 1965 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, within a few months, the grass died from lack of sunlight.&lt;ref name="Cathedrals"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lowry|first=Phillip|title=Green Cathedrals|year=2005|publisher=Walker &amp; Company|location=New York City|isbn=0-8027-1562-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; For most of the [[1965 Houston Astros season|1965]] season, the Astros played on green-painted dirt and dead grass. The clear panels also added a problem when combined with the natural grass. The grass tended to hold, then release moisture, often resulting in rain within the structure, causing games to be delayed while the grounds crews cleaned up the playing surface.
[[File:Astros clinch playoff berth!.jpg|thumb|left|The playing surface in {{mlby|1999}}.]]

The solution was to install a new type of artificial grass on the field, [[ChemGrass]], which became known as [[AstroTurf]]. Because the supply of AstroTurf was still low, only a limited amount was available at the start of the [[1966 Houston Astros season|1966]] season. There was not enough for the entire outfield, so the first phase covered only the traditional grass portion of the infield and foul territory,&lt;ref name=asplfhf&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uPwrAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=y8cEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6321,1673684|newspaper=Florence (AL) Times|title=Astroturf planned for Houston field|agency=Associated Press|date=March 13, 1966|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; at a cost of $2 per square foot. It was installed in time to test out during exhibition games against the Dodgers in March.&lt;ref name=algbt&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=R6tVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=NOEDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6860,4760340  |newspaper=Eugene Register-Guard|agency=Associated Press|title=Astroturf looks great, but...|date=March 20, 1966|page=2b}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=whnwas&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KFtQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Lg4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5288,6122136|newspaper=Toledo Blade|agency=Associated Press|title=What's new?

The team was sent on an extended road trip before the break, and on July 19, the installation of the outfield portion of AstroTurf was completed for a game with the Phillies, thus covering the entire field with AstroTurf.&lt;ref name=paptoag&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=e7IhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=IpwFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2932,2223710|newspaper=Reading Eagle|location=(Pennsylvania)|agency=Associated Press|title=Phils, Astros plan tonight on artificial grass |date=July 19, 1966|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pfftunf&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=EOdVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=UOEDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5602%2C4123933 |work=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon) |agency=Associated Press |title=Phil find Farrell, turf unfriendly |date=July 20, 1966 |page=3C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groundskeepers dressed as astronauts kept the turf clean with vacuum cleaners between innings. The infield dirt remained in the traditional design, with a large dirt arc, similar to natural grass fields.

In [[1973 Houston Astros season|1973]], the Astros installed an all-AstroTurf infield, except for dirt cutouts around the bases. This "sliding pit" configuration was introduced by [[1970 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati]] with the opening of [[Riverfront Stadium]] on June 30, 1970. It was then installed in the new stadiums in [[Veterans Stadium|Philadelphia]] in [[1971 Philadelphia Phillies season|1971]], and [[Kauffman Stadium|Kansas City]] in [[1973 Kansas City Royals season|1973]]. The artificial turf fields of [[Three Rivers Stadium|Pittsburgh]], [[Busch Memorial Stadium|St. Louis]], and [[Candlestick Park|San Francisco]], all installed in 1970, were traditionally configured like the Astrodome and later changed to sliding pits. San Francisco converted in [[1971 San Francisco Giants season|1971]], Pittsburgh in [[1973 Pittsburgh Pirates season|1973]], and St. Louis in [[1978 St. Louis Cardinals season|1978]]. [[Rogers Centre]] in Toronto was the last park in the majors that had sliding pits; it opened in [[1989 Toronto Blue Jays season|1989]] and switched to a traditional dirt skin infield in [[2016 Toronto Blue Jays season|2016]].

Throughout its history, the Astrodome was known as a pitcher's park. The power alleys were never shorter than {{Convert|370|ft|0}} from the plate; on at least two occasions they were as far as {{Convert|390|ft|0}}. Over time, it gave up fewer home runs than any other park in the National League.&lt;ref name="Storied"&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Curt |authorlink=Curt Smith (author)|title=Storied Stadiums |year=2001 |publisher=Carroll &amp; Graf |location=New York City |isbn=0-7867-1187-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Astrodome's reputation as a pitcher's park continued even in the mid-1980s, when the fences were moved in closer than the Metrodome, which was long reckoned as a hitter's park.

'''Cassie L. Chadwick''' (10 October 1857 – 10 October 1907) is the [[Infamy|infamous]] name used by a [[Canadians|Canadian]] woman who defrauded several U.S. banks out of millions of dollars&lt;ref name="Globe17September1907"/&gt; by claiming to be an illegitimate daughter and heiress of [[Andrew Carnegie]].&lt;ref name="newyorktimes3"/&gt;

==Early life==
She was born '''Elizabeth Bigley''' on 10 October 1857 in [[Eastwood, Ontario]]&lt;ref name="Star11October1907"/&gt; Her parents, Dan and Annie, owned a small farm in Eastwood.  She had three sisters: Alice, Mary, and Emily, and a brother, Bill.  Her father worked for the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] as a section boss&lt;ref name="Star11October1907"/&gt; and was often away from the homestead.

"Betsy", as she was known to her family, was known to daydream and tell fibs as a child.

At the age of 14,&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"/&gt; Chadwick went to [[Woodstock, Ontario]], Canada.  There she opened a bank account with a dubious letter of inheritance from an "unknown" uncle in England and a small amount of cash.  While there, Chadwick passed several worthless cheques to various merchants.  In 1870, she was arrested in Woodstock for [[forgery]].  She was released due to her age and on the grounds of [[Mental Disorder (Insanity) Defense|insanity]].

Following a three-year absence from Eastwood, she returned to discover her sister Alice had married Bill York, a carpenter from [[Cleveland, Ohio]], in 1875.  Alice had moved to Cleveland with her new husband. Chadwick promptly boarded a train and headed south for the United States of America.

==Start in the U.S.==
After a brief stay with her sister and brother-in-law, she rented the lower floor of a house at 149 Garden Street, Cleveland from a Mrs. Brown. Chadwick, claiming to be widowed, assumed the mystic name '''Madame Lydia DeVere'''.&lt;ref name="newyorktimes4"/&gt;  She set up shop as a [[clairvoyant]] with funds from a bank loan on her sister and brother-in-law's furniture.

In 1882, as Lydia DeVere, she married Dr. Wallace S. Springsteen in Cleveland, Ohio.  The couple exchanged vows before a [[Justice of the Peace]] on 21 November 1882.  She took the name '''Mrs. Lydia Springsteen''' and moved into the doctor's house at 3 Garden Street.  A photograph and story appeared in Cleveland's newspaper, ''[[The Plain Dealer]]''.

The newspaper article led her sister, Alice York, and various trades-people to the home of Dr. Springsteen, demanding payment for debts his wife had accumulated.  After Dr. Springsteen confirmed the stories about her past, he threw her out of the house.  Dr. Springsteen filed for divorce (which was granted early in 1883) and settled her debts.

Chadwick again established herself as a clairvoyant in Cleveland.  As '''Madame Marie LaRose''', she met her next husband.  In 1883, she married John R. Scott, a farmer from [[Trumbull County, Ohio]].  She convinced Mr. Scott to sign a [[prenuptial]] agreement, citing abuse from her first husband.  After four years of farm life, she went, prenuptial in hand, to a lawyer in [[Youngstown, Ohio]].  She left a sworn statement confessing [[Adultery#Other consequences|adultery]] and directed her lawyer to file for divorce.

==First U.S. fraud trial==
In 1889 she again resorted to forgery.  Chadwick was convicted and sentenced to 9½ years in a [[Prison|penitentiary]] in [[Toledo, Ohio]].  She was paroled four years later in 1893 and returned to Cleveland, Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hoax of Heiress Ruined Bankers |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&amp;dat=19550130&amp;id=0eQhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=82QEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3685,5921429 |newspaper=[[Sarasota Herald-Tribune]] |date=January 30, 1955 |page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chadwick's third husband==
Upon returning in 1893 to Cleveland, she assumed the name '''Mrs. Cassie Hoover'''.  She opened a [[brothel]] on the city's near west side. At the brothel, she met her next husband, a wealthy widower named Dr. Leroy Chadwick.  Knowing of the doctor's recent loss, Chadwick played the part of a genteel widow, "Mrs. Hoover," who ran a respectable boarding house for women.  When Dr. Chadwick responded that the establishment was a well-known brothel, "Mrs. Hoover" fainted.  Once revived, she claimed that she would never run such an establishment.  She begged the Doctor to immediately take her from the building, lest anyone think she was complicit in its operation.

==As Cassie Chadwick==
[[File:Euclid Avenue Mansion of Cassie Chadwick on Cleveland's Millionaire's Row.jpg|thumb|275px|The [[Euclid Avenue (Cleveland, Ohio)|Euclid Avenue]] residence of Cassie Chadwick]]
In 1897 she married Dr. Chadwick.  During her time as the wife of the highly respected Dr. Chadwick, it is unclear whether he knew that she had given birth to a son, Emil Hoover.  Also, it is unclear whether Dr. Chadwick knew that Emil was in the care of one of the women at the brothel.

She was very good at masking her identity and that of her son.  In court records, she identified herself as single with no children when charged with forgery.  However, in the [[1900 United States Census|1900 United States census]] (District 97, Cleveland, [[Cuyahoga County]] Ohio), she identified herself as '''Cassie Chadwick''', born 3 February 1862 in Pennsylvania.  Her son Emil was enumerated as Emil Chadwick, born September 1886 in Canada.  Following the Carnegie con, Emil Hoover was identified in the newspapers as her son.&lt;ref name="Globe12October1907"/&gt;

Chadwick's spending habits exceeded those of her well-heeled neighbours along Cleveland's [[Euclid Avenue (Cleveland, Ohio)|Euclid Avenue]], then known as "Millionaires' Row".  Instead of being welcomed into the exclusive enclave of the [[Rockefellers]], the [[Mark Hanna|Hannas]], the Hays and the Mathers, Chadwick was thought of as a curious woman who tried in vain to buy the favours of some of the wealthiest families in the nation.  When invited to social events, it was only out of obligation to Dr. Chadwick.

==The Carnegie con==
Following her marriage to Dr. Chadwick in 1897, Chadwick began her largest, most successful con game: that of establishing herself as [[Andrew Carnegie]]'s daughter.  During a visit to [[New York City]], she asked one of her husband's acquaintances, a [[lawyer]] named Dillon, to take her to the home of Andrew Carnegie. In reality, she just visited his housekeeper ostensibly trying to check credentials. When she came back, she dropped a paper. Dillon took it up and noticed it was a [[promissory note]] for $2 million with Carnegie's signature. When Dillon promised to keep her secret, she "revealed" that she was Carnegie's [[illegitimate child]]. Carnegie was supposedly so wracked with guilt that he showered huge amounts of money on her.  She also claimed that there was $7 million in promissory notes tucked away in her Cleveland home, and she was to inherit $400 million upon Carnegie's death.  Dillon arranged a [[safe deposit box]] for her document.

This information leaked to the financial markets in northern Ohio, and [[banking|banks]] began to offer their services. For the next eight years she used this fake background to obtain loans that eventually totalled between $10 and $20 million.&lt;ref name="newyorktimes3"/&gt;  She correctly guessed that no one would ask Carnegie about an illegitimate daughter for fear of embarrassing him.  Also, the loans came with [[usury|usurious]] interest rates, so high in fact, that the bankers wouldn't admit to granting them.  She forged [[securities]] in Carnegie's name for further proof. Bankers assumed that Carnegie would vouch for any debts, and that they would be fully repaid once Carnegie died.

With this money, Chadwick began to live a very lavish lifestyle.  She bought diamond necklaces, enough clothes to fill 30 closets, and a gold organ.  She became known as "the Queen of Ohio."

In November 1904, she received a $190,000 loan from Herbert B. Newton, a [[Brookline, Massachusetts]] banker.&lt;ref name="newyorktimes6"/&gt;  Newton was shocked when he learned of the other loans Chadwick had received, and called his loan in.  Chadwick could not pay and the bank sued.  At the time, she had accumulated debts equal to $5 million. It was also discovered that a number of securities being held for her in various banks were worthless.  When Carnegie was later asked about her, he denied ever knowing her, and further stated he hadn't signed a note in more than 30 years.&lt;ref name="newyorktimes7"/&gt; Chadwick fled to New York, but was soon arrested at her apartment at the Hotel Breslin and taken back to Cleveland.  When she was arrested, she was wearing a money belt containing over $100,000.  Leroy Chadwick and his adult daughter hastily left Cleveland for a European tour when the scandal broke.  However, he did file for divorce before leaving on the tour.

The news sent shockwaves through the Cleveland banking community.  One bank, Citizen's National Bank of [[Oberlin, Ohio|Oberlin]], which had loaned her $800,000, suffered a massive [[bank run|run]] that forced it into bankruptcy.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

==Second U.S. fraud trial==
Andrew Carnegie attended her trial, wishing to see the woman who had successfully conned the nation's bankers into believing that she was his heir.  Other attendees included members of the very Millionaires' Row families from whom she had tried so hard to gain acceptance.  The trial was a media circus.  On 10 March 1905 a Cleveland court sentenced her to 14 years in prison and a fine of $70,000 for conspiracy to bankrupt the Citizen's National Bank and conspiracy against the government (Citizen's Bank, as a federally chartered bank, was an agent of the federal government).

==Prison==
On 1 January 1906, Chadwick was sent to the [[Ohio Penitentiary|Ohio State Penitentiary]] in Columbus.  She brought with her trunks of goods for her prison cell, including clothing, photographs, and furniture.  The prison warden allowed this due to her celebrity status.

As her health deteriorated, Chadwick began writing explicit instructions for her funeral.  She instructed her son Emil to send a portion of her hidden funds to Canada for the purchase of a tombstone for the family plot.  Chadwick suffered a "nervous collapse" 17 September 1907 leaving her blind.&lt;ref name="Globe17September1907"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newyorktimes2"/&gt; The New York Times reported that 9 October 1907 Chadwick was suffering from heart and stomach problems and as Dr. Helmick stated was "much worse."&lt;ref name="newyorktimes1"/&gt;

==Death==
Chadwick died on her birthday in the Columbus penitentiary 10 October 1907&lt;ref name="Globe12October1907"/&gt; (aged 50).  The funeral service was officiated by Reverend F.W. Thompson of College Avenue Methodist Church.&lt;ref name="Globe15October1907"/&gt;  Her interment was 16 October 1907 in the Episcopal Cemetery&lt;ref name="Globe15October1907"/&gt; (present day Woodstock Anglican Cemetery "A" section VanSittart Avenue) [[Woodstock, Ontario]] in her birthplace Canada.  Chadwick's tombstone reads "Elizabeth Bigley wife of L.S. Chadwick, M.D. 1859 - 1907".&lt;ref name="freepages"/&gt;

==Fallout==
For a time, the Chadwick Mansion on [[Euclid Avenue (Cleveland, Ohio)|Euclid Avenue]] (at East 82nd Street) became a tourist destination. In the early 1920s, it was torn down for the construction of the Euclid Avenue Temple (now Liberty Hill Baptist Church).

Other people were involved in the tangled web Chadwick spun.  Her housekeeper, Mrs. Mary Londraville, took a satchel apparently for Chadwick's son that the [[Receivership|receiver]] wanted as he thought it to have contained valuables.&lt;ref name="newyorktimes5"/&gt;  There was a related death.&lt;ref name="chicagodailytribune1"/&gt;

==In popular culture==
She was the subject of the Canadian TV movie ''Love &amp; Larceny'' (1985), where the role of Betsy Bigley was played by [[Jennifer Dale]].&lt;ref name="libraryandarchivescanada"/&gt;
&lt;!--people have written bio's and parital bio's; will try to cite later--&gt;

In the Canadian TV series, [[Murdoch Mysteries]], Cassie Chadwick was played by [[Wendy Crewson]].

{{Tibetan Buddhism}}
'''Chone Monastery''' (Tibetan:  Wylie: ; Chinese: Jonê; Pinyin: Zhuōní), also '''Chone Gonchen Ganden Shedrubling''', or '''Choni Monastery''' was originally a [[Sakya]] monastery. It is situated adjacent to Chone Town, [[Jonê County]], [[Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture]], [[Gansu Province]], China, at an altitude of about 2,610 m (8,563&amp;nbsp;ft).

==History==
:"There are traditions of Tibetan soldiers left behind [after the late 10th century] at several border outposts, such as Chone, where they established viable settlements, and of the remaining Tibetan conscript troops, called the Wun Mo, carving out considerable territory for themselves until they were perhaps absorbed into that amalgam of people of Tibetan stock, which came to form the [[Hsi Hsia Kingdom]] (982—1224)."&lt;ref&gt;Snellgrove &amp; Richardson (1995), p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chone Monastery was founded in 1269 by Drogon Ghogyel [[Phakpa]] (1235–1280) and his [[Mongol]] patron, [[Kublai Khan]] or (Qubilai Qan), in 1269 CE as a Sakya monastery.

Chone Monastery was part of a separate kingdom formed, according to legend, after its invasion by Chinese warriors who migrated across the mountains from [[Szechuan]] conquering the local tribes in 1404. The [[Yongle Emperor]] (May 2, 1360 – August 12, 1424) named one of them hereditary chief, bestowing the name of "Yang" and an imperial seal upon them and the prince established a palace on the north bank of the [[Tao River]]. The Yang family, continued to rule over 48 unruly Tibetan clans in Chon-ne as a semi-independent kingdom from the early 15th century for 23 generations, until 1928, when it was placed under the control of the [[Lanchow]] government.&lt;ref&gt;Cabot (2003, pp. 157-158.&lt;/ref&gt;

Phakpa, who was trusted to rule Tibet by the Mongol Emperor of the Yuan Dynasty, Kublai Khan, visited the area which, until that time was mainly under the influence of the ancient Bon religion. In 1459 the monastery was converted to the [[Gelug]] sect by Choje Rinchen Lingpo.&lt;ref&gt;Osada et al (2004), pp. 186-187.&lt;/ref&gt;

Its colleges were established in the 18th century by Kunkyen Jigme Wangpo. with the School of Dialectics ('''Tsenyl Dratsang''') being founded in 1714 and the Tantric ([[Vajrayana]]) college ('''Gyupa Dratsang''') in 1729.

==Description==
The monastery is situated near a bend in the rushing, clear, Tao River surrounded by high wooded mountains, adjacent to the fairly large [[Chone Town]] which has a mixed population of Tibetans and Chinese, though the Chinese now predominate.&lt;ref&gt;Dorje (2009), p. 813.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1923, the village had "approximately four hundred Tibetan families and had changed very little since its founding six centuries before."&lt;ref&gt;Cabot (2003, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

:"At the entrance to the [monastery] complex is a Chinese pavilion, containing a [[stele]] inscribed in Tibetan and Chinese which commemorates the history of the monastery and its expansion under Manchu patronage during the 18th century."&lt;ref&gt;Dorje (2009), p. 812.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the grounds are six large buildings - only one of which has been ruined (to the left). The Assembly Hall is in the centre with the Gyupa Dratsang is to the right and behind are the Tsenyi Dratsang, the Chora (Debating Garden), the Taknyi Lhakhang which is dedicated to [[Hevajra]] and the Sariwa Lhakhang. The monastery was famed for its 1773 [[woodblock printing|woodblock]] editions of the [[Kangyur]] and [[Tangyur]], copies of which still exist though, unfortunately, the original woodblocks have been damaged beyond repair.&lt;ref&gt;Dorje (2009), p. 812.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the monastery was visited by [[Janet Elliott Wulsin]] and her husband, Frederick Wulsin, in 1923, Chone Monastery had survived numerous earthquakes. On the main gate was an inscription composed by the Kangxi Emperor (4 May 1654 – 20 December 1722) in 1710 which read: "Bestowed by Imperial Command, Temple of Tranquillity" as a favour to a local lama who had visited him in Beijing and returned with 3,000 [[taels]] (each approximately 37&amp;nbsp;grams) of silver, which he used to erect buildings in the monastery. At one time there were 172 buildings including ten chanting halls within the monastery and 3,800 monks. By 1923 the population was only about 700.&lt;ref&gt;Cabot (2003, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

:"Inside the oldest of Choni's chanting halls, dating back five hundred years, Janet and Frederick discovered the enormous gilded figure of [[Tsongkhapa]] with his two disciples. Legend had it that Tsongkhapa had appeared on the stone altar of the monastery in 1714, and, after addressing the crowd on the greatness of his church, became transfigured and ascended into heaven."&lt;ref&gt;Cabot (2003, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;

The monastery now has only about 120 monks which gives it a rather deserted atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;Dorje (2009), p. 813.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Festival==
On the sixth day of the sixth moon (in August/September) the spectacular ''Cham-ngyon-wa'', or "Old Dance," is celebrated at the monastery, representing the souls of the departed.&lt;ref&gt;Cabot (2003, pp. 159-163.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Community Effort Orlando''' (often shortened to '''CEO''') is an annual [[fighting game]] event held in [[Orlando, Florida]]. Introduced in 2010 and organized by '''Alex Jebailey''', the event is known for its strong ties to the [[fighting game community]]. Fighting game players compete in a [[wrestling ring]] during the event's tournaments, and CEO has been a mainstay of the [[Capcom Pro Tour]] since its establishment in 2014. An annual side-event titled '''CEOtaku''' was initiated in 2015.

==Background==
{{quotebox|width=25%|"I have no reason to ever leave Orlando. I went to school here, I grew up here, and I’ve always worked in Orlando. Now, because of CEO and all the other events I get to do, I get to travel, but I always come back to Orlando. It’s a great place."|&amp;ndash;Alex Jebailey&lt;ref name=RedBull2010&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redbull.com/us/en/esports/stories/1331802322815/community-effort-orlando-is-what-it-sounds-like|work=[[Red Bull GmbH|Red Bull]]|title=Community Effort Orlando is What it Sounds Like|last=Alphonse|first=Greg|date=2016-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Described in 2016 as one of the biggest [[fighting game community]] events in the United States by ''[[Red Bull GmbH|Red Bull]]'', CEO has been running annually since 2010 and has grown exponentially every year. Organized by Alex Jebailey, the event is known primarily for emphasizing community spirit. Jebailey's goal for CEO is to ensure the entertainment of all its attendees. The event has an "infamous" [[wrestling ring]] in which tournament players compete and those who reach the finals make "[[WWE]] style entrances".&lt;ref name=RedBull2010 /&gt;

Jebailey himself has been interested in video game competition since 1993, when he won a local ''[[Street Fighter II Turbo]]'' tournament on the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]]. He has competed in various tournaments during the 1990s and 2000s, including ''[[Mortal Kombat]]'' and ''[[Killer Instinct]]'' competitions, as well as professional [[trading card game]] contests. Here, he got the inspiration and experience to become a tournament organizer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redbull.com/us/en/esports/stories/1331745299968/casuals-alex-jebailey-florida-s-ceo-of-the-fgc|work=[[Red Bull GmbH]]|title=Casuals: Alex Jebailey, Florida's CEO of the FGC|last=Martin|first=Michael|date=2015-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jebailey joined [[Iron Galaxy]] in 2014.&lt;ref name=IGN2014&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/03/28/ceo-2014-is-all-about-community|work=[[IGN]]|title=CEO 2014 is All About Community|last=Ingenito|first=Vince|date=2014-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===2010&amp;ndash;2013===
In 2010, there was a fighting game event that was "supposed to" happen in Orlando, but things did not come together until Alex Jebailey was assigned as Tournament Organizer three weeks prior to when the event was planned. He named the event 'Community Effort Orlando', managed the tournament brackets on his own, and ran the stream with one colleague. Florida was not known for having an active fighting game community, though the 2010 open tournament totaled 300 players.&lt;ref name=RedBull2010 /&gt;

CEO was held on June 10&amp;ndash;12 in 2011.&lt;ref name="Chen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2011/05/18/how-one-man-won-10000-playing-mortal-kombat|work=[[IGN]]|title=How One Man Won $10,000 Playing Mortal Kombat|last=Chen|first=James|date=2011-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Orlando Business Journal]]'' reported in 2012 that CEO was growing steadily, having reached 1,600 attendees and 30,000 online viewers. Jebailey stated that his presence on social media such as [[Twitter]] and [[Facebook]] has allowed the event to grow in size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/orlando/print-edition/2012/11/02/jebaileys-ceo-gaming-conference-growing.html|work=[[Orlando Business Journal]]|title=Jebailey’s CEO Gaming conference growing|last=Aboraya|first=Abraham|date=2012-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, CEO was part of the "[[Road to Evo]]" series of major ranking events.&lt;ref name="Chen"/&gt;

CEO 2013 had over 1,800 attendees. The day after winning a CEO tournament, ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom 3]]'' player Noel Brown was arrested for domestic abuse after attacking a fellow tournament player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/top-fighting-gamer-arrested-for-allegedly-hitting-his-e-635549540|work=[[Kotaku]]|title=Top Fighting Gamer Arrested For Allegedly Hitting His Ex-Girlfriend|last=Shreier|first=Jason|date=2013-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2014===
CEO was held on June 27&amp;ndash;29 in 2014 and was one of the ten Premier Events of the first annual [[Capcom Pro Tour]], meaning that high-ranking players of the ''[[Ultra Street Fighter IV]]'' tournament at CEO could qualify for the [[2014 Capcom Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2014/03/10/ready-fight-capcom-partners-with-twitch-for-year-round-street-fighter-league/|work=[[VentureBeat]]|title=Ready?

===2015===
CEO, taking place on June 26&amp;ndash;28, was one of the sixteen Capcom Pro Tour events of the 2015 season, and the winner of its ''Ultra Street Fighter IV'' tournament automatically qualified for the [[2015 Capcom Cup]]. Capcom revealed the first playable demo of ''[[Street Fighter V]]'' at CEO 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/street-fighter-v-ceo-2015/|work=[[Digital Trends]]|title=Capcom will be letting the public play Street Fighter V next month at CEO 2015 in Orlando|last=Wouk|first=Chris|date=2015-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/street-fighter-v-playable-at-june-event/|work=[[PC Gamer]]|title=Street Fighter V playable at June event|last=Dransfield|first=Ian|date=2015-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Held at the Wyndham Orlando Resort, CEO 2015 brought in over 3,000 attendees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/orlando/news/2015/06/22/huge-gaming-tournament-to-bring-thousands-to.html|work=[[Orlando Business Journal]]|title=Huge gaming tournament to bring thousands to Orlando this weekend|last=Richardson|first=Matthew|date=2015-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the CEO 2015 ''Ultra Street Fighter IV'' tournament, well-known players such as [[Infiltration (video gamer)|Infiltration]], [[Tokido]], [[Yusuke Momochi]], and [[Daigo Umehara]] were all eliminated before reaching the finals. The tournament was won by [[Kazunoko]], who beat 801 Strider in the winner's bracket semi-final and defeated [[Fuudo]] in the Grand Final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redbull.com/us/en/esports/stories/1331732139753/america-at-ceo-2015-close-but-no-cigar|work=[[Red Bull GmbH|Red Bull]]|title=America at CEO 2015: Close but no Cigar|last=Martin|first=Michael|date=2015-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a response to the consistent success of ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]''-player [[Gonzalo "ZeRo" Barrios]] throughout the 2015 season, Jebailey gave out a prize to whoever could knock him out of the CEO 2015 tournament. As a response, ''[[Smashboards]]'' owner Chris "AlphaZealot" Brown added more money to the "bounty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/smash-bros-player-is-so-damn-good-theres-a-bounty-on-1705875804|work=[[Kotaku]]|title=Smash Bros.

===2016===
{{quotebox|width=25%|"I did what it took, and it costed a couple thousand dollars for the extra security, but if it helps people feel safer and have a better time it’s more than worth it to me."|&amp;ndash;Alex Jebailey&lt;ref name=RedBull2010 /&gt;}}
CEO 2016 took place two weeks after the [[2016 Orlando nightclub shooting|Orlando nightclub shooting]]. Jebailey quickly responded to people's worries regarding personal safety on [[social media]] that he would redouble the event's security. In an interview with ''Red Bull'', Jebailey stated that "We understand bad things happen in the world, but if I can spend a weekend with my community and get away from it... I can’t imagine anything better."&lt;ref name=RedBull2010 /&gt;

CEO 2016, again a Capcom Pro Tour Premier Event, featured ten major fighting game tournaments, including ''Ultra Street Fighter IV'' side-to-side with ''[[Street Fighter V]]''. Jebailey stated in an interview that there was a large amount of interest in the older game within the Florida fighting game community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redbull.com/us/en/esports/stories/1331768511768/ceo-2016-lineup-announced-jebailey-explains|work=[[Red Bull GmbH|Red Bull]]|title=CEO 2016 Lineup Announced: Jebailey Explains|last=Rubens|first=Alex|date=2016-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Orlando Business Journal'' reported that the event had over 4,000 attendees from 46 states and more than 25 countries. Besides major tournaments of new games such as ''[[Pokkén Tournament]]'', ''[[King of Fighters XIV]]'', and ''[[Guilty Gear Xrd]]'', the event included a "free-to-play" [[video game arcade]] and a guest appearance of professional wrestlers [[Xavier Woods]] and [[Kenny Omega]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/orlando/news/2016/06/01/3-new-things-coming-to-orlandos-biggest-video-game.html|work=[[Orlando Business Journal]]|title=3 new things coming to Orlando's biggest video game tournament|last=Richardson|first=Matthew|date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2016/0626/613054/xavier-woods-talks-loss-to-kenny-omega-at-ceo-2016/|work=[[Wrestlinginc.com]]|title=Xavier Woods Talks Loss To Kenny Omega At CEO 2016, Video Games Bringing Talent Together Backstage|last=Giri|first=Raj|date=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2017===
Jebailey announced in July 2016 that CEO 2017 would move away from its traditional late-June date in order for the event to be held in a new venue. The event may even move to a different city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailydot.com/esports/ceo-date-city-change-2017/|work=[[The Daily Dot]]|title=CEO may change dates and/or cities in 2017 as it searches for a new venue|last=Jurek|first=Steve|date=2016-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, CEO 2017 was announced to be held again in the [[Wyndham Resort]] in Orlando from June 16 to 18. The event featured tournaments for ''Street Fighter V'', ''Tekken 7'', ''Super Smash Bros Melee'', ''Super Smash Bros for Wii U'', ''[[Injustice 2]]'', ''Pokken Tournament'', ''Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3'', ''[[Killer Instinct (2013 video game)|Killer Instinct]]'', ''The King of Fighters XIV'', ''Guilty Gear Xrd'', and ''[[BlazBlue: Central Fiction]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pvplive.net/c/ceo-2017-schedule-revealed-melee-to-be-played-on-s|work=[[PVP Live]]|title=CEO 2017 Schedule Revealed, Melee to be Played on Saturday|last=Steiner|first=Dustin|date=2017-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esportsinsider.com/2017/01/community-effort-orlando-reveal-games/|work=[[Esports Insider]]|title=Community Effort Orlando reveal games to be played at 2017 event|last=Ring|first=Oliver|date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Microsoft Studios]] announced at CEO 2017 that the 2013 version of ''Killer Instinct'' would be released on the [[Steam (software)|Steam platform]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bleedingcool.com/2017/06/18/time-combo-breaker-killer-instinct-will-released-steam/|work=[[Bleeding Cool]]|title=Time For A Combo Breaker: ‘Killer Instinct’ Will Be Released On Steam|last=Sheehan|first=Gavin|date=2017-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==CEOtaku==
Jebailey set up a side event called CEOtaku in October 2015. A [[portmanteau]] of CEO and [[otaku]], the event focused specifically on Japanese 2D fighting games often referred to as "anime fighters". Such games have historically not gotten as much attention among the fighting game community. Jebailey got the idea of starting CEOtaku when he noticed that Florida features many [[anime convention]]s throughout any given year, and was inspired when he saw a side-event at [[Evo 2015]] dubbed "ANIMEvo".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redbull.com/us/en/esports/stories/1331742539800/ceotaku-the-anime-fgc-s-big-break|work=[[Red Bull GmbH|Red Bull]]|title=CEOtaku: The Anime FGC's Big Break|last=Womack|first=Barrett|date=2015-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; CEOtaku has since become an annual event as well.

==Dreamland==
In April 2017, Jebailey hosted CEO Dreamland, a ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]''-focused event featuring tournaments for each game in the series. The event attracted nearly 1,100 attendees, but failed to return its production cost. Jebailey blamed the lack of attendees in comparison to his annual CEO events on poor scheduling, as Dreamland took place on [[Easter]] weekend and coincided with the annual [[Star Wars Celebration]] at [[Walt Disney World]]. Following its near $20,000 [[USD]] loss, Dreamland is unlikely to return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/esports/story/_/id/19243116/future-uncertain-ceo-dreamland-tournaments|work=[[ESPN]]|title=Future uncertain for CEO Dreamland tournaments|last=Wolf|first=Jacob|date=2017-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24531">The '''criminal transmission of [[HIV]] in the [[United States]]''' varies among jurisdictions. More than thirty of the fifty states in the U.S. have prosecuted HIV-positive individuals for exposing another person to HIV. State laws criminalize different behaviors and assign different penalties. While pinpointing who infected who is scientifically impossible, a person diagnosed with HIV who is accused of infecting another while engaging in [[sexual intercourse]] is, in many jurisdictions, automatically committing a crime. A person donating HIV-infected organs, tissues, and blood can be prosecuted for transmitting the virus. Spitting or transmitting HIV-infected bodily fluids is a criminal offense in some states, particularly if the target is a prison guard. Some states treat the transmission of HIV, depending upon a variety of factors, as a [[felony]] and others as a [[misdemeanor]].

In October 2012, the HIV Medicine Association (HIVMA) of the [[Infectious Diseases Society of America]] (IDSA) called for the repeal of statutes that criminalize HIV-related behavior, writing: "Policies and laws that create HIV-specific crimes or that impose penalties for persons who are HIV-infected are unjust and harmful to public health around the world." It argued that such laws contribute to stigmatization and discrimination that inhibit diagnosis and result in "harsh sentencing for behaviors that pose little to no risk of HIV transmission." It advised that "All state and federal policies, laws and regulations ... be based on scientifically accurate information regarding HIV transmission routes and risk."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HIVMA Urges Repeal of HIV-specific Criminal Statutes|url=http://www.hivma.org/uploadedFiles/HIVMA/FINAL%20HIVMA%20Policy%20Statement%20on%20HIV%20Criminalization.pdf|publisher=HIV Medicine Association|accessdate=December 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 the [[Center for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) stated that those who are on HIV medication can no longer transmit the virus, but the possibility for a person to not use a prescription and continue to infect others remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-4953600/CDC-says-people-HIV-meds-transmit-virus.html|title=CDC declares that people on HIV medication cannot transmit the virus|publisher=|accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/risk/art/index.html|title=HIV Treatment as Prevention - HIV Risk and Prevention - HIV/AIDS - CDC|date=10 September 2018|website=www.cdc.gov|accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/those-undetectable-hiv-effectively-no-risk-transmitting-virus-cdc-says-n805916|title=Those with undetectable HIV at "effectively no risk" of transmitting virus, CDC says|publisher=|accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/hiv-medication-people-on-it-cannot-transmit-virus-cdc-treatment-aids-a7990286.html|title=HIV drugs now so effective people on them cannot transmit virus|publisher=|accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Federal law and policy==

===National HIV/AIDS strategy===
In July 2010, the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|White House]] announced a major change in its HIV/AIDS policy; the "National HIV/AIDS Strategy for the United States" stated that "the continued existence and enforcement of these types of laws [that criminalize HIV infection] run counter to scientific evidence about routes of HIV transmission and may undermine the public health goals of promoting HIV screening and treatment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/uploads/NHAS.pdf|title= National HIV/AIDS Strategy for the United States|page= 35|author=The White House Office of National AIDS Policy|date=July 2010|accessdate= December 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The administration's strategy cited a 2008 paper by Scott Burris and Edwin Cameron, a South African judge: "The use of criminal law to address HIV infection is inappropriate except in rare cases in which a person acts with conscious intent to transmit HIV and does so."&lt;ref&gt;[http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=182315 Scott Burris and Edwin Cameron, "The case against criminalization of HIV transmission", ''JAMA'' (2008)]. Retrieved December 6, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2010, the Center for HIV Law and Policy launched the Positive Justice Project, a campaign to combat HIV-related stigma and discrimination against people with HIV by the US criminal justice system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Heywood|first1=Todd A.|title=New group seeks end to HIV-specific criminal laws|url=http://iowaindependent.com/44113/new-group-seeks-end-to-hiv-specific-criminal-laws|accessdate=July 22, 2014|work=The Iowa Independent|date=September 28, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809165410/http://iowaindependent.com/44113/new-group-seeks-end-to-hiv-specific-criminal-laws|archivedate=August 9, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November the Project released a 293-page manual detailing HIV-specific laws and prosecutions in the 50 states, District of Columbia, U.S. Territories, Federal government, and the U.S. military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ending and Defending Against HIV Criminalization: State and Federal Laws and Prosecutions, Vol.1, First Edition |url=http://www.hivlawandpolicy.org/resources/view/564 |work=The Resource Bank |publisher=Center for HIV Law and Policy |date=Fall 2010 |author=René Bennett-Carlson, |accessdate=December 6, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827115736/http://www.hivlawandpolicy.org/resources/view/564 |archivedate=August 27, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 15, 2014, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) along with the [[Centers for Disease Control]] published a study of HIV-specific state laws called "Prevalence and Public Health Implications of State Laws that Criminalize Potential HIV Exposure in the United States".&lt;ref&gt;[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10461-014-0724-0 "Prevalence and Public Health Implications of State Laws that Criminalize Potential HIV Exposure in the United States", ''AIDS and Behavior'', June 2014, Volume 18, Issue 6, pp 997-1006]., accessed July 21, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 15, 2014, the DOJ released a paper called "Best Practices Guide to Reform HIV-Specific Criminal Laws to Align with Scientifically-Supported Factors", designed to guide states in updating their statutes to "reflect contemporary understanding of HIV transmission routes and associated benefits of treatment" and to establish policies that "do not place unnecessary burdens on individuals living with HIV/AIDS".&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Justice: [http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2014/July/14-crt-739.html "Justice Department Releases Best Practices Guide to Reform HIV-Specific Criminal Laws to Align with Scientifically-Supported Factors", July 15, 2014], accessed July 21, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proposed federal legislation===
REPEAL HIV Discrimination Act was the abbreviated name of the 'Repeal Existing Policies that Encourage and Allow Legal HIV Discrimination Act' (H.R. 3053), also called the REPEAL Act, proposed legislation that was introduced in the U.S. Congress on September 23, 2011, by Rep. [[Barbara Lee]] (D-CA).&lt;ref name=hr3053&gt;[http://beta.congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/house-bill/3053?q=hr3053 H.R.3053 - REPEAL Act], retrieved December 6, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; It called for review of all federal and state laws, policies, and regulations regarding the criminal prosecution of individuals for HIV-related offenses. It was the first piece of federal legislation to address HIV criminalization and provided incentives for states to reconsider laws and practices that target people with HIV for consensual sexual activity and conduct that poses no risk of HIV transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Federal Legislation Matters: The REPEAL HIV Discrimination Act, 26 September 2011|url=http://www.hivlawandpolicy.org/posts/view/113|publisher=Center for HIV Law and Policy|accessdate=December 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill had 41 cosponsors and was referred in September/October 2011 to three subcommittees, where it died.&lt;ref name=hr3053/&gt;

Barbara Lee re-introduced the REPEAL HIV Discrimination Act 2013 as H.R. 1843 in May 2013 with 42 cosponsors, and it again died in three subcommittees.&lt;ref name=hr1843&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Barbara|title=H.R.1843 - REPEAL HIV Discrimination Act of 2013|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/1843|work=Congress.gov|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=1 May 2014|date=7 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[Chris Coons]] introduced the legislation as S.1790 on December 10, 2013, and it did not make it out of the Judiciary Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Roberts|first=Dan |title=New bill seeks to repeal outdated state HIV discrimination laws|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/10/us-house-hiv-bill-discrimination|accessdate=December 12, 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=December 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immigration===
In 2012, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) used the conviction of Jose Luis Ramirez, an HIV-positive immigrant, of solicitation for oral sex as an argument for his deportation, calling it a "particularly serious crime". An immigration judge ordered his deportation, but the DHS withdrew its argument and the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) reversed the deportation order on May 31, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Immigration Court rules in favor of HIV-positive man facing deportation |url=http://sdgln.com/news/2013/06/05/immigration-court-rules-for-hiv-positive-man-facing-deportation|accessdate=June 5, 2013 |newspaper=San Diego Gay &amp; Lesbian News|date=June 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==State law and policy==

===Statutes===
As of 2010 "at least 32 states [had] HIV-specific laws that criminalize behavior by people living with HIV." The ACLU has listed states, their statutes, relevant behaviors (spitting, blood donation etc.), and classification of crime as felony or misdemeanor and punishment in a table.&lt;ref name=aclu&gt;{{cite web|title=Criminal statutes on HIV transmission|url=https://www.aclu.org/lgbt-rights_hiv-aids/state-criminal-statutes-hiv-transmission|work=Lesbian and Gay Rights Project|publisher=ACLU|pages=13|format=pdf 123.67 KB|date=June 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Minnesota has a statute that criminalizes the transmission of certain communicable diseases including HIV. Under that statute, Daniel James Rick, despite having informed his sexual partner of his HIV status, was charged with attempted first-degree assault with great bodily harm. His conviction in the trial court was overturned on appeal, and the Supreme Court of Minnesota on August 21, 2013, agreed that the prosecutor had misapplied the statute's provision meant to address the transmission of a communicable disease in non-sexual contexts, such as sperm or organ donations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Appeals Court Reverses Conviction In HIV Case|url=http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2012/09/24/appeals-court-reverses-conviction-in-hiv-case/ |accessdate=August 21, 2013|newspaper=CBS Minnesota|date=September 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Minn.

Iowa Code 709c was one of the most severe criminal transmission of HIV law in the country until 1 May 2014. For 16 years it allowed anyone with HIV exposing another person without disclosing his or her positive status, whether infection occurred or not, to be convicted of a class B felony, i.e. up to 25 years in prison and mandated registration as a sex offender.&lt;ref name=code709&gt;{{cite web|title=Iowa Code 709C, criminal transmission of HIV|url=https://coolice.legis.iowa.gov/Cool-ICE/default.asp?category=billinfo&amp;service=IowaCode&amp;ga=83&amp;input=709C7|publisher=Iowa Legislature|accessdate=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been called "draconian".&lt;ref name=ICPC /&gt; According to the Iowa Department of Public Health, Iowa ranks second in prosecutions behind Tennessee of persons with HIV, despite having a relatively small number of persons living with HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref name=IDPH&gt;{{cite web|title=Discussion of Revisions to Iowa Code 709C – Criminal Transmission of HIV|url=http://www.hivlawandpolicy.org/sites/www.hivlawandpolicy.org/files/709C%20Fact%20Sheet%20for%20IDPH.pdf|work=Fact sheet|author=Iowa Department of Public Health|publisher=The Center for HIV Law and Policy|accessdate=25 April 2014|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts to modernize had been underway since at least 2009, led by Community HIV/Hepatitis Advocates of Iowa Network (CHAIN) and 12 other Iowa medical professional, public health, civil rights and stakeholder organizations. Senate File 2297 redefines crimes for transmission of HIV, but also [[hepatitis]], [[tuberculosis]] and [[meningococcal disease]] and introduces a tiered-system of sentencing: Intentional transmission remains a class B felony, but if there is intent and no transmission it is a class D felony, the same as unintentional transmission. It also includes defense in court, if following a treatment regimen and physician’s advice and no longer requires sex offender registration.

===Prosecutions===
Prosecutions at the state level have included:
*[[Thomas Guerra]], who became the first person in the state of [[California]] to be convicted for intentionally infecting another individual with [[HIV]]. In court, prosecutors presented 11,000 text messages and 36 audio clips to support their case against Guerra. Since then, Guerra has been accused of intentionally exposing dozens of other men to the HIV.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost_travesty"&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael E.

{{refimprove|date=August 2008}}

'''David Sánchez Morales''' (August 26, 1925 – May 8, 1978) was a [[Central Intelligence Agency]] operative who worked in [[Cuba]] and [[Chile]].

==Biographical highlights==
Morales, of [[Mexican people|Mexican]] descent, spent his early life in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], and attended school at Arizona State College in Tempe (now [[Arizona State University]]) and the [[University of Southern California]] in [[Los Angeles]] before joining the [[Army]] in 1946.  He served in the [[82nd Airborne]], and was recruited into [[US Army intelligence]] during that time.&lt;ref&gt;Fonzi, Gaeton. ''The Last Investigation'', (New York: Thunder's Mouth Press, 1993), p. 382. {{ISBN|1-56025-052-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Morales maintained  an Army 'cover' even after joining the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] in 1951.

Shortly after joining the CIA, Morales became an operative for the CIA's [[National Clandestine Service|Directorate for Plans]].  It is alleged that he was involved in [[Executive Action]], a series of projects designed to kill foreign leaders deemed unfriendly to the [[United States]].  Morales reportedly was involved in [[Operation PBSUCCESS]], the CIA covert operation that overthrew the democratically elected President of [[Guatemala]], [[Jacobo Arbenz Guzmán]].&lt;ref&gt;Fonzi, Gaeton. ''The Last Investigation'', (New York: Thunder's Mouth Press, 1993), p. 382-3. {{ISBN|1-56025-052-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the 1960s and mid-1970s, Morales was involved at top levels in a variety of covert projects, including [[JMWAVE]], the [[ZRRIFLE]] plot to assassinate [[Fidel Castro]], the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] operation, the [[CIA activities in Laos|CIA's secret war in Laos]],&lt;ref&gt;Fonzi, Gaeton. ''The Last Investigation'', (New York: Thunder's Mouth Press, 1993), p. 382-3. {{ISBN|1-56025-052-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; the capture of [[Che Guevara]], and the overthrow of [[Salvador Allende]].

==Allegations of involvement with the Kennedy assassinations==
===John F. Kennedy===
{{main|John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories}}
After the death of [[E. Howard Hunt]] in 2007, Saint John Hunt and David Hunt revealed that their father had recorded several claims about himself and others being involved in a [[John F.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="960">The '''Döbbelinsches Theater''' or '''Döbbelin Theater''', was a theater in Berlin, active between 1764 to 1799. It was the first permanent German language theater in Berlin.  It was founded by [[Karl Schuch]] and named after its director, [[Karl Theophil Döbbelin]].  Prior to its foundation, Berlin had an opera house (founded in 1742) which only employed Italian artists, and travelling theater troupes often visited the city, but the Döbbeling theater was the first permanent theater for a permanent German language stage company.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3736">The '''Eifel Music Festival''' ({{lang-de|Eifeler Musikfest}}) is a church music festival that has been held every year since 1946 on the weekend after [[Pentecost]] at [[Steinfeld Abbey]]/[[Eifel]]. This makes it the oldest extant music festival in the Rhineland. Today, the county of [[Euskirchen (district)|Euskirchen]] is the responsible body in cooperation with the support association of Steinfeld Abbey.

== Concept ==
In keeping with the spirit of the monastic venue, the Eifel Music Festival is a Catholic church music festival. The festival's [[Solemn Mass|High Mass]] (''Festhochamt'') cultivates the tradition of the ''[[missa solemnis]]'', the [[church service]] accompanied ceremonially by [[Choir (music)|choir]] and [[orchestra]]. The highlight of the music festival is an [[Oratorium|oratorial concert]] on Sunday afternoon, at which great works of [[church music]] from [[Claudio Monteverdi|Monteverdi]] to [[Anton Bruckner|Bruckner]] are performed. Since the late 1950s, in addition to the church music concerts, there has been a concert of [[chamber music]] on Saturday evening with a "secular" programme is staged at various locations within the great monastery complex. From time to time, the festival programme is supplemented by an [[organ music|organ concert]] with well-known [[organist]]s playing Steinfeld's Balthasar König Organ on the Sunday afternoon.

== Artists ==
Until 1963, the artistic direction was in the hands of Aachen Cathedral's director of music and founder, Professor Theodor Bernhard Rehmann (1895-1963). Conductors have included [[Wolfgang Sawallisch]], Romanus Hubertus, Wolfgang Trommer and Hans Walter Kämpfel.

== History ==
The Eifel Music Festival was inaugurated in 1946 on the initiative of the Bishop of Aachen [[Johannes Joseph van der Velden]] and his Director of Music, Theodor Bernhard Rehmann. The idea was to bring "music culture" to the impoverished and war-damaged Eifel region. After a few years, the Eifel Music Festival developed into a popular folk festival in the region. As well as the festival's [[Solemn Mass|high mass]] and organ concert there was an open-air performance in the monastery courtyard; a symphony concert with the [[Aachen Symphony Orchestra]] and works mainly by [[Anton Bruckner|Bruckner]] and [[Beethoven]].

The [[Aachen Cathedral Choir]] also maintains the tradition of organizing the high mass at the Eifel Music Festival musically under [[Prelate]] Dr. Rudolf Pohl, the successor to Rehmann in the post of conductor of the Cathedral Orchestra. The afternoon oratorio concert was for many years in the hands of [[Bonn]]'s [[Bach Choir, Bonn|Bach Choir]], and its conductor Professor Gustav Classens. In the seventies and eighties of the 20th century, other renowned concert choirs from Cologne, Mainz and Düsseldorf also performed at the Eifel Music Festival.

'''Failure''' is the state or condition of not meeting a desirable or intended [[objective (goal)|objective]], and may be viewed as the opposite of [[wikt:success|success]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/failure|title=Failure - Definition of failure by Merriam-Webster|work=merriam-webster.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150716191304/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/failure|archivedate=2015-07-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Product failure ranges from failure to sell the product to [[fracture]] of the product, in the worst cases leading to personal injury, the province of [[forensic engineering]].

==In science==
&lt;center&gt;{{Quotebox|align=left|"If you want to succeed, double your failure rate."|[[Thomas J. Watson]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/263898-if-you-want-to-succeed-double-your-failure-rate| title= Quotes / Thomas J.

[[MIT]] [[neuroscience]] [[professor]] [[Earl K. Miller]] [[discovered]] that the [[reason]] why we keep [[Vice|repeating mistakes]] is because [[brain cells]] may only [[Learning|learn]] from [[experience]] when we [[Prediction|do something right]] and not when we fail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://news.mit.edu/2009/successes-0729 | title=Why we learn more from our successes than our failures | publisher=news.mit.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wired (magazine)|''Wired'']] magazine editor [[Kevin Kelly (editor)|Kevin Kelly]] explains that a great deal can be learned from things going  wrong unexpectedly, and that part of science's success comes from [[Scientific method#Luck and science|keeping blunders]] "small, manageable, constant, and trackable". He uses the example of engineers and programmers who push systems to their limits, breaking them to learn about them. Kelly also warns against creating a culture (e.g. school system) that punishes failure harshly, because this inhibits a creative process, and risks teaching people not to communicate important failures with others (e.g. [[Null results]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edge.org/q2011/q11_6.html |title=THE WORLD QUESTION CENTER 2011 — Page 6 |publisher=Edge.org |date= |accessdate=2014-06-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131205173145/http://www.edge.org/q2011/q11_6.html |archivedate=2013-12-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criteria==
The criteria for failure are heavily dependent on context of use, and may be [[Moral relativism|relative]] to a particular [[Observation|observer]] or [[belief system]]. A situation considered to be a failure by one might be considered a success by another, particularly in cases of direct [[competition]] or a [[Zero sum|zero-sum game]]. Similarly, the degree of success or failure in a situation may be differently viewed by distinct observers or participants, such that a situation that one considers to be a failure, another might consider to be a success, a qualified success or a neutral situation.

It may also be difficult or impossible to ascertain whether a situation meets criteria for failure or success due to ambiguous or ill-defined definition of those criteria.  Finding useful and effective criteria, or [[heuristic]]s, to judge the success or failure of a situation may itself be a significant task.

==Types==
Failure can be differentially perceived from the viewpoints of the evaluators. A person who is only interested in the final outcome of an activity would consider it to be an ''Outcome Failure'' if the core issue has not been resolved or a core need is not met. A failure can also be a ''process failure'' whereby although the activity is completed successfully, a person may still feel dissatisfied if the underlying process is perceived to be below expected standard or benchmark.

# Failure to [[Prediction|anticipate]]
# Failure to [[Perception|perceive]]
# Failure to [[Effectiveness|carry out a task]]

'''''Loser''''' is a [[derogatory term]] for a person who is (according to the standards of the observer) generally unsuccessful or undesirable.

==Commercial failures==
A '''commercial failure''' is a [[Product (business)|product]] or company that does not reach expectations of success.

Most of the items listed below had high expectations, significant financial investments, and/or widespread publicity, but fell far short of success. Due to the subjective nature of "success" and "meeting expectations," there can be disagreement about what constitutes a "major flop."

"Fail" is the name of a popular [[Internet meme]] where users superimpose a caption, often the word "'''fail'''" or "'''epic fail'''", onto photos or short videos depicting unsuccessful events or people falling short of expectations.&lt;ref name="redorbit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/technology/1306942/memes_help_keep_internet_interesting/index.html|title=Memes Help Keep Internet Interesting.|date=March 22, 2008|publisher=''[http://www.redorbit.com/ www.redorbit.com]''|accessdate=August 9, 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107052753/http://www.redorbit.com/news/technology/1306942/memes_help_keep_internet_interesting/index.html|archivedate=January 7, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2003, a contributor to [[Urban Dictionary]] wrote that the term, "fail," could be used as an interjection, "when one disapproves of something," citing the example: "You actually bought that?

Failboat or consignment of fail is a popular [[image macro|macro series]], featuring images of cargo vessels tipping over or shedding cargo, with captions such as 'the failboat has arrived', or 'all aboard the failboat'. The original vessel whose image was used was the [[MV Cougar Ace|MV ''Cougar Ace'']],{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} although the ''Ital Florida'', the [[MV Napoli|MV ''Napoli'']] and even the [[SS Normandy|SS ''Normandy'']], sunk at her berth in New York Harbor, have appeared.

The term "[[miserable failure]]" has also been popularized as a result of a widely known "[[Google bomb]]ing," which caused [[Google search]]es for the term to turn up the White House biography of [[George W. Bush]].&lt;ref name="snopes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/politics/bush/google.asp|title=Someone Set Us Up The Google Bomb.|author1=Mikkelson, Barbara |author2=Mikkelson, David P. |date=August 13, 2007|publisher=''[[Snopes.com]]''|accessdate=August 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Bronze head (Glyptothek Munich 457) with and without patina Bunte Götter exhibition.jpg|thumb|Juxtaposition of the colored reconstruction and the weathered original of a bronze head in the Munich exhibition]]
'''Gods in Color''' (original title in [[German language|German]]: ''Bunte Götter – Die Farbigkeit antiker Skulptur'', ''painted gods - the polychromy of ancient sculpture'') is a travelling exhibition of varying format and extent that has been shown in multiple cities worldwide. Its subject is [[Ancient Greek art#Polychromy: painting on statuary and architecture|ancient polychromy]], i.e. the original, brightly painted, appearance of ancient [[sculpture]] and architecture.

== Concept ==
[[File:Artemis found in Pompeii.jpg|thumb|The Greek goddess [[Artemis]]; color reconstruction of a first century AD statue found in [[Pompeii]], an imitation of Greek statues of the sixth century BC. Reconstructed using analysis of trace pigments.]]
The exhibition is based on the result of research on ancient polychromy, conducted especially by the Classical archaeologist [[Vinzenz Brinkmann]] since the early 1980s, based on earlier works by Volkmar von Graeve. Working together with Raimund Wünsche, the director of the [[Glyptothek]] at [[Munich]], Brinkmann developed the concept for the exhibition, culminating in the original Munich show in 2003. It displayed copies of ancient sculpture in their reconstructed painted appearance that had been produced during his studies, as well as new reconstructions created especially for the exhibition, in conjunction with the originals or comparable ancient sculptures. Soon, it began to travel to other cities in [[Germany]] and beyond.

Since 2007, the exhibition and underlying research receive support from [[:de:Stiftung Archäologie|a foundation]] created by the government of [[Bavaria]], as well as private donations. After the original German catalogue produced for the 2003 Munich exhibition, new editions were issued for later showings, most recently for the 2010 one in Berlin. An English catalogue was published for the 2008 showing in the [[Arthur M. Sackler Museum]] at [[Harvard University]]. In 2007  the Colored Gods formed part of the exhibition ''Color of Life – Polychromy in Sculpture from Antiquity to the Present'' at the [[Getty Villa]] in [[Los Angeles]], with contributions in the respective catalogue.

'''Guy Fawkes''' ({{IPAc-en|f|ɔː|k|s}}; 13 April 1570&amp;nbsp;– 31 January 1606),{{efn|Dates in this article before [[Adoption of the Gregorian calendar#Great Britain and its colonies|14 September 1752]] are given in the Julian calendar. The beginning of the year is treated as 1 January even though it began in England on 25 March.}} (also known as '''Guido Fawkes''' while fighting for the Spanish) was a member of a group of provincial [[Catholic Church in England and Wales|English Catholics]] who planned the failed [[Gunpowder Plot]] of 1605. He was born and educated in [[York]], England; his father died when Fawkes was eight years old, after which his mother married a [[Recusancy|recusant]] Catholic.

Fawkes converted to Catholicism and left for mainland Europe, where he fought for Catholic Spain in the [[Eighty Years' War]] against Protestant Dutch [[Protestant Reformation|reformers]] in the [[Low Countries]]. He travelled to Spain to seek support for a Catholic rebellion in England without success. He later met [[Robert and Thomas Wintour|Thomas Wintour]], with whom he returned to England, and Wintour introduced him to [[Robert Catesby]], who planned to assassinate {{nowrap|[[James VI and I|King James I]]}} and restore a Catholic monarch to the throne. The plotters leased an [[undercroft]] beneath the House of Lords, and Fawkes was placed in charge of the gunpowder which they stockpiled there. The authorities were prompted by an anonymous letter to search [[Westminster Palace]] during the early hours of 5 November, and they found Fawkes guarding the explosives. He was questioned and tortured over the next few days, and he finally confessed.

Immediately before his execution on 31 January, Fawkes fell from the scaffold where he was to be hanged and broke his neck, thus avoiding the agony of being [[hanged, drawn and quartered]]. He became synonymous with the Gunpowder Plot, the failure of which has been commemorated in Britain as [[Guy Fawkes Night]] since 5 November 1605, when his effigy is traditionally burned on a bonfire, commonly accompanied by fireworks.

Guy Fawkes was born in 1570 in Stonegate, [[York]].  He was the second of four children born to Edward Fawkes, a [[proctor]] and an advocate of the [[consistory court]] at York,{{efn|According to one source, he may have been Registrar of the Exchequer Court of the Archbishop.{{sfn|Haynes|2005|pp=28–29|ps=}}}} and his wife, Edith.{{efn|Fawkes's mother's maiden name is alternatively given as Edith Blake,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.gunpowder-plot.org/fawkes.asp |title=Guy Fawkes |publisher=The Gunpowder Plot Society |accessdate=19 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100318043708/http://www.gunpowder-plot.org/fawkes.asp |archivedate=18 March 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; or Edith Jackson.&lt;ref name="ODNB Fawkes"/&gt;}}  Guy's parents were regular communicants of the [[Church of England]], as were his paternal grandparents; his grandmother, born Ellen Harrington, was the daughter of a prominent merchant, who served as [[Lord Mayor of York]] in 1536.&lt;ref&gt;"Fawkes, Guy" in ''[[Dictionary of National Biography|The Dictionary of National Biography]],'' [[Leslie Stephen]], ed., Oxford University Press, London (1921–1922).&lt;/ref&gt; Guy's mother's family were [[Recusancy|recusant Catholics]], and his cousin, Richard Cowling, became a [[Jesuit]] priest.&lt;ref name="Fraser 2005 84"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Guy'' was an uncommon name in England, but may have been popular in York on account of a local notable, Sir [[Guy Fairfax]] of Steeton.&lt;ref name="Sharpep48"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sharpe|2005|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The date of Fawkes's birth is unknown, but he was [[baptism|baptised]] in the church of [[St Michael le Belfrey]] on 16 April. As the customary gap between birth and baptism was three days, he was probably born about 13 April.&lt;ref name="Fraser 2005 84"/&gt;  In 1568, Edith had given birth to a daughter named Anne, but the child died aged about seven weeks, in November that year.  She bore two more children after Guy: Anne (b. 1572), and Elizabeth (b. 1575).  Both were married, in 1599 and 1594 respectively.&lt;ref name="Sharpep48"/&gt;{{sfn|Fraser|2005|p=86&amp;nbsp;(note)|ps=}}

In 1579, when Guy was eight years old, his father died. His mother remarried several years later, to the Catholic Dionis Baynbrigge (or Denis Bainbridge) of [[Scotton, Harrogate]].  Fawkes may have become a Catholic through the Baynbrigge family's recusant tendencies, and also the Catholic branches of the Pulleyn and Percy families of Scotton,{{sfn|Sharpe|2005|p=49|ps=}} but also from his time at [[St Peter's School, York|St. Peter's School]] in York.  A governor of the school had spent about 20&amp;nbsp;years in prison for recusancy, and its headmaster, John Pulleyn, came from a family of noted Yorkshire recusants, the Pulleyns of [[Blubberhouses]].  In her 1915 work ''The Pulleynes of Yorkshire'', author Catharine Pullein suggested that Fawkes's Catholic education came from his Harrington relatives, who were known for harbouring priests, one of whom later accompanied Fawkes to [[Flanders]] in 1592–1593.&lt;ref name="Herber"/&gt;  Fawkes's fellow students included [[John and Christopher Wright|John Wright]] and his brother [[Christopher Wright (plotter)|Christopher]] (both later involved with Fawkes in the [[Gunpowder Plot]]) and [[Oswald Tesimond]], [[Edward Oldcorne]] and Robert Middleton, who became priests (the latter executed in 1601).{{sfn|Fraser|2005|pp=84–85|ps=}}

After leaving school Fawkes entered the service of [[Anthony Browne, 1st Viscount Montagu]].&lt;!-- Browne was one of the leading statesmen during the time of Catholic [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], and was also allegedly implicated in the [[Ridolfi plot]] --&gt;  The Viscount took a dislike to Fawkes and after a short time dismissed him; he was subsequently employed by [[Anthony-Maria Browne, 2nd Viscount Montagu]], who succeeded his grandfather at the age of&amp;nbsp;18.{{sfn|Fraser|2005|pp=85–86|ps=}} At least one source claims that Fawkes married and had a son, but no known contemporary accounts confirm this.&lt;ref name="Fraserp86"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|According to the [[International Genealogical Index]], compiled by the [[Family History Library|LDS Church]], Fawkes married Maria Pulleyn (b. 1569) in Scotton in 1590, and had a son, Thomas, on 6 February 1591.&lt;ref name="Herber"&gt;{{citation |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617064347/http://www.gunpowder-plot.org/news/1998_04/gfmp.htm |archivedate=17 June 2011 |url=http://www.gunpowder-plot.org/news/1998_04/gfmp.htm |publisher=The Gunpowder Plot Society |contribution=The Marriage of Guy Fawkes and Maria Pulleyn |title=The Gunpowder Plot Society Newsletter |issue= 1 |date=April 1998 |last=Herber |first=David |accessdate=16 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; These entries, however, appear to derive from a secondary source and not from actual parish entries.&lt;ref name="Fraserp86"/&gt;}}&lt;!-- After renting them out for a while as a way to earn money, he sold his stakes in them to Anne Skipsey.{{fact|date=November 2010}} --&gt;

===Military career===
In October 1591 Fawkes sold the estate in [[Clifton, York|Clifton]] in York that he had inherited from his father.{{efn|Although the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography claims 1592, multiple alternative sources give 1591 as the date.  Peter Beal, ''A Dictionary of English Manuscript Terminology, 1450 to 2000'', includes a signed indenture of the sale of the estate dated 14 October 1591. (pp. 198–199)}}  He travelled to the continent to fight in the [[Eighty Years War]] for Catholic Spain against the new [[Dutch Republic]] and, from 1595 until the [[Peace of Vervins]] in 1598, France.  Although England was not by then engaged in land operations against Spain, the two countries were [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585)|still at war]], and the [[Spanish Armada]] of 1588 was only five years in the past.  He joined [[William Stanley (Elizabethan)|Sir William Stanley]], an English Catholic and veteran commander in his mid-fifties who had raised an army in Ireland to fight in [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Leicester's expedition to the Netherlands]].  Stanley had been held in high regard by [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], but following his surrender of [[Deventer]] to the Spanish in 1587 he, and most of his troops, had switched sides to serve Spain.  Fawkes became an [[alférez (rank)|alférez]] or junior officer, fought well at the [[Siege of Calais (1596)|siege of Calais in 1596]], and by 1603 had been recommended for a [[captaincy]].&lt;ref name="ODNB Fawkes"&gt;{{citation |last=Nicholls |first=Mark |contribution=Fawkes, Guy (bap. 1570, d. 1606) |title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2004 |edition=online |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/9230 |accessdate=6 May 2010 |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/9230}} {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That year, he travelled to Spain to seek support for a Catholic rebellion in England.  He used the occasion to adopt the Italian version of his name, Guido, and in his memorandum described [[James I of England|James I]] (who became king of England that year) as "a heretic", who intended "to have all of the Papist sect driven out of England."  He denounced Scotland, and the King's [[favourite]]s among the  Scottish nobles, writing "it will not be possible to reconcile these two nations, as they are, for very long".{{sfn|Fraser|2005|p=89|ps=}}  Although he was received politely, the court of [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]] was unwilling to offer him any support.{{sfn|Fraser|2005|pp=87–90|ps=}}

==Gunpowder Plot==
{{Main|Gunpowder Plot}}

All have beards, and appear to be engaged in discussion|A contemporary engraving of eight of the thirteen conspirators, by [[Crispijn van de Passe]].  Fawkes is third from the right.]]

In 1604 Fawkes became involved with a small group of English Catholics, led by [[Robert Catesby]], who planned to assassinate the [[Protestant]] [[James VI and I|King James]] and replace him with his daughter, third in the line of succession, [[Elizabeth of Bohemia|Princess Elizabeth]].{{sfn|Northcote Parkinson|1976|p=46|ps=}}{{sfn|Fraser|2005|pp=140–142|ps=}}  Fawkes was described by the Jesuit priest and former school friend [[Oswald Tesimond]] as "pleasant of approach and cheerful of manner, opposed to quarrels and strife&amp;nbsp;... loyal to his friends".  Tesimond also claimed Fawkes was "a man highly skilled in matters of war", and that it was this mixture of piety and professionalism that endeared him to his fellow conspirators.&lt;ref name="ODNB Fawkes"/&gt;  The author [[Antonia Fraser]] describes Fawkes as "a tall, powerfully built man, with thick reddish-brown hair, a flowing moustache in the tradition of the time, and a bushy reddish-brown beard", and that he was "a man of action&amp;nbsp;... capable of intelligent argument as well as physical endurance, somewhat to the surprise of his enemies."&lt;ref name="Fraser 2005 84"/&gt;

The first meeting of the five central conspirators took place on Sunday 20 May 1604, at an inn called the Duck and Drake, in the fashionable [[Strand, London|Strand]] district of London.{{efn|Also present were fellow conspirators John Wright, [[Thomas Percy (Gunpowder Plot)|Thomas Percy]], and [[Robert and Thomas Wintour|Thomas Wintour]] (with whom he was already acquainted).&lt;ref name="Fraserpp117119"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=117–119}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}  Catesby had already proposed at an earlier meeting with [[Robert and Thomas Wintour|Thomas Wintour]] and John Wright to kill the King and his government by blowing up "the Parliament House with gunpowder".  Wintour, who at first objected to the plan, was convinced by Catesby to travel to the continent to seek help.  Wintour met with the Constable of Castile, the exiled Welsh spy Hugh Owen,{{sfn|Fraser|2005|p=87|ps=}} and Sir William Stanley, who said that Catesby would receive no support from Spain.  Owen did, however, introduce Wintour to Fawkes, who had by then been away from England for many years, and thus was largely unknown in the country.  Wintour and Fawkes were contemporaries; each was militant, and had first-hand experience of the unwillingness of the Spaniards to help.  Wintour told Fawkes of their plan to "doe some whatt in Ingland if the pece with Spaine healped us nott",&lt;ref name="ODNB Fawkes"/&gt; and thus in April 1604 the two men returned to England.&lt;ref name="Fraserpp117119"/&gt;  Wintour's news did not surprise Catesby; despite positive noises from the Spanish authorities, he feared that "the deeds would nott answere".{{efn|[[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]] made peace with England in August 1604.&lt;ref name="ODNB Catesby"&gt;{{citation |last=Nicholls |first=Mark |contribution=Catesby, Robert (b. in or after 1572, d. 1605) |title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2004 |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/4883/ |accessdate=12 May 2010 |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/4883}} {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

One of the conspirators, [[Thomas Percy (plotter)|Thomas Percy]], was promoted in June 1604, gaining access to a house in London that belonged to John Whynniard, Keeper of the King's Wardrobe.  Fawkes was installed as a caretaker and began using the pseudonym John Johnson, servant to Percy.{{sfn|Fraser|2005|pp=122–123|ps=}}  The contemporaneous account of the prosecution (taken from Thomas Wintour's confession)&lt;ref name="ODNB Thomas Wintour"&gt;{{citation |last=Nicholls |first=Mark |contribution=Winter, Thomas (c.&amp;nbsp;1571–1606) |title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2004 |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/29767 |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/29767 |accessdate=16 November 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305123416/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/29767 |archive-date=5 March 2016 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }} {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt; claimed that the conspirators attempted to dig a tunnel from beneath Whynniard's house to Parliament, although this story may have been a government fabrication; no evidence for the existence of a tunnel was presented by the prosecution, and no trace of one has ever been found; Fawkes himself did not admit the existence of such a scheme until his fifth interrogation, but even then he could not locate the tunnel.{{sfn|Fraser|2005|pp=133–134|ps=}}  If the story is true, however, by December 1604 the conspirators were busy tunnelling from their rented house to the House of Lords.  They ceased their efforts when, during tunnelling, they heard a noise from above.  Fawkes was sent out to investigate, and returned with the news that the tenant's widow was clearing out a nearby [[undercroft]], directly beneath the House of Lords.&lt;ref name="ODNB Fawkes"/&gt;{{sfn|Haynes|2005|pp=55–59|ps=}}

The plotters purchased the lease to the room, which also belonged to John Whynniard.  Unused and filthy, it was considered an ideal hiding place for the gunpowder the plotters planned to store.{{sfn|Fraser|2005|pp=144–145|ps=}}  According to Fawkes, 20&amp;nbsp;barrels of gunpowder were brought in at first, followed by 16&amp;nbsp;more on 20 July.&lt;ref name="Fraserpp146147"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=146–147}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 28 July however, the ever-present threat of the plague delayed the opening of Parliament until Tuesday, 5 November.{{sfn|Fraser|2005|pp=159–162|ps=}}

===Overseas===
In an attempt to gain foreign support, in May 1605 Fawkes travelled overseas and informed Hugh Owen of the plotters' plan.{{sfn|Bengsten|2005|p=50|ps=}}  At some point during this trip his name made its way into the files of [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury]], who employed a network of spies across Europe.  One of these spies, Captain William Turner, may have been responsible.  Although the information he provided to Salisbury usually amounted to no more than a vague pattern of invasion reports, and included nothing which regarded the Gunpowder Plot, on 21 April he told how Fawkes was to be brought by Tesimond to England.  Fawkes was a well-known Flemish mercenary, and would be introduced to "Mr Catesby" and "honourable friends of the nobility and others who would have arms and horses in readiness".{{sfn|Fraser|2005|p=150|ps=}}  Turner's report did not, however, mention Fawkes's pseudonym in England, John Johnson, and did not reach Cecil until late in November, well after the plot had been discovered.&lt;ref name="ODNB Fawkes"/&gt;{{sfn|Fraser|2005|pp=148–150|ps=}}

It is uncertain when Fawkes returned to England, but he was back in London by late August 1605, when he and Wintour discovered that the gunpowder stored in the undercroft had decayed.  More gunpowder was brought into the room, along with firewood to conceal it.{{sfn|Fraser|2005|p=170|ps=}}  Fawkes's final role in the plot was settled during a series of meetings in October.  He was to light the fuse and then escape across the Thames.  Simultaneously, a revolt in the Midlands would help to ensure the capture of Princess Elizabeth.  Acts of [[regicide]] were frowned upon, and Fawkes would therefore head to [[Continental Europe|the continent]], where he would explain to the Catholic powers his holy duty to kill the King and his retinue.&lt;ref name="Fraser 1999 178–179"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=178–179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discovery===
[[File:Guy fawkes henry perronet briggs.jpg|thumb|alt=In a stone-walled room, several armed men physically restrain another man, who is drawing his sword.|''Discovery of the Gunpowder Plot'' (c.&amp;nbsp;1823), [[Henry Perronet Briggs]]]]
A few of the conspirators were concerned about fellow Catholics who would be present at Parliament during the opening.{{sfn|Northcote Parkinson|1976|pp=62–63|ps=}}  On the evening of 26 October, [[William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle|Lord Monteagle]] received an anonymous letter warning him to stay away, and to "retyre youre self into yowre contee whence yow maye expect the event in safti for&amp;nbsp;... they shall receyve a terrible blowe this parleament".{{sfn|Northcote Parkinson|1976|pp=68–69|ps=}} Despite quickly becoming aware of the letter{{spaced ndash}}informed by one of Monteagle's servants{{spaced ndash}}the conspirators resolved to continue with their plans, as it appeared that it "was clearly thought to be a hoax".{{sfn|Northcote Parkinson|1976|p=72|ps=}}   Fawkes checked the undercroft on 30 October, and reported that nothing had been disturbed.{{sfn|Fraser|2005|p=189|ps=}}  Monteagle's suspicions had been aroused, however, and the letter was shown to King James. The King ordered [[Thomas Knyvet, 1st Baron Knyvet|Sir Thomas Knyvet]] to conduct a search of the cellars underneath Parliament, which he did in the early hours of 5 November.  Fawkes had taken up his station late on the previous night, armed with a slow match and a watch given to him by Percy "becaus he should knowe howe the time went away".&lt;ref name="ODNB Fawkes"/&gt;  He was found leaving the cellar, shortly after midnight, and arrested.  Inside, the barrels of gunpowder were discovered hidden under piles of firewood and coal.{{sfn|Northcote Parkinson|1976|p=73|ps=}}

===Torture===
Fawkes gave his name as John Johnson and was first interrogated by members of the King's [[Privy chamber]], where he remained defiant.&lt;ref name="NorthcoteParkinsonpp9192"&gt;{{Harvnb|Northcote Parkinson|1976|pp=91–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When asked by one of the lords what he was doing in possession of so much gunpowder, Fawkes answered that his intention was "to blow you Scotch beggars back to your native mountains." {{sfn|Cobbett|1857|p=229}} He identified himself as a 36-year-old Catholic from Netherdale in Yorkshire, and gave his father's name as Thomas and his mother's as Edith Jackson.  Wounds on his body noted by his questioners he explained as the effects of [[pleurisy]].  Fawkes admitted his intention to blow up the House of Lords, and expressed regret at his failure to do so.  His steadfast manner earned him the admiration of King James, who described Fawkes as possessing "a Roman resolution".{{sfn|Fraser|2005|pp=208–209|ps=}}

James's admiration did not, however, prevent him from ordering on 6 November that "John Johnson" be tortured, to reveal the names of his co-conspirators.{{sfn|Fraser|2005|p=211|ps=}}  He directed that the torture be light at first, referring to the use of [[handcuffs|manacles]], but more severe if necessary, authorising the use of [[Rack (torture)|the rack]]: "the gentler Tortures are to be first used unto him ''et sic per gradus ad ima tenditur'' [and so by degrees proceeding to the worst]".&lt;ref name="NorthcoteParkinsonpp9192"/&gt;{{sfn|Fraser|2005|p=215|ps=}}  Fawkes was transferred to the [[Tower of London]].  The King composed a list of questions to be put to "Johnson", such as "''as to what he is'', For I can never yet hear of any man that knows him", "When and where he learned to speak French?", and "If he was a Papist, who brought him up in it?"{{sfn|Fraser|2005|p=212|ps=}} The room in which Fawkes was interrogated subsequently became known as the Guy Fawkes Room.{{sfn|Younghusband|2008|p=46|ps=}}

[[File:Guy fawkes torture signatures.jpg|thumb|alt=Two signatures|Fawkes's signature of "Guido", made soon after his torture, is a barely evident scrawl compared to a later instance.]]
[[William Wade (English politician)|Sir William Waad]], Lieutenant of the Tower, supervised the torture and obtained Fawkes's confession.&lt;ref name="NorthcoteParkinsonpp9192"/&gt;  He searched his prisoner, and found a letter addressed to Guy Fawkes.  To Waad's surprise, "Johnson" remained silent, revealing nothing about the plot or its authors.{{sfn|Bengsten|2005|p=58|ps=}}  On the night of 6 November he spoke with Waad, who reported to Salisbury "He [Johnson] told us that since he undertook this action he did every day pray to God he might perform that which might be for the advancement of the Catholic Faith and saving his own soul".  According to Waad, Fawkes managed to rest through the night, despite his being warned that he would be interrogated until "I had gotton the inwards secret of his thoughts and all his complices".{{sfn|Bengsten|2005|p=59|ps=}} His composure was broken at some point during the following day.{{sfn|Fraser|2005|pp=216–217|ps=}}

The observer Sir Edward Hoby remarked "Since Johnson's being in the Tower, he beginneth to speak English".  Fawkes revealed his true identity on 7 November, and told his interrogators that there were five people involved in the plot to kill the King.  He began to reveal their names on 8 November, and told how they intended to place Princess Elizabeth on the throne.  His third confession, on 9 November, implicated [[Francis Tresham]]. Following the [[Ridolfi plot]] of 1571 prisoners were made to dictate their confessions, before copying and signing them, if they still could.{{sfn|Bengsten|2005|p=60|ps=}} Although it is uncertain if he was tortured on the rack, Fawkes's scrawled signature bears testament to the suffering he endured at the hands of his interrogators.{{sfn|Fraser|2005|pp=215–216, 228–229|ps=}}

===Trial and execution===
The trial of eight of the plotters began on Monday 27 January 1606.  Fawkes shared the barge from the Tower to [[Westminster Hall]] with seven of his co-conspirators.{{efn|The eighth, Thomas Bates, was considered inferior by virtue of his status, and was held instead at Gatehouse Prison.{{sfn|Fraser|2005|p=263|ps=}}}}  They were kept in the [[Star Chamber]] before being taken to Westminster Hall, where they were displayed on a purpose-built scaffold.  The King and his close family, watching in secret, were among the spectators as the Lords Commissioners read out the list of charges.  Fawkes was identified as Guido Fawkes, "otherwise called Guido Johnson".  He pleaded not guilty, despite his apparent acceptance of guilt from the moment he was captured.{{sfn|Fraser|2005|pp=263–266|ps=none}}

The outcome was never in doubt.  The jury found all the defendants guilty, and the [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]] Sir [[John Popham (judge)|John Popham]] pronounced them guilty of [[high treason]].{{sfn|Fraser|2005|p=273|ps=none}}  The [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] [[Edward Coke|Sir Edward Coke]] told the court that each of the condemned would be [[Hanged, drawn, and quartered|drawn backwards]] to his death, by a horse, his head near the ground.  They were to be "put to death halfway between heaven and earth as unworthy of both".  Their genitals would be cut off and burnt before their eyes, and their bowels and hearts removed.  They would then be decapitated, and the dismembered parts of their bodies displayed so that they might become "prey for the fowls of the air".&lt;ref name="Fraserpp266269"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|pp=266–269}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fawkes's and Tresham's testimony regarding the Spanish treason was read aloud, as well as confessions related specifically to the Gunpowder Plot.  The last piece of evidence offered was a conversation between Fawkes and Wintour, who had been kept in adjacent cells.  The two men apparently thought they had been speaking in private, but their conversation was intercepted by a government spy.  When the prisoners were allowed to speak, Fawkes explained his not guilty plea as ignorance of certain aspects of the indictment.{{sfn|Fraser|2005|pp=269–271|ps=none}}

On 31 January 1606, Fawkes and three others&amp;nbsp;– Thomas Wintour, [[Ambrose Rookwood]], and Robert Keyes&amp;nbsp;– were dragged (''i.e.'', "drawn") from the Tower on wattled [[hurdle]]s to the Old Palace Yard at Westminster, opposite the building they had attempted to destroy.{{sfn|Haynes|2005|pp=115–116|ps=}}  His fellow plotters were then hanged and quartered.  Fawkes was the last to stand on the scaffold.  He asked for forgiveness of the King and state, while keeping up his "crosses and idle ceremonies" (Catholic practices).  Weakened by torture and aided by the hangman, Fawkes began to climb the ladder to the noose, but either through jumping to his death or climbing too high so the rope was incorrectly set, he managed to avoid the agony of the latter part of his execution by breaking his neck.&lt;ref name="NorthcoteParkinsonpp9192"/&gt;{{sfn|Fraser|2005|p=283|ps=}}{{sfn|Sharpe|2005|pp=76–77|ps=}} His lifeless body was nevertheless quartered{{sfn|Allen|1973|p=37|ps=}} and, as was the custom,{{sfn|Thompson|2008|p=102|ps=}} his body parts were then distributed to "the four corners of the kingdom", to be displayed as a warning to other would-be traitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Guy Fawkes |publisher=York Museums Trust |url=http://www.historyofyork.org.uk//themes/tudor-stuart/guy-fawkes |accessdate=16 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414012842/http://www.historyofyork.org.uk/themes/tudor-stuart/guy-fawkes |archive-date=14 April 2010 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain, 5 November has variously been called [[Guy Fawkes Night]], Guy Fawkes Day, Plot Night,{{sfn|Fox| Woolf|2002|p=269|ps=}} and Bonfire Night (which can be traced directly back to the original celebration of 5 November 1605).{{sfn|Fraser|2005|pp=351–352|ps=}} Bonfires were accompanied by fireworks from the 1650s onwards, and it became the custom after 1673 to burn an effigy (usually of the pope) when heir presumptive [[James II of England|James, Duke of York]] converted to Catholicism.&lt;ref name="ODNB Fawkes"/&gt;  Effigies of other notable figures have found their way onto the bonfires, such as [[Paul Kruger]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]],{{sfn|Fraser|2005|p=356|ps=}} although most modern effigies are of Fawkes.&lt;ref name="factsheet"/&gt; The "guy" is normally created by children from old clothes, newspapers, and a mask.&lt;ref name="factsheet"/&gt;  During the 19th century, "guy" came to mean an oddly dressed person, but in American English it has lost any pejorative connotation and is used to refer to any male person.&lt;ref name="factsheet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mw"&gt;{{citation |title=The Merriam-Webster new book of word histories |last=Merriam-Webster |publisher=Merriam-Webster |year=1991 |isbn=0-87779-603-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IrcZEZ1bOJsC&amp;pg=PA208|page=208}}, entry "guy"&lt;/ref&gt;

James Sharpe, professor of history at the University of York, has described how Guy Fawkes came to be toasted as "the last man to enter Parliament with honest intentions".{{sfn|Sharpe|2005|p=6|ps=}} [[William Harrison Ainsworth]]'s 1841 historical romance ''[[Guy Fawkes (novel)|Guy Fawkes; or, The Gunpowder Treason]]'' portrays Fawkes in a generally sympathetic light,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Harrison Ainsworth |first=William |authorlink=William Harrison Ainsworth |title=Guy Fawkes; or, The Gunpowder Treason |publisher=Nottingham Society |year=1841 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YvcOOnJWc3gC&amp;dq=william+harrison+ainsworth+fawkes&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his novel transformed Fawkes in the public perception into an "acceptable fictional character". Fawkes subsequently appeared as "essentially an action hero" in children's books and [[penny dreadful]]s such as ''The Boyhood Days of Guy Fawkes; or, The Conspirators of Old London'', published around 1905.&lt;ref name=Sharpe128&gt;{{Harvnb|Sharpe|2005|p=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian [[Lewis Call]], Fawkes is now "a major icon in modern political culture" whose face has become "a potentially powerful instrument for the articulation of postmodern anarchism"{{efn|See [[Post-anarchism]]}} in the late 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Call |first=Lewis |title=A is for Anarchy, V is for Vendetta: Images of Guy Fawkes and the Creation of Postmodern Anarchism |journal=Anarchist Studies |date=July 2008 |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-1626560801.html |accessdate=10 November 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602025223/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-1626560801.html |archive-date=2 June 2013 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}{{subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Habu liqueur, awamori flavoured with snakes and herbs.jpg|thumb]]
{{nihongo|'''''Habushu'''''|ハブ酒}} is an ''[[awamori]]''-based [[liqueur]] made in [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawa]], [[Japan]]. Other common names include '''Habu Sake''' or '''Okinawan Snake Wine'''. Habushu is named after the habu snake, ''[[Trimeresurus flavoviridis]]'', which belongs to the [[pit viper]] family and is closely related to the [[rattlesnake]] and [[Agkistrodon contortrix|copperhead]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Society for Science and the Public |title=Snakes from Okinawa |journal=The Science News-Letter |volume=48 |pages=211–212 |year=1945 |doi=10.2307/3922011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Habu snakes are venomous and native to areas in Southeast Asia and other large island groups including the Philippines, Ryukyus, and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fort.usgs.gov/resources/education/bts/bioeco/other_snakes.asp |title=Other Snakes of the South Pacific Most Likely to be Encountered |accessdate=2011-12-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111116061752/http://www.fort.usgs.gov/resources/education/bts/bioeco/other_snakes.asp |archivedate=2011-11-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A bite from a habu snake can cause nausea, vomiting, hypotension, and possibly death. There have been cases where victims report the loss of motor function in hands and legs following treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== Production ==
A main distributor of habushu uses around 5,000 habu per year. The distillery uses crushed rice and Koji mold to produce the awamori that goes into the habushu. The ''awamori'' is first mixed with herbs and honey giving the clear liquid a yellow hue. A [[pit viper]] is then inserted into the liquid and stored until consumed. It is a typical practice to age the awamori for a long period of time. The alcohol helps the venom to dissolve and become non poisonous.&lt;ref name="voices.yahoo.com" /&gt; Some brands of ''habushu'' come with the snake still inside the bottle.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://passionatefoodie.mobiforumz.com/category/okinawa/ |title=Saké Sunday: Saké With a Snake? |accessdate=2008-08-19 |date=2008-02-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604073906/http://passionatefoodie.mobiforumz.com/category/okinawa/ |archivedate=2008-06-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two methods of inserting the snake into the alcohol. The maker may choose to simply submerge the snake in the alcohol and seal the bottle, thus drowning the snake. Alternatively, the snake may be put on ice until it passes out, at which point it is gutted, bled and sewn up. When the viper is thawed and awakens, it will quickly die in an aggressive striking manner, which is what most producers look for. The manufacturer will then put the habu in an ethanol bath for a month to preserve it.&lt;ref name="voices.yahoo.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://voices.yahoo.com/worm-snake-which-prefer-liquor-489552.html |title=Worm or Snake: Which do you prefer in your liquor? |accessdate=2011-12-02 |date=2007-08-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405190846/http://voices.yahoo.com/worm-snake-which-prefer-liquor-489552.html |archivedate=2012-04-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; To continue the process, the habu is put in a 59% alcohol mix for 40 days and finally put in a 35% [[awamori]] mix to prepare for consumption. Removing the intestines of the snake, as in the second method, is thought to decrease the drink's particularly unpleasant smell.

A habu snake is able to mate for as long as 26 hours, which causes some to believe that a drink of habushu may help sexual dysfunction in men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.okinawamarket.com/en/?cid=12 |title=Habu Sake |accessdate=2011-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common superstition is that these strengths are passed on to those who drink habushu.

'''Harlan Hall''' is a historic [[opera house]] located at 603 Locust St. in [[Marshall, Illinois|Marshall]], [[Illinois]]. The opera house opened in 1872 to provide a venue for theatrical performances in Marshall. The building has an [[Italianate architecture|Italianate]] design with tall, narrow windows, wide [[bracket (architecture)|bracket]]ed [[eave]]s, and a steeply sloping roof. Both local and traveling theatrical acts performed in the theater, which also hosted concerts, public meetings, and other events. The opera house had a [[livery stable]] on its first floor for its patrons' horses, an unusual feature for contemporary theaters. In 1904, B. F. Johnson purchased the building and converted it to a [[movie theater]]; while it still served as a civic auditorium, the building no longer showed theatrical performances after this point. The building has since held a [[Loyal Order of Moose|Moose Lodge]], and its first floor has been converted to a commercial space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Macey|first=Damian T.|title=National Register of Historic Places Registration Form: Harlan Hall|url=http://gis.hpa.state.il.us/pdfs/218417.pdf|publisher=[[National Park Service]]|accessdate=March 10, 2014|date=June 28, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on November 29, 2001.&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt;

'''''How to Eat Like a Child – And Other Lessons in Not Being a Grown-up''''' is an original [[musical theatre|musical]] [[comedy]] [[television special]] that aired on [[NBC]] on September 22, 1981.  Based on [[Delia Ephron]]'s best-selling book of the same name, and adapted for television by [[Judith Kahan]] with music and lyrics by [[John Forster (musician)|John Forster]], the one-hour special, through a series of comedy skits and songs, lampoons the adult world through the eyes of children.  The musical variety stars [[Dick Van Dyke]] as the resident "grown-up" alongside 15 children (8 boys and 7 girls) ranging in age from 7 to 13.  Several of the special's young performers would subsequently go on to achieve child stardom in their own right, most notably [[Corey Feldman]], [[Billy Jacoby]] and [[Georg Olden (actor)|Georg Olden]].&lt;ref name="The Chicago Tribune"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/635651822.html?dids=635651822:635651822&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Sep+18%2C+1981&amp;author=&amp;pub=Chicago+Tribune&amp;desc=Some+fun+lessons+in+fun&amp;pqatl=google|title=Some fun lessons in fun|author=Marilynn Preston|date=September 18, 1981|work=The Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Los Angeles Times"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/663053972.html?dids=663053972:663053972&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Sep+20%2C+1981&amp;author=&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc=SHOW+OF+THE+WEEK&amp;pqatl=google|title=Show of the Week|author=Cecil Smith|date=September 20, 1981|work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Boston Globe"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/684410121.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Sep+21%2C+1981&amp;author=Robert+A.+McLean+Globe+Staff&amp;pub=Boston+Globe+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&amp;desc=VAN+DYKE+BIG+IN+KIDS'+WORLD&amp;pqatl=google|title=Van Dyke Big In Kids' World|author=Robert A.

==Synopsis==
[[Dick Van Dyke]] opens the musical, stating "When you're a child, having fun is what you do for a living".  As the "guest adult", Van Dyke seeks admission to the secret world of children and persuades a group of 15 singing and dancing kids to guide him on a wry and whimsical trip through childhood.  Throughout a series of 12 comedy sketches and songs, the special takes an irreverent, but good-natured look at the time-honored dilemmas that children face.&lt;ref name="The Chicago Tribune"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Los Angeles Times"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Boston Globe"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Baltimore Sun"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Daily Times"/&gt;

The musical sketches include: "How to Eat Like a Child" (bite a hole in the bottom of the cone and suck out the ice cream.), "How to Stay Home from School" (flu, mumps, stomach ache, or maybe all three.), "How to Understand Parents" ("We'll see" means "no", "Not now" means "no", "Ask your father" means "no"...), "How to Laugh Hysterically" (a young [[Corey Feldman]] makes prank phone calls and cracks juvenile jokes before hanging up), "How to Act After Being Sent to Your Room" ("With nothing but my private stereo media center to keep me distracted, I think they overreacted..."), "How to Beg for a Dog" ([[Billy Jacoby]] playing opposite [[Judith Kahan]]'s real-life stepson's four-legged friend, "Bandit"), "How to Torture Your Sister" (a quartet of boys antagonizing their female siblings), "How to Deal with Injustice" (having to walk to the candy store when the adults can just get in a car and drive), "How to Practice the Violin" (a pre-adolescent [[Georg Olden (actor)|Georg Olden]] transforms into rock-star [[Mick Jagger]] after growing tired of practicing his violin), and the big finale number, "How to Refuse to Go to Sleep".&lt;ref name="The Chicago Tribune"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Los Angeles Times"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Boston Globe"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Baltimore Sun"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Daily Times"/&gt;

A couple of the numbers take on more serious issues that children face, including "How to Wait" (a segment which depicts a youngster impatiently waiting to be picked up at a bus stop, while addressing a child's anxieties and fears about being left alone), and "The Kid Inside" (a song in which Van Dyke provides an adult's perspective as he confides in the youngsters that children aren't the only ones to experience sadness and disappointment when one of their prized possessions is damaged and/or destroyed).&lt;ref name="The Chicago Tribune"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Los Angeles Times"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Boston Globe"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Baltimore Sun"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Daily Times"/&gt;

==Production==
The special was based on [[Delia Ephron]]'s best-selling book, "How to Eat Like a Child" (written largely from an "adult" perspective, appealing to adults who enjoyed the memories of childhood) and was adapted for television by [[Judith Kahan]], an alum of [[Boston University]] and the improvisational comedy troupe "The Proposition".  Produced by [[MTM Enterprises]], Kahan worked on the script for a year, while competing with [[Walt Disney Productions]], which had wanted to adapt the book as an animated cartoon.  The special's 12 original songs were written by composer-lyricist [[imdbname:1113154|John Forster]].&lt;ref name="The Chicago Tribune"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Los Angeles Times"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Boston Globe"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Baltimore Sun"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Daily Times"/&gt;

Making its television premiere on Tuesday, September 22, 1981 (7pm or 8pm, depending on the time-zone), ''"How to Eat"'' aired as one of [[NBC]]'s "Project Peacock" children's specials, the first series of prime-time specials for youngsters and their families on network television and was billed as "a look at the manners, language and logic of adults in training."  The special aired as part of NBC's "theme week" entitled "Get High on Yourself" which had begun that Sunday, September 20, 1981 and that NBC deemed in its press materials as "the biggest and most concentrated, positive, alternative-to-drugs campaign ever produced for television."&lt;ref name="The Chicago Tribune"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Los Angeles Times"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Boston Globe"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Baltimore Sun"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Daily Times"/&gt;

==Reception==
''"How to Eat"'' received largely positive reviews from critics, who commended everything from the insightful writing to the witty songs, as well as the special's talented young performers.  The ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'s'' television critic Marilyn Preston wrote, "The show has fun with children, as opposed to those that make fun of children, which is what most kid shows do.  A talented writer-producer named [[Judith Kahan]] put this one together, basing her cleverness on the cleverness of [[Delia Ephron]] who wrote the original book. [...] Thanks to 12 mostly terrific tunes by composer-lyricist [[imdbname:1113154|John Forster]], it's a reasonably fast and funny story. [...] Each skit has a theme and a song, and each song has a story to tickle your funnybone or your memory, depending on your age. [...] NBC could do a lot worse with it's children's programming...and usually does."&lt;ref name="The Chicago Tribune"/&gt;

''[[Baltimore Sun]]'' critic Bill Carter expressed appreciation for the special's young performers, writing "(''How to Eat Like a Child'') is an hour of true children's entertainment – that means both that it will entertain children and that children do the entertaining.  They sing, they dance, they cut up and they outperform just about every adult you've seen on a variety show in years. [...] If any big person can scale down to the level of a kid, without being condescending, it's the always elastic [[Dick Van Dyke|Van Dyke]].  The real performers, however, are 15 energetic, gifted young people, many of whom may be heading for future show-biz assignments after the act they pull off in this one. [...]  The main kid, called George in the show ([[Georg Olden (actor)|Georg Olden]]), has a kind of chip-on-the-shoulder mien; but he sings as sweetly as a choirboy.  Another standout is a golden-haired youth ([[imdbname:0293289|Andy Freeman]]) with a throat just as golden.&lt;ref name="The Baltimore Sun"/&gt;
 
While somewhat concerned by some of the "lessons" children watching might learn (i.e. learning how to harass a sibling, or how to make "prank" phone calls), ''[[Boston Globe]]'' critic Robert A. McLean also praised the special, writing, "(Van Dyke) and the talented, charming kids assembled for the happy hour are aided and abetted by a marvelously-upbeat TV adaptation by Judith Kahan. [...] If you've ever been sent to your room, or told to pipe down and go to sleep, or heard one of the parental phrases which means 'no!', then this will be a special treat for you, regardless of your age. [...] All the kids are great.  [[imdbname:0414589|Rachel Jacobs]], a blonde doll with a flair for histrionics is wonderful in a touching birthday sequence. [...] And [[imdbname:1214299|Rebecca Wolfe]] (mistakenly giving her name as "Rachel Wolfe"), a saucy maid with spectacles and pigtails, is a low-key charmer who apparently could sell Van Dyke the Brooklyn Bridge."&lt;ref name="The Boston Globe"/&gt;

''[[Associated Press]]'' television writer Fred Rothenberg was less impressed with the network's attempt at a prime-time musical for children, writing "This is the kind of thing Public Broadcasting's ''[[Sesame Street]]'' and ''[[The Electric Company]]'' win awards for.  But take the same concepts to network TV in prime time and it loses something in the translation and transition. [...] We watched the program with three neighborhood kids, ranging in age from 6 to 8.  They seemed to enjoy watching the kids on the screen, but the musical variety nature of the program, the hook for adults in prime time, was lost on them completely."  However, he, too, would go on to praise some of the elements of the special, writing, "There were some highlights.  A fantasy imitation of Rolling Stone, Mick Jagger from a kid ([[Georg Olden (actor)|Georg Olden]]) tired of practicing the violin (and) all the different ways parents say 'no'."&lt;ref name="The Daily Times"/&gt;

==Theatrical adaptation==
After the television premiere of ''How to Eat Like a Child'', the musical was subsequently adapted for the stage as a one-act musical revue performed exclusively by children, using songs from the original NBC special.  The first theatrical production was by TADA! (the Theater And Dance Alliance) in [[New York City]] in 1984.&lt;ref name="Newsday"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/newsday/access/104582112.html?dids=104582112:104582112&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jul+12%2C+1987&amp;author=By+Renee+Kaplan&amp;pub=Newsday+(Combined+editions)&amp;desc=CHOICESWHAT'S+HAPPENING+THIS+WEEK&amp;pqatl=google|title=What's Happening This Week|author=Renee Kaplan|date=July 12, 1987|work=Newsday}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the original NBC production had used the child performers' real names (essentially crediting each child as portraying "himself" or "herself"), subsequent theatrical productions would continue to use the names of the original NBC players as the young characters' names in the stage adaptation.  With the original special running approximately 45 minutes without commercials, the revue was also expanded to include a total of 22 lessons and 2 optional "supplemental" lessons.  These 24 "Lessons" are:

'''Jack Leon Ruby''' (born '''Jacob Leon Rubenstein'''; April 25, 1911&lt;ref&gt;The Warren Commission found that various dates were given in the records for Ruby's birth; the one most used by Ruby himself was March 25, 1911 (''The Warren Report: Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy'', 1964). His tombstone at Westlawn Cemetery, Chicago has April 25, 1911 as his birthdate&lt;/ref&gt; – January 3, 1967) was the [[Dallas, Texas]] [[nightclub]] owner who fatally shot [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] on November 24, 1963, while Oswald was in police custody after being charged with [[assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassinating]] [[John F. Kennedy|U.S. President John F. Kennedy]] and the murder of Dallas policeman [[J. D. Tippit]] about an hour later. A Dallas jury found him guilty of murdering Oswald, and he was sentenced to death. Ruby's conviction was later appealed, and he was granted a new trial. However, on January 3, 1967, as the date for his new trial was being set,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|authorlink=Martin Waldron |first=Martin|last=Waldron|title=Ruby Seriously Ill In Dallas Hospital|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 10, 1966|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruby became ill in his prison cell and died of a [[pulmonary embolism]] from [[lung cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/01/us/phil-burleson-61-jack-ruby-s-lawyer.html New York Times] Retrieved September 19, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.co.uk/this-day-in-history/November-22 www.history.co.uk] Retrieved September 19, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1964 the [[Warren Commission]] concluded that Ruby acted alone in killing Oswald.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Commission Says Ruby Acted Alone in Slaying |first=John D. |last=Pomfret |newspaper=The New York Times |date=September 28, 1964 |page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various groups believed Ruby was involved with major figures in [[organized crime]] and that he killed Oswald as part of an [[John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories|overall plot surrounding the assassination of Kennedy]].

==Childhood and early life==
Jack Ruby was born Jacob Leon Rubenstein,&lt;ref name="Saturday2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bagdikian|first=Ben H.|authorlink=Ben Bagdikian|editor1-first=Clay|editor1-last=Blair Jr.|editor1-link=Clay Blair|date=December 14, 1963|title=The Assassin|journal=The Saturday Evening Post|issue=44|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; on March 25, 1911, in [[Chicago]] as the son of Joseph Rubenstein and Fannie Turek Rutkowski (or Rokowsky), both Polish-born [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]] from [[Sokołów Podlaski|Sokołów]].

Ruby was the fifth of his parents' 10 surviving children and grew up in the [[Maxwell Street]] area of Chicago. He had a troubled childhood and adolescence, which was marked by [[juvenile delinquency]] and time spent in foster homes. At age 11 in 1922, he was arrested for [[truancy]]. Ruby eventually skipped school enough times that he spent time at the [[Institute for Juvenile Research]]. Still a young man, he sold [[horse-racing]] tip sheets and various novelties, then acted as business agent for a local refuse collectors union that later became part of the [[International Brotherhood of Teamsters]] (IBT).&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Summers|Summers, Anthony]]. ''Not in Your Lifetime'', (New York: Marlowe &amp; Company, 1998), p. 332. {{ISBN|1-56924-739-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From his early childhood, Ruby was nicknamed "Sparky" by those who knew him.&lt;ref name="WCR-A16"&gt;{{cite book|title=Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report|year=1964|publisher=United States Government Printing Office|location=Washington, D.C.|page=786|chapter=Appendix 16: A Biography of Jack Ruby|chapterurl=https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/appendix-16.html|ref={{harvid|Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Appendix 16|1964}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; His sister, Eva Grant, said that he acquired the nickname because he resembled [[Barney Google and Snuffy Smith#Spark Plug|a slow-moving horse named "Spark Plug" or "Sparky"]] in the contemporary comic strip [[Barney Google]]. ("Spark Plug" debuted as a character in the strip in 1922, when Ruby was 11.)&lt;ref name="WCR-A16"/&gt; Other accounts say that the name was directly connected with his quick temper.&lt;ref name="WCR-A16"/&gt; In either event, Grant stated that Ruby didn't like the nickname Sparky and was quick to fight anyone who called him that.&lt;ref name="WCR-A16"/&gt;

In the 1940s Ruby frequented race tracks in Illinois and California. He was [[conscription|drafted]] in 1943 and served in the [[United States Army Air Forces|U.S. Army Air Forces]] during [[World War II]], working as an aircraft mechanic at U.S. bases until 1946. He had an honorable record and was promoted to [[Private First Class]]. Upon discharge, on February 21, 1946, Ruby returned to Chicago.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

In 1947 Ruby moved to Dallas where he and his brothers soon afterward shortened their surnames from Rubenstein to Ruby. The stated reason for this was that the name "Rubenstein" was too long and that he was "well known" as Jack Ruby.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7jrKTKDhvfkC&amp;pg=PA1089&amp;q=jack%20ruby%201947|title=Reclaiming History: The Assassination of President John F. Kennedy|isbn=9780393045253|last1=Bugliosi|first1=Vincent|location=New York|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Co|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruby later went on to manage various [[nightclub]]s, [[strip club]]s, and dance halls. He developed close ties to many [[Dallas Police Department|Dallas Police]] officers who frequented his nightclubs, where he provided them with free liquor, prostitutes and other favors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol9/html/HSCA_Vol9_0068a.htm Ruby's Friendships with Police Officers], House Select Committee on Assassinations – Appendix to Hearings, Volume 9, 5, pp. 127–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruby never married; he had no children. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libarts.uco.edu/history/faculty/roberson/course/1493/supplements/chp27/27.%20Jack%20Ruby.htm|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130217110031/http://www.libarts.uco.edu/history/faculty/roberson/course/1493/supplements/chp27/27.%20Jack%20Ruby.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=February 17, 2013|title=Ruby, Jack L.

== Illegal activities in Dallas ==
There was evidence indicating Jack Ruby had been involved in the [[Organized crime|underworld]] activities of illegal gambling, narcotics, and prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://jfk.hood.edu/Collection/Weisberg%20Subject%20Index%20Files/R%20Disk/Ruby%20Jack%20As%20Gangster%20Related/Item%2001.pdf|title=The Secret Life of Jack Ruby|last=|first=|date=23 January 1978|work=New Times|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

A 1956 [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] report stated that their informant Eileen Curry reported that in January of that year, she moved to Dallas with her boyfriend, James Breen, after jumping [[Bail in the United States|bond]] on narcotics charges. Breen told her that he had made connections with a large narcotics setup operating between Texas, Mexico, and the East and that "in some fashion, James got the okay to operate through Jack Ruby of Dallas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=FBI interview |url=https://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh23/pdf/WH23_CE_1761.pdf |website=history-matters.com |accessdate=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Former Dallas County Sheriff Steve Guthrie told the FBI that he believed Ruby "operated some prostitution activities and other vices in his club" since living in Dallas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=FBI Report |url=https://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh22/pdf/WH22_CE_1251.pdf |website=www.history-matters.com |accessdate=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Dallas disc jockey Kenneth Dowe testified that Ruby was known around the station for "procuring women for different people who came to town."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/russ/testimony/dowe.htm|title=TESTIMONY OF KENNETH LAWRY DOWE|website=mcadams.posc.mu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==John F. Kennedy assassination==
{{Main|Assassination of John F. Kennedy}}

===November 21===
The [[Warren Commission]] attempted to reconstruct Ruby's movements from November 21, 1963 through November 24.{{sfn|Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Chapter 6|1964|p=333}} The Commission reported that he was attending to his duties as the proprietor of the Carousel Club located at 1312 1/2 Commerce St. in [[downtown Dallas]] and the Vegas Club in the city's [[Oak Lawn, Dallas|Oak Lawn district]] from the afternoon of November 21 to the early hours of November 22.{{sfn|Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Chapter 6|1964|p=333}}

===November 22: The assassination of Kennedy===
According to the Warren Commission, Ruby was in the second-floor advertising offices of the ''[[Dallas Morning News]]'', five blocks away from the [[Texas School Book Depository]], placing weekly advertisements for his nightclubs when he learned of the assassination around 12:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.{{sfn|Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Chapter 6|1964|pp=334–335}} Ruby then made phone calls to his assistant at the Carousel Club and to his sister.{{sfn|Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Chapter 6|1964|p=334}} The Commission stated that an employee of the ''Dallas Morning News'' estimated the fact that Ruby left the newspaper's offices at 1:30&amp;nbsp;p.m., but indicated that other testimony suggested he may have left earlier.{{sfn|Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Chapter 6|1964|pp=334–335}}

According to the Warren Commission, Ruby arrived back at the Carousel Club shortly before 1:45 pm to notify employees that the club would be closed that evening.{{sfn|Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Chapter 6|1964|pp=336–337}}

Ruby was seen in the halls of the [[Dallas Municipal Building|Dallas Police Headquarters]] on several occasions after Lee Harvey Oswald's arrest on November 22, 1963. Newsreel footage from [[WFAA]]-TV (Dallas) and [[NBC News|NBC]] shows that Ruby impersonated a newspaper reporter during a press conference at Dallas Police Headquarters on the night of Kennedy's death.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Summers|Summers, Anthony]].

On November 24, Ruby drove into town with one of his pet dogs and sent an emergency money order at the Western Union on Main Street to one of his employees. The time stamp of completion for the cash transaction on the money order was 11:17 A.M. Ruby then walked one half block to the nearby Dallas police headquarters, where he made his way into the basement via either the Main Street ramp&lt;ref name="WCR-C5"&gt;{{cite book |title=Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F.

Ruby was immediately subdued by agents and police. The shooting was broadcast live nationally, and millions of television viewers witnessed it. Oswald was taken by ambulance while unconscious to [[Parkland Memorial Hospital]]—the same hospital where doctors tried to save President Kennedy's life two days earlier. Oswald died at 1:07&amp;nbsp;p.m.&lt;ref name="Saturday2"/&gt;

[[File:Jack Ruby mugshot.jpg|thumb|[[Dallas Police Department]] [[Mug shot|mugshots]]]]
After his arrest, Ruby asked Dallas attorney Tom Howard to represent him. Howard accepted and asked Ruby if he could think of anything that might damage his defense. Ruby responded that there would be a problem if a man by the name of "Davis" should come up. Ruby told his attorney that he "... had been involved with Davis, who was a [[arms trafficking|gunrunner]] entangled in anti-Castro efforts."&lt;ref&gt;Kantor, Seth. ''Who Was Jack Ruby?'', (New York: Everest House Publishers, 1978), p. 44. {{ISBN|0-89696-004-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol9/html/HSCA_Vol9_0096a.htm Possible Associations Between Jack Ruby and Organized Crime], House Select Committee on Assassinations – Appendix to Hearings, Volume 9, 5, p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, Ruby replaced attorney Tom Howard with prominent [[San Francisco]] defense attorney [[Melvin Belli]] who agreed to represent Ruby ''[[pro bono]]''. On March 14, 1964, Ruby was convicted of murder with malice and was sentenced to death.

Ruby's conviction was overturned by the [[Texas Court of Criminal Appeals]] on the grounds that "an oral confession of premeditation made while in police custody" should have been ruled inadmissible, because it violated a Texas criminal statute.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Rubenstein v. State, 407 S.W.2d 793, 795 (Tex. Crim. App. 1966).&lt;/ref&gt;  The court also ruled that the venue should have been changed to a Texas county other than the one in which the high-profile crime had been committed.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  
Ruby died technically unconvicted, because his original conviction was overturned and his retrial was pending at the time of his death.

During the six months following [[John F. Kennedy assassination|Kennedy's assassination]], Ruby repeatedly asked, orally and in writing, to speak to the members of the [[Warren Commission]]. The commission initially showed no interest. Only after Ruby's sister Eileen wrote letters to the commission (and her letters became public) did the Warren Commission agree to talk to Ruby. In June 1964, Chief Justice [[Earl Warren]], then-Representative [[Gerald R. Ford]] of [[Michigan]], and other commission members went to Dallas to see Ruby. Ruby asked Warren several times to take him to [[Washington D.C.]], saying "my life is in danger here" and that he wanted an opportunity to make additional statements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh5/html/WC_Vol5_0102b.htm Testimony of Jack Ruby], Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 5, pp. 194–196.&lt;/ref&gt; He added: "I want to tell the truth, and I can't tell it here."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh5/html/WC_Vol5_0102b.htm Testimony of Jack Ruby], Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 5, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; Warren told Ruby that he would be unable to comply, because many legal barriers would need to be broken, and public interest in the situation would be too heavy. Warren also told Ruby that the commission would have no way of protecting him, since it had no police powers. Ruby said he wanted to convince President [[Lyndon Johnson]] that he was not part of any conspiracy to kill Kennedy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh5/html/WC_Vol5_0110a.htm Testimony of Jack Ruby], Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 5, pp. 209–212.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, the appellate court agreed with Ruby's lawyers that he should be granted a new trial. On October 5, 1966, the court ruled that his motion for a [[change of venue]] before the original trial court should have been granted. Ruby's conviction and [[death sentence]] were overturned. Arrangements were underway for a new trial to be held in February 1967 in [[Wichita Falls, Texas]], when on December 9, 1966, Ruby was admitted to [[Parkland Hospital]] in Dallas, suffering from [[pneumonia]]. A day later, doctors realized he had cancer in his [[Hepatocellular carcinoma|liver]], [[lung cancer|lungs]], and [[brain tumor|brain]]. Three weeks later, he died.

Ruby died of a [[pulmonary embolism]], secondary to [[bronchogenic carcinoma]] (lung cancer), on January 3, 1967, at [[Parkland Hospital]], the same facility where Oswald had died and where President Kennedy had been pronounced dead after his assassination. He was buried beside his parents in the [[Westlawn Cemetery]] in [[Norridge, Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ruby Buried in Chicago Cemetery A longside Graves of His Parents|date=November 7, 1967|newspaper=The New York Times|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ruby Called 'Avenger' at Rites in Chicago|date=January 7, 1967|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=The Los Angeles Times|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ruby Services Limited to Family, Few Friends|date=January 5, 1967|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=The Los Angeles Times|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Official investigations==

===Warren Commission===
The Warren Commission found no evidence linking Ruby's killing of Oswald with any broader conspiracy to assassinate Kennedy.&lt;ref name="WCR-C6"/&gt; In 1964, the [[Warren Commission]] provided a detailed biography of Ruby's life and activities to help ascertain whether he was involved in a conspiracy to assassinate Kennedy.{{sfn|Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Appendix 16|1964|p=779}} The Commission indicated that there was not a "significant link between Ruby and [[organized crime]]"{{sfn|Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Appendix 16|1964|p=801}} and said he acted independently in killing Oswald.&lt;ref name="WCR-C6"&gt;{{cite book |title=Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F.

Kennedy, Chapter 6|1964}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warren Commission investigator [[David Belin]] said that postal inspector Harry Holmes arrived unannounced at the Dallas police station and, upon invitation by the investigators, questioned Oswald, thus delaying his transfer by half an hour.&lt;ref name="Belin"&gt;{{cite news |last=Munns |first=Roger |date=December 15, 1991 |title=Warren panel's counsel: Stone's 'JFK' film a 'big lie' |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1243&amp;dat=19911215&amp;id=O14PAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=kIYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6974,4614754 |newspaper=The Bulletin |location=Bend, Oregon |agency=AP |page=A12 |accessdate=December 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Belin concluded that, had Ruby been part of a conspiracy, he would have been downtown 30 minutes earlier.&lt;ref name="Belin"/&gt;

In [[Gerald Posner]]'s book ''Case Closed: Lee Harvey Oswald and the Assassination of JFK'', Ruby's friends, relatives and associates claimed that he was upset over President Kennedy's death, even crying on occasions and closing his clubs for three days as a mark of respect.{{sfn|Posner|1993}} They also disputed the conspiracy claims, saying that Ruby's connection with gangsters was minimal at most and that he was not the sort to be entrusted with such an act within a high-level conspiracy.&lt;ref name="Posner_Case_Closed" /&gt;

Dallas reporter Tony Zoppi, who knew Ruby well, claimed that one "would have to be crazy" to entrust Ruby with anything as important as a high-level plot to kill Kennedy since he "couldn't keep a secret for five minutes ... Jack was one of the most talkative guys you would ever meet. He'd be the worst fellow in the world to be part of a conspiracy, because he just plain talked too much."{{sfn|Posner|1993|pp=361, 399}} He and others described Ruby as the sort who enjoyed being at "the center of attention", trying to make friends with people and being more of a nuisance.{{sfn|Posner|1993}}

Some writers, including former Los Angeles District Attorney [[Vincent Bugliosi]], dismiss Ruby's connections to organized crime as being highly minimal: "It is very noteworthy that without exception, not one of these conspiracy theorists knew or had ever met Jack Ruby. Without our even resorting to his family and roommate, all of whom think the suggestion of Ruby being connected to the mob is ridiculous, those who knew him, unanimously and without exception, think the notion of his being connected to the Mafia, and then killing Oswald for them, is nothing short of laughable."&lt;ref&gt;[[Vincent Bugliosi|Bugliosi, Vincent]], ''Reclaiming History: The Assassination of John F. Kennedy'' p. 1130.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bill Alexander, who prosecuted Ruby for Oswald's murder, equally rejected any suggestions that Ruby was part-and-parcel of organized crime, claiming that conspiracy theorists based it on the claim that "A knew B, and Ruby knew B back in 1950, so he must have known A, and that must be the link to the conspiracy."&lt;ref name="Posner_Case_Closed"&gt;{{cite book|title=Case Closed|last=Posner|first=Gerald|publisher=Warner Books|year=1993|ref=harv|authorlink=Gerald Posner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruby's brother Earl denied allegations that Jack was involved in racketeering Chicago nightclubs, and author Gerald Posner suggested that witnesses may have confused Ruby with Harry Rubenstein, a convicted Chicago felon.&lt;ref name="Posner_Case_Closed" /&gt; Entertainment reporter Tony Zoppi was also dismissive of mob ties. He knew Ruby and described him as a "born loser."&lt;ref name="Posner_Case_Closed" /&gt;

Author [[Norman Mailer]] and others have questioned why Ruby would have left his two beloved dogs in his car if he had planned on killing Oswald at police headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Oswald's Tale: An American Mystery|year=1995|publisher=Random House|first=Norman|last=Mailer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other investigations and dissenting theories==
{{Main|John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories}} &lt;!-- if this section remains "other investigations and dissenting theories", isn't there a slight overspecialization in this link – in other words, are all dissenting theories "conspiracy" theories? And didn't HSCA endorse "dissenting theories"? So shouldn't it be here instead of under "official"? But it was official, wasn't it, so therefore it belongs in the other section?--&gt;

Some critics have not accepted the conclusions of the Warren Commission and have proposed several other theories.
&lt;!--a good summary of dissenting theories is needed here, though note there is a separate article ("see also") to carry most of that load --&gt;

===Ruby's motive===
Ruby was arrested immediately after shooting Oswald, and he told several witnesses that he had been distraught over President Kennedy's death and had helped the city of Dallas "redeem" itself in the eyes of the public, and that his motive for killing Oswald was "saving [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Mrs. Kennedy]] the discomfiture of coming back to trial."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh5/html/WC_Vol5_0104b.htm Testimony of Jack Ruby], Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 5, pp. 198–200.&lt;/ref&gt; He also claimed he shot Oswald on the spur of the moment when the opportunity presented itself, without considering any reason for doing so.&lt;ref&gt;Ruby, ibid., p. 199&lt;/ref&gt; Ruby told the FBI he was "in mourning" Friday and Saturday. He said he cried when he heard the President was shot, "cried a great deal" Saturday afternoon and was depressed Saturday night. He explained that this grief was caused by his great love for the President and his sympathy for the Kennedy family, The anguish over the assassination, Ruby stated, finally "reached the point of insanity", suddenly compelling him to shoot when Oswald walked to the police ramp that Sunday morning.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; At the time of the shooting, Ruby said he was taking [[phenmetrazine]], a [[central nervous system]] [[stimulant]].&lt;ref name=WarrenCommission&gt;{{cite book|title=Testimony of Jack Ruby|volume=5|pages=198–99|url=http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh5/html/WC_Vol5_0104b.htm|year=1964|location=Washington|publisher=Government Printing Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruby broke into tears at his bond hearing in January 1964, as he talked to reporters regarding the assassination of President Kennedy. His voice breaking, Ruby said that he could not understand "how a great man like that could be lost." According to an unnamed [[Associated Press]] source, Ruby made a final statement from his hospital bed on December 19, 1966 that he alone had been responsible for the murder of Lee Harvey Oswald.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Associated Press|title=Ruby Asks World to Take His Word|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 20, 1966|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; "There is nothing to hide ... There was no one else," Ruby said.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,901898,00.html|title=A Last Wish|journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=December 30, 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

White House correspondent Seth Kantor — who was a passenger in President Kennedy's motorcade — testified that after President Kennedy was shot, he had visited [[Parkland Hospital]] while doctors were trying to save the President's life. Kantor said that as he entered the hospital, at about 1:30 pm, he felt a tug on his coat. He turned around to see Jack Ruby who called him by his first name and shook his hand;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh15/html/WC_Vol15_0044b.htm Testimony of Seth Kantor], Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 15, pp. 78–82.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kantor, Seth 1978 p. 41"&gt;Kantor, Seth. ''Who Was Jack Ruby?'', (New York: Everest House Publishers, 1978), p. 41. {{ISBN|0-89696-004-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; he said that he had become acquainted with Ruby while he was a reporter for the ''[[Dallas Times Herald]]'' newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh15/html/WC_Vol15_0041b.htm Testimony of Seth Kantor], Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 15, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kantor, Seth. ''Who Was Jack Ruby?'', (New York: Everest House Publishers, 1978), p. vi. {{ISBN|0-89696-004-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kantor, Ruby asked him if he thought that it would be a good idea for him to close his nightclubs for the next three nights because of the tragedy and Kantor responded with thinking that doing so would be a good idea.&lt;ref name="Kantor, Seth 1978 p. 41"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh20/html/WH_Vol20_0224b.htm Kantor Exhibit No. 7 – Kantor Exhibit No. 8], Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 20, pp. 428–437.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh15/html/WC_Vol15_0045b.htm Testimony of Seth Kantor], Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 15, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Warren Commission dismissed Kantor's testimony, saying that the encounter at Parkland Hospital would have had to take place in a span of a few minutes before and after 1:30 pm, as evidenced by telephone company records of calls made by both people then. The Commission also pointed to contradictory witness testimony and to the lack of video confirmation of Ruby at the scene.{{sfn|Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Chapter 6|1964|pp=335–337}} The Commission concluded that "Kantor probably did not see Ruby at Parkland Hospital" and "may have been mistaken about both the time and the place that he saw Ruby."{{sfn|Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Chapter 6|1964|pp=335–337}}

In 1979, the [[United States House Select Committee on Assassinations|House Select Committee on Assassinations]] reexamined Kantor's testimony and stated, "While the Warren Commission concluded that Kantor was mistaken [about his Parkland encounter with Ruby], the Committee determined he probably was not."&lt;ref name="HSCA Final Assassinations Report"&gt;[http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/hsca/report/html/HSCA_Report_0094b.htm HSCA Final Assassinations Report], House Select Committee on Assassinations, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Summers|Summers, Anthony]]. ''Not in Your Lifetime'', (New York: Marlowe &amp; Company, 1998), pp. 458–459. {{ISBN|1-56924-739-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kantor also reported that Ruby might have tampered with evidence while at Parkland.&lt;ref name="Kantor, Seth 1978 p. 192"&gt;Kantor, Seth. ''Who Was Jack Ruby?'', (New York: Everest House Publishers, 1978), p. 192. {{ISBN|0-89696-004-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goaded by the Warren Commission's dismissal of his testimony, Kantor researched the Ruby case for years. In a later published book ''Who Was Jack Ruby?'', Kantor wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The mob was Ruby's "friend." And Ruby could well have been paying off an IOU the day he was used to kill Lee Harvey Oswald. Remember: "I have been used for a purpose," the way Ruby expressed it to Chief Justice Warren in their June 7, 1964 session. It would not have been hard for the mob to maneuver Ruby through the ranks of a few negotiable police [to kill Oswald].&lt;ref&gt;Kantor, Seth. ''Who Was Jack Ruby?'', (New York: Everest House Publishers, 1978), p. 18. {{ISBN|0-89696-004-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[House Select Committee on Assassinations]] in its 1979 Final Report opined:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... Ruby's shooting of Oswald was not a spontaneous act, in that it involved at least some premeditation. Similarly, the committee believed it was less likely that Ruby entered the police basement without assistance, even though the assistance may have been provided with no knowledge of Ruby's intentions ... The committee was troubled by the apparently unlocked doors along the stairway route and the removal of security guards from the area of the garage nearest the stairway shortly before the shooting ... There is also evidence that the Dallas Police Department withheld relevant information from the Warren Commission concerning Ruby's entry to the scene of the Oswald transfer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/hsca/report/html/HSCA_Report_0094a.htm HSCA Final Assassinations Report], House Select Committee on Assassinations, pp. 157–158.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Lieutenant Billy Grammer, a DPD dispatcher, at 3am on November 24, he received an anonymous phone call from a man who knew Grammer's name. The caller told Grammer that he knew of the plan to move Oswald from the basement and that unless the plans for Oswald's transfer were changed, the caller warned "we are going to kill him". After Oswald was shot, Grammer, who knew Ruby, and found the voice familiar at the time of the call, identified Ruby as the caller. Grammer remained convinced that Ruby's shooting of Oswald was "a planned event".&lt;ref&gt;[[James W. Douglass]] (2008), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=NfvkfM8IbBsC&amp;pg=PA368 JFK and the Unspeakable: Why He Died and why it Matters, Volume 2]'', Orbis Books, p368, citing Grammer interview from [[Central Independent Television]]'s ''[[The Men Who Killed Kennedy]]''; Grammer comments extract [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEjT7XCN_R0 here]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Don Fulsom, ''Crime Magazine'', 27 March 2009, [http://www.crimemagazine.com/did-jack-ruby-know-lee-harvey-oswald Did Jack Ruby Know Lee Harvey Oswald?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171117223914/http://www.crimemagazine.com/did-jack-ruby-know-lee-harvey-oswald |date=November 17, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Detective Archer testified to the Warren Commission that when he searched Jack Ruby after his arrest, he was worried about Oswald's condition and he said to Ruby, "Jack, I think you killed him." Archer said that Ruby looked him straight in the eye and said, "Well, I intended to shoot him three times."  Seth Kantor believes that Ruby's response to Archer does not suggest a spontaneous reaction, and the very word "intended" implies having prior intention.&lt;ref name="Kantor, Seth 1978 p. 192"/&gt;

Ruby's explanation for killing Oswald would be "exposed ... as a fabricated legal ploy", according to the [[House Select Committee on Assassinations]]. In a private note to one of his attorneys, Joseph Tonahill, Ruby wrote: "Joe, you should know this. My first lawyer Tom Howard told me to say that I shot Oswald so that [[Caroline Kennedy|Caroline]] and Mrs. Kennedy wouldn't have to come to Dallas to testify. OK?"&lt;ref name="HSCA Final Assassinations Report"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"A Note from Jack Ruby", ''Newsweek'', March 27, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Summers|Summers, Anthony]].

[[G. Robert Blakey]], chief counsel for the [[House Select Committee on Assassinations]] from 1977 to 1979, said: "The most plausible explanation for the murder of Oswald by Jack Ruby was that Ruby had stalked him on behalf of organized crime, trying to reach him on at least three occasions in the forty-eight hours before he silenced him forever."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=0MeH1Z-Dd-QC&amp;pg=PA71&amp;q=stalked |last=Goldfarb |first=Ronald |title=Perfect Villains, Imperfect Heroes: Robert F.

In his testimony before the Warren Commission, Russell Lee Moore Knight said that Ruby held no bitterness towards Oswald and called him "a good looking guy" who resembled [[Paul Newman]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh15/html/WC_Vol15_0134a.htm Testimony of Russell Lee Moore (Knight)], Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 15, pp. 257.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Book on Kennedy assassination offers interesting facts|url=http://www.gmtoday.com/timeout/timeout05.asp|website=CBSNews.com|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=August 5, 2017|quote=When he first observed Oswald at Dallas police headquarters the day after JFK's assassination, hanger-on Ruby thought Oswald a handsome individual who resembled the actor Paul Newman.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, in his book, ''Contract on America'', David Scheim, presented evidence, that although some people claimed that they saw Ruby upset over the weekend of the assassination, others said that he wasn't. On Friday night, TV newsman Vic Robertson Jr. saw Ruby at Police Headquarters and reported that Ruby "appeared to be anything but under stress or strain. He seemed happy, jovial, was joking and laughing".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh21/html/WH_Vol21_0168b.htm RobertsonV Ex 2 - Copy of an FBI report of an interview with Victor F.

Scheim also presented evidence which he claimed was Ruby making several "candid confession(s)" whilst giving testimony to the Warren Commission.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; While talking, Ruby teared up when talking about a Saturday morning eulogy for President Kennedy but after composing himself, inexplicably said, "I must be a great actor, I tell you that."&lt;ref name="WarrenCommission"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Ruby also remarked "they didn't ask me another question: "If I loved the President so much, why wasn't I at the parade?"" (referring to the President's motorcade). Ruby added, "it's strange that perhaps I didn't vote for President Kennedy, or didn't vote at all, that I should build up such a great affection for him".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh14/html/WC_Vol14_0286b.htm Testimony of Jack Ruby], Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 14, pp. 564–565.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Jada, a club stripper of Ruby, during an interview with ABC's Paul Good, said about Ruby, "I believe he disliked [[Bobby Kennedy]]".&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Schiem also noted several people who knew Ruby, who claimed that the patriotic statements Ruby professed were quite out of character. Harry Hall, Ruby's partner in a gambling operation, told the FBI that "Ruby was the type who was interested in any way to make money" and also said that he "could not conceive of Ruby doing anything out of patriotism."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh23/html/WH_Vol23_0198a.htm CE 1753 - Secret Service report dated December 4, 1963, of interview of Harry Hall at Terminal Island Federal.], Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 23, pp. 363.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Jack Kelly, who had known Ruby casually since 1943, "scoffed at the idea of a patriotic motive being involved by Ruby in the slaying of Oswald", and reportedly stated that he "could not see Ruby" killing Oswald "out of patriotism"  but "for publicity
or ... for money."&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Ruby's friend Paul Roland Jones was paraphrased by his FBI interviewers as affirming that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;from his acquaintance with Ruby he doubted that he would have become emotionally upset and killed Oswald on the spur of the moment. He felt Ruby would have done it for money.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following Ruby's March 1964 conviction for murder with malice, Ruby's lawyers, led by [[Sam Houston Clinton]], appealed to the [[Texas Court of Criminal Appeals]], the highest criminal court in Texas. Ruby's lawyers argued that he could not have received a [[right to a fair trial|fair trial]] in Dallas because of the excessive publicity surrounding the case. A year after his conviction, in March 1965, Ruby conducted a brief televised news conference in which he stated: "Everything pertaining to what's happening has never come to the surface. The world will never know the true facts of what occurred, my motives. The people who had so much to gain, and had such an ulterior motive for putting me in the position I'm in, will never let the true facts come above board to the world." When asked by a reporter, "Are these people in very high positions, Jack?", he responded "Yes."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Haaretz]]'', David B. Green, January 3, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalist Seth Kantor speculated in 1978 that the man by the name of "Davis" that Ruby mentioned may have been [[Thomas Eli Davis III]], a CIA-connected [[mercenary]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Summers|Summers, Anthony]]. ''Not in Your Lifetime'', (New York: Marlowe &amp; Company, 1998), pp. 359–361, 226. {{ISBN|1-56924-739-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[James W. Douglass|Douglass, James]]. ''JFK and the Unspeakable'', (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 2008), pp. 357–358. {{ISBN|978-1-4391-9388-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dallas Deputy Sheriff Al Maddox claimed: "Ruby told me, he said, 'Well, they injected me for a cold.' He said it was cancer cells. That's what he told me, Ruby did. I said you don't believe that bullshit. He said, 'I damn sure do!' [Then] one day when I started to leave, Ruby shook hands with me and I could feel a piece of paper in his palm ... [In this note] he said it was a conspiracy and he said ... if you will keep your eyes open and your mouth shut, you're gonna learn a lot. And that was the last letter I ever got from him." In the note, Ruby claimed he was part of a conspiracy, and that his role was to silence Oswald.&lt;ref name="Crossfire"/&gt;
Not long before Ruby died, according to an article in the London ''[[The Sunday Times|Sunday Times]]'', he told psychiatrist Werner Teuter that the assassination was "an act of overthrowing the government" and that he knew "who had President Kennedy killed." He added: "I am doomed. I do not want to die. But I am not insane. I was framed to kill Oswald."&lt;ref name="Crossfire"&gt;{{cite book|last=Marrs|first=Jim|title=Crossfire: The Plot that Killed Kennedy|location=New York|publisher=Carroll &amp; Graf|year=1989|pages=431–432|isbn=978-0-88184-648-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Sunday Times'', August 25, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Summers|Summers, Anthony]]. ''Not in Your Lifetime'', (New York: Marlowe &amp; Company, 1998), p. 341. {{ISBN|1-56924-739-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book, ''Contract on America'', David Scheim presented evidence that Mafia leaders [[Carlos Marcello]] and [[Santo Trafficante, Jr.]], as well as organized labor leader [[Jimmy Hoffa]], ordered the assassination of President Kennedy. Scheim cited in particular a 25-fold increase in the number of out-of-state telephone calls from Jack Ruby to associates of these crime bosses in the months before the assassination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Scheim |first=David E. |title=Contract on America: The Mafia Murder of President John F.

In the light of the identity of some of the individuals with whom Ruby spoke, however, the possibility of other matters being discussed could not be dismissed."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol9/pdf/HSCA_Vol9_5E_AGVA.pdf Labor Difficulties with the American Guild of Variety Artists, Early 1960s], House Select Committee on Assassinations—Appendix to Hearings, vol. 9, 5E, p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his memoir, ''Bound by Honor'', [[Bill Bonanno]], son of New York Mafia boss [[Joseph Bonanno]], stated that he realized that certain Mafia families were involved in the JFK assassination when Ruby killed Oswald, since Bonanno was aware that Ruby was an associate of Chicago mobster [[Sam Giancana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bonanno|first=Bill|year=1999|title=Bound by Honor: A Mafioso's Story|location=New York|publisher=St Martin's Press|isbn=978-0-312-20388-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Associations with organized crime and gunrunning allegations===
In 1979, fifteen years after the Warren report, the [[House Select Committee on Assassinations]] undertook a similar investigation of Ruby and said that he "had a significant number of associations and direct and indirect contacts with underworld figures" and "the Dallas criminal element" but that he was not a "member" of organized crime.{{sfn|Report of the Select Committee on Assassinations of the U.S. House of Representatives, Chapter I, Section C|1979|p=148}}

Ruby was known to have been acquainted with both the police and the [[Italian-American Mafia|Mafia]]. The HSCA said that Ruby had known Chicago mobster [[Sam Giancana]] (1908–1975) and [[Joseph Campisi]] (1918–1990) since 1947, and had been seen with them on many occasions.&lt;ref&gt;HSCA Appendix to Hearings, vol. 9, p. 336, par. 917, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol9/html/HSCA_Vol9_0172b.htm Joseph Campisi].

Ancestry.com, Texas Death Index, 1903–2000 [database on-line], Provo, UT, USA: The Generations Network, Inc., 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Summers 1998 p. 346"&gt;[[Anthony Summers|Summers, Anthony]]. ''Not in Your Lifetime'', (New York: Marlowe &amp; Company, 1998), p. 346. {{ISBN|1-56924-739-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; After an investigation of Joe Campisi, the HSCA found:

&lt;blockquote&gt;While Campisi's technical characterization in federal law enforcement records as an organized crime member has ranged from definite to suspected to negative, it is clear that he was an associate or friend of many Dallas-based organized crime members, particularly [[Joseph Civello]], during the time he was the head of the Dallas organization. There was no indication that Campisi had engaged in any specific organized crime-related activities.&lt;ref&gt;HSCA Appendix to Hearings, vol. 9, p. 336, par. 916, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol9/html/HSCA_Vol9_0172b.htm Joseph Campisi].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Similarly, a [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] ''[[Frontline (US TV series)|Frontline]]'' investigation into the connections between Ruby and Dallas organized crime figures reported the following:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In 1963, Sam and Joe Campisi were leading figures in the Dallas underworld. Jack knew the Campisis and had been seen with them on many occasions. The Campisis were lieutenants of [[Carlos Marcello]], the Mafia boss who had reportedly talked of killing the President.&lt;ref&gt;Frontline: [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/oswald/cron/ Who Was Lee Harvey Oswald?], 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A day before Kennedy was assassinated, Ruby went to Joe Campisi's restaurant.&lt;ref name="HSCA-appendix-p344"&gt;HSCA Appendix to Hearings, vol. 9, p. 344, par. 919, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol9/html/HSCA_Vol9_0172b.htm Joseph Campisi].&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the Kennedy assassination, Ruby was close enough to the Campisis to ask them to come see him after he was arrested for shooting Lee Oswald.&lt;ref name="Summers 1998 p. 346"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;HSCA Appendix to Hearings, vol. 9, p. 344, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol9/html/HSCA_Vol9_0172b.htm Joseph Campisi].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fulsom, Don. ''Nixon's Darkest Secrets'', (New York: St. Martin's Press, 2012), p. 42. {{ISBN|978-0-312-66296-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joe Campisi and his wife visited with Jack Ruby in jail for ten minutes on November 30, 1963.&lt;ref name="HSCA-appendix-p344"/&gt;

Four years before the assassination of President Kennedy, Ruby went to see a man named Lewis McWillie in Cuba. Ruby considered McWillie, who had previously run illegal gambling establishments in Texas, to be one of his closest friends.&lt;ref name="Testimony of Jack Ruby"&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh5/html/WC_Vol5_0106a.htm Testimony of Jack Ruby], Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 5, p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time Ruby visited him, in August 1959, McWillie was supervising gambling activities at [[Havana]]'s [[Tropicana Club]]. Ruby told the Warren Commission that his August trip to Cuba was merely a social visit at the invitation of McWillie.&lt;ref name="Testimony of Jack Ruby"/&gt; The [[House Select Committee on Assassinations]] would later conclude that Ruby "... most likely was serving as a courier for gambling interests."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/hsca/report/html/HSCA_Report_0091b.htm HSCA Final Assassinations Report], House Select Committee on Assassinations, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol9/html/HSCA_Vol9_0093a.htm Possible Associations Between Jack Ruby and Organized Crime], House Select Committee on Assassinations – Appendix to Hearings, Volume 9, 5, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Summers|Summers, Anthony]]. ''Not in Your Lifetime'', (New York: Marlowe &amp; Company, 1998), p. 337. {{ISBN|1-56924-739-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee also found "circumstantial," but not conclusive, evidence that "... Ruby met with [Mafia boss] [[Santo Trafficante, Jr.|Santo Trafficante]] in Cuba sometime in 1959."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/hsca/report/html/HSCA_Report_0091b.htm HSCA Final Assassinations Report], House Select Committee on Assassinations, pp. 152–153.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Summers|Summers, Anthony]].

James E. Beaird, who claimed to be a [[poker]]-playing friend of Jack Ruby, told both ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'' and the [[FBI]] that Ruby smuggled guns and ammunition from [[Galveston Bay]], Texas to Fidel Castro's guerrillas in Cuba in the late 1950s. Beaird said that Ruby "was in it for the money. It wouldn't matter which side, just [whichever] one that would pay him the most." Beaird said that the guns were stored in a two-story house near the waterfront, and that he saw Ruby and his associates load "many boxes of new guns, including [[automatic rifles]] and handguns" on a 50-foot military-surplus boat. He claimed that "each time that the boat left with guns and ammunition, Jack Ruby was on the boat."&lt;ref&gt;Earl Golz, "Jack Ruby's Gunrunning to Castro Claimed", ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'', August 18, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;FBI document 602-982-243, June 10, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Summers 1998 p. 335"&gt;[[Anthony Summers|Summers, Anthony]]. ''Not in Your Lifetime'', (New York: Marlowe &amp; Company, 1998), p. 335. {{ISBN|1-56924-739-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blaney Mack Johnson, an FBI informant, said Ruby was "active in arranging illegal flights of weapons from Miami" to pro-Castro forces in Cuba in the early 1950s.&lt;ref name="Summers 1998 p. 335"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh26/pdf/WH26_CE_3063.pdf Commission Exhibit No. 3063], Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 26, pp. 634–638.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Ruby's shooting of Oswald, and his behavior both before and after the Kennedy assassination, have been the topic of numerous films, TV programs, books, and songs.
Articles of clothing that Ruby wore when he killed Oswald — including his suit, hat and shoes — are on display at the Historic Auto Attractions museum in Roscoe, Illinois.

===Film===
* [[Tom Skerritt]]'s ''[[Fighting Back (1982 American film)|Fighting Back]]''  has footage of his shooting of Oswald in its opening credits news special on violence.
* In [[Oliver Stone]]'s 1991 film ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'', Ruby was portrayed by actor [[Brian Doyle-Murray]]. Stone's perspective on events draws heavily from [[conspiracy theory]] researchers such as [[Jim Marrs]] and [[L. Fletcher Prouty]]. At least three scenes further detailing Ruby were removed from the film and are only available on DVD. One scene expanded on the Oswald shooting by showing corrupt Dallas police officers allowing Ruby to enter police headquarters through a restricted entrance.
*The 1992 film ''[[Ruby (1992 film)|Ruby]]'' speculated on complex motivations that might have propelled Ruby into shooting Oswald. Among these were Ruby's reputation among family and friends as an assiduous, emotionally volatile publicity-seeker, and the influence of his long-time organized crime and Dallas police connections. Ruby was played by [[Danny Aiello]].

===Literature===
*Ruby is one of the main characters of [[James Ellroy]]'s novel, ''[[The Cold Six Thousand]]''. The plot revolves around the aftermath of the assassination of President Kennedy, and the assassinations of Senator [[Robert Kennedy]] and [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] It speculates about government agencies like the [[CIA]] and the [[FBI]], as well as figures like [[J. Edgar Hoover]], and their links to [[American Mafia|Mafia]] and anti-[[Fidel Castro|Castro]] groups alleged to have been involved in the assassinations.
*In his 1989 novel ''[[Libra (novel)|Libra]]'', [[Don DeLillo]] portrays Ruby as being part of a larger conspiracy surrounding the President's assassination, imagining that a mob member persuades Ruby to kill Oswald.

===Music===
* In his autobiography, [[Robbie Robertson]] recounts a bizarre week when [[The Band#1960.E2.80.931964: The Hawks|the Hawks]], backing singer [[Ronnie Hawkins]], performed at the Skyline Lounge, a burnt-out club in [[Fort Worth, Texas]]. The owner, whom they knew as Jack, visited them at midnight and seemed to be constantly consuming "uppers".&lt;ref&gt;''Testimony'', Robbie Robertson, Penguin Random House, 2016, pp. 116–117,&lt;/ref&gt; A few months later, after the assassination of President Kennedy, "the realisation settled in for all of us Hawks: Jack, the owner of the Skyline Lounge who seemed to be tweaked on pep pills was none other than Jack Ruby."&lt;ref&gt;''Testimony'', Robbie Robertson, Penguin Random House, 2016, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;
* The alternative rock band [[Camper Van Beethoven]] included a song called "Jack Ruby" on their 1989 album [[Key Lime Pie (album)]].

===Television===
* ''[[Ruby and Oswald]]'' (1978), a made-for-television movie, generally followed the official record as presented by the [[Warren Commission]]. Ruby was played by [[Michael Lerner (actor)|Michael Lerner]].
* Ruby was also a character in one episode of the [[Starz]] TV series ''[[Magic City (TV series)|Magic City]]''. He was portrayed by Holland Hayes in season two's third episode, "Adapt or Die". Ruby was sitting next to the main character, Ike Evans, on his way back from [[Cuba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tv.avclub.com/magic-city-adapt-or-die-1798177226|title=Magic City: "Adapt Or Die"|first=Will|last=Harris|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ruby is portrayed by [[Casey Siemaszko]] in the 2013 television drama ''[[Killing Kennedy (film)|Killing Kennedy]]''.
* In the Hulu series ''[[11.22.63]]'', Jack Ruby is shown as a nightclub owner in 1960 Dallas played by [[Antoni Corone]].

The '''London International Stamp Exhibition''' was held from 14-26 May 1923 at the [[Royal Horticultural Hall]], London. It was organised by the Junior Philatelic Society (now the [[National Philatelic Society]]).

One of the key exhibits was the collection of Victoria Half-lengths formed by [[Charles Lathrop Pack]] along with his Diligencias. The roof of the hall was shaded in order to protect the numerous exhibits from the Sun and whitewash was used.&lt;ref name=LP&gt;"The Exhibition and After" in ''[[The London Philatelist]]'', Vol. 32, No. 376, April 1923, pp. 77-78.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mercury-Atlas 6''' ('''MA-6''') was the third [[human spaceflight]] for the U.S. and part of [[Project Mercury]]. Conducted by [[NASA]] on February 20, 1962, the mission was piloted by astronaut [[John Glenn]], who performed three orbits of the Earth, making him the first U.S. astronaut to [[Orbital spaceflight|orbit the Earth]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The [[Soviet Union]] had already placed two cosmonauts into orbit; [[Yuri Gagarin]] on [[Vostok 1]] on April 12, 1961 and [[Gherman Titov]] on [[Vostok 2]] on August 6, 1961. The two previous U.S. astronauts in space, [[Alan Shepard]] and [[Virgil I. Grissom|Gus Grissom]], had flown sub-orbital missions.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AnAmericaninOrbit"&gt;{{Cite book| url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/toc.htm| title=This New Ocean: A History of Project Mercury| format=url| chapter=13-4 An American in Orbit |chapterurl=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-4.htm| publisher=NASA| work=Published as NASA Special Publication-4201 in the NASA History Series| year=1989| first1=Loyd S.| last1=Swenson Jr.| first2=James M.| last2=Grimwood| first3=Charles C.| last3=Alexander| editor1-first=David| editor1-last=Woods| editor2-first=Chris| editor2-last=Gamble| accessdate=July 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mercury spacecraft, named '''''Friendship 7''''', was carried to orbit by an [[Atlas LV-3B]] launch vehicle lifting off from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 14|Launch Complex 14]] at [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Canaveral]], [[Florida]]. After four hours and 56 minutes in flight the spacecraft [[Atmospheric reentry|re-entered]] the Earth's atmosphere, splashed down in the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic Ocean]] and was safely taken aboard {{USS|Noa|DD-841|6}}.

The event was named an [[List of IEEE milestones|IEEE Milestone]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Milestones:List_of_IEEE_Milestones |title=List of IEEE Milestones |author= |date= |work=IEEE Global History Network |publisher=IEEE |accessdate=29 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the successful completion of the [[Mercury 5]] flight that carried [[Enos the Chimp|Enos]], a chimpanzee, in late November 1961, a press conference was held in early December. Reporters asked NASA's [[Robert Gilruth]] who would be the first U.S. astronaut in orbit, piloting Mercury 6. He then announced the team members for the next two Mercury missions. John H. Glenn was selected as prime pilot for the first mission (Mercury 6), with [[Scott Carpenter|M. Scott Carpenter]] as his backup. [[Deke Slayton|Donald K. Slayton]] and [[Wally Schirra|Walter M. Schirra]] were pilot and backup, respectively, for the second mission, [[Mercury-Atlas 7|Mercury 7]].

The Mercury 6 launch vehicle, Atlas #109-D, arrived at Cape Canaveral the evening of November 30, 1961. NASA had wanted to launch Mercury 6 in 1961 (hoping to orbit an astronaut in the same calendar year as the Soviets did), but by early December it was apparent that the mission hardware would not be ready for launch until early 1962.

Mercury spacecraft #13 began taking form on McDonnell's St. Louis, Missouri assembly line in May 1960. It was chosen for the MA-6 mission in October 1960 and delivered to Cape Canaveral on August 27, 1961. Mercury spacecraft #13 and Atlas #109-D were stacked on the pad at Launch Complex 14 on January 2, 1962.

As the effects of orbital space flight on humans were unknown except to the Soviets, who were keeping whatever knowledge they had a secret, Glenn was prepared with an onboard medical kit consisting of [[morphine]] for pain relief, [[mephentermine sulfate]] to treat any shock symptoms, [[benzylamine#Salts|benzylamine hydrochloride]] to counter motion sickness and [[racemic amphetamine sulfate]], a stimulant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.floridatoday.com/article/20120212/SPACE/302120012|title=For John Glenn, it's one more mission|date=Feb 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[survival kit]] was also placed on board to assist Glenn while waiting for recovery after splashdown including:  desalter kits, dye marker, distress signal, signal mirrors, signal whistle, first aid kits, shark chaser, a PK-2 raft, survival rations, matches, and a radio transceiver.&lt;ref name="/SP-4001"&gt;{{cite web|title=Project Mercury Chronology|url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4001/p2a.htm|publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flight==

===Delays===
The launch date was first announced as January 16, 1962, then postponed to January 20 because of problems with the Atlas rocket fuel tanks. The launch then slipped day by day to January 27 due to unfavorable winter weather. On that day, Glenn was on board Mercury 6 and ready to launch, when, at T-29 minutes, the flight director called off the launch because of thick clouds that would have made it impossible to photograph or film the launch vehicle after the first 20 seconds of the mission (the inability of launch crews to film the failed [[Mercury-Atlas 1]] launch 16 months earlier had proven the importance of flying only in clear skies). A large crowd of reporters gathered at Cape Canaveral for the launch went home disappointed. Mission Director Walter Williams felt a sense of relief at the bad weather, as there was still a general sense that the spacecraft and booster were not ready to fly yet. NASA informed the anxious public that the mission would take time to get ready since manned launches required a high degree of preparation and safety standards. The launch was postponed until February 1, 1962. When technicians began to fuel the Atlas on January 30, they discovered a fuel leak had soaked an internal insulation blanket between the RP-1 and LOX tanks. This caused a two-week delay while necessary repairs were made. On February 14, the launch was again postponed due to weather. Finally on February 18, the weather started to break. It appeared that February 20, 1962 would be a favorable day to attempt a launch.&lt;ref name=Chronology /&gt;

===Launch===
[[File:Glenn Enters his Mercury Capsule - GPN-2000-001029.jpg|thumb|left|Glenn entering ''Friendship 7'']]

Glenn boarded the ''Friendship 7'' spacecraft at 11:03 UTC on February 20, 1962 following an hour-and-a-half delay to replace a faulty component in the Atlas's guidance system. The hatch was bolted in place at 12:10 UTC. Most of the 70 hatch bolts had been secured, when one was discovered to be broken. This caused a 42-minute delay while all the bolts were removed, the defective bolt was replaced and the hatch was re-bolted in place.  The count was resumed at 11:25 UTC. The gantry was rolled back at 13:20 UTC.  At 13:58 UTC the count was held for 25 minutes while a liquid oxygen propellant valve was repaired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video

At 14:47 UTC, after two hours and 17 minutes of holds and three hours and 44 minutes after Glenn entered ''Friendship 7'', engineer [[T. J. O'Malley]] pressed the button in the blockhouse launching the spacecraft.&lt;ref name=Siceloff&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/topics/history/features/omalleyobit.html |title= Famed Engineer O'Malley Dies at age 94 |first=Steve |last=Siceloff|work= NASA News &amp; Features |accessdate=2009-11-14|date=2009-11-13|quote=O'Malley is perhaps best known as the man who pushed the button to launch the Atlas rocket that carried astronaut John Glenn into orbit on Feb. 20, 1962. }}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Malley said, "the good Lord ride all the way," and then capsule communicator [[Scott Carpenter]] uttered the famous phrase "Godspeed, John Glenn."&lt;ref name=NYT-1998-10-28&gt; {{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/28/us/at-cape-canaveral-reliving-the-grand-highs-of-62.html |title= At Cape Canaveral, Reliving the Grand Highs of '62 |author= John Noble Wilford |date= 28 October 1998 |publisher= New York Times }} &lt;/ref&gt; Due to a glitch in Glenn's radio, he did not hear the Carpenter phrase during launch.&lt;ref name="7 things"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/news/7-things-you-may-notknow-about-john-glenn-and-friendship-7|title=7 Things You May Not Know About John Glenn|author=Barbara Maranzani|date=8 December 2016|publisher=History.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; At liftoff Glenn's pulse rate climbed to 110 beats per minute. 

30 seconds after liftoff the General Electric-Burroughs designed guidance system locked onto a radio transponder in the booster to guide the vehicle to orbit. As the Atlas and ''Friendship 7'' passed through [[max Q]] Glenn reported, "It's a little bumpy about here." After max Q the flight smoothed out. At two minutes and 14 seconds after launch, the booster engines cut off and dropped away. Then at two minutes and twenty-four seconds, the [[escape tower]] was jettisoned, right on schedule.

After the tower was jettisoned, the Atlas and spacecraft pitched over still further, giving Glenn his first view of the horizon. He described the view as "a beautiful sight, looking eastward across the Atlantic". Vibration increased as the last of the fuel supply was used up. Booster performance had been nearly flawless through the entire powered flight. At sustainer engine cut-off it was found that the Atlas had accelerated the capsule to a speed only 7&amp;nbsp;ft/s (2&amp;nbsp;m/s) below nominal. At 14:52 UTC, ''Friendship 7'' was in orbit. Glenn received word that the Atlas had boosted the MA-6 into a trajectory that would stay up for at least seven orbits. Meanwhile, computers at the [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] in [[Maryland]] indicated that the MA-6 orbital parameters appeared good enough for almost 100 orbits.

===First orbit===
When the posigrade rockets fired and separated the capsule from the booster, the five-second rate-damping operation started two and a half seconds late. This caused a substantial roll error as the capsule began its turnaround. The automatic [[attitude control system]] took 38 seconds to place ''Friendship 7'' into its proper orbital attitude. The turnaround maneuver used 5.4 pounds (2.4&amp;nbsp;kg) of fuel from a total supply of 60.4 pounds (27.4&amp;nbsp;kg)
* 36&amp;nbsp;lb (16.3&amp;nbsp;kg) for automatic and
* 24.4&amp;nbsp;lb (11.1&amp;nbsp;kg) for manual control system
The spacecraft then settled into orbital flight with a velocity of 17,544&amp;nbsp;mph (7,843&amp;nbsp;m/s).

''Friendship 7'' began its first orbit with all systems go. It crossed the [[Atlantic]] and passed over the [[Canary Islands]]. Controllers there reported all capsule systems in perfect working order. Looking at the [[Africa]]n coastline, and later the interior over [[Kano]], [[Nigeria]], Glenn told the tracking station team that he could see a dust storm. Kano flight communicators replied that the winds had been quite heavy for the past week.

Over Kano, Glenn took control of the spacecraft and started a major [[Yaw (rotation)|yaw]] adjustment. He allowed the spacecraft to continue the yaw maneuver until it was facing into its flight path. Glenn noticed that the attitude indicators disagreed with what he observed was the true spacecraft attitude. Even with the incorrect instrument readouts, he was pleased to be facing forward instead of backward on his orbital path.

Over the [[Indian Ocean]], Glenn observed his first sunset from orbit. He described the moment of twilight as "beautiful". The sky in space was very black, he said, with a thin band of blue along the horizon. He said the sun set fast, but not as quickly as he had expected. For five or six minutes there was a slow reduction in light intensity. Brilliant orange and blue layers spread out 45 to 60 degrees on either side of the sun, tapering gradually toward the horizon. Clouds prevented him from seeing a [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]] flare fired by the Indian Ocean tracking ship as part of a pilot observation experiment.

Continuing his journey on the night side of Earth, nearing the [[Australia]]n coastline, Glenn made star, weather, and landmark observations. He looked for but failed to see the dim light phenomenon known as the [[zodiacal light]]; his eyes had insufficient time to adapt to the darkness.

The spacecraft came into radio range of [[Muchea Tracking Station|Muchea]], Australia. At the Mercury Tracking Station there, [[Gordon Cooper]] was the capsule communicator. Glenn reported that he felt fine and had no problems. He saw a very bright light and what appeared to be the outline of a city. Cooper said that he probably was looking at the lights of [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] and its satellite town of [[Rockingham, Western Australia|Rockingham]]. This turned out to be correct; many people in Perth turned on their lights so as to be visible to Glenn as he passed over.  "That sure was a short day," he excitedly told Cooper. "That was about the shortest day I've ever run into."

The spacecraft moved across Australia and across the [[Pacific]] to [[Canton Island]]. Glenn experienced a short 45 minute night and prepared the periscope for viewing his first sunrise from orbit. As the sun rose over the island, he saw thousands of "little specks, brilliant specks, floating around outside the capsule"; he momentarily felt that the spacecraft was tumbling or that he was looking into a star field. A quick hard look out of the spacecraft window corrected the illusion and Glenn was sure that the "fireflies", as he called them, were streaming past his spacecraft from ahead. They seemed to flow by slowly but did not seem to be coming from any part of the spacecraft, and they disappeared as ''Friendship 7'' moved into brighter sunlight. It was later determined that they were probably small ice crystals venting from onboard spacecraft systems.

"I am in a big mass of some very small particles, they're brilliantly lit up like they're luminescent. I never saw anything like it. They round a little: they're coming by the capsule and they look like little stars. A whole shower of them coming by. They swirl around the capsule and go in front of the window and they're all brilliantly lighted." Glenn started banging the capsule wall and watched the "fireflies" come off, just as Alan Shepard did.

[[File:Mercury-Atlas 6 Earth photo.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Photo taken by Glenn (with an [[Ansco]] Autoset, a rebadged [[Minolta Hi-Matic]]) during his flight]]

As the spacecraft crossed the [[Kauai, Hawaii]] tracking station, Glenn noticed a lot of interference on the HF radio band. As he crossed the Pacific coast of North America, the tracking station at [[Guaymas]], [[Mexico]], informed Mercury Control in Florida that a yaw thruster was causing attitude control problems. Glenn later recalled, this problem "was to stick with me for the rest of the flight".

Glenn noticed the control problem when the automatic stabilization and control system allowed the spacecraft to drift about a degree and a half per second to the right. Glenn switched control to manual-proportional control mode and moved ''Friendship 7'' back to the proper attitude. He tried different control modes to see which used the least fuel to maintain attitude. The manual fly-by-wire combination used the least fuel. After about twenty minutes the yaw thruster began working again and Glenn switched back to the automatic control system. It worked for a short time and then began having problems again, this time with the opposite yaw thruster. He then switched back to the manual fly-by-wire system and flew the spacecraft in that mode for the remainder of the flight.

===Second orbit===
As ''Friendship 7'' crossed [[Cape Canaveral]] at the start of its second orbit, flight systems controller Don Arabian &lt;ref name="Kranz 68"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=s9eOX7Sr6KkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Cliff%20Charlesworth&amp;source=gbs_book_other_versions#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Failure Is Not an Option: Mission Control from Mercury to Apollo 13 and Beyond''] [[Gene Kranz]], Simon and Schuster, 2000, {{ISBN|978-0-7432-0079-0}}, Chapter 3 "God Speed, John Glenn", pg. 68&lt;/ref&gt; noticed that "Segment 51", a sensor providing data on the spacecraft landing system, was giving a strange reading. According to the reading, the heat shield and landing bag were no longer locked in position. If this were the case, the heat shield was only being held against the spacecraft by the straps of the retro package. Mercury Control ordered all tracking sites to monitor "Segment 51" closely and advise Glenn that the landing-bag deploy switch should be in the "off" position.

Glenn was not immediately aware of the problem, but he became suspicious when site after site asked him to make sure that the landing-bag deploy switch was off. Meanwhile, ''Friendship 7'' was crossing the Atlantic for the second time. Glenn was busy manually keeping the spacecraft [[attitude (geometry)|attitude]] correct and also trying to accomplish as many of the flight plan tasks as he could.

Crossing over the Canary Islands, Glenn observed that the "fireflies" outside the spacecraft had no connection with gas from the reaction control jets. His suit temperature felt too warm, but he did not take time to adjust it. The Kano, Nigeria and [[Zanzibar]] sites suddenly noticed a 12 percent drop in the spacecraft secondary oxygen supply.

During his second pass over the Indian Ocean, Glenn found that the Indian Ocean tracking ship was in heavy weather. The tracking station had planned to release balloons for a pilot observation experiment, but instead the ship fired star-shell parachute flares as ''Friendship 7'' passed overhead. Glenn was able to observe the flashes of lightning from storms in the area but was unable to see the flares.

The temperature in Glenn's spacesuit was too warm. It had been since he passed over the Canary Islands, earlier in the second orbit. As he crossed the Indian Ocean he tried to adjust the suit temperature. As he approached Woomera, Australia, a signal light came on warning him of excess cabin humidity.  For the rest of the flight Glenn had to carefully balance suit cooling against the cabin humidity.

While he was still over Australia, another warning light came on, indicating that the fuel supply for the automatic control system was down to 62 percent. Mercury Control recommended that Glenn let the spacecraft [[attitude (geometry)|attitude]] drift to conserve fuel.

There were no more problems for ''Friendship 7'' during the remainder of the second orbit. Glenn continued to manually control the spacecraft attitude, not allowing it to drift too far out of alignment. In doing so, he consumed more fuel than a functioning automatic system would have used. Fuel consumption was 6 pounds (2.7&amp;nbsp;kg) from the automatic tank and 11.8 pounds (5.4&amp;nbsp;kg) from the manual tank, during the second orbit. This amounted to almost 30 percent of the total fuel supply.

===Third orbit===
On the third orbit of ''Friendship 7'', the Indian Ocean tracking ship did not attempt to launch any objects for pilot observation experiments, as the cloud coverage was still too thick. When the spacecraft came across Australia for the third time, Glenn joked with Cooper at the [[Muchea Tracking Station]]. Glenn asked Cooper to notify [[David_M._Shoup|General Shoup]], [[Commandant of the Marine Corps]], that three orbits should meet the minimum monthly requirement of four hours' flying time. He also asked to be certified as eligible for his regular flight pay.

===Reentry===

During Glenn's orbits, Mercury Control had been monitoring the problem with "Segment 51". The Hawaiian tracking station asked Glenn to toggle the landing bag deploy switch into the automatic position. If a light came on, reentry should take place while retaining the retro pack. Given the earlier questions about the landing bag switch, Glenn realized there must be a possible problem with a loose heat shield. The test was run but no light appeared. Glenn also reported there were no bumping noises during spacecraft maneuvers.

Mercury Control was still undecided on the course of action to take. Some controllers thought the [[retrorocket]] pack should be jettisoned after retrofire, while other controllers thought the retro pack should be retained, as added assurance that the heat shield would stay in place. Flight Director [[Chris Kraft]] and Mission Director Walter C. Williams decided to keep the retro pack in place during reentry. Walter Schirra, the California communicator at Point Arguello, relayed the instructions to Glenn: the retro pack should be retained until the spacecraft was over the Texas tracking station. After the mission was over, the "Segment 51" warning light problem was later determined to be a faulty sensor switch, meaning that the heat shield and landing bag were in fact secure during reentry.

Glenn was now preparing for reentry. Retaining the retro package meant he would have to retract the periscope manually. He would also have to activate the 0.05-g sequence by pushing the override switch. ''Friendship 7'' neared the California coast. It had been four hours and 33 minutes since launch. The spacecraft was maneuvered into retrofire attitude and the first retrorocket fired. "Roger. Retros are firing. ... Are they ever. It feels like I'm going back toward Hawaii.", Glenn radioed. The second and then the third retros fired at five-second intervals. The spacecraft attitude was steady during retrofire. Six minutes after retrofire; Glenn maneuvered the spacecraft into a 14-degree nose up, pitch attitude for reentry.

''Friendship 7'' lost altitude in its reentry glide over the continental United States, and headed toward splashdown in the Atlantic. The Texas tracking station told Glenn to retain the retro pack until the accelerometer read 1.5 ''g'' (14.7&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Glenn reported as he crossed Cape Canaveral he had been controlling the spacecraft manually and would use the fly-by–wire mode as a backup. Mercury Control then gave him the 0.05 ''g'' (0.49&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) mark, and he pressed the override button. About the same time, Glenn heard noises that sounded like "small things brushing against the capsule". "This is Friendship 7 - a real fireball outside," he radioed Mercury Control. A strap from the retro package broke partially loose and hung over the spacecraft window as it was consumed in the reentry plasma stream. The spacecraft control system was working well but the manual fuel supply was down to 15 percent. The peak of reentry deceleration was still to come. Glenn switched to fly-by-wire and the automatic tank supply. This combination had more available fuel.

The spacecraft now experienced peak reentry heating. Glenn later reported, "I thought the retro pack had jettisoned and saw chunks coming off and flying by the window." He feared the chunks were pieces of his heat shield that might be disintegrating. The chunks were pieces of the retro package breaking up in the reentry fireball.

After passing the peak ''g'' region, ''Friendship 7'' began oscillating severely. The astronaut could not control the ship manually. The spacecraft was oscillating past 10 degrees on both sides of the vertical zero-degree point. "I felt like a falling leaf," Glenn later said. He activated the auxiliary damping system, this helped stabilize the large yaw and roll rates. Fuel in the automatic tanks was getting low. Glenn wondered if the spacecraft would retain stability until it was low enough to deploy the [[drogue parachute]].

The automatic fuel supply ran out at 1 minute and 51 seconds, and manual fuel ran out at 51 seconds, before drogue chute deployment. The oscillations resumed. At 35,000 feet (10&amp;nbsp;km), Glenn decided to deploy the drogue chute manually to regain attitude stability. Just before he reached the switch, the drogue chute opened automatically at 28,000 feet (8.5&amp;nbsp;km) instead of the programmed 21,000 feet (6.4&amp;nbsp;km). The spacecraft regained stability and Glenn reported, "everything was in good shape."

At 17,000 feet (5&amp;nbsp;km) the periscope opened and was available for the astronaut to use. Glenn tried to look out the overhead window instead, but it was coated with so much smoke and film that he could see very little. The spacecraft continued to descend on the drogue chute. The antenna section jettisoned and the main chute deployed and opened to its full diameter. Mercury Control reminded Glenn to manually deploy the landing bag. He toggled the switch and the green light confirmation came on. A "clunk" could be heard as the heat shield and landing bag dropped into place, four feet (1.2 m) below the capsule.

===Splashdown===
[[File:USS Noa (DD-841) hoists Friendship 7 capsule aboard 1962.jpg|thumb|The destroyer {{USS|Noa|DD-841|2}} hoists the ''Friendship 7'' capsule aboard]]

The spacecraft splashed down in the North Atlantic at coordinates near {{Coord|21|20|N|68|40|W|}}, {{convert|40|mi|km}} short of the planned landing zone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/history/mercury/ma-6/docs/ma-6-results.pdf NASA Science MA-6 results PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; Retrofire calculations had not taken into account spacecraft weight loss due to use of onboard consumables. {{USS|Noa|DD-841|6}}, a destroyer code-named "Steelhead", had spotted the spacecraft when it was descending on its parachute. The destroyer was about {{convert|6|mi|km}} away when it radioed Glenn that it would reach him shortly. ''Noa'' came alongside ''Friendship 7'' seventeen minutes later.

One crewman cleared the spacecraft antenna and another crewman attached a line to hoist ''Friendship 7'' aboard. After being pulled from the water the spacecraft bumped against the side of the destroyer. Once ''Friendship 7'' was on deck, Glenn intended to leave the capsule through the upper hatch, but it was too hot in the spacecraft and Glenn decided to blow the side hatch instead. He told the ship's crew to stand clear and hit the hatch detonator plunger with the back of his hand. The detonator plunger recoiled, and slightly cut the astronaut's knuckles through his glove. With a loud bang, the hatch was off. A smiling Glenn got out of ''Friendship 7'' and stood on the deck of ''Noa''. His first words were, "It was hot in there."

The astronaut and spacecraft came through the mission in good shape.

=="The Fourth Orbit"==
After the return of ''Friendship 7'' NASA had announced on April 19, 1962 that the spacecraft would be lent to the United States Information Agency for a world tour. The Tour included more than 20 stops, and touching all continents. This tour became known as the "Fourth orbit of ''Friendship 7''".&lt;ref name="Mercurybook"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19630011968_1963011968.pdf|title="Project Mercury: A Chronology"|publisher=NASA|work=NASA report SP-4001|last=Grimwood|first=James M.|year=1963|access-date=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spacecraft location==
[[File:Friendship 7 National Air and Space Museum 2018.tif|thumb|The ''Friendship 7'' capsule on display at the National Air and Space Museum]]

Mercury spacecraft # 13 - ''Friendship 7'' - is currently displayed at the [[National Air and Space Museum]], Washington D.C.&lt;ref&gt;[http://americanspacecraft.com/pages/mercury/ma-6.html Mercury spacecraft #13 ''Friendship 7'' display page on A Field Guide to American Spacecraft website]&lt;/ref&gt;
On February 21, 1962, a metal fragment was recovered on a farm near Aliwal-North, [[South Africa]]. It was identified as coming from the MA-6 Atlas launch vehicle by numbers stamped on it. The fragment had landed on the farm after about eight hours in orbit. The fragments were recovered by the police and handed over to NASA, which returned it as a token of goodwill. The fragments are today on display in the Science Museum in Pretoria.

==Dramatization in film==
[[Philip Kaufman]]'s 1983 film [[The Right Stuff (film)|''The Right Stuff'']] includes a dramatization of the ''Friendship 7'' mission in which [[Ed Harris]] plays Glenn. The sequence depicts the spacecraft's three orbits and Glenn's responses to what he saw, sometimes quoted verbatim, as well as the concerns over the heat shield during reentry. The mysterious "fireflies" are also shown, but their true explanation is not revealed; instead they are depicted as magical protection summoned by [[Australian Aborigines]] at the [[Muchea Tracking Station]].

The 2016 film ''[[Hidden Figures]]'' features the ''Friendship 7'' mission in the climax of the movie, focusing on [[Katherine Johnson]]'s calculations of the landing.

==Anniversary commemoration==
On February 20, 2012, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the flight, Glenn was surprised with the opportunity to speak with the [[Expedition 30|orbiting crew]] of the [[International Space Station]] while Glenn was on-stage with [[NASA Administrator]] [[Charlie Bolden]] at [[Ohio State University]], where [[John Glenn School of Public Affairs|the public affairs school]] is named in honor of Glenn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/46455911/ns/technology_and_science-space/ |title=Armstrong honors Glenn 50 years after his orbit - NASA also surprised Glenn with space station chat |first=Kantele |last=Franko |date=20 February 2012 |work= |publisher=MSNBC.com |accessdate=21 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''million-dollar wound''' ([[American English]]) or '''Blighty wound''' ([[British English]], now obsolete) is military slang referring to a type of wound received in combat which is serious enough to get the soldier sent away from the fighting, but is neither fatal nor permanently crippling.

==Description==
In his World War II memoir ''[[With the Old Breed]]'', [[Eugene Sledge]] wrote that during the [[Battle of Okinawa]], the day after he tried to reassure a fellow [[United States Marine]] who believed he would soon die,&lt;ref name="sledge1981"&gt;{{cite book | title=With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa | publisher=Presidio Press | author=Sledge, E. B. | year=1981 | pages=220–221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Much to my joy I saw the friend with whom I'd had the conversation the night before. He wore a triumphant look of satisfaction, shook hands with me heartily, and grinned as a stretcher team carried him by with a bloody bandage on his foot. God or chance—depending on one’s faith— had spared his life and lifted his burden of further fear and terror in combat by awarding him a million-dollar wound.

The '''murder of Kayleigh Haywood''', a 15-year-old girl from [[Measham]], [[Leicestershire]], took place in November 2015, following online [[Child grooming|grooming]] by Luke Harlow, a 27-year-old man who had contacted her on the social networking website [[Facebook]].

Harlow and Kayleigh exchanged 2643 text messages following an initial contact on Facebook, and two weeks following the first contact, Kayleigh agreed to meet Harlow at his house in [[Ibstock]], Leicestershire, on 13 November 2015. Upon meeting, Harlow plied Kayleigh with large quantities of alcohol, and touched her sexually. He then informed his neighbour, 29-year-old Stephen Beadman, that he had a girl at his house. 

Beadman raped the drunken schoolgirl, before killing her with a brick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-leicestershire-36606210 |title=Kayleigh Haywood: How murdered schoolgirl was groomed online - BBC News |publisher=Bbc.com |date= |accessdate=28 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her body was found five days later in lakeside undergrowth near Ibstock. On 24 November 2015, an inquest heard that Kayleigh Haywood had died as a result of head and facial injuries, and her body had to be identified by dental records. A post-mortem examination also confirmed that she had been raped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/12014156/Kayleigh-Haywood-inquest-told-teenagers-body-had-to-be-identified-by-dental-records.html|title=Kayleigh Haywood inquest told teenager's body had to be identified by dental records|first=Leon|last=Watson|date=24 November 2015|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 November 2015, shortly after being arrested in connection with the disappearance and ultimately the murder of Kayleigh Haywood, Leicestershire Police announced that 29-year-old Stephen Beadman had been charged with rape and murder, and that 27-year-old Luke Harlow had been charged with grooming and with two counts of having sexual activity with a child. Both were remanded in custody to await trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leicestershire-34873648|title=Man, 28, accused of Kayleigh murder|date=20 November 2015|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beadman admitted the murder of Kayleigh Haywood on 5 April 2016, while Harlow admitted the grooming and sexual activity charges, but denied a charge of false imprisonment, meaning that he would face a Crown Court trial on that charge, while Beadman's sentencing would be delayed until afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/505996/Kayleigh-Haywood-murder-Stephen-Beadman-pleads-guilty-Leicester-Crown-Court|title=Gardener admits raping and killing tragic 15-year-old Kayleigh Haywood|date=5 April 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harlow was found guilty of that charge on 28 June 2016, with his sentencing and that of Beadman being heard on 1 July 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jun/28/luke-harlow-guilty-kayleigh-haywood-false-imprisonment-ibstock-leicestershire|title=Man found guilty of false imprisonment of Kayleigh Haywood, 15|last=Association|first=Press|date=28 July 2016|website=the Guardian|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harlow was sentenced to 12 years in prison, while Beadman was received life sentence with a minimum term of 35 years, meaning that he is likely to remain in prison until at least 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-leicestershire-36685923 |title=Kayleigh Haywood murder: Stephen Beadman jailed for life - BBC News |publisher=Bbc.com |date= |accessdate=28 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harlow was found to have groomed two other girls online, aged 13 and 15, both of whom believed he was their boyfriend.

The grooming and murder of Kayleigh Haywood resulted in 'Kayleigh's Love Story', a film produced by Leicestershire Police and Affixxius Films which was shown to schoolchidren in Leicestershire and Rutland. A second documentary was screened on [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]], entitled 'Murder on the Internet'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Machin |first=Helen |url=http://www.tamworthherald.co.uk/documentary-tells-how-kayleigh-was-groomed-online/story-30295825-detail/story.html |title=Channel 5 documentary tells how Kayleigh Haywood was groomed online |publisher=Tamworth Herald |date=11 April 2017 |accessdate=28 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1904">'''Nasir al-Dawla ibn Hamdan''' was a descendant of the [[Hamdanid dynasty]] who became a general of the [[Fatimid Caliphate]]. He played a leading role in the civil war of 1067–73 between the Fatimids' [[Turkic peoples|Turkish]] and [[Nubia]]n troops as the leader of the former. In this struggle, he requested the assistance of the [[Seljuks]] and even tried to abolish the Fatimid caliph [[Al-Mustansir Billah|al-Mustansir]] and restore allegiance to the [[Abbasids]]. He succeeded in becoming master of [[Cairo]] and reduced al-Mustansir to a powerless puppet, while his Turks plundered the palace and the treasury. His increasingly tyrannical regime led to a split and he was ousted for a time, but was able to regain control of Cairo in 1071/2. His rule was ended with the murder of himself and his family in March/April 1073. The anarchic conditions in the country continued until al-Mustansir called upon the governor of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Badr al-Jamali]], for aid in late 1073.{{sfn|Lev|1991|pp=44–45}}

'''Perth Theatre''' at 185 High Street, (no longer registered address) [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], [[Scotland]] opened in 1900 and was extended in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.culturalprofiles.net/scotland/Units/926.html|title = Perth Theatre|accessdate= 15 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building is [[listed building#Scotland|category B listed]] by [[Historic Scotland]],&lt;ref name=LBR&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hsewsf.sedsh.gov.uk/hslive/hsstart?P_HBNUM=39468 |title=Perth Theatre, listed Building Report |accessdate=2009-07-20 |publisher=Historic Scotland}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is operated by the charitable organisation Horsecross Arts, alongside sister venue [[Perth Concert Hall (Scotland)|Perth Concert Hall]]. 
On 4 January 2014, the theatre closed to undergo renovations and expansions. Among the plans for the theatre are new seats, another smaller theatre, and a new entrance. The original auditorium has also now been restored to its original condition, and the theatre reopened to the public in December 2017 with a pantomime.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.horsecross.co.uk/transform-perth-theatre-0&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The theatre opened on Perth High Street in 1900 and was planned to seat 950 in the auditorium, with pit, two balconies and boxes. It was created by the Perth Theatre &amp; Opera House Co Ltd and designed by Dundee`s City Architect, William Alexander. It is similar in style and layout to his design of Her Majesty`s Theatre, Dundee, but on a smaller scale. The foundation stone was laid in 1899 by actor George Alexander. The founding lessee was JH Savile, who owned Paisley Theatre, and in 1909 bought the Perth theatre outright. The Savile family continued to run the theatre until 1935, staging drama, opera, musicals, pantomime, revues and variety.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/PerthTheatres.htm&lt;/ref&gt; JH Savile also founded his own Repertory Companies in Paisley and Perth &lt;ref&gt;The Stage Year Book of 1916&lt;/ref&gt; which at their height produced 40 plays a year.

In 1935, Perth Theatre was sold to a new company created in London, the Perth Repertory Theatre Ltd., by Ernest Dence in support of his actress daughter Marjorie Dence, who succeeded as owner in 1937 on his death. Marjorie Dence and actor David Steuart co-founded their new venture, the Perth Repertory Company,  whose annual and highly acclaimed work covered nine months of repertory in and around Perth with three months of touring of the Highlands &amp; Islands, to the Northern Isles, and to the lowland towns of the Borders. In the first year alone 51 plays were produced. Perth Theatre hosted the first Scottish Theatre Festival in 1939 and again in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/PerthTheatres.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The founders added a second repertory company from 1946 to 1958, which alternated with Perth, ensuring repertory at Kirkcaldy, mainly in its Adam Smith Hall. Perth Repertory continued throughout the war and thrived until Miss Dence`s passing in 1966.
 
In her will, Dence gave first option to buy the theatre to the Scottish Committee of the Arts Council, which did so and transferred it to Perth City Council. Joan Knight was appointed as Artistic Director in 1968, continuing the repertory company and mentoring performers and would-be-directors. During her 26-year tenure at Perth Theatre, she oversaw a major rebuilding programme in 1981 and 1985, adding a restaurant, studio theatre, rehearsal room, more dressing rooms and a workshop facility.
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/PerthTheatres.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Perth Theatre's sister venue, Perth Concert Hall, was launched under the direction of the Jane Speirs, first CEO of Horsecross Arts. She also began fundraising for the theatre`s restoration and major redevelopment for which Richard Murphy, architects, were appointed by the Council in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.richardmurphyarchitects.com/viewItem.php?id=2469&lt;/ref&gt;

==Restoration==
'''Historic B-listed, Victorian Auditorium''' will be restored to its former glory. The upper circle will be reinstated and an orchestra area will be re-introduced. The theatre will also benefit from improvements to seating, sightlines, circulation, ventilation, lighting and new equipment.

'''Studio Theatre'''
A new 200-seat capacity, courtyard-style studio theatre will be built to meet the demand for staging small to mid-scale performances.

'''Creative Learning'''
An extension will provide a number of spaces for creative learning activities and a home for Perth Youth Theatre.

'''Access'''
For the first time there will be level access to Perth Theatre's foyer, Box Office, auditorium, creative learning spaces and café, bar and restaurant from a new Mill Street entrance. There will also be a lift to allow ease of access to all other levels. The High Street entrance, complete with iconic arch, will be retained ensuring Perth Theatre's presence on the busy shopping street remains and offering shoppers a direct route into the building.

Richard Murphy Architects, UK were appointed architects for the project in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.e-architect.co.uk/scotland/perth-theatre|title=Perth Theatre, Scotland – Building – e-architect|website=e-architect|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Demolition of the theatre's 1980s extension began on 19 April 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/news/local/perth-kinross/140822/milestone-work-begins-perth-theatre/|title=Milestone work begins at Perth Theatre – The Courier|website=The Courier|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable figures==
Throughout its history, a number of star acts performed at Perth Theatre, including a young [[Alec Guinness]], [[Walter Carr (actor)]], [[Edward Woodward]], [[Una McLean]] and [[Donald Sutherland]]. More recently [[Crieff]]’s own [[Ewan McGregor]] began his acting career at the theatre – McGregor is also Project Ambassador of Transform Perth Theatre.

==Perth Youth Theatre==
Established in 1966 by Brian Howard and Catherine Robins, Perth Youth Theatre was the first theatre-based youth theatre group in Scotland. Perth Youth Theatre has trained young people in acting and stage craft for 50 years. Perth Youth Theatre Alumni included [[Rhod Sharp]], [[Stuart Cosgrove]], [[Ewan McGregor]], [[Colin McCredie]] and [[Sally Reid]]

''"What happened to us there – boys and girls – was profound, and often profoundly funny. In the children's show, the name of which I cannot remember, I played my first custard pie scene with [[Stuart Cosgrove]]. It used a lot shaving foam and Stuart usually came off better. We didn't know who we would become, but few of us had doubts that we would become something." [[Rhod Sharp|Rhod Sharp, 2015]]''

Taltavull owned the Star Saloon located in [[Washington, D.C.]], next door to [[Ford's Theatre]]. Lincoln's assassin, [[John Wilkes Booth]], stopped at Taltavull's saloon just before entering the theater and shooting [[Abraham Lincoln|the President]].  The Star Saloon was briefly considered as a place to bring the wounded Lincoln before the  decision was made to take him to [[Ford's Theatre#Petersen House|William Petersen's boarding house]].

On May 15, 1865, Taltavull testified for the prosecution during the conspiracy trial, and stated that he had been acquainted with the defendant, [[David Herold]], as far back as Herold's boyhood.  Taltavull also testified that he had served Booth a drink of whiskey and water shortly before the assassination.

For over twenty-five years Taltavull had been a [[French horn]] player with the [[United States Marine Band|Marine Band]].

Taltavull died on April 8, 1881 and is buried at [[Congressional Cemetery]].

'''Rock in Rio''' is a recurring music festival originating in [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil. It later branched into other locations such as [[Lisbon]], [[Madrid]] and [[Las Vegas]].

Seven incarnations of the festival have been held in Rio de Janeiro, in 1985, 1991, 2001, 2011, 2013, 2015, and 2017, eight in [[Lisbon]], in 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016 and 2018, three in Madrid in 2008, 2010 and 2012, and one in Las Vegas, in 2015. Brazilian entrepreneur and advertiser Roberto Medina was responsible for the inception and organization of the festival, as well as moving the 2004 edition to [[Lisbon]], while controversially keeping the brand "Rock in Rio".&lt;ref name=rir13&gt;{{cite web|url=http://riotimesonline.com/brazil-news/rio-business/roberto-medina-the-business-of-rock/ |title=Roberta Medina: The Business of Rock in Rio &amp;#124; The Rio Times &amp;#124; Brazil News |publisher=Riotimesonline.com |date=2013-08-20 |accessdate=2014-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Rock in Rio returned to its original location, Rio de Janeiro, with a new line-up of singers and groups.

Rock in Rio is one of the largest music festivals in the world, with 1.5 million people attending the first event, 700,000 attending the second and fourth, about 1.2 million attending the third, and about 350,000 people attending each of the three Lisbon events.

===Rock in Rio===
[[File:Queenland 198501.jpg|thumb|right|Queen performing in 1985.]]
The first edition of the festival was held from January 11–20, 1985. [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[George Benson]], [[Rod Stewart]], [[AC/DC]], and [[Yes (band)|Yes]] were the headliners, each occupying top spot for two nights (Benson, however, ceded it to [[James Taylor]] for their second night in the same bill, due to the huge delay Taylor's extended performance had caused to his concert two days before). About 1.4 million people attended the 10-day-long festival.

'''Rock in Rio in numbers'''

* The [[City of Rock]], which was built for the festival, covered an area of 250,000&amp;nbsp;m² (around 2.7 million square feet)
* 1,600,000 litres of beverages were served, using 4 million plastic cups.
* 900,000 hamburgers.
* 500,000 pizza slices.
* [[McDonald's]] sold 58,000 hamburgers in a single day, which was a [[Guinness World Record]] until the fourth edition in 2011, where 79,000 hamburgers were sold by [[Bob's]].&lt;ref name=rir4&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.jb.com.br/rock-in-rio-2011/noticias/2011/10/04/rock-in-rio-divulga-balanco-geral-de-mega-evento/ |title=Jornal do Brasil – Rock in Rio 2011 – Rock in Rio divulga balanço geral de mega evento |publisher=Jb.com.br |date= |accessdate=2014-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Both [[Queen (band)|Queen]] shows were filmed (on January 11 and January 18) and broadcast throughout Brazil by [[Rede Globo|Globo]]. Each show was watched by nearly 200 million people in over 60 countries and in front of 350,000–500,000 people for each night setting a world record for the biggest paying audience ever at the time. It was later broadcast in the United States on [[MTV]] as "''Queen: Live in Rio''".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.queenarchives.com/index.php?title=Queen_-_02-15-1986_-_Boston_Globe_-_Rock_in_Rio Queen: Rock in Rio] ''[[Boston Globe]]''. Retrieved June 2, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Iron Maiden]] was the only non-Brazilian act to play just one concert at the festival (on its opening night, headlined by [[Queen (band)|Queen]]), due to other bookings, while every other international act performed twice. During the song "Revelations", lead singer [[Bruce Dickinson]] hit himself accidentally with a guitar and cut his eyebrow. Dickinson continued to sing in spite of heavy bleeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2G5o78lGQU|title=Iron Maiden – Revelations|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=2 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They performed in front of a crowd of 350,000 people.
* [[The Go-Go's]] broke up after their two Rock in Rio performances, (headlined by [[Queen (band)|Queen]] and [[Rod Stewart]]) though they would later reunite in the 1990s. The two Rock in Rio shows were the debut and swansong for short-tenured Go-Go's member Paula Jean Brown, who had replaced [[Jane Wiedlin]]. (Wiedlin would return to the reunited 1990s lineup.)
* [[Chris Frantz]] and [[Tina Weymouth]], at the time [[Talking Heads]] drummer and bass player, respectively, took part at [[the B-52's]] concerts. They joined the band from the third song on and played along with them for the remainder of the performance.
* The January 20 appearance of the B-52's would turn out to be their last with guitarist [[Ricky Wilson (American musician)|Ricky Wilson]], who died from [[AIDS]] in October of that year as the band was finishing [[Bouncing Off the Satellites|their next album]].
* Initially, [[Def Leppard]] was scheduled to play at the festival. However, they dropped out about two months before the event, due to delays on the recording process of the album ''[[Hysteria (Def Leppard album)|Hysteria]]''. Eleven days before the date Def Leppard would have played at the festival, drummer [[Rick Allen (drummer)|Rick Allen]] suffered an accident that cost him his left arm. They were replaced by [[Whitesnake]].

===Rock in Rio 2===
The second edition was held from January 18–27, 1991 at the [[Estádio do Maracanã|Maracanã]] stadium. Headliners were [[Guns N' Roses]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] and [[George Michael]], each being top billed for two of the event's nine nights. [[INXS]], [[New Kids on the Block]] and [[A-ha]] also got top billing, for one night each.

[[Guns N' Roses]]'s January 20 concert was their first ever with then new drummer [[Matt Sorum]] and keyboard player [[Dizzy Reed]]. [[George Michael]]'s second concert, on January 27, the festival's closing day, featured his ex-[[Wham!]] partner [[Andrew Ridgeley]], who joined Michael for a few songs at the encore. Again a misplaced Brazilian act suffered from bad reception, with [[Lobão]] being pelted with beer cans and being forced to cut his performance short.

===Rock in Rio 3===

The third ''Rock in Rio'' festival took place in 2001. Its seven nights were headlined, respectively, by [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[R.E.M.]], [[Guns N' Roses]], [['N Sync]], [[Iron Maiden]], [[Neil Young]] and the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]].

[[Iron Maiden]] released their set as ''[[Rock in Rio (album)|Rock in Rio]]''. Profits from the sale of the album were donated to the [[Clive Burr]] fund, helping their former drummer pay mounting medical bills for his [[multiple sclerosis]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

A notable appearance at ''Rock in Rio 3'' was that of [[United States of America|American]] hard rock band [[Guns N' Roses]], with a new line-up featuring guitarist [[Buckethead]], original member and singer [[Axl Rose]] (vocals), and longtime member [[Dizzy Reed]] (keyboards). "I have no intention, and I never did, of denying you all something you enjoyed," Rose told the audience. "And I thought it was only fair for you to see that this new band can play the fuck out of these songs. It's very hard to ask a musician to learn to play the part or parts played by other musicians before that. These guys here have worked very hard."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Jon|last=[[Jon Hotten|Hotten]]|title=Mad bad and dangerous to know?|magazine=[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]] #36|date=January 2002|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carlinhos Brown]], the opening act on the day Guns N' Roses performed, was attacked by water bottles throughout his performance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cliquemusic.uol.com.br/materias/ver/rock-in-rio-carlinhos-brown-undergoes-the-first-scandal-in-the-festival Rock in Rio: Carlinhos Brown undergoes the first scandal in the festival]&lt;/ref&gt; Bassist [[Nick Oliveri]] of [[Queens of the Stone Age]] performed nude for part of their set and was arrested for indecent exposure after the concert, being released soon after.

[[File:Rock Street Rock in Rio 4.JPG|thumb|The Rock Street at the Rock in Rio 4]]
The fourth edition of Rock in Rio, back to its origins, was held on September 23, 24, 25, 29 and 30, and October 1 and 2, 2011, at an area ([[:pt:Parque Olímpico Cidade do Rock|pt]]) to be built next to the old [[City of Rock]] – which is currently the site of the [[Olympic Village]] of the [[2016 Summer Olympics]].

Three different stages were employed, with the headlining concerts at the Palco Mundo (World Stage), the secondary ones in Palco Sunset (Sunset Stage), and DJs playing at a specialized stage for electronic music. The closing acts, [[Guns N' Roses]] and [[System of a Down]], entered following a poll on the festival's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://musica.uol.com.br/ultnot/2011/05/06/escolhido-por-voto-popular-system-of-a-down-entra-na-programacao-do-rock-in-rio-2011.jhtm |title=Escolhido por voto popular, System of a Down entra na programação do Rock In Rio 2011 – 06/05/2011 – UOL Música – Da Redação |publisher=Musica.uol.com.br |date= |accessdate=2014-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maroon 5]] was a last hour addition, following [[Jay-Z]] leaving for personal reasons.

===Rock in Rio Lisboa===
After the huge success of Rock in Rio 3 in Brazil, Roberta Medina decided to organize a festival of the same stature in Lisbon. The decision to maintain the name Rock in Rio was controversial, and detractors of the idea in Brazil started calling it ''Rock in Rio Tejo'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetanews.com/news/2004/10217 |title=Coluna Ialdo Belo |publisher=Planetanews.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://peixenarede.blogspot.com/2006/03/rock-in-rio-s-se-for-rio-tejo.html |title=::Peixe na rede: Rock in Rio? Só se for Rio Tejo:: |publisher=Peixenarede.blogspot.com |date=1999-02-22 |accessdate=2014-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; after the [[Tagus]] river (rio Tejo, in Portuguese) which runs through the Portuguese capital.

The first edition of Rock in Rio Lisboa, as the festival was officially called, took place in 2004. Although the festival had a slight change of name, it kept the same structure as the Brazilian editions. An entire ''City of Rock'', with an area of over 260,000 audience was erected at the [[Parque Bela Vista|Bela Vista park]], with a large centre stage and several tents where different artists would perform, simultaneously.

'''Stompin 76 Music Festival''' was known as "the greatest [[Bluegrass music|Bluegrass]] festival in history".{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} The 3 day camp-out music took place Friday through Sunday, August 6, 7 and 8 in [[1976 in music|1976]], eight miles north of [[Galax, VA]] at the New River Jam Site owned by the Lawson family. Not associated with the performer Doyle Lawson. 1976 was the year of the US Bicentennial and young people were looking for a party. That summer the big concert tour staged in large arenas and stadiums was Elton John and Dave Mason. Stompin 76 was promoted at these concerts from Boston to Miami. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stompin76.com/ Stompin 76 Music Festival Official Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Over 100,000 attended Stompin' 76; including many who were clogged on Carroll County, VA area roads. Others parked on the interstate and walked up to 11 miles to reach the epic event from Interstate 77. This one great music festival would come to be known as "The [[Woodstock Festival|Woodstock]] Of Bluegrass".

For three days in the summer of the American Bicentennial, 90 miles west of [[Roanoke, Virginia]], just a stone's throw from the [[North Carolina]] border, bluegrass and blues abounded. Outdoor music festival lovers from all parts of the eastern US gathered for that historic weekend. Helicopters and motorcycles were used to get performers and supplies in and out of the rural site located next to the New River in Southwest Virginia.

Appearing on one stage: [[Bonnie Raitt]], [[Earl Scruggs]], [[Nashville Grass|Lester Flatt &amp; Nashville Grass]], [[Vassar Clements]], [[Ry Cooder]], [[John Hartford]], [[Osborne Brothers]], [[The Rowans]], [[John Prine]], [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]], [[Doc Watson|Doc]] &amp; [[Merle Watson]], [[The Dillards]], [[Hickory Wind]], [[New Grass Revival]], [[Red, White and Bluegrass]], [[Nashville Bluegrass Band]], [[Papa John Creach]], [[David Bromberg]], [[Star Spangled Washboard Band]], [[Eric Weissberg|Eric Weissberg and Deliverance]], [[Grass On The Rocks]], Good Ol' Boys, [[Joe and Bing]].

Three days of fun and music, all for only $12.00 advance/ $15.00 at the gate! As a result of the disturbance the event created in this rural community, the county instituted laws to control outdoor music festivals. The popularity of Stompin 76 is a contributing factor to the growth of the Galax Fiddler's Convention in the late 1970s.

Promoter Hal Davidson, a Maryland native, was a mere 20 years old at the time. He established a concert company in Las Vegas the year before, Cactus Productions, Inc., which was the name of the company behind Stompin 76. Hal conceived the idea for a large music festival in mid-February 1976 at his roommate's Reisterstown, MD apartment. Davidson had tired of promoting small venue concerts such as Thin Lizzy, Golden Earring, Spirit, Niles Lofgren, Leslie West, Natalie Cole, Chick Corea and a slew of now classic concerts, in 1975 at U of Maryland Baltimore County, Painter's Mill Music Fair and the Lyric Theater in Baltimore.

In 2010 Davidson said the 2,500-4,000 seat venues multiplied times the anemic $5.50-$7.50 going ticket price at the time, made those concerts fun but not necessarily profitable. He felt a major rock festival was needed. When he found out the cost of major rock acts, he decided on bluegrass with a touch of blues. It would be 3 days, there would be camping and 22 great bands. Stompin 76 was born.

With a Baltimore staff about his same age, Hal Davidson rented a Beechcraft Baron 6 seat airplane, an ex-Vietnam pilot and started promoted the event intensely throughout 20 states March 1, 1976. The huge attendance is attributed to the massive marketing, great line-up and a special summer, being the bicentennial year.

An unrelenting 21-week marketing campaign included dozens of eastern US radio stations, ''Rolling Stone''/ ''Village Voice'' ads, newspaper ads, articles, aerial banners over major beaches and pervasive flyer/ poster campaigns at concerts made this was one of the original organized festival street teams. The posters said "Super Sound in Our Natural Amphitheater and Free Camping and Parking On Hundreds of Wooded Acres". Tens of thousands of red, white and blue long lasting vinyl bumper stickers were distributed through street teams and mailed back with each ticket order. The great majority of 30,000 or so tickets sold were purchased through mail order. Ticketron, the predecessor of TicketMaster was not in operation until July, 1976, though tickets were available at approx. 25 ticket outlets including Kemp Mill Records in MD, National Record Mart in PA, WV and VA, Strawberry's in Boston and Globe Records in OH and many independent records stores in NC, VA and MD.
The great majority of attendees entered for free. Hal Davidson blames CES, the Baltimore based security company which said to him at the event they wanted an additional $30,000 to secure the perimeter that they "were not hired to do that". The promoter told them the damage was already done and he wasn't paying them any more than he had. Appalled and stunned, he never spoke to them again.

In 1998 an attendee from New Castle, VA named Pete said: "The strongest memories are the musical ones. Bonnie Raitt doing a searing 'Love Me Like A Man'. The Dillards doing a gospel number, their acapella voices drifting through the Virginia countryside. These memories will stay in my soul forever."

In 2006, writing into the Stompin76 web site, Turtle said: "15 yrs old at the time. Traveled down from PA in a four vehicle caravan. Couldn't get any closer than a few miles from the music. Hiked to the music, when I came back my people moved camp. Didn't see them for 3 days. Run ins with Pagans bikers, Moonshine vendors, young ladies of questionable morals and flash floods. What a BIG time for a teenager."

Hal Davidson is now a concert and festival consultant residing in Maryland. He has planned and produces major festivals for clients in many states and in Australia, Cyprus and Canada. 2006 was the 30th anniversary of this event. Davidson has also authored comprehensive promoting manuals available on his websites. His main websites are concert-promotions.com, rentapromoter.com. Hal stays in touch with Stompin fans and sells Stompin 76 tee shirts at the event's Official web site, &lt;www.stompin76.com&gt;. Many attendees and their decedents still talk about wild experiences and forging close relationships lasting a lifetime at the web site. "Bluegrass music did it!" said Davidson in 2010.

In 2013 there was discussion with members of the Hillsville, Virginia community about another Stompin, and though Hal said "it was unlikely a 40th Anniversary festival would take place in 2016", it looks like the town of Hillsville will get their bluegrass festival after all. Headlining for [[HillFest]] 2016" are [[The Church Sisters]], [[Hackensaw Boys]] and [[Fake Flowers Real Dirt]]. &lt;ref&gt;[http://culturefly.org/calendar/event/11050/fake-flowers-real-dirt-hackensaw-boys-live-hillfest-2016 Fake Flowers Real Dirt &amp; Hackensaw Boys "LIVE" at HillFest 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''summer camp''' or '''sleepaway camp'''&lt;!--This name is a redirect to this article--&gt; is a supervised program for [[child]]ren or [[adolescence|teenagers]] conducted during the [[summer]] [[months]] in some countries. Children and adolescents who attend summer camp are known as ''campers''. Summer school is usually a required academic curriculum for a student to make up work not accomplished during the academic year, whereas summer camps can include academic work, but is not a requirement for graduation.

The traditional view of a summer camp as a woody place with [[hiking]], [[canoeing]], and [[campfire]]s is changing, with greater acceptance of newer types summer camps that offer a wide variety of specialized activities. For example, there are camps for the [[performing arts]], [[music]], [[magic (illusion)|magic]], [[computer programming]], language learning, mathematics, children with [[disability|special needs]], and [[Dieting|weight loss]]. In 2006, the American Camp Association reported that 75 percent of camps added new programs. This is largely to counter a trend in decreasing enrollment in summer camps, which some argue to have been brought about by smaller family sizes and the growth in supplemental educational programs. There are also religiously affiliated summer camps, such as those run by [[Christian]] groups and various denominations of [[Judaism]].

The primary purpose of many camps is educational, athletic, or cultural development. A summer camp environment may allow children to learn new skills in a safe and nurturing environment. Summer camp experience can have lasting psychological impact on the development of a child.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Health|first=Council on School|date=2011-04-01|title=Creating Healthy Camp Experiences|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/127/4/794|journal=Pediatrics|language=en|volume=127|issue=4|pages=794–799|doi=10.1542/peds.2011-0267|issn=0031-4005|pmid=21444589}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
[[File:BAN20.JPG|thumb|left|A group of summer camp attendees make music with [[tambourine]]s.]]

In most camps, the young adult or teenage supervisors are called counselors or "cabin leaders". In many camps, counselors are assigned to small groups of campers, called "bunks", "huts", "cabins", or "units", who participate in activities as a group, such as campfires, hiking, canoeing, swimming, nature lore, arts and crafts. Counselors often share living accommodations with their group.

In the United States counselors for residential camps are typically drawn from older teens and college-aged adults (early 20s) because of the temporary, seasonal and low-paying aspects of the work. International staff are often hired alongside their American counterparts through agencies who vet the staff beforehand. Overall camp supervision is typically done by older camp directors, who lead a team that includes cooks, sports instructors, a nurse, maintenance personnel and counselors. The director and the maintenance personnel have a longer-term affiliation with the summer camp. Professional camp staff organize preparation of facilities and supplies for the camp season and supervise the maintenance of the camp during the off-season. Camp directors conduct the hiring of seasonal counselors, instructors, and support staff, often during job fairs held on campuses or on online job boards &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://adventurejobboard.com|title=Adventure Job Board|website=adventurejobboard.com|accessdate=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://outdoored.com|title=OutdoorEd|website=OutdoorED.com|accessdate=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

At some camps, all campers stay overnight in cabins and eat all their meals in a [[cafeteria]]. At some camps, also known as [[day camp]]s, the campers go home each night. Some other camps allow both day and overnight campers. In the USA, residential camps that have overnight facilities are sometimes called "sleepaway camps".{{cn|date=April 2018}} Summer camp is often the first time that children spend an extended period of time away from home.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

The practice of running residential holidays for children away from their own home seems to have originated in Appenzell in the Alps in 1876, when Pastor Bion set up holiday camps in which children made tree-houses, sang songs, did drama, made kites and had adventure games. Post-war France used Pastor Bion’s model to take children who had grown up during the war years, away from cities, and their scheme ‘colonies de vacances’ became state controlled, part of their state education system for all children.The American camps developed from a very different cultural root.

==Educational camps==
[[Image:Class in bed making.jpg|thumb|Young girls learning how to make a bed at a "vacation school" in the late 1890s, what in modern terminology would probably be a summer camp.]]

In the United States there are numerous models of camp with an educational focus that cater to students with differing ages and academic interest.

===College credit courses===
Some camps offer students the opportunity to explore a pre-college experience. Typically, students entering grades 10 through 12 stay in the college dormitories and attend summer classes run by college faculty. At the successful completion of a summer program, course credits are awarded, which in turn are accepted by most tertiary institutions. Typically, colleges in the United States and Canada offer these programs, as it serves as an introduction to students to entice them to attend the college as full-time students based upon a memorable summer experience.

''[[Starbase]] Kelly'', sponsored by the [[433d Airlift Wing|433red Airlift Wing]] of the [[U.S. Air Force]], is a five-day camp focused on providing [[Fourth grade|fourth]], [[Fifth grade|fifth]] and [[Sixth grade|sixth-graders]] with education on math, science and technology during the summer.]]

===Non-college credit courses===
Some camps, such as [[CTY]] and Duke TIP, are focused primarily on education or on educational-related activities, such as [[debate]], [[history]], or [[journalism]]. These camps are often run by colleges or universities, and are usually for children in junior or senior high school. Instruction in debate and speech is also available for middle school students and incoming high school students all over the country. Educational summer camps are different from [[summer school]]s as the summer camps often are not offered for school credit, and often have a significant focus on non-academic activities. Students for these programs are often invited or recruited.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} Many of these camps, such as [[Canada/USA Mathcamp]] and [[Summer Science Program|SSP]], focus on a specific subject, such as mathematics or astronomy. These camps tend to have selective application processes involving [[problem solving]] or an [[essay]] about the applicant's interest in the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mathcamp.org/quiz.php |title=Mathcamp 2009 Qualifying Quiz |accessdate=December 9, 2008 |publisher=Canada/USA Mathcamp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic adventure camps===
These provide high school students with the opportunity to study an academic topics on a summer adventure travel program, typically in the wilderness or a foreign country. Many include community service as a component of the course. Others also offer college credit with the successful completion of the program.

===SAT preparation courses===
Various camp programs offer preparation for the [[SAT Reasoning Test]] as part of a mixture of academic learning with summer fun. Often the SAT preparation is offered as a full morning immersion while the afternoons and evenings are geared towards homework and recreational activities. These camp programs often outsource their SAT component from test preparation companies like [[The Princeton Review]] or [[Kaplan, Inc.|Kaplan]] who provide the teachers and resources.

===Enrichment courses===
These programs offer a wide range of classes that may have little or no scholastic overlap, but are taught with the purpose of broadening the student's conception and interest in many otherwise unknown areas of study. Students typically explore subjects like photography, community service, drama, magic, scuba diving, video production, comic book design, crime scene forensics, cooking, yoga, and similar areas.

===Science and nature===
Summer camps provide an amazing opportunity for children to learn hands on. Camps provide opportunities that are unlike school, often opening the natural world to children that may never be outside. They can use the natural surroundings and get children back to nature.  More and more child psychologists says that kids need to be spending time unstructured and outside.

==== Canada ====

Some well known summer camps focusing on science and nature in Canada include [[Deep River Science Academy]], [[Shad Valley]], numerous university sponsored and hosted day camps including the [[University of Toronto]]'s Science Outreach, [[Cosmodome|Space Camp Canada]] and the now defunct Algonquin Space Campus hosted at the [[Algonquin Radio Observatory]].  Safari Science is another camp which is located in Oakville Ontario and provides campers an adventure in learning about their world.

===Tech camps===
[[File:07232012Verano robotica09.jpg|thumb|Participants at a robotics camp for children at [[Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education, Mexico City]].]]
[[Tech camp]]s focus on technology education. These summer camps develop 21st century skills in areas such as game design, 3D game creation, web design, graphic design, robot building, and programming languages. These summer camps are typically held on college campuses. Many universities now offer technology-focused camps in the summer as a way of reaching future students, generating revenue and providing community service outreach.

===Language and foreign culture camps===
{{see|Language immersion|Explore (education)|English Village}}
To meet a growing demand for language education, language camps have developed around the United States.  Many of these summer programs are hosted by high schools.  Colleges and universities have also created camps using their facilities to host younger students.  Foreign countries have established summer schools in the United States to offer education regarding their culture and language.  The growing popularity of summer language camps may be related to a growing interest in languages not typically offered in United States high school curricula.  Arabic, Mandarin Chinese, and Korean are examples of languages in-demand that do not often appear in a curriculum.

==Art and performing art camps==
Other camps have become summer training grounds for a variety of arts. Many offer elective classes in a range of creative and performing arts activities including visual arts, music, theater, speech, debate, dance, circus arts, rock and roll, magic and other specialties. Some of these programs have a narrow focus in one particular area, while others offer a wide range of programs. Due to the popularity of these activities, many traditional camps have added some elements of the visual and performing arts into their programs as well. Some camps offer very high level instruction and performance opportunities; this is such that campers with previous experience and skill may be able to perform a solo in front of a symphony orchestra or create an artistic piece on their own. Most art and performing art summer camps also cater to beginners, offering children the opportunity to try a new art or learn a new skill.

Oftentimes camps will have various totems or traditions that pass from one group of campers to the next, with each group adding something that denotes their time at the camp, often like a time capsule. Painted totems, wood carving, and show programs often accumulate as a sacred object that passes from one group to the next. Cheer camps have popularized the concept of a spirit stick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ginsberg|first=Kenneth|title=Building Resilience in Children and Teens: Giving Kids Roots and Wings|year=2011|publisher=American Academy of Pediatrics|isbn=1581105517|pages=285–289}}&lt;/ref&gt; Performing art camps often run 3 or 4 week sessions that culminate in some sort of performance that parents and families attend.

==Travel camps==
Many camps also bring children of all ages around the world. Some camps are often called "Adventure Camps", often having a very specific theme. Many of these programs emphasize skill development and personal growth through the adventures offered.

==Sports camps==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2012}}
Summer camps can be found that offer intensive instruction in almost any sport imaginable, or that offer quality instruction and competition in a wide range of sports. Camps are split into groups of day camps and overnight camps. In the United States overnight sports camps fall into two groups. The more traditional of these offer boys and girls the chance to learn and play many sports. Sessions are typically 3 to 8 weeks long, and some camps have multiple sessions. While many strong athletes attend these camps, a traditional sports camp program also serves the needs of less proficient athletes by having all campers compete on teams picked by ability, so all kids get a chance to contribute to their team's success in their daily competitions. Some of these camps have been operating for more than 100 years. These camps generally focus, through the medium of team sports, on the development of the whole child; not just how they are as an athlete, but also how they are as a person, a bunkmate, a teammate, and a friend. Many of these camps include a variety of non-sports programs as well for a more diverse experience.

Many sports camps are of the second type, which focuses almost exclusively on one particular sport. These camps generally focus on helping each camper acquire skills in a sport that help them gain confidence and improve their chances of making the team when they return to school. Indeed, some campers are helped to be nationally competitive by way of this kind of intensive summer training. These camps generally run week-long sessions, and some campers may attend more than one session even though the curriculum repeats each week. Some single-sport camps offer longer sessions. Many of the instructors at these camps are coaches of local teams, and thus many athletes get valuable extra time with the coach they play for during the school year (or the coach they hope to play for during the upcoming school year). Such camps are also a good way to learn about potential college scholarships in their sport.

Both multi-sport and single-sport camps tend to be run by experienced teachers and coaches (who typically have summers off from their school responsibilities). Cabin staff, instructors, and counselors are typically college athletes. The best sports camps succeed at challenging aspiring athletes both mentally and physically, while also promoting their social and leadership skills. This is possible in part because many of the counselors attended as campers, and thus there is a vibrant "camp culture" that welcomes new campers into an extended camp family and establishes the high standards that incoming campers are encouraged to achieve. The best sports camps do much more than just improve a camper's soccer, tennis, lacrosse, or wrestling skills; they help each child become a more skillful athlete, a more gracious competitor, a more committed team player, and a more confident person.

==Weight loss camps==
{{Main|Fat camp}}
Weight loss or "fat" camps are for overweight children, teens, and adults to learn about losing weight and keep it off while having a summer camp experience.

== Emotional education camp ==
These kind of camps, are a new way to increase the [[emotional intelligence]] of the children. There are some examples of these camps, around the world, for example Rumbendëll emotional camp,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rumbos.org/campamentos-de-verano-sevilla/|title=Campamentos de Verano en Sevilla. - Rumbos crecimiento personal, educación emocional, terapia familiar, adolescencia y de pareja, coaching Sevilla.|date=22 April 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; based in [[Seville]], Spain.

==Around the world==
&lt;!-- New sections should be added in alphabetical order --&gt;

===Australia===
Summer camps are largely non-existent in Australia, because the Australian summer break (known as the Christmas holidays) only lasts between six and eight weeks, and occurs over Christmas and the New Year, shorter than in North America. Most children participate in School-camps, Girl Guide/scout camps, or school holiday camps with some religious groups (Such as the Salvation Army and Seventh-Day Adventists) holding week-long Summer Camps. Girl Guides and Scouts offer 'jamborees' which are camps over 1 to 2 weeks.  Multiple-week camps are next to unheard of.

Many of Australia's youth music organisations hold annual rehearsal camps in summer including the Australian Youth Orchestra's National Music Camp and Gondwana Choirs Gondwana National Choral School. Other than the Seventh-Day Adventist Summer Camps, most holiday camps are referred to as "Adventure Camps", because they largely do not occur over summer. Many groups hold holiday day-camps for Primary aged children, and often run week-long adventure camps during the Spring, Autumn and Winter breaks.

Australian Defence Force Cadets often and almost exclusively run their extended camps and courses over school holiday periods, the vast majority of which provide all food and lodging for Cadets over the course of the camp. However, these camps often last only one or two weeks and thus do not fill up the majority of the summer holiday break. This allows the Cadets (who are aged 12–18 years and therefore the majority attend school) to attend the camps whilst still completing normal schooling.

===Canada===
[[File:Children. La Familiale Camp BAnQ P48S1P06393.jpg|thumb|left|Children in a [[Montreal]] summer camp, July 1941]]

In [[Canada]], summer camps are very popular. About 70% of Canadian camps tend to be affiliated with organizations, while the rest are private. There are also many summer camps for ESL students. Summer camp fairs are held throughout Canada, usually during the winter months. Parents and children can meet camp directors and collect information about summer camps. Admission to these fairs is typically free, and the camps on display vary in their cost from completely subsidized fees to quite expensive.

===Chile===
The Chilean [[Inglés Abre Puertas]] (English Opens Doors) program from the [[Ministry of Education (Chile)|Ministry of Education]] runs each January and July English-language Summer and Winter camps, respectively. The camps take place during the students' vacations, and "are designed to give talented Chilean public high school students the chance to practice English in a more hands on way through interactive activities including role-playing exercises, field trips, group projects, and competitive games."

===China===
Most of the summer camps are sponsored by the educational bureau. However, nowadays, there are more privately held camp programs. The traditional camps are only open to the selected students within individual school district. In the recent years, programs have started that are open to kids from different background and different regions. There are also programs tailored for international students who are interested in learning Chinese language and culture.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

===Croatia===
Euroclub English Summer camp in island Solta in Croatia is the largest international English summer Camp on the Adriatic, and the only camp dedicated entirely to youth and children. This private owned facility is situated on the island of Šolta in the heart of Dalmatia for 27 years, since 1991. The club specializes in children and youth tourism and education, with English teachers - native speakers, and members and staff from over 35 countries. Camp California in Croatia is another international summer camp on the Adriatic. It is located in the small coastal village of Pakoštane, just 30 minutes from Zadar and 2 hours from Split. It has been in operation since 2003 It is an English language based camp and boasts staff members from all over the world.

===Cyprus===
In [[Cyprus]] summer camps are widely used for children. They usually are situated in the Troodos Mountains area and more specific around [[Platres]]. The church, government and organised groups provide funds for many children so that they can join a summer camps for free.

===Finland===
Many Finnish [[non-governmental organizations]] arrange summer camps for children in a wide variety of age brackets. Major organizers of summer camps are the scouts, sport teams and the orthodox and evangelic-Lutheran churches. The concept of summer camps arose with the rapid post-WWII [[urbanization]] and [[industrialization]] Finland experienced. The reason behind this was that Finnish pedagogues of that period, influenced by the values of the largely agrarian pre-WWII society, were convinced that an urban lifestyle was harmful for the development of children. The idea behind summer camps was to ensure that children had experiences of the countryside, experiences that would aid in development into a decent citizen.

One Finnish tradition also arose soon after WWII, was confirmation camps. Confirmations camps, religious camps for 13–16 years old youths organized by the local churches, aimed to combine the traditional concept of confirmation school and the newer concept of summer camps in order to battle secularization of the society. The concept was successful enough to such an extent that today, 90% of all youths participate in confirmation camps. The camps require their participants to learn certain religious texts, such as the catechism, and the [[Lord's prayer]]. There are a number of [[Secular coming of age ceremony#Finland|non-religious alternatives]] for confirmation camps, such as the [[Prometheus Camp]], which aim to generate a positive intellectual and social atmosphere for the participants of the camp without religious tuition.

===France===
In [[France]] they are called ''colonie de vacances'' or more recently ''centre de vacances''. According to the French administration,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jeunesse-sports.gouv.fr/jeunesse_2/les-centres-vacances-centres-loisirs_229/presentation-centres-vacances-centres-loisirs_413/presentation-centres-vacances-centres-loisirs_825.html|title=Présentation des séjours de vacances et accueils de loisirs&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|accessdate=16 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; more than 25% of French children attend this kind of "collective holiday" each year.

===Greece===
In [[Greece]] summer camps are widely known for offering organised vacations for children. They offer sports activities, entertainment activities and educational activities. Children 5 – 15 years old can join summer camps and have the opportunity to interact with peers. The Greek government provide funds for many children so that they can join a summer camp, free.

===India===
Summer camps in India are primarily located in the Himalayas in Northern India in the state of Uttarakhand in places like Uroli near Ranikhet, near the Tons river in Purola, near the Ganges in Rishikesh, in Uttarkashi where many peaks like Darba top are located, and in the Shimla region in Himachal Pradesh. In South India summer camps are popular in Coorg in the state of Karnataka and in Yercaud and Anaikkati in the state of Tamil Nadu. Activities in summer camps in India include rock climbing, back packing, mountain biking, white water rafting, trekking, ropes, and wilderness craft. Many pre-schools in India such as Season Camps, G MaX, Gurukul Preschool (Hunar Summer Camp ) AppleKids conduct extensive Summer Camps for Kids of age 2 to 12 years. Adventure activities for kids are also popular at the summer camps for age groups of 7 to 18 years. Summer camps focusing on wildlife conservation are getting popular over the years. Many of these summer camps are also held in and around metros like Bangalore, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata and Pune.

===Ireland===
Summer camps in Ireland were traditionally in the form of Irish colleges in areas that are officially recognised as speaking Irish as the local language, (called Gaeltachts). They are residential Irish language summer courses that give students the opportunity to be totally immersed in the Irish language, usually for periods of three weeks over the summer months. During these courses students attend classes and participate in a variety of different activities games, music, art and sport. These courses not only provide students with the ability to improve their language skills but also have proved to be a vehicle for introducing traditional cultural activities (céilís, Irish traditional music, etc.) to a new generation.

Whilst Irish colleges are still popular, a greater variety of summer camps are now on offer catering for a range of interests. Sports camps covering Gaelic games as well as rugby and soccer have proven very popular. Arts and crafts, cookery, acting, dance and outdoor pursuits are some of the other niche camps available. There is also a growing popularity for technical or computer camps. They cover areas such as web design, video production, desktop publishing etc., reflecting a more modern and diverse Ireland.

===Israel===
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 13091 Kibbutz Yagur - camp games.jpg|thumb|Israeli campers from [[Kibbutz]] [[Yagur]] in the 1950s.]]

The majority of summer camps in Israel are day camps. There are some overnight camps where campers stay for two weeks such as [[Camp Kimama]], which was founded in [[Mikhmoret|Michmoret]], within the youth village of [[Mevo'ot Yam]]. The affiliation of the overnight summer camps is Jewish so they celebrate [[Shabbat]] and other Jewish holidays. The summer camps are international and are meant for Jewish kids and teens from [[Israel]] and countries around the world.

Today, there are summer camps in almost every village and city, most of which are run by the local authority or certain organizations. In addition, there are a lot of church organized camps including many denominations. For example, all evangelical churches (mostly in the Galilee) hold a Vacation Bible School (VBS) which includes many activities for children. One of the overnight camps is called the Potter's Wheel Camp (PWC) which was originally started by Baptist missionaries at the Baptist Village near Petach Tekvah. This camp continues to serve hundreds of children to this day.

===Italy===
In Italy, summer camps take place during the students' vacations (usually between June and August).
The MB International Summer Camp is the first camp in Italy where kids and young adults are able to study the English or the Italian languages in an international context.{{fact|date=December 2017}} Because of the mix of nationalities, both in class and during the afternoon activities, some students find it easier to learn a new language.{{fact|date=December 2017}} MB International Summer Camp is located in Lignano Sabbiadoro, a city 70&amp;nbsp;km north of Venice.

===South Korea===
Summer camps in South Korea are English Immersion camps where the emphasis is on learning through structured lessons, and especially tailored activities to ensure students use the language as much as possible. South Korea is quite unique with its over emphasis on acquiring English speaking skills, and teachers for these 2 to 4 week camps come from all over the English speaking world. Some of the teachers are on vacation from their regular work in South Korea. Others come from their home countries or other countries where they might be working, and are on special visas just for the camps.

Some employ as many Korean staff as there are native English teachers to ensure the cultural and communication gaps are narrowed. A good camp should provide equipment and well researched texts for the different levels of students. To maximize the learning time spent there should be no more than 11 students per class. At some of the camps students sleep at dormitory accommodations, which are monitored all through the night by Korean staff. Other camps are day camps where the majority of students are bused to and from the camp. Teachers spend most of their time with their students. They eat together, play sports together, and supervise them when there are special group activities. Similar camps are also offered in the winter vacation. They are certainly no less popular than the summer camps

===Malaysia===
Summer camps in [[Malaysia]] are not so popular as in other countries. Children &amp; teenagers have fun together by themselves. But now, summer camps are slowly getting attention. The biggest summer camps available are usually for children below 7 years old.

===Russia===
In the [[USSR]], the first summer camps were created shortly after its establishment and were called [[Young Pioneer camp]]s during the Soviet Union's existence. Their number grew throughout the history of the Soviet Union and they numbered more than forty thousand in 1973, with 9,300,000 children attending them during their vacation every year. After the breakup of the USSR, the number of Young Pioneer camps greatly declined. However, many of the major camps still exist. There are 2,726 Residential camps (with 2,000,000 children), and more 40,000 Day camps (3,500,000 children) in Russia (2006). Most of them were united by All-Russian Camp Association "Deti Plus" (Children Plus) in 1994.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

[[File:Kingswood, West Runton, 29 February 2016.JPG|thumb|Kingswood, [[West Runton]], a UK summer camp.]]

Summer camps are not a main part of childhood in the United Kingdom, in the way they are in North America. The UK summer school holiday is shorter - typically 6 weeks for state school pupils. Children are more likely to go on a long (at least 2 weeks) whole family holiday during this period rather than a Camp just for children (UK parents get longer holiday leave from their jobs than US parents facilitating long family summer holidays). The industry body is called the British Activity Holiday Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baha.org.uk/mempages/mems.asp|title=BAHA - The Activity Centre|publisher=|accessdate=16 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Camps in the UK are also generally less specialised than those within the United States and most offer a fairly broad multi-activity programme of adventure activities alongside some fun social elements. This is partly because summer camps in the UK grew as an offshoot of the activity holiday industry and were therefore influenced by their adventure-only outdoor programme. The UK has for the past few decades had a number of organisations that have established themselves more along the traditional model with a very wide range of holiday options as well as themed camps and major event days. Some religious groups, such as the [[Christadelphians]], also run well publicised and attended camps throughout the country. A number of youth organisations, such as the [[The Scout Association|Scout Association]], [[Army Cadet Force]] and [[Air Training Corps]] do often run more specialised summer camps for their membership, though these are not usually open to non-members.

The Council of Colony Holidays for Schoolchildren ran summer camps called "Colonies" from the mid-1960s to the mid-1980s. Colonies were not based on outdoor pursuits or the "action-adventure" model, but were multi-activity holidays designed to appeal to a very wide range of children. This organisation was based on the French model, and was unique in the UK in that the young volunteers who worked directly with the children (known as "Monitors") were prepared for their work in training courses designed and run by the organisation. After Colony Holidays folded in the 1980s, [[Chris Green (charity worker)|Chris Green]], one of their former staff, set up [[ATE Superweeks]] to provide similar holidays. He also campaigns for summer camps to become more widely supported and to help transform children's lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Summer Camps Trust|url=http://www.summercampstrust.org/|work=highlights the benefits that summer camps can have for young people }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Superstars International Series''' was a production-based [[touring car racing]] championship held between 2004 and 2013. It was managed by the "Superstars World of Racing SpA", SWR, a company of FG GROUP with headquarters in Rome&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FG Group|url=http://www.gruppofg.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315170206/http://www.gruppofg.com/|archivedate=2013-03-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sanctioned by the [[Automobile Club d'Italia]] (ACI) and the [[Commissione Sportiva Automobilistica Italiana]] (CSAI).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurosuperstars.com/eng/db.pdf 2009 Superstars Marketing Presentation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419062601/http://www.eurosuperstars.com/eng/db.pdf |date=April 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; FG GROUP, led by [[Maurizio Flammini]], is famous for having promoted the FIM [[World Superbike Championship]] from its beginnings in 1988 until its sale to [[Infront Sports &amp; Media]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Motors TV|url=http://www.motorstv.com/bike/road-racing/wsbk-ssp/01112008/fg-sport-become-infront-motor-sports|title=FG Sport become Infront Motor Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Superstars Series logo.jpg|thumb|Superstars Series logo used from 2010 to 2011]]

After the shutdown of the promoter SWR in late 2013, the competition has been re-branded as '''[[2014 EuroV8 Series|EuroV8 Series]]''' and organized by FG Group and ATT (Associazione Team Top cars). '''SuperTouringSeries''' is going to be performed by ''Pan Asia Racing Enterprise Ltd. (PARE Ltd)'' in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.touringcartimes.com/2014/01/25/new-eurov8-series-to-fill-in-for-superstars-in-2014/|title=New EUROV8 SERIES to fill-in for Superstars in 2014|last=Hudson|first=Neil|work=TouringCarTimes|publisher=Mediaempire Stockholm AB|date=25 January 2014|accessdate=2 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has been cancelled.

The new championship’s identity, partners, teams, sporting regulations and calendar will be unveiled at the Autosport International show in January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.touringcartimes.com/2013/12/04/supertouringseries-to-take-over-from-superstars/|title=SuperTouringSeries to take over from Superstars|last=Hudson|first=Neil|date=4 December 2013|work=TouringCarTimes|publisher=Mediaempire Stockholm AB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The series began in 2004 as '''Trofeo Nazionale Superstars''' (Superstars National Trophy) with a six race schedule, all the events held in Italian tracks. The initial field was made of BMW M5 and Jaguar S-Type models, entered by five teams.

Since 2005 the series earned the '''Campionato Italiano Superstars''' (Italian Superstars Championship) title, and soon became the main tin-top auto racing series of the country, replacing the [[Italian Superturismo Championship]] (folded in 2007).

[[File:Thomas-biagi.JPG|thumb|[[BMW]] racing in the Superstars Series]]
In 2007 the series started to visit circuits in other European countries with the [[FIA]] approved '''International Superstars Series'''. Since then every season awards two different drivers' titles, one for the International Series and one for the Italian Championship. Points are gained for the Italian Championship at each Italian and one European race meeting.

With the 2010 season a new series was added, the '''[[International GTSprint Series]]''' allowing [[Group GT2|GT2]], [[Group GT3|GT3]] and nationally-homologated GTs. Uniquely, however, it has two 25 minute sprint events per weekend rather than the usual two-driver, long-distance runs that are the norm in GT competition.

The 2012 season saw the growth of the series in terms of media and spectators - attracting 33,000 fans to its race at Vallelunga in Rome on October 7, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Omni Corse|title=33,000 a Vallelunga|url=http://www.omnicorse.it/magazine/22193/superstars-ben-33000-spettatori-per-la-tappa-di-vallelunga|publisher=Omni Corse|accessdate=2013-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johan Kristoffersson won the championship in his KMS Audi RS5 after a season long battle with Vitantonio Liuzzi and his CAAL Racing Mercedes AMG C63. Kristoffersson's success in Superstars proved a strong element in advancing his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=SUPERSTARS|title=SUPERSTARSWORLD a perfect fit for young racers|url=http://www.superstarsworld.com/Superstars-Series/News/SUPERSTARSWORLD-a-perfect-fit-for-young-racers.aspx|accessdate=2013-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2013 calendar contains eight races in 6 countries. The series promoters have given the series an umbrella name "The Superstars World of Racing" that reflects its international growth and refers to the entire weekend of events which includes The Superstars International Series, the GT Sprint International Series, local support races and entertainment events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=SUPERSTARS PRESS OFFICE|url=http://www.superstarsworld.com/Superstars-Series/News/SUPERSTARSWORLD-reveals-combined-schedule-for-2013.aspx|title={{-"}}SUPERSTARSWORLD" reveals combined schedule for 2013 SUPERSTARS, GTSPRINT INTERNATIONAL SERIES}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format and Philosophy==
[[File:Steven goldstein audi rs4 pilot colombia.jpg|thumb|Audi RS4 of the Superstars Series]]
Since 2009 the Series has run a two sprint race format. Race 1 to take place Sunday morning and Race 2 to take place Sunday afternoon.

The technical regulations are designed to bring the largest touring cars together in a balanced competition that limits costs, maximizes spectacle and limits driver assistance.  A total of 10 brands will be represented in the 2013 edition: Audi RS5, BMW M3, Cadillac CTS-V, Chevrolet Lumina and Camaro, Chrysler 300C SRT8, Jaguar XF, Lexus ISF, Maserati Quattroporte, Mercedes C63AMG, Porsche Panamera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=SUPERSTARS|first=MARKETING OFFICE|title=2013 Brochure|url=http://www.superstarsworld.com/Resources/2013-SUPERSTARSWORLD-PRESENTATION.aspx|publisher=SWR SpA|accessdate=25 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update inline|date=October 2016}}

'''Telluride Bluegrass Festival''' is an annual music festival in [[Telluride, Colorado]] hosted by Planet Bluegrass. Although traditionally the festival focuses on [[bluegrass music]],&lt;ref&gt;Herbert, Kiran. [http://www.relix.com/reviews/detail/telluride_bluegrass_2014 "Telluride Bluegrass Festival 2014"]. ''Relix'', 3 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; it often features music from a variety of related genres.

==History==
The town of Telluride had for many years held a Fourth of July Celebration which had its roots in the early mining days of Telluride, when miners would come from down from the mountains to party and meet up with old friends and meet some women.  The celebration included a fireworks display operated by the local fire department. In 1972, the Telluride Ski Resort opened, and the Town of Telluride expanded the Celebration and advertised it widely in all the surrounding states. Among the new attendees were many who behaved badly, starting fights and causing damage; in response, the Town decided to call off the celebration for 1973. 

Scott Brown and a small group of friends convinced the Town to let them organized the 1973 event. The traditional rowdy events were replaced with games in the park for children, a picnic and barbeque.  A stage was built at the far end of Town Park, and after a parade and an afternoon of family fun, the Fall Creek Boys, a local bluegrass band, took the stage to entertain the crowd, followed by the traditional fireworks display.&lt;ref&gt;[http://travel.usnews.com/Telluride_CO/Things_To_Do/Telluride_Bluegrass_Festival_62202/ "Telluride Bluegrass Festival "]. ''US News: Travel''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Encouraged by the success of the 1973 celebration, the first Telluride Bluegrass Festival was organized in Telluride in 1974 by John Herndon, J.B. &amp; Helen Matiotti, Kooster McAllister, and Fred Shellman, who played in the Fall Creek Boys. That year the festival attracted approximately 1000 participants. 

The festival became an annual event with attendance capped at 10,000. According to the [[Library of Congress]], the 1980 performance was filmed by [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]] public television and two CDs were made available.

The ownership of the Bluegrass Festival has changed five times since its inception; in 2009 it is owned and run by Craig Ferguson of Planet Bluegrass.&lt;ref name=pop&gt;[http://www.popmatters.com/feature/189043-the-best-bluegrass-of-2014/ "The Best Bluegrass of 2014"].

Although it has been remodeled several times, the stage is still in the original spot, as are the concession stands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ski.curbed.com/2016/5/5/11595190/telluride-town-park-stage-construction-renovation "Iconic Telluride Town Park Stage Gets a Reboot"]. ''Curbed'',  Megan Barber @megcbarber May 5, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Since at least 2013, capacity has been set at 12,000 per day (48,000 total over the four days of the festival).&lt;ref&gt;Slosson, Mary.

''Rolling Stone'',  Kiran Herbert June 22, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the festival was impacted by flooding, but returned to its former condition in 2014.&lt;ref name=pop /&gt;

'''''The Jesus Factor''''' is a 1970 [[conspiracy theory]] [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] novel by [[Edwin Corley]] based on the [[Manhattan Project]] of [[World War II]] and the bombing of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]]. It concerns issues relating to the "[[arms race]]" and the collective guilt of those involved with the bombings.&lt;ref&gt;''The Novels of World War II: An Annotated Bibliography'', Desmond Taylor and Philip E. Hager, Garland, 1993, {{ISBN|0824056841}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its fictional premise is the discovery during the development of [[nuclear weapon]]s that only detonate if stationary in a [[gravitational field]], making their use as air-dropped bombs impossible. In the novel, the nuclear attacks of [[World War II]] are simulated using aeroplane-mounted [[magnesium]] flares and dispersed [[radionuclide]]s, taking advantage of the destruction caused by an [[earthquake]]. An international conspiracy hides this fact in the interest of maintaining [[Nuclear deterrent|nuclear deterrence]].

The story concerns events when this status quo is threatened by one of the original [[Bombardier (air force)|bombardiers]], who discovers the conspiracy while running for US president with a policy of [[nuclear disarmament]].

Plastic [[aerophones]],  like ''corneta'' and similar devices, have been used in [[Brazil]] and other Latin American countries since the 1960s.

These plastic horns have been marketed and available in the United States as "Stadium Horns" since the mid-1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode

The world association football governing body, [[FIFA]], proposed banning vuvuzelas from stadiums, as they were seen as potential weapons for [[Football hooliganism|hooligans]] and could be used in [[ambush marketing]]. Columnist Jon Qwelane described the device as "an instrument from hell".&lt;ref name="jqInstrumentFromHell"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.news24.com/Columnists/Archive/JonQwelane/Ban-the-vuvuzela-20050207|title=Ban the vuvuzela|last=Qwelane|first=Jon|work=News24|publisher=24.com|date=February 7, 2005|location=South Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt; South African football authorities argued that the vuvuzela was part of the South African football experience.&lt;ref&gt;

===2010 FIFA World Cup===

====Marketing====

[[Hyundai]] constructed the world's largest working vuvuzela as part of a marketing campaign for the World Cup. The {{convert|35|m|ft|adj=on}} blue vuvuzela mounted on the [[Foreshore Freeway Bridge]], [[Cape Town]] was intended to be used at the beginning of each match; however, it had not yet sounded a note during the World Cup as its volume was a cause of concern to city authorities.&lt;ref name="SilentGiant"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Hudson|first=Alexandra|title=Giant vuvuzela waits for council go-ahead to toot|url=https://af.reuters.com/article/sportsNews/idAFJOE65H0MC20100618|accessdate=June 19, 2010|agency=Reuters Africa|date=June 18, 2010|publisher=Thomson Reuters Corporate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vuvuzelas raised health and safety concerns. Competitors believed the incessant noise hampered the ability of the players to get their rest, and degraded the quality of team performance.&lt;ref name="bbcponder"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2010/8737455.stm|title=World Cup 2010: Organisers will not ban vuvuzelas|work=BBC Sport|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|date=June 13, 2010|accessdate=June 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;{{Cite news|agency=Agence France-Presse|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5ghUbctrzM88GqP_A_qJZppPbhjVw |title=World Cup organiser mulls vuvuzela ban|publisher=Google|date=June 13, 2010|accessdate=June 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other critics remarked that vuvuzelas disrupted team communication and players' concentration during matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/article454621.ece |title=It is impossible to communicate, it's like being deaf: Messi|work=The Hindu|agency=Deutsche Presse-Agentur|accessdate=June 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rnw.nl/international-justice/bulletin/ronaldo-hits-out-vuvuzelas|title=Ronaldo hits out at vuvuzelas|publisher=Radio Nederland Wereldomroep|agency=Netherlands National News, Agence France-Presse|accessdate=June 13, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100617160420/http://www.rnw.nl/international-justice/bulletin/ronaldo-hits-out-vuvuzelas|archive-date=June 17, 2010|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Demand for earplugs to protect from hearing loss during the World Cup outstripped supply, with many pharmacies out of stock.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessday.co.za/articles/Content.aspx?id=111728 |title=Worried fans right to seek ear plugs, says Phonak|work=BusinessDay|publisher=BDFM Publishers|last=Chilwane|first=Luphert|date=June 11, 2010|accessdate=June 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; One major vuvuzela manufacturer even began selling its own earplugs to spectators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sport24.co.za/Soccer/WorldCup/NationalNews/Vuvuzelas-unplugged-for-some-20100611|title=Vuvuzelas unplugged for some|work=Sport24|publisher=24.com|location=South Africa|date=June 11, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722052239/http://www.sport24.co.za/Soccer/WorldCup/NationalNews/Vuvuzelas-unplugged-for-some-20100611|archivedate=July 22, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Audio filtration====
[[Band-stop filter|Notch filtering]], an audio filtration technique, is proposed to reduce the vuvuzela sound in broadcasts and increase clarity of commentary audio. The vuvuzela produces notes at a frequency of approximately 235&amp;nbsp;Hz and its [[overtone|first partial]] at 465&amp;nbsp;Hz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Silence Vuvuzela Horns in World Cup Broadcasts|url=http://lifehacker.com/5564085/how-to-silence-vuvuzela-horns-with-an-eq-filter|last=Pash|first=Adam|date=June 15, 2010|publisher=Gawker Media|work=Lifehacker|accessdate=June 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this filtration technique affects the clarity of commentary audio.  Proposals of [[adaptive filter]]s by universities and research organisations address this issue by preserving the amplitude and clarity of the commentators' voices and crowd noise.&lt;ref name="qmvuvupr"&gt;{{Cite press release | title = Trumping the trumpets: how audio engineering helps tone down vuvuzela disruption | publisher = Queen Mary University of London | date = June 18, 2010 |work=Centre for Digital Music| url = http://www.qmul.ac.uk/media/news/items/se/30760.html | accessdate = June 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vuvux"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vuvux.com/ |title=Prosoniq VuvuX|publisher=Prosoniq Products Software GmbH|accessdate=June 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stardock.com/labs/devuvuzelator/ |title=The Devuvuzelator|first1=Jeff|last1=Bargmann|last2=University of London|first2=Queen Mary|publisher=Stardock Corporation |accessdate=June 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such filtration techniques have been adopted by some cable television providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Portuguese cable provider offers vuvuzela muting service for World Cup games|url=http://trueslant.com/marceloballve/2010/06/17/portuguese-cable-provider-offers-vuvuzela-muting-service-for-world-cup-games/|date=June 17, 2010|last=Ballve|first=Marcelo|work=True/Slant}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2018 FIFA World Cup ===

The vuvuzelas made a comeback at the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] in Russia, and have been used mainly by [[Iran national football team|Iranian supporters]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/world-cup/world-cup-2018-morocco-vs-iran-highlights-vuvuzela-goals-five-things-learned-score-a8401226.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Much like in 2010, there has been a backlash against the use of vuvuzelas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://inews.co.uk/sport/football/world-cup/vuvuzelas-world-cup-morocco-iran/|title=Vuvuzelas are back at the World Cup and people are fuming|date=June 16, 2018|publisher=inews.co.uk|accessdate=June 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gulfnews.com/sport/football/vuvuzelas-i-hate-them-but-they-are-back-1.2240135|title=Vuvuzelas: I hate them, but they are back|first=Shyam A.

==Health effects and regulation==

===Health concerns===
[[File:Vuvuzelas Warning.jpg|thumb|right|Some vuvuzelas carry a safety warning graphic.]]
A study in 2010 by Dr Ruth McNerney of the [[London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine]], and colleagues, concluded that the spread of diseases by means of vuvuzelas was possible.&lt;ref name="MiaSnyman"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Snyman|first=Mia|title=Study: Vuvuzela could spread colds and flu|publisher=Boston.com|url=http://www.boston.com/sports/soccer/articles/2010/06/10/study_vuvuzela_could_spread_colds_and_flu/|agency=Associated Press |date=June 10, 2010|accessdate=November 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/playbook/2011/05/vuvuzelas-airborne-germs |date=May 24, 2011 |publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired magazine]] |author=Brian Mossop |title=Besides Noise, Vuvuzelas May Spread Airborne Germs}}&lt;/ref&gt; McNerney found tiny droplets at the bottom of a vuvuzela that can carry [[flu]] and [[Common cold|cold germs]] that are small enough to stay suspended in the air for hours, and can enter into the airways of a person's lungs. The vuvuzelas can infect others on a greater scale than coughing or shouting.

The vuvuzelas have the potential to cause [[noise-induced hearing loss]].&lt;ref name="Journal1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Journal2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Journal3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MiaSnyman"/&gt; Prof James Hall III, Dr Dirk Koekemoer, De Wet Swanepoel and colleagues at the [[University of Pretoria]] found that vuvuzelas can have a negative effect when a listener's eardrums are exposed to the instrument's high-intensity sound. The vuvuzelas produce an average sound pressure of 113&amp;nbsp;dB(A) at {{convert|2|m|ft}} from the device opening.&lt;ref name="Journal2"/&gt; The study finds that subjects should not be exposed to more than 15 minutes per day at an intensity of 100&amp;nbsp;dB(A).&lt;ref name="Journal2"/&gt; The study assumes that if a single vuvuzela emits a sound that is dangerously loud to subjects within a 2-metre radius, and numerous vuvuzelas are typically blown together for the duration of a match, it may put spectators at a significant risk of hearing loss.&lt;ref name="Journal2"/&gt;  Hearing loss experts at the U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recommend that exposure at the 113&amp;nbsp;dB(A) level not exceed 45 seconds per day.&lt;ref name=NIOSHvuvuzela&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2010/06/17/vuvuzelas/ |title=CDC/NIOSH Science Blog – Vuvuzelas: What's the Buzz?

===Noise levels and bans===
Concerns about the constant intensities produced by the vuvuzelas during the 2010 FIFA World Cup matches were raised independently by representatives of international football teams, spectators and sports commentators. The noise levels that were demonstrated during the 2010 FIFA World Cup prompted various sporting organisations to ban the vuvuzela at future events and venues, even including future World Cups:

They were also banned at the 2010 [[Baltimore]] [[anime convention]] [[Otakon]],&lt;ref name="Otakon"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.otakon.com/news_article.asp?id=539|title=Vuvuzela ban in effect|first=Arruda|last=Lou|date=July 11, 2010|work=Otakon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; the convention committee declared that any attendee carrying a vuvuzela could have it confiscated from them, and that anyone blowing one could face expulsion from the event.&lt;ref name="Otakon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ANNOta"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2010-07-14/no-vuvuzelas-at-otakon|title=No Vuvuzelas at Otakon|date=July 14, 2010|work=Anime News Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another such action was taken in response to the prevalence of the vuvuzelas at the 2010 [[Anime Expo]] based in Los Angeles, attended by representatives of Otakon who felt the disruption led to discomfort for some of the attendees of Anime Expo which they wished to avoid at the later Baltimore event.&lt;ref name="ANNOta" /&gt;

Nine English [[Premier League]] clubs have banned the device. Five clubs ([[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/vuvuzelas-not-welcome- |title=Vuvuzelas not welcome at Emirates Stadium! |publisher=Arsenal.com |date=July 20, 2010 |accessdate=2010-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]], [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] and [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]) have banned them due to health and safety reasons while [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]], and [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] have barred them because of policy against musical instruments. [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] banned vuvuzelas from [[Old Trafford]] on August 13, 2010. However, two clubs ([[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] and [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]]) have allowed them. {{citation needed|date=September 2010}}

The organisers of the [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012 Olympic Games]] placed a ban on vuvuzelas at the sporting event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/olympics/news/no-frisbees-picnic-hampers-or-vuvuzelas-items-banned-from-the-london-2012-olympics-7936428.html |title= No frisbees, picnic hampers or vuvuzelas: items banned from the London 2012 Olympics |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= July 12, 2012 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate= August 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage in protests==
On July 13, 2010, protesters with vuvuzelas converged on [[BP]]'s London headquarters to protest the company's handling of the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | author = CNN Wire Staff | title = Vuvuzela protest planned at BP HQ | work = CNN.com Breaking News | publisher = CNN | date = July 13, 2010 | url = http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/europe/07/13/uk.bp.vuvuzela.protest/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Wisconsin]], the Anti-[[Scott Walker (politician)|Walker]], pro-[[Labor unions in the United States|union]] [[2011 Wisconsin protests|protesters]] have made extensive use of vuvuzelas. A Madison DJ, Nick Nice, [http://www.thedailypage.com/isthmus/article.php?article=33472 ordered 200] and distributed them to his fellow protesters. The Madison police even issued permits for use of the vuvuzelas ''inside'' the capitol.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

In March 2012, German protesters used vuvuzelas during the official traditional torchlight ceremony, the [[Großer Zapfenstreich]], which bid farewell to [[President of Germany]] [[Christian Wulff]]. Wulff had resigned earlier over corruption allegations, yet he still received the honor of the military ceremony, which left Germany divided. [http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,820452,00.html]

== Usage in music ==
Usage of vuvuzela in art music is limited. One of the few compositions made for it is a baroque-style [[double concerto]] in C major for vuvuzela, [[organ (music)|organ]] (or [[harpsichord]]) and string orchestra, written by [[Timo Kiiskinen]], Professor of Church Music in [[Sibelius Academy]], [[Helsinki]]; organ version of this concerto was premiered on 21st October 2010 at the Organ Hall of Sibelius Academy, and harpsichord version on 19th December 2010 at Pro Puu gallery in Lahti.&lt;ref&gt;https://cris.uniarts.fi/crisyp/disp/_/fi/cr_redir_all/fet/fet/sea?direction=2&amp;id=3477372 (in Finnish)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Barokkiyhtyeen joulukonsertissa soi vuvuzela" [http://www.ess.fi/uutiset/kulttuurijaviihde/2010/12/16/barokkiyhtyeen-joulukonsertissa-soi-vuvuzela]. ''Etelä-Suomen sanomat'' 16.12.2010 (in Finnish)&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternative rock band Catzo Music All-Stars used two vuvuzelas as the basis of its 2010 song "Larissa Riquelme (reprise)".

The '''Washington Jewish Film Festival''' (WJFF), in  [[Washington, D.C.]], is one of the world's oldest and largest Jewish film festivals. Focusing on Jewish and Israeli issues, the festival has shown hundreds of films ranging both in genre and theme and held in the Aaron &amp; Cecile Goldman Theater in the Washington DC Jewish Community Center and other cinemas in Washington and suburban Maryland and Virginia. The festival was founded by [[Aviva Kempner]] in 1989 and has successfully run for over twenty years and is presented by the Washington DCJCC's Morris Cafritz Center for the Arts.

==Mission==
'''Promote the preservation of Jewish culture and a diversity of narratives.''' The Festival provides a forum for films with Jewish themes that most often do not otherwise find a place for public exhibition in the [[Washington, D.C.]] area. Many of the films we screen only have a life on the Festival circuit and in specialty DVD-release meaning that attendees have the opportunity to experience rarely seen films.

'''Encourage Innovation and vitality within Jewish culture.''' The festival highlights films that place Jewish themes in new contexts or challenge long-held assumptions. The WJFF is at the forefront of presenting films that provide a constructive critique of Jewish identity and reconsider major cultural guideposts such as Zionism, the Holocaust and assimilation as well as the place of women, homosexuals and other people of diverse backgrounds and lifestyles in Jewish life and tradition.

'''Expose the widest possible audience to a low-cost, low barrier entry to the Jewish culture.''' Because the Jewish Diaspora has interacted with numerous host cultures over the course of its long history, the Festival seeks out films that examine some aspect of the Jewish experience, which often act as a prism through which to view multiple cultures. The festival is also dedicated to presenting films which will engage a wide audience at the lowest possible cost.

'''Provide a forum for audiences to interact with filmmakers and for filmmakers to receive feedback.''' Filmmakers attending the Festival engage in open and energetic dialogue with the Festival's audience. Through the works-in-progress program for uncompleted projects, the Festival provides new and veteran filmmakers opportunities to screen works-in-progress portions of their films for an audience at a critical point in their creative process.&lt;ref name="mission"&gt;[https://www.wjff.org/about/]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wild animal suffering''' is the [[suffering]] experienced by nonhuman animals in nature through causes such as disease, injury, starvation, natural disasters, and killings by other animals.

There is considerable disagreement around this latter point, as many believe that human intervention in nature would be either unethical, unfeasible, or both.

== Extent of suffering in nature ==

In his [[The Autobiography of Charles Darwin|autobiography]], [[Charles Darwin]] acknowledged that the existence of extensive suffering in nature was fully compatible with the workings of natural selection, yet maintained that [[Reinforcement#Reinforcement|pleasure]] was the main driver of fitness-increasing behavior in organisms.&lt;ref name=Darwin1993 /&gt; Evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] challenged Darwin's claim in his book ''[[River Out of Eden]]'', wherein he argued that wild animal suffering must be extensive due to the interplay of the following evolutionary mechanisms:

* [[Gene-centered view of evolution|Selfish genes]] – genes are wholly indifferent to the well-being of individual organisms as long as DNA is passed on.
	 
* [[Struggle for existence|The struggle for existence]] – competition over limited resources results in the majority of organisms dying before passing on their genes.
	 
* [[Malthusian catastrophe|Malthusian checks]] – even bountiful periods within a given ecosystem eventually lead to overpopulation and subsequent population crashes.
From this, Dawkins concludes that the natural world must necessarily contain enormous amounts of animal suffering as an inevitable consequence of [[Natural selection|Darwinian evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dawkins|first1=Richard|title=River Out of Eden|date=1995|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=0-465-01606-5|chapter=Chapter 4: God's Utility Function}}&lt;/ref&gt; To illustrate this he wrote:[[File:Mouse litter.jpg|thumb|A litter of [[House mouse|mice]] with their mother. The reproduction of mice follows an ''r''-selection strategy, with many offspring, short gestation, less parental care, and a short time until sexual maturity.]]&lt;blockquote&gt;The total amount of suffering per year in the natural world is beyond all decent contemplation. During the minute that it takes me to compose this sentence, thousands of animals are being eaten alive, many others are running for their lives, whimpering with fear, others are slowly being devoured from within by rasping parasites, thousands of all kinds are dying of starvation, thirst, and disease. It must be so. If there ever is a time of plenty, this very fact will automatically lead to an increase in the population until the natural state of starvation and misery is restored.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=River Out of Eden: A Darwinian View of Life|last=Dawkins|first=Richard|publisher=|year=1995|isbn=9781857994056|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Building on this, others have argued that the prevalence of [[r-selection|r-selected animals]] in the wild indicates that the average life of a wild animal is likely to be very short and end in a painful death. According to this view, the average life of a wild animal should thus contain more suffering than happiness, since a painful death would outweigh any short-lived moments of happiness in their short lives.&lt;ref name="Horta2010a"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Horta|first=Oscar|title=Debunking the Idyllic View of Natural Processes: Population Dynamics and Suffering in the Wild|journal=Télos|year=2010|volume=17|issue=1|pages=73–88|url=https://www.academia.edu/2290959/Debunking_the_Idyllic_View_of_Natural_Processes_Population_Dynamics_and_Suffering_in_the_Wild}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sagoff1984" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ng1995"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ng|first=Yew-Kwang|authorlink1=Yew-Kwang Ng|title=Towards Welfare Biology: Evolutionary Economics of Animal Consciousness and Suffering|journal=Biology and Philosophy|year=1995|volume=10|issue=3|pages=255–285|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF00852469|doi=10.1007/BF00852469}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Bambi or Bessie: Are Wild Animals Happier?'' Christie Wilcox argues that wild animals do not appear to be happier than domestic animals, based on findings of wild animals having greater levels of cortisol and elevated stress responses relative to domestic animals. Additionally, unlike domestic animals, animals in the wild do not have some of their needs provided for them by human caretakers.&lt;ref name="Bambi or Bessie"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilcox|first=Christie|title=Bambi or Bessie: Are Wild Animals Happier?|url=http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/2011/04/12/bambi-or-bessie-are-wild-animals-happier/|publisher=Scientific American|accessdate=8 May 2016|date=12 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Welfare economist [[Yew-Kwang Ng]] has written that evolutionary dynamics can lead to animal welfare which is worse than necessary for a given population equilibrium.&lt;ref name="Ng1995" /&gt;

==Philosophical status==

=== History of concern for wild animals ===
In the essay 'On Nature', [[utilitarian]] philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]] wrote about suffering in nature and the normativity of struggling against it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In sober truth, nearly all the things which men are hanged or imprisoned for doing to one another, are nature's every day performances. [...] The phrases which ascribe perfection to the course of nature can only be considered as the exaggerations of poetic or devotional feeling, not intended to stand the test of a sober examination. No one, either religious or irreligious, believes that the hurtful agencies of nature, considered as a whole, promote good purposes, in any other way than by inciting human rational creatures to rise up and struggle against them.
[...] Whatsoever, in nature, gives indication of beneficent design proves this beneficence to be armed only with limited power; and the duty of man is to cooperate with the beneficent powers, not by imitating, but by perpetually striving to amend, the course of nature - and bringing that part of it over which we can exercise control more nearly into conformity with a high standard of justice and goodness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=On Nature |url=https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mill-john-stuart/1874/nature.htm |accessdate=10 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The English writer and naturalist [[Henry Stephens Salt]] wrote an entire chapter on the plight of wild animals, 'The Case of Wild Animals', in his 1894 book [[Animals' Rights: Considered in Relation to Social Progress]]. Salt wrote that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is of the utmost importance to emphasize the fact that, whatever the legal fiction may have been, or may still be, the rights of animals are not morally dependent on the so-called rights of property; it is not to owned animals merely that we must extend our sympathy and protection. [...]
To take advantage of the sufferings of animals, whether wild or tame, for the gratification of sport, or gluttony, or fashion, is quite incompatible with any possible assertion of animals' rights.&lt;ref name="animal-rights-library.com"&gt;{{cite news|title=Animals' Rights: Considered in Relation to Social Progress |url=http://www.animal-rights-library.com/texts-c/salt01.htm |accessdate=5 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Salt argued that humans are justified in killing wild animals in self-defense, but that "[...] we are not justified in unnecessarily killing—still less in torturing—any harmless beings whatsoever." He argues that this applies to insects as well: "We are unable to give life, and therefore ought not to take it away from the meanest insect without sufficient reason.'"&lt;ref name="animal-rights-library.com"/&gt;

In 1991, the environmental philosopher [[Arne Naess (philosopher)|Arne Naess]] critiqued what he termed the "cult of nature" of contemporary and historical attitudes of indifference towards suffering in nature. He argued that we should confront the reality of the wilderness and that we should be prepared to disturb natural processes when feasible to relieve suffering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Naess|first1=Arne|title=Should We Try to Relieve Clear Cases  of Suffering in Nature?|journal=Pan Ecology|date=1991|volume=6|pages=1–5|url=https://www.abolitionist.com/reprogramming/suffering-nature.pdf|accessdate=20 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ecology as intrinsically valuable ===

[[Holmes Rolston III]] argues that only unnatural animal suffering is a morally bad thing and that humans do not have a duty to intervene in natural cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rolston III|first1=Holmes|title=Environmental Ethics: Duties To and Values in the Natural World|date=1988|publisher=Temple University Press|isbn=9780877225010|url=https://www.amazon.com/Environmental-Ethics-Duties-Values-Natural/dp/0877226288|accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He celebrates carnivores in nature because of the significant ecological role they play. Others have argued that the reason that humans have a duty to protect other humans from predation is because humans are part of the cultural world rather than the natural world and so different rules apply to them in these situations.&lt;ref name=Hettinger1994&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hettinger|first=Ned|title=Valuing Predation in Rolston's Environmental Ethics|journal=Environmental Ethics|year=1994|volume=16|issue=1|pages=3–20|doi=10.5840/enviroethics199416138}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Moriarty1997&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moriarty|first=Paul|author2=Mark Woods |title=Hunting ≠ Predation|journal=Environmental Ethics|year=1997|volume=19|issue=4|pages=391–404|doi=10.5840/enviroethics19971945}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue that prey animals are fulfilling their natural function, and thus flourishing, when they are preyed upon or otherwise die, since this allows natural selection to work.&lt;ref name=Aaltola2010 /&gt;

=== Wild animal suffering as a ''reductio ad absurdum'' ===

That people would also be obliged to intervene in nature has been used as a ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'' against the position that animals have rights.&lt;ref name=Simmons2009 /&gt; This is because, if animals such as prey animals did have rights, people would be obliged to intervene in nature to protect them, but this is claimed to be absurd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Benatar|first=David|authorlink1=David Benatar|title=Why the Naïve Argument against Moral Vegetarianism Really is Naïve|journal=Environmental Values|date=February 2001|volume=10|issue=1|pages=103–112|doi=10.3197/096327101129340769|jstor=30301788}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ebert|first=Rainer|title=Innocent Threats and the Moral Problem of Carnivorous Animals|journal=Journal of Applied Philosophy|year=2012|volume=29|issue=2|pages=146–159|doi=10.1111/j.1468-5930.2012.00561.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-5930.2012.00561.x/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; An objection to this argument is that people do not see intervening in the natural world to save other people from predation as absurd and so this could be seen to involve treating non-human animals differently in this situation without justification.&lt;ref name=Horta2010c&gt;{{cite journal|last=Horta|first=Oscar|title= Disvalue in nature and intervention|journal=Pensata Animal|year=2010|volume=34|url=https://www.academia.edu/download/7822811/DisvalueNatureIntervention.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relevance to the theological problem of evil ===
{{Main|Problem of evil#Problem of evil and animal suffering}}

The [[problem of evil]] has been extended beyond human troubles to include the suffering of animals over the course of evolution.&lt;ref name=Creeganp44&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicola Hoggard Creegan|title=Animal Suffering and the Problem of Evil|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xB1pAgAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-993185-9 |pages=44–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interventions to reduce suffering ==

=== Arguments for intervention ===
Some theorists have reflected on whether we should accept the harms that animals suffer in nature or try to do something to mitigate them.&lt;ref name="Horta2010a" /&gt; The moral basis for interventions aimed at reducing wild animal suffering can be rights-based or welfare-based. From a rights-based perspective, if animals have a moral right to life or bodily integrity, intervention may be required to prevent such rights from being violated by other animals.&lt;ref name=Aaltola2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aaltola|first=Elisa|authorlink1=Elisa Aaltola|title=Animal Ethics and the Argument from Absurdity|journal=Environmental Values|date=February 2010|volume=19|issue=1|pages=79–98|doi=10.3197/096327110X485392|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/whp/ev/2010/00000019/00000001/art00006|accessdate=10 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From a welfare-based perspective, a requirement to intervene may arise insofar as it is possible to prevent some of the suffering experienced by wild animals without causing even more suffering.&lt;ref name="Policing Nature" /&gt; Advocates of intervention in nature argue that nonintervention is inconsistent with either of these approaches. Some proposed courses of action include removing predators from wild areas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacAskill|first1=William|last2=MacAskill|first2=Amanda|title=To Truly End Animal Suffering, the Most Ethical Choice is To Kill Wild Predators (Especially Cecil the Lion)|url=http://qz.com/497675/to-truly-end-animal-suffering-the-most-ethical-choice-is-to-kill-all-predators-especially-cecil-the-lion/|publisher=Quartz|accessdate=17 April 2016|date=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grush|first1=Loren|title=Killing off wild predators is a stupid idea|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/10/9308195/killing-off-wild-predators-is-a-stupid-idea|website=The Verge|date=10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; refraining from reintroducing predators,&lt;ref name=Sagoff1984 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Horta2010b&gt;{{cite journal|last=Horta|first=Oscar|title=The Ethics of the Ecology of Fear against the Nonspeciesist Paradigm A Shift in the Aims of Intervention in Nature|journal=[[Between the Species]]|year=2010|volume=13|issue=10|pages=163–187|url=http://digitalcommons.calpoly.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1114&amp;context=bts|doi=10.15368/bts.2010v13n10.10}}&lt;/ref&gt; providing medical care to sick or injured animals,&lt;ref name=Pearce2015/&gt;&lt;ref name="Policing Nature" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reese|first1=Jacy|title=Wild animals endure illness, injury, and starvation.

=== The practicality of intervening in nature ===

A common objection to intervening in nature is that it would be impractical, either because of the amount of work involved, or because the complexity of ecosystems would make it difficult to know whether or not an intervention would be net beneficial on balance.&lt;ref name=McMahan2010&gt;{{cite news|last=McMahan|first=Jeff|title=Predators: A Response|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/28/predators-a-response/?_r=0|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=27 December 2013|date=September 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaron Simmons argues that we should not intervene to save animals in nature because doing so would result in [[unintended consequences]] such as damaging the ecosystem, interfering with human projects, or resulting more animal deaths overall.&lt;ref name=Simmons2009&gt;{{cite journal|last=Simmons|first=Aaron|title=Animals, Predators, The Right to Life and The Duty to Save Lives|journal=Ethics &amp; The Environment|year=2009|volume=14|issue=1|doi=10.2979/ete.2009.14.1.15| pages=15–27|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/een/summary/v014/14.1.simmons.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher [[Peter Singer]] has argued that intervention in nature would be justified if one could be reasonably confident that this would greatly reduce wild animal suffering and death in the long run. In practice, however, Singer cautions against interfering with ecosystems because he fears that doing so would cause more harm than good.&lt;ref name=Singer1973&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Singer|first1=Peter|title=Food for Thought|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1973/jun/14/food-for-thought/|journal=[[The New York Review of Books]]|accessdate=23 February 2015|date=June 14, 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Singer2014&gt;{{cite book|last1=Singer|first1=Peter|title=The Point of View of The Universe|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0199603695|page=346}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other authors dispute Singer's empirical claim about the likely consequences of intervening in the natural world, and argue that some types of intervention can be expected to produce good consequences overall. Economist [[Tyler Cowen]] cites examples of animal species whose extinction is not generally regarded as having been on balance bad for the world. Cowen also notes that, insofar as humans are already intervening in nature, the relevant practical question is not whether we should intervene at all, but what particular forms of intervention we should favor.&lt;ref name="Policing Nature"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cowen|first=Tyler|title=Policing Nature|journal=Environment Ethics|year=2003|volume=25|issue=2|pages=169–182|doi=10.5840/enviroethics200325231}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher Oscar Horta similarly writes that there are already many cases in which we intervene in nature for other reasons, such as for human interest in nature and environmental preservation as something valuable in their own rights.&lt;ref name=Horta2010a&gt;{{cite journal|last=Horta|first=Oscar|title=Debunking the Idyllic View of Natural Processes: Population Dynamics and Suffering in the Wild|journal=Télos|year=2010|volume=17|issue=1|pages=73–88|url=https://www.academia.edu/2290959/Debunking_the_Idyllic_View_of_Natural_Processes_Population_Dynamics_and_Suffering_in_the_Wild}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, moral philosopher [[Jeff McMahan (philosopher)|Jeff McMahan]] argues that, since humans "are already causing massive, precipitate changes in the natural world," we should favor those changes that would promote the survival "of herbivorous rather than carnivorous species."&lt;ref name=McMahan2010 /&gt;

[[Peter Vallentyne]] suggests that, while humans should not eliminate predators in nature, they can intervene to help prey in more limited ways. In the same way that we help humans in need when the cost to us is small, we might help some wild animals at least in limited circumstances.&lt;ref name=Verchot2014&gt;{{cite news|last1=Verchot|first1=Manon|title=Meet the people who want to turn predators into vegans|url=http://www.treehugger.com/natural-sciences/meet-the-people-who-want-to-turn-predators-into-vegans.html|accessdate=2 October 2014|agency=TreeHugger|date=30 Sep 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Potential conflict between animal rights and environmentalism ===

It has been argued that the common environmentalist goal of preserving the natural order is not in line with the goal of looking after the welfare of sentient animals.&lt;ref name=Belshaw&gt;{{cite book|last=Belshaw|first=Christoher|title=Environmental Philosophy|year=2001|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press|isbn=1-902683-21-8|page=xii}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been further argued that they conflict in different cases. Examples include environmentalists supporting hunting invasive species for population control while animal rights advocates oppose it;&lt;ref name=Horta2010d&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Horta|first1=Oscar|title=What Is Speciesism?|journal=Journal of Agricultural and Environmental Ethics|year=2010|volume=23|issue=3|pages=243–266|url=http://masalladelaespecie.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/whatisspeciesism.pdf|doi=10.1007/s10806-009-9205-2|accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; animal rights advocates arguing for the extinction or reengineering of carnivores or ''r'' strategist species while deep ecologists defend their right to be and flourish as they are;&lt;ref name=Pearce2009&gt;{{cite web|last=Pearce|first=David|title=Reprogramming Predators|year=2009|url=http://www.hedweb.com/abolitionist-project/reprogramming-predators.html|publisher=HEDWEB|accessdate=8 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; animal rights advocates defending the reduction of wildlife areas or arguing against their expansion out of concern that most animal suffering takes place in them while environmentalists want to safeguard and expand the wild.&lt;ref name=Sagoff1984&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sagoff|first=Mark|title=Animal Liberation and Environmental Ethics: Bad Marriage, Quick Divorce|journal=Osgoode Hall Law Journal|year=1984|volume=22|issue=2|pages=297–307|url=http://digitalcommons.osgoode.yorku.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1936&amp;context=ohlj}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hettinger1994/&gt;

=== History of interventions ===
In 2016, 350 starving [[hippo]]s and [[African buffalo|buffalo]]es at [[Kruger National Park]] were killed by park rangers. One of the motives for the action was to prevent the animals from suffering as they died.&lt;ref name="krugercull"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Burke|first1=Jason|title=South African national park to kill animals in response to severe drought|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/14/south-african-national-park-kill-animals-severe-drought|website=The Guardian|accessdate=20 November 2016|date=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
