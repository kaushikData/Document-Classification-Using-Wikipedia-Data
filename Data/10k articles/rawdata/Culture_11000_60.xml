      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4410">The '''Afo-A-Kom''' is a wooden sculpture, the foremost symbol of the [[Kom people (Cameroon)|Kom people]] of the [[Northwest Region (Cameroon)|North West Region]] of [[Cameroon]]. In 1966 it was stolen from Kom's royal compound. Seven years later it was recognized in a U.S. art gallery, and after some dispute, it was returned to the Kom people.&lt;ref&gt;Afo-A-Kom.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Afo-A-Kom, which means ''the Kom thing'' (also ''Mbang'' in the [[Kom language]]) is a 62.5 inch wooden stylized carving of a standing man, crowned and holding a scepter, behind a stool supported on three carved buffalo heads. The core is [[iroko]] wood. His face is sheathed in copper and much of the body is covered with reddish and blue beads. (See the Arthemis link below for a photo online.) The [[Fon (title)|Foyn/Fon]] (chief) cares for the statue, and it symbolizes "royal authority and the promise of continued succession."&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; The carver of this statue is unknown but it is speculated that Afo-A-Kom was carved by the second traditional leader (Foyn) of the Kom people in the 1920s.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

In 1966, the Afo-A-Kom was stolen from its sacred grove at [[Laikom]] (the seat of the Kom people, where the Foyn resides) by one of the princes, then sold to a middle man who later sold it to an art dealer who took it to the United States of America.&lt;ref&gt;Blakeslee.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, p. 141-145.&lt;/ref&gt; The Kom people believe that the Afo-A-Kom possesses mystical powers and that shortly after it arrived in the US it began disturbing its new owners by destroying everything around it. Its new owner took it and threw it into the sea but only to get back home and see the Afo-A-Kom.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} He took it to a New York art gallery where he sold it for circa 15 million CFA. While there it was recognized, and American art collector [[Warren M. Robbins]] raised an alarm. He raised funds together with other Americans&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; and some Kom elite in the US{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} to purchase the stolen statue back from the Manhattan art gallery for under $30,000.&lt;ref&gt;Afo-A-Kom.&lt;/ref&gt; Returning the figure, Robbins was welcomed by the Fon of the Kom people Nsom Ngwe, and the President of Cameroon [[Ahmadou Ahidjo]], among other dignitaries.

During the reception of the statue in Yaounde, Ahidjo suggested to Fon Nsom Ngwe that Mbang be kept in the National Museum in Yaounde, but the Fon replied that if the President can provide enough space in Yaounde for him to go and bring the Kom people to stay with it there, then he would accept the president's proposal. Seeing that Kom and the Afo-A-Kom were inseparable, the president made it possible for the statue to be taken back to its habitual residence at Laikom. However, it was briefly put on display at the Tourism Office in Yaounde and later on transported by air to [[Bamenda]]. It was then ferried by a delegation of the dignitaries of the region back to Fundong where it was handed back to the Kom people.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

It is now in the Laikom palace where it is put on display annually for the Kom people.&lt;ref&gt;Abang Njuosi.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Schneider von Ulm.jpg|thumb|Contemporary drawing of the flight attempt]]

'''Albrecht Ludwig Berblinger''' (24 June 1770 in [[Ulm]] &amp;ndash; 28 January 1829 in Ulm), also known as '''the Tailor of Ulm''', is famous for having constructed a working [[flying machine]], presumably a [[hang glider]].

== Early life ==

Berblinger was the seventh child of a poor family. When he was 13 his father died and he was sent to an orphanage. There he was forced to become a tailor although he wanted to become a watchmaker.
He became a [[master craftsman]] at 21, but he still was interested in mechanics. In his spare time in 1808 he invented the first [[artificial limb]] with a joint.

== Flight attempts ==
{{Tone|date = June 2012}}
[[File:Stamps of Germany (DDR) 1990, MiNr 3313.jpg|thumb|Berblinger's design drawing of his glider on a GDR stamp]]
One of Berblinger's inventions was what appears to be a [[hang glider]]. He worked on it for years, improving it and watching the flight of owls. People made fun of him and he was threatened with exclusion from the [[guild]]. He was ordered to pay a large fine for his working outside of the guild. Nevertheless, he invested his whole income in his project. King [[Frederick I of Württemberg]] became interested in his work and sponsored him with 20 [[Louis (coin)|Louis]].

He tried to demonstrate the glider on the evening of 30 May 1811 in the presence of the king, his three sons and the crown prince of Bavaria. The king and a large number of citizens waited for the flight but Berblinger cancelled it, claiming that his glider was damaged. The next day he made a second attempt from a higher location – the Adlerbastei (''Eagles Bastion'').&lt;ref&gt;This structure no longer exists but a plaque commemorates it on the banks of the river in Neue Strasse just past the  Dreifaltigkeitskirche (''Holy Trinity Church'')&lt;/ref&gt; The King had left by this time, but his brother Duke Heinrich and the princes stayed to watch. Berblinger waited so long for a good wind that a policeman finally gave him a push and Berblinger fell into the Donau (''Danube''). Other versions of this account have no mention of the policeman and claim that the difference in temperature over the cold Donau (Danube) limited thermal updrafts and therefore the glider failed to lift. 
He survived and was rescued by fishermen, but his reputation was  ruined as a result and his work suffered. He was 58 years old when he died in a hospital.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

The story of the tailor, who tried to fly, subsequently resulted in some fleer and allusions in publications of the 19th century. When [[Wilhelm Busch]] drew a man falling into a stream  in his picture story "[[Max and Moritz]]", he could count on some awareness of his readers. It was not until the end of the century that [[Otto Lilienthal]] proved the feasibility of heavier-than-air flight.

== Reception ==

* A reconstruction of Berblinger's flying device (in the form of a pair of wings) can be seen in the Ulm Rathaus (''City Hall'') suspended above the stairwell near the Standesamt (''Registrary'') where civil weddings are held. There is also another reconstruction of the glider in the ground level of building B in the Fachhochschule (''University of Applied Science'') Ulm.
* In 1986 it was proven that Berblinger's glider was capable of sustained flight, but it was almost impossible to cross the Danube even with most modern gliders.
* [[Bertolt Brecht]] wrote a ballad about Berblinger in 1934.

'''Cultural geography''' is a subfield within [[human geography]]. Though the first traces of the study of different nations and cultures on [[Earth]] can be dated back to ancient geographers such as [[Ptolemy]] or [[Strabo]], cultural geography as academic study firstly emerged as an alternative to the [[Environmental determinism|environmental determinist]] theories of the early Twentieth century, which had believed that people and societies are controlled by the [[Natural environment|environment]] in which they develop.&lt;ref name="PeetRichard2"&gt;Peet, Richard; 1998; Modern Geographical Thought; Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than studying pre-determined regions based upon environmental classifications, cultural geography became interested in [[cultural landscape]]s.&lt;ref name="PeetRichard2" /&gt; This was led by [[Carl O. Sauer]] (called the father of cultural geography), at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. As a result, cultural geography was long dominated by [[United States|American]] writers.

Geographers drawing on this tradition see cultures and societies as developing out of their local landscapes but also shaping those landscapes.&lt;ref name="Sauer2"&gt;Sauer, Carl; 1925; The Morphology of Landscape&lt;/ref&gt; This interaction between the [[natural landscape]] and humans creates the [[cultural landscape]]. This understanding is a foundation of cultural geography but has been augmented over the past forty years with more nuanced and complex concepts of culture, drawn from a wide range of disciplines including [[anthropology]], [[sociology]], [[literary theory]], and [[feminism]]. No single definition of culture dominates within cultural geography. Regardless of their particular interpretation of culture, however, geographers wholeheartedly reject theories that treat culture as if it took place "on the head of a pin".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1= Gregory, Derek |author2= Urry, John |title= Social Relations and Spatial Structures |year=1985 |publisher= Macmillan Education |location= London  |isbn= 978-0312734848 |pages=9–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among many applicable topics within the field of study are:
* [[Globalization]] has been theorised as an explanation for cultural convergence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Zelinsky |first=Wilbur |authorlink= Wilbur Zelinsky |year= 2004 |title= Globalization Reconsidered: The Historical Geography of Modern Western Male Attire |journal= Journal of Cultural Geography |volume=  22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Westernization]] or other similar processes such as [[modernization]], [[americanization]], [[islamization]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Debres |first=Karen |year=2005 |title= Burgers for Britain: A Cultural Geography of McDonald's UK |journal= Journal of Cultural Geography |volume= 22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This geography studies the geography of culture
* Theories of [[cultural hegemony]] or [[cultural assimilation]] via [[cultural imperialism]].
* Cultural areal differentiation, as a study of differences in way of life encompassing ideas, attitudes, languages, practices, institutions and structures of power and whole range of cultural practices in geographical areas.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Richard C. (2006). "Cultural Diversity in a “Bi-Cultural” City: Factors in the Location of Ancestry Groups in San Antonio." ''Journal of Cultural Geography''.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Study of [[cultural landscape]]s&lt;ref&gt;Sinha, Amita; 2006; Cultural Landscape of Pavagadh: The Abode of Mother Goddess Kalika; Journal of Cultural Geography&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kuhlken, Robert; 2002; Intensive Agricultural Landscapes of Oceania; Journal of Cultural Geography&lt;/ref&gt; and [[cultural ecology]].
* Other topics include [[sense of place]], [[colonialism]], [[postcolonialism|post-colonialism]], [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalism]], [[immigration]], [[emigration]] and [[ecotourism]].

==History==
Though the first traces of the study of different nations and cultures on [[Earth]] can be dated back to ancient geographers such as [[Ptolemy]] or [[Strabo]], cultural geography as academic study firstly emerged as an alternative to the [[environmental determinism|environmental determinist]] theories of the early Twentieth century, which had believed that people and societies are controlled by the [[Natural environment|environment]] in which they develop.&lt;ref name="PeetRichard2"/&gt; Rather than studying pre-determined regions based upon environmental classifications, cultural geography became interested in [[cultural landscape]]s.&lt;ref name="PeetRichard2"/&gt; This was led by [[Carl O. Sauer]] (called the father of cultural geography), at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. As a result, cultural geography was long dominated by [[United States|American]] writers.

Sauer defined the landscape as the defining unit of geographic study. He saw that cultures and societies both developed out of their landscape, but also shaped them too.&lt;ref name="Sauer2"/&gt; This interaction between the [[natural landscape]] and humans creates the [[cultural landscape]].&lt;ref name="Sauer2"/&gt; Sauer's work was highly [[qualitative research|qualitative]] and descriptive and was challenged in the 1930s by the [[regional geography]] of [[Richard Hartshorne]]. Hartshorne called for systematic analysis of the elements that varied from place to place, a project taken up by the [[quantitative revolution]]. Cultural geography was sidelined by the [[positivist]] tendencies of this effort to make geography into a [[hard science]] although writers such as [[David Lowenthal]] continued to write about the more subjective, qualitative aspects of landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1= Jordan-Bychkov, Terry G. |author2= Domosh, Mona |author3= Rowntree, Lester |title= The human mosaic: a thematic introduction to cultural geography |year=1994 |publisher= HarperCollins CollegePublishers |location= New York  |isbn= 978-0-06-500731-2 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, new kind of critique of positivism in geography directly challenged the deterministic and abstract ideas of quantitative geography. This revitalized cultural geography manifested itself in the engagement of geographers such as [[Yi-Fu Tuan]] and [[Edward Relph]] and [[Anne Buttimer]] with [[humanism]], [[phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenology]], and [[hermeneutics]]. This break initiated a strong trend in human geography toward [[Post-positivism]] that developed under the label New Cultural Geography while deriving methods of systematic social and cultural critique from [[critical geography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author= Tuan, Yi-Fu |title= Space and Place: The Perspective of Experience |year=1977 |publisher= University of Minnesota Press |location= Minneapolis  |isbn= 978-0816638772 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author= Relph, Edward |title= Place and Placelessness |year=1976 |publisher= Pion |location= London  |isbn= 978-0850861761 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="New cultural geography"==
Since the 1980s, a ''new cultural geography'' has emerged, drawing on a diverse set of theoretical traditions, including [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[political economy|political-economic models]], [[feminist theory]], [[postcolonialism|post-colonial theory]], [[post-structuralism]] and [[psychoanalysis]].

Drawing particularly from the theories of [[Michel Foucault]] and [[performativity]] in western academia, and the more diverse influences of [[postcolonialism|postcolonial theory]], there has been a concerted effort to [[deconstruction|deconstruct]] the cultural in order to reveal that power relations are fundamental to spatial processes and [[sense of place]]. Particular areas of interest are how [[identity politics]] are organized in space and the construction of subjectivity in particular places.&lt;ref name=Simandan2016&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.geoforum.2016.07.018 |title=Proximity, subjectivity, and space: Rethinking distance in human geography |journal=Geoforum |volume=75 |pages=249 |year=2016 |last1=Simandan |first1=Dragos }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of areas of study include:
* [[Feminist geography]]
* [[Children's geographies]]
* Some parts of [[tourism geography]]
* [[Behavioral geography]]
* [[Sexuality and space]]
* Some more recent developments in [[political geography]]
* [[Music geography]]

Some within the ''new cultural geography'' have turned their attention to critiquing some of its ideas, seeing its views on identity and space as static. It has followed the critiques of Foucault made by other '[[post-structuralism|poststructuralist]]' theorists such as [[Michel de Certeau]] and [[Gilles Deleuze]]. In this area, [[non-representational theory|non-representational geography]] and [[population mobility]] research have dominated. Others have attempted to incorporate these and other critiques back into the new cultural geography&lt;ref&gt;Whatmore, S., 2006. Materialist returns: practising cultural geography in and for a more-than-human world. Cultural geographies, 13(4), pp.600-609.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Groups within the geography community have differing views on the role of culture and how to analyze it in the context of geography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1191/1474474006cgj377oa |title=Materialist returns: Practising cultural geography in and for a more-than-human world |journal=Cultural geographies |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=600 |year=2016 |last1=Whatmore |first1=Sarah }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Simandan2016/&gt; It is commonly thought that physical geography simply dictates aspects of culture such as shelter, clothing and cuisine. However, systematic development of this idea is generally discredited as [[environmental determinism]]. Geographers are now more likely to understand culture as a set of symbolic resources that help people make sense of the world around them, as well as a manifestation of the power relations between various groups and the structure through which [[social change]] is constrained and enabled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/area.12289 |title=Timely geographies: 'New directions in cultural geography' revisited |journal=Area |volume=48 |issue=3 |pages=374 |year=2016 |last1=Wylie |first1=John }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1= Adams, Paul C. |author2= Hoelscher, Steven |author3= Till, Karen E. |title= Textures of Place: Exploring Humanist Geographies |year=2001 |publisher= University of Minnesota Press |location= Minneapolis  |isbn= 978-0816637560 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many ways to look at what culture means in light of various geographical insights, but in general geographers study how cultural processes involve spatial patterns and processes while requiring the existence and maintenance of particular kinds of places.

The '''deathwatch beetle''', ''Xestobium rufovillosum'', is a [[woodboring beetle]]. The adult [[beetle]] is {{convert|7|mm}} long, while the [[xylophagous]] [[larva]]e are up to {{convert|11|mm|abbr=on}} long.

To attract mates, these woodborers create a tapping or ticking sound that can be heard in the [[rafter]]s of old buildings on quiet summer nights. They are therefore associated with quiet, sleepless nights and are named for the [[vigil]] (watch) kept beside the dying or dead, and by extension the superstitious have seen the deathwatch beetle as an omen of impending death.

The term "death watch" has been applied to a variety of other ticking insects, including ''[[Anobium striatum]]'', some of the so-called booklice of the family [[Psocidae]], and the appropriately named ''Atropos divinatoria'' and ''Clothilla pulsatoria'' (Greek goddesses  [[Atropos]] and [[Clotho]] were associated with death).

The larva is very soft, yet can bore its way through wood, which it is able to digest using a number of [[enzymes]] in its alimentary canal, provided that the wood has experienced prior fungal decay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/reprint/17/4/364.pdf |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |title=The digestive enzymes of some wood-boring beetle larvae |author=E. A. Parkin |journal=[[Journal of Experimental Biology]] |volume=17 |issue=4 |year=1940 |pages=364–377}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{listen |filename=Xestobium sound.ogg |title=sound produced by the death watch beetle}}

==In culture==
Its nature as an ill omen is alluded to in the fourth book of [[John Keats]]' 1818 poem "[[Endymion (poem)|Endymion]]": "...within ye hear / No sound so loud as when on curtain'd bier / The death-watch tick is stifled."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/126/35.html|title=35. Endymion. Keats, John. 1884. The Poetical Works of John Keats|website=www.bartleby.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; ("Stifled" because the death it was portending has taken place.)

In 1838 [[Henry David Thoreau]] published an essay mentioning the deathwatch beetle. It is possible that this essay influenced [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s 1843 short story "[[The Tell-Tale Heart]]" and that the sound the protagonist was hearing at the end of that story was that of a beetle tapping inside the wall, not the beating of the (dead) victim's heart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eapoe.org/pstudies/ps1970/p1971105.htm|title=Edgar Allan Poe Society of Baltimore - Poe Studies - Poe Newsletter - Thoreau and the Deathwatch in Poe's The Tell-Tale Heart|website=www.eapoe.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The beetle was referenced in [[Mark Twain]]'s 1876 ''[[The Adventures of Tom Sawyer]]'': "Next the ghastly ticking of a deathwatch in the wall at the bed's head made Tom shudder – it meant that somebody's days were numbered."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Twain, Mark |authorlink=Mark Twain |title=[[The Adventures of Tom Sawyer]] | date=1876 |publisher=	American Publishing Company |oclc=47052486}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, [[Linda Pastan]] wrote a poem entitled ''The Deathwatch Beetle''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pastan |first1=Linda |title=Carnival Evening: New and Selected Poems 1968-1998 |date=1988 |publisher=W. W. Norton |isbn=978-0393319279 |url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46837/the-deathwatch-beetle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995 [[Alice Hoffman]] referenced the deathwatch beetle in her novel "[[Practical Magic]]" as an omen of death whenever anyone hears its clicking until that person dies.

Corwin Press&lt;/ref&gt; Blogs can be useful tools for sharing information and tips among co-workers, providing information for students, or keeping in contact with parents. Common examples include blogs written by or for teachers, blogs maintained for the purpose of classroom instruction, or blogs written about educational policy.  Educators who blog are sometimes called edubloggers.

==History==
Weblogs have existed for close to two decades. However, it wasn't until the second half of the 1990s that weblogs began to grow in popularity.&lt;ref name=Blood&gt;{{cite book |last=Blood |first=Rebecca |chapter=Weblogs: A History and Perspective |title=We've Got Blog: How Weblogs Are Changing Our Culture |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c5BEJ0nug7QC&amp;pg=PA7 |year=2009 |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=978-0-7867-3086-5 |pages=7–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, there were just a handful of sites of the type that are now identified as weblogs (so named by Jorn Barger in December 1997).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Blood |first=Rebecca |title=weblogs: a history and perspective |url=http://www.rebeccablood.net/essays/weblog_history.html |publisher=Perseus Publishing |date=7 September 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, there were 23 known weblogs, and Pitas http://www.pitas.com/, the first free build your own weblog tool, was launched. Also in 1999 weblogs changed from a mix of links, commentary, and thoughts, to short form journal entries.&lt;ref name=Blood /&gt; An early recorded use of the term "edublog" can be traced to a [[webring]] called the [http://runhits.com//netring?ring=edublog&amp;action=member&amp;id=&amp;sort_order= Edublog WebRing], founded on January 30, 2002. The new use of weblogs are largely interest driven and attract readers who have similar interests.&lt;ref name=Richardson /&gt; In 2004, there were an estimated 3 million blogs and as of July 2011, there are an estimated 164 million blogs.&lt;ref name=Treanor&gt;{{cite web |last=Treanor |first=Tom |title=2011 Blogging Statistics (infographic) |url=http://www.rightmixmarketing.com/right-mix-blog/blogging-statistics/ |publisher=Right Mix Marketing Inc. |accessdate=18 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Edublog Awards]], the international and community based awards programme for the use of blogs and social media to support education, runs annually online across a range of platforms. The Awards were founded by [[James N. Farmer]] in 2004.

==Uses==

There are several uses of edublogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Luján-Mora |first=Sergio |title=A Survey of Use of Weblogs in Education |journal=Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Multimedia and Information and Communication Technologies in Education (m-ICTE 2006) |date=November 2006 |pages=255–259 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some bloggers use their blogs as a learning journal or a knowledge log to gather relevant information and ideas, and communicate with other people.&lt;ref name=Ray /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kerawella |first=L. |last2=Minocha |first2=S. |last3=Kirkup |first3=G. |last4=Conole |first4=G. |title=An Empirically Grounded Framework to Guide Blogging in Higher Education |journal=Journal of Computer Assisted Learning |year=2008 |volume=25 |pages=31–42 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2729.2008.00286.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some teachers use blogs to keep in contact with students' parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Luján-Mora |first=Sergio |title=Ways to use blogs in education |url=http://desarrolloweb.dlsi.ua.es/blogs/ways-to-use-blogs |accessdate=18 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some bloggers use blogs to record their own personal life,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Leslie |first=P |last2=Murphy |first2=E |title=Post Secondary Students' Purposes for Blogging |journal=International Review of Research IN Open Distance Learning |year=2008 |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=1–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Educational blogs have also been used as an engagement and reflective assessment tool for Accounting students and can improve educational outcomes for Accounting students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Joshi |first1=Mahesh |last2=Chugh |first2=Ritesh |date=2009 |title=New paradigms in the teaching and learning of accounting: Use of educational blogs for reflective thinking |work=International Journal of Education and Development using Information and Communication Technology |volume=5 |issue=3 |pp=1–11 |url=http://ijedict.dec.uwi.edu/include/getdoc.php?id=4271&amp;article=664&amp;mode=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teacher blogs==

There are many teacher-related blogs on the internet where teachers can share information with one another. Teachers familiarize themselves with edublogs before implementing them with their students.&lt;ref name=Richardson /&gt; Many teachers share materials and ideas to meet the diverse needs of all learners in their classrooms.&lt;ref name=Poling /&gt; Teachers can often rely on these sources to communicate with one another regarding any issues in education that they may be having, including [[classroom management]] techniques and policies. In this way, the blog often acts as a support system for teachers where they can access ideas, tools, and gain support and recognition from other professionals in their field. Weblogs can provide a forum for reading, writing and collaborating.&lt;ref name=Poling&gt;{{cite journal |last=Poling |first=C |title=Blog On:Building Communication and Collaboration Among Staff and Students |journal=Learning and Leading with Technology |year=2005 |volume=32 |issue=6 |pages=12–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ray, Hocutt"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ray |first=B |last2=Hocutt |first2=M |title=Teacher- Created, Teacher-Centered Weblogs: Perceptions and Practices |journal=Journal of Computing in Teacher Education |year=2006 |volume=1 |issue=23 |pages=11–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edublogs can be used as instructional resources, in which teachers can post tips, explanations or samples to help students learn.&lt;ref name=Wang&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wang |first=Hong |title=Exploring Educational Use of Blogs in U.S. Education |journal=China Education Review |year=2008 |volume=5 |issue=10 |pages=35 |url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED503871.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of blogs in the classroom allows both the teacher and student the ability to edit and add content at any time.&lt;ref name=Kajder&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kajder |first=S |author2=Bull, G |title=Learning and Leading Technology |journal=Scaffolding for Struggling Students |year=2003 |volume=31 |issue=9 |pages=32–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ability for both the teacher and student to edit content allows for study to take place outside the classroom environment, since blogs can usually be accessed using the URL of the blog on any computer. Blogs increase exposure to other students from around the country or world, while improving writing and communication skills. Teachers are using blogs as a way to post important information such as homework, important dates, missed lessons, projects, [[discussion boards]], and other useful classroom information that is accessible by all.&lt;ref name=Churchill&gt;{{cite journal |last=Churchill |first=D |title=Educational Applications of Web 2.0: Using Blogs to Support Teaching and Learning |journal=British Journal of Education |year=2008 |volume=40 |issue=1 |pages=179–183 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8535.2008.00865.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As noted, students can access this information from home, or from any computer that is connected to the Internet.

Teachers and parents can also use blogs in order to communicate with one another. They can be used to post class announcements for parents or providing schedule reminders.&lt;ref name=Wang /&gt; Connecting to a teacher's blog is also a convenient way for parents to find out daily assignments so that they can monitor their children's progress and understand classroom expectations.

==Student blogging in the K-12 classroom==
Student blogging describes students in Kindergarten to Grade 12 who are using blogs in some way in a formal classroom context. Blogs are digital platforms that provide students with a medium for sharing knowledge and experiences that go beyond the traditional means of reading and writing in classrooms.&lt;ref name="Glewa Monica"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Glewa |first=Monica |author2=Bogan, Margret B. |title=Improving Children's Literacy while promoting digital fluency through the use of blogs in the classroom.

The use of blogs in education&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=www.examideas.com |url=http://www.examideas.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; gives students a global perspective. Teachers and students from different states, countries, and continents are able to collaborate on different projects and ideas. A classroom in China can collaborate with classrooms in Germany, Mexico, Australia, etc. with just a few clicks of a button. Learning through blogs allows students to take control of their own learning and steer it to their own needs. Students are able to see that opinions and even strategies vary based on location and culture. Children are all different, but a common thread of learning can unite them. The use of blogs in the classroom engages children in learning and using [[technological literacy]] that will help them in adulthood.

There has not been a significant amount of research conducted on K-12 students regarding the efficacy of edublogs in enhancing learning. However, anecdotal results discussed by educators have given a glimpse into their utility or promise. There is a general consensus that edublogs create many opportunities for collaborative learning, as well as enhance the ability to locate and reflect upon work.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, W. (2006). Blogs, Wikis, Podcasts and the Powerful Web Tools for Classrooms. Thousand Oaks: Corwin Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Common pedagogical uses===
According to extant literature, students use blogging in classrooms for different purposes. Blogs are used to showcase individual student work by enabling them to publish texts, video clips, audio clips, maps, photos and other images, projects and suchlike in a potentially publicly accessible forum.&lt;ref name=Wang /&gt;&lt;ref name="Glewa Monica" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Huffaker&gt;{{cite journal |last=Huffaker |first=David |title=The Educated Blogger: Using Weblogs to promote Literacy in the Classroom |journal=AACE Journal |year=2005 |volume=13 |issue=5 |pages=91–98 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of student blogging argue that blogging can contribute directly to improved writing abilities and argue that classroom blogging can enable students to engage with audiences beyond their classroom walls by using blogs as personal journals, as diaries, for story writing, and for making editorial responses to news events.&lt;ref name=Wang /&gt;&lt;ref name=Farmer&gt;{{cite journal |last=Farmer |first=James |author2=Bragg Anne  Bartlett |title=Blogs @ Anywhere: High Fidelity Online Communication |year=2005 |url=http://www.ascilite.org.au/conferences/brisbane05/blogs/proceedings/22_Farmer.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716232120/http://www.ascilite.org.au/conferences/brisbane05/blogs/proceedings/22_Farmer.pdf |archivedate=2012-07-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Researchers have also documented teachers using student blogging to promote creativity and self-expression.&lt;ref name=Huffaker /&gt;&lt;ref name=Read&gt;{{cite journal |last=Read |first=Sylvia |author2=Fisher Douglas |title=Tapping into Students' Motivation: Lessons from |journal=Voices from the Middle |date=December 2006 |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=38–42 |url=http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1109&amp;context=teal_facpub&amp;sei-redir=1&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.ca%2Furl%3Fsa%3Dt%26rct%3Dj%26q%3Dtapping%2520into%2520students%2520motivation%2520lessons%2520from%2520young%2520adolescents%26source%3Dweb%26cd%3D2%26ved%3D0CEoQFjAB%26url%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fdigitalcommons.usu.edu%252Fcgi%252Fviewcontent.cgi%253Farticle%253D1109%2526context%253Dteal_facpub%26ei%3DFeQGUOXOCYXl0QH76NzVCA%26usg%3DAFQjCNGLT7ikXvKYMNy5C5vumzvsEts7oA |accessdate=17 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reasons for use===
Some researchers claim that student blogs promote learning by providing opportunities for students to take more control of their learning and the content they engage.&lt;ref name=Huffaker /&gt;&lt;ref name=Read /&gt;&lt;ref name=Curran&gt;{{cite journal |last=Curran |first=Kevin |author2=Marshall David |title=Blogs in Education |journal=Elixir Online Journal |year=2011 |volume=36 |pages=3515–3518 |url=http://eprints.ulster.ac.uk/20614/1/Elixir-Blogs.PDF |accessdate=18 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also claimed that student blogging intrinsically [[motivate]]s students to become better readers and writers.&lt;ref name="Glewa Monica" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hsu /&gt;&lt;ref name=Read /&gt;

===Potential limitations/some criticisms===
There is very little research on student blogging available.&lt;ref name="Glewa Monica" /&gt; That being said, there is a large amount of published [[anecdotal evidence]] regarding criticisms of student blogging or limitations in using blogging in classrooms. For example, commentators claim that student blogs often include uncorrected inaccuracies of information,&lt;ref name=Wang /&gt; or can be used to instigate online bullying.&lt;ref name=Curran /&gt; Commentators also complain that student blogs are difficult to archive or index.&lt;ref name=Wang /&gt;

== Professional development blogs for teachers ==

Although there are many blogs that teachers can use in the classroom with their students, there is also a multitude of blogs that teachers can use for their own professional development. Such blogs include hints on ways to be a better teacher in a certain subject area such as music, mathematics, or ESL, blogs on educational theory, blogs on advice for new teachers, blogs on where to find free technology, and blogs on transforming education, for example.  There is much that can be learned from blogs of other teaching professionals and the learning can be done anytime and anywhere.&lt;ref&gt;Ferriter, B. (2009).  Learning with blogs and wikis.  Retrieved on 03/02/13, from http://www.ascd.org/publications/educational-leadership/feb09/vol66/num05/Learning-with-Blogs-and-Wikis.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--[[Image:Hall-Silent.jpg|thumb|right|{{deletable image-caption}}]]--&gt;
'''Edward Twitchell Hall, Jr.''' (May 16, 1914 &amp;ndash; July 20, 2009) was an American [[anthropology|anthropologist]] and cross-cultural researcher. He is remembered for developing the concept of [[proxemics]] and exploring cultural and [[social cohesion]], and describing how people behave and react in different types of culturally defined [[personal space]]. Hall was an influential colleague of [[Marshall McLuhan]] and [[Buckminster Fuller]].&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Everett M. (2000). [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/S15327825MCS0301_06 "The Extensions of Men: The Correspondence of Marshall McLuhan and Edward T. Hall."] ''Mass Communication and Society'', 3(1): 117-135.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Hall was born in [[Webster Groves, Missouri]] and taught at the [[University of Denver]], [[Colorado]], [[Bennington College]] in [[Vermont]], [[Harvard Business School]], [[Illinois Institute of Technology]], [[Northwestern University]] in [[Illinois]] and others. The foundation for his lifelong research on cultural [[perception]]s of space was laid during [[World War II]], when he served in the [[U.S. Army]] in Europe and the [[Philippines]].

From 1933 through 1937, Hall lived and worked with the [[Navajo Nation|Navajo]] and the [[Hopi]] on Native American [[Indian reservation|reservation]]s in northeastern [[Arizona]], the subject of his autobiographical ''West of the Thirties.'' He received his Ph.D. from [[Columbia University]] in 1942 and continued with [[field work]] and direct experience throughout Europe, the Middle East, and Asia.  During the 1950s he worked for the [[United States State Department]], at the [[Foreign Service Institute]] (FSI), teaching inter-cultural communications skills to foreign service personnel, developed the concept of "[[high context culture]]" and "[[low context culture]]", and wrote several popular practical books on dealing with cross-cultural issues. He is considered a founding father of [[intercultural communication]] as an academic area of study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rogers |first=Everett M. |last2=Hart |first2=William B. |last3=Miike |first3=Yoshitaka |year=2002 |title=Edward T. Hall and the History of Intercultural Communication: The United States and Japan |journal=Keio Communication Review |issue=24 |pages=3–26 |url=http://www.mediacom.keio.ac.jp/publication/pdf2002/review24/2.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Leeds-Hurwitz|1990|p=262-281}}

Throughout his career, Hall introduced a number of new concepts, including [[proxemics]], [[Chronemics#Monochronic time|monochronictime]], [[Chronemics#Polychronic time|polychronic time]], and [[high-context and low-context cultures]]. In his second book, ''The Hidden Dimension'', he describes the culturally specific temporal and spatial dimensions that surround each of us, such as the physical distances people maintain in different contexts.

In ''The Silent Language'' (1959), Hall coined the term "polychronic" to describe the ability to attend to multiple events simultaneously, as opposed to "monochronic" individuals and cultures who tend to handle events sequentially.

In 1976, he released his third book, ''[[Beyond Culture]]'', which is notable for having developed the idea of [[extension transference]]; by an extension, he simply means any technological item, from clothes to laptops. He brings to our attention the fact that these 'extensions' only help us perform certain functions, but they as extensions will never quite be able to carry out these functions by themselves (for example, think about computers, airplanes, etc. We can fly with airplanes, but we can't on our own and nor can airplanes fly 'on their own'). His biggest claim is that culture itself is an extension of man. Extensions also exist in their own evolutionary realm, as well. That is, they evolve on their own and do not directly influence human evolution. 

The 'transference' of 'extension transference' is a term he coined to describe when people regard a symbol to actually be its referent. The clearest example of this would be language; like when people do not realize that words are merely symbolic to their referents. For example, there is nothing inherently watery about the physical object ''water'', at least in terms of the symbolic acoustic properties that are produced when someone utters ''water''. Evidence for this would be the fact that across languages there are thousands of unique words that all refer to water. Culture, as an extension, is also a good example; extension transference of culture happens naturally when people are unaware of the extent to which culture shapes how they perceive time and space, or that culture shapes their perception of them at all. Time and space are the two prominent aspects that Hall in particular focuses on in many of his works. 

He died at his home in Santa Fe, New Mexico on July 20, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.santafenewmexican.com/Local%20News/Edward-T--Hall--1914-2009-Anthropologist--loved-to-bring-N-M--w |title=Edward T.

==Influence==
According to Nina Brown, the work of Hall was so groundbreaking that it created a multitude of other areas for research. One of the most widely sought after topics of anthropology is an idea that was first introduced by Edward Hall: Anthropology of Space. Brown goes on to mention that the Anthropology of Space has essentially opened the door to dozens of new topics.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, N.. "Edward T. Hall: Proxemic Theory, 1966." Csiss. CSISS Classics, 2011. Web. Available at http://www.csiss.org/classics/content/13&lt;/ref&gt; Along with influencing the Anthropology of Space, Hall's research had a substantial influence on the development of intercultural communication as a research topic. Since at least 1990, he has been acknowledged frequently for his role in introducing nonverbal aspects of communication, specifically proxemics, the study of the social uses of space, the investigation of communication between members of different cultures.{{sfn|Leeds-Hurwitz|1990|p=262-281}} For example, [[Robert M. Shuter|Robert Shuter]], a well-known intercultural communication researcher, commented: "Edward Hall's research reflects the regimen and passion of an anthropologist: a deep regard for culture explored principally by descriptive, qualitative methods... The challenge for intercultural communication... is to develop a research direction and teaching agenda that returns culture to preeminence and reflects the roots of the field as represented in Edward Hall's early research."&lt;ref&gt;Shuter, Robert. (2008). The centrality of culture. In Molefi Kete Asante, Yoshitaka Miike, &amp; Jing Yin (Eds.), ''The global intercultural communication reader'' (pp. 37-43). New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

What was particularly innovative about Hall's early work is that instead of focusing on a single culture at a time, or cross-cultural comparison, as was typical in 1950's anthropology, he responded to the needs of his students at the [[Foreign Service Institute]] of the [[Department of State]] to help them understand interactions between members of different cultures.{{sfn|Leeds-Hurwitz|1990|p=263}} Hall points out that the only environment in which classroom dialogue is encountered is simply in the classroom, ergo it served the students little use when actually in the foreign country of interest. At the same time, and in response to the same students, he narrowed his focus from an entire culture, as was then standard within anthropology, to smaller moments of interaction.{{sfn|Leeds-Hurwitz|1990|p=263}} Colleagues working with him at FSI at the time included Henry Lee Smith, [[George L. Trager]], [[Charles F. Hockett]], and [[Ray Birdwhistell]]. Between them, they used [[descriptive linguistics]] as a model for not only proxemics but also [[kinesics]] and [[paralanguage]].

A classic and well-known use of eucatastrophe.{{citation needed|reason=is it well-known that this is a eucatastrophe?|date=October 2015}} Illustration by [[Gustave Doré]]]]

A '''eucatastrophe''' is a sudden turn of events at the end of a story which ensures that the [[protagonist]] does not meet some terrible, impending, and very plausible and probable doom.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mazur |2011 |p =174}}&lt;/ref&gt; The writer [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] coined the word by affixing the Greek prefix ''eu'', meaning ''good'', to ''[[catastrophe (disambiguation)|catastrophe]]'', the word traditionally used in classically inspired literary criticism to refer to the "unraveling" or conclusion of a drama's plot. For Tolkien, the term appears to have had a thematic meaning that went beyond its literal etymological meaning in terms of form.{{how|date=July 2013}} In his definition as outlined in his 1947 essay "[[On Fairy-Stories]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tolkien|1990|pp=109–161}}&lt;/ref&gt; eucatastrophe is a fundamental part of his conception of [[mythopoeia]].{{how|date=July 2013}} Though Tolkien's interest is in myth, it is also connected to the [[gospel]]; Tolkien calls the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation of Christ]] the eucatastrophe of "human [[history]]" and the [[Resurrection]] the eucatastrophe of the Incarnation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tolkien|1990|p=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eucatastrophe has been labelled as a form of [[deus ex machina]], due to both sharing an impossible problem being suddenly resolved.&lt;ref name=Westfahl&gt;{{cite book|first=Gary |last=Westfahl |title=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Themes, Works, and Wonders |volume=1 |page=195 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SQMQQyIaACYC&amp;pg=PA195&amp;dq=deus+ex+machina+eucatastrophe&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pzjEUrODIsiBtAaX2YCYAg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=deus%20ex%20machina%20eucatastrophe&amp;f=false |publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]] |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-313-32951-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hart&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hart|first1=Trevor|title=Between the Image and the Word|date=2013|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd|isbn=978-1-4724-1370-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1UaiAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT280&amp;dq=eucatastrophe+deus+ex+machina+tolkien&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_u4MVJWfN8y7ogThhIG4AQ&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=eucatastrophe%20deus%20ex%20machina%20tolkien&amp;f=false|accessdate=7 September 2014|ref=hart}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, differences between the two have also been noted, such as its inherent connection to an optimistic view on the unfolding of events in the narrative of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mazur |2011 |p = 175}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his view, eucatastrophe can also occur without the use of a deus ex machina.&lt;ref name=Magill&gt;{{cite book|last1=Magill|first1=Frank|title=Survey of modern fantasy literature|date=1983|publisher=Salem Press|isbn=978-0893564506|page=2065|edition=First|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=IfEMVLqRMcO2iwLY94GgCA&amp;id=qQ7w2AHr2xAC&amp;dq=Survey+of+modern+fantasy+literature+eucatastrophe&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=eucatastrophe|accessdate=8 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples in Tolkien's work==
[[Image:The_Shadow_of_Sauron,_by_Ted_Nasmith.jpg|right|thumb|The climax of ''[[The Lord of The Rings]]'', as portrayed by  [[Ted Nasmith]].]]
Eucatastrophe has been observed in the climax of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. Though victory seems assured for [[Sauron]], the [[One Ring]] is permanently destroyed as a result of [[Gollum]]'s waylaying of Frodo at [[Mount Doom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|Solopova|p. 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of eucatastrophe is the recurring role of the [[Eagle (Middle-earth)|eagles]] as unexpected rescuers throughout Tolkien's writing. Tolkien described Bilbo's "'eucatastrophic emotion" at the eagles' appearance in ''[[The Hobbit]]'' as one of the key moments of the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|Letters|Letter No. 89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Gare_SNCF_Strasbourg_gilets_rouges_13_juin_2014-12.jpg|thumb|Two men wearing gilets at Strasbourg railway station in France]]
A '''gilet''' ({{IPAc-en|dʒ|ɪ|'|l|eɪ}}) is a sleeveless jacket resembling a [[waistcoat]] or [[blouse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com/cgi-bin/unabridged?va=gilet|title=Merriam-Webster Unabridged – Gilet entry|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, a gilet is a sleeveless jacket or [[vest]]. They may be waist- to knee-length and are typically straight-sided rather than fitted. However, historically, they were fitted and embroidered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.costumemuseum.jp/french/collection/w_komono/k1.html|title=Sugino Costume Museum|website=www.costumemuseum.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a further derivation, in 19th-century dressmaking a gilet was a dress bodice shaped like a man's waistcoat.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary – Gilet entry&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, gilets are often worn as an outer layer, for extra warmth outdoors. Fashion gilets may be made of cloth or fake fur, or knitted. Sports gilets are often windproof and/or made of [[Wool|fleece]]. High-end [[hiking]] jackets often have an integral gilet inside them, that can be zipped on and off. [[Racing cyclist]]s use thin light gilets with a windproof front and mesh back. Shooting gilets are rugged and made of leather. Short, overwear gilets are called ''bodywarmers'' in the United Kingdom.

'''Heraldic visitations''' were tours of inspection undertaken by [[King of Arms|Kings of Arms]] (and more often by junior [[Officer of arms|officers of arms (or Heralds)]] as deputies) throughout [[England]], [[Wales]] and [[Ireland]]. Their purpose was to regulate and register the [[coat of arms|coats of arms]] of [[nobility]] and [[gentry]] and [[borough]]s, and to record [[Pedigree chart|pedigree]]s. They took place from 1530 to 1688, and their records (akin to an [[upper class]] [[census]]) provide important source material for [[historian]]s and [[genealogy|genealogists]].

==Visitations in England==

===Process of visitations===
[[Image:English heraldic visitations map.png|thumb|left|upright=1.1|Map showing the number of visitations by the [[King of Arms]] to [[England]]'s counties, taken from ''Burke's Landed Gentry'', 1937 edition]]
By the fifteenth century, the use and abuse of [[coat of arms|coats of arms]] was becoming widespread in [[England]]. One of the duties conferred on [[William Bruges]] (or [[Brydges]]), the first [[Garter Principal King of Arms]] was to survey and record the [[Coat of arms|armorial bearings]] and [[Pedigree chart|pedigree]]s of those using coats of arms and correct irregularities. [[officer of arms|Officers of arms]] had made occasional tours of various parts of the kingdom to enquire about armorial matters during the fifteenth century,&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Friar, Ed. ''A Dictionary of Heraldry''. (Harmony Books, New York: 1987).&lt;/ref&gt; however, it was not until the sixteenth century that the process began in earnest.

The first provincial visitations were carried out under [[Warrant (law)|warrant]] granted by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] to [[Thomas Benolt]], [[Clarenceux King of Arms]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddnb.com/index/2/101002134/ www.oxforddnb.com]&lt;/ref&gt; dated 6 April 1530.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Franklyn. ''Shield and Crest: An Account of the Art and Science of Heraldry''. (MacGibbon &amp; Kee, London: 1960), 386.&lt;/ref&gt; He was commissioned to travel throughout his province (i.e. south of the [[River Trent|Trent]]) with authority to enter all homes and churches. Upon entering these premises, he was authorized to "put down or otherwise deface at his discretion... those [[coat of arms|arms]] unlawfully used".&lt;ref&gt;J.L. Vivian, Ed. ''The Visitations of Cornwall, Comprising the Heralds' Visitations of 1530, 1573, &amp;1620''. (William Pollard and Co., Exeter: 1887), 248.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also required to enquire into all those using the titles of [[knight]], [[esquire]], or [[gentleman]] and decided if they were being lawfully used.

By this [[writ]], Henry VIII also compelled the [[sheriff]]s and [[mayor]]s of each [[county]] or [[city]] visited by the [[officer of arms|officers of arms]] to give aid and assistance in gathering the needed information. When a [[King of Arms]], or Herald, visited a county, his presence was proclaimed by presenting the King's royal commission to the local gentry and nobility, which required them to provide evidence of their right to use a [[coat of arms]]. The [[High Sheriff|Sheriff]] would collect from the [[bailiff]] of each [[Hundred (county division)|hundred]] within his county a list of all people using [[title]]s or arms. 

In the early days, the visiting herald would tour the homes of the gentry and nobility, but from the late 1560s these persons were summoned to attend a central "place of sitting" – usually an inn – at a particular time.&lt;ref&gt;Ailes 2009, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; They were to bring their arms, and proof of their right to use them, most often by way of detailing their ancestral right to them, which would also be recorded. Where an official [[grant of arms]] had been made, this was also recorded. Other ancient arms, many of which predated the establishment of the [[College of Arms]], were confirmed. The [[officer of arms|officer]] would record the information clearly and make detailed notes that could be entered into the records of the College of Arms when the party returned to [[London]]. 

These volumes now make up the collection of Visitation Books at the College, which contain a wealth of information about all armigerous people from the period.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner 1952, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; If the officers of arms were not presented with sufficient proof of the right to use a coat of arms, they were also empowered to deface monuments which bore these arms and to force persons bearing such arms to sign a disclaimer that they would cease using them. The visitations were not always popular with members of the landed gentry, who were required to present proof of their gentility.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Following the accession of [[William III of England|William III]] in 1689, no further commissions to carry out visitations were commanded. The reasons behind this cessation of the programme have been a matter of debate among historians. Philip Styles, for example, related it to a declining willingness of members of the gentry to attend visitations, which he traced to a growing proportion of "[[parvenu|newly risen]]" families, who lacked long pedigrees and were therefore apathetic about registering them.&lt;ref&gt;Styles 1953.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Janet Verasano has challenged this interpretation, finding that (in Staffordshire, at least) gentry enthusiasm for coats of arms as an enhancement to social standing persisted to the end of the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Verasano 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The end of the visitations did not have much effect on those counties far removed from London, some of which had only been rarely visited over the entire period of the visitations.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

There was never a systematic visitation of Wales. There were four visitations in the principality, and on 9 June 1551, Fulk ap Hywel, [[Lancaster Herald|Lancaster Herald of Arms in Ordinary]] was given a commission to visit all of Wales. This was not carried out, however, as he was degraded and executed for counterfeiting the seal of [[Clarenceux King of Arms]]. This is regrettable, since no visitation of all Wales was ever made by the officers of arms.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Siddons|Michael Powell Siddons]]. ''Visitations by the Heralds in Wales''. (The Harleian Society, London: 1996), v.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Records===

The principal records to emerge from the visitations were pedigrees, initially recorded on loose sheets of paper, and afterwards bound together as notebooks. In some cases, the sheets would include blank shields which had been drawn in advance (or at a later date printed), to simplify the process of recording coats of arms.&lt;ref name="Wag p167"&gt;Wagner 1967, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ailes 2014, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; The persons whose pedigrees were recorded were required (from about 1570 onwards) to certify them by signature, and where these original draft pedigrees have survived they are known as "originals with signatures".&lt;ref&gt;Wagner 1952, pp. 58–9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ailes 2009, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; The signed copies were taken back to the College of Arms, where fair copies were made to a higher standard and preserved as the "office copies".&lt;ref name="Wag p167"/&gt; Sometimes the signed copies were also retained at the College, but in other cases, no longer considered of official interest, they might pass into private hands: once in general circulation, further copies were often made, which might in turn be revised or augmented. As a result, a number of variant manuscript copies of any one visitation record may now survive, possessing varying degrees of accuracy and authority.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner 1952, pp. 24–5, 63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ailes 2014, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Harleian Collection]] of the [[British Library]] is particularly rich in such records. Many visitation records have been published over the years, by the [[Harleian Society]], by county [[Text publication society|record societies]], and a few privately (see [[Heraldic visitation#Published editions|listing below]]). However, because until relatively recently the College of Arms restricted access to its records, many of the older published editions were necessarily based on the unofficial second- or third-generation copies in other collections, and may therefore not always be reliable.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner 1952, pp. 18, 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

From as early as the 1530s, officers of arms on visitation frequently also compiled what were known as "church notes". These were [[fieldnotes]] (usually in the form of sketches) of coats of arms observed on [[English church monuments|church monuments]], in [[stained glass]] windows, or on display in private houses.&lt;ref name="Wag52 pp61-2"&gt;Wagner 1952, pp. 61–2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wagner 1967, p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ailes 2009, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, drawings were also made of non-heraldic antiquities, such as medieval architectural features, views of towns, Roman inscriptions and even [[Stonehenge]].&lt;ref name="Wag52 pp61-2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=T.D. |last=Kendrick |authorlink=T. D. Kendrick |title=British Antiquity |year=1950 |location=London |publisher=Methuen |pages=156–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lankester |first=Philip J. |year=1993 |title=Two lost effigial monuments in Yorkshire and the evidence of church notes |journal=Church Monuments |volume=8 |pages=25–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ailes 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 17th-century visitations generated a growing number of supplementary papers, including warrants, lists of persons who disclaimed any pretence to arms, lists of persons summoned to appear before the heralds (including those who had not appeared), records of fees paid, and miscellaneous correspondence.&lt;ref&gt;For examples, see {{cite book |editor1-first=George |editor1-last=Ireland |editor2-last=Squibb |editor2-first=G.D. |editor2-link=George Drewry Squibb |title=Dugdale's Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Visitation Papers |place=London |series=Harleian Society, new ser. |volume=6 |year=1987 |ISBN=0-9500207-8-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lists of visitations===
Visitations were conducted by or in the name of the two provincial [[King of Arms|Kings of Arms]], [[Clarenceux King of Arms|Clarenceux]] and [[Norroy and Ulster King of Arms|Norroy]], within their respective provinces. In the following lists, the Deputies are the officers of arms who actually carried out the visitations. Where no Deputy is named, the visitation can be assumed to have been conducted by the King of Arms in person.

====Southern Province====
The Southern Province, the jurisdiction of Clarenceux King of Arms, comprised that part of [[England]] south of the [[River Trent]], i.e. the counties of [[Bedfordshire|Bedford]], [[Berkshire|Berks]], [[Buckinghamshire|Buckingham]], [[Cambridgeshire|Cambridge]], [[Cornwall]], [[Devon]], [[Dorset]], [[Essex]], [[Gloucestershire|Gloucester]], [[Herefordshire|Hereford]], [[Hertfordshire|Hertford]], [[Huntingdonshire|Huntingdon]], [[Kent]], [[Leicestershire|Leicester]], [[Lincolnshire|Lincoln]], [[Middlesex]], [[Monmouthshire|Monmouth]], [[Norfolk]], [[Northamptonshire|Northampton]], [[Oxfordshire|Oxford]], [[Rutland]], [[Shropshire|Salop]], [[Somerset]], [[Hampshire|Southampton]], [[Suffolk]], [[Surrey]], [[Sussex]], [[Warwickshire|Warwick]], [[Wiltshire|Wilton]], [[Worcestershire|Worcester]], and the [[City of London]]; and [[South Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;Listings are based on Wagner 1952, pp. 66–77.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Northern Province====
The Northern Province, the jurisdiction of Norroy King of Arms, comprised that part of England north of the River Trent, i.e. the counties of [[Cheshire|Chester]], [[Cumberland]], [[Derbyshire|Derby]], [[County Durham|Durham]], [[Lancashire|Lancaster]], [[Northumberland]], [[Nottinghamshire|Nottingham]], [[Staffordshire|Stafford]], [[Westmorland]] and [[Yorkshire|York]]; and [[North Wales]]. The Trent ran through Staffordshire, and the county was therefore technically divided between the two provinces; but for the purposes of visitation it was generally treated (sometimes through a process of deputation) as falling under the jurisdiction of Norroy.&lt;ref&gt;Listings are based on Wagner 1952, pp. 77–84.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visitations in Ireland==
{{Refimprove|date=May 2016}}
Since the practices of [[Ulster King of Arms]] so closely followed those of the English College of Arms, it is hardly surprising that the Irish officers of arms undertook heraldic visitations in their province. The purpose behind these visitations was twofold: to prevent the assumption of arms by unqualified people, and to record the arms of the gentry that were unknown to Ulster office. The first visitation was held by [[Nicholas Narbon]], the second [[Ulster King of Arms]], in 1569. He was authorized to reform practices which were contrary to good armorial practice. He conducted six visitations ([[Dublin]] in 1568&amp;ndash;1573, [[Drogheda]] and [[Ardee]] in 1570, Dublin in 1572, [[Swords, Dublin|Swords]] in 1572, [[Cork (city)|Cork]] in 1574, and [[Limerick]] in 1574). One of his successors, [[Daniel Molyneux]] had the commission renewed, and mounted several visitations. Although Molyneux's last visitation – of [[Wexford]] – was the last proper visitation, two other expeditions occurred after 1618 by subsequent Ulster Kings of Arms. The visitations were not very extensive. The officers would not often be found in the disturbed countryside. Thus the visitations are confined to areas under firm control of the [[Dublin]] administration.

Today, the original visitation and related manuscripts are in the custody of the [[Chief Herald of Ireland]]. Copies are also deposited at the College of Arms in London.

An institutional repository can be viewed as a "...a set of services that a university offers to members of its community for the management and dissemination of digital materials created by the institution and its community members."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lynch|first1=Clifford |title=Institutional Repositories: Essential Infrastructure for Scholarship in the Digital Age|url= http://www.arl.org/storage/documents/publications/arl-br-226.pdf |publisher=Association of Research Libraries |accessdate=17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a [[university]], this includes materials such as [[monographs]], [[eprint]]s of [[academic journal]] articles—both before ([[preprint]]s) and after ([[postprints]]) undergoing [[peer review]]—as well as electronic [[thesis|theses]] and dissertations. An institutional repository might also include other [[digital asset]]s generated by academics, such as datasets, administrative documents, course notes, [[learning object]]s, or [[conference proceedings]]. Deposit of material in an institutional repository is sometimes mandated by that institution.

Some of the main objectives for having an institutional repository are to provide [[open access]] to institutional research output by [[self-archiving]] in an [[open access repository]], to create global visibility for an institution's scholarly research, and to store and preserve other institutional digital assets, including unpublished or otherwise easily lost ("[[grey literature|grey]]") literature such as theses, working papers or technical reports.

==Origins==
Digital institutional repositories are document servers enabling researchers to [[archive]] their research output.&lt;ref name="Open access infrastructure"&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Smith | first1 = Ina| title = Open access infrastructure| publisher = UNESCO Publishing| date = 2015| pages = 7| url = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?catno=232204&amp;gp=1&amp;mode=e&amp;lin=1| isbn = 978-92-3-100075-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Worldwide institutions are starting to implement digital institutional repositories for [[digital formats]] of research. Scholarly output can be [[born-digital]], in which no [[digitalisation]] is necessary before the research is included in a digital repository.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Smith | first1 = Ina| title = Open access infrastructure| publisher = UNESCO Publishing| date = 2015| pages = 19| url = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?catno=232204&amp;gp=1&amp;mode=e&amp;lin=1| isbn = 978-92-3-100075-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A digital institutional repository accessible through the Internet can improve the visibility, usage and impact of research conducted at an institution.&lt;ref name="unesdoc.unesco.org"&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Smith | first1 = Ina| title = Open access infrastructure| publisher = UNESCO Publishing| date = 2015| pages = 20| url = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?catno=232204&amp;gp=1&amp;mode=e&amp;lin=1| isbn = 978-92-3-100075-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of the notion of an institutional repository are twofold:
* Institutional repositories are partly linked to the notion of digital [[interoperability]], which is in turn linked to the [[Open Archives Initiative]] (OAI) and its [[Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting]] (OAI-PMH). The OAI in turn had its roots in the notion of a "Universal Preprint Service",&lt;ref name="eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk"/&gt; since superseded by the [[open access]] movement.
* Institutional repositories are partly linked to the notion of a [[digital library]]—i.e., collecting, housing, classifying, cataloguing, curating, preserving, and providing access to digital content—analogous with the library's conventional function of collecting, housing classifying, curating, preserving and providing access to analog content.

In 2003 the function of an institutional repository was coined by [[Clifford Lynch]] in relation to universities. He argued that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"... a university-based institutional repository is a set of services that a university offers to the members of its community for the management and dissemination of digital materials created by the institution and its community members. It is most essentially an organizational commitment to the stewardship of these digital materials, including long-term preservation where appropriate, as well as organization and access or distribution."&lt;ref name="Open access infrastructure"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Besides archiving research output institutional repositories can perform the functions such as [[knowledge management]], research assessment and showcasing an institution's research output.&lt;ref name="unesdoc.unesco.org"/&gt;

The content of an institutional repository depends on the focus of the institution. Higher education institutions conduct research across multiple disciplines, thus research from a variety of [[Discipline (academia)|academic subjects]]. Examples of such digital institutional repositories include the MIT Institutional Repository. A [[disciplinary repository]] is subject specific. It holds and provides access to scholarly research in a particular discipline. While there can be disciplinary repositories for one institution, disciplinary repositories are frequently not tied to a specific institution. The PsyDok digital repository for example holds German language research in psychology. SSOAR is an international social science full text-server.&lt;ref name="Open access infrastructure"/&gt;

==Open access repositories==
:''See also: [[:Category:Open access by country|Open access by country]]''
Institutional repositories that provide access to research to users outside the institutional community are one of the recommended ways to achieve the [[open access]] vision described in the [[Budapest Open Access Initiative]] definition of open access. This is sometimes referred to as the [[self-archiving]] or "green" route to open access.

Repository 66 is a [[Mashup (web application hybrid)|mashup]] that indicates the worldwide locations of open access digital repositories. It is based on data provided by [[Registry of Open Access Repositories|ROAR]] and the [[OpenDOAR]] service developed by [[SHERPA (organisation)|SHERPA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lewis|first=Stuart|title=About|url=http://maps.repository66.org/about/|work=Repository 66 Map Blog|accessdate=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Developing an institutional repository==
An institutional repository has been understood as a means to ensure that the published work of scholars is available to the academic community even after increases in subscription fees or budget cuts within libraries. The majority of research scholars do not provide free access to their research output to their colleagues in an organization. Institutional repositories provide scholars with a common platform so that everyone in the institution can contribute scholarly material to promote cross-campus interdisciplinary research. The development of an institutional repository redefines the production and dissemination of scholarly material within an academic community. The contents available on the institute’s website usually are removed after a few weeks. An institutional repository can provide a platform to manage institutional information, including web content. Institutional repositories have a number of benefits, including access to resources, visibility of research, and presentations of the contents.&lt;ref&gt;Bhardwaj, Raj Kumar. "Institutional Repository Literature: A Bibliometric Analysis." Science &amp; Technology Libraries ahead-of-print (2014): 1-18&lt;/ref&gt;

If an institution has decided to invest in a repository numerous resources exist to help librarians and other repository managers frame and answer such questions, including "A Librarian's Process for Building an Institutional Repository",&lt;ref&gt;Stezano, Leo (March 2016). A Librarian’s Process for Building an Institutional Repository. Elsevier Library Connect https://libraryconnect.elsevier.com/sites/default/files/ELS-LC_IR_process.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Software==
The major institutional repository software platforms use a common open standard called [[Protocol for Metadata Harvesting|OAI-PMH]]. This standard makes it not just possible to collect and move research output from one platform to another.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

While a majority of the institutions run institutional repository software on local servers,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.opendoar.org/onechart.php?cID=&amp;ctID=&amp;rtID=&amp;clID=&amp;lID=&amp;potID=&amp;rSoftWareName=&amp;search=&amp;groupby=r.rSoftWareName&amp;orderby=Tally%2520DESC&amp;charttype=pie&amp;width=600&amp;height=300&amp;caption=Usage%2520of%2520Open%2520Access%2520Repository%2520Software%2520-%2520Worldwide |title=OpenDOAR Chart - Usage%20of%20Open%20Access%20Repository%20Software%20-%20Worldwide |website=OpenDOAR |access-date=2016-05-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160325152831/http://opendoar.org/onechart.php?cID=&amp;ctID=&amp;rtID=&amp;clID=&amp;lID=&amp;potID=&amp;rSoftWareName=&amp;search=&amp;groupby=r.rSoftWareName&amp;orderby=Tally%20DESC&amp;charttype=pie&amp;width=600&amp;height=300&amp;caption=Usage%20of%20Open%20Access%20Repository%20Software%20-%20Worldwide |archivedate=March 25, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; among new adopters, there is a strong preference towards cloud-based services.  A survey commissioned by Duraspace found that 72% of respondents indicated that their institutional repository is a hosted service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dlib.org/dlib/march15/bishoff/03bishoff.html|title=Managing Digital Collections Survey Results|website=www.dlib.org|access-date=2016-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Institutions are choosing cloud-based solutions because such providers "enable institutions to easily get started with a hosted software service, with no need to provision local hardware, software, staff, or other infrastructure nor is there any specific technical skill or expertise required".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.duraspace.org/managing-digital-collections-survey-results-summary|title=Managing Digital Collections Survey Results Summary {{!}} DuraSpace|website=www.duraspace.org|access-date=2016-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also important to the decision to go hosted may be the understanding that a hosted institutional repository solution "frees a library from both hardware and software support, allowing staff resources to be directed to other publishing service functions such as consulting and workflow design."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arl.org/bm~doc/research-library-publishing-services.pdf|title=Search Publications {{!}} Association of Research Libraries® {{!}} ARL®|website=www.arl.org|access-date=2016-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aggregators==
The [[Confederation of Open Access Repositories]] (COAR) states in its manifesto that "Each individual repository is of limited value for research: the real power of Open Access lies in the possibility of connecting and tying together repositories, which is why we need interoperability. In order to create a seamless layer of content through connected repositories from around the world, open access relies on interoperability, the ability for systems to communicate with each other and pass information back and forth in a usable format. Interoperability allows us to exploit today's computational power so that we can aggregate, data mine, create new tools and services, and generate new knowledge from repository content."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Case for Interoperability for Open Access Repositories|url=http://www.coar-repositories.org/files/A-Case-for-Interoperability-Final-Version.pdf|work=COAR|publisher=COAR|accessdate=24 September 2013|page=2|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interoperability is achieved in the world of institutional repositories using protocols to which repositories should conform, such as OAI-PMH. This allows search engines and open access aggregators, such as [[BASE (search engine)|BASE]] and [[COnnecting REpositories|CORE]], to index repository metadata and content and provide value-added services on top of this content.&lt;ref name="Knoth, P. and Zdrahal"&gt;Knoth, P. &amp; Zdrahal, Z. (2012). [https://dx.doi.org/10.1045/november2012-knoth CORE: Three Access Levels to Underpin Open Access] D-Lib Magazine, 18, 11/12, ''Corporation for National Research Initiatives''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Digital Commons Network aggregates by discipline some 500 institutional repositories running on the [[Bepress]] [[Digital Commons]] platform. It includes more that two million full-text objects.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2920">'''Israelization''' ({{lang-he|ישראליזציה}}; Other English spellings: '''Israelification''' or '''Israelisation''') is a term in [[sociology]], study of culture, and [[politics of Israel]] that refers to the processes occurring among minority groups in [[Israel]]. A process in which minority groups adopt, at various levels, the lifestyle, language, culture, political and other characteristics of the dominant group in Israel – [[Sabra (person)|Israeli-born]] [[Hiloni|secular Jews]].

The term is mostly used to describe the changes in the lifestyle and culture of the [[Arab citizens of Israel]] since Israel's creation.&lt;ref&gt;אלחאג', מג'ד, "זהות ואוריינטציה בקרב הערבים בישראל: מצב של פריפריה כפולה", בתוך: ''השסע היהודי ערבי בישראל: מקראה'', בעריכת רות גביזון ודפנה הקר. 2000. עמ' 13-33.&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, the term "Palestinization" is used to describe the opposite process – resistance from being overtaken by Israelisation proponents  and strengthening political and cultural ties with Palestinians living beyond the [[Green Line (Israel)|Green Line]]. However, sociologist Majid Al-Haj suggests these are not contradictory processes, and that there is an emergence of two parallel identities among Arab citizens of Israel which he called "Politicization".&lt;ref&gt;אלחאג', מג'ד, "זהות ואוריינטציה בקרב הערבים בישראל: מצב של פריפריה כפולה", בתוך: ''השסע היהודי ערבי בישראל: מקראה'', בעריכת רות גביזון ודפנה הקר. 2000. עמ' 13-33.&lt;/ref&gt; The equivalent term in Arabic is "Asralah" (أسرلة) derived from the name of "Israel" in Arabic (إسرائيل - Aisraail).

Israelization has been noted amongst the [[Druze in Israel|Druze community in Israel]]. One study noted a trend whereas the post-1950 Druze generation the younger the generation is, the likelier that there is a preference for Hebrew instead of Arabic with many younger Druze using social media having a near absence of Arabic usage amongst other Druze peers.&lt;ref&gt;https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/ETD-UT-2012-05-5033&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "Israelization" is also used occasionally to describe the social and political changes in [[Haredi]] society in Israel, in particular to describe integration into the Israeli political system, their increasing use of the general media in the [[Hebrew]] language, integration into the Israeli labor market etc. In addition, it is sometimes used to describe the assimilation of Jewish immigrants to Israel ([[Aliyah]]) among the native-born Israelis and amongst the veterans Jewish immigrants.

The fictional '''Land of Oz''' is a [[fantasy world|magical country]] first introduced in the classic children's novel ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' (1900).

Oz consists of four vast quadrants, the [[Gillikin Country]] in the north, [[Quadling Country]] in the south, [[Munchkin Country]] in the east and [[Winkie Country]] in the west. Each province has its own ruler, but the realm itself has always been ruled by a single monarch. After ''[[The Marvelous Land of Oz]]'', this monarch is [[Princess Ozma]].

Originally, Baum did not intend for ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz'' to have any sequels, but it achieved a greater popularity than any of the other fairylands he created, including the land of [[Merryland (Oz)|Merryland]] in Baum's children's novel ''[[Dot and Tot of Merryland|Dot and Tot in Merryland]]'', written a year later. Due to Oz's worldwide success, Baum decided to return to it four years after ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz'' was published. For the next two decades, he described and expanded upon the land in [[List of Oz books|the Oz Books]],&lt;ref&gt;James Thurber, "The Wizard of Chitenango", in ''Fantasists on Fantasy'', edited by Robert H. Boyer and Kenneth J. Zahorski, New York, Avon, 1984;  pp. 64–65. {{ISBN|0-380-86553-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; a series which introduced many fictional characters and creatures. Baum intended to end the series with the sixth Oz book ''[[The Emerald City of Oz]]'' (1910), in which Oz is forever sealed off and made invisible to the outside world, but this did not sit well with fans, and he quickly abandoned the idea, writing eight more successful Oz books, and even naming himself the "Royal Historian of Oz."&lt;ref name="Thurber p. 66"&gt;Thurber, "The Wizard of Chitenango", p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

In all, Baum wrote fourteen best-selling [[children's books]] about Oz and its enchanted inhabitants, as well as a spin off-series of [[Little Wizard Stories of Oz|six early readers]]. After his death in 1919, author [[Ruth Plumly Thompson]], illustrator [[John R. Neill]] (who had previously collaborated with Baum on his Oz books) and several other writers and artists continued the series. There are now over 50 novels based upon Baum's original Oz saga.

Baum characterized Oz as a real place, unlike [[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|MGM's 1939 musical movie adaptation]], which presents it as a dream of lead character [[Dorothy Gale]]. According to the Oz books, it is a hidden fairyland cut off from the rest of the world by the [[Deadly Desert]].&lt;ref&gt;L. Frank Baum, ''The Annotated Wizard of Oz'', edited by [[Michael Patrick Hearn]], New York, Crown, 1976; p. 96. {{ISBN|0-517-50086-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The canonical [[demonym]] for Oz is "Ozite". The term appears in ''Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz'', ''The Road to Oz'', and ''The Emerald City of Oz''. Elsewhere in the canon, "Ozmie" is also used. In the animated 1974 semi-sequel to the MGM film, ''[[Journey Back to Oz]]'', "Ozonian" is used. The term "Ozian" appears in the script for the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]]'s stage adaptation of the MGM movie and in the non-canonical modern work ''[[Wicked (musical)|Wicked]]''. "Ozmite" was used in [[Reilly &amp; Lee]] marketing in the 1920s, which has suggested to some critics that "Ozmie" may have been a [[typographical error]].

==Characteristics==
Oz is, in the first book ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'', distinguished from Dorothy's native Kansas by not being civilized; this explains why Kansas does not have witches and wizards, while Oz does.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Michael O. Riley, ''Oz and Beyond: The Fantasy World of L. Frank Baum'', Lawrence, KS, University Press of Kansas, 1997; p. 53. {{ISBN|0-7006-0832-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the third book, ''[[Ozma of Oz]]'', Oz is described as a "fairy country", new terminology that remained to explain its wonders.&lt;ref&gt;Riley, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==

===The Land of Oz===
[[File:Map-of-Oz.jpg|thumb|right|400px|The Land of Oz; note that the map is a mirror image of "actual" locations, but that the compass rose shows east on the right-hand side.]]

Oz is roughly rectangular in shape, and divided along the diagonals into four countries: [[Munchkin Country]] (but commonly referred to as 'Munchkinland' in adaptations) in the East, [[Winkie Country]]  in the West (sometimes West and East are reversed on maps of Oz, see [[Land of Oz#West and East|West and East]] below), [[Gillikin Country]] in the North, and [[Quadling Country]] in the South. In the center of Oz, where the diagonals cross, is the fabled [[Emerald City]], capital of the land of Oz and seat to the monarch of Oz, [[Princess Ozma]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', New York, St. Martin's Griffin, 1999; "Oz", p. 739. {{ISBN|0-312-19869-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The regions have a color schema: blue for Munchkins, yellow for Winkies, red for Quadlings, green for the Emerald City, and (in works after the first) purple for the Gillikins, which region was also not named in the first book.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;Riley, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;  (This contrasts with Kansas; Baum, describing it, used "gray" nine times in four paragraphs.&lt;ref&gt;''The Annotated Wizard of Oz'', p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;) In ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz'', this is merely the [[favorite color]], used for clothing and other man-made objects, and having some influence on their choice of crops, but the basic colors of the world are natural colors.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; The effect is less consistent in later works. In ''[[The Marvelous Land of Oz]]'', the book states that everything in the land of the Gillikins is purple, including the plants and mud, and a character can see that he is leaving when the grass turns from purple to green, but it also describes pumpkins as orange and corn as green in that land.&lt;ref&gt;Riley, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Baum, indeed, never used the color schema consistently; in many books, he alluded to the colors to orient the characters and readers to their location, and then did not refer to it again.&lt;ref name="Riley, p. 106"&gt;Riley, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; His most common technique was to depict the man-made articles and flowers as the color of the country, leaving leaves, grass, and fruit their natural colors.&lt;ref&gt;Riley, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of these regions are settled with prosperous and contented people. However, this naturally is lacking in scope for plot. Numerous pockets throughout the Land of Oz are cut off from the main culture, for geographic or cultural reasons. Many have never heard of Ozma, making it impossible for them to acknowledge her as their rightful queen. These regions are concentrated around the edges of the country, and constitute the main settings for books that are set entirely within Oz.&lt;ref&gt;Riley, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Lost Princess of Oz]]'', for instance is set entirely in rough country in Winkie Country, between two settled areas.&lt;ref&gt;Riley, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Glinda of Oz]]'', Ozma speaks of her duty to discover all these stray corners of Oz.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;Riley, p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz'', a [[yellow brick road]] leads from the lands of the Munchkins to the Emerald City. Other such roads featured in other works: one from Gillikin Country in ''The Marvelous Land of Oz'', and a second one from Munchkin Land in ''The Patchwork Girl of Oz''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Annotated Wizard of Oz'', p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

Oz is completely surrounded on all four sides by a desert which insulates the citizens of the Land of Oz from discovery and invasion. In the first two books, this is merely a natural desert, with only its extent making it dangerous to the traveler, but in ''The Road to Oz'' it is said to turn anyone who touches it to sand.&lt;ref&gt;''The Annotated Wizard of Oz'', p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, in ''The Marvelous Land of Oz'', Mombi tries to escape through it and Glinda chases her over the sands. Still, it is the dividing land between the magic of Oz and the outside world, and the [[Winged monkeys|Winged Monkeys]] can not obey Dorothy's command to carry her home because it would take them outside the lands of Oz.&lt;ref&gt;''The Annotated Wizard of Oz'', p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Ozma of Oz]]'', it has become a magical desert called the [[Deadly Desert]] with life-destroying sands and noxious fumes, a feature that remained constant through the rest of the series, although no actual destruction is depicted in the Oz books, unlike in the film ''[[Return to Oz]]''.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7&gt;Riley, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; The desert has nonetheless been breached numerous times, both by children from our world (mostly harmless), by the Wizard of Oz himself, and by more sinister characters, such as the [[Nome King]], who attempted to conquer Oz. After such an attempt in ''[[The Emerald City of Oz]]'', the book ends with [[Glinda]] creating a barrier of invisibility around the Land of Oz, for further protection.&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', "Oz", p. 740.&lt;/ref&gt; This was, indeed, an earnest effort on Baum's part to end the series, but the insistence of readers meant the continuation of the series, and therefore the discovery of many ways for people to pass through this barrier as well as over the sands.&lt;ref name="Thurber p. 66"/&gt; Despite this continual evasion, the barrier itself remained; nowhere in any Oz book did Baum hint that the inhabitants were even considering removing the magical barrier.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;

===West and East===
The first known map of Oz was a glass slide used in Baum's ''Fairylogue and Radio-Play'' traveling show, showing the blue land of the Munchkins in the east and the yellow land of the Winkies in the west. These directions are confirmed by the text of all of Baum's Oz books, especially the first, in which the [[Wicked Witch of the East]] rules over the [[Munchkin]]s, and the [[Wicked Witch of the West]] rules over the [[Winkie Country|Winkies]].

Like traditional western maps, the ''Fairylogue and Radio-Play'' map showed the west on the left, and the east on the right. However, the first map of Oz to appear in an Oz book had those directions reversed, and the [[compass rose]] adjusted accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;Riley, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that this is a result of Baum copying the map from the wrong side of the glass slide, effectively getting a mirror image of his intended map. When he realized he was copying the slide backward, he reversed the compass rose to make the directions correct. However, an editor at Reilly and Lee reversed the compass rose, thinking he was fixing an error, and resulting in further confusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Eric P. Gjovaag| year=| title=Wizard of Oz – Frequently Asked Questions – About the Land of Oz| format= | work= | url=http://www.eskimo.com/~tiktok/faq04.html#4 | accessdate = 2007-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most notably, this confused Ruth Plumly Thompson, who frequently reversed directions in her own Oz books as a result.

Another speculation stems from the original conception of Oz, which at first appeared to be situated in an American desert. If Baum thought of the country of the Munchkins as the nearest region to him, it would have been in the east while he lived in Chicago, but when he moved to California, it would have been in the west.&lt;ref&gt;Riley, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern maps of Oz are almost universally drawn with the Winkies in the west and the Munchkins in the east, although west and east often appear reversed. Many Oz fans believe this is the correct orientation, perhaps as a result of Glinda's spell, which has the effect of confusing most standard compasses; perhaps resembling its similarity to the world Alice found [[through the looking glass]] in which everything was a mirror image; or perhaps just reflecting the alien nature of Oz. In [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s book ''[[The Number of the Beast (novel)|The Number of the Beast]]'' he posits that Oz is on a [[retrograde and direct motion|retrograde]] planet, meaning that it spins in the opposite direction of Earth so that the sun seems to rise on one's left as one faces north. [[March Laumer]]'s ''The Magic Mirror of Oz'' attributes the changes to a character named Till Orangespiegel attempting to turn the Land of Oz orange.

===Location===
Oz, like all of Baum's fantasy countries, was presented as existing as part of the real world, albeit protected from civilization by natural barriers.&lt;ref&gt;Riley, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, in the first books, nothing indicated that it was not hidden in the deserts of the United States.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; It gradually acquired neighboring magical countries, often from works of Baum's that had been independent, as [[Ix (Oz)|Ix]] from ''[[Queen Zixi of Ix]]'', and [[Mo (Oz)|Mo]] from ''[[The Magical Monarch of Mo]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Riley, p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these is [[Land of Ev|Ev]], introduced in ''[[Ozma of Oz]]''.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt;

[[File:Oz-and-surrounding-countrie.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Oz and surrounding countries, on the map from ''[[Tik-Tok of Oz]]'' (The directional indicator in the map's corner shows North and South correctly, but it flips East to the left, and West to the right).]]
In ''[[Tik-Tok of Oz]]'', Baum included maps in the endpapers which definitively situated Oz on a continent with its neighboring countries.&lt;ref&gt;Riley, pp. 186–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Oz is the largest country on the continent unofficially known as [[Nonestica]] (this name was proposed by Robert R. Pattrick for the whole of the countries surrounding Oz; Pattrick proposed "Ozeria" for the whole continent,&lt;ref&gt;Robert R. Pattrick, "Oz Geography," ''[[The Baum Bugle]]'', Vol. 3 No. 1 (May 1959) to Vol. 4 No. 1 (May 1960).&lt;/ref&gt; but that name is generally unused in fan discussions), which also includes the countries of Ev, Ix, and Mo, which has also been known as Phunniland, among others. Nonestica is, according to the map, in the [[Nonestic Ocean]]. A fair amount of evidence in the books point to this continent as being envisioned as somewhere in the southern [[Pacific Ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Annotated Wizard of Oz'', p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; At the opening of ''[[Ozma of Oz]],'' [[Dorothy Gale]] is sailing to [[Australia]] with her [[Uncle Henry (Oz)|Uncle Henry]] when she is washed overboard (in a chicken coop, with [[Billina]] the yellow hen), and lands on the shore of Ev—a rare instance in which an outsider reaches the Oz landmass through non-magical (or ''apparently'' non-magical) means. Palm trees grow outside the Royal Palace in the Emerald City, and horses are not native to Oz, both points of consistency with a South-Pacific location; illustrations and descriptions of round-shaped and domed Ozite houses suggest a non-Western architecture. Conversely, Oz has technological, architectural, and urban elements typical of Europe and North America around the turn of the twentieth century; but this may involve cultural input from unusual external sources (see History below). Ruth Plumly Thompson asserts in her first Oz book, ''[[The Royal Book of Oz]]'', that the language of Oz is English, which also suggests European or American influence.

An argument against the South Pacific is that the seasons in Oz are shown as the same seasons in the United States at the same time. In addition, in ''[[The Wishing Horse of Oz]]'', [[Pigasus (literature)|Pigasus]] follows the [[North Star]] when he flies to Thunder Mountain, which could only be done in the Northern Hemisphere.

===Inspiration===
Baum's creation of the Emerald City may have been inspired by the White City of the [[World Columbian Exposition]], which he visited frequently. Its quick building, in less than a year, may have been an element in the quick construction of the Emerald City in the first book.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;Riley, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schematically, Oz is much like the United States, with the Emerald City taking the place of Chicago: to the East, mixed forest and farmland; to the West, treeless plains and fields of wheat; to the South, warmth and lush growth, and red earth.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt;

Ruth Plumly Thompson took a different direction with her Oz books, introducing European elements such as the title character of ''[[The Yellow Knight of Oz]]'', a knight straight out of [[Arthurian Legend]].

===Witches and wizards===
[[File:Wicked Witch2.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The [[Wicked Witch of the West]] melts, from the [[William Wallace Denslow]] illustration in the first edition of ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' (1900)]]
At the time of ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'', the lands in the North, South, East and West of Oz are each ruled by a [[Witchcraft|Witch]]. The Witches of the North and South are good, while the Witches of the East and West are wicked. [[Glinda the Good Witch|Glinda]] (the Good Witch of the South) is later revealed to be the most powerful of the four, although later Oz books reveal that the [[Wicked Witch of the West]] was so powerful, even Glinda feared her. After Dorothy's house crushes the [[Wicked Witch of the East]], thereby liberating the Munchkins from bondage, the [[Good Witch of the North]] tells Dorothy that she (the Witch of the North) is not as powerful as the Wicked Witch of the East had been, or she would have freed the Munchkins herself.

During the first scene in Oz in ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz'', the Good Witch of the North (Locasta or Tattypoo) explains to Dorothy that Oz still has witches and wizards, not being civilized, and goes on to explain that witches and wizards can be both good and evil, unlike the evil witches that Dorothy had been told of.&lt;ref&gt;''The Annotated Wizard of Oz'', p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;  That book contained only the four witches (besides the humbug wizard), but despite Ozma's prohibition on magic, many more magicians feature in later works.

Baum tended to capitalize the word "Witch" when referring to the Witches of the North, South, East or West, but did not do so when referring to witches in general. For example, in the aforementioned first scene of ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz'', Locasta (or Tattypoo) thanks Dorothy for killing the "Wicked Witch of the East", and introduces herself as "the Witch of the North", with the word "Witch" capitalized in both cases. However, when she goes on to tell Dorothy that "I [the Witch of the North] am a good witch, and the people love me", the word "witch" is not capitalized.

White is the traditional color of witches in Oz. The Good Witch of the North wears a pointed white hat and a white gown decorated with stars, while Glinda, the Good Witch of the South (called a "sorceress" in later books), wears a pure white dress. Dorothy is taken for a witch not only because she had killed the Wicked Witch of the East, but because her dress is blue and white checked.&lt;ref&gt;''The Annotated Wizard of Oz'', p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ozma, once on the throne, prohibits the use of magic by anyone other than [[Glinda]] the Good, the [[Wizard of Oz (character)|Wizard of Oz]], and herself – as, earlier, the Good Witch of the North had prohibited magic by any other witch in her domains.&lt;ref&gt;Riley, pp. 177–8.&lt;/ref&gt; The illicit use of magic is a frequent feature of villains in later works in the series, appearing in ''[[The Scarecrow of Oz]]'', ''[[Rinkitink in Oz]]'', ''[[The Lost Princess of Oz]]'', ''[[The Tin Woodman of Oz]]'', and ''[[The Magic of Oz]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Zipes, ''When Dreams Came True: Classical Fairy Tales and Their Tradition'', London, Routledge, 1998; pp. 180–1. {{ISBN|0-415-92151-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animals===
There are different kinds of animals living in Oz. According to Baum, all animals in Oz have the ability to speak because it is a "fairy" kingdom. When asked by his readers why Dorothy's dog [[Toto (Oz)|Toto]] did not speak, Baum insisted that he had the ability to, but did not choose to speak, but he finally does so in ''[[Tik-Tok of Oz]]''.

Among the many animals in Oz are:

There is a multitude of other races living in the land of Oz, many of which only appear once. Among the known races are:

* '''The Bun People of Bunbury''' – The Bun People are made of baked goods.

Outside of them are many other strange races who are often found living in the wilderness of Oz. Despite the overlordship of Ozma, many of the communities live autonomously. Oz has great tolerance for eccentricity and oddness.&lt;ref&gt;Zipes, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many characters in Oz are animated objects. Such figures as the Glass Cat, the [[Scarecrow (Oz)|Scarecrow]], [[Jack Pumpkinhead]], the [[List of Oz characters (created by Baum)#Sawhorse|Sawhorse]], and others are common.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; Entire regions are the homes of such animated beings. The Dainty China Country is entirely filled with creatures made of china, who would freeze into figurines if removed. The China Princess lives in fear of breaking because she would never be as pretty again, even if repaired.&lt;ref&gt;''The Annotated Wizard of Oz'', p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other characters are highly individual, even unique members of a species. Many such people from the outer worlds find refuge in Oz, which is highly tolerant of eccentricity.&lt;ref&gt;Riley, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Prehistory===
The history of Oz prior to ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz'' (often called the prehistory of Oz as it takes place before Baum's "histories") is often the subject of dispute, as Baum himself gave conflicting accounts. In ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz'', the title character recounts that he was a ventriloquist and a circus balloonist from [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]], and during one flight the rope for his [[Hot air balloons#Vents|parachute vent]] became tangled, preventing him from descending until the next morning, and he awoke to find that he was floating over a strange land. When he landed, the people thought he was a great wizard because of his ability to fly. He did not disabuse them of this notion, and with his new power over them, he had them build a city with a palace in the center of Oz. He also ordered them to wear green glasses so it would appear to be made entirely of emeralds.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"/&gt; However, in the later Oz books the city is depicted as actually being made of emerald or other green materials.&lt;ref name="Riley, p. 106"/&gt; The Wizard was a young man when he first arrived in Oz, and grew old while he was there.&lt;ref name="Riley, p. 146"&gt;Riley, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; Afraid of the Wicked Witches of the West and the East, who, unlike him, could do real magic, the Wizard hid away in a room of his palace and refused to see visitors. He lived in this way until the arrival of Dorothy in the first book.

In ''[[The Marvelous Land of Oz]]'' the prehistory was changed slightly. Glinda, the Good Witch of the South, reveals that the Wizard usurped the previous king of Oz [[Pastoria]] and hid away his daughter Ozma. This was Baum's reaction to the popular 1903 Broadway extravaganza Baum adapted from his book, ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz'', in which the Wizard took the role of the main antagonist and the Wicked Witch of the West was left out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | year=| title=Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz| format= | work= | url=http://www.pumperdink.org/BCF/DorothyAndTheWizardInOz.html#letter100 | accessdate = 2011-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Wizard, however, had been more popular with his readers than he thought. In ''[[Ozma of Oz]]'', he omitted any mention of the Wizard's having usurped the throne of Ozma's father,&lt;ref&gt;Riley, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; but the largest changes occurred in the next book.

In the preface to ''[[Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz]]'', Baum remarks that the Wizard had turned out to be a popular character with the children who had read the first book and so he brought the Wizard back. During it, the Wizard relates yet another account of his history in Oz, telling Ozma that his birth name was Oscar Zoroaster Phadrig Isaac Norman Henkle Emmanuel Ambroise Diggs, which, being a very long and cumbersome name, and as his other initials spelled out "PINHEAD," he preferred to leave just as O.Z. The balloon part of his story was unchanged, except for the detail added by Ozma, that the people probably saw his initials on his balloon and took them as a message that he was to be their king. She relates that the country was already named Oz (a word which in their language means "great and good"), and that it was typical for the rulers to have names that are variations of Oz (King Pastoria being a notable exception to this rule).

Ozma elaborates further, saying that there were once four Wicked Witches in Oz, who leagued together to depose the King, but the Wicked Witches of the North and South were defeated by Good Witches before the Wizard arrived in Oz. According to this version, the King at the time was Ozma's grandfather. This version of prehistory restores the Wizard's reputation,&lt;ref name="Riley, p. 146"/&gt;  but adds the awkwardness of both Ozma and her father having been born in captivity.

In ''[[The Tin Woodman of Oz]]'' Baum writes how Oz came to be a fairyland:
:''Oz was not always a fairyland, I am told. Once it was much like other lands, except it was shut in by a dreadful desert of sandy wastes that lay all around it, thus preventing its people from all contact with the rest of the world. Seeing this isolation, the fairy band of [[Queen Lurline]], passing over Oz while on a journey, enchanted the country and so made it a Fairyland. And Queen Lurline left one of her fairies to rule this enchanted Land of Oz, and then passed on and forgot all about it.''
Thenceforward, no one in Oz would ever age, get sick, or die. After becoming a fairyland, Oz harbored many Witches, Magicians, and Sorcerers until the time when Ozma made magic illegal without a permit. In yet another inconsistency, it is implied that Ozma was the fairy left behind by Queen Lurline to rule the country, contradicting the story where she was Pastoria's daughter. This is later confirmed in ''[[Glinda of Oz]]'':

:''"If you are really Princess Ozma of Oz," the Flathead said, "you are one of that band of fairies who, under Queen Lurline, made all Oz a Fairyland. I have heard that Lurline left one of her own fairies to rule Oz, and gave the fairy the name of Ozma."''
While this explains why no one dies or ages, and nevertheless there are people of differing ages in Oz, it is completely inconsistent with the earlier versions of the prehistory.&lt;ref&gt;Riley, pp. 216–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maguire, author of ''[[Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West|Wicked]]'' addresses this inconsistency by saying that the people of Oz believe that Ozma is reincarnated—that her spirit was left behind by Lurline, but her body is reborn to different mortal queens.

In [[Jack Snow (writer)|Jack Snow]]'s ''[[The Magical Mimics in Oz]]'', the prehistory story is retold. This version relates that Ozma was given to the king of Oz as an adoptive daughter, for he was old and had no children.

In the Magic Land stories of Alexander Melentyevich Volkov, the prehistory is quite different. The land was created 6,000–7,000&amp;nbsp;years ago by a wizard named Hurricap, who was tired of people coming to him with requests, so he decided to find a place without them annoying him. He found a remote land and separated it from the rest of the world, along with putting the enchantments of eternal spring and talking animals (Volkov's version doesn't include any forms of immortality). However, he failed to notice that the land already contained people (since he was a giant, already suffering from nearsightedness in his advanced age, and the people in the Magic Land were much shorter than in other places), but, upon discovering the fact, decided that removing the enchantments would be unnecessary. Instead, he ordered the people to keep away from his castle. After that, the notable events included a conquest attempt by a sorceress named Arachna (Gurrikap was still alive, and put her in an enchanted sleep for 5,000&amp;nbsp;years. Her awakening formed the story for the fifth book in Volkov's series), an unsuccessful coup by a prince named Bofaro to overthrow his father about 1,000&amp;nbsp;years ago (He and his accomplices were banished to a cave and became the Magic Land's main source of metal and gems, an analogue to the Nomes), and the arrival of the Four Witches (which only occurred about 500&amp;nbsp;years ago in this continuity).

===History through the first six books===
Eventually, Dorothy Gale and her whole house are blown into Oz from [[Kansas]] by a tornado.  When the house lands, it crushes the [[Wicked Witch of the East]] (in Gregory Maguire's book, ''[[Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West]]'', she is given a name, Nessarose), ruler of the [[Munchkin]]s. In an attempt to get back to her home, she journeys to the Emerald City. Along the way, she meets the [[Tin Woodman]], the [[Cowardly Lion]], and the [[Scarecrow (Oz)|Scarecrow]], all of whom accompany her. Once there, they become the first people to gain an audience with the Wizard since he went into seclusion, although he disguises himself because Dorothy now has the Wicked Witch of the East's magic silver shoes, and he is afraid of her.  The Wizard sends Dorothy and her party to destroy the [[Wicked Witch of the West]] and in exchange promises to grant her request to be sent home. Surprisingly, Dorothy "destroys" the Witch by throwing a pail of water on her, causing her to melt. Defeated, the Wizard reveals to the group that he is in fact not a real wizard and has no magical powers, but he promises to grant Dorothy's wish and take her home himself in his balloon. He leaves the Scarecrow in his place to rule Oz.

Finally, it is discovered that the wizard had given the daughter of the last king of Oz, Princess Ozma, to the old witch [[Mombi]] to have her hidden away. Mombi had turned Ozma into a boy named Tip, whom she raised. When all of this is revealed Tip is turned back into Ozma and takes her rightful place as the benevolent ruler of all of Oz. Ozma successfully wards off several attempts by various armies to overthrow her. To prevent any upheaval of her rule over Oz, she outlaws the practice of all magic in Oz except by herself, the returned and reformed wizard, and by Glinda, and she has Glinda make all of Oz invisible to outsiders. Ozma remains the ruler of Oz for the entire series.

==Economy and politics==
Some political analysts have claimed that Oz is a thinly disguised [[Socialism|socialist]] [[utopia]], though some Baum scholars disagree.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eskimo.com/~tiktok/faq02.html#15 Frequently Asked Questions] ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz'' Website.&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates of this theory support it using this quotation from ''[[The Emerald City of Oz]]'':

:There were no poor people in the land of Oz, because there was no such thing as money, and all property of every sort belonged to the Ruler. Each person was given freely by his neighbors whatever he required for his use, which is as much as anyone may reasonably desire. Every one worked half the time and played half the time, and the people enjoyed the work as much as they did the play, because it is good to be occupied and to have something to do. There were no cruel overseers set to watch them, and no one to rebuke them or to find fault with them. So each one was proud to do all he could for his friends and neighbors, and was glad when they would accept the things he produced.

This is a revision of the original society: in the first two books, the people of Oz lived in a money-based economy.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;  For instance, the people of the Emerald City use "green pennies" as coinage.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;''The Annotated Wizard of Oz'', p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;  Money was not abolished in the course of the series, but excised from the conception of Oz.&lt;ref&gt;Riley, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, in ''[[The Magic of Oz]]'', a character from Oz gets into trouble when he goes to Ev because he was unaware of the concept of money.&lt;ref&gt;Riley, p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt; This decision to remove money from Oz may reflect Baum's own financial difficulties in the times when he was writing these books.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Since Oz is ruled by a [[monarch]], benevolent though she may be, Oz is closer in nature to an [[absolute monarchy]] than a communist or Marxist state.&lt;ref&gt;''The Annotated Wizard of Oz'', p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; When she was first introduced, Ozma was the monarch specifically of the Emerald City, but in the description of ''Ozma of Oz'', Oz is presented as a federal state, rather like the [[German Empire]], in monarchies rather than republics: having an [[emperor|overall ruler]] in Ozma, and individual kings and queens of smaller portions.&lt;ref&gt;Riley, pp. 139–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

The society grew steadily more utopian, in that its peace and prosperity were organized, but from the first book, it was a stupendously wealthy country, in contrast to Kansas's crop failures, droughts, and mortgages—just as it also is colorful to contrast with Kansas's gray.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Attebery, ''The Fantasy Tradition in American Literature'', Bloomington, IN, Indiana University Press, 1980; p. 85. {{ISBN|0-253-35665-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, despite the presence of the Emerald City, Oz is an agrarian country, similar to Kansas; the story has been interpreted as a [[populism|populist]] parable, and certainly contains many populist themes.&lt;ref&gt;Attebery, pp. 86–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Wonder City of Oz]]'', Princess Ozma (called "Queen Ozma" in this book) is seen running for election ("ozlection") to her office as ruler against [[List of Oz characters#Jenny Jump|Jenny Jump]], a half-fairy newcomer from [[New Jersey]]. However, this book was not written by Baum, but by John R. Neill, Baum's second successor. Further, the concept of the "ozlection" was not in Neill's manuscript for the book, but was added by an editor at Reilly and Lee, the publisher.

At times the rulers of Oz's territories have grander titles than would normally be customary, but this is done mostly for the satisfaction of the incumbents. The ruler of the Winkie Country is the Emperor, the Tin Woodman. The ruler of the [[Quadling Country]] is Glinda the Good. The Munchkin Country is ruled by a king, later identified as Cheeriobed, who is revealed to be married to the Good Witch of the North, who, a spell broken, abdicates leadership of the Gillikin Country to Joe King and Queen Hyacinth of Up Town.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Giant Horse of Oz]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Royal Flag of Oz is based on the map of the Land of Oz; the four colors represent the four countries, and the green star represents the Emerald City.

==Defense==
Oz is mostly a peaceful land and the idea of subversion is largely unknown to its people. Most military positions are only formal. This has caused many problems, such as in ''[[The Marvelous Land of Oz]]'' when the Emerald City (which was only guarded by an elderly doorman and one soldier who was the entire Army of Oz at the time) was easily conquered by the Army of Revolt led by [[Jinjur|General Jinjur]]. This army was in turn overwhelmed by another army of girls led by Glinda.

Security of Oz is mostly maintained by magic such as Glinda's spell making Oz completely invisible. Oz also has a natural barrier in the form of a desert that surrounds the land: anyone who touches the desert turns to sand. The [[Nome King]] has tried to conquer Oz on several occasions. A nominal army once existed, but it had an extremely large officers/privates ratio; other than its commander the Tin Woodman and one private, the portion of it seen in ''Ozma of Oz'' was composed entirely of cowardly officers. In the end of the book it was said that there are three privates all in all, and it is unknown how many—if any—officers were left at home during Ozma's travel to Ev. The private seen in the book, named [[Soldier with the Green Whiskers|Omby Amby]], is later promoted to Captain General.

In the book ''Emerald City of Oz'', there are 2 towns called Rigmarole Town and Flutterbudgets that are the defensive settlements of Oz.

In the movie ''[[Return to Oz]],'' the mechanical man [[Tik-Tok (Oz)|Tik-Tok]] is the entire Royal Army of Oz.

Attempts by outsiders to conquer the Land of Oz are frequent, particularly in the Oz books by Ruth Plumly Thompson. But these attempts are always successfully thwarted in the end, usually by Ozma or by forces sympathetic to her.

==Other media==

===The 1939 MGM film's Oz===

The Land of Oz as portrayed in the [[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|classic MGM musical movie of 1939]], is quite different from that portrayed in Baum's books. The most notable difference is that in the film the entire land of Oz appears to be dreamed up by [[Dorothy Gale]] (thus making it a [[dream world (plot device)|dream world]]), although, Dorothy earnestly corrects the adults at the end that she was indeed there, and an image of Dorothy's falling farmhouse returning to earth is presented. The apparent message is that one should appreciate one's home, no matter how dull it may look or uninteresting its surroundings may be, for having a home and a family is not something that should be taken for granted. This contrasts sharply with the books, in which Dorothy and her family are eventually invited to move to Oz due to a bank foreclosure on the farm, showing both that Oz is a real place, and that it is a utopia compared to the prairies of [[Kansas]].

There are many other small differences between the books and the movie. For example, when Dorothy arrives in [[Munchkin Country|Munchkinland]] the [[Munchkin]]s are seen wearing colorful costumes, but in the book Munchkins are said to only wear blue as blue is the official dominant color of the east. The first witch Dorothy meets in Oz in the book is the [[Good Witch of the North]], a minor character that only had one other appearance in Baum's books but is an important figure of Oz nonetheless. In the movie this character is conflated with that of [[Glinda the Good Witch|Glinda]], who is the Good Witch of the South and does not make an appearance until the very end of Baum's story. The character of Glinda in the books dresses in all white silk, as white is the traditional color for good witches, whereas in the film she is seen in pink.

It is also worthy of note that the Dorothy of the books is only a little girl who is no older than twelve-years-old. However, she is mature and very resourceful, only crying when faced with ultimate despair, whereas the older Dorothy of the movie (portrayed as a twelve-year-old by sixteen-year-old [[Judy Garland]]) spends several portions of the film crying and being told by others what to do, however her fear was overshadowed by the Cowardly Lion's. This is more consistent with Thompson's portrayal of Dorothy—Baum is known for his strong and independent female characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Brooke Allen| title=The Man Behind the Curtain| format= | work=New York Times| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B05E2DC1F3EF934A25752C1A9649C8B63 | accessdate = 2007-08-21 | date=2002-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Wicked Witch of the West]] also changes significantly between books and movie. In the books no mention is ever made of her skin color, whereas in the movie she is green without explanation, although the [[Winkie Country|Winkies]] she has enslaved and turned into soldiers are also green. In the book it is implied but not stated that she dresses in yellow, as yellow is the official dominant color of the [[Winkie Country]] where she rules, whereas in the movie she dresses entirely in black. In the book she is portrayed as having only one eye, which is so powerful it could see distant objects like a telescope, but in the movie she uses a crystal ball to watch Dorothy and her friends from afar. The 1939 MGM film makes the first reference to The Witches of the East and West being sisters, which was not the case in the book; none of the Witches in Baum's Oz are related.

The Wizard of Oz does not resort to anywhere near as much trickery in the movie as the book. In the book he entertains each member of Dorothy's party on a different day, and takes a different form for each; appearing as a giant green head, a beautiful fairy, a great beast, and a levitating ball of fire. In the movie he takes only one of these forms—that of the giant green head.

The nature of the [[Emerald City]] is changed in the film. In the book, the city is not actually all green, but everyone is forced to wear green tinted spectacles (ostensibly to protect their eyes from the glory and splendor of the luxurious city), thus making everything appear green. In the film, the city is actually all green. The architecture of the Emerald City in the movie uses a much more contemporary Art Deco style than Baum could have imagined. In the book, a giant green wall studded in glittering emeralds surrounds the entire city, whereas in the movie there is only a gate opening.

The movie replaces the charmed [[Silver Shoes|Silver Shoes with pointed toes]] of the book with [[Ruby Slippers|Ruby-Red Slippers]]. This was because full color motion pictures were still a relatively new technology in 1939, and MGM wanted to show off the visually dazzling process. Shiny red shoes were more impressive in a color motion picture compared to silver ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Eric P. Gjovaag| year=| title=Wizard of Oz – Frequently Asked Questions| format= | work= | url=http://www.eskimo.com/~tiktok/faq10.html#7 | accessdate = 2007-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the popularity of the movie, the green witch and the Ruby Slippers are more well known to the general public and pop culture than their book counterparts, and are even considered iconic.

===Gregory Maguire's revisionist Oz===
In his [[revisionism (fictional)|revisionist]] Oz novels ''[[Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West]]'', ''[[Son of a Witch]]'', ''[[A Lion Among Men]]'' and ''[[Out of Oz]]'', [[Gregory Maguire]] portrays a very different version of the Land of Oz. Maguire's Oz is not Baum's utopia, but a land troubled by political unrest and economic hardship. One political issue in Maguire's novels is the oppression of the Animals (Maguire distinguishes speaking Animals from non-speaking animals by the use of initial capital letters).  There are many religious traditions in Maguire's Oz, including Lurlinism (which regards the Fairy Lurline as Oz's creator), Unionism, which worships the Unnamed God, and the pleasure faiths which had swept Oz during the time that the witches were at Shiz. An example of the pleasure faiths were tic-toc (where creatures were enchanted to tell secrets or the future and run by clockwork), and sorcery.

Maguire's presentation of Oz's geography is also tinged with politics. A large political prison, Southstairs, exists in caverns below the Emerald City. Gillikin, home of Shiz University, has more industrial development than other parts of Oz. Munchkinland is Oz's breadbasket and at one point declares its independence from the rule of the Emerald City. Quadling Country is largely marshland, inhabited by the artistic and sexually free Quadlings. The Vinkus (Maguire's name for Winkie Country) is largely open grassland, populated by semi-nomadic tribes with brown skin.

The musical ''[[Wicked (musical)|Wicked]]'', based on Maguire's first Oz novel, portrays an Oz slightly closer to the version seen in Baum's novels and the 1939 [[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|film]]. The oppression of the Animals is still a theme, but the geographical and religious divisions portrayed in Maguire's novel are barely present.

In both the book and musical, several characters from the traditional Oz stories are present with different names. Glinda is originally called Galinda, but changes her name. The Wicked Witch of the West is called [[Elphaba]], the Wicked Witch of the East is called [[Nessarose]]. In the musical, but not in the book, [[Boq]] becomes the Tin Man, and [[Fiyero]] becomes the Scarecrow.

===Alexander Melentyevich Volkov's Magic Land===
[[Alexander Volkov (writer)|Alexander Melentyevich Volkov]] was a Russian author best known for his translation of ''The Wizard of Oz'' into Russian, and for writing his own original sequels, which were based only loosely on Baum's. Volkov's books have been translated into many other languages, and are better known than Baum's in some countries. The books, while still aimed at children, feature many mature political and ethical elements. They have been retranslated into English by Peter L. Blystone and partially by March Laumer, who used elements of them in his own books.

===March Laumer's Oz===
[[March Laumer]] was one of the first authors to continue the Oz series after the Famous Forty. His books were written with the permission of Contemporary Books, who owned [[Reilly &amp; Lee]], the original publisher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.starwarstimeline.net/Oz/DeadlyDesert.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629193621/http://www.starwarstimeline.net/Oz/DeadlyDesert.htm |archivedate=2007-06-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His canon includes everything he knew of that was set in the land of Oz, including Volkov's Russian Oz, the MGM movie, the Disney sequel, and many of Baum's own books that most fans do not consider canonical.

Laumer also made several controversial changes to Oz. He married off several of the major characters, often to unlikely prospects. For example, the intelligent and mature sorceress Glinda was married to Button Bright, who had been a small and dim-witted child throughout Baum's books. He also aged Dorothy to a teenager to make her a romantic prospect for several characters, made Ozma a [[lesbian]] based on her upbringing as a boy, and made the Shaggy Man an [[ephebophile]] based on his frequent travels with young girls.

Laumer's books do not portray one consistent version of Oz. Because most of his books were collaborations, he often included elements of other author's visions of Oz which may have been inconsistent with his own. For example, while he explicitly made Dorothy sixteen in ''A Fairy Queen in Oz'', he had her physically eight in ''Aunt Em and Uncle Henry in Oz''; and while he portrayed Volkov's Oz as a parallel universe in ''Farewell to Oz'' he also showed Volkov's characters living in Baum's Oz in many of his other books, such as ''Aunt Em and Uncle Henry in Oz''. Despite these discrepancies, many of his books are consistent with each other, and characters introduced in some often appear in others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://marchlaumer.4t.com/ March Laumer Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philip José Farmer's Oz===
[[Philip José Farmer]] portrays a very different Oz in his book ''[[A Barnstormer in Oz]]''. The premise is that nothing after the first book occurred—Dorothy never returned to Oz, and instead grew up, got married, and had a son. Her son, Hank Stover, is the main character, a [[World War I]] veteran flier and the titular barnstormer. While flying in his [[Curtiss JN-4]] [[biplane]] he enters a green haze and emerges in the civil war-stricken land of Oz.

Farmer portrays the land of Oz as a [[science fiction]] author, attempting to explain scientifically many of the "magical" elements of Baum's story.

===Robert A. Heinlein's Oz===
[[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s book, ''[[The Number of the Beast (novel)|The Number of the Beast]]'', passes through many famous fictional worlds including those of ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]''; ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'', specifically [[Lilliput and Blefuscu|Lilliput]]; [[E.E. "Doc" Smith]]'s [[Lensman]] universe; [[Asgard]], connected to Heinlein's own Future History universe by the Rainbow Bridge for one specific reason in one specific location; and [[Ringworld]]{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}; as well as some of Heinlein's own works, specifically those set in his Future History through which Lazarus Long moves; and of course the Land of Oz itself.

The Oz portrayed in the book is very close to Baum's Oz, although Heinlein does make an attempt to explain some things from the standpoint of a science fiction author. He explains that Oz is on a retrograde planet, where the direction of rotation relative to the poles is reversed, resulting in the sun seeming to rise in what would normally be the west.

Heinlein also explains that the population remains steady in Oz despite the lack of death because it is impossible for children to be born in Oz. When the population does increase through immigration, Glinda just extends the borders an inch or two in each direction, which makes more than enough space for all additional people.

===L. Sprague de Camp's Oz===
[[L. Sprague de Camp]], like Heinlein, brings his own characters to Oz in his book ''[[Sir Harold and the Gnome King]]'', part of the originally collaborative [[Harold Shea]] series. Unlike Heinlein, he does not attempt to explain Oz as science fiction, though he does deviate from the original corpus. He follows Thompson's Oz books, thus using her spelling of "Gnome" and her final fate of the character, but he postulates an incident that has removed the Ozites' immortality, with the result that both Ozma and Dorothy have aged and married by the time his story takes place.

===Tad Williams' Otherland Oz===
In the [[Otherland]] series, by [[Tad Williams]], a virtual reality version of Oz exists, wherein real-world antagonists play sadistic versions of the roles of the Tin Man, The Scarecrow, and the Cowardly Lion, in a twisted, martial, and post-apocalyptic version of Oz, populated both by characters from the novels, and a large quantity of male and female humans who go by the names "Henry" and "Em" respectively.  The humans, [[Computer animation|computer-generated]] characters based on the lost minds of children drawn into the Otherland program, look forward to a messianic prophecy foretelling the coming of "The Dorothy," where a child would be born among them.

===The Outer Zone (''Tin Man'')===
The 2007 [[Sci Fi Pictures original films|Sci Fi]] [[television miniseries]] ''[[Tin Man (TV miniseries)|Tin Man]]'' reinvents Oz as the Outer Zone (O.Z.), a parallel universe that was first visited by [[Dorothy Gale]] during the latter [[Victorian Era]] and is ruled over by her descendants.  It is implied, by reference to centuries having elapsed since Dorothy came to the O.Z., that time has progressed at different rates in the O.Z. and "the other side".  The re-imagined Oz is described as a place where "the paint has peeled, and what was once the goodness of Oz has become the horrible bleakness of the O.Z."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atomfilms.com/film/scifi_a_touch_more_evil.jsp "A Touch More Evil: Azkadellia's World", ''SciFi Pulse'' video (Atom Films mirror) – November 13, 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080607133505/http://www.atomfilms.com/film/scifi_a_touch_more_evil.jsp |date=June 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[scenic design]] of the O.Z. features elements of [[steampunk]], particularly the "1930's fascist realist" decor of the [[Azkadellia|evil sorceress's]] palace and the computer-generated Central City, analogue of the [[Emerald City]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ht1oQfEuHI "Brick by Brick: Bringing ''Tin Man'' to Life", ''SciFi Pulse'' video (YouTube mirror) – November 16, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emerald City Confidential===
The 2009 point-and-click adventure video game ''[[Emerald City Confidential]]'' reinvents Oz in a [[film noir]] style, with [[Dorothy Gale]] as a femme fatale, the Lion as a corrupt lawyer and some other changes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adventuregamers.com/article/id,980 "Review of ''Emerald City Confidential''", Adventure Gamers – February 23, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Once Upon a Time===
The Land of Oz appears in the TV series ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'' and is the focus of the episodes "[[It's Not Easy Being Green (Once Upon a Time)|It's Not Easy Being Green]]", "[[Kansas (Once Upon a Time)|Kansas]]", "[[Heart of Gold (Once Upon a Time)|Heart of Gold]]", "[[Our Decay]]", "[[Ruby Slippers (Once Upon a Time)|Ruby Slippers]]", and the most recent episode "[[Where Bluebirds Fly]]". It was also seen briefly in the episode "[[Sisters (Once Upon a Time)|Sisters]]".

==Magic of Oz==
Being a fantasy series Oz is rich in magic. In particular, there are many magic items which play an important role in the series.

===Silver Shoes/Ruby Slippers===
When Dorothy leaves Oz after having several adventures there and befriending many of Oz's natives, she is magically carried over the [[Deadly Desert]] by means of the charmed [[Silver Shoes]] she had been given shortly after her unexpected arrival when her farmhouse landed on and killed the previous pair's owner, the [[Wicked Witch of the East]]. After knocking her heels together three times and wishing to return home, Dorothy is lifted into the air and transported to Kansas. The shoes however, slip off of Dorothy's feet and are lost forever in the desert. Baum states the silver shoes are never recovered. In the 1939 film the shoes are changed to [[Ruby Slippers]]. When Dorothy clicks her heels together she closes her eyes and says: ''"There's no place like home''". She then wakes up in her bedroom in Kansas believing her experience in Oz to be an elaborate dream.

The silver shoes and ruby slippers are also used in several other versions including ''Wicked'' by [[Gregory Maguire]]. Here the shoes are constructed as a gift and have a chameleon effect. They are decorated with thousands of glittering glass beads that change colors according to the lighting. They can also appear to be several different colors all at once. The shoes are also lost when Dorothy is teleported back home just like in Baum's novel. The Broadway musical based on Maguire's book further shows that they were all silver, but were changed to ruby red by a spell put upon them by the Witch of the West [[Elphaba]], enabling her sister the Witch of the East [[Nessarose]], who prior had been confined to a wheelchair, to magically walk.

A little-known adaptation of the original story made for British television in the mid-90s starring [[Denise van Outen]] explained that they had belonged to a visitor from over the rainbow who came to Oz before Dorothy and they were obtained by the Witch when the visitor wished herself home and they fell off her feet on the return trip.

===Powder of Life===
The '''Powder of Life''' is a magic substance from the book series, which first appears in ''[[The Marvelous Land of Oz]]''.

It is a magical powder that brings inanimate objects to life. The [[Witchcraft|witch]] [[Mombi]] first obtained it from a "crooked magician." Later in the series, it is revealed that the substance is made by a [[Dr. Pipt (Oz)|Dr. Pipt]]. In order to make the substance, Dr. Pipt had to stir four large [[cauldron]]s for six years. Only a few grains of the powder could be made at a time. It is always described as being carried in a [[black pepper|pepper]] box.

In ''[[The Marvelous Land of Oz]]'', the Powder of Life was used to bring Jack Pumpkinhead, the Sawhorse, and [[The Gump (Oz)|the Gump]] to life. The first batch of the powder in Mombi's possession was activated by the following incantation and the action that had to be associated with:

* Raise the left hand, little finger pointing upward, and say: "Weaugh!"
* Raise the right hand, thumb pointing upward, and say: "Teaugh!"
* Raise both hands, with all the fingers and thumbs spread out, and say: "Peaugh!" 

In ''[[The Road to Oz]]'', the Dr. Pipt's sister Dyna activated the Powder of Life with a simple wish that brought the rug of her late blue bear pet to life.

In ''[[The Patchwork Girl of Oz]]'' it brings the title character to life, also the glass cat and a phonograph.

Mombi's shaker also contained three "wishing pills" fabricated by Dr. Nikidik.

The Powder has been used by Volkov in his series. There, it is produced from a certain plant of such viability that the smallest piece can grow into a plant within a day, on any surface except for solid metal. However, if it is sun-dried on such a surface, it turns into the Powder of Life. No incantation is required to make the powder work. The second book of the series is centered around a man who animates an army of wooden soldiers with the Powder and uses them for conquering the Magic Land.

In ''[[Return to Oz]]'', the magic words to bring the inanimate object to life were "WEAUGH, TEAUGH, PEAUGH".

===Magic Belt===
The '''Magic Belt''' is first introduced in ''[[Ozma of Oz]]''. Originally the belt belonged to the [[Nome King]], but [[Dorothy Gale]] stole it and defeated him. When she leaves Oz, she gives it to [[Princess Ozma|Ozma]] for safekeeping.

In most Oz books, the Magic Belt grants its wearer the ability to transform anyone into any form, and the ability to transport anyone anywhere, and also makes its wearer impervious to harm.  In some books, it also grants limited wishes.

In ''[[Ozma of Oz]]'', its power is limited: its magic cannot affect objects which are made of wood.

In non-canonical ''[[The Oz Kids]]'' animated series, the Magic Belt belonged to Dot.

===Magic Picture===
In Ozma's boudoir hangs a picture in a radium frame. This picture usually appears to be of a pleasant countryside, but when anyone wishes for the picture to show a particular person or place, the scene will display what is wished for. Sometimes the onlooker is able to hear sounds from the scene within the Magic Picture and sometimes an additional device is necessary to transmit sound.

A similar device is present in Volkov's series. There, it is given as a present to the Scarecrow by the [[Glinda the Good Witch|Good Witch of the South]]. It is a box of pink wood with a thick frosted glass screen. The device is password activated, and limited in range to the Magic Land (with the exception of deep caverns and certain types of magical interference). The box is shown to be virtually indestructible; it withstood repeated abuse from a villain attempting to use it.

===Great Book of Records===
{{Redirect-distinguish|Great Book of Records|Guinness World Records}}
Glinda's '''Great Book of Records''' is introduced in Chapter 29 of ''[[The Emerald City of Oz]]'': " 'It is a record of everything that happens,' replied the Sorceress. 'As soon as an event takes place, anywhere in the world, it is immediately found printed in my Magic Book. So when I read its pages I am well informed.' " The Book proves useful in ''[[The Scarecrow of Oz]]'' and ''[[Glinda of Oz]]''; and it recurs in many of the stories of Baum's successors and imitators. It is one of the prime magic devices of Oz; villains steal it when they can (as in ''[[The Lost Princess of Oz]]'' or in ''[[Handy Mandy in Oz]]''). Since it covers the planet and not merely Oz, the Book's entries are compressed and sometimes cryptic, and difficult to decipher (as in ''[[Paradox in Oz]]'' or ''[[Queen Ann in Oz]]'').

The book is also featured in the fantasy series ''Once Upon a Time''. Zelena reads the book ignoring Glinda's warning and turns green again because she felt betrayed as it was mentioned in the book that Dorothy would save Oz from a great evil (Zelena thought that evil was her but this was never revealed).

===The Love Magnet===
A rusty-looking horseshoe magnet which causes everyone to love its owner.  It is closely associated with the [[Shaggy Man]].  In ''[[The Road to Oz]]'', he finds that being loved by everyone can be inconvenient.  In ''[[Tik-Tok of Oz]]'' he reveals that Ozma has modified its powers so that it only works when it is displayed and affects only the feelings of those who see it.  It is an essential plot-element in ''[[The Shaggy Man of Oz]]''.  Ozma keeps it hanging over the gate into the Emerald City, so that all who enter will come with love, although this does not always seem to happen.

===Magic Fan===
The Magic Fan is brought to Oz by Dorothy in ''[[The Royal Book of Oz]]''.  Several subsequent books mention it.  It creates a powerful wind, capable of blowing away an invading army.

===Fountain of Oblivion===
A fountain in the Emerald City, anyone who drinks from it forgets everything he knows, including his own name.  It is used against the Nome King in ''[[The Emerald City of Oz]]'' and again in ''[[The Magic of Oz]]''.

===Magic Dinner Bell===
Created by the [[Jinnicky|Red Jinn]], it summons a slave named Ginger, who appears bearing a tray full of delicious food when the bell is rung.  Besides providing food, the bell also provides a means of escape from danger: anyone who holds onto the slave when he disappears after bringing the food is transported with him to the Red Jinn's castle.  There are actually two magic dinner bells, one in the Emerald City and another which the Red Jinn keeps for himself and uses while traveling.  The bell is first introduced in ''[[Jack Pumpkinhead of Oz]]'' and also appears in ''[[The Purple Prince of Oz]]'' and ''[[The Silver Princess in Oz]]''.

==Miscellaneous==
===Death in Oz===
In the later Oz books, no one can die. One of the books assures us that while you are in the Land of Oz, you cannot die. Unfortunately, this information comes ''after'' characters in the books have been chopped into pieces, beheaded, melted, and so forth and it is mentioned that you could be transformed into an inanimate object, turned into sand, and buried. Even so, you would still be alive and presumably conscious.

Baum puts it this way in the third chapter of ''[[The Emerald City of Oz]]'':

:"No disease of any sort was ever known among the Ozites, and so no one ever died unless he met with an accident that prevented him from living."

This passage has been translated by some fans to mean that one ceases to live if one's body is damaged to the extent that it cannot be repaired. However, in ''Tik-Tok of Oz'' Baum suggested that Oz people could go on living after being eaten and digested, and also that Nomes would continue to live after being cut into tiny pieces, which disproves the destruction theory.

Note also the spell which caused this also prevented aging, and took effect on everyone in Oz at the same time; this means that any babies in Oz are eternally babies, and that anyone who was at the moment of death is permanently caught there, and so on.

====Theories====
Death is treated inconsistently; in some books it is said that it is impossible to die, in others, people die. Problematically, the plot often depends on something either dying, or not being killable.

''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz'' shows an early example of the problem: although the Tin Woodman does not die when his limbs and head are severed, the two wicked witches are killed (the Wicked Witch of the East could be explained that she was simply crushed and not really dead, but could not do anything anyway, and in ''[[The Oz Odyssey]]'', the Wicked Witch of the West comes back to life). One theory brought forth as to why the Tin Woodman does not die is discussed in [[Edward Einhorn]]'s book ''[[Paradox in Oz]]'', where King Oz says that the Tin Woodman (then Nick Chopper) would have died were it not for his time magic. When the Tin Woodman rescues the Queen of the Field Mice by chopping off the head of a pursuing wildcat, it seems unlikely the cat's unjoined head and body continue to live independently of each other, although this goes unmentioned. Again, although the Tin Woodman survived losing all his body, prior to that, he had grown up and lost his parents in a manner inconsistent with later descriptions of Oz.&lt;ref&gt;''The Annotated Wizard of Oz'', pp. 138–9.&lt;/ref&gt;  Again, in ''[[Ozma of Oz]]'', Jack Pumpkinhead was described as "a little overripe", and in ''[[Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz]]'', he does not appear at all, although all the other characters do reappear; the implication is that he spoiled, as he feared from his creation.&lt;ref&gt;Riley, pp. 146–7.&lt;/ref&gt; It is unlikely, however, since, according to the [[The Road to Oz|previous book]], while a pumpkin which serves as Jack's head can spoil, it can be replaced, which was done several times without a problem.

Both ''Ozma of Oz'' and ''Tik-Tok of Oz'' describe trees with meat growing on them, so it is possible that no animal was killed for most of the meat eaten in Oz. However, in ''Tin Woodman of Oz'' a hungry Jaguar tries to eat a live monkey, suggesting that occasionally (among non-human animals, at least) animal flesh is preferred to that of plants.

===Talking animals===
In Oz, animals such as the Cowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger can talk, and all native animals appear to be capable of speech. ''[[Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West]]'' emphasized the difference between Animals and animals. Animals (capitalized) are sentient beings that can talk. Several theories exist as to how animals gained the gift of speech.

The treatment of non-native animals was inconsistent.  In the first book, the [[dog]] [[Toto (dog)|Toto]] never speaks, although brought to Oz; in ''The Patchwork Girl of Oz'', Dorothy specifies that he cannot speak because he is not a fairy dog. However, in ''Ozma of Oz'', the [[chicken]] [[Billina]] acquires speech merely by being swept to the lands near Oz, and in ''[[Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz]]'', the same is true of the kitten Eureka and the cab [[horse]] Jim when reaching the land of Mangaboos, a similarly magical land. In ''[[Tik-Tok of Oz]]'', Baum restored the [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]]: Toto can speak, and always could, but never bothered to, because it was unnecessary.

An additional inconsistency is introduced with ''Tik-Tok of Oz'': Hank the Mule cannot speak until reaching the Land of Oz, although he lands on the shore of Ev first, where Billina the chicken gained the ability to speak. This might be because ''Tik-Tok of Oz'' was originally a stageplay version of ''Ozma of Oz''; Dorothy was replaced by Betsy because he had sold the stage rights for Dorothy, and Billina was replaced by Hank because a mule could more convincingly be played by two people in a costume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | year=| title=Tik-Tok of Oz| format= | work= | url=http://www.pumperdink.org/BCF/Tik-TokOfOz.html#letter9 | accessdate = 2011-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hank probably could not talk because Baum already had two speaking comedy characters, the Shaggy Man and Tik-Tok. Thus Hank would fill a better niche as a visual comedy character, in the tradition of British pantomime. The part of Hank was also an analog to the part of Dorothy's cow Imogene, Toto's replacement on stage in the immensely successful 1903 Broadway version of ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1902 stage play)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', a success that Baum sought to duplicate for the rest of his life.

There is one small kingdom in Oz where animals are unable to talk: Corumbia.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Yellow Knight of Oz]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origin of the name Oz===
A legend of uncertain validity is that when relating bedtime stories (the earliest form of the Oz books) Baum was asked by his niece, Ramona Baxter Bowden, the name of the magical land. He glanced at a nearby filing cabinet, which had three drawers, labeled A–G, H–N, and O–Z. Thus he named the land Oz. This story was first told in 1903, but his wife always insisted that the part about the filing cabinet was not true.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8&gt;''The Annotated Wizard of Oz'', p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''[[Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz]]'', the name is translated as "great and good". It has also been speculated that Oz was named after the abbreviation for [[ounce]], in the theory that Oz is an allegory for the populist struggle against the illusion (the wizard) of the [[gold standard]].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Others have said that Oz stands for [[New York (state)|New York]]{{citation needed|date=July 2011}}, since the letters of the alphabet before O and Z are N and Y respectively. However, this works just as well with Oz standing for [[Pennsylvania]], because the letters following O and Z are P and A (starting again at the beginning of the alphabet).{{original research inline|date=July 2011}}

Several of Baum's fairy stories that take place in the United States were situated on the [[Ozark Plateau]], and the similarity of name may not be a coincidence.&lt;ref&gt;Riley, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Oz'' is a common vernacular contraction of ''[[Australia]]'' (Australia—Aussie—Aus—Oz). Australia is a large continent predominated by desert regions, with pockets of intense green tropical, sub-tropical and sub-alpine greenlands and rainforests. It is quite possible that Baum took the popular nickname of Australia as the national name for his fictional world. Also note that many fans place Oz in the South Pacific, see [[Land of Oz#Location|Location]] above. However, according to the [[Oxford English dictionary]], the first references to Australia by this name were made in 1902—after the first book had been published.  Nevertheless, spoken references would certainly have been in use before first appearing in print (as noted by Oxford), hence possibly before the writing of the book.

It is also possible that it is based on the "[[Óg]]" in [[Tír na nÓg]].  While no direct link between the mythology of Oz and the realm of Irish folklore has been conclusively proven, certain similarities, for instance [[Ogma]] and [[Princess Ozma]], are compelling.

'''Leadership for Learning''' ('''LfL''') is a framework and set of principles that arose from the ''Carpe Vitam'' project{{fact|date=August 2015}} in which practitioners and researchers worked together to develop the practice of [[leadership]] for [[learning]].  
Leadership for Learning: the Cambridge Network, based in the [[University of Cambridge Faculty of Education]], draws together practitioners, schools and organisations concerned with these ideas.  The LfL framework and principles have been used in a wide variety of contexts to frame discussions and to inform the evaluation of practice.

==History==
The Leadership for Learning Project (known as Carpe Vitam after its [[Sweden|Swedish]] commissioning body) was a research and development project focusing on the process by which schools made, and then grew, the connections between learning and leadership. It was funded for three years (2002–2005) by the [[Wallenberg Foundation]] in Sweden, with further financial support from participating countries. The project was directed from the [[University of Cambridge]] in collaboration with eight different groups of university researchers and their nominated schools in eight cities: [[Athens]], [[Brisbane]], [[Copenhagen]], [[Innsbruck]], [[London]], [[Oslo]], [[Seattle]], and [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]] ([[New Jersey]]).
Seven countries, eight higher education institutions and 24 schools participated in exploring the connections between leadership and learning through conferences, workshops, school visits and inter-country exchanges.

The researchers did not start from a blank slate or from a neutral stance but from a set of democratic values about leadership and learning. How those values could be translated into practical strategies at school and classroom level, however, was something they planned to discover through experimentation, reflection and collective debate over the life of the project.
Part way through that process they began to identify ‘principles for practice’ that would help to clarify and focus attention on the transformations in learning and leadership that were beginning to take place. These five principles were refined and developed throughout the project.

==Leadership for Learning principles for practice==
The most significant outcome of the project was a set of principles that could be used by researchers, by school leaders, by teachers and students to make the connections between leadership and learning through reflecting on, or researching, their own practice. Five statements came to represent these principles.

Leadership for Learning practice involves:
  
* Maintaining a focus on learning as an activity 
* Creating conditions favourable to learning as an activity
* Creating a dialogue about Leadership for Learning
* The sharing of leadership
* A shared sense of accountability

These five principles are dynamically interrelated, with dialogue forming the connections, a focus on learning and shared leadership mediated by conditions for learning, and all framed by the fifth principle of accountability. ‘A focus on learning’ is quite deliberately placed first because it can be considered as the prime principle, reflecting a commitment to making learning the number one priority – the core of Leadership for Learning. 
Each headline principle is elaborated through sub-principles that amplify and illustrate.

==The Cambridge Network==
LfL is under the leadership of Professor John MacBeath and is coordinated by a management team that includes David Frost, Sue Swaffield, John Bangs, Megan Crawford, Panayiotis Antoniou, Ruth Sapsed and Caroline Jestaz. It is part of the Leadership for Learning academic group.

The network exists to:
* Improve leadership practices for the benefit of all learners.
* Explore leadership for learning in educational contexts nationally and internationally.
* Support practitioners with advice based on research.
* Help young people to play an active role in improving learning at their school.
* Undertake and facilitate research on leadership for learning.
* Contribute to a leadership for learning knowledge base.
* Influence educational policy.

with the belief that:
* Learning and leadership are a shared, as much as an individual enterprise.
* Leadership should be 'distributed' and exercised at every level.
* Collaborative modes of working strengthen both teams and individuals.
* An independent, critical perspective, informed by research is vital.
* The status quo and received wisdom should be persistently questioned.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6137">In [[historical linguistics]], '''lexical diffusion''' is both a phenomenon and a theory.  The phenomenon is that by which a phoneme is modified in a subset of the lexicon, and spreads gradually to other lexical items.  For example, in [[English language|English]], {{IPA|/uː/}} has changed to {{IPA|/ʊ/}} in ''good'' and ''hood'' but not in ''food''; some dialects have it in ''hoof'' and/or ''roof'' but others do not; in ''flood'' and ''blood'' it happened early enough that the words were affected by the change of {{IPA|/ʊ/}} to {{IPA|/ʌ/}}, which is now no longer [[productivity (linguistics)|productive]].

The related theory, proposed by William Wang in 1969, is that all [[sound changes]] originate in a single word or a small group of words and then spread to other words with a similar phonological make-up, but may not spread to all words in which they potentially could apply.  The theory of lexical diffusion stands in contrast to the [[Neogrammarian hypothesis]] that a given sound change applies simultaneously to all words in which its context is found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Competing Changes as a Cause of Residue | given = William S-Y. | surname = Wang | journal = Language | volume = 45 | number = 1 | year = 1969 | pages = 9–25 | jstor = 411748 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mainstream historical linguists reject Wang's hypothesis, continuing to adhere to Neogrammarian exceptionlessness. For example, [[Edwin G. Pulleyblank|Pulleyblank]] regards the theoretical formulation of lexical diffusion as presented by Hsieh in Wang 1977 as "so manifestly at odds with any realistic picture of how dialects are inter-related and how innovations spread spatially through a language as to make them totally untenable" (1982: 408).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = ''The Lexicon in Phonological Change''. Monographs on Linguistic Analysis, no. 5 by William S-Y Wang
| given = Edwin G. | surname = Pulleyblank | journal = Journal of Chinese Linguistics | volume = 10 | issue = 2 | year = 1982 | pages = 392–416 | jstor = 23767018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Referring to one of Wang's touchstones of lexical diffusion, Egerod dismisses his theory as a sleight of hand:

&lt;blockquote&gt;there is no "massive split" involved, but an error of methodology in accounting for tones. Cháozhōu like other languages in China or outside of China has a complicated history with migration waves, loans and analogical formation. The conscientious historical linguist has to account for these before he resorts to a deus ex machina (1981: 173).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = How not to split tones—the Chaozhou case | given = Søren | surname = Egerod | journal = Fangyan | volume = 3 | year = 1982 | pages = 169–173 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Mazaudon &amp; Lowe conclude a robust critique of lexical diffusion in a similar vein, remarking that "a detailed study of the history of the language can disentangle the reflexes from different sources, and it is not necessary to renounce the principle of regular change for the sake of such cases" (1993: 11).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |surname1=Mazaudon |given1=Martine |given2=John B. |surname2=Lowe |chapter=Regularity and Exceptions in Sound Change |pages=1–25 |chapter-url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01363794 |editor1-given=Marc |editor1-surname=Domenici |editor2-given=Didier |editor2-surname=Demolin |title=Annual Conference of the Linguistic Society of Belgium |location=Brussels |year=1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Labov]], in ''Principles of Linguistic Change'', takes the position that there are two types of sound changes: regular sound change (respecting the Neogrammarian hypothesis) and lexical diffusion.  Labov lists a typology, according to which certain phenomena are typically or exclusively regular (example, vowel quality changes), while others (example, metathesis, or vowel shortening) tend to follow a lexical diffusion pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Labov| first=William| year=1994| authorlink=William Labov| title=Principles of Linguistic Change, Volume 1: Internal Factors| location=Cambridge, Massachusetts| publisher=Blackwell| isbn=978-0-631-17913-9 |pages=421–543}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Kiparsky]], in the Handbook of Phonology (Goldsmith editor), argues that under a proper definition of [[analogy#Linguistics|analogy]] as optimization, lexical diffusion is not a type of sound change.  Instead, Kiparsky claims it is similar to [[Morphological leveling|leveling]], in that it is a non-proportional type of analogy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Kiparsky| first=Paul| year=1995| authorlink=Paul Kiparsky| chapter=The phonological basis of sound change| pages=640–670| title=The Handbook of Phonological Theory| editor=John A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15327">'''Local history''' is the study of [[history]] in a geographically local context and it often concentrates on the [[local community]]. It incorporates [[cultural history|cultural]] and [[social history|social]] aspects of history. Local history is not merely national history writ small but a study of past events in a given geographical but one that is based on a wide variety of [[documentary evidence]] and placed in a [[Comparative contextual analysis|comparative context]] that is both regional and national.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Local History, 2nd ed.|last=Kammen|first=Carol|last2=Wilson|first2=Amy|publisher=AltaMira Press|year=2012|isbn=9780759120488|location=Lanham, MD|pages=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historic plaques are one form of documentation of significant occurrences in the past and [[Oral history|oral histories]] are another. 

Local history is often documented by local historical societies or groups that form to preserve a local historic building or other historic site. Many works of local history are compiled by amateur historians working independently or archivists employed by various organizations. An important aspect of local history is the publication and cataloguing of documents preserved in local or national records which relate to particular areas.

In a number of countries a broader concept of '''local lore''' is known, which is a comprehensive study of everything pertaining to a certain locality: history, ethnography, geography, natural history, etc. 

==Local contexts==
[[File:WLM Toscana 2018 7.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Examples of local history books about people and monuments in the [[province of Pistoia]], published with the financial support of local [[local government |muncipalities]] and banks]]
Local history tends to be less documented than other types, with fewer books and artifacts than that of a country or continent. Many local histories are recorded as oral tales or stories and so are more vulnerable than more well known issues. Artifacts of local history are often collected in local history museums, which may be housed in a historic house or other building. Individual historic sites are inherently local, although they may have national or world history importance as well. Many however have little overall historical impact but add depth to the local area.

===Australia===

In Australia, local history is focussed on specific cities and suburbs or country towns and regions. In cities, local history might concentrate on a [[Central business district|CBD]] and its bordering suburbs, on a specific suburb or [[Local government in Australia|municipality]], or on an agglomeration of suburbs and municipalities (because local government boundaries have changed over time). Outside the larger cities, local history often examines regional towns and surrounding areas.

Records are typically stored at state libraries, municipal libraries, historical societies and public record offices. For example, the [[State Library of Victoria]] holds extensive local history records for [[Melbourne]] and other places in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. Many other [[List of libraries in Melbourne|Melbourne libraries]] have local history collections, along with the [[Public Record Office Victoria]] and the [[Royal Historical Society of Victoria]]. In [[New South Wales]], the [[Royal Australian Historical Society]] has studied local history as part of its remit since its founding in 1901. It holds local history records along with the [[State Library of NSW]] and other state and local libraries and archives.

Historians have examined the ways local history has been written in Australia since the nineteenth century. Early on, the emphasis was on pioneer and settler history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hirst |first=John |date=1978 |title=The pioneer legend |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10314617808595595 |journal=Historical Studies |volume=18 |issue=71 |pages=316–337 |doi=10.1080/10314617808595595 |access-date=2017-03-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The creative ways that local history contributed to making community has also been argued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Griffiths |first=Tom |date=1996 |title=Hunters and Collectors: The Antiquarian Imagination in Australia |location=Cambridge, England |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0521483492}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, local history, [[urban history]], [[public history]] and [[Cultural heritage|heritage]] were closely connected in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Davison |first=Graeme |date=2000 |title=The use and abuse of Australian history |location=St. Leonards, N.S.W |publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin |isbn=1864487208 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
{{see also|English local history|British Association for Local History}}
The [[British Association for Local History]] in the United Kingdom encourages and assists in the study of local history as an academic discipline and as a leisure activity by both individuals and groups. Most historic counties in England have record societies and archaeological and historical societies which coordinate the work of historians and other researchers concerned with that area.

Local history in the UK took a long time to be accepted as an academic discipline. In the 18th and 19th centuries, it was widely regarded as an [[antiquarian]] pursuit, suitable for country parsons. The [[Victoria County History|Victoria History of the Counties of England]] project begun in 1899 in honour of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] with the aim of creating an encyclopaedic history of each of the [[historic counties of England]]. The project is coordinated by the [[Institute of Historical Research]] at the [[University of London]]. The first academic post related to local history was at [[Reading University]] which appointed a research fellow in local history in 1908. There was a department of local history (but without a professor) at [[Leicester University]] from 1947. [[H. P. R. Finberg]] was the first Professor of English Local History. He was appointed by Leicester in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Local History: Objective and Pursuit|first=HPR|last=Finberg|first2=VHT|last2=Skipp|publisher=David &amp; Charles|year=1967|pages=46–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local history continues to be neglected as an academic subject within universities. Academic local historians are often found within a more general department of history or in continuing education.

Local history is rarely taught as a separate subject in British schools. In 1908, a Board of Education circular had urged that schools should pay attention "to the history of the town and district" in which they were situated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Local History: Objective and Pursuit|first=HPR|last=Finberg|first2=VHT|last2=Skipp|publisher=David &amp; Charles|year=1967|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952, the Ministry of Education suggested schools should use local material to illustrate national themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Local History: Objective and Pursuit|first=HPR|last=Finberg|first2=VHT|last2=Skipp|publisher=David &amp; Charles|year=1967|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the current [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum]], pupils at level 4 are expected to "show their knowledge and understanding of local, national and international history".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100418051729/http://curriculum.qcda.gov.uk/key-stages-3-and-4/subjects/key-stage-3/history/Level-descriptions/index.aspx National Curriculum - level descriptions]&lt;/ref&gt;'''

The [[Alan Ball Local History Awards]] were established in the 1980s to recognize outstanding contributions in local history publishing in the UK (both in print and in [[new media]]), and to encourage the publishing of such works by [[public library|public libraries]] and [[local authority#United Kingdom|local authorities]].&lt;ref name=clip2010&gt;[http://www.cilip.org.uk/get-involved/special-interest-groups/local-studies/activities/pages/alanball.aspx Local Studies Alan Ball Local History Awards] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110506050104/http://www.cilip.org.uk/get-involved/special-interest-groups/local-studies/activities/pages/alanball.aspx |date=2011-05-06 }} [[Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals]], published 2011-11-02, accessed 2012-05-06&lt;/ref&gt;

Local history can become a crucial component to policy-making and serve as a marketable resource and this is demonstrated in the case of [[Northern Ireland]]. Aside from its contribution to local development, local history is being used as a non-contentious meeting ground in addressing conflicting traditions by reinforcing shared past rather than adversarial political history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Oxford Companion to Family and Local History|last=Hey|first=David|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=9780191044939|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{see also|American urban history}}
In the United States, local history is usually concentrated on any history of the place and people from a particular [[village]] or [[township]]. Several villages and townships would comprise one county or county history. Library records are often divided by State, then county, then township/local history. The American Local History Network (ALHN) in the United States provides a focus for accessing independent genealogical and historical resources.

In the United States, 79,000 historic sites are identified as listings on its [[National Register of Historic Places]]. State and local municipalities often have additional landmark designations to cover sites of more purely local interest.

In addition, many regional and state [[historical societies]] maintain regional history and actively seek out missing historical collections.

A new form of local history is the movement of "[[If This House Could Talk]]" projects in various urban neighborhoods in the United States. These small scale locally generated history events encourage an interest in history and provide for open ended participation by the general public. However, there is often no vetting or third party review of the factual evidence that is presented, and therefore such presentations may require oversight by professional third party history organizations if they are to be transcribed into ongoing collections of local history.

=== Slavic countries ===

In several Slavic countries there is a related study which may be translated from the local languages as "country lore" or "local lore". In addition to history, it also incorporates other local studies, such as local geography, nature, and ethnography.

In the USSR, Russia and Russian-speaking post-Soviet states local lore is known as ''krayevedenie'' ([[:ru:Краеведение|Краеведение]]). It is taught in primary schools. There are also local lore museums known as ''krayevedcheskie muzei''. In modern Russia the concept of "regional studies" ( Регионоведение) is also considered.&lt;ref&gt;Ю. Н. Гладкий, А. И. Чистобаев. ''Регионоведение. Учебник для студентов высших учебных заведений'' (''Regional Studies. A Texbook for Higher Education Students'') Moscow, Гардарики, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ukraine]], the study of local history and regional ethnography is known as ''krayeznavstvo'' ({{lang-uk|[[:uk:краєзнавство|краєзнавство]]}}. The National Union of Local Lore Researchers of Ukraine is a professional society for researchers of ethnology and local studies in Ukraine. It was founded in 1925 and has 3,000 members in 17 chapters.&lt;ref name="nsku"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nsku.org.ua/?page_id=5606 | title=Історія Національної спілки краєзнавців України | publisher=National Union of Local Lore Researchers of Ukraine | accessdate=20 January 2015 | language=Ukrainian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The society has published its journal ''Краєзнавство'' since 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=''Краєзнавство'' | url=http://nsku.org.ua/?page_id=5603 | accessdate=20 January 2015 | language=Ukrainian }} Individual issues of the journal are available from [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Krajeznavstvo Wikimedia Commons]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Poland]], the corresponding concept is called ''[[:pl:Krajoznawstwo|krajoznawstwo]]'', the term known since 1902. In modern Poland various organized ''krajoznawstwo'' activities are carried out by [[PTTK|Polskie Towarzystwo Turystyczno-Krajoznawcze]], ineptly translated as "Polish Tourist and Sightseeing Society".

'''Paul-Michel Foucault''' ({{IPAc-en|f|uː|ˈ|k|oʊ}}; 15 October 1926 – 25 June 1984), generally known as '''Michel Foucault''' ({{IPA-fr|miʃɛl fuko|lang}}), was a [[French philosophy|French philosopher]], [[History of ideas|historian of ideas]], [[social theorist]], and [[Literary criticism|literary critic]].

Foucault's theories primarily address the relationship between [[Power (philosophy)|power]] and [[knowledge]] , and how they are used as a form of [[social control]] through societal institutions. Though often cited as a [[post-structuralist]] and [[postmodernist]], Foucault rejected these labels, preferring to present his thought as a critical history of [[modernity]]. His thought has influenced academics, especially those working in [[communication studies]], [[sociology]], [[cultural studies]], [[literary theory]], [[feminism]], and [[critical theory]]. Activist groups have also found his theories compelling.

Born in [[Poitiers]], France, into an [[upper-middle-class]] family, Foucault was educated at the [[Lycée Henri-IV]], at the [[École Normale Supérieure]], where he developed an interest in philosophy and came under the influence of his tutors [[Jean Hyppolite]] and [[Louis Althusser]], and at the [[University of Paris]] ([[Sorbonne]]), where he earned degrees in philosophy and psychology. After several years as a cultural diplomat abroad, he returned to France and published his first major book, ''[[Madness and Civilization|The History of Madness]]'' (1961). After obtaining work between 1960 and 1966 at the [[Blaise Pascal University|University of Clermont-Ferrand]], he produced ''[[The Birth of the Clinic]]'' (1963) and ''[[The Order of Things]]'' (1966), publications which displayed his increasing involvement with [[structuralism]], from which he later distanced himself. These first three histories exemplified a [[historiography|historiographical]] technique Foucault was developing called "archaeology".

From 1966 to 1968, Foucault lectured at the [[University of Tunis]] before returning to France, where he became head of the philosophy department at the new experimental university of [[Paris VIII]]. Foucault subsequently published ''[[The Archaeology of Knowledge]]'' (1969). In 1970, Foucault was admitted to the [[Collège de France]], a membership he retained until his death. He also became active in a number of [[left-wing]] groups involved in campaigns against racism and human rights abuses and for penal reform. Foucault later published ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'' (1975) and ''[[The History of Sexuality]]'' (1976), in which he developed archaeological and genealogical methods which emphasized the role that power plays in society.

Foucault died in Paris of neurological problems compounded by [[HIV/AIDS]]; he became the first public figure in France to die from the disease. His partner [[Daniel Defert]] founded the [[AIDES]] charity in his memory.

==Early life==

===Youth: 1926–46===
Paul-Michel Foucault was born on 15 October 1926 in the city of [[Poitiers]], west-central France, as the second of three children in a prosperous and [[social conservatism|socially conservative]] [[Upper middle class|upper-middle-class]] family.{{sfnm|1a1=Macey|1y=1993|1p=3|2a1=Miller|2y=1993|2p=39}}
Family tradition prescribed naming him after his father, Dr. Paul Foucault, but his mother insisted on the addition of "Michel"; referred to as "Paul" at school, he expressed a preference for "Michel" throughout his life.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=4–5|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=3|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3p=39}}

His father (1893–1959), a successful local surgeon born in [[Fontainebleau]], moved to Poitiers, where he set up his own practice and married local woman Anne Malapert.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=5|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=1–2}} She was the daughter of prosperous surgeon Dr. Prosper Malapert, who owned a private practice and taught anatomy at the [[University of Poitiers]]' School of Medicine.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=5|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=1}} Paul Foucault eventually took over his father-in-law's medical practice, while his wife took charge of their large mid-19th-century house, Le Piroir, in the village of [[Vendeuvre-du-Poitou]].{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=5|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=2}} Together the couple had three children – a girl named Francine and two boys, Paul-Michel and Denys – who all shared the same fair hair and bright blue eyes.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=5|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=3}} The children were raised to be nominal [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]], attending mass at the Church of Saint-Porchair, and while Michel briefly became an [[altar boy]], none of the family were devout.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=5|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=4}}

{{rquote|right|''I wasn't always smart, I was actually very stupid in school ... [T]here was a boy who was very attractive who was even stupider than I was. And in order to ingratiate myself with this boy who was very beautiful, I began to do his homework for him—and that's how I became smart, I had to do all this work to just keep ahead of him a little bit, in order to help him. In a sense, all the rest of my life I've been trying to do intellectual things that would attract beautiful boys.''|Michel Foucault, 1983{{sfn|Miller|1993|p=56}}}}

In later life, Foucault would reveal very little about his childhood.{{sfnm|1a1=Macey|1y=1993|1p=4|2a1=Miller|2y=1993|2p=39}} Describing himself as a "juvenile delinquent", he claimed his father was a "bully" who would sternly punish him.{{sfn|Miller|1993|p=39}} In 1930 Foucault began his schooling, two years early, at the local Lycée Henry-IV. Here he undertook two years of elementary education before entering the main ''lycée'', where he stayed until 1936. He then undertook his first four years of secondary education at the same establishment, excelling in French, Greek, Latin and history but doing poorly at arithmetic and mathematics.{{sfn|Macey|1993|pp=8–9}} In 1939 the [[Second World War]] broke out and in 1940 [[Nazi Germany]] occupied France; Foucault's parents opposed the occupation and the [[Vichy France|Vichy regime]], but did not join the [[French Resistance|Resistance]].{{sfn|Macey|1993|p=7}} In 1940 Foucault's mother enrolled him in the Collège Saint-Stanislas, a strict Roman Catholic institution run by the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]]. Lonely, he described his years there as an "ordeal", but he excelled academically, particularly in philosophy, history and literature.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=6–7|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=10|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3pp=39–40|4a1=Smart|4y=2002|4p=19}} In 1942 he entered his final year, the ''terminale'', where he focused on the study of philosophy, earning his ''[[baccalauréat]]'' in 1943.{{sfn|Macey|1993|p=10}}

Returning to the local Lycée Henry-IV, he studied history and philosophy for a year,{{sfn|Macey|1993|p=13}} aided by a personal tutor, the philosopher [[Louis Girard (philosopher)|Louis Girard]].{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=9|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=11}} Rejecting his father's wishes that he become a surgeon, in 1945 Foucault went to [[Paris]], where he enrolled in one of the country's most prestigious secondary schools, which was also known as the [[Lycée Henri-IV]]. Here he studied under the philosopher [[Jean Hyppolite]], an [[existentialism|existentialist]] and expert on the work of 19th-century German philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]. Hyppolite had devoted himself to uniting existentialist theories with the [[dialectics|dialectical theories]] of Hegel and [[Karl Marx]]. These ideas influenced Foucault, who adopted Hyppolite's conviction that philosophy must develop through a study of history.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=11, 14–21|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=15–17|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3pp=40–41}}

===École Normale Supérieure and University of Paris: 1946–51===
Attaining excellent results, in autumn 1946 Foucault was admitted to the elite [[École Normale Supérieure]] (ENS); to gain entry, he undertook exams and an oral interrogation by [[Georges Canguilhem]] and Pierre-Maxime Schuhl. Of the hundred students entering the ENS, Foucault was ranked fourth based on his entry results, and encountered the highly competitive nature of the institution. Like most of his classmates, he was housed in the school's communal dormitories on the Parisian Rue d'Ulm.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=24–25|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=17–22|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3p=45}}
He remained largely unpopular, spending much time alone, reading voraciously.  His fellow students noted his love of violence and the macabre; he decorated his bedroom with images of torture and war drawn during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] by Spanish artist [[Francisco Goya]], and on one occasion chased a classmate with a dagger.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=26|2a1=Miller|2y=1993|2p=45}} Prone to [[self-harm]], in 1948 Foucault allegedly undertook a [[suicide attempt]], for which his father sent him to see the psychiatrist [[Jean Delay]] at the [[Sainte-Anne Hospital Center]].  Obsessed with the idea of self-mutilation and suicide, Foucault attempted the latter several times in ensuing years, praising suicide in later writings.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=26|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=27–28|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3pp=54–55}} The ENS's doctor examined Foucault's state of mind, suggesting that his suicidal tendencies emerged from the distress surrounding his homosexuality, because same-sex sexual activity was socially taboo in France.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=26|2a1=Miller|2y=1993|3p=55}} At the time, Foucault engaged in homosexual activity with men whom he encountered in the underground Parisian gay scene, also indulging in drug use; according to biographer [[James Miller (academic)|James Miller]], he enjoyed the thrill and sense of danger that these activities offered him.{{sfnm|1a1=Macey|1y=1993|1p=30|2a1=Miller|2y=1993|2pp=55–56}}

Although studying various subjects, Foucault's particular interest was soon drawn to philosophy, reading not only Hegel and Marx but also [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Edmund Husserl]] and most significantly, [[Martin Heidegger]].{{sfnm|1a1=Macey|1y=1993|1p=34|2a1=Miller|2y=1993|2p=46}} He began reading the publications of philosopher [[Gaston Bachelard]], taking a particular interest in his work exploring the [[history of science]].{{sfnm|1a1=Macey|1y=1993|1p=35|2a1=Miller|2y=1993|2pp=60–61}} He graduated from the ENS with a DES (''{{Interlanguage link multi|diplôme d'études supérieures|fr}}'', roughly equivalent to an [[Master of Arts|MA]]) in Philosophy in 1949.&lt;ref name="Schrift p. 126"/&gt; His DES thesis under the direction of Hyppolite was titled ''La Constitution d'un transcendental dans La Phénoménologie de l'esprit de Hegel'' (''The Constitution of a Historical Transcendental in Hegel's [[Phenomenology of Spirit]]'').&lt;ref name="Schrift p. 126"/&gt;

In 1948, the philosopher [[Louis Althusser]] became a tutor at the ENS. A [[Marxism|Marxist]], he proved to be an influence both on Foucault and a number of other students, encouraging them to join the [[French Communist Party]] (''Parti communiste français'', PCF). Foucault did so in 1950, but never became particularly active in its activities, and never adopted an orthodox Marxist viewpoint, refuting core Marxist tenets such as [[class struggle]].{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=32–36, 51–55|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=23–26, 37–40|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3p=57}} He soon became dissatisfied with the bigotry that he experienced within the party's ranks; he personally faced [[homophobia]] and was appalled by the [[anti-semitism]] exhibited during the [[Doctors' plot]] in the [[Soviet Union]]. He left the Communist Party in 1953, but remained Althusser's friend and defender for the rest of his life.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=56–57|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=39–40|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3pp=57–58}} Although failing at the first attempt in 1950, he passed his ''[[agrégation]]'' in philosophy on the second try, in 1951.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=36–38|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=43–45|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3p=61}} Excused from [[national service]] on medical grounds, he decided to start a doctorate at the [[Fondation Dosne-Thiers|Fondation Thiers]] in 1951, focusing on the philosophy of psychology,{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=39–40|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=45–46, 49}} but he relinquished it after only one year in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;Derek Robbins, ''French Post-War Social Theory: International Knowledge Transfer'', SAGE, 2012, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

Foucault was also interested in psychology and he attended [[Daniel Lagache]]'s lectures at the University of Paris, where he obtained a [[Licence (France)|BA (licence)]] in Psychology in 1949 and a [[Specialist diploma|Diploma]] in [[Psychopathology]] (''Diplôme de psychopathologie'') from the University's Institute of Psychology (now {{Interlanguage link multi|Institut de psychologie de l'université Paris Descartes|fr}}) in June 1952.&lt;ref name="Schrift p. 126"/&gt;

===Early career: 1951–1955===
[[File:Nietzsche187a.jpg|thumb|right|175px|In the early 1950s, Foucault came under the influence of German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, who remained a core influence on his work throughout his life.]]
Over the following few years, Foucault embarked on a variety of research and teaching jobs.{{Sfn|Miller|1993|p=61}} From 1951 to 1955, he worked as a psychology instructor at the ENS at Althusser's invitation.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=50|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=49|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3p=62}} In Paris, he shared a flat with his brother, who was training to become a surgeon, but for three days in the week commuted to the northern town of [[Lille]], teaching psychology at the [[Université Lille Nord de France|Université de Lille]] from 1953 to 1954.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=61–62|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=47}} Many of his students liked his lecturing style.{{Sfn|Macey|1993|p=56}} Meanwhile, he continued working on his thesis, visiting the [[Bibliothèque Nationale]] every day to read the work of psychologists like [[Ivan Pavlov]], [[Jean Piaget]] and [[Karl Jaspers]].{{sfnm|1a1=Macey|1y=1993|1p=49|2a1=Miller|2y=1993|2pp=61–62}} Undertaking research at the psychiatric institute of the Sainte-Anne Hospital, he became an unofficial intern, studying the relationship between doctor and patient and aiding experiments in the [[Electroencephalography|electroencephalographic]] laboratory.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=41–49|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=56–58|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3p=62}} Foucault adopted many of the theories of the psychoanalyst [[Sigmund Freud]], undertaking psychoanalytical interpretation of his dreams and making friends undergo [[Rorschach test]]s.{{Sfnm|Eribon|1991|1pp=30, 43|Miller|1993|2pp=62–63}}

Embracing the Parisian ''avant-garde'', Foucault entered into a romantic relationship with the [[serialism|serialist]] composer [[Jean Barraqué]]. Together, they tried to produce their greatest work, heavily used recreational drugs and engaged in [[sado-masochism|sado-masochistic]] sexual activity.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=65–68|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=50–53|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3pp=66, 79–82, 89–91}} In August 1953, Foucault and Barraqué holidayed in Italy, where the philosopher immersed himself in ''[[Untimely Meditations]]'' (1873–76), a set of four essays by the philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. Later describing Nietzsche's work as "a revelation", he felt that reading the book deeply affected him, being a watershed moment in his life.{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=52|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=50|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3pp=64–67}} Foucault subsequently experienced another groundbreaking self-revelation when watching a Parisian performance of [[Samuel Beckett]]'s new play, ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'', in 1953.{{sfnm|1a1=Macey|1y=1993|1p=41|2a1=Miller|2y=1993|2pp=64–65}}

Interested in literature, Foucault was an avid reader of the philosopher [[Maurice Blanchot]]'s book reviews published in ''[[Nouvelle Revue Française]]''. Enamoured of Blanchot's literary style and critical theories, in later works he adopted Blanchot's technique of "interviewing" himself.{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=58|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=55|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3pp=82–84}} Foucault also came across [[Hermann Broch]]'s 1945 novel ''[[The Death of Virgil]]'', a work that obsessed both him and Barraqué. While the latter attempted to convert the work into an [[epic opera]], Foucault admired Broch's text for its portrayal of death as an affirmation of life.{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=66|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=53|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3pp=84–85}} The couple took a mutual interest in the work of such authors as the [[Marquis de Sade]], [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], [[Franz Kafka]] and [[Jean Genet]], all of whose works explored the themes of sex and violence.{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=31|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=51–52}}

{{rquote|right|''I belong to that generation who, as students, had before their eyes, and were limited by, a horizon consisting of Marxism, phenomenology and existentialism. For me the break was first Beckett's ''Waiting for Godot'', a breathtaking performance.''|Michel Foucault, 1983{{sfn|Miller|1993|p=65}}}}

Interested in the work of Swiss psychologist [[Ludwig Binswanger]], Foucault aided family friend Jacqueline Verdeaux in translating his works into French. Foucault was particularly interested in Binswanger's studies of [[Ellen West]] who, like himself, had a deep obsession with suicide, eventually killing herself.{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=44–45|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=59–61|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3pp=73–75}} In 1954, Foucault authored an introduction to Binswanger's paper "Dream and Existence", in which he argued that dreams constituted "the birth of the world" or "the heart laid bare", expressing the mind's deepest desires.{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=45–46|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=67–69|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3pp=76–77}} That same year, Foucault published his first book, ''Mental Illness and Personality'' (''Maladie mentale et personalité''), in which he exhibited his influence from both Marxist and Heideggerian thought, covering a wide range of subject matter from the reflex psychology of Pavlov to the classic psychoanalysis of Freud. Referencing the work of [[Sociology|sociologists]] and anthropologists such as [[Émile Durkheim]] and [[Margaret Mead]], he presented his theory that illness was culturally relative.{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=68–70|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=63–66|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3p=63}} Biographer [[James Miller (academic)|James Miller]] noted that while the book exhibited "erudition and evident intelligence", it lacked the "kind of fire and flair" which Foucault exhibited in subsequent works.{{Sfn|Miller|1993|pp=63}} It was largely critically ignored, receiving only one review at the time.{{Sfn|Macey|1993|p=67}} Foucault grew to despise it, unsuccessfully attempting to prevent its republication and translation into English.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|p=70}}

===Sweden, Poland, and West Germany: 1955–60===
Foucault spent the next five years abroad, first in [[Sweden]], working as cultural diplomat at the [[University of Uppsala]], a job obtained through his acquaintance with historian of religion [[Georges Dumézil]].{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=73–74|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=70–71}} At [[Uppsala]] he was appointed a Reader in French language and literature, while simultaneously working as director of the Maison de France, thus opening the possibility of a cultural-diplomatic career.{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=76–78|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=73, 76}} Although finding it difficult to adjust to the "Nordic gloom" and long winters, he developed close friendships with two Frenchmen, biochemist Jean-François Miquel and physicist Jacques Papet-Lépine, and entered into romantic and sexual relationships with various men. In Uppsala, he became known for his heavy alcohol consumption and reckless driving in his new [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar car]].{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=74–77|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=74–75}} In spring 1956, Barraqué broke from his relationship with Foucault, announcing that he wanted to leave the "vertigo of madness".{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=68|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=81|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3p=91}} In Uppsala, Foucault spent much of his spare time in the university's ''[[Carolina Rediviva]]'' library, making use of their Bibliotheca Walleriana collection of texts on the history of medicine for his ongoing research.{{sfn|Macey|1993|p=78}} Finishing his doctoral thesis, Foucault hoped it would be accepted by Uppsala University, but [[Sten Lindroth]], a [[positivism|positivistic]] historian of science there, was unimpressed, asserting that it was full of speculative generalisations and was a poor work of history; he refused to allow Foucault to be awarded a doctorate at Uppsala. In part because of this rejection, Foucault left Sweden.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=83–86|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=79–80}} Later, Foucault admitted that the work was a first draft with certain lack of quality.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=190}}

Again at Dumézil's recognition, in October 1958 Foucault arrived in the [[Poland|Polish]] capital - [[Warsaw]], placed in charge of the [[University of Warsaw]]'s Centre Français.{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=87|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=84|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3p=91}} Foucault found life in Poland difficult due to the lack of material goods and services following the destruction of the Second World War. Witnessing the aftermath of the [[Polish October]] in which students had protested against the governing communist [[Polish United Workers' Party]], he felt that most Poles despised their government as a [[puppet regime]] of the [[Soviet Union]], and thought that the system ran "badly".{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=194|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=84–85}} Considering the university a liberal enclave, he traveled the country giving lectures; proving popular, he adopted the position of ''de facto'' cultural attaché.{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=88|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=85–86}} As in France and Sweden, homosexual activity was legal but socially frowned upon in Poland, and he undertook relationships with a number of men; one was a Polish security agent who hoped to trap Foucault in an embarrassing situation, which would therefore reflect badly on the French embassy. Wracked in diplomatic scandal, he was ordered to leave Poland for a new destination.{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=89|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=86–87}} Various positions were available in [[West Germany]], and so Foucault relocated to the {{Interlanguage link multi|Institut français Hamburg|de}} (where he was director in 1958–60), teaching the same courses he had given in Uppsala and Warsaw.{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=89–90|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=87–88}}&lt;ref name="21st Century"&gt;Sam Binkley, Jorge Capetillo (eds.), ''A Foucault for the 21st Century: Governmentality, Biopolitics and Discipline in the New Millennium'', Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2009, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Spending much time in the [[Reeperbahn]] [[red light district]], he entered into a relationship with a [[transvestite]].{{Sfn|Macey|1993|p=88}}

==Growing career==

===''Madness and Civilization'': 1960===
{{rquote|right|Histoire de la folie ''is not an easy text to read, and it defies attempts to summarise its contents. Foucault refers to a bewildering variety of sources, ranging from well-known authors such as [[Erasmus]] and [[Molière]] to archival documents and forgotten figures in the history of medicine and psychiatry. His erudition derives from years pondering, to cite [[Edgar Allan Poe|Poe]], '[[The Raven|over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore]]', and his learning is not always worn lightly.''|Foucault biographer [[David Macey]], 1993{{Sfn|Macey|1993|p=96}}}}

In West Germany, Foucault completed in 1960 his primary thesis (''thèse principale'') for his [[State doctorate]], entitled ''[[Madness and Civilization|Folie et déraison: Histoire de la folie à l'âge classique]]'' (''Madness and Insanity: History of Madness in the Classical Age''), a philosophical work based upon his studies into the [[history of medicine]]. The book discussed how West European society had dealt with [[Insanity|madness]], arguing that it was a social construct distinct from [[mental illness]]. Foucault traces the evolution of the concept of madness through three phases: the [[Renaissance]], the later 17th and 18th centuries, and the modern experience. The work alludes to the work of French poet and playwright [[Antonin Artaud]], who exerted a strong influence over Foucault's thought at the time.{{Sfnm|1a1=Macey|1y=1993|1p=102|2a1=Miller|2y=1993|2p=96}}

''Histoire de la folie'' was an expansive work, consisting of 943 pages of text, followed by appendices and a bibliography.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|p=101}} Foucault submitted it at the [[University of Paris]], although the university's regulations for awarding a State doctorate required the submission of both his main thesis and a shorter complementary thesis.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=90–92|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=88–89}} Obtaining a doctorate in France at the period was a multi-step process. The first step was to obtain a ''rapporteur'', or "sponsor" for the work: Foucault chose [[Georges Canguilhem]].{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=101–02|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=103–06}} The second was to find a publisher, and as a result ''Folie et déraison'' would be published in French in May 1961 by the company [[Plon]], whom Foucault chose over [[Presses Universitaires de France]] after being rejected by [[Gallimard]].{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=105–07|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=106–09|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3pp=117–18}} In 1964, a heavily abridged version was published as a mass market paperback, then translated into English for publication the following year as ''Madness and Civilization''.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=122|2a1=Miller|2y=1993|2pp=118}}

''Folie et déraison'' received a mixed reception in France and in foreign journals focusing on French affairs. Although it was critically acclaimed by [[Maurice Blanchot]], [[Michel Serres]], [[Roland Barthes]], [[Gaston Bachelard]], and [[Fernand Braudel]], it was largely ignored by the leftist press, much to Foucault's disappointment.{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=116|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=113–19|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3p=118}} It was notably criticised for advocating [[metaphysics]] by young philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]] in a March 1963 lecture at the [[University of Paris]]. Responding with a vicious retort, Foucault criticised Derrida's interpretation of [[René Descartes]]. The two remained bitter rivals until reconciling in 1981.{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=119–21|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=142–45|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3pp=118–19}} In the English-speaking world, the work became a significant influence on the [[anti-psychiatry]] movement during the 1960s; Foucault took a mixed approach to this, associating with a number of anti-psychiatrists but arguing that most of them misunderstood his work.{{Sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=122–26}}

Foucault's secondary thesis (his ''thèse complémentaire'' written in Hamburg between 1959 and 1960) was a translation and commentary on German philosopher Immanuel Kant's 1798 work ''Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View'' (the title of his thesis was "Introduction à l{{'}}''Anthropologie''", "[[Introduction to Kant's Anthropology|Introduction to Kant's ''Anthropology'']]").&lt;ref name="21st Century"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.generation-online.org/p/fpfoucault1.htm "Introduction to Kant's Anthropology from a pragmatic point of view" (English translation)]&lt;/ref&gt; Largely consisting of Foucault's discussion of textual dating—an "archaeology of the Kantian text"—he rounded off the thesis with an evocation of Nietzsche, his biggest philosophical influence.{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=110|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=89}} This work's ''rapporteur'' was his old tutor and then director of the ENS, Hyppolite, who was well acquainted with German philosophy.{{Sfn|Eribon|1991|p=101}} After both theses were championed and reviewed, he underwent his public defense, the ''soutenance de thèse'', on 20 May 1961.{{Sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=111–13}} The academics responsible for reviewing his work were concerned about the unconventional nature of his major thesis; reviewer [[Henri Gouhier]] noted that it was not a conventional work of history, making sweeping generalisations without sufficient particular argument, and that Foucault clearly "thinks in allegories".{{Sfn|Miller|1993|pp=104–05}} They all agreed however that the overall project was of merit, awarding Foucault his doctorate "despite reservations".{{Sfn|Eribon|1991|p=115}}

===University of Clermont-Ferrand, ''The Birth of the Clinic'', and ''The Order of Things'': 1960–66===
In October 1960, Foucault took a tenured post in philosophy at the [[Blaise Pascal University|University of Clermont-Ferrand]], commuting to the city every week from Paris,{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=129|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=109}} where he lived in a high-rise block on the rue du Dr Finlay.{{Sfn|Macey|1993|p=92}} Responsible for teaching psychology, which was subsumed within the philosophy department, he was considered a "fascinating" but "rather traditional" teacher at Clermont.{{Sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=140–41}} The department was run by [[Jules Vuillemin]], who soon developed a friendship with Foucault.{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=131|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=109}} Foucault then took Vuillemin's job when the latter was elected to the [[Collège de France]] in 1962.{{Sfn|Eribon|1991|p=137}} In this position, Foucault took a dislike to another staff member whom he considered stupid: [[Roger Garaudy]], a senior figure in the Communist Party. Foucault made life at the university difficult for Garaudy, leading the latter to transfer to Poitiers.{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=136–38|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=109–10}} Foucault also caused controversy by securing a university job for his lover, the philosopher [[Daniel Defert]], with whom he retained a non-monogamous relationship for the rest of his life.{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=141–42|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=92–93, 110|3a1=Halperin|3y=1997|3p=214}}

[[File:Raymond roussel.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Foucault adored the work of Raymond Roussel and authored a literary study of it.]]

Foucault maintained a keen interest in literature, publishing reviews in amongst others the literary journals ''[[Tel Quel]]'' and ''[[Nouvelle Revue Française]]'', and sitting on the editorial board of ''Critique''.{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=141, 151|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=120–21}} In May 1963, he published a book devoted to poet, novelist, and playwright [[Raymond Roussel]]. It was written in under two months, published by [[Gallimard]], and would be described by biographer [[David Macey]] as "a very personal book" that resulted from a "love affair" with Roussel's work. It would be published in English in 1983 as ''Death and the Labyrinth: The World of Raymond Roussel''.{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=145–48|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=124–29}} Receiving few reviews, it was largely ignored.{{Sfn|Macey|1993|pp=140–42}} That same year he published a sequel to '' Folie et déraison'', entitled ''Naissance de la Clinique'', subsequently translated as ''[[The Birth of the Clinic|The Birth of the Clinic: An Archaeology of Medical Perception]]''. Shorter than its predecessor, it focused on the changes that the medical establishment underwent in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=152–54|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=130–37}} Like his preceding work, ''Naissance de la Clinique'' was largely critically ignored, but later gained a cult following.{{Sfn|Macey|1993|pp=140–42}} It was of interest within the field of [[medical ethics]], as it considered the ways in which the history of medicine and hospitals, and the training that those working within them receive, bring about a particular way of looking at the body - the 'medical gaze'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Birth Of The Clinic|last=Foucault|first=Michel|publisher=Tavistock Publications Limited|year=1973|isbn=|location=|pages=35–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault was also selected to be among the "Eighteen Man Commission" that assembled between November 1963 and March 1964 to discuss university reforms that were to be implemented by [[Christian Fouchet]], the Gaullist [[Ministry of National Education (France)|Minister of National Education]]. Implemented in 1967, they brought staff strikes and student protests.{{Sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=133–36}}

In April 1966, Gallimard published Foucault's ''Les Mots et les choses'' ("Words and Things"), later translated as ''[[The Order of Things|The Order of Things: An Archaeology of the Human Sciences]]''.{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=155–56|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=159}} Exploring how man came to be an object of knowledge, it argued that all periods of history have possessed certain underlying conditions of truth that constituted what was acceptable as scientific discourse. Foucault argues that these conditions of discourse have changed over time, from one period's [[episteme]] to another.{{Sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=158–59}} Although designed for a specialist audience, the work gained media attention, becoming a surprise bestseller in France.{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=155, 159|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=160}} Appearing at the height of interest in [[structuralism]], Foucault was quickly grouped with scholars [[Jacques Lacan]], [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], and [[Roland Barthes]], as the latest wave of thinkers set to topple the [[existentialism]] popularized by [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. Although initially accepting this description, Foucault soon vehemently rejected it.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pages=1605–162, 167}} Foucault and Sartre regularly criticised one another in the press. Both Sartre and [[Simone de Beauvoir]] attacked Foucault's ideas as "[[bourgeois]]", while Foucault retaliated against their Marxist beliefs by proclaiming that "Marxism exists in nineteenth-century thought as a fish exists in water; that is, it ceases to breathe anywhere else."{{Sfn|Macey|1993|pp=173–77}}

===University of Tunis and Vincennes: 1966–70===
{{rquote|right|''I lived [in Tunisia] for two and a half years. It made a real impression. I was present for large, violent student riots that preceded by several weeks what happened in May in France. This was March 1968. The unrest lasted a whole year: strikes, courses suspended, arrests. And in March, a general strike by the students. The police came into the university, beat up the students, wounded several of them seriously, and started making arrests ... I have to say that I was tremendously impressed by those young men and women who took terrible risks by writing or distributing tracts or calling for strikes, the ones who really risked losing their freedom! It was a political experience for me.''|Michel Foucault, 1983{{Sfn|Eribon|1991|p=194}}}}

In September 1966, Foucault took a position teaching psychology at the [[University of Tunis]] in [[Tunisia]]. His decision to do so was largely because his lover, Defert, had been posted to the country as part of his [[national service]]. Foucault moved a few kilometres from [[Tunis]], to the village of [[Sidi Bou Saïd]], where fellow academic Gérard Deledalle lived with his wife. Soon after his arrival, Foucault announced that Tunisia was "blessed by history", a nation which "deserves to live forever because it was where [[Hannibal]] and [[St. Augustine]] lived."{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=187–88|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=145–46}} His lectures at the university proved very popular, and were well attended. Although many young students were enthusiastic about his teaching, they were critical of what they believed to be his right-wing political views, viewing him as a "representative of Gaullist technocracy", even though he considered himself a [[Left-wing politics|leftist]].{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=188–89}}

Foucault was in Tunis during the anti-government and pro-Palestinian riots that rocked the city in June 1967, and which continued for a year. Although highly critical of the violent, ultra-nationalistic and anti-semitic nature of many protesters, he used his status to try to prevent some of his militant leftist students from being arrested and tortured for their role in the agitation. He hid their printing press in his garden, and tried to testify on their behalf at their trials, but was prevented when the trials became closed-door events.{{Sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=192–93}} While in Tunis, Foucault continued to write. Inspired by a correspondence with the surrealist artist [[René Magritte]], Foucault started to write a book about the [[impressionism|impressionist]] artist [[Édouard Manet]], but never completed it.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=190|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=173}}

In 1968, Foucault returned to Paris, moving into an apartment on the Rue de Vaugirard.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|p=198}} After the May 1968 student protests, Minister of Education [[Edgar Faure]] responded by founding new universities with greater autonomy. Most prominent of these was the [[Paris VIII|Centre Expérimental de Vincennes]] in [[Vincennes]] on the outskirts of Paris. A group of prominent academics were asked to select teachers to run the Centre's departments, and Canguilheim recommended Foucault as head of the Philosophy Department.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=201–02}} Becoming a tenured professor of Vincennes, Foucault's desire was to obtain "the best in French philosophy today" for his department, employing [[Michel Serres]], [[Judith Miller (philosopher)|Judith Miller]], [[Alain Badiou]], [[Jacques Rancière]], [[François Regnault]], [[Henri Weber]], [[Étienne Balibar]], and [[François Châtelet]]; most of them were Marxists or ultra-left activists.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=203–05}}

Lectures began at the university in January 1969, and straight away its students and staff, including Foucault, were involved in occupations and clashes with police, resulting in arrests.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|p=205}} In February, Foucault gave a speech denouncing police provocation to protesters at the Latin Quarter of the Mutualité.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|p=206}} Such actions marked Foucault's embrace of the ultra-left,{{sfn|Eribon|1991|p=201}} undoubtedly influenced by Defert, who had gained a job at Vincennes' sociology department and who had become a [[Maoism|Maoist]].{{sfn|Eribon|1991|p=209}} Most of the courses at Foucault's philosophy department were [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] oriented, although Foucault himself gave courses on Nietzsche, "The end of Metaphysics", and "The Discourse of Sexuality", which were highly popular and over-subscribed.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|p=207}} While the right-wing press was heavily critical of this new institution, new Minister of Education [[Olivier Guichard]] was angered by its ideological bent and the lack of exams, with students being awarded degrees in a haphazard manner. He refused national accreditation of the department's degrees, resulting in a public rebuttal from Foucault.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=207–08}}

==Later life==

===Collège de France and ''Discipline and Punish'': 1970–75===
Foucault desired to leave Vincennes and become a fellow of the prestigious [[Collège de France]]. He requested to join, taking up a chair in what he called the "history of systems of thought," and his request was championed by members Dumézil, Hyppolite, and Vuillemin. In November 1969, when an opening became available, Foucault was elected to the Collège, though with opposition by a large minority.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=212–18}} He gave his inaugural lecture in December 1970, which was subsequently published as ''L'Ordre du discours'' (''The Discourse of Language'').{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=212, 219}} He was obliged to give 12 weekly lectures a year—and did so for the rest of his life—covering the topics that he was researching at the time; these became "one of the events of Parisian intellectual life" and were repeatedly packed out events.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=222–23}} On Mondays, he also gave seminars to a group of students; many of them became a "Foulcauldian tribe" who worked with him on his research. He enjoyed this teamwork and collective research, and together they would publish a number of short books.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=256–58}} Working at the Collège allowed him to travel widely, giving lectures in Brazil, Japan, Canada, and the United States over the next 14 years.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|p=310}}  In 1970 and 1972, Foucault served as a professor in the French Department of the [[University at Buffalo]] in Buffalo, New York.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, James, ''The Passion of Michel Foucault'', Harvard University Press, 2000, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1971, Foucault co-founded the Groupe d'Information sur les Prisons (GIP) along with historian [[Pierre Vidal-Naquet]] and journalist [[Jean-Marie Domenach]]. The GIP aimed to investigate and expose poor conditions in prisons and give prisoners and ex-prisoners a voice in French society. It was highly critical of the penal system, believing that it converted petty criminals into hardened delinquents.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=224–29}} The GIP gave press conferences and staged protests surrounding the events of the Toul prison riot in December 1971, alongside other prison riots that it sparked off; in doing so it faced a police crackdown and repeated arrests.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=231–32}} The group became active across France, with 2,000 to 3,000, members, but disbanded before 1974.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=233–34}} Also campaigning against the [[death penalty]], Foucault co-authored a short book on the case of the executed murderer [[Pierre Rivière]].{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=234–35}} After his research into the penal system, Foucault published ''Surveiller et punir: Naissance de la prison'' (''[[Discipline and Punish]]'') in 1975, offering a history of the system in western Europe. In it, Foucault examines the penal evolution away from corporal and capital punishment to the penitentiary system that began in Europe and the United States around the end of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Druzin|first=Bryan|year=2015|title=The Theatre of Punishment: Case Studies in the Political Function of Corporal and Capital Punishment|url=https://works.bepress.com/bryan_druzin/14/|journal=Washington University Global Studies Law Review|volume=14|page=359}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biographer [[Didier Eribon]] described it as "perhaps the finest" of Foucault's works, and it was well received.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=235–36}}

Foucault was also active in [[anti-racism|anti-racist]] campaigns; in November 1971, he was a leading figure in protests following the perceived racist killing of Arab migrant Dejellali Ben Ali.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} In this he worked alongside his old rival Sartre, the journalist [[Claude Mauriac]], and one of his literary heroes, Jean Genet. This campaign was formalised as the Committee for the Defence of the Rights of Immigrants, but there was tension at their meetings as Foucault opposed the anti-Israeli sentiment of many Arab workers and Maoist activists.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=238–42}} At a December 1972 protest against the police killing of Algerian worker Mohammad Diab, both Foucault and Genet were arrested, resulting in widespread publicity.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=241–42}} Foucault was also involved in founding the Agence de Press-Libération (APL), a group of leftist journalists who intended to cover news stories neglected by the mainstream press. In 1973, they established the daily newspaper ''[[Libération]]'', and Foucault suggested that they establish committees across France to collect news and distribute the paper, and advocated a column known as the "Chronicle of the Workers' Memory" to allow workers' to express their opinions. Foucault wanted an active journalistic role in the paper,  but this proved untenable, and he soon became disillusioned with ''Libération'', believing that it distorted the facts; he would not publish in it until 1980.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=250–54}}

===''The History of Sexuality'' and Iranian Revolution: 1976–79===
In 1976, Gallimard published Foucault's ''[[The History of Sexuality|Histoire de la sexualité: la volonté de savoir]]'' (''The History of Sexuality: The Will to Knowledge''), a short book exploring what Foucault called the "repressive hypothesis". It revolved largely around the concept of power, rejecting both Marxist and Freudian theory. Foucault intended it as the first in a seven-volume exploration of the subject.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=269–74}} ''Histoire de la sexualité'' was a best-seller in France and gained positive press, but lukewarm intellectual interest, something that upset Foucault, who felt that many misunderstood his hypothesis.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=275–76}} He soon became dissatisfied with Gallimard after being offended by senior staff member [[Pierre Nora]].{{sfn|Eribon|1991|p=292}} Along with [[Paul Veyne]] and [[François Wahl]], Foucault launched a new series of academic books, known as ''Des travaux'' (''Some Works''), through the company [[Seuil]], which he hoped would improve the state of academic research in France.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=193–95}} He also produced introductions for the memoirs of [[Herculine Barbin]] and ''[[My Secret Life (erotica)|My Secret Life]]''.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=277–78}}

{{rquote|right|''There exists an international citizenry that has its rights, and has its duties, and that is committed to rise up against every abuse of power, no matter who the author, no matter who the victims. After all, we are all ruled, and as such, we are in solidarity.''|Michel Foucault, 1981{{sfn|Eribon|1991|p=79}}}}

Foucault remained a political activist, focusing on protesting government abuses of human rights around the world. He was a key player in the 1975 protests against the Spanish government to execute 11 militants sentenced to death without fair trial. It was his idea to travel to [[Madrid]] with 6 others to give their press conference there; they were subsequently arrested and deported back to Paris.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=263–66}} In 1977, he protested the extradition of [[Klaus Croissant]] to West Germany, and his rib was fractured during clashes with riot police.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|p=280}} In July that year, he organised an assembly of [[Eastern Bloc]] dissidents to mark the visit of Soviet Premier [[Leonid Brezhnev]] to Paris.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|p=278}} In 1979, he campaigned for Vietnamese political dissidents to be granted asylum in France.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=278–79}}

In 1977, Italian newspaper ''[[Corriere della sera]]'' asked Foucault to write a column for them. In doing so, in 1978 he travelled to [[Tehran]] in [[Iran]], days after the [[Black Friday (1978)|Black Friday]] massacre. Documenting the developing [[Iranian Revolution]], he met with opposition leaders such as [[Mohammad Kazem Shariatmadari]] and [[Mehdi Bazargan]], and discovered the popular support for [[Islamism]].{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=281–85}} Returning to France, he was one of the journalists who visited the [[Ayatollah Khomeini]], before visiting Tehran. His articles expressed awe of Khomeini's Islamist movement, for which he was widely criticised in the French press, including by Iranian expatriates. Foucault's response was that Islamism was to become a major political force in the region, and that the West must treat it with respect rather than hostility.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=285–88}} In April 1978, Foucault traveled to Japan, where he studied [[Zen Buddhism]] under [[Omori Sogen]] at the [[Seionji temple]] in [[Uenohara]].{{sfn|Eribon|1991|p=310}}

===Final years: 1980–84===
Although remaining critical of power relations, Foucault expressed cautious support for the [[French Socialist Party|Socialist Party]] government of [[François Mitterrand]] following its [[French presidential election, 1981|electoral victory in 1981]].{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=296–97}} But his support soon deteriorated when that party refused to condemn the Polish government's crackdown on the [[1982 demonstrations in Poland]] orchestrated by the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] trade union. He and sociologist [[Pierre Bourdieu]] authored a document condemning Mitterrand's inaction that was published in ''Libération'', and they also took part in large public protests on the issue.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=298–302}} Foucault continued to support Solidarity, and with his friend [[Simone Signoret]] traveled to Poland as part of a [[Médecins du Monde]] expedition, taking time out to visit the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]].{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=303–03}} He continued his academic research, and in June 1984 Gallimard published the second and third volumes of ''Histoire de la sexualité''. Volume two, ''L'Usage des plaisirs'', dealt with the "techniques of self" prescribed by ancient Greek pagan morality in relation to sexual ethics, while volume three, ''Le Souci de soi'', explored the same theme in the Greek and Latin texts of the first two centuries CE. A fourth volume, ''Les Aveux de la chair'', was to examine sexuality in early Christianity, but it was not finished.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=317–23}}

In October 1980, Foucault became a visiting professor at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], giving the Howison Lectures on "Truth and Subjectivity", while in November he lectured at the Humanities Institute at [[New York University]]. His growing popularity in American intellectual circles was noted by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, while Foucault went on to lecture at [[UCLA]] in 1981, the [[University of Vermont]] in 1982, and Berkeley again in 1983, where his lectures drew huge crowds.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=313–14}} Foucault spent many evenings in the San Francisco gay scene, frequenting [[sado-masochism|sado-masochistic]] bathhouses, engaging in unprotected sex. He would praise sado-masochistic activity in interviews with the gay press, describing it as "the real creation of new possibilities of pleasure, which people had no idea about previously."{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=314–16|2a1=Miller|2y=1993|2pp=26–27}} Foucault contracted HIV and eventually developed AIDS. Little was known of the virus at the time; the first cases had only been identified in 1980.{{sfn|Miller|1993|pp=21–22}} In summer 1983, he developed a persistent dry cough, which concerned friends in Paris, but Foucault insisted it was just a pulmonary infection.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=324–25|2a1=Miller|2y=1993|2p=26}} Only when hospitalized was Foucault correctly diagnosed; treated with antibiotics, he delivered a final set of lectures at the Collège de France.{{sfn|Miller|1993|p=23}} Foucault entered Paris' Hôpital de la [[Salpêtrière]]—the same institution that he had studied in ''Madness and Civilisation''—on 10 June 1984, with neurological symptoms complicated by [[septicemia]]. He died in the hospital on 25 June.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=357|2a1=Miller|2y=1993|2pp=21, 24}}

On 26 June, ''Libération'' announced his death, mentioning the rumour that it had been brought on by AIDS. The following day, ''[[Le Monde]]'' issued a medical bulletin cleared by his family which made no reference to HIV/AIDS.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=327|2a1=Miller|2y=1993|2p=21}} On 29 June, Foucault's ''la levée du corps'' ceremony was held, in which the coffin was carried from the hospital morgue. Hundreds attended, including activist and academic friends, while [[Gilles Deleuze]] gave a speech using excerpts from ''The History of Sexuality''.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=329|2a1=Miller|2y=1993|2pp=34–36}} His body was then buried at [[Vendeuvre]] in a small ceremony.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|p=330}} Soon after his death, Foucault's partner [[Daniel Defert]] founded the first national HIV/AIDS organisation in France, [[AIDES]]; a pun on the French language word for "help" (''aide'') and the English language acronym for the disease.{{sfn|Miller|1993|pp=23–24}} On the second anniversary of Foucault's death, Defert publicly revealed that Foucault's death was AIDS-related in ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]''.{{sfn|Miller|1993|pp=24–25}}

==Personal life==
Foucault's first biographer, [[Didier Eribon]], described the philosopher as "a complex, many-sided character", and that "under one mask there is always another".{{Sfn|Eribon|1991|p=xi}} He also noted that he exhibited an "enormous capacity for work".{{Sfn|Eribon|1991|p=64}} At the ENS, Foucault's classmates unanimously summed him up as a figure who was both "disconcerting and strange" and "a passionate worker".{{Sfn|Eribon|1991|p=30}} As he aged, his personality changed: Eribon noted that while he was a "tortured adolescent", post-1960, he had become "a radiant man, relaxed and cheerful", even being described by those who worked with him as a [[dandy]].{{Sfn|Eribon|1991|p=138}} He noted that in 1969, Foucault embodied the idea of "the militant intellectual".{{sfn|Eribon|1991|p=210}}

Foucault was an [[atheist]].&lt;ref&gt;"If I were not a total atheist, I would be a monk...a good monk." David Macey (2004).

Taylor &amp; Francis, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a fan of [[classical music]], particularly enjoying the work of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]],{{sfn|Eribon|1991|p=83}} and became known for wearing [[Polo neck|turtleneck jumpers]].{{sfn|Eribon|1991|p=311}} After his death, Foucault's friend [[Georges Dumézil]] described him as having possessed "a profound kindness and goodness", also exhibiting an "intelligence [that] literally knew no bounds."{{sfn|Eribon|1991|p=329}} His life-partner [[Daniel Defert]] inherited his estate.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Thought==
{{further|Michel Foucault bibliography}}
Foucault's colleague [[Pierre Bourdieu]] summarised the philosopher's thought as "a long exploration of transgression, of going beyond social limits, always inseparably linked to knowledge and power."{{sfn|Eribon|1991|p=328}}

{{rquote|right|''The theme that underlies all Foucault's work is the relationship between power and knowledge, and how the former is used to control and define the latter. What authorities claim as 'scientific knowledge' are really just means of social control. Foucault shows how, for instance, in the eighteenth century 'madness' was used to categorise and stigmatise not just the mentally ill but the poor, the sick, the homeless and, indeed, anyone whose expressions of individuality were unwelcome.''|Philip Stokes, ''Philosophy: 100 Essential Thinkers'' (2004){{Sfn|Stokes|2004|p=187}}}}

Philosopher Philip Stokes of the [[University of Reading]] noted that overall, Foucault's work was "dark and pessimistic", but that it did leave some room for optimism, in that it illustrates how the discipline of philosophy can be used to highlight areas of domination. In doing so, Stokes claimed, we are able to understand how we are being dominated and strive to build social structures that minimise this risk of domination.{{Sfn|Stokes|2004|p=187}} In all of this development there had to be close attention to detail; it is the detail which eventually individualises people.&lt;ref name="Marshall1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=J.D. Marshall|title=Michel Foucault: Personal Autonomy and Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qN2CrfVRJSAC&amp;pg=PA126|accessdate=6 December 2012|date=30 June 1996|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-7923-4016-4|page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in his life, Foucault explained that his work was less about analysing power as a phenomenon than about trying to characterise the different ways in which contemporary society has expressed the use of power to "objectivise subjects." These have taken three broad forms: one involving scientific authority to classify and 'order' knowledge about human populations. A second, and related form, has been to categorise and 'normalise' human subjects (by identifying madness, illness, physical features, and so on). The third relates to the manner in which the impulse to fashion sexual identities and train one's own body to engage in routines and practices ends up reproducing certain patterns within a given society.&lt;ref name="Foucault1982"&gt;{{cite book|last = Foucault | first = Michel |title=The Subject and Power|url=http://foucault.info/documents/foucault.power.en.html|accessdate=25 November 2014|date=1982|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn= 9780226163123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political===
Politically, Foucault was a leftist through much of his life, but his particular stance within the left often changed. Towards the end, as he suffered from AIDS, he adopted [[classical liberalism]] and had a strong interest in [[Stoicism|Stoic philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Kuznicki|first=Jason |authorlink= |editor-first=Ronald |editor-last=Hamowy |editor-link=Ronald Hamowy |encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Libertarianism |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=yxNgXs3TkJYC |year=2008 |publisher= [[SAGE Publications|SAGE]]; [[Cato Institute]] |location= Thousand Oaks, CA  |isbn= 978-1-4129-6580-4 |oclc=750831024| lccn = 2008009151 |pages=189–81 |doi= 10.4135/9781412965811.n110|quote= |ref= |chapter=Foucault, Michel (1926–1984) |title=The Encyclopedia of Libertarianism }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1950s he had been a member of the [[French Communist Party]], although he never adopted an orthodox [[Marxism|Marxist]] viewpoint and left the party after three years, disgusted by the prejudice against Jews and homosexuals within its ranks. After spending some time working in Poland, then governed as a [[socialist state]] by the [[Polish United Workers' Party]], he became further disillusioned with communist ideology. As a result, in the early 1960s he was considered to be "violently anticommunist" by some of his detractors,{{Sfn|Eribon|1991|p=136}} even though he was involved in leftist campaigns along with most of his students and colleagues.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

===Literature===
In addition to his philosophical work, Foucault also wrote on [[literature]]. ''Death and the Labyrinth: The World of Raymond Roussel'' was published in 1963, and translated into English in 1986. It is Foucault's only book-length work on literature. Foucault described it as "by far the book I wrote most easily, with the greatest pleasure, and most rapidly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Foucault | first = Michel | title = Death and the labyrinth : the world of Raymond Roussel | publisher = Continuum | location = London New York | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-0-8264-9362-0 |chapter=An Interview with Michel Foucault by Charles Ruas |page=186 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault explores theory, criticism, and psychology with reference to the texts of [[Raymond Roussel]], one of the first notable experimental writers.

==Influence==
Foucault's discussions on power and discourse have inspired many [[critical theory|critical theorists]], who believe that Foucault's analysis of power structures could aid the struggle against inequality. They claim that through [[discourse analysis]], hierarchies may be uncovered and questioned by way of analyzing the corresponding fields of knowledge through which they are legitimated.  This is one of the ways that Foucault's work is linked to critical theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Van Loon | first = Borin  | title = Introducing Critical Theory | publisher=Icon Books Ltd. | location = Thriplow | year = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; His discussion on power and discourse also influences the postcolonial critique in explaining the discursive formation of colonialism &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Said | first = Edward | title = Orientalism | publisher=Vintage Books | location = New York | year = 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault's work has been compared to that of [[Erving Goffman]] by the sociologist [[Michael Hviid Jacobsen]] and Soren Kristiansen, who list Goffman as an influence on Foucault.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Social Thought of Erving Goffman|last1=Jacobsen|first1=Michael Hviid|last2=Kristiansen|first2=Soren|publisher=SAGE Publications|year=2014|isbn=978-1412998031|location=London|pages=5, 86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Foucault was listed as the most cited scholar in the humanities by the ''[[ISI Web of Science]]'' among a large quantity of French philosophers, the compilation's author commenting that "What this says of modern scholarship is for the reader to decide—and it is imagined that judgments will vary from admiration to despair, depending on one's view".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=405956&amp;sectioncode=26 |title=The most cited authors of books in the humanities |publisher=timeshighereducation.co.uk |date=26 March 2009 |accessdate=16 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critiques and engagements===

====Crypto-normativity====
{{main|Foucault–Habermas debate}}
A prominent critique of Foucault's thought concerns his refusal to propose positive solutions to the social and political issues that he critiques. Since no human relation is devoid of power, freedom becomes elusive—even as an ideal. This stance which critiques normativity as socially constructed and contingent, but which relies on an implicit norm in order to mount the critique led philosopher [[Jürgen Habermas]] to describe Foucault's thinking as  "crypto-normativist", covertly reliant on the very [[age of enlightenment|Enlightenment]] principles he attempts to argue against.&lt;ref&gt;Ashenden, S., &amp; Owen, D. (Eds.). (1999). Foucault contra Habermas: Recasting the dialogue between genealogy and critical theory. Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar critique has been advanced by [[Diana Taylor (professor)|Diana Taylor]], and by [[Nancy Fraser]] who argues that "Foucault's critique encompasses traditional moral systems, he denies himself recourse to concepts such as 'freedom' and 'justice', and therefore lacks the ability to generate positive alternatives."&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, D. (2010). Michel Foucault: key concepts. Acumen. pp. 2–3&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, scholar Nancy Pearcey points out Foucault's paradoxical stance: "[when someone] states that it is impossible to attain objectivity, is that an objective statement? The theory undercuts its own claims."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Finding Truth|last=Pearcey|first=Nancy|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=978-0781413084|location=|page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Genealogy as historical method====
The philosopher [[Richard Rorty]] has argued that Foucault's 'archaeology of knowledge' is fundamentally negative, and thus fails to adequately establish any 'new' theory of knowledge ''per se''. Rather, Foucault simply provides a few valuable maxims regarding the reading of history. Rorty writes:

{{quote|As far as I can see, all he has to offer are brilliant redescriptions of the past, supplemented by helpful hints on how to avoid being trapped by old historiographical assumptions. These hints consist largely of saying: "do not look for progress or meaning in history; do not see the history of a given activity, of any segment of culture, as the development of rationality or of freedom; do not use any philosophical vocabulary to characterize the essence of such activity or the goal it serves; do not assume that the way this activity is presently conducted gives any clue to the goals it served in the past.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Rorty. ''Foucault and Epistemology'' in Hoy, D (eds) 'Foucault: A critical reader' Basil Blackwell. Oxford, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Foucault has frequently been criticized by historians for what they consider to be a lack of rigor in his analyses.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, S. (2003). Michel Foucault: Routledge Critical Thinkers. Chicago p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Hans-Ulrich Wehler]] harshly criticized Foucault in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Wehler, Hans-Ulrich (1998): ''Die Herausforderung der Kulturgeschichte'', pp. 45–95. {{ISBN|3-406-42076-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wehler regards Foucault as a bad philosopher who wrongfully received a good response by the humanities and by social sciences. According to Wehler, Foucault's works are not only insufficient in their empiric historical aspects, but also often contradictory and lacking in clarity. For example, Foucault's concept of power is "desperatingly undifferentiated", and Foucault's thesis of a "disciplinary society" is, according to Wehler, only possible because Foucault does not properly differentiate between authority, force, power, violence and legitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;Wehler, Hans-Ulrich (1998): ''Die Herausforderung der Kulturgeschichte'', p. 81. {{ISBN|3-406-42076-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, his thesis is based on a one-sided choice of sources (prisons and psychiatric institutions) and neglects other types of organizations as e.g. factories. Also, Wehler criticizes Foucault's "francocentrism" because he did not take into consideration major German-speaking theorists of social sciences like [[Max Weber]] and [[Norbert Elias]]. In all, Wehler concludes that Foucault is "because of the endless series of flaws in his so-called empirical studies ... an intellectually dishonest, empirically absolutely unreliable, crypto-normativist seducer of Postmodernism".&lt;ref&gt;Wehler, Hans-Ulrich (1998): ''Die Herausforderung der Kulturgeschichte'', p. 91. {{ISBN|3-406-42076-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Feminist critiques====
Though American feminists have built on Foucault's critiques of the historical construction of gender roles and sexuality, some feminists note the limitations of the masculinist subjectivity and ethical orientation that he describes.&lt;ref name="Downing, Lisa 2008"&gt;Downing, Lisa. "The Cambridge Introduction to Michel Foucault." (2008). Cambridge University Press. pp.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2016}}

====Sexuality====
The philosopher [[Roger Scruton]] argues in ''[[Sexual Desire (book)|Sexual Desire]]'' (1986) that Foucault was incorrect to claim, in ''The History of Sexuality'', that sexual morality is culturally relative. He criticizes Foucault for assuming that there could be societies in which a "problematisation" of the sexual did not occur, concluding that, "No history of thought could show the 'problematisation' of sexual experience to be peculiar to certain specific social formations: it is characteristic of personal experience generally, and therefore of every genuine social order."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sexual Desire: A Philosophical Investigation|last1=Scruton|first1=Roger|publisher=Phoenix Books|year=1994|isbn=978-1-85799-100-0|location=London|pages=34, 362}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foucault's approach to sexuality, which he sees as socially constructed, has become influential in [[queer theory]]. Foucault's resistance to identity politics, and his rejection of the psychoanalytic concept of object choice, stands at odds with some theories of queer identity.&lt;ref name="Downing, Lisa 2008"/&gt;

====Social constructionism and human nature====
Foucault is sometimes criticized for his prominent formulation of principles of [[social constructionism]], which some see as an affront to the concept of [[truth]]. In Foucault's 1971 [[Chomsky-Foucault Debate|televised debate]] with [[Noam Chomsky]], Foucault argued against the possibility of any fixed human nature, as posited by Chomsky's concept of innate human faculties. Chomsky argued that concepts of justice were rooted in human reason, whereas Foucault rejected the universal basis for a concept of justice.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkin, P. (1999). Chomsky and Foucault on human nature and politics: an essential difference?. Social Theory and Practice, pp. 177–210.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the debate, Chomsky was stricken with Foucault's total rejection of the possibility of a universal morality, stating "He struck me as completely amoral, I'd never met anyone who was so totally amoral [...] I mean, I liked him personally, it's just that I couldn't make sense of him. It's as if he was from a different species, or something."&lt;ref&gt;James Miller, Jim Miller. 1993.  The Passion of Michel Foucault. Harvard University Press, pp. 201–03&lt;/ref&gt;

====Education and authority====
Peruvian writer [[Mario Vargas Llosa]], while acknowledging that Foucault contributed to give a right of citizenship in cultural life to certain marginal and eccentric experiences (of sexuality, of cultural repression, of madness), asserts that his radical critique of authority was detrimental to education.&lt;ref&gt;Vargas Llosa, Mario (2010). Breve discurso sobre la cultura [Short Discourse on Culture]. ''Letras libres'' 139: 48–55 [http://www.letraslibres.com/revista/convivio/breve-discurso-sobre-la-cultura?page=full].&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault's notion of observation,&lt;ref&gt;Bentham, Jeremy (1791). ''Panopticon'' [https://archive.org/details/panopticonorins00bentgoog].&lt;/ref&gt; and its power to change individuals' behavior as a subtle type of authority, influences many fields of education.&lt;ref&gt;Kislev, Elyakim (2015). ''The Use of Participant-Observers in Group Therapy: A Critical Exploration in Light of Foucauldian Theory'' [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Elyakim_Kislev/publication/280076179_The_Use_of_Participant-Observers_in_Group_Therapy_A_Critical_Exploration_in_Light_of_Foucauldian_Theory/links/57ed3ac008ae711da9399422.pdf?origin=publication_detail].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mindfulness and technology''' is a movement in research and design, that encourages the user to become aware of the present moment, rather than losing oneself in a technological device. This field encompasses multidisciplinary participation between design, psychology, computer science, and religion. [[Mindfulness]] stems from Buddhist [[meditation]] practices and refers to the awareness that arises through paying attention on purpose in the present moment, and non-judgmentally. In the field of [[Human–computer interaction|Human-Computer Interaction]], research is being done on ''Techno-spirituality'' — the study of how technology can facilitate feelings of awe, wonder, transcendence, and mindfulness &lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Elizabeth A.

In 1979, [[Jon Kabat-Zinn]] founded the [[Mindfulness-based stress reduction|Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction]] (MBSR) program at the University of Massachusetts to treat the chronically ill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Stress Reduction|url = http://www.umassmed.edu/cfm/stress-reduction/|website = University of Massachusetts Medical School|accessdate = 2015-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is noted to be responsible for the popularization of mindfulness in Western culture. The program uses combination of mindfulness meditation, body awareness, and [[yoga]]. These practices were derived from teachings of the [[Eastern world|Eastern World]], specifically Buddhist traditions. Researchers found that enhanced mindfulness through the program mediated the association between increased daily spiritual experiences and improved mental health-related quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Changes in spirituality partly explain health-related quality of life outcomes after Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction|journal = Journal of behavioral medicine|date = 2011-12-01|issn = 0160-7715|pmc = 3151546|pmid = 21360283|pages = 508–518|volume = 34|issue = 6|doi = 10.1007/s10865-011-9332-x|first = Jeffrey M.|last = Greeson|first2 = Daniel M.|last2 = Webber|first3 = Moria J.|last3 = Smoski|first4 = Jeffrey G.|last4 = Brantley|first5 = Andrew G.|last5 = Ekblad|first6 = Edward C.|last6 = Suarez|first7 = Ruth Quillian|last7 = Wolever}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==

===Software===
There are applications for desktop and mobile to help users bring themselves back to the present moment.

====Mindfulness Bell====
According to Vietnamese Zen teacher [[Thích Nhất Hạnh|Thich Nhat Hanh]], the ringing of a bell every 15 minutes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Mindfulness Software {{!}} Plum Village|url = http://plumvillage.org/mindfulness-practice/mindfulness-software/|website = plumvillage.org|accessdate = 2015-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an effective way to cultivate the mindfulness practice and connect back with the body. The Mindfulness Bell and Mindful Mynah applications simulate the bell on the user's personal device.

====Meditation====

A 2011 brain imaging study published in the ''Journal of Neuroscience'' found that even very brief instruction in mindfulness meditation (four 20-minute sessions) was effective in relieving pain by reducing the brain's emotional response to painful stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The 8 Best Meditation Apps For Unwinding -- On The Go!|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/19/meditation-apps-inner-peace_n_2900544.html|website = The Huffington Post|accessdate = 2015-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; To help make meditation and mindfulness more accessible, developers have created digital health platforms, such as [[Headspace (digital health platform)|Headspace]], [[Insight Timer]] and Buddhify.

===Wearables===
There are several wearables which measures the breath in order to connect the user back to their body. Wo.Defy is a dress which attempts to reveal the beauty of emotional communication using the common platform of the human breath; proposing the best methods of human to human communication lie within us.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = wo.DEFY|url = https://wodefy.wordpress.com/|website = wo.DEFY|accessdate = 2015-11-10|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spire (activity tracker)|Spire]] measures your breathing patterns to give you insights into your state of mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Spire is the first wearable to track body, breath, and state of mind.|url = http://www.spire.io/|website = www.spire.io|accessdate = 2015-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [https://www.zensorium.com/being#introduction Being], the mindfulness tracker from [https://www.zensorium.com/ Zensorium], maps user’s emotions  (stressed, excited normal and calm) through heart rate variability.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|title = 5 pieces of wearable tech for meditation &amp; mindfulness|url = https://thenextweb.com/lifehacks/2015/10/10/5-pieces-of-wearable-tech-for-meditation-mindfulness/|website = The Next Web|accessdate = 2015-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-wellbe#/story WellBe] monitors heart rate levels and then matches them, through a patent pending algorithm, to specific moments and interactions throughout a user’s day.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; [https://www.smartmat.com/ SmartMat] is a responsive mat embedded with 21,000 sensors to detect your body’s balance, pressure and alignment.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; [http://prana.co/ Prana]'s platform evaluates breath patterns, takes into account the effects of posture on breathing, and differentiates between diaphragmatic and chest breathing, three critical components of assessing the true quality of breathing, previously unaddressed by systems such as spirometers or pulse oximeters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://prana.co/science/|title = Prana|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Virtual Reality===
Sonic Cradle enables users to shape sound with their breath while suspended in a completely dark chamber.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Jay Vidyarthi and Bernhard E. Riecke. 2013. Mediated meditation: cultivating mindfulness with sonic cradle. In CHI '13 Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI EA '13). ACM, New York, NY, USA, 2305-2314. {{DOI|10.1145/2468356.2468753}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers conducted a qualitative study with 39 participants to show how persuasive media have the potential to promote long-term psychological health by experientially introducing a stress-relieving, contemplative practice to non-practitioners.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Because the nature of chronic pain is complex, pharmacological analgesics are often not enough to achieve an ideal treatment plan. The system incorporates biofeedback sensors, an immersive virtual environment, and stereoscopic sound titled the "Virtual Meditative Walk" (VMW). It was designed to enable chronic pain patients to learn Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), a form of meditation. By providing real-time visual and sonic feedback, VMW enables patients to learn how to manage their pain.&lt;ref&gt;Diane Gromala, Xin Tong, Amber Choo, Mehdi Karamnejad, and Chris D. Shaw. 2015. The Virtual Meditative Walk: Virtual Reality Therapy for Chronic Pain Management. In Proceedings of the 33rd Annual ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI '15). ACM, New York, NY, USA, 521-524. {{DOI|10.1145/2702123.2702344}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techno-spirituality==
Intel anthropologist Genevieve Bell has urged the human-computer interaction (HCI) research community to devote more research to the use of technology in spirituality and religion. Techno-spirituality is the study of how technology can facilitate feelings of awe, wonder, transcendence, and mindfulness.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Currently, there are 6,000 applications related to spirituality and religion. This area is in high demand and “important under-explored areas of HCI research”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Spirituality: There's an App for That! (but Not a Lot of Research)|url = http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2468356.2468754|publisher = ACM|journal = CHI '13 Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems|date = 2013-01-01|location = New York, NY, USA|isbn = 978-1-4503-1952-2|pages = 2315–2324|series = CHI EA '13|doi = 10.1145/2468356.2468754|first = Elizabeth|last = Buie|first2 = Mark|last2 = Blythe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspired by Bell’s work, researchers (Sterling &amp; Zimmerman) focused on how mobile phones could be incorporated in American Soto Zen Buddhist community, without conflicting with their philosophy of “the here and the now”. They were able to find three ways to use technology to help strengthen ties within the community.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Shared Moments: Opportunities for Mobile Phones in Religious Participation|url = http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1389908.1389928|publisher = ACM|journal = Proceedings of the 2007 Conference on Designing for User eXperiences|date = 2007-01-01|location = New York, NY, USA|isbn = 978-1-60558-308-2|pages = 15:2–15:7|series = DUX '07|doi = 10.1145/1389908.1389928|first = Rhiannon|last = Sterling|first2 = John|last2 = Zimmerman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interaction Design==

===Slow Design===

[[Slow design]] is  a design agenda for technology aimed at reflection and moments of mental rest rather than efficiency in performance.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

===Mindful Design===
[[Design for behaviour change|Mindful design]], based on [[Ellen Langer|Langer]]’s theory of mindfulness,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mindfulness|last = Langer|first = E.J|publisher = Addison Wesley Publishing Company.|year = |isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Counterclockwise|last = Langer|first = E.J.|publisher = Hodder and Stoughton.|year = |isbn = |location = London|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a design philosophy that incorporates the idea of mindfulness into creating meaningful user oriented design.  A major tenant is the behavior change of a user through awareness and responsibility of meaningful interactions between user and designed object, and this will encourage more desirable human practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://niedderer.org/1961-1b.pdf|title = Mindful Design as a Driver for Social Behaviour Change.|last = Niedderer|first = K.|date = 2013|journal = Consilience and Innovation in Design - Proceedings of the 5th International IASDR|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of mind behavior driven change has been most heavily incorporated design for sustainability. Other approaches include crime prevention or health.  It is also seen in the design of safety objects and the social interaction of performative objects.

Performative objects are identified as design objects that are designed to facilitate mindful awareness of the physical and symbolic social actions and their consequences within which they are used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Designing the Performative Object: a study in designing mindful interaction through artefacts, in Redmond, J., D. Durling, and A. de Bono (eds.)|last = Niedderer|first = K.|publisher = FutureGround Proceedings of the Design Research Society International Conference 2004, Volume 2|year = 2004|isbn = 0-9756060-5-0|location = Melbourne, Australia: Monash University|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mindfulness and Silicon Valley ==
Classes in mindfulness practices have become part of some of Silicon Valleys major tech giants.  [[Google]] has implemented a series of bimonthly "mindfulness lunches" as well as built a labyrinth for walking meditations.  Both [[Twitter]] and [[Facebook]] have incorporated contemplative practices into their corporate culture.  The desired outcome of using mindfulness in the tech workforce is to increase communication and develop the [[emotional intelligence]] of their employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = In Silicon Valley, Meditation Is No Fad. It Could Make Your Career|url = https://www.wired.com/2013/06/meditation-mindfulness-silicon-valley/|website = WIRED|accessdate = 2015-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internet Addiction and Mindfulness==
Mindfulness is currently being explored by researchers as a possible treatment for technological addiction, also known as [[Internet addiction disorder]], a form of [[behavioral addiction]].  There has been some consensus in the field of psychology on the benefits of using mindfulness to treat behavioral addiction.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.gamblingtherapy.org/sites/default/files/resources/mindfulness-as-a-treatment-for-behavioural-addiction-2155-6105.1000e122.pdf|title = Mindfulness as a treatment for behavioural-addiction|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Experts in the field say in order to treat technology addiction with mindfulness, one must be non-judgmental about the behavior and pay attention in order to recognize instances in which technology is being used mindlessly.  Then reflect on the helpfulness of the device, and notice the benefits of disconnecting.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://bewell.stanford.edu/mindful-use-of-technology|title = Mindful Use of Technology|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;   The three keystones of mindfulness are: Intention, Attention and Action.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Technology is said to interfere with mindfulness by causing the individual to forget what matters (intention), the distracts (attention), and then keeps the individual from taking action.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In technological addiction, the reward system, located in the [[mid-brain]] and underlies addiction, evolved to rewards finding and consuming food.  In complex animals this evolution also rewards the exchange of information within the social group.  In humans this has developed into its current form of mass worldwide communication.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.cse.wustl.edu/~allenlavoie/papers/reddit.pdf|title = The Effects of Feedback on Human Behavior in Social Media: An Inverse Reinforcement Learning Model|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The exchange of social information has demonstrated reward based reinforcement, similar to that of [[gamification]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Criticisms ==

Critics of the mindfulness movement in technology focus on several key areas, technophobia, pacifications of genuine grievances in the workforce and disconnection from religious roots. The editor of the New Republic, Eygeny Morozov, questions the value of tech companies who advocate "unplugging" from the modern digital lifestyle as similar to a drug addict taking a tolerance break from the substance they are addicted to in order to then increase the vigor with which those activities are then resumed (3, 4).  They also state that the concept of  Mindfulness in the tech world is jargonistic and amorphous.

=== Mobile ===
Mobile meditation applications like Calm and Headspace have over a million users and are increasing in popularity. Swedish Researchers found that downloading and using the applications for eight weeks made little to no difference for people with major depression and anxiety. They did, however, see improvements with a subgroup with mild levels of depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Seeking Serenity on a Screen|url = http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/10/seeking-serenity-on-a-screen/?_r=0|website = Well|accessdate = 2015-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disconnectionists===
Criticisms of the slow technology movement are similar to the slow-food movement; it lacks understanding of global scope, and as an individualistic response will not answer the actual problems in technology. This movement has been dubbed by critics as disconnectionists.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Disconnectionists|url = http://thenewinquiry.com/essays/the-disconnectionists/|website = The New Inquiry|date = 2013-11-13|accessdate = 2015-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mindfulness in technology and has been criticized as being less about restoring self and more about stifling autonomy that technology inspires. Anti-disconnectionists state mindfulness and the expressed need to disconnect from technology and the modern world can be accused of being a nostalgia-manipulating marketing tactic and maybe a technological form of [[conservatism]].  Critics state that the labeling of digital connection as debasing and unnatural is in direct proportion to the rapidity of adoption.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = How adoption speed affects the abandonment of cultural tastes|url = http://www.pnas.org/content/106/20/8146|journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date = 2009-05-19|issn = 0027-8424|pmc = 2688844|pmid = 19416813|pages = 8146–8150|volume = 106|issue = 20|doi = 10.1073/pnas.0812647106|first = Jonah|last = Berger|first2 = Gaël Le|last2 = Mens}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus it is depicted as a dangerous desire and toxin to be regulated.  This argument itself can be tied back to [[rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]], [[Walter Benjamin]] on aura, [[Jacques Ellul]] on technique, [[Jean Baudrillard]] on simulations, or [[Zygmunt Bauman]] and the Frankfurt School on modernity and the Enlightenment.  Critics state that disconnectionists see the Internet as having normalized or enforced a repression of an authentic self in favor of a social media avatar.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Thus reflecting the desire to connect with a deeper self, which may itself be an illusion.  The pathologization of technology use then opens the door for [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]]'s idea of "normalization" to be applied to technology in similar fashion as other social ills, which then can become a concept around which social control and management can be applied.

===Buddhist concerns===
There is some concern among Buddhist practitioners that decoupling mediation and mindfulness from the core tenement of Buddhism may have negative effects.  The wide adoption of mindfulness in technology and the tech industry has been accused of increasing passivity in the worker by creating a calm mindstate which then allows for disconnect form actual grievances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Mindfulness is not Sati?|url = http://www.theravadin.org/2009/02/13/mindfulness-is-not-sati/|website = Theravadin|accessdate = 2015-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Critics of mindfulness in [[Cognitive Behavior Therapy]] also comment on this as a possible problem.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;   However, critics of the movement fear that the secularization of mindfulness, dubbed [[McMindfulness]],&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Beyond McMindfulness|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ron-purser/beyond-mcmindfulness_b_3519289.html|website = The Huffington Post|accessdate = 2015-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; leads to reinforcement of anti-Buddhist ideas.  Buddhists differentiate between [[Right Mindfulness]] ([[samma sati]]) and [[Wrong Mindfulness]] ([[miccha sati]]). The distinction is not moralistic: the issue is whether the quality of awareness is characterized by wholesome intentions and positive mental qualities that lead to human flourishing and optimal well-being for others as well as oneself.  Mindfulness as adopted by the Silicon Valley Tech giants has been criticized as conveniently shifting the burden of stress and toxic work environment onto the individual employee. Obfuscated by the seemingly inherent qualities of care and humanity, mindfulness is refashioned into a way to coping with and adapting to the stresses and strains of corporate life rather than actually solve them.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1080">'''Multicultural art''' concentrates on pieces of creativity that have an essence of a certain [[cultural]] theme. [[Kristen Ali Eglinton]], in her 2003 book ''Art in the Early Years'', defined multicultural art as "the study of artistic and [[aesthetic]] endeavors of the people and cultures that form the non-Western world".&lt;ref name="Eglinton52"&gt;{{Harvnb|Eglinton|2003|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multicultural art revolves around [[dance]], [[music]], [[graffiti]] and many other mediums of many cultures and races who express passion for the city life. Cultures inspire many people on a global level to send political, positive and unique messages to the public in an artistic and creative way.

Established in June 2013, it brings together [[photographers]] who share the same principles, views and interests to produce projects, exhibitions, publications and events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.streetphotographylondon.co.uk/street-photography-london-blog/international-collective-observe |title=The Street Photography of International Collective Observe |last=Goodden |first=Nicolas |website=Street Photography London |access-date=2018-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180106064001/http://www.streetphotographylondon.co.uk/street-photography-london-blog/international-collective-observe |archivedate=2018-01-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.wallacestate.edu/2017/02/01/the-evelyn-burrow-museum-presents-out-of-the-depths-in-new-exhibition/ |title=The Evelyn Burrow Museum presents "Out of the Depths" in new exhibition |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=n.d. |website=Wallace State News |access-date=2018-01-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although mainly focusing on [[street photography]], it is not limited to one specific genre and its members explore various genres and methods of photographic practice.

== Manifesto ==
Observe’s mission statement on its website reads as follows:

“OBSERVE is an international photography collective focused primarily on the practice of candid street photography. Spanning four continents we are united by a common fascination with watching and documenting the diverse humanity that surrounds us. While acknowledging that photography is at its core an individual pursuit, our membership finds benefit in mutual curation and support, discussion, and other collaborative interactions.”

In 2014, Observe was a Featured Collective at the Miami Street Photography Festival, and Chris Farling and Danielle Houghton were part of the jury for its competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.miamistreetphotographyfestival.org/2014-finalists |title=MSPF 2014 Finalists |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |website=Miami Street Photography Festival  |access-date=2018-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Observe Collective |date=2015-02-12 |title=Observe Collective - Miami Street Photography Festival slideshow |medium=video slideshow|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I3rG3ylL2I |access-date=2018-01-07 |publisher=Observe Collective }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 12 June to 26 July 2015, Observe held its first group exhibition at the Staedtische Galerie in [[Iserlohn]], [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.iserlohn.de/kultur/staedtische-galerie/ausstellungs-archiv/observe-collective/ |title=Observe Collective: Eine Fotografenvereinigung |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |website=Stadt Iserlohn |access-date=2018-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Street Photography: Was der Rinnstein hergibt |url=https://www.stern.de/fotografie/street-photography--bordsteinwelten-6421426.html#mg-1_1482963108330 |work=Stern |date=2015-09-09 |access-date=2018-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016-07-06 |title=Fotostudio Tölle unterstützt Observe Collective |trans-title=Photostudio Tölle Supports Observe Collective |url=http://toelle-fotostudio.de/blog/2015/07/fotostudio-toelle-unterstuetzt-observe-collective/ |work=Tölle |access-date=2018-01-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition was linked to an international contest, themed Under Construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Pütter |first=Thomas |date=2015-07-29 |title=Über 1500 Besucher sahen „Observe Collective“ |trans-title=Over 1500 Visitors for the Observe Collective |url=https://www.ikz-online.de/staedte/iserlohn/ueber-1500-besucher-sahen-observe-collective-id10932516.html |language=German |work=IKZ Online |location=Iserlohn |access-date=2018-01-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2015-06-15 |title=Observe Collective: Internationale Straßenfotografie in der Städtischen Galerie Iserlohn |trans-title=Observe Collective: International Street Photography in the Städtischen Galerie Iserlohn |url=http://www.zirbes.de/aktuelles/26-observe-collective.html |language=German |work=Zirbes |location=Iserlohn |access-date=2018-01-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=May|first=Michael|subject-link=Michael May (photographer) |interviewer=Thomas Brenck |title=“Observe Collective”: Eine Ausstellung mit Motiven von der Strasse in der Städtischen Galerie Iserlohn.

'''Osei Bonsu''' (October 22, 1900 - March 1, 1977) was a famed sculptor of [[Ashanti carving]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ross|first=Doran|date=February 1984|title=The Art of Osei Bonsu|url=https://exchange.umma.umich.edu/system/local_files/files/000/000/188/original/Ross__The_Art_of_Osei_Bonsu.pdf?1490367965|journal=African Arts|volume=Vol. 17, No. 2|pages=28–90|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==

Bonsu was taught carving as an apprentice under his father. He got his start via commissions from [[Akan people|Akan]] chiefs. He carved prolifically from his early twenties to his death in 1977. He was the chief carver of three [[Asantehene]] (absolute monarchs of the [[Kingdom of Ashanti]]): [[Prempeh I]], [[Osei Tutu Agyeman Prempeh II]], and [[Opoku Ware II]]. In this role he gained many commissions, including work for the [[Ghana National Museum]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1975 and 1976, Bonsu toured the United States as part of the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s Festival of American Folklore.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Works and style==

After Prempeh I's return from exile, Bonsu was commissioned to various regalia including linguist staffs, sword hilts, flywhisk sandals, and ornaments for sandals. Importantly, he was also asked to help in reconstructing the [[Golden Stool]], the famous symbol of power for Ashanti monarchs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

His work is on display in the [[British Museum]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=629257&amp;partId=1&amp;searchText=Meyerowitz&amp;page=1|title=umbrella / terminal|website=British Museum|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Ghana National Museum, and the [[Fowler Museum at UCLA]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Significant objects and locations ==
; Stave
: A kind of baton that most Guardians possess. It has various functions including communication over different worlds to other stave holders, a radio, manipulation of electronic devices and most importantly, the ability to shoot lasers which kill Welkin and Krellicks.

; Orb
: A smooth, white sphere. There is one orb for every world whether it be hidden or in possession of the resident Guardian. When not in its original world a person with full Guardian blood touches the orb whatever happened in the world before the removal of the orb will play like a movie on its surface. When the orb is in its original world the person will be transported to the Reading Room thus the orb being its 'keys'. The orbs also act as a defence to the Welkin and Krellicks hiding the blood of a Guardian.

; Reading Room
: The central repository of all knowledge of the Parallax. It keeps records of all the bad and good times of the stories and creatures in the Parallax. Although it is not a control room. The weather can't be changed and an election can't be fixed. Also the central hub of all world transportation.

; Golden Stave
: Only comes into being when a normal stave is taken to the Reading Room. Able to control the "Wheel of Knowledge". Can also manipulate certain times and events to an extent.

; Purple Water
: The key to Betti's blandishment. Betti pours it into the water supply of a world. It reacts with a person who does not fit into the 17.65% personality average of that world and turns them into water vapour. For example if in Hippie World there is a businessman and he drank the purple water he would be blandished.

; Francis Cam
: The form of communication through the Parallax. This is started by Techno World Una and Hippie World Francis. It is a link between four worlds, Techno, Forest, Ben's and Hippie World. The Francises in each world each have a camera with the exception of Techno World which is patrolled by Una. The Francis Cam is used to report Betti sightings, Spy Boy etc.

; Purple eyes
: Betti and Spy Boy's alternate eye colour. Their eyes turn purple when they're not telling the truth or if they're getting angry. Its true purpose is not yet known.

== Worlds ==

=== Main worlds ===
; Ben's World
: The red world, in which the series starts. Could be considered as the "normal" world. Links to Katherine's World through an old drain and Techno World through a chicken shed. When pushing different points on the parallax at the old drain you can also travel to Forest and Desert World. There is also a portal in Mr Dawes shed that links to Garden World when the right combination is used (1-1-11).

; Katherine's World
: The blue world, where Ben finds a sister he never knew existed, as well as his biological father. A very formal and organised world with many strict laws. Links to Ben's World via two large rocks and Hippie World by going in between two bookcases at a library. When pushing points on the parallax at the two rocks you can travel to Forest World. There is also a portal on the nearby beach. It leads to the tent owned by Betti in Desert World.

; Francis' Hippie World
: The yellow world. This is a very 'mellow' world filled with Hippies, literally. The only known portal here is through an old [[Volkswagen Type 2]] Kombi van located in front of the house of this world's Francis (A.K.A. The Werrinup Thief), which links to Katherine's World, and Forest World via the right combination.

; Una's Techno World
: The silver world, first thought to be a hi-tech rubbish tip. Everyone lives well and the world is very advanced in technology. The town's motto is "Tomorrow's technology, at yesterday's prices." The portal to get to Ben's World is located at the hi-tech rubbish tip. The other portal is located at an abandoned office building and becomes accessible when a password is typed onto a computer, links to Garden World.

; Mundi's Forest World
: The green world, Ben accidentally stumbles upon this world when he trips onto the Parallax symbol. A world that takes care of its environment, its Werrinup is built on towers above the forest floor to minimise human impact on the eco system. This world is infested by Krellicks and its people are protected through the height of their structures. The tree portal links to Ben's World, Katherine's World, or Techno World, though only when the right combination is hit on the symbol. The rock portal that links to Bush World is located outside of Mrs Dawes house on the forest floor. It is currently though guarded by the Krellicks and used as a nest.

=== Other worlds ===
; Desert World
: The orange world, a lifeless place of sand and stone. Ben's mother sends him to this world as a test him. One portal is located over a rock mound and goes to Ben's World via the right combination on the Parallax (7-1). The other portal is at the corner of a tent owned by Betti. It links to Katherine's World. It's later discovered that Desert World is also Otto's original homeworld, before it was destroyed by Betti.

; Garden World
: The pink world, Betti shows Katherine this world as an example of her goal in the Parallax. This world is in its own way perfect, the people who did not fit in have been effectively blandished. One portal is located through a do not enter door, and links to Techno World. The other is at a forked tree and leads to Ben's World.

; Bush World
: The brown world, this is the world in which Otto, the lost guardian has escaped to. Only one portal is known. It is in the middle of a river and links to Forest World. The other portal was meant to be down the river.

; Swamp World
: Only seen briefly when Ben accidentally stumbles into this place via the Reading Room. No portals through this world are known.

==Side Doors==
There are portals known as Side Doors which are like normal portals but are for singular trips and once you go through it you cannot go through it the way you came out. Ben and Katherine noticed other portal lights when Ben pressed a button on the stave in the Reading Room. They then asked Mrs Dawes if she knew about Side Doors but she sent them to her brother, Mr Dawes. He told them about Side Doors and the condition if you use one. There is only one known Side Door which is Mr Dawes' shed and it links to a seat in Garden World.

'''''Prince Caspian''''' (originally published as '''''Prince Caspian: The Return to Narnia''''') is a [[high fantasy]] novel for children by [[C. S. Lewis]], published by Geoffrey Bles in 1951. It was the second published of seven novels in ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'' (1950–1956), and Lewis had finished writing it in 1949, before the first book was out.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Lancelyn Green]] &amp; [[Walter Hooper]], ''C. S. Lewis: A Biography'', 2002, p. 309.&lt;/ref&gt; It is volume four in recent editions of the series, sequenced according to Narnia history. Like the others, it was illustrated by [[Pauline Baynes]] and her work has been retained in many later editions.&lt;ref name=isfdb/&gt;&lt;ref name=LCC/&gt;

''Prince Caspian'' features "return to Narnia" by the four Pevensie children of the first novel, about a year later in England but 1300 years later in Narnia.{{efn |name=timeline}} It is the only book of ''The Chronicles'' with men dominating Narnia. The talking animals and mythical beings are oppressed, and some may be endangered.  The English siblings are legendary {{c|Kings and Queens of Narnia}} and are magically recalled once again as children by the refugee [[Caspian X|Prince Caspian]].

&lt;!-- Dedication, if any--&gt;[[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan US]] published an American edition within the calendar year.&lt;ref name=isfdb/&gt;&lt;ref name=LCC/&gt;

''Prince Caspian'' has been [[film adaptation|adapted and filmed]] as two episodes of BBC television series in 1989 and as a feature film in 2008.

==Plot summary==
{{Long plot|reason=762 words|date=September 2015}} 
While standing on a British railway station, [[Peter Pevensie|Peter]], [[Susan Pevensie|Susan]], [[Edmund Pevensie|Edmund]], and [[Lucy Pevensie]] are magically whisked away to a beach near an old and ruined castle. They determine the ruin is [[Cair Paravel]], where they ruled as the Kings and Queens of [[Narnia]], and discover the treasure vault where Peter's sword and shield, Susan's bow and arrows, and Lucy's bottle of magical cordial and dagger are stored. Susan's horn for summoning help is missing, as she left it in the woods the day they returned to England after their prior visit to Narnia. Although only a year has passed in England, 1300 years have passed in Narnia.{{efn |name=timeline}}

The children intervene to rescue [[Trumpkin]] the [[dwarf (mythology)|dwarf]] from soldiers who have brought him to the ruins to drown him. Trumpkin tells the children that since their disappearance, a race of men called [[Telmar]]ines have invaded Narnia, driving the Talking Beasts into the wilderness and pushing even their memory underground. Narnia is ruled by [[Miraz|King Miraz]] and his wife Queen [[Prunaprismia]], but the rightful king is Miraz's nephew, [[Caspian X|Prince Caspian]], who has gained the support of the Old Narnians.

Miraz usurped the throne by killing his brother, Caspian's father [[King Caspian IX]]. Miraz tolerated Caspian as heir until his own son was born. Prince Caspian, until that point ignorant of his uncle's deeds, escaped from [[Miraz's Castle]] with the aid of his tutor [[Doctor Cornelius]], who schooled him in the lore of Old Narnia, and gave him Queen Susan's horn. Caspian fled into the forest but was knocked unconscious when his horse bolted. He awoke in the den of a [[Talking animals in fiction|Talking]] [[Badger]], [[Trufflehunter]], and two dwarfs, [[Nikabrik]] and Trumpkin, who accepted Caspian as their king.

The badger and dwarves took Caspian to meet many creatures of Old Narnia. During a midnight council on [[Dancing Lawn]], Doctor Cornelius arrived to warn them of the approach of King Miraz and his army; he urged them to flee to [[Aslan's How]] in the great woods near Cair Paravel. The Telmarines followed the Narnians to the How, and after several skirmishes the Narnians appeared close to defeat. At a second war council, they discussed whether to use Queen Susan's horn, and whether it would bring Aslan or the Kings and Queens of the golden age. Not knowing where help would arrive, they dispatched a squirrel to [[Lantern Waste]] and Trumpkin to Cair Paravel; it is then that Trumpkin was captured by the Telmarines and rescued by the Pevensies.

Trumpkin and the Pevensies make their way to Caspian. They try to save time by travelling up [[Glasswater Creek]], but lose their way. Lucy sees [[Aslan]] and wants to follow where he leads, but the others do not believe her and follow their original course, which becomes increasingly difficult. In the night, Aslan calls Lucy and tells her she must awaken the others and insist they follow her on Aslan's path. When the others obey, they begin to see Aslan's shadow, then Aslan himself. Aslan sends Peter, Edmund, and Trumpkin ahead to Aslan's How to deal with treachery brewing there, and follows with Susan and Lucy.

Peter, Edmund, and Trumpkin enter Aslan's How; they overhear Nikabrik and his confederates, a [[Hag]] and a [[&lt;!-- Lewis's spelling is "Wer-Wolf" --&gt;Werewolf|Wer-Wolf]], trying to persuade Caspian, Cornelius, and Trufflehunter to help them resurrect the [[White Witch]] in hopes of using her power to defeat Miraz. A fight ensues, and Nikabrik and his comrades are slain.

Peter challenges Miraz to single combat; the army of the victor in this duel will be considered the victor in the war. Miraz accepts the challenge, goaded by Lords [[Glozelle]] and [[Sopespian]]. Miraz loses the combat, but Glozelle and Sopespian declare that the Narnians have cheated and stabbed the King in the back while he was down. They command the Telmarine army to attack, and in the commotion that follows, Glozelle stabs Miraz in the back. Aslan, accompanied by Lucy and Susan, summons the gods Bacchus and Silenus, and with their help brings the woods to life. The gods and awakened trees turn the tide of battle and send the Telmarines fleeing. Discovering themselves trapped at the Great River, where their bridge has been destroyed by Bacchus, the Telmarines surrender.

Aslan gives the Telmarines a choice of staying in Narnia under Caspian or returning to Earth, their original home. After one volunteer disappears through the magic door created by Aslan, the Pevensies go through to reassure the other Telmarines, though Peter and Susan reveal to Edmund and Lucy that they are too old to return to Narnia. The Pevensies find themselves back at the railway station.

==Characters==
{{further|List of The Chronicles of Narnia characters}}
*[[Lucy Pevensie]], the youngest Pevensie child, is the first to see Aslan again.
*[[Edmund Pevensie]] is the third Pevensie child. Unlike his older siblings, he trusts Lucy's sighting of Aslan, pointing out that in their first adventure she turned out to be right and he ended up looking silly.
*[[Peter Pevensie]], the oldest of the Pevensie siblings, is High-King of Narnia.
*[[Susan Pevensie]] is the second oldest of the Pevensie children. She uses a bow and arrow
*[[Caspian X|Prince Caspian]], the rightful Telmarine King, who becomes King of Narnia. He reappears in the next two books in the series: ''[[The Voyage of the Dawn Treader]]'' and ''[[The Silver Chair]]'', and makes a brief appearance in the end of ''[[The Last Battle]]''.
*[[Aslan]], the Great Lion, who created Narnia.
*[[Miraz]], Caspian's uncle, usurped the throne of the Telmarines.  So long as Miraz has no son, he tolerates Caspian as heir, but when a son is born he moves to eliminate Caspian.  He fights the Old Narnians, who support Caspian, and accepts a challenge to single combat with Peter to settle the matter; but he is killed treacherously by Lord Glozelle after the duel.
*[[Trumpkin]], a Red Dwarf who helps Caspian defeat Miraz. When he is captured by Miraz's soldiers and taken to Cair Paravel to be drowned, he is freed by the Pevensie children and leads them to Caspian. At the beginning of the novel he is entirely sceptical about the existence of Aslan and the ancient Kings and Queens, but learns better in the course of the story.
*Doctor [[List of The Chronicles of Narnia characters#C|Cornelius]], half-dwarf and half-human, is tutor to Caspian and aids in the Narnians' defeat of the Telmarines.
*[[Reepicheep]], a Talking [[Mouse]] (descended from the non-talking mice who freed Aslan from his bonds in the previous book, and were thus given the gift of speech), is a fearless swordsman and a staunch supporter of Aslan and Caspian.
*[[Nikabrik]], a Black Dwarf in Caspian's army, resists fighting alongside Caspian.  Together with a Hag and a &lt;!-- Lewis's spelling: --&gt;Wer-Wolf, he plots to raise the [[White Witch]] against the Telmarines through black magic, but all three are killed by Caspian and his allies.
*[[Trufflehunter]], a Talking Badger, holds faith with Aslan and Old Narnia, and aids Prince Caspian in his struggle against Miraz.
*[[Bacchus]] and [[Silenus]], Narnian forest gods (borrowed from Ancient Greece).
* Lord [[Sopespian]] and Lord [[Glozelle]], lords of Telmar. After being insulted by Miraz they manipulate him into accepting Peter's challenge.  They cry treachery when Miraz falls, and Glozelle secretly stabs him in the back. Sopespian is beheaded by Peter as the all-out battle begins, but Lewis does not mention the fate of Glozelle.

==Themes==

The two major themes of the story are courage and chivalry and, as Lewis himself said in a letter to an American girl, "the restoration of the true religion after a corruption".&lt;ref&gt;Walter Hooper, ed. ''The Collected Letters of C. S. Lewis'', Volume III, p. 1245.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Telmarine conquest of Narnia, as depicted in the book, is in many ways similar to the historical [[Norman Conquest of England]]. Though there is no precise parallel in actual English history to the specific events of this book, the end result – "Old Narnians" and Telmarines becoming a single people and living together in harmony – is similar to the historical process of Saxons and Normans eventually fusing into a single English people.

==Adaptations==

The BBC adapted ''[[Prince Caspian/The Voyage of the Dawn Treader (1989 TV Serial)|Prince Caspian]]'' in two episodes of the 1989 series of ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia (TV serial)|The Chronicles of Narnia]]''.

The second in the [[The Chronicles of Narnia film series|series of films]] from [[Walt Disney Pictures]] and [[Walden Media]], titled ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian]]'', was released in the US on 16 May 2008. The UK release date was 26 June 2008.

The book was the inspiration for a song of the same name on the [[Phish]] album ''[[Billy Breathes]]''.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

The script for a stage adaptation was written by Erina Caradus and first performed in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://narniaproductions.co.nz Narnia Productions]. narniaproductions.co.nz ([[Dunedin]], New Zealand). Retrieved 10 December 2012. The homepage now promotes the last of four productions, ''The Voyage of the Dawn Treader'' (2008). Information about the four numbers varies.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Progressive rock''' (shortened as '''prog'''; sometimes called '''[[art rock]]''', '''classical rock''' or '''symphonic rock''')  is a broad [[genre]] of [[rock music]]{{sfn|Martin|1998|pp=71–75}} that developed in the United Kingdom and United States throughout the mid to late 1960s. Initially termed "[[progressive pop]]", the style was an outgrowth of [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]] bands who abandoned standard [[pop music|pop]] traditions in favour of [[Instrumentation (music)|instrumentation]] and [[Composition (music)|composition]]al techniques more frequently associated with [[jazz]], [[folk music|folk]], or [[classical music]]. Additional elements contributed to its "[[progressive music|progressive]]" label: lyrics were more poetic, technology was harnessed for new sounds, music approached the condition of "[[art music|art]]" and the studio, rather than the stage, [[Recording studio as an instrument|became the focus of musical activity]], which often involved creating music for listening, not dancing.

Prog is based on fusions of styles, approaches and genres, involving a continuous move between [[formalism (music)|formalism]] and [[eclecticism in music|eclecticism]]. Due to its historical reception, prog's scope is sometimes limited to a stereotype of long solos, overlong albums, fantasy lyrics, grandiose stage sets and costumes, and an obsessive dedication to technical skill. While the genre is often cited for its merging of [[high culture]] and [[low culture]], few artists incorporated literal classical themes in their work to any great degree, and only a handful of groups purposely emulated or referenced classical music.

The genre coincided with the mid 1960s economic boom that allowed record labels to allocate more creative control to their artists, as well as the new journalistic division between "pop" and "rock" that lent generic significance to both terms. Prog saw a high level of popularity in the early-to-mid 1970s, but faded soon after. Conventional wisdom holds that the rise of [[punk rock]] caused this, but several more factors contributed to the decline.{{sfn|Hegarty|Halliwell|2011|p=1}} Music critics, who often labelled the concepts as "pretentious" and the sounds as "pompous" and "overblown", tended to be hostile towards the genre or to completely ignore it.{{sfn|Lucky|2000|p=7}} After the late 1970s, progressive rock fragmented in numerous forms. Some bands achieved commercial success well into the 1980s (albeit with changed lineups and more compact song structures) or crossed into [[symphonic pop]], [[arena rock]], or [[new wave music|new wave]].

Early groups who exhibited progressive features are retroactively described as "[[proto-prog]]". The [[Canterbury scene]], originating in the late 1960s, denoted a subset of prog bands who emphasised the use of [[wind instrument]]s, complex chord changes and long improvisations. [[Rock in Opposition]], from the late 1970s, was more [[avant-garde]], and when combined with the [[Canterbury]] style, created [[avant-prog]]. In the 1980s, a new subgenre, [[neo-progressive rock]], enjoyed some commercial success, although it was also accused of being derivative and lacking in innovation. [[Post-progressive]] draws upon newer developments in popular music and the avant-garde since the mid 1970s.

==Definition and characteristics==
{{Details|Progressive music}}

===Scope and related terms===

{{See also|Progressive pop|Art rock}}
The term "progressive rock" is synonymous with "[[art rock]]", "classical rock" and "symphonic rock".{{sfn|Covach|1997|p=5}} Historically, "art rock" has been used to describe at least two related, but distinct, types of rock music.{{sfn|Bannister|2007|p=37}} The first is progressive rock as it is generally understood, while the second usage refers to groups who rejected [[psychedelia]] and the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|hippie counterculture]] in favour of a [[modernist]], [[avant-garde]] approach.{{sfn|Bannister|2007|p=37}}{{refn|group=nb|In the rock music of the 1970s, the "art" descriptor was generally understood to mean "aggressively avant-garde" or "pretentiously progressive".&lt;ref name="ArtPunkMurray"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Murray|first1=Noel|title=60 minutes of music that sum up art-punk pioneers Wire|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/60-minutes-music-sum-art-punk-pioneers-wire-219113|website=[[The A.V. Club]]|date=May 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Similarities between the two terms are that they both describe a mostly British attempt to elevate rock music to new levels of artistic credibility. However, art rock is more likely to have experimental or avant-garde influences.&lt;ref name="AMProg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/subgenre/prog-rock-ma0000002798|website=[[AllMusic]]|title=Prog-Rock}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Prog" was devised in the 1990s{{sfn|Robinson|2017|p=223}} as a shorthand term, but later became a transferable adjective, also suggesting a wider palette than that drawn on by the most popular 1970s bands.{{sfn|Hegarty|Halliwell|2011|p=9}}

Progressive rock is varied and is based on fusions of styles, approaches and genres, tapping into broader cultural resonances that connect to avant-garde art, [[classical music]] and [[folk music]], performance and the moving image.{{sfn|Hegarty|Halliwell|2011|p=13}} Although a unidirectional English "progressive" style emerged in the late 1960s, by 1967, progressive rock had come to constitute a diversity of loosely associated style codes.{{sfn|Cotner|2000|p=90}} When the "progressive" label arrived, the music was dubbed "[[progressive pop]]" before it was called "progressive rock",{{sfn|Moore|2004|p=22}}{{refn|group=nb|From about 1967, "pop music" was increasingly used in opposition to the term "rock music", a division that gave generic significance to both terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gloag|first1=Kenneth|editor1-last=Latham|editor1-first=Alison|title=The Oxford Companion to Music|date=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-866212-2|edition=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} with the term "progressive" referring to the wide range of attempts to break with standard pop music formula.{{sfn|Haworth|Smith|1975|p=126}} A number of additional factors contributed to the acquired "progressive" label: lyrics were more poetic; technology was harnessed for new sounds; music approached the condition of "art"; some harmonic language was imported from jazz and [[Romantic music|19th-century classical music]]; [[Album Era|the album format overtook singles]]; and the studio, rather than the stage, became the focus of musical activity, which often involved creating music for listening, not dancing.{{sfn|Moore|2016|pp=201–202}}

Critics of the genre often limit its scope to a stereotype of long solos, overlong albums, fantasy lyrics, grandiose stage sets and costumes, and an obsessive dedication to technical skill.{{sfn|Hegarty|Halliwell|2011|p=2}}  While progressive rock is often cited for its merging of high culture and low culture, few artists incorporated literal classical themes in their work to any great degree,{{sfn|Holm-Hudson|2013|pp=16, 85–87}} and only a handful of groups purposely emulated or referenced classical music.{{sfn|Hegarty|Halliwell|2011|p=13}}  Writer Emily Robinson says that the narrowed definition of "progressive rock" was a measure against the term's loose application in the late 1960s, when it was "applied to everyone from [[Bob Dylan]] to [[the Rolling Stones]]". Debate over the genre's criterion continued to the 2010s, particularly on Internet forums dedicated to prog.{{sfn|Robinson|2017|p=223}}

According to musicologists [[Paul Hegarty]] and Martin Halliwell, [[Bill Martin (philosophy)|Bill Martin]] and Edward Macan authored major books about prog rock while "effectively accept[ing] the characterization of progressive rock offered by its critics.  ... they each do so largely unconsciously."{{sfn|Hegarty|Halliwell|2011|p=2}} Academic John S. Cotner contests Macan's view that progressive rock cannot exist without the continuous and overt assimilation of classical music into rock.{{sfn|Cotner|2000|p=90}} Author Kevin Holm-Hudson agrees that "progressive rock is a style far more diverse than what is heard from its mainstream groups and what is implied by unsympathetic critics."{{sfn|Holm-Hudson|2013|p=16}}

In early references to the music, "progressive" was partly related to [[progressive politics]], but those connotations were lost during the 1970s.{{sfn|Robinson|2017|p=223}} On "progressive music", Holm-Hudson writes that it "moves continuously between explicit and implicit references to genres and strategies derived not only from European art music, but other cultural domains (such as East Indian, Celtic, folk, and African) and hence involves a continuous aesthetic movement between [[formalism (art)|formalism]] and [[Eclecticism in music|eclecticism]]."{{sfn|Holm-Hudson|2013|pp=85–87}}{{refn|group=nb|Formalism refers to a preoccupation with established external compositional systems, structural unity, and the autonomy of individual art works. Eclecticism, like formalism, connotates a predilection towards style synthesis, or integration. However, contrary to formalist tendencies, eclecticism foregrounds discontinuities between historical and contemporary styles and electronic media, sometimes referring simultaneously to vastly different musical genres, idioms and cultural codes. Examples include [[the Beatles]]' "[[Within You Without You]]" (1967) and [[Jimi Hendrix]]'s 1969 version of "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]".{{sfn|Cotner|2000|p=93}}}} Cotner also says that progressive rock incorporates both formal and eclectic elements, "It consists of a combination of factors – some of them intramusical ("within"), others extramusical or social ("without")."{{sfn|Cotner|2000|p=90}}

One way of conceptualising [[rock and roll]] in relation to "progressive music" is that progressive music pushed the genre into greater complexity while retracing the roots of romantic and classical music.{{sfn|Willis|2014|pp=204, 219}} Sociologist [[Paul Willis]] believes: "We must never be in doubt that 'progressive' music followed rock 'n' roll, and that it could not have been any other way. We can see rock 'n' roll as a deconstruction and 'progressive' music as a reconstruction."{{sfn|Willis|2014|p=219}} Author Will Romano states that "rock itself can be interpreted as a progressive idea&amp;nbsp;... Ironically, and quite paradoxically, 'progressive rock', the classic era of the late 1960s through the mid- and late 1970s, introduces not only the explosive and exploratory sounds of technology&amp;nbsp;... but traditional music forms (classical and European folk) and (often) a pastiche compositional style and artificial constructs ([[concept album]]s) which suggests [[postmodernism]]."{{sfn|Romano|2010|p=24}}

[[File:Beatles and George Martin in studio 1966.JPG|thumb|right|[[The Beatles]] working in the studio with their producer [[George Martin]], circa 1965]]

In 1966, the level of social and artistic correspondence among British and American rock musicians dramatically accelerated for bands like [[the Beatles]], [[the Beach Boys]] and [[the Byrds]] who fused elements of [[cultivated music]] with the [[vernacular music|vernacular traditions]]{{dn|date=December 2018}} of rock.{{sfn|Holm-Hudson|2013|p=85}} Progressive rock was predicated on the "progressive" pop groups from the 1960s who combined rock and roll with various other music styles such as Indian [[raga]]s, [[Music of Asia|oriental]] melodies and [[Gregorian chant]]s, like the Beatles and [[the Yardbirds]].{{sfn|Prown|Newquist|1997|p=78}} The Beatles' [[Paul McCartney]] said in 1967: "we [the band] got a bit bored with 12 bars all the time, so we tried to get into something else. Then came Dylan, [[the Who]], and the Beach Boys. ... We're all trying to do vaguely the same kind of thing."{{sfn|Philo|2014|p=119}} Rock music started to take itself seriously, paralleling earlier attempts in jazz (as [[Swing music|swing]] gave way to [[Bebop|bop]], a move which did not succeed with audiences). In this period, the [[popular song]] began signalling a new possible means of expression that went beyond the three-minute [[love song]], leading to an intersection between the "underground" and the "establishment" for listening publics.{{sfn|Moore|2016|p=201}}{{refn|group=nb|Allan Moore writes: "It should be clear by now that, although this history appears to offer a roughly chronological succession of styles, there is no single, linear history to that thing we call ''popular song''.&amp;nbsp;... Sometimes it appears that there are only peripheries. Sometimes, audiences gravitate towards a centre. The most prominent period when this happened was in the early to mid 1960s when it seems that almost everyone, irrespective of age, class or cultural background, listened to the Beatles. But by 1970 this monolothic position had again broken down. Both [[the Edgar Broughton Band]]'s '[[Apache Dropout|Apache dropout]]' and [[Edison Lighthouse]]'s '[[Love Grows (Where My Rosemary Goes)|Love grows]]' were released in 1970 with strong Midlands/London connections, and both were audible on the same radio stations, but were operating according to very different aesthetics."{{sfn|Moore|2016|pp=199–200}}}}

Hegarty and Halliwell identify the Beatles, the Beach Boys, the Doors, [[the Pretty Things]], [[the Zombies]], the Byrds, [[the Grateful Dead]] and [[Pink Floyd]] "not merely as precursors of prog but as essential developments of progressiveness in its early days".{{sfn|Hegarty|Halliwell|2011|p=11}} According to musicologist [[Walter Everett (musicologist)|Walter Everett]], the Beatles' "experimental timbres, rhythms, tonal structures, and poetic texts" on their albums ''[[Rubber Soul]]'' (1965) and ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]'' (1966) "encouraged a legion of young bands that were to create progressive rock in the early 1970s".{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=95}} Dylan's poetry, [[the Mothers of Invention]]'s album ''[[Freak Out!]]'' (1966) and the Beatles' ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' (1967) were all important in progressive rock's development.&lt;ref name="AMProg" /&gt; The productions of [[Phil Spector]] were key influences,{{sfn|Martin|1998|p=47}} as they introduced the possibility of using the recording studio to create music that otherwise could never be achieved.{{sfn|Tamm|1995|p=29}} The same{{vague|date=September 2016}} is said for the Beach Boys' ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' (1966), which [[Brian Wilson]] intended as an answer to ''Rubber Soul''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stereogum.com/1892600/tomorrow-never-knows-how-1966s-trilogy-of-pet-sounds-blonde-on-blonde-and-revolver-changed-everything/franchises/sounding-board/ |first=Ryan|last=Leas|title=Tomorrow Never Knows: How 1966’s Trilogy Of ''Pet Sounds'', ''Blonde On Blonde'', And ''Revolver'' Changed Everything|publisher=[[Stereogum]]|date=5 August 2016|accessdate=15 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and which in turn influenced the Beatles when they made ''Sgt. Pepper's''.{{sfn|Martin|1998|p=53}}{{sfn|Cotner|2001|p=30}}

Dylan introduced a literary element to rock through his fascination with the [[Surrealism|Surrealists]] and the [[French Symbolism|French Symbolists]], and his immersion in the New York City art scene of the early 1960s.{{sfn|Curtis|1987|p=156-7}} The trend of bands with names drawn from literature, such as [[the Doors]], [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]] and [[The Ides of March (band)|the Ides of March]], were a further sign of rock music aligning itself with high culture.{{sfn|Curtis|1987|p=179}} Dylan also led the way in blending rock with folk music styles. This was followed by folk rock groups such as the Byrds, who based their initial sound on that of the Beatles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jackson|first=Andrew Grant|title=1965: The Most Revolutionary Year in Music|year=2015|publisher=Thomas Dunne Books|isbn=978-1-250-05962-8|pages=64–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, the Byrds' vocal harmonies inspired those of [[Yes_(band)|Yes]],{{sfn|Martin|1996|p=4}} and [[British folk rock]] bands like [[Fairport Convention]], who emphasised instrumental virtuosity.{{sfn|Hegarty|Halliwell|2011|pp=54–55}} Some of these artists, such as [[the Incredible String Band]] and [[Shirley Collins|Shirley]] and [[Dolly Collins]], would prove influential through their use of instruments borrowed from world music and [[early music]].{{sfn|Sweers|2004|p=72,204}}

''Pet Sounds'' and ''Sgt. Pepper's'', with their lyrical unity, extended structure, complexity, eclecticism, experimentalism, and influences derived from classical music forms, are largely viewed as beginnings in the progressive rock genre{{sfn|Macan|1997|p=15,20}}{{sfn|Martin|1998|pp=39–40}} and as turning points wherein rock, which previously had been considered dance music, became music that was made for listening to.{{sfn|Covach|1997|p=3}}{{sfn|Martin|1998|p=39}} Between ''Pet Sounds'' and ''Sgt. Pepper's'', the Beach Boys released the single "[[Good Vibrations]]" (1966), dubbed a "[[pocket symphony]]" by [[Derek Taylor]], who worked as a publicist for both groups. The song contained an eclectic array of exotic instruments and several disjunctive key and modal shifts.{{sfn|Boone|1997|pp=41–46}} Scott Interrante of ''[[Popmatters]]'' wrote that its influence on progressive rock and the psychedelic movement "can't be overstated".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Interrante|first1=Scott|title=The 12 Best Brian Wilson Songs|url=http://www.popmatters.com/post/193278-the-12-best-brian-wilson-songs/|publisher=''[[Popmatters]]''|date=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin likened the song to the Beatles' "[[A Day in the Life]]" from ''Sgt. Pepper's'', in that they showcase "the same reasons why much progressive rock is difficult to dance to".{{sfn|Martin|1998|p=40}}

Although ''Sgt. Pepper's'' was preceded by several albums that had begun to bridge the line between "disposable" pop and "serious" rock, it successfully gave an established "commercial" voice to an alternative youth culture{{sfn|Holm-Hudson|2008|p=10}} and marked the point at which the [[LP record]] emerged as a creative format whose importance was equal to or greater than that of the single.{{sfn|Pirenne|2005|}}{{refn|group=nb|LP sales first overtook those of singles in 1969.{{sfn|Sweers|2004|p=120}}}} [[Bill Bruford]], a veteran of several progressive rock bands, said that ''Sgt. Pepper's'' transformed both musicians' ideas of what was possible and audiences' ideas of what was acceptable in music.{{sfn|Weigel|2012b|}} He believed that: "Without the Beatles, or someone else who had done what the Beatles did, it is fair to assume that there would have been no progressive rock."{{sfn|Bruford|2012|p=159}} In the aftermath of ''Sgt. Pepper'', magazines such as ''Melody Maker'' drew a sharp line between "pop" and "rock', thus eliminating the "roll" from "[[rock and roll]]" (which now refers to the 1950s style). The only artists who remained "rock" would be those who were considered at the vanguard of compositional forms, far from "radio friendly" standards, as Americans increasingly used the adjective "progressive" for groups like [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]], [[Family (band)|Family]], [[East of Eden (band)|East of Eden]], [[Van Der Graaf Generator]], and [[King Crimson]].{{sfn|Zoppo|2014|p={{page needed|date=December 2016}}}}

According to [[AllMusic]]: "Prog-rock began to emerge out of the British psychedelic scene in 1967, specifically a strain of classical/symphonic rock led by [[the Nice]], [[Procol Harum]], and [[the Moody Blues]] (''[[Days of Future Passed]]'')."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Anon|title=Prog-Rock|url=http://www.allmusic.com/subgenre/prog-rock-ma0000002798|website=[[AllMusic]]|date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The availability of newly affordable recording equipment coincided with the rise of a London [[underground (British subculture)|underground]] scene at which LSD was commonly used. Pink Floyd and [[Soft Machine]] functioned as [[house band]]s at all-night events at locations such as [[Middle Earth (club)|Middle Earth]] and the [[UFO Club]], where they experimented with sound textures and long-form songs.{{sfn|Sweers|2004|p=114–15}}{{refn|group=nb|Beatles member [[John Lennon]] is known to have attended at least one such event, a [[happening]] called [[the 14 Hour Technicolor Dream]].{{sfn|O'Brien|1999|}} [[Paul McCartney]] was deeply connected to the underground through his involvement with the [[Indica Gallery]].{{sfn|Miles|1999|}}}} Many psychedelic, folk rock and early progressive bands were aided by exposure from [[BBC Radio 1]] DJ [[John Peel]].{{sfn|Sweers|2004|p=119}} [[Jimi Hendrix]], who rose to prominence in the London scene and recorded with a band of English musicians, initiated the trend towards virtuosity in rock music.{{sfn|Martin|1998|pp=164–65}}  The Scottish band 1-2-3, later renamed [[Clouds (60s rock band)|Clouds]], were formed in 1966 and began performing at London clubs a year later. According to ''Mojo''{{'s}} George Knemeyer: "some claim [that they] had a vital influence on prog-rockers such as Yes, The Nice and Family."{{sfn|Hogg|1994|}}

Symphonic rock artists in the late 1960s had some chart success, including the singles "[[Nights in White Satin]]" (the Moody Blues, 1967) and "[[A Whiter Shade of Pale]]" (Procol Harum, 1967).&lt;ref name="FowlesWade2012"/&gt; The Moody Blues established the popularity of symphonic rock when they recorded ''Days of Future Passed'' together with the [[London Festival Orchestra]], and Procol Harum began to use a greater variety of acoustic instruments,{{importance example|date=June 2016}} particularly on their 1969 album ''[[A Salty Dog]]''.{{sfn|Macan|1997|pp=21–22}} Classical influences sometimes took the form of pieces adapted from or inspired by classical works, such as [[Jeff Beck]]'s "[[Beck's Bolero]]" and parts of the Nice's ''[[Ars Longa Vita Brevis (album)|Ars Longa Vita Brevis]]''. The latter, along with such Nice tracks as "Rondo" and "[[America (West Side Story song)|America]]", reflect a greater interest in music that is entirely instrumental. ''Sgt. Pepper's'' and ''Days'' both represent a growing tendency towards [[song cycle]]s and suites made up of multiple [[Movement (music)|movements]].{{sfn|Macan|1997|pp=21–22}}

Several bands that included jazz-style [[horn section]]s appeared, including [[Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears]] and [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]]. Of these, Martin highlights Chicago in particular for their experimentation with suites and extended compositions, such as the "[[Ballet for a Girl in Buchannon]]" on ''[[Chicago (album)|Chicago II]]''.{{sfn|Martin|1998|pp=163–164}} Jazz influences appeared in the music of British bands such as [[Traffic (band)|Traffic]], [[Colosseum (band)|Colosseum]] and [[If (band)|If]], together with [[Canterbury scene]] bands such as [[Soft Machine]] and [[Caravan (band)|Caravan]]. Canterbury scene bands emphasised the use of wind instruments, complex chord changes and long improvisations.{{sfn|Macan|1997|p=20}} Martin writes that in 1968, "full-blown progressive rock" was not yet in existence, but three bands released albums who would later come to the forefront of the music: [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]], Caravan and Soft Machine.{{sfn|Martin|1998|p=168}}

The term "progressive rock", which appeared in the liner notes of Caravan's 1968 self-titled [[Caravan (Caravan album)|debut LP]], came to be applied to bands that used classical music techniques to expand the styles and concepts available to rock music.{{sfn|Macan|1997|p=26}}{{sfn|Bowman|2001|p=184}} The Nice, the Moody Blues, Procol Harum and Pink Floyd all contained elements of what is now called progressive rock, but none represented as complete an example of the genre as several bands that formed soon after.{{sfn|Macan|1997|pp=22–23}} Almost all of the genre's major bands, including Jethro Tull, [[King Crimson]], [[Yes (band)|Yes]], [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], [[Van der Graaf Generator]], [[Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer|ELP]], [[Gentle Giant]] and [[Curved Air]], released their debut albums during the years 1968–1970. Most of these were folk-rock albums that gave little indication of what the band's mature sound would become, but King Crimson's ''[[In the Court of the Crimson King]]'' (1969) was a fully formed example of the genre.{{sfn|Macan|1997|p=23}}{{refn|group=nb|They are also generally credited as the first global standard-bearers of symphonic rock.&lt;ref name="FowlesWade2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fowles|first1=Paul|last2=Wade|first2=Graham|title=Concise History of Rock Music|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nW2-7BrEUOEC&amp;pg=PA125|year=2012|publisher=Mel Bay Publications|isbn=978-1-61911-016-8|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Critics assumed the album to be the logical extension and development of late 1960s proto-progressive rock exemplified by the Moody Blues, Procol Harum, Pink Floyd and the Beatles.{{sfn|Macan|2005|p=75}} According to Macan, the album may be the most influential to progressive rock for crystallising the music of earlier "proto-progressive bands&amp;nbsp;... into a distinctive, immediately recognizable style".{{sfn|Macan|1997|p=23}}

Progressive rock came to be appreciated overseas, but it mostly remained a European, and especially British, phenomenon. Few American bands engaged in it, and the purest representatives of the genre, such as [[Starcastle]] and [[Happy the Man]], remained limited to their own geographic regions.{{sfn|Macan|1997|p=185-6}} This is at least in part due to music industry differences between the US and Great Britain.&lt;ref name="pirenne1"/&gt;{{refn|group=nb|Radio airplay was less important in the UK, where popular music recordings had limited air-time on official radio stations (as opposed to on [[Pirate radio in the United Kingdom|pirate radio]]) until the 1967 launch of [[BBC Radio 1]].&lt;ref name="pirenne1"&gt;Pirenne, Christophe.

Four of progressive rock's most successful bands - King Crimson, Yes, ELP and Genesis - went on hiatus or (in Genesis' case) experienced major personnel changes during the mid-1970s.{{sfn|Hegarty|Halliwell|2011|p=177}} Macan notes the September 1974 breakup of King Crimson as particularly significant, calling it the point when "all English bands in the genre should have ceased to exist."{{sfn|Macan|1997|p=179}} More of the major bands, including Van der Graaf Generator, Gentle Giant and [[UK (band)|U.K.]], dissolved between 1978 and 1980.{{sfn|Macan|1997|p=187-8}} Many bands had by the mid-1970s reached the limit of how far they could experiment in a rock context, and fans had wearied of the extended, epic compositions. The sounds of the [[Hammond organ|Hammond]], [[Minimoog]] and [[Mellotron]] had been thoroughly explored, and their use became clichéd. Those bands who continued to record often simplified their sound, and the genre fragmented from the late 1970s onwards.{{sfn|Macan|1997|pp=181–183}} In [[Robert Fripp]]'s opinion, once "progressive rock" ceased to cover new ground – becoming a set of conventions to be repeated and imitated – the genre's premise had ceased to be "progressive".{{sfn|Macan|1997|p=206}}

The era of record labels investing in their artists, giving them freedom to experiment and limited control over their content and marketing, ended with the late 1970s.{{sfn|Moore|2016|p=202}} Corporate [[artists and repertoire]] staff exerted an increasing amount of control over the creative process that had previously belonged to the artists,{{sfn|Martin|1996|p=188}} and established acts were pressured to create music with simpler harmony and song structures and fewer changes in meter. A number of symphonic pop bands, such as [[Supertramp]], [[10cc]], [[the Alan Parsons Project]] and the [[Electric Light Orchestra]], brought the orchestral-style arrangements into a context that emphasised pop singles while allowing for occasional instances of exploration. Jethro Tull, Gentle Giant and Pink Floyd opted for a harder sound in the style of arena rock.{{sfn|Macan|1997|p=187}}

Few new progressive rock bands formed during this era, and those who did found that record labels were not interested in signing them.&lt;ref name="derogatis98"&gt;DeRogatis, Jim.

=====Commercialisation=====

These bands retained some elements of the orchestral-style arrangements, but they moved away from lyrical mysticism in favour of teen-oriented songs about relationships.{{sfn|Hegarty|Halliwell|2011|pp=181–182}} Genesis transformed into a successful pop act, and a re-formed Yes released the relatively mainstream ''[[90125 (album)|90125]]'' (1983), which yielded their only US number-one single, "[[Owner of a Lonely Heart]]". These radio-friendly groups have been called "prog lite".{{sfn|Cateforis|2011|pp=154–159}} One band who experienced great 1980s success while maintaining a progressive approach was Pink Floyd, who released ''[[The Wall]]'' late in 1979.

The term "[[post-progressive]]" identifies progressive rock that returns to its original principles while dissociating from established 1970s prog styles,{{sfn|Hegarty|Halliwell|2011|p=225}} and may be located after 1978.{{sfn|Martin|1998|p=20}} Martin credits [[Roxy Music]]'s [[Brian Eno]] as the music's most important catalyst, explaining that his 1973–77 output merged aspects of progressive rock with a prescient notion of punk and [[new wave]].{{sfn|Martin|1998|p=251}} [[New wave]], which surfaced around 1978–79 with some of the same attitudes and aesthetic as punk, was characterised by Martin as "progressive" multiplied by "punk".{{sfn|Martin|2002|p=99}} Bands in the genre tended to be less hostile towards progressive rock than the punks, and there were crossovers, such as Fripp and Eno's involvement with [[Talking Heads]], and Yes' replacement of Rick Wakeman and Jon Anderson with the pop duo [[the Buggles]].{{sfn|Martin|2002|p=99}} When King Crimson reformed in 1981, they released an album, ''[[Discipline (King Crimson album)|Discipline]]'', which Macan says "inaugurated" the new post-progressive style.{{sfn|Macan|1997|p=205}} According to Martin, Talking Heads also created "a kind of new-wave music that was the perfect synthesis of punk urgency and attitude and progressive-rock sophistication and creativity. A good deal of the more interesting rock since that time is clearly 'post-Talking Heads' music, but this means that it is post-progressive rock as well."{{sfn|Martin|1998|p=251}}

====Neo-progressive rock====
{{main article|Neo-progressive rock}}

A second wave{{sfn|Hegarty|Halliwell|2011|p=199}} of progressive rock bands appeared in the early 1980s and have since been categorised as a separate "[[neo-progressive rock]]" subgenre.&lt;ref name="ewing"&gt;Ewing, Jerry. "Pathways." Classic Rock Presents Prog. 17 March 2010. p.61&lt;/ref&gt; These largely keyboard-based bands played extended compositions with complex musical and lyrical structures.{{sfn|Hegarty|Halliwell|2011|pp=183–186}} Several of these bands were signed by major record labels, including [[Marillion]], [[IQ (band)|IQ]], [[Pendragon (band)|Pendragon]] and [[Pallas (band)|Pallas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/jul/22/prog-rock-genesis-rush-mostly-autumn | title= Go back to go forward: the resurgence of prog rock | work=The Guardian | location=London | first=Alexis | last=Petridis | date=22 July 2010 | accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the genre's major acts released debut albums between 1983 and 1985 and shared the same manager, Keith Goodwin, a publicist who had been instrumental in promoting progressive rock during the 1970s.{{sfn|Macan|1997|p=198}} The previous decade's bands had the advantage of appearing during a large [[Counterculture|countercultural]] movement that provided them with a large potential audience, but the neo-progressive bands were limited to a niche audience and found it difficult to attract a following. Only Marillion{{sfn|Macan|1997|pp=200–01}} and [[Saga (band)|Saga]]{{sfn|Clark|2012|}} experienced international success.

Neo-progressive bands tended to use Gabriel-era Genesis as their "principal model".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1=John Covach |editor2=Graeme M. Boone |title=Understanding Rock: Essays in Musical Analysis |year=1997|page=6|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0195100051}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were also influenced by [[funk]], [[hard rock]] and [[punk rock]].&lt;ref name="romano"&gt;{{cite book|last=Romano|first=Will|title=Mountains Come Out of the Sky: The Illustrated History of Prog Rock|date=2010|publisher=Backbeat Books|isbn=978-0879309916|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2lVMAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT390&amp;lpg=PT390&amp;dq=mick+pointer+tolkien&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Fy_lGS35o1&amp;sig=E_8XnMwCllJJf63yGzuIZfNr_gs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiW0P2D-ajLAhXRa5oKHUJVDZs4ChDoAQgpMAI#v=onepage&amp;q=mick%20pointer%20tolkien&amp;f=false|accessdate=5 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The genre's most successful band, Marillion, suffered particularly from accusations of similarity to Genesis, although they used a different vocal style and a sound with more of a hard rock element.{{sfn|Hegarty|Halliwell|2011|pp=187-188}} Authors [[Paul Hegarty (musician)|Paul Hegarty]] and Martin Halliwell have pointed out that the neo-progressive bands were not so much plagiarising progressive rock as they were creating a new style from progressive rock elements, just as the bands of a decade before had created a new style from jazz and classical elements.{{sfn|Hegarty|Halliwell|2011|p=184}} Author Edward Macan counters by pointing out that these bands were at least partially motivated by a nostalgic desire to preserve a past style rather than a drive to innovate.{{sfn|Macan|1997|p=197}}

===1990s–2000s===

====Third wave====
[[File:Porcupine Tree LIVE in ARENA 2007-11-28.jpg|thumb|right|[[Porcupine Tree]] performs in 2007]]

A third wave of progressive rock bands, who might more properly be described as a second generation of neo-progressive bands,{{sfn|Hegarty|Halliwell|2011|p=199}}  emerged in the 1990s. The use of the term "progressive" to describe groups that follow in the style of bands from ten to twenty years earlier is somewhat controversial, as it has been seen as a contradiction of the spirit of experimentation and progress.{{sfn|Gill|1995|}}{{sfn|Hegarty|Halliwell|2011|p=19}} These new bands were aided in part by the availability of personal computer-based [[Digital audio workstation|recording studios]], which reduced album production expenses, and the Internet, which made it easier for bands outside of the mainstream to reach widely spread audiences.{{sfn|Karnick|2003|}} Record stores specialising in progressive rock appeared in large cities.{{sfn|Gill|1995|}}

The [[Shred guitar|shred]] music of the 1980s was a major influence on the progressive rock groups of the 1990s.{{sfn|Gill|1995|}} Some of the newer bands, such as [[the Flower Kings]], [[Spock's Beard]] and [[Glass Hammer]], played a 1970s-style symphonic prog but with an updated sound.{{sfn|Lucky|2000|p=47,127}} A number of them began to explore the limits of the CD in the way that earlier groups had stretched the limits of the vinyl LP.{{sfn|Hegarty|Halliwell|2011|p=200}}

In the 1990s, the American [[jam band]] scene was partly influenced by 1970s progressive rock. For instance, the popular group [[Phish]] were influenced by artists such as Genesis, Gong and Gentle Giant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=WASHBURN |first1=JIM |title=O.C.

Progressive rock and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] have similar timelines. Both emerged from late-1960s psychedelia to achieve great early-1970s success despite a lack of radio airplay and support from critics, then faded in the late 1970s and experienced revivals in the early 1980s. Each genre experienced a fragmentation of styles at this time, and many metal bands from the [[new wave of British heavy metal]] onwards displayed progressive rock influences.{{sfn|Hegarty|Halliwell|2011|pp=259-260}} [[Progressive metal]] reached a point of maturity with Queensrÿche's 1988 concept album ''[[Operation: Mindcrime]]'' and [[Voivod (band)|Voivod]]'s 1989 ''[[Nothingface (Voivod album)|Nothingface]]'', which featured abstract lyrics and a King Crimson-like texture.{{sfn|Hegarty|Halliwell|2011|pp=260-262}}

Progressive rock elements appear in other metal subgenres. [[Black metal]] is conceptual by definition, due to its prominent theme of questioning the values of Christianity.{{sfn|Hegarty|Halliwell|2011|p=264}} Its [[Death growl|guttural]] vocals are sometimes used by bands who can be classified as progressive, such as [[Mastodon (band)|Mastodon]], [[Mudvayne]] and [[Opeth]].{{sfn|Hegarty|Halliwell|2011|pp=264, 266}} [[Symphonic metal]] is an extension of the tendency towards orchestral passages in early progressive rock.{{sfn|Hegarty|Halliwell|2011|pp=266–267}} Progressive rock has also served as a key inspiration for genres such as [[post-rock]],&lt;ref name="allen"&gt;Allen, Jim.

====New prog====
{{Distinguish|Neo-progressive rock}}

'''New prog''' describes the wave of progressive rock bands in the 2000s who revived the genre. According to ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s Evan Serpick: "Along with recent success stories like [[System of a Down]] and up-and-comers like the [[Dillinger Escape Plan]], [[Lightning Bolt (band)|Lightning Bolt]], and [[Coheed and Cambria]], [[the Mars Volta]] create incredibly complex and inventive music that sounds like a heavier, more aggressive version of ’70s behemoths such as Led Zeppelin and King Crimson."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Serpick|first=Evan|date=9 May 2005|title=Prog Rocks Again|publisher=Entertainment Weekly|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1058164,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010s===
The Progressive Music Awards were launched in 2012 by the British magazine ''[[Prog (magazine)|Prog]]'' to honour the genre's established acts and to promote its newer bands. Honorees, however, are not invited to perform at the awards ceremony, as the promoters want an event "that doesn't last three weeks".{{sfn|Sherwin|2012|}}{{full citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==Festivals==
Many prominent progressive rock bands got their initial exposure at large [[rock festival]]s that were held in Britain during the late 1960s and early 1970s. King Crimson made their first major appearance at the [[Stones in the Park|1969 Hyde Park free concert]], before a crowd estimated to be as large as 650,000, in support of [[the Rolling Stones]].{{sfn|Fripp|1975|}} Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer debuted at the [[Isle of Wight Festival 1970|1970 Isle of Wight Festival]], at which Supertramp, [[Family (band)|Family]] and Jethro Tull also appeared.{{sfn|Hegarty|Halliwell|2011|pp=50–51}} Jethro Tull were also present at the 1969 [[Newport Jazz Festival]], the first year in which that festival invited rock bands to perform. [[Hawkwind]] appeared at many British festivals throughout the 1970s, although they sometimes showed up uninvited, set up a stage on the periphery of the event, and played for free.{{sfn|Hegarty|Halliwell|2011|p=50}}

[[file:King Crimson - Dour Festival 2003 (01).jpg|thumb|right|[[King Crimson]] performing at the Dour Festival, 2003.]]
Renewed interest in the genre in the 1990s led to the development of progressive rock festivals.{{sfn|Gill|1995|}} ProgFest, organised by Greg Walker and David Overstreet in 1993, was first held in [[UCLA]]'s Royce Hall,{{sfn|Covach|2000|}} and featured Sweden's Änglagård, the UK's IQ, Quill and Citadel. CalProg was held annually in Whittier, California during the 2000s.{{sfn|Harrell|2012|}} The North East Art Rock Festival, or [[NEARfest]],{{sfn|Karnick|2003|}} held its first event in 1999 in [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania]] and held annual sold-out concerts until 2012's NEARfest Apocalypse, which featured headliners [[U.K. (band)|U.K.]] and Renaissance.{{sfn|Weigel|2012e|}} Other festivals include the annual [http://www.progday.net ProgDay] (the longest-running and only outdoor prog festival) in [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]], the annual [[Rites of Spring Festival]] (RoSfest){{sfn|Rosfest staff|2013|}} in [[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania]], [[The Rogue Independent Music Festival]] in Atlanta, Georgia, [[Baja Prog]] in [[Mexicali|Mexicali, Mexico]], [[ProgPower USA]] in Atlanta, Georgia and [[ProgPower Europe]] in [[Baarlo]], Netherlands. Progressive Nation tours were held in 2008 and [[Progressive Nation 2009|2009]] with Dream Theater as the headline act. "Night of the Prog" in St Goarshausen (Germany) is an established European progressive rock festival held every July during 2–3 days for 12 years.

==Reception==
The genre has received both critical acclaim and criticism throughout the years. Progressive rock has been described as parallel to the classical music of [[Igor Stravinsky]] and [[Béla Bartók]].{{sfn|Covach|2000|}} This desire to expand the boundaries of rock, combined with some musicians' dismissiveness toward mainstream rock and pop, dismayed critics and led to accusations of elitism. Its intellectual, fantastic and apolitical lyrics, and shunning of rock's blues roots, were abandonments of the very things that many critics valued in rock music.{{sfn|Macan|1997|p=168-73}} Progressive rock also represented the maturation of rock as a genre, but there was an opinion among critics that rock was and should remain fundamentally tied to adolescence, so rock and maturity were mutually exclusive.{{sfn|Martin|2002|p=107}} Criticisms over the complexity of their music provoked some bands to create music that was even more complex.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}{{refn|group=nb|Yes' ''Tales from Topographic Oceans''{{sfn|Martin|1996|p=145}} and "[[The Gates of Delirium]]"{{sfn|Martin|1996|p=158}} were both responses to such criticisms. Jethro Tull's ''[[Thick As a Brick]]'', a self-satirising [[concept album]] that consisted of a single 45-minute track, arose from the band's disagreement with the labelling of their previous ''[[Aqualung (Jethro Tull album)|Aqualung]]'' as a concept album.{{sfn|Anderson|2008|}}}}

The genre's greatest appeal is to white males.{{sfn|Bowman|2001|p=184}} Most of the musicians involved were male, as was the case for most rock of the time,{{sfn|Hegarty|Halliwell|2011|p=204}} Female singers were better represented in [[progressive folk]] bands,{{sfn|Macan|1997|p=135}} who displayed a broader range of vocal styles than the progressive rock bands{{sfn|Sweers|2004|p=204}} with whom they frequently toured and shared band members.{{sfn|Sweers|2004|p=131}}

British and European audiences typically followed concert hall behaviour protocols associated with classical music performances, and were more reserved in their behaviour than audiences for other forms of rock. This confused musicians during US tours, as they found American audiences less attentive and more prone to outbursts during quiet passages.{{sfn|Macan|1997|p=263}}

These aspirations towards [[high culture]] reflect progressive rock's origins as a music created largely by [[Upper class|upper]]- and [[Middle class|middle]]-class, [[White-collar workers|white-collar]], college-educated males from [[Southern England]]. The music never reflected the concerns of or was embraced by working-class listeners,{{sfn|Macan|1997|pp=144–48}} except in the US, where listeners appreciated the musicians' virtuosity.{{sfn|Macan|1997|p=156}} Progressive rock's exotic, literary topics were considered particularly irrelevant to British youth during the late 1970s, when the nation suffered from a poor economy and frequent strikes and shortages.{{sfn|Hegarty|Halliwell|2011|pp=163–164}} Even King Crimson leader Robert Fripp dismissed progressive rock lyrics as "the philosophical meanderings of some English half-wit who is circumnavigating some inessential point of experience in his life".{{sfn|Tamm|1990|}} Bands whose darker lyrics avoided utopianism, such as King Crimson, Pink Floyd and Van der Graaf Generator, experienced less critical disfavour.{{sfn|Macan|1997|p=78}}

"I wasn't a big fan of most of what you'd call progressive rock," remarked Floyd guitarist [[David Gilmour]]. "I'm like [[Groucho Marx]]: I don't want to belong to any club that would have me for a member."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title='Echoes' to be Floyd's final cut?|magazine=[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]] #36|date=January 2002|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"I still like the original term that comes from 1969: progressive rock -- but that was with a small ‘p’ and a small ‘r.’ Prog Rock, on the other hand, has different connotations -- of grandeur and pomposity," commented Jethro Tull frontman [[Ian Anderson]] on the nuance of the genre. "Back then, when we were doing 'Thick as a Brick,' bands like Yes and Emerson Lake and Palmer were already gaining a reputation for being a little pompous and showing off with their music. I think that was OK. The reality is that certain members of Yes were quite humorous about it; they could laugh at themselves -- as, indeed, Emerson Lake and Palmer privately laughed amongst themselves about themselves." He added, "But that’s part of what was going on back then, and I think looking back on it that most of it was a pretty good experience for musicians and listeners alike. Some of it was a little bit overblown, but in the case of much of the music, it was absolutely spot on."&lt;ref&gt;http://ultimateclassicrock.com/ian-anderson-prog-overblown/&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the late 1990s, several books, convenings, and exhibitions have generated new momentum and investment in public interest design. Since then, public interest design—frequently described as a movement or field—has gained public recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cary|first=John|title=Dignifying Design|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/07/opinion/sunday/dignifying-design.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=23 October 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 6, 2012|author2=Courtney E. Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Public interest design grew out of the community design movement, which got its start in 1968 after American [[civil rights]] leader [[Whitney Young]] issued a challenge to attendees of the American Institute of Architects (AIA) national convention:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leavitt|first=Jacqueline|title=From the Studio to the Streets: Service Learning in Planning and Architecture|year=2006|publisher=Stylus Publishing|location=Sterling, VA|isbn=978-1563771002|pages=103|authorlink=Multiplying Knowledge: Service-Learning x Activism = Community Scholars|author2=Kara Hoffernan |editor=Mary C. Hardin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

".  .  .  ''you are not a profession that has distinguished itself by your social and civic contributions to the cause of civil rights, and I am sure this does not come to you as any shock.  You are most distinguished by your thunderous silence and your complete irrelevance''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.designingactivism.com/2011/12/31/whitney-young-1968-speech-to-the-aia Whitney Young 1968 Speech to the AIA]&lt;/ref&gt;"

The response to Young’s challenge was the establishment of community design centers (CDCs) across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.designcoalition.org/aboutus/our%20roots.htm Design Coalition, "Our Roots"]&lt;/ref&gt;  CDCs, which were often established with the support of area universities,&lt;ref name=Pearson&gt;{{cite book|last=Pearson|first=Jason|title=University-Community Design Partnerships: Innovations in Practice|year=2002|publisher=Princeton Architectural Press|location=New York, New York|isbn=1-56898-379-4|pages=6–7|url=http://www.nea.gov/pub/UnivCommDesign.pdf|editor=Mark Robbins|accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; provided a variety of design services – such as affordable housing - within their own neighborhoods.

In architecture schools, “design/build programs” provided outreach to meet local design needs, particularly in low-income and underserved areas.&lt;ref name=Pearson/&gt;  One of the earliest design/build programs was [[Yale University]]’s Vlock Building Project.  The project, which was initiated by students at Yale University School of Architecture in 1967, requires graduate students to design and build low-income housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hill|first=David|title=The New Frontier in Education|url=http://archrecord.construction.com/news/2012/03/The-New-Frontier-Education.asp|publisher=Architectural Record|accessdate=23 October 2012|date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most publicized programs is the [[Auburn University]] [[Rural Studio]] design/build program, which was founded in 1993.&lt;ref name=Cary/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Clemence|first=Sara|title=Avant-Garde in Alabama|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304356604577342370002244732|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=23 October 2012|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bostwick|first=William|title="Citizen Architect": The Humble Origins of Socially-Responsible Design|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/1585096/citizen-architect-humble-origins-socially-responsible-design|publisher=Fast Company|accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Rural Studio’s first project, Bryant House, was completed in 1994 for $16,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Samuel Mockbee and the Rural Studio: Community Architecture|url=http://www.nbm.org/exhibitions-collections/exhibitions/samuel-mockbee.html|publisher=National Building Museum|accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public Interest Design from the 1990s – Present==
Interest in public interest design – particularly socially responsible architecture – began to grow during the 1990s and continued into the first decade of the new millennium.  Conferences, books, and exhibitions began to showcase the design work being done beyond the community design centers,&lt;ref name=Cary /&gt; which had greatly decreased in numbers since their peak in the seventies.&lt;ref name=Pearson/&gt;

[[Non-profit]] organizations – including [[Architecture for Humanity]], BaSiC Initiative, Design Corps, [[Public Architecture]], Project H, Project Locus, and MASS Design Group – began to provide design services that served a larger segment of the population than had been served by traditional design professions.&lt;ref name=Cary/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hughes|first=C.J.|title=Does "Doing Good" Pay the Bills?|url=http://archrecord.construction.com/practice/Community-Service/2012/03/perspective-practice/Humanitarian-Work.asp|publisher=Architectural Record|accessdate=23 October 2012|date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Allweil|first1=Yael|title=The House of Dance and Feathers Mardi Gras Indian Museum-New Orleans, LA by Project Locus: Patrick Rhodes, Executive Director [EDRA/Places Awards 2007--Design].|journal=Places|date=2007|volume=19|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many public interest design organizations also provide training and [[service-learning]] programs for architecture students and graduates.  In 1999, the Enterprise Rose Architectural Fellowship was established,&lt;ref name=Cary/&gt; giving young architects the opportunity to work on three-year-long design and community development projects in low-income communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enterprisecommunity.com/solutions-and-innovation/design-leadership/rose-architectural-fellowship/about-the-fellowship Enterprise Community website, "About the Fellowship"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of the earliest formal public interest design programs include the Gulf Coast Community Design Studio at Mississippi State University&lt;ref name=Cary&gt;{{cite web|last=Cary|first=John|title=Chronology of the Public Interest Design Field|url=http://www.publicinterestdesign.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Public-Interest-Design-Chronology-120601.pdf|accessdate=23 October 2012|coauthors=PublicInterestDesign.org, University of Minnesota College of Design, Tandus Flooring}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Public Interest Design Summer Program at the [[University of Texas]]&lt;ref name=Cary/&gt;
.&lt;ref&gt;[http://soa.utexas.edu/csd/PID/overview.html Overview of Public Interest Design program, University of Texas School of Architecture] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120416152806/http://www.soa.utexas.edu/csd/PID/overview.html |date=2012-04-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2015, Portland State University launched the first graduate certificate program in Public Interest Design in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pdx.edu/the-arts/recent-and-upcoming/cpid-launches-graduate-certificate-in-public-interest-design |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218044206/http://www.pdx.edu/the-arts/recent-and-upcoming/cpid-launches-graduate-certificate-in-public-interest-design |archivedate=2015-02-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first professional-level training was conducted in July 2011 by the Public Interest Design Institute (PIDI) and held at the [[Harvard]] Graduate School of Design.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publicinterestdesign.com/harvard-school-of-design%20 Harvard School of Design course description]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2011, a survey of [[American Institute of Architects]] (AIA), 77% of AIA members agreed that the mission of the professional practice of public interest design could be defined as the belief that every person should be able to live in a socially, economically, and environmentally healthy community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bell|first=Bryan|title=Public Interest Design Takes Shape|url=http://www.metropolismag.com/pov/20120917/public-interest-design-takes-shape|publisher=Metropolismag.com|accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bell|first=Bryan|author2=Roberta Feldman |author3=Sergio Palleroni |author4=Davide Perkes |title=2011 Latrobe Prize Progress Report: Public Interest Practices in Architecture|date=31 December 2011|url=http://www.aia.org/aiaucmp/groups/aia/documents/pdf/aiab094604.pdf|accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The annual Structures for Inclusion conference showcases public interest design projects from around the world.  The first conference, which was held in 2000, was called “Design for the 98% Without Architects."&lt;ref name=Cary/&gt; Speaking at the conference, Rural Studio co-founder [[Samuel Mockbee]] challenged attendees to serve a greater segment of the population: “I believe most of us would agree that American architecture today exists primarily within a thin band of elite social and economic conditions&lt;ref name=Bell&gt;{{cite book|last=Bell|first=Bryan|title=Good Deeds, Good Design: Community Service Through Architecture|year=2003|publisher=Princeton Architectural Press|location=New York, New York|isbn=978-1568983912|pages=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;...in creating architecture, and ultimately community, it should make no difference which economic or social type is served, as long as the status quo of the actual world is transformed by an imagination that creates a proper harmony for both the affluent and the disadvantaged.&lt;ref name=Bell/&gt;" 

In 2007, the [[Cooper Hewitt National Design Museum]] held an exhibition, titled “Design for the Other 90%,” curated by Cynthia Smith. Following the success of this exhibit, Smith developed the "Design Other 90" initiative into an ongoing series, the second of which was titled “Design for the Other 90%: CITIES”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cooperhewitt.org/exhibitions/design-other-90-cities Design for the Other 90%: CITIES] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016121902/http://www.cooperhewitt.org/exhibitions/design-other-90-cities |date=2012-10-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (2011), held at the [[United Nations]] headquarters. In 2010, Andres Lipek of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York curated an exhibit, called “Small Scale, Big Change: New Architectures of Social Engagement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2010/smallscalebigchange/ MoMA Exhibition: "Small Scale, Big Change: New Architectures of Social Engagement"]&lt;/ref&gt;”&lt;ref name=Cary/&gt;

==Professional Networks==
One of the oldest professional networks related to public interest design is the professional organization is the Association for Community Design (ACD), which was founded in 1977.&lt;ref name=Cary/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.communitydesign.org/about Association for Community Design website, "About" page]&lt;/ref&gt;{{non primary source needed}}

In 2005, adopting a term coined by architect Kimberly Dowdell, the Social Economic Environmental Design (SEED) Network was co-founded by a group of community design leaders,&lt;ref name=Cary/&gt; during a meeting hosted by the Loeb Fellowship at the Harvard Graduate School of Design. The SEED Network established a common set of five principles and criteria for practitioners of public interest design. An evaluation tool called the SEED Evaluator is available to assist designers and practitioners in developing projects that align with SEED Network goals and criteria.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

In 2006, the Open Architecture Network was launched by [[Architecture for Humanity]] in conjunction with co-founder [[Cameron Sinclair]]'s TED Wish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ted.com/talks/cameron_sinclair_on_open_source_architecture.html Cameron Sinclair's TED Prize talk and wish for the Open Architecture Network]&lt;/ref&gt;{{non primary source needed}} Taking on the name Worldchanging in 2011, the network is an open-source community dedicated to improving living conditions through innovative and sustainable design. Designers of all persuasions can share ideas, designs and plans as well as collaborate and manage projects. while protecting their intellectual property rights using the [[Creative Commons]] "some rights reserved" licensing system.

In 2007, DESIGN 21: Social Design Network, an online platform built in partnership with UNESCO, was launched.

In 2011, the Design Other 90 Network was launched by the Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum, in conjunction with its Design with the Other 90%: CITIES exhibition.

In 2012, IDEO.org, with the support of The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, launched HCD Connect, a network for social sector leaders committed to human-centered design. In this context, human-centered design begins with the end-user of a product, place, or system — taking into account their needs, behaviors and desires. The fast-growing professional network of 15,000 builds on "The Human-Centered Design Toolkit,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ideo.com/work/human-centered-design-toolkit/ The Human-Centered Design Toolkit from IDEO]&lt;/ref&gt;{{non-primary source needed|date=January 2018}} which was designed specifically for people, nonprofits, and social enterprises that work with low-income communities throughout the world. People using the HCD Toolkit or human-centered design in the social sector now have a place to share their experiences, ask questions, and connect with others working in similar areas or on similar challenges.

Many of them depict warriors, apparently representing the deceased buried in the [[kurgan]], holding a [[drinking horn]] in their right hand.]]
'''Scythian religion''' refers to the mythology, ritual practices and beliefs of the [[Scythians]], an ancient [[Iranian peoples|Iranian people]] who dominated [[Central Asia]] and the [[Pontic-Caspian steppe]] in [[Eastern Europe]] throughout [[Classical Antiquity]]. What little is known of the religion is drawn from the work of the 5th century Greek historian and ethnographer [[Herodotus]]. Scythian religion is assumed to have been related to the earlier [[Proto-Indo-Iranian religion]], and to have influenced later [[Slavic mythology|Slavic]], [[Hungarian mythology|Hungarian]] and [[Turkic mythology|Turkic]] mythologies, as well as some contemporary [[Eastern Iranian]] and [[Ossetian mythology|Ossetian]] traditions. 

==Archaeological context==

The primary archaeological context of [[horse sacrifice]] are burials, notably [[chariot burial]]s, but graves with horse remains reach from the [[Eneolithic]] well into historical times. [[Herodotus]] describes the execution of horses at the burial of a [[Scythian]] king, and Iron Age [[kurgan]] graves known to contain horses number in the hundreds.

The [[Scythian]]s had some reverence for the stag, which is one of the most common motifs in their artwork, especially at funeral sites (see, for example, the [[Pazyryk burials]]). 

==Pantheon==

According to [[Herodotus]], the Scythians worshipped a pantheon of seven gods and goddesses (heptad), which he equates with [[Greek mythology|Greek divinities]] of Classical Antiquity following the ''[[interpretatio graeca]]''. He mentions eight deities in particular, the eighth being worshipped by the Royal Scythians, and gives the [[Scythian languages|Scythian names]] for seven of them as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Macaulay (1904:314). Cf. also Rolle (1980:128–129); Hort (1827:188–190).&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Scythian Ares''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: ''Ἄρης'') – [[Ares]]
*'''Tabiti''' (''Ταβιτί'') – [[Hestia]]
*'''Papaios''' (''Παπαῖος'') – [[Zeus]]
*'''Api''' (''Ἀπί'') – [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]]
*'''Oitosyros''' (''Οἰτόσυρος'') – [[Apollo]]
*'''Argimpasa''' (''Ἀργίμπασα'') – [[Aphrodite Urania]]
*'''Thagimasidas''' (''Θαγιμασάδας'') – [[Poseidon]]

==Animal sacrifice==

The mode of Scythian [[animal sacrifice]] was, in the opinion of Herodotus, relatively simple. Sacrificial animals included various kinds of livestock, though the most prestigious offering was considered to be the horse. The pig, on the other hand, was never offered in sacrifice, and apparently the Scythians were loath to keep swine within their lands.&lt;ref name="Macaulay 1904:315"&gt;Macaulay (1904:315).&lt;/ref&gt; Herodotus describes the Scythian manner of sacrifice as follows:

{{quote|The victim stands with its fore-feet tied, and the sacrificing priest stands behind the victim, and by pulling the end of the cord he throws the beast down; and as the victim falls, he calls upon the god to whom he is sacrificing, and then at once throws a noose round its neck, and putting a small stick into it he turns it round and so strangles the animal, without either lighting a fire or making any first offering from the victim or pouring any libation over it: and when he has strangled it and flayed off the skin, he proceeds to boil it. [...] Then when the flesh is boiled, the sacrificer takes a first offering of the flesh and of the vital organs and casts it in front of him.&lt;ref name="Macaulay 1904:314"&gt;Macaulay (1904:314).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Worship of "Scythian Ares"==

Although Tabiti was apparently the most important deity in the Scythian pantheon, the worship accorded to the deity Herodotus refers to as "Ares" was unique. He notes that "it is not their custom [...] to make images, altars or temples to any except Ares, but to him it is their custom to make them".&lt;ref name="Macaulay 1904:314"/&gt; He describes the construction of the altar and the subsequent sacrifice as follows:

{{quote|In each district of the several governments they have a temple of Ares set up in this way: bundles of brushwood are heaped up for about three furlongs in length and in breadth, but less in height; and on the top of this there is a level square made, and three of the sides rise sheer but by the remaining one side the pile may be ascended. Every year they pile on a hundred and fifty wagon-loads of brushwood, for it is constantly settling down by reason of the weather. Upon this pile of which I speak each people has an ancient iron sword set up, and this is the sacred symbol of Ares. To this sword they bring yearly offerings of cattle and of horses; and they have the following sacrifice in addition, beyond what they make to the other gods, that is to say, of all the enemies whom they take captive in war they sacrifice one man in every hundred, not in the same manner as they sacrifice cattle, but in a different manner: for they first pour wine over their heads, and after that they cut the throats of the men, so that the blood runs into a bowl; and then they carry this up to the top of the pile of brushwood and pour the blood over the sword. This, I say, they carry up; and meanwhile below by the side of the temple they are doing thus: they cut off all the right arms of the slaughtered men with the hands and throw them up into the air, and then when they have finished offering the other victims, they go away; and the arm lies wheresoever it has chanced to fall, and the corpse apart from it.&lt;ref name="Macaulay 1904:315"/&gt;}}

According to [[Tadeusz Sulimirski]], this form of worship continued among the descendants of the Scythians, the [[Alans]], through to the 4th century CE.&lt;ref&gt;Sulimirski (1985:158–159).&lt;/ref&gt;; this tradition may be reflected in [[Jordanes]]' assertion that [[Attila]] was able to assert his authority over the Scythians through his possession of the "Sword of [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]]"&lt;ref&gt;Geary (1994:63).&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Enarei==
The ''[[Enarei]]'' were a privileged caste of hereditary priests which played an important political role in Scythian society as they were believed to have received the gift of prophesy directly from the goddess Argimpasa.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Macaulay (1904:317); Christian (1998:148).&lt;/ref&gt; The method employed by the ''Enarei'' differed from that practised by traditional Scythian diviners: whereas the latter used a bundle of willow rods, the ''Enarei'' used strips cut from the bark of the linden tree (genus ''[[tilia]]'') to tell the future. The ''Enarei'' were also noted for [[crossdress|dressing themselves in the clothes of women]], a custom which Herodotus understands as being reflected in the title ''ena-rei'', glossing this as ''ἀνδρό-γυνοι'' or "man-women".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

'''Sennit''' is a type of [[rope|cordage]] made by [[braid|plaiting]] strands of dried fibre or grass. It can be used ornamentally in crafts, like a kind of ''[[macrame]]'', or to make [[straw hat]]s. Sennit is an important material in the cultures of [[Oceania]], where it is used in traditional architecture, boat building, fishing and as an ornamentation.&lt;ref name=buck&gt;{{cite book |title=Vikings of the Sunrise |last=Hiroa |first=Te Rangi |year=1964 |publisher=Whitecombe and Tombs Ltd |location=New Zealand|page=27 |url=http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-BucViki-t1-front-d1-d1.html |accessdate=21 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tonga===
Sennit in Tonga is called ''kafa.''

===Fiji===
The Fijian term used is ''[[magimagi]]'', a craft product of the [[Fiji]] Islands.

===Hawai'i===
The term is also used in [[Hawaii]] and throughout [[Polynesia]] for cordage made by braiding the fibers of [[coconut]] husks. It was important in attaching the ''[[Ama (sailing)|{{okina}}ama]]'' ([[outrigger]] float) via the ''[[Aka (sailing)|iako]]'' (spars) to the hull of [[Outrigger canoe|canoes]], stones to war-club handles, erecting ''hale'' (houses), etc.

===Samoa===
In the [[Samoan language]], sennit is called ''{{okina}}afa''.  It was used as cordage in the construction of traditional [[Architecture of Samoa|Samoan architecture]], boat building with many other functional uses. ''{{okina}}Afa'' is handmade from dried [[coconut]] fibre from the husk of certain varieties of coconuts with long fibres, particularly the ''niu'afa'' (''afa'' palm).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=An Introduction to Samoan Custom |last=Grattan |first=F.J.H.  |year=1985 |publisher=R. McMillan |location=New Zealand |isbn= 0-908712-13-8|page= |pages=164, 165 |url=http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-GraIntr-_N65654.html|accessdate=14 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sennit is mentioned in [[Robert Gibbings]] book ''Over the Reefs'' (1948).&lt;ref&gt;"Over the Reefs", J.M. Dent &amp; Sons Ltd., London, 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; He refers to its use in Samoa in 1946, where he was able to observe its being made on many occasions.  He notes that its crafting was a constant occupation in Samoan villages, because so much of the material was required. A significant quote from the book, made by a village chief to Gibbings, emphasises the importance of sennit in Samoan culture: "In your country," said a chief to me, "only a few men can make nails, but in Samoa, everyone can make nails" (p.&amp;nbsp;118). He was referring to the sennit that is used to bind the structures or huts in which they lived. Sennit had a variety of other uses, including in shark fishing, where it was used as a [[noose]] that was placed over the shark's head as it came alongside the canoe.

"They showed me the sennit noose they had used—five years old and as good as new. They said it would last another five years if cared for." Robert Gribbings.

== Plot ==
[[Severus Snape]] is enjoying a drink in a bar when a stranger, whose face is covered, joins him. Asking Snape about himself, Snape tells him a story.

Some time before, the Marauders - [[James Potter (character)|James Potter]], [[Remus Lupin]], [[Sirius Black]] and [[Peter Pettigrew (character)|Peter Pettigrew]] - were in the same bar celebrating their graduation from Hogwarts. Upon seeing Snape, James challenges him to a duel. Before they all [[Magic in Harry Potter#Apparition and Disapparition|disapparate]] elsewhere, [[Lily Evans]] sees them.

They appear on a forest, and James and Snape start dueling. However, Snape eventually becomes victorious, so Remus, Sirius, and Peter join the fight, and they all produce the [[Fiendfyre]] spell, creating a big, four headed fire monster, with each head being their animal form. Snape disapparates to elsewhere in the forest, and Remus, Sirius and James do too, while Peter joins them on foot.

Using [[Legilimency]], Snape predicts their next attack. However, the Marauders attack him at the same time, eventually having him cornered. Snape, remembering their bullying throughout the years, and Lily, rebounds the spells, applies the [[Cruciatus Curse|Cruciatus curse]] to Sirius, and [[Sectumsempra]] to Remus. Before cursing Peter, he transforms into a rat and escapes. Snape approaches James and attempts to kill him, but Lily apparates before him, demanding an explanation. Snape apologizes for calling her a mudblood (seen in a flashback in ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]''). Lily tells Snape that she will forgive him if he changes and stops being with dark wizards, such as [[Bellatrix Lestrange]]. Lily disapparates with James, Remus, and Sirius.

Returning to the first scene, the stranger tells Snape that he feels how it is to be subjugated. Snape demands to know who the stranger is, and he reveals his face: he is [[Lord Voldemort]], answering "You Know Who".

Accessed Sept. 24, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

To date, the term persists in the officially sanctioned names of several municipalities, such as [[Squaw Grove Township, DeKalb County, Illinois|Squaw Grove Township, Illinois]] and [[Squaw Township, Warren County, Iowa|Squaw Township, Iowa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{GNIS|429791|name=Township of Squaw Grove}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{GNIS|468747|name=Squaw Township}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current status==
The term "squaw" is now universally offensive due to its use for hundreds of years in a derogatory context.&lt;ref name="NMAI"/&gt; Apart from any linguistic debate, the word "squaw" is offensive  because of usage that demeans Native American women, ranging from condescending images (e.g., picture postcards depicting "Indian squaw and papoose") to [[racialized]] epithets.&lt;ref name="Garcia.2012"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Contested images women of color in popular culture|last = Garcia|first = Alma|publisher = Altimia Press|year = 2012|isbn = 0759119635|location = Lanham, Md|pages = 157–168}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Green 1975&lt;/ref&gt;  It treats non-white women as if they were second-class citizens or exotic objects.&lt;ref name="Garcia.2012"/&gt;

Some Native women have attempted to address this problem by calling attention to what they consider the appropriate indigenous context of this word (Palmer 2001). During a featured panel discussion titled "Squaw: Algonkian Linguistics and Colonial Politics" at the "All Women of Red Nations" Women's Studies Conference at Southern Connecticut State University in 2001, Native women from the [[Wampanoag people|Wampanoag]] and [[Schaghticoke (tribe)|Schaghticoke]] Nations stressed the need for accurate understandings of colonial histories, and respect for linguistic differences, to avoid misrepresenting and disrespecting Algonquian language recovery efforts.&lt;ref name=WRN2001&gt;Bruchac, Marge, with Jessie Little Doe Fermino (Wampanoag) and Trudie Lamb Richmond (Schaghticoke). 2001. "Squaw: Algonkian Linguistics and Colonial Politics," featured panel discussion at the "All Women of Red Nations" Women's Studies Conference at Southeastern University, New Haven, CT.&lt;/ref&gt; 

No matter the linguistic origins, many Native women feel that any "reclamation" efforts would only apply to a small percentage of Native women – those from the Algonquian language groups – while the slur has now been applied in a degrading manner to all Native women.&lt;ref name=AIM-SC/&gt;&lt;ref name=AIMsc/&gt; And the history and depth of this slur is now too long, and too painful, for it to ever take on a positive meaning among Indigenous women or Indigenous communities as a whole.&lt;ref name=Vowel-1/&gt; In 2015, Jodi Lynn Maracle ([[Mohawk people|Mohawk]]) and Agnes Williams ([[Seneca people|Seneca]]) petitioned the [[Buffalo Common Council]], to change the name of "Squaw Island" to ''[[Deyowenoguhdoh]]''.&lt;ref name=BNews1/&gt; [[Seneca Nation of New York|Seneca Nation]] President Maurice John Sr., and Chief G. Ava Hill of the [[Six Nations of the Grand River]] wrote letters petitioning for the name change as well, with Chief Hill writing,   

&lt;blockquote&gt;The continued use and acceptance of the word 'Squaw' only perpetuates the idea that indigenous women and culture can be deemed as impure, sexually perverse barbaric and dirty ... Please do eliminate the slur 'Squaw' from your community.&lt;ref name=BNews1/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Anti-racist groups have also worked to educate about, and encourage the elimination of, the slur:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When people say "it never used to bother Indian women to be called squaw," respond with the following questions and statement.

{{quote|Were American Indian women or people ever asked? Have you ever asked an American Indian woman, man, or child how they feel about the word? (Do not say the word yourself, simply call it the "s" word) then state that it has always been used to insult American Indian women.}}

When people ask "why now?" explain that:

{{quote|Through communication and education American Indian people have come to understand the derogatory meaning of the word. American Indian women claim the right to define ourselves as women and we reject the offensive term squaw.|from the web page of the [[American Indian Movement]], Southern California Chapter&lt;ref name=AIM-SC/&gt;}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Reflecting efforts to be more culturally sensitive, several dictionaries now warn that ''squaw'' is considered to be, can be, or is offensive (NSOED, Merriam-Webster, and American Heritage, respectively).

==Derogatory usage==
{{more footnotes|date=November 2018}}
In most colonial texts Squaw was used as general word for Indigenous women. It also became a derogatory adjective used against some men, in "squaw man," meaning either "a man who does woman's work" (similar to other languages) or "a white man married to an Indian woman and living with her people" (Hodge 1910). (This was a popular literary stereotype, as in ''[[The Squaw Man (disambiguation)|The Squaw Man]]''.)

In a [[western fiction|western novel]] by [[Max Brand]] (1926), a male character asks a female character about her intentions:

{{quote|"And follow this fortune hunter like a—like a squaw behind her man?"

"Like a squaw," she answered steadily, "if you choose to use that word!"}}

The writer [[Mourning Dove (author)|Mourning Dove]] (1927), of [[Colville (tribe)|Colville]], [[Okanagan people|Okanagan]] and [[Irish people|Irish]] ancestry, showed her mixed-race heroine's opinion of the word:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If I was to marry a white man and he would dare call me a 'squaw'—as an epithet with the sarcasm that we know so well—I believe that I would feel like killing him.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Perhaps in view of such uses as those above, one early-20th-century dictionary of American usage called ''squaw'' "a contemptuous term" (Crowell 1928).&lt;ref&gt;When [[Isaac Asimov]] needed a slur in ''[[Pebble in the Sky]]'' (1950) that [[science-fiction]]al natives of other planets would use against natives of Earth, he looked to this term:

&lt;/blockquote&gt;Lieutenant Claudy… said harshly, "Your name, Earthie-squaw?"

The term itself was richly insulting…&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The activist [[LaDonna Harris]], telling of her work in empowering [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] schoolchildren in the 1960s at [[Ponca City]], [[Oklahoma]], recounted:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We tried to find out what the children found painful about school [causing a very high dropout rate]. (...) The children said that they felt humiliated almost every day by teachers calling them "squaws" and using all those other old horrible terms (Harris 2000).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In this case the term seems to have been regularly applied to girls in the lower grades of the elementary school, long before their puberty.

===Sexual references===
An early comment in which "squaw" appears to have a sexual meaning is from the Canadian writer [[Pauline Johnson]] (1892), whose father was a [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]] chief.  She wrote about the title character in ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=zd0OAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA235&amp;dq=Algonquin+Maid+Wanda&amp;ei=OyaZSJa_LKaijgHAhpDLBw#PPA153,M1 An Algonquin Maiden]'' by G. Mercer Adam and A. Ethelwyn Wetherald:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Poor little Wanda! not &lt;!--lower-case in original--&gt; only is she non-descript and ill-starred, but as usual the authors take away her love, her life, and last and most terrible of all, reputation; for they permit a crowd of men-friends of the hero to call her a "squaw" and neither hero nor authors deny that she is a squaw.  It is almost too sad when so much prejudice exists against the Indians, that any one should write up an Indian heroine with such glaring accusations against her virtue, and no contradictory statements from either writer, hero or circumstance.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Explicit statements that "squaw" came from a word meaning "female genitals" gained currency in the 1970s.  Perhaps the first example was in Sanders and Peek (1973):

&lt;blockquote&gt;That curious concept of 'squaw', the enslaved, demeaned, voiceless childbearer, existed and exists only in the mind of the non-Native American and is probably a [[French language|French]] corruption of the [[Iroquois language|Iroquois]] word ''otsiskwa'' [also spelled ''ojiskwa''] meaning 'female sexual parts', a word almost clinical both denotatively and connotatively. The corruption suggests nothing about the Native American's attitude toward women; it does indicate the ''[[Wiktionary:wasichu|wasichu]]'s'' [white man's&lt;ref&gt;[[Lakota language|Lakota]], literally [he who] "takes the fat" or "greedy one".&lt;/ref&gt;] view of Native American women in particular if not all women in general.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Early use by English colonists===
One of its earliest appearances in print is "the squa [[sachem|sachim]], or {{sic|hide=y|Massachusets}} queen" in ''[[Mourt's Relation]]'' (1622), one of the first chronicles of the [[Plymouth colony]] (Goddard 1997).  William Wood similarly defined "Squaw – a woman" in his list, "A Small Nomenclature of the Indian Language," in ''New England's Prospect'' (Wood 1637). 

[[File:ChoctawBelle.jpg|thumb|Portrait of a young [[Choctaw]] woman, 1850]]
The adjective form of "squaw" has been widely used in English-language names invented by colonists, given to indigenous plants used by Native peoples as medicines specific to female complaints. The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' notes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In names of plants, as squaw-berry, the edible berry of one of several shrubs, esp. the bear-berry, ''Arctostaphylos uva-ursi'', an evergreen prostrate creeper; squaw corn, a variety of maize having soft grains of various colours; squaw huckleberry, -root, -weed, whortleberry (see quots.). Also squaw-bush, -carpet, -flower, -grass, -mint, -vine (OED 1989).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Handbook of American Indians North of Mexico'' lists several such plants that are still prized by both traditional herbalists and modern pharmaceutical companies.

&lt;blockquote&gt;After the squaw have been named: Squawberry (the partridge berry), squaw bush (in various parts of the country, ''Cornus stolonifera,'' ''C. sericea,'' and ''C. canadensis'') ... squaw flower (''Trillium erectum,'' also called squaw root) ... squaw mint (the American pennyroyal), squawroot (in different parts of the country, ''Trillium erectum,'' the black and the blue cohosh, ''Conopholis americana,'' and other plants) ... squaw vine (a New England name for the partridge berry) (Hodge 1910).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1940, the anthropologist Frank Speck noted the appearance of this morpheme in various terms in the [[Penobscot people|Penobscot]] language, including the following.

&lt;blockquote&gt;nȣkskwe'sis = girl, nȣkskwe = young woman, na'kskwe'si'zak = a call for women to come and dance, Mi'kmaskwe'sis = a little Micmac woman, agwuskwe'zun = women's head coverings, gwanuskwa'kwsȣsak = long, peaked hood-like caps so characteristic of the northern peoples (Speck 1940)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Efforts to rename placenames and terms with ''squaw'' in them==
The [[United States Board on Geographic Names]] currently does not ban the use of the word ''squaw'' in placenames (only two slurs are banned at the federal level).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nbcnews.com/id/46531169/ns/us_news-life/t/negro-creek-wop-draw-place-names-offend#.W_OuM-hKiM8&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, Indigenous activists have continued to work both locally and in more general educational efforts, to [[Geographical renaming|rename the locations]] across America that contain the slur, as well as to eliminate the slur from the lexicon in general.&lt;ref name=AIM-SC/&gt;&lt;ref name=Callimachi&gt;{{cite web | last = Callimachi| first =Rukmini| authorlink = | title = Removing 'Squaw' from the Lexicon| work = The Sacramento Union| publisher = |date=December 2006 | url =http://www.sacunion.com/pages/nation/articles/3683/ | archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20050921110844/http://www.sacunion.com/pages/nation/articles/3683/ | archivedate = 2005-04-01 | doi = | accessdate = 2018-11-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In 1999, the [[Montana Legislature]] created an advisory group to replace the word ''squaw'' in local place names and required any replacement of a sign to bear the new name&lt;ref&gt;Montana Code 2-15-149&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2000, the Maine Indian Tribal-State Commission and the [[Maine Legislature]] collaborated to pass a law eliminating the words ''squaw'' and ''squa'' from all of the state's waterways, islands, and mountains. Some of those sites have been renamed with the word ''[[moose]]''; others, in a nod to [[Wabanaki Confederacy|Wabanaki]] language-recovery efforts, are now being given new place-appropriate names in the [[Penobscot people|Penobscot]] and [[Passamaquoddy]] languages.&lt;ref&gt;Carrier, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[American Ornithologists' Union]] changed the official American English name of the duck ''Clangula hyemalis'' from ''oldsquaw'' to the long-standing British name ''[[long-tailed duck]]'', because of wildlife biologists' concerns about cooperation with Native Americans involved in conservation efforts, and for standardization.&lt;ref&gt;American Ornithologists' Union, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2003, Squaw Peak in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Arizona]], was renamed [[Piestewa Peak]] to honor the [[Iraq War]] casualty Pfc. [[Lori Piestewa]], the first Native American woman to die in combat for the US.
* In October 2006, members of [[Idaho]]'s [[Coeur d'Alene Tribe]] called for the removal of the word ''squaw'' from the names of 13 locations in Idaho, with many tribal members reportedly believing the "woman's genitals" etymology.&lt;ref&gt;Hagengruber, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
* On January 15, 2008, the British Columbian portion of a tributary of the [[Tatshenshini River]] was officially renamed [[Dollis Creek]] by the [[BC Geographical Names]] Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dollis Creek|url=http://apps.gov.bc.ca/pub/bcgnws/names/47165.html |publisher=BCGNIS|accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name "Squaw Creek" had been previously rescinded on December 8, 2000.
* In 2011, the State Office of Historic Preservation updated  the name of a California Historical Landmark formerly called  "Squaw Rock", located between Hopland and Cloverdale, in the Russian river canyon, by changing the formal designation to "Frog Woman Rock" as a way to honor and respect the cultural heritage of the Pomo peoples of this region.
* In 2015, the [[Buffalo Common Council]] voted to change the island formerly called "Squaw Island" to "[[Unity Island]]" (In the [[Seneca language]], ''Deyowenoguhdoh''), after being petitioned by members of the [[Seneca Nation of New York]].&lt;ref name=BNews1/&gt;
* In 2017, the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service|U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] renamed the [[Squaw Creek National Wildlife Refuge]] in Missouri to [https://www.fws.gov/refuge/Loess_Bluffs/about.html Loess Bluffs National Wildlife Refuge], citing the alleged derogatory nature of the word.
* In October 2017, the city of Provo, Utah announced that it will be working alongside a local citizens' initiative to consider renaming Squaw Peak, though final authority for placenames rests with state and federal officials.&lt;ref name=KingProvo&gt;{{cite news|last1=King|first1=Jesse|title=Provo explores renaming Squaw Peak but hasn't agreed on new moniker|url=https://www.deseretnews.com/article/865690632/Provo-explores-renaming-Squaw-Peak-but-hasnt-agreed-on-new-moniker.html|accessdate=12 October 2017|publisher=Deseret News}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On November 20, 2018, [[Saskatchewan]]'s Killsquaw Lake - the site of a 19th century massacre of a group of [[Cree]] women - was renamed Kikiskitotawânawak Iskêwak, which, in Cree, means "we honour the women". The renaming effort was led by Indigenous lawyer, Kellie Wuttunee, in consultation with Cree elders and community leaders. "To properly respect and honour First Nations women, we can no longer have degrading geographic names in Saskatchewan. ... Even if unintentional, the previous name was harmful. By changing the name, we are giving a voice to the ones who are silenced," said Wuttunee, who has worked on [[Missing and murdered Indigenous women|missing and murdered Indigenous women cases]].

The '''''Terminator''''' series is an American [[Science fiction|science-fiction]] [[media franchise|franchise]] created by [[James Cameron]] and [[Gale Anne Hurd]]. It encompasses a series of films, comics, novels, and additional media concerning battles between [[Skynet (Terminator)|Skynet]]'s [[synthetic intelligence|synthetic intelligent]] machine network, and [[John Connor]]'s Resistance forces and the rest of the [[human|human race]]. Skynet's most well-known products in its genocidal goals are [[Terminator (character concept)|the various terminator models]], such as [[Terminator (character)|the T-800 (Model 101)]], who was portrayed by [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] from the [[The Terminator|original film]] in 1984, and similar units he also portrayed in the later films. As of February 2010, the franchise has generated $3 billion in revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20100217005514/en/Pacificor-Names-Latham-Watkins-Field-Terminator-Inquiries|title=Pacificor Names Latham &amp; Watkins to Field Terminator Inquiries|website=[[Business Wire]]|publisher=[[Berkshire Hathaway]]|date=February 17, 2010|accessdate=March 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Premise==
[[File:Terminator(Future War).png|thumb|left|250px|Concept art illustrating the conflicts between Skynet and the Resistance in a post-apocalyptic, futuristic setting, envisioned by creator James Cameron for the 1984 film ''[[The Terminator]]''.]]
The central theme of the franchise is the battle for survival between the nearly-extinct human race and the world-spanning [[synthetic intelligence]] that is [[Skynet (Terminator)|Skynet]]. Skynet is positioned in the [[The Terminator|first film]] as a U.S. strategic "Global Digital Defense Network" computer system by [[Cyberdyne Systems]] which becomes self-aware. Upon activation, it immediately perceives all humans as a "security threat", and formulates a plan to systematically wipe out humanity itself. The system initiates a nuclear [[first strike]] against Russia, thereby ensuring a devastating [[second strike]] and a [[nuclear holocaust]] which it anticipates will instantly wipe out much of humanity. Indeed, it does, with approximately 3 billion casualties – more than half of the total human population at the time – in the resulting [[nuclear war]]. In the post-apocalyptic aftermath, Skynet later builds up its own autonomous machine-based military capability which includes the [[Terminator (character concept)|Terminators]] used against individual human targets and, therefore, proceeds to wage a persistent [[total war]] against the surviving elements of humanity, some of whom have militarily organized themselves into a Resistance. At some point in this future, Skynet develops the ability of [[time travel]], and both it and the Resistance seek to use this technology in order to win the war; either by altering or accelerating past events in Skynet's favour, or by preventing or forestalling the (present) apocalyptic timeline.

===Judgment Day===
&lt;!-- Please do not change this section title, it has an incoming link from Judgment Day (disambiguation). --&gt;
In the franchise, Judgment Day (a reference to the biblical [[Last Judgment|Day of Judgment]]) is referred to as the date on which Skynet becomes self-aware, decides to exterminate mankind, and launches a nuclear attack on Russia to provoke a nuclear counter-strike against the United States. Due to time travel and consequent ability to change the future, several differing dates are given for Judgment Day in different films in the franchise. In ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'', Sarah states that Judgment Day will occur on August 29, 1997. However, due to the attack on Cyberdyne Systems in the second film, ''[[Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines]]'' shows that the Judgment Day holocaust has been postponed to July 25, 2004. In the separate chronology of ''[[Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles]]'', the attack on Cyberdyne Systems in the second film delayed Judgment Day to April 21, 2011.

In ''[[Terminator Genisys]]'', the fifth film in the franchise, Judgment Day was believed to have been postponed to an unspecified day in October 2017, attributed to altered events in both the future and the past. Sarah and Kyle time travel to 2017 and seemingly defeat Skynet but the system core, contained inside a subterranean blast shelter, secretly survives, thus further delaying Judgment Day.

The real-world passing of April 21, 2011, the date for Judgment Day in ''Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles'', prompted [[BBC News]] to pose the question, "How close were the ''Terminator'' films to the reality of 2011?". This television news spot attempted to compare and contrast how far present day technology and society had developed in relation to the predictions of the motion picture franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-13159616|title=How close were the Terminator films to the reality of 2011?|date=April 21, 2011|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 19, 2017, during the question and answer session after a special screening of ''Terminator 2: Judgment Day 3D'', James Cameron officially announced that Linda Hamilton will return to the series to reprise her role as Sarah Connor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/linda-hamilton-set-return-terminator-franchise-1040948 |title=Linda Hamilton Set to Return to 'Terminator' Franchise (Exclusive) |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=2017-09-19 |accessdate=2017-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story treatment was written by James Cameron himself, serving as the outline for the writers' room. Cameron and Miller meet in-person once a week to discuss the film in detail and talk via phone daily to discuss the writing process. Miller stated that the tone will be the same as the first two films. Cameron and Miller jointly acknowledged that the focus of the film is not to create more sequels or generate revenue, but to instead create the proper sequel, with the goal being to just make a good movie. However, there is a plan for a trilogy that would conclude the story should this first film prove successful.

The writers' room consisted of [[Josh Friedman]], creator of ''Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles'', [[David S.

Cameron declined to reveal the nature of the new Terminator villain at the event, stating it would "ruin the surprise", but was referred to by Cameron as "he" and "really cool". The director also made mention of creating a theme park attraction akin to ''[[T2 3-D: Battle Across Time]]'' should the film prove successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theterminatorfans.com/terminator-6-writers-room/ |title=Terminator 6 Writers Room |publisher=TheTerminatorFans.com |date=2017-09-20 |accessdate=2017-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a fan event in Birmingham, England, Arnold Schwarzenegger confirmed that Linda Hamilton had begun training for the film.

During the production of ''Terminator Genisys'', the producers of the film hoped to start a new trilogy of films, with ''Terminator Genisys'' being the first of the three films.

[[Ashley Miller (screenwriter)|Ashley Miller]] and [[Zack Stentz]], who had worked together previously on ''Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles'', were named as writers and executive producers.

''[[USA Today]]'' gave the premiere episode 3 and a half stars out of four, calling the series, "smart, tough and entertaining."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last = Bianco|first = Robert|title = Lena Headey saves the day in 'Terminator: Sarah Connor'|publisher = [[USA Today]]|url = https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/reviews/2008-01-10-sarah-connor_N.htm|date = January 13, 2008|accessdate =January 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The New York Times]]'' referred to it as "one of the more humanizing adventures in science fiction to arrive in quite a while",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last = Bellafante|first = Ginia|title = Running and Fighting, All to Save Her Son|publisher = The New York Times|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/12/arts/television/12bell.html?_r=1&amp;ref=arts&amp;oref=slogin|date = January 12, 2008|accessdate =January 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' declared the show "has heart and feeling" and "an almost [[Shakespearean]] exploration of fate vs. character" that features "plenty of really great fight scenes, and explosions, as well as neat devices developed in the future and jury-rigged in the present."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last = McNamara|first = Mary|title = The future looks bright for 'Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles'|publisher = [[Los Angeles Times]]|url = http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/tv/la-et-sarah11jan11,1,894804.story?coll=la-entnews-tv-topstories&amp;ctrack=1&amp;cset=true|date = January 11, 2008|accessdate =January 14, 2008| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080328030907/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/tv/la-et-sarah11jan11,1,894804.story?coll=la-entnews-tv-topstories&amp;ctrack=1&amp;cset=true| archivedate = March 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, film industry journal ''[[Variety (magazine)|Daily Variety]]'' declared the series pilot "a slick brand extension off this profitable assembly line" that showcases "impressive and abundant action with realistic visual effects and, frankly, plenty of eye candy between Glau and Headey."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last = Lowry|first = Brian|title = Review Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles|publisher = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|url = http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117935746.html?categoryid=32&amp;cs=1|date = January 4, 2008|accessdate =January 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the start of the second season, Variety praised "Headey's gritty performance as Sarah — managing to be smart, resourceful and tough, yet melancholy and vulnerable as well" and that the Chronicles "continue to deliver", getting "considerable mileage out of the constant peril" facing the characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last = Lowry|first = Brian|title = Review Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles|publisher = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|url = http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117938177.html?categoryid=32&amp;cs=1|date = September 3, 2008|accessdate =September 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Connecticut Post]]'' placed it on its list of the top 10 TV shows of 2008: "It's smart, with thought-provoking meditations on parenthood, destiny and human nature, and features good performances by Lena Headey, as Sarah, and Summer Glau."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cuda |first=Amanda |title=The year's 10 best TV shows |publisher=[[Connecticut Post]] |url=http://www.connpost.com/ci_11272262 |date=December 19, 2008 |accessdate=December 20, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090127041541/http://www.connpost.com/ci_11272262 |archivedate=January 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], a [[review aggregator]] which assigns a normalised score out of 100 to each review, the first season currently holds an [[arithmetic mean|average]] score of 74 based on 24 reviews.&lt;ref name="meta1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/shows/terminatorthesarahconnorchronicles|title=Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles: Reviews|work=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=''CNET Networks''|accessdate=December 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second season has a score of 67, based on only 4 reviews.&lt;ref name="meta2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/shows/terminatorthesarahconnorchroniclesseason2|title=Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles Season Two: Reviews|work=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=''CNET Networks''|accessdate=December 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural impact===
The ''Terminator'' franchise, most notably James Cameron's original films, ''The Terminator'' and ''Terminator 2: Judgment Day'', has had a significant impact on popular culture. The film franchise placed #17 on the top 25 greatest film franchises by [[IGN]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/749/749005p1.html|title=Top 25 Movie Franchises of All Time: #17|publisher=IGN|work=IGN Entertainment, Inc|date=December 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is also in the top 30 highest-grossing franchises. According to [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the ''Terminator'' franchise is the sixth highest rated franchise on the site behind the [[Toy Story (franchise)|''Toy Story'' franchise]], the [[Dollars trilogy]], [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy]], the [[Mad Max (franchise)|''Mad Max'' franchise]], and the [[Star Wars|original ''Star Wars'' trilogy]], but in front of the [[Indiana Jones (franchise)|''Indiana Jones'' franchise]].

''The Terminator'' has been selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being "Culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/12/30/DDB91515MB.DTL | archive-url=https://archive.is/20120912022824/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/12/30/DDB91515MB.DTL | dead-url=yes | archive-date=September 12, 2012 | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | title=Library of Congress adds 'Terminator' to archive | date=December 31, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The American Film Institute (AFI) has also recognized both films on a number of occasions: the line "[[I'll be back]]" from ''The Terminator'' placed as the 37th-best movie quote, while "[[Hasta la vista, baby]]" from ''Terminator 2'' ranked 76th on the same list. The Terminator character from ''The Terminator'' was voted the 22nd-greatest villain; meanwhile, the T-800 (of the same likeness) in ''Terminator 2: Judgment Day'' was voted the 48th-greatest hero; this is the only time the same character has appeared on the two opposing lists. In the 100 Years...100 series list, the ''Terminator'' franchise was voted the 42nd most thrilling. Finally, ''Terminator 2: Judgment Day'' ranked 8th on AFI's top 10 list in the science fiction genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://connect.afi.com/site/PageServer?pagename=100YearsList |title=American Film Institute: |publisher=Connect.afi.com |accessdate=January 14, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716070826/http://connect.afi.com/site/PageServer?pagename=100YearsList |archivedate=July 16, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both films are the source of numerous pop culture references, such as the use of "I'll be back" in countless other media, including different variations of the phrase by Arnold himself in many of his subsequent films, and in cameo appearances by Robert Patrick as the T-1000, in ''[[The Last Action Hero]]'' and ''[[Wayne's World (film)|Wayne's World]]''. ''[[The Simpsons]]'' have also spoofed both films, and the T-1000 in particular, on a number of occasions.&lt;ref&gt;Season 5 Episode 16 [[Homer Loves Flanders]] &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Season 2 Episode 14 [[Principal Charming]] &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.duffzone.org/content.php?title=reft2 &lt;/ref&gt;

The references are also made when Schwarzenegger was elected as California governor during the recall election, which a newspaper headline said "Davis Terminated."{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

''Terminator 2'' is the only film in the series to garner attention at the Academy Awards, with six nominations and four wins {&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103064/awards |title=Terminator 2: Judgment Day: Awards |accessdate=March 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;} and is rated highly among critics.&lt;ref name="rt-t2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mc-t2" /&gt; In 2006 the readers of [[Total Film]] magazine rated ''The Terminator'' cinema's 72nd best film, and ''Terminator 2: Judgment Day'' the 33rd.{&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://lifevsfilm.blogspot.com/p/total-film-top-100.html | title= Total Film Top 100|via=Blogspot }}&lt;/ref&gt;}

All five ''Terminator'' films have had very respectable box office gross, though after James Cameron left the series it saw [[diminishing returns]] in subsequent films. ''The Terminator'' made $78 million worldwide, far surpassing its $6 million budget and becoming a major [[sleeper hit]]. ''Terminator 2: Judgment Day'' grossed approximately $520 million globally, becoming a major blockbuster and the top-grossing film of 1991. ''Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines'' did not fare as well, with $433 million, making it the seventh highest-grossing film of 2003. ''Terminator Salvation'' grossed an estimated $371 million worldwide, a figure below industry expectations and the lowest of any of the sequels in the series.&lt;ref name="mojo-franchise" /&gt;

In 1988, [[NOW Comics]] published an ongoing series with John Connor as the main character in 2031, after sending Kyle Reese back to 1984 to protect his mother. The Terminators in this canon had more human-like endoskeletons, and some issues would deal with subordinates of Connor's in the ruins of certain geographic areas. The seventeen issue series was followed by two limited series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic | title= The Terminator | publisher= [[NOW Comics]] | date= 1988–1989 | issue= 1–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic | writer= [[Ron Fortier]] | penciller= [[Alex Ross]] | title= [[Terminator: The Burning Earth]] | publisher= [[NOW Comics]] | date= March–July 1990 | issue= 1–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic | title= Terminator: All My Futures Past | publisher= [[NOW Comics]] | date= 1990 | issue= 1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dark Horse Comics]] acquired the rights in 1990 and published ''The Terminator'' (titled ''Tempest'' in [[trade paperback (comics)|trade paperbacks]] to distinguish itself), where a group of human soldiers and four Terminators come to the present, to respectively kill or protect the developers of Skynet. One of the Terminators is Dudley, a human doctor with cybernetic implants, and he betrays his group as he feels he can make a difference in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic | writer = [[John Arcudi]] | penciller=[[Chris Warner (comics)|Chris Warner]]| title = The Terminator | publisher = [[Dark Horse Comics]] | issue = 4 issues | date = August–November 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following year's sequel ''Secondary Objectives'', the surviving Terminator leader, C890.L, is reprogrammed to destroy another Terminators sent to aid him and kill Sarah Connor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic | writer = [[James Dale Robinson]] | penciller=[[Paul Gulacy]]| title = The Terminator: Secondary Objectives | publisher = [[Dark Horse Comics]] | issue = 4 issues | date = July–October 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the immediate follow-up ''The Enemy Within'', C890.L rebuilds and modifies himself to become more dangerous than ever, while a team of human assassins attempt to return to the past and kill a Skynet developer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic | writer = [[Ian Edginton]] | artist = [[Vincent Giarrano]] | title = The Terminator: The Enemy Within | publisher = [[Dark Horse Comics]] | issue = 4 issues | date = November 1991 to February 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1992 ''Endgame'' concludes this arc, with human colonel Mary Randall, having lost Dudley and her soldiers in the final battle with C890.L, protecting Sarah Connor as she goes into labor. Sarah gives birth to a girl named Jane, whose future leadership means Skynet is quickly defeated and never develops time travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic | writer = [[James Dale Robinson]] | penciller=[[Jackson Guice]] | title = The Terminator: Endgame | publisher = [[Dark Horse Comics]] | issue = 3 issues | date = September–November 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Terminators have crossed over with ''[[RoboCop]]'', ''[[Superman]]'', and ''[[Alien vs. Predator]]''. In ''[[RoboCop versus The Terminator (comic book)|RoboCop versus The Terminator]]'' (1992) and ''[[Superman vs. The Terminator: Death to the Future]]'' (2000), the heroes must prevent the war ravaged future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic | writer = [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] | artist = [[Walt Simonson]] | title = [[RoboCop versus The Terminator (comic book)|RoboCop versus The Terminator]] | publisher = [[Dark Horse Comics]] | issue = 4 issues | date = May–August 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic | writer = [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]] | penciller=[[Steve Pugh]]| title = [[Superman vs. The Terminator: Death to the Future]] | publisher = [[Dark Horse Comics]] | issue = 4 issues | date = January–March 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, Dark Horse also published ''[[Alien versus Predator versus The Terminator]]'', where Skynet, who went dormant after Connor defeated them, has returned and are creating an [[Alien (Alien franchise)|Alien]]-Terminator hybrid.

[[Malibu Comics]] published twin series in 1995. One was a sequel to ''Terminator 2: Judgment Day'', where Sarah and John encounter two T-800s and a female T-1000. The other was a prequel exploring how Connor sent Reese and the T-800 back in time, and the creation of the T-1000 (which took its default appearance from a captive soldier). The conclusions of both series were published in one issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic | title = Terminator 2: Judgment Day – Cybernetic Dawn | publisher = [[Malibu Comics]] | date = November 1995 to February 1996, April 1996 | issue = 1–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic | title = Terminator 2: Judgement Day – Nuclear Twilight | publisher = [[Malibu Comics]] | date = November 1995 to February 1996, April 1996 | issue = 1–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Terminator: Infinity]]'' (2007) comic book series by [[Dynamite Entertainment]] (a sequel to ''Terminator 3'') depicts Connor on July 17, 2009. Kate Brewster died the year before, and he is aided by a future Terminator named Uncle Bob. They create a homing signal to bring together other human survivors, beginning the resistance. The series is also tied into another one of Dynamite's publications, Painkiller Jane, for two issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Comic book reference | writer = [[Simon Furman]] | title = [[Terminator 2: Infinity]] | publisher = [[Dynamite Entertainment]] | issue = 1–5 | date = July–November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dynamite are releasing a sequel ''Terminator: Revolution'' and at all the same time [[IDW Publishing]] are releasing a ''Salvation'' tie-in, possible because the former is based on the ''Terminator 2'' license.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=18502 Furman on Making Dynamite's Terminator Revolutionary], [[Comic Book Resources]], October 20, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Distinguished Gentleman''''' is a 1992 American [[political cinema|political]] [[comedy film]] starring [[Eddie Murphy]]. The film was directed by [[Jonathan Lynn]]. In addition to Murphy, the film stars [[Lane Smith]], [[Sheryl Lee Ralph]], [[Joe Don Baker]], [[James Garner]], [[Victoria Rowell]], [[Grant Shaud]], [[Kevin McCarthy (actor)|Kevin McCarthy]], [[Charles S. Dutton]], Victor Rivers, [[Chi McBride]], Sonny Jim Gaines, and [[Noble Willingham]].

The film's plot is centered on politics, specifically what members of Congress and lobbyists do to get what they want in Washington, D.C.

==Synopsis==
A Florida con man named Thomas Jefferson Johnson uses the passing of the longtime Congressman from his district, Jeff Johnson (who died of a heart attack while having sex with his secretary), to get elected to the [[United States Congress]] as a freshman Congressman, where the money flows from lobbyists. Omitting his first name, and abbreviating his middle name, he calls himself "Jeff" Johnson.  He then manages to get on the ballot by pitching a seniors organization, the Silver Foxes, to nominate him as their candidate for office.

Once on the election ballot, he uses the dead Congressman's old campaign material and runs a low budget campaign that appeals to name recognition, figuring most people do not pay much attention and simply vote for the "name you know."  He wins a slim victory and is off to Washington, a place where the "streets are lined with gold."

Initially, the lucrative donations and campaign contributions roll in, but as he learns the nature of the con game in Washington D.C., he starts to see how the greed and corruption makes it difficult to address issues such as campaign finance reform, environmental protection, and the possibility that electric power companies may have a product that is giving kids in a small town cancer.

In trying to address these issues, Congressman Johnson finds himself double-crossed by the Chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce|Committee on Power and Industry]], Rep. Dick Dodge. Johnson decides to fight back the only way he knows how: with a con. Johnson succeeds and exposes Dodge as corrupt. As the film ends, it appears likely that Johnson will be thrown out of Congress for the manner in which he was elected, but he defiantly declares, "I'm gonna run for [[U.S. President|President]]!" then [[breaking the fourth wall]].

The film was shot at various locations in Washington, D.C.; Los Angeles; [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]]; [[Maryland]], and [[Pasadena, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= A look inside Hollywood and the movies. : THE MURPHY FILE : Some Might Say That Fantasy Isn't Such a Bad Deal, Given the Political Realities |work= [[Los Angeles Times]]|date=1992-10-18|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1992-10-18/entertainment/ca-720_1_eddie-murphy|accessdate=2012-05-31|first=Jane|last=Galbraith}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Critical response===
''The Distinguished Gentleman'' was released in December 1992 and went on to gross approximately $47 million at the domestic [[box office]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Weekend Box Office : 'Home' Still Alone at the Top |work= [[Los Angeles Times]]|date=1992-12-08|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1992-12-08/entertainment/ca-1613_1_weekend-box-office|accessdate=2012-05-31|first=David J.|last=Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= National Video Rentals : 'Gentleman' Fends Off 'River's' Rush|work= [[Los Angeles Times]]|date=1993-06-18|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1993-06-18/entertainment/ca-4371_1_distinguished-gentleman|accessdate=2012-05-31|first=Dennis|last=Hunt}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Critical reaction to the movie however was mostly negative. [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' liked the premise and what it had going for it, but criticized it for its "slow pacing", despite it being a [[screwball comedy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19921204/REVIEWS/212040301/1023 |title=A Roger Ebert review |publisher=Rogerebert.suntimes.com |date= 1992-12-04|accessdate=2012-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Owen Gleiberman]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' called it "a sterile, joyless comedy, photographed in ugly, made-for-video close-up and featuring a farce plot so laborious it suggests [[John Landis]] on a bad day".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Owen Gleiberman |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,312631,00.html |title=Review by '&amp;#39;Entertainment Weekly'|publisher=Ew.com |date=1992-12-11 |accessdate=2012-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; eFilmCritic.com called it a "tepid Eddie Murphy political farce", and the film currently holds a 13% "Rotten" rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/distinguished_gentleman/ |title=Rotten Tomatoes reviews |publisher=Rottentomatoes.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movie won the feature film [[Environmental Media Award]] in 1993, and in 2001 the [[Political Film Society]] gave the film its special award of the year.

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plots must be between 400 and 700 words only. --&gt;
In the [[Lego]] universe, around the mid to late 2000s, populated by [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] [[Lego minifigure|minifigures]], the evil Lord Business finds a super-weapon called the "Kragle". The wizard Vitruvius attempts to stop him, but is blinded by Business's robots. Before Business leaves with the weapon, Vitruvius prophesies a person called "The Special" will find the "Piece of Resistance", a brick capable of stopping the Kragle.

Eight and a half years later, in the city of Bricksburg, construction worker Emmet Brickowski has a very "awesome" day, and pretends that everything in the whole world, even the negative things, are awesome. During after hours, he finds a woman searching for something at his construction site. When he investigates, Emmet falls into a hole and finds the Piece of Resistance. Compelled to touch it, Emmet experiences vivid visions and passes out. He awakens with the Piece of Resistance attached to his back, in the custody of Good Cop/Bad Cop, Lord Business's lieutenant.

The woman, whos name she tells him is Wyldstyle, rescues Emmet, believing him to be the Special, and takes him to meet Vitruvius in the [[Lego Wild West|Old West]]. Emmet learns Wyldstyle and Vitruvius are "Master Builders"&lt;ref name="EWKnowAllTheStuff"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Busis|first1=Hillary|title=Want to know all the stuff 'The Lego Movie' is riffing on? Here are a reference guide|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2014/02/14/lego-movie-reference-guide|accessdate=November 15, 2016|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=February 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; – people capable of building anything from their imagination without the need of instructions – who oppose Business. Wyldstyle explains that Business wants to use the Kragle (a tube of [[Cyanoacrylate|Krazy Glue]] with a weathered label) to freeze the world into perfection. Though disappointed to find Emmet is not a Master Builder, Wyldstyle and Vitruvius are convinced of his potential when he recalls visions of a seemingly human deity referred to as "The Man Upstairs".

Emmet, Wyldstyle and Vitruvius evade Bad Cop's forces with the aid of [[Batman]], Wyldstyle's boyfriend. They go to the hidden realm of [[Cloud Cuckoo Land]] to attend a council of Master Builders, all of whom are unimpressed with Emmet and refuse to fight Business. Bad Cop's forces attack, having placed a tracking device on Emmet, and capture everyone except Emmet, Wyldstyle, Batman, Vitruvius, and a small group of other Master Builders, and Cloud Cuckoo Land is destroyed. Later, Wyldstyle reveals her real name to be Lucy. Escaping, Emmet devises a plan to infiltrate Business's office tower and disarm the Kragle, but the group is captured and imprisoned in the Think Tank, where all the Master Builders are forced to make instructions. Trying to retaliate, Vitruvius is decapitated by Business, who sets a self-destruct protocol and leaves everyone to die, including Bad Cop.

As he dies, Vitruvius reveals he made up the prophecy. He soon reappears to Emmet as a ghost and reveals self-belief is what makes one the Special. Strapped to the self-destruct mechanism's battery, Emmet jumps into the abyss outside the tower and severs the connection, saving his friends. Inspired by Emmet's sacrifice, Wyldstyle rallies the Lego people across the universe to use whatever creativity they have to build machines and weapons to fight against Lord Business's forces.

Emmet finds himself in the human world as a Lego mini-figure, unable to move. The events of the story are being played out by a little boy named Finn on his father's expensive Lego set in their basement. His father, "The Man Upstairs", comes home from work and is horrified to see his son ruining the set by creating variations of different playsets, and immediately proceeds to rebuild and glue his perceived perfect creations together. Realizing the danger his friends are in, Emmet wills himself to move and gains Finn's attention.

Finn returns Emmet and the Piece of Resistance to the set, where Emmet now possesses the powers of a Master Builder and confronts Business. Meanwhile, Finn's father looks at his son's creations and realizes Finn had based the villainous Business on him and his [[perfectionism (psychology)|perfectionism]]. Through a speech Emmet gives Business, Finn's father comes to his senses and tearfully apologizes to his son, and the two unglue the constructions with [[White spirit|mineral spirits]], which plays out as Business getting finally freed from his evil nature, capping the Kragle, and thawing his victims. Emmet is hailed as a hero and begins a romantic relationship with Wyldstyle with Batman's blessing.

As a result of Finn's father allowing Finn's younger sister to join them in playing with his Lego sets, aliens from the planet [[Lego Duplo|Duplon]] beam down on the Lego world and announce their plans to destroy everyone.

===Animation===
The film is strongly inspired by the visual aesthetic and stylistics of [[Brickfilm]]s and received a great deal of praise in the respective online communities who saw the film as appraising nod to their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Einwächter|first=Sophie Gwendolyn|last2=Simon|first2=Felix M.|date=2017-09-15|title=How digital remix and fan culture helped the Lego comeback|url=http://journal.transformativeworks.org/index.php/twc/article/view/1047|journal=Transformative Works and Cultures|language=en|volume=25|issue=0|issn=1941-2258}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Brickfilm-Fans and AFOL’s (Adult Fans of Lego) praised the painstaking amount of detail in the production. Animal Logic tried to make the film's animation replicate a [[stop motion]] film even if everything was done through computer graphics, with the [[Skeletal animation|animation rigs]] following the same articulation limits actual Lego figures have. The camera systems also tried to replicate live action cinematography, including different lenses and a [[Steadicam]] simulator. The scenery was projected through The Lego Group's own [[Lego Digital Designer]], which as CG supervisor Aidan Sarsfield detailed, "uses the official LEGO Brick Library and effectively simulates the connectivity of each of the bricks." The saved files were then converted to design and animate in [[Autodesk Maya|Maya]] and [[Autodesk Softimage|XSI]]. At times the minifigures were even placed under microscopes to capture the seam lines, dirt and grime into the digital textures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fxguide.com/featured/brick-by-brick-how-animal-logic-crafted-the-lego-movie/|title=Brick-by-brick: how Animal Logic crafted The LEGO Movie|publisher=fxguide|date=February 7, 2014|accessdate=March 7, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209091156/https://www.fxguide.com/featured/brick-by-brick-how-animal-logic-crafted-the-lego-movie/|archivedate=February 9, 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benny the spaceman was based on the line of Lego space sets sold in the 1980s, and his design includes the broken helmet chin strap, a common defect of the space sets at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|department=[[Yahoo!

The film's total cost, including production, promotion and advertising (P&amp;A), was $100 million.&lt;ref name=THRCutOut /&gt; Half of the film's cost was financed by [[Village Roadshow Pictures]].&lt;ref name=THRCutOut /&gt; The rest was covered by Warner Bros., with [[RatPac-Dune Entertainment]] providing a smaller share as part of its multi-year financing agreement with Warner Bros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fleming Jr.|first1=Mike|title=Warner Bros Sets RatPac-Dune To Co-Finance Slates After Legendary Exit|url=http://deadline.com/2013/09/warner-bros-sets-ratpac-dune-to-co-finance-slates-after-legendary-exit-599835/|website=Deadline Hollywood|accessdate=October 27, 2015|date=September 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially Warner Bros. turned down Village Roadshow Pictures when it asked to invest in the film.&lt;ref name=THRCutOut /&gt; However, Warner Bros. later changed its mind, reportedly due to lack of confidence in the film, initially offering Village Roadshow Pictures the opportunity to finance 25% of the film, and later, an additional 25%.&lt;ref name=THRCutOut&gt;{{cite news|date=March 26, 2014|accessdate=April 19, 2014|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/lego-movie-2-village-roadshow-691087|title='Lego Movie' Backer Village Roadshow Cut Out of Sequel (Exclusive)|work=The Hollywood Reporter|deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140609001113/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/lego-movie-2-village-roadshow-691087|archivedate=June 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theme song===
The film's theme song, "[[Everything Is Awesome|Everything is Awesome!!!]]", has been critically praised and has undergone some close analysis. Eric Brown, writing in the ''[[International Business Times]]'', describes the song as a parody of [[fascism]], saying that the song "seems little more than an infectiously catchy parody of watered-down radio pop, right down to the faux-dubstep breakdown. There's a lot more happening under the surface, however."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/how-lego-movie-everything-awesome-parody-creeping-everyday-fascism-1555165|title=How 'The Lego Movie' And 'Everything Is Awesome' Parody Creeping Everyday Fascism|newspaper=[[International Business Times]]|date=February 13, 2014|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306162943/http://www.ibtimes.com/how-lego-movie-everything-awesome-parody-creeping-everyday-fascism-1555165|archivedate=March 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with [[Fox News]], producer [[Mark Mothersbaugh]] says the song "was supposed to be like mind control early in the film. It's totally irritating, this kind of mindless mantra to get people up and working. It's like the whip crack on their back, but then by the end of the movie it morphs into, instead of being just a mindless, go-to-work song it becomes about co-operation and people working together to do bigger things."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2014/02/18/devo-lead-singer-dishes-on-creating-catchy-lego-song/|author=Nicki Gostin|title=Devo lead singer dishes on creating catchy 'Lego' song|agency=[[Fox News]]|date=February 18, 2014|archivedate=March 4, 2014|deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304135851/http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2014/02/18/devo-lead-singer-dishes-on-creating-catchy-lego-song/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marketing===
Over twenty Lego sets inspired by scenes from the film were released for the film including a set of Collectible [[Lego Minifigures (theme)|Minifigures]]. A website was opened up so fans could make minifigure versions of themselves, and later, put that in the film's official trailer.

[[Academy Awards|Oscar]] host [[Neil Patrick Harris]] referenced ''The Lego Movie'' not being nominated [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature|Best Animated Feature]], which many critics considered a major snub, saying prior to the award's presentation "If you’re at the Oscar party with the guys who directed 'The Lego Movie,' now would be a great time to distract them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewrap.com/neil-patrick-harris-acknowledges-lego-movie-oscar-snub-ahead-of-big-hero-6-win-video/|title=Neil Patrick Harris Acknowledges 'Lego Movie' Oscar Snub Ahead of 'Big Hero 6' Win (Video)|date=February 22, 2015|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Ron Johnson (Wisconsin politician)|Ron Johnson]] criticized the film's anti-corporate message, saying that it taught children that "government is good and business is bad", citing the villain's name of Lord Business. "That's done for a reason", Johnson told [[WisPolitics.com]]. "They're starting that propaganda, and it's insidious". The comments were criticized by many, and [[Russ Feingold]] brought up the comments on the campaign trail during his [[United States Senate election in Wisconsin, 2016|2016 Senate bid]] against Johnson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2016/jun/24/russ-feingold/did-ron-johnson-call-lego-movie-anti-business-cons//|title=Ron Johnson,|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Poor Old Lady by Lorenzo Jaramillo on the 1901 edition of the book Moral Tales for Formal Children by Rafael Pombo.|The Poor Old Lady by Lorenzo Jaramillo, 1901.]]
"'''The Poor Old Lady is a [[fairy tale]], best known in [[Latin America]].  It was first published in the book ''Moral Tales for Formal Children'' in 1854 by the [[Colombian people|Colombian]] [[poet[Rafael Pombo]].  Due to the importance and impact of this play in [[Latin America]]n   children Latin American literature of the nineteenth century, "The Poor Old Lady" became one of the most memorable characters in the Colombian and Latin American childhood.  This paradoxical but amusing story is still reprinted in compilations of children stories and [[nursery rhyme]]s.

==Plot of the story==
"The Poor Old Lady" tells the story of a rich old lady who has everything (clothes, goods, food.).  However, in each verse of the story she is described as someone who complains about having nothing.  At the end, the poor old lady dies from all the alleged complications which she had.  In an ironic way the story ends with a particular phrase: “God grant that we can enjoy the poverty of that poor lady and die from the same ill.”

==Characters==
The story revolves around a unique character, the poor old lady, which is based on a commonly known social [[stereotype]].

==Commentary==
Like all tales and rhymes of [[Rafael Pombo]], "The Poor Old Lady" teaches children about everyday aspects of human beings and society.  Women and their insatiable desire to have many shoes and dresses,  and in a deeper layer this story deals with a main aspect: the human greed and exposes that material things are not the most important stuff in life.

The poor old lady explores 2 very basic human ensigns:

* ungratefulness and undermining of what she had 
* the constant see of what she lacks of. 

Negative or positive ensigns?
For many she was just a greedy lady that never noticed what she had was more than what many others had.
But we could imagine also that an old lady like her probably would have tried along her life all kind of drinks, and meals and shoes and beds and seats, which would have made of her a truly curious and exploratory person, perhaps insatiable.

| style="vertical-align: top" |&lt;poem&gt;The Poor old Lady

Once upon a time there was an old lady
With nothing to eat,
But meat, fruit, sweets,
Cakes, eggs, bread and fish.

She drank broth, chocolate,
Milk, wine, tea and coffee,
And the poor woman could not find
What to eat or what to drink.

And this old woman did not have
Not a little hut in where to live
But a large house
With its vegetables plot and its garden

No one, nobody cared for her
But Andrés and Juan Gil
And eight servants and two pages
with livery and bow-tie.

She never had anything to sit on
But chairs and sofas
With benches and cushions
And springs on the back.

Not another bed than a big one
More golden than an altar,
With soft feather mattress
A lot of silk and a lot of frills.

And this poor old lady
Every year, until her end,
She had one more year of age
And one year less to live.

And when looking herself in the mirror,
It always scared her there
Another old lady with glasses,
Little hat and a toupee.

And this poor old lady
Did not have what to dress,
But dresses of thousand styles
And of thousand and thousand fabrics.

And if not for his shoes,
Flip-flops, boots and booties,
Barefoot on the floor
was walking this wretch.

Appetite never had
When finishing eating,
Nor enjoyed complete health,
When she was unwell.

She died of wrinkle disease,
Already bent like a three,
And never complained again
Neither of hunger nor of thirst.

And this poor old lady
When she died, she left no more,
But money, jewels, lands, houses,
Eight cats and a turpial bird.

Rest in peace, and God allows
That we could enjoy
The poverty of that poor woman
And die as bad as she did.

----------------------------
La Pobre Viejecita

Érase una viejecita
Sin nadita que comer
Sino carnes, frutas, dulces,
Tortas, huevos, pan y pez

Bebía caldo, chocolate,
Leche, vino, té y café,
Y la pobre no encontraba
Qué comer ni qué beber.

Y esta vieja no tenía
Ni un ranchito en que vivir
Fuera de una casa grande
Con su huerta y su jardín

Nadie, nadie la cuidaba
Sino Andrés y Juan Gil
Y ocho criados y dos pajes
De librea y corbatín

Nunca tuvo en qué sentarse
Sino sillas y sofás
Con banquitos y cojines
Y resorte al espaldar

Ni otra cama que una grande
Más dorada que un altar,
Con colchón de blanda pluma,
Mucha seda y mucho olán.

Y esta pobre viejecita
Cada año, hasta su fin,
Tuvo un año más de vieja
Y uno menos que vivir

Y al mirarse en el espejo
La espantaba siempre allí
Otra vieja de antiparras,
Papalina y peluquín.

Y esta pobre viejecita
No tenía que vestir
Sino trajes de mil cortes
Y de telas mil y mil.

Y a no ser por sus zapatos,
Chanclas, botas y escarpín,
Descalcita por el suelo
Anduviera la infeliz

Apetito nunca tuvo
Acabando de comer,
Ni gozó salud completa
Cuando no se hallaba bien

Se murió del mal de arrugas,
Ya encorvada como un tres,
Y jamás volvió a quejarse
Ni de hambre ni de sed.

Y esta pobre viejecita
Al morir no dejó más
Que onzas, joyas, tierras, casas,
Ocho gatos y un turpial

Duerma en paz, y Dios permita
Que logremos disfrutar
Las pobrezas de esa pobre
Y morir del mismo mal&lt;/poem&gt;

|}

==Modern uses and adaptations==
The poor old lady is one of the most recognized characters of the [[Colombian culture]], and is commonly used in [[elementary school]] [[textbook]]s, [[nursery rhyme]]s, and [[Children's literature|child literature]] [[Anthology|compilation]]s.

In 1977, Fernando Laverde performed the [[Animation|animated film]] version of this story, which is considered the first animated film created in Colombia.

Representations of the character are used in [[parade]]s and [[carnival]]s.  In recent years, the theme parks Mundo Aventura and [[Colombian National Coffee Park]] have used [[animatronics]] versions of "The Poor Old Lady".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=The Walrus |url=http://thewalrus78.blogspot.com/2009/12/la-pobre-viejecita-una-rareza-del-cine.html |title=I AM THE WALRUS: La Pobre Viejecita: Una Rareza del Cine Animado Colombiano |publisher=Thewalrus78.blogspot.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bibliotecasvirtuales.com/biblioteca/literaturainfantil/Poesiainfantil/RafaelPombo/ |title=Rafael Pombo |publisher=Bibliotecasvirtuales.com |date=1999-02-22 |accessdate=2012-02-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208131539/http://www.bibliotecasvirtuales.com/biblioteca/literaturainfantil/Poesiainfantil/RafaelPombo/ |archivedate=2012-02-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.banrepcultural.org/blaavirtual/ninos/relatoi/rela3.htm |title=Rafael Pombo |publisher=banrepcultural.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6434">'''The Word and the World Project''' of the [[Stanford University]]'s [[Stanford Learning Lab|Learning Lab]] developed a large lecture, Introduction to Humanities (IHUM) course adopting pedagogical strategies and technologies designed to enhance learning. The course was given in 1997 and 1998.  The goal of the curriculum innovations was to transform a large lecture course into a learning community.  Professors: [[Larry Friedlander]] (English), [[Haun Saussy]] (East Asian Studies), and [[Tim Lenior]] (History); teaching fellows: [[Carlos Seligo]] and [[Margo Denman]] and lab staff: [[Charles Kerns]] and [[George Toye]] worked together to develop a holistic curriculum mediated through a website center for the course.

==Problems in Large Lecture Courses==
This course was developed in response to the shortcomings of earlier large lecture courses. This type of course typically rated poorly in student evaluations and often led students to behaviors that inhibited learning: students skipped lectures and did not read assignments or prepare for meetings; students crammed for exams and waited until the last minute to write papers with a focus on grades and not learning. They were passive participants in a system that did not foster active engagement. Often there was a lack of continuity between lecture and section. Students had widely varying levels of knowledge about the texts. Faculty had very little information about the students’ knowledge as the course proceeded and the students had little feedback on their performance.

==Course Design==
The curriculum was based on the reading of five texts, [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], [[Blade Runner]], [[Hamlet]], [[Descartes]]' [[Meditations on First Philosophy|Meditations]], from the viewpoint of the scholar of history, literature, or philosophy. The course emphasized methods of reading and critical and interpretive approaches, rather than content.
 
This first year course met weekly in two one-hour lectures for all 100 students and two one-hour discussion section meetings of 15 students each. Students and instructors engaged in web activities including structured reading assignments and asynchronous discussion forums. The web site provided rich resources to supplement the texts. Students worked cross-section group projects and on panel discussions.  There was no final exam for the course; a fair was held in which students exhibited their project web sites.

==Technology==
[[File:WWAnnouncements.png|thumb|Course Web Site Home Page with Announcements]]
*Central Course Web Site
A site that had a calendar, announcements, faculty bios, the asynchronous discussion forums, assignments, and student projects

[[File:WWGenesis maps.png|thumb|Web Site Genesis Material]]
*Rich Web Resources
The course web site linked rich resources supporting each text to engage students from novices to those well-informed on the texts. It included explanatory information, annotations, cultural information, critical analyses, visual interpretations of the texts including paintings, video recordings of multiple performances, and different cuts of the films.

[[File:WWHamletAssignment answers.png|thumb|Web Reading Assignment]]
*Structured Readings
The web site also had a series of on-line assignments that structured the learners’ reading activities. These on-line activities drew upon the students’ previous knowledge and guided them as they approached each text. In the first year of the project in 1997 students responses were recorded in a personal on-line, shareable portfolio, but after noting little use of the portfolio, the design was changed in the second iteration of the course in 1998 so that assignments were displayed directly in the discussion Forum.

* The Forum 
The Forum had special features to support large lecture courses such as photographs of the posting student next to his/her message, organization into sections, and notification systems to alert faculty and groups to special postings. The forum was used to discuss lectures; it was where assignments were posted (they were not sent to an instructor); and was used for communication in forming project groups.The Forum was enhanced in the second year to allow direct linkage to assignments, faculty-controlled subject organization, and threaded discussion.

* Student Project Web Sites 
The students in the course completed projects in the second half of the course that demonstrated their understanding of the texts. Projects were constructed in many media the first year but were limited to posters and web sites in the second. Faculty met often with students helping them to plan their projects. All projects from the previous year were available as models when the course was repeated.

* Evaluation
The project employed several modes of project and technology evaluation: questionnaires, interviews, video interaction analysis, peer review, and ethnographic studies. Findings:

-The Forum provided a venue for discussion by quiet students and accommodated different learning styles.
-The Forum and assignments helped students prepare for face-to-face meetings by discussing basic issues before class. 
-It added to workload of teaching staff.
-There was a positive correlation between scores on papers and number of Forum postings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="84020">Because the country contains two major language groups and numerous other linguistic minorities, in Canada '''[[Official bilingualism in Canada|official languages policy]]''' has always been an important and high-profile area of public policy.

In an exhaustive 1971 study of Canadian language law prepared for the [[Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism]], [[Claude-Armand Sheppard]] offered this definition for the term “official language”: “[An] official language is a language in which all or some of the public affairs of a particular definition are, or can be, conducted, either by law or custom. We take public affairs to comprise the parliamentary and legislative process, administrative regulations, the rendering of justice, all quasi-judicial activities, and the overall day-to-day administration.”&lt;ref&gt;Sheppard, Claude-Armand, ''The Law of Languages in Canada''. Studies of the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism, no. 11. Ottawa: Information Canada, 1971, p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt;

This article lists key events in the evolution of language policy in Canada since 1710, when the French-speaking population of [[Acadia]] first came under British administration. The timeline covers the policies of the colonial predecessors to the current Canadian state, and the policies of Canada's provinces and territories. The policies listed include:
* ''' Legislative changes ''' including constitutional amendments, acts of Parliament, and Orders in Council;
* ''' Major policy announcements ''' including abortive policy proposals that were never implemented;
* ''' Key administrative initiatives ''' governing the implementation of major policies;
* ''' Court decisions ''' relating to Canada's language laws.

These policy changes have been important to the extent that they affected the lives of individual Canadians. Therefore, in order to give some idea of the relative importance of various policies over the centuries, population statistics for Canada’s different language groups are included where such information is available.

== General themes in official languages policy ==
Official languages policies, in one form or another, have been in existence since the beginning of the [[European colonization of North America]].  In the early years, [[French language|French]] was the sole language used in [[France's North American colonial possessions]], [[English language|English]] had been the sole language of [[Britain's colonies in the New World]].  The [[First Nations in Canada|First Nations]] continued to use their [[indigenous languages]] in their own affairs.  There were a limited number of people who knew both a European and a native North American language, often [[Christian missionaries]] the “black robes” and the children of natives they ministered to.  These bilinguals were called on in diplomacy, but otherwise the linguistic worlds of the settlers and the natives were largely separate.  Without being fluent, natives and settlers often learned very rudimentary forms of each other’s languages called “pidgins”.  Pidgins, such as the [[Algonquian–Basque pidgin]], [[Labrador Inuit Pidgin French]], [[American Indian Pidgin English]], and [[Pidgin Delaware]] were initially important languages of trade and diplomacy, but none of them was ever prestigious enough to be used in any other governmental context.

The need for a considered language policy came with the absorption New France into the British Empire.  This began with the [[British occupation of Acadia]] in 1710 followed by the [[conquest of Canada]] in 1759.  Britain was then ruling over a large population of non-English speaking white settlers.  
In what is now the eastern half of the country, some sort of accommodation was made for French during the long period of British colonial rule that followed, but at no point did the language achieve full legal and practical equality with English. The public reaction to this situation was one of the sources of the political instability that led to [[constitutional history of Canada|the adoption of a series of constitutions]], culminating in the [[Canadian Confederation|adoption of a federal structure in 1867]] as a way of allowing the two languages to have different levels of official status in different provinces.

Following [[Confederation]] in 1867, French and English were treated as being fully equal within Quebec, in all matters under provincial jurisdiction. In matters under federal jurisdiction, English occupied a ''de facto'' privileged position, and French was not fully equal, although it did enjoy some constitutionally protected privileges. In other provinces, French was sometimes tolerated and sometimes actively suppressed.  Other settler languages, such as [[Canadian Gaelic|Scottish Gaelic]], [[Newfoundland Irish|Irish]], and [[German in Canada|German]] were ignored in politics and increasingly suppressed with adoption of [[universal public education]].

Aboriginal languages, which earlier Christian missionaries had studied and helped to document, came under sustained attack by [[Canadian Indian residential school system|a system of state-sponsored church-run residential schools]] beginning in the 1840s in the east and later extending across the country.  These schools were part of a deliberate policy to suppress or eliminate indigenous languages in favour of English.
Over the course of the Twentieth and early Twenty-first centuries, the two predominant settler languages, English and French, have gradually achieved a greater level of equality in most of Canada's provinces, and full equality at the federal level. The trend has been very different in Quebec, however, where in the 1970s English was formally deprived of its status of full legal equality. Today, French is, both ''de facto'' and ''de jure'', the sole official language of Quebec.

Also since the 1960s and the adoption of the policy of [[Official multiculturalism in Canada]], teaching of other languages besides English and French, not only as a separate subject but as the medium of instruction, has expanded dramatically, beginning primarily with European languages, notably [[Canadian Ukrainian|Ukrainian]], the policy changes at the provincial level have seen a boom in schools catering to a variety of language groups.  For example, in Edmonton, Alberta in 2015 the Catholic school board offered full immersion in French, "bilingual programs" (one third to one half time immersion) in Polish, Spanish, and Ukrainian, and part-time language and culture programs in Filipino, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, and Nehiyaw Pimatisiwin (Cree).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ecsd.net/Programs/Overview/LanguagePrograms/Pages/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, the public school board offered American Sign Language Bilingual, Arabic Bilingual, Chinese (Mandarin) Bilingual, French Immersion, Late French Immersion, German Bilingual, Hebrew Bilingual, International Spanish Academy, Ukrainian International Bilingual, and Awasis (Cree) programs.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.epsb.ca/programs/language/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Official languages policy and legislation relating to the Province of Canada (1840-1867) and the Dominion of Canada (1867-present) ==
{{Expand list|date=April 2018}}
* ''' 1840: ''' The ''[[Act of Union 1840|Act of Union]]'' is adopted. Section 41 of the Act bans the French language from Parliament and Courts of the new united [[Province of Canada]].
* ''' 1841: ''' At the first meeting of the [[Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada]], [[Austin Cuvillier]], a French-Canadian, is elected as the first Speaker.  As well, the new Parliament adopts rules of order. Rule 29 provides for the translation of papers into French. Rule 38 provides for the reading of motions in both French and English.&lt;ref&gt;Standing Rules and Regulations of the Legislative Assembly of Canada (Kingston, 1841).&lt;/ref&gt; 
* ''' 1841: ''' The Parliament of the Province of Canada adopts ''An Act to provide for the translation into the French Language of the Laws of the Province'', which ensures that a non-official copy of all Canadian laws will be "distributed among the People of this Province speaking the French language, in the same manner in which the English text of the said Laws shall be printed and distributed among those speaking the English language...."
* ''' 1848: ''' Article 41 of the ''Act of Union''  is amended. In a return to the situation that had existed from 1792 to 1837 in Lower Canada, it is once again legal to use the French language in the Parliament and in the Courts.
* ''' 1857: ''' Section 15 of the ''Act respecting the Codification of the Laws of Lower Canada relative to Civil Matters and Procedure'' requires that the [[Civil Code of Lower Canada]] be printed only in bilingual form, with English and French displayed on the same page: “[T]he two texts, when printed, shall stand side by side.” Side-by-side publication is a first step towards the adoption of the "[[Equal Authenticity Rule]]" for interpreting bilingual statutes.&lt;ref name="Source 2008"&gt;It has even been suggested that this section is "best understood as a non-verbal legislative sign that the two texts should be interpreted dialogically." Source: Michel Bastarache, Naiomi Metallic, Regan Morris and Christopher Essert, ''The Law of Bilingual Interpretation''. Toronto: LexisNexis, 2008, p. vi.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''' 1867: ''' Section 133 of the ''[[British North America Act, 1867]]'' (later renamed the ''Constitution Act, 1867'') decrees that "The Acts of the Parliament of Canada and of the Legislature of Quebec shall be printed and published in both those Languages [ie. in both English and French]", and also mandates the use of both French and English for parliamentary debates, parliamentary publications, and federal court cases.
* '''1935:''' ''[[R. v. DuBois]]'': The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] applies the rule of judicial interpretation that will come to be known as the “[[Equal Authenticity Rule]]” to Acts of Parliament. This rule of interpretation holds that section 133 of the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]'' requires courts to treat “both [the English and French] versions of statutes [as] equally valid and authoritative interpretations of the law,”&lt;ref name="Michel Bastarache 2008, p. 17"&gt;This definition of the equal authenticity rule is from Michel Bastarache, Naiomi Metallic, Regan Morris and Christopher Essert, ''The Law of Bilingual Interpretation''. Markham, Ontario: LexisNexis, 2008, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; even if the statute in question was clearly drafted in one language and translated into the other, and even if the two versions of the law are incompatible.  This rule had been applied to Quebec legislation since 1891, as a consequence of the court’s ruling in ''[[CPR v. Robinson]]''.
* '''1959:''' The Conservative government of [[John Diefenbaker]] introduces [[simultaneous interpretation]] in the House of Commons. Prior to this, the right to use English or French in Parliament had been guaranteed, but unilingual MPs had been unable to understand each other's speeches.

* '''1964:''' The first language school for Public Servants opens.
* ''' 1964:''' A [[private member's bill]], initiated by Liberal backbencher [[Jean Chrétien]], gives Canada's state-owned airline, [[Trans-Canada Air Lines]], the new bilingual name "[[Air Canada]]," starting a trend of giving bilingual names to federal institutions which formerly had borne English-only names.
* '''1968:''' From this date forward, statutes of Canada are printed with the English and French texts of the law side by side, rather than in separate volumes. This "allows for a first-hand comparison of both texts...."&lt;ref&gt;The full quotation is: The province of Quebec even prints both texts in the same volume opposite each other on the page. This, of course, allows for a first-hand comparison of both texts, something not possible at present with federal statutes." Ironically, these words, which were written before 1968, were not published until 1971, after the problem to which they referred had been corrected. See Claude-Armand Sheppard, ''The Law of Languages in Canada'', p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; Side-by-side publication is an indication of the internalization, within the Canadian parliament, of the "Equal Authenticity Rule".
* ''' 1969: ''' The Liberal government of [[Pierre Trudeau]] enacts the ''[[Official Languages Act (Canada)|Official Languages Act]]''.
* '''1970:''' The Secretary of State (the future [[Department of Canadian Heritage]]) establishes the Official Languages in Education Program to supervise financial transfers from Ottawa to the provinces and territories to promote two objectives: First, to promote second-language training in public schools across Canada with the goal of promoting an increase in personal bilingualism; and second, to financially promote education for the linguistic minority of the province (English in Quebec, French elsewhere).
* ''' 1973: ''' Parliament passes a ''Resolution on Official Languages in the Public Service'' confirming the right of civil servants to work in the official language of their choice.
* ''' 1974: ''' ''[[Jones v. Attorney General of New Brunswick]]'': The Supreme Court of Canada rejects the argument of [[Moncton]] mayor [[Leonard Jones]] that the ''Official Languages Act'' is unconstitutional because it deals with subject matter outside the jurisdiction of the federal government.
* ''' 1974: '''  The ''Consumer Packaging and Labelling Act'' requires the use of both French and English on all consumer packaging across the country; bilingual packaging remains one of the most visible aspects of bilingualism for the Canadian general public resulting in this aspect of bilingualism sometimes being termed "cereal box bilingualism".
* ''' 1978: ''' The ''[[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]]'' is amended to give accused persons the right to be heard by a judge (a judge and jury, in the event of a jury trial) who speaks the official language of the accused.
* ''' 1986: ''' ''[[Société des Acadiens v. Association of Parents]]'': The Supreme Court of Canada rules that the right of the accused, under section 19 of the Charter of Rights, to use English or French in a trial, does not guarantee the right to be heard by a judge who speaks the defendant’s preferred language. This decision is reversed in 1999, in [[R. v. Beaulac]].
* ''' 1988: ''' A second version of the ''Official Languages Act'' is introduced, taking into account the new requirements of the ''Charter of Rights''.
* '''1988:''' The Conservative government of Brian Mulroney enacts the ''Air Canada Public Participation Act'', which allows for the state-owned airline to be privatized, but which also provides that, even as a private company, [[Air Canada]] will be required to operate in conformity with the ''Official Languages Act'', precisely as it had done when it was government-owned.&lt;ref&gt;Section 10 of the ''Air Canada Public Participation Act'' reads, ''inter alia'': "The ''Official Languages Act'' applies to the [privatized] corporation."&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Air Canada will restructure, spinning off a number of independent companies, including [[Jazz Airlines]]. Because these new entities are not part of Air Canada, they are no longer subject to the terms of the ''Air Canada Public Participation Act,'' and hence cease to be obligated to adhere to the practices of the ''Official Languages Act.''
* ''' 1989: ''' ''[[Saulnier v. The Queen]]'': A Nova Scotia county court rules that under section 20 of the Charter of Rights, a federal government department cannot simply presume that there is no need for French –language services, particularly where French-speakers might face penalties for failing to comply with laws of which they could not be fully aware unless these had been explained to them in their own language.
* ''' 1993: ''' ''[[Professional Institute of the Public Service v. the Queen]]'': The Federal Court of Canada rules that sections 32 and 33 of the ''Official Languages Act'' impose a positive burden upon the federal government not only to react or respond to pressures for more or better bilingual services, but to initiate programmes to those serves where there is a perceived need for them.
* ''' 1993: ''' ''[[R. v. Haché]]'': The New Brunswick Court of Appeal rules that the government is not under a positive obligation to inform people that they have a right to services in their own language.

== Official languages policy and legislation relating to the provinces and territories ==

===Laws and policies applicable to all provinces and territories ===
* '''1917:''' ''[[Ottawa Separate Schools Trustees v. Mackell]]'': The [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] rules that section 93 of the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]'' provides guarantees only of religious education, not of the language in which that education will take place. In consequence of this ruling, French-speaking minorities in Ontario and elsewhere are not able to use section 93 in order to force provincial governments to permit francophone students to be educated in French. Although the ruling applies in theory to all provinces, it has no practical impact on Quebec, where the provincial government continues, for several more decades to provide full access to English-language schooling to all students whose parents want it.
* ''' 1982: ''' The ''[[Constitution Act, 1982]]'' requires provinces and territories, under [[Section Twenty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 23]], to make education available in both official languages where numbers warrant.
* ''' 1990: ''' ''[[Mahe v. Alberta]]'': The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] rules that section 23 guarantees a "sliding scale."  In certain circumstances, the children whose parents could exercise the right might be so few that literally no minority language education may be provided by the government.  With a greater number of children, some schools might be required to provide classrooms in which the children could receive minority language education.  An even greater number would require the construction of new schools dedicated solely to minority language education.
* ''' 2000: ''' ''[[Arsenault-Cameron v. Prince Edward Island]]'': The Supreme Court of Canada applies a [[Purposive theory|purposive interpretation]] to section 23, ruling that the purpose of this section is to redress past injustices and provide "an official language minority with equal access to high quality education in its own language in circumstances where community development will be enhanced."
* ''' 2003: ''' ''[[Doucet-Boudreau v. Nova Scotia (Minister of Education)]]'' The Supreme Court of Canada again expands the scope of section 23 by determining that the right of parents belonging to official-language minorities to have their children educated in their mother tongue is a [[positive right]] requires governments to act in a timely fashion to provide minority language programs and/or facilities, and may require the judiciary to order affirmative remedies to secure these rights. The court rules that it was therefore legitimate for a lower-court judge to require the provincial government to report to him periodically on the construction of French-language schools that had been proceeding more slowly than he had deemed permissible.
* ''' 2008: ''' ''[[Société des Acadiens et Acadiennes du Nouveau-Brunswick Inc v Canada]]'': The Supreme Court of Canada rules that agencies which are not organs of a provincial government, but which provide a service on behalf of that province, are under the same obligation to provide bilingual services that would exist if the agency was an integral part of the provincial government. This ruling occurred in the context of a traffic ticket issued by the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]], by an officer who could not speak French, to a Francophone driver; policing is a provincial government function, and in New Brunswick all persons have a right to receive this government service in both official languages. The court ruled that the fact that policing had been contracted out (to a federal government agency) did not void this right. This decision is a virtual twin to the Federal Court of Appeal's 2006 ruling, regarding services provided on behalf of the federal government, in ''Desrochers v. Canada (Industry).''

===[[Alberta]] ===
''For events prior to the creation of the province 1905, see [[#Northwest Territories|Northwest Territories]]''

* ''' 1905: ''' Under the provisions of the ''[[Alberta Act]]'', the new province of Alberta is carved out of the Northwest Territories. Section 16 of the ''Alberta Act'' calls for the continuation within the new province of all existing Northwest Territories legislation. Therefore, because the Northwest Territories legislature had voted in 1892 to make that English the only official language for that territory, Alberta comes into existence as an officially unilingual jurisdiction.
* '''1988:''' ''[[R. v. Mercure]]''. The Supreme Court of Canada rules that Saskatchewan is legally obligated to enact all laws in both French and English, but that this obligation may be altered or repealed by a 'clear legislative pronouncement' of the provincial legislature. Because Alberta and Saskatchewan came into being at the same time, and as the result of nearly identical federal laws, this ruling is seen as having equal application to Alberta.
* ''' 1988: ''' In response to the Supreme Court ruling in ''R. v. Mercure'', the legislature enacts the ''Languages Act'', which provides that any provincial laws or regulations may be enacted in English only.
* ''' 2009: ''' ''[[R. v. Caron]]'': The [[Alberta Court of Queen's Bench]] rules that the Royal Proclamation of 1869, which transferred [[Rupert's Land]] and the [[North-Western Territory]] to Canada, did not have "the effect of constitutionalizing language rights in the remaining territories [i.e. outside the Red River Colony which forms the core area of Manitoba].... Accordingly, when the Canadian Parliament created the Province of Alberta and established its constitution in 1905, there was no constitutional condition requiring it to include in the Province's constitution an obligation to publish provincial legislation in English and French."&lt;ref&gt;''R. v. Caron,'' 2009 ABQB 745, at para. 283.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that Alberta laws enacted in English only are still valid. The case is currently under appeal before the [[Alberta Court of Appeal]].

===[[British Columbia]] ===
* ''' 1849: ''' The Crown Colony of [[Colony of Vancouver Island|Vancouver Island]] is established by an Act of the Imperial Parliament. As with the prior establishment of colonies in the Maritimes, the domestic laws of England are extended to the new colony. This means that, as in England, English is the only official language of the new colony.&lt;ref&gt;Sheppard, Claude-Armand, ''The Law of Languages in Canada''. Studies of the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism, no. 11. Ottawa: Information Canada, 1971, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''' 1858: ''' The Crown Colony of [[Colony of British Columbia|British Columbia]] is established by an Act of the Imperial Parliament. The template provision used for the Vancouver Island colony is again used: domestic English law is applied to the new colony, which therefore has English as its only official language.&lt;ref&gt;Sheppard, Claude-Armand, ''The Law of Languages in Canada''. Studies of the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism, no. 11. Ottawa: Information Canada, 1971, pp. 91-92.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''' 1865: ''' British Columbia and Vancouver’s Island are merged into a single colony. English remains the only official language.
* ''' 1871: ''' The Crown Colony of British Columbia becomes a Canadian province. English remains the only official language in matters of provincial jurisdiction.

===[[Manitoba]] ===
* ''' 1845:''' The [[Council of Assiniboia]] agrees to promulgate all laws in both French and English. Given the small size of the colony and the limited literacy of the population, promulgation consists of distributing bilingual copies of all ordinances be put on public display at the courthouse, distributed to all Protestant and Catholic clergy, “and, lastly, that copies, in both languages, be read aloud and explained at meetings of the General Court in November and February of each year....”&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in E.H. Oliver, ''The Canadian North-West: Its Early Development and Legislative Records'', Ottawa: Publications of the Canadian Archives, (no. 9, 2 volumes), 1914-15, vol. I, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''' 1849:''' The Council of Assiniboia  agrees to henceforth conduct all judicial proceedings in both English and French. According to Claude-Armand Sheppard, this event “marked the beginning of bilingualism in the courts of Assiniboia.” .&lt;ref&gt;Sheppard, Claude-Armand, ''The Law of Languages in Canada''. Studies of the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism, no. 11. Ottawa: Information Canada, 1971, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''' 1869:''' The provisional government of [[Louis Riel]] issues a list of fourteen rights which it regards as necessary for the future permanent government of the region. Items 10 and 11 relate to official languages:
:: “10. That the English and French languages be common in the Legislature and Courts, and that all public documents and Acts of the Legislature be published in both languages.”
::”11. That the Judge of the Supreme Court speak the English and French languages....”&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in L.H. Thomas, ''The Struggle for Responsible Government in the North-West Territories, 1870-97'' Toronto, 1956, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''' 1870:''' The ''[[Manitoba Act]]'' establishes the new province of Manitoba. The Act serves as a ''de facto'' provincial constitution. Under section 22 of the Act, denominational schools on the model used in Quebec are to be established in the province. Section 23 of the Act uses the model established in 1867 for Quebec for Manitoba’s provincial legislature, which must conduct its debates and enact all laws and journals in both English and French.
* ''' 1890: ''' The [[Manitoba Schools Question|''Manitoba Schools Act'']] removes funding for Catholic schools (which in practice meant all French-language schools).
* ''' 1890: ''' The legislature enacts ''An Act to Provide that the English Language shall be the Official Language of the Province of Manitoba'' (better-known as the ''Official Language Act'' abolishes French as an official language of the legislature and requires that only English be used in Manitoba courts.
* ''' 1892: ''' ''Pellant v. Hebert'': The recently enacted law establishing English as the only official language of the province is found to be ''[[ultra vires]]'' (and therefore unconstitutional) by the St. Boniface County Court. The provincial government simply ignores this decision, as well as a parallel 1909 decision of the same court (''Bertrand v. Dussault'') which also finds the law to be ''ultra vires''.&lt;ref&gt;For further details, see Warren J. Newman, "Defining the 'Constitution of Canada' since 1982: the Scope of the Legislative Powers of Constitutional Amendment under Sections 44 and 45 of the Constitution Act, 1982," in ''Supreme Court Law Review'', vol. 22 (2003), p. 445.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''' 1896: ''' ''The Laurier-Greenway Compromise'': Catholic education is permitted in public schools, and French may be used in teaching, but only on a school-by-school basis and only when there is a minimum of 10 French-speaking pupils. A Catholic school board is re-established, but without government funding.
* ''' 1900: ''' The provincial legislature amends the electoral law to permit qualified electors to vote as long as they are literate in English, French, German, Icelandic or any other Scandinavian language.&lt;ref&gt;"An Act respecting the Election of Members of the Legislative Assembly," Statutes of Manitoba 1900, 63-64 Victoria, c.8, s. 2. From one perspective, this can be seen as a positive early example of Canadian multiculturalism. The opposite point of view, however, is expressed by Claude-Armand Sheppard, who writes, “Thus, by 1900, French, which ten years before had still been one of Manitoba’s official languages, was reduced in the eyes of the Manitoba Assembly to the level of German, Icelandic or any Scandinavian language.” See Claude-Armand Sheppard, ''The Law of Languages in Canada''. Studies of the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism, no. 11. Ottawa: Information Canada, 1971, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''' 1916: ''' ''The Laurier-Greenway Compromise'' of 1896 is rescinded by the Liberal government of [[Tobias Norris]] and French instruction is abolished.
* ''' 1916: ''' ''Dumas v. Baribault'': In this case, a court is asked to overturn the decision of a [[prothonotary]] who had rejected a statement of claim on the basis that it was written in French only. In practice, therefore, the case tests the legal status of French in judicial proceedings in Manitoba. The court refuses to issue a [[writ of mandamus]], thereby upholding the province’s 1890 ''Official Language Act''.&lt;ref&gt;For further information see George Weir, “The Evolution of Separate School Law in the Prairie Provinces”, p. 47; and Claude-Armand Sheppard, ''The Law of Languages in Canada''. Studies of the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism, no. 11. Ottawa: Information Canada, 1971, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''1955:''' The provincial government permits instruction in French from grade four to grade 12 in certain schools.
* ''' 1966: ''' The first of two amendments to the provincial ''Public Schools Act'' (the second taking place in 1970) reintroduce French-language instruction.
* ''' 1979: ''' ''Manitoba (Attorney General) v. Forest'': The Supreme Court of Canada rules that the ''Official Language Act'' of 1890 is ''[[ultra vires]]''.
* ''' 1983: ''' On October 5, Parliament unanimously passes a resolution asking the Manitoba legislature to enact a proposed constitutional amendment which would have made French an official language of Manitoba and ensured that under certain circumstances, provincial government services would be offered in French. Another resolution on Manitoba Francophones is passed on Feb. 24, 1984. Ultimately, the legislature fails to enact the proposed amendment, and the federal government responds by referring the question of the constitutional validity of Manitoba's ''Official Language Act'' to the Supreme Court of Canada.
* ''' 1985:''' ''[[Reference re Manitoba Language Rights]]'': The Supreme Court of Canada rules that the provincial government acted unconstitutionally in enacting its laws in English only from 1890 onwards. The province is given a limited time in which to re-enact its laws in French. At the end of this period, any law that has not been enacted in a French version will be of no force or effect.
*'''1986:''' ''[[Bilodeau v. Attorney General of Manitoba]]'': The Supreme Court of Canada rules that the use of French on government documents such as parking tickets is not mandated by section 133 of the ''Constitution Act, 1867.''
* '''1999:''' The French Language Services Policy is adopted, with the intention of providing comparable levels of provincial government services in both official languages, including public utilities and health services, official documents such as parking tickets and court summonses, availability of translation at court and commission hearings, and bilingual government web sites.

===[[New Brunswick]] ===
''For events prior to the creation of the colony in 1784, see [[#Nova Scotia|Nova Scotia]]''

* ''' 1784-1867: ''' In 1784 the colony of New Brunswick is created out of territory formerly belonging to Nova Scotia. “By virtue of custom and usage as well as the importation of English law into New Brunswick, English law [becomes] and [remains] the official tongue of that province. Before Confederation there were no legal statutes whatever governing language rights.”&lt;ref&gt;Sheppard, Claude-Armand, ''The Law of Languages in Canada''. Studies of the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism, no. 11. Ottawa: Information Canada, 1971, pp. 7-8.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in practice French is used as a language of schooling in Acadian communities (provided by the Catholic Church), and court cases are conducted in French in certain New Brunswick jurisdictions.  When French-language schooling is eventually regulated in the 1870s, the province greatly limits the use of French. But French continues to be used informally in the courts until the practice is formalized in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Sheppard, Claude-Armand, ''The Law of Languages in Canada''. Studies of the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism, no. 11. Ottawa: Information Canada, 1971, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1871: ''' The legislature enacts the ''[[Common Schools Act of 1871|Common Schools Act]]'', ending the province's separate Catholic school system-and therefore limiting the availability of French-language schooling in the province. French language instruction is permitted only until Grade Three.
* '''1875:''' The provincial government relents slightly, permitting the use of some French translations of English texts in the classroom.
* '''1878:''' The provincial government allows francophone teachers to be trained at the provincial [[normal school]].
* '''1928:''' The Conservative government of Premier [[John Babington Macaulay Baxter|JBM Baxter]] proposes ''Regulation 32'', which would have allowed local school boards to adopt a bilingual programme. The proposal meets with strong anglophone opposition, and is withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Thorburn, ''Politics of New Brunswick''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1961, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1966:''' The Liberal government of [[Louis Robichaud]] amends the ''Schools Act'' to permit all francophone and anglophone primary-school students to receive instruction in their mother tongue.
* '''1967:''' The ''New Brunswick Schools Act'' is enacted by the Liberal government of [[Louis Robichaud]] in an "attempt...to equalize francophone and anglophone education by centralizing the administration of the school system.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Steele, ''Can Bilingualism Work? Attitudes Toward Language Policy in New Brunswick: The 1985 Public Hearings into the Poirier-Bastarache Report.'' Fredericton: New Ireland Press, 1990, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; The new law replaces the previous 422 school boards with 33 district school boards, and turned the funding for these schools over to the provincial Department of Education. Under the terms of the 1943 ''County Schools Finance Act'', each school had had its own school board, and funding had come from solely from county governments. The francophone population, which at the time was concentrated in poorer rural areas, had therefore been at a perpetual educational disadvantage.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1968:''' The opposition Progressive Conservatives, led by future premier [[Richard Hatfield]], propose a motion in the legislature to recognize the equality of the French language. This motion is defeated by Premier Robichaud's Liberal majority.&lt;ref&gt;This incident is described in Catherine Steele, ''Can Bilingualism Work? Attitudes Toward Language Policy in New Brunswick: The 1985 Public Hearings Into the Poirier-Bastarache Report.'' Fredericton: New Ireland Press, 1990, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1968:''' ''R. v. Murphy'': The New Brunswick Court of Appeal rules that a 1731 statute of the United Kingdom parliament, abolishing the use of French in that country's courts, was incorporated into New Brunswick law at the time that the colony was created, meaning that only English may be used in the province's courts.&lt;ref&gt;Citation: 69 D.L.R. (2d) 530, 5 C.R.N.S. 65, C.C.C. 229 (NB C.A.). This decision was never appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, because the Supreme Court ruled, in ''[[Jones v. Attorney General of New Brunswick]]'', that the substantive right in question in the ''Murphy'' decision (the right to use French in New Brunswick courts) had been guaranteed by a provincial statute (the ''Evidence Act.'') The lack of a Supreme Court ruling on the subject means that there is an unresolved dispute as to whether the New Brunswick Court of Appeal had wrongly decided the case. The argument that the case was wrongly decided is presented in Robert Kerr, "''R. v. Murphy'' and Language Rights Legislation" (1970), ''University of New Brunswick Law Journal'', vol. 20, at p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''' 1969: ''' The Liberal government of [[Louis Robichaud]] enacts the ''[[Official Languages of New Brunswick Act]]''.
* '''1973:''' Release of the report of the Department of Education's Task Force on Social Development (better known at the time as the "MacLeod-Pinet Report", recommending that francophones be given control of their own educational institutions by dividing the Department of Education into two sections along linguistic lines, with a deputy minister for each of the two systems, both of whom would report to the same minister of education. This recommendation is adopted in 1974 by the Conservative government of [[Richard Hatfield]].
* '''1979:''' Release of the report of the Commission on the Organization and Boundaries of School Districts in New Brunswick (better known at the time as the "Finn-Elliott Report") calling for the abolition of bilingual schools because they lead to the assimilation of francophone students, and their replacement by "homogenous schools" in which all student will be educated in their mother tongue. This becomes the basis upon which the provincial school system is later reorganized, and eventually constitutionally entrenched by means of [[Section 16.1 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 16.1 of Canada's ''Charter of Rights'']].
* ''' 1981: ''' The Progressive Conservative government of [[Richard Hatfield]] enacts ''[[Bill 88|An Act Recognizing the Equality of the Two Official Linguistic Communities in New Brunswick]]'' (better known at the time as "Bill 88").
* '''1982:''' Release of the "Poirier-Bastarache Report" (officially titled, ''Towards Equality of Official Languages in New Brunswick''). The report, which had been commissioned by Premier Hatfield in 1980 to make suggestions as to how best to update the 1969 ''Official Languages of New Brunswick Act'', sets out 96 recommendations, which turn out to be sufficiently controversial that two years later, a special Advisory Committee is set up to conduct public hearings into the recommendations.
* ''' 1993: ''' [[Section 16.1 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 16.1]] is added to Canada's [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|''Charter of Rights'']],  entrenching "the right to distinct [i.e. separate] educational institutions [for the province's] English-speaking and French-speaking communities] and such distinct cultural institutions as are necessary for the preservation and promotion of those communities."

* ''' 2005: ''' ''[[Charlebois v. Saint John (City)]]'': The Supreme Court of Canada rules that it is not necessary, under the terms of the province’s ''Official Languages Act'', for New Brunswick municipalities which have not been designated bilingual by the provincial government to nevertheless operate in both official languages. Had the court ruled that municipalities were institutions of the province, they would have fallen under the province’s legal obligation to operate in both official languages. Instead, the court holds that municipalities are incorporated entities and therefore not “institutions” of the province.

===[[Northwest Territories]] ===
*''' 1873-1876: '''  In the absence of federal legislation dealing with language, the Territorial Council makes provision for all laws and ordinances to be published in English, French and Cree, and in practice allows the courts to operate in both English and French. Therefore, “in the period prior to the separate political existence of the Northwest Territories [as enacted by Parliament in 1875 and effected in 1876], there was a rudimentary and unofficial bilingualism....”&lt;ref&gt;Claude-Armand Sheppard, ''The Law of Languages in Canada''. Studies of the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism, no. 11. Ottawa: Information Canada, 1971, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''' 1875: ''' Parliament enacts the ''Northwest Territories Act'', which goes into effect in 1876. This law creates uncertainty regarding the legal status of languages in the Territorial Council and courts, because it contains no provisions dealing with language.
*''' 1877: '''  The Parliament of Canada amends the ''Northwest Territories Act'' to include the following provision:
{{cquote|Either the English or the French language may be used by any person in the debates of the said [Territorial] Council, and in the proceedings before the Courts, and both of those languages shall be used in the records and journals of the said Council, and the ordinances of the said Council shall be printed in both those languages.}} 
:When legislation is drawn up in 1880 to permit the creation of a Territorial Assembly, Parliament amends the law slightly to permit the use of both languages in the new Assembly as well.
:At this time, the Territory includes the landmass that today makes up the provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta, parts of Manitoba, all of what today is the Yukon Territory, and the parts of Nunavut and the present-day Northwest Territories that are part of the North American mainland. In 1877 most of the population of this vast region consists of aboriginals who speak neither English nor French and have little or no contact with the government, but in the settled areas in the south, the Territory has a population of 3,104 English-speakers and 2,896 French-speakers.&lt;ref&gt;Claude-Armand Sheppard, ''The Law of Languages in Canada''. Studies of the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism, no. 11. Ottawa: Information Canada, 1971, pp. 82-83.&lt;/ref&gt;

*''' 1891: ''' Following a high-profile campaign by independent MP [[Dalton McCarthy|D’Alton McCarthy]] to use federal legislation to abolish the official status of French in the Northwest Territories, a compromise bill, ''An Act to Amend the Northwest Territories Act'', is enacted by Parliament. This Act amends Section 110 of the  ''Northwest Territories Act'' to state that “Either the English or the French language may be used by any person in the debates of the Legislative Assembly of the Territories and in the proceedings before the courts; and both those languages shall be used in the records and journals of such Assembly” but allows the Assembly itself to make the territories unilingual, providing a specific formula is used:
{{cquote|[The Legislative] Assembly may, by ordinance or otherwise, regulate its proceedings, and the manner of recording and publishing the same; and the regulations so made shall be embodied in a proclamation which shall forthwith be made and published by the Lieutenant Governor in conformity with the law, and therefore shall have full force and effect.&lt;ref&gt;Claude-Armand Sheppard, ''The Law of Languages in Canada''. Studies of the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism, no. 11. Ottawa: Information Canada, 1971, pp. 84-85.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
*''' 1892: ''' The territorial legislature votes in favour of a resolution “that it is desirable that the proceedings of the Legislative Assembly shall be recorded and published hereafter in the English Language only.” However, the resolution is never proclaimed by the lieutenant governor, as required by the amended wording of Section 110 of the ''Northwest Territories Act'' that had been adopted by the Parliament of Canada a year earlier.&lt;ref&gt;In 1965, Claude-Armand Sheppard, a researcher in the employ of the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism, made an exhaustive search for documentary evidence that the 1892 resolution had ever been proclaimed by the lieutenant-governor. A search of the Public Archives of Saskatchewan, as well of the Dominion Archives, could produce no record. Sheppard therefore wrote, “[W]e conclude that in the absence of the proclamation required by the 1891 Amendment to the North-West Territories Act, the resolution abolishing French in the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories never acquired ‘full force and effect’ and that not only is it still permissible to use French in the debates but that the records and journals must still be printed in both languages and should have been so printed without interruption since 1892.’ See Claude-Armand Sheppard, ''The Law of Languages in Canada''. Studies of the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism, no. 11. Ottawa: Information Canada, 1971, pp. 84-85.&lt;/ref&gt; This is significant because it means that in the Northwest Territories and all of the successor jurisdictions that are carved out of it (Yukon in 1898, Alberta and Saskatchewan in 1905, and Nunavut in 1999), French retains, in theory at least, its legal status as a language of the legislature and courts, even though English is nearly universally assumed to be the only official language. In the 1980s, this will result in Alberta and Saskatchewan being declared officially bilingual by a decision of the Supreme Court of Canada.
*''' 1984: ''' The territorial government responds to federal government pressure to make the territory officially bilingual (English and French only) by adopting the ''Official Languages Act'', which English, French, and nine aboriginal languages into official languages of the territorial government. The law permits territorial residents to use any of these languages in territorial courts or in debates of the legislature, but documents are published in the aboriginal languages only when requested by the legislature, and laws are enacted only in English and French.

===[[Nova Scotia]]===
*''' 1710-1749: ''' In 1710 Acadia is occupied by the British, and under the terms of Article XII of the [[Treaty of Utrecht]], sovereignty is formally transferred from France to Britain in 1713. For the next four decades, the British retain only a limited presence in the colony, consisting of a few soldiers and merchants, and a transient fishing population.  Therefore, “[g]overnment was largely a matter of supervising the Acadians who constituted almost the entire population.... [The Acadians] disregarded official regulations and maintained a form of rudimentary self-rule.”  This informal arrangement was possible because “[as] early as 1710 the Acadians had sent emissaries to deal with the new masters who, realizing the need for persons to receive and see to the execution of their orders, proceeded to regularize their election and functions.” On this basis, “it might be said that to that extent the French language continued to be recognized under the British.”&lt;ref&gt;The preceding series of linked quotations  are taken from Claude-Armand Sheppard, ''The Law of Languages in Canada''. Studies of the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism, no. 11. Ottawa: Information Canada, 1971, pp. 5-6.&lt;/ref&gt; '''Population Affected:'''  Between 1710-1749, the French-speaking Acadian population grows from around 1,700 to about 10,000, and the English-speaking population grows from zero to about 2,500.&lt;ref&gt;The population statistics are taken from Claude-Armand Sheppard, ''The Law of Languages in Canada''.

*''' 1749:''' Nova Scotia receives its first constitution, in the form of a Commission and Instructions to Governor [[Edward Cornwallis]], meaning that the domestic law of England would govern the functioning of the courts. Because the use of all other languages, including French, had been banned in the courts of England in 1731, this means that in Nova Scotia, English becomes the only official language.&lt;ref&gt;Sheppard, Claude-Armand, ''The Law of Languages in Canada''. Studies of the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism, no. 11. Ottawa: Information Canada, 1971, pp 6-7.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''' 1755: ''' [[Great Upheaval|Mass deportation]] of the Acadians takes place. Seven thousand Acadians are rounded up and expelled from the colony. Others flee to the woods or make their way overland to [[New France]].
*''' 1758-1867: ''' In 1758, Nova Scotia’s first elections are held and the first Legislative Assembly is convened. No formal provisions exist as to the language of debate and of record, but mot Acadian have already been expelled and the rest are ineligible for office under the provisions of the anti-Catholic [[Test Act]], which applies in Nova Scotia by virtue of the 1749 Commission applying English domestic law to Nova Scotia. Therefore, no French-speaking voters participate in the elections, and the question of using a language other than English never arises. “From the time of the first Legislative Assembly in 1758 to Confederation, not a single Nova Scotia statute is to be found conferring any legal recognition whatever on the French language. Only English has legal status.” &lt;ref name="Sheppard, Claude-Armand 1971, p. 7"&gt;Sheppard, Claude-Armand, ''The Law of Languages in Canada''.

The [[government of Ontario]] criticizes the decision as [[judicial activism]], and charges that "The divisional court decision has effectively rewritten the constitution to make [[Section 16.1 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 16.1]] applicable to Ontario despite the express intention that it apply to New Brunswick alone."&lt;ref&gt;Wills, Terrance.  “English will do:  Ontario:  Franco-Ontarians’ plight not our problem:  Harris.”  ''The Gazette''.

Prior to the British conquest of Île Saint-Jean in 1758, the island is home to a homogenous French-speaking population and is  administered entirely in French. Following the great Acadian deportation of 1755, the island’s Acadian population grows  rapidly, to around 3,500 (many of whom were refugees fleeing the deportations in the Acadian heartland on the Bay of Fundy).

* ''' 1608-1759: ''' Prior to the British conquest of Quebec in 1759, the European population in the most heavily populated part of what is now Quebec (primarily the St. Lawrence River valley) was a homogenous French-speaking community, and was administered entirely in French.
*''' 1760:''' The ''Articles of Capitulation'', under which French resistance to the British occupiers ceases, are signed in Montreal. These articles provide the legal framework for the administration of the territory while it remains under British military rule (which lasts until 1763). Capitulation article no. 45 contains the first British acknowledgement of a formal role for the French language in its newly conquered territory. The British agree that legal documents of the ''ancien regime'', including deeds, registers, and notarized documents, will retain legal force. Although no mention is made of the French language, "the British ... ensured continuity in the administration of justice by having available for consultation the precedents and records of the previous regime, all of them, of course, entirely in the French language." &lt;ref&gt;Sheppard, Claude-Armand, ''The Law of Languages in Canada''.

*''' 1763:''' On October 7, King George III issues a [[Proclamation of 1763|Royal Proclamation]] establishing a colonial government for Quebec. The Proclamation gives legal expression to assimilationist policies. Although assimilation is primarily focused on replacing Catholicism with Protestantism, it has the practical consequence of denying rights on the basis of language. Since Catholics cannot take the necessary oath, they are excluded from participating in the new assembly of freeholders, from serving as officers of the new courts that are to be established, or even from practicing law. The practical consequence of this is to cause all justice to be administered by English-speakers. However, informal considerations make the restrictions on the use of French much less onerous than the letter of the law would suggest. [[Eugene Gosselin]] explains:
{{cquote|The British authorities did more than use French in their relations with their new subjects. They also used French as their own language of work and for correspondence. Nothing gave greater satisfaction to British pride than to be able to show a knowledge of French at least equal to what one would find among the best educated people in French Canada. Therefore the problem of language and culture did not constitute and could not constitute a political problem during the first ten or so years of the existence of the colony.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Gosselin, “L’administration publique dans un pays bilingue et biculturel”, ''Canadian Public Administration'', Vol. VI (1963), pp. 410-411.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

*''' 1764:''' Governor [[James Murray (Quebec governor)|James Murray]] issues an ordinance modifying the restrictive rules regarding the administration of justice, to permit French-speaking Catholics to serve as lawyers in the Court of Common Pleas because "we have not yet got one English Barrister or Attorney [in Quebec] who understands the French Language." Murray's ordinance also allows French-speaking Catholics to serve on juries, because "As there are but Two Hundred Protestant Subjects in the Province ... it is thought unjust to exclude the new Roman Catholic Subjects to sit upon Juries, as such exclusion would constitute the said Two hundred Protestants perpetual Judges of the lives and Property of...Eighty Thousand of the new Subjects...."&lt;ref&gt;Sheppard, Claude-Armand, ''The Law of Languages in Canada''. Studies of the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism, no. 11. Ottawa: Information Canada, 1971, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Murray asserts in a letter to his superiors in England that this is meant to be a "temporary Expedient" until he receives clearer instructions, but in practice, French-speaking juries and lawyers exist from this point forward.
*''' 1764:''' The ''[[Quebec Gazette]]'' is published for the first time on June 21. This publication contains public ordinances and subordinate legislation (regulations) in both English and French.

*''' 1768:''' Governor [[Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester|Guy Carleton]] hires a secretary to translate all laws and orders of the governor and council into French. This provides a permanent formalization of the process of bilingual publication that had been undertaken by the ''Quebec Gazette'' four years earlier.
* ''' 1774: ''' The ''[[Quebec Act]]'' is adopted. Although it contains nothing specific on language, the Act ends  the legal exclusion of French Canadians from participating in government  on the basis of religion (the [[Test Act|Test Oath]] being replaced with a simple Oath of allegiance to the Crown). From this point forward, French-speaking Catholics begin to participate in some of the functions of the civil government. French Canadians participate when the first session of the colony’s new Legislative Council in 1777. As well, from the very start debates in the Legislative Council take place in both French and English, and both languages are used for its records. The absence of specific mention, in the ''Quebec Act'', of reference to the use of French in the courts or in government is probably due to the fact that informal arrangements had already been made, under Governor Carleton’s administration, for Canadian lawyers to plead cases in French and to use either language in written procedures. As well, ordinances were already being published in both languages.&lt;ref&gt;Sheppard, Claude-Armand, ''The Law of Languages in Canada''.

This law code, which will remain in effect in the post-Confederation Province of Quebec until 1994, includes Canada’s first explicit rule for the judicial interpretation of statutes that have been drafted in both English and French. Article 2615 of the Code reads as follows:
{{cquote|If in any article of this code founded on the laws existing at the time of its promulgation there shall be a difference between the English and French texts, that version shall prevail which is the most consistent with the provisions of the existing laws on which the article is founded; and if there be any such difference in an article changing the existing laws, that version shall prevail which is the most consistent with the intention of the article, and the ordinary rules of legal interpretation shall apply in determining such intention.}}
* ''' 1867: ''' Section 133 of the ''[[British North America Act]]'' decrees that "The Acts of … the Legislature of Quebec shall be printed and published in both those Languages [ie. in both English and French]", and mandates the use of both French and English for legislative debates, publications of the legislature, and provincial courts.

* ''' 1982: ''' The Parti Québécois government of René Lévesque enacts a law inserting the [[Section Thirty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|"Notwithstanding Clause"]] into all existing Quebec legislation, thereby causing the ''Charter of Rights'' to be largely inoperative in Quebec. However, the  Lévesque government is unable to prevent section 23 of the Charter from applying to Quebec, as the "Notwithstanding Clause" has been drafted to apply only to certain parts of the Charter, excluding this part.
* '''1984:''' The Parti Québécois government of René Lévesque enacts Bill 3, a law to divide the province's schools based upon language rather than the traditional division based upon religion. A year later, the law is struck down by the [[Superior Court of Quebec]]. The decision is not appealed by the government, effectively ending this initiative.
* ''' 1984: '''  ''[[Attorney General of Quebec v. Quebec Protestant School Boards]]'': The Supreme Court of Canada rules that as a result of the recent adoption of the ''Charter of Rights'', it is no longer constitutional for the ''[[Charter of the French Language]]'' to deny an education in English to the child of any parent who was educated in English in any Canadian province (provincial law had previously permitted this only for children of parents educated in English in Quebec).
* ''' 1986: '''  ''[[MacDonald v. City of Montreal]]'': The Supreme Court of Canada rules that Section 133 of the  ''Constitution Act, 1867'' establishes only a negative right to use either official language in the Quebec legislature and its institutions, and does not extend to a right to have municipal services in English as well as French.
* ''' 1987: '''  The 1982 law inserting the ''Notwithstanding Clause'' into all Quebec laws is allowed to lapse by the Liberal government of Robert Bourassa, and all Quebec laws therefore become subject to the ''Charter of Rights''.
* ''' 1988: ''' '' [[Ford v. Quebec (A.G.)]]'': The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] rules that the commercial sign law provisions of Bill 101, are unconstitutional.  The Quebec government reacts by ''An Act to Amend the Charter of the French Language'' (better known as “Bill 178”), which re-enacts the unconstitutional provisions under the authority of the [[Section Thirty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|"Notwithstanding Clause"]].
* ''' 1988: ''' '' [[Devine v. Quebec (Attorney General)]]'': The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] rules that it would be a constitutionally permissible restriction on freedom of speech for the Quebec government to require that French be “markedly predominant” on commercial signs, as long as other languages are not actually banned.
* ''' 1989:''' ''[[Greater Montreal Protestant School Board v. Quebec]]'': The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] rules that language rights which are not included in the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Charter of Rights]] should be interpreted less generously than those which have Charter protection.
* ''' 1993: ''' The Liberal government of Robert Bourassa enacts ''[[Bill 86|An Act to Amend the Charter of the French Language]]'' (better known as “Bill 86”), amending the sign law to bring it into conformity with the Supreme Court rulings in ''Ford v. Quebec (A.G.) '' and ''Devine v. Quebec (A.G.)'', by allowing other languages on commercial signs, subject to French being "markedly predominant".
* ''' 1993: ''' ''[[Ballantyne, Davidson, McIntyre v. Canada]]'': A human rights tribunal of the [[United Nations]] finds Quebec’s restrictions on commercial signs in languages other than French to be an unwarranted restriction, under the terms of articles 2, 19, 26 and 27 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] on freedom of expression in the pursuit of a legitimate objective (strengthening the position of the French language). The ruling is not enforceable.
* '''1997: ''' An amendment to the Constitution provides for linguistic rather than confessional (Catholic and Protestant) school boards in Quebec.
* ''' 2002: ''' '' [[A.G. of Quebec (Procureur Général) c. John Reid et Frances Muriel Reid]]'': The Quebec Court of Appeal rules that the Quebec government cannot require Quebec-based websites to conform with provincial language law, because the internet falls under federal jurisdiction.
* ''' 2002: ''' The legislature enacts Bill 104, ''An Act to amend the Charter of the French Language.'' This law amends section 73 of the Charter to limit the ability of parents to get around the Charter's requirement that they send their children to school in French. Some parents had been enrolling their children in private English-language schools for short periods of time, thereby meeting the technical hurdle needed to allow the child to be enrolled permanently in an English-language school. Section 73 was amended to require that the "major part" of the instruction received by the child had been in English, in order to allow that child to receive a publicly funded English-language education.
* ''' 2005:''' ''[[Solski (Tutor of) v. Quebec (Attorney General)]]'': The Supreme Court of Canada rules that the "major part" requirement in section 73 of the ''Charter of the French Language'', which had been added to the Charter under 2002's Bill 104, violates subsection 23(2) of the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]''.  The Court does not strike down the law, but presents the province with a set of criteria for bringing the law into conformity with the ''Charter of Rights''.

===[[Saskatchewan]] ===
''For events prior to the creation of the province 1905, see [[#Northwest Territories|Northwest Territories]]''

* ''' 1905: ''' Under the provisions of the [[The Saskatchewan Act|''Saskatchewan Act'']], the new province of Saskatchewan is carved out of the Northwest Territories. Section 16 of the ''Saskatchewan Act'' calls for the continuation within the new province of all existing Northwest Territories legislation. Therefore, because the Northwest Territories legislature had voted in 1892 to make that English the only official language for that territory, Saskatchewan comes into existence as an officially unilingual jurisdiction.
*'''1931:''' The legislature enacts the ''School Act'', which declares English to be the sole language of instruction in Saskatchewan's public schools.
*'''1967:''' The first of three amendments to the provincial ''Education Act'' (the second and third taking place in 1973 and 1978, respectively) reintroducing French-language instruction. By the end of this decade-long process, French can again be used in Saskatchewan as the principal language of instruction, opening up the possibility of schools specifically for francophone students. As well,  immersion schools are now possible.
* '''1988:''' ''[[R. v. Mercure]]''. The Supreme Court of Canada rules that Saskatchewan is legally obligated to enact all laws in both French and English, but that this obligation may be altered or repealed by a 'clear legislative pronouncement' of the provincial legislature.
* '''1988:''' In response to the ruling in ''R. v. Mercure'', the provincial legislature enacts the ''Language Act''. This law declares all existing laws valid, even if enacted in English only, but provides that limited French-language rights will apply within the judicial system.
*'''1990:''' The provincial government establishes the Office of French Language Coordination (later renamed the Francophone Affairs Branch), "to assist provincial government ministries, crown corporations and agencies in providing more services in French to the Francophone community."[http://www.ops.gov.sk.ca/adx/aspx/adxGetMedia.aspx?DocID=437,411,81,1,Documents&amp;MediaID=667&amp;Filename=French+Language+Service+Policy+May+2009_EN.pdf]
*'''1993:''' The ''Education Act'' is amended to permit francophones to manage their own schools.

===[[Yukon]] ===
''For events prior to the creation of the territory in 1898, see [[#Northwest Territories|Northwest Territories]]''

*''' 1898: ''' By an Act of Parliament, the Yukon Territory is created out of territory formerly under the jurisdiction of the Northwest Territories. Section 9 of the ''Yukon Territory Act'' states that “the laws relating to civil and criminal matters and the ordinances as the same exist in the North-west Territories at the time of the passing of this Act, shall be and remain in force in the said Yukon Territory in so far as applicable thereto until amended or repealed....” Therefore, because the Northwest Territories legislature had voted in 1892 to make that English the only official language for that territory, the Yukon comes into existence as an officially unilingual jurisdiction.

"'''Trapped in the Sky'''" is the first episode of ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]'', a British 1960s [[Supermarionation]] television series. Written by co-creators [[Gerry Anderson|Gerry]] and [[Sylvia Anderson]], it was first broadcast on [[ATV Midlands]] on 30 September 1965. The plot revolves around criminal mastermind the [[Hood (Thunderbirds)|Hood]], who sabotages the nuclear-powered airliner ''[[Thunderbirds machines#Fireflash|Fireflash]]'' prior to her maiden flight. Unable to land for fear of detonating a motion-sensitive bomb, and threatened by radiation leaking from ''Fireflash''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s overworked atomic reactor, the crew and passengers' only hope of survival is the newly formed International Rescue Organisation.

While drafting the episode, the Andersons found inspiration in Gerry's experiences as a conscript in the [[RAF]] during the 1940s, when he witnessed the fatal crash of a [[de Havilland Mosquito|Mosquito]] fighter and the controlled landing of a damaged [[Spitfire]]. Filmed mostly in late 1964, "Trapped in the Sky" features pioneering work from series [[special effects]] director [[Derek Meddings]], who used a looping "rolling road" mechanism to simplify the shooting of the ''Fireflash'' rescue.

[[Lew Grade]], head of distributor [[ITC Entertainment|ITC]], was so pleased with the 25-minute [[Television pilot|pilot]] that he instructed the production staff to double the standard episode running length to fill a one-hour commercial timeslot. This necessitated the writing of [[Wikt:filler|filler]] scenes and subplots.

Well received on its first broadcast,&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 124"/&gt; "Trapped in the Sky" remains critically acclaimed and is generally considered to be one of the best episodes of the series.&lt;ref name="Heffer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DVDVerdict"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CultTimes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Andersonic"/&gt; It was [[Radio drama|adapted for audio]] by Century 21 Records in 1966, transmitted on [[BBC Radio]] in revised form in 1990, and had its first [[TV network]] broadcast on [[BBC Two]] in 1991. In 2015, "Trapped in the Sky" was remade as "Fireflash", the fifth episode of the CGI reboot ''[[Thunderbirds Are Go (TV series)|Thunderbirds Are Go]]''.

==Plot==
Criminal mastermind the [[Hood (Thunderbirds)|Hood]] (voiced by [[Ray Barrett]]) is telepathically linked to his half-brother, [[Kyrano]] ([[David Graham (actor)|David Graham]]), the manservant on [[Tracy Island]]. Abusing this connection and inflicting severe psychological trauma on his sibling, he discovers that International Rescue – the Tracy family's newly formed life-saving organisation – is ready to start operations. Determined to steal the secrets of IR's [[Thunderbirds machines|''Thunderbird'' machines]], the Hood plots to have the Tracys called to a disaster situation of his own design. Travelling from his temple hideout in the Malaysian jungle to [[London Heathrow Airport|London International Airport]], he plants a bomb next to the landing gear hydraulics of Air Terrainean's new ''[[Thunderbirds machines#Fireflash|Fireflash]]'' – an atomic-powered, [[hypersonic]] airliner departing for her maiden flight to Tokyo. One of the passengers is Kyrano's daughter, [[Tin-Tin Kyrano|Tin-Tin]]. In an anonymous videophone call to London Tower, the Hood warns Commander Norman of Air Traffic Control that the motion-sensitive device will detonate from the impact of landing.

''Fireflash'' is recalled and Captain Hanson and his co-pilot instructed to circle the airspace above the airport. The shielding on the airliner's atomic reactor is weakening; if ''Fireflash'' does not land within two hours, the passengers and crew will die of [[Radiation poisoning|radiation exposure]]. Air Traffic Control commandeers an Air Force jet that docks with ''Fireflash'' in flight, allowing a Lieutenant Bob Meddings to board the hold and attempt to remove the bomb. Meddings is almost killed when he falls through the unclosed maintenance hatch and plummets to the ground; moments before impact, however, he successfully deploys his parachute and ultimately survives.

IR's [[John Tracy (Thunderbirds)|John Tracy]] (Barrett), who has been monitoring radio traffic from the space station ''[[Thunderbird 5]]'', relays news of the unfolding events to Tracy Island. [[Jeff Tracy|Jeff]] ([[Peter Dyneley]]) immediately dispatches [[Scott Tracy|Scott]] ([[Shane Rimmer]]) and [[Virgil Tracy|Virgil]] ([[David Holliday]]) in ''[[Thunderbird 1|Thunderbirds 1]]'' and ''[[Thunderbird 2|2]]'' – the latter carrying Pod 3 – to London. Arriving at the danger zone, Scott assures Norman of IR's good intentions, in return demanding his word that no photographs will be taken of either aircraft. However, the Hood, disguised as one of the [[airport police]] detachment, breaks into the unmanned ''Thunderbird 1'' and photographs the cockpit. Scott is alerted by the Automatic Camera Detector and the Hood flees, chased along the [[M1 motorway]] by the police.

Arriving in ''Thunderbird 2'', Virgil deploys three [[Thunderbird 2 pod vehicles#Elevator Cars|Elevator Cars]], two of which will be remote-controlled from his master vehicle. ''Fireflash'' will be guided into a controlled landing on top of the cars, touching down with its undercarriage raised. Virgil and the Elevator Cars rush to intercept ''Fireflash'' as it speeds down Runway 29, but when one of the remote-controlled cars malfunctions and crashes into parked aircraft, the rescue attempt is aborted and the operation suspended while Virgil activates a reserve car. ''Fireflash'' starts a second run and successfully makes contact with all three vehicles. Applying brakes, Virgil loses control of the master car, which crashes into a trench; he is uninjured, however, and ''Fireflash'' comes to a halt before reaching the end of the runway. The bomb is dislodged from its original position but ultimately fails to explode.

As the Hood has managed to evade the authorities, Scott leaves him to IR's London agent, [[Lady Penelope Creighton-Ward]] ([[Sylvia Anderson]]). Chasing the enemy in their specially-modified [[List of Rolls-Royce motor cars|Rolls-Royce]], [[FAB 1]], Penelope and her butler, [[Aloysius Parker|Parker]] (Graham), blast him off the motorway using the car's front-mounted machine gun. Although the Hood survives the encounter, his photographs are destroyed.

Back on Tracy Island, Jeff implements "Operation Cover-Up" to hide the existence of IR while Kyrano is examined by a doctor from the mainland, who dismisses the manservant's prior nausea as a sign of stress. When the topic of the conversation shifts to the ''Fireflash'' incident, the doctor declares that he would be honoured to shake IR by the hand. With a parting handshake, Jeff grants the unknowing guest his wish, before announcing to his sons, "Boys, I think we're in business."

==Production==
Inspiration for the plot of "Trapped in the Sky" was derived from creator-producer [[Gerry Anderson]]'s memories of his [[Conscription in the United Kingdom#After 1945|National Service]].&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 117"&gt;La Rivière 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;117.&lt;/ref&gt; While stationed at [[RAF Manston]] in Kent from 1947 to 1949, the young Anderson had witnessed a [[Battle of Britain]]-themed [[air show]] coming to a fateful end: a [[de Havilland Mosquito|Mosquito]] fighter had gone out of control and crashed to the ground, resulting in 20 fatalities.&lt;ref name="Teletronic"&gt;{{cite web|last=Marcus|first=Laurence|title=Gerry Anderson: The Puppet Master|url=http://www.teletronic.co.uk/gerryanderson.htm|work=teletronic.co.uk|year=2005|accessdate=14 January 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080221151212/http://www.teletronic.co.uk/gerryanderson.htm|archivedate=21 February 2008|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few months after the Mosquito disaster, he saw a [[Spitfire]] with a damaged undercarriage make a successful emergency landing at the airbase.&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 117"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Teletronic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web|title=''Thunderbirds'' Trivia |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A789023 |publisher=[[BBC Online]] |date=17 July 2002 |accessdate=14 January 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5mjb2MjdL?url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A789023 |archivedate=12 January 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 103"&gt;Archer and Hearn 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;103.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[pre-production]] of ''Thunderbirds'', Anderson used his recollections of the events as the foundation of the bomb plot surrounding the ''[[Thunderbirds machines#Fireflash|Fireflash]]'' airliner.&lt;ref name="Teletronic"/&gt; Anderson dictated the script to his wife, [[Sylvia Anderson|Sylvia]], for typing at their villa in Portugal; it was completed in four sessions during the spring of 1964.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 104"/&gt;&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 110"&gt;La Rivière 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;110.&lt;/ref&gt; As an [[in-joke]], the character of Lieutenant Bob Meddings is named after Bob Bell, the [[AP Films]] art director, and [[Derek Meddings]], the director of [[special effects]].&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bentley: Thunderbirds, 64"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fanderson"&gt;{{cite web|title=''Thunderbirds'' Episode Guide (Series One)|url=http://www.fanderson.org.uk/epguides/tbirdseg1.html|publisher=[[Fanderson]]|accessdate=14 January 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513030522/http://www.fanderson.org.uk/epguides/tbirdseg1.html|archivedate=13 May 2008|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming===
{{cquote|I remember seeing an aircraft coming into land with its wheels still up. Luckily it was warned off just as it was about to touch down. I will also never forget seeing a [[de Havilland Mosquito|Mosquito]] aircraft that was giving an [[aerobatics]] display crashing and blowing up. Years later, when we were working on pre-production for ''Thunderbirds'', I recalled those two incidents and together they helped me form the basic idea for the first episode.&lt;br&gt;{{emdash}}[[Gerry Anderson]] on his inspiration (2000)&lt;ref name="Bentley: Thunderbirds, 21"&gt;Bentley 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;21.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Filming on the [[Television pilot|pilot episode]] of ''Thunderbirds'' commenced in the late summer of 1964 after five months of pre-production.&lt;ref name="Bentley: Episode Guide, 95"&gt;Bentley 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;95.&lt;/ref&gt; Between the scripting and filming stages, the name of the new TV series had been finalised, ''Thunderbirds'' having initially been titled ''International Rescue''; additionally, the fleet of star vehicles had originally been named the ''Rescues''.&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 105"&gt;Archer and Hearn 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;105.&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is no on-screen title caption, the episode is referred to in all internal production documentation by the name "Trapped in the Sky".&lt;ref name="Fanderson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bentley: Episode Guide, 97"&gt;Bentley 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;97.&lt;/ref&gt;

While preparing to film the ''Fireflash'' controlled landing sequence, Meddings was faced with the difficulty of having to build an extended, dynamic runway set in the limited shooting space available at AP Films Studios.&lt;ref name="Bentley: Thunderbirds, 22"&gt;Bentley 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;22.&lt;/ref&gt; His compact and cost-efficient solution was to isolate the basic set elements – the grass verge foreground, the sky background and the tarmac separating them – and construct separate loops of canvas, all painted to represent one element; these were fitted to rollers that, when run at speeds proportionate to their respective distances from the camera, simulated a continuous backdrop.&lt;ref name="Bentley: Thunderbirds, 22"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 108"&gt;Archer and Hearn 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;108.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 118"&gt;La Rivière 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;118.&lt;/ref&gt; This "rolling road" (or "roller-road") technique marked a progression from the "rolling sky" that had been pioneered in previous Anderson series, such as ''[[Stingray (1964 TV series)|Stingray]]''.&lt;ref name="Bentley: Thunderbirds, 22"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 108"/&gt;&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 118"/&gt;

The crash of the left-side remote-controlled [[Thunderbird 2 Pod Vehicles#Elevator Cars|Elevator Car]] was originally a [[Blooper|gaffe]], caused when the wire pulling the scale model across the "rolling road" unexpectedly snapped.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bentley: Thunderbirds, 22"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 108"/&gt;&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 118"/&gt; So satisfied was Meddings with the realism of the shot that he asked the Andersons to re-write their script to accommodate the error.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bentley: Thunderbirds, 22"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 108"/&gt; This was later supplemented with new footage of the rogue Elevator Car colliding with a parked aircraft, starting a fire on the tarmac; in the episode, the stationary vehicles are left to burn since, as stated by Commander Norman, "''Fireflash'' is carrying passengers – they're not!"&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bentley: Thunderbirds, 22"/&gt;&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 118"/&gt;

During the [[Tracy Island]] briefing scene, [[Alan Tracy]]'s voice is audibly lower and deeper than in later episodes. Since voice actor [[Matt Zimmerman (actor)|Matt Zimmerman]] had yet to be added to the regular cast at the time of dialogue recording, [[Ray Barrett]] (who voiced [[John Tracy (Thunderbirds)|John]] and the [[Hood (Thunderbirds)|Hood]]) supplied the character's single line ("OK, father").&lt;ref name="Fanderson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bentley: Thunderbirds, 63"&gt;Bentley 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;63.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his absence, Zimmerman is listed in the closing credits of "Trapped in the Sky".&lt;ref name="Bentley: Thunderbirds, 63"/&gt; A second [[continuity error]] occurs during the concluding scene.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fanderson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bentley: Episode Guide, 97"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bentley: Thunderbirds, 63"/&gt; When [[Jeff Tracy|Jeff]] initiates the "Operation Cover-up" security protocol to erase all sign of International Rescue's presence for purposes of the doctor's visit, the portraits on the wall change from photographs of the Tracy brothers in uniform to a different set in which civilian attire is worn; however, in a subsequent shot, the edge of a blue uniform is still visible.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fanderson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bentley: Episode Guide, 97"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bentley: Thunderbirds, 63"/&gt;

===Post-production===
[[Barry Gray]]'s arrangements for the episode's opening and closing theme music – based on the signature "The ''Thunderbirds'' March", which accompanies the [[Stock footage|stock]] launch sequences of ''[[Thunderbird 1|Thunderbirds 1]]'', ''[[Thunderbird 2|2]]'' and ''[[Thunderbird 3|3]]'' – are unique to "Trapped in the Sky".&lt;ref name="Bentley: Thunderbirds, 64"&gt;Bentley 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;64.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fanderson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bentley: Episode Guide, 97"/&gt; As an end theme, "The ''Thunderbirds'' March" was a last-minute substitute for "Flying High"; this was a lyrical track, sung by [[Gary Miller (singer)|Gary Miller]], which was conceived to serve as a [[counterpoint]] to the instrumental opening music.&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 124"&gt;Archer and Hearn 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;124.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 128"&gt;La Rivière 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;128.&lt;/ref&gt; It was judged by Anderson and Gray to be tonally unsuitable and was replaced two weeks before the first broadcast of "Trapped in the Sky" in September 1965.&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 124"/&gt; Gray recorded the [[incidental music]] in December 1964, at the [[Olympic Studios]] at [[Barnes, London|Barnes]], London, with an orchestra of 30 instrumentalists.&lt;ref name="TVCentury21"&gt;{{cite web|last=de Klerk |first=Theo |title=Complete Studio-Recording List of Barry Gray |url=http://www.tvcentury21.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=67:complete-studio-recording-list-of-barry-gray&amp;catid=116:barry-gray&amp;Itemid=182 |work=tvcentury21.com |date=25 December 2003 |accessdate=1 October 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5m00eATOK?url=http://www.tvcentury21.com/index.php?option=com_content |archivedate=13 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Thunderbirds'' was originally due to have a 25-minute episode running time; this was doubled at the instruction of [[Lew Grade]], Anderson's financial backer at distributor [[ITC Entertainment|ITC]], after a preview screening of "Trapped in the Sky".&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bentley: Episode Guide, 95"/&gt; Praising the plot and special effects, Grade commented, "That's not a television series, that's a feature film!"&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 118"/&gt; With the budget per episode also increased from £25,000 to £38,000,&lt;ref name="Bentley: Episode Guide, 95"/&gt; the pilot and eight other unfinished episodes were extended and re-edited to run for 50 minutes (filling a one-hour commercial timeslot).&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bentley: Episode Guide, 95"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Archer | first1 = Simon |author1-link=Simon Archer (author) | last2 = Nicholls | first2 = Stan | author2-link = Stan Nicholls | title = Gerry Anderson: The Authorised Biography | year = 1996 | publisher = [[Legend Books]] | location = London, UK | isbn = 978-0-09-922442-6 | page = 87}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of "Trapped in the Sky", new footage was filmed during the shooting of "Operation Crash-Dive", which features the return of ''Fireflash'' and was written as a sequel to the first episode.&lt;ref name="Bentley: Thunderbirds, 27"&gt;Bentley 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;27.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the newly added scenes were the subplot concerning Meddings' boarding of ''Fireflash'', as well as the first rescue attempt involving the Elevator Cars.&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 104"&gt;Archer and Hearn 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;104.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 123"&gt;Archer and Hearn 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;123.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 122"&gt;La Rivière 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;122.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Broadcast==
"Trapped in the Sky" was first broadcast on [[ATV Midlands]] at 7:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. on 30 September 1965.&lt;ref name="Bentley: Episode Guide, 109"&gt;Bentley 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;109.&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative, two-part format debuted on 20 October for the episode's [[Granada Television]] première.&lt;ref name="Bentley: Episode Guide, 114"&gt;Bentley 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;114.&lt;/ref&gt; The episode was [[Television network|networked]] nationwide for the first time on 20 September 1991, after [[BBC Two]] acquired the broadcast rights to the series;&lt;ref name="Bentley: Thunderbirds, 124"&gt;Bentley 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;124.&lt;/ref&gt; it achieved ratings of 6.8&amp;nbsp;million viewers when it was repeated by the channel in 1992. On 18 December 1994, "Trapped in the Sky" was transmitted in a re-edited format as the first episode of ''[[Works based on Thunderbirds#US re-edits|Turbocharged Thunderbirds]]''; broadcast on [[UPN]] in the United States, the programme combined footage drawn from the 1960s series with new, live-action scenes.&lt;ref name="Bentley: Episode Guide, 116"&gt;Bentley 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;116.&lt;/ref&gt; The episode was broadcast in [[surround sound]] for the first time on BBC Two on 3 September 2000.&lt;ref name="Bentley: Episode Guide, 117"&gt;Bentley 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;117.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the episode has re-appeared several times in condensed [[Radio drama|audio]] form. The first adaptation, with narration from [[Shane Rimmer]] (in character as [[Scott Tracy|Scott]]), was originally released as the [[mini-album]] ''Thunderbird 1'' (MA 108) in April 1966 by [[AP Films#Century 21|Century 21 Records]].&lt;ref name="Bentley: Thunderbirds, 64"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bentley: Episode Guide, 349"&gt;Bentley 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;349.&lt;/ref&gt; With an introduction by [[Gerry Anderson]] and additional narration by Rimmer, ''Thunderbird 1'' was broadcast on [[BBC Radio 5 (former)|BBC Radio 5]] as the first episode of a radio series in November 1990.&lt;ref name="Bentley: Episode Guide, 114"/&gt; Most recently, "Trapped in the Sky" was adapted for [[Penguin Books|Penguin Audiobooks]].&lt;ref name="Fanderson"/&gt;

"Trapped in the Sky" received a positive, contemporary critical response from [[L.

Vincent Law of the ''Andersonic'' website argues that the episode's status as series pilot is not detrimental to the writing of the plot, which employs a theme – suggested to be common to many Anderson-produced series – of "advanced technology, upon which the characters are reliant, going awry."&lt;ref name="Andersonic"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Law |first=Vincent |date=Spring 2008 |title='Trapped in the Sky' |journal=Andersonic |issue=5 |url=http://www.andersonic.co.uk/page19.htm |accessdate=14 January 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5mjcBaVid?url=http://www.andersonic.co.uk/page19.htm |archivedate=12 January 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among Law's criticisms is the characterisation, which is considered, at times, to test the limits of credibility; one example offered is the lack of emotional response from Tin-Tin to the precarious position of the sabotaged ''Fireflash''.&lt;ref name="Andersonic"/&gt; On the subject of dialogue, he gives a summary of "limp and routine at times – lots of 'left left, two degrees' – and overall much less witty than ''[[Stingray (1964 TV series)|Stingray]]''."&lt;ref name="Andersonic"/&gt; Law concludes that "Trapped in the Sky" overall is "a great opener, arguably the best episode of the series."&lt;ref name="Andersonic"/&gt;

Dr Phillip Atcliffe, an [[aerospace engineering]] lecturer at the [[University of Salford]], has praised "Trapped in the Sky" for its depiction of commercial [[hypersonic flight]]. While discussing on the development of the [[Lockheed Martin SR-72]] reconnaissance plane in 2013, Atcliffe made reference to the episode and commented that the time necessary for the fictional ''Fireflash'' to fly from London to Tokyo (two hours at a reported Mach 6) would be "surprisingly accurate" in reality. He also expressed the view that the altitude at which ''Fireflash'' is stated to be travelling – {{Convert|250,000|ft}} – would be optimal for a passenger aircraft travelling at hypersonic speeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2512994/London-New-York-hour-Flight-Hypersonic-preparing-board-50-years-Thunderbirds-came-idea.html|title=London to New York in under an hour!

'''Trivialism''' ({{etymology|la|trivialis|found everywhere}}) is the [[logical theory]] that all [[Statement (logic)|statements]] (also known as [[propositions]]) are [[truth value|true]] and that all [[contradiction]]s of the form "p and not p" (e.g. the ball is red and not red) are true. In accordance with this, a '''trivialist''' is a person who believes everything is true.&lt;ref name="GabbayWoods2007"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-first=Dov M.|editor1-last=Gabbay|editor2-first=John|editor2-last=Woods|title=The Many Valued and Nonmonotonic Turn in Logic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3TNj1ZkP3qEC&amp;pg=PA131|year=2007|publisher=[[Elsevier]]|isbn=978-0-444-51623-7|page=131|first=Graham|last=Priest|chapter=Paraconsistency and Dialetheism}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="On the Plenitude of Truth"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Kabay|title=On the Plenitude of Truth.  A Defense of Trivialism|year=2010|publisher=[[Lambert Academic Publishing]]|isbn=978-3-8383-5102-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[classical logic]], trivialism is in direct violation of [[Aristotle]]'s [[law of noncontradiction]]. In [[philosophy]], trivialism is considered by some to be the complete opposite of [[skepticism]]. [[Paraconsistent logic]]s may use "the law of non-triviality" to abstain from trivialism in logical practices that involve true contradictions.

Theoretical arguments and anecdotes have been offered for trivialism to contrast it with theories such as [[modal realism]], [[dialetheism]] and paraconsistent logics.

==Overview==

===Etymology===
Trivialism, as a term, is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''trivialis,'' meaning something that can be found everywhere. From this, "[[wikt:trivial|trivial]]" was used to suggest something was introductory or simple. In [[logic]], from this meaning, a "trivial" theory is something regarded as defective in the face of a complex [[phenomenon]] that needs to be completely represented. Thus, literally, the trivialist theory is something expressed in the simplest possible way.&lt;ref name="Models of Possibilism and Trivialism" /&gt;

===Theory===

In [[First-order logic#Logical symbols|symbolic logic]], trivialism may be expressed as the following:&lt;ref name="A defense of trivialism 2008"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kabay|first=Paul|title=A defense of trivialism|url=http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/5734|work=PhD thesis, School of Philosophy, Anthropology, and Social Inquiry|page=29|publisher=[[The University of Melbourne]], Research Collections (UMER)|accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \forall pTp &lt;/math&gt;

The above would be read as "given any proposition, it is a true proposition" through [[universal quantification]] (∀).

A claim of trivialism may always apply its fundamental truth, otherwise known as a [[truth predicate]]:

: &lt;math&gt;p \leftrightarrow Tp&lt;/math&gt;

The above would be read as a "proposition [[if and only if]] a true proposition," meaning that all propositions are believed to be inherently proven as true. Without consistent use of this concept, a claim of advocating trivialism may not be seen as genuine and complete trivialism; as to claim a proposition is true but deny it as probably true may be considered inconsistent with the assumed theory.&lt;ref name="A defense of trivialism 2008" /&gt;

===Taxonomy of trivialisms===

Luis Estrada-González in "Models of Possiblism and Trivialism" lists four types of trivialism through the concept of [[possible world]]s, with a "world" being a possibility and "the actual world" being reality. It is theorized a trivialist simply designates a value to all propositions in equivalence to seeing all propositions and their negations as true. This taxonomy is used to demonstrate the different strengths and plausibility of trivialism in this context:

: (T0) Minimal trivialism: At some world, all propositions have a designated value.
: (T1) Pluralist trivialism: In some worlds, all propositions have a designated value.
: (T2) [[Actualism|Actualist]] trivialism: In the actual world, all propositions have a designated value.
: (T3) Absolute trivialism: In all worlds, all propositions have a designated value.&lt;ref name="Models of Possibilism and Trivialism" /&gt;

==Arguments against trivialism==

The consensus among the majority of philosophers is descriptively a denial of trivialism, termed as non-trivialism or anti-trivialism.&lt;ref name="Models of Possibilism and Trivialism"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Estrada-González|first=Luis|title=Models of Possibilism and Trivialism|journal=Logic and Logical Philosophy|volume=21|pages=175–205|url=http://wydawnictwoumk.pl/czasopisma/index.php/LLP/article/view/791}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to it being unable to produce a sound argument through the [[principle of explosion]] and it being considered an [[absurdity]] ([[reductio ad absurdum]]).&lt;ref name="On the Plenitude of Truth" /&gt;&lt;ref name="A defense of trivialism 2008" /&gt;

===Aristotle===
[[Aristotle]]'s [[law of noncontradiction]] and other arguments are considered to be against trivialism. Luis Estrada-González in "Models of Possiblism and Trivialism" has interpreted Aristotle's ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics Book IV]]'' as such: "...A family of arguments between 1008a26 and 1007b12 of the form 'If trivialism is right, then X is the case, but if X is the case then all things are one. But it is impossible that all things are one, so trivialism is impossible.'(...)these Aristotelian considerations are the seeds of virtually all subsequent suspicions against trivialism: Trivialism has to be rejected because it identifies what should not be identified, and is undesirable from a logical point of view because it identifies what is not identical, namely, truth and falsehood."&lt;ref name="Models of Possibilism and Trivialism" /&gt;

===Priest===

It is implicitly claimed by [[Graham Priest]], a professor of philosophy, that a position for trivialism is unsubstantial: "...a substantial case can be made for [dialetheism]; belief in [trivialism], though, would appear to be grounds for certifiable insanity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Priest|first=Graham|title=Perceiving contradictions|journal=Australasian Journal of Philosophy|volume=77|issue=4|date=1999|page=Volume 77, Issue 4, p. 443|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00048409912349211?journalCode=rajp20#.U3wYzyg0rDc|doi=10.1080/00048409912349211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has coined his rejection of trivialism "the law of non-triviality" as a replacement for the [[law of non-contradiction]] in [[paraconsistent logic]] and [[dialetheism]].&lt;ref name="Doubt truth" /&gt;

==Arguments for trivialism==

There are theoretical arguments for trivialism argued from the position of a [[devil's advocate]]:

===Argument from possibilism===
Paul Kabay has argued for trivialism in "On the Plenitude of Truth" from the following:

# "Possibilism is true [premise]
# If possibilism is true, then there is a world (either possible or impossible or both), ''w'', in which trivialism is true [premise]
# ''w'' is a possible world [premise]
# It is true in ''w'' that ''w'' is identical to the actual world, A [2]
# If it is true that there is a world, ''w'', and ''w'' is a possible world, and it is true in ''w'' that ''w'' is identical to A, then trivialism is true [premise]
# Trivialism is true [1–5]"&lt;ref name="On the Plenitude of Truth" /&gt;&lt;ref name="A defense of trivialism 2008" /&gt;

Above, possibilism ([[modal realism]]; related to [[possible worlds]]) is the barely accepted theory that every proposition is possible. With this assumed to be true, trivialism can be assumed to be true as well according to Kabay.

===Paradoxes===

The [[liar's paradox]], [[Curry's paradox]] alongside the [[principle of explosion]] all can be asserted as valid and not required to be resolved and used to defend trivialism.&lt;ref name="On the Plenitude of Truth" /&gt;&lt;ref name="A defense of trivialism 2008" /&gt;

==Philosophical implications==

===Comparison to skepticism===
In Paul Kabay's comparison of trivialism to schools of [[philosophical skepticism]] (in "On the Plenitude of Truth")—such as [[Pyrrhonism]]—who seek to attain a form of [[ataraxia]], or state of imperturbability; it is purported the figurative trivialist inherently attains this state. This is claimed to be justified by the figurative trivialist seeing every [[State of affairs (philosophy)|state of affairs]] being true, even in a state of anxiety. Once universally accepted as true, the trivialist is free from any further anxieties regarding whether any state of affairs is true.

Kabay compares the Pyrrhonian skeptic to the figurative trivialist and claims that as the skeptic reportedly attains a state of imperturbability through a [[Epoché|suspension]] of [[belief]], the trivialist may attain such a state through an abundance of belief.

In this case—and according to independent claims by Graham Priest—trivialism is considered the complete opposite of [[skepticism]].&lt;ref name="On the Plenitude of Truth" /&gt;&lt;ref name="A defense of trivialism 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Could Everything Be True?"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Priest |first1=G. |title=Could everything be true? |doi=10.1080/00048400012349471 |journal=Australasian Journal of Philosophy |volume=78 |issue=2 |pages=189–195 |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, insofar as the trivialist affirms all states of affairs as universally true, the Pyrrhonist neither affirms nor denies the truth (or falsity) of such affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Empiricus, S. (2000). ''Sextus Empiricus: Outlines of Scepticism''. [[Cambridge University Press]]. "Suspension of judgement is a standstill of intellect, owing to which we neither reject nor posit anything" (p. 5).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impossibility of action===
It is asserted by both Priest and Kabay that it is impossible for a trivialist [[Apraxia|to truly choose and thus act]]. Priest argues this by the following in ''Doubt Truth to Be a Liar'': "One cannot intend to act in such a way as to bring about some state of affairs, ''s'', if one believes ''s'' already to hold. Conversely, if one acts with the purpose of bringing ''s'' about, one cannot believe that ''s'' already obtains."&lt;ref name="Doubt truth"&gt;{{cite book|last=Priest|first=Graham|title=Doubt truth to be a liar|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0199238510|pages=69–71|edition=1st pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kevalin&gt;{{cite web|last=Kabay|first=Paul|title=Interpreting the Divyadhvani: On Why the Digambara Sect Is Right about the Nature of the Kevalin|url=http://philpapers.org/rec/KABITD|work=The Australasian Philosophy of Religion Association Conference|accessdate=23 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically, due to their suspension of determination upon striking equipollence between claims, the Pyrrhonist has also remained subject to apraxia charges.&lt;ref&gt;Comesaña, J.

Schofield, M. Burnyeat, and J. Barnes (eds.), Doubt and Dogmatism (pp. 20-53). Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advocates==
Paul Kabay, an Australian philosopher, in his book ''A Defense of Trivialism'' has argued that various philosophers in history have held views resembling trivialism, although he stops short of calling them trivialists. He mentions various pre-Socratic Greek philosophers as philosophers holding views resembling trivialism. He mentions that Aristotle in his book ''Metaphysics'' appears to suggest that Heraclitus and Anaxagoras advocated trivialism. He quotes Anaxagoras as saying that all things are one. Kabay also suggests Heraclitus' ideas are similar to trivialism because Heraclitus believed in a union of opposites, shown in such quotes as "the way up and down is the same".&lt;ref&gt;Kabay, P.D. (2008) ''A Defense of Trivialism''. Phd Thesis, School of Philosophy, Anthropology, and Social Inquiry, The University of Melbourne pages 32–35&lt;/ref&gt; Kabay also mentions a fifteen century Roman Catholic cardinal Nicholas of Cusa, stating that what Cusa wrote in ''De Docta Ignorantia'' is interpreted as stating that God contained every fact, which Kabay argues would result in trivialism, but Kabay admits that mainstream Cusa scholars would not agree with interpreting Cusa as a trivialist.&lt;ref&gt;Kabay, pages 36–37&lt;/ref&gt; Kabay also mentions Spinoza as a philosopher whose views resemble trivialism. Kabay argues Spinoza was a trivialist because Spinoza believed everything was made of one substance which had infinite attributes.&lt;ref&gt;Kabay, pages 37–40&lt;/ref&gt; Kabay also mentions Hegel as a philosophers whose views resemble trivialism, quoting Hegel as stating in ''The Science of Logic'' "everything is inherently contradictory."&lt;ref&gt;Kabay, pages 40–41. [https://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/bitstream/handle/11343/35203/117801_A%20Defense%20of%20Trivialismelectronic.pdf?sequence=1 A Defense of Trivialism]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Azzouni===
[[Jody Azzouni]] is a purported advocate of trivialism in his article ''The Strengthened Liar'' by claiming that [[natural language]] is [[Triviality (mathematics)|trivial]] and inconsistent through the existence of the [[liar paradox]] ("This sentence is false"), and claiming that natural language has developed without central direction. It is heavily implied by Azzouni that every sentence in any natural language is true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kabay|first=Paul|title=A defense of trivialism|url=http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/5734|work=PhD thesis, School of Philosophy, Anthropology, and Social Inquiry|page=42|quote=...According to Azzouni, natural language is trivial, that is to say, every sentence in natural language is true...And, of course, trivialism follows straightforwardly from the triviality of natural language: after all, 'trivialism is true' is a sentence in natural language...|publisher=The University of Melbourne, Research Collections (UMER)|accessdate=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Troubles with Trivialism"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bueno |first1=O.

===Anaxagoras===
The Greek philosopher [[Anaxagoras]] is suggested as a possible trivialist by [[Graham Priest]] in his 2005 book ''Doubt Truth to Be a Liar''. Priest writes, "He held that, at least at one time, everything was all mixed up so that no predicate applied to any one thing more than a contrary predicate."&lt;ref name="Doubt truth" /&gt;

==Anti-trivialism==
[[File:Absolute anti-trivialism (or maximal logical nihilism) in symbolic logic.svg|thumb|Absolute anti-trivialism (or maximal logical nihilism) in [[First-order logic#Logical symbols|symbolic logic]]; Read as "given any proposition, it is neither a true or false proposition."]]

Luis Estrada-González in "Models of Possiblism and Trivialism" lists eight types of anti-trivialism (or non-trivialism) through the use of [[possible worlds]]:

: (AT0) [[Actualist]] minimal anti-trivialism: In the actual world, some propositions do not have a value of true or false.
: (AT1) Actualist absolute anti-trivialism: In the actual world, all propositions do not have a value of true or false.
: (AT2) Minimal anti-trivialism: In some worlds, some propositions do not have a value of true or false.
: (AT3) Pointed anti-trivialism (or minimal logical [[nihilism]]): In some worlds, every proposition does not have a value of true or false.
: (AT4) Distributed anti-trivialism: In every world, some propositions do not have a value of true or false.
: (AT5) Strong anti-trivialism: Some propositions do not have a value of true or false in every world.
: (AT6) Super anti-trivialism (or moderate logical nihilism): All propositions do not have a value of true or false at some world.
: (AT7) Absolute anti-trivialism (or maximal logical nihilism): All propositions do not have a value of true or false in every world.&lt;ref name="Models of Possibilism and Trivialism" /&gt;

The '''Tupi''' or '''Tupian language family''' comprises some 70 languages spoken in [[South America]], of which the best known are [[Old Tupi language|Tupi proper]] and [[Guarani language|Guarani]].

==Homeland and ''urheimat''==
Rodrigues (2007) considers the Proto-Tupian [[urheimat]] to be somewhere between the [[Guaporé River|Guaporé]] and [[Aripuanã]] rivers, in the [[Madeira River]] basin.&lt;ref name="SouthAmerica"/&gt; Much of this area corresponds to the modern-day state of [[Rondônia]], Brazil. 5 of the 10 Tupian branches are found in this area, as well as some [[Tupi–Guarani languages]] (especially [[Kawahíb language|Kawahíb]]), making it the probable [[urheimat]] of these languages and maybe of its speaking peoples. Rodrigues believes the [[Proto-Tupian language]] dates back to around 3,000 BC.

==History, members and classification==
When the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] arrived in [[Brazil]], they found that wherever they went along the vast coast of this newly discovered land, most natives spoke similar languages. [[Jesuit]] missionaries took advantage of these similarities, systematizing [[standard language|common standards]] then named ''[[lingua geral|línguas gerais]]'' ("general languages"), which were spoken in that region until the 19th century. The best known and most widely spoken of these languages was [[Old Tupi language|Old Tupi]], a modern descendent of which is still used today by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]] around the [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Rio Negro]] region, where it is known as ''[[Nheengatu language|Nheengatu]]'' ({{IPA|[ɲɛʔẽŋaˈtu]}}), or the "good language". However, the Tupi family also comprises other languages.

In the neighbouring Spanish colonies, [[Guarani language|Guarani]], another Tupian language closely related to Old Tupi, had a similar history, but managed to resist the spread of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] more successfully than Tupi resisted [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. Today, Guarani has 7 million speakers, and is one of the official languages of [[Paraguay]]. The Tupian family also includes several other languages with fewer speakers. These share irregular morphology with the [[Jê languages|Je]] and [[Carib languages|Carib]] families, and Ribeiro connects them all as a [[Je–Tupi–Carib]] family.&lt;ref&gt;Rodrigues A. D., 2000, "‘Ge–Pano–Carib’ X ‘Jê–Tupí–Karib’: sobre relaciones lingüísticas prehistóricas en Sudamérica", in L. Miranda (ed.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=0QcbAQAAIAAJ ''Actas del I Congreso de Lenguas Indígenas de Sudamérica,'' Tome I], Lima, Universidad Ricardo Palma, Facultad de lenguas modernas, p.&amp;nbsp;95-104.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rodrigues &amp; Cabral (2012) list 10 branches of Tupian, which cluster into Western Tupian and Eastern Tupian.&lt;ref name="SouthAmerica"&gt;Rodrigues, Aryon Dall'Igna, and Ana Suelly Arruda Câmara Cabral (2012).

Berlin: De Gruyter Mouton.&lt;/ref&gt; Within Western and Eastern Tupian, the most divergent branches are listed first, followed by the core branches.

{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2018}}
[[File:Typical North India Food Prepared for Rongmei Naga.jpg|thumb|A partially-eaten plate of Indian food. The food on the plate is called Uchchhishta (noun). The plate is said to be Uchchhishta (adjective).]]
'''Uchchhishta''' ({{lang-sa|उच्छिष्ट}}, Ucchiṣṭa),{{need-IPA|Sanskrit}} known by various regional terms, is an Indian and a Hindu concept related to food. Though the term has various meanings and has no exact parallel in English,&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Roy p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; it is generally translated in English as "leftovers"&lt;ref name="Olivelle354pp"&gt;Olivelle pp. 354-5&lt;/ref&gt; or "leavings",&lt;ref&gt;Khare p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; but with a denigratory aspect. Uchchhishta frequently denotes food scraps after a person has eaten. In a broader sense, it refers to the contamination by food or hand that has come in contact with saliva or the inside of someone's mouth. A person or plate is also said to be Uchchhishta, when he/it comes in contact with Uchchhishta food.&lt;ref name="Olivelle354pp"/&gt; Uchchhishta food as well as the Uchchhishta eater/utensil are considered ritually impure. The eater is purified by washing his hand (Hindus traditionally eat with their fingers) and mouth.

It is highly disrespectful to offer Uchchhishta to someone in general, however it is acceptable to eat Uchchhishta of socially superior individuals, among other exceptions. While an offering of Uchchhishta food or by a person in the Uchchhishta state to Hindu divinities is forbidden in classical Hinduism, some heterodox [[Tantra|Tantric]] deities are worshipped with the taboo offering.

==Concept==
[[File:Leftovers.JPG|thumb|Leftovers of an Indian curry on a plate. The leftovers are called Uchchhishta (noun); the plate is described as Uchchhishta (adjective)]] 

The Monier-Williams Sanskrit dictionary defines Uchchhishta as: "left, rejected, stale, spit out of the mouth (as remnants of food); one who has still the remains of food in the mouth or hands, one who has not washed his hands and mouth and therefore is considered impure, impure; leavings, fragments, remainder (especially of a sacrifice or of food)".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/2014/web/webtc/servepdf.php?page=173|title=MW Cologne Scan|website=www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de|access-date=8 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/2014/web/webtc/servepdf.php?page=174|title=MW Cologne Scan|website=www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de|access-date=8 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Medhātithi|Medhatithi]] (c. 850–1050 CE), one of the oldest and most famous commentators of the Hindu law book ''[[Manusmriti]]'' lists the meanings of Uchchhishta:&lt;ref name="Olivelle354pp"/&gt; 
* Primary meaning: contamination by food or hand that has come in contact the inside of someone's mouth
* Pollution due to contact with "the eater, the eaten food" or the plate on which someone has eaten
* leftover food on someone's plate, after he has eaten
* leftover food in the serving vessel after everyone is served
* a person who has passed human waste, before purification

While Uchchhishta is related to leftovers and contact with saliva, Uchchhishta should be differentiated from other terms also translated in English as "impure": ''Amedhya'' ("unfit for sacrifice") refers to contamination by contact to human waste, corpses, decomposition etc. and ''malina'' ("stained") refers to pollution by physical dirt.&lt;ref name="Davis220"&gt;Olivelle &amp; Davis Jr, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other bodily substances like sweat, saliva is considered to be part of body and also not part of it, that is, of "uncertain status". Thus, contact with saliva, Uchchhishta, is regarded as impure.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;Smith p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Manusmriti'' however does not regard saliva defiling in general, but only in the food context. Drops of saliva, which transmit from one person to another while speaking, are not treated impure.&lt;ref name="Davis225"&gt;Olivelle &amp; Davis Jr, p. 225&lt;/ref&gt;

The precept of not contaminating all the food or a drink with bacteria or viruses in one's saliva is of particular concern as the health of someone could be threatened through cross contamination.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Gadia p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

A medieval [[Siddhar]] mocks the concept of Uchchhishta. He questions how are the flowers offered to Hindu deities or honey not defiled by saliva of bees and the cow's milk by the saliva of the calf.&lt;ref&gt;Dundes p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules==
Uchchhista is generally regarded as highly polluting and impure in Hinduism.&lt;ref name="Olivelle354pp"/&gt; Hindus view Uchchhista with revulsion.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Dundes p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;  Eating Uchchhista is considered as humiliating;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; a Kannada proverb says that he is a dog who eats Uchchhista.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Offering Uchchhista to a higher [[Caste system in India|caste]] member is considered as his insult.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Dundes p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; 

People usually do not dip, serve or accept food with the fingers or cutlery that has touched someone's mouth. While cooking also, the cook does not taste food and use the same utensil to stir the food. Once food is tasted with a utensil, it is put away to wash. Food which has been dipped with fingers and cutlery used for eating is considered Uchchhista.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; While sharing or eating dry food or fruits, the food is portioned so that it does not become contaminated by someone's saliva.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For the same reason, Hindus do not generally drink from each other's water glasses.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Dundes p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the early 20th century, use of spoons or forks and metal plates were not used by orthodox Hindus as they had come in contact with one's mouth and thus could not be reused as they remained Uchchhista, even though cleaned. One-use leaf plates were preferred; Hindus traditionally eat with their fingers, without cutlery.&lt;ref&gt;Dundes pp. 110–1&lt;/ref&gt;

Uchchhishta is acceptable to be eaten by socially inferior individuals: one's servants, lower caste persons, beggars and animals.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Khare p. 234&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Dalit|Untouchables]]" including [[Manual scavenging|Castes handling human waste]] historically used to live on leftovers.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Eating someone's Uchchhista is seen as a sign of submission and acceptance of the person's superiority.&lt;ref name="Davis439" /&gt;

In modern India, the rules of Uchchhista are relaxed in the cases of intimacy of a couple or a family.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Eating the Uchchhishta food of a young child by his parents is also acceptable, as the child is not regarded a fully-grown separate individual.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt; Parents usually feed young children from their own plate.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

In contrast of the general negative connotations associated with it, eating some types of Uchchhista like of a husband by a wife, of a guru by the student and of a sacrifice or divine offering by all, is highly regarded.&lt;ref name="Olivelle354pp" /&gt; [[Prasad]], food offered to a deity and having "eaten" by the deity, is sometimes considered the Uchchhista of the gods, as in some parts of North India; however other times as in parts of South India, the comparison of the sacred prasad to Uchchhista, is frowned upon.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Davis439"&gt;Olivelle &amp; Davis Jr, pp. 439–40&lt;/ref&gt;

A husband is considered equivalent to God for a Hindu wife. As such, wife can eat his Uchchhista as a sign of her love and submission.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The wife may eat in the same leaf as the husband's, after he finishes. The husband will leave some food in his plate for her to eat, as a symbol of his love.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The custom is ritually performed first at the time of marriage.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  This act is said to signify her integration in her new family. It is also acceptable if the wife eats the Uchchhista of her in-laws or her husband's brothers.&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;

[[File:Shukracharya and Kacha.jpg|thumb|upright|A student bows to his guru. The student is prescribed to eat the guru's Uchchhishta, which is described variously as sacred and medicinal.]]
The ''[[Apastamba Dharmasutra]]'' (1st-millennium BCE), while describing the code of conduct for a student, refers to the concept of Uchchhishta. In ancient times, a student would stay with a teacher ([[guru]]) in the latter's house ([[Gurukula]]) and learn. In this period, a student should ask for alms for his livelihood, which he should not consider as Uchchhishta. A student is prescribed to not leave any food uneaten in his plate, that is, leave no Uchchhishta. However, if any Uchchhishta remains, he should bury it, throw it in the water or give it away to a [[Shudra]] (a member from the lower social strata). The student is prescribed to eat the Uchchhishta of his guru, which are regarded as sacred as a sacrificial oblation. Eating Uchchhishta of one's father or brother is also acceptable.&lt;ref name="Olivelle11pp"&gt;Olivelle pp. 11-2&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Vasishtha|Vasishtha Dharmasutra]]'' regards the Uchchhista of the guru, equivalent to medicine that an ill student should have.&lt;ref name="Olivelle311pp"&gt;Olivelle pp. 311&lt;/ref&gt;

Exceptions to Uchchhishta are given in the ''Vasishtha Dharmasutra''. Food remnants stuck in teeth or food currently in the mouth are not considered impure, as they are treated part of the mouth like teeth. Swallowing the same cleanses the individual. While pouring water for someone to drink, if drops of water fall on the person's feet; the drops are not Uchchhista, but considered part of the ground.&lt;ref name="Davis225" /&gt;

The concept of Uchchhishta focuses on purification by washing one's hands and mouth after eating.&lt;ref name="Davis220" /&gt; The cleansing is extended to the kitchen so that so no trace of Uchchhishta or cooking of the meal before, is left.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Association with Hindu deities ==
[[File:Kalighat Matangi.jpg|thumb|The Hindu goddess Matangi is offered the taboo Uchchhishta food by the devotee in the ritually impure Uchchhishta state, with unwashed mouth and hands.]]
Offering Uchchhishta food to Hindu deities or worship by an Uchchhishta person is prohibited in mainstream Hinduism. However, the esoteric [[Tantra|Tantric]] goddess [[Matangi]] is recommended to be offered Uchchhishta food, in the polluted Uchchhishta state, with the remains of food in the mouth and hands; Matangi is associated with pollution and the outcaste and embodies the forbidden transgression of social norms.&lt;ref&gt;Kinsley pp. 214–6&lt;/ref&gt; The goddess in a legend from the ''Shaktisamgama-tantram'' is also said to be born from Uchchhishta. The deity couples of [[Shiva]]-[[Parvati]] and [[Vishnu]]-[[Lakshmi]] dropped specks of food on the ground while eating. A divine maiden rose from the Uchchhishta and asked for their Uchchhishta. The deities blessed her and gave her the name Uchchhishta-Matangini (Matangi).&lt;ref&gt;Kinsley p. 213&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Tantric deity worshipped in the impure Uchchhishta state is [[Uchchhishta Ganapati]] – a Tantric form of the elephant-headed god [[Ganesha]] – who also derives his name from Uchchhishta.&lt;ref name="grewal"&gt;Grewal pp. 122–3&lt;/ref&gt;

While Matangi is offered human Uchchhishta, the goddess [[Vimala Temple|Vimala]] is offered divine Uchchhishta of the god [[Jagannath]], a form of Vishnu. Vimala is the Tantric consort of Jagannath and the guardian goddess of the [[Jagannath Temple, Puri|Jagannath Temple]], [[Puri]] – the principal temple of the god. Vimala is said to be survive of the Uchchhishta of Jagannath; vegetarian food offerings to Jagannath are offered to Vimala, after which they are sanctified as [[Mahaprasad (Jagannath Temple)|Mahaprasad]] (prasad). A legend justifies this tradition. Once, Shiva ate a food grain, the Uchchhishta of Vishnu as the latter's prasad. Half the grain stuck in Shiva's bread; however the sage [[Narada]] noticed it and ate it. Parvati, was upset that her rightful share of Vishnu's prasad had been eaten by Narada. In a peeved mood, she went to Vishnu and complained. Vishnu pacified her saying that in the [[Kali Yuga]] (the present era as per Hindu beliefs), she would live at Puri as Vimala, and would daily eat the remnants of his food.&lt;ref name="Bimala"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tripathy|first=Shrinibas|date=September 2009|title=Goddess Bimala at Puri|url=http://Odisha.gov.in/e-magazine/Odishareview/2009/September/engpdf/66-69.pdf|journal=Odisha Review|publisher=Government of Odisha e-Magazine|pages=66–69|accessdate=23 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In later versions of the [[Hindu Epic|Hindu epic]] ''[[Ramayana]]'', [[Shabari]], a forest dweller woman, is instructed by her guru to wait for the arrival of the god [[Rama]] in her hermitage. She daily collects wild berries tasting them once for sourness, keeping only the sweet ones and discarding the bitter ones so that she could offer the god [[Rama]] only sweet berries, when he visits her. Unknowingly, the berries become Uchchhishta. Over time, she ages to an elderly woman. When Rama finally visits her hermitage, Shabari offers him the Uchchhishta berries. [[Lakshmana]], Rama's brother, objects to the impurity of the Uchchhishta berries, unworthy to be eaten. However, Rama accepts the Uchchhishta berries, as they offered it with great love and devotion.&lt;ref&gt;Khare p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keshavadas pp. 121–5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
In the Kathmandu valley of Nepal there are several important Newar temples dedicated to different forms of Vajrayogini.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Iconography of Nepalese Buddhism|first=Min Bahadur|last=Shakya|publisher=Handicraft Association of Nepal|date=1994|location=Kathmandu}}&lt;/ref&gt; These temples include the [[Sankhu Bajrayogini Temple|Sankhu Vajrayogini temple]], Vidhyeshvari Vajrayogini temple, Parping Vajrayogini temple,   Pulchowk Khagayogini temple and the [[Guhyeshwari Temple|Guhyeshwari temple]].&lt;ref name=Sankhu&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Sacred Town of Sankhu:The Anthropology of Newar Ritual, Religion and Society in Nepal|first=Bal Gopal |last=Shrestha| pp=415 |publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|date=2012|location=Newcastle upon Tyne|isbn=978-0861713295}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="EEnglishPreface"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vajrayoginī:Her Visualizations, Rituals, &amp; Forms|first=Elizabeth |last=English|pp=xxvii-xxviii |publisher=Wisdom Publications|date=2002|location=Boston|isbn=978-1443837705}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vīdyādharī, the 'Knowledge Holder', is the presiding deity of this temple.&lt;ref name="RBeer"&gt;{{cite web |first=Robert|last=Beer|title=Vidyadhari Akash Yogini (description) |url= http://www.tibetanart.com/Product.asp?PID=304 |access-date=2016-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Temple is an important pilgrimage place for [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhists]] and there is a recently constructed Tibetan Buddhist temple nearby. [[Hinduism in Nepal|Nepali Hindus]] regard the place as a sacred [[Shakti Peetha|Shaktipeeth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.karma99.com/2013/04/holy-shaktipeeths-in-nepal.htm|title=List of Holy Shaktipeeths in Nepal|access-date=2016-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Hindu]] devi temple of [[Sobha Baghwati]] stands nearby.

==Architecture==
{{Expand section|date=July 2016}}
The main three storied [[Newa architecture|Newa]] [[pagoda]] style temple is the NW corner of the [[Bahal, Nepal|bahal]] courtyard which has a gateway facing the river.

==Images==
In the temple the main image (idol) is of Akash Yogini flying through the sky, her right leg bent up at the knee behind her, and her left leg is pulled up against her breasts with her left arm. Her right arm is behind her holding a [[vajra]] above the sole of her right foot. In the crook of her right arm she holds a [[khaṭvāṅga]]  staff which rests on her left shoulder. This image is about 18 inches high.&lt;ref name="Dowman2007" /&gt;

'''World music''' (also called '''global music''' or '''international music'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/12/13/370303259/best-global-music-of-2014|title=Best Global Music Of 2014|last=Tsioulcas|first=Anastasia|date=December 13, 2014|website=''[[NPR#Digital media|NPR]]''|access-date=July 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a musical category encompassing many different styles of music from around the globe, which includes many [[music genre|genres]] including some forms of [[Western culture#Music|Western music]] represented by [[folk music]], as well as selected forms of ethnic music, [[indigenous music]], neotraditional music, and music where more than one cultural tradition, such as ethnic music and Western [[popular music]], intermingle.

World music's inclusive nature and elasticity as a musical category may pose for some obstacles to a universal definition, but its ethic of interest in the culturally exotic is encapsulated in ''[[fRoots|Roots]]'' magazine's description of the genre as "local music from out there".&lt;ref&gt;Chris Nickson. ''The NPR Curious Listener's Guide to World Music''. Grand Central Press, 2004.  pp 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was popularized in the 1980s as a marketing category for non-Western traditional music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Erlmann, Veit|year=1996| title=Aesthetics of the Global Imagination: Reflections on World Music in the 1990s|journal=Public Culture|volume=8|issue=3|pages=467–488}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Discourse of World Music |author=Frith, Simon|editor=Born and Hesmondhalgh|year=2000|publisher=University of California Press|booktitle=Western Music and Its Others: Difference, Representation, and Appropriation in Music}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Globalization]] has facilitated the expansion of world music's audiences and scope.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} It has grown to include hybrid subgenres such as world fusion, global fusion, ethnic fusion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/ethnic-fusion-d224 |title=Ethnic fusion Music |publisher=Allmusic |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[worldbeat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/worldbeat-d248 |title=Worldbeat |publisher=Allmusic |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nationalgeographic1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://worldmusic.nationalgeographic.com/view/page.basic/genre/content.genre/world_fusion_800/en_US#contents_top |title=World Fusion Music |publisher=worldmusic.nationalgeographic.com |date= |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314022819/http://worldmusic.nationalgeographic.com/view/page.basic/genre/content.genre/world_fusion_800/en_US#contents_top |archivedate=2012-03-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
[[File:Delhi 2 Dublin in 2012.jpg|thumb|right|260px|[[Delhi 2 Dublin]] in 2012]]
The term has been credited to [[ethnomusicologist]] [[Robert E.

|title=What Is World Music? |publisher=people.iup.edu |date=December 1994 |accessdate=2014-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several conflicting definitions for world music. One is that it consists of "all the music in the world", though such a broad definition renders the term virtually meaningless.&lt;ref&gt;Bohlman, Philip (2002). ''World Music: A Very Short Introduction'', "Preface". {{ISBN|0-19-285429-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nidel 2004, p.3&lt;/ref&gt;

The term also is taken as a classification of music that combines [[Western world|Western]] popular music styles with one of many [[music genre|genres]] of non-Western music that are also described as [[folk music]] or [[ethnic music]]. However, world music is not exclusively traditional folk music. It may include cutting edge [[pop music]] styles as well. Succinctly, it can be described as "local music from out there",&lt;ref&gt;''[[fRoots]]'' magazine, quoted in N'Dour 2004, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; or "someone else's local music".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Songlines]]'' magazine&lt;/ref&gt; It is a very nebulous term with an increasing number of genres that fall under the umbrella of world music to capture musical trends of combined ethnic style and texture, including Western elements (examples noted in this section).

World music may incorporate distinctive non-Western [[musical scale|scales]], [[musical mode|modes]] and/or musical [[Inflection (music)|inflections]], and often features distinctive traditional [[ethnic instrument]]s, such as the [[kora (instrument)|kora]] (West African [[harp]]), the [[steel drum]], the [[sitar]] or the [[didgeridoo]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GESNLHsUzDk&amp;list=PLcpIAFes_O8tlwlWiAiySStan1b9D3sx6&amp;index=21 Skyphos Songs] by [[Elena Frolova]] on poetry by [[Marina Tsvetaeva]] using reconstructed ancient angular harp found in [[Altai mountains]] in Siberia&lt;/ref&gt;

Music from around the world exerts wide cross-cultural influence as styles naturally influence one another, and in recent years world music has also been marketed as a successful genre in itself. Academic study of world music, as well as the musical genres and individual artists associated with it appear in such disciplines as [[anthropology]], [[folkloristics]], [[performance studies]] and [[ethnomusicology]].

===Evolving terminology===
[[File:Anda Union-1.JPG|thumb|right|180px|Anda Union at a music festival]]
In the age of [[digital music|digital music production]] the increased availability of high-quality, ethnic music [[music sampling|samples]], [[sound bites]] and [[music loops|loops]] from every known region are commonly used in [[pop music|commercial]] [[music production]], which has exposed a vast spectrum of indigenous music texture to developing, [[independent music|independent artists]]. These influences proliferate quickly in a web-based music industry that is now percolating as a much larger, predominantly self-promoted menu, via an increasing number of [[independent music|indie-artist]]-friendly, [[music streaming|streaming]] [[Internet]] options, such as [[Last.fm]], [[Rhapsody (online music service)|Rhapsody]], [[Live365]], Jango Artist Airplay and [[ReverbNation.com|ReverbNation]].

An amalgamation of [[Folk music|roots music]] in the global, [[contemporary music|contemporary]] listening palette has become apparent, which weakens the role major entertainment labels can play in the cultural perception of genre boundaries. As a result, definitions of the genre have become particularly varied, and determined by particularly wide-ranging and varied opinions.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Similar terminology between distinctly different sub-categories under primary music genres, such as world, rock and pop can be as ambiguous and confusing to industry moguls as it is to consumers. This is especially true in the context of world music, where branches of ethnically influenced pop trends are as genre-defined by consumer perception as they are by the music industry forums that govern the basis for categorical distinction. Academic scholars tend to agree that, in today's world of consumer music reviews and [[blogging]], global music culture's public perception is what ultimately distils a prevailing basis for definition from genre ambiguity, regardless of how clearly a category has been outlined by corporate [[marketing]] forums and music [[journalism]]. The world music genre's gradual migration from a clear spectrum of [[Folk music|roots music]] traditions to an extended list of hybrid subgenres is a good example of the motion genre boundaries can exhibit in a [[globalization|globalizing]] [[pop culture]].

The classic, original definition of world music was in part created to instill a perceived authenticity and distinction between indigenous music traditions and those that eventually become diluted by pop culture, and the [[debate|modern debate]] over how possible it is to maintain that perception in the richly diverse genre of world music is ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sibetrans.com/trans/a300/new-perspectives-in-ethnomusicology-a-critical-survey |title=New Perspectives in Ethnomusicology: A Critical Survey |publisher=Society of Ethnomusicology |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/collective/A2526815 |title=Origins of World Music |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a report on the 2014 ''globalFEST'' National Public Radio's Anastasia Tsioulcas said  "Even within the "world music" community, nobody likes the term "world music." It smacks of all kinds of loaded issues, from cultural colonialism to questions about what's "authentic" and what isn't (and who might get to police such inquiries), and forces an incredible array of styles that don't have anything in common under the label of "exotic Other." What's more: I believe that in many people's imaginations, "world music" means a kind of fairly awful, gloppy, hippy-ish, worldbeat fusion. It's a problematic, horrible term that satisfies absolutely no one."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/01/16/263081652/what-makes-globalfest-so-interesting|title=What Makes globalFEST So Interesting?|last=Tsioulcas|first=Anastasia|date=January 16, 2014|publisher=[[NPR]]|accessdate=January 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forms==
[[File:Alan Stivell - Jeudis du port 2013.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Alan Stivell in concert at [[Brest, France|Brest]] ([[Brittany]]), 2013]]
Examples of popular forms of world music include the various forms of non-European classical music (e.g. [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[koto (musical instrument)|koto]] and [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] [[guzheng]] music, [[India]]n [[raga]] music, [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] [[music of Tibet|chants]]), [[music of Eastern Europe|Eastern European folk music]] (e.g. the village music of the [[Balkans]], [[Bulgarian State Television Female Vocal Choir|The Mystery Of The Bulgarian Voices]]), [[Nordic folk music]] and the many forms of folk and tribal music of the [[Middle East]], [[Africa]], [[Asia]], [[Oceania]], [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]], Latin music, and [[Indonesian music]].

The broad category of world music includes isolated forms of ethnic music from diverse geographical regions. These dissimilar strains of ethnic music are commonly categorized together by virtue of their indigenous roots.  Over the 20th century, the invention of [[sound recording]], low-cost international air travel and common access to global communication among artists and the general public has given rise to a related phenomenon called "[[crossover (music)|crossover]]" music. Musicians from diverse cultures and locations could readily access recorded music from around the world, see and hear visiting musicians from other cultures and visit other countries to play their own music, creating a melting pot of stylistic influences. While communication technology allows greater access to obscure forms of music, the pressures of commercialization also present the risk of increasing musical homogeneity, the blurring of regional identities, and the gradual extinction of traditional local music-making practices.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

==Hybrid examples==
[[File:Vampire Weekend Red Rocks 05.20.13.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Vampire Weekend]] performing at [[Red Rocks Amphitheatre]] in 2013]]
Since the music industry established this term, the fuller scope of what an average music consumer defines as "world" music in today's market has grown to include various blends of ethnic music tradition, style and interpretation,&lt;ref name="nationalgeographic1"/&gt; and derivative world music genres have been coined to represent these hybrids, such as World fusion, Global fusion, Ethnic fusion or [[Worldbeat]]. Good examples of hybrid, world fusion are the [[Irish folk music|Irish]] / [[West African music|West African]] meld of [[Afro Celt Sound System]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/afro-celt-sound-system-p200387 |title=Afro Celt Sound System |publisher=Allmusic |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the pan-cultural sound of [[AO Music]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/artist/aomusic-p2335411 |title=Aomusic |publisher=Allmusic |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[jazz]] / [[Finnish folk music|Finnish folk]] music of [[Värttinä]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/vrttin-p42219 |title=Värttinä |publisher=Allmusic |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; each of which bear tinges of [[Popular music|contemporary]], [[pop music|Western]] influence—an increasingly noticeable element in the expansion genres of world music. World fusion / Worldbeat / Ethnic fusion / Global fusion can also blend specific indigenous sounds with more blatant elements of [[pop music|Western pop]]. Good examples are [[Paul Simon]]'s album ''[[Graceland (album)|Graceland]]'', on which South African [[Mbaqanga]] music is heard, [[Peter Gabriel]]'s work with Pakistani [[Sufi]] singer, [[Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan]], the [[Deep Forest]] project, in which vocal loops from [[West Africa]] are blended with Western, contemporary rhythmic textures and [[harmony|harmony structure]], and the work of [[Mango (singer)|Mango]], who combined pop and rock music with world elements.

More recent bands who exhibit experimentation with World music Hybrid Forms include [[Vampire Weekend]], [[The Very Best]], Island Cassettes &amp; [[Yeasayer]], many of which cite inspiration from the work of Paul Simon.

Depending on style and context, world music can sometimes share the [[new-age music]] genre, which is a category that often includes [[Ambient music]] and textural expressions from indigenous [[Folk music|roots]] sources. Good examples are [[Singing bowl|Tibetan bowls]], [[Tuvan throat singing]], [[Gregorian music|Gregorian chant]] or [[Native American flute]] music. World music blended with new-age music is a sound, loosely classified as the hybrid genre, ethnic fusion.  Examples of ethnic fusion are [[Nicholas Gunn]]'s "Face-to-Face" from ''Beyond Grand Canyon,'' featuring authentic Native American flute combined with synthesizers, and "Four Worlds" from ''The Music of the Grand Canyon'', featuring spoken word from Razor Saltboy of the [[Navajo Nation|Navajo Indian Nation]].

===World fusion===
The subgenre '''world fusion''' is often mistakenly assumed to refer exclusively to a blending of Western [[jazz fusion]] elements with world music. Although such a hybrid expression falls easily into the world fusion category, the suffix "fusion" in the term world fusion should not be assumed to mean only jazz fusion. Western jazz combined with strong elements of world music is more accurately termed ''world fusion jazz'', ''[[Ethno-jazz|ethnic jazz]]'' or ''non-Western jazz''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/world-fusion-d185 |title=World Fusion |publisher=allmusic.com |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; World fusion and global fusion are nearly synonymous with the genre term ''[[worldbeat]]'', and though these are considered subgenres of popular music, they may also imply universal expressions of the more general term, ''world music''.&lt;ref name="nationalgeographic1"/&gt; Throughout the 1970s and 80s, [[Jazz fusion|fusion]] in the [[jazz music]] genre implied a blending of jazz and [[rock music]], which is where the misleading assumption is rooted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/d299 |title=Fusion |publisher=allmusic.com |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular non-Western genres==
Although it primarily describes traditional music, the world music category also includes popular music from non-Western urban communities (e.g. [[South Africa]]n [[Township music|"township" music]]) and non-European music forms that have been influenced by other so-called third-world musics (e.g. [[Afro-Cuban music]]), although Western-style popular song sourced from non-English-speaking countries in [[Europe]] (e.g. [[French pop music]]) would not generally be considered world music.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}&lt;!--By whom, and who says so?--&gt;

[[Paris]] is one of the great European capitals for world music.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} For many years, the city has attracted numerous musicians from former colonies in [[West Africa|West]] and [[North Africa]]. This scene is aided by the fact that there are many concerts and institutions that help to promote the music.

[[Algeria]]n and [[Morocco|Moroccan]] music have an important presence in the French capital. Hundreds of thousands of Algerian and Moroccan immigrants have settled in Paris, bringing the sounds of [[Amazigh]] (Berber), [[raï]], and [[Gnawa music]]. Algerian raï also found a large French audience.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

The West African community is also very large, integrated by people from [[Senegal]], [[Mali]], [[Ivory Coast]], and [[Guinea]]. They have introduced [[Manding languages|manding]] [[Griot|jeli]] music, [[mbalax]] and other styles.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

== After 1987: Women and beyond ==
One origin of the term was the initiation of {{lang|fr|[[Fête de la Musique]]}} ("World Music Day") in 1982 in France. World Music Day has been celebrated on 21 June every year since then. On 29 June 1987 a meeting of interested parties gathered to capitalize on the marketing of this genre.  Arguably popular interest was sparked with the release in 1986 of [[Paul Simon]]'s ''[[Graceland (album)|Graceland]]'' album.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}&lt;!--Who so argues?--&gt; The concept behind the album was to express his own sensibilities using the sounds he had fallen in love with while listening to artists from Southern Africa, including [[Ladysmith Black Mambazo]] and [[Savuka]]. This project and the work of [[Peter Gabriel]] and [[Johnny Clegg (musician)|Johnny Clegg]] among others had, to some degree, introduced non-Western music to a wider audience. They saw this as an opportunity. [[Zila Khan]] is one of today's leading singers in World Music.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Before 1987, world music had a following but it was still difficult for interested parties to sell their music to the larger music stores.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}  Although specialist music stores had been important in developing the genre over many years, the record companies, broadcasters and journalists had been finding it difficult to build a following because the music, itself, seemed too scarce. However, they were aware that the [[jazz]] and classical markets had developed a crossover audience. They decided the best way forward would be a collective strategy to bring the music to a wider audience.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

At around this time, [[Cultural Co-operation]] started the Music Village Festival. This regular series of free world music festivals continues to run. They also started a network of world music artists to help promote their work.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

===1987 meeting===
At the outset of the 1987 meeting, the musician Roger Armstrong advised the reason why something had to be done:
{{quote|[He] felt that the main problem in selling our kind of material lay with the UK retail outlets and, specifically, the fact that they did not know how to rack it coherently. This discouraged [the retail stores] from stocking the material in any depth and made it more difficult for the record buyers to become acquainted with our catalogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.frootsmag.com/content/features/world_music_history/minutes/page03.html | title = Minutes of Meeting Between the Various 'World Music' Record Companies and Interested Parties, Monday 29 June 1987 | work = [[fRoots]] magazine | accessdate  = 2010-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The first concern of the meetings was to select the umbrella name that this music would be listed under. Suggestions included "world beat" and prefixing words such as "hot" or "tropical" to existing genre titles. "World music" won after a show of hands, but initially it was not meant to be the title for a whole new genre—but just something the record labels could place on record sleeves to distinguish them during the forthcoming campaign. Afterward, they agreed that despite the publicity campaign, this wasn't an exclusive club—and that for the good of all, any label that sold this type of music could use the name.

Another issue was the distribution methods at the time. Most main labels were unhappy with the lack of specialist knowledge in their sales force, which led to poor service. Many larger outlets were reluctant to carry the music, because they favored larger releases they could promote within the store. It was difficult to justify a large presentation expense with limited stock going into stores.

==Marketing==
One of the marketing strategies used in the [[gramophone record|vinyl]] market at the time was the use of browser cards, which would appear in the record racks. As part of the "world music" campaign, it was decided that these would be a two color affair designed to carry a special offer package; to aid the retailer a selection of labels would also be included, presumably for shelf or rack edging.

In an unprecedented move, all of the world music labels coordinated together and developed a compilation cassette for the cover of the music magazine ''[[NME]]''. The overall running time was 90 minutes, each package containing a mini-catalog showing the other releases on offer.

By the time of a second meeting it became clear that a successful campaign required its own dedicated press officer. The press officer would be able to juggle various deadlines and sell the music as a concept—not just to national stations, but also regional [[DJ]]s keen to expand their musical variety. DJs were a key resource as it was important to make "world music" important to people outside London—most regions after all had a similarly heritage to tap into. A cost-effective way of achieving all this would be a leafleting campaign.

The next step was to develop a world music chart, gathering together selling information from around fifty shops, so that it would finally be possible to see which were big sellers in the genre—so new listeners could see what was particularly popular. It was agreed that the ''NME'' could again be involved in printing the chart and also ''[[Music Week]]'' and the London [[listings magazine]] ''[[City Limits (magazine)|City Limits]]''. It was also suggested that [[Andy Kershaw]] might be persuaded to do a run down of this chart on his show regularly.

== Relationship to immigration and multiculturalism ==
{{further|Music of Canadian cultures}}
In most wealthy industrialized countries, large amounts of immigration from other regions has been ongoing for many decades. This has introduced non-Western music to Western audiences not only 
as "exotic" imports, but also as local music played by fellow citizens. [[Caribbean music in the United Kingdom]] or [[Chicano rock]] in the United States would be two obvious examples.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}&lt;!--Who says so, and what condition prevents them from actually being so?--&gt;  But the process is ongoing and continues to produce new forms.  In the 2010s several musicians from immigrant communities in the West rose to global popularity, such as Haitian-American [[Wyclef Jean]], Somali-Canadian [[K'naan]], Tamil-Briton [[M.I.A. (artist)|M.I.A.]], or Lebanese-Colombian [[Shakira]], often blending the music of their heritage with hip-hop or pop. Cuban-born singer-songwriter [[Addys Mercedes]] started her international career from Germany mixing traditional elements of Son with pop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.addysmercedes.com|title=Addys Mercedes - Addys Mercedes|website=www.addysmercedes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The diverse nature of major Western cities has changed the pace of musical intermixing.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}  Once, an established Western artist might collaborate with an established African artist to produce an album or two.  Now, new bands and new genres are built from the ground up by young performers.  For example, the [[Punjabi music|Punjabi]]-[[Irish folk music|Irish]] fusion band [[Delhi 2 Dublin]] is from neither India nor Ireland, but [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, Canada. [[Country for Syria]], an [[Istanbul]] based music collective, blends [[Country music|American Country music]] with the music of [[Refugees of the Syrian Civil War|Syrian refugees]] and local [[Turkish music (style)|Turkish music.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailysabah.com/expat-corner/2016/02/19/american-country-music-with-an-arabic-twist|title=American country music with an Arabic twist|newspaper=DailySabah|access-date=2017-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Vancouver,{{clarify|date=July 2014}}&lt;!--Vancouver, Washington, or Vancouver, BC?--&gt; musicians and composers also work collectively to create original compositions for various combinations of ethnic and western instruments.

==World Music Month==
The World Music Month was designated in October 1987.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} It is a music festival held at the Town &amp; Country Club in London, and it was the start of the winter season for both [[WOMAD]] and ''Arts Worldwide''. The main press release stressed the issues inherent in the campaign.{{Vague|date=July 2014}}&lt;!--And these issues were what, exactly?--&gt;{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Since the early 1980s the enthusiasm for music from 'outside' Western pop culture has been steadily mounting.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} More and more international artists, many of whom are big stars in their own countries, are coming to England and North America on tour. They started off, like the [[Bhundu Boys]], playing small clubs and pubs, but now many acts are so popular that they are filling larger venues.

Examples of radio shows that feature world music include ''[[World of Music (radio show)|World of Music]]'' on [[Voice of America]], ''Transpacific Sound Paradise'' on [[WFMU]], ''The Planet'' on Australia's [[ABC Radio National]], DJ Edu presenting ''D.N.A: DestiNation Africa'' on [[BBC Radio 1Xtra]], [[Adil Ray]] on the [[BBC Asian Network]], [[Andy Kershaw]]'s show on [[BBC Radio 3]] and [[Charlie Gillett]]'s show&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/programmes/wmusic.shtml |title=bbc.co.uk/worldservice/programmes/wmusic |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the [[BBC World Service]].

==2010s radio programs==

World music radio programs today often play [[Music of Africa|African]] hip hop or [[reggae]] artists, [[crossover (music)|crossover]] [[Bhangra (music)|Bhangra]] and [[Latin American]] jazz groups, etc.  Common media for world music include [[public radio]], [[webcasting]], the [[BBC]], [[National Public Radio|NPR]], and ABC ([[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]). The scope of what is considered world music has increased.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}  By default, non-region-specific or multi-cultural world music projects are often listed under the generic category of world music.

==Criticisms==
The generally accepted geographic standard for what designates world music is withstanding criticism for its universal asymmetry, where nearly every classifiable region under the term is defined, relative to [[Western culture|Western]] music culture; this is primarily due to the fact that dominant [[corporate structure]]s for music [[Record distribution|distribution]] and [[promotion (marketing)|promotion]] originate in {{nowrap| [[Europe]]}} and {{nowrap| [[North America]]}}, as do the forums for establishing industry genre categories.
Therefore, in market context, "ethnic" music is synthetically defined by a radius that extends from a Western center.

Some musicians and curators of music have come to dislike the term "world music".
To these critics, "world music" is a parochial, catch-all marketing term for non-Western music of all genres.
In {{nowrap| October 1999}}, {{nowrap| [[Luaka Bop]]}} label founder and ex-[[Talking Heads]] frontman [[David Byrne]] wrote an "{{nowrap|I Hate World Music}}" editorial in ''{{nowrap| [[The New York Times]]}}'' explaining his objections to the term. Byrne argued that the labelling and categorization of other cultures as "exotic" serves to attract an insincere consumption and deter other potential consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Byrne|first1=David|author-link1=David Byrne|title=Crossing Music's Borders In Search Of Identity; 'I Hate World Music'|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9901EED8163EF930A35753C1A96F958260,&amp;pagewanted=all|accessdate=15 December 2016|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=3 October 1999|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110415034428/http://www.davidbyrne.com/news/press/articles/I_hate_world_music_1999.php|archivedate=15 April 2011|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Awards for world music}}

The BBC Radio 3 Awards for World Music was an award given to world music artists between 2002 and 2008, sponsored by [[BBC Radio 3]]. The award was thought up by ''[[fRoots]]'' magazine's editor [[Ian A. Anderson|Ian Anderson]], inspired by the [[BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards]].  Award categories included:  Africa, Asia/Pacific, Americas, Europe, Mid East and North Africa, Newcomer, Culture Crossing, Club Global, Album of the Year, and Audience Award. Initial lists of nominees in each category were selected annually by a panel of several thousand industry experts.  Shortlisted nominees were voted on by a twelve-member jury, which selected the winners in every category except for the Audience Award category.  These jury members were appointed and presided over by the BBC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio3/worldmusic/a4wm2008/faq.shtml |title=Radio 3—Awards for World Music 2008 |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The annual awards ceremony was held at the [[BBC Proms]] and winners were given an award called a "Planet".  In March 2009, the BBC made a decision to axe the BBC Radio 3 Awards for World Music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article5940410.ece|title=Mystery of missing BBC music awards|last=Donovan|first=Paul|date=2009-03-22|accessdate=2009-03-21|publisher=The Sunday Times | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/mar/20/bbc-radio-3-world-music-awards|title=BBC axes Radio 3 Awards for World Music|last=Dowell|first=Ben|date=2009-03-20|accessdate=2009-03-21|publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the BBC's decision to end its awards program, the British world music magazine ''[[Songlines (magazine)|Songlines]]'' launched the Songlines Music Awards in 2009 "to recognise outstanding talent in world music".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.songlines.co.uk/music-awards/winners.php|title=Songlines - Music Awards - 2017 - winners|first=Songlines|last=Magazine|website=www.songlines.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[WOMEX Awards]] were introduced in 1999 to honor the high points of world music on an international level and to acknowledge musical excellence, social importance, commercial success, political impact and lifetime achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.womex.com/realwomex/main.php?id_headings=131&amp;id_realwomex=13&amp;subheading=156#artist|title=WOMEX Awards|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Every October at the WOMEX event, the award figurine—an ancient mother goddess statue dating back about 6000 years to the Neolithic age—is presented in an award ceremony to a worthy member of the world music community.

'''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'Yasik'''' is a term of South Korea's midnight snack culture.

Korea's top yasik favorites include: [[ramyeon]](라면), typically eaten with [[kimchi]], chicken and beer([[chimaek]], 치킨, 맥주), [[jokbal]] and [[bossam (food)|bossam]](족발, 보쌈), [[tteokbokki]] and [[sundae]] (떡볶기, 순대), [[gungoguma]](roasted sweet potatoes) and [[hoppang]](군고구마, 호빵).&lt;ref name=vk/&gt; [[Kimbap]] and [[jokbal]] is also popular. Past favorites, now less popular, include [[memilmuk]] (buckwheat jelly) and [[chapssaltteok]](rice cakes filled with sweet beans).&lt;ref name=vk/&gt; 

Fried chicken, first introduced in Korea in the 1980s, and pizza also top the list of night-time favorites. Fried chicken, in particular, has become a wide market, with chicken restaurant chains continually developing new sauces and wooing various Hallyu stars to promote their respective brands. Of course, no late-night chicken order would be complete without a cool pitcher of draft beer.&lt;ref name=vk&gt;{{cite web|title=Koreans’ Love of Yasik—where delivery is just a phone call away |url=http://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/AK/AK_EN_1_4_9_4.jsp|website=visitkorea|accessdate=14 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
