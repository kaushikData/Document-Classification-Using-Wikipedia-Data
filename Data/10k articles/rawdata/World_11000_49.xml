[[File:AMC - Sarkophag Armeni 2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A larnax from Armeni [http://chaniamuseum.culture.gr/en/ (Museum of Chania)]]]

'''Armeni''' is the archaeological site of an ancient [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] cemetery on [[Crete]], roughly eight kilometers south of the modern town of [[Rethymnon]].

==Site==
Armeni has been under excavation since 1969 by Dr. Yiannis Tzedakis.  Over 200 chamber tombs and one [[tholos tomb]] have been found. All date to the [[Minoan pottery|Late Minoan]] era.

The chambers are approached by entrance passages, or [[Glossary of architecture#D|dromos]], which start at ground level and descend to the entrance of the tomb. The tombs are not identical, with some having ramps while others have stairs. The walls of the dromos have been cut in such a way that they are closer to each other at the top than they are at the bottom, probably to help bear the weight of the earth above. The entrances were originally covered by a large stone, which is usually still next to the entrance. Several of the larger tombs have a pillar in the center of the chamber. One tomb's walls are lined with stone benches cut directly from the rock. 

== Artifacts ==
Artifacts from the chamber tombs include [[Minoan seal-stones|seal stone]]s, jewelry, bronze tools, stone vases, bronze vessels and pottery. Clay [[larnakes]], a type of small coffin, painted with double axes, hunting scenes, and [[Horns of Consecration]] were also excavated. These artifacts can be found at the [[Archeological Museum of Chania in Saint Francis Monastery|Archaeological Museum of Chania]] and the [[Rethymno]] Museum.

Over 500 skeletons have been excavated, yielding useful information about the diet of the Minoan people in this area.  They ate high [[carbohydrate]] diets but not much meat.

==Tourism==
The site is open to tourists, including entrance into several of the main rock-cut tombs. Automatic lighting has been installed. There is no entrance fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.minoancrete.com/armeni.htm|title=Minoan Crete -- Armeni Late Minoan cemetery|website=www.minoancrete.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ekspress AM4''' was a [[communications satellite]] placed into the wrong [[orbit]] from a faulty [[Briz-M]] [[Multistage rocket|rocket stage]]. This satellite was to be part of the [[Ekspress]] series of [[Geostationary orbit|geostationary]] communications satellites owned by [[Russian Satellite Communications Company|Russian State Company for Satellite Communications]]. The satellite was [[Atmospheric entry|de-orbited]] on 28 March 2012 into the Pacific Ocean, in spite of efforts of it being used for Antarctic [[broadband]] purposes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120720054857/http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2012/03/second-life-for-failed-russian-s.html?ref=em "Second Life for Failed Russian Satellite."] Retrieved 1 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there have been several satellites de-orbited over the years, Ekspress AM4 would have been able to provide broadband services to the Antarctic for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.space.com/15067-dead-russian-satellite-express-am4-mourned.html "Fiery Death of Wayward Russian Satellite Mourned by Company."] Retrieved 1 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- ??? --&gt;

== Launch ==
The Ekspress AM4 satellite was launched on 18 August 2011 on a Russian [[Proton (rocket family)|Proton rocket]] from [[Kazakhstan]], which included a Briz-M stage. It was just after launch that the Briz-M stage did not separate from the Ekspress satellite, causing it to fall into the wrong orbit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewnews.html?id=1626 "Repurposing Express-AM4: Mission Possible: Recycling Space Junk into Antarctic Science Treasure." ] Retrieved 1 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- this is wrong --&gt;

== Spacecraft ==
The total mass of the Ekspress AM4 satellite was 5,800&amp;nbsp;kg, and the [[spacecraft]] had 64 [[transponder]]s. The onboard antennas were capable of broadcasting in the [[C band (IEEE)|C]], [[Ku band|K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[L band|L]], and [[Ka band|Ka]] [[Electromagnetic spectrum|bands]]. The satellite's orbit was measured at 1,007 by 20,317&amp;nbsp;km altitude, with an [[Orbital inclination|inclination orbit]] of 51.3 degrees.  Though the satellite was placed in the wrong orbit, there was no damage to the satellite, meaning that it became the subject of numerous [[reuse]] proposals.

== Reuse proposals ==
One of the most notable{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} reuse proposals came from a company called Polar Broadband Systems, which was established in December 2011. Its objectives were to submit proposals for the reuse of semi-retired and retired satellites for use with communications over the Antarctic. The company notes that it would not have been feasible to build a dedicated satellite for the region as the population would not justify the expense, however Ekspress AM4 would suffice as it could have been maneuvered into the required orbit. There was enough fuel on board for it to be operational for ten years, with giving the Antarctic region 16 hours of broadband access a day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.space.com/12688-lost-russian-satellite-wrong-orbit.html "Lost Russian Communications Satellite Found in Wrong Orbit."] Retrieved 1 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

== Deorbit ==
Dennis Pivnyuk, [[chief financial officer]] of the Russian Satellite Communications Co, informed on 15 March 2012 that the satellite would be decommissioned and deorbited. He stated that the descent phase would start on 20 March, with the spacecraft [[atmospheric reentry|reentering]] over the Pacific Ocean around 26 March. The spacecraft was destroyed during reentry on 28 March.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uk.amsat.org/5893 "Dead Russian Satellite to Fall From Space."] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130223130916/http://www.uk.amsat.org/5893 |date=23 February 2013 }} Retrieved 1 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Forty Group''' was a Kenyan society or organisation of the mid-twentieth century constituted primarily of members of the [[Kenya African Union]] who joined with the aim of using violence to make their voice heard. The name is a translation of the [[Gikuyu language|Gĩkũyũ]] phrase '''Anake a 40''', which means '''The Young Men of 40'''. The organisation was also called '''Kiama kia 40''' translating to '''The [political] party of 40'''. The number 40 is a reference to the year 1940, in which most of the group's core members were [[Conscription|drafted]] into the British Armed Forces.

The organisation consisted mainly of men fresh from service in [[World War II]].

It was founded by [[Mwangi Macharia]] and gradually evolved into part of the [[Mau Mau]] rebellion of the 1950s.

[[Stanley Mathenge]] was one of the leaders of Forty Group.&lt;ref name="clough"&gt;Marshall S.

'''''Heiðarvíga saga''''' ({{Audio|Is-Heiðarvígarsaga.oga|listen}}) or '''''The Story of the Heath-Slayings''''' is one of the [[Icelanders' sagas]]. It is badly preserved; 12 leaves of the only surviving manuscript were destroyed along with their only copy in the [[Copenhagen Fire of 1728|fire of Copenhagen]] in 1728. The content of that part is only known through a summary written from memory by [[Jón Grunnvíkingur]] who had made the lost copy.

The saga has been taken by some scholars as possibly among the oldest Icelanders' sagas.

'''Hieraniony Castle''' is a ruined castle near the town of [[Hieraniony]] in [[Iwye District]], [[Belarus]]. It was constructed in the beginning of 16th century as the main residence of [[Albertas Goštautas]], one the most powerful noblemen in the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. Later it belonged to the [[House of Sapieha|Sapieha]] and [[House of Kiszka|Kiszka]] families. It was destroyed by the Russian army during the [[Russo-Polish War (1654–67)]].

In the early 19th century the castle, already considerably ruined, was mostly disassembled and the bricks were reused for buildings in the neighbouring towns. Earthworks survive, but are overgrown with trees. Both the castle and the church near it are Category II objects of national heritage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ivje.gov.by/ru/region/history/istkultcennost List of protected monuments on the official site of Iwye Rajon (in Belarusian).] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714123738/http://ivje.gov.by/ru/region/history/istkultcennost |date=2014-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Icelandic-utfor.jpg|thumb|White [[coffins]] are most commonly used in [[Iceland]]]]
In [[Iceland]] the [[funeral]] can be held 5 to 14 days after [[death]]. Before the [[funeral]] a small [[funeral]] service or [[wake (ceremony)|wake]] is held for the closest family members and friends. It takes up to 30 minutes and is usually held in a small funeral [[chapel]].

There are about 320,000 [[people]] living in [[Iceland]] and the [[deaths]] are about 1,800 to 2,000 per year in total. Of that 1,200 occur in the greater [[Reykjavík]] area.

==Preparation of deceased==
It is not customary to prepare the body with [[embalming]]; only a small [[Beauty|cosmetic]] procedure is performed.  This has been known to cause problems in cases where foreigners die in [[Iceland]]. A suggestion by the [http://www4.landspitali.is/lsh_ytri.nsf/htmlpages/index.html rannsóknarsvið of the Landspítali University Hospital] (equivalent to a coroner's office) has led to the possibility of having the corpse specially preserved for transfer. This has to be specially authorized for each case and is not necessarily available at all times.

==Viewing==
Most viewing are held in Chapel of Fossvogur or a kind of a prayinghouse next to Fossvogur's church (Fossvogskirkja). Fossvogskirkja only serves as a church for funerals.

'''Islandsflug''' was an [[airline]] and [[aircraft leasing]] company based in [[Iceland]]. It operated charter and scheduled passenger and cargo services, as well as wet lease services. Its main base was [[Keflavík International Airport]], [[Reykjavík]]. In 2005 it merged into [[Air Atlanta Icelandic]].&lt;ref name="FI"&gt;[[Flight International]] 5–11 April 2005&lt;/ref&gt; [[Landsflug]] took over the domestic operations of Islandsflug.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landsflug.is/ Landsflug] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609125259/http://www.landsflug.is/ |date=2007-06-09 }} retrieved 24 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The airline was established in 1991 by the merger of two small domestic scheduled airlines, [[Eagle Air Domestic]] and [[Flugtak]].  In 1994, the airline began overnight parcel services to [[East Midlands Airport]] using a [[Fairchild Metro]] aircraft.  The airline took delivery of its first [[ATR-42]] in 1996.  In 1997, the airline became a jet operator with the delivery of its first [[Boeing 737|Boeing 737-200QC]] which was used for passenger and freight services.  

In June 1999, it introduced the name of [[Icebird Airlines]] for its international operations. Islandsflug's first widebody aircraft, an [[Airbus A310]], was delivered in 2001, making the airline the first [[Airbus Industrie|Airbus]] operator in [[Iceland]]. In October 2004, it merged with [[Air Atlanta Icelandic]] under a holding company called the [[Avion Group]].&lt;ref name="FI"/&gt;

'''Laimonis''' is a [[Latvian masculine given name]], borne by more than 1,800 men in [[Latvia]].&lt;ref name="PMLP"&gt;PMLP database&lt;/ref&gt; The name means "lucky", "happy" or "blessed" and is related to the ancient Latvian word ''[[laime]]'' ("happiness", "joy" or "luck", or the goddess Laima). 

Laimonis is one of the relatively few names still in modern use from among the very many names of Latvian origin revived or invented during the [[Latvian National Awakening]] of the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;A number of other names derived from the same root are mostly now rare or obsolete, apart from Laima itself, which is still well-established as a modern Latvian woman's name. Laimīgais (which occurs in 1761 as an equivalent of Felix, "happy" in [[Latin]], in the ''Jaunā un vecā laika grāmata uz to 1761. gadu'', the first Latvian calendar) and Laimīgs - alternative forms of the common modern Latvian word for "happy" - both occur in the 18th century, along with Laimīts. The men's names Laimdonis, Laimdots, Laimgaids, Laimiņš, Laimis, Laimnesis and Laimstars, and the women's names Laimgaita, Laimīte and Laimonda, were all either revived from medieval sources or invented in the late 19th or early 20th century&lt;/ref&gt;

Its nameday is celebrated on 29 October.

Among the best-known of those with this name is [[Laimonis Laizāns]] (b. 1945), the highly regarded Latvian football goalkeeper.

'''Lieutenant general''' (abbreviated 'LTGEN' and pronounced 'Lef-tenant General') is the third-highest active rank of the [[Bosnian Army]] and was created as a direct equivalent of the [[United Kingdom|British]] military rank of [[Lieutenant general (UK)|lieutenant general]].

The rank of lieutenant general is held by the [[Chief of Army (Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina)|Chief of Army]]. The rank is also held when an army officer is the Vice Chief of the Defence Force, the Chief of Joint Operations, or the chief of capability development.

The insignia for a lieutenant general is the crown of two crowned-type stars, and a long string line below.

'''Logistics in World War I''' was the organising and delivery of supplies to the armed forces of [[World War I]]. 

== Initial stages of the war ==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 104-0984A, Bei Etricourt, Truppen auf Landstraße.jpg|thumb|German supply train bottleneck in front of two provisional bridges near [[Étricourt-Manancourt|Étricourt]], France, during [[Operation Michael]], 24 March 1918]]
With the expansion of military [[conscription]] and [[Military reserve force|reserve]] systems in the decades leading up to the 20th century, the potential size of armies increased substantially, while the [[Industrial warfare|industrialization of firepower]] ([[bolt-action rifle]]s with higher rate-of-fire, larger and more artillery, plus [[machine gun]]s) was starting to multiply the potential amount [[munitions]] they required. Military logistical systems, however, continued to rely on 19th century technology.

The main method of transportation of supplies at the start of the war was still by [[horse]] due to the lack of available alternatives in 1914, similar to that of the inclusion of [[cavalry]] within the armed forces, and the fast pace of the war in the first part of the war. When [[World War I]] started, the capabilities of rail and horse-drawn supply were stretched to their limits.  As the war progressed it became increasingly difficult  to supply soldiers in the traditional way by horse and carriage due to conditions at the front. The supply routes became muddy and impassable, improvement to [[artillery]] on both sides and other tactics meant that supplies became increasingly delivered under cover of night and were considerably slowed down.

== Trench warfare and blockade of Germany ==
[[File:Imperial Russian artillery ammunition baskets WWI.jpg|thumb|right|Russian ammunition baskets for heavy artillery shells.  Supplying the artillery of WWI was a challenge which, for Britain, resulted in the [[Shell Crisis of 1915]].]]
However, as the war ground down into static trench warfare it became easier for armies to support their troops with the use of the [[railway]], especially for the artillery. This made the transportation of supplies easier and quicker to get from the factories to the front line. This did have problems of their own, as seen by the [[Shell Crisis of 1915]]. Where the stalemate of [[trench warfare]] took hold, special [[narrow gauge]] [[trench railways]] were built to extend the rail network to the front lines. The great size of the German Army proved too much for its railways to support except while immobile.&lt;ref&gt;Creveld, pp. 138–141.&lt;/ref&gt; Tactical successes like [[Operation Michael]] devolved into operational failures where logistics failed to keep up with the army's advance over shell-torn ground. 

On the seas, the British [[blockade of Germany]] kept a stranglehold on raw materials, goods, and food needed to support Germany's war efforts, and is considered one of the key elements in the eventual Allied victory in the war. On the Allied Side a huge producer of supplies was the [[United States of America]], meaning the supplies had to be transported over the Atlantic Ocean to England and France. At the same time, Germany's [[unrestricted submarine warfare]] showed the vulnerability of shipping lanes despite Allied [[naval superiority]]. This revolutionised how war shipping was conducted and saw the first use of military convoys to counter the threat caused by [[U-boat|German U-Boats]].

In June 1918 the Allies organized the Military Board of Allied Supply, which proved to be an invaluable mechanism for coordinating logistical requirements for armies working in close proximity during the final battles that autumn.  The Board’s report contains overviews of the logistical systems for the principal Allied armies.&lt;ref&gt;“[https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/000112005 Report of the Military Board of Allied Supply]” 2 vols. Washington: Government Printing Office, 1914.&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==

The trans-Atlantic distances and the American inexperience at large scale operations combined to make support of the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) extraordinarily difficult.  Mass production of munitions, including cargo ships, did not reach full potential until near the end of the war.  In the meantime, the United States relied upon European allies for most weapons and upon Britain for shipping.  In France, the Americans built or improved ports, railroads, depots, and other facilities to move the supplies to the front.  Slowly the Americans learned the multiple functions associated with supporting a large-scale conflict, which allowed the AEF to operate as a independent force.  Experience gained in World War I proved invaluable during later conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;Leo P.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1658">The '''Movement for Democracy and Progress''' (French: ''Mouvement pour la démocratie et le progrès'', MDP) is a [[political party]] in the [[Republic of the Congo]], led by [[Jean-Claude Ibovi]]. In the [[Republic of the Congo parliamentary election, 2007|parliamentary election]] held on June 24 and August 5, 2007, the party won one out of 137 seats.&lt;ref&gt;For detailed results see [[Republic of the Congo parliamentary election, 2007]] and [http://www.jeuneafrique.com/pays/congo_brazza/article_depeche.asp?art_cle=XIN70027lalliseriat0 "L'alliance présidentielle occupe 125 des 137 sièges parlementaires"], Xinhua, August 25, 2007 {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It supports the government of President [[Denis Sassou Nguesso]].

Originally an organization called the National Convention for the Defense and Promotion of Denis Sassou Nguesso's Ideas (CNDPID), it was subsequently transformed into a new political party, the Movement for Democracy and Progress (MDP), which was officially launched on 18 February 2007 under Ibovi's leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Kalenga Nsana, [http://fr.allafrica.com/stories/200702201121.html "Congo-Brazzaville: Sortie officielle du Mouvement pour la démocratie et le progrès"], ''Le Potentiel'', 20 February 2007 {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nick Abbot''' (born 22 August 1960) is an English radio presenter, who previously covered on the Real Radio network and currently presents ''The Late Show'' on Friday and Saturday on [[LBC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w2s.co.uk/nick-abbot/historyfrm.html|title=Who is Nick Abbot?|accessdate=18 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
'''Nick Abbot''' was born on 22 August 1960, and was educated at [[George Heriot's School]], an independent school for boys in [[Edinburgh]], and at [[Brunel University]] in [[Uxbridge]] in West London, where he gained an upper-second class degree in psychology. His professional career began as a [[Virgin Megastore]] DJ. He had previously presented [[student radio]] at [[Brunel University]]'s radio station, [[Radio Brunel]].

In early 1987, he joined [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]] to present an overnight music show. After hearing American talk show presenter [[Neil Rogers]] Abbot was inspired and the show instead became a [[phone in]]. Eventually, a 'straight to air' format was settled upon, where calls would be taken unscreened. This format quickly became a hit with listeners. The absence of a delay system to 'dump' offensive language resulted in callers saying swear words just before they were cut off. It is believed that Abbot was one of the first (if not the first) to take calls straight to air, and later LBC colleague [[Iain Lee]] has often confessed that he stole some of his act from Nick (as well as [[Clive Bull]] and [[Tommy Boyd]]), perhaps hinting he got the inspiration for his "Triple M" show from Nick Abbot in addition to Boyd's "Human Zoo" show.

In October 1988, Abbot launched the new [[BBC]] radio station for London, [[BBC GLR]] (Greater London Radio). He presented the breakfast show for a year, but his contract was not renewed. He then returned to VMR, where he stayed until 1993.

== Radio work in the 1990s ==
=== Virgin Radio ===
Abbot was part of the original line-up on Virgin Radio in April 1993. There he presented the weekday late night phone-in show Sunday{{ndash}}Thursday from 10{{nbsp}}pm to 2{{nbsp}}am. The programme was a mixture of music and phone-in. Not afraid to speak his mind, he often voiced his opinions about other stations and presenters, and it was this that eventually led him into trouble.

Following a negative newspaper review by writer Robin Katz, Abbot's outbursts on-air eventually led to a censure from the Broadcasting Complaints Commission and [[Ofcom|the Radio Authority]].  He also called phone-in shows on other radio stations, speaking to the phone operators, and commenting on the usually elderly callers while listening to the programmes while on hold. Usually, he failed to make it on air, but occasionally he did, including a memorable call to the [[Scottie McClue]] show. In June 1994 he was moved to the weekday 7{{snd}}10{{nbsp}}pm show where he had to tone down his act, mainly taking music requests.

In January 1995, he moved back to the weekday late night show (this time from 11{{nbsp}}pm to 2{{nbsp}}am) where he remained until April that year when he was moved to the drivetime show (4{{snd}}7{{nbsp}}pm). He was dismissed from the station in September that year, leaving [[Virgin Radio]] with a fine of £5,000 for a sexual reference about a fellow DJ, and a further £20,000 for allowing a caller graphically to describe a sexual practice.

=== Talk Radio ===
In the summer of 1996, Abbot was heard on [[Talk Radio UK]] acting as holiday cover. He was subsequently offered a regular show during the summer of 1997 on Saturday afternoons, alongside [[Carol McGiffin]], later moving to Saturday evenings from 7:30{{nbsp}}pm to 10&amp;nbsp;pm.

====Black Thursday ====
Thursday 12 November 1998 was known as ''Black Thursday''. [[Talk Radio UK]] had been taken over by new management, and many presenters and staff were fired. Abbot was one of the many casualties. He continued with his weekday show on [[Virgin Radio]], which was now extended to six days a week from 1{{nbsp}}pm to 4&amp;nbsp;pm Sundays{{snd}}Fridays.

===Return to Virgin===
It was during this period that [[Virgin Radio]]'s new management re-hired Abbot to cover various shows on the station. He took over the evening show for six weeks during the summer of 1997, as well as providing holiday cover. In early 1998, he took over the weekday afternoon show on [[Virgin Radio]] from 1{{nbsp}}pm to 4&amp;nbsp;pm, while continuing with his Saturday evening show on [[Talk Radio UK|Talk Radio]]. In May 1998 (while still presenting his daily show on [[Virgin Radio]]) he took over the weekday evening show on [[Talk Radio UK]] from 7{{nbsp}}pm to 9&amp;nbsp;pm.

Between March and September 1999, long-established London station [[LBC]] hired Abbot &amp; [[Carol McGiffin|McGiffin]] for a Saturday evening phone-in, similar in format to the duo's earlier Talk Radio show. During this time, he continued working for [[Virgin Radio]] as a DJ. Throughout the summer of 2000, he presented a Sunday morning phone-in show on Virgin, also hosting the weekday afternoon show. Later that year he moved to the drivetime slot, until leaving Virgin once again, in May 2001. He also provided holiday cover for [[Chris Evans (presenter)|Chris Evans]].

===Real Radio===
In late 1999, Abbot joined [[Real Radio (Wales)]] to host its late-night phone-in show for a week as holiday cover for regular presenter [[Adrian Allen]]. October 2001 saw the beginning of a five-day stint at Manchester's [[Key 103]], during which he presented the 10{{nbsp}}pm{{snd}}2{{nbsp}}am programme.

In January 2002, he moved to [[Real Radio (Scotland)]] where he again presented the late night phone-in. Later in 2002, his show was networked across all three [[Real Radio]] stations (Scotland, Wales &amp; [[Real Radio (Yorkshire)|Yorkshire]]).

He presented his last Real Radio show on 19 December 2002, subsequently deciding to take a break from radio for over two years.

=== Return to radio ===
On 3 September 2005 Abbot was heard on London's [[102.2 Smooth FM]], presenting the Saturday morning show. He stood in for various presenters, including on 'Weekend Breakfast', and covered shows on digital station [[Planet Rock (radio station)|Planet Rock]]. This became a regular gig from 17 December 2005 onwards, airing on Saturdays and Sundays from 2–6&amp;nbsp;pm.

In 2006, he had brief stint standing in on [[Caroline Feraday]]'s weekend show (10&amp;nbsp;pm{{snd}}1&amp;nbsp;am, Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights) on [[LBC 97.3]], from 10–19 February. However, he lost his voice during his second show, cutting the show short and being replaced by a recording of his friend and former Virgin and Talk colleague/sparring partner [[Wendy Lloyd]]. He was also unable to present the following evening's show but returned on 17 February for the final three shows of this stint. He subsequently took over a regular slot on LBC on Saturday nights from 10{{nbsp}}pm to 1{{nbsp}}am.

Abbot's show had a distinctive style among LBC presenters. It became normal for a summary of the week's news to take place at the start of the show over his opening jingle, "Boogie Woogie" by [[Liberace]] (replacing the theme tune he had previously used: "The Beautiful People" by [[Marilyn Manson]]). During the show, he played various sound clips including quotes from films such as [[The Terminator]], and clips from his former co-presenter [[Carol McGiffin]].

In late 2007, he took over [[LBC]]'s weekday evening show from 7{{nbsp}}pm to 10{{nbsp}}pm, while continuing with the [[Planet Rock (radio station)|Planet Rock]] weekend show (the latter ending in September 2008).

=== Current work ===
{{BLP unsourced section|date=December 2017}}
Abbot now presents a Friday and Saturday night show on [[LBC]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.lbc.co.uk/news/uk/lbc-schedule-eddie-mair-present-drivetime-show/ |title= New LBC Schedule Revealed: Eddie Mair To Present Weekday Drivetime Show |work= LBC|accessdate=2018-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; from 10{{nbsp}}pm to 1{{nbsp}}am. Featuring commentary and discussion on current affairs and other subjects the show has a strong emphasis on humour. His links and commentaries are punctuated by short dialogue clips drawn from film soundtracks and politicians. Calls to the programme are often on serious topics, and callers are given free rein. Abbot also usually presents a week of A to Z themed shows on LBC during the festive period, covers for other LBC presenters on an occasional basis and writes a blog for the LBC website&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.lbc.co.uk/radio/presenters/nick-abbot/blog/ |title= NICK'S BLOG |work= LBC |accessdate=2018-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In March 2017 he launched a new [[podcast]] entitled ''The Nick Abbot Habit''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-nick-abbot-habit/id1212316368 |title= The Nick Abbot Habit |work= iTunes |accessdate=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a second series started in September 2018.

==Books==
Abbot has written a series of books, mainly on topics and news from the time of publishing, including ''Listen to me, I Know Everything''   and ''Do You Mind If I Say A Few Words'', which chart his columns through a specific time period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5248598.Nick_Abbot |title= NICK ABBOT’S BOOKS |work= Good Reads |accessdate=2018-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Norwegian Prison and Probation Officers’ Union''' ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]: ''Norsk Fengsels- og Friomsorgsforbund'', NFF) is the largest union for employees within [[Correctional system|correctional services]] in [[Norway]] (The [[Prison|prison service]] and the [[probation service]]). The Union was established in 1918 by the name Norsk Fengselstjenestemannsforbund, but the name was changed to the current name when NFF also organized probation officers. NFF has over 3,500 members. There are local elected representatives at the regional level and departments at the jobsites level at each [[prison]] and probation office.

NFF joined [[Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions]] (LO) in 1946. The union is affiliated with [[LO Stat]] and Nordiske Fængselsfunktionærers Union, NFU ([[Nordic countries|Nordic]] Prison Officers’ Association).&lt;ref name="NFU" /&gt;  NFF publishes the trade union magazine "NFF-magasinet".&lt;ref&gt;[http://frifagbevegelse.no/nff-magasinet NFF-magasinet] {{no icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Italy]]''' &amp;ndash; [[Unitary state|unitary]] [[parliamentary republic]] in South-Central [[Europe]], located primarily upon the [[Italian Peninsula]]. It is where [[Ancient Rome]] originated as a small agricultural community about the 8th century BC, which spread over the course of centuries into the colossal [[Roman empire]], encompassing the whole [[Mediterranean Sea]] and merging the [[Ancient Greek]] and Roman cultures into one civilization.  This civilization was so influential that parts of it survive in modern [[law]], [[Central Administration|administration]], [[philosophy]] and [[arts]], providing the groundwork that the [[Western world]] is based upon.

'''Saudi Ports Authority''' is a [[government agency]] that supervises the [[port]]s of [[Saudi Arabia]].  It was founded in 1976 as an independent agency of the Prime Minister's office, to bring together the governance and operations of the multiple ports of the country to one office.  Over time the actual operation of the ports was devolved by [[government contract]] to independent [[port operator|port operating companies]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ports.gov.sa/section/full_story.cfm?aid=74&amp;catid=22 Saudi Ports Authority, Introduction to Ports Authority]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Serbia–Syria relations''' are foreign relations between '''[[Serbia]]''' and '''[[Syria]]'''. Serbia has an embassy in [[Damascus]]. Syria has an embassy in [[Belgrade]]. Also Syria is a member of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] and Serbia is an observer.

== Serbian citizens in Syria ==
Serbs living in Syria are for the most part women married to Syrians, and the Foreign Ministry in Belgrade puts their number in the hundreds. Some of the marriages are the legacy of close political and economic ties formed in the communist era between the Arab world and communist countries like Yugoslavia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Serbia to evacuate citizens from Syria because of worsening situation|url=https://montrealgazette.com/news/Serbia+evacuate+citizens+from+Syria+because+worsening+situation/7030875/story.html|accessdate=29 September 2012|newspaper=Associated Press|date=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Soyol Erdene''' ({{lang-mn|Соёл Эрдэнэ}}, {{IPA-mn|ˈsɔjɔɮ ˈɛrdən|}}) is the first rock band of [[Mongolia]].

== Name ==
"Soyol Erdene" is the name of a melodious popular song of 1920s which the band played on an electric [[guitar]]. The approximate meaning is "Cultural jewel".

== History ==
The band was established in late 1971.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.olloo.mn/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=7155 "Соёл-Эрдэнэ" 33 жилийн дараа анхны цомгоо гаргалаа&lt;/ref&gt; The Minister of Culture of that time, famous novelist Ch. Lodoidamba called four young musicians and said: "England has a band the [[Beatles]] of four young men. Why shouldn't we have a similar band?" The four young musicians, who had recently graduated from the School of Music and Dance in [[Ulaanbaatar]] (nowadays College of Music and Dance) as [[Gayageum|yatga]] (ятга) players, established a rock band. The members were Tserenbat (drums), Erdenekhuyag (guitar), Batsaikhan (guitar) and Naranbaatar (keyboard).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;S. Tuul. "Соёл-Эрдэнийн анхдагч буюу гурван Жагаагийн нэг", Newspaper Нийгмийн толь. 9 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Later members were Galsanbat (guitar-solo), Zundari (bass), Bayar (vocal), Damdinsuren (guitar), Jargalsaikhan (drums), Jargalsaikhan (guitar/vocal), B. Tsolmon (drums). Among more recent members were D. Enkhbold  (guitar-solo) and Kh. Bulgan (keyboard). Soyol Erdene also performed female singers Rentsenkhand, Nandintsetseg, Dulamsuren, Uranchimeg, Nasantogtokh and Ariunaa.

During socialism the band worked under the administration of the State [[Philharmony]] which also supervised a [[symphony orchestra]] and the jazz band Bayan Mongol.

The first compositions of the band were Mongolian [[folk songs]] in a rock style arrangement as well as songs written by the members of the band. They often used poems of famous Mongolian writers.

The rock band was frequently criticised by the [[Mongolian People's Party|MPRP]] censorship for promotion of the Western musical style and Western fashion.

Soyol Erdene won the gold medal at the 10th [[World Festival of Youth and Students]] in 1973.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

== Repertoire ==
Among the most popular songs created by the members of Soyol Erdene during its [[Beat music|merseybeat]] period in the early 1970s were "Setgeliin jigüür" (''The wings of the Mood'') by Zundari, "Zürhnii aizam" (''Melody of the Heart''), "Uchraliin uyanga" (''Melody of Love'') by Galsanbat, Ankhnii khairiin duu (''Song of the First Love'') and Hüleelt (''Waiting'') by Jargalsaikhan.

The most popular rock interpretations of Mongolian folk songs were "Damdin" and "Tonjoo" (Western Mongolian folk song). Western Mongolian folklore fitted well to the rock arrangement.

The most renowned instrumental compositions of Soyol Erdene were "Soyol Erdene", "Sansriin khölög" (''Spaceship''), Tsenkher zalaa (a yatga solo that became a jingle for weather forecasts) and "Ankhnii tsas" (''The First Snow'') by Naranbaatar.

'''Upper Senegal and Niger''' ({{Lang-fr|Haut Sénégal et Niger}}) was a [[colony]] in [[French West Africa]], created on {{date|21 October 1904}} from colonial [[Senegambia and Niger]] by the decree "For the Reorganisation of the general government of French West Africa".&lt;ref&gt;Decree of 18 October 1904 portant réorganisation du Gouvernement général de l'Afrique occidentale française, published in the Official Journal of the French Republic on 21 October 1904 ([http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k2154389/f777.image Online])&lt;/ref&gt; 

At its creation, the "Colony of Upper Senegal and Niger" contained the old territories of Upper Senegal, the Middle Niger, and the military Niger territory. Its capital was [[Bamako]].

==History==
From early on Upper Senegal and Niger was wracked by violence in the face of colonial reorganization and taxation. Most notable were the Kobkitanda rebellion, led by the blind cleric Alfa Saibou, and the Karma revolt (December 1905–March 1906) of Oumarou Karma. The latter engulfed much of the Niger valley and was suppressed by four French columns arriving from [[Dori, Burkina Faso|Dori]], [[Gao]], [[Tahoua]], and [[Zinder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Idrissa |first1=Abdourahmane |title=Historical Dictionary of Niger |date=1 June 2012 |url=https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=GFFjEMjKrWkC&amp;pg=PA286&amp;lpg=PA286 |accessdate=25 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A decree of 2 March 1907 added the ''[[Cercle (French colonial)|cercles]]'' of [[Fada N'gourma]] and [[Say, Niger|Say]], which had been part of the colony of [[French Dahomey]] (present day [[Benin]]).&lt;ref&gt;Decree of 2 March 1907, ''rattachant à la colonie du Haut-Sénégal et Niger les cercles de N'Gourma et Say'', published in the Official Journal of the French Republic on 7 March 1907 ([http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k215443r/f553.image Online])&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 January 1912, the military territory of Niger was split off from Upper Senegal and Niger,&lt;ref&gt;Decree 7 September 1911, ''rattachant le territoire militaire du Niger au gouvernement général de l'Afrique occidentale française'', published in the Official Journal of the French Republic on 12 Septembre 1911 ([http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k64170278/f13.image Online])&lt;/ref&gt; and was erected into a colony in 1922.

Between November 1915 and February 1917, the Colony of Upper Senegal and Niger witnessed vastly popular, temporarily successful, and sustained armed opposition to colonial government in its western Volta region, which is referred to as the [[Volta-Bani War]]. It challenged colonial government authority for more than a year in an area stretching from [[Koudougou]] (in present-day [[Burkina Faso]]) in the east, to the banks of the [[Bani River]] (present day [[Mali]]) in the west.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Saul |first=Mahir |author2=Patrick Royer |series=Western African studies |title=West African Challenge to Empire: Culture and History in the Volta-Bani Anticolonial War |publisher=Ohio University Press |date=2001 |isbn=0-82141-413-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the most significant armed opposition to colonial authority organized anywhere in sub-Saharan Africa in the period preceding World War II. 

===Division===
After [[World War I]] ended, the unsuspected success of this resistance movement caused the French authorities to issue the decree "Concerning the Division of the Colony of Upper Senegal and Niger and the Creation of the Colony of Upper Volta" of 1 March 1919, which divided the colony into two distinct units:&lt;ref&gt;Decree of 1 March 1919, ''portant division de la colonie du Haut-Sénégal et Niger et création de la colonie de Haute-Volta'', published in the Official Journal of the French Republic on 20 May 1919 ([http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k2208973/f547.image Online])&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[French Upper Volta]], formed from the ''cercles'' of [[Gaoua]], [[Bobo-Dioulasso]], [[Dédougou]], [[Ouagadougou]], [[Dori, Burkina Faso|Dori]], Say, and Fada N'Gourma;
* the remaining territory – present-day [[Mali]] – was still called "Upper Senegal and Niger" until it was renamed "[[French Sudan]]" on 1 January 1921, implementing the decree of 4 December 1920, "For the Denomination of the Colonies and Territories Composing the General Government of French West Africa."&lt;ref&gt;Decree of 4 December 1920, ''portant dénomination des colonies et territoires composant le Gouvernement général de l'Afrique occidentale française'', published in the Official Journal of the French Republic on 9 December 1920 ([http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k241199f/f1415.image Online])&lt;/ref&gt;

The colony of Upper Senegal and Niger is perhaps remembered most often by [[philatelist]]s, since it issued a number of [[postage stamp]]s during its existence.

'''Élisabeth Thérèse Marie Juliette Boselli''' (11 March 1914 – 25 November 2005), was a French military and civilian pilot. She was the first female fighter pilot to serve in the [[French Air Force]], and held eight world records for distance, altitude and speed.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://pics-aeronef.discutfree.com/t2820-elisabeth-boselli|title=Elisabeth Boselli|newspaper=pics-aeronef.discutfree.com|language=fr|access-date=2017-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Boselli was born in Paris on 11 March 1914. She studied at [[École des Sciences Politiques]] in Paris and graduated in 1935.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; While a student, she was involved in various humanitarian organizations, including the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.janinetissot.fdaf.org/jt_boselli.htm|title=Elisabeth BOSELLI|website=www.janinetissot.fdaf.org|access-date=2017-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; She became interested in aviation after attending an aviation conference with her brother. Initially she volunteered at air fields, working in hangars and on engines, until in January 1938 she obtained her private pilot's license.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vieillestiges.com/Historique/html/Boselli-E.html|title=Elisabeth BOSELLI|website=www.vieillestiges.com|access-date=2017-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; She purchased her own aircraft, a Leopoldoff, began training in aerobatics, and decided to earn her public pilot's license.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.avionslegendaires.net/biographie/elisabeth-boselli/|title=Élisabeth BOSELLI - Biographie avionslegendaires.net|last=Gaëtan|newspaper=avionslegendaires.net|language=fr-FR|access-date=2017-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[World War II]] broke out and all civilian training was cancelled; Boselli's flight log from that period ends on 4 August 1939.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1944, a corps of female military pilots was formed and Boselli joined, with the rank of second lieutenant. She was trained in aerobatics and became a trainer herself. On February 12, 1946 she received her military pilot's license, becoming the first woman in France to do so. As the war had ended, however, female pilots were not needed and she was offered an administrative position instead. Boselli declined, and chose to return to civilian aviation.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In May 1947 she began training as a glider pilot under Paul Lepanse at Beynes, obtaining her licence four months later.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://jcpistoresi.wixsite.com/air-languedoc/en---elisabeth-boselli|title=AIR LANGUEDOC|newspaper=AIR LANGUEDOC|access-date=2017-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boselli immediately began to enter competitions, setting a number of records.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1951, Boselli visited the United States of America and met a pair of seaplane pilots who offered her the opportunity to fly a seaplane; she completed her training in 10 days and successfully achieved a seaplane pilot licence.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Boselli returned to the military in 1952, joining a presentation squadron of aerobatic pilots based at [[Étampes]] called [[Patrouille de France]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Boselli and the squadron performed in [[Monaco]], [[Algeria]] and [[Spain]], with Boselli as one of the solo performers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1957, she was offered an assignment in Algeria, which she accepted.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She was based at Oued Hamimine, and flew military evacuations, transport missions and delivered supplies and mail to troops.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

By the age of 45, she had accumulated 900 flight hours and 335 missions, and ceased flying. She spent the remainder of her career as an attaché-editor in the air navigation service until her retirement in 1969.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In her retirement, Boselli was president of the history committee of the [[Aéro-Club de France|Aero Club of France]], and wrote her memoirs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Boselli died in [[Lyon]] on 25 November 2005 and is buried in [[Guillotière Cemetery]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Records held ===
* World women's altitude records for single glider: reached 5,300 m on December 22, 1947 and 5,600 m on April 6, 1948&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vieillestiges.com/Historique/html/Boselli-E.html|title=Elisabeth BOSELLI|website=www.vieillestiges.com|access-date=2017-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Recognition ===
For her services to her country, she received the [[Legion of Honour|Legion of Honor]], the [[Cross for Military Valour]] and the [[Aeronautical Medal]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; There is a street in Lyon named after Boselli.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cartogiraffe.com/france/france+m%C3%A9tropolitaine/aquitaine-limousin-poitou-charentes/landes/mont-de-marsan/parentis-en-born/rue+elisabeth+boselli/|title=Rue Elisabeth Boselli, Parentis-en-Born|website=www.cartogiraffe.com|access-date=2017-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, a housing estate was built on a former airfield in [[Angers]], and was named the Boselli neighbourhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.angersmag.info/Angers-Le-quartier-Boselli-sur-les-pas-des-premiers-aviateurs_a7241.html|title=Angers – Le quartier Boselli sur les pas des premiers aviateurs|last=SOURISSEAU|first=Yannick|newspaper=Angers Mag – information, actualités locales, politique, culture|language=fr|access-date=2017-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
