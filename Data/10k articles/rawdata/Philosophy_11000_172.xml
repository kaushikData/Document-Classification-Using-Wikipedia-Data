'''Austro-Slavism''' was a political concept and program aimed to solve problems of [[Slavic people]]s in the [[Austrian Empire]].

It was most influential among [[Czech people|Czech]] [[Liberalism|liberals]] around the middle of the 19th century. First proposed by [[Karel Havlíček Borovský]] in 1846, as an opposition to the concept of [[pan-Slavism]], it was further developed into a complete political program by Czech politician [[František Palacký]].&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia"&gt;{{Citation

==Program==

Austro-Slavism envisioned peaceful cooperation between the smaller Slavic nations of [[Central Europe]] within the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] not dominated by [[German language|German]]-speaking elites. Palacký proposed a federation of eight national regions, with significant self-governance. After the suppression of the Czech revolution in [[Prague]] in June 1848, the program became irrelevant.&lt;ref name ="Encyclopedia" /&gt; The Austrian Empire transformed into [[Austria-Hungary]] (1867), honouring [[Hungary|Hungarian]], but not Slavic demands as part of the ''[[Ausgleich]]''. This further weakened the position of Austro-Slavism.

As a political concept, Austro-Slavism persisted until the fall of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire in 1918. The collapse of Austria-Hungary owed a great deal to that nation's failure to recognise Slavic demands. [[Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk]], later to become the first President of Czechoslovakia, convinced US President [[Woodrow Wilson]] during the [[First World War]] that the Slavic peoples of Austria need to be liberated, leading to the promulgation of the [[Fourteen Points]], and ultimate dissolution of the former Austrian Empire. Autroslavism appeared in its last iteration around this time, in the form of several proposals, lacking in influence, to federalise Austria-Hungary (such as the abortive [[United States of Greater Austria]] plan).

'''Bartolomé de las Casas''' ({{IPA-es|baɾtoloˈme ðe las ˈkasas|lang|Es-Bartolome_de_las_Casa-pronounciation.ogg}}; {{circa}}&amp;nbsp;1484&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Parish|Weidman|1976|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--please do not change birth year to 1474; while this had been traditionally held it's now accepted to be an error; read the article and the accompanying citation--&gt; – 18 July 1566) was a 16th-century [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] colonist who acted as a historian and social reformer before becoming a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[friar]]. He was appointed as the first resident [[Bishop]] of [[Chiapas]], and the first officially appointed "[[Protector of the Indians]]". His extensive writings, the most famous being ''[[A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies]]'' and ''Historia de Las Indias'', chronicle the first decades of colonization of the [[Spanish West Indies|West Indies]]. He described the atrocities committed by the colonizers against the indigenous peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Zinn| first=Howard| year=1997| pp=483| title=The Zinn Reader| publisher=[[Seven Stories Press]]| isbn=978-1-583229-46-0| ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arriving as one of the first Spanish (and European) settlers in the [[Americas]], Las Casas initially participated in, but eventually felt compelled to oppose the abuses committed by colonists against the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]]. As a result, in 1515 he gave up his Indian slaves and ''[[encomienda]]'', and advocated, before King [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]], on behalf of rights for the natives. In his early writings, he advocated the use of African slaves instead of Natives in the West-Indian colonies. In the 20th century, he has been criticized for being among the founders of the [[transatlantic slave trade]]. Later in life, he retracted this position, as he regarded all forms of slavery as equally wrong. In 1522, he tried to launch a new kind of peaceful colonialism on the coast of [[Venezuela]], but this venture failed. Las Casas entered the [[Dominican Order]] and became a friar, leaving public life for a decade. He traveled to [[Central America]], acting as a missionary among the [[Maya peoples|Maya]] of [[Guatemala]] and participating in debates among colonial churchmen about how best to bring the natives to the Christian faith.

Traveling back to Spain to recruit more missionaries, he continued lobbying for the abolition of the ''encomienda'', gaining an important victory by the passage of the [[New Laws]] in 1542. He was appointed Bishop of [[Chiapas]], but served only for a short time before he was forced to return to Spain because of resistance to the New Laws by the ''[[Encomienda#Encomenderos|encomenderos]]'', and conflicts with Spanish settlers because of his pro-Indian policies and activist religious stance. He served in the Spanish court for the remainder of his life; there he held great influence over Indies-related issues. In 1550, he participated in the [[Valladolid debate]], in which [[Juan Ginés de Sepúlveda]] argued that the Indians were less than human and required Spanish masters in order to become civilized. Las Casas maintained that they were fully human and that forcefully subjugating them was unjustifiable.

Bartolomé de las Casas spent 50 years of his life actively fighting slavery and the colonial abuse of indigenous peoples, especially by trying to convince the Spanish court to adopt a more humane policy of colonization. Unlike other priests who sought to destroy the indigenous peoples' native books and writings, he strictly opposed this action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murray|first1=Stuart|title=The Library: An Illustrated History|date=2009|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he failed to save the indigenous peoples of the Western Indies, his efforts did result in improvement of the legal status of the natives, and in an increased colonial focus on the ethics of colonialism. Las Casas is often considered to be one of the first advocates for a universal conception of [[human dignity]] (later [[human rights]]).&lt;ref name="Beuchot 1994" /&gt;

=== Background and arrival in the New World ===

The print was made by two Flemish artists who had fled the Southern Netherlands because of their [[Dutch Revolt#Protestantism|Protestant]] faith: [[Joos van Winghe]] was the designer and [[Theodor de Bry]] the engraver. ]]

Bartolomé de las Casas was born in [[Seville]] in 1484, on 11 November.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Parish|Weidman|1976|p=385}}&lt;/ref&gt; For centuries, Las Casas's birthdate was believed to be 1474; however, in the 1970s, scholars conducting archival work demonstrated this to be an error, after uncovering in the ''[[Archivo General de Indias]]'' records of a contemporary lawsuit that demonstrated he was born a decade later than had been supposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Parish|Weidman|1976|loc=''passim''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent biographers and authors have generally accepted and reflected this revision.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{harvcoltxt|Saunders|2005|p=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Pedro de las Casas, a merchant, descended from one of the families that had migrated from France to found the town of Seville; his family also spelled the name ''Casaus''.&lt;ref name="Wagner Parish 1967 p1–3"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Wagner|Parish|1967|pp=1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to one biographer, his family were of [[converso]] heritage,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Giménez Fernández|1971|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; although others refer to them as ancient Christians who migrated from France.&lt;ref name="Wagner Parish 1967 p1–3" /&gt; Following the testimony of Las Casas's biographer Antonio de Remesal, tradition has it that Las Casas studied a ''licentiate'' at [[Salamanca]], but this is never mentioned in Las Casas's own writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Wagner|Parish|1967|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a young man, in 1507, he journeyed to [[Rome]] where he observed the Festival of Flutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Giménez Fernández|1971|pp=71–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With his father, Las Casas immigrated to the island of [[Hispaniola]] in 1502 on the expedition of [[Nicolás de Ovando]]. Las Casas became a ''[[hacienda|hacendado]]'' and slave owner, receiving a piece of land in the province of [[Cibao]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Giménez Fernández|1971|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; He participated in slave raids and military expeditions against the native [[Taíno]] population of Hispaniola.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Wagner|Parish|1967|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1510, he was ordained a priest, the first one to be ordained in the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Wagner|Parish|1967|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Baptiste|1990|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1510, a group of [[Dominican order|Dominican]] friars arrived in [[Santo Domingo]] led by [[Pedro de Córdoba]]; appalled by the injustices they saw committed by the slaveowners against the Indians, they decided to deny slave owners the right to [[confession (religion)|confession]]. Las Casas was among those denied confession for this reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Wagner|Parish|1967|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1511, a Dominican preacher Fray [[Antonio de Montesinos]] preached a fiery sermon that implicated the colonists in the [[genocide]] of the native peoples. He is said to have preached, "Tell me by what right of justice do you hold these Indians in such a cruel and horrible servitude? On what authority have you waged such detestable wars against these people who dealt quietly and peacefully on their own lands? Wars in which you have destroyed such an infinite number of them by homicides and slaughters never heard of before. Why do you keep them so oppressed and exhausted, without giving them enough to eat or curing them of the sicknesses they incur from the excessive labor you give them, and they die, or rather you kill them, in order to extract and acquire gold every day."&lt;ref name="Sanderlin" /&gt; Las Casas himself argued against the Dominicans in favour of the justice of the [[encomienda]]. The colonists, led by [[Diego Columbus]], dispatched a complaint against the Dominicans to the King, and the Dominicans were recalled from Hispaniola.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Wagner|Parish|1967|pp=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Wynter|1984a|pp=29–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conquest of Cuba and change of heart ===
[[File:Reconstruction of Taino village, Cuba.JPG|thumb|Reconstruction of a Taíno village from Las Casas's times in contemporary Cuba]]
In 1513, as a chaplain, Las Casas participated in [[Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar]]'s and [[Pánfilo de Narváez]]' conquest of [[Cuba]]. He participated in campaigns in [[Bayamo]] and [[Camagüey]] and in the massacre of [[Hatuey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Giménez Fernández|1971|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; He witnessed many atrocities committed by Spaniards against the native [[Ciboney]] and [[Guanahatabey]] peoples. He later wrote: "I saw here cruelty on a scale no living being has ever seen or expects to see."&lt;ref name="Sullivan" /&gt; Las Casas and his friend Pablo de la Rentería were awarded a joint encomienda which was rich in gold and slaves, located on the [[Arimao River]] close to [[Cienfuegos]]. During the next years, he divided his time between being a colonist and his duties as an ordained priest.

In 1514, Las Casas was studying a passage in the book [[Ecclesiasticus]] ([[Sirach]])&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt; 34:18–22{{efn|"If one sacrifices from what has been wrongfully obtained, the offering is blemished; the gifts of the lawless are not acceptable.&amp;nbsp;... Like one who kills a son before his father's eyes is the man who offers sacrifice from the property of the poor. The bread of the needy is the life of the poor; whoever deprives them of it is a man of blood." quoted from {{harvcoltxt|Brading|1997|pp=119–20}}.}} for a [[Pentecost]] sermon and pondering its meaning. Las Casas was finally convinced that all the actions of the Spanish in the New World had been illegal and that they constituted a great injustice. He made up his mind to give up his slaves and encomienda, and started to preach that other colonists should do the same. When his preaching met with resistance, he realized that he would have to go to Spain to fight there against the enslavement and abuse of the native people.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Wagner|Parish|1967|pp=11–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aided by Pedro de Córdoba and accompanied by Antonio de Montesinos, he left for Spain in September 1515, arriving in Seville in November.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Baptiste|1990|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Wagner|Parish|1967|pp=13–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Las Casas and King Ferdinand ===
[[File:FerdinandCatholic.jpg|thumb|upright|A contemporary painting of [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|King Ferdinand "The Catholic"]]]]
Las Casas arrived in Spain with the plan of convincing the King to end the encomienda system. This was easier thought than done, as most of the people who were in positions of power were themselves either encomenderos or otherwise profiting from the influx of wealth from the Indies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Wagner|Parish|1967|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the winter of 1515, [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|King Ferdinand]] lay ill in [[Plasencia]], but Las Casas was able to get a letter of introduction to the Majesty from the Archbishop of Seville, [[Diego de Deza]]. On Christmas Eve of 1515, Las Casas met the Monarch and discussed the situation in the Indies with him; the King agreed to hear him out in more detail at a later date. While waiting, Las Casas produced a report that he presented to the Bishop of Burgos, [[Juan Rodríguez de Fonseca]], and secretary [[Lope Conchillos y Quintana|Lope Conchillos]], who were functionaries in complete charge of the Royal policies regarding the Indies; both were encomenderos. They were not impressed by his account, and Las Casas had to find a different avenue of change. He put his faith in his coming audience with the King, but it never came, for King Ferdinand died on January 25, 1516.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Wagner|Parish|1967|pp=15–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The regency of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] passed on to [[Francisco Jiménez de Cisneros|Ximenez Cisneros]] and [[Pope Adrian VI|Adrian of Utrecht]] who were guardians for the under-age [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Prince Charles]]. Las Casas was resolved to see Prince Charles who resided in [[Flanders]], but on his way there he passed [[Madrid]] and delivered to the regents a written account of the situation in the Indies and his proposed remedies. This was his "''[[Bartolomé de las Casas#Memorial de Remedios para las Indias|Memorial de Remedios para Las Indias]]''" of 1516.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Baptiste|1990|pp=7–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this early work, Las Casas advocated importing Black slaves from Africa to relieve the suffering Indians, a stance he later retracted, becoming an advocate for the Africans in the colonies as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Wynter|1984a|p=}}, {{harvcoltxt|Wynter|1984b|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Blackburn|1997|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Friede|1971|pp=165–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Las Casas's retraction of his views on African slavery is expressed particularly in chapters 102 and 129, Book III of his ''Historia''.}} This shows that Las Casas's first concern was not to end slavery as an institution, but to end the physical abuse and suffering of the Indians.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Wagner|Parish|1967|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In keeping with the legal and moral doctrine of the time Las Casas believed that slavery could be justified if it was the result of [[Just War]], and at the time he assumed that the enslavement of Africans was justified.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Wynter|1984a|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Worried by the visions that Las Casas had drawn up of the situation in the Indies, Cardinal Cisneros decided to send a group of [[Hieronymite]] friars to take over the government of the islands.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

=== Protector of the Indians ===
Three [[Hieronymite]] friars, [[Luis de Figueroa]], Bernardino de Manzanedo and Alonso de Santo Domingo, were selected as commissioners to take over the authority of the Indies. Las Casas had a considerable part in selecting them and writing the instructions under which their new government would be instated, largely based on Las Casas's ''memorial''. Las Casas himself was granted the official title of [[Protector of the Indians]], and given a yearly salary of one hundred pesos. In this new office Las Casas was expected to serve as an advisor to the new governors with regard to Indian issues, to speak the case of the Indians in court and send reports back to Spain. Las Casas and the commissioners traveled to Santo Domingo on separate ships, and Las Casas arrived two weeks later than the Hieronimytes. During this time the Hieronimytes had time to form a more pragmatic view of the situation than the one advocated by Las Casas; their position was precarious as every encomendero on the Islands was fiercely against any attempts to curtail their use of native labour. Consequently, the commissioners were unable to take any radical steps towards improving the situation of the natives. They did revoke some encomiendas from Spaniards, especially those who were living in Spain and not on the islands themselves; they even repossessed the encomienda of [[Juan Rodríguez de Fonseca|Fonseca, the Bishop of Burgos]]. They also carried out an inquiry into the Indian question at which all the encomenderos asserted that the Indians were quite incapable of living freely without their supervision. Las Casas was disappointed and infuriated. When he accused the Hieronymites of being complicit in kidnapping Indians, the relationship between Las Casas and the commissioners broke down. Las Casas had become a hated figure by Spaniards all over the Islands, and he had to seek refuge in the Dominican monastery. The Dominicans had been the first to indict the encomenderos, and they continued to chastise them and refuse the absolution of confession to slave owners, and even stated that priests who took their confession were committing a [[mortal sin]]. In May 1517, Las Casas was forced to travel back to Spain to denounce to the regent the failure of the Hieronymite reforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Wagner|Parish|1967|pp=25–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only after Las Casas had left did the Hieronymites begin to congregate Indians into towns similar to what Las Casas had wanted.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Wagner|Parish|1967|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Las Casas and Emperor Charles V: The peasant colonization scheme ===
[[File:Bernard van Orley (1487-1541) Karel V - Koninklijk klooster van Brou 25-10-2016 10-06-36.jpg|upright|thumb|Contemporary portrait of the young Emperor Charles V]]
When he arrived in Spain, his former protector, regent and [[Francisco Jiménez de Cisneros|Cardinal Ximenez Cisneros]], was ill and had become tired of Las Casas's tenacity. Las Casas resolved to meet instead with the young King Charles I. Ximenez died on November 8, and the young King arrived in [[Valladolid]] on November 25, 1517. Las Casas managed to secure the support of the King's Flemish courtiers, including the powerful Chancellor Jean de la Sauvage. Las Casas's influence turned the favor of the court against Secretary Conchillos and Bishop Fonseca. Sauvage spoke highly of Las Casas to the King, who appointed Las Casas and Sauvage to write a new plan for reforming the governmental system of the Indies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Wagner|Parish|1967|pp=35–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Las Casas suggested a plan where the encomienda would be abolished and Indians would be congregated into self-governing townships to become tribute-paying vassals of the King. He still suggested that the loss of Indian labor for the colonists could be replaced by allowing [[Slavery in the Spanish New World colonies#Spanish enslavement of Africans|importation of African slaves]]. Another important part of the plan was to introduce a new kind of sustainable colonization, and Las Casas advocated supporting the migration of Spanish peasants to the Indies where they would introduce small-scale farming and agriculture, a kind of colonization that didn't rely on resource depletion and Indian labor. Las Casas worked to recruit a large number of peasants who would want to travel to the Islands, where they would be given lands to farm, cash advances, and the tools and resources they needed to establish themselves there. The recruitment drive was difficult, and during the process the power relation shifted at court when Chancellor Sauvage, Las Casas's main supporter, unexpectedly died. In the end a much smaller number of peasant families were sent than originally planned, and they were supplied with insufficient provisions and no support secured for their arrival. Those who survived the journey were ill-received, and had to work hard even to survive in the hostile colonies. Las Casas was devastated by the tragic result of his peasant migration scheme, which he felt had been thwarted by his enemies. He decided instead to undertake a personal venture which would not rely on the support of others, and fought to win a land grant on the American mainland which was in its earliest stage of colonization.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Wagner|Parish|1967|pp=38–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Cumaná venture ===

Following a suggestion by his friend and mentor [[Pedro de Córdoba]], Las Casas petitioned a land grant to be allowed to establish a settlement in northern [[Venezuela]] at [[Cumaná]]. Founded in 1515, there was already a small Franciscan monastery in Cumana, and a Dominican one at Chiribichi, but the monks there were being harassed by Spaniards operating slave raids from the nearby Island of [[Cubagua]]. In order to make the proposal palatable to the King, Las Casas had to incorporate the prospect of profits for the royal treasury.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Wagner|Parish|1967|pp=46–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; He suggested fortifying the northern coast of Venezuela, establishing ten royal forts to protect the Indians and starting up a system of trade in gold and pearls. All the Indian slaves of the New World should be brought to live in these towns and become tribute paying subjects to the King. In order to secure the grant Las Casas had to go through a long fight in court against Bishop Fonseca and his supporters [[Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés|Gonzalo de Oviedo]] and Bishop Quevedo of [[Province of Tierra Firme|Tierra Firme]]. Las Casas's supporters were [[Diego Columbus]] and the new chancellor Gattinara. Las Casas's enemies slandered him to the King, accusing him of planning to escape with the money to [[Genoa]] or [[Rome]]. In 1520 Las Casas's concession was finally granted, but it was a much smaller grant than he had initially proposed; he was also denied the possibilities of extracting gold and pearls, which made it difficult for him to find investors for the venture. Las Casas committed himself to producing 15,000 [[ducat]]s of annual revenue, increasing to 60,000 after ten years, and to erecting three Christian towns of at least 40 settlers each. Some privileges were also granted to the initial 50 shareholders in Las Casas's scheme. The King also promised not to give any encomienda grants in Las Casas's area. That said, finding fifty men willing to invest 200 ducats each and three years of unpaid work proved impossible for Las Casas. In the end, he ended up leaving in November 1520 with just a small group of peasants, paying for the venture with money borrowed from his brother in-law.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Wagner|Parish|1967|pp=60–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arriving in [[Puerto Rico]], in January 1521, he received the terrible news that the Dominican convent at Chiribichi had been sacked by Indians, and that the Spaniards of the islands had launched a punitive expedition, led by [[Gonzalo de Ocampo]], into the very heart of the territory that Las Casas wanted to colonize peacefully. The Indians had been provoked to attack the settlement of the monks because of the repeated slave raids by Spaniards operating from Cubagua. As Ocampo's ships began returning with slaves from the land Las Casas had been granted, he went to Hispaniola to complain to the [[Real Audiencia|Audiencia]]. After several months of negotiations Las Casas set sail alone; the peasants he had brought had deserted, and he arrived in his colony already ravaged by Spaniards.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Wagner|Parish|1967|pp=63–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Las Casas worked there in adverse conditions for the following months, being constantly harassed by the Spanish [[pearl hunting|pearl fishers]] of [[Cubagua]] island who traded slaves for alcohol with the natives. Early in 1522 Las Casas left the settlement to complain to the authorities. While he was gone the native [[Island Caribs|Caribs]] attacked the settlement of Cumaná, burned it to the ground and killed four of Las Casas's men.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Wagner|Parish|1967|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Hispaniola in January 1522, and heard the news of the massacre. The rumours even included him among the dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Giménez Fernández|1971|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; To make matters worse, his detractors used the event as evidence of the need to pacify the Indians using military means. The tragic outcome of Las Casas's great mainland adventure made him turn his life in a new direction.&lt;!-- cite needed here too --&gt;

=== A Dominican friar ===
Devastated, Las Casas reacted by entering the Dominican monastery of Santa Cruz in [[Santo Domingo]] as a novice in 1522 and finally taking holy vows as a [[Dominican order|Dominican]] [[friar]] in 1523.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Wagner|Parish|1967|pp=70–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; There he continued his theological studies, being particularly attracted to [[Thomism|Thomist]] philosophy, and there is little information about his activities in the following ten years. He oversaw the construction of a monastery in [[Puerto Plata (city)|Puerto Plata]] on the north coast of Hispaniola, subsequently serving as [[prior]] of the convent. In 1527 he began working on his ''History of the Indies'' in order to report many of the experiences he had witnessed at first hand in the conquest and colonization of New Spain. In 1531 he wrote a letter to [[García Fernández Manrique, 3rd Count of Osorno|Garcia Manrique]], [[Count of Osorno]], protesting again the mistreatment of the Indians and advocating a return to his original reform plan of 1516. In 1531 a complaint was sent by the encomenderos of Hispaniola that Las Casas was again accusing them of mortal sins from the pulpit. In 1533 he contributed to the establishment of a peace treaty between the Spanish and the rebel [[Taíno]] band of chief [[Enriquillo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Wagner|Parish|1967|pp=74–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1534 Las Casas made an attempt to travel to [[Peru]] to observe the first stages of [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire|conquest of that region]] by [[Francisco Pizarro]]. His party made it as far as [[Panama]], but had to turn back to [[Nicaragua]] due to adverse weather. Lingering for a while in the Dominican convent of [[Granada, Nicaragua|Granada]], he got into conflict with [[Rodrigo de Contreras]], Governor of Nicaragua, when Las Casas vehemently opposed slaving expeditions by the Governor.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Wagner|Parish|1967|pp=79–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1536 Las Casas followed a number of friars to [[Guatemala]], where they began to prepare to undertake a mission among the [[Maya peoples|Maya]] Indians. They stayed in the convent founded some years earlier by Fray [[Domingo Betanzos]] and studied the [[K'iche' language]] with Bishop [[Francisco Marroquín]], before traveling into the interior region called Tuzulutlan, "The Land of War", in 1537.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Wagner|Parish|1967|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Motolinia.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Toribio de Benavente Motolinia|Toribio de Benavente "Motolinia"]], Las Casas's Franciscan adversary.]]

Also in 1536, before venturing into Tuzulutlan, Las Casas went to [[Oaxaca]], [[Mexico]], to participate in a series of discussions and debates among the bishops of the Dominican and [[Franciscan order]]s. The two orders had very different approaches to the conversion of the Indians. The Franciscans used a method of mass conversion, sometimes baptizing many thousands of Indians in a day. This method was championed by prominent Franciscans such as [[Toribio de Benavente]], known as "Motolinia", and Las Casas made many enemies among the Franciscans for arguing that conversions made without adequate understanding were invalid. Las Casas wrote a treatise called "''De unico vocationis modo''" (On the Only Way of Conversion) based on the missionary principles he had used in Guatemala. Motolinia would later be a fierce critic of Las Casas, accusing him of being all talk and no action when it came to converting the Indians.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Wagner|Parish|1967|pp=98–100}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a direct result of the debates between the Dominicans and Franciscans and spurred on by Las Casas's treatise, [[Pope Paul III]] promulgated the [[Papal bull|Bull]] "[[Sublimis Deus]]," which stated that the Indians were rational beings and should be brought peacefully to the faith as such.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Giménez Fernández|1971|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Las Casas returned to Guatemala in 1537 wanting to employ his new method of conversion based on two principles: 1) to preach the Gospel to all men and treat them as equals, and 2) to assert that conversion must be voluntary and based on knowledge and understanding of the Faith. It was important for Las Casas that this method be tested without meddling from secular colonists, so he chose a territory in the heart of Guatemala where there were no previous colonies and where the natives were considered fierce and war-like. Because of the fact that the land had not been possible to conquer by military means, the governor of Guatemala, [[Alonso de Maldonado]], agreed to sign a contract promising that if the venture was successful he would not establish any new encomiendas in the area. Las Casas's group of friars established a Dominican presence in [[Rabinal]], [[Sacapulas]] and [[Cobán]]. Through the efforts of Las Casas's missionaries the so-called "Land of War" came to be called "[[Verapaz, Guatemala|Verapaz]]", "True Peace". Las Casas's strategy was to teach Christian songs to merchant Indian Christians who then ventured into the area. In this way he was successful in converting several native chiefs, among them those of [[Lago de Atitlán|Atitlán]] and [[Chichicastenango]], and in building several churches in the territory named [[Alta Verapaz Department|Alta Verapaz]]. These congregated a group of Christian Indians in the location of what is now the town of Rabinal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Wagner|Parish|1967|pp=86–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1538 Las Casas was recalled from his mission by Bishop Marroquín who wanted him to go to [[Mexico]] and then on to [[Spain]] in order to seek more Dominicans to assist in the mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Wagner|Parish|1967|pp=94–95}}&lt;/ref&gt; Las Casas left Guatemala for Mexico, where he stayed for more than a year before setting out for Spain in 1540.

=== The New Laws ===
[[File:Leyes Nuevas1.jpg|thumb|Cover of the New Laws of 1542]]

In Spain, Las Casas started securing official support for the Guatemalan mission, and he managed to get a royal decree forbidding secular intrusion into the Verapaces for the following five years. He also informed the [[School of Salamanca|Theologians]] of [[Salamanca]], led by [[Francisco de Vitoria]], of the mass baptism practiced by the Franciscans, resulting in a [[dictum]] condemning the practice as sacrilegious.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Wagner|Parish|1967|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But apart from the clerical business, Las Casas had also traveled to Spain for his own purpose: to continue the struggle against the colonists' mistreatment of the Indians.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Wagner|Parish|1967|pp=105–06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The encomienda had, in fact, legally been abolished in 1523, but it had been reinstituted in 1526, and in 1530 a general ordinance against slavery was reversed by the Crown. For this reason it was a pressing matter for Bartolomé de las Casas to plead once again for the Indians with Charles V who was by now [[Holy Roman Emperor]] and no longer a boy. He wrote a letter asking for permission to stay in Spain a little longer in order to argue for the Emperor that conversion and colonization were best achieved by peaceful means.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Wagner|Parish|1967|pp=106–07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the hearings started in 1542, Las Casas presented a narrative of atrocities against the natives of the Indies that would later be published in 1552 as "[[A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies|Brevísima relación de la destrucción de las Indias]]". Before a council consisting of Cardinal [[García de Loaysa]], the [[Osorno la Mayor|Count of Osorno]], Bishop [[Sebastián Ramírez de Fuenleal|Fuenleal]] and several members of the [[Council of the Indies]], Las Casas argued that the only solution to the problem was to remove all Indians from the care of secular Spaniards, by abolishing the encomienda system and putting them instead directly under the Crown as royal tribute-paying subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Wagner|Parish|1967|pp=109–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 20, 1542, the Emperor signed the [[New Laws]] abolishing the encomiendas and removing certain officials from the Council of the Indies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Giménez Fernández|1971|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New Laws made it illegal to use Indians as carriers, except where no other transport was available, it prohibited all taking of Indians as slaves, and it instated a gradual abolition of the encomienda system, with each encomienda reverting to the Crown at the death of its holders. It also exempted the few surviving Indians of [[Hispaniola]], [[Cuba]], [[Puerto Rico]] and [[Jamaica]] from tribute and all requirements of personal service. However, the reforms were so unpopular back in the New World that riots broke out and threats were made against Las Casas's life. The [[Viceroy]] of [[New Spain]], himself an encomendero, decided not to implement the laws in his domain, and instead sent a party to Spain to argue against the laws on behalf of the encomenderos.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Giménez Fernández|1971|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Las Casas himself was also not satisfied with the laws, as they were not drastic enough and the encomienda system was going to function for many years still under the gradual abolition plan. He drafted a suggestion for an amendment arguing that the laws against slavery were formulated in such a way that it presupposed that violent conquest would still be carried out, and he encouraged once again beginning a phase of peaceful colonization by peasants instead of soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Wagner|Parish|1967|pp=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bishop of Chiapas ===
[[File:Fachada de la iglesia conventual de San Pablo (Valladolid).jpg|thumb|The Church of the Dominican Convent of San Pablo in Valladolid where Bartolomé de Las Casas was consecrated as Bishop on March 30, 1544.]]

Before Las Casas returned to Spain, he was also appointed as Bishop of [[Chiapas]], a newly established [[diocese]] of which he took possession in 1545 upon his return to the New World. He was consecrated in the Dominican Church of San Pablo on March 30, 1544. As Archbishop [[García de Loaysa|Loaysa]] strongly disliked Las Casas,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Giménez Fernández|1971|p=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ceremony was officiated by Loaysa's nephew, [[Diego de Loaysa]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Senj-Modruš|Bishop of Modruš]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UZVUXXdcna8C&amp;pg=PA493&amp;lpg=PA493&amp;dq=diego%20de%20loaysa#v=onepage&amp;q=diego%20de%20loaysa&amp;f=false|first=Lawrence A.|last=Clayton|title=Bartolomé de Las Casas|pages=291|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date= Jun 29, 2012|ISBN=9781107001213}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Pedro Torres (bishop)|Pedro Torres]], [[Titular Bishop]] of ''Arbanum'', and [[Cristóbal de Pedraza]], [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Tegucigalpa|Bishop of Comayagua]], as co-consecrators.&lt;ref name=CathHierBartCasas&gt;[http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/bishop/bdlcas.html "Bishop Bartolomé de las Casas (Casaus), O.P. "] ''[[Catholic-Hierarchy.org]]''. David M. Cheney. Retrieved February 29, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; As a bishop Las Casas was involved in frequent conflicts with the encomenderos and secular laity of his diocese: among the landowners there was the conquistador [[Bernal Díaz del Castillo]]. In a [[pastoral letter]] issued on March 20, 1545, Las Casas refused [[absolution]] to slave owners and encomenderos even on their death bed, unless all their slaves had been set free and their property returned to them.&lt;ref name="Gimenez Fernandez p103"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Giménez Fernández|1971|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Las Casas furthermore threatened that anyone who mistreated Indians within his jurisdiction would be excommunicated. He also came into conflict with the Bishop of Guatemala [[Francisco Marroquín]], to whose jurisdiction the diocese had previously belonged. To Las Casas's dismay Bishop Marroquín openly defied the New Laws. While bishop,  Las Casas was the principal consecrator of [[Antonio de Valdivieso]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of León in Nicaragua|Bishop of Nicaragua]] (1544).&lt;ref name=CathHierBartCasas /&gt;

The New Laws were finally repealed on October 20, 1545, and riots broke out against Las Casas, with shots being fired against him by angry colonists.&lt;ref name="Gimenez Fernandez p103" /&gt; After a year he had made himself so unpopular among the Spaniards of the area that he had to leave. Having been summoned to a meeting among the bishops of New Spain to be held in [[Mexico City]] on January 12, 1546, he left his diocese, never to return.&lt;ref name="Gimenez Fernandez p103" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Brading|1997|p=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the meeting, probably after lengthy reflection, and realizing that the New Laws were lost in Mexico, Las Casas presented a moderated view on the problems of confession and restitution of property, Archbishop [[Juan de Zumárraga]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Mexico|Mexico]] and Bishop [[Julián Garcés]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Puebla de los Angeles|Puebla]] agreed completely with his new moderate stance, Bishop [[Vasco de Quiroga]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Morelia|Michoacán]] had minor reservations, and Bishops [[Francisco Marroquín]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Guatemala|Guatemala]] and [[Juan Lopez de Zárate]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Antequera, Oaxaca|Oaxaca]] did not object. This resulted in a new resolution to be presented to viceroy Mendoza.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Giménez Fernández|1971|pp=104–05}}&lt;/ref&gt; His last act as Bishop of Chiapas was writing a ''[[Sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)#The Manuals of confession in the Middle Ages|confesionario]]'', a manual for the administration of the sacrament of confession in his diocese, still refusing absolution to unrepentant encomenderos. Las Casas appointed a vicar for his diocese and set out for Europe in December 1546, arriving in Lisbon in April 1547 and in Spain on November 1547.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Giménez Fernández|1971|p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Valladolid debate ===
{{main|Valladolid debate}}
[[File:Juan Ginés de Sepúlveda.jpg|thumb|[[Juan Ginés de Sepúlveda]], Las Casas's opponent in the [[Valladolid debate]]]]
Las Casas returned to Spain, leaving behind many conflicts and unresolved issues. Arriving in Spain he was met by a barrage of accusations, many of them based on his Confesionario and its 12 rules, which many of his opponents found to be in essence a denial of the legitimacy of Spanish rule of its colonies, and hence a form of [[treason]]. The Crown had for example received a fifth of the large number of slaves taken in the recent [[Mixtón War]], and so could not be held clean of guilt under Las Casas's strict rules. In 1548 the Crown decreed that all copies of Las Casas's Confesionario be burnt, and his Franciscan adversary, Motolinia obliged and sent back a report to Spain. Las Casas defended himself by writing two treatises on the "Just Title" – arguing that the only legality with which the Spaniards could claim titles over realms in the New World was through peaceful proselytizing. All warfare was illegal and unjust and only through the papal mandate of peacefully bringing Christianity to heathen peoples could "Just Titles" be acquired.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Wagner|Parish|1967|pp=170–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a part of Las Casas's defense by offense, he had to argue against [[Juan Ginés de Sepúlveda]]. Sepúlveda was a doctor of theology and law who, in his book ''Democrates Alter, sive de justis causis apud Indos'' (Another Democrates /or A New Democrates, or on the Just Causes of War against the Indians) had argued that some native peoples were incapable of ruling themselves and should be pacified forcefully. The book was deemed unsound for publication by the theologians of Salamanca and Alcalá for containing unsound doctrine, but the pro-encomendero faction seized on Sepúlveda as their intellectual champion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Wagner|Parish|1967|pp=174–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to settle the issues, a formal debate was organized, the famous [[Valladolid debate]], which took place in 1550–51 with Sepúlveda and Las Casas each presenting their arguments in front of a council of jurists and theologians. First Sepúlveda read the conclusions of his ''Democrates Alter'', and then the council listened to Las Casas read his counterarguments in the form of an "Apología". Sepúlveda argued that the subjugation of certain Indians was warranted because of their sins against Natural Law; that their low level of civilization required civilized masters to maintain social order; that they should be made Christian and that this in turn required them to be pacified; and that only the Spanish could defend weak Indians against the abuses of the stronger ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Losada|1971|pp=285–300}}&lt;/ref&gt; Las Casas countered that the scriptures did not in fact support war against all heathens, only against certain [[Biblical Canaanites|Canaanite]] tribes; that the Indians were not at all uncivilized nor lacking social order; that peaceful mission was the only true way of converting the natives; and finally that some weak Indians suffering at the hands of stronger ones was preferable to all Indians suffering at the hands of Spaniards.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Wagner|Parish|1967|pp=178–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The judge, Fray [[Domingo de Soto]], summarised the arguments. Sepúlveda addressed Las Casas's arguments with twelve refutations, which were again countered by Las Casas. The judges then deliberated on the arguments presented for several months before coming to a verdict.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Wagner|Parish|1967|p=1977}}&lt;!--suspect page number--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The verdict was inconclusive, and both debaters claimed that they had won.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Wagner|Parish|1967|pp=181–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1552, Las Casas published ''[[A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies]]''. This book, written a decade earlier and sent to the attention of then-prince [[Philip II of Spain]], contained accounts of the abuses committed by some Spaniards against Native Americans during the early stages of colonization. In 1555 his old Franciscan adversary [[Toribio de Benavente Motolinia]] wrote a letter in which he described Las Casas as an ignorant, arrogant troublemaker. Benavente described indignantly how Las Casas had once denied baptism to an aging Indian who had walked many leagues to receive it, only on the grounds that he did not believe that the man had received sufficient doctrinal instruction. This letter, which reinvoked the old conflict over the requirements for the [[sacrament]] of [[baptism]] between the two orders, was intended to bring Las Casas in disfavour. However, it did not succeed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Wagner|Parish|1967|pp=98–100, 243–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Later years and death ===
[[File:Valladolid San Gregorio 20080815.jpg|thumb|The façade of the Colegio de San Gregorio in Valladolid, where Las Casas spent his final decades]]
Having resigned the Bishopric of Chiapas, Las Casas spent the rest of his life working closely with the imperial court in matters relating to the Indies. In 1551 he rented a cell at the [[Colegio de San Gregorio|College of San Gregorio]], where he lived with his assistant and friend Fray Rodrigo de Ladrada.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Wagner|Parish|1967|pp=183–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued working as a kind of procurator for the natives of the Indies, many of whom directed petitions to him to speak to the Emperor on their behalf. Sometimes indigenous nobility even related their cases to him in Spain, for example, the [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] noble [[Francisco Tenamaztle]] from [[Nochistlán]]. His influence at court was so great that some even considered that he had the final word in choosing the members of the [[Council of the Indies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Wagner|Parish|1967|pp=191–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One matter in which he invested much effort was the political situation of the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]]. In Peru, power struggles between [[conquistador]]s and the viceroy became an open civil war in which the conquistadors led by [[Gonzalo Pizarro]] rebelled against the New Laws and defeated and executed the viceroy [[Blasco Núñez Vela]] in 1546. The Emperor sent [[Pedro de la Gasca]], a friend of Las Casas, to reinstate the rule of law, and he in turn defeated Pizarro. In order to restabilize the political situation the encomenderos started pushing not only for the repeal of the New Laws, but for turning the encomiendas into perpetual patrimony of the encomenderos – the worst possible outcome from Las Casas's point of view. The encomenderos offered to buy the rights to the encomiendas from the crown, and Charles V was inclined to accept since his wars had left him in deep economic troubles. Las Casas worked hard to convince the king that it would be a bad economic decision, that it would return the viceroyalty to the brink of open rebellion, and could result in the crown losing the colony entirely. The Emperor, probably because of the doubts caused by Las Casas's arguments, never took a final decision on the issue of the encomiendas.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Wagner|Parish|1967|loc=ch. XVII}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1561, he finished his ''Historia General de las Indias'' and signed it over to the College of San Gregorio, stipulating that it could not be published until after forty years. In fact it was not published for 314 years, finally being done so in 1875. He also had to repeatedly defend himself against accusations of treason: someone, possibly [[Juan Ginés de Sepúlveda|Sepúlveda]], denounced him to the [[Spanish Inquisition]], but nothing came from the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Wagner|Parish|1967|pp=186–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Las Casas also appeared as a witness in the case of the Inquisition against his friend Archbishop [[Bartolomé Carranza|Bartolomé Carranza de Miranda]], who had been falsely accused of heresy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Wagner|Parish|1967|pp=222–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Giménez Fernández|1971|p=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1565 he wrote his last will, signing over his immense library to the college. Bartolomé de Las Casas died on July 18, 1566, in Madrid.&lt;ref name="Hernández2015"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hernández|first=Bernat|title=Bartolomé de las Casas (Colección Españoles Eminentes)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ulTnBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT192| language=es |accessdate=2018-07-16|date=2015-03-26|publisher=Penguin Random House Grupo Editorial España|isbn=9788430617340|page=192 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Works ==

=== ''Memorial de Remedios para las Indias'' ===
The text, written 1516, starts by describing its purpose: to present "The remedies that seem necessary in order that the evil and harm that exists in the Indies cease, and that God and our Lord the Prince may draw greater benefits than hitherto, and that the republic may be better preserved and consoled."&lt;ref name="Las Casas in Baptiste 1990 p14" /&gt;

Las Casas's first proposed remedy was a complete moratorium on the use of Indian labor in the Indies until such time as better regulations of it were set in place. This was meant simply to halt the decimation of the Indian population and to give the surviving Indians time to reconstitute themselves. Las Casas feared that at the rate the exploitation was proceeding it would be too late to hinder their annihilation unless action were taken rapidly. The second was a change in the labor policy so that instead of a colonist owning the labor of specific Indians, he would have a right to man-hours, to be carried out by no specific persons. This required the establishment of self-governing Indian communities on the land of colonists – who would themselves organize to provide the labor for their patron. The colonist would only have rights to a certain portion of the total labor, so that a part of the Indians were always resting and taking care of the sick. He proposed 12 other remedies, all having the specific aim of improving the situation for the Indians and limiting the powers that colonists were able to exercise over them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Baptiste|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second part of the ''Memorial'' described suggestions for the social and political organization of Indian communities relative to colonial ones. Las Casas advocated the dismantlement of the city of Asunción and the subsequent gathering of Indians into communities of about 1,000 Indians to be situated as satellites of Spanish towns or mining areas. Here, Las Casas argued, Indians could be better governed, better taught and indoctrinated in the Christian faith, and would be easier to protect from abuse than if they were in scattered settlements. Each town would have a royal hospital built with four wings in the shape of a cross, where up to 200 sick Indians could be cared for at a time. He described in detail social arrangements, distribution of work, how provisions would be divided and even how table manners were to be introduced. Regarding expenses, he argued that "this should not seem expensive or difficult, because after all, everything comes from them [the Indians] and they work for it and it is theirs."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Baptiste|1990|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; He even drew up a budget of each pueblo's expenses to cover wages for administrators, clerics, Bachelors of Latin, doctors, surgeons, pharmacists, advocates, ranchers, miners, muleteers, hospitalers, pig herders, fishermen, etc. He showed that this arrangement could easily be maintained and gold still be extracted at a profit.

''A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies''{{efn|Also translated and published in English as ''A Brief Account of the Destruction of the Indies'', among several other variants.}} ({{lang-es|Brevísima relación de la destrucción de las Indias}}) is an account written in 1542 (published in [[Seville]] in 1552) about the mistreatment of the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] in colonial times and sent to then-Prince [[Philip II of Spain]].

One of the stated purposes for writing the account was Las Casas's fear of Spain coming under [[divine punishment]] and his concern for the souls of the native peoples. The account was one of the first attempts by a Spanish writer of the colonial era to depict the unfair treatment that the indigenous people endured during the early stages of the Spanish conquest of the [[Greater Antilles]], particularly the island of [[Hispaniola]]. Las Casas's point of view can be described as being heavily against some of the Spanish methods of colonization, which, as he described them, inflicted great losses on the indigenous occupants of the islands. In addition, his critique towards the colonizers served to bring awareness to his audience on the true meaning of Christianity, to dismantle any misconceptions on evangelization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=de las Casas|first1=Bartolomé|title=A Brief Account of the Destruction of the Indies|date=9 January 2007|publisher=Project Gutenberg|pages=23|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His account was largely responsible for the adoption of the [[New Laws of 1542]], which abolished native slavery for the first time in European colonial history and led to the [[Valladolid debate]].

The book became an important element in the creation and propagation of the so-called [[Black Legend]] – the tradition of describing the Spanish empire as exceptionally morally corrupt and violent. It was republished several times by groups that were critical of the Spanish realm for political or religious reasons. The first edition in translation was published in Dutch in 1578, during the religious persecution of Dutch Protestants by the Spanish crown, followed by editions in French (1578), English (1583), and German (1599) – all countries where religious wars were raging. The first edition published in Spain after Las Casas's death appeared in [[Barcelona]] during the [[Reapers' War|Catalan Revolt]] of 1646. The book was banned by the [[Spanish Inquisition|Aragonese inquisition]] in 1659.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Keen|1969|p=712}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The images described by Las Casas were later depicted by [[Theodore de Bry]] in copper plate engravings that helped expand the [[Black Legend]] against Spain.

=== ''Apologetic History of the Indies'' ===
[[File:Bartolomé de las Casas (1552) Disputa o controversia con Ginés de Sepúlveda.png|thumb|Cover of the ''Disputa o controversia con Ginés de Sepúlveda'' (1552), Bartolomé de las Casas]]
The ''Apologetic Summary History of the People of These Indies'' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''Apologética historia summaria de las gentes destas Indias'') was first written as the 68th chapter of the ''General History of the Indies'', but Las Casas changed it into a volume of its own, recognizing that the material was not historical. The material contained in the ''Apologetic History'' is primarily [[ethnography|ethnographic]] accounts of the indigenous cultures of the Indies – the [[Taíno]], the [[Ciboney]], and the [[Guanahatabey]], but it also contains descriptions of many of the other indigenous cultures that Las Casas learned about through his travels and readings. The history is [[apologia|apologetic]] because it is written as a defense of the cultural level of the Indians, arguing throughout that indigenous peoples of the Americas were just as civilized as the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]], [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] civilizations—and more civilized than some European civilizations. It was in essence a comparative ethnography comparing practices and customs of European and American cultures and evaluating them according to whether they were good or bad, seen from a Christian viewpoint.

He wrote: "I have declared and demonstrated openly and concluded, from chapter 22 to the end of this whole book, that all people of these our Indies are human, so far as is possible by the natural and human way and without the light of faith – had their republics, places, towns, and cities most abundant and well provided for, and did not lack anything to live politically and socially, and attain and enjoy civil happiness.... And they equaled many nations of this world that are renowned and considered civilized, and they surpassed many others, and to none were they inferior. Among those they equaled were the Greeks and the Romans, and they surpassed them by many good and better customs. They surpassed also the English and the French and some of the people of our own Spain; and they were incomparably superior to countless others, in having good customs and lacking many evil ones."&lt;ref name="Historia Apologetica, Wagner &amp; Parish 1967" /&gt; This work in which Las Casas combined his own ethnographic observations with those of other writers, and compared customs and cultures between different peoples, has been characterized as an early beginning of the discipline of [[anthropology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Hanke|1951|pp=88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''History of the Indies'' ===
The ''History of the Indies'' is a three-volume work begun in 1527 while Las Casas was in the Convent of Puerto de Plata. It found its final form in 1561, when he was working in the Colegio de San Gregorio. Originally planned as a six-volume work, each volume describes a decade of the history of the Indies from the arrival of [[Christopher Columbus]] in 1492 to 1520, and most of it is an eye-witness account.&lt;ref name="Historia de las Indias, 5 volumes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Historia de Las Indias, vol 1" /&gt; It was in the ''History of the Indies'' that Las Casas finally regretted his advocacy for African slavery, and included a sincere apology, writing, "I soon repented and judged myself guilty of ignorance. I came to realize that black slavery was as unjust as Indian slavery... and I was not sure that my ignorance and good faith would secure me in the eyes of God." (Vol II, p.&amp;nbsp;257)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Pierce|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Las Casas's legacy has been highly controversial. In the years following his death, his ideas became taboo in the Spanish realm, and he was seen as a nearly heretical extremist. The accounts written by his enemies [[Francisco López de Gómara|Lopez de Gómara]] and [[Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés|Oviedo]] were widely read and published. As the [[British Empire]] rose to power and hostilities between the British and Spanish began, the British used Las Casas's accounts of Spanish cruelty as a political tool, as part of the foundation of what Spanish nationalists have called the [[Black Legend]], the tendency of historians to slander Spain for its imperial past but to look mildly at the same undertakings by others such as the British.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Keen|1971|pp=46–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposition to Las Casas reached its climax in historography with Spanish right-wing, nationalist historians in the late 19th and early 20th centuries constructing a pro-Spanish [[White Legend]], arguing that the Spanish Empire was benevolent and just and denying any adverse consequences of Spanish colonialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Keen|1971|pp=50–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Comas passim"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Comas|1971|loc=''passim''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spanish pro-imperial historians such as [[Marcelino Menéndez y Pelayo|Menéndez y Pelayo]], [[Ramón Menéndez Pidal|Menéndez Pidal]], and J. Pérez de Barrada depicted Las Casas as a madman, describing him as a "[[paranoia|paranoic]]" and a [[monomania]]c given to exaggeration,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Comas|1971|pp=520–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a traitor towards his own nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Comas|1971|pp=524–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Menéndez Pelayo also accused Las Casas of having been instrumental in suppressing the publication of [[Juan Ginés de Sepúlveda]]'s "Democrates Alter" (also called ''Democrates Secundus'') out of spite, but other historians find that to be unlikely since it was rejected by the theologians of both [[Alcalá de Henares|Alcalá]] and [[Salamanca]], who were unlikely to be influenced by Las Casas.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Comas|1971|p=515}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Critiques ===
{{See also|Black Legend}}
Las Casas has also often been accused of exaggerating the atrocities he described in the Indies, some scholars holding that the initial population figures given by him were too high, which would make the population decline look worse than it actually was, and that epidemics of European disease were the prime cause of the population decline, not violence and exploitation. Demographic studies such as those of colonial Mexico by [[Sherburne F. Cook]] in the mid-20th century suggested that the decline in the first years of the conquest was indeed drastic, ranging between 80 and 90%, due of course to many different causes but all ultimately traceable to the arrival of the Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Keen|1971|pp=44–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overwhelming main cause was disease introduced by the Europeans. It has also been noted that exaggeration of numbers was the norm in writing in 16th-century accounts, and both contemporary detractors and supporters of Las Casas were guilty of similar exaggerations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Comas|1971|pp=502–04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Wagner|Parish|1967|p=245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been suggested that the atrocities that Las Casas described were exaggerated or even invented, but that is not generally considered likely as Las Casas was far from the only person to be deeply worried about abuse and mistreatment of the Indians. The Dominican friars [[Antonio de Montesinos]] and [[Pedro de Córdoba]] had reported extensive violence already in the first decade of the conquest of the Indies, and throughout the conquest of the Americas, there were reports of abuse of the natives by friars and priests and ordinary citizens, and many massacres of indigenous people were reported in full by those who perpetrated them. Even some of Las Casas's enemies, such as [[Toribio de Benavente Motolinia]], reported many gruesome atrocities committed against the Indians by the colonizers. All in all, modern historians tend to disregard the numerical figures given by Las Casas, but they maintain that his general picture of a violent and abusive conquest represented reality.&lt;ref name="Comas passim" /&gt;

One persistent point of criticism has been Las Casas's repeated suggestions of replacing Indian with African slave labor. Even though he repented that position later in his life and included an apology in his ''History of the Indies'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Comas|1971|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; some later criticism held him responsible for the institution of the [[Atlantic slave trade]]. One detractor, the abolitionist [[David Walker (abolitionist)|David Walker]], called Las Casas a "wretch... stimulated by sordid avarice only," holding him responsible for the enslavement of thousands of Africans.&lt;ref name="Walker's Appeal" /&gt; Other historians, such as [[John Fiske (philosopher)|John Fiske]] writing in 1900, denied that Las Casas's suggestions affected the development of the slave trade. [[Benjamin Keen]] likewise did not consider Las Casas to have had any substantial impact on the slave trade, which was well in place before he began writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Keen|1971|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; That view is contradicted by [[Sylvia Wynter]], who argued that Las Casas's 1516 Memorial was the direct cause of Charles V granting permission in 1518 to transport the first 4,000 African slaves to [[Jamaica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Wynter|1984a|pp=25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Revisionist histories of the late 20th century have argued for a more nuanced image of Las Casas, suggesting that he was neither a saint nor a fanatic but a person with exceptional willpower and a sense of justice, which sometimes led him into arrogance, stubbornness, and hypocrisy. Some historians such as {{harv|Castro|2007}} argue that he was more of a politician than a humanitarian and that his liberation policies were always combined with schemes to make colonial extraction of resources from the natives more efficient. He also argues that Las Casas failed to realize that by seeking to replace indigenous spirituality with Christianity, he was undertaking a religious colonialism that was more intrusive than the physical one.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Castro|2007|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; That critique has been rejected by other historians as facile and anachronistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Boruchoff|2008|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Rubiés|2007|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1848, Ciudad de San Cristóbal, then the capital of the Mexican state of [[Chiapas]], was renamed [[San Cristóbal de Las Casas]] in honor of its first bishop. His work is a particular inspiration behind the work of the Las Casas Institute at [[Blackfriars Hall]], Oxford.&lt;ref name="Las Casas Institute" /&gt; He is also often cited as a predecessor of the [[liberation theology]] movement. He is commemorated by the [[Church of England]] in the [[Calendar of saints (Church of England)|Calendar of Saints]] on July 20, [[Calendar of saints (Episcopal Church)#July|The Episcopal Church (USA)]] on July 18, and at the [[Calendar of Saints (Lutheran)|Evangelical Lutheran Church]] on July 17. In the [[Catholic Church]], the Dominicans introduced his cause for [[canonization]] in 1976.&lt;ref name="McBrien" /&gt; In 2002 the Church began the process for his [[beatification]].

He has also come to be seen as an early advocate for a concept of universal [[human rights]].{{efn|{{harvnb|Glendon|2003}} writes: "When Latin American nations gained independence in the 19th century, those two strains converged, and merged with an older, more universalist, natural law tradition. The result was a distinctively Latin American form of rights discourse. [[Paolo Carozza]] traces the roots of that discourse to a distinctive application, and extension, of Thomistic moral philosophy to the injustices of Spanish conquests in the New World. The key figure in that development seems to have been Bartolomé de Las Casas, a 16th-century Spanish bishop who condemned slavery and championed the cause of Indians on the basis of a natural right to liberty grounded in their membership in a single common humanity. 'All the peoples of the world are humans,' Las Casas wrote, and 'all the races of humankind are one.' According to [[#{{harvid|Tierney|1997}}|Brian Tierney]], Las Casas and other Spanish Dominican philosophers laid the groundwork for a doctrine of natural rights that was independent of religious revelation 'by drawing on a juridical tradition that derived natural rights and natural law from human rationality and free will, and by appealing to [[Aristotelian philosophy]].'"}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Carozza|2003|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was among the first to develop a view of unity among humankind, stating that "All people of the world are humans," and that they had a natural right to [[liberty]] – a combination of [[Thomism|Thomist]] rights philosophy with [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustinian]] political theology.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Tierney|1997|pp=272–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this capacity, an [[ecumenical]] human rights institute located in [[San Cristóbal de las Casas]], the Centro Fray Bartolomé de las Casas de Derechos Humanos, was established by Bishop [[Samuel Ruiz]] in 1989.&lt;ref name="Frayba" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Tangeman, ''Mexico at the Crossroads: Politics, the Church, and the Poor''. Maryknoll NY: Orbis Books 1995, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

He is also featured in the [[Guatemalan quetzal]] one cent (Q0.01) coins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bills and Currency in Current Circulation|url=http://www.banguat.gob.gt/inc/ver.asp?id=/en/currency%20and%20bills/Monedas%20y%20Billetes%20Translation.htm&amp;e=18108|publisher=Banco de Guatemala|accessdate=12 October 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923100258/http://www.banguat.gob.gt/inc/ver.asp?id=%2Fen%2Fcurrency%20and%20bills%2FMonedas%20y%20Billetes%20Translation.htm&amp;e=18108|archivedate=September 23, 2013|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The small town of [[Lascassas, Tennessee]], in the United States has also been named after him.&lt;ref name=school&gt;[http://www.les.rcs.k12.tn.us/Welcome.htm A Glimpse at the History of Lascassas School] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211155113/http://www.les.rcs.k12.tn.us/Welcome.htm |date=February 11, 2012 }}, Lascassas School website, accessed April 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Becker is best known as the largest provider of training for candidates who are preparing to sit for the [[United States]] (US) [[Uniform Certified Public Accountant Examination|CPA Exam]] in order to become [[Certified Public Accountant]]s.&lt;ref name="LA Times — Exam Changes"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hale|first=Sarah|title=Changes Could Make Grueling CPA Test Even Tougher|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/may/03/business/fi-58731|accessdate=June 20, 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=May 3, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sun-Times — Exam Programs"&gt;{{cite news|last=Plys|first=Cate|title=Programs multiply to assist students taking CPA exam|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=CSTB&amp;p_theme=cstb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB36DAB33F72757&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|accessdate=June 20, 2012|newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times|date=January 5, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Investor's Business Daily"&gt;{{cite news|last=Linecker|first=Adelia Cellini|title=Set Up Your Study Path|url=http://news.investors.com/article/560950/201101261620/set-up-your-study-path.htm|accessdate=June 20, 2012|newspaper=Investor's Business Daily|date=January 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Becker offers its CPA Exam Review in the form of live classes (which take place in locations throughout the US and around the world), as well as online courses, and a self-study course on disc.&lt;ref name="Vault Guide"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jason Alba |author2=Manisha Bathija |author3=Matt Thornton |title=Vault Career Guide to Accounting|year=2005|publisher=Vault Inc.|location=New York, NY|isbn=1-58131-328-4|pages=125|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zthQTa5D29IC&amp;lpg=PA60&amp;dq=becker%20cpa&amp;pg=PA60#v=onepage&amp;q=becker%20cpa&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a measure of its influence on the accounting industry, the [[AICPA]]'s ''[[Journal of Accountancy]]'' estimated that as many as half of the CPAs in the United States have passed the CPA Exam with the help of Becker's course.&lt;ref name="Journal of Accountancy — Newt Becker Obit"&gt;{{cite news|last=Tysiac|first=Ken|title=CPA exam prep innovator Newton D.

Originally developed in 1957 by accountant and entrepreneur [[Newton Becker]] as a training course for fellow employees of [[Price Waterhouse]], Becker CPA Review was launched as an independent company in 1960. The company grew rapidly, and by the 1980s it had classroom locations in more than 90 cities.&lt;ref name="Sun-Times — Exam Programs" /&gt; Becker eventually sold the company to DeVry in 1996, partly due to changes in the industry.&lt;ref name="Journal of Accountancy — Newt Becker Obit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chicago Tribune — DeVry Acquisition"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ziemba|first=Stanley|title=DeVry Acquires CPA Training Firm|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1996-06-20/business/9606200247_1_becker-cpa-review-devry-acquires|accessdate=June 20, 2012|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=June 20, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to its CPA Exam Review, Becker currently offers exam preparation for a number of other international accounting credentials: [[Certified Management Accountant]] (CMA), [[Chartered Institute of Management Accountants]] (CIMA) and Diploma in International Financial Reporting (DipIFR) certifications. Becker also provides [[continuing professional education]] (CPE) and project management training.

In 2012, Becker acquired Falcon Physician Reviews and expanded into the healthcare education field.&lt;ref name="NASDAQ — Falcon Acquisition"&gt;{{cite news|title=DeVry Unit Acquires Falcon Physician Reviews|url=http://www.nasdaq.com/article/devry-unit-acquires-falcon-physician-reviews-20120403-01222|accessdate=June 20, 2012|newspaper=NASDAQ.com|date=April 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Through Falcon, Becker now offers review programs for physicians who are preparing for the [[United States Medical Licensing Examination]] (USMLE) and the [[Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensing Examination]] (COMLEX).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3217">The '''Computer Ethics Institute''' (CEI) is a nonprofit research, education, and public policy organization focused on the issues, dilemmas, and challenges of advancing information technology within ethical frameworks. CEI is based in Washington, DC, USA. 

CEI's mission is to facilitate the examination and recognition of ethical issues in the development and use of modern information technologies. The output of this discussion provides educational resources and governing rules that have been adopted by many schools, organizations, and corporations around the globe.

CEI's constituency is composed of professionals from the academic, corporate and public policy, information technology and religious communities. In addition, its constituency is multi-disciplined, multi-cultural, cross-generational and international. 

== History ==
CEI was founded in 1985 as the Coalition for Computer Ethics. Founding members came from [[The Brookings Institution]], The [[International Business Machines Corporation]] (IBM), The Washington Consulting Group and The Washington Technological Consortium. The consortium’s goal was to provide methods to increase an awareness of the ethical ramifications inherent in the use of Information Technology. CEI is one of the first organizations to confront the ethical and public policy issues surrounding the advancement of information technology

== Ten Commandments of Computer Ethics ==
This short code of ethics for using computers and information technology is the best-known product of CEI. It is often quoted in college-level textbooks and adopted for practical use. The biblical reference in the title does not imply any religious affiliation: it merely summarizes the importance of the rules compiled.  (See main article: [[Ten Commandments of Computer Ethics]].)

''The Ten Commandments of Computer Ethics''
# Thou shalt not use a computer to harm other people.
# Thou shalt not interfere with other people's computer work.
# Thou shalt not snoop around in other people's computer files.
# Thou shalt not use a computer to steal.
# Thou shalt not use a computer to bear false witness.
# Thou shalt not copy or use proprietary software for which you have not paid.
# Thou shalt not use other people's computer resources without authorization or proper compensation.
# Thou shalt not appropriate other people's intellectual output.

{{Party politics}}

The '''conservation movement''', also known as '''nature conservation''', is a political, environmental, and social movement that seeks to protect [[natural resource]]s including animal and plant species as well as their habitat for the future.

The early conservation movement included [[fisheries]] and wildlife management, water, [[soil]] conservation, and [[sustainable forestry]]. The contemporary conservation movement has broadened from the early movement's emphasis on use of sustainable yield of natural resources and preservation of [[wilderness]] areas to include preservation of [[biodiversity]]. Some say the conservation movement is part of the broader and more far-reaching [[environmental movement]], while others argue that they differ both in ideology and practice. Chiefly in the United States, conservation is seen as differing from [[environmentalism]] in that it aims to preserve natural resources expressly for their continued [[sustainable]] use by humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Early history===
[[File:Sylva paper 1662.jpg|right|thumb| ''Sylva, or A Discourse of Forest-Trees and the Propagation of Timber in His Majesty's Dominions,'' title page of the first edition (1664).]]
The conservation movement can be traced back to [[John Evelyn]]'s work ''[[Sylva, or A Discourse of Forest-Trees and the Propagation of Timber|Sylva]]'', presented as a paper to the [[Royal Society]] in 1662. Published as a book two years later, it was one of the most highly influential texts on [[forestry]] ever published.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Evelyn]], ''Sylva, Or A Discourse of Forest Trees ... with an Essay on the Life and Works of the Author by John Nisbet'', Fourth Edition (1706), reprinted London: Doubleday &amp; Co., 1908, V1, p. lxv; online edn, March 2007 [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/20778/20778-h/20778-h.htm], accessed 29 Dec 2012. This source (John Nisbet) states: "There can be no doubt that John Evelyn, both during his own lifetime and throughout the two centuries which have elapsed since his death in 1706, has exerted more individual influence, through his charming ''Sylva'', ... than can be ascribed to any other individual." Nisbet adds that "Evelyn was by no means the first [author] who wrote on [forestry]. That honour belongs to Master [[Anthony Fitzherbert|Fitzherbert]], whose ''Boke of Husbandrie'' was published in 1534" (V1, p. lxvi).&lt;/ref&gt; Timber resources in England were becoming dangerously depleted at the time, and Evelyn advocated the importance of conserving the forests by managing the rate of depletion and ensuring that the cut down trees get replenished.

The field developed during the 18th century, especially in [[Prussia]] and France where scientific forestry methods were developed. These methods were first applied rigorously in [[British India]] from the early-19th century. The government was interested in the use of [[forest produce]] and began managing the forests with measures to reduce the risk of wildfire in order to protect the "household" of nature, as it was then termed. This early ecological idea was in order to preserve the growth of delicate [[teak]] trees, which was an important resource for the [[Royal Navy]]. Concerns over teak depletion were raised as early as 1799 and 1805 when the Navy was undergoing a massive expansion during the [[Napoleonic War]]s; this pressure led to the first formal conservation Act, which prohibited the felling of small teak trees. The first forestry officer was appointed in 1806 to regulate and preserve the trees necessary for shipbuilding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://edugreen.teri.res.in/explore/forestry/history.htm|title=History of forests in India}}&lt;/ref&gt; This promising start received a setback in the 1820s and 30s, when [[laissez-faire]] economics and complaints from private landowners brought these early conservation attempts to an end.

===Origins of the modern conservation movement===
Conservation was revived in the mid-19th century, with the first practical application of scientific conservation principles to the forests of India. The conservation ethic that began to evolve included three core principles: that human activity damaged the [[Natural environment|environment]], that there was a [[civic duty]] to maintain the environment for future generations, and that scientific, empirically based methods should be applied to ensure this duty was carried out. Sir [[James Ranald Martin]] was prominent in promoting this ideology, publishing many medico-topographical reports that demonstrated the scale of damage wrought through large-scale deforestation and desiccation, and lobbying extensively for the institutionalization of forest conservation activities in [[British India]] through the establishment of [[Indian Forest Service|Forest Departments]].&lt;ref&gt;Stebbing, E.P (1922)''The forests of India'' vol. 1, pp. 72-81&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Percy Stebbing]] warned of desertification of India. The [[Madras]] Board of Revenue started local conservation efforts in 1842, headed by [[Alexander Gibson (botanist)|Alexander Gibson]], a professional [[botany|botanist]] who systematically adopted a forest conservation program based on scientific principles. This was the first case of state management of forests in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Barton |first=Greg |url=https://books.google.com/?id=WDYlNljAP5AC|title=Empire Forestry and the Origins of Environmentalism|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=48|isbn=9781139434607 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These local attempts gradually received more attention by the British government as the unregulated felling of trees continued unabated. In 1850, the [[British Association]] in Edinburgh formed a committee to study forest destruction at the behest of [[Hugh Francis Cleghorn|Dr. Hugh Cleghorn]] a pioneer in the nascent conservation movement.

He had become interested in [[Sustainable forest management|forest conservation]] in [[Mysore]] in 1847 and gave several lectures at the Association on the failure of agriculture in India. These lectures influenced the government under [[Governor-General of India|Governor-General]] [[James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie|Lord Dalhousie]] to introduce the first permanent and large-scale forest conservation program in the world in 1855, a model that soon spread to [[British empire|other colonies]], as well the [[United States]]. In the same year, Cleghorn organised the [[Tamil Nadu Forest Department|Madras Forest Department]] and in 1860 the Department banned the use [[shifting cultivation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2007/11/05/stories/2007110550080500.htm|title=A life for forestry|last=MUTHIAH|first=S. |date=Nov 5, 2007|work=Metro Plus Chennai|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=2009-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cleghorn's 1861 manual, ''The forests and gardens of South India'', became the definitive work on the subject and was widely used by forest assistants in the subcontinent.&lt;ref name="Cleghorn"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cleghorn|first=Hugh Francis Clarke |title=The Forests and Gardens of South India |publisher=W.

[[File:Sir William Schlich07.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Schlich, in the middle of the seated row, with students from the forestry school at Oxford, on a visit to the forests of Saxony in the year 1892.]]
Sir [[Dietrich Brandis]], a [[Germany|German]] forester, joined the British service in 1856 as superintendent of the teak forests of Pegu division in eastern [[Myanmar|Burma]]. During that time Burma's [[teak]] forests were controlled by militant [[Karen people|Karen]] tribals. He introduced the "taungya" system,&lt;ref&gt;King KFS (1968). "Agro-silviculture (the taungya system)". University of Ibadan / Dept. of Forestry, Bulletin no. 1, 109&lt;/ref&gt; in which Karen villagers provided labour for clearing, planting and weeding teak plantations. After seven years in Burma, Brandis was appointed Inspector General of Forests in India, a position he served in for 20 years. He formulated new forest legislation and helped establish research and training institutions. The [[Imperial Forest School]] at [[Dehradun]] was founded by him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weil|first1=Benjamin|title=Conservation, Exploitation, and Cultural Change in the Indian Forest Service, 1875-1927|journal=Environmental History|date=1 April 2006|volume=11|issue=2|pages=319–343|doi=10.1093/envhis/11.2.319|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233861694_Conservation_Exploitation_and_Cultural_Change_in_the_Indian_Forest_Service_1875-1927}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Madhav Gadgil and Ramachandra Guha, ''This Fissured Land: An Ecological History of India'' (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

Germans were prominent in the forestry administration of British India. As well as Brandis, [[Berthold Ribbentrop]] and [[Sir William P.D. Schlich]] brought new methods to Indian conservation, the latter becoming the Inspector-General in 1883 after Brandis stepped down. Schlich helped to establish the journal ''[[Indian Forester]]'' in 1874, and became the founding director of the first [[forestry]] school in England at [[Royal Indian Engineering College|Cooper's Hill]] in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;Burley, Jeffery, et al. 2009. "A History of Forestry at Oxford", ''British Scholar'', Vol. 1, No. 2., pp.236-261. Accessed: May 6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; He authored the five-volume ''Manual of Forestry'' (1889–96) on [[silviculture]], [[forest management]], [[forest protection]], and [[forest utilisation]], which became the standard and enduring textbook for forestry students.

{{Main|Conservation in the United States}}
The American movement received its inspiration from 19th century works that exalted the inherent value of nature, quite apart from human usage. Author [[Henry David Thoreau]] (1817-1862) made key philosophical contributions that exalted nature. Thoreau was interested in peoples' relationship with nature and studied this by living close to nature in a simple life. He published his experiences in the book ''[[Walden]],'' which argued that people should become intimately close with nature. The ideas of [[Dietrich Brandis|Sir Brandis]], [[Sir William P.D. Schlich]] and [[Carl A. Schenck]] were also very influential - [[Gifford Pinchot]], the first chief of the [[USDA Forest Service]], relied heavily upon Brandis' advice for introducing professional forest management in the U.S. and on how to structure the Forest Service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asiaticsociety.org.bd/journals/Golden_jubilee_vol/articles/H_468%20(Brett%20M%20Benet).htm America has been the context for both the origins of conservation history and its modern form, environmental history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313144333/http://www.asiaticsociety.org.bd/journals/Golden_jubilee_vol/articles/H_468%20%28Brett%20M%20Benet%29.htm |date=2012-03-13 }}.

Both conservationists and preservationists appeared in political debates during the [[Progressive Era]] (the 1890s&amp;mdash;early 1920s). There were three main positions. The laissez-faire position held that owners of private property—including lumber and mining companies, should be allowed to do anything they wished for their property.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel P. Hays, ''Conservation and the Gospel of Efficiency: The Progressive Conservation Movement, 1890-1920'' (1959)&lt;/ref&gt;

The conservationists, led by future President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and his close ally [[George Bird Grinnell]], were motivated by the wanton waste that was taking place at the hand of market forces, including logging and hunting.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Redekop, "Embodying the Story: The Conservation Leadership of Theodore Roosevelt" in ''Leadership'' (2015).  DOI: 10.1177/1742715014546875.  [http://cnu.edu/leadershipstudies/faculty/pdf/redekop-embodying_the_story_theodore_roosevelts_conservation_leadership.pdf online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160114045519/http://cnu.edu/leadershipstudies/faculty/pdf/redekop-embodying_the_story_theodore_roosevelts_conservation_leadership.pdf |date=2016-01-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice resulted in placing a large number of North American game species on the edge of extinction. Roosevelt recognized that the laissez-faire approach of the U.S. Government was too wasteful and inefficient. In any case, they noted, most of the natural resources in the western states were already owned by the federal government.  The best course of action, they argued, was a long-term plan devised by national experts to maximize the long-term economic benefits of natural resources. To accomplish the mission, Roosevelt and Grinnell formed the [[Boone and Crockett Club]] in 1887. The Club was made up of the best minds and influential men of the day. The [[Boone and Crockett Club]]'s contingency of conservationists, scientists, politicians, and intellectuals became Roosevelt's closest advisers during his march to preserve wildlife and habitat across North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archives of the Boone and Crockett Club|url=http://cdm16013.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p16013coll13/id/1220/rec/1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Preservationists, led by [[John Muir]] (1838–1914), argued that the conservation policies were not strong enough to protect the interest of the natural world because they continued to focus on the natural world as a source of economic production.

The debate between conservation and preservation reached its peak in the public debates over the construction of California's [[O'Shaughnessy Dam (California)|Hetch Hetchy dam]] in [[Yosemite National Park]] which supplies the water supply of San Francisco. Muir, leading the [[Sierra Club]], declared that the valley must be preserved for the sake of its beauty: "No holier temple has ever been consecrated by the heart of man."

President [[Theodore Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] put conservationist issue high on the national agenda.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas G. Brinkley, ''The Wilderness Warrior: Theodore Roosevelt and the Crusade for America'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; He worked with all the major figures of the movement, especially his chief advisor on the matter, [[Gifford Pinchot]] and was deeply committed to conserving natural resources. He encouraged the [[Newlands Reclamation Act]] of 1902 to promote federal construction of dams to irrigate small farms and placed 230 million acres (360,000&amp;nbsp;mi&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or 930,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) under federal protection. Roosevelt set aside more federal land for [[national park]]s and [[nature preserve]]s than all of his predecessors combined.&lt;ref&gt;W. Todd Benson, ''President Theodore Roosevelt's Conservations Legacy'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:TR-Enviro.JPG|Thumb|250px|right|Roosevelt was a leader in conservation, fighting to end the waste of natural resources]]

Roosevelt established the [[United States Forest Service]], signed into law the creation of five [[National parks (United States)|national parks]], and signed the year 1906 [[Antiquities Act]], under which he proclaimed 18 new [[National Monument (United States)|national monuments]]. He also established the first 51 [[bird reserve]]s, four [[game preserve]]s, and 150 [[United States National Forest|national forests]], including [[Shoshone National Forest]], the nation's first. The area of the United States that he placed under public protection totals approximately {{convert|230000000|acre|km2}}.

[[Gifford Pinchot]] had been appointed by McKinley as chief of Division of Forestry in the Department of Agriculture. In 1905, his department gained control of the national forest reserves.  Pinchot promoted private use (for a fee) under federal supervision. In 1907, Roosevelt designated 16 million acres (65,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of new national forests just minutes before a deadline.&lt;ref&gt;Char Miller, ''Seeking the Greatest Good: The Conservation Legacy of Gifford Pinchot'' (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1908, Roosevelt sponsored the [[Conference of Governors]] held in the White House, with a focus on natural resources and their most efficient use. Roosevelt delivered the opening address: "Conservation as a National Duty.".

In 1903 Roosevelt toured the Yosemite Valley with [[John Muir]], who had a very different view of conservation, and tried to minimize commercial use of water resources and forests.  Working through the Sierra Club he founded, Muir succeeded in 1905 in having Congress transfer the [[Mariposa Grove]] and Yosemite Valley to the federal government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Statutes at Large, Vol. 26, Chap. 1263, pp. 650-52.

Theodore Roosevelt's view on conservationism remained dominant for decades; - [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] authorised the building of many large-scale dams and water projects, as well as the expansion of the National Forest System to buy out sub-marginal farms.  In 1937, the [[Pittman–Robertson Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act]] was signed into law, providing funding for state agencies to carry out their conservation efforts.

====Since 1970====
Environmental reemerged on the national agenda in 1970, with Republican [[Richard Nixon]] playing a major role, especially with his creation of the [[Environmental Protection Agency]]. The debates over the public lands and environmental politics played a supporting role in the decline of liberalism and the rise of modern environmentalism. Although Americans consistently rank environmental issues as "important", polling data indicates that in the voting booth voters rank the environmental issues low relative to other political concerns.

The growth of the Republican party's political power in the inland West (apart from the Pacific coast) was facilitated by the rise of popular opposition to public lands reform.  Successful Democrats in the inland West and Alaska typically take more conservative positions on environmental issues than Democrats from the Coastal states.  Conservatives drew on new organizational networks of think tanks, industry groups, and citizen-oriented organizations, and they began to deploy new strategies that affirmed the rights of individuals to their property, protection of extraction rights, to hunt and recreate, and to pursue happiness unencumbered by the federal government at the expense of resource conservation.&lt;ref&gt;* Turner, James Morton, "The Specter of Environmentalism": Wilderness, Environmental Politics, and the Evolution of the New Right.

=== Conservation in Costa Rica ===
[[File:Areas Conservacion CR.svg|thumb|Figure 1. Costa Rica divided into different areas of conservation]]

Although the conservation movement developed in Europe in the 18th century, [[Costa Rica]] as a country has been heralded its champion in the current times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/oct/25/costa-rica-biodiversity|title=Costa Rica recognised for biodiversity protection|last=Watts|first=Jonathan|date=2010-10-25|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Costa Rica hosts an astonishing number of species, given its size, having more animal and plant species than the [[United States|US]] and [[Canada]] combined&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; while being only 250 miles long and 150 miles wide. A widely accepted theory for the origin of this unusual density of species is the free mixing of species from both North and South America occurring on this "inter-oceanic" and "inter-continental" landscape.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Preserving the natural environment of this fragile landscape, therefore, has drawn the attention of many international scholars.

Costa Rica has made conservation a national priority, and has been at the forefront of preserving its natural environment with over a quarter of its land designated as protected in some form, which is under the administrative control of [[National System of Conservation Areas|SINAC]] (National System of Conservation Areas) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.inbio.ac.cr/es/biod/estrategia/estudio.html|title=http://www.inbio.ac.cr/es/biod/estrategia/estudio.html|website=inbio.ac.cr|access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; a division of [[Ministry of Environment, Energy and Telecommunications|MINAE]] (Ministry of Environment, Energy and Telecommunications). SINAC has subdivided the country into various zones depending on the ecological diversity of that region - these zones are depicted in figure 1.

The country has used this ecological diversity to its economic advantage in the form of a thriving [[Ecotourism in Costa Rica|ecotourism industry]], putting its commitment to nature, on display to visitors from across the globe. It is estimated that a record 2.6 million foreigners visited the country in 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ticotimes.net/2016/01/16/costa-rica-welcomes-2-6-million-tourists-2015-hits-new-record|title=Costa Rica tourism sets new record with 2.6 million visitors in 2015|work=The Tico Times Costa Rica|access-date=2018-06-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; almost half the population of Costa Rica itself. This tourism is facilitated by the fact that Costa Rica has a stable democracy and has a [[human development index]] of 0.776, the highest for any country in [[Latin America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/countries/profiles/CRI|title={{!}} Human Development Reports|website=hdr.undp.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also the only country in the world that generates more than 99% of its electricity from renewable sources, relying on hydropower (78%), wind (10%), geothermal energy (10%), biomass and solar (1%). Critics have pointed out however, that in achieving this milestone, the country has built several dams (providing the bulk of its electricity) some of which have negatively impacted indigenous communities as well as the local flora and fauna.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/costa-rica-electricity-renewable-energy-300-days-2017-record-wind-hydro-solar-water-a8069111.html|title=Costa Rica runs entirely on renewable energy for 300 days this year|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-06-07|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Historical development ====
[[File:16th century Spanish expansion in the Caribbean.png|thumb|Figure 2. 16th century Spanish expansion in the Caribbean]]
"The Green Republic: A Conservation History of Costa Rica" by Sterling Evans is a renowned book that traces the development of the conservation movement in Costa Rica from the mid 1700s to present day.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=NckTGXhHZgQC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=The+Green+Republic:+A+Conservation+History+of+Costa+Rica,&amp;ots=83nGtAQb-k&amp;sig=sg06Dd_009atdW-IjCOB_in1xM4#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Green%20Republic:%20A%20Conservation%20History%20of%20Costa%20Rica,&amp;f=false|title=The Green Republic: A Conservation History of Costa Rica|last=Evans|first=Sterling|date=2010-06-28|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=9780292789289|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evans mentions that when the Spaniards first arrived in the Americas, the landscape of Costa Rica did not appear particularly hospitable to them, compared to Guatemala or Mexico which seemed more reminiscent of the Spanish climate. Therefore, up until the 18th century, there was very little agricultural development in the region. It also lacked gold and other minerals that [[Christopher Columbus]] had hoped to find in these areas (hence the name, Rich Coast). As a result, the forest cover of Costa Rica was left more or less intact by the European settlement in the Americas.

By the mid-19th century, it was observed that the Costa Rican soil was particularly conducive to the growth of coffee. The global demand for coffee was growing rapidly, fueled by the demand from the working class in the industrializing west. The agricultural model adopted by coffee growers in Costa Rica was of small family owned farms known as ''cafeteras,'' and they strove to be responsible stewards of the land. This approach was in stark contrast to the coffee [[monoculture]] that would've developed by adopting a purely capitalistic ideology. As a result, even though the coffee production increased substantially from 1850 to 1950, there wasn't large scale deforestation in Costa Rica until the 1950s, contrary to popular belief.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Some of the key points often overlooked in Costa Rica's conservation history between 1850 and 2000 according to Evans, are as follows:

1. President Bernardo Soto's government in 1888 began the process of attracting scholars from all over the world, particularly Switzerland and Germany in an effort to educate the locals about agricultural practices harmonious with the environment such that by 1914, Costa Rica became a leading scientific research center in tropical America

2. The establishment of the [[University of Costa Rica]] (UCR) in the 1940s was a landmark event, since the university acted as a springboard for research into tropical studies in Central America. At the helm of UCR were many influential academics such as [[Rafael Lucas Rodríguez]] and [[Alexander Skutch]] whose forward thinking publications served as a foundation for the future policy decisions. Skutch noted,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

"&lt;small&gt;in the mid-1930s, Costa Rica was still largely unspoiled. Its population of less than a half a million people . . .was concentrated in the narrow Meseta Central. . . . Other advantages . . . to the naturalist were its political stability and the friendliness of its people. . . . Costa Rica has a record of continuous, orderly constitutional government that scarcely any other country in Latin America can match. Thus the naturalist working in some remote spot was not likely to have his studies suddenly interrupted or his thin lines of communication cut by a violent upheaval, as has happened to many in Latin America. .&lt;/small&gt;"

3. By 1950, Costa Rica became heavily reliant on coffee exports to Europe and the US. Around the same time, it was battling the dilemma between increasing agricultural output on one hand and protecting natural resources for future use on the other. In 1958, however, the world coffee prices plummeted, and Costa Rica's main source of income was shown to be very vulnerable to unpredictable forces. The government responded by promoting internal manufacturing and encouraging other industries. One such industry that emerged as a result, was the meat industry.

The Central American valley has been described as "perfect for cattle" by [[Carl Hoffman]]. Until 1970, the cattle raised in Costa Rica were primarily used for domestic consumption. Around 1970, the demand for beef from the US started showing an exponential growth due to the rise of the fast-food industry. This robust demand, coupled with the falling coffee prices gave the cattle industry a boost and forests started getting replaced with pastures. At its worst, Costa Rica was losing 4% of its forested area per year.

An alternative analysis by Julia Flagg within the framework of "[[Process tracing|process-tracing]]" reveals that after gaining independence in 1821 the isolation of Costa Rica from El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, and Nicaragua was critical in shaping its future and served as a divergence point in the evolution of the Central American nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flagg|first=Julia A.|date=2018-01-24|title=Carbon Neutral by 2021: The Past and Present of Costa Rica’s Unusual Political Tradition|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/10/2/296|journal=Sustainability|language=en|volume=10|issue=2|pages=296|doi=10.3390/su10020296}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mahoney &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/cbo9780511750328|title=Colonialism and Postcolonial Development|last=Mahoney|first=James|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511750328|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; “ . . . while all of the other provinces quickly became engulfed in warfare and political chaos, Costa Rica escaped such devastation and made tentative economic strides forward”. She also argues that the lack of a land-owning elite class in Costa Rica was instrumental in the development of good governance and  maintaining a stable democracy in the country. The abolishing of the military in 1948 helped free up valuable resources that the government chose to invest into education and resource protection.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The country entered into a positive reinforcement cycle thereafter, where new laws enacted drew international praise which helped solidify Costa Rica's position as global leader in resource protection .

==== Examples of active efforts ====

===== Environmental Services Program =====
To counter reducing forest area coverage in the 1980's, the Costa Rican government pioneered a [[Payment for ecosystem services#Costa Rica|scheme]] in 1997 known as ''PES'', which rewarded private land owners for keeping forests intact on their lands in lieu of the services provided by these forests to the environment and the economy as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.iied.org/payments-for-ecosystem-services-costa-rica-s-recipe|title=Payments for ecosystem services: Costa Rica’s recipe|date=2013-11-29|work=International Institute for Environment and Development|access-date=2018-06-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The World Bank, which provided the loan initially from 2000 to 2006 to support the payments incentivizing afforestation, viewed the program as a success overall despite some of its shortcomings.

It is estimated that the percentage of Costa Rican land covered by forests has gone up from around 20% in the 1980's to over 50% of the total area in 2013 - a growth of 250%. The program has also reduced the national carbon emissions by 11 million tons over a period of 6 years from 1999 to 2005. Indigenous communities and women in particular, have benefited due to this program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/results/2015/12/16/costa-rica-improves-the-efficiency-of-its-payment-for-environmental-services-program|title=Costa Rica Improves the Efficiency of its Payment for Environmental Services Program|work=World Bank|access-date=2018-06-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buoyed by this success, the World Bank extended its support to the Costa Rican government's initiative by funding a new program titled "Mainstreaming Market-Based Instruments for Environmental Management".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.projects.worldbank.org/P093384/mainstreaming-market-based-instruments-environmental-management-project?lang=en|title=Projects  : Mainstreaming Market-Based Instruments for Environmental Management Project {{!}} The World Bank|website=projects.worldbank.org|access-date=2018-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, many international agencies have pushed the national government to make the process of obtaining the payments easier so as to include more underdeveloped communities and cast a wider net for the program.

===== Green sea turtle conservation =====
[[File:Green sea turtle (1).jpg|thumb|A Green sea turtle]]
The [[green sea turtle]] is a globally endangered species and one of the most important nesting grounds for it is in [[Tortuguero National Park|Tortuguero]], Costa Rica&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2005-01-01|title=Long-term conservation efforts contribute to positive green turtle Chelonia mydas nesting trend at Tortuguero, Costa Rica|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320704001715|journal=Biological Conservation|language=en|volume=121|issue=1|pages=111–116|doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2004.04.014|issn=0006-3207}}&lt;/ref&gt; - the word Totuguero is derived from old Spanish maps meaning "place of turtles". After a steady global decline in its population due to overhunting for its meat and eggs, the Tortuguero National Park was established in 1975 in an effort to protect and save the turtle's breeding zone. A highly cited study&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; by Tröeng and Rankin, investigated in 2004, the effects that this protective measure has had on the nesting trend. Although the population of turtles shows a large inter-annual variation thus making the task of determining the exact number very difficult, on an average, the trend has been positive over a long time scale of almost 35 years. The study illustrated that the enactment of three laws by the Costa Rican government was vital in stabilizing and increasing the population of these green sea turtles.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

1. A ban on turtle and egg collection in 1963

2. A ban on the export of [[calipee]] (a part of the turtle's head that is considered a delicacy) in 1970 and finally,

3. The creation of the Tortuguero National Park in 1975 by the legislative assembly.

The lasting impact created by such forward thinking political decisions exhibits the necessity of meaningful governmental intervention.

===== Carbon neutral goal =====
[[File:EARTH-La Flor Campus Classroom.jpg|thumb|Classroom of [[EARTH University|Earth University]] in Costa Rica - a carbon neutral university]]
Although they contribute only 0.15% to the world's [[Greenhouse gas|greenhouse gas emissions]], the governments of New Zealand and Costa Rica&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/5439|title=Costa Rica and New Zealand on Path to Carbon Neutrality {{!}} Worldwatch Institute|website=worldwatch.org|language=cust-en|access-date=2018-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; have independently expressed their intents to become carbon neutral in the next decade, with Costa Rica aiming to achieve an ambitious target of becoming carbon neutral by 2021.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thecostaricanews.com/costa-rica-promotes-carbon-neutral-program-2021/|title=Costa Rica Promotes the Carbon Neutral Program in 2021 {{!}} The Costa Rica News|last=Villegas|first=Charito|date=2017-11-14|work=The Costa Rica News|access-date=2018-06-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In doing so, it would become the world's first carbon neutral country, with the expectation of influencing policy decisions in other major countries. The proposal hopes to ignite the interest of private companies to engage in practices that reduce their emissions, for example, using more fuel efficient routes in transportation, relying more on digital documents than printed ones, adopting LED lighting in offices and using more efficient air conditioning systems.

==== Criticisms of active efforts ====
The government's approach to attain zero net emissions has yielded positive results overall, but has been described as insufficient and lacking by experts &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; because it neglects vehicular emissions which account for nearly 20% of the country's total emissions. The 2021 target has also been called "arbitrary" and "overambitious", since the efforts to reduce the country's reliance on imported oil &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thecostaricanews.com/costa-rica-carbon-neutral-2021-reality-or-unrealistic/|title=Costa Rica Carbon Neutral 2021: Reality or Unrealistic?|last=STAFF|first=TCRN|date=2014-07-21|work=The Costa Rica News|access-date=2018-06-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; will take much longer to take effect.

In 2006, a study by Sierra and Russman&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2006-08-05|title=On the efficiency of environmental service payments: A forest conservation assessment in the Osa Peninsula, Costa Rica|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800905004982|journal=Ecological Economics|language=en|volume=59|issue=1|pages=131–141|doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2005.10.010|issn=0921-8009}}&lt;/ref&gt; analyzed the additional conservation obtained through PES, over and above the baseline conservation rate. The study concluded that the PES program definitely affected land use decisions because land owners used the payments for other productive activities thus keeping the forest cover intact. However, they also concluded that this was not the most effective use of funds because the majority of these forests would have remained intact even without the payments. The study suggested that it would a better strategy to engage in the protection of more critical habitats instead.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;    
[[File:Represa Hidroeléctrica Reventazón, Costa Rica (1).jpg|thumb|The Reventazón Dam has come under criticism recently for the loss of habitat it has caused for many species]]
The [[jaguar]] is an endangered species and its habitat came under threat due to construction of the Reventazón dam in the Reventazón valley.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thejaguarproject.com/jaguar_conservation_reventazon_dam.html|title=The Jaguar Project :: Impact of the Reventazon Hydroelectric Project|website=thejaguarproject.com|access-date=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ticotimes.net/2015/07/15/costa-rica-balances-jaguar-habitat-dam-construction-matching-grant|title=Costa Rica juggles jaguars and dam construction with matching grant|work=The Tico Times Costa Rica|access-date=2018-06-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Costa Rica's green dam - CNN Video|url=https://www.cnn.com/videos/world/2014/02/10/parker-costa-rica-dam.cnn|accessdate=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Reventazón dam is the largest dam in Central America with an installed capacity of 305.5 MW.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/world/Off_the_Wire/2016-09/17/content_39313337.htm|title=Costa Rica's president inaugurates Central America's largest hydropower plant - China.org.cn|website=china.org.cn|access-date=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two financiers of the project, the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank, financed it on the condition that the construction of the dam by the state-run Costa Rican Electricity Institute (ICE) would "restore and maintain connectivity within the Barbilla-Destierro Corridor" which is critical to the survival of the jaguar.

Protestors of this project claim that the construction has failed to meet the expectations on the following issues:&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

1) The constructors did not completely clear vegetation from the areas that would be flooded due to this project. As a result, the uncleared vegetation in the flooded areas began to stagnate, creating the perfect conditions for the growth of the [[Eichhornia crassipes|Water Hyacinth]] (an invasive species). The Water Hyacinth acted as a source for a large amount of carbon dioxide and methane emitted into the atmosphere.

2) Reforestation around the reservoir lake to assist in the migration of the jaguars has not been completed making their movement more difficult.

3) Due to the removal of a lot of material to facilitate construction, the neighboring Lancaster wetlands (home to more than 250 species of birds and 80 species of mammals, reptiles and amphibians) have been left in a state more susceptible to landslides.

What appears to be common in these criticisms is that the initiatives have moved things in the right direction overall, but the implementation hasn't been as good as promised.

== Areas of concern ==
[[Deforestation]] and [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] are issues affecting all regions of the world.  The consequent destruction of wildlife habitat has prompted the creation of conservation groups in other countries, some founded by local hunters who have witnessed declining wildlife populations first hand.  Also, it was highly important for the conservation movement to solve problems of living conditions in the cities and the overpopulation of such places.

=== Boreal forest and the Arctic ===
The idea of incentive conservation is a modern one but its practice has clearly defended some of the sub Arctic wildernesses and the wildlife in those regions for thousands of years, especially by indigenous peoples such as the Evenk, Yakut, Sami, Inuit and Cree. The fur trade and hunting by these peoples have preserved these regions for thousands of years. Ironically, the pressure now upon them comes from non-renewable resources such as oil, sometimes to make synthetic clothing which is advocated as a humane substitute for fur. (See [[Raccoon dog]] for case study of the conservation of an animal through fur trade.) Similarly, in the case of the beaver, hunting and fur trade were thought to bring about the animal's demise, when in fact they were an integral part of its conservation. For many years children's books stated and still do, that the decline in the beaver population was due to the fur trade. In reality however, the decline in beaver numbers was because of habitat destruction and deforestation, as well as its continued persecution as a pest (it causes flooding). In Cree lands however, where the population valued the animal for meat and fur, it continued to thrive. The Inuit defend their relationship with the seal in response to outside critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icc.gl/UserFiles/File/sealskin/2006-03-07_icc_saelskind_pressemeddelse_eng.pdf|title=Inuit Ask Europeans to Support Its Seal Hunt and Way of Life|date=6 March 2006|accessdate=12 July 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070628204105/http://www.icc.gl/UserFiles/File/sealskin/2006-03-07_icc_saelskind_pressemeddelse_eng.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 28 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Latin America (Bolivia) ===
The [[Izoceño people|Izoceño]]-[[Guaraní people|Guaraní]] of [[Santa Cruz Department (Bolivia)|Santa Cruz Department]], [[Bolivia]] is a tribe of hunters who were influential in establishing the Capitania del Alto y Bajo Isoso (CABI). CABI promotes economic growth and survival of the Izoceno people while discouraging the rapid destruction of habitat within Bolivia's [[Gran Chaco]]. They are responsible for the creation of the 34,000 square kilometre Kaa-Iya del Gran Chaco National Park and Integrated Management Area (KINP).  The KINP protects the most biodiverse portion of the Gran Chaco, an ecoregion shared with Argentina, Paraguay and Brazil. In 1996, the [[Wildlife Conservation Society]] joined forces with CABI to institute wildlife and hunting monitoring programs in 23 Izoceño communities. The partnership combines traditional beliefs and local knowledge with the political and administrative tools needed to effectively manage habitats. The programs rely solely on voluntary participation by local hunters who perform self-monitoring techniques and keep records of their hunts.  The information obtained by the hunters participating in the program has provided CABI with important data required to make educated decisions about the use of the land. Hunters have been willing participants in this program because of pride in their traditional activities, encouragement by their communities and expectations of benefits to the area.

=== Africa (Botswana) ===
In order to discourage illegal South African hunting parties and ensure future local use and sustainability, indigenous hunters in [[Botswana]] began lobbying for and implementing conservation practices in the 1960s. The Fauna Preservation Society of Ngamiland (FPS) was formed in 1962 by the husband and wife team: Robert Kay and June Kay, environmentalists working in conjunction with the Batawana tribes to preserve wildlife habitat.

The FPS promotes habitat conservation and provides local education for preservation of wildlife. Conservation initiatives were met with strong opposition from the Botswana government because of the monies tied to big-game hunting. In 1963, BaTawanga Chiefs and tribal hunter/adventurers in conjunction with the FPS founded [[Moremi Wildlife Reserve|Moremi National Park and Wildlife Refuge]], the first area to be set aside by tribal people rather than governmental forces. Moremi National Park is home to a variety of wildlife, including lions, giraffes, elephants, buffalo, zebra, cheetahs and antelope, and covers an area of 3,000 square kilometers.  Most of the groups involved with establishing this protected land were involved with hunting and were motivated by their personal observations of declining wildlife and habitat.

'''Daniel Babut''' (12 February 1929, [[Lille]] - 13 February 2009) was a French [[Hellenist]], specialising in Greek philosophy, especially the ''Moralia'' of [[Plutarch]]. He was employed by the [[Lumière University Lyon 2]] from 1963 to 1992.

== Work ==
Daniel Babut dedicated his doctoral thesis, completed in 1969, to Plutarch and his reception of [[Stoicism]]. He showed that Plutarch was opposed, consistently and sometimes violently, to Stoic philosophy and made the Stoics his "chief adversaries."&lt;ref&gt;D. Babut, ''Plutarque et le stoïcisme'', {{p.|531}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ». The same year he published the text of Plutarch's ''On Moral Virtue'', one of the texts in which he found particularly marked polemic against the stoics, in the [[Collection Budé]].

Interested in the question of Greek philosophers relationship with the divine, he published a synthesis ''La Religion des philosophes grecs de Thalès aux stoïcismes'' (The Religion of the Greek Philosophers from [[Thales]] to the Stoics) in 1974. His studies were particularly focussed on the place of [[Anaximander]] and [[Xenophanes]] in the evolution of ideas about the divine.

A '''delusion''' is a mistaken [[belief]] that is held with strong conviction even in the presence of superior [[evidence]] to the contrary. As a pathology, it is distinct from a belief based on false or incomplete information, [[confabulation]], [[dogma]], [[illusion]], or some other misleading effects of [[perception]].

They have been found to occur in the context of many pathological states (both general physical and mental) and are of particular diagnostic importance in [[psychosis|psychotic]] disorders including [[schizophrenia]], [[paraphrenia]], [[Mania|manic]] episodes of [[bipolar disorder]], and [[psychotic depression]].

==Definition==
Although non-specific concepts of madness have been around for several thousand years, the psychiatrist and philosopher [[Karl Jaspers]] was the first to define the three main criteria for a belief to be considered delusional in his 1913 book ''General Psychopathology''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book
| publisher = J. Springer
| last = Jaspers
| first = Karl
| title = Allgemeine Psychopathologie. Ein Leitfaden für Studierende, Ärzte und Psychologen.
| location = Berlin
| year = 1913
}}&lt;/ref&gt; These criteria are:
* certainty (held with absolute conviction)
* incorrigibility (not changeable by compelling counterargument or proof to the contrary)
* impossibility or falsity of content (implausible, bizarre, or patently untrue)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jaspers|1997|p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, when a false belief involves a value judgment, it is only considered a delusion if it is so extreme that it cannot be, or never can be proven true. For example: a man claiming that he flew into the [[Sun]] and flew back home. This would be considered a delusion,&lt;ref name="A"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abess.com/glossary.html#D |title=Terms in the Field of Psychiatry and Neurology |date= |accessdate=6 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819071820/http://www.abess.com/glossary.html#D |archivedate=19 August 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; unless he were speaking [[Literal and figurative language|figuratively]], or if the belief had a cultural or religious source.

==Causes==
{{See also|Psychosis#Causes|l1=Psychosis (causes)}}
Explaining the causes of delusions continues to be challenging and several theories have been developed. One is the [[Genetics|genetic]] or biological theory, which states that close relatives of people with delusional disorder are at increased risk of delusional traits. Another theory is the dysfunctional cognitive processing, which states that delusions may arise from distorted ways people have of explaining life to themselves. A third theory is called motivated or defensive delusions. This one states that some of those persons who are predisposed might suffer the onset of delusional disorder in those moments when coping with life and maintaining high [[self-esteem]] becomes a significant challenge. In this case, the person views others as the cause of their personal difficulties in order to preserve a positive self-view.&lt;ref name="H"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minddisorders.com/Br-Del/Delusional-disorder.html |title=Delusional Disorder |date=|accessdate=6 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This condition is more common among people who have poor [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]] or [[Visual perception|sight]]. Also, ongoing stressors have been associated with a higher possibility of developing delusions. Examples of such stressors are [[immigration]], low socioeconomic status, and even possibly the accumulation of smaller daily hassles.&lt;ref&gt;Kingston, C. &amp; Schuurmans-Stekhoven, J. (2016). Life hassles and delusional ideation: Scoping the potential role of cognitive and affective mediators, ''Psychology and Psychotherapy: Theory, Research and Practice'' 89(4), 445-463. {{doi|10.1111/papt.12089}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Specific delusions===
The top two factors mainly concerned in the germination of delusions are: 1. Disorder of brain functioning; and 2. background influences of temperament and personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Sims, Andrew |title=Symptoms in the mind: an introduction to descriptive psychopathology |publisher=W. B. Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year=2002 |pages=127 |isbn=0-7020-2627-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Higher levels of dopamine qualify as a symptom of disorders of brain function. That they are needed to sustain certain delusions was examined by a preliminary study on delusional disorder (a psychotic syndrome) instigated to clarify if schizophrenia had a dopamine psychosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Morimoto K, Miyatake R, Nakamura M, Watanabe T, Hirao T, Suwaki H |title=Delusional disorder: molecular genetic evidence for dopamine psychosis |journal=Neuropsychopharmacology |volume=26 |issue=6 |pages=794–801 |date=June 2002 |pmid=12007750 |doi=10.1016/S0893-133X(01)00421-3 |url=http://www.nature.com/npp/journal/v26/n6/full/1395864a.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were positive results - delusions of jealousy and persecution had different levels of dopamine metabolite [[Homovanillic acid|HVA]] and [[homovanillyl alcohol]] (which may have been genetic). These can be only regarded as tentative results; the study called for future research with a larger population.

It is too simplistic to say that a certain measure of dopamine will bring about a specific delusion. Studies show age&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mazure CM, Bowers MB |title=Pretreatment plasma HVA predicts neuroleptic response in manic psychosis |journal=Journal of Affective Disorders |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=83–6 |date=1 February 1998 |pmid=9495606 |doi=10.1016/S0165-0327(97)00159-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yamada N, Nakajima S, Noguchi T |title=Age at onset of delusional disorder is dependent on the delusional theme |journal=Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica |volume=97 |issue=2 |pages=122–4 |date=February 1998 |pmid=9517905 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0447.1998.tb09973.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; and gender to be influential and it is most likely that HVA levels change during the life course of some syndromes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tamplin A, Goodyer IM, Herbert J |title=Family functioning and parent general health in families of adolescents with major depressive disorder |journal=Journal of Affective Disorders |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=1–13 |date=1 February 1998 |pmid=9495597 |doi=10.1016/S0165-0327(97)00105-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the influence personality, it has been said: "Jaspers considered there is a subtle change in personality due to the illness itself; and this creates the condition for the development of the delusional atmosphere in which the delusional intuition arises."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Sims, Andrew |title=Symptoms in the mind: an introduction to descriptive psychopathology |publisher=W. B. Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year=2002 |pages=128 |isbn=0-7020-2627-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural factors have "a decisive influence in shaping delusions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Draguns JG, Tanaka-Matsumi J |title=Assessment of psychopathology across and within cultures: issues and findings |journal=Behav Res Ther |volume=41 |issue=7 |pages=755–76 |date=July 2003 |pmid=12781244 |doi= 10.1016/S0005-7967(02)00190-0|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0005796702001900}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, delusions of guilt and punishment are frequent in a Western, Christian country like Austria, but not in Pakistan, where it is more likely persecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Stompe T, Friedman A, Ortwein G, etal |title=Comparison of delusions among schizophrenics in Austria and in Pakistan |journal=Psychopathology |volume=32 |issue=5 |pages=225–34 |year=1999 |pmid=10494061 |doi= 10.1159/000029094|url=https://www.karger.com/Article/Pdf/29094}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in a series of case studies, delusions of guilt and punishment were found in Austrian patients with Parkinson's being treated with l-dopa, a dopamine agonist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Birkmayer W, Danielczyk W, Neumayer E, Riederer P |title=The balance of biogenic amines as condition for normal behaviour |journal=J. Neural Transm. |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=163–78 |year=1972 |pmid=4643007 |doi= 10.1007/BF01260902|url=http://www.springerlink.com/index/N11474QQ25R5U236.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pathophysiology==

The two-factor model of delusions posits that dysfunction in both belief formation systems and belief evaluation systems are necessary for delusions.  Dysfunction in evaluations systems localized to the right lateral prefrontal cortex, regardless of delusion content, is supported by neuroimaging studies and is congruent with its role in conflict monitoring in healthy persons.  Abnormal activation and reduced volume is seen in people with delusions, as well as in disorders associated with delusions such as [[frontotemporal dementia]], [[psychosis]] and [[lewy body dementia]].  Furthermore, lesions to this region are associated with "jumping to conclusions", damage to this region is associated with post-stroke delusions, and hypometabolism this region associated with caudate strokes presenting with delusions.{{citation-needed|date=April 2018}}

The aberrant salience model suggests that delusions are a result of people assigning excessive importance to irrelevant stimuli.  In support of this hypothesis, regions normally associated with the [[salience network]] demonstrate reduced grey matter in people with delusions, and the neurotransmitter [[dopamine]], which is widely implicated in salience processing, is also widely implicated in psychotic disorders.{{citation-needed|date=April 2018}}

Specific regions have been associated with specific types of delusions.  The volume of the hippocampus and parahippocampus is related to paranoid delusions in [[Alzheimer's disease]], and has been reported to be abnormal post mortem in one person with delusions.  [[Capgras delusion]]s have been associated with occipito-temporal damage and may be related to failure to elicit normal emotions or memories in response to faces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Naasan|first1=George|editor1-last=Lehner|editor1-first=T|editor2-last=Miller|editor2-first=B|editor3-last=State|editor3-first=M|title=Genomics, Circuits, and Pathways in Clinical Neuropsychiatry|publisher=Elsevier Science|page=366-369|chapter=The Anatomy of Delusions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Delusions are categorized into four different groups:

* '''Bizarre delusion:''' Delusions are deemed bizarre if they are clearly implausible and not understandable to same-culture peers and do not derive from ordinary life experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-5
|publisher=American Psychiatric Association
|year=2013
|oclc= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An example named by the [[DSM-5]] is a belief that someone replaced all of one's internal organs with someone else's without leaving a scar, depending on the organ in question.
* '''Non-bizarre delusion:''' A delusion that, though false, is at least technically possible, e.g., the affected person mistakenly believes that they are under constant police surveillance. Though, a plausible reality.
* '''Mood-congruent delusion:''' Any delusion with content consistent with either a [[Depression (mood)|depressive]] or [[Mania|manic]] state, e.g., a depressed person believes that news anchors on television highly disapprove of them, or a person in a manic state might believe they are a powerful deity.
* '''Mood-neutral delusion:''' A delusion that does not relate to the sufferer's emotional state; for example, a belief that an extra limb is growing out of the back of one's head is neutral to either depression or mania.&lt;ref name="minddisorders.com"&gt;{{cite web |title=Delusions |url=http://www.minddisorders.com/Br-Del/Delusions.html |work=Encyclopedia of Mental Disorders |publisher=Advameg.com  |accessdate=2018-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Themes===
In addition to these categories, delusions often manifest according to a consistent theme. Although delusions can have any theme, certain themes are more common. Some of the more common delusion themes are:
* '''Delusion of control''': False belief that another person, group of people, or external force controls one's general thoughts, feelings, impulses, or behavior.&lt;ref name="minddisorders.com" /&gt;
* '''[[Cotard delusion]]''': False belief that one does not exist or has died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Berrios G.E. |author2=Luque R. | year = 1995 | title = Cotard Syndrome: clinical analysis of 100 cases | url = | journal = Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica | volume = 91 | issue = 3| pages = 185–188 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0447.1995.tb09764.x | pmid = 7625193 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Delusional jealousy]]''': False belief that a spouse or lover is having an affair, with no proof to back up their claim.&lt;ref name="minddisorders.com" /&gt;
* '''Delusion of guilt or sin (or delusion of self-accusation)''': Ungrounded feeling of remorse or guilt of delusional intensity.&lt;ref name="minddisorders.com" /&gt;
* '''Delusion of mind being read''': False belief that other people can know one's thoughts.&lt;ref name="minddisorders.com" /&gt;
* '''[[Thought insertion|Delusion of thought insertion]]''': Belief that another thinks through the mind of the person.&lt;ref name="minddisorders.com" /&gt;
* '''[[Ideas of reference|Delusion of reference]]''': False belief that insignificant remarks, events, or objects in one's environment have personal meaning or significance. "Usually the meaning assigned to these events is negative, but the 'messages' can also have a grandiose quality."&lt;ref name="minddisorders.com" /&gt;
* '''[[Erotomania]]''': False belief that another person is in love with them.&lt;ref name="minddisorders.com" /&gt;
* '''[[Religious delusion|Grandiose religious delusion]]''': Belief that the affected person is a god or chosen to act as a god.&lt;ref name=ReligiousDelusion1&gt;{{cite web|title=Religious delusions are common symptoms of schizophrenia.|url=http://www.sciforums.com/showthread.php?t=51361|accessdate=17 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ReligiousDelusion2&gt;{{cite web|last=M |first=Raja |title=Religious delusion |url=http://www.sanp.ch/pdf/2000/2000-01/2000-01-058.PDF |accessdate=17 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322210939/http://www.sanp.ch/pdf/2000/2000-01/2000-01-058.PDF |archivedate=22 March 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Somatic delusion''': Delusion whose content pertains to bodily functioning, bodily sensations or physical appearance. Usually the false belief is that the body is somehow diseased, abnormal or changed.&lt;ref name="minddisorders.com" /&gt; A specific example of this delusion is [[delusional parasitosis]]: Delusion in which one feels infested with [[insect]]s, [[bacteria]], [[mite]]s, [[spider]]s, [[lice]], [[flea]]s, [[worm]]s, or other organisms.
* '''Delusion of poverty''': Person strongly believes they are financially incapacitated. Although this type of delusion is less common now, it was particularly widespread in the days preceding state support.&lt;ref&gt;Barker, P. 1997. Assessment in Psychiatric and Mental Health Nursing in Search of the Whole Person. UK: Nelson Thornes Ltd. P241.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- removed cn-tag because both two sentences are fully supported by this source.
* '''Gender Delusion''': Person strongly believes not being of the same gender as their biological body. Affected individuals sometimes refer to themselves being of demi-gender(s). --&gt;

Grandiose delusions or delusions of grandeur are principally a subtype of [[delusional disorder]] but could possibly feature as a symptom of [[schizophrenia]] and [[mania|manic]] episodes of [[Current diagnostic criteria for bipolar disorder|bipolar disorder]].&lt;ref name="DSM-IV-TR"&gt;[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] Fourth edition Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) [[American Psychiatric Association]] (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Grandiose delusions are characterized by fantastical beliefs that one is famous, [[omnipotent]] or otherwise very powerful. The delusions are generally fantastic, often with a [[supernatural]], [[science-fiction]]al, or religious bent. In colloquial usage, one who overestimates one's own abilities, talents, stature or situation is sometimes said to have "delusions of grandeur". This is generally due to excessive [[pride]], rather than any actual delusions. Grandiose delusions or delusions of grandeur can also be associated with megalomania.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Persecutory delusions===
{{main article|Persecutory delusion}}
Persecutory delusions are the most common type of delusions and involve the theme of being followed, harassed, cheated, poisoned or drugged, conspired against, spied on, attacked, or otherwise obstructed in the pursuit of goals.
Persecutory delusions are a condition in which the affected person wrongly believes that they are being [[Persecution|persecuted]]. Specifically, they have been defined as containing two central elements:&lt;ref name="FreemanGarety2004"&gt;Freeman, D. &amp; Garety, P.A. (2004) Paranoia: The Psychology of Persecutory Delusions. Hove: PsychoIogy Press. {{ISBN|1-84169-522-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=November 2010}} The individual thinks that:
# harm is occurring, or is going to occur.
# the persecutor(s) has(have) the intention to cause harm.

According to the [[DSM-IV-TR]], persecutory delusions are the most common form of delusions in [[schizophrenia]], where the person believes they are "being tormented, followed, sabotaged, tricked, spied on, or ridiculed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-IV
|publisher=American Psychiatric Association
|location=Washington, DC
|year=2000
|page=299
|isbn=0-89042-025-4
|oclc= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the DSM-IV-TR, persecutory delusions are the main feature of the persecutory type of [[delusional disorder]]. When the focus is to remedy some injustice by legal action, they are sometimes called "[[querulous paranoia]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Airloom.gif|thumb|[[John Haslam (physician)|John Haslam]] illustrated this picture of a machine described by [[James Tilly Matthews]] called an "air loom," which Matthews believed was being used to torture him and others for political purposes.]]
The modern definition and Jaspers' original criteria have been criticised, as counter-examples can be shown for every defining feature.

Studies on [[Involuntary commitment|psychiatric patients]] show that delusions vary in intensity and conviction over time, which suggests that certainty and incorrigibility are not necessary components of a delusional belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Myin-Germeys I, Nicolson NA, Delespaul PA |title=The context of delusional experiences in the daily life of patients with schizophrenia |journal=Psychol Med |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=489–98 |date=April 2001 |pmid=11305857 |doi=10.1017/s0033291701003646}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Delusions do not necessarily have to be false or 'incorrect inferences about external reality'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0010-440X(90)90023-L |author=Spitzer M |title=On defining delusions |journal=Compr Psychiatry |volume=31 |issue=5 |pages=377–97 |year=1990 |pmid=2225797 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0010-440X(90)90023-L}}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Some religious or spiritual beliefs by their nature may not be falsifiable, and hence cannot be described as false or incorrect, no matter whether the person holding these beliefs was diagnosed as delusional or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Young, A.W. |chapter=Wondrous strange: The neuropsychology of abnormal beliefs |editor1=Coltheart M. |editor2=Davis M. |title=Pathologies of belief |publisher=Blackwell |location=Oxford |year=2000 |isbn=0-631-22136-0 |pages=47–74 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In other situations the delusion may turn out to be true belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jones E |title=The phenomenology of abnormal belief |journal=Philosophy, Psychiatry and Psychology |volume=6 |pages=1–16 |year=1999 |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/philosophy_psychiatry_and_psychology/toc/ppp6.1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in [[delusional jealousy]], where a person believes that their partner is being unfaithful (and may even follow them into the bathroom believing them to be seeing their lover even during the briefest of partings), it may actually be true that the partner is having sexual relations with another person. In this case, the delusion does not cease to be a delusion because the content later turns out to be verified as true or the partner actually chose to engage in the behavior of which they were being accused.

In other cases, the belief may be mistakenly assumed to be false by a doctor or psychiatrist assessing it, just because it ''seems'' to be unlikely, bizarre or held with excessive conviction. Psychiatrists rarely have the time or resources to check the validity of a person’s claims leading to some true beliefs to be erroneously classified as delusional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Maher B.A. |chapter=Anomalous experience and delusional thinking: The logic of explanations |editor1=Oltmanns T. |editor2=Maher B. |title=Delusional Beliefs |publisher=Wiley Interscience |location=New York |year=1988 |isbn=0-471-83635-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is known as the [[Martha Mitchell effect]], after the wife of the [[United States Attorney General|attorney general]] who alleged that illegal activity was taking place in the [[White House]]. At the time, her claims were thought to be signs of mental illness, and only after the [[Watergate scandal]] broke was she proved right (and hence sane).

Similar factors have led to criticisms of Jaspers' definition of true delusions as being ultimately 'un-understandable'. Critics (such as [[R. D. Laing]]) have argued that this leads to the diagnosis of delusions being based on the [[Subjectivity|subjective]] understanding of a particular psychiatrist, who may not have access to all the information that might make a belief otherwise interpretable. R. D. Laing's hypothesis has been applied to some forms of projective therapy to "fix" a delusional system so that it cannot be altered by the patient. Psychiatric researchers at [[Yale University]], [[Ohio State University]] and the Community Mental Health Center of Middle Georgia have used novels and motion picture films as the focus. Texts, plots and cinematography are discussed and the delusions approached tangentially.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Giannini AJ |title=Use of fiction in therapy |journal=Psychiatric Times |volume=18 |issue=7 |pages=56 |year=2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This use of fiction to decrease the malleability of a delusion was employed in a joint project by science-fiction author [[Philip Jose Farmer]] and Yale psychiatrist A. James Giannini. They wrote the novel ''[[Red Orc's Rage]]'', which, recursively, deals with delusional adolescents who are treated with a form of projective therapy. In this novel's fictional setting other novels written by Farmer are discussed and the characters are symbolically integrated into the delusions of fictional patients. This particular novel was then applied to real-life clinical settings.&lt;ref&gt;AJ Giannini. Afterword. (in) PJ Farmer. Red Orc's Rage.NY, Tor Books, 1991, pp.279-282.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another difficulty with the diagnosis of delusions is that almost all of these features can be found in "normal" beliefs. Many religious beliefs hold exactly the same features, yet are not universally considered delusional. For instance, if a person was holding a true belief then they will of course persist with it. This can cause the disorder to be misdiagnosed by psychiatrists. These factors have led the psychiatrist [[Anthony David (neuropsychiatrist)|Anthony David]] to note that "there is no acceptable (rather than accepted) definition of a delusion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=David AS |title=On the impossibility of defining delusions |journal=Philosophy, Psychiatry and Psychology |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=17–20 |year=1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, psychiatrists tend to diagnose a belief as delusional if it is either patently bizarre, causing significant distress, or excessively pre-occupying the patient, especially if the person is subsequently unswayed in belief by counter-evidence or reasonable arguments.

It is important to distinguish true delusions from other symptoms such as [[anxiety]], [[fear]], or [[paranoia]]. To diagnose delusions a mental state examination may be used. This test includes [[Human physical appearance|appearance]], [[Mood (psychology)|mood]], affect, [[behavior]], rate and continuity of speech, evidence of hallucinations or abnormal beliefs, thought content, orientation to time, place and person, attention and [[concentration]], insight and judgment, as well as short-term [[memory]].&lt;ref name="E"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrongdiagnosis.com/symptoms/delusions/tests.htm |title=Diagnostic Test List for Delusions |date=|accessdate=6 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson-Laird suggests that delusions may be viewed as the natural consequence of failure to distinguish conceptual relevance. That is, the person takes irrelevant information and puts it in the form of disconnected experiences, then it is taken to be relevant in a manner that suggests false causal connections. Furthermore, the person takes the relevant information, in the form of counterexamples, and ignores it.&lt;ref name="F"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://neuro.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/13/3/403-a |title=A New Definition of Delusional Ideation in Terms of Model Restriction |date= |accessdate=6 August 2010 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Some critical psychiatrists criticize the practice of defining one and the same belief as normal in one culture and pathological in another culture for cultural [[essentialism]]. They argue that since cultural influences are mixed, including not only parents and teachers but also peers, friends, books and the internet, and the same cultural influence can have different effects depending on earlier cultural influences, the assumption that culture can be boiled down to a few traceable, distinguishable and statistically quantifiable factors and that everything that does not fall in those factors must be biological, is not a justified assumption. Other critical psychiatrists argue that just because a person's belief is unshaken by one influence does not prove that it would remain unshaken by another. For example, a person whose beliefs are not changed by verbal correction from a psychiatrist, which is how delusion is usually diagnosed, may still change his or her mind when observing [[empirical evidence]], only that psychiatry rarely if ever present patients with such situations.&lt;ref&gt;D. Double 2006 "Critical Psychiatry: The Limits of Madness"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gavin Davidson, Jim Campbell, Ciarán Shannon 2015 "Models of Mental Health"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gaslighting==
Sometimes a correct belief may be mistaken for a delusion, such as when the belief in question is not demonstrably false but is nevertheless considered beyond the realm of possibility. A specific variant of this is when a person is fed lies in an attempt to convince them that they are delusional, a process called [[gaslighting]], after the 1938 play ''[[Gaslight (play)|Gaslight]]'', the plot of which centered around the process.
Gaslighting is frequently used by people with antisocial personality disorder or narcissistic personality disorder. Sometimes, gaslighting can be unintentional, for example if a person, or a group of people aim to lie or cover up an issue, it can lead to the victim being gaslighted as well.&lt;ref&gt;''The Sociopath Next Door'' by Martha Stout (2006) Harmony. {{ISBN|0767915828}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Psychotherapies that may be helpful in delusional disorder include [[individual psychotherapy]], [[cognitive-behavioral therapy]] (CBT), and [[family therapy]].

The '''''dharmakāya''''' ([[Sanskrit]], "truth body" or "reality body", {{bo|w=chos sku, rdzogs sku}}) is one of the three bodies (''[[trikaya]]'') of a [[buddhahood|buddha]] in [[Mahayana]] Buddhism. The ''dharmakāya'' constitutes the unmanifested, "inconceivable" (''acintya'') aspect of a buddha out of which buddhas arise and to which they return after their dissolution. Buddhas are manifestations of the ''dharmakāya'' called the ''[[nirmāṇakāya]]'', "transformation body". Reginald Ray writes of it as "the body of reality itself, without specific, delimited form, wherein the Buddha is identified with the spiritually charged nature of everything that is."&lt;ref name="Reginald Ray 2001, p. 13"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ray|first=Reginald|authorlink=Reginald Ray|title=Secret of the Vajra World: The Tantric Buddhism of Tibet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kQMLAAAAYAAJ|year=2001|publisher=Shambhala|isbn=978-1-57062-772-9|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dhammakaya Movement|Dhammakaya tradition]] of Thailand and the ''[[Tathāgatagarbha sūtras]]'' of the ancient Indian tradition view the ''dharmakāya'' as the ''[[ātman (Buddhism)|ātman]]'' (true self) of the Buddha present within all beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thrangu Rinpoche|authorlink=Thrangu Rinpoche|title=Pointing Out the Dharmakaya: Teachings on the Ninth Karmapa's Text|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fi5w-wNj0D8C|year=2003|publisher=Shambhala|isbn=978-1-55939-857-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tibetan etymology ==
In Tibetan, the term ''chos sku''&lt;ref&gt;Source: [http://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/chos_sku] (accessed: January 15, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; glosses ''dharmakāya''; it is composed of ''chos'' "religion, [[dharma]]" and ''sku'' "body, form, image, bodily form, figure".&lt;ref&gt;Source: [http://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/sku] (accessed: January 15, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Thondup &amp; Talbott render it as the "ultimate body".&lt;ref name="Thondup, Tulku 1996, p.48"&gt;Thondup, Tulku &amp; Harold Talbott (Editor)(1996, 2002).

The Yungdrung [[Bon]] term for ''dharmakāya'' is ''rdzogs sku'', where ''rdzogs'' means "perfection".

== Origins and development ==

=== Pali Canon ===
{{religious text primary|section|date=November 2017}}
In the [[Pāli Canon]], [[Gautama Buddha]] tells Vasettha that the [[Tathāgata]] (the Buddha) is ''Dhammakaya'', the "Truth-body" or the "Embodiment of Truth", as well as ''Dharmabhuta'', "Truth-become", that is, "One who has become Truth."
{{quote|He whose faith in the Tathagata is settled, rooted, established, solid, unshakeable by any ascetic or Brahmin, any deva or mara or Brahma or anyone in the world, can truly say: 'I am a true son of Blessed Lord (Bhagavan), born of his mouth, born of Dhamma, created by Dhamma, an heir of Dhamma.' Why is that? Because, Vasettha, this designates the Tathagata: 'The Body of Dhamma,' that is, 'The Body of Brahma,' or 'Become Dhamma,' that is, 'Become Brahma.'" &lt;ref name="Maurce Walshe 1995 p.409"&gt;Digha Nikaya III.84, Maurice Walshe, The Long Discourses of the Buddha, (Boston, MA: Wisdom Publications, 1995) 409&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During the Buddha's life great veneration was shown to him. A mythology developed concerning the physical characteristics of Universal Buddhas.

After the Buddha's ''[[Parinirvana]]'' a distinction was made between the Buddha’s physical body or ''rūpakaya'' and his ''dharmakaya'' aspect. As the Buddha told Vakkali, he was a living example of the "Truth" of the ''Dharma''. Without that form to relate to, the Buddha's followers could only relate to the ''dharmakaya'' aspect of him.

In SN 6.2 – Garava sutta. Buddha paid homage to the ''Dhamma'' and tell, that he will respect it.

=== Trikaya doctrine ===
{{Main|Trikaya}}
The ''Trikaya doctrine'' (Sanskrit, literally "three bodies" or "three personalities") is a Buddhist teaching both on the nature of reality, and the appearances of a Buddha.

The ''dharmakaya''-doctrine was possibly first expounded in the ''[[Prajnaparamita#Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā|Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā]]'', composed in the 1st century BCE.

Around 300 CE, the [[Yogacara]] school systematized the prevalent ideas on the nature of the Buddha in the ''Trikaya'' "three-body" doctrine. According to this doctrine, [[Buddhahood]] has three aspects:{{sfn|Snelling|1987|p=126}}
# The ''Nirmāṇakāya'', "Transformation body"
# The ''[[Sambhogakāya]]'', "Enjoyment-body"
# The ''Dharmakāya'', "Dharma-body"

=== Qualities ===
Tulku Thondup states that ''dharmakaya'' must possess three great qualities:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thondup|first1=Tulku|title=Masters of meditation and miracles : the Longchen Nyingthig lineage of Tibetan Buddhism|date=1996|publisher=Shambhala|location=Boston [u.a.]|isbn=978-1-57062-113-0|page=50|edition=1.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Great purity'' ({{bo|w=spang pa chen po}}, "the great abandonment"&lt;ref name=nitartha&gt;{{cite web|title=dictionary|url=http://www.nitartha.org/dictionary_search04.html|publisher=Nitartha|accessdate=25 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150224040319/http://www.nitartha.org/dictionary_search04.html|archivedate=24 February 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;),
# ''Great realization'' ({{bo|w=rtogs pa chen po}}),
# ''Great mind'' ({{bo|w=sems pa chen po}}).

== Interpretation in Buddhist traditions ==
{{See also|Anatta}}

=== Mahāsāṃghika ===
According to Guang Xing, two main aspects of the Buddha can be seen in [[Mahāsāṃghika]] teachings: the true Buddha who is omniscient and omnipotent, and the manifested forms through which he liberates sentient beings through skillful means.&lt;ref&gt;Guang Xing. ''The Concept of the Buddha: Its Evolution from Early Buddhism to the Trikaya Theory.'' 2004. p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; For the Mahāsaṃghikas, the historical Gautama Buddha was one of these transformation bodies (Skt. ''nirmāṇakāya''), while the essential real Buddha is equated with the ''dharmakāya''.&lt;ref&gt;Sree Padma. Barber, Anthony W. ''Buddhism in the Krishna River Valley of Andhra.'' 2008. pp. 59-60&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sarvāstivāda ===
[[Sarvastivada|Sarvāstivādins]] viewed the Buddha's physical body (Skt. ''rūpakāya'') as being impure and improper for taking refuge in, and they instead regarded taking refuge in the Buddha as taking refuge in the dharmakāya of the Buddha.&lt;ref name="Guang Xing 2004. p. 49"&gt;Guang Xing. ''The Concept of the Buddha: Its Evolution from Early Buddhism to the Trikaya Theory.'' 2004. p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; As stated in the ''[[Mahavibhasa|Mahāvibhāṣā]]'':&lt;ref name="Guang Xing 2004. p. 49" /&gt;
{{quote|Some people say that to take refuge in the Buddha is to take refuge in the body of the Tathāgata, which comprises head, neck, stomach, back, hands and feet. It is explained that the body, born of father and mother, is composed of defiled ''dharmas'', and therefore is not a source of refuge. The refuge is the Buddha's fully accomplished qualities (''aśaikṣadharmāḥ'') which comprise ''bodhi'' and the ''dharmakāya.''}}

=== Theravada ===
In the [[Pali Canon]] of [[Theravada]] Buddhism, the ''Dhammakāya'' (''dharmakāya'') is explained as a figurative term, meaning the "body" or the sum of the Buddha's teachings.&lt;ref name="Endo1"&gt;{{cite book | title=Buddha in Theravada Buddhism: A Study of the Concept of Buddha In the Pali Commentaries | url=http://www.khamkoo.com/uploads/9/0/0/4/9004485/toshiichi_endo_buddha_in_theravada_buddhism_a_study_of_the_concept_of_buddha_in_the_pali_commentaries__2002.pdf|publisher=[[Buddhist Cultural Centre]] | author=Toschiichi, Endo | year=2002 | location=Nedimala | pages=108–10 | isbn=978-955-96292-0-7 | edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Reynolds|1977|pp=376–7}}{{sfn|Dutt|1929|p=523}} The Canon does not invest the term ''dhammakāya'' with a metaphysical or unrealistic connotation.&lt;ref name="Endo1" /&gt;{{sfn|Dutt|1929|p=521-523}} Jantrasrisalai disagrees though, arguing that the term originally was more connected with the process of enlightenment than the way it later came to be interpreted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis|url=http://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/bitstream/2123/4130/1/01ch-jantrasrisalai-2008-thesis.pdf|title=Early Buddhist Dhammakaya: Its Philosophical and Soteriological Significance| type=PhD thesis|last=Jantrasrisalai|first=Chanida|publisher=Department of Studies in Religion, [[University of Sydney]]|year=2008|isbn=|location=Sydney|pages=288|quote=In all references to dhammakāya in early Buddhist usage, it is apparent that dhammakāya is linked always with the process of enlightenment in one way or another. Its relation with the Buddhist noble ones of all types is evident in the early Buddhist texts. That is to say, dhammakāya is not exclusive to the Buddha. It appears also that the term’s usage in the sense of teaching is a later schema rather than being the early Buddhist common notions as generally understood.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[atthakatha|atthakathā]]''s (commentaries on the [[Buddhist texts]]), the interpretation of the word depends on the author. Though both [[Buddhaghoṣa]] and [[Dhammapala|Dhammapāla]] describe ''dhammakāya'' as the nine supramundane states (''navalokuttaradhamma''), their interpretations differ in other aspects. Buddhaghoṣa always follows the canonical interpretation, referring to the ''teaching'' of the ''lokuttaradhamma''s, but Dhammapāla interprets ''dhammakāya'' as the ''spiritual attainments'' of the Buddha.{{sfn|Reynolds|1977|pp=376–80}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Collins|first1=Steven|title=Reflections on the Dichotomy Rūpakāya/Dhammakāya|journal=Contemporary Buddhism|date=15 July 2014|volume=15|issue=2|pages=261–2|doi=10.1080/14639947.2014.932481}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dhammapāla's interpretation is still essentially Theravāda though, since the Buddha is still considered a human being, albeit an enlightened one.&lt;ref name="Endo1" /&gt; The Buddha's body is still subject to ''[[Karma in Buddhism|kamma]]'' and limited in the same way as other people's bodies are.{{sfn|Reynolds|1977|pp=376–80}}

In a post-canonical text Sri Lankan text called Saddharmaratnākaraya, a distinction is drawn between four different ''kāya''s: the ''rūpakāya'', ''dharmakāya'', ''nimittakāya'' and ''suñyakāya''. The ''rūpakāya'' refers to the four ''[[Dhyāna in Buddhism|jhāna]]''s here; the ''dharmakāya'' refers to the attainment of the first eight of the nine ''lokuttaradhamma''s; the ''nimittakāya'' refers to the final ''lokuttaradhamma'': ''Nibbāna'' with a physical remainder (''sopadisesanibbāna''); and the ''suñyakāya'' refers to ''Nibbāna'' without physical remainder (''anupādisesanibbāna''). However, even this teaching of four ''kāya''s does not really stray outside of orthodox Theravāda tradition.&lt;ref name="Endo1" /&gt;{{sfn|Reynolds|1977|pp=380–2}}

In a more unorthodox approach, Maryla Falk has made the argument that in the earliest form of Buddhism, a [[yogic]] path existed which involved the acquisition of a ''manomayakāya'' or ''dhammakāya'' and an ''amatakāya'', in which the ''manomayakāya'' or ''dhammakāya'' refers to the attainment of the ''jhānas'', and the ''amatakāya'' to the attainment of insight and the culmination of the path. In this case, the ''kāyas'' refer to a general path and fruit, not only to the person of the Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Falk|first1=Maryla|title=Nāma-rūpa and dharma-rūpa : origin and aspects of an ancient Indian conception|date=2006|publisher=Jain Publishing|location=Fremont, California|isbn=978-0-89581-978-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w9M-z-JVSa0C|accessdate=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Strong|first=J.|author-link=John S.

Furthermore, he points out that there are remarkable resemblances with interpretations that can be found in ''Yogāvacara'' texts, often called [[Tantric Theravada]].{{sfn|Reynolds|1977|pp=380–4}}

The usage of the word ''dhammakāya'' is common in Tantric Theravāda texts. It is also a common term in later texts concerning the consecration of Buddha images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=1062942 | title=Hypostasizing the Buddha: Buddha Image Consecration in Northern Thailand | author=Swearer, Donald K. | journal=History of Religions | year=1995 | volume=34 | issue=3 (Image and Ritual in Buddhism) | page=270 |url=http://works.swarthmore.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1116&amp;context=fac-religion}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Kinnard|first1=Jacob N.|editor1-last=Jones|editor1-first=Lindsay|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of religion|title=Iconography: Buddhist iconography|date=2005|publisher=[[Thomson Gale]]|location=Detroit|isbn=978-0-02-865740-0|page=4331|edition=2nd|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302020621/https://www.politicalavenue.com/PDF/ENCYCLOPEDIAS/The%20Gale%20Encyclopedia%20of%20Religion%202nd%20Ed%20Vol.%207.pdf|volume=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these later texts, which are often descriptions of ''[[kammaṭṭhāna]]'' (meditation methods), different parts of the body of the Buddha are associated with certain spiritual attainments, and the practitioner determines to pursue these attainments himself. The idea that certain characteristics or attainments of the Buddha can be pursued is usually considered a Mahāyāna idea, but unlike Mahāyāna, Yogāvacara texts do not describe the Buddha in [[ontological]] terms, and commonly use only Theravāda terminology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crosby|first=Kate|year=2000|title=Tantric Theravada: A Bibliographic Essay on the Writings of Francois Bizot and others on the Yogavacara-Tradition|journal=Contemporary Buddhism|volume=1|issue=2|url=http://abhidharma.ru/A/Vedalla/Content/0003.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111226044721/http://abhidharma.ru/A/Vedalla/Content/0003.pdf|archivedate=2011-12-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Reynolds|1977|pp=384–7}}

{{See also|Dhammakaya Movement#Dhammakaya meditation and True Self}}
The [[Dhammakaya Movement]] of Thai Theravada Buddhism has doctrinal elements which distinguish it from conventional Theravāda Buddhism. Basing itself on the Pali suttas and meditative experience, the movement teaches that the ''Dhammakaya'' is the eternal Buddha within all beings. The ''dhammakaya'' is ''Nibbāna'', and ''Nibbāna'' is equated with the true Self (as opposed to the non-self).{{sfn|Williams|2009|p=126}} In some respects its teachings resemble the [[Buddha-nature]] doctrines of Mahayana Buddhism. Paul Williams has commented that this view of Buddhism is similar to ideas found in the [[Rangtong-Shentong|shentong]] teachings of the [[Jonang]] school of Tibet made famous by [[Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen]].{{sfn|Williams 2009|p=237}}

The Thai meditation masters who teach of a true self of which they claim to have gained meditative experience are not rejected by [[Buddhism in Thailand|Thai Buddhists]] in general, but tend, on the contrary, to be particularly revered and worshipped in Thailand as arahats or even ''[[bodhisattva]]s'', far more so than more orthodox Theravada monks and scholars.{{sfn|Williams|2009|p=329}}

=== Mahāyāna ===

==== Prajnaparamita ====
According to Paul Williams, there are three ways of seeing the concept of the ''dharmakaya'' in the ''[[prajnaparamita]] '' sutras:
{{quote|First, the dharmakaya is the collection of teachings, particularly the Prajñaparamita itself. Second, it is the collection of pure [[Dharma#Dharmas in Buddhist phenomenology|dharmas]] possessed by the Buddha, specifically pure mental dharmas cognizing emptiness. And third, it comes to refer to [[Śūnyatā|emptiness]] itself, the true nature of things. The dharmakaya in all these senses is contrasted with the Buddha’s physical body, that which lived and died and is preserved in [[stupa]]s.{{sfn|Williams|2009|p=177}}}}

==== Tathāgatagarbha ====
In the tathagatagarbha sutric tradition, the ''dharmakaya'' is taught by the Buddha to constitute the transcendental, blissful, eternal, and pure Self of the Buddha. "These terms are found in sutras such as the ''Lankavatara'', ''Gandavyuha'', ''Angulimaliya'', ''Srimala'', and the ''Mahaparinirvana'', where they are used to describe the Buddha, the Truth Body (''dharmakaya'') and the Buddha-nature."&lt;ref name=Duckworthxiv&gt;''Mipam on Buddha-Nature: The Ground of the Nyingma Tradition'' by Douglas S. Duckworth, State University of New York Press, Albany, 2008, p. xiv&lt;/ref&gt; They are the "transcendent results [of spiritual attainment]".&lt;ref name=Duckworthxiv /&gt;

In the ''[[Lotus Sutra]]'' (sixth fascicle) the Buddha explains that he has always and will always exist to lead beings to their salvation.

==== Tibetan Buddhism ====
[[Padmasambhava]], [[Karma Lingpa]], [[Gyurme Dorje]], [[Graham Coleman]] and [[Thupten Jinpa]] define "Buddha-body of Reality", which is a rendering of the Tibetan ''chos-sku'' and the Sanskrit ''dharmakāya'', as:
{{quote|[T]he ultimate nature or essence of the enlightened mind [''byang-chub sems''], which is uncreated (''skye-med''), free from the limits of conceptual elaboration (''spros-pa'i mtha'-bral''), empty of inherent existence (''rang-bzhin-gyis stong-pa''), naturally radiant, beyond duality and spacious like the sky. The intermediate state of the time of death (''chi-kha'i bar-do'') is considered to be an optimum time for the realisation of the Buddha-body of Reality.&lt;ref name="Padmasambhava 2006 p.452" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For more discussion on this particular 'intermediate state of the time of death' refer "Chikkhai bardo" (Tibetan) in the [[Bardo]] article.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Reginald Ray]], writing of the Vajrayana view of the ''dharmakaya'', defines it as:
{{quote|The body of reality itself, without specific, delimited form, wherein the Buddha is identified with the spiritually charged nature of everything that is.'&lt;ref name="Reginald Ray 2001, p. 13" /&gt;}}

The Dalai Lama defines the dharmakaya as "the realm of the Dharmakaya-- the space of emptiness--where all phenomena, pure and impure, are dissolved. This is the explanation taught by the Sutras and Tantras.". However he also states that its distinct from the Hindu concept of [[Brahman]] because buddhism adheres to the doctrine of emptyness (sunyata).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://hhdl.dharmakara.net/hhdlquotes22.html | title=Dalai Lama Answers Questions on Various Topics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Rime movement =====
According to [[Jamgon Kongtrul]], the founder of the [[Rimé movement]], in his 19th century commentary to the [[Lojong]] slogan, "To see confusion as the four kayas, the [[Śūnyatā|sunyata]] protection is unsurpassable",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kongtrul|first1=Jamgon|title=The great path of awakening : the classic guide to lojong, a Tibetan Buddhist practice for cultivating the heart of compassion|date=2005|publisher=Shambhala|location=Boston, MA|isbn=978-1-59030-214-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; when one meditates on ultimate ''[[bodhicitta]]'' and rests in a state where appearances simply appear but there is no clinging to them, the ''dharmakaya'' aspect is that all appearances are empty in nature, the ''[[sambhogakāya]]'' is that they appear with clarity, the ''nirmanakaya'' is that this emptiness and clarity occur together, and the natural ''kāya'' aspect is that these are inseparable.

===== Gyaltrul Rinpoche's Dharmakaya Organization =====
Recently, ''Dharmakaya'' has also become the name for an organization founded by H. E. the 4th [[Trungram Gyaltrul Rinpoche]], and is affiliated with his global organization the United Trungram Buddhist Fellowship (UTBF).  {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Gyaltrul Rinpoche's Dharmakaya organization was founded for the specific purpose of bringing the teachings and meditation practices from the Trungram Tradition of the [[Karma Kagyu]] lineage to North America. {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

== Iconography ==

=== Emptiness ===
In the early traditions of Buddhism, depictions of Gautama Buddha were neither iconic nor aniconic but depictions of empty space and absence: [[petrosomatoglyph]]s (Images of a part of the body carved in rock), for example.&lt;ref&gt;Huntington, Susan (1990). "Early Buddhist art and the theory of aniconism" in ''Art Journal'', Winter 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sky-blue ===
Thondup and Talbott identify dharmakaya with the naked ("sky-clad"; Sanskrit: ''Digāmbara''), unornamented, sky-blue [[Samantabhadra]]:
{{quote|In Nyingma icons, dharmakāya is symbolized by a naked, sky-coloured (light blue) male and female Buddha in union [Kāmamudrā], called Samantabhadra [and [[Samantabhadrī (tutelary)|Samantabhadrī]]].&lt;ref name="Thondup, Tulku 1996, p.48" /&gt;{{refn|group=lower-alpha|For further discussion of 'Kāmamudrā' (English: "love-seal") refer: [[mudra]], [[mahamudra]] and [[Yab-Yum]].}}}}

Fremantle states:
{{quote|Space is simultaneously the first and the last of the great elements. It is the origin and precondition of the other four, and it is also their culmination... The Sanskrit word for space is the same as for the sky: ''[[akasha]]'', which means "shining and clear." What is it that we call the sky? It marks the boundary of our vision, the limit our sight can reach. If we could see more clearly, the sky would extend infinitely into outer space. The sky is an imaginary boundary set by the limitations of our senses, and also by the limitations of our mind, since we find it almost impossible to imagine a totally limitless [U]niverse. Space is the dimension in which everything exists. It is all-encompassing, all-pervading, and boundless. It is synonymous with emptiness: that emptiness which is simultaneously fullness.&lt;ref&gt;[[Francesca Fremantle|Fremantle, Francesca]] (2001). ''Luminous Emptiness: Understanding the Tibetan Book of the Dead''. Boston: Shambala Publications. {{ISBN|1-57062-450-X}}. p.85&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The colour blue is an iconographic polysemic rendering of the ''[[mahābhūta]]'' element of the "pure light" of space (Sanskrit: ''ākāśa'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Francesca Fremantle|Fremantle, Francesca]] (2001). ''Luminous Emptiness: Understanding the Tibetan Book of the Dead''. Boston: Shambala Publications. {{ISBN|1-57062-450-X}}. p.86&lt;/ref&gt;

The conceptually bridging and building poetic device of analogy, as an exemplar where ''dharmakaya'' is evocatively likened to sky and space, is a persistent and pervasive visual metaphor throughout the early [[Dzogchen]] and Nyingma literature and functions as a linkage and conduit between the 'conceptual' and 'conceivable' and the 'ineffable' and 'inconceivable' (Sanskrit: ''acintya''). It is particularly referred to by the ''[[terma (religion)|terma]]'' ''Gongpa Zangtel'' {{refn|group=lower-alpha|Wylie: ''kun tu bzang po'i dgongs pa zang thal du bstan pa''; English: ''Direct Revelation of Samantabhadra's Mind''}}, a terma cycle revealed by [[Rigdzin Gödem]] (1337–1408) and part of the Nyingma "Northern Treasures" ({{bo|w=byang gter}}).&lt;ref&gt;Kunsang, Eric Pema  (compiler, translator); Tweed, Michael (editor); Schmidt, Marcia Binder (editor); Zanpo, Ngawang (artwork) (2006). ''Wellsprings of the Great Perfection: Lives and Insights of the Early Masters in the Dzogchen Lineage''. Hong Kong: Rangjung Yeshe Publications. {{ISBN|962-7341-57-6}}; {{ISBN|978-962-7341-57-4}}. p. 209&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mirror ===
Sawyer conveys the importance of [[melong|mirror]] iconography to ''dharmakaya'':
{{quote|The looking glass/mirror (T. me-long, Skt. adarsa), which represents the dharmakaya or Truth Body, having the aspects of purity (a mirror is clear of pollution) and wisdom (a mirror reflects all phenomena without distinction).&lt;ref&gt;[http://kaladarshan.arts.ohio-state.edu/exhib/sama/Essays/CS92.061MahaOfr.html Sawyer, Chad (1998, 2004), ''Offerings to Mahakala''] (accessed: Saturday March 14, 2009) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125213943/http://kaladarshan.arts.ohio-state.edu/exhib/sama/Essays/CS92.061MahaOfr.html |date=January 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In [[digital logic]], a '''don't-care term''' for a function is an input-sequence (a series of bits) for which the function output does not matter. An input that is known never to occur is a '''can't-happen term'''. Both these types of conditions are treated the same way in logic design and may be referred to collectively as ''don't-care conditions'' for brevity.&lt;ref&gt;J.A. Strong, ''Basic Digital Electronics'', pp. 28-29, Springer, 2013 {{ISBN|940113118X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The designer of a logic circuit to implement the function need not care about such inputs, but can choose the circuit's output arbitrarily, usually such that the simplest circuit results (minimization).
Examples of don't-care terms are the binary values 1010 through 1111 (10 through 15 in decimal) for a function that takes a [[Binary-coded decimal|binary-coded decimal (BCD)]] value, because a BCD value never takes on such values (so called [[pseudo-tetrade]]s); in the pictures, the circuit computing the lower left bar of a [[7-segment display]] can be minimized to 
{{overline|''a''}} ''b'' + {{overline|''a''}} {{overline|''c''}} by an appropriate choice of circuit outputs for ''dcba''=1010...1111.

Don't-care terms are important to consider in minimizing logic circuit design, using [[Karnaugh map]]s and the [[Quine–McCluskey algorithm]].
Don't care optimization can also be used in the development of highly size-optimized assembly or machine code taking advantage of [[Side effect (computer science)|side effects]].{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

==X value==
"Don't care" may also refer to an unknown value in a [[multi-valued logic]] system, in which case it may also be called an '''X value'''. In the [[Verilog]] [[hardware description language]] such values are denoted by the letter "X".  In the [[VHDL]] hardware description language such values are denoted (in the standard logic package) by the letter "X" (forced unknown) or the letter "W" (weak unknown).&lt;ref name=VHDL&gt;{{cite book|title=Vhdl: A Logic Synthesis Approach|author=David Naylor and Simon Jones|year=1997|publisher=Springer|isbn=0-412-61650-5|pages=14&amp;ndash;15,219,221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An X value does not exist in hardware.  In simulation, an X value can result from two or more sources driving a signal simultaneously, or the stable output of a [[flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop]] not having been reached.  In synthesized hardware, however, the actual value of such a signal will be either 0 or 1, but will not be determinable from the circuit's inputs.&lt;ref name=VHDL /&gt;

== Power-up states ==
Further considerations are needed for logic circuits that involve some feedback.  That is, those circuits that depend on the previous output(s) of the circuit as well as its current external inputs.  Such circuits can be represented by a [[state machine]].  It is sometimes possible that some states which are nominally can't happen conditions can accidentally be generated during power up of the circuit or else by random interference.  In some cases, there is no combination of inputs that can exit the state machine into a normal operational state.  The machine remains stuck in the power-up state or can only be moved between other can't happen states in a [[walled garden (technology)|walled garden]] of states.  Such states, while nominally can't happen, are not don't care and designers take steps either to ensure that they are really made can't happen, or else if they do happen, that they are transitory and lead to a normal operational state.&lt;ref&gt;Ramayya Kumar, Thomas Kropf (eds), ''Theorem Provers in Circuit Design, Vol 2'', p. 136, Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 1995 {{ISBN|3540590471}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10880">'''Empathic concern''' refers to other-oriented emotions elicited by and congruent with the perceived welfare of someone in need.&lt;ref&gt;Batson, C.D. (1991). The altruism question: Toward a social-psychological answer. Hillsdale: Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Batson, C.D. (1987). Prosocial motivation: Is it ever truly altruistic? In L. Berkowitz (Ed.), Advances in Experimental Social Psychology (Vol. 20, pp. 65-122). New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; These other-oriented [[emotions]] include feelings of tenderness, [[sympathy]], [[compassion]], soft-heartedness, and the like. 

Empathic concern is often and wrongly confused with [[empathy]]. To empathize is to respond to another's perceived emotional state by experiencing feeling of a similar sort. Empathic concern or sympathy not only include empathizing, but also entails having a positive regard or a non-fleeting concern for the other person.&lt;ref&gt;Chismar, D. (1988). Empathy and sympathy: the important difference. The Journal of Value Inquiry, 22, 257-266.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
[[Daniel Batson|C. Daniel Batson]] is one pioneer of the term. His mature definition of the term is "other-oriented emotion elicited by and congruent with the perceived welfare of someone in need".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Batson, C.D. (2011). ''Altruism in Humans'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Batson explains this definition in the following way:

{{Quote|First, "congruent" here refers not to the specific content of the emotion but to the valence&amp;mdash;positive when the perceived welfare of the other is positive, negative when the perceived welfare is negative.&amp;nbsp;... Third, as defined, empathic concern is not a single, discrete emotion but includes a whole constellation. It includes feelings of sympathy, compassion, softheartedness, tenderness, sorrow, sadness, upset, distress, concern, and grief. Fourth, empathic concern is other-oriented in the sense that it involves feeling ''for'' the other&amp;mdash;feeling sympathy for, compassion for, sorry for, distressed for, concerned for, and so on.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;}}

Many writers other than Batson use different terms for this construct or very similar constructs. Especially popular&amp;mdash;perhaps more popular than "empathic concern"&amp;mdash;are ''sympathy'', ''compassion'' or ''pity''.&lt;ref&gt;These are used by numerous philosophers and social scientists including [[Charles Darwin]], [[Frans de Waal]], [[Nancy Eisenberg]], and [[Stephen Darwall]], as documented in Batson's ''Altruism in Humans'', p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Other terms include ''the tender emotion'' and ''sympathetic distress''.&lt;ref&gt;These latter two terms are due, respectively, to [[William McDougall (psychologist)|William McDougall]] and [[Martin Hoffman]]. See Batson, C.D. (2011). ''Altruism in Humans'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Human beings are strongly motivated to be connected to others.&lt;ref&gt;Batson, C.D. (1990). How social an animal? The human capacity for caring. American Psychologist 45: 336-346.&lt;/ref&gt; In humans and higher mammals, an impulse to care for offspring is almost certainly genetically hard-wired, although modifiable by circumstance.

==Evolutionary origins==
At the behavioral level it is evident from the descriptions of comparative psychologists and ethologists that behaviors homologous to empathic concern can be observed in other [[mammalian]] species. Notably, a variety of reports on ape empathic reactions suggest that, apart from emotional connectedness, [[apes]] have an explicit appreciation of the other's situation.&lt;ref&gt;De Waal, F.B.M. (1996). Good Natured: The origins of right and wrong in humans and other animals. Harvard: Harvard University Press. Harvard: Harvard University&lt;/ref&gt; A good example is consolation, defined as reassurance behavior by an uninvolved bystander towards one of the combatants in a previous aggressive incident.&lt;ref&gt;De Waal, F.B.M., &amp; van Roosmalen, A. (1979). Reconciliation and consolation among chimpanzees. Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 5, 55-66.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Developmental origins==
Empathic concern is thought to emerge later developmental and to require more self-control than either [[emotional contagion]] or [[personal distress]].&lt;ref&gt;Eisenberg, N., &amp; Strayer, J. (1997). Empathy and its Development. New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Developmental research indicates a broad range of social competencies children bring to their interpersonal relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Decety, J., &amp; Meyer, M. (2008). From emotion resonance to empathic understanding: A social developmental neuroscience account. Development and Psychopathology, 20, 1053-1080.&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 2 years of age, they show (a) the cognitive capacity to interpret, in simple ways, the physical and psychological states of others, (b) the emotional capacity to experience, affectively, the state of others, and (c) the behavioral repertoire that permits the possibility of attempts to alleviate discomfort in others.&lt;ref&gt;Zahn-Waxler, C, Radke-Yarrow, M., Wagner, E., &amp; Chapman, M. (1992). Development of concern for others. Developmental Psychology, 28, 126-136.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Both personal disposition such as [[temperament]] and social context contribute to individual differences in concern for others. Some developmental psychologists have hypothesized that empathic concern for others are essential factors inhibiting [[aggression]] toward others.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenberg, N., &amp; Eggum, N.D. (2009). Empathic responding: sympathy and personal distress. In: J. Decety and W. Ickes, The Social Neuroscience of Empathy. Cambridge: MIT Press, pp 71-83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Hoffman|Hoffman, M.L.]] (2000). Empathy and Moral Development. New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contribution of social psychology==
Empathic concern may produce an [[altruistic]] motivation to reduce the other person's distress.&lt;ref&gt;Batson, C.D., &amp; Shaw, L.L. (1991). Evidence for altruism: Toward a pluralism of prosocial motives. Psychological Inquiry, 2, 107-122).&lt;/ref&gt; The challenge of demonstrating the existence of altruistic motivation is to show how empathic concern leads to helping in ways that cannot be explained by prevailing theories of egoistic motivation. That is, a clear case needs to be made that it is concern about the other person's welfare, not a desire to improve one's own welfare, that primarily drives one's helping behavior in a particular situation. 

Empirical studies conducted by social psychologist [[Daniel Batson]] have demonstrated that empathic concern is felt when one adopts the perspective of another person in need. His work emphasizes the different emotions evoked when imagining another situation from a self-perspective or imagining from another perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Batson, C.D. (2009). Two forms of perspective taking: imagining how another feels and imagining how you would feel. In K.D. Markman, W.M.P. Klein and J.A. Suhr (Eds.), Handbook of Imagination and Mental Simulation (pp. 267-279). New York: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The former is often associated with [[personal distress]] (i.e., feelings of discomfort and anxiety), whereas the latter leads to empathic concern.

==Social neuroscience evidence==

[[Social neuroscience]] explores the biological underpinnings of empathic concern and more generally interpersonal sensitivity, using an integrative approach that bridges the biological and social levels.&lt;ref&gt;Decety, J., &amp; Keenan, J.P. (2006). Social neuroscience: A new journal. Social Neuroscience, 1, 1-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Neural systems, including autonomic functions, that rely on brain stem [[neuropeptides]], such as [[oxytocin]] and [[vasopressin]], are plausible correlates for empathic concern. Alternatively, vasopressin might be implicated in situations where a more active strategy is required for an effective response.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, C.S., Harris, J., &amp; Porges, S.W. (2009). Neural and evolutionary perspectives on empathy In: J. Decety and W. Ickes, The Social Neuroscience of Empathy. Cambridge: MIT press, pp 169-182.&lt;/ref&gt;

An association between [[executive functions]], underpinned by the [[prefrontal cortex]] with reciprocal connections with the [[limbic system]], the [[sense of agency]], and empathic concern has been suggested based on lesion studies in neurological patients and [[functional neuroimaging]] experiments in healthy individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Decety, J., &amp; Jackson, P.L. (2004). The functional architecture of human empathy. Behavioral and Cognitive Neuroscience Reviews, 3, 71-100.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The difference between imaging self versus imaging other is supported by a series of [[functional neuroimaging]] studies of affective processing. For instance, Lamm, Batson and Decety (2007) found that participants reported more empathic concern when imagining the [[pain]] of others when adopting another perspective, and more personal [[suffering|distress]] when imagining themselves to be in pain.&lt;ref&gt;Lamm, C., Batson, C.D., &amp; Decety, J. (2007). The neural substrate of human empathy: effects of perspective-taking and cognitive appraisal. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 19, 42-58.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The fMRI scans revealed that imagining self in pain was associated with strong activation in brain areas involved in affective response to threat and pain, including the amygdala, insula and anterior cingulate cortex. Imagine-other instructions produced higher activity in the right temporoparietal junction (or TPJ), which is associated with self-other distinctiveness and the sense of agency.

'''Floris van den Berg''' (born 4 February 1973) is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[philosopher]], mostly known for his [[atheism]] campaign in the Netherlands.

== Activities ==
Van den Berg was raised in a liberal Catholic home, but became an atheist activist as an adult.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=van den Berg |first=Floris |authorlink=Floris van den Berg |date=2017 |title=Hoe komen we van religie af?: een ongemakkelijke liberale paradox (How Can We Get Rid of Religion?: An Inconvenient Liberal Paradox) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q2I3DgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT96 |location=Antwerp |publisher=Uitgeverij Houtekiet |page=96 |isbn=9789089245618 |accessdate=22 September 2018 |quote="I'm incredibly happy to have been born in a liberal Catholic nest, where I was spared the subjection to dogmas, authority and rites." |language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the initiative of [[Ariane Sherine]] and [[Richard Dawkins]] for the [[Atheist Bus Campaign]] in the [[United Kingdom]], that was taken up in several other European countries, Floris van den Berg announced the intention to launch a similar campaign in the Netherlands on 12 January 2009. [[Kees van der Staaij]] of the ultraconservative Protestant [[Reformed Political Party]] (SGP) [[Question time|asked parliamentary questions]] about the matter to Secretary of State of Transport [[Tineke Huizinga]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://dantumadeel.sgp.nl/Page/sp719/ml1/from_sp_id=658/nctrue/system_id=7348/so_id=923/Index.html |title=SGP: Bus is geen reclamezuil |publisher=SGP |date=27 January 2009 |accessdate=28 May 2014 |language=nl |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819085830/http://dantumadeel.sgp.nl/Page/sp719/ml1/from_sp_id%3D658/nctrue/system_id%3D7348/so_id%3D923/Index.html |archivedate=19 August 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and discussed the topic with Van den Berg on 28 January in ''[[Nova (Dutch TV series)|Nova]]''.&lt;ref name="Nova"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.uitzendinggemist.nl/afleveringen/1156325 |title=SGP tegen atheïstische reclame (10:19) |author=Nova |publisher=Uitzending Gemist |date=28 January 2009 |accessdate=28 May 2014|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the bus campaign was abandoned, because the major bus companies [[Connexxion]], [[Arriva]] and [[Veolia Transport Nederland|Veolia]] do not allow messages of a political or religious nature.&lt;ref name="Nova"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.omroepbrabant.nl/?news/1148671193/Omstreden+tekst+niet+op+Brabantse+bussen.aspx |title=Omstreden tekst niet op Brabantse bussen |publisher=[[Omroep Brabant]] |date=11 March 2009 |accessdate=28 May 2014|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, Floris participated in the [[Evangelische Omroep|EO]] television series ''[[Rot op met je religie]]'' ("To Hell With Your Religion"), in which he lives together with two Christians, a Muslim, a Jew and a fellow atheist for two weeks. They go on a journey throughout the country to discover, discuss and critique religious ideas and rituals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.eo.nl/home/over-de-eo/pers/item/artikel/de-ultieme-religiestress-test-in-rot-op-met-je-religie-op-npo2/ |title=De ultieme religiestress-test in ‘Rot op met je religie’ op NPO2 |publisher=[[Evangelische Omroep]] |date=6 January 2017 |language=nl|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113123536/http://www.eo.nl/home/over-de-eo/pers/item/artikel/de-ultieme-religiestress-test-in-rot-op-met-je-religie-op-npo2/|archivedate=January 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8405">'''Frederick D. Wilhelmsen''' (1923 &amp;ndash; 21 May 1996) was a distinguished [[Roman Catholic]] philosopher, noted, both as a professor and as a writer, for his explication and advancement of the [[Thomism|Thomistic]] tradition. He also was a political commentator, assessing American politics and society from a [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditionalist]] perspective and a political thinker, addressing what he perceived to be the failings of secular-liberal democracy. He principally was a professor at the [[University of Dallas]] from 1965 to his death in 1996. He also taught at the [[University of Santa Clara]], the [[Al-Hikma University (Baghdad)|Al-Hikma University]] in [[Baghdad]], the [[University of Navarra]] in [[Pamplona]], [[Spain]], and lectured and taught classes at many other universities.

He was a prolific writer. Besides the book publications listed below, he contributed articles to the following: ''[[America (Jesuit magazine)|America]]'', ''[[The Angelus (magazine)|The Angelus]]'', ''[[Commonweal Magazine|The Commonweal]]'', ''Faith &amp; Reason'', ''The Grail'', ''[[The Intercollegiate Review]]'', ''[[Modern Age (periodical)|Modern Age]]'', ''[[National Review]]'', ''The Political Science Reviewer'', ''[[Triumph (magazine)|Triumph]]'', ''[[Traditionalist conservatism#The University Bookman|The University Bookman]]'', and ''[[The Wanderer (newspaper)|The Wanderer]],'' among others.

He also was a founding editor of ''[[Triumph (magazine)|Triumph]]'', a Roman Catholic monthly that sought the sacralization of American society.&lt;ref&gt;Mark D. Popowski, The Rise and Fall of Triumph: The History of a Radical Roman Catholic Magazine, 1966-1976 (Lanham, MD: Lexington, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to assessing [[American politics]] and society, he was inspired by and extensively reflected upon [[Spanish politics]] and society. [[Alvaro d'Ors]], a notable Spanish political philosopher, wrote that Wilhelmsen, an American from [[Detroit]], was "the best interpreter of [[Traditionalism (Spain)|Spanish traditionalism]], a body of political thought also known as [[Carlism]], after King [[Infante Carlos of Spain, Count of Molina|Charles V]] (Don Carlos)".&lt;ref&gt;Alvaro d'Ors, "Horismoi &amp; Aphorismoi", in ''Saints, Sovereigns, and Scholars: Studies in Honor of Frederick D. Wilhelmsen'', eds., Robert A. Hererra, Fr. James L. Lehrberger, O.Cist., and Melvin Bradford, New York: Peter Lang, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilhelmsen enjoyed a lively friendship and correspondence with [[Marshall McLuhan]], who spent time at the [[University of Dallas]] in the 1970s.

[[File:تندیس علامه جلال الدین دوانی کازرونی در موزه تاریخ پارس.jpg|thumb|تندیس علامه جلال الدین دوانی در موزه تاریخ پارس]]'''Jalaluddin Muhammad bin As'ad dawani''' (1426–1502 in [[Dawan, Iran]]), often referred to as '''Jalaluddin Dawani''', '''Jalal Al-Din Muhammad ibn Asad Al-Dawani''', or '''Allamah Mohaghegh''', was a leading philosopher, theologian, jurist and poet of 15th Century [[Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/davani|title=DAWĀNĪ, JALĀL-AL-DĪN MOHAMMAD|work=iranicaonline.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent most of his life in Dawan and he had strong connections with the local [[Qara Qoyunlu]], [[Aq Qoyunlu]], [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rulers, accepting a number of important government positions from them. He wrote a number of works on [[theology]], [[philosophy]] and law. He died shortly after the founding of the [[Safavid]] dynasty, but before [[Shah Isma'il I]] captured the province of [[Fars Province|Fars]].

==Life==
Davani began his studies with his father, who was a student of [[Mir Gorgani]] (d.1413), but moved to [[Shiraz]] while he was still young to study [[theology]], [[philosophy]], [[logic]], [[fiqh]] and [[usul ul-fiqh]] under notable scholars such as Homām-al-Dīn Golbārī, [[Safiuddin Iji]], [[Muhiyudin Muhammad Kushkenari Ansari]] (Himself a student of [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani]], who was also a student of Gorgani). Davani was often in disagreement with his contemporary and fellow philosopher-theologian, [[Sadruddin Dashtaki]], who frequently criticized the former's views and writings.

Davani was associated with the royal courts of his time. During his youth, Yusuf, the son of the [[Qara Qoyunlu]] [[Sultan]] Jahanshah, appointed him to the post of Sadr (religious supervisor). However, he quickly resigned and began teaching at Madrasah-e Begum. He wrote his ''Akhlaq-e Jalali'' (lit. 'majestic manners'), an ethical manual modeled on [[Nasiruddin Tusi]]'s ''Akhlaq e-Nasiri'', for the [[Aq Qoyunlu]] Ozun Hasan. His Arz Nameh was written for the latter's son, Khalil. Davani later accepted the position of chief judge for the province of [[Fars Province|Fars]] from Sultan Ya'qub. He wrote a discussion on Ali bin Muhammad Qoushchi's commentary on the famous [[Tajrid ul-Kalam]] by [[Nasiruddin Tusi]] for both the sons of Ozun Hasan. He did oppose Sultan Ya'qub's [[centralization]] policies towards the end of the latter's life, but remained on good terms with Sultan Rostam. As well as his strong connection to Shiraz's [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]] rulers, he was also associated with the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] court of Abu Sa'id, dedicated a number of books on [[Ishraqi]] philosophy to Sultan Mahmud I of [[Gujarat]] and another text to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Sultan, [[Beyazid II]].

==Religious affiliation==
Dawani's school of thought is a matter of dispute.  Later authors portray Dawani as a [[Twelver Shi'a]] practicing [[Taqiyyah]] during a time of political turmoil, citing a vision he had of the Twelver [[Imam Reza]] while visiting [[Najaf]] and a book of poetry praising the [[Twelve Imams]] and condemning [[Abu Bakr]], [[Umar]], and [[Uthman]] as evidence of this. This was likely written when the [[Safavid]] [[Shah Isma'il I]] was advancing on Fars, following his capture of [[Tabriz]] and declaration of [[Twelver Shi'ism]] as the [[state religion]] of his dynasty. However, he rejected the Shah's messianic claims and died before the latter [[Safavid conversion of Iran from Sunnism to Shiism#The fate of Sunni and Shia Ulema (scholars)|put to death]] the [[Sunni]] scholars of the city for refusing to convert to the official creed. Furthermore, in his earlier works he clearly refers to the temporal Sunni rulers as the "leader of the age" (while stating that the Twelver Shi'a believe this is [[Muhammad bin Hasan]] who is in [[ghaybah|occultation]]) and wrote openly anti-Twelver commentaries from an [[Ash'arite]] perspective.

[[Image:Caprioli - In libros sententiarum amplissimae quaestiones, 1589 - 4446120.tif|thumb|''In libros sententiarum amplissimae quaestiones'', 1589]]
'''Jean Capréolus''' (also '''Joannes''' or '''John Capreolus''') (born c. 1380 in the [[diocese of Rodez]], France; died in that city 6 April 1444) was a [[French people|French]] [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] theologian and [[Thomist]].

He is sometimes known as the ''Prince of the Thomists''. His ''Four Books of Defenses of the Theology of St. Thomas Aquinas'' can be said to have sparked a revival in Thomism.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03314a.htm|title=John Capreolus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Only scant details of his personal history are known. He was a Dominican affiliated with the province of [[Toulouse]], and a general chapter of his order at [[Poitiers]] in 1407 assigned him to lecture on ''[[Sentences|The Sentences]]'' at the [[University of Paris]]. He began in 1408 and achieved success.

The following year he finished the first part of his celebrated defensive on commentary on the theology of [[St. Thomas Aquinas]]. He passed examinations for degrees at the [[Sorbonne]] in 1411 and in 1415. After serving for some time as regent of studies at Toulouse, he repaired to Rodez where he laboured  at his commentaries completing the three remaining parts in 1426, 1428 and 1433.

==Works==
In the preface of a compendium of Capreolus's work by [[Isidore de Isolanis]], it is stated that these manuscripts once narrowly escaped destruction by fire, a lay brother having saved them, to the joy of the author, who was then advanced in years. The same authority describes the erudite commentator as having a devotion to the [[Blessed Virgin]].

Though following the order of ''The Sentences'', the commentaries of Capreolus are a calm, learned, and penetrating exposition of the teaching of St. Thomas, as well as a comprehensive defence against sundry opponents and critics, including [[John Duns Scotus|Scotus]], [[Henry of Ghent]], [[John of Ripa]], [[Guido the Carmelite]], [[Aureolus]], [[Guillaume Durand|Durandus]], [[Gregory of Rimini]], [[William of Ockham]], and other [[Nominalist]]s. Copious and apt citations show that the author mastered [[Aristotle]] and his Arabic commentator, [[Averroes]]; but a scrupulous fidelity to the Angelical Doctor, that earned for him the extraordinary appellation of "Soul of St. Thomas", is his chief characteristic.

There is nothing in the wide field of the doctrinal discussions of his time that Capreolus did not study and elucidate, in a style terse and vigorous. His work is one of the enduring achievements of [[Scholasticism]].

The commentaries, bearing slightly variant titles, were published in four folio volumes at Venice, 1483, 1514, 1519, 1589. ln 1881, [[Bishop Borret]] of Rodez, who had made the life and works of Capreolus, the object of considerable research, suggested a critically revised edition of the commentaries, which was at length undertaken by the Dominicans. Its publication was begun at Tours in 1900 under the title: ''Johannis Capreoli Tholosani, Ordinis Praedicatorum, Thomistarum principis, Defensiones Theologiae Divi Thomae Aq.de novo editae cura et studio RR. PP. Ceslai Paban et Thomae Pegues''. Early compendiums of the work by [[Paul Soncinas]] and by [[Sylvester Prierias]] were much used in their day.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12266">'''Jes Bertelsen''' (born March 27, 1946), [[Dr. phil.]] in [[History of ideas]], is a Danish spiritual teacher and author. Since 1982 he has been the leader of Vækstcenteret (i.e. "The Growth Center"), which he and his wife at the time, Hanne Kizach, founded in [[Norre-Snede Municipality]], [[Denmark]]. His teachings are based on an experiential investigation of the nature of consciousness, using comparative analysis of Eastern and Western spiritual teachings and consciousness practices on a foundation of modern psychological, philosophical and scientific approaches. He teaches in Danish. A number of his books have been translated into German.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. the bibliography of the [[:de:Jes Bertelsen|German Wikipedia article on Jes Bertelsen]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic background==
Jes Bertelsen studied  History of Ideas ("Idehistorie") at [[Aarhus University]], Denmark with founder of this interdisciplinary study, Danish philosopher Professor [[Johannes Sløk]]. Jes Bertelsen was employed and lectured at Aarhus University from 1970 to 1982.
Jes Bertelsen has written 20 books beginning with the 1972 gold medal award winning MA thesis “Kategori og afgørelse, strukturer i Kirkegaards tænkning”.&lt;ref&gt;Title translated: Category and decision, structures in the thinking of Kirkegaard&lt;/ref&gt; His most recent book is from 2008, "Bevidsthedens flydende lys - Betragtninger over begrebet apperception hos Immanuel Kant og Longchenpa".&lt;ref&gt;Title translated: The flowing light of consciousness – Reflections on the concept of apperception in Kant and Longchenpa&lt;/ref&gt; His doctoral dissertation was entitled: ”Ouroboros – en undersøgelse af selvets strukturer”, 1974.&lt;ref&gt;Title translated: Ouroboros – a study of the structures of the self&lt;/ref&gt;
In the later part of his authorship he more or less departs from the academic tradition and focuses on psychology, self-development and philosophy of consciousness seen in relationship to meditative instructions. From around 2006 he has also been involved in scientific inquiry into the neurological results of meditative practice. In 2009 he was co-author of an article published in the scientific journal ''[[NeuroReport]]'': "Long-term meditation is associated with increased gray matter density in the brain stem".&lt;ref&gt;See the bibliography for details&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jes Bertelsen as spiritual teacher==
From 1978 to the early 1980s Jes Bertelsen was in an ongoing training with the Irish healer [[Bob Moore]], whose understanding of the human energy system had roots in the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophical tradition]]. In Jes Bertelsen’s early work this influence is seen in his focus on the connections between ordinary consciousness, the [[chakra]] system, non-physical energy systems, symbols from dream states, states of expanded consciousness and [[clairvoyance]]. Among Jes Bertelsen’s sources of inspiration are also the descriptions of the [[Christ]] in the [[Gospel of Thomas]], and the [[prayer of the heart|Heart prayer]] of Eastern Orthodox Christianity. The Eastern [[tantra|Tantric]] traditions have been a source of inspiration in his work on the relationship between vital energy, sexuality, love and spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. the books ’’Kvantespring – en bog om kærlighed’’,  (Quantum leap – a book about love) and ’’Indre tantra’’ (Inner tantra)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989 Jes Bertelsen met the Tibetan Lama [[Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche]], who authorized Jes Bertelsen to teach [[Dzogchen|Dzogchen, the pointing out instruction, Tregchöd and thödgal]]; and to do so using his own judgment as to the most appropriate way to assimilate these teachings into Western culture.&lt;ref&gt;Jes Bertelsen: ''Bevidsthedens flydende lys'' (2008), p 65 note 22&lt;/ref&gt; This influence is clearly seen in subsequent books as well as in Jes Bertelsen’s teachings, which over time increasingly has focused on meditative training.

Jes Bertelsen maintains that it is possible to train the mind, and he sees meditative practice as a gradual progression towards both quieting the mind and allowing greater empathic openness and heartfelt presence.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''Nuets himmel'' (Heaven present)&lt;/ref&gt; Like many other voices in the international dialogue about consciousness, spirituality and religion&lt;ref&gt;Among others [[Jon Kabat-Zinn]], [[Ken Wilber]], [[Eckhart Tolle]], [[Andrew Cohen (spiritual teacher)|Andrew Cohen]], [[David Steindl-Rast]] and [[Thomas Keating]]&lt;/ref&gt; he thinks it is possible to free the universal elements of spiritual practice from traditional religious contexts and make them available for general use. For this purpose he has created simple and generally applicable teaching tools that teachers can use with school children.&lt;ref&gt;Described in article from 2009, cf. bibliography&lt;/ref&gt;

In several of his books, Jes Bertelsen describes the unique possibilities and challenges inherent in the secularized Scandinavian societies for developing an experientially based spirituality. He emphasizes a distinction between an inherent spirituality shared by everyone, and the individual option of actively training and developing what he refers to as [[spiritual intelligence]]. In his view such an effort is to be based on "democratic understanding, openness toward the Christian cultural values, equality between men and women and a scientific approach".&lt;ref&gt;Quote from [http://www.vaekstcenteret.dk vaekstcenteret.dk] as of Feb. 20, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Categorizing Jes Bertelsen in comparative religion==
The Danish religious sociologist Helle Hinge has characterized Jes Bertelsen as an example of the [[New Age]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;Helle Hinge: ''New Age på dansk - Jes Bertelsen-bevægelsen'', København, Gyldendal, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; In the Danish encyclopedia, [[Den Store Danske Encyklopædi]], religious historian [[Mikael Rothstein]] describes Jes Bertelsen as being "the center of an actual religious formation", and erroneously describes Jes Bertelsen as a "depth psychologist". However, Jes Bertelsen emphatically refutes both the New Age and religious labels.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Carsten Andersen: ''Det har ikke en pind med religion at gøre'' (Title translated: ''It doesn’t have anything at all to do with religion''), Politiken 30. april 2008&lt;/ref&gt; About the New Age worldview he has said that it contains numerous sensible elements, but that it can also be superficial and characterized by promises of quick solutions.&lt;ref&gt;Jette Meier Carlsen: ''En spirituel opdagelsesrejse'', (Title translated ''A Spiritual Explorer''), Jyllands-Posten 11. aug. 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of Jes Bertelsen==
The late leader of the Christian apologetic Danish organization [[Dialog Center|Dialogcenteret]], dr. theol. [[Johannes Aagaard]], has criticized Jes Bertelsen for mixing Christian and Eastern traditions, and has classified him as "one of the most influential writers and ideologists among the new religious groupings in Denmark" and later as "gnostic".&lt;ref&gt;Den Nye Dialog nr. 25: [http://www.dci.dk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=92&amp;Itemid=34 ''Kærlighed uden kærlighed''] (title translated: ''Love without love'') and Den Nye Dialog nr. 53: [http://www.dci.dk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=728&amp;Itemid=34 ''Jes Bertelsen og hans center i Nr. Snede''] (title translated: ''Jes Bertelsen and his center in Nr. Snede'')&lt;/ref&gt; A similarly Christian faith-based criticism has been put forth since 2006 by Annette Leleur and Frank Robert Pedersen, both connected to Vækstcenteret until the early 1990s. Since 2007 they have publicized their criticisms in Danish under the name Infogruppen.&lt;ref&gt;Folkeskolen.dk 25. jan. 2008: [http://www.folkeskolen.dk/ObjectShow.aspx?ObjectId=50817 ''Advarsel mod "nyreligiøs sekt"''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719124248/http://www.folkeskolen.dk/ObjectShow.aspx?ObjectId=50817 |date=2011-07-19 }} (title translated: ''Warning against "new religious cult"'')&lt;/ref&gt; In their view Jes Bertelsen represents a form of elitist thinking which they find irreconcilable with the foundational principles of democracy. They find it particularly reprehensible that Jes Bertelsen in later years has focused on developing teaching tools for awareness training and spirituality in the public school system, since they find that a person with Jes Bertelsen’s background is unable to do so impartially.

==Summary of points of view on Jes Bertelsen==
As is the case with other charismatic individuals, opinions about Jes Bertelsen span from uncritical enthusiasm to deeply critical attitudes. From a position between these extremes he is regarded as a Danish pioneer in rediscovering a spiritual view of life in modern times.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3883">'''Lexical entrainment''' is the phenomenon in conversational [[linguistics]] of the process of the subject adopting the reference terms of their interlocutor. In practice, it acts as a mechanism of the [[cooperative principle]] in which both parties to the conversation employ lexical entrainment as a progressive system to develop "conceptual pacts"&lt;ref name=sbrennan96&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brennan|first=Susan|title=Lexical entrainment in spontaneous dialog|journal=Proceedings, 1996 International Symposium on Spoken Dialogue|year=1996|issue=ISSD-96|pages=41–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; (a working temporary conversational terminology) to ensure maximum clarity of reference in the communication between the parties; this process is necessary to overcome the ambiguity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deutsch|first=Werner|author2=Pechmann, Thomas |title=Social interaction and the development of definite descriptions|journal=Cognition|year=1982|volume=11|pages=159–184|doi=10.1016/0010-0277(82)90024-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  inherent in the multitude of synonyms that exist in language. 

Lexical entrainment arises by two cooperative mechanisms:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Garrod|first=Simon|author2=Anderson, Anthony |title=Saying what you mean in dialogue: A study in conceptual and semantic co-ordination|journal=Cognition|year=1987|volume=27|pages=181–218|doi=10.1016/0010-0277(87)90018-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Embedded corrections – a reference to the object implied by the context of the sentence, but with no explicit reference to the change in terminology
* Exposed corrections – an explicit reference to the change in terminology, possibly including a request to assign the referent a common term (e.g., "by 'girl', do you mean 'Jane'?")

==Violation of Grice's maxim of quantity==
Once lexical entrainment has come to determine the phrasing for a referent, both parties will use that terminology for the referent for the duration, even if it proceeds to violate the [[Gricean maxim]] of quantity. For example, if one wants to refer to a brown loafer out of a set of shoes that consist of: the loafer, a sneaker, and a high-heeled shoe, they will not use ''the shoe'' to describe the object as this phrasing does not unambiguously describe one item in the set under consideration. They will also not call the object ''the brown loafer'' which would violate Grice's maxim of quantity. The speaker will settle on using the term ''the loafer'' as it is just informative enough without giving too much information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brennan|first=Susan|author2=Clark, Herbert H. |title=Conceptual Pacts and Lexical Choice in Conversation|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|year=1996|volume=22|issue=6|pages=1482–1493|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.22.6.1482}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another important factor is lexical availability; the ease of conceptualizing a referent in a certain way and then retrieving and producing a label for it. For many objects the most available labels are basic nouns; for example, the word "dog". Instead of saying ''animal'' or ''husky'' for the referent, most subjects will default to ''dog''.
If in a set of objects one is to refer to either a husky, a table, and a poster, people are still most likely to use the word "dog." This is technically a violation of Grice's maxim of quantity, as using the term ''animal'' is ideal.

==Applications==
Lexical entrainment has applications in [[natural language processing]] in computers as well as human–human interaction. Currently, the adaptability of computers to modify their referencing to the terms of their human interlocutor is limited, so the entrainment adaptation falls to the human operator; this phenomenon is readily demonstrated in Brennan's 1996 experiment.&lt;ref name=sbrennan96 /&gt;

The '''logic of argumentation''' (LA) is a formalised description of the ways in which humans [[reason]] and argue about propositions.  It is used, for example, in computer [[artificial intelligence]] systems in the fields of medical diagnosis and prognosis, and research chemistry.

Krause et al.&lt;ref&gt;Paul J. Krause, Simon Ambler, Morten Elvang-Gøransson, and John Fox, A Logic of Argumentation for Reasoning Under Uncertainty, Computational Intelligence, 1995, 11(1), 113-131.&lt;/ref&gt; appear to have been the first authors to use the term "logic of argumentation" in a paper about their model for using argumentation for qualitative reasoning under uncertainty, although the approach had been used earlier in prototype computer applications to support medical diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;Morten Elvang-Gøransson, Paul J. Krause, and John Fox, Dialectic Reasoning with Inconsistent Information. in Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence: Proceedings of the Ninth Conference, eds. D. Heckerman and A. Mamdani, Morgan Kaufmann, San Francisco,  1993,  pp. 114-121.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Fox, David W. Glasspool, and Jonathan Bury, Quantitative and Qualitative Approaches to Reasoning under Uncertainty in Medical Decision Making, in 8th Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Medicine in Europe, AIME 2001 Cascais, Portugal, July 2001, Proceedings, eds. S. Quaglini, P. Barahone, and S. Andreassen, Springer, Berlin, 2001, pp 272-282.&lt;/ref&gt;  Their ideas have been developed further,&lt;ref&gt;Philip N. Judson and Jonathan D. Vessey, A Comprehensive Approach to Argumentation,  J. Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci., 2003,  43, 1356-1363.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leila Amgoud and Henri Prade, Towards a Logic of Argumentation, Lecture Notes in Comput. Sci., 2012, 7520, 558-565.&lt;/ref&gt; and used in applications for predicting chemical [[toxicity]] and [[xenobiotic metabolism]], for example.&lt;ref&gt;Philip N. Judson; Carol A. Marchant; Jonathan D. Vessey.  Using Argumentation for Absolute Reasoning about the Potential Toxicity of Chemicals.  Journal of Chemical Information and Computer Science, 2003,  43, 1364-1370.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William G. Button, Philip N. Judson, Anthony Long, and Jonathan D. Vessey. Using Absolute and Relative Reasoning in the Prediction of the Potential Metabolism of Xenobiotics, J. Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci., 2003,  43, 1371-1377.&lt;/ref&gt;
In LA arguments for and arguments against a proposition are distinct; an argument for a proposition contributes nothing to the case against it, and vice versa.  Among other things, this means that LA can support contradiction – proof that an argument is true and that it is false.  Arguments supporting the case for and arguments supporting the case against are aggregated separately, leading to a single assessment of confidence in the case for and a single assessment of confidence in the case against.  Then the two are resolved to provide a single measure of confidence in the proposition.

In most implementations of LA the default aggregated value is equal to the strongest value in the set of arguments for or against the proposition.  Having more than one argument in agreement does not automatically increase confidence because it cannot be assumed that the arguments are independent when reasoning under uncertainty.  If there is evidence that arguments are independent and there is a case for increased confidence when they agree, this is sometimes expressed in additional rules of the form "If A and B then ...".

The process of aggregation and resolution can be represented as follows:

T = Resolve[Max{For(Ca,x, Cb,y, ...)}, Max{Against(Ca,x, Cb,y, ...)}]

where T is the overall assessment of confidence in a proposition;  Resolve[] is a function which returns the single confidence value which is the resolution of any pair of values; For and Against are the sets of arguments supporting and opposing the proposition, respectively; Ca,x, Cb,y, …, are the confidence values for those arguments; Max{...} is a function which returns the strongest member of the set upon which it operates (For or Against).

Arguments may assign confidence to propositions that themselves influence confidence in other arguments, and one rule may be undercut by another.  A computer implementation can recognize these inter-relationships to construct reasoning trees automatically.

[[File:Molina - De Justitia et jure, 1759 - 272.tif|thumb|Portrait of Luis de Molina]]
{{Catholic philosophy}}
'''Luis de Molina''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ə|ˈ|l|iː|n|ə}}; 29 September 1535, [[Cuenca, Spain|Cuenca]], [[Spain]] &amp;ndash; 12 October 1600, [[Madrid]], Spain) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Jesuit]] [[Catholic priest|priest]] and [[Scholasticism|scholastic]], a staunch defender of free will in the controversy over human liberty and God's grace. His theology is known as [[Molinism]].

==Life==
[[Image:Molina - De iustitia et iure, 1733 - 4495353.tif|thumb|''De iustitia et iure'', 1733]]
From 1551 to 1562, Molina studied law in Salamanca, philosophy in Alcala de Henares, and theology in Coimbra.  After 1563, he became a professor at the [[University of Coimbra]], and afterward taught at the [[University of Évora]], [[Portugal]].  From this post he was called, at the end of twenty years, to the chair of moral [[theology]] in [[Madrid]], where he died.&lt;ref&gt;Luis de Molina, ''[http://www.clpress.com/publications/treatise-money A Treatise on Money]''. CLP Academic, 2015, p.xxiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides other works he wrote ''De liberi arbitrii cum gratiae donis, divina praescientia, praedestinatione et reprobatione concordia'' (4 vo., [[Lisbon]], 1588); a commentary on the first part of the ''[[Summa Theologica|Summa Theologiae]]'' of [[Thomas Aquinas]] (2 vols., fol., Cuenca, 1593); and a treatise ''De jure et justitia'' (6 vols., 1593&amp;ndash;1609).

It is to the first of these that his fame is principally due. It was an attempt to reconcile, in words at least, the [[Augustinian]] doctrines of [[predestination]] and [[efficacious grace]] with the new ideals of the [[Renaissance]] concerning [[free will]]. Assuming that man is free to perform or not to perform any act whatever, Molina maintains that this circumstance renders the grace of God neither unnecessary nor impossible: not impossible, for God never fails to bestow grace upon those who ask it with sincerity; and not unnecessary, for grace, although not an [[efficacious grace|efficient]], is still a sufficient cause of salvation (''[[gratia mere sufficiens]]''). Nor, in Molina's view, does his doctrine of [[free will]] exclude predestination. The omniscient God, by means of His ''scientia media'' (the phrase is Molina's invention, though the idea is also to be found in his older contemporary [[Pedro da Fonseca (philosopher)|Fonseca]]), or power of knowing [[future contingent]] events, foresees how we shall employ our own free-will and treat his proffered grace, and upon this foreknowledge he can found his predestinating decrees.

These doctrines, which opposed both traditional understanding of [[Augustinism]] and [[Thomism]] concerning the respective roles of free-will and efficacious grace, and the teachings of [[Martin Luther]] and [[John Calvin]], excited violent controversy in some quarters, especially on the part of the [[Dominican order]] and of the [[Jansenist]]s, and at last rendered it necessary for the pope ([[Pope Clement VIII|Clement VIII]]) to intervene. At first (1594) he simply enjoined silence on both parties so far as Spain was concerned; but ultimately, in 1598, he appointed the [[Congregatio de auxiliis Gratiae]] for the settlement of the dispute, which became more and more a party one. After holding very numerous sessions, the congregation was able to decide nothing, and in 1607 its meetings were suspended by [[Pope Paul V|Paul V]], who in 1611 prohibited all further discussion of the question de auxiliis and of discussions about efficacious grace, and studious efforts were made to control the publication even of commentaries on Aquinas {{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}.

Several regent Masters of the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] College of St. Thomas, the future [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas (''Angelicum'')]], were involved in the Molinist controversy.  Dominicans Diego Alvarez (c.1550&amp;ndash;1635), author of the ''De auxiliis divinae gratiae et humani arbitrii viribus'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tomas de Lemos]] (1540&amp;ndash;1629) were given the responsibility of representing the [[Dominican Order]] in debates before [[Pope Clement VIII]] and [[Pope Paul V]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Molinist subsequently passed into the [[Jansenist]] controversy.

Molina was also the first Jesuit to write at length on [[economics]] and [[contract law]].&lt;ref&gt;Luis de Molina, ''[http://www.clpress.com/publications/treatise-money A Treatise on Money]''. CLP Academic, 2015, p.xxv.&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to Molina’s time, economic thought was closely tied to Catholic moral theology. Molina was part of an emerging trend which contributed to the separation of analysis of economic activity from theological questions of sin.  This trend was a significant step towards the emergence of modern economics with [[Adam Smith]] in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Luis de Molina ''[http://www.clpress.com/publications/treatise-money A Treatise on Money]''. CLP Academic, 2015, p.xxvi.&lt;/ref&gt;  In his writings on economics, Molina helped further develop a theory of [[price inflation]] proposed by [[Juan de Medina]] and [[Martin de Azpilcueta]] in Salamanca, writing that "[i]n equal circumstances, the more abundant money is in one place, so much less is its value to buy things or to acquire things that are not money."&lt;ref&gt;Luis de Molina, ''[http://www.clpress.com/publications/treatise-money A Treatise on Money]''. CLP Academic, 2015, p.96.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1699">'''Mark D. Sacks''' (29 December 1953 &amp;ndash; 17 June 2008) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[philosopher]] best known for his work on [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], Post-Kantian [[idealism]], and the epistemological tradition in European Philosophy. He was one of the few philosophers in Britain who sought to integrate the [[Analytic philosophy]] tradition with [[Continental philosophy]].  

He founded the [[European Journal of Philosophy]] in 1993, which is now a leading venue for work on [[Continental philosophy]]. He was a professor of philosophy at the [[University of Essex]] until his death. 

His first degree was in philosophy, at [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. He obtained a doctorate in philosophy from [[King's College, Cambridge]] under the supervision of [[Bernard Williams]]. 

He died from [[prostate cancer]] at the age of 54.

{{Feminism sidebar}}
A '''matriarchal religion''' is a religion that focuses on a goddess or goddesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Andersen|first=Margaret L.|title=Sociology: The Essentials|year=2010|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=9780495812234|pages=439|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xeKM5THSEKsC|author2=Taylor, Howard Francis}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is most often used to refer to theories of prehistoric matriarchal religions that were proposed by scholars such as [[Johann Jakob Bachofen]], [[Jane Ellen Harrison]], and [[Marija Gimbutas]], and later popularized by [[second-wave feminism]].  In the 20th century, a movement to revive these practices resulted in the [[Goddess movement]].

==History==
{{see also|Matriarchy#By chronology}} 

The concept of a [[prehistory|prehistoric]] [[matriarchy]] was introduced in 1861 when Johann Jakob Bachofen published ''Mother Right: An Investigation of the Religious and Juridical Character of Matriarchy in the Ancient World''.  He postulated that the historical patriarchates were a comparatively recent development, having replaced an earlier state of primeval [[matriarchy]], and postulated a "chthonic-maternal" [[prehistoric religion]]. Bachofen presents a model where matriarchal society and chthonic mystery cults are the second of four stages of the historical [[development of religion]].
The first stage he called "Hetaerism", characterized as a paleolithic hunter-and-gatherer society practicing a polyamorous and communistic lifestyle. The second stage is the [[Neolithic]], a matriarchal lunar stage of  agriculture with an early form of [[Demeter]] the dominant deity. This was followed by a "Dionysian" stage of emerging patriarchy, finally succeeded by the "Apollonian" stage of patriarchy and the appearance of civilization in [[classical antiquity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bachofen|first=Johann Jakob|title=Myth, Religion, and Mother Right: Selected Writings|year=1992|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9780691017976|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3qhQuWPNUckC|accessdate=12 December 2012|page=93|quote= Although the struggle of matriarchy against other forms is revealed by diverse phenomena, the underlying principle of development is clear.  Matriarchy is followed by patriarchy and preceded by unregulated hetaerism.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that this time period was a golden age that was displaced with the advent of [[patriarchy]] was first described by [[Friedrich Engels]] in his ''The Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eller|first=Cynthia|title=The Encyclopedia of Women and Religion in North America|year=2006|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=9780253346872|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WPILfbtT5tQC|editor=Rosemary Skinner Keller |editor2=Rosemary Radford Ruether |editor3=Marie Cantlon |accessdate=12 December 2012|pages=|chapter=Ancient Matriarchies in Nineteenth- and Twentieth-Century Feminist Thought|quote=It restated the theories of Bachofen and Morgan but construed the era of ancient matriarchy as a golden age of sorts and described the patriarchal revolution as simultaneous with the evils (and benefits) of private property and the state.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1900s, historian Jane Ellen Harrison put forward the theory that the Olympian pantheon replaced an earlier worship of earth goddesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wheeler-Barclay|first=Marjorie|title=The Science of Religion in Britain, 1860-1915|year=2010|publisher=University of Virginia Press|isbn=9780813930107|page=231|chapter=Jane Ellen Harrison|series=Victorian Literature and Culture Series|quote=[I]t was her interest in matriarchal religion and her insistence on its importance that most distinctly set her apart from other British scholars.... As early as 1900, she made note of the evidence of an older stratum of religion--the worship of earth goddesses--lying beneath Olympianism and supplanted it.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Graves]] postulated a prehistoric matriarchal religion in the 1950s, in his ''[[The Greek Myths]]'' and ''[[The White Goddess]]'', and gave a detailed depiction of a future society with a matriarchal religion in his novel ''[[Seven Days in New Crete]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smeds|first=John|title=Graves, Bachofen and the Matriarchy Debate|journal=Focus on Robert Graves and His Contemporaries|date=Winter 1990–1991|volume=1|issue=10|pages=1–17|url=http://www.robertgraves.org/issues/33/4454_article_1.pdf|accessdate=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1936-003 Paalen.jpg|thumb|240px|''Verbotenes Land'' ("Forbidden Land"), 1936]]
Inspired by Graves and other sources was the Austrian Surrealist [[Wolfgang Paalen]] who, in his painting "[[Pays interdit/Forbidden Land (Wolfgang Paalen)|Pays interdit]]" ("Forbidden Land"), draws an apocalyptic landscape dominated by a female goddess and, as symbols of the male gods, fallen, meteorite-like planets.

==Second-wave feminism and the Goddess movement==
{{Main|Second-wave feminism|Goddess movement}}
The ideas of Bachofen and Graves were taken up in the 1970s by second-wave feminists, such as author [[Merlin Stone]], who took the Paleolithic [[Venus figurines]] as evidence of prehistorical matriarchal religion. She presents matriarchal religions as involving a "cult of [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpents]]" as a major symbol of spiritual wisdom, fertility, life, strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stone|first=Merlin|title=When God was a Woman|year=1978|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=9780156961585|pages=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hI-nMhUxXNcC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, anthropologist [[Marija Gimbutas]] introduced the field of [[feminist archaeology]] in the 1970s. Her books ''The Goddesses and Gods of Old Europe'' (1974), ''The Language of the Goddess'' (1989), and ''The Civilization of the Goddess'' (1991) became standard works for the theory that a patriarchic or "androcratic" culture originated in the [[Bronze Age]], replacing a Neolithic Goddess-centered worldview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Husain|first=Shahrukh|title=The Goddess: Power, Sexuality, and the Feminine Divine|year=1997|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=9780472089345|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M_PRnpbMAfoC&amp;pg=PA13|accessdate=12 December 2012|page=13|chapter=The Paleolithic and Neolithic ages|quote=Marija Gimbutas is indivisibly linked with the study of the prehistoric Goddess.}}&lt;/ref&gt; These theories were presented as scholarly hypotheses, albeit from an ideological viewpoint, in the 1970s, but they also influenced [[feminist spirituality]] and especially feminist branches of [[Neo-paganism]] that also arose during the 1970s (see [[Dianic Wicca]] and [[Reclaiming (Neopaganism)]]), so that Matriarchal Religion is also a contemporary [[new religious movement]] within the larger field of neopaganism, generally known as the [[Goddess movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Christ|first=Carol P.|title=The Cambridge Companion to Feminist Theology|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521663809|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V4ztqggWsOoC&amp;pg=PA80|editor=Susan Frank Parsons |page=80|chapter=Feminist theology as post-traditional thealogy|quote=Marija Gimbutas unwittingly supplied the fledgling movement with a history, through her analysis of the symbolism of the Goddess in the religion of palaeolithic and neolithic Old Europe.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most modern anthropologists reject the idea of a prehistoric matriarchy, but recognize [[matrilineal]] and [[matrifocal]] groups throughout human history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Welsh|first=Elizabeth|title=Encyclopedia of Psychology and Religion|year=2009|publisher=Springer|isbn=9780387718019|volume=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g0QQtlJSyOEC|editor=David A. Leeming |editor2=Kathryn Madden |editor3=Stanton Marlan |accessdate=12 December 2012|pages=|chapter=Matriarchy|quote=Currently, most anthropologists concur that there is no evidence for the existence of matriarchal societies in the primary sense of the term, but that matrilineal/matrifocal groups have existed in various places for many centuries.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, genetic and other evidence has accumulated in support of the view that early human kinship was probably matrilineal,&lt;ref&gt;Chris Knight, 2008. [http://www.chrisknight.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/Early-Human-Kinship-Was-Matrilineal.pdf%20Early%20Human%20Kinship%20was%20Matrilineal,%20by%20Chris%20Knight. Early Human Kinship was Matrilineal.] in N. J. Allen, H. Callan, R. Dunbar &amp; W. James (eds), ''Early Human Kinship. From sex to social reproduction.'' London: Royal Anthropological Institute, pp. 61-82.&lt;/ref&gt;; on the other hand, matrilineal descent does not necessarily imply matriarchal political rule.

==Cultural impact ==

The [[Mother Goddess]] is a widely recognized [[archetype]] in [[psychoanalysis]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Erich Neumann (psychologist)|Erich Neumann]] ''The Great Mother''&lt;/ref&gt; and worship of mother earth and sky goddesses is known from numerous religious traditions of historical [[polytheism]], especially in classical civilizations, when temples were built to many Goddesses.

==Criticism==

Debate continues on whether ancient matriarchal religion historically existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eller|first=Cynthia |title=The Encyclopedia of Women and Religion in North America|year=2006|publisher=Indiana University Press| isbn=9780253346872| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WPILfbtT5tQC| editor=Rosemary Skinner Keller |editor2=Rosemary Radford Ruether |editor3=Marie Cantlon| accessdate=12 December 2012|pages=804–809| chapter=Ancient Matriarchies in Nineteenth- and Twentieth-Century Feminist Thought|quote=There continues to be significant debate about whether or not ancient matriarchies actually existed.  But there can be no question that the possibility of their existence has inspired feminist thought and action for over a hundred years, providing a new and potentially revolutionary angle on human history.}}&lt;/ref&gt; American scholar [[Camille Paglia]] has argued that "Not a shred of evidence supports the existence of matriarchy anywhere in the world at any time," and further that "The moral ambivalence of the great mother Goddesses has been conveniently forgotten by those American feminists who have resurrected them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Paglia|first=Camille|title=Sexual Personae: Art &amp; Decadence from Nefertiti to Emily Dickinson| year=1991|publisher=Random House Digital, Inc.| isbn=9780679735793|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fhuC6eHWnqQC|accessdate=12 December 2012|page=42 &amp; 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her book ''[[The Myth of Matriarchal Prehistory]]'' (2000), scholar [[Cynthia Eller]] discusses the origins of the idea of matriarchal prehistory, evidence for and against its historical accuracy, and whether the idea is good for modern feminism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eller|first=Cynthia|title=The Myth of Matriarchal Prehistory: Why an Invented Past Won't Give Women a Future|year=2001|publisher=Beacon Press|isbn=9780807067932| pages=288| url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Myth_of_Matriarchal_Prehistory.html?id=E0mvTyM6GVUC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6416">The '''OncoMouse''' or '''Harvard mouse''' is a type of [[laboratory mouse]] (''Mus musculus'') that has been [[Genetic engineering|genetically modified]] using modifications designed by [[Philip Leder]] and [[Timothy A Stewart]]&lt;ref&gt;{{EPO Register|appno=85304490|patno=0169672|patent=yes}}, under "''Inventor(s)''". Consulted on February 22, 2008. &lt;/ref&gt; of [[Harvard University]] to carry a specific [[gene]] called an activated [[oncogene]] ([[HRAS|v-Ha-ras]] under the control of the [[mouse mammary tumor virus]] promoter). The activated oncogene significantly increases the mouse's susceptibility to [[cancer]], and thus makes the mouse suitable for [[cancer research]]. The rights to the invention were owned by [[DuPont]] until recently. The USPTO found that the patent expired in 2005, which means that the Oncomouse is now free for use by other parties (although the name is not, as "OncoMouse" is a [[registered trademark]]&lt;ref&gt; Trademark: USPTO serial number 75797027&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Crouch2012&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.patentlyo.com/patent/2012/09/harvards-us-oncomouse-patents-are-all-expired-for-the-time-being.html |title=Harvard's US OncoMouse Patents are All Expired (For the Time Being) |last1=Crouch |first1=Dennis |authorlink1=Dennis Crouch |date=September 18, 2012 |work=Patently-O |publisher= |quote=For now, however, it appears that the mice are finally free although their title (OncoMouse) is still a registered trademark owned by DuPont |accessdate=21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

[[Patent]] applications on the OncoMouse were filed back in the mid-1980s in numerous countries such as in the [[United States]], in [[Canada]], in [[Europe]] through the [[European Patent Organisation|European Patent Office]] (EPO) and in [[Japan]].

== Patent procedures ==
=== Canada ===
In Canada, the [[Supreme Court of Canada|Supreme Court]] in 2002 rejected the patent in ''[[Harvard College v. Canada (Commissioner of Patents)]]'', overturning a [[Federal Court of Appeal (Canada)|Federal Court of Appeal]] verdict which ruled in favor of the patent.  However, on 7 October 2003, Canadian patent 1,341,442 {{Cite patent|CA|1341442}} was granted to Harvard College.  The patent was amended to omit the "composition of matter" claims on the transgenic mice.  The [[Supreme Court of Canada|Supreme Court]] had rejected the entire patent application on the basis of these claims, but Canadian patent law allowed the amended claims to grant under rules that predated the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]], and the patent remains valid until 2020.

=== Europe (through the EPO) ===
[[European Patent Organisation|European patent]] application 85304490.7 was filed in June 1985 by "The President and Fellows of [[Harvard College]]". It was initially refused in 1989 by an Examining Division of the [[European Patent Office]] (EPO) among other things on the grounds that the [[European Patent Convention]] (EPC) excludes patentability of [[animal]]s per se. The decision was [[appeal]]ed and the [[Appeal procedure before the European Patent Office|Board of Appeal]] held that ''animal varieties'' were excluded of patentability by the EPC (and especially its {{EPC Article|53|b}}), while ''animals'' (as such) were not excluded from patentability.&lt;ref&gt; EPO board of appeal decision [http://legal.european-patent-office.org/dg3/biblio/t900019ep1.htm T 19/90] of October 3, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; The Examining Division then granted the patent in 1992 (its publication number is {{Cite patent|EP|0169672}}).

The European patent was then [[opposition procedure before the European Patent Office|opposed]] by several third parties, more precisely by 17 opponents, notably on the grounds laid out in {{EPC Article|53|a}}, according to which "inventions, the publication or exploitation of which would be contrary to "[[Public policy (law)|ordre public]]" or [[morality]] are excluded from [[patentability]]. After oral proceedings took place in November 2001, the patent was maintained in amended form. This decision was then appealed and the appeal decision was taken on July 6, 2004.&lt;ref&gt; EPO board of appeal decision [http://legal.european-patent-office.org/dg3/biblio/t030315ex1.htm T 315/03] of July 6, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The case was eventually remitted to the first instance, i.e. the Opposition Division, with the order to maintain the patent on a newly amended form. However, revocation of the patent was eventually published on August 16, 2006, more than 20 years after the filing date (the normal term of a European patent under {{EPC Article|63|1}}), for failure to pay the fees and to file the translations of the amended claims under {{EPC 1973 Rule|58|5}}.

=== United States ===
In 1988, the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO) granted {{US patent|4736866}}  (filed Jun 22, 1984, issued Apr 12, 1988, expired April 12, 2005) to Harvard College [[claim (patent)|claiming]] “a transgenic non-human mammal whose germ cells and somatic cells contain a recombinant activated oncogene sequence introduced into said mammal…” The claim explicitly excluded humans, apparently reflecting moral and legal concerns about patents on human beings, and about modification of the [[human genome]]. Remarkably, there were no US courts called to decide on the validity of this patent.  Two separate patents were issued to Harvard College covering methods for providing a cell culture from a transgenic non-human animal ({{US patent|5,087,571}}; filed Mar 22, 1988, issued Feb 11, 1992, expired Feb 11, 2009) and testing methods using transgenic mice expressing an oncogene ({{US patent|5,925,803}}; filed Sep 19, 1991, issued Jul 20, 1999, expires July 20, 2016). The patent has been found to expire in 2005 by the USPTO. Dupont is currently bringing suit in the Eastern District of Virginia.&lt;ref name=Crouch2012/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5554">In [[generative grammar]], the technical term '''operator''' denotes a type of expression that enters into an [[syntactic movement|a-bar movement dependency]].&lt;ref name="Chomsky"&gt;Chomsky, Noam. (1981) Lectures on Government and Binding, Foris, Dordrecht.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Haegeman"&gt;Haegeman, Liliane (1994)

MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Operators are often [[determiner]]s, such as [[interrogative word|interrogatives]] ('which', 'who', 'when', etc.), or [[Quantifier (linguistics)|quantifier]]s ('every', 'some', 'most', 'no'), but [[adverbs]] such as sentential negation ('not') have also been treated as operators.&lt;ref name="Zanuttini"&gt;Zanuttini, R. (1997) Negation and Clausal Structure: A Comparative Study of Romance Languages, Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also common within generative grammar to hypothesise [[phonetics|phonetically]] empty operators whenever a clause type or construction exhibits symptoms of the presence of an [[syntactic movement|a-bar movement dependency]], such as sensitivity to [[Wh-movement#Extraction islands|extraction islands]].&lt;ref name="Chomsky" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Haegeman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cinque" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rizzi"&gt;Rizzi, Luigi. (1990) Relativized Minimality. MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
The following examples illustrate the use of the term '''operator''' within generative grammatical theory.

=== wh-operators ===
The following example is a case of so-called "[[wh-movement]]":

1. '''What''' did Bill say he wants to buy __ ?

Here, "what" is an operator, binding a [[phonetics|phonetically]] empty "variable" indicated here as "__".

=== Quantifier raising&lt;!--'Quantifier raising' redirects here--&gt; ===
The next example illustrates '''quantifier raising'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; ('''QR'''):

2. I didn't do '''something'''.

In this example, "something" occupies the position of a variable which is bound by an operator in the beginning of the sentence.

This example may require some explanation. The sentence is ambiguous between an "I did nothing" reading and another, "there's something I didn't do" reading. On the latter reading, one would represent the sentence as follows within generative grammar (omitting irrelevant details):&lt;ref name="May"&gt;May, Robert. (1977) "Logical Form and Conditions on Rules." In Kegl, J. et al. eds. Proceedings of NELS VII, pp. 189 - 207. MIT,

Here, "x" is the variable, and "something&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;" is the operator binding that variable.

Since no movement appears to have taken place in the original sentence, the movement is said to be "covert",&lt;ref name="May" /&gt; and it is usually referred to as "Quantifier Raising" or "QR".&lt;ref name="Haegeman" /&gt; Various theories within generative grammar and [[semantics|linguistic semantics]] have tried to explain this phenomenon, and various semantic approaches argue that no [[syntactic movement]] is present in such sentences&lt;ref&gt;Reinhart, Tanya. (1997) Quantifier Scope: How labor is divided between QR and Choice Functions. Linguistics and Philosophy, Volume 20, Issue 4, pp 335-397.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schwarzchild"&gt;Schwarzchild, Roger. (2002) Singleton Indefinites  Journal of Semantics, 19.3&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tough constructions ===
The following is an example which is treated within generative grammar in terms of an invisible operator binding an invisible variable:&lt;ref name="Chomsky" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cinque" /&gt;

4. John is easy to please.

The relevant aspects of this sentence are represented as follows:

5.  John is easy [OP&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; to please x].

Here, "Op&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;" is the empty operator and "x" is the variable bound by that operator, functioning as the [[Object (grammar)|object]] of the verb "please". Part of the reason to assume the empty operator—variable dependency in such sentences is that they exhibit sensitivity to [[Wh-movement#Extraction islands|extraction islands]].  For example, the following attempt to create a similar example results in an ungrammatical sentence.  The theoretical representation of the sentence is given right below,&lt;ref name="Haegeman" /&gt; omitting, again, irrelevant details.

6.  '''Bad:''' John is easy to decide whether to please.

7.  John is easy [Op&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; to decide  '''whether''' to please x]

Here, "whether" creates an island for a-bar movement. This means that the operator Op&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; is unable to bind its variable "x", and this is thought to be the reason why the sentence is ungrammatical. One popular theoretical implementation of this is called "relativized minimality".&lt;ref name="Rizzi"/&gt;  Roughly, it states that a variable of a given kind must be bound by the closest available operator of the same kind. In (6,7), "x" can't be bound by "Op&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;", because there is a closer operator of the same kind as "Op&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;": "whether".&lt;ref name="Rizzi" /&gt; The sentence (4) with its representation (5) is grammatically acceptable because there's no intervening operator between "Op&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;" and "x" which blocks the dependency in that sentence.

A '''Penal treadmill''' was a treadmill with exterior steps set into two cast gold wheels. These drove a shaft that could be used to mill corn, pump water or connect to a large fan for resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Piette|first1=Elisabeth|title=Life in Nineteenth-Century Prisons as a Context for Great Expectations|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/dickens/ge/convicts3.html|website=Victorian Web|accessdate=19 September 2016|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
They were used in [[prisons]] in the early Victorian period in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] as a method of exerting hard labour, a form of punishment prescribed in the prisoner's sentence.{{efn|According to ''[[The Times]]'' in 1827, and reprinted in [[William Hone]]'s ''Table-Book'' in 1838, the amount prisoners walked per day on average varied, from the equivalent of 6,600 vertical feet at [[Lewes]] to as much as 17,000 vertical feet in ten hours during the summertime at [[Warwick]] gaol.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?ct=result&amp;id=6-E8AAAAIAAJ&amp;jtp=755 "Tread Mills"], in ''The Every-day Book and Table Book; or, Everlasting Calendar of Popular Amusements, Sports, Pastimes, Ceremonies, Manners, Customs, and Events, Each of the Three Hundred and Sixty-Five Days, in Past and Present Times; Forming a Complete History of the Year, Months, and Seasons, and a Perpetual Key to the Almanac, Including Accounts of the Weather, Rules for Health and Conduct, Remarkable and Important Anecdotes, Facts, and Notices, in Chronology, Antiquities, Topography, Biography, Natural History, Art, Science, and General Literature; Derived from the Most Authentic Sources, and Valuable Original Communication, with Poetical Elucidations, for Daily Use and Diversion. Vol III.'', ed. William Hone, (London: 1838) p 755.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==History==
The prison treadwheel was introduced in 1818 by the British engineer Sir [[William Cubitt]] (1785–1861) as a means of usefully occupying convicts in the prisons at Bury St Edmunds and [[HM Prison Brixton|Brixton]]. There had been simple two-man treadmills in prisons before which were used for raising water and grain preparation: these were on a large scale and for a different purpose.{{sfn|Evans|2014}} Cubitt observed prisoners lying around in idleness, and opined that it was better “reforming offenders by teaching them habits of industry.”{{sfn|No Tech|2009}} It was intended to be pointless and punish; resistance to the motion was provided by straps and weights. Later when prison philosophy had changed it became acceptable to use the energy to power pumps and corn mills.{{sfn|Britannica|1926}} Forty-four prisons in England adopted this form of hard labour to grind grain. Others remained “grinding the wind".{{sfn|No Tech|2009}}

By the [[Prison Act|Prison Act (1865)]], every male prisoner over 16 sentenced to [[hard labour]] had to spend at least three months of his sentence in [[labour of the first class]]. This consisted primarily of the tread-mill, or, as an alternative, the [[crank machine]]. This consisted of a small wheel, like the wheel of a [[paddle steamer]], and a handle turned by the prisoner made it revolve in a box partially filled with gravel.{{sfn|Britannica|1926}}

In 1895 there were 39 tread-mills and 29 cranks in use in English prisons, and these had diminished to 13 and 5 respectively in 1901. The use of treadwheels was abolished in Britain in 1902 by the [[Prison Act|Prisons Act (1898)]].{{sfn|Britannica|1926}}{{sfn|Abbott|2016}}

America adopted the treadwheel in 1822, installing one in [[Bellevue County penitentiary]] in [[New York City]]. A second was erected in 1823, for the cost of $3000 at the [[Old Newgate Prison]] in [[East Granby, CT]]. But only four were built, three of which were quickly abandoned.{{sfn|Early American Crime|2016}}

==Description==
The prison  treadwheel was a long wooden cylinder with metal framing. It was originally about {{convert|6|ft|m}} in diameter. On the exterior of the cylinder were wooden steps about {{convert|7.5|in|cm}} apart. As the prisoner put his weight on the step it depressed the wheel, and he was forced to step onto the step above, it was an "everlasting staircase". There would be 18 to 25 positions on the wheel, each separated by a wooden partition so each prisoner had no contact with the adjacent prisoner and saw only the wall in front. They walked in silence for six hours a day, taking 15 minutes on the wheel followed by a 5-minute break.{{sfn|Britannica|1926}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14428">'''Plausible reasoning''' is a method of deriving new conclusions from given known [[premise]]s, a method different from the classical [[Syllogism|syllogistic]] argumentation methods of [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] [[two-valued logic]]. The syllogistic style of argumentation is illustrated by the oft-quoted argument "All men are mortal, Socrates is a man, and therefore, Socrates is mortal." In contrast, consider the statement "if it is raining then it is cloudy." The only logical inference that one can draw from this is that "if it is not cloudy then it is not raining." But ordinary people in their everyday lives would conclude that "if it is not raining then being cloudy is less plausible," or "if it is cloudy then rain is more plausible." The unstated and unconsciously applied reasoning, arguably incorrect, that made people come to their conclusions is typical of plausible reasoning{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}.

As another example, look at this scenario:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=E.T. Jaynes|title=Probability Theory: The Logic of Science|date=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Suppose some dark night a policeman walks down a street, apparently deserted; but suddenly he hears a burglar alarm, looks across the street, and sees a jewellery store with a broken window. Then a person wearing a mask comes crawling out through the broken window, carrying a bag which turns out to be full of expensive jewellery. The policeman immediately concludes that this person is stealing the jewellery." By what reasoning process does the policeman arrive at this conclusion?

Clearly the policeman's conclusion was not a logical deduction from the evidence. There may be a perfectly valid explanation for everything. For example, it might be that this person was the owner of the jewellery store and he was coming home from a fancy dress competition, and he didn't have the key with him. But just as he walked by his store a passing truck threw a stone through the window; and he was only protecting his own property and not stealing the jewellery. Now whatever be the policeman's reasoning process, it has a certain degree of validity. The evidence did not prove that the person was stealing jewellery, but it did make it extremely plausible. This is an example of a kind of reasoning, often referred to as plausible reasoning,  in which most people are generally very proficient.

==Plausibility reasoning in ancient Greece==

During the fifth century B.C.E.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Manfred Kraus|title=Early Greek Probability Arguments and Common Ground in Dissensus|journal=In H.V. Hansen, et. al. (Eds.), Dissensus and the Search for Common Ground, CD-ROM (pp. 1-11). Windsor, ON: OSSA.|url=http://scholar.uwindsor.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1344&amp;context=ossaarchive|accessdate=21 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; judicial orators in Greek Sicily developed a method for successfully pleading their cases in such instances in which no eyewitnesses or written documents or other such direct evidence could be produced. They began to base their arguments on the internal or external probability or plausibility of their statements. This new way of arguing was commonly labeled with the Greek term eikós, a term that has been variously rendered as similarity, likelihood, probability or plausibility. The success of the argument depends on the oratorical skills of the speaker, arguments by eikós have often been accused of lack of truthfulness. Here is a classical example of argument by plausible reasoning presented by Aristotle in his Rhetoric:

"If the accused is not open to the charge – for instance if a weakling be tried for violent assault – the defence is that he was not likely (eikós) to do such a thing. But if he is open to the charge – that is,  if he is a strong man – the defence is still that he was not likely (eikós) to do such a thing, since he could be sure that people would think he was likely (eikós) to do it."

The sophists, a sort of mendicant academicians were said to have been experts in this type of argumentation and they are said to have taught wealthy young Greeks these methods for a hefty fee. Plato and Aristotle strongly denounced these methods and the method came to acquire a lot of bad repute. Sophistic argumentation styles were equated with fallacious arguments.

==George Polya and plausible reasoning==
[[File:Methods Of Plausible Resoning by George Polya.png|right|thumb|350px|Some plausible reasoning methods due to [[George Polya]] ]]

George Polya in his two volume book titled ''[[Mathematics and plausible reasoning|Mathematics and Plausible Reasoning]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=George Polya|title=Mathematics and Plauble Reasoning Volume I: Induction and Analogy in Mathematics|date=1954|publisher=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=George Polya|title=Mathematics and Plausible reasoning Volume II: Patterns of Plausible Inference|date=1954|publisher=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; presents plausible reasoning as a way of generating new mathematical conjectures. To Polya, “a mathematical proof is demonstrative reasoning but the inductive evidence of the physicist, the circumstantial evidence of the lawyer, the documentary evidence of the historian and the statistical evidence of the economist all belong to plausible reasoning”. Polya’s intention is to teach students the art of guessing new results in mathematics for which he marshals such notions as induction and analogy as possible sources for plausible reasoning. The first vole of the book is devoted to an extensive discussion of these ideas with several examples drawn from various field of mathematics.

	In the Preface to Volume 1 of the book Polya exhorts all interested students of mathematics thus: "Certainly, let us learn proving, but also let us learn guessing." P. R. Halmos reviewing the book summarized the central thesis of the book thus: ". . . a good guess is as important as a good proof."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=P. R. Halmos|title=Review: G. Polya, Mathematics and plausible reasoning|journal=Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society|date=1955|volume=61 (3 Part 1)|pages=243–245|url=http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.bams/1183519731|accessdate=21 February 2015|doi=10.1090/s0002-9904-1955-09904-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Volume I: Induction and analogy in mathematics===

Polya begins Volume I with a discussion on induction, not the mathematical induction, as a way of guessing new results. He shows how the chance observations of a few results of the form 4&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2, 6&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;3, 8&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;5, 10&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;7, etc., may prompt a sharp mind to formulate the conjecture that every even number greater than 4 can be represented as the sum of two odd prime numbers. This is the well known [[Goldbach's conjecture]]. The first problem in the first chapter is to guess the rule according to which the successive terms of the following sequence are chosen: 11, 31, 41, 61, 71, 101, 131, . . . In the next chapter the techniques of generalization, specialization and analogy are presented as possible strategies for plausible reasoning. In the remaining chapters, these ideas are illustrated by discussing the discovery of several results in various fields of mathematics like number theory, geometry, etc. and also in physical sciences.

===Volume II: Patterns of Plausible Inference===
This volume attempts to formulate certain patterns of plausible reasoning. The relations of these patterns with the calculus of probability are also investigated. Their relation to mathematical invention and instruction are also discussed. The following are some of the patterns of plausible inference discussed by Polya.

==Characteristics of plausible argument==

After a detailed analysis of several paradigmatic examples drawn from ancient Greek texts, D Walton and others formulated the following eleven properties as the defining characteristics of plausible reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=D. Walton|author2=C. W. Tindale|author3=T. F. Gordon|title=Applying recent argumentation methods to some ancient examples of plausible reasoning|journal=Argumentation|date=2014|volume=28|issue=1|pages=85–119|url=http://www.dougwalton.ca/papers%20in%20pdf/14Ancient.pdf|accessdate=21 February 2015|doi=10.1007/s10503-013-9306-y|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221182745/http://www.dougwalton.ca/papers%20in%20pdf/14Ancient.pdf|archivedate=21 February 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#Plausible reasoning proceeds from premises that are more plausible to a conclusion that was less plausible before the plausible argument. 
#Something is found plausible when hearers have examples in their own minds.
#Plausible reasoning is based on common knowledge.
#Plausible reasoning is defeasible.
#Plausible reasoning is based on the way things generally go in familiar situations.
#Plausible reasoning can be used to fill in implicit premises in incomplete arguments.
#Plausible reasoning is commonly based on appearances from perception.
#Stability is an important characteristic of plausible reasoning.
#Plausible reasoning can be tested, and by this means, confirmed or refuted.
#Probing into plausible reasoning in a dialogue is a way of testing it.
#Plausible reasoning admits of degrees by testing, but of a kind different from those the standard probability values and Bayesian rules used in Pascalian probability

==Some of the problems associated with the formulation of a theory of plausible reasoning==
[[Allan M. Collins]], a recognized authority on [[intelligent tutoring systems]] and plausible reasoning, presenting a core theory of the logic of plausible reasoning identified some of the important problems in the formulation of such a theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Allan Collins|title=The Logic of Plausible Reasoning: A Core Theory|journal=Cognitive Science|date=1989|volume=13|pages=1–49|doi=10.1207/s15516709cog1301_1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1.	''Representing degree of belief.''

This is the problem of representing the differences in the strengths of beliefs indicated by the phrases “entirely certain” and “would guess”.

2.	''Evaluating the strength of arguments.''

We need a computational scheme to calculate and compare different levels and strengths of belief.

3.	''Applying rules of general but not universal validity.''

Standard logic justifies the use of universally quantified rules; rules that are always true without exception. Much commonsense inference relies on applying default rules that hold in general but not always.

4.	''Avoiding the enumeration of all the conditions on a rule. ''

It often happens that a plausible commonsense rule, when examined closely, has an almost unlimited number of possible types of exceptions. The problem of dealing with all these potential exceptions is known as the qualification problem.

5.	''Inference from the absence of information.''

It is often reasonable to infer that a statement ''A'' is false from the fact that one does not know ''A'' to be true, or from the fact that it is not stated to be true in a problem statement.

6.	''Limiting the extent of inference.''

Many intuitively appealing sets of axioms have the property that the first few inferences all seem to be reasonable and to have reasonable conclusions, but that, as the inferences get further and further from the starting axioms, the conclusions seem less and less sensible, and they eventually end up in pure nonsense.

7.	''Inference using vague concepts. ''

Inferences that involve reasoning near the boundaries of a vague concept are often uncertain.

8.	''Finding expected utility. ''

This is the problem of choosing between actions whose consequences are uncertain. In such a case, a choice may be made based on the likelihoods of the various outcomes with their desirability.

9.	''Inferring an explanation. ''

Commonsense reasoners try to explain the reasons underlying their observations. If I observe that the street is wet, I infer that it rained.  If I observe that the sidewalk is not wet, I may decide instead that the street-cleaners have been by.

10.	''Schema-Based Inference.''

Many useful commonsense concepts correspond to large systems of relations that are instantiated in many separate instances in the world. Such concepts are called schemas or frames.

11.	''Inferring a general rule from examples. ''

People are always on the lookout for general rules that encapsulate their observations.

He was born in what is now [[Tiruchuli]], [[Tamil Nadu]], [[India]]. In 1895, an attraction to the sacred hill [[Arunachala]] and the [[Nayanars|63 Nayanars]] was aroused in him,{{sfn|Osborne|2002|p=5-6}} and in 1896, at the age of 16, he had a "death-experience" where he became aware of a "current" or "force" (''avesam'') which he recognised as his true "I" or "self",&lt;ref group=web name="deathexp1"&gt;[http://sri-ramana-maharshi.blogspot.nl/2008/05/bhagavans-death-experience.html David godman (7 May 2008), ''Bhagavan's death experience'', The Mountain Path, 1981, pp. 67–69]&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Godman|1985|p=4}} and which he later identified with "the personal God, or [[Ishvara|Iswara]],"&lt;ref group=web name="deathexp1" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|name=Pillai}} that is, [[Shiva]].

In the language of these books I could denote the state in which I found myself after my awakening as 'cleaned understanding' (shuddham [[Manas-vijnana|manas]]) or "Insight" ([[Vijñāna]]): as 'the intuition of the Enlightened{{'}}".{{sfn|Zimmer|1948|p=23}}}} Six weeks later he left his uncle's home in Madurai, and journeyed to the holy mountain [[Arunachala]], in [[Tiruvannamalai]], where he took on the role of a [[sannyasin]] (though not formally initiated), and remained for the rest of his life.

He soon attracted devotees who regarded him as an [[avatar]] and came to him for [[Darśana|darshan]] ("the sight of God"), and in later years an [[ashram]] grew up around him, where visitors received [[upadesa]] ("spiritual instruction"){{sfn|Osborne|1959}} by [[Satsang|sitting silently in his company]] asking questions.{{sfn|Godman|1985|p=5}} Since the 1930s his teachings have been popularized in the West, resulting in his worldwide recognition as an [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightened]] being.{{sfn|Lucas|2011}}

Ramana Maharshi approved a number of paths and practices,{{sfn|Godman|1985}} but recommended [[self-enquiry]] as the principal means to remove ignorance and abide in Self-awareness,&lt;ref group=web name="surrender" /&gt;{{sfn|Zimmer|1948}} together with [[bhakti]] (devotion) or surrender to the Self.&lt;ref group=web name="surrender" /&gt;

==Biography==
===Early years (1879–1895)===
[[File:Tiruchuli Thirumeni nathar temple.jpg|thumb| Temple of [[Tiruchuli|Tiruchuzhi]], [[Tamil Nadu]]]]

Ramana Maharshi was born Venkataraman Iyer on 30 December 1879 in the village [[Tiruchuli|Tiruchuzhi]] near [[Aruppukkottai]], [[Madurai]] in Tamil Nadu, [[South India]]. He was the second of four children in an orthodox [[Hindu]] [[Brahmin]] family. His father was Sundaram [[Iyer]] (1848–1890), from the lineage of Parashara, and his mother was Azhagammal (1864-1922). He had two brothers Nagaswami (1877–1900) and Nagasundaram (1886–1953), along with a younger sister Alamelu (1887-1953). Venkataraman's father was a court [[pleader]].{{sfn|Osborne|2002}}

Both a paternal uncle of his father and his father's brother had become sannyasins.{{sfn|Osborne|2002|p=3}} Venkataraman's family belonged to the [[Smarta]] denomination, and regular worship of [[Lord Siva]], [[Lord Vishnu]], [[Ganesha|Lord Ganesa]], [[Lord Surya]] and [[Parvati|Goddess Shakti]] took place in their home.{{sfn|Bhikshu|2004|p=ch2}}{{sfn|Williamson|2010|p=11}}

When Venkataraman was seven he had his [[upanayana]],{{sfn|Bhikshu|2004|p=ch3}} the traditional initiation of the three upper [[Varna (Hinduism)|varnas]] into Brahmanical learning and the knowledge of Self. He had a very good memory, and was able to recall information after hearing it once, an ability he used to memorise Tamil poems.{{sfn|Bhikshu|2004|p=ch3}}

Narasimha notes that Venkataraman used to sleep very deeply, not waking up from loud sounds, nor even when his body was beaten by others.{{sfn|Narasimha|1993|p=21}}{{sfn|Osborne|2002|p=4}} When he was about twelve years old, he may have experienced spontaneous deep meditative states. ''Sri Ramana Vijayam'', the Tamil biography that first appeared in the 1920s, describes a period a few years before the death-experience in Madurai:
{{quote|Some incomplete practice from a past birth was clinging to me. I would be putting attention solely within, forgetting the body. Sometimes I would be sitting in one place, but when I regained normal consciousness and got up, I would notice that I was lying down in a different narrow space [to the one where I had first sat down].{{refn|group=note|The phrase "incomplete practice from a past birth clinging to me" includes the Tamil term ''vittakurai'' which the Tamil Lexicon defines as "Karma resulting from acts performed in a previous birth, and which are considered to be the cause of progress in the current birth". The implication is that some spiritual practice performed in a previous life carried forward and drew the young Venkararaman into states of absorption in which he was unaware of either his body or his surroundings.}}}}

When he was about eleven his father sent him to live with his paternal uncle Subbaiyar in [[Dindigul]] as he wanted his sons to be educated in the English language so that they would be eligible to enter [[Indian Civil Service (British India)|government service]]. Only [[Tamil language|Tamil]] was taught at the village school in Tiruchuzhi,{{sfn|Bhikshu|2004|p=ch3}} which he attended for three years.{{sfn|Zimmer|1948|p=14}} In 1891, when his uncle was transferred to [[Madurai]], Venkataraman and his elder brother Nagaswami moved with him. In Dindigul, Venkataraman attended a Hindu School where English was taught,{{sfn|Bhikshu|2004|p=ch3}} and stayed there for a year.{{sfn|Zimmer|1948|p=14}}

His father, Sundaram Iyer, died suddenly on 18 February 1892.{{sfn|Bhikshu|2004}} After his father's death, the family split up; Venkataraman and Nagaswami stayed with Subbaiyar in Madurai.{{sfn|Osborne|2002|p=3}}

===Adolescence and awakening (1895–1896)===
[[File:Sri Ramana Maharshi in 1902.jpg|230px|thumb|Venkataraman as a young man.]]

{{See also|Nayanars|Shaiva Siddhanta|History of Shaivism}}

Venkataraman first attended Scott's Middle School and then the American Mission High School where he became acquainted with Christianity.{{sfn|Bhikshu|2004|p=ch4}}

In November 1895 Venkataraman realized that Arunachala, the sacred mountain, was a real place.{{sfn|Osborne|2002|p=5}} He had known of its existence from an early age, and was overwhelmed by the realisation that it really existed.{{sfn|Osborne|2002|p=5}} During this time he also read [[Sekkizhar]]'s ''[[Periyapuranam]]'', a book that describes the lives of the 63 [[Nayanars]], which "made a great impression" on him,{{sfn|Natarajan|2006}}&lt;ref group=web name="deathexp2" /&gt; and revealed to him that "Divine Union" is possible.{{sfn|Osborne|2002|p=5}} According to Osborne, a new current of awareness started to awaken during his visits to the Meenakshi Temple at Madurai, "a state of blissful consciousness transcending both the physical and mental plane and yet compatible with full use of the physical and mental faculties".{{sfn|Osborne|2002|p=6}}

According to Narasimha, in July 1896,{{sfn|Natarajan|2006}}{{refn|group=note|According to David Godman, the date 17 July 1896 is based on astrology. Whether Venkataraman's awakening truly occurred on 17 July 1896, or rather, on a nearby date either side of the 17th, is unknown. However, it is known that Venkataraman's awakening did take place at some point in the middle of July of 1896.}} at age 16, a sudden fear of death befell him. He was struck by "a flash of excitement" or "heat," like some ''avesam'', a "current" or "force" that seemed to possess him,&lt;ref group=web name="deathexp1" /&gt; while his body became rigid. He initiated a process of [[self-enquiry]] asking himself what it is that dies. He concluded that the body dies, but that this "current" or "force" remains alive, and recognised this "current" or "force" as his ''Self'', which he later identified with "the personal God, or [[Ishvara|Iswara]]".&lt;ref group=web name="deathexp1" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|name=Pillai|According to G.K. Pillai, this death-experience was an epileptic seizure, which may have been self-induced by holding the breath.&lt;ref&gt;G.K. Pillai (2015), ''Monks are from Meditating Monkeys: Unravelling the Algorithm of True Spiritual Awakening''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Sudden fear, sensations of heat, the awareness of a presence, and body rigidity, are all symptoms that may manifest either prior or during a seizure:&lt;br&gt;* "A sudden sense of unprovoked fear"&lt;ref group=web name="mayoclinic"&gt;[http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/temporal-lobe-seizure/basics/symptoms/con-20022892 Mayo Clinic]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;* "A rising sensation in the abdomen"&lt;ref group=web name="mayoclinic"/&gt;&lt;br&gt;* "Some patients have troubles finding appropriate words, or give very simplified descriptions (e.g. feeling of warmth rising in the body, “rising in the head, like bubbles in the head”"&lt;ref&gt;Markus Gschwind and Fabienne Picard (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;* "Patients in the HYG more often reported actual experiences of some external being and an awareness of that being. This was described as either an evil or a great spiritual presence, and was associated with feelings of death and dying and an overwhelming feeling of fear. Such phenomenology is akin to the verbal reports from many patients with postictal psychoses. There is not just an awareness of the presence, but also an identification of this other essence. There is also the contrast between, on one hand, almost ecstasy (a miraculous event) and the experience of the presence of a great figure and, on the other hand, the more ominous feelings of fear, death, and punishment."&lt;ref&gt;"Michael Trimble, Anthony Freeman (2006), ''An investigation of religiosity and the Gastaut–Geschwind syndrome in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy'', Epilepsy &amp; Behavior 9 (2006) 407–414&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;* "In a tonic seizure, the body, arms, or legs may be suddenly stiff or tense."&lt;ref&gt;Epilepsy Foundation, [https://www.epilepsy.com/learn/types-seizures/tonic-seizures ''Tonic Seizures'']&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In one of his rare written comments on this process Ramana Maharshi wrote, "Enquiring within ''Who is the seer?'' I saw the seer disappear leaving That alone which stands forever. No thought arose to say ''I saw''. How then could the thought arise to say ''I did not see''."&lt;ref group=web name="autogenerated2"&gt;[http://www.davidgodman.org/rteach/jd1.shtml An Introduction to Sri Ramana's Life and Teachings. David Godman talks to John David]&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in life, he called his death experience ''akrama mukti'', "[[Subitism|sudden liberation]]," as opposed to the ''krama mukti'', "gradual liberation" as in the Vedanta path of [[jnana yoga]].&lt;ref group=web name="deathexp2" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|Rama P. Coomaraswamy: "[Krama-mukti is] to be distinguished from jîvan-mukti, the state of total and immediate liberation attained during this lifetime, and videha-mukti, the state of total liberation attained at the moment of death."{{sfn|Coomaraswamy|2004}} See &lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.swami-krishnananda.org/realis/realis_6a.html Swami Krishnananda, ''The Attainment of Liberation: Progressive Salvation]&lt;/ref&gt; for more info on "gradual liberation".}} It resulted in a state of mind which he later described as "the state of mind of Iswara or the jnani:"&lt;ref group=web name="deathexp1" /&gt;
{{quote|After reading the language of the sacred books, I see it may be termed suddha manas [pure mind], akhandakara vritti [unbroken experience], prajna [true knowledge] etc.; that is, the state of mind of Iswara or the jnani."&lt;ref group=web name="deathexp1" /&gt;}}

After this event, he lost interest in school studies, friends, and relations. He was absent-minded at school, "imagining and expecting God would suddenly drop down from Heaven before me".&lt;ref group=web name="deathexp2" /&gt; Avoiding company, he preferred to sit alone, absorbed in concentration on this current or force,{{sfn|Osborne|2002|p=13}} and went daily to the Meenakshi Temple, ecstatically devoted to the images of the 63 Nayanars and of [[Nataraja]], wanting "the same grace as was shown to those saints,"&lt;ref group=web name="deathexp2" /&gt; praying that he "should have the same bhakti that they had"&lt;ref group=web name="deathexp2" /&gt; and "[weeping] that God should give me the same grace He gave to those saints".&lt;ref group=web name="deathexp2" /&gt;{{sfn|Osborne|2002}}{{refn|group=note|Sudden conversion, following after epipletic seizures, is also described in the [[Geschwind syndrome]]: "... the transformation of the personality brought about by TLE, in that for some it seemed to magnify or give rise to a preoccupation with religious or philosophical matters."&lt;ref&gt;Teresa Sheppard, [http://www.assap.ac.uk/newsite/articles/Temporal%20lobe%20epilepsy.html ''Temporal Lobe Epilepsy and the Paranormal'']&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Knowing his family would not permit him to become a sanyassin and leave home, Venkataraman slipped away, telling his brother he needed to attend a special class at school.{{sfn|Sri Ramanasramam|1981}} Venkataraman boarded a train on 1 September 1896 and traveled to Tiruvannamalai where he remained for the rest of his life.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

===Tiruvannamalai temples (1896–1899)===
[[File:Tiruvannamalai Arunachaleswara temple.jpg|410px|thumb| [[Arunachaleswara Temple]], [[Tiruvannamalai]]]]

====Arunachaleswara temple (1896–1897)====
On arriving in [[Tiruvannamalai]], Maharshi went to the [[Arunachaleswara Temple|temple of Arunachaleswara]].{{sfn|Osborne|2002|p=30}} The first few weeks he spent in the thousand-pillared hall, then shifted to other spots in the temple, and eventually to the Patala-lingam vault so that he might remain undisturbed. There, he spent days absorbed in such deep [[samādhi]] that he was unaware of the bites of vermin and pests. [[Seshadri Swamigal]], a local saint, discovered him in the underground vault and tried to protect him.{{sfn|Sri Ramanasramam|1981}} After about six weeks in the Patala-lingam, he was carried out and cleaned up. For the next two months he stayed in the Subramanya Shrine, so unaware of his body and surroundings that food had to be placed in his mouth or he would have starved.

====Gurumurtam temple (1897–1898)====
In February 1897, six months after his arrival at Tiruvannamalai, Ramana moved to Gurumurtam, a temple about a mile away.{{sfn|Osborne|2002|p=35}} Shortly after his arrival a sadhu named Palaniswami went to see him.{{sfn|Osborne|2002|p=31}} Palaniswami's first [[Darśana|darshan]] left him filled with peace and bliss, and from that time on he served Ramana as his permanent attendant. Besides physical protection, Palaniswami would also beg for alms, cook and prepare meals for himself and Ramana, and care for him as needed.{{sfn|Osborne|2002|p=36}} In May 1898 Ramana moved to a mango orchard next to Gurumurtam.{{sfn|Osborne|2002|p=37}}

Osborne wrote that during this time Ramana completely neglected his body.{{sfn|Osborne|2002|p=36}} He also ignored the ants which bit him incessantly.{{sfn|Osborne|2002|p=35}} Gradually, despite Ramana's desire for privacy, he attracted attention from visitors who admired his silence and austerities, bringing offerings and singing praises. Eventually a bamboo fence was built to protect him.{{sfn|Osborne|2002|p=35}}

While living at the Gurumurtam temple his family discovered his whereabouts. First, his uncle Nelliappa Iyer came and pleaded with him to return home, promising that the family would not disturb his ascetic life. Ramana sat motionless and eventually his uncle gave up.{{sfn|Sadhu Om|2005}}

In September, 1898 Ramana moved to the Shiva-temple at Pavalakkunru, one of the eastern spurs of Arunachala. He refused to return even though his mother begged him to.{{sfn|Sri Ramanasramam|1981|p=34}}

===Arunachala (1899–1922)===
[[File:A view of Thiruvanamalai Mountain..jpg|left|325px|thumb| [[Arunachala|Arunachala Hill]], [[Tiruvannamalai]]]]
Soon after this, in February 1899, Ramana left the foothills to live on Arunachala itself.{{sfn|Ebert|2006|p=71}} He stayed briefly in Satguru Cave and Guhu Namasivaya Cave before taking up residence at Virupaksha Cave for the next 17 years, using Mango Tree cave during the summers, except for a six-month period at Pachaiamman Koil during the plague epidemic.{{sfn|Natarajan|2006|p=27-29}}

In 1902, a government official named Sivaprakasam Pillai, with writing slate in hand, visited the young Swami in the hope of obtaining answers to questions about "How to know one's true identity". The fourteen questions put to the young Swami and his answers were Ramana's first teachings on [[Self-enquiry]], the method for which he became widely known, and were eventually published as ''Nan Yar?'', or in English, ''Who am I?''.{{sfn|Ramana Maharshi|1982}}

Many visitors came to him and some became his devotees. [[Ganpati Muni|Kavyakantha Sri Ganapati Sastri]],{{refn|group=note|Literally, "One who has poetry in his throat."}} a Vedic scholar of repute in his age, with a deep knowledge of the Srutis, Sastras, Tantras, Yoga, and Agama systems, but lacking the personal ''[[Darśana|darshan]]'' of Shiva,{{sfn|Bhikshu|2012|p=ch.22}} came to visit Ramana in 1907. After receiving ''upadesa'' from him on self-enquiry, he proclaimed him as [[Bhagavan]] Sri Ramana [[Maharshi]]. Ramana was known by this name from then on.{{sfn|Sadhu Om|2005|p=15}} Ganapati Sastri passed on these instructions to his own students, but later in life confessed that he had never been able to achieve permanent Self-abidance. Nevertheless, he was highly valued by Ramana Maharshi and played an important role in his life.{{sfn|Bhikshu|2012|p=ch.22}}

In 1911 the first westerner, Frank Humphreys, then a police officer stationed in India, discovered Ramana and wrote articles about him which were first published in ''The International Psychic Gazette'' in 1913.{{sfn|Osborne|2002|p=106, 111}}{{refn|group=note|See [http://www.arunachala.org/elibrary/docs/glimpses/ Frank H. Humphreys, ''Glimpses of the Life and Teachings of Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi''] for Humphreys writings on Ramana Maharshi.}}

In an appendix to ''Self realisation'' Narasimha wrote that in 1912, while in the company of disciples, Ramana had an [[Temporal Lobe Epilepsy|epileptic fit]], in which his vision was suddenly impaired three times by a "white bright curtain" which covered a part of his vision. At the third instance his vision was shut out completely, while his "head was swimming," and he felt his heart stop beating and his breathing seizing, while his skin turned blue, as if he was dead. This lasted for about ten or fifteen minutes, whereafter "a shock passed suddenly through the body," and his blood circulation and his respiration returned.{{sfn|Narasimha|1993|p=268-269}} In response to "strange accounts" about this event, he later said that it was a [[Temporal lobe epilepsy|fit]], which he used to have occasionally, and did not bring on himself.{{sfn|Narasimha|1993|p=269}} According to Osborne, it "marked the final completion of Sri Bhagavan’s return to full outer normality".{{sfn|Osborne|2002|p=60-62}}

In 1916 his mother Alagammal and younger brother Nagasundaram joined Ramana at Tiruvannamalai and followed him when he moved to the larger Skandashram Cave, where Bhagavan lived until the end of 1922. His mother took up the life of a ''[[sannyasin]]'' and Ramana began to give her intense, personal instruction, while she took charge of the Ashram kitchen. Ramana's younger brother, Nagasundaram, then became a ''sannyasi'', assuming the name Niranjanananda, becoming known as Chinnaswami (the younger Swami).

During this period, Ramana composed ''The Five Hymns to Arunachala'', his magnum opus in devotional lyric poetry. The first hymn is ''Akshara Mana Malai''.{{refn|group=translation|[http://www.ramana-maharshi.org/music/arunsiva.htm Marital Garland of Letters]}} It was composed in Tamil in response to the request of a devotee for a song to be sung while wandering in the town for alms. The Marital Garland tells in glowing symbolism of the love and union between the human soul and God, expressing the attitude of the soul that still aspires.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Starting in 1920, his mother's health deteriorated. She died on 19 May 1922 while Ramana sat beside her.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}
[[File:Sri-Ramana-Sramam.jpg|right|450px|thumb| The Entrance of [[Sri Ramana Ashram|Sri Ramanasramam]].]]

===Sri Ramanasramam (1922–1950)===
====Commencement of Ramanasramam (1922-1930)====
From 1922 until his death in 1950 Ramana lived in [[Sri Ramana Ashram|Sri Ramanasramam]], the ashram that developed around his mother's tomb.{{sfn|Ebert|2006|p=107-114}} Ramana often walked from Skandashram to his mother's tomb. In December 1922 he did not return to Skandashram, and settled at the base of the Hill, and Sri Ramanasramam started to develop. At first, there was only one hut at the ''samadhi'', but in 1924 two huts, one opposite the ''samadhi'' and the other to the north, were erected. The so-called Old Hall was built in 1928. Ramana lived there until 1949.{{sfn|Ebert|2006|p=109}}

Sri Ramanasramam grew to include a library, hospital, post-office and many other facilities. Ramana displayed a natural talent for planning building projects. Annamalai Swami gave detailed accounts of this in his reminiscences.{{sfn|Godman|1998}} Until 1938, Annamalai Swami was entrusted with the task of supervising the projects, and received his instructions from Ramana directly.

Sri Ramana led a modest and renunciate life. However, according to David Godman, who has written extensively about Ramana, a popular image of him as a person who spent most of his time doing nothing except sitting silently in samadhi is highly inaccurate. From the period when an Ashram began to rise around him after his mother arrived, until his later years when his health failed, Ramana was actually quite active in Ashram activities such as cooking and stitching leaf plates.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.davidgodman.org/rteach/jd3.shtml An Introduction to Sri Ramana's Life and Teachings. David Godman talks to John David. Page 3]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Discovery by westerners (1930-1940)====
In 1931 a biography of Ramana Maharshi, ''Self Realisation: The Life and Teachings of Ramana Maharshi'', written by B. V. Narasimha, was published.{{sfn|Ebert|2006|p=140}} Ramana then became relatively well known in and out of India after 1934 when [[Paul Brunton]], having first visited Ramana in January 1931, published the book ''A Search in Secret India''.{{sfn|Brunton|1994}} In this book he describes how he was compelled by the [[Paramacharya]] of Kanchi to meet Ramana Maharshi, his meeting with Ramana Maharshi, and the effect this meeting had on him. Brunton also describes how Ramana's fame had spread, "so that pilgrims to the temple were often induced to go up the hill and see him before they returned home."{{sfn|Brunton|1994|p=289}} Brunton calls Ramana "one of the last of India's spiritual supermen,"{{sfn|Brunton|1994|p=301}} and describes his affection toward Ramana:
{{quote|I like him greatly because he is so simple and modest, when an atmosphere of authentic greatness lies so palpably around him; because he makes no claims to occult powers and hierophantic knowledge to impress the mystery loving nature of his countrymen; and because he is so totally without any traces of pretension that he strongly resists every effort to canonize him during his lifetime.{{sfn|Brunton|1994|p=302}}}}

While staying at Sri Ramanasramam, Brunton had an experience of a "sublimely all-embracing" awareness,{{sfn|Brunton|1994|p=304-305}} a "Moment of Illumination".{{sfn|Brunton|1994|p=310}} The book was a best-seller, and introduced Ramana Maharshi to a wider audience in the west.{{sfn|Ebert|2006|p=140}} Resulting visitors included [[Paramahansa Yogananda]], [[Somerset Maugham]] (whose 1944 novel ''[[The Razor's Edge]]'' models its spiritual guru after Ramana),&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://davidgodman.org/rteach/smaugham.shtml David Godman (1988), ''Somerset Maugham and The Razor's Edge'', The Mountain Path, 1988, pp. 239–45]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mercedes de Acosta]] and [[Arthur Osborne (writer)|Arthur Osborne]], the last of whom was the first editor of ''[[Mountain Path]]'' in 1964, the magazine published by Ramanasramam.

====Final years (1940-1950)====
[[File:Ramana Mahanirvana Place in Thiruvanamalai.jpg|thumb|right|Sri Ramana Maharshi Mahanirvana in [[Sri Ramana Ashram|Ramanasramam]]]]

In November 1948, a tiny cancerous lump was found on Ramana's arm and was removed in February 1949 by the ashram's doctor. Soon, another growth appeared, and another operation was performed by an eminent surgeon in March 1949 with radium applied. The doctor told Ramana that a complete amputation of the arm to the shoulder was required to save his life, but he refused. A third and fourth operation were performed in August and December 1949, but only weakened him. Other systems of medicine were then tried; all proved fruitless and were stopped by the end of March when devotees gave up all hope. To devotees who begged him to cure himself for the sake of his followers, Ramana is said to have replied, "Why are you so attached to this body? Let it go," and "Where can I go?

==Devotion==
[[File:Sri Ramana Maharshi - Lying - G. G Welling - 1948.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Sri Ramana Maharshi reclining in the Old Hall where he lived from 1927 to 1950]]

Ramana Maharshi was, and is, regarded by many as an outstanding enlightened being.{{sfn|Forsthoefel|2005|p=38}} He was a charismatic person,{{sfn|Sivaramkrishna|2008|p=16}}{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=43}} and attracted many devotees, some of whom saw him as an [[avatar]] and the embodiment of Shiva.

===''Darshan'' and ''prasad''===
{{Main article|Darśana|Prasad}}
{{See also|Guru|Sadguru|Charismatic authority|Shaktipat}}

Many devotees visited Ramana Maharshi for ''darshan'',{{sfn|Osborne|2002|p=139}} the sight of a holy person or God incarnate, which is advantageous and transmits merit.{{sfn|Flood|2011|p=194}}{{sfn|Hinduism Today|2007|p=149-151}} According to Flood, in Indian religions the guru is akin to the image or statue of a deity in the temple, and both possess power and a sacred energy.{{sfn|Flood|2011|p=194}} According to Osborne, Ramana Maharsi regarded giving darshan as "his task in life," and said that he had to be accessible to all who came.{{sfn|Osborne|2002|p=139}} Even during his terminal illness at the end of his life, he demanded to be approachable for all who came for his ''darshan''.{{sfn|Osborne|2002|p=139}}

Objects being touched or used by him were highly valued by his devotees, "as they considered it to be ''[[prasad]]'' and that it passed on some of the power and blessing of the [[Guru]] to them".{{sfn|Ebert|2006|p=152-153}} People also tried to touch his feet,{{sfn|Ebert|2006}} which is also considered ''darshana''.{{sfn|Hinduism Today|2007|p=151-152}} When one devotee asked if it would be possible to prostrate before Sri Ramana and touch his feet, he replied:
{{quote|The real feet of Bhagavan exist only in the heart of the devotee. To hold onto these feet incessantly is true happiness. You will be disappointed if you hold onto my physical feet because one day this physical body will disappear. The greatest worship is worshipping the Guru's feet that are within oneself.{{sfn|Godman|1994}}}}

In later life, the number of devotees and their devotion grew so large that Ramana became restricted in his daily routine.{{sfn|Ebert|2006|p=124-125}} Measures had to be taken to prevent people touching him.{{sfn|Ebert|2006|p=125}} Several times Ramana tried to escape from the ashram, to return to a life of solitude. Vasudeva reports: "Bhagavan sat on a rock and said with tears in his eyes that he would never again come to the Ashram and would go where he pleased and live in the forests or caves away from all men."{{sfn|Ebert|2006|p=126}}

Ramana did return to the ashram, but has also reported himself on attempts to leave the ashram:
{{quote|I tried to be free on a third occasion also. That was after mother's passing away. I did not want to have even an Ashram like Skandashram and the people that were coming there then. but the result has been this Ashram [Ramanashram] and all the crowd here. Thus all my three attempts failed.{{sfn|Ebert|2006|p=126}}}}

===Avatar===
Some of Ramana Maharshi's devotees regarded him to be as [[Dakshinamurthy]];{{sfn|Frawley|1996|p=92-93}}{{sfn|Paranjape|2009|p=57-58}} as an [[avatar]] of [[Kartikeya|Skanda]], a [[Ishvara|divine form]] of Shiva popular in Tamil Nadu; as an incarnation of [[Sambandar|Jnana Sambandar]], one of the sixty-three Nayanars; and as an incarnation of [[Kumārila Bhaṭṭa]], the 8th century Mimamsa-philosopher. According to Krishna Bhikshu, one of his early biographers:{{quote|As Kumarila he established the supremacy of the karma marga, as Jnana Sambandar, a poet, he brought bhakti marga close to the people and as Ramana he showed that the purpose of life was to abide in the Self and to stay in the sahaja state by the jnana marga.{{sfn|Bhikshu|2004|p=ch.49}}}}

==Spiritual instruction==
[[File:Sri Ramana Maharshi - Sitting - G. G Welling - 1948.jpg|right|thumb| Ramana Maharshi sitting in the Old Hall at [[Sri Ramana Ashram|Sri Ramanasramam]]]]

Ramana Maharshi provided ''[[Upadesa|upadeśa]]'' ("spiritual instruction"){{sfn|Osborne|1959}} by providing [[Darśana|darshan]] and [[Satsang|sitting silently together with devotees and visitors]], but also by answering the questions and concerns raised by those who sought him out. Many of these question-and-answer sessions have been transcribed and published by devotees, some of which have been edited by Ramana Maharshi himself. A few texts have been published which were written by Ramana Maharshi himself, or written down on his behalf and edited by him.

Ramana Maharshi also provided an example by his own devotion to Shiva, which has been extensively described by his devotees, such as walks around the holy hill Arunachala, in which devotees participated, and his hymns to Arunachala.

===''Self''===
{{See also|Brahman|Prakasa}}

Ramana Maharshi described his Self as a "force" or "current," which descended on him in his death-experience, and continued throughout his life:
{{quote|... a force or current, a centre of energy playing on the body, continuing regardless of the rigidity or activity of the body, though existing in connection with it. It was that current, force or centre that constituted my Self, that kept me acting and moving, but this was the first time I came to know it [...] I had no idea at that time of the identity of that current with the personal God, or [[Ishvara|Iswara]] as I used to call him [...] I was only feeling that everything was being done by the current and not by me [...] This current, or avesam, now felt as if it was my Self, not a superimposition [...] That avesam continues right up to now.&lt;ref group=web name="deathexp1"/&gt;}}

Ramana used various terms to denote this Self.{{refn|group=note|According to David Godman, each term signifies a different aspect of "the same indivisible reality".{{sfn|Godman|1985|p=7}}}} The most frequently used terms were ''[[satchitananda|sat-chit-ananda]]'', which translates into English as "being-consciousness-bliss";{{sfn|Godman|1985|p=13}} [[God]], [[Brahman]] and [[Shiva|Siva]],{{refn|group=note|According to David Godman, Ramana would use these terms not to refer to a personal God, but to the "formless being which sustains the universe".{{sfn|Godman|1985|p=7}}}} and [[Aham (Kashmir Shaivism)|the Heart]], which is not to be confused with the physical heart, or a particular point in space, but was rather to indicate that "the Self was the source from which all appearances manifested".{{sfn|Godman|1985|p=7}}

According to David Godman, the essence of Ramana Maharshi's teachings is that the "Self" or real "I" is a "non-personal, all-inclusive awareness": {{sfn|Godman|1985|p=12}} 
{{quote|The real ''Self'' or real 'I' is, contrary to perceptible experience, not an experience of individuality but a non-personal, all-inclusive awareness. It is not to be confused with the individual self which (Ramana) said was essentially non-existent, being a fabrication of the mind, which obscures the true experience of the real ''Self''. He maintained that the real ''Self'' is always present and always experienced but he emphasized that one is only consciously aware of it as it really is when the self-limiting tendencies of the mind have ceased. Permanent and continuous Self-awareness is known as Self-realization.{{sfn|Godman|1985|p=12}}}}

Ramana considered the Self to be permanent and enduring,{{sfn|Venkataramiah|2000|p=463}} surviving physical death.{{sfn|Venkataramiah|2000|p=308}} "The sleep, dream and waking states are mere phenomena appearing on the Self,"{{sfn|Venkataramiah|2000|p=462}} as is the "I"-thought.{{sfn|Venkataramiah|2000|p=463}} Our "true nature" is "simple Being, free from thoughts".{{sfn|Venkataramiah|2000|p=467}}

Ramana would field many questions about ''jnanis'' ("liberated beings") from devotees, but even the terms ''jnani'' and ''ajnani'' (non-liberated being) are incorrect, since it leads one to the idea of there being a knower and a known, a subject and an object. The truth of it according to Ramana Maharshi is that there are neither ''jnanis'' nor ''ajnanis'', there is simply ''jnana'', which is Self:{{sfn|Godman|1985|p=51-52}}
{{quote|The jnani sees no one as an ajnani. All are only jnanis in his sight. In the ignorant state one superimposes one's ignorance on a jnani and mistakes him for a doer. In the state of ''jnana'', the jnani sees nothing separate from the ''Self''. The ''Self'' is all shining and only pure ''jnana''.{{sfn|Godman|1985|p=60}}}}

===Silence===
{{See also|Vimalakirti Sutra}}
Ramana's main means of instruction to his devotees in order to remove ignorance and abide in Self-awareness was through [[Silence#In spirituality|silently]] [[Satsang|sitting together]] with his visitors, &lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.sriramanamaharshi.org/teachings.html Sr Ramanashram, ''Teachings''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003022425/http://sriramanamaharshi.org/teachings.html |date=3 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Ebert|2006|p=211-213}} using words only sparingly.{{sfn|Ebert|2006|p=144}} His method of instruction has been compared to [[Dakshinamurti]] - [[Shiva]] in the ascetic appearance of the [[Guru]], who teaches through silence:
{{quote|One evening, devotees asked Sri Ramana to explain the meaning of Shankara's [[Dakshinamurthy Stotram|hymn in praise of Dakshinamurti]]. They waited for his answer, but in vain. The Maharishi sat motionless on his seat, in total silence.{{sfn|Ebert|2006|p=212}}}}
Commenting upon this silence Ramana said:
{{quote|Silence is the true ''upadesa''. It is the perfect ''upadesa''. It is suited only for the most advanced seeker. The others are unable to draw full inspiration from it. Therefore, they require words to explain the truth. But truth is beyond words; it does not warrant explanation. All that is possible is to indicate It. How is that to be done?{{sfn|Venkatramaiah|2000|p=433}}}}

===Self-enquiry===
{{See also|Self-enquiry|Jnana Yoga|Vicara|Hua Tou|Pointing-out instruction|Subitism|Choiceless awareness|Shikantaza|Shentong|Sahaja|Turiya}}

''[[Vichara]]'', "[[Self-enquiry]]", also called ''[[Atman (Hinduism)|ātma]]-[[Vichara|vichār]]'' or ''jnana-vichara''{{sfn|Sadhu Om|2005|p=136}} is the constant attention to the inner awareness of "I" or "I am".

[[Robert K. C. Forman|Robert Forman]] notes that Ramana Maharshi made a distinction between ''[[samadhi]]'' and ''[[sahaja samadhi]]''. ''Samadhi'' is a contemplative state, which is temporary, while in ''sahaja samadhi'' a "silent state" is maintained while engaged in daily activities.{{sfn|Forman|1999|p=6}} Ramana Maharshi himself stated repeatedly that ''samadhi'' only suppresses the ''[[vāsanā]]s'', the karmic impressions, but does not destroy them. Only by abiding in Self-awareness will the ''vāsanās'', which create the sense of a separate self, be destroyed, and ''sahaja samadhi'' be attained.{{refn|group=note|The distinction, made by [[Walter Terence Stace]], between "introvertive mysticism" and "extrovertive mysticism," is at the heart of the contemporary debates on [[mysticism]] and [[mystical experience]]. Whereas Stace regarded these two forms as different forms of mysticism, Forman sees them as developmental stages. Forman also notes that "the first experience of ''samadhi'' [by Ramana] preceded ''sahaja samadhi'' by several years".{{sfn|Forman|1999|p=45, note 27}} See also [[Kenshō#Training after kenshō|Training after kenshō]].}}

===Bhakti===
{{Main article|Bhakti|Bhakti movement}}

Although he advocated self-enquiry as the fastest means to realisation, he also recommended the path of ''[[bhakti]]'' and self-surrender (to one's deity or guru) either concurrently or as an adequate alternative, which would ultimately converge with the path of self-enquiry.{{sfn|Sadhu Om|2005-B}}

Surrender has to be complete and desireless, without any expectations of solutions or rewards, or even liberation. It is a willingness to accept whatever happens.&lt;ref group=web name="surrender"&gt;[http://ramana-maharshi.weebly.com/the-unity-of-surrender-and-self-enquiry.html David Godman, ''The unity of surrender and Self-enquiry'']&lt;/ref&gt; Surrender is not the willful act of an individual self, but the growing awareness that there is no individual self to surrender. Practice is aimed at the removal of ignorance, not at the attainment of realisation.&lt;ref group=web name="surrender" /&gt;

{{quote|Bhagavan: There are only two ways to conquer destiny or to be independent of it. One is to inquire whose this destiny is and discover that only the ego is bound by it and not the Self and that the ego is non-existent. The other way is to kill the ego by completely surrendering to the Lord, realizing one’s helplessness and saying all the time: “Not I, but Thou, oh Lord,” giving up all sense of “I” and “mine” and leaving it to the Lord to do what He likes with you. Surrender can never be regarded as complete so long as the devotee wants this or that from the Lord. True surrender is the love of God for the sake of love and nothing else, not even for the sake of salvation. In other words, complete effacement of the ego is necessary to conquer destiny, whether you achieve this effacement through Self-inquiry or through bhakti-marga.&lt;ref&gt;[https://satramana.org/web/bookstore/sat-publications/self-realization/ "Self-Realization" {{ISBN|978-0-9819409-5-3}}]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Reincarnation===
According to David Godman, Ramana Maharshi taught that the idea of reincarnation is based on wrong ideas about the individual self as being real. Ramana Maharshi would sometimes say that rebirth does exist, to step forward to those who were not able to fully grasp the non-reality of the individual self. But when this illusoriness is realised, there is no room any more for ideas about reincarnation. When the identification with the body stops, any notions about death and rebirth become inapplicable, since there is [[Ajativada|no birth or death]] within Self.{{sfn|Godman|1985}} Ramana Maharshi:
{{quote|Reincarnation exists only so long as there is ignorance. There is really no reincarnation at all, either now or before. Nor will there be any hereafter. This is the truth.{{sfn|Godman|1985}}}}

==Background==

===Indian spirituality===
{{See also|Siddha|Rishi|Orientalism|Neo-Vedanta|Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Perennial Philosophy}}
According to Wehr, [[C. G. Jung]] noted that Ramana Maharshi is not to be regarded as an "isolated phenomenon,"{{sfn|Wehr|2003}} but as a token of Indian spirituality, "manifest in many forms in everyday Indian life".{{sfn|Wehr|2003}}{{refn|group=note|Jung wrote the foreword to [[Heinrich Zimmer]]'s ''Der Weg zum Selbst'', "The Path to the Self" (1944),{{sfn|Wehr|2003}} an early collection of translations of Ramana's teachings in a western language.}} According to Zimmer and Jung, Ramana's appearance as a ''[[Rishi Muni|mauni]]'', a silent saint absorbed in ''samadhi'', fitted into pre-existing Indian notions of holiness.{{sfn|Zimmer|1948|p=53-55}}{{sfn|Jung|1948|p=226-228}} They placed the Indian devotion toward Ramana Maharshi in this Indian context.{{sfn|Jung|1948|p=226-228}}{{sfn|Wehr|2003}}{{refn|group=note|Michaels uses [[Pierre Bourdieu|Bourdieu's]] notion of [[habitus (sociology)|habitus]] to point to the power of "culturally acquired lifestyles and attitudes, habits and predispositions, as well as conscious, deliberate acts or mythological, theological, or philosophical artifacts and mental productions"{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=7}} in his understanding of Hinduism.}} 

According to Alan Edwards, the popular image of Ramana Maharshi as a timeless saint also served the construction of an Indian identity as inner-oriented and spiritual, in opposition to the oppressive, outer-oriented, materialistic culture of the British colonial rulers:{{sfn|Edwards|2012|p=98-99}}
{{quote|Hindus from all over India could look to the purely spiritual Maharshi as a symbol that inspired them to preserve their distinctive national culture and identity, which of course entailed forcing the British to quit India.{{sfn|Edwards|2012|p=99}}{{refn|group=note|Edwards notes the pervading influence of western [[Orientalism]] on the perception of Ramana Maharshi, even in western scholarship, which tends to favour this picture of the timeless guru: "...scholarship can misinterpret and misrepresent religious figures because of the failure to recognise the presence of [Orientalist stereotypes] and assumptions, and also because of the failure to maintain critical distance when dealing with the rhetoric of devotional literature".&lt;ref group=web name="Newsletter"&gt;[http://www.nzasia.org.nz/downloads/newsletter22.pdf New Zealand Asian Studies Society Inc, Newsletter No. 22, May 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; See also {{Citation | last =King | first =Richard | year =2002 | title =Orientalism and Religion: Post-Colonial Theory, India and "The Mystic East" | publisher =Routledge}}, and [[Zen Narratives]] for a similar romantisation of Zen and its archetypal [[Rōshi]].}}}}

===Shaivism===
{{Main article|Shaiva Siddhanta|Kaula (Hinduism)|Siddha}}
Though Ramana's answers explain and incorporate elements from Advaita Vedanta, his spiritual life is strongly associated with [[Shaivism]]. The Tamil compendium of devotional songs known as ''[[Tirumurai]]'', along with the [[Veda]]s, the Shaiva [[Āgama (Hinduism)|Agamas]] and ''"Meykanda"'' or ''"[[Siddhanta]]"'' [[Shastras]], form the scriptural canon of Tamil Shaiva Siddhanta.{{sfn|Arulsamy|1987|p=1}} As a youth, prior to his awakening, Ramana read the [[Periya Puranam]], the stories of the [[Nayanars|63 Tamil saints]].{{sfn|Narasimha|1993|p=17}} In later life, he told those stories to his devotees:
{{quote|When telling these stories, he used to dramatize the characters of the main figures in voice and gesture and seemed to identify himself fully with them.{{sfn|Ebert|2006|p=147}}}}

Ramana himself considered God, Guru and Self to be the manifestations of the same reality.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.arunachala.org/ramana/teachings/#ndx-7 arunachala.org, ''The Teachings of Sri Ramana Maharshi'']&lt;/ref&gt; Ramana considered the Self to be his guru, in the form of the sacred mountain [[Arunachala]],{{sfn|Cornille|1992|p=83}}{{sfn|Poonja|2000|p=59}} which is considered to be the manifestation of [[Shiva]].{{sfn|Godman|1985|p=2}}{{sfn|Cornille|1992|p=83}} Arunachala is one of the five main shaivite holy places in South India,{{sfn|Singh|2009}} which can be worshipped through the mantra "Om arunachala shivaya namah!"{{sfn|Frawley|2000|p=121-122}} and by [[Pradakshina]], walking around the mountain, a practice which was often performed by Ramana.{{sfn|Cornille|1992|p=83}} Asked about the special sanctity of Arunachala, Ramana said that Arunachala is Shiva himself.{{sfn|Venkataramiah|1936|p=Talk 143}}{{refn|group=note|Shankara saw Arunchala as [[Mount Meru]], which is in Indian mythology the axis of the world, and the abode of [[Brahman]] and the gods.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/376478/Mount-Meru Encyclopædia Britannica, ''Mount Meru'']&lt;/ref&gt;}} In his later years, Ramana said it was the spiritual power of Arunachala which had brought about his Self-realisation.{{sfn|Godman|1985|p=2}} He composed the ''Five Hymns to Arunachala'' as devotional song.{{sfn|Cornille|1992|p=83}} On the three occasions Venkataraman (Ramana) referred to himself he used the name ''Arunachala Ramana''.{{sfn|Ganesan|p=9}} Ramana Maharshi also used to smear his forehead with holy ash, as a token of veneration.

In later life, Ramana himself came to be regarded as [[Dakshinamurthy]],{{sfn|Frawley|1996|p=92-93}}{{sfn|Paranjape|2009|p=57-58}} an aspect of Shiva as a [[guru]] of all types of knowledge, and bestower of [[jnana]]. This aspect of [[Shiva]] is his personification as the supreme or the ultimate awareness, understanding and knowledge.{{sfn|Dallapiccola|2002}} This form represents Shiva in his aspect as a teacher of [[yoga]], music, and wisdom, and giving exposition on the shastras.

===Acquaintance with Hindu scriptures===
{{See also|Scriptures|Vedas|Upanishads|Bhagavad Gita|Hindu texts|List of Hindu scriptures}}
During his lifetime, through contact with educated devotees like Ganapata Muni,{{sfn|Ebert|2006|p=147}} Ramana Maharshi became acquainted with works on Shaivism and Advaita Vedanta, and used them to explain his insights:{{sfn|Narasimha|1993|p=24}}
{{quote|People wonder how I speak of ''Bhagavad Gita'', etc. It is due to hearsay. I have not read the ''Gita'' nor waded through commentaries for its meaning. When I hear a ''sloka'' (verse), I think its meaning is clear and I say it. That is all and nothing more.{{sfn|Venkataramiah|2000|p=315}}}}

Already in 1896, a few months after his arrival at Arunachala, Ramana attracted his first disciple, Uddandi Nayinar,{{sfn|Ebert|2006|p=45-46}} who recognised in him "the living embodiment of the Holy Scriptures".{{sfn|Ebert|2006|p=46}} Uddandi was well-versed in classic texts on Yoga and Vedanta, and recited texts as the ''Yoga Vasistha'' and ''Kaivalya Navaneeta'' in Ramana's presence.{{sfn|Ebert|2006|p=46}}

In 1897 Ramana was joined by Palaniswami, who became his attendant.{{sfn|Ebert|2006|p=51-52}} Palaniswami studied books in Tamil on Vedanta, such as ''Kaivalya Navaneeta'', Shankara's ''Vivekachudamani'', and ''Yoga Vasistha''. He had difficulties understanding Tamil. Ramana read the books too, and explained them to Palaniswami.{{sfn|Ebert|2006|p=53}}

As early as 1900, when Ramana was 20 years old, he became acquainted with the teachings of the Hindu monk and [[Advaita Vedanta#Neo-Vedanta|Neo-Vedanta]]{{sfn|Mukerji|1983}}{{sfn|King|1999}} teacher [[Swami Vivekananda]] through Gambhiram Seshayya. Seshayya was interested in yoga techniques, and "used to bring his books and explain his difficulties".{{sfn|Ebert|2006|p=77}} Ramana answered on small scraps of paper, which were collected after his death in the late 1920s in a booklet called ''Vichara Sangraham'', "Self-enquiry".{{sfn|Ebert|2006|p=77}}

One of the works that Ramana used to explain his insights was the [[Shivarahasya Purana#Ribhu Gita|Ribhu Gita]], a song at the heart of the [[Shivarahasya Purana]], one of the 'Shaiva [[Upapuranas]]' or ancillary [[Purana]] regarding [[Shiva]] and [[Shaivite]] worship. Another work used by him was the [[Dakshinamurthy Stotram]], a text by Shankara.{{sfn|Ebert|2006|p=147}} It is a hymn to Shiva, explaining Advaita Vedanta.

Ramana gave his approval to a variety of paths and practices from various religions,{{sfn|Godman|1985}} with his own upadesa (instruction or guidance given to a disciple by his Guru)&lt;ref group=web name="PathGlossary"&gt;[http://benegal.org/ramana_maharshi/books/pos/pos019.html#Upadesa Arthur Osborne, ''Ramana Maharshi and the Path of Self-Knowledge. Glossary''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502194248/http://benegal.org/ramana_maharshi/books/pos/pos019.html |date=2 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; always pointing to the true ''Self'' of the devotees.{{sfn|Zimmer|1948|p=192}}

===Advaita Vedanta===
[[File:Raja Ravi Varma - Sankaracharya.jpg|thumb| [[Adi Shankara]] with Disciples, by [[Raja Ravi Varma]] (1904)]]
{{See also|Advaita Vedanta|Vedanta|Jivanmukta}}

In contrast to classical Advaita Vedanta, Ramana emphasized the personal experience of self-realization, instead of philosophical argumentation and the study of scripture.{{sfn|Davis|2010|p=48}} Ramana's authority was based on his personal experience,{{sfn|Davis|2010|p=48}} from which he explained classic texts on Yoga and Vedanta,{{sfn|Narasimha|1993|p=24}}{{sfn|Venkataramiah|2000|p=315}} which he came acquainted with via his devotees.{{sfn|Ebert|2006}}{{sfn|Zimmer|1948}} Arvind Sharma qualifies Ramana Maharshi as the chief exponent of ''experiential Advaita'', to distinguish his approach from Shankara's classical ''doctrinal Advaita''.{{sfn|Sharma|1993|p=xiv}} Fort classifies him as a [[Neo-Vedanta|neo-Vedantin]], because of the focus on self-inquiry instead of philosophical speculation.{{sfn|Davis|2010|p=48}} Ramana himself did not call his insights advaita, but said that ''dvaita'' and ''advaita'' are relative terms, based on a sense of duality, while the Self or Being is all there is.{{sfn|Venkataramiah|2000|p=328-329}}

Although Ramana's teaching is consistent with and generally associated with [[Hinduism]], the [[Upanishads]] and [[Advaita Vedanta]], there are differences with the traditional Advaitic school. Advaita recommends a negationist ''neti, neti'' ([[Sanskrit]], "not this", "not this") path, or mental affirmations that the Self is the only reality, such as "I am Brahman" or "I am He", while Ramana advocated Self-enquiry ''Nan Yar''. In contrast with traditional Advaita Vedanta, Ramana Maharshi strongly discouraged devotees from adopting a renunciate lifestyle and renouncing their responsibilities. To one devotee who felt he should abandon his family, whom he described as "samsara" ("illusion"), to intensify his spiritual practice, Sri Ramana replied:
{{quote|Oh! Is that so? What really is meant by samsara? Is it within or without? Wife, children and others. Is that all the samsara? What have they done? Please find out first what really is meant by samsara. Afterwards we shall consider the question of abandoning them.{{sfn|Letters from Sri Ramanasramam|1973}}}}

With regard to the [[Sri Ramana Ashram]], in 1938 Maharshi made a legal will bequeathing all the Ramanashram properties to his younger brother Niranjanananda and his descendants. In 2013, Ramanashram is run by Sri Niranjananda's grandson Sri V.S. Raman. Ramanashram is legally recognised as a public religious trust whose aim is to maintain it in a way that is consistent with Sri Ramana's declared wishes. The ashram should remain open as a spiritual institution so that anyone who wishes to can avail themselves of its facilities.{{sfn|Osborne2002|p=ch.12}}&lt;ref group=web&gt;http://sri-ramana-maharshi.blogspot.hk/2011/07/curious-court-case.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s, Maharshi's teachings were brought to the west by [[Paul Brunton]] in his ''A Search in Secret India''.{{sfn|Lucas|2011|p=99}}{{refn|group=note|Brunton had been a member of the [[Theosophical Society]], which searched for ancient wisdom in the east, and the Society was a major force in the exposure of the west to Asian spirituality.{{sfn|Sinari|2000}}{{sfn|Lavoie|2012}} One of its salient features was the belief in [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom (Theosophy)|"Masters of Wisdom"]].{{sfn|Gilchrist|1996|p=32}} The Theosophical Society also spread western ideas in the east, aiding a modernisation of eastern traditions, and contributing to a growing nationalism in the Asian colonies.{{sfn|McMahan|2008}} The Theosophical Society had a major influence on [[Buddhist modernism]]{{sfn|McMahan|2008}} and [[Hindu reform movements]],{{sfn|Sinari|2000}} and the spread of those modernised versions in the west.{{sfn|McMahan|2008}} The [[Theosophical Society]] and the [[Arya Samaj]] were united from 1878 to 1882, as the [[Theosophical Society of the Arya Samaj]].{{sfn|Johnson|1994|p=107}} Along with [[Henry Steel Olcott|H.

W. L. Poonja]] have been instrumental in,{{sfn|Lucas|2011|p=94}} and which gives a western re-interpretation of his teachings placing sole emphasis on insight alone. It has been criticised for this emphasis, omitting the preparatory practices.{{sfn|Lucas|2014}}{{refn|group=note|See also [http://www.enlightened-spirituality.org/neo-advaita.html Timothy Conway, ''Neo-Advaita or Pseudo-Advaita and Real Advaita-Nonduality'']}} Nevertheless, Neo-Advaita has become an important constituent of popular western [[spirituality]].{{sfn|Lucas|2011|p=109}}

==Works==
===Writings===
According to Ebert, Ramana "never felt moved to formulate his teaching of his own accord, either verbally or in writing". The few writings he is credited with "came into being as answers to questions asked by his disciples or through their urging". Only a few hymns were written on his own initiative.{{sfn|Ebert|2006|p=78}} Writings by Ramana are:
* Gambhiram Sheshayya, ''Vichāra Sangraham'', "Self-Enquiry". Answers to questions, compiled in 1901, published in dialogue-form, republished as essay in 1939 as ''A Cathechism of Enquiry''. Also published in 1944 in Heinrich Zimmer's ''Der Weg zum Selbst''.{{sfn|Renard|1999|p=19-20}}
* Sivaprakasam Oillai, ''Nān Yār?'', "Who am I?". Answers to questions, compiled in 1902, first published in 1923.{{sfn|Renard|1999|p=19-20}}&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.sriramanamaharshi.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/who_am_I.pdf Who am I? – pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Five Hymns to Arunachala:
** ''Akshara Mana Malai'', "The Marital Garland of Letters". In 1914, at the request of a devotee, Ramana wrote ''Akshara Mana Malai'' for his devotees to sing while on their rounds for alms. It's a hymn in praise of Shiva, manifest as the mountain Arunachala. The hymn consists of 108 stanzas composed in poetic Tamil.&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite web|author=Self Inquiry |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7SKi-9HrJE |title=Sri Ramana Maharshi's Aksharamanamalai.m4v |publisher=YouTube |date=19 June 2012 |accessdate=4 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** ''Navamani Mālai'', "The Necklet of Nine Gems".
** ''Arunāchala Patikam'', "Eleven Verses to Sri Arunachala".
** ''Arunāchala Ashtakam'', "Eight Stanzas to Sri Arunachala".
** ''Arunāchala Pañcharatna'', "Five Stanzas to Sri Arunachala".
* Sri Muruganar and Sri Ramana Maharshi, ''Upadesha Sāra (Upadesha Undiyar)'', "The Essence of Instruction". In 1927 Muruganar started a poem on the Gods, but asked Ramana to write thirty verses on ''upadesha'', "teaching" or "instruction".{{sfn|Renard|1999|p=24}}
* Ramana Maharshi, ''Ulladu narpadu'', "Forty Verses on Reality". Written in 1928.{{sfn|Renard|1999|p=25}} First English translation and commentary by S.S. Cohen in 1931.
* ''Ullada Nārpadu Anubandham'', "Reality in Forty Verses: Supplement". Forty stanzas, fifteen of which are being written by Ramana. The other twenty-five are translations of various Sanskrit-texts.{{sfn|Renard|1999|p=26}}
* Sri Muruganar and Sri Ramana Maharshi (1930s), ''Ramana Puranam''.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://davidgodman.org/rteach/ramanapuranam.shtml Ramana Puranam]&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Ekātma Pañchakam'', "Five Verses on the Self". Written in 1947, at the request of a female devotee.{{sfn|Renard|1999|p=27}}

All these texts are collected in the ''Collected Works''.

===Recorded talks===
Several collections of recorded talks, in which Sri Ramana used Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam,{{sfn|Godman|1985}} have been published. Those are based on written transcripts, which were "hurriedly written down in English by his official interpreters".{{sfn|Godman|1985}}{{refn|group=note|David Godman: "Because some of the interpreters were not completely fluent in English some of the transcriptions were either ungrammatical or written in a kind of stilted English which occasionally makes Sri Ramana sound like a pompous Victorian."{{sfn|Godman|1985}}}}
* Sri Natanananda, ''Upadesa Manjari'', "Origin of Spiritual Instruction". Recordings of dialogues between Sri Ramana and devotees. First published in English in 1939 as ''A Catechism of Instruction''.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[https://satramana.org/ExcerptOriginOfSpiritualInstruction.pdf Society of Abidance in Truth, ''Origin of Spiritual Instruction'']&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Penance and Reconciliation}}
'''''Reconciliatio et paenitentia''''' (Latin for '''Reconciliation and Penance''') is an [[apostolic exhortation]] by [[Pope John Paul II]], delivered on 2 December 1984 in [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] in [[Rome]], which grew out of the Sixth General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops held in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;[http://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/apost_exhortations/documents/hf_jp-ii_exh_02121984_reconciliatio-et-paenitentia.html Pope John Paul II. ''Reconciliatio et paenitentia'', §4, December 2, 1984, Libreria Editrice Vaticana]&lt;/ref&gt; The third of John Paul II's apostolic exhortations, it presents Jesus as the Reconciler of a shattered world.

==Structure==
John Paul II began the exhortation by recalling from the [[Gospel of Mark]] {{bibleverse-nb||Mark|1:15|NIV}}, the very words with which [[Jesus]] began his preaching: "''Repent, and believe in the Gospel''". Building on that theme, the pope addressed "reconciliation and penance in the mission of the Church today". Continuing his teaching on the mystery of Redemption, the pope presented Jesus as the Reconciler of a shattered world and urged the Church and the world to rediscover the path of penance, the only path that can lead to full reconciliation.&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;Pope John Paul II. ''The post-synodal apostolic exhortations of John Paul II'' (J. Michael Miller, ed.) Our Sunday Visitor Publishing, 1998 {{ISBN|0-87973-928-2}} pages 234-237&lt;/ref&gt;

The exhortation has three parts, as well as an introduction and conclusions. The introduction discusses the modern world's divisions and difficulties. It stresses the inherent desire of humanity for reconciliation. The first chapter discusses the fact that the mission of the Church remains the conversion of hearts.

The second part is titled: "The Love That is Greater than Sin" and singles out sin as the cause of the wounds that individuals inflict on themselves, on God and their neighbors. It discusses the personal and social dimensions of sin. The third chapter discusses the means by which the Church fosters penance, reconciliation and healing, returning to the theme of Mark 1:15: "''Repent, and believe in the Gospel''".

The final part includes a call for unity and conversion of hearts. The teachings on structural sin in this exhortation were also later discussed in the pope's 1987 encyclical [[Sollicitudo rei socialis]].

==Content==
The pope used the [[parable of the prodigal son]] to explain the process of conversion and reconciliation, and that [[God the Father]] is "rich in mercy" and always ready to forgive. "Reconciliation is principally a gift of the heavenly Father,"{{sfn|Reconciliatio et paenitentia, §5}} and an initiative on his part. He observes that the older brother also needs to be converted from his selfishness and jealousy. Each person is both the prodigal son and the older brother, both in need of reconciliation.&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt;

John Paul describes sin as "...the disobedience of a person who, by a free act, does not acknowledge God's sovereignty over his or her life, at least at that particular moment in which he or she transgresses God's law,"{{sfn|Reconciliatio et paenitentia, §14}} and it is sin which is ultimately the cause of all divisions and conflicts within human society. The exhortation also discussed John Paul II's view of "structural sin". The pope insists on sin as a free personal act. He views "social sin" in three ways: first that personal sin has social effects, second, that some sins directly affect the neighbor, and third that social sin refers to relationships between human communities. The pope rejected the separation and contrasting of personal and social sin in a way that leads to the dilution and eventual abolition of personal sin, and the substitution of social guilt and responsibility in its place.&lt;ref&gt;''The moral theology of Pope John Paul II'' by Charles E. Curran 2005 {{ISBN|1-58901-042-6}} page 82&lt;/ref&gt;

He concurs with [[Pope Pius XII]]'s statement that "the sin of the century is the loss of the sense of sin,"{{sfn|Reconciliatio et paenitentia, §18}} and reaffirms the Church's teaching on the distinction between mortal and venial sins. He deplores a view that all failings are blamed upon society, and the individual is declared innocent of them, or which so emphasizes environmental and historical conditioning and their influences that it reduces man's responsibility to the point of not acknowledging his ability to perform truly human acts and therefore his ability to sin.{{sfn|Reconciliatio et paenitentia, §18}}

'''Riccardo Pozzo''' (born June 7, 1959 in [[Milan]]) is an Italian [[philosopher]] and historian of philosophy.

==Biography==
Graduated in philosophy at the [[University of Milan]] in 1983, Riccardo Pozzo was a disciple of [[Mario Dal Pra]], [[Wilhelm Risse]], and [[Norbert Hinske]]. He received his Ph.D. in 1988 at [[Saarland University]] and Habilitation in 1995 at [[University of Trier]]. In 1996 he went to the U.S. to teach Kant and Hegel at the School of Philosophy of CUA in Washington, D.C. In 2003 he came back to Italy to take up the chair of the History of Philosophy at [[Università di Verona]].
 
From 2009 to 2012 he succeeded to [[Tullio Gregory]] at the direction of the [http://iliesi.cnr.it Institute for the European Intellectual Lexicon and History of Ideas at the National Research Council of Italy]. Since 2013 he has been directing the Department of Social Sciences and Humanities, Cultural Heritage of the National Research Council of Italy. In 2012 he was elected a member of the [[Institut International de Philosophie]].

[[Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany]] on ribbon, he is currently serving as expert of the [[Horizon 2020]] Program Committee Configuration Research Infrastructures, member of the Scientific Review Group for the Humanities of the European Science Foundation, and chairman of the 24th World Congress of Philosophy Program Committee, organized by the [[Fédération Internationale des Sociétés de Philosophie]] in Beijing 2018.

==Research==
Historian of Philosophy and author of monographs on Aristotelianism, the history of logic (from the Renaissance to [[Kant]] and [[Hegel]]), the history of ideas and the history of universities, Pozzo has pushed forward the creation of research infrastructures for an enhanced comprehension of philosophical and scientific texts that have shaped the cultural heritage of mankind. Specific characteristic of Pozzo’s approach to lexicography during his tenure at the Institute for the [http://iliesi.cnr.it European Intellectual Lexicon and History of Ideas] is the use of IT for linguistic and textual data documentation and elaboration in Ancient Greek, English, French, German, Latin, and Italian.

In recent years Pozzo has been considering possibilities and limits of an intercultural history of philosophy. According to him today, intellectual history and philosophy hardly talk to each other. The subjects are nonetheless the same ones: thought and its history. Therefore he promotes an intercultural model to the history of philosophy, which begins from a critical consideration of this nonspeaking. In his books and articles he puts forward examples of corpora of philosophical texts that talk to each other, which is a new trend made possible by the advances of state-of-the-art lexicography. With migration among the key issues at the top of public and academic agendas worldwide a re-consideration is urgent of the migrant practices of transfer of organizing principles and conditions for developing competences to act in multicultural settings, and ideas, which—as [[Arthur O. Lovejoy]] used to say—are the most migratory things in the world.

The '''Schlesinger Institute''' for Medical-Halachic Research was founded in Israel in 1966 under the auspices of [[Shaare Zedek Medical Center]]. It is named after the hospital's second director-general. The Institute is dedicated to the [[Halacha|halachic]] (Jewish law) approach to [[medical ethics]], and has the purpose of researching and resolving the halachic issues that emerge as medicine progresses, to consider their [[medicine|medical]], halachic, [[legal]] and [[ethics|ethical]] ramifications, and to present practical responses. Leading [[rabbi]]s, [[physicians]] and others, consider and respond to issues, with the intention of following the spirit of [[Torah]].
==Principal activities==
The Schlesinger Institute offers religious and academic programs in Jewish medical ethics involving prominent Jewish medical ethicists to diverse audiences and student groups. Among these programs are a thirty-hour semester course at the [[Hadassah Medical Center|Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical School]], summer and winter seminars for medical and nursing students from abroad, lectures and tours of Shaare Zedek for [[yeshiva]] and [[seminary]] students, and one-day seminars on selected topics for Israeli high school pupils.

==Publications==
A number of books and journals on [[Jewish medical ethics]] are available through the Schlesinger Institute.

===Journals===
The Schlesinger Institute publishes two journals, [[Assia (magazine)|ASSIA]] in [[Hebrew]] and [[Jewish Medical Ethics ()|JME]] in English. Both journals cover[[Medicine|medical]] and [[ethics|ethical]] problems, solutions and ethical thought processes of rabbis and doctors who have dealt with these problems.

Articles published in the journals deal with a variety of topics, including: scientific, legal, ethical and halachic aspects of [[cloning]], determining time of [[death]], [[heart transplantation]], [[truth-telling]] to the dangerously ill [[patient]], halachic and medical aspects of the [[AIDS]] [[virus]], [[psychiatry]] and halacha, the selling of organs, the cessation of medical treatment and [[euthanasia]], initial counseling for a juvenile with [[Homosexuality and Judaism|homosexual urges]], [[smoking]] and life expectancy, coercive medical treatment, the [[surrogate mother]], medical dilemmas of [[hospital]] [[nurses]] and halachic principles connected to the obligation to save human life.

===Encyclopedia of Jewish Medical Ethics===
'''By [[Avraham Steinberg]], M.D.'''

Medical practice from the point of view of halacha and Jewish thought, covering sources from scripture through the whole of ancient, medieval, and modern rabbinic literature. Systematic surveys of related medical, scientific, philosophical, ethical, and legal material, with thousands of references.

Articles in the Encyclopedia cover a wide range of topics both for the medical professional and the patient. It combines halachic principles and medical knowledge, with full references for both. It includes medical, scientific, philosophical, ethical, and legal material, from scripture and Talmud through to the most recent sources.

The articles include: [[Parent|Paternity]], [[Suicide]], [[Autonomy]] and [[Free Will]], Hospitals, [[Genetics]], [[Religion and Science]], [[Consent]], [[Abortions]], [[IVF]], [[Organ Transplantation]], Conflict of Halacha and Science, [[Old Age]], The Patient, [[Embalming]], [[Malpractice]], [[Pain]], [[Kashrut]] and [[Shabbat]], [[Birth]], Medical Education, Human [[Human sexuality|Sexuality]], Limited Resources, Medical Experimentation on Humans, [[Surgery]], [[Confidentiality]], [[Fertility]], [[Lifesaving]], Causing Pain to Animals, [[Triage]], Defining Death, Physicians, and General and Jewish Ethics.

===Nishmat Abraham===
'''By [[A.S. Abraham]], M.D., F.R.C.P''' 

Published as four-volume set, the Nishmat Avraham on Medical Halacha consists of new responsa and new medical halachic rulings. The Nishmat Abraham is a commentary on the four sections of the Shulchan Aruch with detailed references from the Talmud through [[Rishonim]] and [[Acharonim]]. It covers thousands of rulings from halachic literature, including  up-to-date material from contemporary authorities all over the world such as [[Moshe Feinstein|Rav M. Feinstein]], [[Shlomo Zalman Auerbach|Rav Sh.Z. Auerbach]], [[Eliezer Waldenberg|Rav Waldenberg]], [[Yosef Sholom Eliashiv|Rav Eliashiv]], [[Ovadia Yosef|Rav Ovadia Yosef]], Rav Wosner and [[Yehoshua Neuwirth|Rav Neuwirth]].

Problems are covered as far-ranging as the doctor and patient on weekdays and Shabbat, Yom Kippur and Pesach, in the hospital or at home, hospice, end of life and brain death, pregnancy and assisted reproduction, contraception and abortion, brit milah and the medical problems of niddah, [[medical malpractice]] and claims, genetic engineering and cloning, DNA and stem cells, AIDS and herpes, the threatened doctor and the psychiatric patient, Hatzalah and preventive medicine and their attendant problems in halacha.
The views of leading authorities are comprehensively summarized on each point, covering nearly every issue in medical halacha. It has extensive indices.
===Additional books===
The institute published other books including:

* Halachot for the Physician and for the patient on the Sabbath and Festivals (English and Hebrew)
* Collections of essays and proceedings from the International Colloquiums on Medicine, Ethics and Jewish Law (English and Hebrew) 
* The Comprehensive Guide to Medical Halacha (English)
* [http://www.medethics.org.il/articles/FIC/15.pdf New Horizens in Jewish Medical Ethics] (English)
* Establishing the moment of death (Hebrew)
* Medicine and Halacha - practical aspects (Hebrew)

==International Responsa Project (IRP)==
When a medical procedure raises ethical or moral issues that are in contradiction with halacha, the International Responsa Project is considered to be a reliable rabbinical authority. People all over the world send the Schlesinger Institute questions, some of a general, theoretical nature and some of a very specific, technical nature. The questions are answered by one of the rabbi-doctors at the Institute, or, in special cases, by a recognized rabbinical authority.

==The Chaim Kahn Library and Information Center==
The Library and Information Center is one of the main resource centers for Jewish medical ethics in Israel. All the standard texts of the Jewish library can be found there, as well as compendiums of halacha, medical and Jewish journals, and legal texts. Computer facilities, a database of Jewish sources, and a bibliography of the library are available to the public. The information center is named after [[Chaim Kahn]], the first chairman of the institute.

==International conferences==
Contributions to the halachic approach to medical or ethical questions are made at the international conferences organized by the Schlesinger Institute. These conferences bring together rabbis, doctors, and others from around the world for lectures by experts on contemporary medical halachic issues. Conference proceedings and background materials have been published in both English and Hebrew.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10201">'''Scott F. Aikin''' (born 1971) is an American philosopher, Assistant Professor of Philosophy at [[Vanderbilt University]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], where he also holds a joint appointment in Classics. He earned an M.A. in Philosophy from the University of Montana in 1999 and a Ph.D. in Philosophy from Vanderbilt University in 2006. His principal areas of research are [[epistemology]], [[argumentation theory]], [[ancient philosophy]], and [[pragmatism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Contemporary authors|last=|first=|publisher=Gale|year=2013|isbn=|volume=328|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
===Epistemology===
Aikin's work in epistemology is devoted to the elaboration and defense of two views: [[evidentialism]] and epistemic [[infinitism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wku.edu/scholar/documents/spring2009/2009_ethicalcommunication.pdf|title=Pennavaria, Katherine "Ethical Communication}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  His case for evidentialism is articulated in his Evidentialism and the Will to Believe, in which he defends [[William Kingdon Clifford]]'s version of evidentialism against [[William James]]'s critiques. Clifford holds in "The Ethics of Belief" that "It is wrong always, everywhere, and for anyone, to believe anything upon insufficient evidence." James denies this, claiming that cases of faith – particularly those in which belief in a truth can help bring about the truth – are exceptional. Replying on behalf of Clifford, Aikin argues that such cases are not exceptions, because knowledge that one's belief in a proposition makes that proposition more likely to be true amounts to evidence for that proposition. 
Aikin has also contributed to the public debate about the ethics of belief in religious contexts, in Reasonable Atheism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chapter16.org/content/moral-not-faithful|title=Griffith, Paul "Moral, Not Faithful"}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aikin's case for epistemic infinitism, developed in Epistemology and the Regress Problem, holds that given the requirement that all reasons must have backing, the only options for rational belief are either skepticism or infinite, non-repeating chains of justifying reasons. In "Prospects for Moral Epistemic Infinitism," Aikin argues that these are also requirements of moral knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/meta.12071/abstract|title=Aikin, Scott (2014) "Prospects for Moral Epistemic Infinitism." Metaphilosophy. 45 (2): 172-181.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Argumentation Theory===
Aikin is a proponent of the epistemic theory of argument, according to which the primary norms of argumentation are those that promote the communication of knowledge. His central argument for this view is that it uniquely precludes an absurdity that arises on the alternatives. Namely, the possibility that one may be convinced by an argument, yet know no more after the argument than before. Aikin further argues that the main competitor theories of argument are either self-refuting or implicitly epistemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://dialnet.unirioja.es/descarga/articulo/3963404.pdf.|title= Aikin, Scott (2011) "The Rhetorical Theory of Argument is Self-Defeating." Cogency. 3(1): 79-92.}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work in theory of argument has led Aikin to develop a program of expansive fallacy theory. Aikin poses an analysis of ad hominem [[tu quoque]] arguments that establishes the conditions for determining relevance of hypocrisy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://ojs.uwindsor.ca/ojs/leddy/index.php/informal_logic/article/view/543.|title= Aikin, Scott (2008) "Tu Quoque Arguments and the Significance of Hypocrisy" Informal Logic. 28(2).}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has (with Robert Talisse and John Casey) proposed a variety of [[straw man]] fallacies: the representational (straw) man, the selectional (weak) man, the hollow man, and the iron man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/380/art%253A10.1007%252Fs10503-006-9017-8.pdf?originUrl=http%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2Fs10503-006-9017-8&amp;token2=exp=1457646686~acl=%2Fstatic%2Fpdf%2F380%2Fart%25253A10.1007%25252Fs10503.|title= Talisse, Robert and Aikin, Scott (2008) "Two Forms of the Straw Man" Argumentation 20: 345-352.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://philpapers.org/rec/AIKSMW|title= Aikin, Scott and Casey, John (2011) "Straw Men, Weak Men, and Hollow Men" Argumentation 25: 87-105.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Aikin and Talisse have proposed a fallacy of ridicule they term "modus tonens," which consists in repeating an interlocutor's claim with an incredulous tone of voice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://philpapers.org/rec/AIKSMW|title= Aikin, Scott and Talisse, Robert (2008) "Modus Tonens" Argumentation. 22: 521-529.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Aikin also defends, along with [[Trudy Govier]], the minimally adversarial theory of argument. This view acknowledges that, argumentation, as an act of addressing controversy, must have an essential adversarial component, but maintains that this adversariality must not be permitted to escalate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/par/summary/v044/44.3.aikin.html|title= Aikin, Scott (2011) "A Defense of War and Sport Metaphors in Argument" Philosophy and Rhetoric. 44(3): 250-72.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Aikin, in Why We Argue, offers an introduction to argumentation theory for the context of public political debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wyplfmbooktalk.blogspot.com/2014/01/podcast-robert-talisse-and-scott-aikin.html|title=Usery, Stephen "Book Talk"}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an author, he has been collected by libraries worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n2008014923/ |title=Aikin, Scott F. |publisher=worldcat.org |accessdate=October 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Philosophy===
Aikin's work in ancient philosophy focuses primarily on knowledge and its connection to the good life in the ancient world.  Of particular interest are Xenophanes, the Academic Skeptics, and the Stoics.  With Xenophanes, Aikin argues that the famous contrary to fact conditional "if horses had had hands and drew their gods, they would look like horses" is an enthymatic argument against self-serving representations of the divine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11841-015-0476-y#/page-1.|title= Aikin, Scott (2016) "So What if Horses Would Draw Horse Gods?" Sophia.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://philpapers.org/rec/AIKXTH|title= Aikin, Scott (2014) "Xenophanes the High Rationalist" Epoche. 19(1) 1-14.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aikin's work on the skeptics has focused on the variety of arguments offered for the skeptical viewpoint. In particular, Aikin has argued that the Academics' "Argument from Second Place" is a unique positive epistemic argument for skepticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.academia.edu/34402293/Ciceronian_Academic_Skepticism_Augustinian_Anti-Skepticism_and_the_Argument_from_Second_Place.|title= Aikin, Scott (2017) "Ciceronian Academic Skepticism, Augustinian Anti-Skepticism, and the Argument from Second Place" Ancient Philosophy 37.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, Academic epistemology, Aikin has argued, is well-placed to dovetail with republican political views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.pdcnet.org/pdc/bvdb.nsf/purchase?openform&amp;fp=symposion&amp;id=symposion_2015_0002_0003_0275_0285&amp;onlyautologin=true|title= Aikin, Scott (2015) "Citizen Skeptic: Cicero's Academic Republicanism" Symposion. 2(3) 275-285.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pragmatism===
Aikin is a proponent of the [[neo-pragmatist]] movement in American philosophy.  This movement is posited on the view that there is a fecund interplay between the methods and language of analytic philosophy, and the aspirations of pragmatism.  In ''Pragmatism: A Guide for the Perplexed,'' Aikin and Talisse argue that the insights of classical pragmatism can be seen to merge with the analytic program, which gives rise to a number of important research agendas – particularly in epistemology, metaphysics, ethics, and political philosophy. Along with Talisse, Aikin has argued that pragmatism and moral pluralism are in tension, and hence that pragmatists cannot be pluralists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/transactions_of_the_charles_s_peirce_society/v041/41.1.talisse.html|title= Talisse, Robert and Aikin, Scott (2005) "Why Pragmatists Can't Be Pluralists" Transactions of the Charles S. Peirce Society  41(1).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bust of Sir William Hamilton, by William Brodie, Old College, University of Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|Bust of Sir William Hamilton, by [[William Brodie (sculptor)|William Brodie]], [[Old College, University of Edinburgh]]]]
'''Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet''' [[FRSE]] [[Doctor of Divinity|DD]] FSAS (8 March 1788 – 6 May 1856) was a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[metaphysics|metaphysician]]. He is often referred to as '''William Stirling Hamilton''' of Preston, in reference to his mother, Elizabeth Stirling.

==Early life==
He was born in rooms at the [[University of Glasgow]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He was from an academic family, his younger brother being [[Robert Hamilton (economist)|Robert Hamilton]], the economist. His father [[William Hamilton (physician)|Professor William Hamilton]], had in 1781, on the strong recommendation of [[William Hunter (anatomist)|William Hunter]], been appointed to succeed his own father, Dr Thomas Hamilton, as [[Regius Professor of Anatomy, Glasgow]]; and when he died in 1790, aged 32, he had already gained a great reputation. William Hamilton and his younger brother, [[Thomas Hamilton (writer)|Thomas Hamilton]], were brought up by their mother.

William received his early education at [[High School of Glasgow|Glasgow Grammar School]], except for two years which he spent in a private school at Chiswick in [[Kent]],&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1807 went as a [[Snell Exhibitioner]], to [[Balliol College, Oxford]]. He obtained a first class in ''literis humanioribus'' and took his BA in 1811 (MA 1814). He had been intended for the medical profession, however soon after leaving Oxford he gave up this idea, and in 1813 became a member of the Scottish bar, as a qualified [[advocate]]. His life continued to be that of a student; and the years that followed were filled by researches of all kinds, while at the same time he was gradually forming his philosophic system. Investigation enabled him to make good his claim to represent the ancient family of Hamilton of Preston, and in 1816 he took up the [[baronetcy]], which had been in abeyance since the death of [[Robert Hamilton of Preston|Sir Robert Hamilton of Preston]] (1650–1701), well known in his day as a [[Covenanter|covenanting]] leader. He inspired many young adults.

==Early time as philosopher==
Two visits to Germany in 1817 and 1820 led to William's taking up the study of German and later on that of contemporary German philosophy, which was almost entirely neglected in British universities. In 1820 he was a candidate for the chair of moral philosophy in the [[University of Edinburgh]], which had fallen vacant on the death of [[Thomas Brown (philosopher)|Thomas Brown]], colleague of [[Dugald Stewart]], and Stewart's consequent resignation, however he was defeated on political grounds by [[John Wilson (Scottish writer)|John Wilson]], (1785–1854), the "Christopher North" of ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]''. In 1821 he was appointed professor of civil history, and delivered several courses of lectures on the history of modern Europe and the history of literature. The salary was £100 a year, derived from a local beer tax, and was discontinued after a time. No pupils were compelled to attend, the class dwindled, and Hamilton gave it up when the salary ceased. In January 1827 his mother, to whom he had been devoted, died. In March 1828 he married his cousin, Janet Marshall.

Around this time he moved to live in a recently built townhouse at 11 Manor Place, in Edinburgh's west end.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://digital.nls.uk/83400567|title=Edinburgh Post Office annual directory, 1832-1833|last=|first=|date=|website=National Library of Scotland|page=81|access-date=2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==

[[File:William Hamilton portrait.jpg|thumb|left|William Hamilton started his literary career in 1829 with the essay "Philosophy of the Unconditioned".]]

In 1829 his career of authorship began with the appearance of the well-known essay on the "Philosophy of the Unconditioned" (a critique of [[Victor Cousin]]'s ''Cours de philosophie'')--the first of a series of articles contributed by him to the ''[[Edinburgh Review]]''. He was elected in 1836 to the University of Edinburgh chair of logic and metaphysics, and from this time dates the influence which, during the next 20 years, he exerted over the thought of the younger generation in Scotland. Much about the same time he began the preparation of an annotated edition of [[Thomas Reid|Thomas Reid's]] works, intending to annex to it a number of dissertations. However before this design had been carried out, he was struck, in 1844, with paralysis of the right side which seriously crippled his bodily powers, though left his mind unimpaired.

The edition of Reid appeared in 1846, but with only seven of the intended dissertations, one unfinished. At his death he had still not completed the work; notes on the subjects to be discussed were found among his manuscripts. Considerably earlier, he had formed his theory of [[logic]], the leading principles of which were indicated in the prospectus of "an essay on a new analytic of [[logical form]]s" prefixed to his edition of Reid. But the elaboration of the scheme in its details and applications continued during the next few years to occupy much of his leisure. Out of this arose a sharp controversy with [[Augustus de Morgan]]. The essay did not appear, but the results of the labour gone through are contained in the appendices to his ''Lectures on Logic''.

Hamilton also prepared extensive materials for a publication which he designed on the personal history, influence and opinions of [[Martin Luther]]. Here he advanced so far as to have planned and partly carried out the arrangement of the work; but it did not go further, and still remains in manuscript. In 1852–1853 appeared the first and second editions of his ''Discussions in Philosophy, Literature and Education'', a reprint, with large additions, of his contributions to the ''[[Edinburgh Review]]''. Soon after, his general health began to fail. Assisted by his devoted wife, he persevered in literary labour; and during 1854–1855 he brought out nine volumes of a new edition of Stewart's works. The only remaining volume was to have contained a memoir of Stewart, but this he did not live to write. Hamilton was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1855.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter H|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterH.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He taught his class for the last time in the winter of 1855–1856. Shortly after the close of the session he was taken ill, and died in Edinburgh.

==Death==
[[File:The grave of Sir William Hamilton, St Johns Church, Princes Street.jpg|thumb|300px|The grave of Sir William Hamilton, St Johns Church, Princes Street]]

He died on 6 May 1856 and was buried in [[St John's Episcopal Churchyard]] at the east end of [[Princes Street]] in Edinburgh. The stone is not in its original location and is used to edge the enclosure at the east end of the church.

He had married Janet, the daughter of Hubert Marshall, and was succeeded by his son [[Sir William Stirling-Hamilton, 10th Baronet]], a general in the British Army. How did he die? No one knows@

==Place in thought==
In 1840 the [[University of Leyden]] granted him an honorary Doctor of Divinity (DD), a rarity for persons outwith the clergy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Hamilton's positive contribution to the progress of thought is comparatively slight, but he stimulated a spirit of criticism in his pupils by insisting on the great importance of [[psychology]] as opposed to the older metaphysical method, and by his recognition of the importance of German philosophy, especially that of [[Immanuel Kant]]. By far his most important work was "Philosophy of the Unconditioned," the development of the principle that for the human finite mind there can be no knowledge of the [[Infinity|Infinite]]. The basis of his argument is the thesis, "To think is to condition." Deeply impressed with Kant's antithesis between subject and object, the knowing and the known, Hamilton laid down the principle that every object is known only in virtue of its relations to other objects. From this it follows that limitless time, space, power, etc., are inconceivable. The fact, however, that all thought seems to demand the idea of the infinite or absolute provides a sphere for faith, which is thus the specific faculty of theology. It is a weakness characteristic of the human mind that it cannot conceive any phenomenon without a beginning: hence the conception of the causal relation, according to which every phenomenon has its cause in preceding phenomena, and its effect in subsequent phenomena. The causal concept is, therefore, only one of the ordinary necessary forms of the cognitive consciousness limited, as we have seen, by being confined to that which is relative.

As regards the problem of the nature of objectivity, Hamilton simply accepts the evidence of consciousness as to the separate existence of the object: "the root of our nature cannot be a lie." In virtue of this assumption Hamilton's philosophy becomes a "natural realism." In fact his whole position is a strange compound of Kant and Reid. Its chief practical corollary is the denial of philosophy as a method of attaining absolute knowledge and its relegation to the academic sphere of mental training. The transition from philosophy to theology, i.e. to the sphere of faith, is presented by Hamilton under the analogous relation between the mind and the body. As the mind is to the body, so is the unconditioned Absolute or God to the world of the conditioned. [[Consciousness]], itself a conditioned phenomenon, must derive from or depend on some different thing prior to or behind material phenomena. Curiously enough, however, Hamilton does not explain how it comes about that God, who in the terms of the analogy bears to the conditioned mind the relation which the conditioned mind bears to its objects, can be unconditioned. God can be regarded only as related to consciousness, and insofar is, therefore, not absolute or unconditioned. Thus the very principles of Hamilton's philosophy are apparently violated in his [[theology|theological]] argument.

Hamilton regarded logic as a purely formal science; it seemed to him an unscientific mixing together of heterogeneous elements to treat as parts of the same science the formal and the material conditions of knowledge. He was quite ready to allow that on this view logic cannot be used as a means of discovering or guaranteeing facts, even the most general, and expressly asserted that it has to do, not with the objective validity, but only with the mutual relations, of judgments. He further held that induction and deduction are correlative processes of formal logic, each resting on the necessities of thought and deriving thence its several laws. The only logical laws which he recognised were the three axioms of identity, noncontradiction, and excluded middle, which he regarded as severally phases of one general condition of the possibility of existence and, therefore, of thought. The law of reason and consequent he considered not as different, but merely as expressing metaphysically what these express logically. He added as a postulate—which in his theory was of importance--"that logic be allowed to state explicitly what is thought implicitly." in logic, Hamilton is known chiefly as the inventor of the doctrine of the "quantification of the predicate," i.e. that the judgment "All A is B " should really mean "All A is all B," whereas the ordinary universal proposition should be stated "All A is some B." This view, which was supported by [[William Stanley Jevons|Stanley Jevons]], is fundamentally at fault since it implies that the predicate is thought of in its extension; in point of fact when a judgment is made, e.g. about men, that they are mortal ("All men are mortal"), the intention is to attribute a quality (i.e. the predicate is used in connotation). In other words, we are not considering the question "what kind are men among the various things which must die?" (as is implied in the form "all men are some mortals") but "what is the fact about men?" We are not stating a mere identity (see further, e.g., [[H. W. B. Joseph]], ''Introduction to Logic'', 1906, pp.&amp;nbsp;198 foll.).

The philosopher to whom above all others Hamilton professed allegiance was Aristotle. His works were the object of his profound and constant study, and supplied in fact the mould in which his whole philosophy was cast. With the commentators on the [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] writings, ancient, medieval and modern, he was also familiar; and the scholastic philosophy he studied with care and appreciation at a time when it had hardly yet begun to attract attention in his country. His wide reading enabled him to trace many a doctrine to the writings of forgotten thinkers; and nothing gave him greater pleasure than to draw forth such from their obscurity, and to give due acknowledgment, even if it chanced to be of the prior possession of a view or argument that he had thought out for himself. Of modern German philosophy he was a diligent, if not always a sympathetic, student. How profoundly his thinking was modified by that of Kant is evident from the tenor of his speculations; nor was this less the case because, on fundamental points, he came to widely different conclusions.

Hamilton was more than a philosopher; his knowledge and interests embraced all subjects related to that of the human mind. He studied anatomy and physiology. He was also well-read in ancient and modern literature, being particularly interested in the 16th and 17th centuries. Among his literary projects were editions of the works of [[George Buchanan (humanist)|George Buchanan]] and [[Julius Caesar Scaliger]]. His general scholarship found expression in his library, which became part of the library of the University of Glasgow.

He also may have had influence upon subsequent philosophy as the inspiration for a critique by [[John Stuart Mill]] which resulted in perhaps the clearest statements ever of the idea of [[matter]] as the [[permanent possibility of sensation]].

==Education==
His chief practical interest was in education—an interest which he manifested alike as a teacher and as a writer, and which had led him long before he was either to a study of the subject both theoretical and historical. He thence adopted views as to the ends and methods of education that, when afterwards carried out or advocated by him, met with general recognition; but he also expressed in one of his articles an unfavourable view of the study of mathematics as a mental gymnastic, which excited much opposition, but which he never saw reason to alter. As a teacher, he was zealous and successful, and his writings on university organisation and reform had, at the time of their appearance, a decisive practical effect, and contain much that is of permanent value.

==Last works==
His posthumous works are his ''Lectures on Metaphysics and Logic'' (1860), 4 vols., edited by [[Henry Longueville Mansel|HL Mansel]], Oxford, and [[John Veitch (poet)|John Veitch]] (''Metaphysics''; ''Logic''); and ''Additional Notes to Reid's Works, from Sir W. Hamilton's Manuscripts.'', under the editorship of HL Mansel, D.D. (1862). ''A Memoir of Sir W. Hamilton'', by Veitch, appeared in 1869. [http://fin-laws.ru/lib/philosophy2.pdf ''Philosophy'']{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (1873).

Rosen was born in Cleveland, Ohio. He was a student of [[Leo Strauss]] at the [[University of Chicago]], where he defended his dissertation on [[Spinoza]] in 1955. He was also a student of [[Alexandre Kojève]]. He did his postdoctoral work at the American School of Classical Studies in Athens, and became Evan Pugh Professor of philosophy at [[Penn State University]] and then Borden Parker Bowne Professor of Philosophy at Boston University. He has held the Companys Lectureship at the [[University of Barcelona]], the Cardinal Mercier Lectureship at [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven|University of Leuven]], the Priestley Lectureship at the [[University of Toronto]], and the Gilson Lectureship at the Institut Catholique in Paris. He served as President of the [[Metaphysical Society of America]] in 1991.

Rosen's first two books, a study of [[Symposium (Plato)|Plato's ''Symposium'']] and ''Nihilism: A Philosophical Essay'', represent his abiding concerns. On the one hand he continuously returned to the roots of the philosophical tradition, in particular to Plato, and, on the other, he thought through modern and postmodern philosophy by confronting their most powerful representatives. The most notable feature of this engagement was the justice done to the two main strands of contemporary philosophy, the continental and analytic movements, represented by their most influential members, Heidegger and [[Wittgenstein]], as preparation for Rosen's criticism and positive proposals.

One of the central themes of Rosen's work is the claim that the extraordinary discourses of philosophy have no other basis than the intelligent understanding of the features of ordinary life or human existence. This theme was given an in-depth treatment in his 2002 work, ''The Elusiveness of the Ordinary''.

Rosen married his wife, Francoise, in 1955; they had three children and four grandchildren.

== Lionel Jospin ==
Agacinski met Jospin in 1983, at her sister Sophie's wedding. They married 11 years later. She stayed on the sidelines in Jospin's [[French presidential election, 1995|candidacy for president in 1995]], but was much more active in his [[French presidential election, 2002|candidacy for president in 2002]]. At that time she changed her name to Agacinski-Jospin to "bow to the will of the people", but continues to use her maiden name as a philosopher.&lt;ref name="NYT20020410"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/10/world/paris-journal-a-french-surprise-yes-candidates-have-wives.html?pagewanted=1 "Paris Journal; A French Surprise: Yes, Candidates Have Wives"], by Suzanne Daley, April 10, 2002, ''[[New York Times]]''. Retrieved Jan 19, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In the fall of 2002, after Jospin's surprise exclusion from the runoffs to [[Jacques Chirac]] and [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]], Agacinsky published ''Journal Interrompu'', a book about the election in diary form, blaming Chirac, the French media, and the [[French left]]'s internal rivalries.&lt;ref name=NYT20021002&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/02/news/02iht-politicus_ed3_.html?pagewanted=1 "Politicus : Portrait of Jospin in defeat:his wife's diary doesn't dish"], by John Vinocur, October 2, 2002, ''[[New York Times]]''. Retrieved Jan 19, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==
As a feminist philosopher, Agacinski is associated with "differentialism", an important strain of French feminism, which argues that the human condition cannot be understood in any universal way without reference to both sexes.&lt;ref name="NYT20040613"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/13/weekinreview/13cald.html?pagewanted=all "With Gay Marriage, La Belle France Turns Conservative"], by Christopher Caldwell, June 13, 2004, ''[[New York Times]]''.

The French Got Femininity Right"], by Judith Warner, ''[[Washington Post]]'', Sunday, June 3, 2001; Page B01. Retrieved Jan 19, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Parité'' amendment ===
In 1999, Agacinski was a leading originator of a bill to amend article three of the [[Constitution of France]] to include a phrase stating: "The law will encourage equal access for women and men to political life and elected posts."&lt;ref name=Guardian19990306&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/mar/06/women.politics "Boost to equality in French politics"], by Jon Henley, ''[[The Guardian]]'', 6 March 1999. Retrieved Jan 19, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; With Jospin's support, the so-called "''Parité''"("Parity") amendment was made on June 28, 1999, and was followed by a law, on May 3, 2000, obliging the country’s political parties to present 50% female candidacies in virtually any race, or lose a corresponding share of their governmental campaign funding.&lt;ref name=NewYorker&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2000/05/29/2000_05_29_112_TNY_LIBRY_000020938?currentPage=all "Liberty, Equality, Sorority"], by Jane Kramer, ''[[The New Yorker]]'', May 29, 2000.

== Scientific and teaching activities ==

According to numerous memoirs of her colleagues, T.A. Tarasenko was one of the first in the Soviet Union to develop and begin delivering lectures on the History of Russian 20th century philosophy. Thanks to her,  students of the university first got to know the works of [[Nikolai Berdyaev|Berdyaev]], [[Sergei Bulgakov|Bulgakov]], [[Ivan Ilyin|Ilyin]], [[Nikolay Lossky|Lossky]], [[Vasily Rozanov|Rozanov]], [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Solovyov]], [[Nikolai Fyodorovich Fyodorov|Fedorov]], [[Pavel Florensky|Florensky]], [[Georges Florovsky|Florovsky]], [[Semyon Frank|Frank]], [[Lev Shestov|Shestov]] et al. at that time kept in special depositories.&lt;ref name="FDSP" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Grebennik G.P 2010"&gt;Grebennik G.P. «The portrait of an intellectual in the Odessa interior.Story about Tamara Andreevna Tarasenko and not only about her».  — Odessa: Phoenix, 2010. — 176 p. — {{ISBN|978-966-438-215-8}}  (Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; In her lectures and seminars T. A. Tarasenko  practiced the method of the famous Soviet philosopher Genrikh S. Batishchev (1932-1990) - a "deep dialogue", a dialogue that involves not only  mind but also conscience, a moral component of the personality of her students.&lt;ref name="FDSP" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Grebennik G.P 2010"/&gt;

In her teaching activities she had a genuine respect to students' dignity, thinking and personal traits of character. She  came to help in need, showing sensitivity to the inner world of a young man.&lt;ref name="FDSP" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Grebennik G.P 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4UHUiSYFgc Ilya Reyderman «An usual odessa Intellectual»] (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, being seriously ill and suffering from pain, she carried on teaching, delivering lectures and seminars. She considered it her duty to complete the course of lectures for the Law faculty students.&lt;ref name="FDSP" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Grebennik G.P 2010"/&gt;

== Memory ==
[[File:Портрет Интеллигента.JPG|thumb]]
Died on May 23, 1992, buried in the North Cemetery of Odessa.&lt;ref name="FDSP" /&gt;

The memory  of T. A. Tarasenko was engraved in the book by the Odessa State University professor Gennady P. Grebennik "Intellectual Portrait in Odessa Interior. A Story about Tamara Tarasenko, and not only about her".&lt;ref name="Grebennik G.P 2010"/&gt; G. Grebennik wrote:

“She lived next to us, but the secret of her existence was hidden from us. She was the only person I have encountered on my way who practiced a great, now vanished, tradition in Philosophy - the tradition of Socrates. She was a philosopher in the true sense of the word, because her purpose was not to discover  formal scientific laws, but life itself in the harmony of all its aspects. Such is the mystery of her life, revealed to us after her death.”

At the request of the Fund the artist Lazar L. Gormakh (1924-2000) wrote in pastel a portrait of T. A. Tarasenko, displayed in the Fund along with the portraits of [[Friedrich Joseph Haass]] and [[Mother Teresa]].&lt;ref name="FDSP" /&gt;

'''Timofei Mikhailovich Bondarev''' (Тимофе́й Миха́йлович Бо́ндарев 3 April 1820—3 November 1898) was a Russian peasant philosopher. He wrote the treatise ''[[The Triumph of the Farmer or Industry and Parasitism]]'', which inspired [[Leo Tolstoy]]. Tolstoy saw to its publication in 1888 and 1906.

==Life==
Bondarev was born a [[serf]] in southern Russia. When he was 37, his owner signed a commission to send him to the army for a 25-year conscription period. The conscription forcibly separated Bondarev from his wife and children. In the military, he renounced his [[Russian Orthodox]] faith and joined the [[Subbotniks]], a [[Sabbatarian]] sect. In 1867 he was arrested for [[apostasy]], discharged from the army, and sentenced to a life in exile on the [[Yenisei River]] in far eastern Russia.&lt;ref name=Bartlett&gt;Bartlett, Rosamund (2011) ''Tolstoy: A Russian Life'', pp. 318–320. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. {{ISBN|0547545878}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the only literate resident of his village, Bondarev founded a school, where he taught for 30 years in addition to farming. He also developed his philosophy of labor, which he wrote about in his treatise, ''[[The Triumph of the Farmer or Industry and Parasitism]]''. His philosophy centered on the concept of "bread-labor", by which all men, regardless of social status, are morally obligated to perform the manual labor necessary to sustain themselves.&lt;ref name=Bartlett/&gt;&lt;ref name=Alston&gt;Alston, Charlotte (2013) ''Tolstoy and his Disciples: The History of a Radical International Movement'', pp. 23–24. I.B. Tauris. {{ISBN|178076118X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Leo Tolstoy]] read the treatise in 1885 and started a long correspondence with Bondarev. He also went to great lengths to publish the work. The first two attempts were censored, but in 1888, the weekly journal ''Russkoye Delo'' (''The Russian Cause'') published a version edited by Tolstoy, who also provided a supplementary essay. It was translated into English and French in 1890. In 1906, Tolstoy's publishing house [[The Intermediary]] published the treatise in book form.&lt;ref name=Bartlett/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leo Tolstoy, Timofeĭ Bondarev  ''Toil'' 1890 Page v  "TOIL. INTRODUCTION How Toil was composed. The peasant Bondareff, inspirer of Tolstoi's social theories. The two laws of humanity: Manual labor is the law of men; child-bearing is the law of women."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Unrequited love''' or '''one-sided love''' is [[love]] that is not openly reciprocated or understood as such by the beloved. The beloved may not be aware of the admirer's deep and strong romantic [[affection]], or may consciously reject it. The Merriam Webster Online Dictionary defines unrequited as "not reciprocated or returned in kind".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/unrequited |title=Unrequited - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Psychiatrist]] [[Eric Berne]] states in his book ''[[Eric Berne#Bibliography|Sex in Human Loving]]'' that "Some say that one-sided love is better than none, but like half a loaf of bread, it is likely to grow hard and moldy sooner."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Eric |last=Berne |title=Sex in Human Loving |location= |publisher=Penguin |year=1970 |page=130 |isbn=0-671-20771-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OeOFAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA130 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, however, like the philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], considered that "indispensable...to the lover is his unrequited love, which he would at no price relinquish for a state of indifference."&lt;ref&gt;This is how R. B. Pippin describes Nietzsche's views in ''The Persistence of Subjectivity'' (2005) p. 326.&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be contrasted with redamancy or the act of reciprocal love.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ash|first1=John|title=The New And Complete Dictionary Of The English Language: In Which All The Words are Introduced ... : To Which Is Prefixed, A Comprehensive Grammar ; In Two Volumes, Volume 2|publisher=Dilly|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZPtIAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PT146|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
{{Love sidebar|types}}

===Route to unrequited love===
According to Dr. [[Roy Baumeister]], what makes a man or woman desirable, of course, is a complex and highly personal mix of many qualities and traits. But falling for someone who is much more desirable than oneself, whether because of physical beauty or attributes like charm, intelligence, wit or status, Baumeister calls this kind of mismatch "prone to find their love unrequited" and that such relationships are falling upward.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Pain of Unrequited Love Afflicts the09/science/pain-of-unrequited-love-afflicts-the-rejecter-too.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 1993-02-09|access-date = 2015-12-26|issn = 0362-4331|first = Daniel|last = Goleman}}&lt;/ref&gt; According  to some psychologists, opposites do attract, but it is not possible to attract those whose moral values are different.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Real Reason That Opposites Attract|url = https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/stronger-the-broken-places/201401/the-real-reason-opposites-attract|website = Psychology Today|accessdate = 2015-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'[[Platonic love|Platonic friendships]] provide a fertile soil for unrequited love'.&lt;ref&gt;Spitzberg, p. 311&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the object of unrequited love is often a friend or acquaintance, someone regularly encountered in the workplace, during the course of work, school or other activities involving large groups of people. This creates an awkward situation in which the admirer has difficulty in expressing their true feelings, a fear that revelation of feelings might invite rejection, cause [[embarrassment]] or might end all access to the beloved, as a romantic relationship may be inconsistent with the existing association.

===Unrequited love victims===
The inability of the unrequited lover to express or declare their love leads to negative [[emotion|feelings]] such as [[depression (mood)|depression]], low [[self-esteem]], [[anxiety]] and rapid [[mood swing]]s between depression and [[euphoria]].

===Rejectors===
'There are two bad sides to unrequited love, but only one is made familiar by our culture'&lt;ref&gt;"To love or be loved in vain: The trials and tribulations of unrequited love. In W. R. Cupach &amp; B. H. Spitzberg (Eds.), The dark side of close relationships (pp. 307-326). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. Carpenter, L. M. (1998)Spitzberg, p. 308&lt;/ref&gt; – that of the lover, not the rejector. In fact, research suggests that the object of unrequited affection experiences a variety of negative emotions on a par with those of the suitor, including anxiety, frustration and guilt.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Goleman |first=Daniel |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE1DB1E3DF93AA35751C0A965958260 |title=Pain of Unrequited Love Afflicts the Rejecter, Too - NYTimes.com |publisher=New York Times |date=1993-02-09 |accessdate=2010-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Freud]] long since pointed out, 'when a woman sues for love, to reject and refuse is a distressing part for a man to play'.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Malcolm, ''Psychoanalysis: The Impossible Profession'' (London 1988) p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Unrequited love has been a frequent subject in [[popular culture]]. Movies, books and songs often portray the would-be lover's persistence as paying off when the rejector comes to his or her senses. The presence of this script makes it easy to understand why an unrequited lover persists in the face of rejection.&lt;ref&gt;B. H. Spitzberg/W. R. Cupach, ''The Dark Side of Close Relationships'' (1998) p. 251&lt;/ref&gt;  In the traditional [[Wales|Welsh]] folk song [[Cariad Cywir]], the protagonist persists in unrequited love happily despite being continuously ignored.  However, there have been other depictions in which the unrequited lover commits suicide, as in Goethe's early novel ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]'' or in the traditional [[British Isles]] folk ballad ''[[I Once Loved a Lass]]''.  

In [[Billy Bragg]]'s song ''The Saturday Boy'', the young protagonist looks up the word "unrequited" in the dictionary whilst in the state of unrequited love.

"[[Johnny Angel (song)|Johnny Angel]]", a number one hit song by singer and actress [[Shelley Fabares]], has a relatively notable example of unrequited love. According to the lyrics of this song, a girl falls in love with a boy who doesn't even know that she exists. She even declines countless dates with other boys, just to fully concentrate on the boy she loves. And she has dreams about what the world would be like if the boy loves her. In its sequel, "Johnny Loves Me", also by Fabares, the girl later wins Johnny's heart, convincing him to believe that the girl does exist.

The comics strip ''[[Peanuts]]'' features multiple different characters engaged in unrequited love relationships. Commenting on the abundance of unrequited love in the series, author [[Charles Schulz]] said that he did not know why there is so much unrequited love, but it is something everyone can relate to.&lt;ref&gt;{{citebook|title=Celebrating Peanuts: 60 Years|author=Charles M. Schulz|publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==
Unrequited love has long been depicted as noble, an unselfish and stoic willingness to accept suffering. Literary and artistic depictions of unrequited love may depend on assumptions of social distance that have less relevance in western, democratic societies with relatively high social mobility and less rigid codes of sexual fidelity. Nonetheless, the literary record suggests a degree of euphoria in the feelings associated with unrequited love, which has the advantage as well of carrying none of the responsibilities of mutual relationships: certainly, "rejection, apparent or real, may be the catalyst for inspired literary creation... 'the poetry of frustration'."&lt;ref&gt;Mary Ward, ''The Literature of Love'' (2009) p. 45-6&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eric Berne]] considered that "the man who is loved by a woman is lucky indeed, but the one to be envied is he who loves, however little he gets in return. How much greater is [[Dante]] gazing at [[Beatrice Portinari|Beatrice]] than Beatrice walking by him in apparent disdain".&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''Sex in Human Loving'' (Penguin 1970) p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Remedies"==
Roman poet [[Ovid]] in his ''[[Remedia Amoris]]'' "provides advice on how to overcome inappropriate or unrequited love. The solutions offered include [[travel]], [[teetotalism]], [[bucolic]] pursuits, and ironically, avoidance of love poets".&lt;ref&gt;A. Grafton et al, ''The Classical Tradition'' (2010) p. 664&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural analogues==

In the wake of his real-life experiences with [[Maud Gonne]], in a further twist, [[W. B. Yeats]] wrote of those who 'had read/All I had rhymed of that monstrous thing/Returned and yet unrequited love'.&lt;ref&gt;Y. B. Yeats, ''The Poems'' (London 1983) p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Robert B. Pippin]], [[Proust]] claimed that 'the only successful (sustainable) love is unrequited love'.&lt;ref&gt;Pippin, p. 326&lt;/ref&gt; According to Pippin, sometimes 'unrequited love...has been invoked as a figure for the condition of [[modernity]] itself'.&lt;ref&gt;Pippin, p. 326n&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of unrequited love include [[W. B. Yeats]], [[Stendhal]], [[Dante]], [[Ayn Rand]], [[Hans Christian Andersen]], and [[Goethe]].

'''Vasile V. Pogor''' ([[Francization|Francized]] ''Basile Pogor''; August 20, 1833 – March 20, 1906) was a [[Moldavia]]n, later [[Romania]]n poet, philosopher, translator and [[Liberal conservatism|liberal conservative]] politician, one of the founders of ''[[Junimea]]'' literary society. Raised in the aristocratic circle of [[Iași]], and educated in the [[Second French Empire|French Empire]], he had a career in law. He was a civil servant during the [[United Principalities]] regime, held seats and commissions in the [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Assembly of Deputies]], and, after the proclamation of the [[Kingdom of Romania]], was Mayor of Iași City. Although he had a major role in creating the [[Conservative Party (Romania, 1880–1918)|Conservative Party]], by fusing together the various "White" political clubs and [[Masonic Lodge]]s, Pogor was more loyal to the ''Junimist'' inner faction, and stood by it when it split with the other Conservatives.

An [[Irreligion|irreligious]] [[Evolutionism|evolutionist]], and taking an interest in [[Buddhist studies]], Pogor represented the [[Positivism|Positivist]] cell at ''Junimea''. He was also one of the first locals to study the work of [[Henry Thomas Buckle]], integrating Bucklean concepts into ''Junimea''{{'}}s critique of [[nation building]]. He supported Romania's [[Westernization]] within a conservative framework, tempering nationalist presumptions and valuing a culturally pluralistic society. The notoriously indolent and improvident Pogor had a preference for [[orality]], and was sought after for his [[Voltaire|Voltairian]] wit. He left few written works, and many unfulfilled projects, but influenced [[Romanian literature]] as a cultural promoter, sponsor, and the first local expert on [[Charles Baudelaire]]. He was known to his ''Junimea'' colleagues as a one-man "contemporary library".

Pogor's final decades were spent away from the national scene, although he still took on assignments in the Conservative and ''Junimist'' chapters of [[Iași County]]. ''[[Casa Pogor]]'', his main residence, is closely associated with ''Junimist'' history. Although sold by its debt-stricken owner in 1901, it was revived in the 1970s as a literary history museum, theater venue and concert hall. Married to the [[Russian nobility|Russian aristocrat]] Elena Hartingh, Pogor left an illegitimate son, Vasile Panopol.

==Biography==

===Origins and childhood===
According to various accounts, the Pogors were a clan of [[yeomen]] from the eponymous [[Răuseni|Pogorăști]], raised into [[Boyars of Wallachia and Moldavia|boyar nobility]] ca. 1820.&lt;ref&gt;Bezviconi, pp. 58–59; Vianu, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; The family's own pedigree claimed otherwise, namely that its members had been "enjoying native privileges" since ancient times.&lt;ref name="gc92"&gt;Călinescu, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; On the basis of such claims, Vasile Pogor Sr had a steady climb through the Moldavian civilian and military bureaucracy: he began his career as a ''[[Serdar (Ottoman rank)|Serdar]]'' (1819), before being made a ''[[Comis]]'' for life.&lt;ref name="gc92"/&gt; During his 1816–1823 mission into the [[Bessarabian Governorate]], [[Russian Empire]], Pogor kidnapped Zoița Cerchez, granddaughter of a local ''[[Clucer]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Bezviconi, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; From this marriage, he had three daughters—Antonia, Eleonora, Smaranda—and a son, the future poet.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, pp. 92, 437. See also Bezviconi, pp. 59, 87&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of his birth, the family owned large boyar estates in both [[Vaslui County]] (including [[Vulturești, Vaslui|Buhăiești]] and [[Drânceni|Râșești]]) and Bessarabia.&lt;ref name="gc92"/&gt;

As a political poet in the [[Age of Revolution]], ''Comis'' Pogor looked back with disgust on the late [[Phanariotes|Phanariote]] period and the [[Filiki Eteria|Eterist]] invasion, satirizing the ambitions of [[Greeks of Romania|Greek immigrants]] to Moldavia.&lt;ref name="gc92"/&gt; In the late 1830s, he would be equally opposed to the Moldavian ''status quo'', criticizing the heavy-handed [[List of rulers of Moldavia|Moldavian sovereign]] [[Mihail Sturdza]]. His rhyming pamphlets envisaged [[equality before the law]], their author having signed up to the "Confederative Conspiracy", planned by Moldavia's [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|proto-liberal boyardom]].&lt;ref name="tv80"&gt;Vianu, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; He still held several high political-judicial offices in the last quarter of Sturdza, including the ''[[Agha (Ottoman Empire)|Agie]]'' and the Justice Department chairmanship.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, pp. 91, 92&lt;/ref&gt;

Pogor Sr's worldview also owed much to his familiarity with [[French literature]]. He corresponded with [[François-René de Chateaubriand|Chateaubriand]], wishing to publish his poetry in a Moldavian edition,&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; but is probably best known as Voltaire's first [[Romanian-language]] translator. His version of the ''[[Henriade]]'' was published in neighboring [[Wallachia]] by the liberal intellectual [[Ion Heliade Rădulescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 91; Vianu, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; It and other translations by the ''Comis'' (''[[Zaïre (play)|Zaïre]]'', ''[[Poème sur le désastre de Lisbonne|Désastre de Lisbonne]]'') may prove that Pogor the younger was already familiar with Voltaire and Voltarianism from early childhood.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, pp. 91, 436&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Veisa and Pogor take the stagecoach ride to Kraków, 1849 ILR 440.jpg|thumb|340px|Teodor Veisa's drawing of the 1849 departure for [[Kraków]]]]
Born in Iași, the Moldavian capital, Vasile Jr was selected for the most modern forms of education available to Moldavians living in the 1840s. He first attended the liberal arts' school of Frenchman Malgoverné, and, in addition to discovering an interest in literature, became a skilled amateur draftsman.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 437; Vianu, pp. 80, 82&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1849, young Pogor took the [[stagecoach]] ride to [[Kraków]], and then the train to [[Paris]], accompanied by the boyar heirs Heraclide, Porfiriu, Miclescu and Teodor Veisa, and chaperoned by Malgoverné himself. The scene of their departure from Iași is preserved in a sketch drawing by Veisa, which shows the enthusiastic adolescents leaning out the carriage doors.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, pp. 437, 440&lt;/ref&gt;

===French and German education===
Pogor completed his education in France. He is widely seen as formed by [[Education in France|French education]], but, according to cultural sociologist [[Zigu Ornea]], this is only part of the story: Pogor did not graduate from a ''[[Secondary education in France|lycée]]'', but was actually trained at a [[Germanophone]] boarding school; was not introduced to [[Bonapartism]], but to "the ideological principles of [[Bourbon Restoration|Restoration]]".&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (I), p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; As argued by author Gheorghe Manolache, Pogor was one of those who saw [[French culture]] as "speculative", and sought to amend its influence with [[Culture of Germany|German]] or [[Anglophone]] borrowings.&lt;ref name="gmschiller24"&gt;{{ro icon}} Gheorghe Manolache, [https://web.archive.org/web/20140714130049/http://www.revistatransilvania.ro/arhiva/2005/pdf/numarul10-11/art9_literaritate_si_literalitate_sau_arta_de_a_traduce_pe_schiller.pdf "Sub patronajul Junimii din Iași (1863–1874). Literaritate și literalitate sau arta de a traduce pe Schiller"] in ''Transilvania'', Nr. 10–11/2005, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1851, he took an extended study trip through the [[German Confederation]], in lieu of service in the [[Moldavian military forces]]. The Moldavian state granted him dispensation, and awarded him the rank of [[Cadet]].&lt;ref name="gc437"&gt;Călinescu, p. 437&lt;/ref&gt;

Pogor was subsequently enlisted at the [[University of Paris]] Law School, where he took his [[Doctor of law|doctorate in law]].&lt;ref name="lvvp-fiul"&gt;{{ro icon}} Lucian Vasiliu, [https://web.archive.org/web/20040222022006/http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/VASILIUdec3.html "Vasile Pogor-fiul"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', December 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 419&lt;/ref&gt; His contact with the Parisian salons was of major formative importance: he was an avid reader and, as literary historian [[Tudor Vianu]] notes, "always open to new things, ready to defeat prejudice", if rather indiscriminate.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, pp. 80–81&lt;/ref&gt; Pogor's one constant was the study of the classics: he reread [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'' once every year.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 437; Vianu, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; His other known pursuits were non-academic. Pogor discovered ''[[comédie en vaudeville]]'' theater, kept company with mature women, and began fantasizing about writing his own novels and short stories.&lt;ref name="gc437"/&gt;

The Pogors enjoyed high political profiles during and after the [[Crimean War]], when the Moldavian and Wallachian principalities became a condominium of the [[Great Powers]]. Before his death in 1857, Pogor Sr was head of the [[appellate court]] (''Divanul de apel'', later ''Curtea de apel''), and one of the boyars tasked with welcoming in the foreign overseers.&lt;ref name="gc92"/&gt; Upon his return to Moldavia, the young lawyer became sole owner of a palatial residence, ''[[Casa Pogor]]'', built by his father in 1850, on land previously owned by the Cerchez and Coroi boyars.&lt;ref name="cccasele4"&gt;{{ro icon}} Constantin Coroiu, [http://revistacultura.ro/cultura.php?articol=4884 "Casele scriitorilor (IV)"], in ''Cultura'', Nr. 247, October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; He also took assignments in the judicial apparatus. He was a judge in Iași from 1857 to 1858, and a member of the appellate court after March 1859.&lt;ref name="gc437"/&gt; Although cutting the figure of an eccentric among the stern bureaucrats, he managed to impress [[Costache Negruzzi]], his hierarchical superior and celebrated novelist. In his account, Pogor displayed "something rare in our folk": "a great feeling for justice".&lt;ref name="ipafis"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ioana Pârvulescu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/index.pl/un_loc_gol_pe_afi "Un loc gol pe afiș"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 41/2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pogors still maintained close links with the areas on the other side of the [[Prut River]]: Antonia Pogor became the wife of Bessarabian boyar Dumitru Bantîș.&lt;ref&gt;Bezviconi, p. 87; Călinescu, p. 437&lt;/ref&gt; When he married the Bessarabian heiress Elena Hartingh, Vasile established a connection with [[Russian nobility]]. His father-in-law was a Karl "Scarlat" Hartingh (or Garting), owner of an estate in [[Pohrebeni]].&lt;ref&gt;Bezviconi, pp. 59, 116; Călinescu, p. 437&lt;/ref&gt; Elena's grandfather was [[Ivan Markovich Garting]], an [[Finns|ethnic Finn]] who had served as [[Bessarabian Governorate|Bessarabian Governor]]; her grandmother, "Elenco" Hartinga, was closely related to the high-ranking boyardom of Moldavia.&lt;ref&gt;Bezviconi, p. 116; [[Nicolae Iorga]], "Testamentul unei nepoate de fiică, mame și surori de Domni moldoveni", in ''Revista Istorică'', Nr. 7–9/1931, pp. 153–163&lt;/ref&gt;

From early 1859, Moldavia and Wallachia formed a single Romanian state, known as the "[[United Principalities]]" and ruled upon by ''[[Domnitor]]'' [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza]]. Still employed by the Moldavian appellate court under Cuza's regime, Pogor objected to the fiscal policies of [[Prime Minister of Romania|Premier]] [[Nicolae Crețulescu]], and resigned in September 1863, shortly followed by his colleague [[Alexandru Papadopol-Calimah]].&lt;ref&gt;X., "Năpăstiile Uniriĭ. IV. Suferințele Moldoveĭ", in ''[[Românul|Romănulŭ]]'', September 25, 1863, p. 848&lt;/ref&gt; By then, he had resumed his literary projects. The first achievement of Pogor's work as a translator was his retelling of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]'s ''[[Faust: The First Part of the Tragedy|Faust I]]'', with [[Nicolai Skelitti]] as co-author, saw print in 1862.&lt;ref name="tv81"&gt;Vianu, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cjnoica"&gt;{{ro icon}} Corina Jiva, [http://www.romlit.ro/index.pl/suntem_inca_in_anul_noica "Suntem încă în anul Noica"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 50/2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dmmodelul"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Dan Mănucă]], [http://www.romlit.ro/index.pl/modelul_junimist "Modelul junimist"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 48/2008&lt;/ref&gt; Samples of his own poetry were published by the pro-Cuza magazine ''Din Moldova'', whose editor was a future enemy, the Romantic novelist and scholar [[Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Teodor Vârgolici, [http://www.romlit.ro/index.pl/revistele_lui_b._p._hasdeu2 "Revistele lui B. P. Hasdeu"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 30/2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Principalities era saw Pogor's activity blending into the cultural projects of ''Junimea'' literary society. Founded in stages ca. 1863, that club was originally focused on literary debates and popular education. Its founders were five young graduates, all but one of them boyars. Pogor and [[Theodor Rosetti]] were French-trained; [[Petre P. Carp]] and [[Iacob Negruzzi]] (Costache's son) had studied in the German Confederation. The fifth was [[Titu Maiorescu]], an upper-middle-class intellectual trained in both French and German schools, generally seen as the leading voice of ''Junimism'', the cultural and political concept.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, pp. 397, 399, 419; Ornea (I), pp. 1–42; Vianu, pp. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt;

Little is known about the first years of ''Junimism''. The five founders left only a handful of notes on the subject, and discouraged others from investigating the topic. Pogor himself mystified on the subject: he laughed off the historiographic attempts and, playfully reusing a literary cliché, informed newer members of the club that "''Junimea''{{'}}s origin is lost in the mist of time".&lt;ref name="mdssocsec2"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Mihai Dim. Sturdza]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20040810130412/http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/STURDZAiul4.html "Junimea, societate secretă (II)"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', July 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (I), p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; His version of events subverted other accounts, including the vague memoirs of Iacob Negruzzi. Pogor thus claimed that ''Junimea'' existed in large part because of him. In Pogor's account, the first manifestation of what would become ''Junimea'' was a study group comprising himself, Skelitti, Papadopol-Calimah, [[Theodor Aslan]], [[Iorgu Gane]], [[Ioan Ianov]], and some other prominent Iași intellectuals; to the irritation of other ''Junimists'', he constantly backdated ''Junimea''{{'}}s existence to 1862.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (I), pp. 14–15&lt;/ref&gt; His account is not validated by the written records, and other sources (themselves scanty) suggest that, although invited by Maiorescu, Pogor did not in fact attend the so-called "first ''Junimea'' meeting" (February 9, 1864).&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (I), pp. 15–16&lt;/ref&gt;

Pogor was nonetheless present at other (possibly earlier) gatherings, which gave a more formal status to the reunions. In his half-mythical narrative of events, presented at later ''Junimea'' banquets, Pogor insisted that the first day of ''Junimism'' was a Friday (''vineri''), and that, as such, the club was under the divine patronage of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]].&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (I), pp. 34–35&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the available reconstructions of events, the club's name seems to have been selected by Rosetti, and ceremoniously validated by Pogor—whom the other founders already recognized as their ''[[Wiktionary:enfant terrible|enfant terrible]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (I), pp. 17–18, 30, 36–37; Vianu, pp. 18, 81&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting society had little in the way of a published program, but the generic lines, including efforts to rationalize the [[History of the Romanian language|spelling of Romanian]] and to provide affordable education, survive in one of I. Negruzzi's letters.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (I), pp. 19–21&lt;/ref&gt;

Pogor's large townhouse is popularly understood as the ''Junimea'' headquarters, but, at least initially, the club also met at Maiorescu's place, and occasionally at Negruzzi's.&lt;ref name="Ornea I, p. 34"&gt;Ornea (I), p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; Indirectly, the young boyar helped found the club's own printing press, which was donated to Maiorescu by Pogor's Bessarabian cousin, the philanthropist [[Nicolae Ștefan Casso]], and, after 1867, the literary sheet ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]''.&lt;ref name="gmschiller24"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (I), pp. 27–28, 43; Vianu, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; The latter's mailing address was ''Casa Pogor''.&lt;ref name="cccasele4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="spirituljun"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://curierul-iasi.ro/vasile-pogor-spiritul-junimii-in-palatul-roznovanu-4289 "Vasile Pogor, spiritul Junimii în Palatul Roznovanu"], in ''[[Curierul de Iași]]'', September 13, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Pogor himself managed the publishing firm, but did a notoriously poor job. Described by Ornea as "a man for all the hasty projects" and as an "absent-minded" individual, Pogor ran heavy debts and frequently changed managers ([[Ioan Mire Melik]], [[Al. Farra]] etc.).&lt;ref name="Ornea I, p. 28"&gt;Ornea (I), p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Junimist'' publishing house was barely keeping afloat once Pogor took money out of the budget to create a book store—one of such niche appeal as to make Pogor the only buyer of his books.&lt;ref name="lvvp-fiul"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ornea I, p. 28"/&gt;

===Provocateur, anthologist, lecturer===
At ''Junimea'', Pogor was a picturesque figure. Ornea suggests that, despite being a respectable boyar and the oldest among the founders, Pogor was also the most "child-like" in his reactions.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (I), p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Witnesses recall that he was always amused by the literary works presented for analysis, laughing "till his new teeth jumped out of his mouth", and casually reclining on a sofa as the debates were taking place.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 436&lt;/ref&gt; Negruzzi recalled that, in defiance for "any social habit", Pogor left his guests unattended to read his books; he writes that, on first impression, Pogor appeared "cheeky and missing something upstairs".&lt;ref name="ipafis"/&gt; Moreover, Pogor embarrassed his friends with his obscene anecdotes, his name-calling, and his occasional outbursts, during which he would hurl his cape at them.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ioana Pârvulescu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/index.pl/mai_avem_azi_un_maiorescu_iii "Mai avem azi un Maiorescu? (III)"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 21/2009&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Pogor's lolling habit and thundering laughter soon became fashionable, and his yawning during the others' recitations was intentionally loud, provocative and contagious.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (I), pp. 36, 38–41&lt;/ref&gt; He justified such heckling with the expression ''Entre qui veut, reste qui peut'' (French for "enters who wishes, stays on who can stand it"), later a ''Junimea'' motto.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (I), p. 39; {{ro icon}} [[Ioana Pârvulescu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/index.pl/la_nceput_a_fost_deviza.. "La început a fost deviza..."], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 38/2006&lt;/ref&gt; The slogan resonated with the ''caracudă'' ("small game") wing of ''Junimea''—mostly passive youngsters who came in for entertainment, and who, Ornea notes, were "apparently immune to beauty and ignorant".&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (I), p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

For all his unorthodox stances, Pogor was regarded by all his colleagues as a towering intellect, and referred to as "the contemporary library".&lt;ref name="tv81"/&gt; The ''Junimist'' colleagues repeatedly noted that he was the man to bring in not just irreverence, but also genuine innovation.&lt;ref name="ipafis"/&gt; Vianu describes his "merciless gibes" as stemming from a conviction that the others were too uptight, and in general from a rejection of "dogmatism"; Pogor, he writes, would "embrace in turn all sorts of attitudes".&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Another scholar, [[Șerban Cioculescu]], describes Pogor as by character "a free, unambitious, spirit, an [[Epicureanism|epicurean]] of intelligence".&lt;ref&gt;Cioculescu, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Ornea cautions: "If Maiorescu has conferred a consistent substance to ''Junimea'', then Pogor gave it a pinch of salt, wit, humor and—an essential element—skepticism, that is to say a sense of relativity."&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (I), p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

Encouraged by the other club members, Pogor became the anthologist of bad journalism and literature, scouring anti-''Junimist'' periodicals and picking out the most amusing enormities and the most embarrassing platitudes. These he then pasted into his ''Dosar'' ("Dossier"), which is for most part a subtle political attack on the "Red" ideology of [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|Romanian liberalism]] and [[Romantic nationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (I), pp. 35–36&lt;/ref&gt; Ornea notes: "those who have discussed the ''Junimea Dossier'' as politics in disguise, practiced by a literary circle that had denied itself—under pain of sanction—any politically derived conversation, they were not at all in the wrong."&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (I), p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; Already in 1863, the ''Junimists'' had engaged in battle the literary representatives of Romanian liberalism, including ''Din Moldova''{{'}}s B. P. Hasdeu. The latter dedicated his activity as a journalist to deriding or condemning the ''Junimea'' group, Pogor included, accusing it of standing for values not complementary with the Romanian way: [[cosmopolitanism]] and [[Germanophilia]], [[elitism]] and [[philosemitism]].&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt;

While these debates gathered in notoriety, Pogor was also joining in the yearly cycle of ''Junimea'' conferences, or ''prelecțiuni''. He, Maiorescu, and Carp were the core group of lecturers during the first age of the ''prelecțiuni''. The subjects were broad and the inspiration spontaneous,&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (I), pp. 22–23; Vianu, pp. 7, 32–33&lt;/ref&gt; but the speakers still followed Maiorescu's elaborate ceremonial, which reduced direct contact with the listeners.&lt;ref name="lpmasoneria"&gt;{{ro icon}} Liviu Papuc, [https://web.archive.org/web/20080710201511/http://www.sud-est.md/numere/20061123/article_8/ "Masoneria junimistă"], in ''[[Revista Sud-Est]]'', Nr. 4/2006&lt;/ref&gt; In 1864, Pogor discussed the [[French Revolution]], and specifically its "impact on modern ideas".&lt;ref name="tv81"/&gt; There was a break in the following year, with Maiorescu having been involved in a sex scandal, but the lecturers returned in 1866, when the common theme was "factors of national life throughout history".&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (I), p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; Pogor was also contributing to the ''Junimea'' who's who of Romanian poetry, selecting for reading pieces by the 18th-century boyar [[Ienăchiță Văcărescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (I), pp. 73–74&lt;/ref&gt; At the ''prelecțiuni'', Pogor spoke about [[Ancient Greek art]]; in 1867, about [[Shakespearean tragedy]]; during later cycles, he discovered and introduced for the general public the philosophy of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]].&lt;ref name="tv81"/&gt; Still focused on national identity constructs and the [[philosophy of history]], he promoted at ''Junimea'' the evolutionist treatise ''History of Civilization in England'', by [[Henry Thomas Buckle]].&lt;ref name="arideologia13"&gt;{{ro icon}} Alexandru Ruja, [http://www.revistaorizont.ro/arhiva/iunie2011.pdf "Ideologia junimistă"], in ''[[Orizont]]'', Nr. 6/2011, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (I), pp. 49, 60, 157, 167–168; Vianu, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;

===Masonic conspirator and "White" organizer===
Meanwhile, Pogor the politician was drawn into secretive, then conspiratorial, work. Pogor in Iași, and Carp in [[Bucharest]], helped organize the February 1866 putsch against the [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] Cuza, and supported the interim government presided upon by both liberal "Reds" and conservative "Whites".&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (I), p. 252&lt;/ref&gt; On February 15, the [[Princely Lieutenancy of Romania (1866)|Romanian Regency]] appointed Pogor [[Prefect (Romania)|Prefect]] of [[Iași County]],&lt;ref name="gc437"/&gt; and he was also a regional representative in the [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Assembly of Deputies]] ([[Romanian general election, April 1866|quickly elected]] for the drafting of a [[1866 Constitution of Romania|new constitution]]). On April 28, he was elected as one of its secretaries.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolescu, pp. 5–6&lt;/ref&gt; For most of the year, he had a noted role in persuading his colleagues to accept [[bicameralism]], and thus contributed to the establishment of the [[Senate of Romania]].&lt;ref&gt;Xenopol, pp. 522–523&lt;/ref&gt; In March, he was also sent back to the appellate court, as section president, serving until January 1868.&lt;ref name="gc437"/&gt; According to scholar [[George Călinescu]], he began supplementing his revenue with "multiple and ephemeral" special commissions, including that of [[Certified teacher|teacher certification]] examiner (October 1866).&lt;ref name="gc437"/&gt;

Pogor was received into the [[Freemasonry]] ([[Ancient and Primitive Rite|Oriental Rite of Memphis]], [[Grand Orient de France]]) on March 14, 1866, and, only a year later, reached the 90th Masonic Degree.&lt;ref name="lpmasoneria"/&gt; Within the divided [[Freemasonry in Romania|Romanian Freemasonry]], he sided with the Moldavian [[Masonic Lodge|Lodge]] called "Star of Romania": he was the Orator under Venerable Master Iorgu Sutzu.&lt;ref name="lpmasoneria"/&gt; Joined by most of the ''Junimist'' personalities, this institution would open up a new front against the "Reds", challenging their [[xenophobia]] and [[antisemitism]]. The Lodge opened its ranks to people of various backgrounds, including [[History of the Jews in Romania|Romanian Jews]], but was off-limits to the Moldavian liberals.&lt;ref name="mdssocsec2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lpmasoneria"/&gt; The Lodge members, Pogor and Maiorescu included, set up and helped edit a "White" political sheet, ''Constituțiunea'' ("Constitution"), later ''Gazeta de Iassi''.&lt;ref name="mdssocsec2"/&gt; Initially, the paper joined the ranks of Moldavian regionalists, complaining about Iași's social, cultural, and demographic decline under Romanian rule; however, by March 30, Pogor and Maiorescu had also affiliated with the centralizing [[National Party (Romania)|National Party]], where they talked of finding other roles for the declining former capital.&lt;ref&gt;Xenopol, pp. 487–488, 498–499, 502–504, 506&lt;/ref&gt; Against separatists such as Constantin Moruzi and the [[Free and Independent Faction]], they sought a cemented union, proposing the selection of a foreign ruler from [[Romance-speaking Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Xenopol, pp. 503–504, 506&lt;/ref&gt;

With the arrival on the throne of a German prince, [[Carol I of Romania|Carol of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen]], the anti-Cuza coalition was again divided into competing factions. However, Ornea writes, just two ''Junimist'' leaders had openly engaged in party politics: "Petre Carp and—unbelievably so!—the freaky V. Pogor."&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (I), p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; This despite the fact that Iași's Masonic Lodge had become a junior wing of the "White" party, and was portrayed by the local "Red" polemicists as an [[Anti-Christian sentiment|anti-Christian]] fraternity.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (I), p. 253&lt;/ref&gt; No longer committed to the principle of a "Latin" prince, Pogor openly supported the new ''Domnitor''—he was one of 109 deputies (from a total 115) to ratify the [[Romanian prince referendum, 1866|April plebiscite]].&lt;ref&gt;Xenopol, p. 506&lt;/ref&gt; The "Star of Romania" Lodge invited Carol to join its ranks and become leader of the unified Freemasonry.&lt;ref name="lpmasoneria"/&gt; Around 1867, against antisemitic agitation by the Free and Independent Faction, the ''Junimist'' core, Pogor included, signed up to a proposal for [[Jewish emancipation]], meaning the Jewish minority's effective naturalization. Probably initiated by the "Star of Romania",&lt;ref name="mdssocsec2"/&gt; their petition asked ''Domnitor'' Carol to "establish legal order" in front of "anarchy", noting that the liberals worked to "kidnap hundreds of Jews".&lt;ref&gt;[[William Evans-Gordon]], [https://archive.org/details/alienimmigrant00evanuoft ''The Alien Immigrant''], pp. 167–168.  London: [[Heinemann (publisher)|W. Heinemann]], 1903&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1869, Pogor and Carp had also rallied with the Society of Young Dynasticists, which conspired with dissident liberals such as [[Gheorghe Mârzescu]] to elect only monarchists into office—for instance, [[Romanian general election, 1869|during 1869]].&lt;ref&gt;Ioan Dafin, ''Iașii, cultural și social: Amintiri și însemnări'', Vol. II, pp. 80–83. Iași: [[Viața Romînească]], 1929&lt;/ref&gt; The early 1870s transformed ''Junimea'' into a moderate conservative political movement, annexed to the "White" wing of the political spectrum. For Maiorescu, theirs was the cause of restoration and order in front of "Red" agitation (the [[Republic of Ploiești]] episode), but also adverse to the "arch-conservatives" who wanted a return of boyar privileges.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (I), pp. 256–257&lt;/ref&gt; Within this setting, Pogor found that his political status progressed quickly: from January 1869 to May 1870, he was president of the appellate court.&lt;ref name="gc437"/&gt; Yet, as Tudor Vianu notes, he still treated political assignments "with a certain indifference."&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of that decade, "White" Premier [[Manolache Costache Epureanu]] opened his cabinet to ''Junimist'' experts, and Pogor was expected to take over a top administrative position. Carp, who negotiated the deal, vouched for Pogor's competence.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, pp. 400; Ornea (I), pp. 63–64, 80, 254–255&lt;/ref&gt; Pogor resigned before the so-called "Hen and Fledgling" cabinet was even sworn in.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 400; Ornea (I), p. 254; Vianu, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, he complained of [[dorsopathy]], leaving Maiorescu worried that he had developed [[neurosyphilis]]. Pogor declared himself cured within a few days, announcing that he was ready to take over as Romania's [[Ministry of Education, Research, Youth and Sport (Romania)|Minister of Education]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, pp. 400–401&lt;/ref&gt; According to various sources, he actually held the office, if only briefly.&lt;ref&gt;Bacalbașa, pp. 19–20; Șuțu, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; His unexpected renunciation cleared the path for Maiorescu's own political ascent, moving him from a position in the background to the "Fledgling" Education portfolio.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, pp. 400–401; Ornea (I), pp. 254–256&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Convorbiri Literare'' editor and 1871 mandate===
[[File:Vasile Pogor in 1873 ILR 440.jpg|thumb|190px|Pogor in 1873]]
Pogor still was a notable participant in polemics, taking Maiorescu's side. One such case was that of disputes between the ''Junimists'' and an ultra-"White" group headed by Epureanu. The latter wanted to institute an authoritarian regime favoring the upper class and favored some exotic policies—[[Capital punishment in Romania|generalizing the death penalty]] or opening the country to massive [[Germans of Romania|German colonization]]. Probably wishing to maintain "White" unity, the ''Junimists'', including Pogor, gave reluctant backing to the Epureanu program, and became targets for "Red" sarcasm, and were even chided by the dominant conservative club, that of [[Lascăr Catargiu]].&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (I), pp. 258–262. See also Bacalbașa, pp. 25–35&lt;/ref&gt; Pogor was also chairman of the ''Junimist'' "Society for Sending Young Romanians on Study Trips", noted for discovering and sponsoring the future [[Atheism|atheistic]] philosopher [[Vasile Conta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Sorin Lavric]], [http://www.romlit.ro/index.pl/plectrul_fatalitii "Plectrul fatalității"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 13/2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In parallel with his political chores, Pogor took up the task of translating some of [[Charles Baudelaire]]'s ''[[Les Fleurs du mal|Flowers of Evil]]''. "Don Juan in Hell" and "Gipsies on the Road" were both published by ''Convorbiri'' in March 1870.&lt;ref name="dmmodelul"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 437; [[Paul Cernat]], ''Avangarda românească și complexul periferiei: primul val'', p. 8.

His papers reveal that he had also tried, but failed, to translate, among others, ''[[Rameau's Nephew]]'' by [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]], [[Ludwig Uhland]]'s "The Minstrel's Curse", and [[Constantin-François Chassebœuf|Volney]]'s ''Les Ruines''.&lt;ref name="gc437, 1000"/&gt;

In addition to his translation projects, ''Convorbiri Literare'' hosted his original works, beginning with the autobiographical piece "A Marquise's Pastel" (September 1868).&lt;ref name="lvvp-fiul"/&gt; In January 1871, still independent of party politics, the journal was reorganized as a cultural monthly. Pogor was assigned to the editorial committee, a triumvirate also grouping Maiorescu and Negruzzi.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (I), pp. 65–66&lt;/ref&gt; He and Maiorescu resigned soon after, alleging that Negruzzi had failed to consult them about the editorial policy, possibly because of a polemical review inserted by [[Ștefan Vârgolici]].&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (I), p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; This did not imply that they would cease to write for ''Convorbiri''. Also that year, the magazine published a poem by Pogor's deceased father, newly discovered in the family archive.&lt;ref name="tv80"/&gt; In October, when ''Junimea'' finally liquidated its publishing venture, Pogor was asked to take care of the debts and return the debit.&lt;ref name="Ornea I, p. 28"/&gt; Without Negruzzi's knowledge, the enterprise was purchased by the Jewish businessman Herșcu Goldner.&lt;ref name="gmschiller24"/&gt;

Meanwhile, Hasdeu's ''Columna lui Traian'' paper had made it its mission to host samples from Pogor's poetry, to show its readers how one was not supposed to versify.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Gheorghe Mocuța, [http://www.revista-studii-uvvg.ro/files/revista_III_4.pdf "Centenar Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu"], in the [[Vasile Goldiș West University of Arad]] ''Studii de Știință și Cultură'', Nr. 4 (11), December 2007, p. 99; Ornea (II), p. 287&lt;/ref&gt; Hasdeu registered a moral victory when a short poem by an "M. I. Ellias" saw print in the July 15 issue of ''Convorbiri Literare''. With Maiorescu in Bucharest, the piece had earned the approval of both Pogor and his rival, [[Mihai Eminescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (II), p. 289&lt;/ref&gt; It was, in fact, a prank. Hasdeu had improvised the poem himself (calling it "a rhyming frivolity") so as to prove that ''Junimea'' writers lacked taste and patriotic feeling—"there is not a [[Wiktionary:galimatias|galimatias]] [...] that ''Convorbiri Literare'' won't rush in to grab and hold by its bosom, provided one essential condition is met: that it does not include anything Romanian."&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (II), pp. 288–289&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Junimist'' faction made its formal entry into [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]] after the [[Romanian general election, 1871|1871 election]]. As a result of these, the nation's Assembly of Deputies included five ''Junimist'' members, voting with the "White" group: Pogor, Maiorescu, Negruzzi, N. Gane, [[Gheorghe Racoviță]].&lt;ref name="Ornea I, p. 258"&gt;Ornea (I), p. 258&lt;/ref&gt; After the partial elections of 1874, they were joined by two others: Carp (previously serving ''Domnitor'' Carol as a diplomat) and Th. Rosetti.&lt;ref name="Ornea I, p. 258"/&gt; As noted by his contemporaries, Pogor, even though selected as Vice President of the Assembly,&lt;ref name="spirituljun"/&gt; was not an asset for the ''Junimist'' faction. [[George Panu]], the ''Junimea'' memoirist, noted that Pogor was an incompetent public speaker, rarely present at the rostrum. When he did address the Assembly, Pogor was unrecognizable and "embarrassing", turning "pale as a cadaver", his voice "shaking" with timidity.&lt;ref name="gc441"&gt;Călinescu, p. 441&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bucharest relocation and 1875 mandate===
Pogor's own prolonged absences, like the political passions of other ''Junimist'' founders, were a cause for concern in Iași. Those who had stayed behind, Negruzzi included, complained that the club was dying out, with the reunions turning into glorified tea parties.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (I), pp. 85–95&lt;/ref&gt; As such, all the ''Junimea'' founders except Negruzzi were absent from the club's meeting on February 25, 1872.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (I), p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

In the end, when Negruzzi also accepted a government job, the club was reestablished to the national capital, Bucharest. The small Iași section survived for a while as a ''caracudă'' hotspot, experiencing what Ornea called "a slow and embarrassing ending".&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (I), pp. 95–97&lt;/ref&gt; Pogor paid the occasional visit and, according to ''caracudă'' leader [[Nicolae Gane]], behaved with restraint ("against his nature").&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (I), p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; This was the time of Pogor's polemics with Eminescu. The latter, a voice of [[national conservatism]], and recognized by posterity as the Romanian [[national poet]], read out his fantasy novella ''[[Sărmanul Dionis]]''. As ''Junimea'' minutes will attest, Pogor and Maiorescu found the work to be all to cryptic, but still gave approval for its publishing.&lt;ref&gt;Valentin Coșereanu, "Jurnalul Junimii"], in ''Caiete Critice'', Nr. 6/2010, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; For a few months in 1874, Pogor allowed the penniless poet to lodge with him. Sources diverge on whether Eminescu lived at ''Casa Pogor''&lt;ref name="cccasele4"/&gt; or another one of the politician's townhouses, which has since been demolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Valeriu Gherghel, [http://www.ziaruldeiasi.ro/opinii/a-locuit-cu-adevarat-eminescu-in-casa-pogor~ni4tu9 "A locuit cu adevărat Eminescu în Casa Pogor?"], in ''[[Ziarul de Iași]]'', August 26, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

By the close of his mandate in the Assembly, Pogor had involved himself in the [[Strousberg Affair]] dispute, suggesting (unsuccessfully) that ministers found guilty of misdeeds should have their revenue retained by the state.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolescu, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; The Catargiu cabinet was facing a [[motion of no confidence]] over its [[stamp act]] proposal, with Pogor and Carp working to keep the two debates separate.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolescu, pp. 143–144&lt;/ref&gt; He was again sent to the Assembly in the [[Romanian general election, 1875|1875 election]], during which the "Red" opposition ran as a consolidated [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal Party]] (PNL). During this term, Pogor supported the establishment of a [[Căile Ferate Române|public railways authority]], with compensation for other shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolescu, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the looming PNL threat, Pogor, who had also been reelected chairman of the Iași appellate court,&lt;ref name="gc437"/&gt; and N. Gane were absentee deputies, and were probably convinced that the Catargiu cabinet was about to crumble. Maiorescu, the acting Minister of Education and proponent of an unpopular education reform, was perplexed by their decision: "Gane and Pogor should present themselves in Bucharest ''immediately'' [Maiorescu's italics]! Are we going to engage in politics or not? Is there any solidarity between those of you in Iași and me?"&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (I), p. 267. See also Călinescu, p. 431&lt;/ref&gt; Their effective abandon contributed to Maiorescu's resignation in January 1876, then to the arrival in power of a PNL ministry, surprisingly headed by the formerly ultra-"White" Epureanu.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (I), pp. 267–269&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''Junimists'' were soundly defeated in the subsequent [[Romanian general election, 1876|elections of July 1876]].&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (I), p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; Pogor managed to preserve his seat in the new legislature, which voted on [[Romanian War of Independence|Romanian independence]] during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|War of '77]]. He was thus involved in parliamentary discussions about the thorny issue of antisemitic discrimination favored by the PNL: in early 1878, he was one of the few deputies who questioned the law preventing Romanian Jews from trading in distilled beverages.&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://resolver.kb.nl/resolve?urn=ddd:010873565:mpeg21:pdf "Bijvoegsel. Nationale vergadering van Rumenië"], in ''[[Nieuw Israëlietisch Weekblad]]'', April 4, 1878 (digitized by the [[National Library of the Netherlands]])&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside Carp, Gane, and Maiorescu, he enlisted as a member of the reserve militia (or Civic Guard) in Iași, thus serving alongside some members of the Free and Independent Faction.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Totu, ''Garda civică din România 1848—1884'', p. 251. Bucharest: [[Editura Militară]], 1976.  {{OCLC|3016368}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1878, Pogor, who headed the Iași [[credit union]], was also elected to the City Council.&lt;ref name="gc437"/&gt; These was a time of great disorder among the "Whites", who were hard pressed to come up with an answer to the PNL's success. When it seemed that the "White" daily, ''[[Timpul]]'', was about to go under, Pogor joined up with the other ''Junimists'' in making peace with Catargiu, and in gathering funds for the newspaper—their assembly was the first step toward fusing together the major "White" factions.&lt;ref name="sbcadre"&gt;{{ro icon}} Silvia Bocancea, [http://www.sferapoliticii.ro/sfera/162/art04-Bocancea.php "Tribulațiile unui partid de cadre.

===Conservative Party man, Buddhist scholar, and Iași Mayor===
Pogor was again a ''prelecțiuni'' guest in 1875, by which time the younger ''Junimists'' ([[A. D. Xenopol]], [[Vasile Burlă]] etc.) had taken over the task of popular education. Pogor and I. Negruzzi tacitly accepted their supremacy, and, like them, lectured on topics exclusively linked to the concept of national identity.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (I), pp. 23–24&lt;/ref&gt; Each speaker was to concentrate on one aspect of historical [[acculturation]], from the Romanian contact with [[Byzantine Greeks]] to the reception of German influences, but the schedule was only partly respected.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Leonidas Rados, [http://www.history-cluj.ro/Istorie/anuare/AnuarBaritHistorica2008/07%20Leonidas.pdf "Influența greacă în disputele istoriografice din spațiul românesc în a doua jumătate a secolului XIX"], in ''Anuarul Institutului de Istorie George Barițiu, Series Historica'', 2008, [[Romanian Academy]], [http://www.history-cluj.ro/ George Barițiu Institute of History], p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Prelecţiuni populare 1879-80.png|thumb|250px|Pogor's handwritten program for the ''prelecțiuni'' program of 1879 and 1880. He sets aside for himself lectures on [[Buddhism]] (''Bud'haïsmul'') and Christianity]] 
Pursuing his interest in Schopenhauer's work, Pogor discovered the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] worldview. By the early 1880s, his study of Buddhist concepts had become more systematic: he read the scholarly works of [[Eugène Burnouf]], then popularized Buddhist principles in a ''Convorbiri Literare'' series (1883–1884).&lt;ref name="tv81"/&gt; With Maiorescu, and using German intermediaries, Pogor helped Romanians become acquainted with [[Classical Chinese poetry]]. While Maiorescu gave his touch to ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'', Pogor rendered an anonymous (and possibly irretrievable) piece, called "Lover Submitting".&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Constantin Lupeanu, [http://revistaramuri.ro/index.php?id=1303&amp;editie=51&amp;autor=de%20Constantin%20Lupeanu "Interferențe culturale"], in ''[[Ramuri]]'', Nr. 10/2010&lt;/ref&gt; In tandem, he looked into [[Sanskrit literature]], translating translations from [[Amaru Shataka|Amaru]].&lt;ref name="dmmodelul"/&gt;

On February 3, 1880, Pogor was one of 88 "White" spokesmen who signed the founding document of Romania's [[Conservative Party (Romania, 1880–1918)|Conservative Party]].&lt;ref name="sbcadre"/&gt; The [[Kingdom of Romania]], proclaimed in 1881, was thus effectively ruled by a [[two-party system]]. For three non-consecutive terms, Pogor was the Conservative and ''Junimist'' Mayor of Iași: February 10, 1880 to April 26, 1881; June 7, 1888 to June 7, 1890; May 30, 1892 to November 11, 1894.&lt;ref name="spirituljun"/&gt; He entered history for his creative approach to the [[Romanianization]] measures, specifically those which required all shops to have Romanian-language signs. Although this resonated with the ''Junimist'' idea of standardizing the language, and even though the Moldavian retailers were on the verge of rebelling, Pogor is said to have had "great fun" dealing with the consequences.&lt;ref name="lppruteanu"&gt;{{ro icon}} Liviu Papuc, [https://web.archive.org/web/20140714183759/http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/PAPUCoct.html "V. Pogor și legea Pruteanu"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', October 2002&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed that all shops still carrying non-essential foreign words be taxed at three times the official rate.&lt;ref name="romlitlegi"&gt;{{ro icon}} Reporter, [http://www.romlit.ro/index.pl/n_jurul_unei_legi "Întâlnirile ''României Literare'': În jurul unei legi"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 44/2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural history preserves his dialogue with a Jewish merchant, who told him that Romanian had no assimilated word for "liqueurs"; Pogor spontaneously approximated an equivalent, ''licheruri''&lt;ref name="gc437"/&gt; (or even its current form, ''lichioruri'').&lt;ref name="lppruteanu"/&gt; Instead of the French term ''parfumerie'' ("perfume retailer"), he suggested ''parfumeraie''&lt;ref name="romlitlegi"/&gt; or ''parfumăraie''.&lt;ref name="lppruteanu"/&gt; Chaos followed, and the Romanianization campaign was abandoned. In the end, only one firm was touched the experiment, adopting the willingly absurd title of ''Șateaucs aucs fleurs''—a [[Macaronic language|macaronic]] rendition of the French ''Châteaux aux fleurs'' ("Flower Castles").&lt;ref name="lppruteanu"/&gt;

Pogor also took care of various other projects, ensuring that the city was compensated by the central government for having lost its status of state capital: 10 million [[Romanian leu|lei]] entered the city budget (6 of which were compensation from the Romanian state),&lt;ref name="rș239"&gt;Șuțu, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; and 8 neighboring estates were merged into the [[Iași metropolitan area|metropolitan area]].&lt;ref name="spirituljun"/&gt; He moved the City Hall into [[Roznovanu Palace]], ordering works to begin on the [[Iași National Theatre]], [[public bathing]] facilities, ten primary schools, and a new Abattoir.&lt;ref name="spirituljun"/&gt; Under Pogor, the streets of Iași were paved with [[macadam]], [[gas lighting]] was extended, and [[sanitation]] works were started.&lt;ref name="spirituljun"/&gt; ''Casa Pogor'' was the city's first electrically-lit building.&lt;ref name="lvvp-fiul"/&gt; His mandates saw the erection of statues honoring the pioneer Moldavian historian [[Miron Costin]] (1888)&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Radu Moțoc, [http://www.bvau.ro/docs/axislibri/AxisLibri6.pdf "Statuia lui Miron Costin (1633–1691), din Iași"], in the V. A.

===Later assignments===
Pogor was also a factor in the rapprochement between the Maiorescu ''Junimists'', who had again divorced the Catargiu Conservatives, and the moderate core of the PNL. Although Maiorescu himself rejected a ministerial appointment in the [[Ion Brătianu]] administration, he and the other self-styled "moderate conservatives" backed Brătianu's practical foreign policy. In February 1884, he promised that Pogor and other disgruntled Conservatives ([[Menelas Ghermani]], [[Gheorghe Manu]], [[Anastasie Triandafil]] etc.) would follow him in proclaiming conditional support for Brătianu.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (I), p. 294&lt;/ref&gt; Maiorescu thus saved the government from a likely recall, and was embraced by an enthusiastic Brătianu while the Assembly looked on.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (I), p. 295&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Junimist'' realignment gave the club a permanent representation at the epicenter of Romanian politics. Maiorescu received accolades from the cabinet and, in the [[Romanian general election, 1884|November 1884 election]], his men received nine seats in the Assembly, negotiated upon with the PNL, and three more for "independent" members; Pogor, Iacob Negruzzi, [[Ioan Mire Melik]] and [[Ioan Ianov]] were the ''Junimist'' deputies from Iași.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (I), pp. 297–300. See also Bacalbașa, p. 370&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by Maiorescu, Pogor was somewhat harder to win over by the PNL's cartel: "Even Pogor, who had favored the reunified opposition, has grown tired of their parties and feels that he should stand with us".&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (I), p. 298&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Junimists''{{'}} ambitions were frustrated by Brătianu only months after the election, when he still refused to include members of the club into his administration. ''Junimea'' reverted to independent politics, its conflict with the PNL exacerbated by a personal dispute between Maiorescu and National Liberal politico [[Eugeniu Stătescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (I), pp. 300–302&lt;/ref&gt; Pogor still suggested that ''Junimea'' should back the anti-PNL "United Opposition", betting Maiorescu that the latter would be called into power by the monarch. Maiorescu won this challenge: in early 1888, after a bloody incident in the Assembly sabotaged all communication between the two main parties, Carol appointed Th. Rosetti as Romanian Premier, and an all-''Junimist'' cabinet was in power for just under a year.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (I), pp. 309–312&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1888, alongside [[Dimitrie Ghica-Comănești]] and Ilariu R. Isvoranu, Pogor negotiated an alliance with the mainline Conservatives, allowing Rosetti to secure his office.&lt;ref&gt;"O pagină de istorie", in ''[[Epoca (Romania)|Epoca]]'', February 8 (20), 1889, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Romanian general election, October 1888|election of October]], Pogor did not rally with the Conservative–''Junimist'' caucus, and joined the dissident Liberals of [[Dimitrie Brătianu]], winning at [[ballotage]] for Iași County, Second College.&lt;ref&gt;"Resultatul alegerii colegiului II din Iași", in ''[[Epoca (Romania)|Epoca]]'', October 15 (27), 1888, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; He also continued to be listed as a ''Junimist'', and took another seat in the race for the First College.&lt;ref&gt;"Rezultatul scrutinului de balotagiu. Colegiul I-u al Camerei", in ''[[Epoca (Romania)|Epoca]]'', October 21 (November 2), 1888, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Rosetti's cabinet was by then supported by the Conservatives, but fell when a Conservative deputy, [[Nicolae Moret Blaremberg]], stirred political conflicts by proposing to indict the PNL's former governing team—such a project was regarded by Rosetti and the ''Junimists'' as entirely demagogic.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (I), p. 315&lt;/ref&gt; Both Pogor and Maiorescu were also partly responsible for the PNL's return to power: they abstained form voting against the [[motion of no confidence]] which toppled Rosetti.&lt;ref&gt;"Votul de ierĭ", in ''[[România Liberă]]'', April 1 (13), 1888, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1889 to 1890, during the ''Junimists''{{'}} reestablishment as an independent party, and again after the [[Romanian general election, 1891|1891 election]], Pogor was Vice President of the Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, pp. 436, 437, 441&lt;/ref&gt; As Panu recalls, he was making a mockery of this assignment: he doodled caricatures of his colleagues, pulled pranks on them "just like in school", and satirized parliamentary procedures with parody statements (such as "the motion has been defeated with a crushing minority").&lt;ref name="gc441"/&gt; In the early 1890s, he was firmly committed to the Conservative Party, and served on its Iași committee—alongside Ianov, [[Grigore Sturdza]], [[A. C. Cuza]], [[Alecu D. Holban]], [[Nicolae Culianu]], and [[Petru Th. Missir]].&lt;ref&gt;Șuțu, pp. 1–3&lt;/ref&gt; Pogor was also drafted into the panel which negotiated an alliance with the [[Radical Party (Romania)|Radical Party]] before the [[Romanian local elections, 1895|county elections of September 1895]], and then into the nomination committee for the [[Romanian general election, 1895|general election]].&lt;ref&gt;Șuțu, pp. 4–6&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1897, Pogor and his ''Junimist'' colleagues again withdrew from the Conservative caucus, only to return before the [[Romanian local elections, 1899|1899 county election]], in which Pogor and Missir stood as candidates.&lt;ref&gt;Șuțu, pp. 13–14&lt;/ref&gt; By November 1900, when the Conservatives and ''Junimists'' finally merged into one party, Pogor was again the chairman of the credit union. He also became a member of Iași's Conservative Party steering committee, involving himself in strategy planning ahead of the [[Romanian general election, 1901|1901 general election]].&lt;ref&gt;Șuțu, pp. 18–20, 113&lt;/ref&gt; Having poorly invested his own sizable fortune, he found himself pestered by his many creditors.&lt;ref name="gc437"/&gt; One of his biographers, Liviu Papuc, noted that, overall, the first ''Junimist'' generation ran into financial trouble, and that Pogor ended his career on an "even score" with life.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Liviu Papuc, [https://web.archive.org/web/20131109115143/http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/PAPUCdec6.html "Ioan M.

==Work==

===Anti-dogmatic ''Junimism'' and Parnassian poetry===
Pogor's anti-dogmatism precluded his engagement on the more serious side of ''Junimism''. When approving of ''Junimea''{{'}}s name, he staged a fake baptism, asking those present to pledge that they would "renounce pedantry".&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (I), p. 18; Vianu, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; His philosophical dilettantism was still influential at ''Junimea'': I. Negruzzi recalled that, during the club's sessions, Pogor systematically prevented historians and philologists from reporting on their concrete finds, and only listened to the generic conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; As Vianu notes, Pogor himself was virtually incapable of "choosing" between the many subjects that interested him at any one time.&lt;ref name="tv81"/&gt; It is possible that Pogor is the author of an anonymous poem celebrating his own idleness and contrariness:
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|ro|Simt o mare fericire de-a sta singur în tăcere,
Deși stricta convenință mă silește-a fi la bal,
Căci sunt leneș de natură și mă legăn cu plăcere
Într-o dulce somnolență pe al visurilor val.}}&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, pp. 437–438&lt;/ref&gt;
|
I will get my greatest joy sitting here alone and quiet,
While that strictest social standard wants me to attend a ball,
For I'm lazy by my nature and will loll down here with pleasure
Carried by sweet drowsiness, rocking on the waves of dreams.}}

While the ''caracudă'' rejoiced, the club's more idealistic visitors were disturbed by Pogor's antics. On these grounds, Pogor fully supported only the most subversive and eccentric manifestations of ''Junimist'' literature. He was the only one in the group not to approve of poet laureate [[Vasile Alecsandri]]. Although he later helped build the Alecsandri monument, he once shouted out that Alecsandri had "a grocer's taste" in art.&lt;ref&gt;Cioculescu, p. 278&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Pogor loved the work of peasant storyteller [[Ion Creangă]], and, to the indignation of some other club members, encouraged him to read aloud from his [[erotic literature]] series, "the corrosives".&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (II), pp. 230, 231, 236; Vianu, p. 211&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Pogor welcomed in and shed a spotlight on the cynical, streetwise, humorist [[Ion Luca Caragiale]], who was a passing guest at ''Junimea''. According to Șerban Cioculescu, Pogor differed from Eminescu in that he "freely enjoyed [Caragiale's] charming spontaneity and temperamental zigzags."&lt;ref&gt;Cioculescu, pp. 5–6&lt;/ref&gt; Pogor's nonconformism could target even the group's doyen, Maiorescu. He coined the disparaging nickname ''Muierescu'' (from ''muiere'', "broad", in reference to his colleague's alleged sexual misconduct).&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Eugen Lungu]], [http://www.sud-est.md/numere/20061123/article_4/ "Istorie și intimitate"], in ''[[Revista Sud-Est]]'', Nr. 4/2006&lt;/ref&gt;

His own work in poetry was reviewed with little sympathy by later critics and historians. They dismiss his original pieces as "anodyne"&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (I), p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; and not up to the test of time,&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, pp. 397, 437&lt;/ref&gt; although, as Rudolf Șuțu argues, they too helped engineer a [[literary language]].&lt;ref&gt;Șuțu, pp. 239–240&lt;/ref&gt; Pogor was a Romanian [[Parnassianism|Parnassian]], reworking classical themes and seeking formal purity,&lt;ref name="tv82"&gt;Vianu, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; and was especially influenced by Baudelaire and by [[Théophile Gautier]].&lt;ref name="gc437"/&gt; His verse includes an homage to ''[[Melencolia I]]'', the famous engraving by [[Albrecht Dürer]]—similarly titled ''Melancolie''. George Călinescu focuses his comments on the poem's atmospheric quality, noting that its "French structure" is exceptional in the ''Junimist'' context. The other ''Junimea'' bards, he suggests, still favored "accessible" poetry of the [[Young Germany]] kind.&lt;ref name="gc437"/&gt; Beyond the Parnassian poems, Pogor applied his wit (or, as critic [[Cosmin Ciotloș]] calls it, "unbelievably malicious spirit") to the realm of parody. His joke poem, ''Vedenia'' ("The Apparition"), managed to impress rival Eminescu, who made the effort of transcribing it in his records of ''Junimea'' meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Cosmin Ciotloș]], [http://www.zf.ro/ziarul-de-duminica/vremuri-parodice-3311325/ "Vremuri parodice"], in ''[[Ziarul Financiar]]'', October 14, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Pogor's translation also produced mixed results. Scholar [[Dan Mănucă]] believes that the Romanian author found Baudelaire to be "more of a picturesque eccentric and, certainly, not at all a literary innovator"; for this reason, he only looked to Baudelaire's tamer writings, that excluded "scandal".&lt;ref name="dmmodelul"/&gt; Pogor's version of Hugo's "[[La Légende des siècles|Conscience]]" made a positive impression, and was quoted by [[Grigore Pletosu]] in his [[propaedeutics]] to philosophy (1899).&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Nicu, [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/web/bibdigit/periodice/transilvania/1899/BCUCLUJ_FP_279996_1899_030_009.pdf "Șciință literatură și artă. Bibliografie. Literatura didactică"], in ''Transilvania'', Nr. 9/1899, p. 305 (digitized by the [[Babeș-Bolyai University]] [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/ Transsylvanica Online Library])&lt;/ref&gt; Pogor's other projects were often panned by experts. Classicist Nicolae Laslo sees Pogor's version of Horatian verse as mostly failed, "with lots of gaucheries and naivetes."&lt;ref name="nlhoratiu537"/&gt; The Pogor–Skelitti rendition of Goethe, although verified by the two ''Junimists'' through previous French versions ([[Gérard de Nerval]], Henri Blaze),&lt;ref name="dmmodelul"/&gt; is also considered problematic. [[German studies|Germanist]] Corina Jiva indicates that they had only a vague understanding of the German words they translated into Romanian.&lt;ref name="cjnoica"/&gt; Pogor may have been aware of the shortcomings, since, after Skelitti died, ''Convorbiri'' issued a second version of ''Faust I''. It modified the first edition, and only credited one author: Pogor.&lt;ref name="dmmodelul"/&gt;

===Pogor on religion and nationality===
Vasile Pogor's roots were in [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian Orthodoxy]]: his father was ''[[ktitor]]'' of the Misești Church.&lt;ref name="gc92"/&gt; Pogor Jr was himself a student of Christian history, but his main focus was on [[Judaism]], the [[Hebrew Bible]], and the Christian [[Old Testament]]. He kept detailed notes on the minutiae of biblical lore, making notes about [[Gog and Magog]], the ''[[Kinnor]]'', the ''[[Purim]]'' etc.&lt;ref name="gc437, 1000"&gt;Călinescu, pp. 437, 1000&lt;/ref&gt; Albeit fascinated by Jewish and Buddhist practices, the poet was mainly a [[Freethought|Freethinker]], seen by Vianu as "of a Voltairian and [[Positivism|Positivist]] extraction."&lt;ref name="tv81"/&gt; The theories of [[Auguste Comte]] and positivist language in general were welcomed by Pogor and the other core ''Junimists'' even though, as Zigu Ornea notes, the leading exponents of Positivist discourse were secondary ''Junimists'' ([[Nicolae Xenopol]], [[George Panu]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (I), p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Pogor attacked religion as a lifeless institution, as seen in his poem ''Magnitudo parri'', credited by some as his masterpiece.&lt;ref name="tv81"/&gt; For Pogor, a swallow's effort to raise its offspring is more worthy of attention than the [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine church]] looming over its nest:
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|ro|Cântarea păsăruicii e bolta cea divină!
Religiuni, popoare pot a se nimici;
Lipsească chiar credința sub bolta bizantină —
::Altarul este-aci!}}&lt;ref name="tv82"/&gt;
|
The tiny bird's own singing is a vault by God!
Vanish religions, peoples;
Perish faith itself under the Byzantine arch —
::That altar, it is here!}}

Historian [[Balázs Trencsényi]] argues that Vasile Pogor, like the other ''Junimist'' doyens, engineered "an [[Epistemology|epistemological]] break" with the predominating school of [[Romantic nationalism]], as well as with the 18th-century ''[[philosophes]]'', introducing instead Positivist and [[Sociological naturalism|naturalistic]] approaches to social science.&lt;ref&gt;Trencsényi, pp. 156–157&lt;/ref&gt; Taking his inspiration from Buckle, Pogor leaned toward [[environmental determinism]] as an explanation of historical processes. "Warmer" areas, he claimed, were predisposed to [[despotism]], no matter how advanced there were materially. Trencsényi focuses on Pogor's proposal to separate the material and spiritual growth of a nation, thus contextualizing the ''Junimist'' critique of Romania's [[Westernization]]: "[Pogor's views] served as a critical perspective to judge societies which reached a certain level of socio-economic modernity without an overall mental adaptation to the Western patterns."&lt;ref&gt;Trencsényi, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;

Although not explicitly extended to the Romanian paradigm, Pogor's introduction to Buckle formed an integral part of the ''Junimist'' discourse about [[nation building]]. As Ornea notes, Pogor struck the typical ''Junimist'' note with his critique of revolutionary doctrines, in pronouncements such as: "had politicians not been meddling in to prevent the natural flow of things, progress would have occurred at a quicker pace".&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (I), pp. 167–168&lt;/ref&gt; Also according to Ornea, the study endures as both a relevant contribution to ''Junimism'' and a facet of [[Romanian philosophy]] in the 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (I), pp. 60, 157, 167–168&lt;/ref&gt; Trencsényi sees a direct link between the survival of "despotism" in post-modernization, as surveyed by Buckle and Pogor, and the ''Junimists''{{'}} rejection of Romania's top-to-bottom Westernization by the liberals. Pogor's vague critique is expanded upon by Th. Rosetti. Rosetti's essays postulate the unrelenting "primitivism" of Romanian society. The liberals stand accused of not having promoted a gradual, "authentic", modernization of Romanian institutions, and of having imposed their "hybrid forms" on the Romanian psyche.&lt;ref&gt;Trencsényi, pp. 157–158&lt;/ref&gt;

Maiorescu himself suggested that Pogor's Bucklean discovery facilitated ''Junimism''{{'}}s transformation into a socio-political movement. Other such influences came from Schopenhauer, and from [[John Stuart Mill]]'s ''[[The Subjection of Women|Subjection of Women]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (I), p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; Buckle influenced the main ''Junimist'' historical narratives, from Maiorescu's historical lectures to A. D. Xenopol's own ''History of Civilizations''.&lt;ref name="arideologia13"/&gt; Pogor's own belief, namely that Romania was essentially peripheral to [[Culture of Europe|European civilization]], was not readily welcomed by the [[National conservatism|national conservative]] faction at ''Junimea''. A glimpse of this is provided by a maverick ''Junimist'', George Panu, as a purported clash between Pogor and the [[Nativism (politics)|autochthonist]] Eminescu. According to Panu, Pogor openly ridiculed national historians: "What's all this about the history of the Romanians? Can't you see that we have no history? A people which has no literature, art, or past civilization—such a people is not worth the attention of historians... At a time when France could produce [[Molière]] and [[Jean Racine|Racine]] the Romanians were in a state of utter barbarism."&lt;ref name="lb39"&gt;[[Lucian Boia]], ''History and Myth in Romanian Consciousness'', p. 39. Budapest &amp; New York City: [[Central European University Press]], 2001.  {{ISBN|963-9116-96-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eminescu retorted, promptly and (Panu notes) violently: "What you call barbarism, I call the settled wisdom of a people that develops in conformity with its own genius and shuns any mixing with foreigners"&lt;ref name="lb39"/&gt; (alternatively translated as: "the wisdom of a nation, which progresses according to the rhythm of its own genius, away from any foreign interference").&lt;ref name="amd106"&gt;Ana Maria Dobre, "Revisiting Historical and Cultural Myths and Clichés. The Romanian Case of Nation State Building", in [[Raymond Detrez]], Barbara Segaert (eds.), ''Europe and the Historical Legacies in the Balkans. Europe Plurielle – Multiple Europes, 40'', p. 106. Brussels etc.: [[Peter Lang (publishing company)|Peter Lang]], 2008.  {{ISBN|978-90-5201-374-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Factual or merely symbolic, this showdown has been interpreted by later historians as a good introduction to the conflicting perspectives on Romanian nationhood. In 1997, scholar [[Lucian Boia]] suggested: "What we find summarized in these few lines is the great dilemma which has divided Romanian society for the last two centuries."&lt;ref name="lb39"/&gt; Political scientist Ana Maria Dobre, who connects Pogor's supposed comments with Maiorescu's dismissal of early Romanian history as "oriental barbarism", introduces the Pogor–Eminescu exchange as "a profound dichotomy opposing the defenders of the traditional, specific national values of organization and the supporters of an unconditional modernisation and adaptation to the occidental model in order to depart from a rudimentary type of society."&lt;ref name="amd106"/&gt;

==Legacy==
Visual portrayals of Pogor include a sketch by [[Eugen N. Ghika-Budești]], first published in 1895. It shows the ''Junimist'' relaxing among lewd [[devadasi]]s, "leaving behind him the boredom that is the Vice President's chair".&lt;ref name="msrsiècle"&gt;{{ro icon}} Mihai Sorin Rădulescu, [http://www.romlit.ro/index.pl/un_pictor_fin_de_sicle "Un pictor fin de siècle"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 17/2009&lt;/ref&gt; A posthumous bust, the work of Iași sculptor [[Dan Covătaru]], was also exhibited in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Valentin Ciucă, [http://insemnariiesene.ro/insemnari_iesene-nr.2%28octombrie%292009.pdf "Resursele vitale ale sculpturii..."], in ''Însemnări Ieșene'', Nr. 2/2009, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; In literature, Eminescu's 1878 parody of the ''[[Odyssey]]'', referencing a moment of ''Junimist'' crisis, portrays Pogor as "the swineherd Pogoros" (the club's own [[Eumaeus]]).&lt;ref&gt;Traian Diaconescu, "Antropomorfism. Discurs parodic și funcții ludice", in Viorica S. Constantinescu, Cornelia Viziteu, Lucia Cifor (eds.), ''Studii Eminescologice, 13'', p. 28. Cluj-Napoca: Editura Clusium, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to his affectionate memoirs, Iacob Negruzzi also made Pogor the subject of an 1872 poem:
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|ro|Eu sunt eroul straniu cu locuința-n Iași,
De o statură mică, la minte prea poznaș,
Ce planuri urieșe și multe născocește
Dar vecinic din aceste nici unul nu-mplinește.}}&lt;ref name="gc437"/&gt;
|
I am that strange hero, and resident of Iași,
A man so small in stature, too impish is his mind,
Who will imagine plans so very grand and wide
But never does he manage to carry out just one.}}

Pogor's work as poet and theorist was largely forgotten by later generations. This was noted by ''Junimea'' anthologist [[Eugen Lovinescu]], who made the conscious effort of reviving the deterministic Parnassian, alongside other "minor ''Junimists''", to evidence "what they still have that's viable."&lt;ref name="arideologia13"/&gt; Pogor left one son, Vasile Panopol, a once-famous historiographer of Iași.&lt;ref name="msrsiècle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="icstr"&gt;{{ro icon}} Ioana Cioflâncă, [http://ieseanul.gandul.info/saptamanal/stralucirea-pierduta-a-strazii-lapusneanu-2609708 "Strălucirea pierdută a Străzii Lăpușneanu"], in ''[[Ieșeanul]]'', May 5, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Born out of wedlock, Panopol had a similar taste for pranks, and belonged to the infamous "black gang" of rebellious aristocrats.&lt;ref name="icstr"/&gt; While the Pogor book collection was on sale, and divided, soon after its owner died,&lt;ref name="tv81"/&gt; ''Casa Pogor'' survives as a major historical landmark of Iași. After the Moruzi purchase, it became the childhood home of Maria Moruzi's son by [[Ion I. C. Brătianu]], the renowned historian [[Gheorghe I. Brătianu]].&lt;ref name="cccasele4"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Lucian Nastasă, [http://www.history-cluj.ro/Istorie/cercet/Nastasa/SuveraniiUniversitatilorI.pdf ''"Suveranii" universităților românești.

In the late 1930s, Brătianu rented ''Casa Pogor'' to the Iași's Royal Commissioner, and, during [[World War II]], it was confiscated by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] representatives.&lt;ref name="cccasele4"/&gt; [[Nationalization in Romania|Nationalized]] during the first decades of [[Communist Romania]], it was refurbished by the state only after 1968.&lt;ref name="cccasele4"/&gt; It was ultimately created a museum in 1972&lt;ref name="cccasele4"/&gt; or 1973,&lt;ref name="Ornea I, p. 34"/&gt; and is a regional center of the [[Museum of Romanian Literature]] network (supervising other monuments, including, as of 1995, the Negruzzi Memorial House of [[Trifești, Iași|Trifești]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Constantin Coroiu, [http://www.romlit.ro/index.pl/n_satul_negruzzetilor "În satul Negruzzeștilor"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 33/2005&lt;/ref&gt; The main exhibit hall is mainly known for its Eminescu memorabilia, including the poet's [[death mask]].&lt;ref name="cccasele4"/&gt; Its tunnels and its halls have hosted art experiments, including an adaptation of [[Mircea Eliade]]'s ''[[Domnișoara Christina]]'' (1999),&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Mac Linscott Ricketts, [http://www.revistaorizont.ro/arhiva/martie2012.pdf "Spectacolul Eliade"], in ''[[Orizont]]'', Nr. 3/2012, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; an introduction to [[Music of Senegal|Senegalese music]] (2006),&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Claudia Craiu, [http://www.ziaruldeiasi.ro/pulsul-orasului/povesti-si-ritmuri-africane-astazi-la-casa-pogor~ni44pr "Povești și ritmuri africane, astăzi, la Casa Pogor"], in ''[[Ziarul de Iași]]'', October 19, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and a colloquium of the international [[avant-garde]] (2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Ion Cocora, [http://www.revistaluceafarul.ro/index.html?id=522&amp;editie=28 "Un pictor din mileniul trei"], in ''[[Luceafărul (magazine)|Luceafărul]]'', Nr. 26/2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Pogor has a following in the Romanian-speaking literary communities of [[Bessarabia]], most of which is now the independent state of [[Moldova]]. During the period of Soviet rule in Bessarabia (the [[Moldavian SSR]]), references to Romanian cultural assets were usually shunned; this changed in the late 1980s, when Bessarabian cultural magazines were allowed to republish samples of classical Romanian literature. ''Nistru'' journal inaugurated the trend in 1988, choosing Pogor as the first contributor to revive. According to Moldovan essayist Maria Șleahtițchi: "Why the magazine's editors should have selected such a minor writer is the stuff of rhetorical questions."&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Maria Șleahtițchi, [http://www.revista-discobolul.ro/ar/Discobol_2008_10_11_12.pdf "Pe marginea exilului: între mama si tata"], in ''Discobolul'', Nr. 130–131–132/2008, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Keith Chambers Guthrie''', [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] (1 August 1906 – 17 May 1981), usually cited as '''W. K. C. Guthrie''', was a Scottish [[classical scholar]], best known for his ''History of Greek Philosophy'', published in six volumes between 1962 and his death. He served as [[Laurence Professor of Ancient Philosophy]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] from 1952 to 1973 and as [[Master (college)|master]] of [[Downing College, Cambridge]] from 1957 to 1972.

==Early life and education==
Although of longstanding Scottish stock on both his father's and mother's side, Keith Guthrie was born and brought up in London where his father, Charles James Guthrie, pursued a career with the [[Westminster Bank]].

After attending [[Dulwich College]], Guthrie went up to [[Cambridge University]] in 1925, winning the Eric Evan Spicer scholarship to [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]]. He excelled in his studies, being supervised by, amongst others, [[Francis Cornford]] and [[A. S. F. Gow]], and was placed in the first class of both Parts of the [[Classical Tripos]], with distinction in Part II and the award of the Craven Prize.

After graduating he embarked on a postgraduate career at Trinity. He met his future wife, Adele Marion Ogilvy, while supervising her undergraduate studies in 1929–1930. She was an Australian, from [[Melbourne]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article4520042 Source]:&lt;br&gt;The engagement is announced of Adele Marion, second daughter of Mr. and Mrs  A. L. Ogilvy, of Shirley 470 St Kilda road, Melbourne, to Mr. W. K. C. Guthrie, fellow of Peterhouse College, Cambridge, lecturer  for Cambridge University in ancient philosophy, son of Mr. and Mrs. C. J. Guthrie of London.&lt;br&gt;''The Argus (Melbourne, Vic.,  Wednesday, 18 January 1933'')
&lt;/ref&gt; then studying at [[Newnham College]], [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]].  They married in 1933 and went on to have two children (one daughter and one son).

==Early career and World War Two==
In 1930 Guthrie left Trinity College to take up a Bye Fellowship at [[Peterhouse]], going on to become a full [[fellow]] in 1932. Between 1936–1937 he served as a university [[proctor]] and in 1939 was appointed as the [[Public Orator|university orator]], a position he held for eighteen years, responsible for delivering speeches in [[Latin language|Latin]] in honour of recipients of [[honorary doctorates]].

During the [[Second World War|war]] he exchanged scholarship for [[military service]] serving in the [[Intelligence Corps (United Kingdom)|Intelligence Corps]] between 1941 and 1945, based initially in London, then in [[St Albans]] and, from 1943, in [[Istanbul]], achieving the temporary rank of major.

==Postwar career==
Returning to Cambridge after the war, Guthrie was much in demand in his capacity as [[Cambridge University Orator|Orator]], called upon to deliver Latin [[encomia]] in honour of such dignitaries as [[Winston Churchill]], [[Clement Attlee]], [[Jan Smuts]], [[Jawaharlal Nehru|Nehru]], [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], [[William Slim, 1st Viscount Slim|Viscount Slim]] and [[Bernard Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|General Montgomery]].

In 1946 he was promoted to [[Reader (academic rank)|reader]] before becoming the third [[Laurence Professor of Ancient Philosophy]] in 1952, the year in which he became a [[Fellow of the British Academy]]. In 1950 he edited an edition of his mentor Cornford's essays under the title ''The Unwritten Philosophy''.

In 1957 he moved to his third Cambridge college when invited to become the master of [[Downing College]], where he would remain for the rest of his life. As master he took a full part in the administrative, cultural and social life of the college, occasionally [[preaching]] in the college chapel and supporting the undergraduate music club and boat club. He oversaw a rewriting of the college statutes and introduced a maximum term for a master of fifteen years, by which he chose voluntarily to abide although it did not apply to him.

In 1956 he was approached by the Syndics of the [[Cambridge University Press]] to write a history of [[ancient philosophy]]. The first volumes, devoted to the [[pre-Socratics]], of what would be his life's [[masterpiece|magnum opus]] were published to high acclaim in 1962 and 1964. The work continued while serving as master of Downing and became his life's full mission after retiring from that position in 1972. The venture remained, however, unfinished at his death aged 74 in 1981 the year in which he published the sixth volume in the series, devoted to [[Aristotle]].

As a philosopher Guthrie followed in the tradition of [[F. M. Cornford|Cornford]] in believing that ancient philosophers should be read and interpreted against their own historical background, rather than engaged with, as has been the practice of later generations of classical philosophers, in the context of the whole canon of philosophy both ancient and modern.

'''''When God Was a Woman''''' is the U.S. title of a 1976  book by sculptor and art historian [[Merlin Stone]].  It was published earlier in the United Kingdom as '''''The Paradise Papers: The Suppression of Women's Rites'''''. It has been translated into French as ''Quand Dieu était femme'' (SCE-Services Complets d'Edition, Québec, Canada) in 1978, into Dutch as ''Eens was God als Vrouw belichaamd – De onderdrukking van de riten van de vrouw'' in  1979, into German as ''Als Gott eine Frau war'' in 1989 and into Italian as ''Quando Dio era una donna'' in 2011.

Stone spent approximately ten years engaged in research of the lesser-known, sometimes hidden depictions of the Sacred Feminine, from European and Middle Eastern societies, in preparation to complete this work. In the book, she describes these archetypal reflections of women as leaders, sacred entities and benevolent matriarchs, and also weaves them into a larger picture of how our modern societies grew to the present imbalanced state. Possibly the most controversial/debated claim in the book is Stones' interpretation of how peaceful, benevolent matriarchal society and Goddess-reverent traditions (including [[Ancient Egypt]]) were attacked, undermined and ultimately destroyed almost completely, by the ancient tribes including [[Hebrews]] and later the early [[Christians]]. To do this they attempted to destroy any visible symbol of the sacred feminine, including artwork, sculpture, weavings and literature. The reason being that they wanted the Sacred Masculine to become the dominant power, and rule over women and Goddess energies. According to Stone, the Torah or Old Testament was in many ways a male attempt to re-write the story of human society, changing feminine symbolism to masculine.

The book is now seen as having been instrumental in the modern rise of [[feminist theology]] in the 1970s to 1980s, along with authors such as [[Elizabeth Gould Davis]], [[Riane Eisler]] and [[Marija Gimbutas]].  Some have related it as well to the work of authors  [[Margaret Murray]] and [[Robert Graves]].
