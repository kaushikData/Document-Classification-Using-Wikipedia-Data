'''Badenia''' ({{IPAc-en|b|ə|ˈ|d|iː|n|i|ə}} {{respell|bə|DEE|nee-ə}}; [[minor planet designation]]: '''333 Badenia''') is a large [[C-type asteroid|C-type]] (carbonaceous-type) [[asteroid]] in the outer [[asteroid belt]].

It was discovered by [[Max Wolf]] on 22 August 1892 in [[Heidelberg]]. It was the first asteroid to receive a temporary designation.

A '''building,''' or '''edifice,''' is a [[Built structure|structure]] with a [[roof]] and&lt;ref name="Egenhofer" /&gt; [[wall]]s standing more or less permanently in one place, such as a [[house]] or [[factory]].&lt;ref name="Egenhofer"/&gt; Buildings come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and functions, and have been adapted throughout history for a wide number of factors, from [[building material]]s available, to weather conditions, land prices, ground conditions, specific uses, and aesthetic reasons. To better understand the term ''building'' compare the list of [[nonbuilding structure]]s.

Buildings serve several societal needs – primarily as shelter from weather, security, living space, privacy, to store belongings, and to comfortably live and work. A building as a shelter represents a physical division of the [[:Category:Human habitats|human habitat]] (a place of comfort and safety) and the ''outside'' (a place that at times may be harsh and harmful).

Ever since the first [[cave painting]]s, buildings have also become objects or canvasses of much artistic expression. In recent years, interest in [[sustainable]] planning and building practices has also become an intentional part of the design process of many new buildings.

The word ''building'' is both a noun and a verb: the structure itself and the act of making it. As a noun, a building is 'a structure that has a roof and walls and stands more or less permanently in one place';&lt;ref name="Egenhofer"&gt;{{cite book|author=Max J. Egenhofer|title=Geographic Information Science: Second International Conference, GIScience 2002, Boulder, CO, USA, September 25–28, 2002.

In the broadest interpretation a [[fence]] or wall is a building.&lt;ref&gt;Building def. 2. Whitney, William Dwight, and Benjamin E. Smith. ''The Century dictionary and cyclopedia''. vol. 1. New York: Century Co., 1901. 712. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the word ''structure'' is used more broadly than ''building'' including natural and man-made formations&lt;ref&gt;Structure. def. 2. ''Merriam-Webster's dictionary of synonyms: a dictionary of discriminated synonyms with antonyms and analogous and contrasted words''.. Springfield, Mass: Merriam-Webster, 1984. 787. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; and does not necessarily have walls. Structure is more likely to be used for a fence. [[Russell Sturgis|Sturgis' Dictionary]] included that "[building] differs from [[architecture]] in excluding all idea of artistic treatment; and it differs from [[construction]] in the idea of excluding scientific or highly skilful treatment."&lt;ref&gt;Building. def 1. Sturgis, Russell. ''A dictionary of architecture and building: biographical, historical, and descriptive''. vol. 1. New York: The Macmillan Co. ;, 1901. 2236. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; As a verb, building is the act of construction.

''Structural height'' in technical usage is the height to the highest architectural detail on building from street-level. Depending on how they are classified, spires and masts may or may not be included in this height. Spires and masts used as antennas are not generally included. The definition of a ''low-rise vs. a high-rise'' building is a matter of debate, but generally three storeys or less is considered low-rise.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Francis Wendt and Alan Robert Cerf (1979), ''Real estate investment analysis and taxation'', McGraw-Hill, p. 210&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
{{Main|List of building types}}

[[File:Tenements in Bruntsfield, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|A block of tenements (apartments) in Bruntsfield, Edinburgh, Scotland]]

=== Residential ===
{{main|List of human habitation forms}}

Single-family residential buildings are most often called [[house]]s or [[home]]s. Residential buildings containing more than one dwelling unit are called a [[Duplex (building)|duplex]], [[apartment]] building to differentiate them from 'individual' houses. A [[condominium]] is an apartment that the occupant owns rather than rents. Houses may also be built in pairs ([[semi-detached]]), in terraces where all but two of the houses have others either side; apartments may be built round courtyards or as rectangular blocks surrounded by a piece of ground of varying sizes. Houses which were built as a single dwelling may later be divided into apartments or [[bedsitter]]s; they may also be converted to another use e.g. an office or a shop.

Building types may range from [[Hut (dwelling)|hut]]s to multimillion-dollar high-rise [[apartment block]]s able to house thousands of people. Increasing settlement density in buildings (and smaller distances between buildings) is usually a response to high ground prices resulting from many people wanting to live close to work or similar attractors. Other common [[building material]]s are brick, concrete or combinations of either of these with stone.

Residential buildings have different names for their use depending if they are seasonal include [[holiday cottage]] (vacation home) or [[timeshare]]; size such as a [[cottage]] or [[great house]]; value such as a [[shack]] or [[mansion]]; manner of construction such as a [[log home]] or [[mobile home]]; proximity to the ground such as [[Earth sheltering|earth sheltered]] house, [[stilt house]], or [[tree house]]. Also if the residents are in need of special care such as a [[nursing home]], [[orphanage]] or [[prison]]; or in group housing like [[barracks]] or [[dormitory|dormitories]].

Historically many people lived in communal buildings called [[longhouse]]s, smaller dwellings called [[pit-house]]s and houses combined with barns sometimes called [[housebarn]]s.

Buildings are defined to be substantial, permanent structures so other dwelling forms such as [[houseboat]]s, [[yurt]]s, and [[motorhome]]s are [[dwelling]]s but not buildings.

=== Multi-storey ===
A multi-storey is a building that has multiple floors.
Sydney is a city with many multi story buildings:
One suburb which has been notorious for poor construction is Lane Cove.   
Many overseas investors have been sucked in a and bought poorly built buildings.

=== Complex ===
Sometimes a group of inter-related (and possibly inter-connected) builds are referred to as a complex – for example a ''[[housing complex]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lincolnshirelive.co.uk/plans-to-convert-former-housing-complex-into-flats/story-30042482-detail/story.html|title=plans to convert housing complex|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170110125715/http://www.lincolnshirelive.co.uk/plans-to-convert-former-housing-complex-into-flats/story-30042482-detail/story.html#|archivedate=2017-01-10|df=|access-date=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''educational complex'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.isye.gatech.edu/about/maps-directions/isye-building-complex|title=isye building complex|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170103001851/https://www.isye.gatech.edu/about/maps-directions/isye-building-complex|archivedate=2017-01-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''hospital complex'', etc.

== Creation ==
The practice of designing, constructing, and operating buildings is most usually a collective effort of different groups of [[professional]]s and [[Tradesperson|trades]]. Depending on the size, complexity, and purpose of a particular building project, the project team may include:

* A [[real estate developer]] who secures [[funding]] for the project;
* One or more financial institutions or other investors that provide the funding
* Local planning and code authorities
* A [[Quantity surveyor|Surveyor]] who performs an ALTA/ACSM and construction surveys throughout the project;

Any building requires a certain general amount of internal infrastructure to function, which includes such elements like heating / cooling, power and telecommunications, water and wastewater etc. Especially in [[commercial building]]s (such as offices or factories), these can be extremely intricate systems taking up large amounts of space (sometimes located in separate areas or double floors / false ceilings) and constitute a big part of the regular maintenance required.

=== Conveying systems ===

Systems for [[transport]] of people within buildings:

* [[Elevator]]
* [[Escalator]]
* [[Moving sidewalk]] (horizontal and inclined)

Systems for transport of people between interconnected buildings:

* [[Skyway]]
* [[Underground city]]

[[Image:CosmographiaeIntroductio1.jpg|130 px|left|thumb|Title page of ''Cosmographiae Introductio'']]
'''''Cosmographiae Introductio''''' ("Introduction to [[Cosmography]]"; [[Saint-Dié-des-Vosges|Saint-Dié]], 1507) was a book published in 1507 to accompany [[Martin Waldseemüller]]'s printed globe and wall-map (''[[Universalis Cosmographia]]''), which were the first appearance of the name '[[Americas|America]]'.  Waldseemüller’s maps and book, along with his 1513 edition of [[Ptolemy]]’s ''[[Geographia (Ptolemy)|Geography]]'', were very influential and widely copied at the time.

[[Image:Cosmographiae Introductio America Reference.jpg|300 px|right|thumb|That part of the page of the 1507 (September) edition of the ''Cosmographiae Introductio'' in which the name of America is proposed for the New World. &lt;small&gt;From ''Narrative and critical history of America, Volume 2'' by Justin Winsor.&lt;/small&gt;]]

It is widely held to have been written by [[Matthias Ringmann]] although some historians attribute it to Waldseemüller himself. The book includes the reason for using the name America in the wall map and the globe, and contains a Latin translation of the four journeys of [[Amerigo Vespucci]] as an appendix.

The full title of the book is: ''Cosmographiae introductio cum quibusdam geometriae ac astronomiae principiis ad eam rem necessariis. Insuper quatuor Americi Vespucii navigationes. Universalis Cosmographiae descriptio tam in solido quam plano, eis etiam insertis, quae Ptholomaeo ignota a nuperis reperta sunt.''

(translation: ''Introduction to Cosmography With Certain Necessary Principles of Geometry and Astronomy To which are added The Four Voyages of Amerigo Vespucci A Representation of the Entire World, both in the Solid and Projected on the Plane, Including also lands which were Unknown to Ptolemy, and have been Recently Discovered'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cosmographiæ introductio of Martin Waldseemüller in facsimile, followed by the Four voyages of Amerigo Vespucci, with their translation into English |url= https://archive.org/details/cosmographiintr00waldgoog|accessdate=2011-06-14 |year=1907 |editor= Charles G. Herbermann|publisher=The U.S. Catholic Historical Society |location=New York }}. Alternative translations have been proposed e.g. John Hessler, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Waldseemuller map 2.jpg|thumb|250 px|''Universalis Cosmographia'' (map of 1507)]]
The map of the world in 1507, entitled ''Universalis cosmographia secundum Ptholomaei traditionem et Americi Vespucii aliorumque lustrationes'', was published in an edition of 1000 copies, of which it seems only a single copy survives. The surviving copy was found in the library of Prince von Waldburg-Wolfegg-Waldsee in the Castle of [[Wolfegg]] in [[Württemberg]]. It was bought by the [[Library of Congress]] in 2001. This preservation seems to be due the several sheets being bound into a single cover by the cartographer, [[Johannes Schöner]].

The map consists of twelve sections printed from woodcuts combined with metal types,  each measuring 18 x 24.5 inches (46 x 62&amp;nbsp;cm). Each section is one of four, that form one of three zones. The map uses a modified Ptolemaic coniform [[Map projection|projection]] with curved meridians to depict the entire surface of the Earth.

'''Fatburen''' is a small [[lake]] in [[Tyresö Municipality]], south-east of central [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]].  It is the last and easternmost lake within the [[Tyresån Lake System]].

The lake is roughly triangular in shape with its inflow from [[Albysjön, Tyresö|Albysjön]] in the southern corner, and its outflow to [[Kalvfjärden]] in the north-eastern corner.  It is separated from Albysjön by the peninsula Rävnäset, a municipal nature reserve covering 27 [[hectare|ha]].&lt;ref name="Tyresö-Rävnäset"&gt;Tyresö Municipality, ''Rävnäset''&lt;/ref&gt;  It contains a wide range of rare species and is together with the nature and park surrounding [[Tyresö Palace]] one of the best locales for [[bat]]s.&lt;ref name="Tyresö-Natur"&gt;Tyresö Municipality, ''Naturinventering 1998''&lt;/ref&gt;  South-east of the lake is the residential area Solberga.

In summers, the lake is part of a popular walk for visitors attracted by the [[Tyresö castle|Tyresö Palace]] and its surroundings.&lt;ref name="SNF"&gt;SNF, ''Tyresö slott och Nyfors''&lt;/ref&gt;  In winters, the lake is popular for [[ice fishing]].&lt;ref name="Tyresö-Tyresån"&gt;Tyresö Municipality, ''Tyresåns sjösystem''&lt;/ref&gt;

There are 21 species of [[vascular plant]]s by the lake which in itself contains 9-13 aquatic plants, a relatively high [[biodiversity]] within the lake system.&lt;ref name="SöEko" /&gt;  Common fishes include [[European perch|Perch]], [[Northern pike|Pike]], and [[Zander]].&lt;ref name="Sporfisk"&gt;Sportfiskarna, ''Sportfiskekortet''&lt;/ref&gt;

Notwithstanding its [[eutrophication]], the presence of [[Charales|Stoneworts]] in Fatburen indicates the waters have a relatively high visibility, which, considering it is the last lake in the lake system, is surprising.&lt;ref name="Tyresö-Natur" /&gt;

'''Fawcett City''' is a [[fictional]] [[city]] appearing in stories published by [[DC Comics]]. 

==Overview==
First mentioned in ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' #7 in 1985&lt;ref&gt;''Crisis oInfinitete Earths'' #7 (1985). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; and later formally established in [[Jerry Ordway]]'s ''[[The Power of Shazam!]]'' graphic novel in 1994, it served as the home base of [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] and the [[Marvel Family]] during the 1990s and 2000s. Its name is derived from the original publishers of Captain Marvel comics, [[Fawcett Comics]]. It is also home to [[Bulletman and Bulletgirl]], [[Spy Smasher]], [[Ibis the Invincible]], [[Mister Scarlet]] and [[Pinky the Whiz Kid]] and [[Minute-Man]]; also characters from Fawcett Comics.

Features of Fawcett City include [[radio]] station [[WHIZ (comics)|WHIZ]], which employs Captain Marvel's teenaged [[alter ego]] Billy Batson as an on-air and field reporter. Streets in Fawcett City have been named in honor of creators who worked on the ''Shazam!'' property over the decades, including [[Otto Binder]] (Binder Boulevard) and [[Bill Parker (comics)|Bill Parker]].

Fawcett City, like other fictional cities that appear in comics published by DC, has no exact location, besides being identified as being located in the [[Midwest]] region of the [[United States]]. However, in the 1990s series ''[[The Power of Shazam!]]'', it was suggested that it was located in [[Wisconsin]], thanks to various clues given by writer Jerry Ordway (who grew up in [[Milwaukee]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Creator Profile: Jerry Ordway|url=http://comicartcommunity.com/2013/01/creator-profile-jerry-ordway/|website=Comic Art Community|accessdate=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A ''[[Teen Titans]]'' ''Secret Files &amp; Origins''  special, however, stated that Fawcett City was located in [[Indiana]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.karridian.net/dcusa_gl.html DC Atlas - Great Lakes Region&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and a map in ''JSA vs. Kobra'' #4 (November 2009) indicates that the city is in [[Minnesota]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mykey3000.com/cosmicteams/jsa/_chron/jsachron10.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111224143/http://www.mykey3000.com/cosmicteams/jsa/_chron/jsachron10.html |archivedate=2010-01-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fawcett City is also a small town compared to [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] and [[Gotham City]].

The city is distinguished in the comic stories by an old-fashioned look and feel. Despite existing in the modern world, with current technologies and events, Fawcett seems old fashioned, as if stuck in the 1940s or 1950s. This timeless feel was explained in the ''Power of Shazam!'' series as being the results of a spell cast over the city in 1955 by [[Ibis the Invincible]]. The spell was requested by the wizard [[Shazam (wizard)|Shazam]], and was said to have protected Fawcett from the influences of outside evils and slowed the passage of time. For the next forty years within the [[DC Universe]], the city existed as a time-warp of sorts to the 1950s. The spell was shown to be removed in ''Power of Shazam!'' #11 (January 1996), and Fawcett began to slowly become a more modern city, although most of its [[Art Deco]] style buildings and generally old-fashioned values remain intact.

Other stories featuring the Captain Marvel/Shazam! characters were set in other locales. The Fawcett-era and 1973-1985 (pre-''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'') DC-era stories were set in a [[New York City|New York]] in an alternate universe known as [[Earth-S]]. The 1987 miniseries ''Shazam! The New Beginning'' was set in [[San Francisco]], and the most recent 2012-2013 ''Shazam!'' story from the pages of ''[[Justice League]]'' was set in [[Philadelphia]]. Alternate universe versions of the Marvel Family, as depicted in ''[[The Multiversity]]'', live in Fawcett City on what is known as "[[Earth-5]]" in the DC Universe.

The '''General Assembly of Prince Edward Island''' is the legislature of the province of [[Prince Edward Island]], [[Canada]]. Today, the legislature is made of two elements:  the [[Lieutenant Governor of Prince Edward Island]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite canlaw

}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[unicameral]] assembly called the [[Legislative Assembly of Prince Edward Island]]. The legislature was first established in 1773.

Like the Canadian federal government, Prince Edward Island uses a [[Westminster System|Westminster-style]] [[parliamentary government]], in which members are elected to the Legislative Assembly through [[List of Prince Edward Island general election|general elections]]. The party with the most seats forms Government. A [[Premier of Prince Edward Island]] and [[Executive Council of Prince Edward Island]] are formally appointed by the Lieutenant Governor in the name of The Queen.  The premier acts as Prince Edward Island's [[head of government]], while the [[Queen of Canada]] acts as [[head of state]].

The legislature was originally bicameral, with an upper house called the [[Legislative Council of Prince Edward Island]] and a lower house called the [[House of Assembly of Prince Edward Island]]. The Legislative Council also held executive power until 1839. In 1893 the houses were amalgamated into the [[Legislative Assembly of Prince Edward Island]]. Unlike other provinces that eliminated their upper house, the assembly continued to have a distinction between members elected as Councillors and members elected as Assemblymen. This distinction was eliminated in 1996, giving all members the title [[Member of the Legislative Assembly]], upon the change from dual ridings (two members per district) to single ridings (one member per district) in the Legislative Assembly.

This article describes the '''[[geography]] of [[Anguilla]]'''.

Anguilla is an island in the [[Leeward Islands]], which lies between the Caribbean Sea in the west and the open Atlantic Ocean in the east. It is a long, flat, dry/wet, scrub-covered [[coral island]], south and east of [[Puerto Rico]] and north of the [[Windward Islands|Windward]] chain. One of the [[Renaissance Islands]], it is separated from the [[British Virgin Islands]] by the [[Anegada Passage]]. The island has no significant elevations with its terrain consisting entirely of beaches, dunes, and low limestone bluffs.

==Hills==
Anguilla’s highest elevation, [[Crocus Hill]], is {{convert|73|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. Crocus Hill is among the cliffs that line the northern shore.

==Coastline==
The numerous bays, including Barnes, Little, Rendezvous, Shoal, and Road Bays, lure many vacationers to this tropical island. The coast and the beautiful, pristine beaches are integral to the [[Tourism of Anguilla|tourism]]-based economy of Anguilla. Because of Anguilla’s warm climate, the beaches can be used year-round.

==Climate==
Anguilla features a [[tropical wet and dry climate]] under the [[Köppen climate classification]]. The city has a rather dry climate, moderated by northeast [[trade wind]]s. Temperatures vary little throughout the year. Average daily maxima range from about {{convert|27|°C|°F|1|abbr=on}} in December to {{convert|30|°C|°F|abbr=on}} in July. Rainfall is erratic, averaging about {{convert|900|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} per year, the wettest months being September and October, and the driest February and March. Anguilla is vulnerable to hurricanes from June to November, peak season August to mid-October.
The island suffered damage in 1995 from [[Hurricane Luis]].

[[File:LocationGuineaBissau.svg|thumb|Location of Guinea Bissau]]

This article describes the '''geography of [[Guinea-Bissau]]'''.

== Terrain and ecology ==
[[Image:Guinea-Bissau Topography.png|thumb|350px|Guinea-Bissau's topography.]]	

The terrain of Guinea-Bissau is mostly low coastal plain with swamps of [[Guinean mangroves]] rising to [[Guinean forest-savanna mosaic]] in the east.&lt;ref name=fact /&gt;

The lowest point on Guinea-Bissau is at sea level at the Atlantic Ocean.&lt;ref name="fact"/&gt; The highest point on Guinea-Bissau is 300 metres above sea level at an unnamed location in the eastern part of the country.&lt;ref name="fact"/&gt;

Natural resources found in Guinea-Bissau include fish, [[timber]], [[phosphates]], [[bauxite]], clay, [[granite]], limestone and unexploited deposits of [[petroleum]].&lt;ref name="fact"/&gt; 10.67% of the land is arable and 235.6 square kilometres is irrigated.&lt;ref name="fact"/&gt;

Natural hazards include a hot, dry, dusty [[harmattan]] haze that may reduce visibility during the dry season and brush fires.&lt;ref name="fact"/&gt; Severe environmental issues include [[deforestation]]; [[soil erosion]]; [[overgrazing]] and [[overfishing]].&lt;ref name="fact"/&gt;

Near the Senegal border there have been historic sightings of the [[painted hunting dog]], ''Lycaon pictus'', but that [[endangered]] canid may now be [[Local extinction|extirpated]] in that locale.&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan. 2009. [https://web.archive.org/web/20101209234758/http://globaltwitcher.auderis.se/artspec_information.asp?thingid=35993 ''Painted Hunting Dog: Lycaon pictus'', GlobalTwitcher.com, ed.

== Climate ==

Guinea-Bissau's [[tropical climate|climate is tropical]]. This means it is generally hot and humid. It has a [[monsoon]]al-type rainy season (June to November) with southwesterly winds and a dry season (December to May) with northeasterly harmattan winds.&lt;ref name=fact&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/pu.html U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. ''World Factbook'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Guinea-Bissau is warm all year around and there is little temperature fluctuation; it averages {{convert|26.3|C|F}}. The average rainfall for the capital city Bissau is {{convert|2024|mm|in|1}} although this is almost entirely accounted for during the rainy season which falls between June and September/October. From December through April, the country receives very little rainfall.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3641">{{For|another Swiss theodolite inventor with a similar name|Heinrich von Wild}}
[[File:Wild Heinrich und Liliy.jpg|thumb|Heinrich and Lilly Wild (1900)]]
'''Heinrich Wild''' ([[Mitlödi]], [[Canton of Glarus]], November 15, 1877 – [[Baden, Switzerland|Baden]], [[Switzerland]], December 26, 1951) was a [[Swiss people|Swiss]] [[inventor]], [[designer]] and [[Entrepreneur|founder]] of [[Wild Heerbrugg]].

==Biography==
[[File:Survey Instrument designs by H.Wild.jpg|thumb]]
At 15 years of age, Wild became an apprentice with the engineer Legler in [[Glarus]] ([[hydraulic engineer]] for the [[Linth]] River). He bought a small [[theodolite]], and after a short time independently made expanded measurements of the flow of the river Linth. Later Wild joined the Geometerschule (geometer school) at [[Winterthur]] and came in 1899 as a trainee to the Landestopographie ([[Swisstopo]] is a popular designation for the Swiss Federal Office of [[Topography]]) in [[Bern]]. 
Due to his bad experiences with the high mountain triangulation with a theodolite of conventional design, he tried in 1905 to design a new theodolite with rotable circle with coincidence circle-readings.

In 1907 he left the Landestopographie and moved to [[Jena]], [[Germany]], where he joined the company [[Carl Zeiss]] to build up a new department for producing geodetic instruments. 
He began with the development of [[levelling instrument]]s and designed later also a new theodolite, the Th I.

In 1921 Wild returned to [[Switzerland]] and founded with Dr. R. Helbling, who operated a measurement office, and with the politician Jacob Schmidheiny, the company Heinrich Wild, Werkstätte für Feinmechanik und Optik (later known as [[Wild Heerbrugg]], Wild-Leitz AG,&lt;ref&gt;"Wild Heerbrugg und Leitz Wetzlar mit gemeinsamem Namen." New name Wild-Leitz AG from 1989. Neue Zürcher Zeitung, December 28, 1988, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leica Geosystems]], [[Leica Microsystems]], [[Leica Camera]]).

At this time he developed the first versions of the famous universal theodolite Wild T series and also the stereo autograph Wild A1 for aerial [[photo interpretation]],&lt;ref&gt;K. Hildebrand and R. Schlienger: "Scharfer Blick von oben." [[Neue Zürcher Zeitung]], April 24, 1984, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; besides a number of other measurement instruments.

It may be perhaps typical for the inventors like Wild that he worried little about the financial condition of his company{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}, and this ended finally with the consequence that Wild separated in 1932 from the company he founded, in order to be able to work as a freelance technical designer and inventor. He continued designing up until his death in 1951.  Among his designs were the legendary{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} DK1, DKM1, DM2, DKM2, and DKM3, for Kern &amp; Co, Aarau, besides other things.

The [[ETH Zurich]] honored him with the title Dr. honoris causa in 1930.

His biography was published in the [[Historical Dictionary of Switzerland]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/d/D31162.php Wolfgang Göldi: "Heinrich Wild". Historisches Lexikon der Schweiz, Biography (in German)]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as by the ETHZ.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sgc.ethz.ch/sgc-volumes/sgk-31.pdf Biography of Heinrich Wild, Swiss Geodetic Commission, published by ETHZ (in German)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hoba'''&lt;ref name=database&gt;{{metbull|11890|Hoba}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|oʊ|b|ə}} {{respell|HOH|bə}}) [[meteorite]], short for '''Hoba West''', is a meteorite that lies on the farm of the same name, not far from [[Grootfontein]], in the [[Otjozondjupa Region]] of [[Namibia]]. It has been uncovered but, because of its large mass, has never been moved from where it fell. The main mass is estimated at more than 60 tonnes,&lt;ref name=database/&gt; making it the largest known [[meteorite]] (as a single piece)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Meteorites and their parent planets |last=McSween |first= Harry |date=1999 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0521583039 |edition=2nd |location=Cambridge |oclc=39210190}}&lt;/ref&gt; and larger than the 37-tonne fragment of the [[Campo del Cielo]]. It is also the most massive naturally occurring piece of [[iron]] (actually ferronickel) known on Earth's surface. The name "Hoba" comes from [[Khoekhoegowab]] word meaning "gift".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Place Names of Namibia A Historical Dictionary|last=Cassidy|first=Joseph|publisher=Macmillan Education Namibia Publishers (Pty) Ltd|year=2009|isbn=978-99916-0-654-5|location=Windhoek|pages=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
The Hoba meteorite impact is thought to have occurred more recently than 80,000 years ago. It is inferred&lt;ref&gt;Field Guide to Meteors and Meteorites - O. Richard Norton and Lawrence Chitwood.  Springer Science + Business Media 2008, {{ISBN|978-1-84800-156-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the [[Earth's atmosphere]] slowed the object to the point that it impacted the surface at [[terminal velocity]], thereby remaining intact and causing little excavation. Assuming a drag coefficient of about 1.3, the meteor would have been slowed to about {{convert|720|mph|km/s|sigfig=2}} from its speed on entering the Earth's atmosphere, typically in excess of 10&amp;nbsp;km/s for similar objects. The meteorite is unusual in that it is flat on both major surfaces.

==Discovery==
The Hoba meteorite left no preserved [[Impact crater|crater]] and its discovery was a chance event. The owner of the land, Jacobus Hermanus Brits, encountered the object while ploughing one of his fields with an [[cattle|ox]]. During this task, he heard a loud metallic scratching sound and the plough came to an abrupt halt. The obstruction was excavated, identified as a meteorite and described by Mr. Brits, whose report was published in 1920 and can be viewed at the [[Grootfontein]] Museum in Namibia.

[[Friedrich Wilhelm Kegel]] took the first published photograph of the Hoba meteorite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Spencer |first1=L. J. |last2=Hey |first2=M. H. |title=Hoba (South-West Africa), the largest known meteorite |journal=The Mineralogical Magazine and Journal of the Mineralogic Society |url=https://rruff.info/doclib/MinMag/Volume_23/23-136-1.pdf |date=March 1932 |volume=XXIII&lt;!--23--&gt; |number=136 |page=4 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161215172158/http://rruff.info/doclib/MinMag/Volume_23/23-136-1.pdf |archivedate=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description and composition==
Hoba is a tabloid body of metal, measuring {{convert|2.7|*|2.7|*|0.9|m|ft}}. In 1920 its mass was estimated at 66 tonnes. Erosion, scientific sampling and vandalism reduced its bulk over the years. The remaining mass is estimated at just over 60 tonnes. The meteorite is composed of about 84% iron and 16% [[nickel]], with traces of [[cobalt]]. It is classified as an [[ataxite]] [[iron meteorite]] belonging to the nickel-rich chemical class [[IVB meteorites|IVB]]. A crust of iron [[hydroxide]]s is locally present on the surface, owing to weathering.

==Modern history==
In an attempt to control vandalism and with permission from Mrs. O. Scheel, owner of the farm at the time, the government of [[South West Africa]] (now Namibia) on March 15, 1955, declared the Hoba meteorite to be a national monument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta |volume=31 |issue=9 |date=September 1967 |page=1470 |first=M.F. |last=Comerford |title=Comparative erosion rates of stone and iron meteorites under small-particle bombardment |doi=10.1016/0016-7037(67)90021-X |publisher=Elsevier Science, New York |issn=0016-7037|bibcode=1967GeCoA..31.1457C}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979 the proclamation was changed to include not only the meteorite but also 25 m x 25 m land on which it is situated.&lt;ref name=Voigt&gt;{{Cite book | title=National Monuments in Namibia: An Inventory of Proclaimed National Monuments in the Republic of Namibia | last=Voigt | first=Andreas | publisher=Gamsberg Macmillan | year=2004 | pages=4-5 | isbn= 9991605932 | url=https://books.google.com.na/books?id=h0h0AAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985 [[Rössing]] Uranium Ltd. made resources and funds available to the Namibian government to provide additional protection against vandalism. In 1987 Mr. J. Engelbrecht, the owner of Hoba West farm, donated the meteorite and the site where it lies to the state for educational purposes. Later that year, the government opened a tourist centre at the site.&lt;ref name=Voigt/&gt; As a result of these developments, vandalism of the Hoba meteorite has ceased and it is now visited by thousands of tourists every year.

'''Ismoil Somoni Peak''' ([[Tajik language|Tajik]]: Қуллаи Исмоили Сомонӣ, ''Qulla-i Ismō‘il-i Sōmōnî/Qullaji Ismojili Somonī''; {{lang-fa|قلّهٔ اسماعیل سامانی}}; {{Lang-rus|Пик Исмои́ла Сомони́|r=Pik Ismoíla Somoní}}) is the highest [[mountain]] in [[Tajikistan]]. It was within the territory of the former [[Russian Empire]] and the former [[Soviet Union]], and was the highest mountain in the Soviet Union before the area became independent as Tajikistan. The mountain is named after [[Ismail Samani]], a ruler of the [[Samanids|Samanid dynasty]].

==Name==
When the existence of a peak in the Soviet [[Pamir Mountains]] higher than [[Lenin Peak]] was first established in 1928, the mountain was tentatively identified with [[Garmo Peak]].&lt;ref name="readersnatural"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Natural Wonders of the World|publisher=Reader's Digest Association, Inc|year=1980|isbn=0-89577-087-3|editor-last=Scheffel|editor-first=Richard L.|location=United States of America|pages=104|quote=|editor-last2=Wernet|editor-first2=Susan J.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as the result of the work of further Soviet expeditions, it became clear by 1932 that they were not the same, and in 1933 the new peak, in the [[Academy of Sciences Range]], was named '''Stalin Peak''' ({{Lang-rus|Пик Ста́лина|r=Pik Stálina}}), after [[Joseph Stalin]]. In 1962, as part of [[Nikita Khrushchev|Khrushchev's]] nationwide [[De-stalinization|de-Stalinization process]], the name was changed to '''Communism Peak''' ({{Lang-tg|Пики Коммунизм|translit=Piki Komunizm}} {{Lang-rus|Пик Коммуни́зма|r=Pik Kommunízma}}), a name by which it is still commonly known. The name Communism Peak was officially dropped in 1998 in favour of the current name, commemorating the 9th century [[Samanid]] emir, [[Ismail Samani]].{{Citation needed|date = May 2017}}

==History==
The first ascent was made 3 September 1933 by the Soviet [[mountaineering|mountaineer]] [[Yevgeniy Abalakov]].&lt;ref&gt;The Great Soviet Encyclopaedia. Communizma Peak.  Also [http://www.summitpost.org/pik-kommunizma/150290 Pik Kommunzma] at summitpost.org accessed 3Nov2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Junkerdal National Park''' ({{lang-no|Junkerdal nasjonalpark}}) is a [[national park]] that lies in the municipalities of [[Saltdal]] and [[Fauske]] in [[Nordland]] county, [[Norway]], along the border with [[Sweden]]. The {{convert|682|km2|adj=on}} park was opened in 2004. The park borders the Junkerdalsura [[nature reserve]].&lt;ref name="snl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://snl.no/Junkerdal_nasjonalpark|title=Junkerdal nasjonalpark|author=Store norske leksikon|authorlink=Store norske leksikon|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2012-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature==
The park is known for a varied flora. Some mountains and highlands have a large number of arctic-alpine species of plants. The lower altitudes in the park are forested. Several of the plant species are generally rare, such as the white Arctic mountain heather (''[[Cassiope tetragona]]''). The white mountain saxifrage (''[[Saxifraga paniculata]]'') is found in only three places in Norway, and it is most widely distributed in Junkerdal National Park.  Many of the plants in this park are normally only found further north, or on other continents entirely. Some of the specialized plants are bullrush sedge (''[[Carex scirpoidea]]''), snow fleabane (''[[Erigeron humilis]]'') and alpine arnica (''[[Arnica angustifolia]]''), all of which are at their southernmost limit here. Other rare plants found in the national park are Arctic bellflower (''[[Campanula uniflora]]''), upright lousewort (''[[Pedicularis flammea]]'') and hairy lousewort (''[[Pedicularis hirsuta]]'').&lt;ref name="GN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gonorway.com/norway/articles/698|title=Junkerdal National Park|publisher=GoNorway.com|accessdate=2012-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are [[wolverine]]s, [[lynx]], and [[brown bear]]s that live in the park. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saltenposten.no/nyheter/article295904.ece Moose hunters meeting brown bears; sep 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Moose]] and [[reindeer]] are both common in the area.  A wide variety of rare and threatened wetland birds also nest inside the national park, among them include the [[gerfalcon]], [[golden eagle]], [[red-throated loon]], [[Arctic loon]], and [[long-tailed duck]].&lt;ref name="GN" /&gt;

==Name==
The first element is ''junker'' means "[[nobleman]]".  The valley is allegedly named after Preben von Ahlen (1606-1675), called "the junker", who went through the valley in 1658 to raid and destroy the Swedish [[Nasa silver mine]]. The last element is ''dal'' which means "[[valley]]" or "dale".

'''Just Gjessing''' (Oslo, 13 July 1926 – 29 October 2005) was a Norwegian geographer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://snl.no/Just_Gjessing Just Gjessing], [[Store Norske Leksikon]]&lt;/ref&gt; Gjessing obtained a Ph.D. degree in 1960 with a study on Norway’s [[hydrology]] during [[deglaciation]]. One year later he was appointed full professor. In the late 1960s Gjessing became increasingly interested in nature conservation so that in the 1970s shifted the focus of his research into [[environmental impact assessment]]s. This meant leaving behind his work on pure [[fluvial geomorphology]] that had previously brought him acclaim. Following this interest he joined in 1967 the Oslo University’s Commission for Watercourse Regulation. In 1971 he became chairman of the commission while also entering the Joint Commission for Hydroelectric Power Development and Nature Conservation, of which he was a member until 1981. He co-authored various notable books including ''Beste Store Norge Atlas'' (1983) and the five volume work ''Norge'' (1984–1986) and the journal ''[[Norsk Geografisk Tidsskrift]]'' from 1979 to 1987. In the 1980s the work of Gjessing turned increasingly international with many travels to [[West Africa|West]] and [[North Africa]] where he studied environmental issues in arid and semi-arid landscapes.&lt;ref name=Trondalen200en&gt;{{cite journal|author-last=Trondalen|author-first=Jon Martin |date=2006|title=Professor Just Gjessing: ‘A journey with a purpouse’ |journal=[[Norwegian Journal of Geography]] |volume=60|issue=|pages=161–164}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Gjessing’s personality and approach made him subject of strong and lasting criticism from so-called “rejectionist” even within his own department at the [[University of Oslo]]. Despite their opposition Gjessing managed to establish the course Resource Geography and Landscape Ecology in 1985, attending student demands that had emerged in the 1970s about the need of courses on natural resources and environmental management.&lt;ref name=Trondalen200en/&gt;

The '''Lazistan Eyalet''' (or '''Lazistan'''; {{lang-tr|Lazistan eyaleti}}), is the [[Theory|theoretical]] reform of [[Turkey]]'s [[administrative division]] proposed by the [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]]. These [[2023 vision|reforms]] constitute a significant change in territorial administration and management of local services, aiming to give more [[autonomy]] to local governments across the country.

Erdoğan reportedly said in 2013, that the [[Ottoman Empire]] used to call the [[Black Sea Region|Black Sea region]] — “[[Lazistan Sanjak|Lazistan]]”,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/politicians-hit-below-belt-in-kurdish-debate-58200 hurriyetdailynews.com - Politicians hit below belt in Kurdish debate]&lt;/ref&gt; which belonged to the [[Laz people|Laz]] community, while the founding [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey|Parliament of the Republic of Turkey]] used to call the [[Southeastern Anatolia Region|southeastern Anatolian]] region — “[[Kurdistan]].” His remarks referring to the provincial [[Administrative divisions of the Ottoman Empire|administration]] of the Ottoman Empire was target of criticism since they could be interpreted as a sign of Erdoğan’s desire to implement a [[Federalism|federal system]]. To challenge the opposition [[Turkish nationalism|nationalists]], Recep Tayyip Erdogan alluded to the Ottoman [[Eyalet|eyalet system]] of semi-autonomous provinces and recalled that during the Ottoman era there were eyalets called Kurdistan and Lazistan.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/fr/originals/2013/04/turkish-nationalists-threat-peace-process-communalism.html al-monitor.com - Turkey's Nationalists Threaten Inter-Communal Fighting]&lt;/ref&gt; In his opinion 'A powerful Turkey should never fear the state system',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dailysabah.com/turkey/2013/03/30/pm-erdogan-those-who-withdraw-will-have-to-drop-their-weapons dailysabah.com - PM Erdoğan: Those who withdraw will have to drop their weapons]&lt;/ref&gt; autonomous self-governance within the state of Turkey should be possible and would even be a source of strength for Turkey.

This is a '''list of [[UN peacekeeping]] missions''' since the [[United Nations]] was founded in 1945, organized by region, with the dates of deployment, the name of the related conflict, and the name of the UN operation.

[[Peacekeeping]], as defined by the United Nations, is a way to help countries torn by conflict create conditions for sustainable peace. UN peacekeepers—soldiers and military officers, police officers and civilian personnel from many countries—monitor and observe peace processes that emerge in post-conflict situations and assist ex-combatants in implementing the peace agreements they have signed. Such assistance comes in many forms, including confidence-building measures, power-sharing arrangements, electoral support, strengthening the rule of law, and economic and social development.

The [[Charter of the United Nations]] gives the [[Security Council]] the power and responsibility to take collective action to maintain international peace and security. For this reason, the international community usually looks to the Security Council to authorize peacekeeping operations. Most of these operations are established and implemented by the United Nations itself with troops serving under UN operational command. In other cases, where direct UN involvement is nt functions, including diplomatic relations with other countries, international bodies of justice (such as the [[International Criminal Court]]), and eliminating problems such as landmines that can lead to new incidents of fighting.

The '''list of air carriers banned in the [[European Union]]''' is a list of airlines failing to meet regulatory oversight standards of the EU, and which are banned from entering the airspace of any member state. The first version of the list was published in 2006, on the legal basis of the [[Regulation (European Union)|Regulation]] No. 474/2006 of the [[European Commission]], issued on 22 March of that year. The current version of the list was published on 30 November 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of airlines subject to an operating ban or operational restrictions within the European Union |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-17-4971_en.htm |work=European Commission for Transport |publisher=European Commission |accessdate=1 December 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CgKliGs4?url=http://ec.europa.eu/transport/modes/air/safety/air-ban/doc/list_en.pdf |archivedate=5 December 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal procedure==
The process by which an air carrier is listed is laid out in Regulation (EC) No 2111/2005 of the [[European Parliament]] and [[European Council|Council]]. It involves consultation among the regulatory agencies of the member states, the institutions of the European Community, the authorities with responsibility for regulatory oversight of the air carrier concerned, and the air carrier itself. Before being listed, each air carrier has the right of appeal. The list is subject to periodic review.

In June 2016, all restrictions on [[Air Madagascar]], [[Iran Air]], [[Lion Air]], [[Citilink]], [[Batik Air]], and all [[Zambian]] airlines were removed from the list of air carriers banned in the EU.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-indonesia-airlines-eu-idUSKCN0Z20XE&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 30, 2017, [[Avior Airlines]] from [[Venezuela]] was added to the list because of "unaddressed safety deficiencies." No further details were given at the time.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost"&gt;{{cite news |last=Associated Press |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/venezuelan-airline-barred-from-european-union-skies/2017/11/30/156e6bee-d60d-11e7-9ad9-ca0619edfa05_story.html |title=Venezuelan airline barred from European Union skies |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=2007-11-30 |accessdate=2017-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 14, 2018, all remaining [[List of airlines of Indonesia|Indonesian airlines]] not already removed from the list were removed from the list of air carriers banned in the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Aviation Safety: Commission removes all airlines from Indonesia from EU Air Safety List |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-18-4131_en.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4540">A '''meteorite mineral''' is a mineral found chiefly or exclusively within [[meteorite]]s or meteorite derived material. This is a list of those minerals, excluding minerals also commonly found in terrestrial rocks. As of 1997 there were approximately 295 mineral species which have been identified in meteorites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1945-5100.1997.tb01558.x |title=Mineralogy of meteorite groups - an update |first=Alan E.|last=Rubin |journal=Meteoritics |volume=32 |pages=733–734 |date=Sep 1997 |bibcode=1997M&amp;PS...32..733R |issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MIKE 3''' is a [[computer program]] that simulates flows, cohesive sediments, water quality,and ecology in rivers, lakes, estuaries, bays, coastal areas and seas in three dimensions. MIKE 3 was developed by [[DHI (company)|DHI]]. MIKE 3 provides the simulation tools if you need to model 3D free surface flows and associated sediment or water quality processes. MIKE 3 is widely recognized as the gold standard for environmental and ecological studies.  MIKE 3 can be used for assessment of hydrographic conditions for design, construction and operation of structures and plants in stratified waters, environmental impact assessment studies, coastal and oceanographic circulation studies, including fine sediment dynamics, sea ice simulations, lak hydrodynamics, water pollution studies and restoration projects, analysis of cooling water recirculation and desalination, water quality and ecological forecasting, phenomena whenever 3D flow structures is important.

==Introduction==

MIKE 3 is a generalised mathematical modelling system designed for a wide range of applications in areas such as oceanography,coastal regions and estuaries and lakes. The system is fully three-dimensional solving the momentum equation and continuity equationsin the three Cartesian directions.MIKE 3 simulates unsteady flow taking into account density variations, bathymetry and external forcing such as meteorology, tidal elevations, currents and other hydrographic conditions. MIKE 3 can be applied to oceanographic studies,coastal circulation studies, water pollution studies,environmental impact assessment studies,heat and salt recirculation studies and sedimentation studies. MIKE 3 is composed of three fundamental modules: The hydrodynamic (HD) module, the turbulence module and the advection-dispersion (AD) module. Various features such as free surface description, laminar flow description and density variations are optionally invoked within the three fundamental modules. A number of application modules have been implemented and can be invoked optionally. These are advection-dispersion of conservative or linearly decaying substances, a water quality (WQ)module describing BOD-DO relations, nutrients and hygienic problems, a eutrophication (EU) module simulating algae growth and primary production, and a mud transport (MT) module simulating transport along with erosion and deposition of cohesive material. A Lagrangian-based particle (PA) module can also be invoked for simulating e.g. tracers, sediment transport or the spreading and decay of E-Coli bacteria. The modelling system is based on the conservation of mass and momentum in three dimensions of a Newtonian fluid. The flow is decomposed into mean quantities and turbulent fluctuations. The closure problem is solved through the Boussinesq eddy viscosity concept relating the Reynold stresses to the mean velocity field. To handle density variations, the equations for conservation of salinity and temperature are included. An equation of state constitutes the relation between the density and the variations in salinity and temperature and ñ if the MT calculations are invoked ñ mud concentration. In the hydrodynamic module, the prognostic variables are the velocity components in the three directions and the fluid pressure. The model equations are discretised in an implicit, finite difference scheme on a staggered grid and solved non-iteratively by use of the alternating directions' implicit technique. A phase and amplification analysis neglecting effects of viscosity, convective terms, rotation, density variations, etc. has been performed. Under these circumstances, the finite difference scheme is unconditionally stable.

The transport of scalar quantities, such as salinity and temperature, is solved in the advectiondispersion module using an explicit, finite difference technique based on quadratic upstream interpolation in three dimensions. The finite difference scheme, which is accurate to fourth order, has attractive properties concerning numerical dispersion, stability and mass conservation. The decomposition of the prognostic variables into a mean quantity and a turbulent fluctuation leads to additional stress terms in the governing equations to account for the non-resolved processes both in time and space. By the adoption of the eddy viscosity concept these effects are expressed through the eddy viscosity, which is optionally determined by one of the following five closure models:a constant eddy viscosity; the Smagorinsky sub-grid (zero-equation) model; the k- (one-equation) model; the standard k-ε (two-equation) model; and a combination of the Smagorinsky model for the horizontal direction and a k-ε model for the vertical direction.

==Governing Equations==
In a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model for flow of Newtonian fluids, the following elements are required:namely mass conservation; momentum conservation; conservation of salinity and temperature; equation of state relating local density to salinity, temperature and pressure as well as to possible mud concentration. Thus, the governing equations consist of seven (possibly eight) equations with seven (eight)
unknowns.

==Advection-dispersion==
MIKE 3 is applicable to flow problems in which density variations and turbulence are important features. The mathematical modelling of such flows requires the solution of partial differential equations of the advective-diffusive type. The flow modelling will require the solution of the transport equation for salinity,temperature (heat),turbulent kinetic energy (k-equation),dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy (ε-equation). The latter two equations form the well-known k and k-ε turbulence models. For the k-model and the standard k-ε model, the non-linear transport equations are solved by explicit UPWIND scheme. The one-dimensional (vertical) k-ε model essentially forms two one-dimensional diffusion equations, which are efficiently solved by an implicit scheme. The partial differential equations describing transport of salinity and temperature as well as transport of concentrations of substances, water quality and eutrophication components and mud concentration are all linear advective-diffusive type equations, and accordingly the same solution scheme is applied to all these components. A large number of methodologies for solving the advection-diffusion problem are reported in the literature. However, in order to be consistent with the HD module, a finite difference approach was chosen. The QUICKEST (Quadratic Upstream Interpolation for Convective Kinematics with Estimated Streaming Terms, Leonard (1979)) is applied. The method is based on a conservative control volume formulation. Upstream interpolation is used to determine higher order derivatives. This procedure avoids the stability problems of central differencing while remaining free of the inaccuracies of numerical diffusion associated with the usual upstream differencing. The extension of this scheme to two and three dimensions is given in Justesen et al. (1989), EkebjÊrg and Justesen (1991) and Vested et al. (1992). For use in situations where resolution of steep fronts are important, the scheme has been further improved by implementation of an exponential interpolation at steep fronts, the so-called QUICKEST-SHARP scheme, see also Leonard (1988). Alternatively, the so-called QUICKEST-ULTIMATE scheme, using [[operator splitting]], may optionally be invoked, see e.g. Leonard (1991). This scheme is advantageous in cases with more than one advection-diffusion component, since in MIKE 3 it has been implemented such that the CPU time consumption is practically independent of the number of components.

'''Madrid County, California''' was the fictional setting of the 1971 [[CBS]] television drama ''[[Cade's County]]'', starring [[Glenn Ford]] as [[Sheriff]] Sam Cade.  Madrid County was a vast domain of mostly sparsely populated desert, and was seemingly modeled on the real [[San Bernardino County, California|San Bernardino County]], the largest county in the [[United States]] in terms of area.

'''Maliku Kandu''' and '''Māmalē Kandu''' [dakshlanguage|Divehi]] are the traditional names of the broad '''Minicoy Channel''' between [[Maliku Atoll|Minicoy]] (Maliku in Dhivehi) and Ihavandippolhu ([[Northern Thiladhunmathi Atoll]]) in the north of the [[Maldives]]. The latter name is given after the [[Malabar (Northern Kerala)|Malabar]] merchant Maamaley Marakkaaru who controlled most of the sea trade along this route before the arrival of the Portuguese in the Indian Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;Divehiraajjege Jōgrafīge Vanavaru. Muhammadu Ibrahim Lutfee. G.Sōsanī.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[maritime boundary]] between the Maldives and [[India]] runs through the channel.

In the British [[Admiralty charts]] it is called ''Eight Degree Channel''. It is so named as it lies on the [[8th parallel north|8-degree line of Latitude]], north of the [[equator]]. Another local name for this channel is Addigiri Kandu.

This channel appeared in old French maps with the name ''Courant de Malicut''.

==History==

Traditionally the northernmost atoll of the Maldives was [[Minicoy]] (Maliku). Fishermen from [[Thuraakunu]] and from Minicoy often crossed the Maliku Kandu on their boats to visit each other's islands. Marriage alliances were common.

Nowadays Minicoy is a part of [[India]] and communication between Minicoy and Maldives by sea is highly restricted.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}445595956594455959565 4339449325

'''Base Orcadas''' is an [[Argentina|Argentine]] scientific station in [[Antarctica]], and the oldest of the stations in Antarctica still in operation. It is located on [[Laurie Island]], one of the [[South Orkney Islands]] ({{lang-es|Islas Orcadas del Sur}}), at {{convert|4|m|ft|1|sp=us}} above sea level and {{convert|170|m|ft|0|sp=us}} from the coastline. Established by the [[Scottish National Antarctic Expedition]] in 1903 and transferred to the Argentine government in 1904, the base has been permanently populated since, being one of six Argentine permanent bases in Argentina's [[Argentine Antarctica|claim to Antarctica]], and the first permanently inhabited base in Antarctica.

The nearest port is the Argentine city of [[Ushuaia]], which is {{convert|1502|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} away. The base has 11 buildings and four main topics of research: continental glaciology, seismology, sea-ice-zone glaciology (since 1985) and meteorological observations (since 1903).

Orcadas was the only station on the islands for 40 years until the British established a small summer base, [[Cape Geddes Station]] in Laurie Island in 1946, replaced by [[Signy Research Station]] in [[Signy Island]] in 1947. It also had the first radiotelegraph in the continent in 1927. The 11 buildings of the station house up to 45 people during the summer, and an average of 14 during winter.

==History==
In 1903 Dr [[William Speirs Bruce|William S. Bruce]]'s [[Scottish National Antarctic Expedition]] established ''Omond House'', a meteorological station on Laurie Island. During the expedition, however, the crew became stuck in the ice and, unable to sail off, were trapped in the station for the winter.

Bruce left the station in December of that year for [[Buenos Aires]] to fix the ship and obtain supplies, leaving meteorologist [[Robert C. Mossman]] in charge of the base to continue the observations.

Bruce offered to the Government of President [[Julio Argentino Roca]] the transfer of the station and instruments for the sum of 5.000 [[peso]]s, on the condition that the government committed itself to the continuation of the scientific mission.&lt;ref name=RREE&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ucema.edu.ar/ceieg/arg-rree/7/7-107.htm | title=Historia General de las Relaciones Exteriores de la Republica Argentina | accessdate=July 6, 2012 | author1=Escude, Carlos |author2=Cisneros, Andres |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also offered to transport in his ship the appointed personnel back to the station.

Bruce had informed the British officer William Haggard of his intentions in December 1903. On 29 December, Haggard sent a note to the Argentine Foreign Minister, Jose Terry, ratifying the terms of Bruce proposition.&lt;ref name=RREE/&gt; Roca submitted the matter to the ''Oficina Meteorologica Nacional'' (National Office of Meteorology) who advised to accept the offer. On January 2, 1904, the installations were accepted through a presidential decree.&lt;ref name=moneta&gt;{{cite book | title=Cuatro Años en las Orcadas del Sur | publisher=Ediciones Peuser | author=Moneta, Jose Manuel | edition=9th | year=1954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Scotia'' sailed back for Laurie Island on 14 January 1904 carrying on board Luciano H. Valette, from the Office of Zoology of the Ministry of Agriculture, Edgard C. Szmula, employee of the National Meteorological Office, and Hugo Acuña, from the Ministry of  Livestock, who was also designated Postal Chief of the Orkney Islands by the Director General of the National Postal and Telegraphs Office, Manuel Garcia Fernandez. Mossman was left in charge of the expedition, along with William Smith as cook.

In 1906, Argentina communicated to the international community the establishment of a permanent base on the South Orkney Islands. On August 26, Haggard sent a letter to Foreign Minister Manuel Montes de Oca reminding him that South Orkneys Islands were British. The British position was that Argentine personnel was granted permission only for the period of one year. Argentine government ignored the note, "considering it out of time".&lt;ref name=RREE/&gt;

On March 30, 1927, naval [[non-commissioned officer]] Emilio Baldoni established the first [[Wireless telegraphy|radio telegraph]] link with Ushuaia. Up to that point, the Orcadas Base remained isolated from the rest of the world until the yearly relief arrived. The radio station (coded LRT in Argentina) allowed for a permanent communication link.

The station depended on the Ministry of Agriculture until [[Argentine Navy]] relieved the crew with navy personnel on March 3, 1951. Formal transfer occurred on December 23, 1952, when by presidential decree the base was put under the Service of Maritime Hydrography as ''Destacamento Naval Orcadas''.

'''Petite Kabylie''' or  '''Petite Kabylia''' ([[Berber language|Berber]]: Tamurt n Wadda, [[Arabic]]: al-Qabā'il as-Saghra, القبائل الصغرى, [[Maghrebi Arabic]]: Qbayel es-Sghira) is a [[natural region]] in the mountainous area of northern [[Algeria]].&lt;ref&gt;Protected Areas and World Heritage Programme, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; The Petite Kabylie is part of the greater [[Kabylie]] region.

==Geography==
The Petite Kabylie is located in the [[mountainous]] area of the [[Bibans]] and the [[Babor Range]], subranges of the [[Tell Atlas]] range bordering the [[Mediterranean]].
The Petite Kabylie is separated from the [[Grande Kabylie]] by the [[Soummam]] Valley.

The Petite Kabylie spreads over several administrative divisions of Algeria: [[Béjaïa Province]], part of [[Setif Province]] (Ath Yaala, Ath Ourtilan, Alma-Ouklan, Amoucha, Bouandas, Babor and Bougaâ), part of [[Bordj Bou Arréridj Province]] (Ath Laalam, El Main, El Mehir, Ath Djafar, Ath Khelifa, Ath Sidi Brahim, Medjana, Mensourah, Rabiâa, Tizi El Khemis, Tizi Ikachouchan, Tassamert, Bordj town and Zemoura) and the part of [[Bouira Province]] bordering the provinces of Béjaïa and Bordj Bou Arreridj. 

An ampler definition could include the [[Arabophone]] regions that by tradition are culturally [[Berberism|Berber]] of [[Jijel Province]], and only the western parts of [[Mila Province]] and the western  parts of [[Skikda Province]] up to Collo and Tamalous.&lt;ref&gt;[http://encyclopedieberbere.revues.org/1395?lang=en Encyclopédie berbère - Kabylie : Géographie]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology==
Some of Petite Kabylie is forested with [[Mediterranean conifer and mixed forests]]. This locale offers one of the few remaining disjunctive [[habitat]]s for the [[endangered]] [[Barbary macaque]], ''Macaca sylvanus'', a [[primate]] species which prehistorically held a much wider range.&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''political division of the Kingdom of [[Spain]]''' is defined in Part VIII of the [[Spanish constitution]] of 1978, which establishes three levels of '''territorial organization''': [[municipalities of Spain|municipalities]], [[provinces of Spain|provinces]] and [[autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous communities]],&lt;ref&gt;Article 137 of the Spanish Constitution of 1978&lt;/ref&gt; the first group constituting the subdivisions of the second, and the second group constituting the subdivisions of the last. The State&lt;ref name=Art138&gt;Article 138 of the Spanish Constitution of 1978&lt;/ref&gt; guarantees the realization of the principle of solidarity by endeavouring to establish an economic balance between the different areas of the Spanish territory.&lt;ref name=Art138/&gt;

The autonomous communities were constituted by exercising the right to autonomy or self-government that the constitution guarantees to the [[nationalities and regions of Spain]],&lt;ref name=art143&gt;Article 143 of the Spanish Constitution of 1978&lt;/ref&gt; while declaring the indissoluble unity of the Spanish nation.&lt;ref name=art2&gt;Article 2 of the Spanish Constitution of 1978&lt;/ref&gt; The autonomous communities enjoy a highly decentralized form of territorial organization, but based on [[devolution]], and thus Spain is not a [[federation]],&lt;ref name=sinopsis137&gt;[http://www.congreso.es/consti/constitucion/indice/sinopsis/sinopsis.jsp?art=137&amp;tipo=2 Sinópsis del artículo 137 de la Constitución Española de 1978]. Congreso de los Diputados&lt;/ref&gt; since the State is superior to the communities and retains full sovereignty.&lt;ref name=sinopsis137/&gt; In the absence of an explicit definition in the constitution the [[Constitutional Court of Spain]] has labeled this model of territorial organization the "State of Autonomous Communities", to avoid implying any particular model.&lt;ref name=sinopsis137/&gt;

==Autonomous communities and Autonomous cities==
{{Autonomous communities of Spain|float=right}}
{{Main|Autonomous communities of Spain}}
{{see also|Nationalities and regions of Spain}}

The autonomous communities (''comunidades autónomas'' in Spanish and Galician, ''comunitats autònomes'' in Catalan, ''autonomia erkidego'' in Basque) constitute the first order (highest) level of territorial organization of Spain. They were created progressively after the promulgation of the Spanish constitution in 1978, to the "[[nationalities and regions of Spain|nationalities and regions]]" that constitute the Spanish nation by the exercise of the right to self-government by:&lt;ref&gt;Part VIII, Third Chapter, Article 143&lt;/ref&gt;
* two or more adjacent provinces with common historical, cultural and economic characteristics,
* insular territories, and
* a single province with a historical regional identity.

The constitution allowed two exceptions to the above set of criteria, namely that the [[Spanish Parliament]] reserves the right to:&lt;ref&gt;Article 144 of the Spanish Constitution of 1978&lt;/ref&gt;
* authorize, in the nation's interest, the constitution of an autonomous community even if it is a single province without a historical regional identity (which allowed for the creation of the [[Community of Madrid]], which had been part of the historical region of [[Castile–La Mancha]]); and to
* authorize or grant autonomy to entities or territories that are not provinces (which allowed for the creation of two autonomous cities, Spanish exclaves in North Africa).

Even though the province was the basis for the creation of the autonomous communities, these roughly follow the lines of the old kingdoms and regions of the [[Iberian peninsula]] prior to unification.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.credoreference.com/entry/columency/spain Spain. (2008)]. In ''The Columbia Encyclopedia''. Accessed 1 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally autonomy was to be granted only to the so-called "historical nationalities":&lt;ref name=brit&gt;"[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-70303/Spain Regional Government]". Spain. ''Encyclopædia Britannica Online'' Accessed 10 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[Catalonia]], the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] and [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], regions with strong regional identities&lt;ref name=keating&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/61/8/37890628.pdf Federalism and the Balance of Power in European States (2006)], Michael Keating for the OECD&lt;/ref&gt; that had been granted self-government or had approved a [[Statute of Autonomy]] during the [[Second Spanish Republic]] (1931–1936).

While the constitution was still being drafted, and self-government seemed to be granted only to the "historical nationalities", there was a popular outcry in [[Andalusia]], demanding self-government as well, which led to the creation of a quicker process for that region, which eventually self-identified as a "historical nationality" as well. In the end, the right to self-government was extended to any other region that wanted it.&lt;ref name=keating/&gt;

The "historical nationalities" were to be granted autonomy through a rapid and simplified process, whereas the rest of the regions had to follow specific requirements set forth in the constitution.  Between 1979 and 1983, all regions in Spain chose to be constituted as autonomous communities; four additional communities self-identify as "nationalities", albeit acceding to autonomy via the longer process set forth in the constitution.

While the constitution did not establish how many autonomous communities were to be created, on 31 July 1981, [[Leopoldo Calvo-Sotelo]], then the [[prime minister of Spain]] and [[Felipe González]], leader of the opposition in Parliament, signed the "[[First Autonomic Pacts]]" (''Primeros pactos autonómicos'' in Spanish), in which they agreed to the creation of 17 autonomous communities and two autonomous cities, with the same institutions of government, but different competences.&lt;ref name=pactos&gt;Aparicio, Sonia. [http://www.elmundo.es/especiales/2005/06/espana/estatutos_autonomia/historia2.html Los Pactos Autonómicos]. El Mundo. España&lt;/ref&gt; By 1983, all 17 autonomous communities were constituted: [[Andalusia]], [[Aragon]], [[Asturias]], the [[Balearic Islands]], the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]], the [[Canary Islands]], [[Cantabria]], [[Castile and León]], [[Castile–La Mancha]], [[Catalonia]], the [[Community of Madrid]], [[Extremadura]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], [[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja]],  [[Navarra]], the [[Region of Murcia]] and the [[Valencian Community]].  The two autonomous cities, [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]] were constituted in 1995.

Autonomous communities have a wide range of powers, but the devolution of power to the individual communities has been asymmetrical.&lt;ref name=keating/&gt; The Constitutional Court has declared that the autonomous communities are characterized both by their homogeneity and diversity.&lt;ref name=sinopsis137/&gt; Autonomous communities are "equal" in their subordination to the constitutional order, in their representation in the [[Senate of Spain]], and in the sense that their differences should not imply any economical or social privilege from the others. Nonetheless, they differ in the process whereby they acceded to autonomy and their range of competences.&lt;ref name=sinopsis137/&gt; The cases of the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] and [[Navarra]] are exceptional in that the medieval charters (''fueros'' in Spanish) that had granted them fiscal autonomy were retained, or rather "updated"; the rest of the autonomous communities do not enjoy fiscal autonomy.

All autonomous communities have a parliamentary form of government. The institutions of government of the different autonomous communities (i.e. the Parliament or the Office of the Executive) may have names peculiar to the community. For example, the set of government institutions in Catalonia and the Valencian Community are known as the ''[[Generalitat]]'', the Parliament of Asturias is known as the ''Junta General'' (lit. General Gathering or Assembly), whereas ''Xunta'' in Galicia is the denomination of the office of the executive, otherwise known simply as the "Government".

The official names of the autonomous communities can be in Spanish only (which applies to the majority of them), in the co-official language in the community only (as in the Valencian Community and the Balearic Islands), or in both Spanish and the co-official language (as in the Basque Country, Navarre and Galicia). Since 2006, [[Occitan]]—in its [[Aranese language|Aranese dialect]]—is also a co-official language in Catalonia, making it the only autonomous community whose  name has three official variants (Spanish: ''Cataluña'', Catalan: ''Catalunya'', Occitan: ''Catalonha'').

==Provinces==
[[File:Provinces of Spain.svg|thumb|650px|A map of Spain's provinces.]]
{{Main|Provinces of Spain}}

The provinces (''provincias'' in Spanish and Galician, ''províncies'' in Catalan, ''probintziak'' in Basque) are the second-level territorial and administrative divisions of Spain. The provincial scheme was created in 1833 by [[Javier de Burgos]] and based upon the limits of the old Hispanic kingdoms, though dividing them, if necessary, due to geographic and/or demographic reasons (i.e. to ensure a relative homogeneity in size and population).

This scheme has undergone only minor adjustments since 1833, most notably the division of the [[Canary Islands]] into two provinces in 1927. There are fifty provinces in Spain.

The province is a local entity with legal personality constituted by the aggregations of municipalities. The governance of provinces is carried out by Provincial Deputations or Councils, with the following exceptions:
* those autonomous communities consisting of a single province, in which case, the institutions of government of the autonomous community replace those of the province;
* the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]], in which the provinces are constituted as "historical territories" (''territorios históricos'' in Spanish, ''foru lurraldeak'' or ''lurralde historikoak'' in Basque), in which "Chartered Deputations" (''Diputaciones Forales'' in Spanish, ''Foru aldundiak'' in Basque) are in charge of both the political and fiscal administration of the territories; and
* the insular communities, that is, the [[Canary Islands]] and the [[Balearic Islands]], in which each island or group of islands is governed by  "Insular Deputations" (''Diputación insular'' in Spanish) or "Insular Councils" (''Consejo insular'' in Spanish, ''Consell Insular'' in Catalan).

The responsibilities of the provinces vary amongst the autonomous communities they belong to. Since the creation of the autonomous communities their scope of action is minimal, with the exception of the historical territories of the Basque Country. In all cases, they are guaranteed a legal status and autonomy to conduct their internal administration by the constitution.

The official names of the provinces can be in Spanish, the co-official language of the community they belong to, or both.

==Municipalities==
{{Main|Municipalities of Spain}}

The [[municipalities of Spain]] (''municipios'' or ''concejos''&lt;ref&gt;In [[Asturias]], municipalities are known as "councils" (''concejos'' in Spanish, ''conceyos'' in [[Asturian language]]). Other autonomous communities may also have ''consejos'' as territorial divisions which, however, do not correspond to municipalities&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], ''concellos'' in [[Galician language|Galician]], ''municipis'' in [[Catalan language|Catalan]], ''udalerriak'' in [[Basque language|Basque]]),&lt;ref&gt;Spanish is the official language of Spain. Galician, Catalan and Basque are coofficial in specific communities. Catalan is officially and statutorily designated as [[Valencian language|Valencian]] in the [[Valencian Community]]&lt;/ref&gt; constitute the lowest level of territorial organization in the country, and are guaranteed a measure of autonomy by the constitution.&lt;ref name=art140&gt;Article 140 of the Spanish Constitution of 1978&lt;/ref&gt; The administration of the municipalities corresponds to the [[Ayuntamiento (Spain)|ayuntamientos]] (''ayuntamientos'' in Spanish, ''concellos'' in Galician, ''ajuntament'' in Catalan, ''udalak'' in Basque) consisting of mayors and councillors, who are elected by universal suffrage.&lt;ref name=art140/&gt;

The municipalities are the basic entities of the territorial organization of the State, the immediate channels of the citizens' participation in public affairs.&lt;ref name=reguladora&gt;[http://noticias.juridicas.com/base_datos/Admin/l7-1985.html Ley 7/1985, de 2 de abril, Reguladora de las Bases del Régimen Local] art.11&lt;/ref&gt; The official names of the municipalities of Spain can be in Spanish—the official language of the country, in any of the co-official languages of the autonomous communities they belong to, if applicable, or in both.&lt;ref name=reguladora/&gt;

All citizens of Spain are required to register in the municipality they live in, and after doing so, they are juridically considered "neighbors" (residents) of the municipality, a designation that grants them various rights and privileges, and which entail certain obligations as well, including the right to vote or be elected for public office in said municipality.&lt;ref name=reguladora/&gt; The right to vote in municipal elections is extended to Spanish citizens living abroad. The Spaniard abroad, upon registering in a [[consulate]], has the right to vote in the local elections of the last municipality they resided in. A Spanish citizen born abroad must choose between the last municipality his or her mother or father last lived in.

==Other territorial entities==
The autonomous communities have the right to establish additional [[territorial entities]] in their internal territorial organizations, without eliminating the provinces or the municipalities (even if the latter can have a different name). Catalonia had created two types of additional territorial entities: the [[comarques of Catalonia|comarques]] and the [[vegueria|vegueries]], both of which had administrative powers and were initially recognized in the last [[Statute of Autonomy]] (organic law) of the community, but The Constitutional Court annulled, among others, the parts that modified the territorial organization. Almost all communities have defined territorial entities (e.g. ''comarcas'' or ''merindades''), but these do not have administrative powers and are simply geographic or historical designations.

One special case of such territorial entities is [[Western Sahara]], formerly the colony of [[Spanish Sahara]] up to 1976,&lt;ref&gt;CIA's The World Factbook [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/wi.html entry for Western Sahara]: "Western Sahara is a disputed territory on the northwest coast of Africa bordered by Morocco, Mauritania, and Algeria. After Spain withdrew from its former colony of Spanish Sahara in 1976, Morocco annexed the northern two-thirds of Western Sahara and claimed the rest of the territory in 1979, following Mauritania's withdrawal"&lt;/ref&gt; is disputed between [[Morocco]], who controls 80% of the territory and administers it as an integral part of its national territory, and the [[Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic]], who controls and administers the remaining 20% as the "[[Free Zone (region)|Liberated territories]]". The [[United Nations]], however still considers Spain to be the administrating state of the whole territory,&lt;ref&gt;UN General Assembly Resolution 34/37 and UN General Assembly Resolution 35/19&lt;/ref&gt; under the [[United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories|Non-Self-Governing Territories]] awaiting the outcome of the ongoing [[Manhasset negotiations]] and resulting election to be overseen by the [[United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara]].

{{Princely States topics}}
A '''salute state''' was a [[princely state]] under the [[British Raj]] during the time of [[British Empire|British rule]] which had been granted a [[gun salute]] by the [[British Crown]] (as [[paramount ruler]]); i.e., the protocolary privilege for its ruler to be greeted—originally by [[Royal Navy]] ships, later also on land—with a number of cannon shots, in graduations of two salutes from three to 21, as recognition of the state's relative status. The gun-salute system of recognition was first instituted during the time of the [[East India Company]] in the late 18th century and was continued under direct Crown rule from 1858.

As with the other princely states, the salute states varied greatly in size and importance. The states of Hyderabad and Jammu and Kashmir, both with a 21-gun salute, were each over 200,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in size, or slightly larger than the whole of [[Great Britain]]; in 1941, Hyderabad had a population of over 16,000,000, comparable to the population of [[Romania]] at the time, while Jammu and Kashmir had a population of slightly over 4 million, comparable to that of [[Switzerland]]. At the other end of the scale, Janjira and Sachin (11 and 9 guns, respectively, and both ruled by branches of the same dynasty) were respectively 137&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 127&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in size, or slightly larger than the island of [[Jersey]]; in 1941, Janjira had a population of nearly 14,000, the smallest of the salute states &lt;ref name="scale"&gt;{{cite book|pages=33–37|title=The India Office and Burma Office List: 1945|first= |last=|publisher=Harrison &amp; Sons, Ltd.|year=1945|ISBN=|subject=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  on the subcontinent.

For varying periods of time, a number of salute states in South Asia ([[Afghanistan]]), on the Indian subcontinent ([[Nepal]], [[Bhutan]], [[Sikkim]]) or in the Middle East (the Gulf/Trucial states and various states in the [[Aden Protectorate]]) were also under the British Raj as protectorates or protected states. As with the Indian principalities, those states received varying numbers of gun salutes and varied tremendously in terms of autonomy. Afghanistan and Nepal were both British ''protected states'' from the 19th century until 1921 and 1923, respectively, after which they were sovereign nations in direct relations with the British Foreign Office; while protected states, both enjoyed autonomy in internal affairs, though control of foreign affairs was left to the British. The states under the [[Persian Gulf Residency]] and the [[Aden Protectorate]] (part of the [[Bombay Presidency]] until 1937) ranged from Oman, a 21-gun-rated sultanate under a limited protectorate, to the 3-gun [[Trucial States]] which were near-total protectorates.

Following their independence in 1947, the new Indian and Pakistani governments maintained the gun-salute system until 1971 (in India) and 1972 (in Pakistan), when the former ruling families were officially derecognised. The Aden Protectorate was transferred to the control of the British Foreign Office in 1937 and eventually became the independent state of [[South Yemen]] in 1967, resulting in the abolition of its salute states the same year. Just prior to Indian independence in 1947, the Persian Gulf Residency was likewise transferred to Foreign Office control, remaining in existence until the Trucial States became fully independent in December 1971, forming the [[United Arab Emirates]] (UAE) in early 1972.

==Salute states and equivalents==
When the ruler of a [[princely state]] arrived at the Indian capital (originally at [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] (Kolkata), then at [[Delhi]]), he was greeted with a number of gun-firings. The number of these consecutive "gun salutes" changed from time to time, be increased or reduced depending on the degree of honour which the British chose to accord to a given ruler. The number of gun salutes accorded to a ruler was usually a reflection of the state of his relations with the British and/or his perceived degree of political power; a 21-gun salute was considered the highest. The King (or Queen) of the United Kingdom (who until 1948 was also the Emperor of India) was accorded a 101-gun salute, and 31 guns were used to salute the [[Governor-General of India|Viceroy of India]].

The number of guns in a salute assumed particular importance at the time of holding of the Coronation Durbar in Delhi in the month of December 1911. The Durbar was held to commemorate the Coronation of King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] with guns firing almost all day. At that time there were three Princely States that were given 21 gun salutes. These were:
*The [[Nizam of Hyderabad]]
*The Maharaja [[Gaekwad]] of [[Baroda State]]
*The Maharaja of [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore]]

In 1917, the [[Maharaja]] [[Scindia]] of [[Gwalior State|Gwalior]] was upgraded to a permanent and hereditary 21-gun salute, and the Maharaja of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] was granted the same in 1921. Both were granted the increased ranks as a result of the meritorious services of their soldiers in the [[World War I|First World War]].

Apart from these, no other Princely State received a 21-gun salute. Three of the most prominent princes, however, enjoyed a local salute of 21 guns within the limits of their own state and 19 guns in the rest of India. They were the Nawab (Begum) of [[Bhopal]], the Maharaja [[Holkar]] of [[Indore State|Indore]] and the Maharana of [[Udaipur]].

The [[Nizam]], Maharajas, Princes, etc. were all deeply keen on protocol and ensured that it was practised as a matter of faith. Any departure from it was not taken kindly by them. Salute of guns was one such protocol that was strictly adhered to.

===Classifications and sub-classifications of salute states===
At the time of Indian independence and partition in 1947, 118 (113 in [[Dominion of India|India]], 4 in [[Dominion of Pakistan|Pakistan]], plus [[Sikkim]]) of the roughly 565 princely states were classified as "salute states." 
* The rulers of the five premier states - [[Hyderabad State]], [[Kingdom_of_Mysore|Mysore]], Baroda, Jammu &amp; Kashmir and Gwalior - received 21-gun salutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=King of all rewinds |url=https://www.theweek.in/theweek/cover/king-of-all-rewinds.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The rulers of six others - Bhopal, Indore, Udaipur, Kolhapur, Travancore, and Kalat - received 19-gun salutes, with Bhopal, Indore and Udaipur entitled to a local 21-gun salute.{{Citation Needed|date=November 2018}}
* 88 were entitled to gun salutes ranging from 17 to 11 guns, with additional gun-salutes granted on a local or personal basis.
* The remaining 23 received a salute of nine guns. 

* Rulers with gun salutes of 11 guns or above, whether the salute was hereditary or local only, were entitled to the style of ''Highness''. 
* In 1918, the [[Nizam of Hyderabad]] was granted the unique style of ''[[Exalted Highness]]'', in recognition of the state's contributions to the Allied war effort during the First World War. &lt;ref name="Ark"&gt;[http://royalark.net/India/salute.htm India (Salute) - The Royal Ark]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1948, all rulers of nine-gun salute states were also granted the style of ''Highness''.

The salute states were broadly divided into two categories: the five premier states with a permanent 21-gun salute and with an individual resident, or envoy, stationed in each, and the remaining 113 states incorporated within political agencies (groups of states) under a political agent. The salutes were themselves organised in a strict hierarchy. Each ruling house of a salute state was entitled to a ''permanent'' hereditary salute. In some instances, one of three sub-categories consisting of an increase of 2 gun salutes could be awarded as follows:
*Personal and local: Hereditary to an individual state's ruler only within its borders, and personally to the ruler outside his state, but honouring his person and not the state when he was outside it. An award of a personal salute was only for the lifetime of the ruler, and was typically made for distinguished wartime or civic service.
*Personal: Only for the ruler personally, and not to distinguish his state as a whole.
*Local: Hereditary to an individual state's ruler only within its borders.

As a religious head, the Agha Khan received a personal 11-gun salute. In certain cases, a ruler of a non-salute state or a junior member of a princely family could merit a personal salute or the personal style of ''Highness''.

In 1948 The Hindu Rajput [[Maharana]] of Udaipur was raised to first place in the Order of Precedence, displacing the Muslim Nizam of Hyderabad and Berar due to his stubborn stance of not acceding to the union .&lt;ref name="Ark"/&gt; The system of gun salutes continued in the Republic of India until 1971.

Although salutes with many more guns have been used for Western Monarchs (and dynastic and other associated occasions), the [[21-gun salute]] has in modern times become customary for Sovereign Monarchs (hence also known as 'royal salute') and republic.

Some of the rulers not listed above were granted increased gun salutes after the independence, e.g. the [[Maharana]] of [[Mewar]] (at [[Udaipur]], ''Maharajpramukh'' in [[Rajasthan]]) was raised to first place in the Order of Precedence, displacing the Nizam of Hyderabad and Berar, and all 9-gun states were permitted the use of the style of Highness. However, it has not been possible to obtain complete details for all the rulers.

This system continued till 1971 when privileges and [[Privy Purse in India|Privy Purses]] of ex-rulers were abolished by the Government of India.

==Salute states that acceded to Pakistan==
{{Main|Princely states of Pakistan}}
Between August 1947 and March 1948, thirteen Muslim princely states in western India [[Instrument of Accession|acceded]] to the new [[Dominion of Pakistan]], created from [[British India]] by the [[Indian Independence Act 1947]], thus becoming the [[Princely states of Pakistan]]. Between 1955 and 1974, they were all amalgamated into larger federations and provinces. All of the princely states were in the western part of the country, so all were merged into the eventual [[West Pakistan]], which constitutes (since the breakaway of [[Bangla Desh]]) the present-day Republic of Pakistan.
 
The states retained internal autonomy so long as they existed, but all had lost this by 1974. The styles and titles enjoyed by the former ruling families ceased to be officially recognised by the Government of Pakistan, mostly in January 1972, with the exception of the small states of [[Hunza (princely state)|Hunza]] and [[Nagar (princely state)|Nagar]], which were shortly after incorporated into the [[Northern Areas (Pakistan)|Northern Areas of Pakistan]] in October 1974.

Four salute states acceded to Pakistan between 3 October 1947 and 27 March 1948. In order of precedence, they were as follows:

After ''several promotions and two further post-colonial awarding'' under the republic – which India didn't do – the gun salutes enjoyed by the states in Pakistan were as follows in 1966:

* Hereditary salute of ''21-guns (promoted)'': the [[Amir]] of [[Bahawalpur (princely state)|Bahawalpur]]
* Hereditary salute of 19-guns: the [[Khan (title)|Khan]] of [[Kalat (princely state)|Kalat]]

In 1890, [[Abdur Rahman Khan]], the Emir of Afghanistan, accepted for his kingdom the status of a British protected state under the British Raj, retaining internal autonomy while placing the state's foreign affairs under British control. In 1905, his son and successor, [[Habibullah Khan]], negotiated the Anglo-Afghan Treaty with the British, by which Afghanistan was ''de jure'' styled as a sovereign monarchy and the ruler recognised as King of Afghanistan (''Shah-e-Afghanistan'') with the style of ''His Majesty'', while remaining a protected state of Britain. In May 1919, King Habibullah's successor, King Amanullah, declared the country a wholly sovereign kingdom, which resulted in the [[Third Anglo-Afghan War]]. Despite a British victory, the British recognised the total sovereignty of Afghanistan in the Anglo-Afghan Treaty of Kabul in 1921; thereafter, Afghanistan continued to exist as a sovereign monarchy until the fall of the monarchy in 1973.

The [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] of 1816, which led to the defeat of the Gorkha Shah monarchy of Nepal, resulted in the kingdom becoming a ''de jure'' protectorate, but a ''de facto'' protected state of the [[East India Company]]. Following the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and the dissolution of the East India Company in 1858, the protectorate was transferred to the British crown through the British Raj, which recognised the monarch as "King of Nepal" with the style of ''His Majesty'' in 1919, due to the country's contributions to the Allied cause in the First World War. In 1923, the British government ended its protectorate and recognised Nepal as a wholly sovereign monarchy.&lt;ref name="salute"/&gt; While the semi-sovereign Rana oligarchy held power as hereditary [[Prime Minister of Nepal|Prime Ministers]] of Nepal until its deposition in 1951, the Nepalese monarchy continued until its abolition in 2008.

A brief war between Bhutan and the British Raj in 1864 resulted in the [[Treaty of Sinchula]], which forced Bhutan to relinquish territory and defined its relationship with the British. A loose agglomeration of semi-independent districts until 1907, Bhutan was unified in that year as a hereditary monarchy represented by [[Ugyen Wangchuck]], the ''penlop'' (or governor) of the district of Tongsa, who was proclaimed the ''Maharaja'' and ''Druk Gyalpo'' (Dragon King) of Bhutan.  In 1910, Bhutan signed the [[Treaty of Punakha]], under which the British Raj guaranteed Bhutan's internal sovereignty, but, as with Sikkim, maintained control over its foreign relations. A British residency was officially installed in Bhutan, with a resident deputed from the Indian Political Service and answerable to the British government in India. The treaty, which established Bhutanese sovereignty, albeit as a protected state, remained in force until Indian independence in 1947; at this time, Bhutan was offered the options of remaining independent or acceding to the new Indian Union. Choosing to maintain its independence, Bhutan formally established relations with India in 1949, signing the India-Bhutan Treaty of Friendship on 8 August 1949; while reaffirming Bhutanese sovereignty, the new treaty gave India control over Bhutan's foreign policy. In 1963, however, Bhutan promulgated a new constitution which replaced the title of ''His Highness the Maharaja'' with ''His Majesty the Druk Gyalpo'', formally promoting the country to the status of an independent, sovereign monarchy. In 1971, Bhutan joined the [[United Nations]] as a full member, and renegotiated the 1949 treaty with India in 2007, legally ending Bhutan's status as a protected state of India.

Though officially considered a princely state under its ruler, the Maharaja Chogyal, Sikkim was given the separate status of a British protectorate in 1861 under the [[Treaty of Tumlong]], by which the British government could intervene in the state's internal affairs and oversee all external matters; despite this, Sikkim maintained a high degree of autonomy in practice. In 1947, the Maharaja Chogyal and his people decided against accession to India and chose to maintain Sikkim's internal sovereignty. The state formally became a protectorate of India in 1950. Following the death of the Maharaja Chogyal in 1963 and his succession by his unpopular son, [[Palden Thondup Namgyal]], popular demands for increased individual rights grew more frequent. After Sikkim's first free general elections in 1974, the Indian Army placed the Chogyal under house arrest. Under military supervision, a controversial referendum was held in 1975, which approved the state's merger with India and the abolition of the monarchy. Sikkim was formally merged into India as its 22nd state on 
26 April 1975.

====Middle East Protectorates - Aden Protectorate (until 1917)====
The following were constituent states of the [[Aden Protectorate]] from the late 19th century until their independence and merger with [[South Yemen]] in 1967 when the states were abolished. The protectorate was under the British Raj and governed as part of the [[Bombay Presidency]] until 1917 when the protectorate was transferred to the control of the British Foreign Office.

====Middle East Protectorates - Persian Gulf Residency====
The Persian Gulf Residency was established in 1822 during the time of the East India Company, though the company had established a residency at Bushehr in 1763. It was made subordinate to the [[Governor of Bombay]] until 1873. As with the rest of British India, it came under the control of the British Crown in 1858. In 1873, the residency came under the direct control of the British Raj and the India Office. In 1892, it officially assumed a protectorate status over the states of Muscat and Oman, Bahrain and the Trucial States, followed by Kuwait in 1914 and Qatar in 1916. In 1920, the [[Treaty of Seeb]] recognised the ''de jure'' independence of Oman. The residency was transferred to the charge of the British Foreign Office from the India Office in 1947, shortly before Indian independence. In 1961, Kuwait became the first of the Gulf States to terminate its protectorate and become fully independent, with Muscat and Oman being recognised by Britain as an independent, protected state the following year. With the increasing costs of maintaining an overseas presence, Britain announced in January 1968 that it would end its protectorate over the remaining Gulf states in 1971. The protectorates were finally terminated in December 1971; Muscat and Oman became the modern sultanate of [[Oman]] that year, and the erstwhile Trucial States became the United Arab Emirates in 1972.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11119">{{short description|The area of sea ice relative to the total area at a given point in the ocean}}
'''Sea ice concentration''' is a useful variable for [[climatology|climate]]
scientists and nautical [[navigators]].  It is defined as the area of
[[sea ice]] relative to the total at a given point in the [[ocean]].
This article will deal primarily with its determination from [[remote sensing]] measurements.

==Significance==

Sea ice concentration helps determine a number of other important climate
variables.  Since the [[albedo]] of ice is much higher than that of water,
ice concentration will regulate [[insolation]] in the polar oceans.
When combined with [[sea ice thickness|ice thickness]], it determines
several other important [[flux]]es between the air and sea,
such as salt and fresh-water fluxes between the polar oceans
(see for instance [[bottom water]]) as well as
[[heat flux|heat transfer]] between the atmosphere.
Maps of sea ice concentration can be used to determine
[[Measurement of sea ice#ice area|ice area]] and
[[Measurement of sea ice#ice extent|ice extent]], both of which are important
markers of [[climate change]].

Ice concentration charts are also used by navigators to determine
potentially passable regions—see [[icebreaker]].

==Methods==

===In situ===

Measurements from ships and aircraft are based on simply calculating
the relative area of ice versus water visible within the scene.
This can be done using photographs or by eye.
In situ measurements are used to validate remote sensing
measurements.

===SAR and visible===

Both [[synthetic aperture radar]] and visible sensors (such as [[Landsat]])
are normally high enough resolution that each pixel is simply classified
as a distinct surface type, i.e. water versus ice.  The concentration can then be
determined by counting the number of ice pixels in a given area which
is useful for validating concentration estimates from lower resolution
instruments such as microwave radiometers.  Since SAR images are normally
monochrome and the [[backscatter]] of ice can vary quite considerably,
classification is normally done based on texture using groups of
pixels—see [[pattern recognition]].

Visible sensors have the disadvantage of being quite weather sensitive—images are obscured by clouds—while SAR sensors, especially in the
higher resolution modes, have a limited coverage and must be pointed.
This is why the tool of choice for determining ice concentration is
often a passive microwave sensor.

===Microwave radiometry===
[[File:Oldest Arctic Sea Ice is Disappearing.png|left|thumb|Arctic sea ice coverage in 1980 (bottom) and 2012 (top), as observed by passive microwave sensors on NASA’s Nimbus-7 satellite and by the Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder (SSMIS) from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP).

All warm bodies emit electro-magnetic radiation: see [[thermal radiation]].
Since different objects will emit differently at different frequencies,
we can often determine what type of object we are looking at based on its emitted
radiation—see [[spectroscopy]].  This principle underlies all ''passive''
microwave sensors and most passive infrared sensors.  Passive is used in the
sense that the sensor only measures radiation that has been emitted by other
objects but does not emit any of its own.
(A SAR sensor, by contrast, is ''active''.) [[SSMR]] and [[SSMI]] radiometers were flown on the [[Nimbus program]] and [[Defense Meteorological Satellite Program|DMSP]] series of satellites.

Because clouds are translucent in the microwave regime, especially
at lower frequencies, microwave radiometers are quite weather insensitive.
Since most microwave radiometers operate along a [[polar orbit]] with
a broad, sweeping scan, full ice maps of the polar regions where
the swaths are largely overlapping can usually be obtained within one day.
This frequency and reliability comes at the cost of a poor resolution:
the angular [[field of view]] of an [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] is directly
[[proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the [[wavelength]]
and inversely proportional to the effective [[aperture]] area.
Thus we need a large deflector dish to compensate for a low frequency
.&lt;ref name="Ulaby_etal1986"/&gt;

Most ice concentration algorithms based on microwave radiometry
are predicated on the dual observation that: 1. different surface types
have different, strongly clustered, microwave signatures and
2. the radiometric signature at the instrument head is a linear
combination of that of the different surface types, with the weights
taking on the values of the relative concentrations.
If we form a vector space from each of the instrument channels
in which all but one of the signatures of the different surface types
are linearly independent, then it is straightforward to solve for
the relative concentrations:

:&lt;math&gt;
\vec T_b = \vec T_{b0} + \sum_{i=1}^n(\vec T_{bi} - \vec T_{b0})C_i
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\vec T_b&lt;/math&gt; is the radiometric signature at the
instrument head (normally measured as a [[brightness temperature]]),
&lt;math&gt;\vec T_{b0}&lt;/math&gt; is the signature of the nominal
background surface type (normally water),
&lt;math&gt;\vec T_{bi}&lt;/math&gt; is the signature of the ''i''th
surface type while ''C&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are the relative
concentrations.

Every operational ice concentration algorithm is predicated on this
principle or a slight variation.
The NASA team algorithm, for instance, works by taking the
difference of two channels and dividing by their sum.
This makes the retrieval slightly [[nonlinear]], but with
the advantage that the influence of temperature is mitigated.
This is because brightness temperature varies roughly linearly
with physical temperature when all other things are equal—see [[emissivity]]—and because the sea ice emissivity at different microwave
channels is strongly correlated.&lt;ref name="Rothrock_etal1988"/&gt;
As the equation suggests, concentrations of multiple ice
types can potentially be detected, with NASA team distinguishing between
first-year and multi-year ice (see image above).

A number of factors act to reduce the accuracy of the retrievals, the most obvious being variations in the microwave signatures produced by a given surface type.
For sea ice, the presence of snow, variations in salt and moisture content, the presence of melt ponds as well as variations in surface temperature will all produce strong variations in the microwave signature of a given ice type.  New and thin ice in particular will often have a microwave signature closer to that of open water.  This is normally because of its high salt content, not because of radiation being transmitted from the water through the ice—see [[sea ice emissivity modelling]].
The presence of waves and surface roughness will change the signature over open water.  Adverse weather conditions, [[clouds]] and [[humidity]] in particular, will also tend to reduce the accuracy of retrievals.&lt;ref name="smos_final"/&gt;

:''This article is about '''Space-based radar''' as [[space radio station]] (in line to article 1.64, [[ITU Radio Regulations|ITU RR]]) and should not be confused with the [[radiolocation-satellite service]] in the meaning of a [[radiocommunication service]] in line to articles 1.19 and 1.49 (ITU RR).

[[File:ORS-2.jpg|thumb|ORS-2]]
Space-based [[radar]] refers to [[Outer space|space]]-borne radar systems that may have any of a variety of purposes.  A number of earth-observing radar satellites, such as [[RADARSAT]], have employed synthetic aperture radar (SAR) to obtain terrain and land-cover information about the [[Earth]]. 

== Military ==

In the United States, Discoverer II was a proposed military space-based radar program initiated in February 1998 as a joint Air Force, [[DARPA]], and [[National Reconnaissance Office|NRO]] program.  The concept was to provide high-range-resolution ground [[moving target indication]] (GMTI), as well as SAR imaging and high-resolution digital mapping.  This program was cancelled by Congress in 2007.  SBR is a less-ambitious version of Discoverer II.

'''Space-based radar''' ('''SBR''') is a proposed constellation of active [[radar]] [[satellite]]s for the [[United States]] [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]. The SBR system would allow detection and tracking of [[aircraft]], ocean-going vessels (similar to the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[US-A]] program), and potentially land vehicles from space. This information would then be relayed to regional and national command centers, as well as [[E-10 MC2A]] airborne command posts.

* Russian [[Kondor (satellite)|Kondor]]

== Earth-observing radars ==

Use of radar sensor for [[Earth observation]] purposes was started by [[Nasa|NASA]]/[[Jet Propulsion Laboratory|JPL]]'s  [[Seasat]] satellite, which carried three different radar sensors: 
* a [[synthetic aperture radar]] (SAR) for high-resolution imaging
* a [[radar altimeter]], to measure the ocean topography
* a wind [[scatterometer]] to measure wind speed and direction

After [[Seasat]], SARs, altimeters and scatterometers have been flown on several other space missions.

While the SAR, in principle, is similar to its airborne counterparts (with the advantage of the increased coverage and worldwide access offered by the satellite platform), the other two are specific to satellite operations.

A satellite radar-altimeter is a [[nadir]]-looking radar with very high range resolution, which measures the [[ocean surface topography]] with an accuracy in the order of few centimeters. Additionally, analysis of the echo amplitude and shape can extract information about the wind speed and wave height, respectively.
Some radar-altimeters (like [[CryoSat]]/SIRAL) employ [[synthetic aperture radar|synthetic aperture]] and/or [[Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar|interferometric]] techniques: their reduced footprint allows mapping of rougher surfaces like polar ices.

A wind [[scatterometer]] observes the same portion of the ocean surface from different (at least 3) angles of view as the satellite passes by, measuring the echo amplitude and the corresponding surface reflectivity. Reflectivity being affected by the ocean surface "roughness", which in turn is affected by the wind and also dependent on its direction, this instrument can determine the wind speed and direction.

These three types of radar are currently used on several satellites. [[Scatterometer]]s are of high value for operational meteorology, allowing reconstruction of [[wind field]]s on a global scale. Data from [[radar altimeter]]s are used for the accurate determination of the geoid, monitoring of tides, ocean currents and other large-scale ocean phenomena such as [[El Niño]].

SARs applications are many: they range from geology to crop monitoring, from [[measurement of sea ice]] to disaster monitoring to vessel traffic surveillance, not to forget the military applications (many civilian SAR satellites are, in fact, dual-use systems). SAR imaging offer the great advantage, over its optical counterparts, of not being affected by meteorological conditions such as clouds, fog, etc., making it the sensor of choice when continuity of data must be ensured. 
Additionally, [[Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar|SAR interferometry]] (both dual-pass or single-pass, as used in the [[Shuttle Radar Topography Mission|SRTM]] mission) allows accurate 3-D Reconstruction.

Other types of radars have been flown for earth observation missions: precipitation radars such as the [[Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission]], or cloud radars like the one used on [[Cloudsat]].

Like other [[Earth observation satellite]]s, radar satellites often use [[sun-synchronous orbit]]s so that diurnal variations of vegetation are ignored, allowing long-term variations to be more accurately measured.

*[[RISAT-1]] (SAR,ISRO India, 2012)
*[[RORSAT]] (SAR, Soviet Union, 1967-1988)

== Planetary radars ==
Most of the radars flown as payload in planetary missions (i.e., not considering avionics radar, such as docking and landing radars used in [[Project Apollo|Apollo]] and [[Apollo Lunar Module|LEM]]) belong to two categories: imaging radars and sounders.

'''Imaging radars''': [[Synthetic aperture radar]]s are the only instruments capable of penetrating heavy cloud cover around planets such as [[Venus]], which was the first target for such missions. Two Soviet spacecraft ([[Venera 15]] and [[Venera 16]]) imaged the planet in 1983 and 1984 using SAR and [[Radar altimeter]]s. The [[Magellan probe]] also imaged Venus in 1990 and 1994.

The only other target of an [[imaging radar]] mission has been [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], the largest moon of [[Saturn]], in order to penetrate its opaque atmosphere. The radar of the [[Cassini probe]], which orbited [[Saturn]] between 2004 and 2017, provided images of [[Titan (moon)|Titan's]] surface during each fly-by of the moon. The Cassini radar was a multimode system and could operate as [[Synthetic Aperture Radar]], [[radar altimeter]], [[scatterometer]] and [[radiometer]].

'''Sounding radars''': these are low-frequency (normally, HF - 3 to 30&amp;nbsp;MHz - or lower) ground-penetrating [[Radars]], used to acquire data about the planet sub-surface structure. Their low operating frequency allow them to penetrate hundreds of meters, or even kilometers, below the surface. Synthetic aperture techniques are normally exploited to reduce the ground footprint (due to the low operating frequency and the small allowable [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] dimensions, the beam is very wide) and, thus, the unwanted echo from other surface objects.

The first radar sounder flown was [[ALSE]] (Apollo Lunar Sounder Experiment) on board [[Apollo 17]] in 1972.

Other sounder instruments flown (in this case around [[Mars]]), are [[MARSIS]] (Mars Advanced Radar for SubSurface and [[Ionosphere]] Sounding) on board the [[European Space Agency]]'s [[Mars Express]] probe, and [[SHARAD]] (mars SHAllow RADar sounder) on [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory|JPL]]'s [[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]] (MRO). Both are currently operational. A radar sounder is also used on the Japanese Moon probe [[SELENE]], launched  September 14, 2007.

A similar instrument (primarily devoted to ionospheric [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] probing) was embarked on the Japanese Martian mission [[Nozomi (probe)|Nozomi]] (launched in 1998 but lost).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5568">Temporary adjustments are set of operations which are performed on a [[theodolite]] to make it ready for taking observations. These include its initial setting up on a tripod or other stand, centering, levelling up and focusing of eyepiece.

==Initial setting==
[[File:theodolite vermeer.svg|thumb|The measurement axes and scales of a theodolite]]
&lt;div&gt;The initial setting operation includes fixing the theodolite on a [[tripod]], along with approximate levelling and centering over the station mark. For setting up the instrument, the tripod is placed over the station with its legs widely spread so that the centre of the tripod head lies above the station point and its head approximately level (by eye estimation). The instrument is then fixed with the tripod by screwing through the trivet.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The height of the instrument should be such that observer can see through [[telescope]] conveniently. After this, a [[plumb bob]] is suspended from the bottom of the instrument and it should approximately align with the station mark.&lt;/div&gt;

==Centering==
[[image:Tribrach for surveying instruments.JPG|right|thumb|A tribrach with an optical plummet (the black cylinder pointing to the left lower corner of the image).]]
&lt;div&gt;Centering means bringing the [[vertical axis]] of the theodolite exactly over the station mark.&lt;ref&gt;Text book on surveying by prof. C.L Kochher, page no. 341. Retrieved on 16 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; Exact centering is done by using the shifting head of the instrument. During this, first the screw-clamping ring of the sliding head is loosened and the upper plate of the shifting head is slid over the lower one until the plumb bob is exactly over the station mark. After the exact centering, the screw clamping ring is tightened. This can be done by means of a forced centering plate or [[tribrach (instrument)|tribrach]]. An optical or laser plummet is normally used for the most accurate setting. The centering and levelling of the instrument is interactive and iterative; a re-levelling may change the centering, so error each is eliminated in successively until negligible.

==Levelling==
[[File:Green bull's eye level (level).jpg|thumb|Bull's eye level with alignment rings]]
[[File:Theodolite in use.JPG|thumb|Theodolite in use with cones to protect tripod positioning]]
Leveling of an instrument is done to make it vertical axis with respect to the apparent force of gravity at the station.

For two spirit vials at right angles;

# Bring one of the level tubes parallel to any two of the foot screws, by rotating the upper part of the instrument.
# The bubble is brought to the centre of the level tube by rotating both the foot screws either inward or outward. The bubble moves in the same direction as the left thumb.
# The bubble of the other level tube is then brought to the centre of the level tube by rotating the third foot screw either inward or outward. [In step 1 itself, the other plate level will be parallel to the line joining the third foot screw and the centre of the line joining the previous two foot screws.]
# Repeat Step 2 and step 3 in the same quadrant till both the bubble remain central.
# By rotating the upper part of the instrument through 180°, the level tube is brought parallel to first two-foot screws in reverse order. The bubble will remain in the centre if the instrument is in permanent adjustment.
Otherwise, repeat the whole process starting from step 1 to step 5.

The same principle applies for a bulls-eye level:

# Bring the level parallel to any two of the foot screws, by rotating the upper part of the instrument.
# The bubble is brought to the centre of the level tube by rotating both the foot screws either inward or outward.
# Rotate the upper part of the instrument through 180°, so the level is over the remaining foot screw. The bubble will remain in the centre if the instrument is in permanent adjustment. If not adjust this screw to halve the error. Then rotate back through 180 degrees and check the error. Adjust those screws to halve the residual error.  Continue until the bubble is always central on the ring.

==Focusing==
To obtain an accurate clear sighting, the cross hairs should be in focus; adjust the eyepiece to do this.

* '''Focusing of eyepiece lens'''.
For focusing of the eye piece, point the telescope to the [[sky]] or hold a piece of white paper in front of telescope. Move the eye-piece in and out until a distinct sharp black image of the cross-hairs is seen. This confirms proper focusing.&lt;ref&gt;Text book on surveying by prof. C.L Kochher on Page no. 342. Retrieved on 16 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
To Clearly view the object being sighted Focus the objective lens.

* '''Focusing of objective lens'''.
It is done for each independent observation to bring the image of the object in the plane of cross hairs. It includes following steps of operation: First, direct the [[telescope]] towards the object for observation. Next, turn the focusing screw until the image of the object appears clear and sharp as the observer looks through properly focused eye-piece. If focusing has been done properly, there will be no parallax i.e., there will be no apparent movement of the image relative to the cross hairs if the observer moves his eye from one side to the other or from top to bottom.

'''Thembuland''', {{lang-af|Temboeland}}, is a [[natural region]] in the [[Eastern Cape]] province of [[South Africa]]. Its territory is the [[traditional region]] of the [[Thembu people]], one of the sub-groups of the [[Xhosa people|Xhosa nation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Tembu |volume=26 |page=577}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was formerly also known as "Tamboekieland" or "Tambookieland". The area of Thembuland proper includes present-day [[Mthatha]], [[Mqanduli]], [[Ngcobo]], [[Mjanyana]], [[Dutywa]] and [[Willowvale]] as well as their surroundings.

==Geography==
Thembuland was historically defined as the area between [[Umtata]] and the upper [[Kei River]]. As such it formed an area of 50 by 120 miles, although its boundary was considered disputable with [[Pondoland]] on the coast, and with [[Fingoland]] just to the south. The definition of the area has also changed over time.

Before colonial conquest, it was divided into Tembuland Proper, Emigrant Tembuland and [[Bomvanaland]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Kaffraria |volume=15 |page=629}}&lt;/ref&gt; — the [[Bomvana]] were a related people who lived on the east bank of the [[Bashee River]], in what was later the district of Elliotdale. In colonial times it was defined as consisting of the districts of [[Emjanyana]], [[Engcobo]], [[Mqanduli]], [[Umtata]], [[St Mark's, Eastern Cape|St Marks]], [[Southeyville]] and [[Xalanga]].

==History==
===Early history===
The hunter-gatherer [[Bushmen|San]] and [[Khoikhoi]] people inhabited the region in scattered nomadic groups from {{circa}} 30,000 BCE. In the 16th century, iron-working [[Nguni people|Nguni farmers]] entered the area from the north-east. A sub-group of the Nguni peoples became the [[Thembu people]]. Although originally classed{{by whom?|date=November 2016}} as a separate Nguni nation, the Thembu subsequently assimilated to a large degree with the neighbouring Xhosa people.

Thembuland became an independent [[monarchy|kingdom]], ruled by the Hala royal clan. British interference and incursions began in the 19th century. 
From 1871 the Thembu became engaged in a protracted war against an alliance of neighbouring Xhosa-speaking peoples, including the [[Pondo people|Pondo]], the [[Bomvana]] and the [[Gcaleka]]. The Thembu Paramount-Chief, Ngangelizwe, had sought to unite the various Thembu clans but had come under increasing military pressure from [[Sarhili]], Paramount-Chief of the [[Gcaleka]]. The conflict had a personal side, as Ngangelizwe's Chief Wife Novili was the daughter of Sarhili, and rumours had been spread{{by whom?|date=November 2016}} that Ngangelizwe had ill-treated her.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

|publisher= Findarticles.com |date= |accessdate= 2012-07-16
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; 

Facing severe military pressure from the combined armies of his enemies, Chief Ngangelizwe and his Ministers approached the nominally-independent [[Cape Colony]] to negotiate alliance and possible incorporation.

===Incorporation into the Cape Colony===
The Cape Colony, having recently achieved a degree of independence from Britain under the system of [[Responsible Government]], operated under a relatively inclusive system of multi-racial franchise - whereby qualifications for suffrage applied equally to all male residents, regardless of race. Its laws also forbade any white settlement in traditional "Native territory". The Cape was therefore viewed by Ngangelizwe and his ministers as a satisfactory entity to merge with.&lt;ref&gt;S. Redding: ''Sorcery And Sovereignty: Taxation, Power, And Rebellion in South Africa, 1880-1963''. Ohio University Press, 2006. p.150.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.A. Tropp: ''Natures of Colonial Change: Environmental Relations in the Making of the Transkei''. Ohio University Press, 2009. p.33.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Ngangelizwe however, was a highly controversial leader in the Xhosa-speaking community. He was hated by many in the neighbouring Pondo and Gcaleka states, and accused of a range of crimes. The Cape Government demanded his resignation, as a precondition for any annexation.&lt;ref&gt;M. Lipschutz: ''Dictionary of African Historical Biography''. University of California Press, 1989. p.171. ''"Ngangelizwe (Qeya), c.1840-84"''.&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to Cape Parliamentary records, the Thembu leaders demanded, among other things, 4 magistracies with equal access to the Cape's current system of nonracial franchise, and military protection from both the British and their Gcaleka enemies. If these conditions were incorporated into law, together with respect for the traditional authority of the chiefs, then they would request incorporation.&lt;ref&gt;C.C. Henkel: ''History, resources and productions of the country between Cape Colony and Natal, or "Kaffraria proper", now called the Native or Transkeian Territories''. Hamburg Richter. 1903. p.10. ''"Tembuland"''.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Cape government agreed to these terms and signed them into law with the ''Tembuland Annexation Act (1876)'', creating the magisterial districts of Xalanga, St. Marks, Elliot and Engcobo. Additional stipulations of the 1876 act were that the Thembu traditional government system was to get full government recognition; Thembu King, Chiefs and Subchiefs were to earn government salaries; normal taxation would only begin in 1878; the boundaries of Thembuland were final and were not to be altered in any way; and that the sale of alcohol be prohibited to Thembu subjects.&lt;ref&gt;MS18534. N.C. Tisani, E.G. Sihele: ''Who are the AbaThembu and where do the come from?'' Council of the Thembu King of Roda. pp.115-116.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ohioswallow.com/extras/0821416987_chapter_01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The resignation of the controversial Thembu King Ngangelizwe, in favour of his successor, had initially been demanded by the Cape government as a precondition for annexation, but this condition was waived as being impractical. 
Otherwise, the terms of the incorporation were implemented as stated. Traditional land ownership was fully recognised and, with the exception of a few missionaries and white traders, Thembuland was preserved for Thembu occupation, as part of the "Transkeian territories". However, the British overthrow of the elected Cape government in 1878 and assumption of direct rule over the Cape Colony caused the Confederation Wars, and the later disruption of the treaty's peaceful implementation.  

The annexation was only finally completed in 1885. Thembuland was defined at the time as being the territory between Umtata and the Tsomo River, and home to 60,000 people. Thembuland also submitted troops to the Frontier Armed forces of the Cape Colony, who, in this capacity, fought several victorious campaigns against their [[Gcaleka]] and [[Pondo people|Mpondo]] enemies.

===Early political restrictions===
{{main|Cape Qualified Franchise#Erosion and abolition}}
According to the original laws of the Cape Colony, as well as the terms of the Annexation Act, Europeans were prohibited from owning land in the Thembu territories. This was initially intended to prevent the dispossession of the Thembu by aggressive settlers, however in the ensuing political upheavals, the law was badly enforced. 

From the 1880s, the pro-imperialist governments of Prime Ministers [[John Gordon Sprigg]] and [[Cecil Rhodes]] turned a blind eye to white incursions. Already by 1882, white settlers had illegally moved north of the Great Kei River and, in the same year, Chief Ngangelizwe himself sold territory within Umtata district to white land owners. 

In 1894, the ''Glen Gray Act'' constituted the Thembu chiefs as leaders of "District Councils", thereby establishing a system of proxy rulers. The Government of [[Cecil Rhodes]] passed legislation, such as the ''Parliamentary Registration Act'', that severely curtailed the voting rights of the Thembu and all Black African citizens of the Cape. However it was the Union of South Africa, in the Twentieth Century, that was to oversee the greatest growth in oppression against the people of Thembuland. 

===The Union of South Africa and Apartheid history===
Later, in the lead up to the [[Union of South Africa]] and the beginning of [[Apartheid]], the franchise and property rights of the Thembu were gradually revoked, and what rights remained were applied only in their original homeland.

Later still, under apartheid, the [[Transkei]] was turned into a [[bantustan]].  In the ethnic theory underpinning [[apartheid]], the Transkei was regarded as the "homeland" of the Xhosa people.  As a result, the Thembu people are often misidentified as being Xhosa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sahistory.org.za/places/transkei SAhistory -Transkei]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=September 2015}}

===Secession dispute===
The current Thembu king is King [[Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo]], son of [[Sabata Jonguhlanga Dalindyebo]], and his [[Isibongo|praise name]] is ''Zwelibanzi''. 

The King caused controversy in 2009, by calling for secession from South Africa, as a response to a criminal case against him. In December 2009 King Buyelekhaya was convicted of offences including [[culpable homicide]], [[kidnapping]], [[arson]] and [[assault]]. In response he proposed secession from South Africa&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?art_id=vn20091206081352898C719198|title=Troubled monarch sentenced to 15 years|author=Janet Smith, Bonile Bam|date=6 December 2009|publisher=[[Independent Online (South Africa)]]|accessdate=16 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?art_id=vn20091223072722238C767265|title=Convicted king plans independent state|date=23 December 2009|author=Ben Maclennan|publisher=iol.co.za|accessdate=16 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later demanded that the South African government pay the king R900m and the tribe a further R80bn in compensation for the humiliation caused by the criminal trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news24.com/Content/SouthAfrica/News/1059/d73b673c21fd43a8a35f7fbcd88b487c/06-01-2010-06-02/Tribe_suspends_secession_plans|title=Tribe suspends secession plans|date=6 January 2010|publisher=news24.com|accessdate=16 July 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120910205654/http://www.news24.com/Content/SouthAfrica/News/1059/d73b673c21fd43a8a35f7fbcd88b487c/06-01-2010-06-02/Tribe_suspends_secession_plans|archivedate=10 September 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also a writer, who wrote about the history of the [[West Indies]].

==Life==

He was born in [[Southwark]], and was apprenticed to [[Emanuel Bowen]] in 1732. Originally based in [[Clerkenwell]], by late 1755 Kitchin was established on [[Holborn]] Hill.  From 1773 Kitchin was royal hydrographer to the king. He married Sarah Bowen, daughter of [[Emanuel Bowen|Emanuel]], in 1739, and then Jane, daughter of [[Joseph Burroughs]], in 1762. He died in [[St Albans]] on 23 June 1784. Kitchin lived and worked in [[London]] until his retirement.&lt;ref name=WDL1/&gt;

He produced [[John Elphinstone]]'s map of Scotland (1746), ''Geographia Scotiae'' (1749), and ''The Small English Atlas'' (1749) with [[Thomas Jefferys]]. ''The Large English Atlas'' (with Bowen 1749–60) was a serious attempt to cover England  at large scale. In 1755 Kitchin engraved the [[Mitchell Map]] of North America.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} He worked for ''[[London Magazine]]''.&lt;ref name=WDL1/&gt; He produced 170 maps for ''London Magazine'' (1747–83).{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Kitchin was the head [[hydrographer]] for the [[King of England]].

'''Tim O'Riordan''' [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire|OBE]] [[Deputy Lieutenant|DL]] [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] (born {{Birth date|1942|02|21|df=y}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whoswho/U28955 O’RIORDAN, Prof. Timothy], ''Who's Who 2014'', A &amp; C Black, 2014; online edn, Oxford University Press, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; is a British geographer who is Emeritus Professor of Environmental Sciences at the [[University of East Anglia]] (UEA) and a prominent British environmental writer and thinker.

==Background==
O'Riordan grew up in the north of England, and was educated at the [[University of Edinburgh]] (MA, Geography), [[Cornell University]] (MS, Water Resources Engineering), and [[King's College, Cambridge]] (PhD in Geography).

He taught at [[Simon Fraser University]] in Canada in the late 1960s, before talking up a lectureship at UEA. He retired as Professor in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.landscapesforlifeconference.org.uk/2013/07/interview-with-tim-oriodan/&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a founder and deputy director (1991-) of the Centre for Social and Economic Research on the Global Environment (CSERGE) at UEA.

He was widowed and has two daughters and lives in Norwich.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/in-the-news-tim-oriordan/171249.article&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributions==
O'Riordan's contributions are to environmental policy analysis; environmental appraisal and evaluation; and environmental governance and decision-making. In 1981 he published ''Environmentalism'', one of the first critical summaries of the field. Latterly he has worked on interdisciplinary approaches pursuing the transition to sustainability, becoming active in the development of [[sustainability science]] partnerships. In 2014 he called for a "science for sustainable development which is geared to compassion, fairness, empathy, and social justice."&lt;ref&gt;http://talks.cam.ac.uk/talk/index/50033 Talk at Univ. of Cambridge, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; For him, "Sustainability is not a word but a way of becoming."&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.cardiff.ac.uk/environmentalfuturesdialogue/2014/02/13/reflections-on-the-environmental-futures-dialogue-from-tim-oriordan/&lt;/ref&gt; His work has been cited over 16,500 times.&lt;ref&gt;Google Scholar, Jan 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

His engaged and more practical work relates to designing future coastlines in East Anglia in England so that they are ready for sea level rise and the creation of sound economies and societies for a sustainable future, using participatory democratic decisionmaking; he has worked in Broadland since the late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;http://cserge.ac.uk/sites/default/files/gec_1997_11.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Riordan has edited a number of books on the institutional aspects of global environmental change, and policy and practice, including two editions of the textbook, ''Environmental Science for Environmental Management''. His work on European environmental policy and risk management is summarised in several volumes. He is editor of the prominent magazine/journal ''[[Environment (magazine)|Environment]].''

He has worked on the greening of business, participating in the Prince of Wales' seminar on Business and the Environment, and has sat on several advisory boards including the Corporate Responsibility Body for [[Asda]] plc, and the Growth and Climate Change Panel for Anglian Water Group. He was a member of the UK Sustainable Development Commission&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sd-commission.org.uk/&lt;/ref&gt; until it was closed down by the government in 2011.

The '''Tropical Andes''' are the northern of the three climate-delineated parts of the [[Andes]], the others being the [[Dry Andes]] and the [[Wet Andes]]. The Tropical Andes' area spans {{convert|1542644|km2|abbr=on}}.

== The land==
The Tropical Andes are located in South America following the path of the Andes. They run, mainly, through five countries, [[Venezuela]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Peru]], and [[Bolivia]]. The land initially was roughly {{convert|1258000|km2|abbr=on}} but has decreased to {{convert|314500|km2|abbr=on}}, leaving 25% of the original land. Due to the massive amount of area the landscape is diverse. Diverse landscapes lead to diverse habitats and the ability to provide needed resources for many species. The diverse landscape includes snow-topped mountains down to [[canyon]]s and valleys. The different vegetation as altitude changes includes [[tropical rainforest]]s at {{convert|500|to(-)|1500|m|sp=us}}, [[cloud forests]] ranging from {{convert|800|to(-)|3500|m|sp=us}}, and the highest altitudes of {{convert|3000|to(-)|4800|m|sp=us}} contain [[grassland]]s up to snow. The most diverse [[cloud forest]]s found in Peru and Bolivia covers {{convert|500000|km2|abbr=on}}. Dry forests and woodlands are also found throughout the Tropical Andes. The range is also home to the deepest gorge in Peru at {{convert|3223|m|sp=us}} deep and [[Lake Titicaca]], the highest navigable water with an altitude of {{convert|3810|m|sp=us}}.

==Biodiversity==
The Tropical Andes are a [[biodiversity]] hotspot named the "global epicenter of biodiversity" according to the [[Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund]].{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

The Tropical Andes are an area of rich [[biodiversity]]. This location contains about 45,000 plant species of which 20,000 are endemic. There are over 3,000 vertebrate species with about 1,500 endemic. Besides plants and vertebrates, 1,666 bird species, 479 reptile species, and 830 amphibian species reside in the Tropical Andes. All hotspots are important for [[conservation biology]], but especially the tropical Andes with so many endemic species. The biodiversity within the Tropical Andes is dwindling in numbers due to threats.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

The diversity between vegetation throughout altitudes was further studied in Colombia. Chengyu Weng studied how pollen diversity is affected by different temperatures due to changing altitudes. The team studied different vegetations, the subandean forest, Andean forest, subparamo and grassparamo located in the Andes. There was more plant diversity as altitude increased throughout the vegetations. Pollen diversity positively correlated with more diversity at lower altitudes.&lt;ref&gt;Weng, Chengyu. ''Response of pollen diversity to the climate-driven altitudinal shift of vegetation in the Colombian Andes.'' Philosophical Transactions: Biological Sciences; 2007, Vol. 362 Issue 1478, p253-262.&lt;/ref&gt; With these findings, they were able to see changes in plant diversity in the past 430000 years. During hot temperatures, pollen diversity increased at higher altitudes, from plant species moving up. Cooler temperatures saw pollen diversity in lower altitudes. The study explains how temperature influences plant diversity.

===Ecoregions===
The ecoregions in the hotspot include:

* [[Cordillera de la Costa montane forests]] (Venezuela)
* [[Venezuelan Andes montane forests]] (Venezuela)
* [[Cordillera Oriental montane forests]] (Colombia, Venezuela)
* [[Santa Marta páramo]] (Colombia)
* [[Santa Marta montane forests]] (Colombia)

== Hotspots ==

A [[Biodiversity hotspot|hotspot]] can be identified as an area with great biological diversity with high endemism. The location must also have lost a significant amount of land and threatened species, according to the fourth edition of the ''Essentials of Conservation Biology''. The term "hotspots" was used by [[Norman Myers]] written to describe ten tropical forests. The forests contained the characteristics of high levels of plant endemism and loss of habitats. Myers went on to add eight more hotspots by 1990. The Conservation International reassessed Myers definition of a hotspot and by 1999 criteria for a hotspot developed to be used globally. A hotspot needs 1,500 endemic vascular plant species and a loss of at least 70 percent of its original land.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biodiversityhotspots.org/xp/Hotspots/andes/Pages/default.aspx Conservation International. Biodiversity Hotspots Tropical Andes. Conservation International. Accessed 10/25/07.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071210215349/http://www.biodiversityhotspots.org/xp/Hotspots/andes/Pages/default.aspx |date=2007-12-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biodiversityhotspots.org/xp/Hotspots/hotspotsScience/pages/hotspots_defined.aspx Conservation International. Hotspots Science. Conservation International.

Tropical Andes. 2007. Conservation International. Accessed 10/25/07.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080123122123/http://www.cepf.net/xp/cepf/where_we_work/tropical_andes/tropical_andes_info.xml |date=2008-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With these criteria, 25 hotspots were identified in 1999 and published in the journal ''Nature''.  They contained at least 44 percent of earth's endemics plants and 35 percent of land vertebrates. The combined area between the 25 hotspots used to cover 11.8 percent of land. The total amount of land has reduced from 17 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to 2 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, or about 85% of the land. This leaves this great biodiversity limited to about 1 percent of Earth's land surface.&lt;ref&gt;Primack&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source needed|date=May 2018}}

== Research ==

There are a little over 30 hotspots now recorded and used for research. A few other hotspots include the [[Caribbean Islands]], [[Himalaya]], and [[Japan]]. Due to a hotspot's great diversity and endemic species, [[conservation biology]] and many other sources conduct research in these locations. Research is also needed considering the amount of threatened species in hotspots. Researchers have the opportunity to preserve many species along with their habitats within hotspots. Some organizations that use hotspots for research are World Conservation Monitoring Centre, Birdlife International, Conservation International, and World Wildlife Fund. Research is also done on humans' impact to the hotspots land and species that reside in them. Funding for hotspot conservation has been estimated at $750 million accumulated over the past fifteen years.{{when|date=May 2018}} By focusing research on hotspots, many species can be helped at once.
	
One specific research studies fire's impact on vegetation in Northern Ecuador of the Tropical Andes. This location's variety of vegetation includes different forests, land used for agricultural and páramo, or tropical alpine found at 4,500 meters. Páramo is dominated by grasses but still high in diversity. The article "Fire Ecology and Conservation in the High Tropical Andes: Observations from Northern Ecuador" looks at páramo's ability to withstand disturbances such as fire. Humans have lived in this location for 7,000 years, and the páramo has been through fires and grazing. The writer believes that policies used to implement fire suppression are not probable or beneficiary to the plant.&lt;ref name="Keating"&gt;Keating, Philip. ''Fire Ecology and Conservation in the High Tropical Andes: observations from Northern Ecuador''. Journal of Latin American Geography; 2007, Vol. 6 Issue 1, p43-62.&lt;/ref&gt; Policies instead should be written up according to specific plant species and impact on natives living there. This is a small example of research in the Tropical Andes that could make a big impact to saving diversity.
	
Further research is also processed on looking into the decrease in avian populations, focusing in hotspots due to its massive diversity. The study focuses in Endemic Bird Areas or EBAs in order to understand why they become extinct and possible conservation plans. {{As of|2003}} there were 218 EBAs, with over 30 percent of bird species threatened. EBAs located in hotspots interfere with many human activities, leading to habitat loss in 51 percent of EBAs. According to the article's chart, five EBAs with habitat loss are located in the Tropical Andes. By studying the effect of human activities on EBAs that are losing avian populations, plans to help the future of other EBAs are possible. Their results showed that if a species has habitat specificity and is large in size, the chance of extinction increases. Habitat loss will impact those with habitat specificity greatly. [[Conservation ethic|Conservation]] goals need to look into human activities and the bird's habitat specificity in order to make a positive impact.
	
An example of research on a specific threatened species in the Tropical Andes is the rare ''[[Tremarctos ornatus]]'', also known as Andean (or spectacled) [[Andean bear|bears]]. Two males were captured, and radio collars were attached in order to track and study their habits and movement. They portrayed similar patterns compared to many other bear species. These findings contrasted with the belief of spectacled bears being nocturnal and no change in patterns between seasons because only slight change in temperature. The radio collars proved these spectacled bears to be diurnal. The bears were in motion from sunrise to sunset with periods of rest in between. There was a small change in level of activity between seasons, with an increase during the dry season. Due to the technology of radio collars, hypotheses about these bears were tested. By knowing their habitat and lifestyle, we can better understand and help threatened species.

== Rich diversity ==

The Tropical Andes is said to be the most diverse of the world's scientific hotspots of diversity. The journal ''Nature'' contained an article by Norman Myers comparing the 25 hotspots with land and species in 2000. At the time, the Tropical Andes was recorded to have 45,000 plant species with the next closest hotspots recorded to have 25,000 plant species. Actually a sixth of all plant species can reside in the Tropical Andes. The Tropical Andes also has the most endemic plant species at 20,000, while the next hotspot contains 15,000. The Tropical Andes has a lot of land compared to other hotspots, but is not the largest. that The large land area shows the Tropical Andes can provide for biodiversity with diverse landscape.
	
Many endemic plant and animal species are currently threatened in the Tropical Andes. An example of a threatened plant species is the [[Andean bromelilad]], an endemic plant that takes up to 100 years to mature and a common diet for species that forage. Other plants species include many crops such as tobacco and potatoes. Some endemic animals include the [[Andean condor]], which almost became extinct from hunting. Thanks to a conservation reintroduction program, their numbers are growing. Another threatened endemic bird in the Tropical Andes is the [[yellow-eared parrot]]. One threat this species faces is the loss of the vulnerable wax palm. The yellow-eared parrot uses the wax palm for nesting and roosting. However, humans, especially in Colombia, are removing the vulnerable wax palm from the wild for [[Palm Sunday]]. Some conservation programs are helping the situation to educate churches to use other resources besides the vulnerable wax palm. The [[yellow tailed monkey]] is another endemic animal being endangered. They are one of the rarest mammals, with a recorded population of 250 found in the cloud forests of Peru. They are threatened by humans causing habitat loss and fragmentation of their habitat. Their slow maturity and low population densities do not help. Programs have tried to relocate them to secondary forests, but attempts have failed. Many species reside in the Tropical Andes but are threatened severely.

== Threats ==

There are many threats that the Tropical Andes faces every day. One of the main threats is human activities, especially with increasing population. Some activities include mining, logging, and construction. Humans also use land for agriculture and keep relocating once the land is used up. Valleys are severely degraded due to humans living there. Hydroelectric dams have also been put in the Tropical Andes and negatively pressured cloud forests. The 25 percent of land that is protected is still poorly managed with little help from the public from lack of education. Invasive species have also been a threat to the Tropical Andes' land and species, possibly brought in by humans. Invasive species include the [[American bullfrog]] and certain grasses used for cattle.
	
Humans have the ability to cause habitat loss and [[habitat fragmentation]] for species. The forest habitats that are threatened in the Tropical Andes are modified and destroyed 30 percent faster than lower tropical areas.&lt;ref name="Cuervo"&gt;Cuervo, Andrés. ''PersistentAssemblage and population-level consequences of forest fragmentation on bilateral asymmetry in tropical montane birds''. Biological Journal of the Linnean Society; 2007, Vol. 92 	Issue 	1, p119-133&lt;/ref&gt; Fragmentation causes a separation within species and decreases the diversity of genes. There is the possibility of inbreeding to increase as well. An article also looked at fragmentation causing certain phenotypes to arise in organisms. By studying feathers of 2,500 individual bird species within nine forests, observation showed asymmetry linked with fragmentation. Asymmetry was lowest if the forest continued and highest with small or medium fragmentation.&lt;ref name="Cuervo"/&gt; They suggest asymmetry of bird feathers influenced by the stress of fragmentation and changing environments. That is one outcome from fragmentation in the Tropical Andes.
	
A study by Niall O'Dea looks at bird communities in general and how habitat degradation impacts them. He compared the bird communities that reside in primary forests, secondary forests, edge habitat and agricultural land, all modified by humans. Most diversity was found in secondary forests and edge habitats but different species. The agricultural land and primary forest held the lowest diversity.&lt;ref&gt;O'Dea, Niall. ''How well do Important Bird Areas represent species and minimize conservation conflict in the tropical Andes?'' Diversity &amp; Distributions; 2006, Vol. 12 Issue 2, p205-214.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Dea, Niall, ''How resilient are Andean montane forest bird communities to habitat degradation?'' Biodiversity-and-Conservation. 2007. Vol.16 Issue 4. p.&amp;nbsp;1131-1159&lt;/ref&gt; This study suggests that within Andean montane forests, preserving secondary forests offers most benefit for these threatened birds.
	
Another serious threat to the Tropical Andes is [[global warming]], the effect of too much of [[greenhouse gasses]] trapped in the air that hold in heat. Some locations are increasing in temperature and others decreasing. The change in temperatures has a major effect on the Tropical Andes; some say{{who|date=May 2018}} that this is more negative than deforestation. One serious issue is the melting of the [[glaciers]] in the mountains. It is estimated that 80 percent of freshwater comes from mountains and with them melting about half of the Earth's population will be affected.&lt;ref name="Mark"&gt;Mark, Bryan, ''Tracing Increasing Tropical Andean Glacier Melt with Stable Isotopes in Water.'' Environmental Science &amp; Technology; 2007, Vol. 41 Issue 20, p6955-6960&lt;/ref&gt; All over the world glaciers are melting, but the mountains in the Tropical Andes are very susceptible. It is said that a quarter of the Tropical Andes glacier has already begun retreating. These glaciers make up many species water supply, and the location could be in crisis if they melt away. Glaciers in the Andes provide two main functions; decrease seasonal discharge variability and provide greater specific discharge.&lt;ref name="Mark"/&gt; The article by Bryan Mark predicts an increase in discharge as glaciers melt, with the ability to trace glacier water melting into watersheds using isotopes.&lt;ref name="Mark"/&gt; Global warming can lead to the extinction of many species, especially in hotspots. A study done by Jay Malcolm predicts that less than 1 percent up to 43 percent of endemic biota will become extinct due to global warming. He also believes the Tropical Andes is in the top six vulnerable hotspots, with the possibility of plant extinction exceeding 2000 species.&lt;ref name="Malcolm"&gt;Malcolm, Jay. ''Global Warming and Extinctions of Endemic Species from Biodiversity Hotspots.'' Conservation Biology; 2006, Vol. 20 Issue 2, p538-548.&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Global warming is also causing an increase in diseases among amphibians. Considering that the Tropical Andes is recorded to have the most amphibians, some restricted to this location, diseases could decrease the diversity greatly. Another factor is that 400 of the amphibian species are already threatened. These deadly fungi have actually been linked to the extinction of dinosaurs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17166620/ Associated Press. 'Amphibian Ark' aims to save frogs from fungus. MSNBC website. 2007. Accessed 12/8/07.]&lt;/ref&gt; One chytrid fungus that is infecting amphibians is the [[batrachochytrium dendrobatidis]]. This fungus will impair the amphibian's skin and reduce its ability to absorb. One example of an amphibian in the Tropical Andes is the genus ''[[Atelopus]]'', with 56 of the species Critically Endangered. Due to increase in temperature, the fungus has the ability to spread rapidly and thrive on living amphibians.
	
A new threat that is being researched is the effect from [[nitrogen deposition]]. Studies done in Europe have shown diversity among plants decreased due to nitrogen deposition. Current models are estimating what could happen to hotspots across the world if nitrogen deposition keeps increasing. By comparing to past research, nitrogen deposition has already increased 50 percent since the 1990s. The estimation for the future shows an increase by 100 percent in 2050. Considering the great plant diversity in the Tropical Andes, especially so many endemics, nitrogen deposition could be a severe threat. The decrease in plant diversity could cause a chain reaction on other species that depend on the plants.
	
These are just few threats the Tropical Andes faces on a daily basis. The impact on the land is shown by a 75 percent decrease from its original mass. Species affected are decreasing in numbers, and the number of species listed on the Endangered Species Act is increasing. The situation is worse when threatened species are endemic to the Tropical Andes. 14 endemic mammals and 110 endemic birds are threatened in the Tropical Andes. Two species from the Tropical Andes have already become extinct.

'''Tunstall Hills''' is an area of [[Urban open space|open space]] in [[City of Sunderland|Sunderland]], [[Tyne and Wear]], [[England]]. It is a [[Local Nature Reserve]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.lnr.naturalengland.org.uk/special/lnr/lnr_details.asp?C=0&amp;N=TUNSTALL&amp;ID=982|title= Tunstall Hills|series=Local Nature Reserves|publisher=Natural England|accessdate=26 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://magic.defra.gov.uk/MagicMap.aspx?startTopic=Designations&amp;activelayer=lnrIndex&amp;query=REF_CODE%3D%271082958%27 |title=Map of Tunstall Hills|series=Local Nature Reserves|publisher=Natural England|accessdate=26 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Tunstall Hills And Ryhope Cutting'' has been designated a [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]] both for its geological and biological importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1001148.pdf|title=Tunstall Hills And Ryhope Cutting citation|series= Sites of Special Scientific Interest|publisher=Natural England|accessdate=26 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://magic.defra.gov.uk/MagicMap.aspx?startTopic=Designations&amp;activelayer=sssiIndex&amp;query=HYPERLINK%3D%271001148%27|title=Map of Tunstall Hills And Ryhope Cutting |series= Sites of Special Scientific Interest|publisher=Natural England|accessdate=26 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area consists of Green Hill and Rocky Hill and surrounding land.

Historically these hills have been also named the Maidens [[breast#The breast as an anthropomorphic geographic feature|Paps]] because of their shape.&lt;ref&gt;[http://williammartinpoet.com/page53.htm Tunstall Hills - the Goddess in the landscape]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flora==

Gentle slopes on the Maiden Paps support species-rich Magnesian Limestone grassland dominated by upright brome Bromus erectus, blue moor-grass Sesleria albicans, crested hair-grass Koeleria macrantha, red fescue Festuca rubra, glaucous sedge Carex flacca and herbs such as common rock-rose Helianthemum nummularia, salad burnet Sanguisorba minor, fairy flax Linum catharticum, wild thyme Thymus praecox, pignut Conopodium majus, small scabious Scabiosa columbaria and sea plantain Plantago maritima. Of particular note is a small population of perennial flax Linum anglicum, which occurs here towards the northern limit of its distribution range in Great Britain, and locally uncommon plants such as frog orchid Coeloglossum viride, autumn gentian Gentianella amarella, purple milk-vetch Astragalus danicus and thrift Armeria maritima. Steep south-facing slopes above the reclaimed railway line support a more open, herb-rich grassland characterised by common quaking-grass Briza media, blue moorgrass, crested hair-grass and red fescue with yarrow Achillea millefolium, hairy violet Viola hirta, hoary ragwort Senecio erucifolius, and fragrant orchid Gymnadenia conopsea. Other uncommon plants include pale St. John’s-wort Hypericum montanum, lesser meadow-rue Thalictrum minus, and black bryony Tamus communis.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1001148.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Wayfinder was a wholly owned subsidiary of [[Vodafone]]&lt;ref name="vf_buy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wayfinder.com/?id=11170&amp;lang=en-US|title=wayfinder|work=GitHub}}&lt;/ref&gt; specializing in creating mobile navigation systems for a number of platforms such as [[Symbian]] 2nd and 3rd edition, UIQ, [[Windows Mobile]] and some other [[smartphones]]. An external [[Bluetooth]] [[GPS]] receiver is required for non GPS enabled phones. On March 12, 2010 it was announced that Vodafone is closing the company and all employees will be let go.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sydsvenskan.se/ekonomi/article637272/Vodafone-lagger-ner-Wayfinder.html|title=Vodafone lägger ner Wayfinder|work=Sydsvenskan|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100313150141/http://sydsvenskan.se/ekonomi/article637272/Vodafone-lagger-ner-Wayfinder.html|archivedate=2010-03-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 13, 2010 Wayfinder announced&lt;ref name="oss_wf1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oss.wayfinder.com/2010/07/13/welcome-to-vodafone-wayfinder-oss/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100717151917/http://oss.wayfinder.com/2010/07/13/welcome-to-vodafone-wayfinder-oss/ |archivedate=2010-07-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; that they would open source their software under the [[BSD license#3-clause license .28.22New BSD License.22.29|BSD 3-clause license]].&lt;ref name="oss_license"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oss.wayfinder.com/wiki/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704101347/http://oss.wayfinder.com/wiki/ |archivedate=2010-07-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vodafone.com/start/media_relations/news/group_press_releases/2010/open_source_wayfinder.html&lt;/ref&gt; Source code for both the server (with import tools for map data from [[OpenStreetMap]]) and client software for various phone operating systems (including [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[iPhone]] and [[S60 (software platform)|Symbian S60]]) is available at [[GitHub]].

== Wayfinder Navigator ==

Wayfinder Navigator is a mobile GPS application that provides [[Turn-by-turn navigation|turn-by-turn directions]] through a mobile phone. By downloading pre-loaded maps, Navigator can provide directions and different points of interest without Internet connection.&lt;ref name="Runner's Web"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.runnersweb.com/running/news_2008/rw_news_20080506_Wayfinder_Navigator.html|title=Multisport: State of the art mobile navigation – Wayfinder launches improved version of Wayfinder Navigator |publisher=Runner's Web}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2008, Wayfinder Navigator was updated to include pre-loaded maps, [[social networking]] and map coverage of 150 countries world-wide.&lt;ref name="Thinking Aloud"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thinkingaloud.in/2008/05/13/dont-lose-your-way-wayfinder-navigator/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518211955/http://www.thinkingaloud.in/2008/05/13/dont-lose-your-way-wayfinder-navigator/ |archivedate=2008-05-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wayfinder Earth ==

Wayfinder Earth is a mobile application that displays a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] globe. The application contains over 3 million [[Points of Interest]] (POIs) including restaurants, train stations, bars, museums, gas stations and hospitals. Another international application, map coverage includes [[Europe]] and [[North America]]. Wayfinder Earth can set favorites, save address searches and show GPS information such as speed, position and heading as well.&lt;ref name="Avec Mobile"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avecmobile.com/index.php?id=799|title=Ebooks:  Non-fiction books about history, technology, economy, marketing, business, and hobbies - Klaava|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the maps are downloaded from the internet on the fly so the phone requires a [[GPRS]]/[[UMTS]] connection. Maps are cached on the phone memory or memorycard. According to the site, maps can even be downloaded from the site and stored on the phone, once you have registered.
A half an hour of navigating uses approximately 200 kb of data or only 8 kb in the so-called Guide view.

==Wayfinder Active==

Wayfinder Active was a mobile phone [[GPS]] application to track physical outdoor activities. The application calculated exercise statistics such as distance, calories burned and altitude info, so that people could set and track specific exercise goals.&lt;ref name="CNET"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-12261_7-9911445-51.html|title=Wayfinder Active is a way cool GPS app|work=CNET}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through an online community, activeoutdoor.com, people could track and share local routes within the community. The product was discontinued spring 2009.

== Speed cameras ==

Wayfinder launched the Wayfinder SpeedAlert application in December 2006. The application runs on Java and Symbian 3rd edition only. It warns the user of 15,000 speed cameras around Europe as well as when they exceeded a manually set speed limit.
