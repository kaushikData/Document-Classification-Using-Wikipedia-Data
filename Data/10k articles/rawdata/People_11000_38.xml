'''Anne McDonald''' (11 January 1961 – 22 October 2010) was an [[Australia]]n person with [[cerebral palsy]] who has been credited as an author and an activist for the rights of people with communication disability. 

McDonald was born on 11 January 1961 in Seymour, Victoria, a small Australian town. As a result of a birth injury, she developed severe athetoid cerebral palsy. Because she could not walk, talk or feed herself, she was diagnosed as having severe [[intellectual disability]]. At the age of three, she was placed by her parents in St. Nicholas Hospital, [[Melbourne]], a Health Commission (government) institution for children with severe disabilities, and she lived there without education or therapy for eleven years. It has been claimed that, during McDonald's time in the hospital, she was neglected and starved and at age 16 she weighed only 12 kilograms.&lt;ref&gt;Rosemary Crossley, "Speechless: Facilitating Communication for People Without Voices", Dutton Adult (1997), {{ISBN|0-525-94156-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Despite her ill-treatment, McDonald was purported to have considered herself "a lucky one" in that she was able to be released, and to have estimated that 163 of her friends died in the institution while she was there.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Carman, Gerry [http://www.smh.com.au/national/obituaries/persistence-and-passion-speak-loudest-20101031-178v0.html "Persistence and passion speak loudest" (obituary)]. ''The Sydney Morning Herald'', 1 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, when McDonald was 16, [[Rosemary Crossley]] reported that she was able to communicate with her by supporting her upper arm while she selected word blocks and magnetic letters. Crossley continued using similar strategies with McDonald and other individuals with disabilities, developing what has become known as [[facilitated communication]] training. Scientific studies have since demonstrated that facilitated communication is not actually effective, and that the resulting messages are essentially written by the facilitators themselves, often unconsciously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Green |first=Gina |date=1994 |title=Facilitated communication: Mental miracle or sleight of hand? |url=http://www.skeptic.com/02.3.green-fc.html |journal=Skeptic |volume=2 |pages=68-76 |via= |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021217224216/http://www.skeptic.com/02.3.green-fc.html |archivedate=17 December 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Why debunked autism treatment fads persist"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/02/150226154644.htm|title=Why debunked autism treatment fads persist|website=Science Daily|publisher=Emory University|display-authors=etal|last1=Lilienfeld|accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailyorange.com/2016/04/syracuse-universitys-reinforcement-of-facilitated-communication-inexcusable-concerning/|title=Syracuse University's reinforcement of facilitated communication inexcusable, concerning|first=|date=|website=The Daily Orange|publisher=Syracuse University|last1=Editorial Board|accessdate=13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Todd, James (2012)"&gt;{{cite journal|date=13 July 2012|title=The moral obligation to be empirical: Comments on Boynton's 'Facilitated Communication - what harm it can do: Confessions of a former facilitator'|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17489539.2012.704738|journal=Evidence-Based Communication Assessment and Intervention|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis Group|volume=6|issue=1|pages=36–57|doi=10.1080/17489539.2012.704738|via=|last1=Todd|first1=James T.|accessdate=March 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hall|first=Genae A.|date=1993|title=Facilitator Control as Automatic Behavior: A Verbal Behavior Analysis|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2748555/pdf/anverbbehav00034-0091.pdf|journal=The Analysis of Verbal Behavior|volume=11|pages=89–97|via=|doi=10.1007/bf03392890|pmc=2748555|pmid=22477083}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jacobson, Mulick, Schwartz (1995)"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Mulick|first2=James A.|last3=Schwartz|first3=Allen A.|date=September 1995|title=A History of Facilitated Communication: Science, Pseudoscience, and Antiscience: Science Working Group on Facilitated Communication|journal=American Psychologist|publisher=American Psychological Association,Inc.|volume=50|issue=9|pages=750–765|doi=10.1037/0003-066x.50.9.750|last1=Jacobson|first1=John W.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="APA2"&gt;[http://www.apa.org/research/action/facilitated.aspx ''Facilitated Communication: Sifting the Psychological Wheat from the Chaff''.] American Psychological Association.

Through Crossley, McDonald appeared to seek discharge from St. Nicholas. Her parents and the hospital authorities denied her request on the grounds that the reality of her communication had not been established. In 1979, when McDonald turned eighteen, she commenced a [[habeas corpus]] action in the [[Supreme Court of Victoria]] against the Health Commission in order to win the right to leave the institution.&lt;ref&gt;David J. Clark, Gerard McCoy, "Habeas corpus: Australia, New Zealand, the South Pacific", pp. 120, Federation Press, Sydney (2000), {{ISBN|1-86287-302-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Susan Hayes and Robert Hayes, "Simply Criminal", pp. 51, The Law Book Company Limited, Sydney (1984), {{ISBN|0-455-20279-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court accepted that McDonald's communication was her own and allowed her to leave the hospital and live with Crossley. 

After leaving the institution, McDonald got her [[Higher School Certificate (Victoria)|Higher School Certificate]] (University entrance) qualification at night school and went on to take a humanities degree at [[Deakin University]], completed in 1993. An editorial in the Melbourne Herald-Sun said at the time: "If walking on the moon was a giant leap for mankind as well as a small step for one man, then Anne McDonald's graduation from university yesterday was a major lessor for society as much as it was the fulfilment of a personal dream".&lt;ref&gt;Editorial, Sunday Herald Sun, May 29, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; She was credited as an authored of a number of articles and papers on disability, presented at international conferences, and as being active in the disability rights movement, with special emphasis on the right to communicate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.vicnet.net.au/~dealcc/Anne2.htm Alternate home website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615172129/http://home.vicnet.net.au/~dealcc/Anne2.htm|date=15 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://severedisabilitykid.blogspot.com/2009/10/anne-mcdonald-growth-attenuation-been.html Intelligence goes beyond motor skill]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Facebook page [www.facebook.com/pages/Anne-McDonald/133281970040595]&lt;/ref&gt;

McDonald was credited as a co-author, with Crossley, of the book ''Annie's Coming Out'' (1980), which tells their story. The film ''[[Annie's Coming Out]]'', based on the book, won several [[Australian Film Institute]] awards (including Best Picture) and was released in the US under the title ''Test of Love''. It won the inaugural Allen Lane Award for the best book of the year dealing with disability. Some questioned whether McDonald had the capacity write a book, and she had to demonstrate her abilities in the Supreme Court to win the right to manage her own financial affairs and enter into a contract with Penguin Books.&lt;ref&gt;Rosemary Crossley, "Speechless: Facilitating Communication for People Without Voices", Dutton Adult (1997), {{ISBN|0-525-94156-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.vicnet.net.au/~dealcc/DwyerB.htm ACCESS TO JUSTICE FOR PEOPLE WITH SEVERE COMMUNICATION IMPAIRMENT] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124070333/http://home.vicnet.net.au/~dealcc/DwyerB.htm|date=24 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the [[International Day of Persons with Disabilities]], 3 December 2008, McDonald received the Personal Achievement Award in the Australian National Disability Awards at Parliament House. Her presentation on that occasion said:&lt;blockquote&gt;The worst thing about being an inspiration is that you have to be perfect. I am a normal person with only normal courage. Some people who should know better have tried to give me a halo. Anybody could have done what I have done if they too had been taken out of hell as I was. If you let other people without speech be helped as I was helped they will say more than I can say. They will tell you that the humanity we share is not dependent on speech. They will tell you that the power of literacy lies within us all. They will tell you that I am not an exception, only a bad example.&lt;/blockquote&gt;McDonald died of a heart attack on 22 October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/annie-has-gone-but-her-legacy-and-fighting-spirit-live-on-20101029-177h2.html "annie-has-gone-but-her-legacy-and-fighting-spirit-live-on"]. ''[[The Age]]''&lt;/ref&gt; She received a posthumous award from the Australian Group on Severe Communication Impairment (AGOSCI). The citation read:&lt;blockquote&gt;Anne's dedicated advocacy and activism for the human rights of people with disabilities and especially those using alternative and augmentative communication (AAC) was as inspirational as her own achievement. As author and presenter she worked tirelessly to raise the profile of people with communication disabilities. Her outstanding achievements are acknowledged and sincerely appreciated by AGOSCI.&lt;ref&gt;Sue Owen, Chairperson, Agosci, 14 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Controversy ==
The story of McDonald's use of facilitated communication has been questioned many times, with sceptics pointing to input from the assistant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = More Doubts over Disability ‘Miracle’ {{!}} Disability Advocacy Resource Unit (DARU)|url = http://www.daru.org.au/resource/more-doubts-over-disability-miracle|website = www.daru.org.au|access-date = 2016-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://u.b5z.net/i/u/10196230/f/LISA_Rosemarys_Baby.pdf |title=Rosemary's Baby |last=Rule |first=Andrew |date=May 14, 2012 |work= |access-date=Jan 16, 2016 |via= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160405210726/http://u.b5z.net/i/u/10196230/f/LISA_Rosemarys_Baby.pdf |archivedate=5 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologists and policy makers have argued facilitated communication is, at best, ineffective wishful thinking, and at worst, actively harmful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Facilitated Communication Is a Cult That Won’t Die|url = http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/medical_examiner/2015/11/facilitated_communication_pseudoscience_harms_people_with_disabilities.html|newspaper = Slate|date = 2015-11-12|access-date = 2016-01-16|issn = 1091-2339|language = en-US|first = David|last = [[David Auerbach|Auerbach]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = FRONTLINE: previous reports: transcripts: prisoners of silence {{!}} PBS|url = https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/programs/transcripts/1202.html|website = www.pbs.org|access-date = 2016-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Research Report 77: Educational Interventions for Children With Autism: A Literature Review of Recent And Current Research|last = Jordan|first = Rita|publisher = Department for Education and Employment|year = 1998|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Antonio Anglés Martins''' (born 25 July 1966 in [[São Paulo]], [[Brazil]]) is a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Crime|criminal]] and fugitive. He lived in his birth country for a year before moving to [[Spain]]. According to his relatives and friends, Anglés was known as a habitually violent [[criminal]] who frequently beat up his mother. With criminal records for [[wikt:mugging|mugging]], [[robbery]] and [[drug trafficking]], he is best known for his triple offense, "[[The Alcasser Girls|Crime of Alcácer]]", committed in  [[Alcácer]], a town in the [[Valencia]]n region, in which [[Desirée Hernández Folch|Desirée Hernández]], [[Miriam García Iborra|Miriam García]], and [[Antonia Gómez Rodríguez|Antonia Gómez]] were allegedly [[Kidnapping|kidnapped]], [[torture]]d, [[rape]]d and [[Murder|killed]] by Anglés.

== Life ==
Some raised doubts about the July 25, 1966 date of Anglés Martins' birth at São Paulo because the reports of the Spanish Civil Guards and the Police show different dates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://elcrimendealcasser.wordpress.com/antonio-angles-martins/|title=Antonio Anglés Martins|date=2014-12-04|work=El crimen de Alcàsser|access-date=2018-06-05|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from this discrepancy, however, his early life has been documented. His parents were Enrique Anglés and Neusa Martins, who were married in February 1959. The couple had nine children and Anglés Martins was the fourth. By 1958, the family transferred to Spain where they resided in Valencia town called Catarroja. Sources show that Anglés Martins started living on his own in 1991 when he moved to number 101 Camí Real Street.

He spent two years in [[prison]] for kidnapping, chaining and hitting 20-year-old [[Nuria Pera Mateu]] in January 1990, apparently for stealing some grams of [[heroin]] from him. The woman's life was saved thanks to the intervention of one of Anglés’ brothers. Given a chance for social reintegration, he received penitentiary leave of six days in 1992, and he took advantage of it to escape, with the result that he didn't finish his sentence and he was from that point on arrest warrant.

== The Alcácer crime ==
'''Reconstruction of events'''

On the night of November 13, 1992 Antonio Anglés, well known as ''Asukiki'' or "Sugar", went for a drive in the [[Opel Corsa]] of his friend [[Miguel Ricart Tárrega]] ([[Catarroja]], 1969) who was with him. While they were driving along the road they saw three girls who were [[hitchhiking]] to a party which the Picasent High School was holding in the nightclub ''Coolor''. Anglés asked them if they were going to the nightclub ''Coolor'' and so the three girls got into the car.
 
When they arrived at the nightclub ''Coolor'', Anglés told Ricart to continue driving. The girls started screaming. Right after, Anglés pulled out a [[9 mm]] short caliber ''[[Star Bonifacio Echeverria|Star]]'' gun. He hit them with the butt of the gun and then he tied them up. ''El Rubio'', as people called Ricart, drove the car to [[Catadau]]. This was the area where Anglés used to hide when the [[Guardia Civil]] were looking for him. He suggested the half fallen hut&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.elespanol.com/reportajes/grandes-historias/20171112/261474386_0.html|title=El caserón de Alcàsser 25 años después: aquí asesinaron a las niñas|last=López Frías|first=David|date=November 2017|website=El Español|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of ''La Romana'' as a place to take the girls. Two of the girls were raped by both Anglés and Ricart. Later, they decided to tie them up and return to the town to look for food. When they came back, they raped the third girl and then they dug a pit and obliged them to go there, where they shot and buried them. They picked up the cartridges of the gun and cleaned the car.

'''Ensuing days'''

An intense search to find the girls began. On January 27, 1993, after heavy rains, the soil softened and the bodies appeared. Two [[beekeepers]] who were taking care of their beehives ([[Gabriel Aquino]] and [[José Sala Sala]], 69 and 53 years old respectively) came across the pit. In the investigation, the [[Guardia Civil]] found one of Ricart's gloves, a [[social security]] slip in the name of [[Enrique Anglés Martins]], Antonio's brother, and a gun cartridge in the pit.

Anglés was not in his house when the ''Guardia Civil'' went there looking for his brother Enrique. He escaped and hid for a month in a Valencian town, harassed by the Guardia Civil and the [[police]]. He was almost captured in {{Interlanguage link multi|Villamarchante|es}}, but he managed to escape the extensive police cordon which had been set up. He appeared again in [[Minglanilla, Cuenca|Minglanilla]] ([[Cuenca, Spain|Cuenca]]) some days later, the last place in [[Spain]] where he was seen before being subsequently spotted in [[Lisbon]] in March 1993. From this point on, there are two theories: The first says that he boarded the [[boat]] ''[[City of Plymouth]]'' as a stowaway, before jumping overboard on being discovered near the coast of [[Ireland]]. Thereafter, his trail was lost, and he is believed to have died from cold or drowning in those waters. The second theory simply assumes that in Lisbon he boarded a ship for [[Brazil]], his native country, and he managed to get there and enter the country with his Brazilian passport, since he had dual nationality (Spanish and Brazilian), but the reality is that until the present day nothing is known about his whereabouts.

After 21 years in prison, Ricart was released on November 29, 2013 and was reported to have given a series of interviews in which he still maintained his innocence, alleging a conspiracy that pinned him as scapegoat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lasprovincias.es/sucesos/201512/10/miguel-ricart-anos-anonimato-20151210121807.html|title=Miguel Ricart, dos años en el anonimato|date=2015-12-10|work=Las Provincias|access-date=2018-06-05|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he did not return to prison, and still remains at large. According to Interpol's records, Antonio Anglés Martins is still included in its most wanted criminals list. He is described in its database as 1.75 meters tall and has blue eyes. He is charged with kidnapping, rape, murder, unlawful burial, and illegal possession of weapons.

In 2015, Dickins became a Writer-in-Residence and Creative Writing lecturer at [[Victoria University, Australia|Victoria University]] in [[Footscray, Victoria|Footscray]], [[Melbourne]]. He held the position for less than 12 months, before being unexpectedly let go by the campus coordinators during the Christmas break.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In June 2017 Dickins was found guilty of making a false police report after claiming officers had conducted an improper strip search upon him. The Magistrate remarked of Dickins' report "for reasons which I truly cannot fathom, Mr Dickins invented a set of facts, which were not true and, in my view, he knew them not to be true". For this Dickins was placed on a 12-month good behaviour bond with no conviction recorded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/writer-found-guilty-of-making-false-report-to-victoria-police-20170602-gwj0rk.html|title=Writer found guilty of making false report to Victoria Police|date=2017-06-04|work=The Age|access-date=2017-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; His then employer, [[The Sunday Age]], was later found to have breached [[Australian Press Council]] principles in lieu of their publication of Dickens' account of the alleged police misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/australian-press-council-complaint-from-victoria-police-upheld-20171102-gze1ff.html|title=Australian Press Council: complaint from Victoria Police upheld|date=2017-11-04|work=The Age|access-date=2017-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christopher Fratin''' (1 January 1801 – 16 August 1864), also known as '''Christophe Fratin''', was a noted French sculptor in the [[animalier]] style, and one of the earliest French sculptors to portray animals in bronze.&lt;ref name=Kjellberg&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kjellberg|first1=Pierre|title=Bronzes of the 19th Century|date=1994|publisher=Schiffer Publishing, Ltd.|location=Atglen, Pennsylvania|isbn=0-88740-629-7|pages=495}}&lt;!--|accessdate=11 June 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Fratin was born in [[Metz]], [[Moselle (department)|Moselle]], [[France]] the son of a [[taxidermist]]. He first studied drawing under Pioche in Metz and later worked in [[Paris]] at the studio of [[Théodore Géricault]].&lt;ref name=Kjellberg /&gt;

==Work==
[[File:Eagle and Prey by Christophe Fratin, Central Park, New York City.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Eagles and Prey by Fratin, Central Park, New York City]]
He exhibited at the [[Paris Salon]] from 1831–1842 and 1850–1862, as well as at the [[Great Exhibition]] in London in 1851. Fratin never signed his bronzes but instead used a stamp showing his last name in straight block letters. One of the stamps he used (''pictured'') showed the "n" reversed, not by design but due to an error on the part of the maker of the stamp. Bronzes bearing this stamp have the appearance of not seeming to be genuine when in reality they are.&lt;ref name=Kjellberg /&gt;

Fratin received monumental commissions in France and elsewhere, including the ''Deux Aigles Gardant Leur Proie'' (''Eagles and Prey'', created 1850) displayed since 1863 in New York City's [[Central Park]]. Many of his small bronzes—including his miniature bronzes which were more affordable due to their smaller size—were sold commercially to the general public during his lifetime. Today, Fratin's sculpture is on permanent display in the [[Louvre]], the city museums of [[Metz]], [[Lyon]], [[Strasbourg]], [[Nîmes]] and at the [[Peabody Institute]] in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]]. The [[Georg Eisler]] archive in [[Vienna]] also has on display works by Fratin.

A number of Fratin's pieces portray horses, especially portraits of famous horses such as ''Fermer, cheval anglais pur-sang'', a wax of which he debuted at the Salon of 1831, the same exhibition in which [[Antoine-Louis Barye|Barye]]'s ''Tigre dévorant un gavial'' was featured.&lt;ref name=Kjellberg /&gt;

At [[Montrouge]] Square in Paris appears a colossal bronze group standing 2 meters high entitled ''Cheval attaqué par un lion'', executed in 1852. Fratin received many commissions from the State including groups designed for the botanical garden and the [[esplanade]] of his hometown; amongst the groups were two dogs, a deer at bay, a purebred horse, and some eagles. He also produced a number of whimsical bear sculptures, one being ''Ours jouant de la cornemuse'' which shows a bear holding a musical instrument.&lt;ref name=Kjellberg /&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Fratin died on 17 August 1864 at [[Le Raincy]] ([[Seine-Saint-Denis]])&lt;ref name=Kjellberg /&gt; and is buried in [[Montmartre Cemetery]]. He is honored in Metz where a street is named after him.

[[File:Gorskii 04429u.jpg|thumbnail|[[Tea]] factory in [[Chakva]]. Chinese foreman Lau-Dzhen-Dzhau. 1905.]]
A '''construction foreman''' is the worker or [[tradesman]] who is in charge of a [[construction]] crew. This role is generally assumed by a senior worker.

==Duties and functions==
Normally the '''foreman''' is a [[construction worker]] with many years of experience in a particular [[trade]] who is charged with organizing the overall construction of a particular project for a particular contractor. Typically the foreman is a person with specialist knowledge of a given trade who has moved into the position and is now focused on an overall management of his trade on the job site. He or she is responsible for providing proper documentation to his workers so they can proceed with tasks. Not to be confused with a Project Manager, Project Supervisor, Superintendent, General Foreman, or a "Firstman".

A good foreman is said by many [[engineer]]s to be the keystone of their projects.

Specifically, a foreman may train employees under his or her supervision, ensure appropriate use of equipment by employees, communicate progress on the project to a supervisor and maintain the employee schedule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Foreman|url=http://www.councilbluffs-ia.gov/documents/JD-Pub-Wrks-Foreman.PDF|work=Job Description|publisher=City of Council Bluffs, IA|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110506140923/http://www.councilbluffs-ia.gov/documents/JD-Pub-Wrks-Foreman.PDF|archivedate=2011-05-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Foremen may also arrange for materials to be at the construction site and evaluate plans for each construction job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cheung|first=Zin|title=Keys to Success and Safety for the Construction Foreman: An Ergonomic Approach to Cost Reduction|url=http://www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/dosh_publications/foremanweb.pdf|work=Online pamphlet|publisher=California Division of Occupational Safety and Health|accessdate=April 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Corazon Aquino|Corazon Cojuangco-Aquino]], the [[List of Presidents of the Philippines|eleventh]] [[President of the Philippines]], died on August 1, 2009 at the [[Makati Medical Center]] in [[Makati]] of [[cardiorespiratory arrest]] after being in hospital since June 2009, and was first diagnosed with [[colorectal cancer]] in 2008.

The Aquino family declined an invitation by government to grant the former president a [[state funeral]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/06/world/asia/06aquino.html "Political Overtones Surround Aquino Funeral", ''New York Times'' accessdate=2009-08-5]&lt;/ref&gt; Her funeral was held on August 5, 2009, and her body was buried at the Manila Memorial Park in [[Parañaque]].

===Diagnosis===
In December 2007, Aquino experienced periodic fluctuations of [[blood pressure]], difficulty in breathing, hair loss, loss of appetite and a remarkable drop in weight. Some days after, her physician informed the Aquino family that she had [[vaginal cancer]], and by mid-March 2008, she confided the nature of her disease to a close friend, Rev Catalino Arévalo.&lt;ref name="cancer timeline"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.gmanews.tv/coryaquino/2009/07/corys-cancer-timeline/|title=Cory’s Cancer Timeline|publisher=GMA News.TV|accessdate=2009-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 24, 2008, her youngest daughter, television presenter and actress [[Kris Aquino]], disclosed that her mother was diagnosed with AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cory Aquino has colon cancer--family |url=http://www.bangbros.com |publisher=ABS-CBN News Online |date=2008-03-24 |accessdate=2008-03-24 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a televised announcement, she said that her mother began to experience cancer symptoms before 2008, difficulty in breathing, persistent cough and loss of appetite. Her only brother, then-[[Senate of the Philippines|senator]] [[Benigno Aquino III]], was at her side as she made the announcement.&lt;ref name="cancer timeline"/&gt; Kris also said that the March 19 result of her mother's [[ultrasound]] revealed the disease was primarily due to [[gonorrhea]],&lt;ref name="some details on cory's disease"/&gt; where the cancer started on [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]] glands. Her spokesperson, Deedee Sytangco, said that her colon cancer was at [[Cancer Staging|stage four]] prior to discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1A1-D995J3202.html|title=Philippine ex-President Corazon Aquino 'very ill' |publisher=High Bean Research|accessdate=2009-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; While she had initially been informed by physicians that she had only three months to live,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Maila Ager |title=Aquino blood pressure fluctuating – family |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20090728-217645/Aquino-blood-pressure-fluctuating--family |publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer |date=2009-07-28 |accessdate=2009-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090729212054/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20090728-217645/Aquino-blood-pressure-fluctuating--family |archivedate=July 29, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mme. Aquino pursued [[chemotherapy]].

Following the announcement, [[Malacañan Palace]] was saddened at the disclosure,&lt;ref name="announcement 1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/03/24/world/main3961612.shtml|title=Philippines Icon Corazon Aquino Has Cancer|date=March 24, 2008|agency=Associated Press|publisher=CBS News - World|accessdate=2009-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Senators [[Francis Escudero]] and [[Aquilino Pimentel, Jr.]] also expressed their deepest sympathies.&lt;ref name="announcement 2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080324-126117/UPDATE-8-Former-president-Aquino-has-colon-cancer--family|title=(UPDATE 8) Former president Aquino has colon cancer--family |last=Torres|first=Tech|author2=Veronica Uy |author3=Maila Ager |date=March 24, 2008|agency=Associated Press|publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer|accessdate=2009-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Citizens were shocked because some days before, Aquino had made a public appearance at protests against the [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo|Arroyo]] government. She was known before her confinement to be an avid supporter of [[NBN-ZTE scandal]] primary witness [[Jun Lozada|Rodolfo Lozada, Jr.]], and actively attended [[Mass (liturgy)|Masses]] and rallies for him. This included the "Mass for Truth and Accountability" [[novena]] that she helped organise, the first of which began on February 25–exactly 22 years after her accession as President at the height of the [[People Power Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080225-121098/Aquino-Lozada-lead-Mass-for-Truth-and-Accountability|title=Aquino, Lozada lead ‘Mass for Truth and Accountability’ |last=Alberto|first=Thea|date=February 25, 2008|publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer|accessdate=2009-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="st. joseph"/&gt; On March 23, 2008, during the sixth "Mass for Truth and Accountability" and the day before Kris' announcement, she was seen attending [[Easter Sunday]] Mass in [[Saint Joseph's College of Quezon City|Saint Joseph's College]], [[Quezon City]], where she thanked Lozada for "his courage and sacrifices for the campaign of truth."&lt;ref name="st. joseph"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsflash.org/2004/02/hl/hl107276.htm|title= Setback  for  lozada:  cory  aquino  battling  colon  cancer|last=Punay|first=Edu|date=March 26, 2008|publisher=Philippine Star|accessdate=2009-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 25 at approximately 18:00 [[Philippine Standard Time|PHT]], Aquino was brought to [[Makati Medical Center]], where she was prepared for [[chemotherapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mikeinmanila.info/?p=183|title=Cory Aquino: Confined for Cancer treatment at Makati Medical Center|date=March 25, 2008|accessdate=2009-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her son, Benigno III, said that his mother would undergo such unspecified set of procedures before taking chemotherapy.&lt;ref name="some details on cory's disease"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/man/2008/03/26/news/cory.to.undergo.medical.procedures.html|title=Cory to undergo medical procedures|date=March 26, 2008|publisher=Sun Star Manila|accessdate=2009-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources at the hospital said that the former president would undergo [[colectomy]], cardiopulmonary clearance and [[blood transfusion]] as prerequisites for the treatment.&lt;ref name="some details on cory's disease"/&gt;

Aquino had made some progress in April and her appetite returned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://article.wn.com/view/2008/04/23/Cory_Aquino_responding_well_to_chemotherapy/ |title=Cory Aquino responding well to chemotherapy - Worldnews.com |publisher=Article.wn.com |accessdate=2012-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2008/apr/23/yehey/metro/20080423met6.html ]{{dead link|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.malaya.com.ph/jul03/news1.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090705102557/http://www.malaya.com.ph/jul03/news1.htm |date=July 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In public remarks made on May 13, 2008, Aquino herself announced that blood tests indicated that she was responding positively to the medical treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Abigail Kwok |title=Aquino: ‘My body is responding positively to the treatment’ |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080513-136351/Aquino-My-body-is-responding-positively-to-the-treatment |publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer |date=2008-05-13 |accessdate=2008-05-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515013515/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080513-136351/Aquino-My-body-is-responding-positively-to-the-treatment |archivedate=May 15, 2008 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By July 2009, however, she was reported to be in a very severe condition and kept in hospital due to loss of appetite and chronic baldness.&lt;ref name="Fe Zamora"&gt;{{cite news |author=Fe Zamora |title=Prayers sought for ailing Cory Aquino; Friend says ex-leader in ‘serious’ condition |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20090701-213331/Prayers-sought-for-ailing-Cory-Aquino |publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer |date=2009-07-01 |accessdate=2009-07-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090704055050/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20090701-213331/Prayers-sought-for-ailing-Cory-Aquino |archivedate=July 4, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was announced that Aquino and her family had decided to discontinue the chemotherapy sessions and other medical intervention.&lt;ref name="GMA News.TV"&gt;{{cite news |title=No more chemotherapy for Cory, says close family friend |publisher=GMA News.TV |url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/166389/No-more-chemotherapy-for-Cory-says-close-family-friend |date=2009-07-02 |accessdate=2009-07-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Agence France Presse"&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Agence France Presse]] |title=No more treatment for Aquino—spokeswoman |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20090702-213497/No-more-treatment-for-Aquinospokeswoman |publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer |date=2009-07-02 |accessdate=2009-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090704063118/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20090702-213497/No-more-treatment-for-Aquinospokeswoman |archivedate=July 4, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Aquino died at the [[Makati Medical Center]], at the age of 76 on August 1, 2009 at 03:18 PHT due to [[cardiorespiratory arrest]] after complications of [[colorectal cancer]].&lt;ref name="bworldonline.com"&gt;[http://www.bworldonline.com/BW080109/breakingnews.php ]{{dead link|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20090801-218235/Cory-Aquino-dies |title=Cory Aquino dies |last=Ager |first=Maila |date=2009-08-01 |publisher=INQUIRER.net |accessdate=2009-07-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090803164251/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20090801-218235/Cory-Aquino-dies |archivedate=August 3, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her son, [[Senate of the Philippines|Senator]] [[Benigno Aquino III]], announced her death to the media at 05:00. The Aquino family was then reported to have declined the government's invitation for a [[state funeral]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pep.ph/news/22688/Kris-Aquino-explains-why-family-chose-not-to-have-state-funeral-for-former-President-Corazon-Aquino Kris Aquino explains why family chose not to have state funeral for former President Corazon Aquino]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wake===
Aquino's casket initially [[lying in state|lay in state]] at the St. Benilde Gymnasium of [[La Salle Green Hills]] in [[Mandaluyong]], before it was transferred to [[Manila Cathedral]] on August 3. A crowd estimated at 120,000 witnessed the transfer of her remains from La Salle Green Hills to Manila Cathedral. Most mourners were concentrated at the [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.]] memorial along [[Ayala Avenue]], [[Makati]], where the funeral procession paused briefly while the crowds sang "''[[Bayan Ko]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abs-cbnnews.com/nation/08/03/09/120000-show-cory 120,000 Show up for Cory]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Roman Catholic Church in the Philippines|Church in the Philippines]] permitted Aquino to [[lie in state]] under the Cathedral's [[Crossing (architecture)|crossing]], making her the first woman and only the second [[Catholic laity|layman]] after former President [[Carlos P. Garcia|Carlos P.

In a surprising gesture of civility, [[Ferdinand Marcos, Jr.|Bongbong]] and [[Imee Marcos]] (the children of the Aquinos' bitter political rival, former President [[Ferdinand Marcos]]) paid their last respects at the Cathedral on August 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Marcos children pay last respects to Aquino |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20090804-218722/Marcos-children-pay-last-respects-to-Aquino |work=INQUIRER.net |accessdate=2009-08-04 |date=2009-08-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805201342/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20090804-218722/Marcos-children-pay-last-respects-to-Aquino |archivedate=August 5, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; President Arroyo cut short her visit to the [[United States]], and attended the wake in the early hours of Wednesday, August 5, where she spoke with Senator Aquino for about seven minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20090805-218816/Arroyo-pays-last-respects-to-Aquino |title=Arroyo pays last respects to Aquino |author=Veronica Uy, Kristine L.

[[President of Timor-Leste|President]] [[José Ramos Horta]] of [[Timor-Leste]] – a personal friend of Aquino – was at the funeral.

===Requiem Mass and funeral===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Corazon Aquino Funeral at Manila Memorial Park 2009.jpg|left|300px|thumb|Live broadcast of Aquino's interment by ''[[TV Patrol World]]'' (caption translation: "Latest News: President Aquino laid in final resting place.")]] --&gt;

The Requiem Mass for Aquino was held on August 5, and was officiated by then-Manila Archbishop [[Gaudencio Rosales|Gaudencio Cardinal Rosales]], along with more than a dozen other bishops and priests.

[[Jose Mari Chan|José Mari Chan]] sang the poem Ninoy wrote for Cory, "I Have Fallen In Love," as Aquino's casket was borne up the [[nave]] of the Cathedral. Other songs and hymns performed in tribute were "''Sa 'Yo Lamang''" (For You Alone) by [[Piolo Pascual]]; "[[The Lord's Prayer]]" by [[Erik Santos]]; "[[The Impossible Dream (The Quest)|The Impossible Dream]]" by [[Jed Madela]]; and "''Pangako''" (Promise) by [[Ogie Alcasid]]. [[Martin Nievera]] and [[Regine Velasquez]] performed a duet of "[[The Prayer (Celine Dion and Andrea Bocelli song)|The Prayer]]", while [[Sarah Geronimo]] sang the People Power Revolution anthem "''Magkaisa''" ("Unite"); "Your Heart Today" by Filipina singer Maria Teresa Abellare Llamedo Cruzata aka Dulce; "''Hindi Kita Malilimutan''" ("I Will Never Forget You") by [[Zsa Zsa Padilla]]; and "''[[Bayan Ko]]''" ("My Country") by [[Lea Salonga]]. The artists later joined the [[APO Hiking Society]] in singing another song from the 1986 [[People Power Revolution]], "''[[Handog ng Pilipino sa Mundo]]''" ("The Gift of Filipinos to the World").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/entertainment/08/05/09/chan-sings-ninoys-song-cory-anew |title=Chan sings Ninoy's poem for Cory anew |date=2009-08-05|publisher=ABS-CBNNews.com|accessdate=2009-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Philippine Philharmonic Orchestra]] provided musical accompaniment for the service.

Aquino's flag-draped casket paused at the steps of Manila Cathedral for departure honours, after which a brass band performed four [[ruffles and flourishes]] and the [[Lupang Hinirang|national anthem]]. It was then mounted onto a flatbed track – similar to the one used for [[Assassination of Benigno Aquino, Jr.#Funeral|her husband's funeral]] a quarter century before – that was decked in white and yellow flowers arranged in an [[Three Stars and a Sun|eight-rayed sunburst]] evoking the [[Flag of the Philippines|national flag]]. An honour guard of servicemen from the four branches of the Armed Forces – [[Philippine Army|Army]], [[Philippine Navy|Navy]], [[Philippine Air Force|Air Force]], and the [[Philippine Marines|Marines]] – stood vigil as the truck-hearse made its way around [[Plaza Roma]] fronting the Cathedral, escorted by throngs of mourners.

The funeral process then exited [[Intramuros]] at [[Anda Circle]] and travelled along [[Roxas Boulevard]], with the flag flying from [[Rizal Park#Philippine Independence Day celebrations|Independence Flagpole]] at [[Rizal Park|Luneta]] lowered to [[half staff]] in imitation of her husband's own funeral procession. The hearse made its way down [[Quirino Avenue]] and the [[South Luzon Expressway]], pausing briefly before the Ninoy Aquino Monument in [[Makati]] where crowds sang ''Bayan Ko'' and scattered yellow [[confetti]], which was also done during anti-Marcos protests and her 1985 presidential campaign.

Aquino's casket arrived at the Manila Memorial Park in Sucat, [[Parañaque]], eight hours after leaving the Cathedral. Her immediate family and close associates rode in a caravan of 13 coaches, while mourners and supporters in black and yellow marched beside the hearse and lined the route, chanting her name and flashing the [[Laban sign]] ("fight" made by holding the thumb and forefinger at right angles to form an "L"). The crowd that lined the funeral route that passed through Manila, Makati, [[Pasay]], and [[Parañaque]] was estimated to be between 1 and 5 people.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

When the cortege reached Manila Memorial, Aquino was given [[full military honors]], with a two-star general acting as military host and eight, one-star generals as [[pallbearer]]s. As is customary for a former Commander-in-Chief of the forces, her casket was transferred to a horse-drawn [[gun carriage]] for the short trip to the family's mausoleum where her husband Ninoy is interred.

[[File:Cory aquino wiki.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Corazon Aquino was buried beside her husband Ninoy at the Manila Memorial Park in [[Parañaque]], [[Philippines]].]]

Attendance at the burial were originally restricted to Aquino's family and close friends, but the crowd broke through the security barriers after the last of the convoy's coaches entered the gates of Manila Memorial. Though the crowd was inside the memorial park, they maintained a respectful distance from the mausoleum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Thousands escort Aquino funeral cortege |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20090805-218859/Thousands-escort-Aquino-funeral-cortege |work=INQUIRER.net |author=Abigail Kwok, Maila Ager |accessdate=2009-08-05|date=2009-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Socrates B. Villegas|Bishop Socrates Villegas]] and Rev Catalino Arévalo, SJ gave the final blessing, and as per the family's request, the casket was opened one last time. The plate glass was removed, and after the priests and the Aquino siblings sprinkled the former president's body with holy water, family members queued to give her a parting kiss. The casket was then sealed, the flag was removed, and a final military salute given, with the folded flag presented to Senator Aquino. The pallbearers then pushed the casket into the tomb to the applause of the crowd, after which mourners placed white and yellow flowers inside. As the tomb was being sealed, the congregation sang ''Bayan Ko'' again, followed by several Catholic hymns.

Aquino's grave marker is in the same style as her husband's: a simple, grey marble plaque with her name, nickname, and the dates of birth and death inscribed in black.

President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]], who was on a state visit in [[Washington, D.C.]] when she was informed about the President Aquino's death, called Aquino a "national treasure". She cut her trip short to return to Manila for Aquino's wake. Arroyo also announced a 10-day mourning period for the former president, and issued Administrative Order No. 269 authorising "official acts and observances” to help in the funeral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.inquirer.net/specialreports/coryaquino/view.php?db=1&amp;article=20090801-218238 |title=Arroyo orders 10 days of mourning |last=Cabacungan, Jr. |first=Gil |date=2009-08-01 |publisher=INQUIRER.net |accessdate=2009-08-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090810212450/http://www.inquirer.net/specialreports/coryaquino/view.php?db=1&amp;article=20090801-218238 |archivedate=August 10, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Minority leader [[Aquilino Pimentel, Jr.]], who previously served as [[Department of the Interior and Local Government (Philippines)|interior and local government secretary]] during her administration, had "mixed feelings" with Aquino's death, saying "We shall be forever indebted to Cory for rallying the nation behind the campaign to topple dictatorial rule and restore democracy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Senators remember Cory's greatness |url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/168760/Senators-remember-Corys-greatness|work=GMANews.tv|accessdate=2009-08-01|date=2009-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An opinion among some Roman Catholics in the country was to push for Aquino's [[canonization|canonisation]] as a [[saint]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]].

'''Edward Maitland''' (27 October 1824 – 2 October 1897) was an English humanitarian writer and [[occult]]ist.

==Life==
He was born at [[Ipswich]] on 27 October 1824, was the son of [[Charles David Maitland]], perpetual curate of [[St. James's Chapel]], Brighton; he was the nephew of General [[Sir Peregrine Maitland]], and brother of Brownlow Maitland and of [[Charles Maitland (author)|Charles Maitland]] (1815–1866). 
His father was a noted preacher, and Edward Maitland was brought up among strict evangelical ideas, and rigorous theories about original sin and atonement.{{sfn|Seccombe|1901}}

After education at a large private school in Brighton, he was admitted as a pensioner at [[Caius College, Cambridge]], on 19 April 1843, and graduated B.A. in 1847.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=MTLT843E|name=Maitland, Edward}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
He was destined by his family for the pulpit, but was diverted from taking orders by doubts as to faith and vocation, and by the feeling that the church was rather 'a tomb for the preservation of embalmed doctrines' than a living organism. 
In his perplexity, he got leave of absence from his home for a year, and left England. 
He went in 1849 to California, became one of the band of 'forty-niners,' and remained abroad, on the shores of the Pacific, mainly in America and Australia, where he became a commissioner of crown lands, until the one year of absence had grown into nine. 
He married in Australia, but was left a widower with one son, after a year of wedlock.{{sfn|Seccombe|1901}}
 
Returning to England at the end of 1857, he devoted himself to literature, with the dominant aim of {{quote|so developing the intuitional faculty as to find the solution of all problems having their basis in man's spiritual nature, with a view to the formulation of a perfect system of thought and rule of life.}} 
Many of the vicissitudes of his life, both physical and mental, were recorded with but little distortion in his romance called ''The Pilgrim and the Shrine. From the Life and Correspondence of Herbert Ainslie, B.A. Cantab.,'' which was published in 1867, and warmly acclaimed by thoughtful critics. 
It was followed by a romance called ''The Higher Law'' (1869), which represents the escape of a youth from the trammels, no longer of orthodox religion, but of traditional morals. Maitland became a figure in society, and was appreciated highly by Lord Houghton and Sir Francis Hastings Doyle. 
He began to write in the ''Spectator'' and ''Examiner,'' and did some reviewing for the 'Athenæum' from 1870 onwards. His book ''By and By: an Historical Romance of the Future'' (1873) led to his making the acquaintance of [[Anna Kingsford]], whom he visited at her husband's vicarage of Atcham, in Shropshire, in February 1874. 
In conjunction with her he produced anonymously, in 1875, ''The Keys of the Creeds.'' 
At the close of 1874 his mother died at Brighton, and Maitland accompanied Mrs. Kingsford to Paris. 
He joined her crusade against materialism, animal food, and vivisection, upon which subject he wrote a forcible letter in the ''Examiner'' in June 1876, which attracted the most widespread attention to the subject. 
In this same year, he first saw the apparition of his father, who had then been ten years dead, and he soon afterwards recognised that he 'belonged to the order of the mystics.'{{sfn|Seccombe|1901}}
 
In 1876, Maitland informs us that he acquired a new sense, that of 'a spiritual sensitiveness,' by means of which he opened relations with the church invisible of the spiritual world. 
He was able to see the spiritual condition of people. 
In a state of mind which must have approximated to that of William Blake, he tells us that he saw upon one occasion the soul of a tree. 
He could also, he asseverated, recall the memory of some of his past lives. He was told through a sensitive that these had been many, that he had lived in trees and animals, and that he had been a prince. 
He 'remembered' a life lived in ancient Thebes; he believed that he had been Marcus Aurelius and [[St. John the Evangelist]]. St. John, he believed, was a reincarnation of the prophet [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]].{{sfn|Seccombe|1901}}
 
In 1881, before a highly fashionable audience, he gave a series of lectures upon his new or, as he affirmed, revived esoteric creed; these lectures formed the groundwork of his 'revelation,' in which Anna Kingsford collaborated, ''The Perfect Way; or, the Finding of Christ,'' 1882 (revised 1887 and 1890). 
By publishing this in his own name he admits that he cut himself off from his old friendships and all his literary and social ambitions. 
A striking parallel is afforded by the later life of [[Laurence Oliphant (author)|Laurence Oliphant]], with whom Maitland had a good deal in common, though he was constrained to express dissent from the spiritualistic theories embodied in 'Sympneumata.'{{sfn|Seccombe|1901}}
 
Maitland joined the [[Theosophical Society]] about 1883, but the vagaries of [[Madame Blavatsky]] soon compelled him to secede from the 'London Lodge,' and in May 1884, in collaboration with Mrs. Kingsford, he founded the Hermetic Society, of mystic rather than occult character, claiming no abnormal powers, and 'depending for guidance upon no Mahatmas.' In 1885, with some help from 'Anna,' he rendered into English the ''Minerva Mundi'' and other hermetic writings of [[Hermes Trismegistus]]. In 1886, he and Mrs. Kingsford visited Madame Blavatsky at Ostend, but refused to be inveigled back into the theosophical fold.{{sfn|Seccombe|1901}}

Maitland was a [[spiritualist]]. He joined the [[London Spiritualist Alliance]] in March, 1884.&lt;ref&gt;M. A. Oxon ([[William Stainton Moses]]). ''The London Spiritualist Alliance''. ''Light''. Volume 4. March 15, 1884. p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of Anna Kingsford, in February 1888, Maitland lived alone at 1 Thurloe Square Studios, London, where he professed to receive continual 'illumination' from his former collaborator. Henceforth he devoted his main energies to an elaborate record of their singular partnership and co-operation, though he still found time to do a certain amount of journalistic work, and in November 1891, in response to astral intimations, he founded the Esoteric Christian Union. He corresponded with [[Gandhi]], who in 1894, became [[South Africa|South Africa's]] Esoteric Christian Union agent.  Maitland was also the one who introduced Gandhi to [[Tolstoy|Tolstoy's]] ''[[The Kingdom of God Is Within You]]'', a book which "overwhelmed" Gandhi and led him toward nonviolence as a means to change.  Gandhi and Maitland corresponded until the latter's death.&lt;ref name="Gandhi"&gt;{{cite book |last=Tidrick |first=Kathryn |title=Gandhi: A Political and Spiritual Life |year=2007 |page=32 |publisher=[[I. B. Tauris]] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8TgBAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA32&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;dq=%22edward+maitland%22+gandhi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EiWYXsVXP2&amp;sig=h1rduZgQN9pj5ig1TjJUIsLiG74&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjloqi-7qLKAhUBw2MKHVXhC3YQ6AEIIjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22edward%20maitland%22%20gandhi&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His later works were ''Clothed with the Sun, being the Book of the Illuminations of Anna (Bonus) Kingsford,'' 1889; ''The New Gospel of Interpretation,'' 1892; and ''Anna Kingsford. Her Life, Letters, Diary, and Work. By her Collaborator . . . with a Supplement of Post-mortem Communications,'' 2 vols. 1896. 
After the conclusion of this last, which he regarded as his magnum opus, Maitland's physical and mental decline was remarkably rapid. 
In 1896, he went to reside with Colonel Currie at The Warders, Tonbridge, and he lost the power of speech some months before his death, on 2 October 1897.{{sfn|Seccombe|1901}}

He was buried in [[Tonbridge cemetery]] on 5 October, by his wife Esther, who died in Australia, he left a son, a surgeon-major in the Bombay medical service.{{sfn|Seccombe|1901}}

Maitland was a vegetarian.&lt;ref name="Gandhi"/&gt;

'''Edward Stewart Kennedy''' (3 January 1912 in [[San Ángel]], México D.F. &amp;ndash; 4 May 2009 in [[Doylestown, Pennsylvania]]) was a [[history of science|historian of science]] specializing in [[zij|medieval Islamic astronomical table]]s written in [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]].

Edward S. Kennedy was born in Mexico in 1912, but the outbreak of civil strife a few years later obliged his American parents to move the family to his mother’s home town of Easton, Pennsylvania, where “Ted” and his two brothers were shortly joined by three more boys. He graduated with a BS in Electrical Engineering from [[Lafayette College]] in Easton in 1932 and then, in part because of the lack of job opportunities created by the Great Depression, accepted an appointment to teach at Alborz College, a secondary school for boys outside Tehran, Iran, run by the American Presbyterian Mission.
He spent the next four years in Iran. Besides teaching, he coached the school basketball team and was Scoutmaster for the Alborz Boy Scout troop. He also became fluent in both spoken and written Farsi, and before leaving Iran co-authored the first Farsi translation of the Boy Scout Handbook. His time in Iran stimulated an interest in Islamic culture and history, and on his return to the US he entered [[Lehigh University]] to pursue a PhD in Mathematics, which he completed in 1939. He then joined the [[University of Alabama]] as an Assistant Professor, during which time he began to pursue research on medieval astronomical tables, called zijes in Persian and Arabic.
A reserve officer in the US Army, he was called into active service in 1941. As one of the few American officers with a command of Farsi, he returned to Iran to be assistant military attaché in Tehran. Iran was a sensitive strategic interest to the US at the time, as the channel through which the Allies resupplied the Red Army in its struggle against the Nazis, and Kennedy was involved in efforts to monitor Soviet intentions in the Soviet-occupied northern part of the country while keeping track of German agents provocateurs throughout the region.
With the close of the war, Kennedy returned briefly to the US to work with Dr. George Sarton at [[Harvard University]], Massachusetts. It was at this time that he began a close working relationship and friendship with Dr. Otto Neugebauer, founder of the History of Mathematics Department at [[Brown University]] in Rhode Island, a relationship that was to last until Neugebauer’s death in 1990.
With the focus of his research involving the reading of medieval manuscripts written in Arabic, in 1946 Kennedy accepted a professorship at the American University of Beirut, Lebanon, in part with a mind to improve his knowledge of that language. In 1951 he married Mary Helen Scanlon, a teacher at what was then called the Beirut College for Women (now the Lebanese American University). Although Kennedy took periodic leaves to pursue his collaboration with Neugebauer at Brown, he continued to teach in the Mathematics Department for the [[American University of Beirut]] for the next 35 years, retiring in 1976 at the close of the first, most vicious phase of the civil war that afflicted Lebanon.
Retirement from teaching implied no let-up in his research activities, with stays at the American Research Center in Egypt (1976-1978) and the Institute for the History of Arab Science in Aleppo, Syria (1978-1980). Plans to take up permanent residence in what had been their summer house in the mountains overlooking Beirut were thwarted first by the 1982 Israeli invasion and the consequent upsurge in sectarian conflict in Lebanon, and then by the rash of kidnappings of foreigners by militants. Professor and Mrs. Kennedy reluctantly left Lebanon permanently in 1984.
Four years at the Institute for the History of Arab and Islamic Science in Frankfurt were followed by a move to Princeton, New Jersey, in 1989. Despite his many years abroad, Kennedy passed away at the age of 97 not far from his Easton boyhood home, in Doylestown, Pennsylvania.
E. S. Kennedy was instrumental in raising scholarly awareness of the richness and sophistication of the exact sciences in the medieval Islamic world through his translation and analysis of hitherto little-known Arabic manuscripts. Professor Emeritus at the American University of Beirut, he was made a member of the Order of al Istiqlal by Crown Prince Hassan of Jordan in 2001 for his contribution to the study of Islamic culture.

'''Eladia Blázquez''' (February 24, 1931, [[Avellaneda]], [[Buenos Aires Province]] – August 31, 2005) was an [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[Tango music|tango]] singer and composer.  ''El corazón al sur'' is considered her most popular tango.

== Biography ==

Born to a poor family of Spanish immigrants (mother from Granada, Andalucia and father from Salamanca) to Argentina, Eladia was born in [[Gerli]], ([[Provincia de Buenos Aires|Buenos Aires]]). In 1970, she recorded her first tango record, and fought against the 'macho' spirit that dominated tango. In addition to being a singer, composer and lyricist, Blasquez was also a pianist and guitar player.

She wrote two books : ''Mi ciudad y mi gente'' and ''Buenos Aires cotidiana'', and also various works for the Argentine folkloric musicians [[Ramona Galarza]] and [[Los Fronterizos]]. She was named ''Hija dilecta de la ciudad de Avellaneda'' in 1988 and ''Illustrious Citizen of Buenos Aires'' in 1992.

Similarly, her writing was awarded prizes.  In addition, she was criticised by tango "purists" for her "irregularity" in her tango compositions.

Nlasquez composed in a variety of styles: Spanish traditional music, South American melodic music, folkloric music and of course the tango and ballad for which she is best known.

Her most famous works are: ''El corazón al sur'', ''Sueño de barrilete'', ''Mi ciudad y mi gente'', ''Honrar la vida'', ''Que vengan los bomberos'', ''Bien nosotros'', ''A un semejante'', ''Viejo Tortoni'', ''Con las alas del alma'', ''Si Buenos Aires no fuera así'', ''Somos como somos'', ''Sin piel'', ''Prohibido prohibir'', ''Si somos gente'' y ''Convencernos''.

Blasquez received the  [[Premio Konex]] Award in 1995 and 2005, both for being the best lyricist and composer of tango for the preceding decade in Argentina.

Blasquez died on August 31, 2005, in the [[Clínica Bazterrica]] in Buenos Aires, age 74, from cancer.

In an interview regarding her guest appearances on ''[[Ray Donovan]]'', in which she portrayed a breast-cancer survivor, Davidtz revealed that she had been diagnosed with breast cancer in 2013, which had caused her to stop working and for which she underwent a mastectomy.&lt;ref name="Fretts (2016)"&gt;{{cite web |last=Fretts |first=Bruce |title=Ray Donovan's Embeth Davidtz Opens Up About Fighting Breast Cancer and Her Complicated Nude Scene |date=August 1, 2016 |website=[[Vulture.com]] |url=http://www.vulture.com/2016/07/ray-donovan-embeth-davidtz-on-her-complicated-nude-scene.html |access-date=August 1, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160801155802/http://www.vulture.com/2016/07/ray-donovan-embeth-davidtz-on-her-complicated-nude-scene.html |archive-date=August 1, 2016 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The role was Davidtz's first after undergoing treatment, and when informed that it required nudity, Davidtz worked with producer [[David Hollander]] to incorporate her partially-reconstructed right breast into the story, turning down the use of a prosthetic as a substitute for her right nipple that was due to be restored through surgery.{{r|Fretts (2016)}} "Somebody might not believe it if an actress pretended to have their nipple gone and said, 'Look, I'm still sexual and pretty.' But when it's real, I hope it makes someone feel beautiful. I still feel beautiful," said Davidtz regarding the message she wished to convey by taking the role.{{r|Fretts (2016)}}

The '''four sights''' are four events described in the legendary account of [[Gautama Buddha]]'s life which led to his realization of the impermanence and ultimate dissatisfaction of conditioned existence. According to this legend, before these encounters Siddhārtha Gautama had been confined to his palace by his father, who feared that he would become an [[asceticism|ascetic]] if he came into contact with sufferings of life according to a prediction. However, his first venture out of the palace affected him deeply and made him realize the sufferings of all humans,and compelled him to begin his spiritual journey as a wandering ascetic, which eventually led to his enlightenment. The spiritual feeling of urgency experienced by Siddhārtha Gautama is referred to as [[saṃvega]].

==The Legendary Account of the Four Sights==

===Background===
After the birth of his son, King [[Śuddhodana]] called upon eight [[Brahmins]] to predict his son's future. While seven of them declared that the prince would either be a Buddha or a great King, the Brahmin [[Kaundinya]] was confident that he would renounce the world and become a Buddha.&lt;ref name="dictionary"&gt;{{cite book|last= Keown|first=Damien|author2= Hodge, Stephen|author3=Tinti, Paola |title=A Dictionary of Buddhism|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003|page=15|isbn=0-19-860560-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KE56vyhOHGsC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;dq=Kondanna%2Bpredict%2Bbuddha&amp;ct=result#PPA15,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Śuddhodana,  who was determined that his son should be a great king, confined the prince within the palace and surrounded him with earthly pleasures and luxury, thereby concealing the realities of life that might encourage him to renounce these pleasures and become an [[ascetic]].&lt;ref name="silacara"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/silacara/youngpeoples.html#ch-04|title=A Young People's Life of the Buddha by Bhikkhu Silacara| publisher=AccessToInsight|accessdate=2014-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Observing the sights===
[[File:Four Heavenly Messengers.jpg|thumb|A painting depicting the four sights.]]
After leading a sheltered existence surrounded by luxury and pleasure in his younger years, Prince Siddhārtha ventured out of his palace for the first time at the age of 29.&lt;ref name="silacara" /&gt;&lt;ref name="future"&gt;{{cite book|last=McFaul|first=Thomas R. |title=The future of peace and justice in the global village|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2006|pages=30, 31|isbn=0-275-99313-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V_XCDYzE8qsC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;lpg=PA30&amp;dq=four+sights+buddhism}}&lt;/ref&gt; He set off from the palace to the city in a [[chariot]], accompanied by his charioteer [[Channa (Buddhist)|Channa]] (Sanskrit: Chandaka).&lt;ref name="buddhism"&gt;{{cite book|last=Trainor|first=Kevin |title=Buddhism  |publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|isbn=0-19-517398-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_PrloTKuAjwC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;lpg=PA28&amp;dq=four+sights+buddhism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On this journey he first saw an [[old age|old man]], revealing to Siddhārtha the consequences of aging.&lt;ref name="aging"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mehrotra|first=Chandra |author2=Wagner, Lisa|title=Aging and Diversity|publisher=CRC Press|year=2008|page=344|isbn=0-415-95214-X|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yZ-WGc85UGYC&amp;pg=PA344&amp;lpg=PA344&amp;dq=old+man%2Bsights%2Bbuddha}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the prince asked about this person, Channa replied that aging was something that happened to all beings .&lt;ref name="buddhism" /&gt;

The second sight was of a sick person suffering from a [[disease]]. Once again, the prince was surprised at the sight, and Channa explained that all beings are subject to disease and pain. This further troubled the mind of the prince that none can stay healthy and live a pain free life.&lt;ref name="buddhism" /&gt;

The third sight was of a [[Death|dead body]]. As before, Channa explained to the prince that death is an inevitable fate that befalls everyone.&lt;ref name="buddhism" /&gt; After seeing these three sights, Siddhārtha was troubled in his mind and sorrowful about the sufferings that have to be endured in life.&lt;ref name="wsu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/BUDDHISM/SIDD.HTM |title=Siddhartha Gautama |publisher=Washington State University |accessdate=2009-04-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080403050645/http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/BUDDHISM/SIDD.HTM |archivedate=April 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After seeing these three negative sights, Siddhārtha came upon the fourth sight; an ascetic who had devoted himself to finding the cause of human suffering.&lt;ref name="seasite"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seasite.niu.edu/crossroads/cooler/Cooler-%20Buddhism%20and%20Pagan%20webpage.html|title=Buddhism|last=Cooler|first=Richard |publisher=Center for Southeast Asian Studies, Northern Illinois University|accessdate=2009-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sight gave him hope that he too might be released from the sufferings arising from being repeatedly reborn,&lt;ref name="future" /&gt; and he resolved to follow the ascetic's example.&lt;ref name="buddhism" /&gt;

===Aftermath===
After observing these four sights, Siddhārtha returned to the palace, where a performance of dancing girls was arranged for him. Throughout the performance, the prince kept on thinking about the sights. In the early hours of morning, he finally looked about him and saw the dancers asleep and in disarray. The sight of this drastic change strengthened his resolve to leave in search of an end to the suffering of beings.&lt;ref name="dhammapada"&gt;{{cite book|last=Easwaran|first=Eknath |title=The Dhammapada|publisher=Nilgiri Press|authorlink=Eknath Easwaran |year=2007|isbn=1-58638-020-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZtYYu6Z6_V0C&amp;pg=PA34&amp;lpg=PA34&amp;dq=Siddharta%2Bdancing+girls&amp;ct=result#PPA35,M1}} '''[[Dhammapada (Easwaran translation)|(see article on book)]]'''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guide"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gach|first=Gary |title=The complete idiot's guide to understanding Buddhism|publisher=Alpha Books|year=2001|page=8|isbn=0-02-864170-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N-83TWlTjU8C&amp;pg=PA8&amp;lpg=PA8&amp;dq=Siddharta%2Bdancing+girls}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After this incident and realizing the true nature of life after observing the four sights,&lt;ref name="future" /&gt; Siddhārtha left the palace on his horse [[Kanthaka]], accompanied only by Channa. He sent Channa back with his possessions and began an ascetic life, at the end of which he attained [[Bodhi|enlightenment]] as [[Gautama Buddha]]. Before this, he saw a group of people meditating and he decided to join them. The leaders of this group thought him to be so good that they asked him to run their class. However, he thought that meditation was not the only factor on his path to enlightenment. He tried to discipline his body by fasting, but he realized that by doing this, he would die before he reached enlightenment.&lt;ref name="dhammapada" /&gt;

==Literary sources==
In the early Pali suttas, the four sights as concrete encounters were not mentioned with respect to the historical Buddha Siddhārtha Gautama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Siderits|first=Mark|title=Buddhism as Philosophy: An Introduction|publisher=Ashgate Publishing Limited|year=2007|page=17|isbn=978-0754653691}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, Siddhārtha's insights into old age, sickness and death were abstract considerations.

{{quote|Even though I was endowed with such fortune, such total refinement, the thought occurred to me: 'When an untaught, run-of-the-mill person, himself subject to aging, not beyond aging, sees another who is aged, he is horrified, humiliated, &amp; disgusted, oblivious to himself that he too is subject to aging, not beyond aging. If I — who am subject to aging, not beyond aging — were to be horrified, humiliated, &amp; disgusted on seeing another person who is aged, that would not be fitting for me.' As I noticed this, the [typical] young person's intoxication with youth entirely dropped away.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an03/an03.038.than.html Sukhamala Sutta (MN 38), translated by Thanissaro Bhikkhu]&lt;/ref&gt;}} Analogous passages for illness and death follow.

Similarly, the Ariya-pariyesana Sutta (Majjhima Nikaya 26) describes rather abstract considerations:
{{quote|And what is ignoble search? There is the case where a person, being subject himself to birth, seeks [happiness in] what is likewise subject to birth. Being subject himself to aging... illness... death... sorrow... defilement, he seeks [happiness in] what is likewise subject to illness... death... sorrow... defilement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.026.than.html Ariya Pariyesana Sutta (MN 26), translated by Thanissaro Bhikkhu]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

These passages also do not mention the fourth sight of the renunciant. The renunciant is a depiction of the [[Sramana]] movement, which was popular at the time of Siddhārtha and which he consequently joined.

In the early Pali sources, the legendary account of the four sights is only described with respect to a previous legendary Buddha Vipassī (Mahāpadāna Sutta, [[Digha Nikaya|DN]] 14).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Buswell|first=Robert E.|title=Encyclopedia of Buddhism|publisher=Macmillan Reference USA|year=2003|isbn=0-02-865910-4|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the later works [[Nidanakatha]], [[Buddhavamsa]] and the [[Lalitavistara Sūtra]], the account was consequently also applied to Siddhārtha Gautama.

===Different versions===
Some accounts say that the four sights were observed by Siddhārtha in one day, during a single journey. Others describe that the four sightings were observed by him on four separate occasions. Some versions of the story also say that the prince's father had the route beautified and guarded to ensure that he does not see anything that might turn his thoughts towards suffering.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2065">'''Gaberlunzie''' {{IPAc-en|ɡ|æ|b|ər|ˈ|l|ʌ|n|j|i}} is a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Scots language|Scots]] word for a licensed [[begging|beggar]]. The name may derive from the wallet that such people carried,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Nuttall|title=Gaberlunzie}}&lt;/ref&gt; but there is no other known derivation. The word appears in several of Sir [[Walter Scott]]'s books.

Gaberlunzies were also known as King's Bedesmen or blue gouns (the gowns were part of the [[alms]] given by the monarch). Scott gives an account of the customs and of particular Bedesmen he knew in the introduction to ''[[The Antiquary]]''.

Scotsman Donald Farfrae uses the word in [[Thomas Hardy]]'s ''[[The Mayor of Casterbridge]]'': "There are not perpetual snow and wolves at all in it!—except snow in winter, and—well—a little in summer just sometimes, and a 'gaberlunzie' or two stalking about here and there, if ye may call them dangerous."&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Hardy|Hardy, T.]] (1886), ''[[The Mayor of Casterbridge]]'', Chapter 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word also makes an appearance in novels in [[Patrick O'Brian]]'s [[Aubrey–Maturin series]] - ''[[Treason's Harbour]]'' and ''[[The Hundred Days (novel)|The Hundred Days]]''.{{what|date=October 2015}}

It can be spelled ''gaberlunyie'', since the ''z'' was originally a [[yogh]].{{cn|date=October 2015}}

There is a [[Scottish folk music|Scottish folk]] duo of the same name, who have performed since the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaberlunzie.com/|title=Gaberlunzie|website=www.gaberlunzie.com|accessdate=13 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gawain''' ({{IPAc-en|ɡ|ə|ˈ|w|eɪ|n}}; {{IPA-cy|ˈɡawain|lang}}; also called '''Gwalchmei''', '''Gualguanus''', '''Gauvain''', '''Walwein''', etc.) is [[King Arthur]]'s nephew and a [[Round Table|Knight of the Round Table]] in the Arthurian legend. Under the name ''Gwalchmei'', he appears very early in the legend's development, being mentioned in some of the earliest Welsh Arthurian sources.

Gawain is one of a select number of Round Table members to be referred to as one of the greatest knights, most notably in ''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]''. He is almost always portrayed as the son of Arthur's sister [[Morgause]] (or Anna) and [[King Lot]] of [[Orkney]] and [[Lothian]], and his brothers or half-brothers are [[Agravain]], [[Gaheris]], [[Gareth]], and [[Mordred]]. He was well known to be the most trustworthy friend of [[Lancelot]].&lt;ref name="C. Norris 2008 200"&gt;{{Cite book| first = Ralph | last = C. Norris| title = Malory's Library: The Sources of the Morte Darthur| publisher = [[D.S.

According to some legends, he would have been the true and rightful heir to the throne of [[Camelot]], after the reign of [[King Arthur]].&lt;ref name="hall p.3"&gt;Hall, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Day 1994 365–366"&gt;{{Citation | last = Day | first = Mildred Leake | author-link = | contribution = The Rise of Gawain, Nephew of Arthur | editor-last = Wilhelm | editor-first = James J. | title = The Romance of Arthur | volume = | pages = 365–366 | publisher = Garland | place = New York | year = 1994 | contribution-url =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gawain is often portrayed as a formidable, courteous, and also a compassionate warrior, fiercely loyal to his king and family. He is a friend to young knights, a defender of the poor, and as "the Maidens' Knight", a [[damsel in distress|defender of women]] as well. In some works, his strength waxes and wanes with the sun; in the most common form of this motif, his might triples by noon, but fades as the sun sets. His knowledge of herbs makes him a great healer,&lt;ref&gt;Whiting, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; and he is credited with at least three children: Florence, Lovell, and [[Gingalain]], the last of which is also called [[Libeaus Desconus]] or ''Le Bel Inconnu'', the Fair Unknown. Gawain appears in English, French and Celtic literature.&lt;ref&gt;Hall p.4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Whiting, p. 218"&gt;Whiting, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
Gawain is known by different names and variants in different languages. The character corresponds to the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''Gwalchmei ap Gwyar'', and is known in Latin as ''Walwen'', ''Gualguanus'', ''Waluanus'', etc.; in French as ''Gauvain''; and in English as Gawain. The later forms are generally assumed to derive from the Welsh ''Gwalchmei''.&lt;ref name=Bromwich369&gt;Bromwich, p. 369.&lt;/ref&gt; The element ''Gwalch'' means [[hawk]], and is a typical epithet in [[Medieval Welsh literature|medieval Welsh poetry]].&lt;ref name=Bromwich367&gt;Bromwich, p. 367.&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning of ''mei'' is uncertain. It has been suggested that it refers to the month of May (''Mai'' in Modern Welsh), rendering "Hawk of May", though scholar [[Rachel Bromwich]] considers this unlikely. Kenneth Jackson suggests the name evolved from an early [[Common Brittonic]] name *''Ualcos Magesos'', meaning "Hawk of the Plain".&lt;ref name=Bromwich367/&gt;

Not all scholars accept the ''gwalch'' derivation. Celticist John Koch suggests the name could be derived from a [[Brittonic languages|Brythonic]] original ''*Wolcos Magesos'', "Wolf/Errant Warrior of the Plain."&lt;ref&gt;Koch, "The Celtic Lands," p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue that the continental forms do not ultimately derive from ''Gwalchmei''. Medievalist [[Roger Sherman Loomis]] suggests a derivation from the epithet ''Gwallt Avwyn'', found in the list of heroes in ''[[Culhwch and Olwen]]'', which he translates as "hair like reins" or "bright hair".&lt;ref&gt;Roger Sherman Loomis, ''The Grail'' (Princeton University Press, 1963), p.272&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roger Sherman Loomis, ''Celtic Myth and Arthurian Romance'' (Academy Chicago Publishers, 1997), p.63-6.&lt;/ref&gt; Dutch scholar Lauran Toorians proposes that the Dutch name Walewein (attested in [[Flanders]] and Northern France c. 1100) was earliest, suggesting it entered Britain during the large settlement of Flemings in [[Wales]] in the early 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;Toorians, Lauran, "Nogmaals 'Walewein van Melle' en de Vlaams-Keltische contacten," Queeste, 2 (1995), 97–112.&lt;/ref&gt; However, most scholarship suports a derivation from Gwalchmei, variants of which are well attested in Wales and [[Brittany]]. Scholars such as Bromwich, Joseph Loth, and Heinrich Zimmer trace the etymology of the continental versions to a corruption of the [[Breton language|Breton]] form of the name, ''Walcmoei''.&lt;ref name=Bromwich369/&gt;

==Gwalchmei==
Gwalchmei was a traditional hero of [[Welsh mythology|Welsh legend]] whose popularity greatly increased after foreign versions, particularly those derived from [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'', became known in Wales.&lt;ref name="Bromwich368"&gt;Bromwich, p. 368.&lt;/ref&gt; The early romance ''[[Culhwch and Olwen]]'' written in the 11th century and eventually associated with the ''[[Mabinogion]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Hall, p. 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt; ascribes to Gwalchmei the same relationship with [[King Arthur|Arthur]] that Gawain is later given: he is Arthur's sister's son and one of his leading warriors.&lt;ref name="Bromwich367"&gt;Bromwich, p. 367.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he is mentioned only twice in the text; once in the extensive list of Arthur's court towards the beginning of the story, and again as one of the "Six Helpers" who Arthur sends with the protagonist [[Culhwch]] on his journey to find his love [[Olwen]].&lt;ref name="Bromwich368" /&gt; Unlike the other helpers he takes no further part in the action, suggesting he was added to the romance later, likely under the influence of the Welsh versions of Geoffrey's ''Historia''.&lt;ref name="Bromwich368"/&gt;

Still, Gwalchmei was clearly a traditional figure; other early references to him include the [[Welsh Triads]]; the ''[[Englynion y Beddau]]'' (''Stanzas of the Graves''), which lists the site of his grave; the ''Trioedd y Meirch'' (''Triads of the Horses''), which praises his horse ''Keincaled'' (known as [[Gringolet]] to later French authors); and [[Cynddelw]]'s elegy for [[Owain Gwynedd]], which compares Owain's boldness to that of Gwalchmei.&lt;ref name="Bromwich367"/&gt; In the Welsh Triads, Triad 4 lists him as one of the "Three Well-Endowed Men of the Isle of Britain" (probably referring to his inheritance);&lt;ref&gt;Bromwich, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Triad 75 describes him as one of the “Three Men of the Island of Britain who were Most Courteous to Guests and Strangers”;&lt;ref&gt;S Davies, ''Mabinogion'' (Oxford 2007) p. 245&lt;/ref&gt; and Triad 91 praises his fearlessness.&lt;ref&gt;Bromwich, p. 205, 234.&lt;/ref&gt; Some versions of Triads 42 and 46 also praise his horse Keincaled, echoing the ''Triads of the Horses''.&lt;ref&gt;Bromwich, p. 111–112, 127–128.&lt;/ref&gt; A tale recorded by 16th-century Welsh scholar [[Sion Dafydd Rhys]] claims that Gwalchmai destroyed three witches by trickery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/giants_wales.html Maryjones.us], Rhys, Sion Dafydd. ''The Giants of Wales.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Gwyar'' (meaning "gore"&lt;ref&gt;Pughe, p.195&lt;/ref&gt; or "spilled blood/bloodshed"&lt;ref&gt;Rhys, p. 169&lt;/ref&gt;) in Gwalchmei ap Gwyar is likely the name of Gwalchmei's mother, rather than his father as is the standard in the Welsh Triads.&lt;ref name="Bromwich369"&gt;Bromwich, p. 369.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Matronymics|Matronyms]] were sometimes used in Wales, as in the case of [[Math fab Mathonwy]] and [[Gwydion|Gwydion fab Dôn]], and were also fairly common in early Ireland.&lt;ref name="Bromwich369"/&gt; Gwyar appears as a daughter of [[Amlawdd Wledig]] in one version of the hagiographical genealogy ''Bonedd y Saint''. Additionally, the 14th-century ''Birth of Arthur'', a Welsh text adapting scenes from Geoffrey of Monmouth, substitutes Gwyar for "Anna", Geoffrey's name for [[Morgause|Gawain's mother]].&lt;ref&gt;Bromwich, p. 369–370.&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources do not follow this substitution, however, indicating that Gwyar and Anna originated independently.&lt;ref&gt;Bromwich, p. 370.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In early literature==
A few references to Gawain appear outside Wales in the first half of the 12th century; for instance in his ''Gesta Regum Anglorum'' of around 1125, [[William of Malmesbury]] writes that "Walwen's" grave had been uncovered in [[Pembrokeshire]] during the reign of [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]]; William recounts that Arthur's formidable nephew had been driven from his kingdom by [[Hengest]]'s brother, though he continued to harry his enemies severely.&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm, James J. (1994). "Arthur in the Latin Chronicles." In James J. Wilhem, ''The Romance of Arthur'', p. 7. New York: Garland. {{ISBN|0-8153-1511-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s version of Gawain in the ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'', written around 1136, that brought the character to a wider audience.&lt;ref name=Busby&gt;Busby, p. 178–179.&lt;/ref&gt; As in the Welsh tradition, Geoffrey's Gualguanus is the son of Arthur's sister, here named Anna, and her husband is [[King Lot|Lot]], the prince of [[Lothian]] and one of Arthur's key suporters. Gualguanus is depicted as a superior warrior and potential heir to the throne until he is tragically struck down by his traitorous brother [[Modred]]'s forces.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey of Monmouth, [[s:History of the Kings of Britain|''Historia Regum Britanniae'']] Books 9–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Geoffrey's work was hugely popular, and was adapted into many languages. The [[Norman language|Norman]] version by [[Wace]], the ''[[Roman de Brut]]'', ascribes to Gawain the [[Chivalry|chivalric]] aspect he would take in later literature, wherein he favors courtliness and love over martial valor.&lt;ref name=Busby/&gt; Several later works expand on Geoffrey's mention of Gawain's boyhood spent in Rome, the most important of which is the anonymous [[Medieval Latin]] romance ''[[The Rise of Gawain, Nephew of Arthur]]'', which describes his birth, boyhood and early adventures leading up to his knighting by his uncle.&lt;ref name="Day 1994 365–366"/&gt;

==In French literature==
===Verse romances===
[[Image:Ywain-Gawain.JPG|thumb|Gawain unwittingly fights [[Ywain]], from Chrétien's ''[[Yvain, or the Knight of the Lion|Knight of the Lion]]'']]

Beginning with the five works of [[Chrétien de Troyes]], Gawain became a very popular figure in French chivalric [[Romance (heroic literature)|romances]] in the later 12th century. Chrétien uses Gawain as a major character and establishes some characteristics that pervade later depictions, including his unparalleled courteousness and his way with women. His romances set the pattern often followed in later works in which Gawain serves as an ally to the protagonist and a model of knighthood to whom others are compared. However, in Chrétien's later romances, especially ''[[Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart]]'' and ''[[Perceval, the Story of the Grail]]'', the title heroes prove morally superior to Gawain, who follows the rules of courtliness to the letter rather than the spirit.&lt;ref name=Busby/&gt;

An influx of romances written in French appeared in Chretien's wake, and in these Gawain was characterized variously. In many of these "Gawain romances", such as ''[[Le Chevalier à l'épée]]'' and ''La Vengeance Raguidel'', he is the hero; in others, he aids the hero; sometimes he is the subject of [[burlesque]] humor.&lt;ref name=Busby/&gt; In the many variants of the ''Bel Inconnu'' or [[Fair Unknown]] story, he is the father of the hero.&lt;ref&gt;Lacy, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prose cycles===
In the [[Lancelot-Grail|Vulgate Cycle]], he is depicted as a proud and worldly knight who demonstrates through his failures the danger of neglecting the spirit for the futile gifts of the material world. On the [[Holy Grail|Grail]] quest, his intentions are always the purest, but he is unable to use God's grace to see the error in his ways. Later, when his brothers [[Agravain]] and [[Mordred]] plot to destroy [[Lancelot]] and [[Guinevere]] by exposing their love affair, Gawain tries to stop them. When Guinevere is sentenced to burn at the stake and Arthur deploys his best knights to guard the execution, Gawain nobly refuses to take part in the deed even though his brothers will be there. But when Lancelot returns to rescue Guinevere, a battle between Lancelot's and Arthur's knights ensues and Gawain's brothers, except for Mordred, are killed. This turns his friendship with Lancelot into hatred, and his desire for vengeance causes him to draw Arthur into a war with Lancelot in France. In the king's absence, Mordred usurps the throne, and the Britons must return to save Britain. Gawain is mortally wounded in battle against Mordred's armies, and writes to Lancelot apologizing for his actions and asking for him to come to Britain to help defeat Mordred.

==Other medieval literatures==
=== German and Dutch===
The [[Middle Dutch]] ''Roman van Walewein'' by Penninc and Pieter Vostaert, and the [[Middle High German]] romance ''[[Diu Crône]]'' by [[Heinrich von dem Türlin]] are both dedicated primarily to Gawain. In [[Wirnt von Grafenberg]]'s Middle High German ''Wigalois'', Gawain is the father of the protagonist.

===English and Scottish===
[[Image:Gawain and the Green Knight.jpg|thumb|[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]]]For the English and [[Scottish people|Scots]], Gawain remained a respectable and heroic figure. He is the subject of several romances and lyrics in the dialects of those countries. He is the hero of one of the greatest works of [[Middle English]] literature, ''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]'', where he is portrayed as an excellent, but human, knight. In the poem, Gawain must venture to the titular Green Knight to, assumingly, be killed by the Knight. Gawain does this as it pertains to a deal made between the two without knowing that it is all a test by the Knight.&lt;ref&gt;"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight." From the Norton Anthology of English Literature, edited by Julie Reidhead lines 2331-2365 &lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Wedding of Sir Gawain and Dame Ragnelle]]'', his wits, virtue and respect for women frees his wife, a [[loathly lady]], from her curse of ugliness. Other important English Gawain romances include ''[[The Awntyrs off Arthure]]'' (''The Adventures of Arthur'') and ''The Avowyng of Arthur''.

These glowing portraits of Gawain all but ended with Sir [[Thomas Malory]]'s ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'', which is based mainly, but not exclusively, on French works from the Vulgate and [[Post-Vulgate Cycle|Post-Vulgate]] Cycles. Here Gawain partly retains the negative characteristics attributed to him by the later French, and partly retains his earlier positive representations, creating a character seen by some as inconsistent, and by others as a believably flawed hero. Gawain is cited in [[Robert Laneham]]'s letter describing the entertainments at Kenilworth in 1575,&lt;ref&gt;Performance artist Captain Cox is described as "hardy as Gawin," and knows the Arthurian romances including "Syr Gawain"&lt;/ref&gt; and the recopying of earlier works such as ''[[The Greene Knight]]'' suggests that a popular tradition of Gawain continued. The [[Child Ballads]] include a preserved legend in the positive light, ''[[The Marriage of Sir Gawain]]'', a fragmentary version of the story of ''The Wedding of Sir Gawain and Dame Ragnelle''. He also appears in the rescue of Guinevere and plays a significant role though Lancelot overshadows him. In Sir Thomas Malory's ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'', Guinevere is found guilty, however Lancelot returns to help Guinevere to escappe from the castle. But Mordred has sent word to King Arthur; Arthur sends a few knights to capture Lancelot, and Gawain, being a loyal friend to Lancelot, refuses to take part in the mission. The battle between Lancelot and Arthur's knights results in Gawain's two sons and his brothers, except for Mordred, being slain. This begins the estrangement between Lancelot and Gawain, thus drawing Arthur into a war with Lancelot in France. When King Arthur deploys to France, Mordred seizes the throne, and takes control of the kingdom. Gawain wages two wars with Mordred and Lancelot. He is mortally wounded in a duel against Lancelot who later lies for two nights weeping at Gawain's tomb. Before his death, Gawain repents of his bitterness towards Lancelot and forgives him, while asking him to join forces with Arthur and save [[Camelot]].&lt;ref name="C. Norris 2008 200"/&gt;

==Character==
Sir Gawain in particular of all Arthur's knights is known for his courteousness and compassion. In "Gawain: His Reputation, His Courtesy and His appearance in Chaucer’s Squire’s Tale," B.J. Whiting collected quantitative evidence of this quality being stronger in Gawain than in any of the other [[knights of the Round Table]], noting the words "courteous", "courtesy" and "courteously" being used in reference to Arthur's nephew 178 times in total, which is greater than the tally for all other knights in Arthurian literature.&lt;ref name="Whiting, p. 218"/&gt; The [[Welsh Triads]] singled him out as Most Courteous, something confirmed by his role in the ''[[Mabinogion]]'' romances where he regularly serves as an intermediary between stranger knights and Arthur’s Court.&lt;ref&gt;S Davies trans., ''Mabinogion'' (Oxford 2007) p. 245&lt;/ref&gt; In many romances, he is depicted as a model for this chivalric attribute.&lt;ref name="Harper, p. 2"&gt;Harper, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'', for example, where he is described as “this fine father of breeding”,&lt;ref&gt;J R R Tolkien trans, ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'' (London 1995) p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; Gawain receives the kisses of [[Lady Bertilak]] with discretion, at once not wanting to insult her by refusing her advances and not wanting to betray the hospitality of her husband.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;span class="plainlinks&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gV84AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA295&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The story of King Arthur and his knights]&lt;/span&gt; Retrieved 7 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same poem, Gawain's person is also said to be founded in a deep Christian belief in Christ and the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]].&lt;ref&gt;"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight." Translated by Simon Armitage. ''The Norton Anthology of English Literature''. Edited by Julie Reidhead. New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc., 2012. Lines 642-647. &lt;/ref&gt;

==The loves of Sir Gawain==
[[Image:Arthur-Pyle Sir Gawaine finds the beautiful Lady.JPG|thumb|upright|''Sir Gawaine finds the beautiful Lady'', by Howard Pyle from ''The Story of King Arthur and His Knights'' (1903)]]

Scholar M. Gaston Paris draws attention to the phenomenon that, since Gawain is known in multiple tales as "the Maidens' Knight", his name is thus attached to no woman in particular. He is the champion of all women, and through this reputation, he has avoided the name pairing seen in tales of Eric and Lancelot (the former being inextricably linked with Enide, the latter with Guinevere). He has, however, been connected to more than one woman in the course of Arthurian literature.&lt;ref&gt;Weston, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; In the alliterative Middle-English poem ''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]'', Sir Bertilak's wife flirts with him. In the aforementioned ''[[The Wedding of Sir Gawain and Dame Ragnelle]]'', he marries the cursed Ragnelle, and in giving her "sovereignty" in the relationship, lifts the spell laid upon her that had given her a hag-like appearance.&lt;ref name="Lupack, p. 314"&gt;Lupack, p. 314&lt;/ref&gt; He is also associated with a vague supernatural figure in various tales. The hero of Le Bel Inconnu is the progeny of Gawain and a fairy called Blancemal, and in the Marvels of Rigomer, Gawain is rescued by the fay Lorie.&lt;ref name="Harper, p. 2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weston, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; In the German tale ''Wizalois'', the mother of his son is known as Florie, who is likely another version of the Lorie of Rigomer. In her earliest incarnations, Gawain's love is either the princess or queen of the [[Otherworld]].&lt;ref name="Weston, p. 52"&gt;Weston, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'', based on the bargain to give each other their respective daily gains, Gawain must give the kisses he receives from Lady Bertilak to Sir Bertilak. This allusion serves to reinforce chivalric ideals of religious, martial and courtly love codes, especially in masculine warrior culture, and shows the ways in which the masculine world can be subverted by female wiles.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, David L. "Sodomy, Misogyny, and Displacement: Occluding Queer Desire in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight". "Arthuriana". (Summer 1998) 8.2 p.&amp;nbsp;77–113&lt;/ref&gt; This undertone of homoeroticism between Gawain and Bertilak underscores the strength of male homosocial bonds, and the fact that sex never occurs reinforces ideals of the masculine chivalric code.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Fisher|first=Sheila|author2=Janet E. Halley |title=Seeking the Women in Late Medieval and Renaissance Writings: Essays in Feminist Contextual Criticism|publisher=U of Tennessee P|location=Knoxville|year=1989|pages=277|isbn=0-870-495917}}&lt;!--|accessdate=18 November 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern literature and media==
Gawain features frequently in modern literature and media. Modern English depictions of him are heavily influenced by Malory, though characterizations are inconsistent. [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Alfred Tennyson]] adapts episodes from Malory to present Gawain as a worldly and faithless knight in his ''[[Idylls of the King]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor &amp; Brewer, p. 107–108.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/tennyson/idylls/iotk4.html |title= Faithless Gawain |author= George P. Landow |date= 30 November 2004 |work= victorianweb.com|publisher= |accessdate=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whiting, p. 193–194&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[T. H. White]]'s novel ''[[The Once and Future King]]'' follows Malory, but presents Gawain as more churlish than Malory's torn and tragic portrayal.&lt;ref&gt;Blanch &amp; Wasserman, p. 186, 187.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, [[Thomas Berger (novelist)|Thomas Berger]]'s ''[[Arthur Rex]]'' portrays Gawaine as open-minded and introspective about his flaws, qualities that make him the [[Round Table]]'s greatest knight.&lt;ref&gt;Dentzien, p. 219–221.&lt;/ref&gt; Though he usually plays a suporting role, some works feature Gawain as the main character. [[Vera Chapman]]'s ''The Green Knight'' and Anne Crompton's ''Gawain and Lady Green'' offer modern retellings of ''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Mediavilla, p. 65–67.&lt;/ref&gt; Gwalchmai is the protagonist in [[Gillian Bradshaw]]'s Celtic-tinged ''[[Hawk of May]]'' and its sequels.&lt;ref&gt;Mediavilla, p. 64–65.&lt;/ref&gt; An aged Gawain is one of the central characters in [[Kazuo Ishiguro]]'s novel ''[[The Buried Giant]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Kakutani |first= Michiko |date= 23 February 2015 |title= Review: In ‘The Buried Giant,’ Ishiguro Revisits Memory and Denial |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/24/books/review-in-the-buried-giant-ishiguro-revisits-memory-and-denial.html?_r=0 |newspaper= [[The New York Times]] |location= |access-date= 6 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Film portrayals of Gawain, and the Arthurian legend in general, are heavily indebted to Malory; White's ''The Once and Future King'' also exerts a heavy influence. Gawain appears as a suporting character in films such as ''[[Knights of the Round Table (film)|Knights of the Round Table]]'' (1953), ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'' (1975) and ''[[Excalibur (film)|Excalibur]]'' (1981), all of which draw on elements of his traditional characterizations.&lt;ref&gt;Blanch &amp; Wasserman, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; Other films give Gawain a larger role. In the 1954 adaptation of ''[[Prince Valiant (1954 film)|Prince Valiant]]'', he is a somewhat boorish, though noble and good-natured, foil for his squire and friend, [[Prince Valiant|Valiant]].&lt;ref&gt;Blanch &amp; Wasserman, p. 187–188.&lt;/ref&gt; He plays his traditional part in the 1963 film ''[[Sword of Lancelot]]'', seeking revenge when Lancelot kills his unarmed brother Gareth, but ultimately coming to Lancelot's aid when he uncovers Mordred's responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p. 386.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'' has been adapted several times, including 1973's ''[[Gawain and the Green Knight (1973 film)|Gawain and the Green Knight]]'' and 1984's ''[[Sword of the Valiant]]'', both directed by Stephen Weeks. Neither film was well reviewed and both deviate substantially from the source material.&lt;ref&gt;Blanch &amp; Wasserman, p. 190–191&lt;/ref&gt; A 1991 television adaptation by [[Thames Television]], ''Gawain and the Green Knight'', was both more faithful and better received.&lt;ref&gt;Blanch &amp; Wasserman, p. 191–193.&lt;/ref&gt;

The character has appeared in a number of stage productions and operas, mostly interpretations of ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight''. Particularly notable among them is the 1991 opera ''[[Gawain (opera)|Gawain]]'' with music by [[Harrison Birtwistle]] and a libretto by [[David Harsent]].&lt;ref&gt;Windeatt, p. 373–383.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2008 BBC television series ''[[Merlin (2008 TV series)|Merlin]]'', Gawain appears as Sir Gwaine, played by [[Eoin Macken]]. Though of noble origin, he passes himself as a peasant due to his mother's mistreatment by the king his father served. He's finally knighted by Arthur due to his personal value. In the short-lived 2011 series ''[[Camelot (TV series)|Camelot]]'', he was played by [[Clive Standen]]. In the 2017 television series ''[[Knightfall (TV series)|Knightfall]]'', Sir Gawain is portrayed as one of the leading figures of the [[Knights Templar]] in France.

Gawain also appears in video games, including as the protagonist of ''[[Chronicles of the Sword]]''. He is voiced by [[Takahiro Mizushima]] in ''[[Fate/EXTRA]]'' and its sequel ''Fate/EXTRA CCC'', as well as in ''[[Fate/Grand Order]]''. In [[Sonic and the Black Knight|''Sonic and the Black Knigh''t]] (2009), Sir Gawain is one of the main characters, based on [[Knuckles the Echidna]].

'''George F. Vande Woude''' is a scientist and former director at [[Van Andel Institute|Van Andel Research Institute]] in Michigan studying [[breast cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/onc/journal/v26/n9/full/1210257a.html|title=Cancer: biology and therapeutics – A tribute to George Vande Woude|first1=N S|last1=Duesbery|first2=B T|last2=Teh|date=1 February 2007|publisher=|journal=Oncogene|volume=26|issue=9|pages=1258–1259|doi=10.1038/sj.onc.1210257}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
George Vande Woude was born on December 25, 1935 in New York City to George and Alice (Leudesdorff) Vande Woude.  He was married to the former Dorothy Stapel for over 57 years until her death in 2016.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

== Education ==
Vande Woude graduated from [[Rutgers University]] with an MS and PhD in 1962 and 1964, respectively. While at Rutgers, he trained with Dr. Frank F. Davis. He was a postdoctoral fellow at the [[USDA]] [[Plum Island Animal Disease Center]] from 1964 to 1972.

== Career ==
He joined the [[National Cancer Institute]] in 1972 and was a member for 28 years.

In 1983, he took the lead at NCI's [[Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research]] for 15 years. He was Director of Basic Sciences at NCI when he was recruited to lead the new VARI.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://academic.oup.com/jnci/article/93/11/803/2906137|title=Van Andel Institute Brings Cancer Research to the Heartland|first=Ken|last=Garber|date=6 June 2001|publisher=|journal=JNCI Journal of the National Cancer Institute|volume=93|issue=11|pages=803–804|via=jnci.oxfordjournals.org|doi=10.1093/jnci/93.11.803}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, he became the first director of Van Andel Research Institute and served until 2009. He is currently a Fellow at VARI.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bcrfcure.org/researchers/george-f-vande-woude&lt;/ref&gt; He recruited several young scientists to VARI who have developed successful careers, including Bart Williams from the NCI laboratory of former National Institutes of Health director [[Harold Varmus]], Cindy Miranti from the Harvard laboratory of [[Joan Brugge]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In 1984, Vande Woude discovered the oncogene [[c-Met|MET]], which is mutated in many cancers, and characterized it as a [[receptor tyrosine kinase]]. MET is now the target of many cancer drugs in development. His laboratory also discovered the MOS oncogene. In total, he has been a co-author on 297 PubMed referenced publications during his career.

The oral history of the [[Iban people|Iban]] has traditionally been committed to memory, and recorded in a system of writing on boards (''papan turai'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com.my/#hl=en&amp;tbo=p&amp;tbs=bks%3A1&amp;q=turai+iban+writing&amp;meta=&amp;aq=&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=turai+iban+writting&amp;gs_rfai=&amp;fp=6f2748940f370183 google book search. (No preview available.)]&lt;/ref&gt; by the initiated [[shamans]], or [[lemambang]]. This includes elaborate [[genealogy|genealogical records]], which usually go back about fifteen generations, although some purport to go back up to twenty-five. These genealogies (''[[tusut]]s'') are essentially records of who married and begat whom. Sometimes a name is accompanied by a short description, a praise-name (ensumbar).

Some of the songs of the Iban people's oral history (such as the ritual ''[[pengap]]'' chant, sung during festivals) are mythological or historical accounts.

==Pre-colonisation==

According to oral histories, the Iban arrived in western [[Sarawak]] from [[Indonesia]] about 1675. After an initial phase of colonising and settling the river valleys, displacing or absorbing the local populations of [[Bukitan]]s and [[Serus]], there began a period of [[total war]].

Local leaders were forced to resist the tax collectors of the [[Brunei Malay|Malay]] [[sultan]]s ([[Brunei]]).

At the same time, the Iban started to be culturally influenced by the Malay, and Iban leaders begin to be known by Malay titles such as ''[[Orang Kaya]]'' and Panglima. Several of the Malays active on the river-estuaries, such as [[Indra Lela]], [[Sharif Japar]] and [[Sharif Sahap]], claimed to be descendants of the prophet. [[Sharif Ahmit]] was killed by the Iban.

The [[Bajau]] and [[Illanun]], arrived from the [[Philippines]] in [[galley]]s plundered in [[Borneo]], and were fought by the Iban. Oral tradition recounts such a fight by Unggang "Lebor Menoa" from [[Entanak]] near modern [[Betong, Malaysia|Betong]].

According to tradition, Unggang or Sunggang "Lebor Menoa" encountered [[Chinese people|Chinese]] traders who came in ships to the [[Saribas]] in order to sell cooking pots, brass pots, pottery bowls, shell [[armlet]]s and [[cowry shell]]s for [[Rice#Harvesting.2C drying and milling|padi]].

During that time, the Ibans were also engaged in conflict with the [[Orang Ulu]] of northern [[Sarawak]], the [[Bidayuh]] of southern Sarawak, the [[Kantu]] and other Indonesian ethnic tribes from eastern Sarawak; the Iban successfully controlled the western coastline of Sarawak.

The start of enmity between Sebuyau, Balau and Undup Ibans against Saribas and Skrang Ibans.

The Malay leader [[Indra Lela]], brother of [[Lela Wangsa]] of [[Lingga, Malaysia|Lingga]] and [[Lela Pelawan]], incited the [[Saribas]] and [[Skrang]] Ibans to war against the [[Sebuyau Dayaks]] in order to control them as stated below:

Undoubtedly the Malays did encourage Iban warfare, among Ibans themselves (Indra Lela) and against Malay-ruled peoples who evaded contribution.&lt;ref&gt;http://gnmawar.wordpress.com/jerita-lama/iban-migration-peturun-iban/iban-agressive-expansion-stephanie-morgan/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Saribas were led by Orang Kaya Pemancha [[Dana "Bayang"]] of Padeh, in alliance with [[Linggir "Mali Lebu"]] who was the son of Uyut "Bedilang Besi" of Paku, Bunyau Apai Bakir of Entanak and [[Unal "Bulan"]] of Ulu Layar.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/ufloor/history2.html&amp;date=2009-10-25+23:26:39&lt;/ref&gt;

The Skrang were led by [[Libau "Rentap"]], Orang Kaya [[Gasing]] and Orang Kaya [[Rabong]]. Rentap was later conferred the title of Raja Ulu (Upriver King) by his followers while fighting Rajah Brooke at Mount Sadok and was famous for his battle cry of "AGI IDUP AGI NGELABAN" meaning "STILL ALIVE, STILL FIGHTING".

The Sebuyau Dayaks were led by their chief Ngelambong and later his son Temenggong [[Jugah]] of Lundu.

The outbreak of intratribal warfare coincided roughly with the beginnings of friction with Brunei and contacts with the Illanuns and other sea raiders. But even prior to this there had been fighting on several occasions, one of which is the story of Beti (Brauh Ngumbang) of Skrang and his quarrel with the Sebuyau warrior named Chagik who had unsuccessfully courted Riti who became Beti's seventh wife.

Two more occasions after this but still long before the intra-tribal wars, men from the Saribas who had become involved in quarrels in their own home rivers fled to the Sebuyau settlements. They subsequently involved the Sebuyau people in the dispute with the Saribas Ibans.

The first occasion was between two friends by the name of Brayun versus Janang over a lady known as Bremas, in the Ulu Samu during the chieftain of Seeing the son of Tuah. Brayun slashed one of Janang's ears who then fled to Sebuyau and returned with some Sebuyau people to attack Brayun's house.

Another incident of the Saribas-Sebuyau hostility took place as a result of a quarrel over a tapang tree which is a source of honey at a small Bangkit stream which lies between the Paku and Rimbas rivers in Saribas. There were two longhouses here, one under the leadership of Anal and Sana and the other under Senabong who claimed ownership of the same tapang tree.

Both sides agreed to settle the dispute over a diving (kelam ai) contest which Sana and Anal said that Senabong lost but he disagreed. Senabong people migrated to Telong Semerang from which they first sent a war party back to their old home to fight against Sana and Anal.

After they had migrated to Sebuyau, Senabong’s men again raided Bangkit but this time with the assistance of the Sebuyau people. By now Sana and Anal were so worried by these attacks that they humbly invited Gerijih (Ai Marang) of Paku to come and live with them in Bangkit. After many more adventures, Gerijih finally defeated Senabong and took his head.

Further clash between the Sebuyau and the people of Saribas took place in the time of Luta who was the son of Unggang (Lebur Menua) of Entanak. According to Saribas oral history, the Sebuyau Dayaks themselves murdered Luta’s brother named Ngadan. It should be remembered that more Sebuyau Dayaks lived at other areas in Sarawak including Lundu and Samarahan.

In retaliation for this incident, Luta led the Saribas people to raid Sebuyau where he killed many of the enemies. After the missing of Luta and his brothers Mulok and Ketit in search of the valuable tuchong shell armlet off Cape Datu, the leadership in the Saribas was passed from his family at Entanak to that of Orang Kaya Pemancha Dana (Bayang) of the Padeh tributary.

While chief Nyanggau and his followers living in his longhouse at Lemas in the Undup river, they were attacked and defeated by Indra Lela and his forces from the Skrang. Due to this defeat, Nyanggau and his people fled away to settle at Dau, in Indonesian Borneo.

About 1834, the Skrang led by Orang Kaya Rabong made a raid on [[Banting Hill]], which was inhabited by Balau Dayaks and Malays, who suffered heavy losses. Before the fight, one Balau shaman (medicine man) by the name of Manang Langgong announced loudly that Indra Lela was the instigator for the quarrel between them as follows:

“Why are we fighting? We have no quarrel with each other. It is all the fault of Indra Lela who has been playing a double game!” shouted Langgong.

When Indra Lela heard this, he jumped into the Lingga River to escape being beheaded by the Dayaks. According to a story, he turned into a crocodile, which for years afterwards caught unwary people swimming and bathing in the region.

However, despite this, the battle continued and the Banting Malays and Balau Dayaks were badly defeated. It was during this attack that Chulo (Tarang) a leading warrior of Linggir (Mali Lebu) made his praise-name or ensumbar "Tarang".

Three years later in 1837, Orang Kaya Pemancha Dana made war on the [[Undup]] Ibans who had killed his brother Angkum and utterly defeated them, taking many captives and looting a famous [[guchi jar]] that was thought to have magical properties. This war was famously called "Bala Besai" (Great Force) because all people from Skrang and Saribas joined the war or "Ngayau Lus" (Extinct War) because the great force attacked not only one longhouse but all longhouses in the Undup to finish them off.

The surviving Undup Ibans took refuge in the [[Kapuas valley]] and [[Lingga, Malaysia|Lingga]] and later settled in the area of [[Salimbau]]. Only under the rule of Brooke did they return to Banting hill, which had meanwhile been settled by the Skrang.

In retaliation, the Sebuyau Sea Dayaks under Orang Kaya Temenggong [[Jugah Anak Ngelambong]] of Lundu attacked Paku on the Saribas at about the time. He attacked Adir's longhouse at Matop but most inhabitants had fled earlier.

Ca. 1838, the Balau Sea Dayaks raided the [[Saribas]] and Kalaka ([[Krian]]) which is a place east of the Saribas under the leadership of Ijau "Lang" and his son-in-law Orang Kaya Janting to avenge their previous losses at Banting and revenge for their disturbed peace and harmonious lives. However, Ijau "Lang" was defeated by Unal "Bulan" at the Plassan stream in Saribas while Janting defeated the large longhouse of Orang Kaya Temenggong Tandok at the Melupa stream in Kalaka.

Early in 1839 in revenge for the defeat of his father-in-law Ijau "Lang", Janting and all his bravest warriors of Banting set out to fight the Saribas. They had decided to attack both the Paku and Rimbas tributaries in the Saribas. The combined Rimbas and Paku defenders agreed to fight the attackers in the Rimbas tributary at Nanga Undai stream on the night of the next full moon.

However, the Rimbas force came earlier than the Paku force but later than the Balau force who attacked them and capsized their smaller boats straightaway. Many of the Rimbas Ibans were killed including the sons of Orang Kaya Antau and Gun who had come with the war party.

The battles mentioned above were all between various groups of Ibans who lived at the mouths of different rivers. This intermittent struggle continued after 1839. It was because of these that the newly arrived James Brooke found that he could easily get the support of the Sebuyau, Undup and Balau Dayaks in his warfare against the Saribas and Skrang and later on against the Kanowit and Ulu Rajang.&lt;ref&gt;http://hornbill.cdc.net.my/yzm/Iban%20Migration%20into%20Sarawak.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, Brooke was not colonizing or ruling on behalf of the [[British Empire]]; he ruled Sarawak as an [[absolute monarch]], unconnected to any imperial power.&lt;ref name=conscious /&gt; After defeating the rebellion led by Datu Patinggi Ali in Kuching (then Sarawak proper), James Brooke was appointed the Rajah of Sarawak. His second biggest battle was against the Iban of Saribas and Skrang region led by Linggi "Mali Lebu" at the battle of Beting Maru. After this, James Brooke tried to sign the Saribas Peace Treaty with Orang Kaya Pemancha Dana "Bayang".

[[Charles Brooke, Rajah of Sarawak|Charles Brooke]], the second rajah, was committed to ending purported [[headhunting]] and [[piracy]] on the part of the Iban, and made numerous attempts to quell such activities with military force which is mostly made of local inhabitants who were exempted from paying local door taxes and could take any heads and other valuable items like jars and brassware. This often led to organized resistance by the Iban.&lt;ref name=conscious /&gt; In one instance, the Iban leader Libau ([[Rentap]]) resisted Brooke from his fortress on [[Mount Sadok]] and only defeated after 3 successive punitive expeditions. The Ibans of Lingga, the Undup Ibans and the Sebuyau fought for Brooke. After Balang "Balai Nyabung" was executed by the Brooke government, his brother Enjop led a rebellion in the Katibas region which was quelled after 3 punitive expeditions. Bantin "Ijau Lelayang was another rebel leader along with Pengulu Ngumbang "Berauh Langit" in the upper Batang Ai. Lintong "Mua Ari" of Kanowit, Kana of Engkari and Kedu "Lang Ngindang" also once rebelled against the Brooke government. Thereafter, the Iban became vital allies of the Brooke dynasty, with the defeat of both Rentap and later the last rebel leader [[Asun]].

Vyner Brooke was the third rajah of Sarawak. He had to quell rebellions by Tabur, Pengulu Merum and Asun of Entabai. He ceded Sarak to the British government after the second World War after winning a mojority vote in the Sarawak State Assembly and local resistance of the secession idea. However, Sir Edward Ardell who was the British governor in Sarawak gave independence to Sarawak on 22 July 1963. Soon Sarawak formed the Federation of Malaysia with Sabah, Malaya and Singapore (which ceded later).

Warfare between Dayak peoples continued to be an intermittent problem for the regime until the [[Great Peacemaking]] in [[Kapit]] in 1924, when the Rajah [[Charles Vyner Brooke|Vyner]] also consolidated the support of the Iban by appointing one of their great war heroes [[Koh Anak Jubang]] (1870–1956) to the position of ''Temenggong'' or paramount chief. Koh became a member of the advisory council of the state, the [[Council Negri]], and converted to Christianity in 1949. He was awarded the [[Queen's Medal for Chiefs]] and the [[Order of the British Empire]].

==World War II==

During the Japanese occupation of Sarawak from 1942-5 the Iban also played a role in guerilla warfare against the occupying forces, particularly in the Kapit Division where [[headhunting]] was temporarily revived towards the end of the war.

At this time Sarawak came under the temporary military administration of the Australian forces, who were particularly prominent in the liberation of Borneo.

Sarawak got its own independence from the British on 22 July 1963 while Sabah got its independence on 31 August 1963.

On 16 September 1963, the Federation of Malaysia was formed between the Federation of Malaya at that time, Sabah (North Borneo), Sarawak and Singapore.

Brunei refused to join the formation of Malaysia and got its independence in 1984 from the British.

The Cobbold Commission which surveyed Sarawakians about the formation of Malaysia reported a third favours its formation while another third was against it and the remaining third did not form any opinion.

Singapore was expelled later on to be independent until today.

Canadian singer and songwriter [[Justin Bieber]] has been featured in thirty-three [[music videos]], has made cameo appearances in two [[films]] and has appeared in several [[television series]]. For his debut extended play ''[[My World (EP)|My World]]'' (2009), Bieber released music videos for the singles "[[One Time (Justin Bieber song)|One Time]]", "[[One Less Lonely Girl]]", and "[[Love Me (Justin song)|Love Me]]". In the first two, Bieber plays a young man trying to show his affection for a young girl. Disappointed at the outcome at the end of the "One Time" video, he gets a date at the end of the video for "One Less Lonely Girl". The "Love Me" music video is a compilation of footage from concerts, backstage and studio films.

Bieber released his debut studio album, considered the second part of ''My World'' (2010's ''[[My World 2.0]]''), with the music video for the single "[[Baby (Justin Bieber song)|Baby]]" featuring [[Ludacris]] (the second video with one billion views on YouTube&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/YouTube/status/440985057876918272|title="Baby" propelled to its billionth view on YouTube|publisher=YouTube Twitter|accessdate=July 29, 2015|date=March 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the fifteenth-most-viewed video on the site, with over 1.86 billion views,currently). The video has more "dislikes" than "likes"; as of March 2018, it has 8.61 million likes and 8.84 million dislikes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kffacxfA7G4 |title=Justin Bieber - Baby ft. Ludacris |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both albums were featured in Bieber's first concert film, ''[[Justin Bieber: Never Say Never]]'', the highest-grossing concert film in the United States since 1984&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/genres/chart/?id=musicconcert.htm |title=Music Concert Movies at the Box Office |publisher=Box Office Mojo |date= |accessdate=2013-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the third-highest-grossing documentary since 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/genres/chart/?id=documentary.htm |title=Documentary Movies at the Box Office |publisher=Box Office Mojo |date= |accessdate=2013-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bieber's second studio album and first [[Christmas music|Christmas album]], ''[[Under the Mistletoe]]'' (2011), included music videos for "[[Mistletoe (Justin Bieber song)|Mistletoe]]", "Santa Claus Is Coming to Town", "[[All I Want for Christmas Is You|All I Want for Christmas Is You (SuperFestive!)]]" and "Fa La La"; the latter two featured [[Mariah Carey]] and [[Boyz II Men]], respectively.

In 2012 Bieber released his third studio album, ''[[Believe (Justin Bieber album)|Believe]]''. The music video for "[[Boyfriend (Justin Bieber song)|Boyfriend]]", the album's lead single, features a more-mature Bieber with a new style. It set a VEVO record for the most views in a 24-hour period, with eight million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1684600/justin-bieber-boyfriend-video-youtube.jhtml|title=Justin Bieber's 'Boyfriend' Video Breaks YouTube Record|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|date=May 7, 2012|accessdate=May 15, 2012|publisher=MTV. MTV Networks}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album was featured in Bieber's second concert film, ''[[Justin Bieber's Believe]]'', which was less successful than his first.

Three years later Bieber's fourth studio album, ''[[Purpose (Justin Bieber album)|Purpose]]'', was released. The music video for the single, "[[Where Are Ü Now]]" with [[Jack Ü]], received four nominations at the [[2015 MTV Video Music Awards]] and won the [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]] award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Huerta|first1=Heidi|title=2015 MTV VMAs: See The Full Winners List - MTV - MTV.com|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2255513/2015-mtv-vmas-winners-list/|accessdate=April 21, 2016|work=MTV News|date=August 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 and 2008, Griffin won [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s for her reality show ''[[Kathy Griffin: My Life on the D-List]]''. She has also appeared on TV and on film numerous times, mainly in supporting roles.

Born in [[Oak Park, Illinois]], she moved to Los Angeles in 1978, where she studied drama at the [[Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute]] and became a member of the improvisational comedy troupe [[The Groundlings]]. In the 1990s, Griffin began performing as a stand-up comedian and also appeared as a guest star on several television shows. She achieved wider recognition after her role as a supporting character in the [[NBC]] sitcom ''[[Suddenly Susan]]'' (1996–2000).

Her Bravo reality show ''[[Kathy Griffin: My Life on the D-List]]'' (2005–2010) became a ratings hit for the network and earned her two [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Reality Program|Emmy Awards for Outstanding Reality Program]]. Griffin has released six comedy albums, all of which received [[Grammy Award]] nominations. Her first album, ''[[For Your Consideration (album)|For Your Consideration]]'' (2008), made her the first female comedian to debut at the top of the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Comedy Albums|Top Comedy Albums]] chart. In 2009, she released her autobiography, ''Official Book Club Selection: A Memoir According to Kathy Griffin''.

Griffin has taped numerous standup comedy specials with [[HBO]] and [[Bravo (U.S. TV network)|Bravo]]. For the latter network, she has recorded 16 television specials, breaking the [[Guinness World Records|Guinness World record]] for the number of aired TV specials on any network, by any comedian in the history of comedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.okmagazine.com/news/get-sneak-peek-kathy-griffins-love-justin-bieber-her-new-bravo-special|title=Get a Sneak Peek Of Kathy Griffin's Love For Justin Bieber in Her New Bravo Special!|first=Palmieri|last=Lea|work=[[OK! magazine]]|publisher=[[Northern &amp; Shell]]|date=June 3, 2013|access-date=June 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Janela|first1=Mike|title=Kathy Griffin to be honored with record in, well, "Record Breaker" special|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2013/12/kathy-griffin-to-be-honored-with-record-in-well-record-breaker-special-53801|publisher=Guinness World Records| accessdate=January 3, 2016|date=December 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Kathleen Mary Griffin was born on November 4, 1960, in the Chicago suburb of [[Oak Park, Illinois]],&lt;ref name=biography.com&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/kathy-griffin-21230365#suddenly-susan|title=Kathy Griffin biography|publisher=Biography.com|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; to Mary Margaret "Maggie" Griffin (née Corbally) and John Patrick Griffin, both first-generation Irish-Americans.&lt;ref name="griffin1"&gt;{{harvnb|Griffin|2010|pp=7–9, 11, 13, 15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maggie Griffin worked as a cashier for Oak Park Hospital. Griffin has four older siblings: Kenny, Joyce (died 2017), Gary (died 2014), and John. Griffin described herself during her early years as "a kid who needed to talk, all the time".&lt;ref name="griffin1"/&gt; Her brother Gary and her sister Joyce both died from cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.com/celebrity/kathy-griffins-brother-gary-griffin-dies-of-cancer/|title=Kathy Griffin's 'Hero' Brother Dies of Cancer|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She would often visit her neighbors, the Bowens, to tell them stories about her family; she has referred to those visits as her first live shows and the place where she learned "the power of juicy material".&lt;ref name="griffin1"/&gt; After most of her siblings had moved, Griffin often spent hours alone in the house and developed a [[binge eating disorder]]. She explained that even though [[eating disorder]]s were not very well known at that time, she knew her eating behavior was aberrant and always threw the garbage away in the neighbor's can.&lt;ref name="griffin2"&gt;{{harvnb|Griffin|2010|pp=20–21, 26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her 2009 autobiography ''Official Book Club Selection'', Griffin confessed that she "still suffers [from food issues]" but has learned to "deal with them".&lt;ref name="griffin2"/&gt;

In the same book, Griffin discussed her eldest brother, Kenny, who was a drug addict and homeless at various times, and revealed that she was "afraid of him until the moment he died" due to his violent, abusive nature. Griffin states that Kenny would climb into bed with her when he was 30 and she was 7 and "whisper" into her ears; Kathy refused to speak to him or be in the same room as him for years but did not tell her parents until she was in her twenties, at which point he openly admitted pedophilia to their parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|cyFHWt3TcTc|Kathy Griffin on Tyra - Part 2/5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a young girl, Griffin attended St. Bernadine's Elementary School and began to develop a dislike for organized religion because of the punishments she and other "vulnerable" students received from the nuns.&lt;ref name="griffin2"/&gt;

After graduation, she attended [[Oak Park and River Forest High School]] and sought refuge in musical theatre, playing roles such as Rosemary in ''[[How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying]]'' and Hodel in ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]''.&lt;ref name="griffin3"&gt;{{harvnb|Griffin|2010|pp=32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her senior year she began arguing with her parents, who wanted her to attend college, because she wanted to become a professional actress. Her first appearance on television was as an extra on a [[Chicago White Sox]] commercial, and she was signed with several Chicago talent agencies. At 18, Griffin persuaded her parents to move to Los Angeles to help her become famous.&lt;ref name="griffin3"/&gt;

At 19, Griffin attended a show of the California-based improvisational group [[The Groundlings]]. She said, "I thought this is where I want to be. This is the greatest thing in the world."&lt;ref name="griffin4"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Griffin|2010|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Stand-up comedy, TV, and film===
Griffin began performing in the early 1980s in the Los Angeles [[Improvisational theatre#Improvisational comedy|improv comedy]] troupe [[The Groundlings]].&lt;ref name="groundlingsalumnikathygriffin"&gt;{{cite web|title=Performers: KATHY GRIFFIN: Alumni|url=http://www.groundlings.com/performers/performer-details.aspx?performerID=149|website=The Goundlings| access-date=February 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an ''[[E! True Hollywood Story]]'' segment, she stated that she often went to see the Groundlings perform before she joined. She said that, at one show, she went backstage and talked with Groundling member [[Phil Hartman]] and asked him what the group was all about. This led to her taking classes there and eventually being asked into the Groundling's main company. While Kathy was a Groundling, she became best friends with [[Judy Toll]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

She went on to perform standup comedy and became part of the [[alternative comedy]] scene in Los Angeles. She appeared at [[Un-Cabaret]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} and ran her own standup night, Hot Cup of Talk, with [[Janeane Garofalo]]. That later became the title of her 1998 solo [[HBO]] special.&lt;ref name="Chat"&gt;{{cite news|title=Fast Chat: Q &amp; A with Kathy Griffin|work=Newsday|first=Frank|last=Lovece|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/186583331/Newsday-Fast-Chat-Kathy-Griffinl|date=June 18, 2006|access-date=November 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Griffin made an appearance in [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s 1994 film ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'' as a pedestrian coming to the aid of Marcellus Wallace ([[Ving Rhames]]) after he is hit by a car driven by Butch Coolidge ([[Bruce Willis]]). In the credits she was listed as herself. She broke into film in the supporting role of Connie in the [[horror film]] ''[[The Unborn (1991 film)|The Unborn]]''.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Griffin gradually amassed a number of TV and film credits throughout the 1990s. She appeared in fellow comedian [[Julie Brown]]'s ''[[Medusa: Dare to Be Truthful]]'', a [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] parody of the 1991 [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] film ''[[Madonna: Truth or Dare|Truth or Dare]]''. Griffin had two appearances as the character Susan Klein, a reporter, on [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]'', her TV sitcom debut.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

She appeared in fellow comic [[Bobcat Goldthwait]]'s film ''[[Shakes the Clown]]'' and as the enthusiastic leader of a fanatical car club in the ''[[Ellen (TV series)|Ellen]]'' episode "Oh, Sweet Rapture", airing in January 1996. Griffin played Jerry's nemesis Sally Weaver in two episodes of ''[[Seinfeld]]''. She starred in a dual role in a seventh-season episode of ''[[The X-Files]]'' and in an episode of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s divorce-attorney series ''[[Civil Wars (TV series)|Civil Wars]]'', Griffin's dramatic-series debut.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

After starring in an ''[[HBO]] Half Hour Comedy Special'', Griffin had her first consistent public exposure in 1996, when she was cast as the acerbic colleague of [[Brooke Shields]]' title character on the NBC sitcom ''[[Suddenly Susan]]''{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}. In 1998, Griffin starred in her first one-hour special, HBO's ''Kathy Griffin: A Hot Cup of Talk''. She honed a comedy and television career that poked fun at her relatively modest place in the Hollywood hierarchy in a self-deprecating manner.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} She frequently appears in such self-consciously tacky projects as the reality show competition ''[[The Mole (U.S. season 3)|Celebrity Mole]] Hawaii'', in which she won the 2003 edition after undergoing such experiences as walking over hot [[lava]] with her bare feet. She identifies her victory as the moment she became a "D-list" celebrity.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

[[File:KathyGriffin.png|thumb|upright|Griffin performing stand up in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] in 2008]]
Griffin also has a secondary career in [[voice-over]] work and has been featured on a variety of projects such as the [[animated series]] ''[[Dilbert (TV series)|Dilbert]]'' and ''[[Spider-Man: The New Animated Series]]''. Her television production company is called Inappropriate Laughter.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

On June 12, 2008, Griffin hosted the first [[Bravo (Canada)|Bravo!]] A-List Awards. Included in the show was a scene wherein Griffin mimicked a "[[wardrobe malfunction]]" (referring to the [[Janet Jackson]] [[Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime-show controversy|Super Bowl halftime show controversy]] in 2004). She also hosted the 2009 Bravo A-List Awards, which aired on April&amp;nbsp;15, 2009, and her Bravo special ''Kathy Griffin: [[She'll Cut a Bitch]]'', taped on March 4, 2009, in [[Portland, Oregon]], aired beforehand. [[Shout! Factory]] released an extended version of the show on DVD in early 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shoutfactorystore.com/prod.aspx?pfid=5257079|title=Kathy Griffin: She'll Cut A Bitch|work=shoutfactorystore.com|year=2011|access-date=September 10, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930202719/http://www.shoutfactorystore.com/prod.aspx?pfid=5257079|archivedate=September 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 8, 2009, [[Ballantine Books]] published Griffin's memoir, titled ''Official Book Club Selection: A Memoir According to Kathy Griffin''. The book debuted at No. 1 on [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]]. A week prior, she released her second comedy album, ''[[Suckin' It for the Holidays]]''. It was the comedian's second bid to win a [[Grammy Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/LIFE/usaedition/2010-06-08-griffin08_CV_U.htm|title= Griffin finally runs with the big dogs|first=Gary|last=Strauss|work=USA Today|date=June 7, 2010|publisher=[[Gannett Company|Gannett]]|location=McLean, VA|issn=0734-7456|access-date=September 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|publisher=ABC|date=November 4, 2009|title= Let's Dance, New Comedic Dance Series Featuring Stars Competing for Charitable Grand Prizes, Premieres Monday, November 23|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=20091104abc03|access-date=September 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was announced on November 3, 2009, that Griffin was to host ABC's new show ''Let's Dance'', which was supposed to premiere after the finale of ''[[Dancing with the Stars]]'' on November 23. On the show, celebrity contestants would have reenacted famous routines from past music videos, movies, and musicals while competing for a $250,000 grand prize for their favorite charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Kate|last=Stanhope|date=November 3, 2009| title=Kathy Griffin to Host New ABC Show ''Let's Dance''|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Griffin-Lets-Dance-1011543.aspx|work=TVGuide.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the show never aired.

Griffin hosted [[CNN]]'s New Year's Eve Broadcast on December 31, 2009, along with [[Anderson Cooper]]. As Cooper talked about the [[Balloon boy hoax]], Griffin said the word "fucking" while making fun of the pronunciation of Falcon Heene, the six-year-old boy who was said to have been trapped in the balloon gondola.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/01/AR2010010101653.html|title=Kathy Griffin rings in 2010 by uttering profanity about Balloon Boy on CNN|work=The Washington Post|date=January 2, 2010|publisher=[[Graham Holdings Company|The Washington Post Company]]|location=Washington, D.C.|issn=0190-8286|access-date=September 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Griffin has also guest-starred in an episode of ''[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit]]'', playing a lesbian activist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Kathy-Griffin-Lands-1011867.aspx|title=Kathy Griffin Lands Law &amp; Order: SVU Guest Spot|first=Natalie|last=Abrams|work=tvguide.com|date=November 10, 2009|access-date=September 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 2008 presidential election Griffin has made frequent jokes about Republican vice-presidential contender [[Sarah Palin]] and family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popeater.com/2010/12/06/kathy-griffins-teasing-bristol-palin-vh1-divas|title=Troops Boo Kathy Griffin for Bristol Palin Fat Jokes|first=Rob|last=Shuter|work=popeater.com|date=December 6, 2010|access-date=September 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Griffin parodied Palin in ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'', wearing a red power-suit and wide-rimmed glasses, posing as a judge at the regionals singing competition. Griffin also poked fun at [[Christine O'Donnell]] in the show by stating, "Before we start, I would like to say I am not a witch."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-31749_162-20043841-10391698.html|title=Kathy Griffin plays a Tea Party politician on 'Glee'|work=[[CBS News]]|date=March 16, 2011|publisher=[[CBS]]|location=New York|access-date=September 10, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319060347/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-31749_162-20043841-10391698.html|archivedate=March 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2011/03/16/kathy_griffin_mocks_palintea_party_on_fox_show_glee.html|title=RealClearPolitics – Video – Kathy Griffin Mocks Palin/Tea Party On FOX Show 'GLEE'|work=realclearpolitics.com|date=March 16, 2011|access-date=September 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 15, 2011, Griffin had a guest-starring role on ''Glee'' in the episode "[[Original Song]]" as a Regionals competition judge, "Twitterer and former [[Tea Party movement|Tea Party]] candidate" Tammy Jean Albertson. Her character complained about a [[duet]] of [[Hey Monday]]'s "[[Candles (EP)|Candles]]" between two young men, [[Kurt Hummel]] and [[Blaine Anderson]], and automatically accused their school, Dalton Academy, of being a "gay school". She also remarks that the performance of "[[Loser Like Me]]" by the show's primary Glee club, New Directions, was disgraceful because "when I lost the election, I didn't sing about being a loser, I twittered that [[Barack Obama|Obama]] is a terrorist"; this remark almost started an argument between her and fellow judge Sister Mary Constance ([[Loretta Devine]]).{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

On January 7, 2012, it was announced that&amp;mdash;along with having two more standup specials on Bravo&amp;mdash;Griffin will start a weekly one-hour talk show on the channel, ''[[Kathy (TV series)|Kathy]]'', which will consist of standup routines, "rant about pop culture", and celebrity interviews.&lt;ref name="tv-guide-jan5-griffin-shows"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Kathy-Griffin-Bravo-1041343.aspx|title=Kathy Griffin Will Keep Talking for Bravo|first=Michael|last=Schneider|publisher=[[Pop (U.S. TV network)|TV Guide Network]]|date=January 7, 2012|access-date=January 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first show aired on April 19, 2012, on Bravo. Griffin announced via Twitter on July 26, 2012, that the show had been picked up for a second season.

On April 8, 2013, during a live standup performance in Cincinnati, Ohio, Griffin reportedly announced that her show would not be renewed for a third season. She later confirmed it on her Twitter account. A source close to the series told FOX 411 that Bravo is planning to film several comedy specials starring Griffin after the show wraps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2013/04/08/kathy-griffins-bravo-show-canceled|work=Fox News|title=Souce: Bravo cancels Kathy Griffin series but plans comedy specials for star|date=April 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 13, 2014, it was announced that Griffin was set to host the [[41st Daytime Emmy Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/kathy-griffin-daytime-emmys-1083029.aspx|title=Kathy Griffin Picked to Host the 2014 Daytime Emmy Awards|first=Tim|last=Surette|work=TV Guide|date=June 13, 2014| access-date=June 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the first time in the event's four-decade history, the show bypassed a network television airing for a live online [[streaming media|streaming]] event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/syndication-and-distribution/daytime-emmys-be-streamed-online/131605 "Daytime Emmys to Be Streamed Online"], from ''Broadcasting &amp; Cable'', 6/5/2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guest co-host of ''The View''===
Kathy Griffin served as the unofficial guest co-host of ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]'' from May 2007 to September 2007 and was considered as a replacement for the recently departed [[Rosie O'Donnell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Bill|last=Harris|url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Television/2007/07/09/4324611-sun.html|title=Griffin unsure about ''The View'' gig|work=canoe.ca|date=August 4, 2007|access-date=August 6, 2007|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/67IDLTCPu?url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Television/2007/07/09/4324611-sun.html|archive-date=April 29, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Mark|last=Dagostino|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20040461,00.html|title=Kathy Griffin: Split-Screen Made Rosie Leave The View|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date=May 27, 2007|access-date=August 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Whoopi Goldberg]] was ultimately selected as the permanent replacement. On September 10, 2007, [[Sherri Shepherd]] took over the remaining co-host spot that had been vacant since [[Star Jones]]'s departure.

Griffin divulged in her standup that she is banned from ''The View'' after talking about the gig on her televised comedy special, ''Kathy Griffin: Straight to Hell''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/01292008/gossip/pagesix/banned_by_babs_348303.htm|title=Banned by Babs|work=New York Post|date=January 29, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080130095921/http://www.nypost.com/seven/01292008/gossip/pagesix/banned_by_babs_348303.htm|archivedate=January 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Griffin had also been mentioned as a possible replacement for Walters when she departed the show.

As of August 2009, Griffin had been un-banned from ''The View'' and was a guest on September 18, 2009, and June 15, 2010. However, in an interview on ''The Talk'', Griffin has stated she has been re-banned from ''The View'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://daytimeconfidential.zap2it.com/2010/11/03/shots-fired-kathy-griffin-rips-elisabeth-hasselbeck-on-the-talk|title=Kathy Griffin Rips The View's Elisabeth Hasselbeck on The Talk!|first=Jillian|last=Bowe|work=[[Daytime Confidential]]|date=November 3, 2010|access-date=September 11, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325205959/http://daytimeconfidential.zap2it.com/2010/11/03/shots-fired-kathy-griffin-rips-elisabeth-hasselbeck-on-the-talk|archivedate=March 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to an argument with ''The View'' co-host [[Elisabeth Hasselbeck]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ca.eonline.com/news/marc_malkin/kathy_griffin_hasselbeck_lighten_up/191221|title=Kathy Griffin to Hasselbeck: Lighten Up or...Suck It!|first=Marc|last=Malkin|work=ca.eonline.com|date=July 20, 2010|access-date=September 11, 2011|archivedate=July 10, 2012|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120710144028/http://uk.eonline.com/news/191221/kathy-griffin-to-hasselbeck-lighten-up-or-suck-it|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Griffin has since been unbanned once again and has appeared several times on the show, including as a guest co-host.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

===Laugh Your Head Off World Tour 2017–2018===
In August 2017, Griffin announced a worldwide comedy tour. The title "Laugh Your Head Off" was a reference to her depiction of an effigy of U.S. President Donald Trump's severed head. The tour visited major cities in Singapore, Australia, Germany, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and many more European, and Asian cities. Several shows sold out within minutes of going on sale, leading to Griffin adding several shows to the lineup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etonline.com/kathy-griffin-announces-new-world-tour-called-laugh-your-head-following-donald-trump-controversy|title=Kathy Griffin Announces World Tour|first=Elizabeth|last=Stanton|work=[[Entertainment Tonight]] |date=August 27, 2017|access-date=October 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She continued with a North America leg of the tour, commencing May 23, 2018, in [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]], Canada, and including both [[Radio City Music Hall]] and [[Carnegie Hall]] in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newsday.com/entertainment/celebrities/kathy-griffin-radio-city-1.17847480|title=Kathy Griffin adds Radio City tour stop after selling out Carnegie Hall date| first= Frank |last=Lovece|work=[[Newsday]]|location=Long Island/New York City|date=April 3, 2018 |accessdate=April 7, 2018|quote=...begins her North American leg in Ottawa, Ontario, on May 23.}}{{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.thewrap.com/kathy-griffin-in-shock-carnegie-hall-comeback-show-sold-out-one-day/|title=Kathy Griffin 'In Shock' Her Carnegie Hall Comeback Show Sold Out in One Day|first=Rosemary |last=Rossi|date= March 17, 2018 |accessdate= April 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
===Various talk shows bans===
Although some talk show hosts such as [[Craig Kilborn]], [[Bill Maher]] and [[Howard Stern]] (whom she credits with giving her a "straight fanbase") welcome her humor on their programs, Griffin said she was banned from appearing on several TV shows including ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'' and ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://teamcoco.com/video/kathy-griffin-barbara-walters|title=Kathy Griffin: Barbara Walters Will Cut A Bitch!|website=TeamCoco|language=en|access-date=May 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She got re-banned from ''The View'' because of a joke she made about Barbara Walters. She says ''Ellen''{{'}}s producers told her they cannot have her on "trashing celebrities",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/entertainment/64453.htm|title=Last in Line for Celebrity: Griffin – Hollywood's Outcast|last=Seibel|first=Deborah Starr|date=May 30, 2006|work=The New York Post|access-date=July 1, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060912213128/http://www.nypost.com/entertainment/64453.htm|archivedate=September 12, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; but she appeared as a guest on ''The Ellen DeGeneres Show'' on September 11, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ellen.warnerbros.com/2007/09/tuesday_september_11_kathy_gri.php|title=The Ellen DeGeneres Show|access-date=September 18, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013085859/http://ellen.warnerbros.com/2007/09/tuesday_september_11_kathy_gri.php|archivedate=October 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most notable controversies occurred when she made a joke during a 2005 E! televised event that the child actress [[Dakota Fanning]], then age 11, had entered [[drug rehabilitation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/arts/tv/12299|title=Dorothy Snarker|last=Sternbergh|first=Adam|date=August 8, 2005|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|access-date=July 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This incident got Griffin fired from hosting duties on E!'s red-carpet award show coverage. Nevertheless, E! purchased rights to air ''My Life on the D-List'' for its British channel, a fact she noted in an episode of season 3.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

===Emmy Awards controversy===
[[File:Griffin Turner McDonald.jpg|thumb|Griffin, [[Michael McDonald (comedian)|Michael McDonald]] and [[Karri Turner]] perform an improvisational skit for soldiers and airmen in [[Tikrit]], Iraq, March 17, 2006.]]
The second season of ''My Life on the D-List'', which premiered on June 6, 2006, earned Griffin the 2007 [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Reality Program|Outstanding Reality Program]], non-competition, on September 8, 2007. She received it during the [[Creative Arts Emmy Award]]s, which was hosted by [[Carlos Mencia]] and aired on [[E!]] on September 15. Griffin stirred up controversy with her acceptance speech, saying,

{{quote|Now, a lot of people come up here and thank [[Jesus]] for this award. I want you to know that no one had less to do with this award than Jesus. He didn't help me a bit. If it was up to him, [[Cesar Millan]] would be up here with that damn dog.

Griffin later explained that she meant this remark not as a slight on Jesus, but rather as a satire of celebrities who thank Jesus profusely and nonsensically for their awards, especially artists who themselves are controversial in their speech and actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbziBwi489Q|title=Larry King Live|date=September 17, 2007|access-date=September 19, 2007|publisher=YouTube|format=video|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307144609/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbziBwi489Q|archivedate=March 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Catholic League (U.S.)|Catholic League]] urged the academy to "denounce Griffin's obscene and [[blasphemy|blasphemous]] comment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.celebritymound.com/kathy-griffins-emmy-remarks-to-be-censored|title=Griffin's Emmy remarks to be censored|last=Elber|first=Lynn|date=September 11, 2007|access-date=September 11, 2007|publisher=CelebrityMound.com|agency=AP|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708131757/http://www.celebritymound.com/kathy-griffins-emmy-remarks-to-be-censored|archivedate=July 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Smoky Mountain Opry Theater|The Miracle Theater]] of [[Pigeon Forge, Tennessee]] printed out a full-page advertisement for [[USA Today]] which said, "Although others may choose to use their national platform to slander our God, we are honored as professional entertainers to stand for Christ."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Griffin scolded by Christian theater troupe|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/griffin-scolded-by-christian-theater-150643|accessdate=April 6, 2018|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=September 21, 2007|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Academy said that her "offensive remarks will not be part of the E! telecast on Saturday night".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,296382,00.html|title=Kathy Griffin's Emmy Remarks About Jesus to Be Censored|date=September 11, 2007|access-date=September 11, 2007|publisher=Fox News|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Griffin later responded, "Am I the only Catholic left with a sense of humor?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,22404898-23109,00.html|title='Offensive' Jesus remarks cut from Emmys|date=September 12, 2007|work=News.com.au|access-date=September 18, 2007|agency=Reuters|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013101310/http://news.com.au/story/0%2C23599%2C22404898-23109%2C00.html|archivedate=October 13, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Termination of appearance on ''Hannah Montana''====
Griffin said she was fired from an appearance on the show ''[[Hannah Montana]]'', on account of her Emmy acceptance speech. According to Griffin "the instructions literally came down, 'We don't want her anywhere near the building.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/daily/fashion/2008/03/kathy_griffin_gets_rejected_al.html|title=In Praise of Kathy Griffin|date=March 18, 2008|access-date=September 11, 2011|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Griffin responded in her comedy act, joking that [[Miley Cyrus]] "...has been flashing her green bra and posing topless."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aoltv.com/2008/05/01/was-kathy-griffin-dumped-over-jesus-joke|title=Was Kathy Griffin dumped over Jesus joke?|last=Boursaw|first=Jane|date=May 1, 2008|access-date=September 11, 2011|work=AOL TV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Banning from Apollo Theater ===
In a July 2009 episode of ''My Life on the D-List'', after using profanity in an [[Nadya Suleman|Octomom]] joke during her routine at New York's [[Apollo Theater]], Griffin said that she received a letter banning her from the venue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://talkoffame.com/?p=1271|title=Kathy Griffin's Attempt To Win Over The Black Community|access-date=September 11, 2011|work=talkoffame.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130811230631/http://talkoffame.com/?p=1271|archivedate=August 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Depiction of President Trump===
On May 30, 2017, Griffin posted a video of herself holding "a mask styled to look like the severed, bloody head" of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Donald Trump]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/31/arts/trump-kathy-griffin.html|title=CNN Fires Kathy Griffin From New Year's Eve Broadcast Over Trump Photo|first=Jonah Engel|last=Bromwich|date=May 31, 2017|work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=June 21, 2017|archivedate= June 21, 2017| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170621214210/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/31/arts/trump-kathy-griffin.html?_r=0|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was posted on her [[Instagram]] and [[Twitter]] accounts. She wrote: "I caption this 'there was blood coming out of his eyes, blood coming out of his...wherever," referencing a past comment Trump had made about [[Megyn Kelly]].

Various members of the Trump family responded to the photo, including Trump, his son [[Donald Trump Jr.|Donald Jr.]], and his wife [[Melania Trump|Melania]], who said, "As a mother, a wife, and a human being, that photo is very disturbing.

On June 2, 2017, an attorney for Griffin, [[Lisa Bloom]], stated, "Like many edgy works of artistic expression, the photo could be interpreted different ways.

CNN said in a statement prior to announcing her termination, "We found what she did disgusting and offensive. We are pleased to see she has apologized and asked that the photos be taken down."&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Cooper said, "For the record, I am appalled by the photo shoot Kathy Griffin took part in.

==Style of humor==
Griffin developed her love for [[popular culture]] through her immediate and extended family, who were frequently commenting about the latest news. She explained that "I may have been into ''[[The Brady Bunch]]'' like every other kid, but I also wanted to watch [[John Lennon]] and [[Yoko Ono]] on ''[[The Dick Cavett Show]]'', and every minute of the [[United States Senate Watergate Committee|Watergate hearings]]. It was
fear of the dinner table that got me hooked."&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{harvnb|Griffin|2010|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has also named her mother Maggie as influential in her consumption of pop culture, calling her "the ideal audience for the Hollywood dish". Griffin named the character of [[Rhoda Morgenstern]] of 1970s sitcom ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'' as an influence, saying,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{harvnb|Griffin|2010|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Griffin established her career with candid observations about everyday life and her dating experiences, later focusing on mainly mocking celebrities, her act currently consists of recounting embellished stories involving celebrities. Though her humor may be wicked, Griffin hopes people understand that no malice is intended by it. "I'm genuinely a fan of most of the people I trash in the act," said Griffin in an interview. "I really, really try and focus on making fun of people for their behavior. I'm not so into making fun of someone for the way they look, or something that's out of their control."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://suicidegirls.com/interviews/Kathy%20Griffin%3A%20My%20Life%20on%20the%20D%20List|title=Kathy Griffin: My Life on the D List|first=Nicole|last=Powers|work=SuicideGirls.com|date=May 25, 2009|access-date=May 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Griffin is sometimes the object of her own humor, particularly with regard to her D-list status. While Griffin paints herself as a Hollywood outsider, she has a group of close celebrity friends such as [[Rosie O'Donnell]], [[Joan Rivers]], [[Jerry Seinfeld]], [[Gloria Estefan]], [[Whoopi Goldberg]], [[Jennifer Coolidge]], [[Rachel True]], [[Larry David]], [[Ricky Gervais]], [[Anderson Cooper]], [[Cher]] and [[Lance Bass]]. Her longtime friendship with Bass was the catalyst for a feud between her and gossip blogger [[Perez Hilton]], in which Griffin expressed anger over Hilton's "[[outing]]" of Bass on his website, calling Hilton's attacks on Bass "mean" and "unfunny".&lt;ref name="HiltonFeud1"&gt;{{cite web|work=In Case You Didn't Know|url=http://icydk.com/2006/12/06/perez-hilton-visits-howard-stern|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012082323/http://icydk.com/2006/12/06/perez-hilton-visits-howard-stern|archivedate=October 12, 2007|title=Perez Hilton Visits Howard Stern|access-date=October 19, 2007|publisher=ICYDK}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HiltonFeud2"&gt;{{cite web|work=Celebrity Babylon|url=http://www.celebritybabylon.com/features/perez-and-kathy-griffin-make-nice|title=Perez and Kathy Griffin Make Nice|access-date=October 19, 2007|publisher=Celebrity Babylon|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228191953/http://www.celebritybabylon.com/features/perez-and-kathy-griffin-make-nice|archivedate=February 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hilton responded by saying that Griffin's anger was hypocritical, considering all of the gay jokes she makes about Clay Aiken in her stand-up routines.&lt;ref name="HiltonFeud1"/&gt; In 2007, Griffin commented on her aversion to making fun of celebrity friends by saying, "There's nothing I won't do, but on the other hand I'm full of shit because that changes.

Prior to the [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Proposition 8]] ballot results, Griffin volunteered for the [[Los Angeles LGBT Center|Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center]]'s "Vote for Equality" campaign, going door-to-door asking Los Angeles residents for their opinion of LGBT marriage rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=AKA William|url=http://www.akawilliam.com/kathy-griffin-goes-door-to-door-for-gay-rights|title=Kathy Griffin Goes Door-to-Door For Gay Rights|publisher=AKA William|date=April 10, 2009 |access-date=January 22, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114162749/http://www.akawilliam.com/kathy-griffin-goes-door-to-door-for-gay-rights|archivedate=January 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2010, Griffin helped organize a rally in Washington, D.C. to repeal "Don't ask, don't tell".

Griffin caused controversy when she confronted Republican Congresswoman [[Michele Bachmann]] over her views on homosexuality at the 2010 Radio and Television Correspondents' Association Dinner, while in town for her rally against DADT. According to Griffin, she asked Bachmann "were you born a bigot or did you grow into it", a reference to Bachmann's belief that homosexuality is strictly environmental.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLXJ_7I7uXI |title=When Kathy Griffin Met Michele Bachmann|website=Youtube |accessdate=June 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Griffin said Bachmann replied by saying, "That's a good question, I'll have to think about that."

'''Kimberly Ann Bergalis''' (January 19, 1968&amp;nbsp;– December 8, 1991) was an [[United States|American]] woman who was one of six patients purportedly infected with [[HIV]] by dentist [[David J. Acer]], who was infected with [[HIV]] and died of [[AIDS]] in September 1990.&lt;ref name="nytobit"&gt;Lambert, Bruce (December 9, 1991). [https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/09/obituaries/kimberly-bergalis-is-dead-at-23-symbol-of-debate-over-aids-tests.html Kimberly Bergalis Is Dead at 23; Symbol of Debate Over AIDS Tests.] ''[[New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; This incident is the first known case of clinical transmission of HIV.

==Background==
The eldest of three daughters, Bergalis was born in [[Tamaqua, Pennsylvania]] in 1968, where her family lived until moving to Florida in 1978. In 1985, she enrolled at the [[University of Florida]] and majored in business.

In December 1987, dentist Dr. David Acer removed two of Bergalis's [[molars]].  Acer was [[HIV-positive]] at the time, having been diagnosed that fall.  In March 1989 Bergalis began to show symptoms of AIDS and was diagnosed with the disease in January 1990.&lt;ref name=people&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20113381,00.html|title=A Life Stolen Early |last=Johnson|first=Bonnie|date=1990-10-22|publisher=''People''|accessdate=2008-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) initial report&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  | last = CDC  | journal = Morb. Mortal. Wkly. Rep.  | volume = 39  | pages = 489  | year = 1990} | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1488431/}&lt;/ref&gt; that she had likely acquired her infection from her dentist prompted Acer to write an [[open letter]] requesting that his patients be tested for HIV infection.  The [[Florida Department of Health|Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services]] tested over 1000 patients, discovering two additional HIV-positive patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news  | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/22/us/2-new-aids-infections-deepen-florida-mystery.html  | title = 2 New AIDS Infections Deepen Florida Mystery  | date = 1990-09-22  | publisher =[[The New York Times]]| accessdate = 2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The CDC would eventually identify a total of ten HIV-positive former Acer patients, and link the infections of six to their dentist.&lt;ref name="hillis1994"&gt;Hillis DM, Huelsenbeck JP (1994). Nature 369:24-5&lt;/ref&gt;

==CDC investigation==
The CDC conducted a [[phylogenetic]] analysis of the [[DNA]] sequences of the viral ''[[viral envelope|envelope]]'' gene.  The analysis revealed that the viral sequences from five patients, including Bergalis, were more closely related to the dentist's viral sequences than to those from local controls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  | last = Ou  | first = Chin-Yih  | title = Molecular epidemiology of HIV transmission in a dental practice  | journal = Science  | volume = 256  | pages = 1165–1171  | year = 1992  | jstor = 2877255

==Political reaction==
During the last months of her life, Bergalis' case was cited by some politicians and journalists as an example of a 'blameless' HIV infection that had been allowed to happen due to the CDC and the healthcare industry being overly responsive to the concerns of [[Advocacy|AIDS activists]] and the [[homosexuality|gay]] community. In an obituary, the ''[[National Review]]'' wrote that Bergalis 

&lt;blockquote&gt;...came to feel she had a special calling...to bring a glimmer of truth, however forlorn, into a debate characterized by confusion, denial, smugness, and suicidal self-indulgence... 'No sexual history' is how the jaded describe a chaste woman of 23 who, as Miss Bergalis explained to disbelieving interviewers, 'wanted to wait for marriage.' Marriage and its joys will never come for Kimberly Bergalis, but in her integrity and courage she affirmed that other things were also precious.&lt;ref name="natrevobit"&gt;Editorial staff (December 30, 1991). Kimberly Bergalis, R I P ''[[National Review]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Bergalis actively participated in several actions by congressmen to pass legislation restricting the activities of persons infected with HIV. Shortly before Bergalis's 1991 death, despite failing health, she testified before the [[U.S. Congress|Congress]] in support of a bill sponsored by Representative [[William E. Dannemeyer|William Dannemeyer]] mandating HIV tests for healthcare workers, and permitting doctors to test patients without their consent.&lt;ref&gt;Hilts, Philip J. [https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/27/us/aids-patient-urges-congress-to-pass-testing-bill.html], ''The New York Times'', September 27, 1991, accessed December 13, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Death and posthumous controversy==
On December 8, 1991, Bergalis died of AIDS-related complications at her home in Fort Pierce, Florida.&lt;ref name="nytobit"/&gt; Her funeral was held on December 12 in her hometown of Tamaqua, Pennsylvania after which she was buried in Saints Peter and Paul RC Lithuanian Cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Todd|first1=Susan|title=Hundreds Mourn Bergalis|url=http://articles.mcall.com/1991-12-13/news/2822327_1_kimberly-bergalis-hiv-policy-immune-deficiency-syndrome|website=The Morning Call|publisher=mcall.com|accessdate=May 27, 2018|date=December 13, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Shortly after Bergalis’ death, a small park on [[Hutchinson Island South, Florida]] was renamed Kimberly Bergalis Memorial Park in her memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=Jean Ellen|title=Legendary Locals of Fort Pierce|date=2014|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=1-467-10127-3|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly three years after Bergalis’ death, in June 1994, [[CBS]] aired an episode of ''[[60 Minutes]]'' that feature a segment covering Dr. Acer and the patients he infected. The episode alleged that Bergalis, who said she was virgin, was treated for [[genital warts]], a [[sexually transmitted disease]], and had shown her on videotape allegedly claiming to have had sex with two different men during her life. However, none of Bergalis' former serious boyfriends tested positive for HIV. In addition, the ''60 Minutes'' anchors argued that the CDC may have botched the genetic tests that proved that Bergalis had the same strain of HIV as her dentist. The television broadcast was dismissed by CDC scientists as misleading and inaccurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

'''Lorna Morello Muccio''' is a fictional character from the [[Netflix]] [[dramedy]] series ''[[Orange Is the New Black]]'', played by [[Yael Stone]]. Stone was initially contracted for one episode, but the producers kept bringing her back. Morello is based on two real-life inmates featured in [[Piper Kerman]]'s 2010 novel ''[[Orange Is the New Black: My Year in a Women's Prison]]''. Morello is Italian-American, and is portrayed as being a positive, bold, opinionated person and "a hopeless romantic". She has a distinctive accent, which is a mix of [[New York City English|Brooklyn]] and [[Boston accent|Boston]]. Morello made her first screen appearance during the season one premiere episode "I Wasn't Ready".

In the beginning of the first season, Morello was in a sexual relationship with [[Nicky Nichols]] ([[Natasha Lyonne]]). She later ended the relationship, as she felt she was betraying her fiancé, Christopher (Stephen O'Reilly). Morello's role was increased in the second season, and her backstory was shown in its fourth episode, "A Whole Other Hole", where it was revealed that she was not engaged to Christopher, and had in fact stalked and harassed him after one date. In the third season, Morello marries [[Vince Muccio]] ([[John Magaro]]). The character and Stone's portrayal received a generally positive reception from television critics.

On September 17, 2012, Nellie Andreeva from ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'' reported that Australian actress [[Yael Stone]] had been cast as a Boston-Italian transport driver in ''Orange Is the New Black''.&lt;ref name="Andreeva"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2012/09/duo-cast-in-netflixs-orange-is-the-new-black-don-stark-upped-on-vhs-bounce-338146/|title=Duo Cast In Netflix's 'Orange Is The New Black', Don Stark Upped On VH's 'Bounce'|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|date=September 17, 2012|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|accessdate=September 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character was initially called Rosemarie Perrone.&lt;ref name="Andreeva"/&gt; Stone auditioned for the show on August 19, 2012, the day after her wedding to actor [[Dan Spielman]].&lt;ref name="Rigden"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/sure-sounds-like-a-yankee-20131016-2vlax.html?rand=1382402705716|title=Sure sounds like a Yankee|last=Rigden|first=Clare|date=October 17, 2013|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=September 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She originally tried out for the role of Nicky Nichols, but actress [[Natasha Lyonne]] was cast instead. Stone was then brought back to try out for Morello.&lt;ref name="JStone"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://junkee.com/yael-stone-on-orange-is-the-new-black-and-trying-to-making-it-in-new-york/16389|title=Yael Stone On Orange Is The New Black, And Trying To Make It In New York|last=Stone|first=Jake|date=August 5, 2013|publisher=Junkee.com|accessdate=September 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She auditioned with Morello's distinctive accent and she found out she had won the role two days later.&lt;ref name="Rigden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JStone"/&gt; Stone was initially contracted for one episode, but the producers kept bringing her back.&lt;ref name="JStone"/&gt;

Morello is based on two real-life inmates featured in [[Piper Kerman]]'s 2010 memoir ''[[Orange Is the New Black: My Year in a Women's Prison]]''. Stone did not talk to the writers about the inspiration for Morello, as she did not want to confuse herself during filming.&lt;ref name="Gorman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elle.com.au/pop-culture/elle-interview/2013/11/yael-stone/|title=Yael Stone talks Orange Is The New Black|last=Gorman|first=Alyx|date=November 22, 2013|website=[[Elle (magazine)|Elle Australia]]|accessdate=September 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later learned who inspired her character after speaking with Kerman's husband.&lt;ref name="Gorman"/&gt; Stone said "when I began the show, I had my ideas about who Morello was, but it was pretty fascinating to really understand these characters, these supporting roles, are made of people and an experience that actually happened."&lt;ref name="Gorman"/&gt; During her research for the role, Stone read some first-hand accounts from women inside and spoke with lawyers and judges about their clients.&lt;ref name="Kemshal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailylife.com.au/dl-people/interviews/qa-with-yael-stone-from-orange-is-the-new-black-20130822-2sd2m.html|title=Q&amp;A with Yael Stone from Orange is the New Black|last=Kemshal-Bell|first=Jean|date=August 22, 2013|publisher=Daily Life|accessdate=September 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==

===Characterization===
In her fictional backstory, Morello grew up in Boston, after her Brooklyn mother married an Italian Bostonian man.&lt;ref name="JStone"/&gt; Morello's home life was shown in the fourth episode of the second season. Morello's mother needed constant care, as she was ill, while her father and brother just sat around the house watching the television.&lt;ref name="Berman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2014/06/19/lorna_morello_yael_stone_on_orange_is_the_new_black_is_both_delusional_and.html|title=Character Studies: Morello, Orange Is the New Black|last=Berman|first=Eliza|date=June 19, 2014|website=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|accessdate=September 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morello escaped by going to the movies and committing mail fraud by purchasing designer clothing online, then claiming she never received the items to get a refund.&lt;ref name="Berman"/&gt; Her bedroom walls were shown to be covered in posters and collages, which prompted Eliza Berman from ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' to note that Morello had created a "teenaged refuge" and that she was "stuck in adolescence".&lt;ref name="Berman"/&gt; Morello received a 34-month sentence for her crime, the nature of which was not initially revealed. It also emerged that Morello had a fiancé, Christopher, on the outside and she was "a hopeless romantic".&lt;ref name="Berman"/&gt; Morello was the first inmate [[Piper Chapman]] ([[Taylor Schilling]]) met at Litchfield, as she was the prison's transport driver. Stone told Seanna Cronin from ''[[The Toowoomba Chronicle]]'' that Morello's role in the prison was to welcome new inmates and show them around.&lt;ref name="Cronin"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thechronicle.com.au/news/aussie-actor-yael-stone-had-just-a-handful-of-cred/2071209/|title=Yael Stone takes lead in Orange is the New Black|last=Cronin|first=Seanna|date=November 23, 2013|work=[[The Toowoomba Chronicle]]|accessdate=September 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stone said Morello was a positive person and "a really vulnerable human being", who was dealing with her situation the best she could.&lt;ref name="Cronin"/&gt; She also described Morello as being "pretty bold sometimes, and weirdly opinionated."&lt;ref name="HangingOut"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vulture.com/2014/06/yael-stone-orange-is-the-new-black-profile.html|title=Hanging Out With Orange Is the New Black's Yael Stone|last=Martin|first=Denise|date=June 6, 2014|work=[[Vulture (blog)|Vulture]]|accessdate=September 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morello's distinctive accent is a mix of [[New York City English|Brooklyn]] and [[Boston accent|Boston]].&lt;ref name="JStone"/&gt; Stone, who normally speaks with her native Australian accent, auditioned with the accent, and worked hard on getting the phonetics and the emphasis on the vowels right.&lt;ref name="Bennett"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/114440/orange-new-black-lornas-accent-interview-yael-stone|title=Meet the Australian Actress Who Does the Most Amazing Accent on Television|last=Bennett|first=Laura|date=August 23, 2013|website=[[The New Republic]]|accessdate=September 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also travelled to Boston to do some research and met with a dialect coach. Stone stayed in character for her first four months on set to help perfect the accent.&lt;ref name="JStone"/&gt; Stone felt that she would never perfect the accent, due to the intricacies of the dialect.&lt;ref name="Kemshal"/&gt; The actress later said the accent reflected the fact that Morello's had drifted down the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] and had not quite found where she belonged.&lt;ref name="Buxton"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/19/yael-stone-orange-is-the-new-black_n_5511988.html|title=Yael Stone: It's 'A Privilege' To Do Authentic Sex Scenes On 'Orange Is The New Black'|last=Buxton|first=Ryan|date=June 19, 2014|website=[[The Huffington Post]]|accessdate=September 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morello is a big fan of the musical film ''[[West Side Story (film)|West Side Story]]'' and its lead actress [[Natalie Wood]], so she styles her hair and make-up in a similar way.&lt;ref name="JStone"/&gt; The show's stylists commented that Morello's look is also inspired by bridal make-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/thecut/2014/06/10-beauty-and-hair-secrets-from-oitnb-season-2/slideshow/2014/06/06/orange_is_the_newblackbeauty/orange-new-black-02/|title=10 Beauty and Hair Secrets From Orange Is the New Black Season 2|last=Wischhover|first=Cheryl|date=June 9, 2014|website=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|accessdate=September 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morello scrapes out lipstick tubes with her fingernails to achieve her signature red lips, and she uses instant coffee to create brown [[eye shadow]].&lt;ref name="Morton"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://style.mtv.com/2014/06/11/orange-is-the-new-black-style-moments/|title=14 Incredible Style Moments From 'Orange Is The New Black' Season 2|last=Morton|first=Caitlin|date=June 11, 2014|publisher=[[MTV|MTV Style]]|accessdate=September 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her vintage-style waves are set with toilet paper curlers and Lizzy Dening for ''[[Grazia]]'' observed that they reflected Morello's "romantic ideals".&lt;ref name="Morton"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.graziadaily.co.uk/beauty/makeup/lorna-morello-orange-is-the-new-black-beauty|title=Made Up: Lorna Morello Is This Week's Beauty Screen Icon|last=Dening|first=Lizzy|date=11 August 2014|website=[[Grazia]]|accessdate=September 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morello's pre-prison style consisted of designer outfits, as showcased at her trial when she wore a little [[Dolce &amp; Gabbana]] dress covered in chains.&lt;ref name="LornasCrime"/&gt; Stone thought that the dress showed that Morello did not take her crimes seriously. She also praised the show's costume designer, Jenn Rogien, for Morello's "transformative" style.&lt;ref name="LornasCrime"/&gt;

===Relationship with Nicky Nichols===
[[File:Natasha Lyonne 2014 (cropped).jpg|150px|right|thumb|Morello had a sexual relationship with fellow inmate Nicky Nichols played by [[Natasha Lyonne]] (''pictured'').]]

At the beginning of the first season, Morello is in a sexual relationship with fellow inmate [[Nicky Nichols]] (Natasha Lyonne). However, she suddenly ends it, as she feels guilty about betraying her fiancé Christopher.&lt;ref name="Fallon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/07/02/natasha-lyonne-and-yael-stone-on-oitnb-s-heartbreaking-scene.html|title=Natasha Lyonne and Yael Stone on OITNB's Heartbreaking Scene|last=Fallon|first=Kevin|date=July 2, 2014|website=[[The Daily Beast]]|accessdate=September 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lyonne said that the character's relationship had been "push-pull" and they had both been through a lot with their obsessive-compulsive personalities.&lt;ref name="Fallon"/&gt; Stone called the sex scenes between Morello and Nicky "a privilege" to film and thought they were well written and necessary to the show, as they showed a part of prison life.&lt;ref name="Buxton"/&gt; After Nicky learns the truth about Morello's fiancé Christopher, she comforts Morello and lets her know that she accepted her for who she was.&lt;ref name="CrazyPast"/&gt; Lyonne thought the scene was "an interesting culmination" of what Morello and Nicky had been through, and believed that they would be bonded forever by it.&lt;ref name="Fallon"/&gt;

Lyonne explained, "it's a moment that's very true to life. Even if it's not a romantic relationship, you can say, 'I really love you unconditionally. I see who you are completely. I'm here for you, and I love you.' Whether it's just as friends or romantically."&lt;ref name="Fallon"/&gt; Stone told Kevin Fallon from ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' that Morello was uncomfortable at being forced into being honest about Christopher, but thought Nicky's reaction was "amazing" and important for Morello to hear.&lt;ref name="Fallon"/&gt; Lyonne added that Nicky's relationship with Morello was one of the most "significant" in her life.&lt;ref name="Fallon"/&gt; Stone hoped that Morello would reconcile romantically with Nicky, as she missed working closely with Lyonne. Lyonne believed that Morello would have to treat Nicky as an equal for them to get back together, which Sadie Gennis from ''[[TV Guide]]'' doubted Morello would be mature enough to do.&lt;ref name="Gennis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Orange-Is-The-New-Black-Season-2-Morello-Yael-Stone-1073624.aspx|title=Orange Is the New Black Season 2: Will Morello Ever Face Reality?|last=Gennis|first=Sadie|date=November 19, 2013|website=[[TV Guide]]|accessdate=September 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Character expansion===
Morello was a recurring character for the first and second seasons of ''Orange Is the New Black''.&lt;ref name="Regular"/&gt; In March 2014, series creator [[Jenji Kohan]] said Morello's backstory would be revealed in the second season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/paleyfest-orange-is-new-black-688834|title=PaleyFest: Whose 'Orange Is the New Black' Backstories Will Be Revealed in Season 2?|last=Katz|first=Jessie|date=March 14, 2014|website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=September 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Stone commented there would be some "pretty hard hitting truths coming out" and that she was amazed at what happens to her character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/orange-is-the-new-black-stars-on-whats-in-store-for-season-2-what-they-binge-watch-and-what-would-land-them-in-prison|last=Cipriani|first=Casey|title='Orange is the New Black' Stars on What's in Store for Season 2, What They Binge Watch, and What Would Land Them in Prison|date=May 16, 2014|publisher=[[Indiewire]]|accessdate=September 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The episode, titled "A Whole Other Hole", revealed that Morello's often mentioned fiancé, Christopher MacLaren (Stephen O'Reilly), was not actually her fiancé and she had been incarcerated for stalking and terrorizing him.&lt;ref name="LornasCrime"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2014/06/orange-is-the-new-black-yael-stone-lorna-crime.html|title=Orange Is the New Black's Yael Stone on Lorna's Crime, the Chain-Print Dress, and Stalkers|last=Martin|first=Denise|date=June 24, 2014|website=[[Vulture (blog)|Vulture]]|accessdate=September 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stone learned the truth about Morello's backstory the day she got the script for the episode. Prior to that, she had imagined her own version of Morello's history, believing that she might have committed an assault or been charged for the mail fraud.&lt;ref name="Gennis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Greco"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/news/a7168/orange-is-the-new-black-yael-stone-lorna-morello-interview/|title=Orange Is the New Black's Yael Stone on Lorna's Sad and Disturbing Backstory|last=Greco|first=Patti|date=June 11, 2014|website=[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]|accessdate=September 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stone pointed out that there had been some hints that Morello was not telling the truth during previous episodes, including Nicky mentioning that Christopher had not been to visit and Morello's sister, Francine (Kristen Sieh), calling her to say that Christopher was getting married.&lt;ref name="LornasCrime"/&gt;

In flashbacks, it was shown that Morello and Christopher had a [[meet-cute]] at the local postal office. Their relationship did not go further than their first date, but Morello began stalking and threatening him, even going as far as to place a bomb under his girlfriend's car.&lt;ref name="LornasCrime"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Greco"/&gt; Stone admitted that she was shocked at the storyline and had to research what kind of stalker Morello was. Stone believed Morello is an [[erotomaniac]], someone who suffers from the delusion that their victim is in love with them.&lt;ref name="LornasCrime"/&gt; Stone did not excuse Morello's behavior, but pointed out that she was suffering from an illness and needed help. She continued, "A lot of people who are mentally imbalanced do end up in prison because they don’t have the kind of support they need. The great beauty of ''Orange'' is that it illuminates these very sad lives that probably shouldn't have ended up in prison."&lt;ref name="LornasCrime"/&gt;
[[File:John Magaro.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Actor [[John Magaro]] (''pictured'') joined the season 3 cast as Morello's love interest and eventual husband, Vince Muccio.]]
After taking [[Miss Rosa]] ([[Barbara Rosenblat]]) to a hospital appointment, Morello took advantage of the situation and drove to Christopher's house. After breaking in, Morello took a bath while wearing his fiancée's wedding veil.&lt;ref name="CrazyPast"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/orange-is-the-new-black-lorna-morello-nicky-yael-stone-natasha-lyonne-1083893.aspx|title=Orange Is the New Black Stars on Morello's Crazy Past, Nicky's Worrisome Future|last=Gennis|first=Sadie|date=July 1, 2014|website=[[TV Guide]]|accessdate=September 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After reading the script, Stone became worried that if Morello was caught, she might lose her job on the show.&lt;ref name="CrazyPast"/&gt; However, when Morello heard Christopher coming home, she managed to escape and get the van back to the hospital in time. Stone explained that the storyline was challenging to film, as she was alone with her character for the majority of the time. She also decided to do her own stunt when Morello jumped out of the window.&lt;ref name="LornasCrime"/&gt; After realising that Morello had been in his home, Christopher broke the restraining order and "brutally" confronted Morello in the prison. Stone called the moment "very painful" for Morello, especially when she learned that Nicky had witnessed it.&lt;ref name="LornasCrime"/&gt;

Season 2 also saw Morello interacting with some different inmates, including [[Crazy Eyes (character)|Crazy Eyes]] ([[Uzo Aduba]]), which Stone was pleased with.&lt;ref name="Gennis"/&gt; She said "Obviously the show is so racially divided that often you're like you stay with your gang. You don't get to do a lot of stuff. But as the season goes on we get to interact in different ways."&lt;ref name="Gennis"/&gt; Morello also played a part in the season finale. After learning that Miss Rosa was dying from cancer, Morello felt sorry for her and exited the transport van, urging Miss Rosa to use it to escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/18/orange-is-the-new-black-finale-its-almost-like-thelma-and-louise/|title='Orange Is the New Black' Finale: It's Almost Like 'Thelma and Louise'|last=Zernike|first=Kate|date=July 18, 2014|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=September 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 13, 2014, it was announced that Stone had been promoted to the regular cast for the third season.&lt;ref name="Regular"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2014/06/yael-stone-upped-to-regular-orange-is-the-new-black-jonathan-adams-last-man-standing-788151/|title=Yael Stone Upped To Regular On 'Orange', Jonathan Adams On 'Last Man Standing'|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|date=June 13, 2014|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|accessdate=September 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicky returns to Litchfield in the fourth season and tries to resume her romantic relationship with Morello. But Morello turns her down as she wants to remain faithful to Vince.&lt;ref name="Strause"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/orange-is-new-black-star-natasha-lyonne-season-four-return-904323|title='Orange Is the New Black' Star on Surprise Season 4 Return and Jon Snow Comparisons|last=Strause|first=Jackie|date=June 20, 2016|website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=June 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lyonne told Jackie Strause of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' that she thought both Nicky and Morello loved each other, but while Nicky has intimacy issues, Morello is in denial about her sexuality.&lt;ref name="Strause"/&gt; Lyonne also commented, "and I think Lorna's probably somewhere on the spectrum. So for Lorna, it's probably a case where the person transcends gender and I think that it puts them both in this complicated dance with true intimacy. Where once they do decide to sign up full-on with that relationship, its going to become very real pretty quickly because they are both pretty clear on the fact that they love each other so much."&lt;ref name="Strause"/&gt;

==Reception==
The character, her accent and Stone's performance have received mostly positive attention from critics.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} Laura Bennett from ''[[The New Republic]]'' branded Morello "one of the most memorable characters" on ''Orange Is New the Black'', and said she had "the most amazing accent on television".&lt;ref name="Bennett"/&gt; While Sadie Gennis from ''TV Guide'' commented that Morello holds "a special place in our heart".&lt;ref name="Gennis"/&gt; Alyssa Rosenberg, writing for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', observed "Yael Stone's performance as inmate Lorna Morello seems to be the consensus choice for biggest breakout."&lt;ref name="Rosenberg"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2014/06/26/orange-is-the-new-black-and-the-meaning-of-love/|title='Orange Is The New Black' and the meaning of love|last=Rosenberg|first=Alyssa|date=June 26, 2013|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rosenberg also noted that Morello's backstory gave her more depth.&lt;ref name="Rosenberg"/&gt;

Orli Matlow of Bustle.com found Stone's portrayal of Morello "so endearing" that it makes the audience forget that she is violent criminal.&lt;ref name="Matlow"/&gt; Matlow added that it would be "interesting" to see how Morello and Vince's marriage works out.&lt;ref name="Matlow"/&gt;

'''Marie Noe''' (born August 23, 1928) is an [[Americans|American]] woman who was convicted in June 1999 of murdering eight of her children. Between 1949 and 1968, eight of the ten Noe children died of mysterious causes which were then attributed to [[sudden infant death syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Police Investigating Deaths of 8 Infants |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9500E6DE163AF931A35757C0A96E958260 |work=New York Times |date=1998-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All eight children were healthy at birth and were developing normally. Two other children died of natural causes. Noe pleaded guilty in June 1999 to eight counts of [[Murder (United States law)#Degrees of murder in the United States|second-degree murder]], and was sentenced to 20 years' probation and psychiatric examination.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Noe was born '''Marie Lyddy''' on August 23, 1928 in the [[Kensington, Philadelphia|Kensington]] neighborhood of [[Philadelphia]] to Ella (née Ackler) and James Lyddy. Marie was one of several children born of her parents' troubled marriage. Marie contracted [[scarlet fever]] at age five, which she later credited as the cause of learning difficulties. She dropped out of school as a young teenager to work and help care for a niece, born to one of her older sisters when Marie was 12 and raised as Marie's sister.&lt;ref name="cradletograve"&gt;{{cite news |first=Stephen |last=Fried |title=Cradle to Grave |url=http://www.phillymag.com/articles/cradle_to_grave/ |work=Philadelphia |date=April 1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage and children===
Marie Lyddy and Arthur Allen Noe (1921–2009) met at a private club in the [[West Kensington, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|West Kensington]] neighborhood of Philadelphia. On June 1, 1948, after a brief courtship, the couple eloped.&lt;ref name="cradletograve"/&gt; The couple proceeded to have ten children, all of whom died between the ages of five days and 14 months.

# Richard Allan Noe (March 7, 1949 – April 7, 1949)
# Elizabeth Mary Noe (September 8, 1950 – February 17, 1951)
# Jacqueline Noe (April 23, 1952 – May 3, 1952)
# Arthur Noe Jr. (April 23, 1955 – April 28, 1955)
# Constance Noe (February 24, 1958 – March 20, 1958)
# Letitia Noe (stillborn, August 24, 1959; cause of death was umbilical cord knot)
# Mary Lee Noe (June 19, 1962 – January 4, 1963)
# Theresa Noe (died in hospital, June 1963; cause of death was "congenital [[hemorrhagic diathesis]]")
# Catherine Ellen Noe (December 3, 1964 – February 24, 1966)
# Arthur Joseph Noe (July 28, 1967 – January 2, 1968)

During the [[Caesarean section|Caesarean birth]] of her last child, Noe suffered a [[uterine rupture]] and underwent a [[hysterectomy]].&lt;ref name="cradletograve"/&gt;

In 1963 ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine published a sympathetic article on Noe, written by Mary Cadwalader and using the pseudonyms Martha and Andrew Moore for Noe and her husband, after six of Noe's children had died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.philly.com/1998-08-05/news/25726245_1_crib-death-marie-noe-sudden-infant-death-syndrome|title=Charges To Be Filed In Infants' Deaths Marie Noe, 70, Could Be Arrested This Week. Eight Of Her Children Died In Mysterious Circumstances.|work=Philly.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iw4gIIKqrLEC&amp;pg=PA92&amp;dq=%22life+magazine%22+%22marie+noe%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BN4NVJ26HY-eyAT6y4DADg&amp;ved=0CEAQ6wEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22life%20magazine%22%20%22marie%20noe%22&amp;f=false|title=Engendered Death|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reinvestigation and charges===
Interest in the case was renewed after the publication of the 1997 book ''The Death of Innocents'', about New York woman [[Waneta Hoyt]], and an investigative article (''[http://www.phillymag.com/articles/cradle-to-grave/ Cradle to Grave]'' by Stephen Fried) that appeared in the April 1998 issue of [[Philadelphia (magazine)|''Philadelphia'' magazine]].

Stephen Fried turned over his investigation results to the Philadelphia Police Department in March 1998. Upon questioning by police after receiving the material, Noe admitted to suffocating four of her children. She stated that she could not remember what happened to the other four children who died under similar circumstances. She was charged with first-degree murder in August 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Philadelphia Mother Is Charged With Killing 8 of Her 10 Babies |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9801E1DE123BF935A3575BC0A96E958260 |work=New York Times |date=1999-08-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A plea agreement was reached in which Noe admitted to eight counts of second-degree murder and she was sentenced in June 1999 to 20 years of probation with the first five years under house arrest.

As a condition of her plea agreement, Noe agreed to psychiatric study in hopes of identifying what caused her to kill her children. In September 2001, a study was filed with the court that stated Noe was suffering from mixed-[[personality disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Study finds child-killer Noe has combination of disorders |url=http://www.philly.com/philly/news/pennsylvania/20100203_Killer_of_8_babies_now_alone.html |work=The Philadelphia Inquirer |date=2010-02-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books featuring Marie Noe==
The book ''Cradle of Death'' by John Glatt is about Marie Noe and her children's murders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nTGyRGimxVIC&amp;dq=%22marie+noe%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Cradle of Death|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many other books feature Marie Noe alongside other criminals, such as ''Engendered Death: Pennsylvania Women Who Kill'' by [[Joseph W. Laythe]] and ''The Crime Buff's Guide to Outlaw Pennsylvania'' by Ron Franscell and Karen B. Valentine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cVRYAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA111&amp;dq=%22marie+noe%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RuANVO6CBoKwyATY3IC4Bg&amp;ved=0CEMQ6wEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22marie%20noe%22&amp;f=false|title=The Crime Buff's Guide to Outlaw Pennsylvania|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w3M_a1NZSFAC&amp;pg=PA93&amp;dq=%22marie+noe%22+pennsylvania&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=neANVMnwFoydygT4kYCgCA&amp;ved=0CCkQ6wEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22marie%20noe%22%20pennsylvania&amp;f=false|title=Engendered Death|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book ''The Life You Longed For: A Novel'', by Maribeth Fischer, which is fictional, also mentions Noe's murders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4qjOwSK_7B0C&amp;pg=PA47&amp;dq=%22marie+noe%22+life&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=weANVMivHsWxyAT1-4DABg&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22marie%20noe%22%20life&amp;f=false|title=The Life You Longed For|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani''' (born 19 April 1957) is an Indian business magnate, the chairman, managing director, and the largest shareholder of [[Reliance Industries Limited]] (RIL), a [[Fortune Global 500]] company and India's most valuable company by its [[market value]].&lt;ref name="aboutus2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ril.com/html/aboutus/Mukesh_Ambani.html|title=Mukesh Ambani :: RIL :: Reliance Group of Industries|publisher=RIL.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416033537/http://ril.com/html/aboutus/Mukesh_Ambani.html|archivedate=16 April 2015|deadurl=yes|accessdate=22 August 2013}}8250964307&lt;/ref&gt;

Mukesh was born in Aden, Yemen and brought up in Mumbai, India. He received his degree in Chemical Engineering from the Institute of Chemical Technology in the early 1970s. Mukesh started working alongside his father Dhirubhai Ambani in their family business, Reliance, since 1981. Reliance Industries Limited deals mainly in refining, [[petrochemical]]s, and in the oil and gas sectors. [[Reliance Retail]] Ltd., another subsidiary, is the largest [[retailer]] in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/Ambani-becomes-india-s-top-retailer-as-biyani-slips-post-demerger-113081600179_1.html|title=Ambani tops retailer list, too|work=Business Standard|accessdate=19 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The business has expanded over the years to provide products and services like Retail Markets and Telecommunications. Reliance’s [[Jio]] has earned a top five spot in the country’s telecommunication services since its public launch on 5 September 2016.

As of 2016, Ambani was ranked 38 and has consistently held the title of being India's richest person on the Forbes magazine's list for the past ten years.&lt;ref name="Forbes20162"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/bill-gates-richest-man-in-world-mukesh-ambani-at-36th-forbes/articleshow/51213191.cms|title=Bill Gates richest man in world, Mukesh Ambani at 36th: Forbes|date=2 March 2016|work=The Economic Times|accessdate=17 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the only Indian businessman on ''[[Forbes]]''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' list of the world's most powerful people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/powerful-people/list/#tab:overall|title=The World's Most Powerful People|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of January 2018, Mukesh Ambani was ranked by Forbes as the 18th-wealthiest person in the world.

==Early life==

Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani was born on 19 April 1957 to Dhirubhai Ambani and Kokilaben Ambani in Aden, Yemen. He has three siblings, a younger brother, Anil Ambani and two sisters Dipti Salgaoncar and Nina Kothari.

Mukesh lived briefly in Yemen after his father decided to move back to India in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rediff.com/money/special/pix-special-how-dhirubhai-ambani-changed-the-idiom-of-doing-business/20150114.htm|title=How Dhirubhai Ambani changed the style of doing business in India|work=Rediff|access-date=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family moved from Yemen to India so that his father can start a business in trading spices which later shifted to a business in textiles originally named "Vimal" but later changed to "Only Vimal."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.truthofthoughts.com/life-story-of-mukesh-ambani/|title=Life story of Mukesh Ambani|website=www.truthofthoughts.com|language=en-US|access-date=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ambani family lived in a modest two-bedroom apartment in [[Bhuleshwar]], [[Mumbai]] until the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/money/2002/may/11ambani.htm |title=Reliance didn't grow on permit raj: Anil Ambani |publisher=Rediff.com |date=11 May 2002 |accessdate=28 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Life was initially hard for the Ambanis when they moved to India because Mukesh had to live in a communal society, use public transportation, and never received an allowance.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/15/business/worldbusiness/15ambani.html|title=Meet Mukesh Ambani: India’s Richest Man|last=Giridharadas|first=Anand|access-date=31 July 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dhirubhai later purchased a 14-floor apartment block called 'Sea Wind' in [[Colaba]], where, until recently, Mukesh and Anil lived with their families on different floors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/29/world/asia/29mumbai.html?ref=global&amp;pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | first=Jim | last=Yardley | title=Soaring Above India's Poverty, a 27-Story Home | date=28 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mukesh and his siblings were loosely monitored by their father and more by Mahendrabhai, who was their caretaker, during their childhood years. Growing up Mukesh played all kinds of sports like football and hockey, enjoyed annual trips to villages, and explored the different areas of Bombay, which is now renamed to Mumbai, all under the supervision of Mahendrabhai. Dhirubhai cared very little about Mukesh's grades, but he cared more so about his all-around performance.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rediff.com/money/interview/inter/20070117.htm|title=Mukesh Ambani on his childhood, youth|work=Rediff|access-date=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He attended the [[Hill Grange High School]] at [[Peddar Road]], Mumbai, along with his brother and where [[Anand Jain]], his close associate, was his classmate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://m.intoday.in/story/anand-jain-a-bone-of-contention-between-the-Ambani-brothers/1/194368.html Anand Jain: A bone of contention between the Ambani brothers]. India Today. 17 January 2005&lt;/ref&gt; He received his BE degree in Chemical Engineering from the [[Institute of Chemical Technology]](UDCT), [[Matunga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mukesh Ambani on his childhood, youth|url=http://www.rediff.com/money/2007/jan/17inter.htm|work=Mukesh Ambani on his childhood, youth|publisher=Rediff.com|accessdate=5 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mukesh later enrolled for an [[MBA]] at [[Stanford University]] but withdrew in 1980 to help his father build Reliance, which at the time was still a small but a fast growing enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Always invest in businesses of the future and in talent|url=http://www.rediff.com/money/2007/jan/17inter.htm|work=Rediff Business – Interview with Mukesh Ambani, 2007|publisher=Rediff.com|accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dhirubhai believed that real life skills were harnessed through experiences and not by sitting in a classroom, so he called Mukesh back to India from Stanford to take command of a yarn manufacturing project in his company.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Professors like [[William F. Sharpe]] and [[Man Mohan Sharma]] during Mukesh's college years, had an impact on him because they are "the kinds of professors who made you think out of the box."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Business career==
=== 1980s - 1990s ===
In 1980, the Indian government under [[Indira Gandhi]] opened PFY (polyester filament yarn) manufacturing to the private sector. Dhirubhai Ambani applied for a licence to set up a PFY manufacturing plant. Obtaining the licence was a long-drawn-out process requiring a strong connection within the bureaucracy system because the government, at the time, was restricting large-scale manufacturing, making the importation of yarn for the textiles impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://spontaneousorder.in/india-before-1991-stories-of-life-under-the-license-raj-bfd108e6055b|title=India Before 1991: Stories of Life Under the License Raj|date=30 March 2016|work=Spontaneous Order|access-date=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of stiff competition from Tatas, Birlas and 43 others, Dhirubhai was awarded the licence, more commonly addressed as [[Licence Raj|License Raj]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/history2/78/Reliance-Industries-Ltd.html|title=Reliance Industries – Company Profile|work=Reliance Industries Ltd. – Company Profile, Information, Business Description, History, Background Information on Reliance Industries Ltd.

Mukesh then continued to work for Reliance and did not return to his university program after that. He led Reliance's backward integration, where companies own their suppliers to generate more revenue and improve efficiency, in 1981 from textiles into polyester fibers and further into petrochemicals, which the yarns were made from.&lt;ref name="aboutus2"/&gt; After joining the company with his father, Rasikbhai Meswani, who was the executive director at the time, was held responsible for Mukesh. Mukesh had been given the opportunity to contribute to the company from his first day where he would daily report to Rasikbhai and take orders from him. The company was being built from scratch with the principle of everybody contributing to the business and not heavily depend on selected individuals. This principle came into play after Rasikbhai's death in 1985 along with Dhirubhai suffering a stroke in 1986 when all the responsibility shifted to Mukesh and Anil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://wealthymatters.com/2011/02/04/mukesh-ambani-in-his-own-words/|title=Mukesh Ambani – In His Own Words|date=4 February 2011|work=wealthymatters|access-date=2 August 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mukesh Ambani set up Reliance Infocomm Limited (now [[Reliance Communications Limited]]), which was focused on information and communications technology initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcom.co.in/rcom/StoreLocator/press_release_detail.jsp?id=72|title=Reliance Infocomm Ushers a Digital Revolution in India|date=27 December 2002|work=Press Release by Reliance Infocomm|publisher=Reliance Communications|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723100615/http://www.rcom.co.in/rcom/StoreLocator/press_release_detail.jsp?id=72|archive-date=23 July 2013|dead-url=yes|accessdate=22 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 24, Mukesh was given charge of the construction of Patalganga petrochemical plant when the company was heavily investing in oil refinery and petrochemicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KRKa6WQD8dAC&amp;pg=PA362&amp;lpg=PA362&amp;dq=%22patalganga%22+%22mukesh%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8eCHeqYPSq&amp;sig=hSE5NRw17ISvpFQpZW9u591jRY4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiAqO-d-s7cAhUn5YMKHQjOBDIQ6AEwCXoECAEQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22patalganga%22%20%22mukesh%22&amp;f=false|title=Family Business|last=Poza|first=Ernesto J.|date=29 January 2009|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=032459769X|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mukesh's father treated him as a business partner allowing him the freedom to contribute even with little experience.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/15/business/worldbusiness/15ambani.html|title=Meet Mukesh Ambani: India’s Richest Man|last=Giridharadas|first=Anand|access-date=4 August 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He elected to do this even as RIL's total remuneration packages to its top management personnel increased during that fiscal year.

'''Olivia Taaffe ''' (June 24, 1832 – May 3, 1918), was the founder of St Joseph's Young Priests Society.

==Early life==

Taaffe was born Olivia Mary Blake on 24 June 1832 in Annagh House, near [[Tuam]], Co. Galway, [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] to John Joseph Blake and Elizabeth Bodkin. She was born with a twin brother who did not survive. Her father and mother both came from well to do Catholic families. However shortly after her birth her mother died. She and her sister were raised by two aunts and their grandmother and moved between the family homes in the country and [[Dublin]], living occasionally with cousins. Taaffe was educated at home by French governesses and finished her education in [[Paris]]. Her sister went on to become a teacher, Sr Mary Ignatius of the [[Presentation Sisters]] in [[Midleton]].&lt;ref name="Cambridge University Press"&gt;{{cite web | title=Dictionary of Irish Biography | website=Cambridge University Press | url=http://dib.cambridge.org/viewReadPage.do?articleId=a8437&amp;searchClicked=clicked&amp;quickadvsearch=yes | access-date=2018-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Irish Identity 1918"&gt;{{cite web | title=Olivia Mary Taaffe and Smarmore | website=Irish Identity | date=1918-05-03 | url=http://www.irishidentity.com/extras/clergy/stories/taaffe.htm | access-date=2018-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Independent 2018"&gt;{{cite web | author=Unknown | title=Archbishop honours Olivia Mary Taaffe | website=Independent.ie | date=2018-06-02 | url=https://www.independent.ie/regionals/droghedaindependent/localnotes/archbishop-honours-olivia-mary-taaffe-36954382.html | access-date=2018-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mullarkey 2018"&gt;{{cite web | last=Mullarkey | first=Jarlath | title=Olivia Mary Taaffe | website=Milltown Heritage Group | date=2018-02-05 | url=https://milltown.galwaycommunityheritage.org/content/people/olivia-mary-taaffe-3 | access-date=2018-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Archive 2016"&gt;{{cite web | title=Olivia Mary Taaffe, 1832-1918 : foundress of St. Joseph's Young Priests Society : Gaughan, J.

May 29, 1867 she married John Joseph Taaffe of [[Smarmore Castle]] Co. Louth in St. Michael's Church, [[Dún Laoghaire]]. They toured Europe for their honeymoon and had an audience with [[Pope Pius IX]]. Taaffe ran her husband's estate and was a generous benefactor to the local widows and orphans especially in the period after a minor famine in 1879. Her popularity helped keep tensions reduced during the land wars in the 1880s.&lt;ref name="Cambridge University Press"/&gt; Taaffe had a shrine including a stained glass window in honour of St Joseph erected in the local church of St Catherine's, Ballapousta near [[Ardee]].&lt;ref name="Irish Identity 1918"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Independent 2018"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Archdiocese of Armagh 2016"&gt;{{cite web | title=MASS TO HONOUR OLIVIA MARY TAAFFE – FOUNDER OF ST JOSEPH’S YOUNG PRIESTS SOCIETY | website=Archdiocese of Armagh | date=2016-09-01 | url=https://www.armagharchdiocese.org/mass-honour-olivia-mary-taaffe-founder-st-josephs-young-priests-society/ | access-date=2018-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mullarkey 2018"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Archive 2016"/&gt;

Her husband always suffered with ill health and died in 1890. Her only son George Robert died of [[tuberculosis]] in 1894 after his mother took him to [[Switzerland]] in an attempt to help him. Because the lands of her husband were entailed his nephew was the new heir to the estates and Taaffe was left homeless and with a limited income. Initially she moved into the Presentation convent in [[Lucan]] but she had no intention of becoming a nun. She still had a certain income of her own and used it to move to Dublin. Having spent years involved in charity work, Taaffe focused on it now. From 1867 she had been a friend of Canon [[Joseph Léon Roy]]. He had established an archconfraternity and shrine for St. Joseph at [[Maranville]], [[France]]. After becoming a widow Taaffe became the administrator and secretary of the Irish branch. She mostly lived in Dublin after that.&lt;ref name="Cambridge University Press"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Irish Identity 1918"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Independent 2018"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Archdiocese of Armagh 2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mullarkey 2018"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Archive 2016"/&gt;

In 1895 she arranged for the publication of an Irish edition of the association's magazine and created what went on to become St Joseph's Young Priests Society. They educated young Irish men who wanted to become priests in Asia. Taaffe ensured support of the organisation with successful fund raising events.&lt;ref name="Cambridge University Press"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Independent 2018"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Archdiocese of Armagh 2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mullarkey 2018"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Archive 2016"/&gt; Her work in establishing the society with Fr Browne and Fr Darlington, the first editors of the magazine, were so successful that the organisation expanded from being able to fund the education of the original 2 men to 36 men by 1923 and had over 100,000 members by 1997 and funded 711 young men.&lt;ref name="Cambridge University Press"/&gt;

Taaffe died on May 3, 1918. She is buried with her husband and son at the graveyard at St Catherine's church, Ballapousta, Ardee.&lt;ref name="Irish Identity 1918"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Independent 2018"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mullarkey 2018"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Archive 2016"/&gt;

'''Oscar Schutte Teale''' (September 9, 1847 - April 8, 1934) was an American [[architect]], [[Magic (illusion)|magician]] and writer.

==Biography==

Teale was born in [[New York City]]. He worked as an architect by trade and was interested in magic. He was the fourth President of the [[Society of American Magicians]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themagicdetective.com/2011/10/mysteries-of-houdini-grave.html "Mysteries of the Houdini Grave"]. The Magic Detective.&lt;/ref&gt; He worked as a private secretary for magician [[Harry Houdini]].&lt;ref&gt;Kalush, William; Sloman, Larry. (2006). ''The Secret Life of Houdini: The Making of America's First Superhero''. Atria Books. p. 467. {{ISBN|978-0-7432-7207-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote a series of articles on magic and debunking [[spiritualism]] in the ''[[The Sphinx: An Independent Magazine for Magicians|Sphinx]]'' magazine in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;Willis, Martin. (2016 edition). ''Vision, Science and Literature, 1870-1920: Ocular Horizons''. Routledge. p. 221. {{ISBN|978-1-84893-234-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1925 it was alleged that Houdini and Teale visited the offices of [[Houdina Radio Control]] and damaged most of the furniture by smashing them against the floor and walls. Houdini had accused the company of using his name unlawfully.&lt;ref&gt;Shimeld, Thomas J. (2003). ''Walter B. Gibson and The Shadow''. McFarland. p. 54. {{ISBN|0-7864-2361-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; A summons for disorderly conduct was issued against Houdini but the charges were dropped because George Young the manager failed to appear in court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://houdini.intervalmagic.com/articles/1925_08.05.html "Houdini Discharged in Court"]. The New York Times. August, 1925.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://techbias.com/2016/11/houdini-smashed-up-the-office-of-the-guy-who-invented-the-first-driverless-car/ "Houdini Smashed Office of First DriverLess Car's Inventor"]. TechBias.&lt;/ref&gt;

Teale worked as an editor, illustrator and [[Ghostwriter|ghost writer]] for Houdini. He stated that Houdini contributed fragments to his books but the majority of the writing was done by hirelings.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, Kenneth. (1996). ''Houdini!: The Career of Ehrich Weiss''. HarperCollins Publishers. p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; When Houdini's book ''A Magician Among the Spirits'' (1924) was published, Teale stated that he had written "the damnable work".&lt;ref&gt;Cox, Clinton. (2002). ''Houdini: Master of Illusion''. Scholastic. p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;

Teale designed the [[exedra]] monument for Houdini's family. In October, 1916 it was  installed at [[Machpelah Cemetery (Queens)|Machpelah Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.compumagic.com/sam35/newsletters/northatlanticnewsletterspring2014.pdf "The Society of American Magicians North Atlantic Region Newsletter"]. S. A. M. North Atlantic Region. Spring, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wildabouthoudini.com/2016/10/the-houdini-weiss-exedra-turns-100.html "The Houdini-Weiss exedra turns 100"]. Wild About Harry.&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected into the Society of American Magicians Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.samhalloffame.com/members/ "The Hall"]. Society of American Magicians Hall of Fame and Magic Museum, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was released on 26 December 2006, after receiving a month reduction on his sentence - less than the time remaining to serve - as part of a holiday amnesty.

'''Porcupine''' (c. 1848–1929) was a [[Cheyenne]] chief and [[medicine man]].  He is best known for bringing the [[Ghost Dance]] religion to the Cheyenne.  Raised with the [[Sioux]] of a Cheyenne mother, he married a Cheyenne himself and became a warrior in the Cheyenne [[Dog Soldiers]].

Porcupine fought against the U.S. in Hancock's War in 1867 in which the Cheyenne resisted moving to a reservation.  Porcupine's group was pursued by the [[7th Cavalry Regiment|7th Cavalry]] from Kansas to Nebraska.  In Nebraska he succeeded in derailing and wrecking a train, the first time this had been done by Indians.  At the conclusion of the [[Great Sioux War of 1876]], the Cheyenne surrendered and were deported to Oklahoma.  Porcupine took part in the [[Northern Cheyenne Exodus]] in which a part of the starving tribe fought their way back to their homeland in Montana.  Porcupine was one of a group of Cheyennes who were subsequently arrested on charges of murdering settlers as the Cheyennes crossed Kansas.  After spending most of 1879 in prison, the charges were dismissed without a full trial taking place.

In 1889, Porcupine undertook a long journey to visit [[Wovoka]] in Nevada.  Wovoka was the prophet of the new [[Ghost Dance]] religion.  Porcupine believed that Wovoka was the Messiah who would save the Indians and rid the continent of the white men.  Porcupine returned to preach the new religion to the Cheyennes and began baptising converts into his church.  The Ghost Dance spread throughout the plains tribes.  Fear of it led to it being suppressed by the U.S. army.  While the Cheyenne did not suffer tragedy on the scale of the Sioux at [[Wounded Knee Massacre|Wounded Knee]], Porcupine could only perform the dance in secret from 1890 onwards.  In 1900 he was imprisoned for attempting to revive the religion.

Porcupine, like Wovoka, preached peace and took no part in the violence associated with the Ghost Dance elsewhere.  He was a chief representing the Cheyenne in several treaty councils with the U.S., including leading a delegation to Washington.

At the end of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], the U.S. attempted to persuade the [[Plains Indians]] to live on [[Indian reservation|reservations]].  A number of simultaneous military expeditions were launched in pursuit of this policy under the overall control of [[Ulysses S. Grant|General Grant]].  General [[Winfield Scott Hancock]] commanded one such enterprise in [[West Kansas]].  Its chief, but not only, target was the [[Southern Cheyenne]] in the [[Smoky Hills]] region.  In April 1867, Hancock moved a large force to [[Fort Larned]] and demanded that Indian leaders meet him there.  The idea was to intimidate the Indians with a show of force.  He was warned by [[Edward W. Wynkoop]], the [[Indian agent]] for the [[Southern Cheyenne]] and [[Arapaho]], that this would be seen by the Indians as an aggressive act and was inappropriate for peace negotiations.  Hancock ignored this advice.&lt;ref name=Hancock&gt;{{multiref|O'Neill &amp; Robinson, pp. 40–42|Utley, pp. 111–120|Kraft, pp. 170–194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indians were wary of approaching the fort.  A joint camp of Southern Cheyenne and [[Oglala Sioux]] was established thirty miles away at Pawnee Fork.  A handful of Indians entered the fort, including [[Tall Bull]], leader of the Cheyenne [[Dog Soldiers]].  Hancock threatened them with war if they did not agree to his terms, but they responded by returning to their camp.  Angered that many Indian leaders had not met him, Hancock declared that if the Indians would not come to him, he would go to them and prepared to move his whole force to Pawnee Fork.  The Indian agents again warned him that this would be seen as aggression and was not a good idea.  The Indians attempted to stop Hancock approaching the camp by setting fire to the prairie but this failed.  Outside the camp there was a confrontation with the Cheyenne leader [[Roman Nose]].  Hancock spoke harshly to Roman Nose who then told his companion, Bull Bear, to ride away because he intended to kill Hancock in front of his soldiers and did not want Bull Bear to be killed in the inevitable hail of bullets that would follow.  Instead Bull Bear led Roman Nose away.  Hancock then ordered the camp to be captured, but on entering, it was found to be deserted.  The Indians, fearing a repeat of the [[Sand Creek massacre]], had already left and scattered.&lt;ref name=Hancock/&gt;

Hancock ordered [[George Armstrong Custer]] to take the [[7th Cavalry Regiment|7th Cavalry]] in pursuit.  This was Custer's first action in the Indian wars.  It was not very successful, the scattered Indians were hard to follow and when Custer stopped at [[Fort Hays]] for [[forage]] for his horses he found there was none to be had and he became stuck there.  On 19 April Hancock ordered the camp at Pawnee Fork to be destroyed in retaliation and sparked an Indian war,&lt;ref name=Hancock/&gt; unnecessarily so according to many commentators both contemporary and modern.&lt;ref&gt;Coates &amp; Kennedy, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the Indians being pursued by Custer from Pawnee Fork was the nineteen-year-old Porcupine.&lt;ref&gt;Marquis, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

===Train attack===
[[File:Union Pacific Railroad on the 100th meridian (cropped).jpg|thumb|Union Pacific train, 1866, near the location of Porcupine's attack]]
Porcupine fled northward from Custer with a companion, Red Wolf.  By the time they reached the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] near [[North Platte, Nebraska]], they had joined a band of Cheyenne led by Turkey Leg and Spotted Wolf.  Porcupine had the idea of attempting to stop or damage a train.&lt;ref name=DYK&gt;Marquis, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;  On 6 August 1867 Porcupine and Red Wolf placed a [[railroad tie]] across the track at a point three miles west of Plum Creek (now [[Lexington, Nebraska|Lexington]]) and tied it down with wire removed from the lineside telegraph line.  They lit a fire at sunset.  Two men, Pat Handerhan and William Thompson, were sent out on a [[handcar]] to investigate the failed telegraph line.  Distracted by the fire, they let the handcar hit the obstruction.  Porcupine and Red Wolf drove off the men with rifle fire but they were pursued and Handerhan was killed.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Marquis, citing Grinnell, says both Handerhan and Thompson were killed.  Presumably because the sources for both Marquis and Grinnell were Cheyennes, who, of course, thought that Thompson was dead.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thompson was wounded but [[apparent death|played dead]], even as he was being [[Scalping|scalped]], and survived.  Porcupine and Red Wolf found two [[Spencer carbine]]s in the handcar.  These were [[breech-loading weapon]]s which they did not understand, being familiar only with [[muzzle-loading rifle]]s.  On discovering that the rifles would swivel apart they discarded them as broken.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Simpson, pp. 241–242|McLaughlin, p. 63|Marquis, pp. 124–125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Encouraged by this success, the Indians then tried to do some more substantial damage to the track.  The rails were unfastened, lifted, bent aside and a more substantial barricade built.  Late into the night, early 7 August, two freight trains approached.  Some of the Indians came out of hiding and pursued the first train on horseback.  They fired at it and even attempted to stop it by [[lasso]]ing the engine.  This did not work of course, but it did have the effect of causing the train [[railroad engineer|engineer]], Brooks Bower, to apply full throttle to escape the Indians.  The train hit the damaged track at full speed.  Bower was thrown through the cab window and died.  The [[Fireman (steam engine)|fireman]], George Hendershot, was poised at the open door of the [[Firebox (steam engine)|firebox]] with shovel in hand ready to throw in more coal.  He was thrown inside the firebox and burnt to death.  The survivors of the train wreck retreated back to the second train, along with Thompson, who came out of hiding carrying his own scalp.  The train backed up to Plum Creek Station, picked up the residents there, and evacuated them to [[Elm Creek, Nebraska|Elm Creek]].  There was a failed attempt to reattach Thompson's scalp in [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]] and it is now in the public library there.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Marquis, p. 125|Simpson, pp. 242–243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the morning the train was thoroughly looted and then burned.  Bolts of [[calico]] from the train were tied to the tails of the warrior's ponies so that they unrolled into colourful flags.  These were taken back to their camp for the women there.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Marquis, p. 125|Simpson, p. 243}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Porcupine's actions that day had resulted in the first train derailment by Indians.&lt;ref&gt;Angevine, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt;

==Escape from Oklahoma==
Following the Indian surrender at the end of the [[Great Sioux War of 1876]], the Cheyennes were forcibly deported to reservations in Oklahoma.  There they found that the hunting grounds they had been allocated were devoid of the large game they needed to survive, and the supplies promised by the U.S. government failed to arrive, or were stolen by the Indian agents.  Facing starvation, chiefs [[Dull Knife]] and [[Little Wolf]] in 1878 led the [[Northern Cheyenne]] on an epic fighting journey back to their homeland in Montana, more than a thousand miles away.&lt;ref&gt;Powers &amp; Leiker, pp. 12, 76&lt;/ref&gt;  Porcupine took part in this [[Northern Cheyenne Exodus]].&lt;ref&gt;Marquis, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;  Dull Knife surrendered at [[Fort Robinson]] in Nebraska.  His band was imprisoned there and denied food and heating (with temperature well below freezing) for not agreeing to return to Oklahoma.  Nearly half were killed (but not Dull Knife himself) in a desperate escape from Fort Robinson.  Little Wolf surrendered in March 1879 at [[Fort Keogh]] in Montana. Little Wolf's band was permitted to stay and Dull Knife then joined them there.&lt;ref&gt;Powers &amp; Leiker, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Cheyenne-prisoners-Kansas.jpg|thumb|Porcupine (second from right) as a prisoner in Kansas 1879]]
A number of Kansas settlers had been killed during the Indians' journey north.  There were calls to put the whole band of Cheyenne on trial as a group, but this had dubious legal standing.  As a compromise, the military sent seven Indians, Wild Hog, a war chief of the Northern Cheyenne Elk warrior society,&lt;ref&gt;Hardorff, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; Porcupine, and five others (Old Crow, Tangled Hair, Blacksmith, Noisy Walker, and Strong Left Hand) for trial in a civilian court for these killings.  A number of items taken from homes in Kansas had been found in the Indians' possession.  They were sent to [[Fort Leavenworth]], Kansas at the beginning of 1879 to await trial.  They were to be tried in [[Dodge City]] and were escorted there by lawman [[Bat Masterson]].  It was not an easy journey; large, sometimes unruly, crowds turned out to view the Indians.  In [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]], Masterson found it necessary to hit the city marshal to keep order.  The trial began in Dodge City on 24 June.  The defence lawyer successfully argued that local prejudice would prevent a fair trial in Dodge City and requested the trial be moved to Lawrence, a request that was granted.&lt;ref group=note&gt;As well as Dodge City being closer to the scenes of the crimes, there was a distinct difference between the western frontier attitudes in West Kansas and the more city focused liberal attitudes in the east of the state, which was seen by West Kansans to aid the defence side (Powers &amp; Leiker, pp. 92–93).&lt;/ref&gt;  The defence built a case intended to expose the iniquities of the reservation system.  They intended to embarrass Washington, and had issued subpoenas for, amongst others, General [[Nelson Miles]], General [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope]], and Secretary of the Interior [[Carl Schurz]].  Meanwhile, the prosecution was having problems persuading witnesses to make the long journey to Lawrence.  When the chief prosecutor failed to turn up on 13 October, all charges were dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;Powers &amp; Leiker, pp. 91–94&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ghost Dance apostle==
The [[Ghost Dance]] religion was founded by its prophet [[Wovoka]] in Nevada, a [[Northern Paiute|Paiute]] Indian who had a vision on 1 January 1889 during a solar eclipse.  In this vision, he was taken up to heaven and given a dance (the Ghost Dance) to pass on to the Indians to ensure their place in heaven.&lt;ref&gt;Mooney, pp. 771–772, 774&lt;/ref&gt;  Wovoka's religion was heavily influenced by Christianity.  He predicted that a Messiah figure,&lt;ref group=note&gt;Wovoka was often accused in newspapers of claiming to be Christ.  When interviewed by Mooney, he made no such claim, only claiming to be the prophet of the Messiah with the power, given him directly by God while he was in heaven, of being able to control the weather (Mooney, p. 773).  However, many of his followers, including Porcupine, clearly believed that he was the Messiah, Christ returned to Earth (Mooney, pp. 784–785, 795–796).&lt;/ref&gt; identified with the Christian Jesus, would come to Earth and resurrect all the Indian dead.  All the whites would be removed from Earth and the buffalo would return.&lt;ref group=note&gt;By the 1880s, [[buffalo hunting]] had driven the species to near extinction.  As they were the main food source for the Indians as [[hunter-gatherers]], they were no longer able to sustain this lifestyle on the plains and were forced to remain on the reservations.&lt;/ref&gt;  Wovoka predicted that this would happen in Spring 1891.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Wovoka originally predicted the resurrection to occur in the Autumn of 1890 (Mooney, p. 796; Marquis, p. 130).  This needed to be adjusted as that date passed.  See Marquis (Marquis, pp. 130–131) for even later resurgences of this religion.  See Hittman (Hittman, pp. 259–267) for a list of newspaper accounts of continuing Ghost Dance activity running into the mid-1920s.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the meantime, according to Wovoka's preaching, the Indians were not to fight the whites, but were to perform the Ghost Dance.&lt;ref&gt;Marquis, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Arapaho Ghost Dance, 1900 - NARA - 530915.jpg|thumb|Arapahoes performing the Ghost Dance, 1900, based on photographs by James Mooney]]
In November 1889 Porcupine led a Cheyenne mission to visit the [[Arapahoe]]s in Wyoming.  His companions were Grasshopper, and a younger third Indian.  In Wyoming, Porcupine repurposed the enterprise and went on to Nevada to see Wovoka.  They stayed over the winter and returned in the spring of 1890.  Porcupine's report to the tribal council of chiefs took five days to deliver.  At the end of that time he was given permission to promulgate Wovoka's teaching amongst the tribe.  Thus, Porcupine became the main apostle of the Ghost Dance amongst the Cheyennes.&lt;ref&gt;Marquis, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;  Porcupine preached that Wovoka was the Messiah and a Christ figure.&lt;ref&gt;Mooney, pp. 795–796 citing Porupine's statement to Major Carroll&lt;/ref&gt;

Porcupine describes the visit to Wovoka as a fortuitous side benefit of the visit to the Arapahoes.  He mentions only the Cheyenne delegation as if they came alone.  However, [[James Mooney]], an ethnologist tasked by the U.S. government with investigating the Ghost Dance and who travelled far and wide to interview all the principals in the tribes concerned, including Wovoka himself, tells a different story.  Porcupine's delegation was part of a larger, organised mission, perhaps a dozen people, sent out by a conference of chiefs at [[Fort Washakie]] in Wyoming with the explicit purpose of obtaining information about the new religion.  The mission included delegates from the Sioux, Cheyenne, Arapahoe, and [[Shoshoni]].  It seems likely that the Arapahoe visit was a cover story to make easier obtaining permission from the Indian agent to leave the reservation.  U.S. soldiers guarding the reservation were under orders to stop anyone from leaving without a permit.&lt;ref name="Stands in Timber 61"&gt;Stands in Timber, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;  Porcupine, however, travelled without a permit until he reached [[Fort Hall Indian Reservation]] in Idaho where he was given one by the Indian agent there.&lt;ref&gt;Mooney, pp. 793–794&lt;/ref&gt;  At Fort Hall, more Shoshoni and [[Bannock Indians]] joined them.  The Indian agent at [[Pyramid Lake Indian Reservation]] in Nevada reported that the strength of the party was thirty-four as they passed through.  Porcupine says that all the Indians they met after Fort Hall were already performing the Ghost Dance, and that many whites (these would be mostly [[Mormons]] in Nevada)&lt;ref group=note&gt;See Hittman for a discussion on the possible connection between the ghost shirts of the Sioux and Mormon holy garments, a theory first proposed by Mooney (Hittman, pp. 84–88).&lt;/ref&gt; were also dancing.&lt;ref&gt;Mooney, pp. 817–818&lt;/ref&gt;

===White reaction===
[[File:Burial Party Wounded Knee.jpg|thumb|Burying the dead after the Wounded Knee Massacre]]
The Ghost Dance religion was not limited to the Cheyennes.  It spread throughout the plains tribes.  Settlers living close to reservations became concerned that it would lead to a new Indian uprising and called on the army to intervene.  Indian dances had been made illegal by the Indian Religious Crimes Code, 1883, and remained so until 1934.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford &amp; Kelley, p. 211&lt;/ref&gt;  White fear of the movement resulted in confrontation between the army and the Sioux and led to the killing of the [[Hunkpapa]] Sioux chief [[Sitting Bull]] and the [[Wounded Knee Massacre]] in December 1890.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The Ghost Dance religion had lost some of its peaceful nature amongst the Sioux.  The [[ghost shirt]]s of the Sioux warriors were supposed to repel bullets.  Wovoka disclaimed any connection to the ghost shirts (Mooney, p. 772).&lt;/ref&gt;  At Porcupine's location on the Northern Cheyenne reservation, reinforcements were sent from [[Fort Keogh]] to the [[Lame Deer]] agency.  The army sent Sgt. Willis Rowland, a mixed-blood Cheyenne-white scout, to gather intelligence on Porcupine's preaching.  Rowland joined Porcupine's church and was baptised into it.  Rowland disliked the deceitfulness of his mission; "I hated to do this, but it seemed like it was the best way."  After three days, he reported back to his superiors that Porcupine's preaching was entirely peaceful and that nobody was talking about fighting whites.&lt;ref&gt;Marquis, pp. 129–130&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, the Ghost Dance was stopped by the government.&lt;ref name="Stands in Timber 61"/&gt;  The Northern Cheyenne sometimes succeeded in holding an illegal Ghost Dance by convincing soldiers trying to break it up that it was some different dance.&lt;ref&gt;Stands in Timber, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;

Some time after the Ghost Dance was stopped, Porcupine moved to the [[Oglala Lakota|Oglala]] Sioux [[Pine Ridge Indian Reservation]].  The Sioux and Cheyennes had always been on friendly terms and had been allies in battle before the Cheyenne surrender.  Porcupine himself was half Sioux.  However, after Wounded Knee Porcupine and sixty others were temporarily moved to the Northern Cheyenne Reservation; many Cheyenne were in the army as scouts and it was felt they would not be safe at Pine Ridge.  They became caught in a bureaucratic trap there.  Porcupine believed that they should have been paid their share of the money from the enforced sale of reservation land in South Dakota to the government in 1889.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The sale of the Sioux reservation land was instigated by President Harrison, keen to create two new Republican voting states, he needed the Indian land to make the newly created South Dakota state viable with enough room for settlement.  The Indians had previously successfully opposed such a sale, but then Harrison sent a commission headed by General [[George Crook]] to ensure it happened.  According to treaty, 75% of adult male Indians had to agree to a treaty change, which was needed for the land sale.  Crook used a raft of dubious methods to gain the necessary signatures.  He threatened that the land would be taken anyway and that they would then get nothing, he made promises that he was in no position to keep, and he kept hostile chiefs away from the talks.  He even allowed non-Indians to sign the petition to artificially boost the numbers.&lt;/ref&gt;  They did not get it because they were no longer on the roll at Pine Ridge, even though their move was only supposed to be temporary ("a visit" as Cheyenne tribal historian John Stands in Timber puts it).  Some of them were paid after a wait of a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Stands in Timber, pp. 144–145, 151, 250|Richardson, pp. 95–106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ghost Dance religion faded when the Messiah and the resurrection of the dead failed to appear as predicted.  It did not, however, die completely and a rump remains into the present day.  Porcupine tried to revive the religion in 1900.  Indian agent James C. Clifford gathered a petition from Northern Cheyennes demanding that he be imprisoned.  Porcupine was arrested in October and given hard labour at Fort Keogh.  He was released on 28 February 1901 on promising to behave.&lt;ref&gt;Marquis, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1918 there was a Messianic inspired attempt to organise a revolt on the Northern Cheyenne reservation.  Whites at the agency were afraid enough to carry guns at all times and stockpile ammunition.  However, the attempt was nipped in the bud with strongly worded threats to the Indians.  Porcupine took no part in this, or any other, Messiah-connected attempted rebellions.  He remained peaceful throughout the period.&lt;ref&gt;Marquis, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political leader==
Porcupine was a chief of the Northern Cheyenne but never recognised as such by the U.S. government, probably because of his connection to the Ghost Dance.&lt;ref&gt;Marquis, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;  He was also a powerful [[medicine man]]; according to Marquis he had more influence than the highest status medicine man in the tribe, the Keeper of the Sacred Tepee.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;Marguis, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;   He was involved in four separate treaty councils with the U.S.  He says that all four treaties had later been abrogated by the U.S.  The most troubling of these was the U.S. reneging on the treaty agreement over the [[Black Hills]] after gold was discovered there.  The dispute over the Black Hills was the cause of the 1876 war.  Porcupine was the spokesman for a Cheyenne delegation to Washington during the presidency of [[Benjamin Harrison]] (1889–1893).  The purpose was to seek reparations for treaty violations.&lt;ref&gt;Marquis, pp. 133–134&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character==
Porcupine in his preaching phase was clearly a very different person to the young warrior.  Historian [[Thomas B. Marquis]] who met and wrote about Porcupine said, {{blockquote|As a "bad Indian" he was of the most gentle type.  The high regard for him was not restricted to his own people ... Even the missionaries liked him, their only condemnation being that he was an apostle of paganism.&lt;ref&gt;Marquis, pp. 131–132&lt;/ref&gt;|author=Thomas B. Marquis}}

Porcupine had two sons.  Both died of [[tuberculosis]], a common disease amongst the Cheyenne of the reservation period, for which they had little resistance.  Porcupine died in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;Marquis, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ron Terpening''' (born Ronnie Harold Terpening on May 3, 1946) is an American writer, [[professor]] of Italian, and [[editing|editor]].  Though he started his writing career as an author of young-adult fiction, where the father/son conflict is a major theme, he is best known for his later novels of suspense, most of which are set, at least in part, in Italy, reflecting his academic background as a scholar of Italian culture. His thriller ''League of Shadows'', for example, deals with the Fascist Era in Italy and its aftermath in the contemporary world.&lt;ref&gt;In an interview, Terpening stated that he first learned of Mussolini’s secret police, the [[OVRA]], the focus of the novel’s historical episodes, when he designed a course on [[Benito Mussolini]] and [[Italian Fascism|Fascism]]. See [http://www.ronterpening.com/novels/league_interv.htm Ronterpening.com] and the last question in his interview for ''The Turning'': [http://www.ronterpening.com/novels/turning_interv.htm Ronterpening.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  A later international thriller, ''Nine Days in October'', came out of the author’s course research on the forces of order and disorder in contemporary Italy&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.ronterpening.com/novels/nine_interv.htm Ronterpening.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and follows a band of criminals and ex-terrorists as they attempt to carry out an assassination plot. All of his novels, including ''Storm Track'' and ''Tropic of Fear'', the latter set in [[Paraguay]], are noted for their strong sense of place.&lt;ref&gt;See Terpening’s interview for ''Tropic of Fear'': [http://www.ronterpening.com/novels/tropic_interv.htm Ronterpening.com]&lt;/ref&gt; In most of his novels, his protagonist is usually a common man placed in a situation where powerful forces are arrayed against him.

While his novels take place in the modern era, Terpening’s academic research has focused on Italian authors of the Renaissance, most notably the Venetian Humanist [[Lodovico Dolce]], although he has also published a study of the infernal boatman [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]] and numerous articles on other writers of the 15th and 16th centuries. His editing work has ranged from text books, mostly anthologies of Italian literature, to broad studies of Italian culture.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Terpening was born in [[Bellingham, Washington]] in 1946, second son of Harold Russell and Darlene Elizabeth Terpening. His father was a Protestant minister and an evangelist who started several churches in the state of Washington.&lt;ref name="Contemporary Authors 2006"&gt;''Contemporary Authors'', Detroit: Cengage, 2006, vol. 248.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:ronterpening-1989.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Ron Terpening, [[Tucson]], 1989. &lt;!--Photo by Newton Sanders--&gt;]]

After living in [[Birch Bay, Washington|Birch Bay]], [[Pateros, Washington|Pateros]], and [[Moses Lake, Washington|Moses Lake]], Washington, Terpening attended grade school in [[Ferndale, Washington|Ferndale]], [[Warden, Washington|Warden]], [[Wenatchee, Washington|Wenatchee]], and [[Seattle]] (in Washington state) and [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] and [[Gresham, Oregon|Gresham]] (in [[Oregon]]). He graduated from Gresham Union High School in 1964.&lt;ref name="bio4"&gt;{{cite web|author=Ron Terpening |url=http://www.ronterpening.com/meet_ron/bio4aron.htm |title=The Official Web Site of Suspense Novelist Ron Terpening |publisher=Ronterpening.com |date= |accessdate=2009-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Charon and the crossing.jpg|thumb|180px|upright|''Charon and the Crossing'']]
Terpening completed his undergraduate work at the [[University of Oregon]] in [[Eugene, Oregon|Eugene]] (B.A. Romance Languages, Honors College, 1969), where he was inducted into the [[Phi Beta Kappa]] national [[honor society]]. He spent his Sophomore year in [[Pavia]], Italy, and lived in [[Mexico City]] for one year. His semi-autobiographical novel ''In Light’s Delay'' narrates several events of those years (1966–1968).&lt;ref&gt;See the Author’s Note in the preface to ''In Light’s Delay'' (Tucson: Desert Bloom Press, 1988).&lt;/ref&gt; In his youth, Terpening held a variety of jobs while attending school and first beginning to write fiction: he serviced vehicles in a dairy, worked in a berry growers cannery, on a cement gang in construction, as a striper of panels in a [[Georgia-Pacific]] veneer plant, a crew dispatcher for [[Southern Pacific Railroad]], a housekeeping aide in [[Herrick Hospital]] ([[Berkeley, California]]), a mail handler for the U.S. Postal System in Oakland, and a teacher.&lt;ref&gt;Back cover copy, ''In Light’s Delay'' (Tucson: Desert Bloom Press, 1988).&lt;/ref&gt;

He completed his Master’s (1973) and Ph.D. in Italian (1978) at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. His revised dissertation was later published as ''Charon and the Crossing: Ancient, Medieval, and Renaissance Transformations of a Myth'' (Lewisburg: Bucknell UP; London and Toronto: Associated University Presses, 1985). The illustrated book was the first comprehensive study of the underworld boatman [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]] as found in the literary tradition from pre-Homeric texts through the early Baroque period in Italy. [[Thomas G. Bergin]] ([[Yale University]]) said that the book, “in grace of an engaging style and a never flagging interest in [the] subject, makes for lively reading.”&lt;ref&gt;''Annali d’Italianistica'', vol. 3 (1985), p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career===
[[File:Lodovico dolce.jpg|thumb|left|180px|''Lodovico Dolce'']]

Terpening taught Italian for four years at [[Loyola University of Chicago]] (1978–1982). He worked as an editorial assistant for John Tedeschi on two volumes of the ''Bibliographie Internationale de l’Humanisme et de la Renaissance'' and was a research fellow of the Mabelle McLeod Lewis Memorial Fund, [[The Renaissance Society of America]], the [[American Council of Learned Societies]], and the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] in conjunction with the [[Newberry Library]].&lt;ref&gt;Back cover, ''Charon and the Crossing''.&lt;/ref&gt;
He also received a fellowship from the American Association of Teachers of Italian to study at the [[University for Foreigners Perugia|Università Italiana per Stranieri di Perugia]] (Italy), in 1981.

From 1982-2008, Terpening was a professor in the Department of French and Italian at the [[University of Arizona]], where he introduced a new option in Italian Studies for the bachelor's degree, a program that covered Italian culture from prehistoric times to the present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w3.coh.arizona.edu/french/liens/S08/Terpening.html |title=Liens-Legami-Links |publisher=W3.coh.arizona.edu |date= |accessdate=2009-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; He directed the Arizona Study Abroad Program in Florence, Italy, in 1987, and was co-acting head of the department in 1996. Beginning in 1986, he also served on the editorial board of ''New Connections: Studies in Interdisciplinarity''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.u.arizona.edu/~terp |title=Ron Terpening |publisher=U.arizona.edu |date= |accessdate=2009-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author of numerous scholarly articles and reviews dealing with Italian and Spanish literature, he published his second academic book, ''[[Lodovico Dolce]]: Renaissance Man of Letters'', in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;''Lodovico Dolce: Renaissance Man of Letters'' (Toronto, Buffalo, London: University of Toronto Press, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; He is also the author and editor of several academic texts, most notably a pseudonymous study ''Beautiful Italy, Beloved Shores. An Illustrated Cultural History of Italy'', Vol. 1: ''From Prehistoric Times to the Fall of the Roman Empire'' and two anthologies of [[Italian literature]] with text in Italian and notes in {{nowrap|English.&lt;ref&gt;Gerret Lambertzen &amp; Sarah Rapalje-Bergen [pseudonyms], ''Beautiful Italy, Beloved Shores. An Illustrated Cultural History of Italy'', Vol. 1: ''From Prehistoric Times to the Fall of the Roman Empire'' (Cortaro: Desert Bloom Press, 201), 236 pp., with accompanying CD; ''Anthology of Italian Literature'', edited with annotations by Ronnie H. Terpening, Vol. 1: Middle Ages and Renaissance (Cortaro: Desert Bloom Press, 2002, 2nd revised edition, 2006), 434 and 488 pp., and Vol. 2: From the Seventeenth Through the Twentieth Century (Cortaro: Desert Bloom Press, 2005), 546 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; His}} scholarly articles deal with authors such as [[Giovanni Boccaccio]], [[Angelo Poliziano]], [[Pietro Bembo]], [[Giordano Bruno]], [[Miguel de Cervantes]], and [[Giambattista Marino]].&lt;ref&gt;For reviews of these and other articles, see

Terpening retired in 2008 and is now a [[professor emeritus]] of Italian at the University of Arizona.

==Novels==

===Young adult fiction===
Terpening began his first novel (''In Light’s Delay'') while an undergraduate at the [[University of Oregon]] in the late 60s, where he also worked as a features reporter for the ''[[Oregon Daily Emerald]]''. He completed his second novel (''The Echoes of Our Two Hearts'', unpublished) as a graduate student at Berkeley. A third novel, ''The Turning'', was released in 2001 and serves as the first volume in this trilogy of young-adult novels.&lt;ref name="bio4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lights"&gt;{{cite web|author=Ron Terpening |url=http://www.ronterpening.com/novels/lights_interv.htm |title=The Official Web Site of Suspense Novelist Ron Terpening |publisher=Ronterpening.com |date= |accessdate=2009-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="turning"&gt;{{cite web|author=Ron Terpening |url=http://www.ronterpening.com/novels/turning_interv.htm |title=The Official Web Site of Suspense Novelist Ron Terpening |publisher=Ronterpening.com |date=2000-09-06 |accessdate=2009-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''In Light’s Delay'' is the story of a young man’s quest for self-discovery and love in the mid-1960s. The novel depicts the experiences of Doug Herman and his friends over the course of ten nights, at different times and places, as it follows Doug from the family farm in Oregon to a series of adventures in Italy, Mexico, and back in California.&lt;ref&gt;back cover copy, ''In Light’s Delay'' (Tucson: Desert Bloom Press, 1988)&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Turning'', a [[coming-of-age]] tale, tells the story of Artie Crenshaw, a teenager with an abusive father. At his job one night, Artie decides to postpone going home, and the events that follow as a result of this decision cause him more trouble but ultimately help spur his progression towards manhood. Karen Hoth, writing in the ''[[School Library Journal]]'', praised the “well-written story,” proclaiming the characters “well developed” and the book itself “touching.”&lt;ref&gt;''Contemporary Authors'', vol. 248; see also ''School Library Journal'', vol. 47, no. 4 (April 2001), p. 151, where Karen Hoth (Marathon Middle/High School, Florida) concludes by noting: “Set in the 1960s in a small town in Oregon, this quiet story is a touching tale about a teenager caught between adolescence and manhood. The plot develops consistently throughout the evening, and the characters are believable and well developed. This well-written story conveys the seriousness of the issues and will find a wide audience.”&lt;/ref&gt; The book was selected for inclusion on [[The New York Public Library]]’s ''2002 Books For The Teen Age List,'' the “best of the previous year’s publishing for teenagers,” by the Pennsylvania School Librarians Association for their ''Top Forty Young-Adult Novels'' for 2001, and by Appleton North High School ([[Appleton, Wisconsin]]) for their ''Top 25 Recommended Reading'' (2002).&lt;ref name="turning" /&gt;

===Suspense===
Inspired by the suspense fiction he was reading (notably [[Clive Cussler]], [[Robert Ludlum]], [[Jack Higgins]], and [[David Morrell]]), Terpening began work on a thriller while teaching at Loyola University of Chicago, where he used the [[Chicago Public Library]] for technical research.

====Storm Track====
His first published thriller, ''Storm Track'' (New York: Walker &amp; Company, 1989), was inspired, in part, by Cussler’s ''Mediterranean Caper''. As part of the research for this book, Terpening became a certified [[scuba diver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ron Terpening |url=http://www.ronterpening.com/novels/stormtrack_interv.htm |title=The Official Web Site of Suspense Novelist Ron Terpening |publisher=Ronterpening.com |date=1993-08-25 |accessdate=2009-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Storm Track'' tells the story of a commercial oil-field diver, working on a [[jack-up]] off the coast of [[Tunisia]], where his wife is killed in a terrorist attack. William C. McCully (Park Ridge Public Library, Illinois), writing in ''[[Library Journal]]'', praised the thriller’s “non-stop action” and “breathtaking pace,” as well as its settings in Italy, [[Sicily]], [[Malta]], and [[Tunisia]].&lt;ref&gt;William C. McCully, ''Library Journal'' (April 15, 1989).&lt;/ref&gt; And Suzy Smith, author of ''The Afterlife Codes'', ''The Book of James'', and ''Ghost Writers in the Sky,'' in ''The Write Word'', called Terpening “the next [[Ken Follett]].”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ron Terpening |url=http://www.ronterpening.com/novels/stormtrack_rev.htm |title=The Official Web Site of Suspense Novelist Ron Terpening |publisher=Ronterpening.com |date= |accessdate=2009-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====League of Shadows====
[[File:League of shadows.jpg|thumb|180px|right|''League of Shadows'']]
Terpening’s second thriller, ''League of Shadows'' (2005), was a contemporary novel of intrigue with an extensive back story that takes place in Italy during the [[Italian Fascism|Fascist Era]].&lt;ref&gt;For a visual presentation on Fascist symbols and ideology, see [http://www.ronterpening.com/extras/fasc_symb.htm Ronterpening.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The historical scenes depict the efforts of three spies in 1943 to infiltrate Italian leader [[Benito Mussolini]]’s secret police, the [[OVRA]]. Decades after that intrigue went horribly wrong, an unknown enemy begins to hunt down the former secret agents, and their one hope for survival is an ex-cop obsessed with his mission. The [[Midwest Book Review]] called the novel “an addictive read, weaving together human drive, determination, and betrayal into a gripping whole”,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.midwestbookreview.com/sbw/ The Midwest Book Review], Small Press Bookwatch, The Fiction Shelf (December 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; while Lucille Cormier, in ''The Historical Novels Review'', said that “You can race through this suspense thriller riding the whirlwind of drug busts, jungle guerrilla attacks, gun fights, assassinations, and love affairs right into the breathtaking climax. Or, if you are disciplined enough, you can turn each page slowly and savor the extraordinary visual and historical detail Ron Terpening has painted into his complex story. Either way, you are in for a treat. This is a book to add to every collection of [[historical fiction]].”&lt;ref&gt;''The Historical Novels Review'', no. 31 (February 2005), p. 38. See also Joel Tscherne (Cleveland Public Library), in ''Library Journal'', vol. 129, no. 20 (December 2004), pp. 103-104.&lt;/ref&gt; Joel Tscherne (Cleveland Public Library) noted in ''[[Library Journal]]'' that this is a novel that “fans of [[Jack Higgins]]’s [[Thriller (genre)|thrillers]] will enjoy.”&lt;ref&gt;''Library Journal'', vol. 129, no. 20 (December 2004), pp. 103-104.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tropic of Fear====
Influenced by movies such as [[Costa Gavras]]’s ''[[State of Siege]]'' (1973) and books such as [[Robert Stone (novelist)|Robert Stone]]’s ''A Flag for Sunrise'' (1981),&lt;ref&gt;In an interview, Terpening also claimed that, as regards the revolutionary and [[Military simulation|war games]] atmosphere, he was inspired “by the environment of protest during his graduate studies at Berkeley. ‘I saw police throw protestors through glass windows of stores, I saw crowds being tear-gassed . . .’ ” Quotation from ''Scholar'', a publication of the Robert D. Clark Honors College at the University of Oregon, vol. 4, no. 1 (Fall 2006), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Terpening turned for his next thriller, ''Tropic of Fear'' (2006), to [[South America]]. Barbara Conaty, writing in ''[[Library Journal]]'', noted that “this thriller takes readers deep into the politics of [[Paraguay]].”&lt;ref&gt;Library Journal, vol. 130, no. 19 (November 15, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; She thought that Terpening “imbue[d] his main characters with psychological depth, infuse[d] the book with local color galore, and fashion[ed] a deft plot.” As for the plot, two Americans, a [[hydrogeologist]] from [[Arizona]] and a professor of German from [[Yale University]], both visiting [[Asunción]] but originally unknown to one another, are inadvertently drawn into the middle of a conspiracy to overthrow the Paraguayan government.&lt;ref&gt;Contemporary Authors, vol. 248, “Ron Terpening”&lt;/ref&gt; The male protagonist’s occupation came in for discussion in the ''Arizona Water Resource'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;vol. 14, no. 4 (March–April 2006), p. 8. Available online at [http://www.ag.arizona.edu/AZWATER/awr/marapr06/pub.html AG.arizona.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; The editor wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Taking popular entertainment as a measure one might likely conclude that those laboring in the hydrology and water resources field lack glamor, sex appeal and heroic qualities. Has any such character ever figured in plots on stage, screen, television or in books, to save the day, solve the mystery, woo the heroine and ride off into the sunset, or even to add spice and interest to a story?''

''Those who have noted this lamentable omission will undoubtedly be pleased to learn that ''Tropic of Fear'', a recently published thriller, features a hydrogeologist as a worthy protagonist.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Tropic of fear.jpg|thumb|left|180px|''Tropic of Fear'']]
In an interview published in ''Liens, Legami, Links''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w3.coh.arizona.edu/French/liens/S06/terp.html |title=Liens-Legami-Links |publisher=W3.coh.arizona.edu |date=2006-01-02 |accessdate=2009-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terpening noted:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''When I was a kid, my father told me about an accident that happened while he was working on [[Grand Coulee Dam]] in Washington. (At the time, [[Grand Coulee Dam]] was the world’s largest dam.) One day, a crane operator failed to see him, swung a quarter-ton bucket of wet concrete into his side, and knocked him off the dam. He managed to reach around in midair, grabbed the bottom rim of the bucket, swung out with it, and when it came back in dropped into the middle of a patch of fresh concrete.''

''My own “felicitous fall” took place when I was working on a new gym for Portland State College (now University). I was three stories up, walking along scaffolding with a bucket of clip-ties in my arms when I happened to step on a plank that went only halfway between two platforms. I woke up a few moments later, sixty feet below, lying on the concrete floor. I had landed on the bucket, which cracked three ribs, but that and the hard hat I was wearing saved my life.''

''Years later, when I sat down to write ''Tropic of Fear'', a political thriller set in South America, I thought of those experiences. They became part of the background of a secondary character, “Dink” Denton, a former roughneck, ex-[[Apache helicopter]] pilot in both [[Panama]] and the First [[Gulf War]], now undercover in Paraguay as a Special Agent for the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]].''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a ''[[Booklist]]'' review, David Pitt commented on “small flaws in the plot,” but observed that the “brisk clip” and pace of the action overcame that flaw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ron Terpening |url=http://www.ronterpening.com/novels/tropic_rev.htm |title=Cited at |publisher=Ronterpening.com |date= |accessdate=2009-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christine Wald-Hopkins, a reviewer for the ''[[Tucson Weekly]]'', noted this novel’s affinities with the earlier ''League of Shadows'', pointing out that the “malignant confluence of internal and external forces in contemporary [[Paraguay]] . . . has its own fascist resonance.”&lt;ref&gt;''Tucson Weekly, vol. 22, no. 45 (January 5–11, 2006), p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; And the [[Midwest Book Review]] concluded: “Vivid, descriptive, imaginative, and chilling in its presentation of the lengths human beings will go to dominate one another, ''Tropic of Fear'' is an exciting thrill ride from first page to last.”&lt;ref&gt;Small Press Bookwatch, ''Midwest Book Review'', vol. 5, no. 1 (January 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nine Days in October====
[[File:Nine days in october.jpg|thumb|180px|right|''Nine Days in October'']]
In 2007, Terpening published a contemporary international suspense [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]], ''Nine Days in October'', “his most successful fictional foray into the murk of international crime.”&lt;ref&gt;Christine Wald-Hopkins, “High-Action Tale,” in the ''Tucson Weekly'', vol. 24, no. 26 (August 23–29, 2007), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Jonathan Pearce (California State University, Stanislaus-Stockton), writing in ''[[Library Journal]]'', says that Terpening “gets his latest book off to a slam-bang start in [[Rome]] with a botched heist by terrorists. During the robbery, a visiting American professor is wounded and his daughter kidnapped, possibly for ransom.”&lt;ref&gt;''Library Journal'', vol. 132, no. 12 (July 2007), pp. 85-86.&lt;/ref&gt; Set in 1988, as competing government security organizations are preparing to welcome both the [[Soviet premier]] and the U.S. president to Italy, the novel’s complex plot, Pearce says, “revolves around a... professor's attempts to find his child while he is unknowingly trapped in an assassination scheme involving rogue [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agents, venal U.S. executives, Soviet oligarchs, and corrupt Italian security officials.” He concludes that “The reader roots for a weary Italian security officer to do his job better than the villains do theirs. The author's research is evidently extensive, the writing competent, the suspense gripping, and the characterization of beastly adversaries and noble protagonists effective. The sense of place is bolstered with such an abundance of native vocabulary and street and building names that Italophiles will feel right at home.”

====Cloud Cover====
[[File:Cloud Cover.jpg|thumb|180px|left|''Cloud Cover'']]
Terpening's latest novel (August 2013) is an international thriller set primarily in Italy and Yugoslavia in the summer of 1984, four years after the death of Marshal [[Josip Broz Tito]], the authoritarian president of the Socialist nation. By the summer of 1984 the stability of the state had begun to crack, early signs of the dismemberment that occurred in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="Yugoslavia"&gt;[[Timeline of Yugoslav breakup]] Timeline of the Breakup of Yugoslavia.&lt;/ref&gt; The novel has two protagonists—Michael Higgins, a [[NATO]] agent in [[Trieste]], Italy, and Fae Avadek, a Canadian spy. Secondary episodes take place in Southern Arizona ([[Sierra Vista]], [[Fort Huachuca]], Tucson), Chicago, Moscow (Russia), and [[Benghazi]] (Libya).&lt;ref name="cloud cover"&gt;[http://www.cliffedgepublishing.com/titles.html] Home Page of Cliff Edge Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

The action begins when a Yugoslav military attaché defects in [[Ottawa]] and is assassinated before the Canadians can interrogate him. In Trieste, at the same time, someone has begun eliminating NATO agents. Higgins, their case officer, is warned by Avadek that he has a traitor in his network. Suddenly, he's running for his life, framed for the murder of one of his contacts. Pursued by an unknown enemy, he falls in love with Fae, whose violent past figures in their search for answers. Meanwhile, Vitali Alferyev, [[KGB]] station chief in [[Belgrade]], has been recalled to Moscow, where his superior orders him to withdraw all covert operatives from the sector between [[Rijeka]] and [[Ljubljana]]. Alferyev’s search for the reason leads him into a deadly conflict with a [[GRU]] agent operating in the area. The novel reaches its climax in the Yugoslav mountains, where Croatian terrorists, KGB spies, and NATO agents play out the final violent moves in a dangerous game to change the fate of Europe. Higgins and Avadek must sift through layers of deceit and treachery in their attempt to thwart an enemy whose tentacles stretch from the East to the West and from the past to the (novel’s) present.&lt;ref name="cloud cover" /&gt;

In an interview conducted by ''[[Contemporary Authors]]'', Terpening said: “My desire to create imaginary worlds through fiction springs, as I suspect it does for most writers, from a love of reading. From early grade school years, when I was given my first books (most still in my library today) and when I lived one house away from the public library in [[Gresham, Oregon]] (where I spent most of my free time), to the present, when I teach [[Italian literature]] for a living, my addiction has been not to candy, rock 'n' roll, TV, drugs, sex, or gambling, but to the book—both as an artifact and as a source of delight, a distraction from the constraints of life. A good book carries you away and never lets you down.”&lt;ref name="Contemporary Authors 2006"/&gt;

Terpening has also reviewed over 200 novels (mostly suspense) for ''[[Library Journal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ronnie H. Terpening |url=http://www.u.arizona.edu/~terp/vita-partial.pdf | title=Ronnie H. Terpening's University of Arizona website | publisher=u.arizona.edu |date= |accessdate=2017-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Samuel Tremaine "Sam" Stivey''' (15 March 1881 – 21 March 1943) was an Australian sportsman. He played and umpired [[Australian rules football]] at senior level in two states of Australia, including for the [[Boulder City Football Club]] in the [[Goldfields Football League|Goldfields Football Association]] (GFA), the [[Carlton Football Club]] in the [[Australian Football League|Victorian Football League]] (VFL), and the [[Port Melbourne Football Club]] in the [[Victorian Football League|Victorian Football Association]] (VFA). Stivey later became a noted boxer in bouts held in [[Perth]] and [[Kalgoorlie]] during the late 1920s and early 1930s.

==Early life and career in the Goldfields==
Stivey was born in [[Port Melbourne]] in 1881.&lt;ref name="blueseum"&gt;[http://www.blueseum.org/tiki-index.php?page=Sam+Stivey Sam Stivey] – blueseum.org. Retrieved 8 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; He emigrated to the [[Goldfields-Esperance|goldfields of]] [[Western Australia]] during the [[Western Australian gold rush]] in the late 19th century. Stivey played football for [[Boulder City Football Club|Boulder City]] in the [[Goldfields Football League|Goldfields Football Association]] (GFA) during the 1890s and early 1900s.

He was also a noted [[Umpire (Australian rules football)|umpire]], with [[Dave Strickland]] considering him "the best adjudicator of our national game with the exception of [[Ivo Crapp]]". He umpired several GFA [[grand final]]s, as well as the 1904 [[West Australian State Premiership]], between [[Railways Football Club|Railways]] and {{WAFL WP}}. Stivey was at the centre of a controversy in October 1905, when, despite being considered the best umpire in the league at the time, he was passed over for the final match of the season, between Railways and [[Mines Rovers Football Club|Mines Rovers]], in favour of another umpire, who allegedly favoured Railways during the match. Allegations were made by Mines Rovers players that "Railways had bought the premiership", although no action was taken by the league.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article33023001 "Football amenities. peep behind the scenes"] – ''[[Western Argus]]''. Published 10 October 1905. Retrieved from ''Trove'', 8 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career in Victoria==
Stivey moved back to Victoria for the 1902 season, where he represented {{AFL Car}} in the [[Australian Football League|Victorian Football League]] (VFL). He played two matches for Carlton, making his debut in the last round of the [[1902 VFL season]], against {{AFL Ess}} at [[Princes Park (stadium)|Princes Park]].&lt;ref name="blueseum"/&gt; His only other match came against {{AFL Col}} in round one of the [[1903 VFL season]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://afltables.com/afl/stats/players/S/Sam_Stivey.html Sam Stivey], AFL Tables. Retrieved 28 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; He also played a few matches for [[Port Melbourne Football Club|Port Melbourne]] in the [[Victorian Football League|Victorian Football Association]] (VFA) later that year.

==Military service and later life==
Stivey enlisted for active service at the beginning of the [[First World War]] in 1914, but was considered too old, and was restricted to home duties. He joined the supply section of the Medical Corps, and was made a [[Staff Sergeant]]. During the final months of the war, he was transferred to the Corps Sea Transport division, sailing to England from [[Sydney]]. On his reenlistment in 1918, Stivey's occupation was noted as [[masseur]], and his religion [[Presbyterianism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/research/people/nominal_rolls/first_world_war_embarkation/person.asp?p=34050 First World War Embarkation Roll: Samuel Tremaine Stivey] – Australian War Memorial. Retrieved 12 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Stivey returned to Perth at the conclusion of the war. He began competing as a boxer in 1924, beginning in [[featherweight]] bouts at [[Uglieland]] carnivals and at the Unity Theatre in [[Perth]], and later progressing to open-air bouts held at a number of different venues in Perth and [[Kalgoorlie]]. Overall, Stivey competed in 54 fights, winning 28, losing fourteen, and drawing eleven.&lt;ref&gt;[http://boxrec.com/list_bouts.php?human_id=573860&amp;cat=boxer Sam Stivey] – BoxRec.

'''Selo Soemardjan''' (May 23, 1915 in [[Yogyakarta]] &amp;ndash; June 11, 2003 in [[Jakarta]]), also spelled as ''Selo Sumarjan'' or ''Selo Sumardjan''. He was well known as a senior academic in [[sociology]] at [[Universitas Indonesia]], and is known as the Pioneer of [[Indonesia]]n Social Sciences. He was awarded with the title [[Kanjeng Pangeran Haryo]], a knighthood from [[Yogyakarta Sultanate]].

Selo Soemardjan obtained his PhD at [[Cornell University]]. After his return from the US in 1959, he held a range of academic posts, although the majority of his time was spent at UI and the Social Sciences Foundation (Yayasan Ilmu-ilmu Sosial — YIIS) which he co-founded and headed for three decades.

==Background and education==
He began his career as a government bureaucrat in Java, serving as a district head in a rural area outside Yogyakarta. The term ''Selo'' was actually not his name, but a title attributed to Soemardjan's occupation as scribe/secretary to the Yogyakarta government, when he worked as regent of Kulonprogo. However, the term became so embedded with his real name ''Soemardjan'', hence Selo Soemardjan became his proper name.

During the revolutionary period 1945-1950, he was secretary to Sultan Hamengkubuwono IX, a major figure in the struggle for independence.  In 1948, an American student named [[George McTurnan Kahin]] was doing research in Yogyakarta. Kahin asked Minister of Education Ali Sastroamidjojo to suggest a suitable candidate as a research assistant. Sastroamidjojo suggested Selo Soemardjan, who was a civil servant, secretary to Sultan [[Hamengkubuwono IX]].

The situation became even more unstable. Social change that took place during Indonesia's struggle for independence compelled Soemardjan to study sociology. Kahin helped him to get the documents needed to study at Cornell, with sponsorship from the Ford Foundation, and, in February 1956, he went to Cornell, where he studied all the European theories of sociology. In 1959, Soemardjan returned to Yogyakarta to do the research on social change for his PhD, and after six months, he went back to Cornell to complete the thesis and sit for exams.

* HIS, Yogyakarta (1921–1928)
* MULO, Yogyakarta (1928–1931)
* MOSVIA, Magelang (1931–1934)
* Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, AS (PhD 1959)

==Career and Works==
Upon his graduation from Cornell, [[Mohammad Sadli]] of Faculty of Economics in Universitas Indonesia asked him to teach sociology in his department. As the only teacher in the department without a background in economics, he taught a subject that was titled "Non-economic Factors in Economic Development."

Later on, Soemardjan established the Faculty of Social Sciences in Universitas Indonesia and held the post of Dean for ten years. He was appointed as professor and later on as professor emeritus.

In 1968, after General [[Suharto]] officially replaced [[Sukarno]] as President, Sadli and his colleagues (often known as the [[Berkeley Mafia]]) became the architects of Indonesia's economic policy. Selo Soemardjan was involved in the analysis of non-economic factors.

As a professor, Soemardjan was able to explain sociology theory using layman's term, citing everyday examples that are encountered particularly from his past experience as civil servant.

* Regent of Kulonprogo Regency and Staff of Yogyakarta Sultanate / Yogyakarta Provincial Government (1935–1949)
* Civilian Chief of Staff for Jakarta Raya (1949–1950)

'''Sixto Paz Wells''' ([[Lima]], [[Peru]], December 12 1955) is an author and lecturer focused on the [[UFO]] phenomena, particularly [[Alien visitation|alien contact]], from a spiritual viewpoint.&lt;ref name=Lozano1999 /&gt; Known as the visible head of the  [[#Rahma Mission|Rahma Mission]] in Spain and a number of Latin American countries,&lt;ref name="Jara2001" /&gt; stands out among the [[ufologists]] for having summoned the international press to sightings scheduled in advance in more than ten occasions.&lt;ref name=visitantes /&gt; As a self proclaimed [[contactee]],&lt;ref name=PazWells2002 /&gt; he has published 20 books in Spanish and one in English about this subject so far (July 2017). In his works about UFOlogy he promotes a systematic method of physical and mental preparation for contact, as well as protocols for documenting, validating and confirming contact experiences.&lt;ref name=instructor2009 /&gt;


== Life ==
Paz Wells was born in [[Lima]], [[Peru]], in December 12 1955 to Rose Marie Wells Vienrich and Carlos Paz García, an astronomer and scientific adviser of the Peruvian Air Force, as well as researcher interested in the [[UFO]] phenomena.&lt;ref name="Palestra2013" /&gt;

From the age of twelve he became interested in UFOs because of his proximity to the Peruvian Institute of Interplanetary Relations (IPRI), founded and presided over by his father.&lt;ref name="Elpais1977" /&gt;

He coursed primary and secondary studies with the [[Marist Brothers]], culminating his studies in the first place in the Order of Merits. 

Sixto Paz, 19 at that time, invites the Spanish journalist [[J. J. Benitez]] to a programmed sighting of an unidentified flying object in the Chilca desert on September 7, 1974.&lt;ref name="U.Catol,2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Pinas,Pres /&gt;

He then pursued university studies at the [[Pontifical Catholic University of Peru]], in the faculty of History.&lt;ref name="U.Catol,2004" /&gt;

He is married to Marina Torres since 1987 and have two daughters: Yearim and Tanis.&lt;ref  name="U.Catol,2004" /&gt;

== Career ==

On January 22, 1974 he attended a conference titled "Telepathy as a transmission of distance thought", given by a physician member of the [[Theosophical Society]].&lt;ref name="Pinas,cap2" /&gt; That night, after a deep relaxation exercise, Paz Wells received with his mother and sister, a message through automatic writing. The message supposedly was from a being named Oxalc from Ganymede, with the intention of establishing communication with some earthlings.&lt;ref name=sos1 /&gt; Sixto repeated the group experience, and they all were summoned to a sighting scheduled on February 7, 1974 at 9 pm in the Chilca desert, where according to the attendants appeared a very bright lens-shaped aircraft with windows.&lt;ref name=sos2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Campo2002 /&gt;

Sixto Paz was interested in communicating with aliens astrally, in dreams or telepathically, and not only physically with their ships, which was the traditional approach of IPRI ufologists.&lt;ref name=Campo2002 /&gt;

Similar experiences were happening until August 1974, when the agency Efe spread the news that involved the Paz Wells family:

{{quote|text=Lima (Efe). — Five members of the Peruvian Institute of Interplanetary Relations (IPRI) have established contact with a UFO from Ganymede, the largest of Jupiter's natural satellites, said yesterday Carlos Paz García, president of the institution . IPRI members left last Monday for Marcahuasi, a plateau located about 90 km from Lima and at a height of 4200 m, remaining there until Thursday, August 22, bringing important recording material and photographs, said Paz García. [That] material currently being analyzed by IPRI members. Paz García said that the indicated group has been in contact with the aliens for eight months.|author=Efe news agency, August 1974&lt;ref name=sos /&gt;}}

Following the note from Efe, journalist [[J. J. Benítez]] was sent from Spain to learn about the unusual experience of Paz Wells teenagers.&lt;ref name=sos /&gt; Benítez did not get involved with Ufology out of his curiosity, but rather found the UFO phenomenon meeting the Rama Mission.&lt;ref name="EOC,2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pinas,Pres" /&gt; Sixto invites him to the scheduled sighting of an unidentified flying object, along with his brother Charlie {{ref|Charlie|n1}} and seven other people at the Chilca desert on September 7, 1974.&lt;ref name="U.Catol,2004" /&gt; Benitez saw, as had been announced in advance, two UFOs.&lt;ref name="Pinas,Pres" /&gt;

=== Rahma Mission ===
[[File:Sixto Paz Wells field trip to Chilca Desert 2009.jpg|thumb|300px|Group listening to Sixto Paz Wells during a field trip on Chilca desert, Peru on March 30, 2009]]
Originally called the RAMA Mission, it was named after the goal they shared: RA (Sun) MA (Earth), a contact program that seeks to transform the human being into a star, into a Sun on Earth.&lt;ref name="Pinas,cap2" /&gt; It was the organization of groups of sympathizers of the method promoted by Paz Wells to contact those who he called "Extraterrestrial Guides".&lt;ref name=visitantes /&gt;

Through IPRI Paz Wells contacted the "International Society of Divine Realization" where he learned [[yoga]], relaxation, meditation and deep concentration techniques, which he would later encourage among the Rahma groups to facilitate contact. Since the Chilca event of September 1974, together with his brother Charlie{{ref|Charlie|n1}} and close friends from IPRI, he began work with groups of enthusiasts in Peru, which were growing and ended adopting the name RAMA Mission.&lt;ref name=Jara2001 /&gt;

It was officially dissolved as an organization by its founder in 1990, although there are groups that are still working independently. It came to have a presence in several countries of Latin America and Spain, where it was reviewed as one of the eleven sects or groups that have the extraterrestrials as core of their doctrines.&lt;ref name=Jara2001 /&gt;

=== International Forums ===
Sixto Paz describes himself as a messenger of peace and hope, rather than a messenger of other worlds.&lt;ref name=Lozano1999 /&gt; He has appeared in international forums such as the [[United Nations]]&lt;ref name="ElComercio,2015" /&gt; and in universities such as [[Columbia University]]&lt;ref name="ElComercio,2015" /&gt; and [[John F. Kennedy University]].&lt;ref name="Madrigal,2014" /&gt; In other countries, the University of Montreal, the Universidad Complutense de Madrid and the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] have also had him as a lecturer.&lt;ref name="El Corredor,2016" /&gt;

Paz Wells travels around the world giving lectures about his take on the [[UFO]] phenomena. He has visited Europe, Africa, Oceania&lt;ref name=Bio /&gt; and America such as Colombia,&lt;ref name=Tiempo1993 /&gt; Chile,&lt;ref name=Mercurio2008 /&gt; Ecuador,&lt;ref name=Universo2012 /&gt; Mexico,&lt;ref name="Teotihuacan2014" /&gt; Argentina, Uruguay&lt;ref name=Connio,2014 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Teledoce2016 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Raices2008 /&gt; and United States, being most noted his visit to Washington DC in May 2015.&lt;ref name=Vivanco2015 /&gt;

In more than ten opportunities he has summoned members of the international press to witness, record and photograph the sightings of lights and objects in the sky, which the author claims are directed or manned by extraterrestrial beings who maintain telepathic contact with him and other members of his contact groups. Among these experiences are one of August 1997 on the Valparaíso beach north of [[Lima]],&lt;ref name=visitantes /&gt; March 3, 2009 in the Chilca desert,&lt;ref name=Cerrado2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name="chilca2009" /&gt; in 2014 also in Chilca, and 2014 in [[Teotihuacan]], Mexico.&lt;ref name="Teotihuacan2014" /&gt;


== Critics ==
As a self proclaimed [[contactee]], Paz Wells has faced skepticism, even from the so called serious [[Ufology|ufologists]]. The astrophysicist [[Jacques Vallée]] notes, "No serious investigator has ever been very worried by the claims of the 'contactees'."&lt;ref name="Vallee1965" /&gt;

On March 31, 1994 Paz Wells was invited to the Spanish television program "La hora de la verdad", in which he underwent a polygraph test. He has been criticized for not passing the test on the question "Have you truly traveled in a spacecraft to another planet?",&lt;ref name="polígrafo" /&gt; which is one of the main arguments the author uses to back up his claims. However, Paz Wells did pass all other questions such as "Have you ever been under the influence of a hallucinogenic drug?", "Have you received money from any spy service?", "Have you invented all these stories For exclusively lucrative purposes? ", "Without having to do with this matter, have you ever lied to get out of a hurry?"&lt;ref name="polígrafo" /&gt; which he argues in his defense as proof of character. He also says that he failed the question "Have you really traveled in a spacecraft to another planet?" because he claims to have visited [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]], which is not a proper planet but a moon of Jupiter, an imprecision that made him stumble.&lt;ref name="expediente2013" /&gt;

The [[#Rahma Mission |Rahma Mission]] of which Paz Wells was the visible head until its dissolution in 1990 has been described by psychologists and philosophers as a [[UFO religion]] and a neo-religious group whose beliefs are very similar to those of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] and nineteenth century's [[Occult#Occultism|Occultism]], while using the techniques from [[Spiritism]].&lt;ref name=sectas /&gt; In 1976, his brother Charlie{{ref|Charlie|n1}} settled in Brazil and formed contact groups there with a different orientation than Sixto was giving to the RAMA Mission, claiming that it was becoming "a movement plagued of interpretation errors, struggles for leadership and unclear economic purposes."&lt;ref name=Guijarro1994 /&gt;

== Published books ==
He has written more than 20 books since 1985, published in Argentina, Spain, Mexico, Colombia, Peru, Italy, Germany, and the United States. Some of them have been translated into English, German, Italian and Portuguese.&lt;ref name="El Corredor,2016" /&gt;

The '''Terri Schiavo case''' was a [[Right to die|right-to-die]] legal case in the [[United States]] from 1990 to 2005, involving '''Theresa Marie Schiavo''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ʃ|aɪ|v|oʊ}}; December 3, 1963&amp;nbsp;– March 31, 2005), a woman in an irreversible [[persistent vegetative state]]. Schiavo's husband and legal guardian argued that Schiavo would not have wanted prolonged artificial life support without the prospect of recovery, and elected to remove her [[feeding tube]]. Schiavo's parents disputed her husband's assertions and challenged Schiavo's medical diagnosis, arguing in favor of continuing artificial nutrition and hydration.&lt;ref name="tbo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="abstract"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bioethics.miami.edu/research-and-clinical-ethics/terri-schiavo-project/timeline-of-key-events/part-1/index.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141116010101/http://bioethics.miami.edu/research%2Dand%2Dclinical%2Dethics/terri%2Dschiavo%2Dproject/timeline%2Dof%2Dkey%2Devents/part%2D1/index.html|title=Schiavo Timeline, Part 1|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=The University of Miami Ethics Programs|archivedate=November 16, 2014|dead-url=yes|accessdate=December 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highly publicized and prolonged series of legal challenges presented by her parents, which ultimately involved state and federal politicians up to the level of [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]], caused a seven-year delay before Schiavo's feeding tube was ultimately removed.

On February 25, 1990, at age 26, Schiavo sustained a [[cardiac arrest]] at her home in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]]. She was successfully resuscitated, but had massive [[brain damage]] due to [[cerebral hypoxia|lack of oxygen to her brain]] and was left [[coma]]tose. After two and a half months without improvement, her diagnosis was changed to that of a [[persistent vegetative state]]. For the next two years, doctors attempted speech and physical therapy and other experimental therapy, hoping to return her to a state of awareness, without success. In 1998, Schiavo's husband, Michael, petitioned the [[Florida Circuit Courts|Sixth Circuit Court of Florida]] to remove her feeding tube pursuant to Florida law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.onecle.com/florida/civil-rights/765.401.html|title=§ 765.401 of Florida Statutes – Health Care Advance Directives – The proxy.|publisher=[[State of Florida]]|date=November 22, 2006|accessdate=January 1, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208005258/http://law.onecle.com/florida/civil-rights/765.401.html|archivedate=December 8, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was opposed by Terri's parents, Robert and Mary Schindler. The court determined that Schiavo would not have wished to continue life-prolonging measures,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2003/11/08/Tampabay/Schiavo_s_wishes_reca.shtml|title= Schiavo's wishes recalled in records|author=William R. Levesque|work=St. Petersburg Times|date=November 8, 2003|accessdate=January 5, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and on April 24, 2001, her feeding tube was removed for the first time, only to be reinserted several days later. On February 25, 2005, a Pinellas County judge again ordered the removal of Terri Schiavo's feeding tube. Several appeals and federal government intervention followed, which included [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[George W.

==Background==
{{Terri Schiavo}}

===Early life===
Terri Schiavo was born Theresa Marie Schindler on December 3, 1963, in [[Lower Moreland Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania]], a suburb of [[Philadelphia]].  Overweight throughout her childhood, as a teenager Terri stood 5' 3" (160&amp;nbsp;cm) tall and weighed {{convert|200|lb|kg}}. Through dieting she had lost {{convert|65|lb|kg}} by the time she attended college.&lt;ref name="UStoday"&gt;{{cite news|title=Schiavo case highlights eating disorders|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2005-02-25-schiavo-eating-disorder_x.htm|accessdate=November 28, 2011|newspaper=USA Today|date=February 26, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; She attended [[Bucks County Community College]], where she met Michael Schiavo in 1982. The two began dating and were married on November 10, 1984. They moved to [[Florida]] in 1986, following Terri's parents. Michael worked as a restaurant manager, while Terri took up a [[bookkeeping]] job with an insurance company.&lt;ref name="WashPostFrey"&gt;{{cite news|last=Frey|first=Jennifer|title=Terri Schiavo's Unstudied Life|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A64459-2005Mar24.html|accessdate=July 30, 2010|newspaper=Washington Post|date=March 25, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Initial medical crisis: 1990===
In the early morning of February 25, 1990, Terri Schiavo collapsed in a hallway of her [[St. Petersburg, Florida]] apartment. Firefighters and [[paramedics]], arriving in response to her husband Michael's [[9-1-1]] call, found her face-down and unconscious. She was not breathing and had no [[pulse]]. They attempted to resuscitate her and she was transported to the Humana Northside Hospital. Paramedics had her [[intubation|intubated]] and [[Mechanical ventilation|ventilated]].&lt;ref name="wolfson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abstractappeal.com/schiavo/WolfsonReport.pdf |format=PDF |title=A report to Governor Jeb Bush and the Sixth Judicial Circuit in the matter of Theresa Marie Schiavo|author=Wolfson, Jay|publisher=abstractappeal.com|pages=2, 8, 10|date=December 1, 2003|accessdate=September 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Initial Medical Assessments====
The cause of Terri Schiavo's collapse was determined to be [[cardiac arrest]].&lt;ref name="Cranford"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cranford|first=Ronald|date=Summer 2005|title=Facts, Lies, and Videotapes: The Permanent Vegetative State and The Sad Case of Terri Schiavo|journal=The Journal of Law, Medicine &amp; Ethics|volume=33|issue=2|pages=363–371|doi=10.1111/j.1748-720x.2005.tb00501.x|pmid=16083094|accessdate=}}&lt;!-- no url, so accessdate=2013-11-07 caused error --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Her medical chart contained a note that "she apparently has been trying to keep her weight down with dieting by herself, drinking liquids most of the time during the day and drinking about 10–15 glasses of [[iced tea]]".&lt;ref name="UStoday" /&gt; Upon admission to the hospital, she was noted as suffering from [[hypokalemia]] (low potassium levels): her serum [[potassium]] level was an abnormally low 2.0&amp;nbsp;[[Equivalent (chemistry)|mEq]]/[[litre|L]] (the normal range for adults is 3.5–5.0&amp;nbsp;mEq/L). Her sodium and calcium levels were normal.&lt;ref name="SilentWitness"&gt;{{cite book|title=Silent Witness|author=Mark Fuhrman|publisher=William Morrow|date=June 28, 2005|page=67|isbn=0-06-085337-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Electrolyte disturbance|Electrolyte imbalance]] is often caused by [[water intoxication|drinking excessive fluids]]. A serious consequence of hypokalemia can be heart rhythm abnormalities, including [[sudden arrhythmia death syndrome]].&lt;ref name="quote"&gt;Meyer J, et al.

Retrieved July 26, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Terri was eventually switched from being fed by a [[nasogastric intubation|nasogastric feeding tube]] to a [[percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy]] (PEG) feeding tube.

Dr. Garcia J. DeSousa, [[American Osteopathic Board of Neurology and Psychiatry|board-certified]] [[neurologist]] in St. Petersburg, Florida, who previously treated Terri Schiavo, cared for her during her initial admission to Humana Northside; both he and Dr. Victor Gambone, an internist and Schiavo family physician, independently made the diagnosis of persistent vegetative state (PVS) within approximately one year after her sudden cardiac arrest.&lt;ref name="Cranford" /&gt;

===Relationship between Terri's husband and parents===
From 1990 to 1995, Michael Schiavo and the Schindlers (Terri Schiavo's parents) enjoyed an amicable relationship,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/justices/pariente.shtml Pariente, Barbara, Chief Justice] (for The Court). "JEB BUSH, Governor of Florida, et al., vs. MICHAEL SCHIAVO, Guardian of Marissa Brown," Case Number: SC04-925, ''[[Florida Supreme Court]],'' September 23, 2004 [http://www.law.fsu.edu/library/flsupct/sc04-925/op-sc04-925.pdf PDF link] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050416021236/http://www.law.fsu.edu/library/flsupct/sc04-925/op-sc04-925.pdf |date=April 16, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Pg 3 of 30--&gt; with the Schindlers allowing Michael to live rent-free in their condominium for several months.&lt;ref name="pearse"/&gt;

===Rehabilitation efforts: 1990–1993===
In November 1990, Michael Schiavo took Terri to the [[University of California, San Francisco]] for experimental nerve stimulation with a [[thalamic stimulator]]. The treatment took several months and was unsuccessful. He returned to Florida with her in January 1991 and admitted her as an inpatient to the Mediplex Rehabilitation Center in [[Bradenton, Florida]]. On July 19, 1991, Terri Schiavo was transferred to the Sabal Palms Skilled Care Facility, where she received neurological testing and regular [[speech therapy|speech]] and [[occupational therapy]] until 1994.&lt;ref name=abstract/&gt; In mid-1993, Michael Schiavo requested a [[do not resuscitate]] order for her after she contracted a urinary tract infection.

==Legal cases 1992–2002==

===Malpractice===
In 1992, Michael filed a [[malpractice]] suit against Terri's [[obstetrician]] on the basis that he failed to diagnose bulimia as the cause of her infertility.&lt;ref&gt;Greer, George W., Circuit Judge. [http://abstractappeal.com/schiavo/trialctorder02-00.pdf "IN RE: THE GUARDIANSHIP OF THERESA MARIE SCHIAVO, Incapacitated," (PDF)] File No. 90-2908GD-003, ''[http://jud6.org/ Fla. 6th Judicial Circuit],'' February 11, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Terri had gone to the doctor because she had stopped [[Menstruation|menstruating]] but the doctor had failed to take her medical history into account which might have revealed an eating disorder. During the case, one of Terri's friends testified that she knew Schiavo was bulimic. In November 1992, Michael won the case and was awarded $6.8 million by the jury, later reduced to $2 million as Terri was found partly at fault for her condition.&lt;ref name="UStoday"/&gt; After attorneys' fees and other expenses, Michael received $300,000 and $750,000 was put in a trust fund for Terri's medical care. According to Michael, in early 2003 the Schindlers demanded that he share the malpractice money with them.&lt;ref name=abstract /&gt;

===Petition to remove feeding tube===
On June 18, 1990, the court appointed Michael Schiavo as Terri Schiavo's legal guardian; this appointment was not disputed by the Schindlers at the time.&lt;ref name="wolfson" /&gt; In May 1998, Michael Schiavo filed a petition to remove Terri Schiavo's feeding tube, which her parents opposed. Richard Pearse was appointed by the court as a second [[guardian ad litem|guardian ''ad litem'' (GAL)]], and on December 29, 1998, reported "Dr. Jeffrey Karp's opinion of the [[Ward (law)|ward's]] condition and prognosis is substantially shared among those physicians who have recently been involved in her treatment." Pearse concluded from Karp's and Dr. Vincent Gambone's diagnosis of ''Persistent Vegetative State'' that Schiavo was legally in a persistent vegetative state as defined by Florida Statutes, Title XLIV, Chapter 765, [[§]]101(12). This includes the "absence of voluntary action" and an "inability to communicate or interact purposefully".&lt;ref name="pearse"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hospicepatients.org/richard-pearse-jr-12-29-98-report-of-guardianadlitem-re-terri-schiavo.pdf |format=PDF|title=Report of guardian ad litem," for "In re: the guardianship of Theresa Schiavo, an incapacitated person, Case No. 90-2908GD-003|author=Pearse, Richard L., Jr., P.A., Guardian Ad Litem.|pages=2, 8–11|publisher=Hospice Patients Alliance|date=December 29, 1998|accessdate=February 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2012/765.101|title=State of Florida. Florida Statutes, Citation of Law, §765.101(12), Florida Statutes|publisher=[[State of Florida]]|date=June 1, 2005|accessdate=February 3, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pearse found that there was no possibility of improvement but that Michael Schiavo's decisions might have been influenced by the potential to inherit what remained of Terri Schiavo's estate as long as he remained married to her. Due to a lack of a [[living will]] and questions regarding Michael's credibility, Pearse recommended denying his petition to remove her feeding tube. Pearse reported that the issue of conflict of interest applied to the Schindlers as well since, had Michael divorced Terri as they wanted him to, they would have inherited the remainder of Mrs. Schiavo's estate upon her death.&lt;ref name="pearse" /&gt;

===Schiavo end-of-life wishes===
Given the lack of a [[living will]], a trial was held before Pinellas County Judge [[George Greer]] during the week of January 24, 2000, to determine what Terri Schiavo's wishes would have been regarding life-prolonging procedures.&lt;ref name="greer-02-00"/&gt; Michael Schiavo was represented by attorney [[George Felos]], who had won a landmark right-to-die case before the [[Florida Supreme Court]] in 1990.&lt;ref name="Browning AP"&gt;{{cite news|title=Florida Woman Dies Attached to a Tube; Legal Fight Goes On|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/19/us/florida-woman-dies-attached-to-a-tube-legal-fight-goes-on.html|agency=Associated Press|date=July 19, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Browning Schiavo"&gt;{{cite web|last=Levesque|first=William R.|title=Right-to-die law defined by local case|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2003/10/13/Tampabay/Right_to_die_law_defi.shtml|work=St. Petersburg Times|date=October 13, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trial included testimony from eighteen witnesses regarding her medical condition and her end-of-life wishes. Michael Schiavo claimed that his wife would not want to be kept on a machine where her chance for recovery was minuscule. According to Abstract Appeal Trial Order, her parents "claimed that Terri was a devout [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] who would not wish to violate the Church's teachings on [[euthanasia]] by [[Patient refusal of nutrition and hydration|refusing nutrition and hydration]]". Judge Greer issued his order granting the petition for authorization to discontinue artificial life support for Terri Schiavo in February 2000. In this decision, the court found that Terri Schiavo was in a persistent vegetative state and that she had made reliable oral declarations that she would have wanted the feeding tube removed.&lt;ref name="greer-02-00"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abstractappeal.com/schiavo/trialctorder02-00.pdf |format=PDF|title=In re: the guardianship of Theresa Marie Schiavo, Incapacitated," File No. 90-2908GD-003|author=Greer, George W., Circuit Judge|pages=9–10|publisher=Florida Sixth Judicial Circuit|date=February 11, 2000|accessdate=January 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decision was upheld by the [[Florida Second District Court of Appeal]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abstractappeal.com/schiavo/2dcaorder01-01.txt|title=In re Guardianship of Theresa Marie Schiavo, Incapacitated.

===Oral feeding and the Second Guardianship Challenge===
In March 2000, the Schindlers filed a motion to permit [[assisted feeding]] of Terri, which is not considered a life-prolonging procedure under Florida law. Since clinical records indicated that Terri Schiavo was not responsive to [[swallowing|swallowing tests]] and required a feeding tube,&lt;ref name="wolfson" /&gt; Judge Greer ruled that she was not capable of orally ingesting sufficient nutrition and hydration to sustain life, and denied the request.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abstractappeal.com/schiavo/trialctorder0300.pdf |format=PDF|title=In re: the guardianship of Theresa Marie Schiavo, Incapacitated, File No. 90-2908GD-003|author=Greer, George W., Circuit Judge.|publisher=Florida Sixth Judicial Circuit|date=March 7, 2000|accessdate=February 9, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Medical Examiner in his postmortem report was more definitive and reaffirmed that Schiavo could not have swallowed.&lt;ref name="thogmartin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abstractappeal.com/schiavo/autopsyreport.pdf |format=PDF|title="Report of Autopsy" for Theresa Schiavo, Case #5050439|author=Thogmartin, Jon R.|page=34|publisher=co.pinellas.fl.us/forensics/|date=June 13, 2005|accessdate=November 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the Schindlers again challenged Michael Schiavo's guardianship. The Schindlers suggested that he was wasting the assets within the guardianship account by transferring Terri Schiavo to a [[Pinellas Park, Florida]] [[hospice care|hospice]] "after it was clear that she was not 'terminal' within Medicare guidelines" for hospices. By this time, while still legally married to Terri Schiavo, Michael Schiavo was in a relationship with Jodi Centonze, and had fathered their first child. He said he chose not to divorce his wife and relinquish guardianship because he wanted to ensure her final wishes (not to be kept alive in a PVS) were carried out. The court denied the motion to remove the guardian, allowing that the evidence was not sufficient and in some instances, not relevant. It set April 24, 2001, as the date on which the tube was to be removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libertytothecaptives.net/petitiontoremoveguardian_amended.html|title=Second amended petition to remove guardian|author=Anderson, Patricia F., Esq.|publisher=libertytothecaptives.net|date=January 1, 2003|page=14|accessdate=February 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Schiavo II''===
In April 2001, the Schindlers filed a motion for relief from judgment citing new evidence of Terri Schiavo's wishes. Judge Greer denied the motion as untimely under Rule 1.540(b)(5) of the Florida Rules of Civil Procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://floridacivpro.com/rules/1-540-relief-from-judgment-decrees-or-orders/|title= Florida Rules of Civil Procedure|publisher=The Florida Bar|date=December 1, 2005|accessdate=November 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Second District Court of Appeal upheld Greer's decision but [[Remand (court procedure)|remanded]] the issue in order to give the Schindlers an opportunity to file a new motion. On April 24, 2001, Terri's feeding tube was removed for the first time. The Schindlers filed a civil suit against Michael Schiavo alleging [[perjury]], which was assigned to another court. The judge, Frank Quesada, issued an injunction against the removal of feeding tube until this was settled. The feeding tube was reinserted on April 26, 2001. On appeal by Michael Schiavo, the Second District Court of Appeal reversed Judge Quesada's order. In the same time frame, Michael Schiavo filed a motion to enforce the mandate of the guardianship court (that the feeding tube be removed). The Second District Court of Appeal denied the motion. These three decisions, all published in a single order by Florida's Second District Court of Appeal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abstractappeal.com/schiavo/2dcaorder07-01.txt|title="In re Guardianship of Theresa Marie Schiavo, Incapacitated.

On August 10, 2001, on remand from the [[Florida Second District Court of Appeal]], Judge Greer heard a motion from the Schindlers claiming that new medical treatment could restore sufficient cognitive ability such that Terri Schiavo herself would be able to decide to continue life-prolonging measures. The court also heard motions from the Schindlers to remove the guardian (Michael Schiavo) and to require Judge Greer to [[recuse]] himself. Judge Greer denied the motions and the Schindlers appealed to the Second District Court of Appeals. On October 17, 2001, the Court of Appeal affirmed the denials of the motions to remove and recuse. The Court of Appeals acknowledged that their opinion misled the trial court, and they remanded the question of Terri Schiavo's wishes back to the trial court and required an evidentiary hearing to be held. The court specified that five board certified neurologists were to testify. The Schindlers were allowed to choose two doctors to present findings at an evidentiary hearing while Michael Schiavo could introduce two rebuttal experts. Finally, the trial court itself would appoint a new independent physician to examine and evaluate Terri Schiavo's condition. (These decisions, all published in a single order by the Florida Second District Court of Appeal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.2dca.org/opinion/October%2017,%202001/2d01-3626.pdf |format=PDF|title=In re: Guardianship of Theresa Marie Schiavo, Incapacitated.

In October 2002, on [[remand (court procedure)|remand]] by the Second District Court of Appeal, an evidentiary hearing was held in Judge Greer's court to determine whether new therapy treatments could help Terri Schiavo restore any cognitive function. In preparation for the trial, a new [[computed axial tomography]] scan (CAT scan) was performed, which showed severe [[cerebral atrophy]]. An [[Electroencephalography|EEG]] showed no measurable brain activity. The five physicians chosen were Dr. William Maxfield, a [[radiology|radiologist]], and four [[neurology|neurologists]]: Dr. [[William Hammesfahr]], Dr. Ronald Cranford, Dr. Melvin Greer and Dr. Peter Bambakidis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2003/11/10/Tampabay/Schiavo_tapes__snippe.shtml|title=Schiavo tapes: snippets, then not much|last=Nohlgren|first=Stephen|work=St. Petersburg Times|date=November 10, 2003|accessdate=April 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The five doctors examined Terri Schiavo's medical records, brain scans, the videos, and Terri herself. Drs. Cranford, Greer, and Bambakidis testified that Terri Schiavo was in a persistent vegetative state. Drs. Maxfield and Hammesfahr testified that she was in a [[minimally conscious state]]. As part of the court-ordered medical exam, six hours of video of Terri Schiavo were taped and filed at the Pinellas County courthouse. The tape included Terri Schiavo with her mother and neurologist William Hammesfahr. The entire tape was viewed by Judge Greer, who wrote, Terri "clearly does not consistently respond to her mother". From that six hours of video, the Schindlers and their supporters produced six clips showing reactions and emotions, totaling less than six minutes, and released those clips to public websites.&lt;ref name="tbo"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.tbo.com/news/MGBQ67CTI6E.html|title=Schiavo Videotapes Offer Powerful But Misleading Evidence|last=Smith|first=Brad|work=Tampa Tribune|date=March 20, 2005|accessdate=February 17, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050320120815/http://news.tbo.com/news/MGBQ67CTI6E.html |archivedate=March 20, 2005 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judge Greer ruled that Terri Schiavo was in a PVS, and was beyond hope of significant improvement. The trial court order was particularly critical of Hammesfahr's testimony, which claimed positive results in similar cases by use of [[vasodilation]] therapy, the success of which is unsupported in the medical literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abstractappeal.com/schiavo/trialctorder11-02.txt|title=In re: The guardianship of Theresa Marie Schiavo, Incapacitated.

Around the start of 2003, the Schindlers began to create more publicity by lobbying for their case to keep their daughter alive. They selected pro-life activist [[Randall Terry]] as their spokesman and continued to pursue their available legal options. On September 11, 2003, the Schindlers petitioned the court to forestall removal of the feeding tube in order to provide for "eight weeks' therapy". Accompanying the petition were four affidavits from members of the Schindler family and one from Dr. Alexander T. Gimon. At the hearing, the Schindlers' counsel read into the record additional affidavits from three speech professionals and two nurses. In particular, Nurse Carla Sauer lyer asserted that she was able to feed Terri Schiavo orally but that Michael characterized any such interaction as "therapy" and ordered her not to do so. Iyer claimed in her affidavit that her initial training in 1996 consisted solely of the instruction, "Do what Michael Schiavo tells you or you're terminated", and that standing orders were not to contact the Schindler family, but that she "would call them anyway".

On September 17, 2003, Judge [[George Greer]] denied the petition, and wrote that "the Petition is an attempt by Mr. and Mrs. Schindler to re-litigate the entire case.

==Terri's Law and other government delays==
{{Main|Government involvement in the Terri Schiavo case}}

On October 15, 2003, Schiavo's feeding tube was removed. Within a week, when the Schindlers' final appeal was exhausted, State Rep. [[Frank Attkisson]] and the [[Florida Legislature]] passed "Terri's Law" in an [[special session|emergency session]] giving Governor [[Jeb Bush]] the authority to intervene in the case. Governor Bush immediately ordered the feeding tube reinserted. Governor Bush sent the [[Florida Department of Law Enforcement]] (FDLE) to remove Schiavo from the hospice. She was taken to Morton Plant Rehabilitation Hospital in Clearwater, where her feeding tube was surgically reinserted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/story?id=584124&amp;page=1|title=Transcript: Michael Schiavo on 'Nightline': Husband at the Heart of the 'Right to Die' Case Speaks to Chris Bury,|author=Bury, Chris|publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC News]]|date=March 15, 2005|accessdate=February 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was then returned to the hospice. Part of the legislation required the appointment of a [[guardian ad litem|guardian ''ad litem'' (GAL)]], Dr. Jay Wolfson, to "deduce and represent the best wishes and best interests" of Schiavo, and report them to Governor Bush. Wolfson's report did not change Michael's role as her legal guardian and did not otherwise obstruct him legally.&lt;ref name="wolfson" /&gt;

Michael Schiavo opposed the Governor's intervention in Schiavo's case, and was represented, in part, by the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU). At the same time, Robert and Mary Schindler, her parents, attempted to intervene and participate in the "Terri's Law" case but were denied by Judge W. Douglas Baird, a Circuit Judge in the Florida Sixth Circuit, the same circuit as for Judge George W. Greer. They appealed, and, on February 13, the [[Florida District Courts of Appeal|Florida Second District Court of Appeal]] (Second District Court of Appeals) reversed Baird's ruling, allowing them to participate. On March 17, Baird denied the Schindlers the right to intervene a second time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mncdd.org/news/inclusion-daily/2004/03/031704fladvschiavo.htm|title=Judge Baird Again Denies Schindlers' Request To Intervene In "Terri's Law" Case|author=Reynolds, Dave|publisher=Inclusion Daily Express, Fla. Minnesota Governor's Council on Developmental Disabilities|date=March 17, 2004|accessdate=March 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Schindlers, represented by the [[American Center for Law and Justice]] (ACLJ), appealed the right to participate in the "Terri's Law" case, with the court scheduling an [[oral argument]] date for June 14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://199.242.69.70/pls/ds/ds_docket?p_caseyear=2004&amp;p_casenumber=1528&amp;psCourt=2&amp;psSearchType=|title=State of Florida "Case Docket," Case Number: 2D04-1528|publisher=[[Florida District Courts of Appeal|Florida Second District Court of Appeal]]|date=January 1, 2004|accessdate=March 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Schindlers' other attorney, Pat Anderson, was concurrently challenging Michael Schiavo's right to be her guardian, and, on June 16, she made a petition for writ of [[Quo Warranto|''quo warranto'']].

On May 5, 2004, Baird found "Terri's Law" [[constitutionality|unconstitutional]], and struck it down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abstractappeal.com/schiavo/trialctorder05-04.txt|title=Michael Schiavo, as Guardian of the person of Theresa Marie Schiavo, Petitioner, v.

The Florida Supreme Court then overturned the law as unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/pub_info/summaries/briefs/04/04-925/Filed_09-23-2004_Opinion.pdf |format=PDF|title=Jeb Bush, Governor of Florida, et al., Appellants, vs. Michael Schiavo, Guardian of Theresa Schiavo, Appellee, Case Number: SC04-925|author=[http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/justices/pariente.shtml Pariente, Barbara, Chief Justice] (for The Court).|publisher=[[Florida Supreme Court]]|date=September 23, 2004|accessdate=April 15, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Final feeding tube removal and federal involvement==

===Early 2005 motions===
On February 23, 2005, the Schindlers filed a motion for relief from judgment pending medical evaluations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://floridasky.us/terri/022305med.pdf |format=PDF|title="Resondents' Fla.R.Civ.P.1.540(b)(5) Motion for relief from judgment pending contemporary medical/psychiatric/rehabilitative evaluation of Theresa Marie Schiavo", File Number: 90-2908GD-003|author=Gibbs, David C., III, Esq.|date=February 23, 2005|accessdate=May 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Schindlers wanted Schiavo to be tested with an [[fMRI]] and given a swallowing therapy called VitalStim. The motion was accompanied by thirty-three affidavits from doctors in several specialties, speech-language pathologists and therapists, and a few neuropsychologists, all urging that new tests be undertaken.&lt;ref name="Greer-PDF6th"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abstractappeal.com/schiavo/trialctorder030905.pdf |format=PDF|title=In re: The guardianship of Theresa Marie Schiavo, Incapacitated.

On February 28, 2005 the Schindlers filed a motion, asking for permission to attempt to provide Schiavo with "Food and Water by Natural Means." This second motion asked for permission to "attempt to feed" Schiavo by mouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://floridasky.us/terri/022805EmMotionNaturalFeeding.pdf |format=PDF|title=Emergency expedited motion for permission to provide Theresa Schiavo with food and water by natural means, File Number: 90-2908GD-003|page=1|author=Gibbs, David C., III, Esq.|date=February 27, 2005|accessdate=March 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judge Greer denied the second motion on March 8, saying "it has become clear that the second motion is part and parcel of the previous motion on medical evaluations. The same declarations are being used for both motions and the motion appears to be an alternative pleading to the previous motion. Both are asking for an experimental procedure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abstractappeal.com/schiavo/trialctorder030805.pdf |format=PDF|title=In re: The guardianship of Theresa Marie Schiavo, Incapacitated.

Greer noted that "most of the doctor affidavits submitted are based on their understanding of Schiavo's condition from news reports or video clips they have seen. Many are obviously not aware of the medical exams undertaken for the 2002 trial."&lt;ref name="Greer-PDF6th"/&gt;

Following Greer's order on March 18, 2005 to remove the feeding tube, Republicans in the [[United States Congress]] [[subpoena]]ed both Michael and Terri Schiavo to testify at a congressional hearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abstractappeal.com/schiavo/HouseSubpoenas.pdf |format=PDF|title="Subpoena," Committee on Government Reform, U.S. House of Representatives|author=[http://tomdavis.house.gov/ Davis, Tom, Chairman], (for The Committee)|publisher=|date=March 18, 2005|accessdate=September 1, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greer told congressional attorneys, "I have had no cogent reason why the (congressional) committee should intervene." He also stated that last-minute action by Congress does not invalidate years of court rulings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2005-03-18-congress-schiavo_x.htm|title=Schiavo's feeding tube removed despite congressional intervention|author=Unsigned|agency=Associated Press|date=March 18, 2005|accessdate=February 24, 2006|work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.tbo.com/news/MGBLXWESG6E.html|title=Schiavo's Feeding Tube Removed|author=Unsigned|agency=Associated Press|date=March 18, 2005|accessdate=October 1, 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051215160223/http://news.tbo.com/news/MGBLXWESG6E.html |archivedate=December 15, 2005 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Palm Sunday Compromise===
{{Main|Palm Sunday Compromise}}
President [[George W. Bush]] and Congressional Republicans anticipated Greer's adverse ruling well before it was delivered and worked on a daily basis to find an alternative means of overturning the legal process by utilizing the authority of the [[United States Congress]]. On March 20, 2005, the Senate, by [[Standing Rules of the United States Senate|unanimous consent]], passed their version of a relief bill; since the vote was taken by voice vote, there was no official tally of those voting in favor and those opposed. Soon after Senate approval, the House of Representatives passed an identical version of the bill S.686, which came to be called the "[[Palm Sunday Compromise]]" and transferred jurisdiction of the Schiavo case to the federal courts. The bill passed the House on March 21, 2005 at 12:41&amp;nbsp;a.m. ([[UTC-5]]). Bush flew to [[Washington, D.C.]] from his vacation in [[Texas]] in order to sign the bill into law at 1:11&amp;nbsp;a.m.

While the bill had been proposed by Republican Senators [[Rick Santorum]] and [[Mel Martínez]], it also had the support of Democratic Senator [[Tom Harkin]] due to [[disability rights]] concerns in the Schiavo case. Harkin had worked with disability rights groups for years and co-authored the 1990 [[Americans with Disabilities Act]].&lt;ref name="disability rights"/&gt; American disability rights groups traditionally tend to ally themselves with Democrats and the political left;&lt;ref name="disability rights"/&gt; however, in the Schiavo case, they joined pro-life organizations in opposing the removal of her feeding tube and supporting the Palm Sunday Compromise.&lt;ref name="Congress Debate"/&gt; According to [[Marilyn Golden]], Harkin's support was necessary for passage of the bill, as any voice opposition by Democrats would have delayed it.&lt;ref name="disability rights"/&gt;

As in the state courts, all of the Schindlers' federal petitions and appeals were denied, and the U.S. Supreme Court declined to grant [[certiorari]], effectively ending the Schindlers' judicial options. At the same time, the so-called [[Schiavo memo]] surfaced, causing a political firestorm. The memo was written by [[Brian Darling]], the legal counsel to Florida Republican senator [[Mel Martinez]]. It suggested the Schiavo case offered "a great political issue" that would appeal to the party's [[base (politics)|base]] (core supporters) and could be used against Senator [[Bill Nelson (politician)|Bill Nelson]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] from [[Florida]], because he had refused to co-sponsor the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002213728_memo20.html|title=GOP memo says issue offers political rewards|author=Unsigned|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=April 4, 2005|accessdate=March 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nelson easily won re-election in 2006.

Senator and physician [[Bill Frist]] opposed the removal of her feeding tube and in a speech delivered on the Senate Floor, challenged the diagnosis of Schiavo's physicians of Schiavo being in a persistent vegetative state (PVS): "I question it based on a review of the video footage which I spent an hour or so looking at last night in my office".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Frist|first=Bill|title=Bill Frist : a senator speaks out on ethics, respect and compassion|year=2005|publisher=Monument Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=0-9769668-3-2|page=195|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0aFiYpPzsgYC&amp;pg=PA195#v=onepage&amp;q=%22I%20question%20it%20based%20on%20a%20review%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frist was criticized by a medical ethicist at [[Northwestern University]] for making a diagnosis without personally examining the patient and for questioning the diagnosis when he was not a neurologist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rawstory.com/news/2005/Letter_Frist_Schiavo_diagnosis_being_reviewed_in_Te_0630.html Letter: Frist Schiavo diagnosis being reviewed in Tennessee] June 24, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; After her death, the autopsy showed signs of long-term and irreversible damage to her brain consistent with PVS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/schiavo/61305autopsyrpt.pdf Medical Examiner's Report on the Schiavo Autopsy (PDF)] June 13, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Frist defended his actions after the autopsy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anne E.

==Final local motions, death, autopsy, and burial==
On March 24, 2005, Judge Greer denied a petition for intervention by the Department of Children &amp; Families (DCF) and signed an order forbidding the department from "taking possession of Theresa Marie Schiavo or removing her" from the hospice and directed "each and every and singular sheriff of the state of Florida" to enforce his order. The order was appealed to the Second District Court of Appeals the following day, which resulted in an automatic stay under state law. While the stay was in effect, Florida Department of Law Enforcement personnel prepared to take custody of Terri and transfer her to a local hospital for reinsertion of the feeding tube. Once Greer was made aware of the stay, he ordered it lifted and all parties stood down. Governor Bush decided to obey the court order despite enormous pressure from the political right. If Bush (or the Florida Legislature) had ignored Greer's order by attempting to remove her from the hospice, a confrontation between the Pinellas Park Police Department and the FDLE agents could have ensued. In jest, one official said local police discussed "whether we had enough officers to hold off the National Guard".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=Associated Press|title=Report: State Tried Schiavo Grab|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/03/26/national/main683300.shtml|date=March 26, 2005|accessdate=February 23, 2006|work=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Terri Schiavo died at a [[Pinellas Park, Florida|Pinellas Park]] [[Palliative care|hospice]] on March 31, 2005. Although there was concern that Schiavo would experience significant symptoms from [[dehydration]] with the removal of the feeding tube, studies have shown that patients who have their feeding tubes removed, such as the case of Schiavo, usually have a peaceful death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lallanilla|first=Marc|title=Death from Dehydration Is Usually Serene|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/Schiavo/story?id=531907&amp;page=1|accessdate=July 16, 2011|newspaper=ABC News|date=March 18, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Hook CC, Mueller PS |title=The Terri Schiavo saga: the making of a tragedy and lessons learned|journal=Mayo Clin.

After her death, Schiavo's body was taken to the Office of the District 6 Medical Examiner for Pinellas and Pasco counties, based in Largo, Florida. The [[autopsy]] occurred on April 1, 2005. It revealed extensive brain damage. The manner of death was certified as "undetermined". The autopsy was led by Chief Medical Examiner Jon R. Thogmartin, M.D. In addition to consultation with a neuropathologist (Stephen J. Nelson, M.D.), Dr. Thogmartin also arranged for specialized cardiac and genetic examinations to be made. The official autopsy report&lt;ref name="thogmartin" /&gt; was released on June 15, 2005. In addition to studying Terri Schiavo's remains, Thogmartin scoured court, medical and other records and interviewed her family members, doctors and other relevant parties. Examination of Schiavo's nervous system by neuropathologist Stephen J. Nelson, M.D., revealed extensive injury. The [[human brain|brain]] itself weighed only {{convert|615|g|abbr=on}}, only half the weight expected for a female of her age, height, and weight, an effect caused by the loss of a massive number of neurons. Microscopic examination revealed extensive damage to nearly all [[List of regions in the human brain|brain regions]], including the [[cerebral cortex]], the [[thalamus]], the [[basal ganglia]], the [[hippocampus]], the [[cerebellum]], and the [[midbrain]]. The neuropathologic changes in her brain were precisely of the type seen in patients who enter a PVS following cardiac arrest. Throughout the cerebral cortex, the large pyramidal [[Betz cell|neurons]] that comprise some 70% of cortical cells – critical to the functioning of the cortex – were completely lost. The pattern of damage to the cortex, with injury tending to worsen from the front of the cortex to the back, was also typical. There was marked damage to important relay circuits deep in the brain (the thalamus) – another common pathologic finding in cases of PVS. The damage was, in the words of Thogmartin, "irreversible, and no amount of therapy or treatment would have regenerated the massive loss of neurons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/HEALTH/06/15/schiavo.autopsy|title=Autopsy: No sign Schiavo was abused: Findings show woman's brain 'profoundly atrophied'|author=Phillips, Rich, Producer.|publisher=CNN|date=June 7, 2005|accessdate=May 3, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cardiac pathologist who studied Schiavo's heart found it and the [[coronary circulation|coronary vessels]] to be healthy, which excludes the possibility that her initial collapse was the result of [[myocardial infarction]], although there was a localized area of healed inflammation (opening the possibility of [[myocarditis]]). Thogmartin found that "there was no proof that Terri Schiavo ever had an eating disorder such as bulimia." Regarding the possibility of strangulation or domestic violence as a cause of Schiavo's initial collapse, the report states: "No trauma was noted on any of the numerous physical exams or radiographs performed on Mrs. Schiavo on the day of, in the days after, or in the months after her initial collapse. Indeed, within an hour of her initial hospital admission, radiographic examination of her cervical spine was negative. Specifically, external signs of strangulation including cutaneous or deep neck injury, facial/conjunctival petechiae, and other blunt trauma were not observed or recorded during her initial hospital admission. Autopsy examination of her neck structures 15 years after her initial collapse did not detect any signs of remote trauma, but, with such a delay, the exam was unlikely to show any residual neck findings."&lt;ref name="thogmartin" /&gt;

Regarding the cause and manner of Schiavo's death, Thogmartin wrote, "Mrs. Schiavo suffered severe anoxic brain injury. The cause of which cannot be determined with reasonable medical certainty. The manner of death will therefore be certified as undetermined."&lt;ref name="thogmartin" /&gt;

"We were not surprised the medical examiner said Terri's brain was damaged", said Bobby Schindler, Jr., her brother, in an interview hours after the autopsy report was released. "The fact that the medical examiner ruled out bulimia and ruled out a heart attack, without a doubt, adds more questions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.floridabaptistwitness.com/4471.article|title=Terri Schiavo autopsy reports 'undetermined' cause of death; indicates no eating disorder, heart attack or trauma in 1990|author=Joni B.

===Burial===
[[Image:SchiavoGrave.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Schiavo's gravemarker]]
Schiavo's body was [[Cremation|cremated]] following the autopsy. Her parents offered a memorial [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] for her at the Holy Name of Jesus Catholic Church in [[Gulfport, Florida|Gulfport]] on April 5. Father [[Frank Pavone]], founder of [[Priests for Life]],&lt;ref&gt;Pavone, Frank A. "Father Frank A.

On May 7, Schiavo's parents made public a complaint that they had not been informed of when and where the ashes of their daughter had been (or were to be) buried by Michael Schiavo. He was under court order to provide this information to them.

On June 20, the cremated remains of Terri Schiavo were buried. The Schindlers' attorney stated that the family was notified by [[fax]] only after the memorial service; by then, the family had already started getting calls from reporters.&lt;ref&gt;Stacy, Mitch.

&lt;/ref&gt; The ashes were interred at Sylvan Abbey Memorial Park in [[Clearwater, Florida]].

==Ethical and legal issues==

===Right-to-die===
The Schiavo case has been compared to the [[Karen Ann Quinlan case]] and [[Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Department of Health|Nancy Cruzan case]], two landmark right-to-die cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shepherd|first=Lois L.|title=If That Ever Happens to Me: Making Life and Death Decisions After Terri Schiavo|year=2009|publisher=Univ of North Carolina Press|pages=5–6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ghm1TccEMuIC&amp;q=|isbn=978-0-8078-8864-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="M Stonecipher"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stonecipher|first=Matthew|title=The evolution of surrogates' right to terminate life-sustaining treatment|journal=Virtual Mentor: American Medical Association Journal of Ethics|date=September 2006|volume=8|issue=9|pages=593–598|url=http://virtualmentor.ama-assn.org/2006/09/pdf/hlaw1-0609.pdf |format=PDF|accessdate=November 23, 2012|doi=10.1001/virtualmentor.2006.8.9.hlaw1-0609}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quinlan entered a persistent vegetative state in 1975, and her family was allowed to remove her from a ventilator in 1976 after a ruling by the [[New Jersey Supreme Court]] based on her right of privacy. She died of [[pneumonia]] in 1985.&lt;ref name="quinlan death"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=qwgjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jc4FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4910,299074&amp;dq=karen-ann-quinlan&amp;hl=en|title=Karen Ann Quinlan dies after 10 years in a coma|work=St. Petersburg (FL) Evening Independent|date=June 12, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cruzan was diagnosed with PVS in 1983 and her legal case reached the Supreme Court, which ruled that "clear and convincing evidence" of her wishes to die under such circumstances was needed. Cruzan's family did not have enough evidence of that, but later produced more. She died after being removed from life support in 1990.&lt;ref name="cruzan death"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Death of Nancy Cruzan|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/programs/transcripts/1014.html|publisher=Frontline, PBS|date=March 24, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Terri Schiavo case" actually refers to a series of cases. It differed from the Quinlan and Cruzan cases by involving settled law rather than breaking new legal ground on the right-to-die issue. In 2006, Shepherd said that it was "unclear" whether the Schiavo case represents a [[landmark decision]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Lois |last=Shepherd |url=http://www.luc.edu/media/lucedu/law/students/publications/llj/pdfs/shepherd.pdf |title=Terri Schiavo: Unsettling The Settled |journal=Loyola University Chicago Law Journal |year=2006 |volume=37 |page=297 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Schiavo case instead involved a dispute between family members over what Schiavo's wishes would have been for such a situation. According to medical ethicist Matthew Stonecipher, "The movement to challenge the decisions made for Terri Schiavo threatened to destabilize end-of-life law that had developed over the last quarter of the 20th century, principally through the cases of Karen Ann Quinlan and Nancy Cruzan."&lt;ref name="M Stonecipher"/&gt; The outcome of the Schiavo case was also in part determined by a 1990 Florida case, ''Guardianship of Estelle Browning''.&lt;ref name="Browning Schiavo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Browning TBO"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sommer|first=David|title=Schiavo Case Could Cause Change In Law|url=http://news.tbo.com/news/MGA1IEYHYLD.html|accessdate=November 30, 2012|newspaper=Tampa Bay Online|date=October 19, 2003 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031023002811/http://news.tbo.com/news/MGA1IEYHYLD.html |archivedate=October 23, 2003 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that case, George Felos, the attorney for Michael Schiavo in the Schiavo case, represented a Browning relative. Felos successfully argued before the [[Florida Supreme Court]] that Browning's feeding tube should be removed. The elderly Browning had expressed, in a living will, her wish not to be kept alive by any artificial means, including receiving food and water "by a gastric tube or intravenously". At that time, it was common to remove people from ventilators, but the law in Florida was not clear on removing them from feeding tubes. In a landmark ruling, the Florida Supreme Court decided that Browning had "the constitutional right to choose or refuse medical treatment, and that right extends to all relevant decisions concerning one's health".&lt;ref name="Browning Schiavo"/&gt;

===Disability rights===
During the years of legal proceedings, [[disability rights]] groups and activists closely monitored and involved themselves in the case. In March 2003, twelve disability rights groups, led by [[Not Dead Yet]], along with four other amici, filed an [[amicus curiae]] brief in which they opposed the removal of Schiavo's feeding tube.&lt;ref name="amicus brief"&gt;{{cite web|last=Townsend|first=Liz|title=Disability Rights Groups File Amicus Brief in Terri Schiavo Case''|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-98775346.html|publisher=National Right to Life News|accessdate=November 20, 2012}} {{Subscription|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also used the Schiavo case to advocate for federal review in cases where third parties decide to withdraw life support from patients unable to give consent.&lt;ref name="disability rights"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Congress Debate"&gt;{{cite news|last=Stolberg|first=Sheryl Gay|title=Congress Ready to Again Debate End-of-Life Issues|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/28/politics/28cong.html?pagewanted=print&amp;position=&amp;_r=0|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 28, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
They argued that persistent vegetative state is frequently misdiagnosed, and that the reasons for withdrawal of life support from a patient should be scrutinized since even family member surrogates can have conflicts of interest. The [[Palm Sunday Compromise]] granted the federal review they sought, but it was limited to only the Schiavo case.&lt;ref name="disability rights"/&gt;

==Public opinion and activism==
{{Main|Public opinion and activism in the Terri Schiavo case}}

The seven-year case generated a great deal of public attention and activism.&lt;ref name="Lois Shepherd"&gt;{{cite book|last=Shepherd|first=Lois|title=If That Ever Happens to Me: Making Life and Death Decisions after Terri Schiavo (Studies in Social Medicine)|year=2009|publisher=The University of North Carolina Press|isbn=978-0-8078-3295-0|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stolberg NYT"&gt;{{cite news|last=Stolberg|first=Sheryl Gay|title=Schiavo's Case May Reshape American Law|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/01/politics/01legacy.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 1, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was extensive media coverage and both sides courted public opinion.&lt;ref name="Public opinion"&gt;{{cite news|title=Schiavo's parents turn to court of public opinion|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2005/02/15/Hillsborough/Schiavo_s_parents_tur.shtml|agency=Associated Press|date=February 15, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Case Didion"&gt;{{cite web|last=Didion|first=Joan|title=The Case of Theresa Schiavo|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2005/jun/09/the-case-of-theresa-schiavo/?pagination=false|publisher=The New York Review of Books|date=June 9, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the Schindlers created the Terri Schindler-Schiavo Foundation to garner support.&lt;ref name="Funding sources"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nohlgren|first1=Stephen|last2=Zucco|first2=Tom|title=Schiavo case has myriad fund sources|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2005/03/28/news_pf/State/Schiavo_case_has_myri.shtml|newspaper=St. Petersburg Times|date=March 28, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TS press release"&gt;{{cite web|title=Terri Schindler Schiavo Foundation Changes Name; Hones Mission|url=http://www.standardnewswire.com/news/94375568.html|publisher=Terri Schiavo Life &amp; Hope Network press release}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the weeks when Schiavo's feeding tube was removed in 2005, activists kept up an around-the-clock vigil outside her hospice. The protests were described as loud but non-violent. There were dozens of arrests, with most being for crossing a police line with water for Schiavo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/28/national/28cnd-schiavo.html|work=New York Times|title=Schiavo Protesters Have Hearts on Sleeves and Anger on Signs|date=March 28, 2005|accessdate=July 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Protests CBS"&gt;{{cite web|title=Schiavo Protesters' Passions Rise|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-201_162-683326.html|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=November 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two [[opinion poll|polls]] conducted shortly after Schiavo's feeding tube was removed for the final time in 2005 showed that a large majority of [[United States|Americans]] believed that Michael Schiavo should have had the authority to make decisions on behalf of his wife, Terri, and that the [[United States Congress]] overstepped its bounds with its intervention in the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/03/25/opinion/lynch/main683233.shtml|work=CBS News|title=Schiavo Politics, Up Close|date=March 25, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other polls seemed to favor the Schindler family's position, and questions were raised about the wording of all the polls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mysterypollster.com/main/2005/03/schaivo_push_po.html|title=SCHIAVO "PUSH POLL?"|author=Mark Blumenthal|publisher=Mystery Pollster|date=March 23, 2005|accessdate=July 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zogby.com/news/2005/04/06/80-non-terminal-patients-should-not-be-denied-food-water-three-to-one-feeding-tube-should-stay-in-pl/|title=80%: Non-Terminal Patients Should Not be Denied Food, Water; Three-to-One: Feeding Tube Should Stay in Place When Wishes Unknown; Americans Divided on Intervention by Elected Officials|author=unsigned|publisher=Zogby International|date=April 6, 2005|accessdate=July 24, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426175620/http://www.ibopezogby.com/news/2005/04/06/80-non-terminal-patients-should-not-be-denied-food-water-three-to-one-feeding-tube-should-stay-in-pl/ |archivedate=April 26, 2012 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Developments since Schiavo's death==
Since Terri Schiavo's death in March 2005, her family and Michael Schiavo have clashed a number of times. Each side has also worked to promote their own causes related to the case. In April 2005, the families disagreed over Schiavo's burial. The Schindlers had wanted her body to be buried in Florida, while Michael Schiavo said at the time that he would cremate her body and then have her ashes buried in her home state of [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Parents Hold Funeral Mass for Terri Schiavo|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,152578,00.html|agency=Associated Press|date=April 6, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2005, however, Schiavo's ashes were buried in Florida instead. The words "I kept my promise" were included on the marker, referring to his promise to follow what he said was her wish not to be kept alive artificially. The statement angered the Schindlers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Even in Death, Acrimony over Schiavo|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8299372/ns/us_news/t/even-death-acrimony-over-schiavo/|agency=Associated Press|date=June 21, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2005, Michael Schiavo created a [[political action committee]], TerriPAC. It was formed to raise money to support right-to-die candidates and oppose candidates who had voted for government involvement in the Schiavo case.&lt;ref name="TerriPAC OS"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lytle|first=Tamara|title=Schiavo turns rage into TerriPAC|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2005-12-08/news/SCHIAVO08_1_weldon-feeding-tube-congressional-action|publisher=Orlando Sentinel|date=December 8, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, TerriPAC paid a $1,350 fine to the [[Federal Election Commission]] for failing to file complete and timely records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bioethics.miami.edu/research-and-clinical-ethics/terri-schiavo-project/timeline-of-key-events/part-2/index.html|title=Schiavo Timeline, Part 2|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=University of Miami Ethics Programs|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180109181156/http://bioethics.miami.edu/research-and-clinical-ethics/terri-schiavo-project/timeline-of-key-events/part-2/index.html|archivedate=January 9, 2018|deadurl=yes|access-date=|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schiavo shut down the PAC later that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TerriPAC|url=http://www.terripac.com/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010233255/http://www.terripac.com/|archivedate=October 10, 2007|accessdate=November 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Schindlers continued operation of the Terri Schindler Schiavo Foundation, with a new goal of helping individuals in situations similar to Terri's. In April 2010, Michael Schiavo charged that the Schindlers were improperly using Terri's name, as he held the rights to it, and that the family was using the foundation in order to make money. A Florida television station looked at the foundation's tax records and found that for 2008, it paid 64% of the $91,568 it raised in salaries to Terri's father, Robert Schindler, Sr., her sister, Suzanne Vitadamo, and her brother, Robert Schindler, Jr. Their attorney said the foundation does its work effectively and that the high percentage for salaries was due to the small amount of money the foundation raises. He also said that the Schindlers had the right to use Terri's name as she is a public figure.&lt;ref name="TSSF dispute"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wade|first=Jake|title=Terri Schiavo's Family Profiting From Foundation|date=April 30, 2010|url=http://www.13wmaz.com/news/local/story.aspx?storyid=78447&amp;catid=28|publisher=WMAZ}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation had been fined $1,000 shortly before Schiavo's death for failing to file timely paperwork.&lt;ref name="Funding sources"/&gt; In September 2010, the Schindlers renamed the organization the "Terri Schiavo Life and Hope Network".{{cn|date=September 2018}}

In 2006, both Michael Schiavo and the Schindlers released books telling their sides of the story. Schiavo's was called ''Terri: The Truth'', while the Schindlers' was titled ''A Life that Matters: The Legacy of Terri Schiavo – A Lesson for Us All''.&lt;ref name="Schiavo books"&gt;{{cite news|last=Neuman|first=Clayton|title=Another Schiavo Skirmish|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1177007,00.html|work=Time|date=March 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21223">The '''Third Order Regular of St. Francis of Penance''' (or '''Third Order Regular of St. Francis''') is a [[mendicant order]] rooted in the [[Third Order of St. Francis]] which was founded in 1447.

==Foundation==
The twelfth century saw a marked emphasis toward the penitential life, reflected in monastic reforms of [[Romuald]] (+ 1027), and [[Peter Damian]] among others.&lt;ref name=Muscat&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/19970607200759/http://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/fra/FRAht11.html Muscat, Noel ofm. "History of the Franciscan movement", FIOR (Franciscan Institute Outreach - Malta)]&lt;/ref&gt; The Third Order Regular developed from the Third Order Secular movement which arose in the early 13th century from the convergence of groups of penitents who were inspired by the life of [[Francis of Assisi]]. Sometime between 1209 and 1220, Saint Francis communicated with some of these groups through a series of letters entitled the "Exhortations to the Brothers and Sisters of Penance". In 1221 Francis asked Cardinal [[Pope Gregory IX|Ugolino di Conti]] to draft a rule for lay people whose personal circumstances precluded their joining a religious order such as the [[Friars Minor]] or the [[Poor Clares]]. These individuals formed the [[Third Order of Saint Francis]] and were called "tertiaries".&lt;ref name=Robinson&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06217a.htm Robinson, Paschal. "Franciscan Order." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 6. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 17 June 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The organized form of this life, though, can be more reliably traced back to the second half of the thirteenth century. In 1289 the first Franciscan pope, [[Pope Nicholas IV]] decided to recognize the Third Order of San Francis in a formal manner. He gave approval to the Order of Penance, and reissued the “Memoriale Propositi”, the Rule of 1221 in a more juridic form. Those Penitent Franciscans who remained in their homes (married or single) constituted the Secular Third Order (TOS), which since 1978 has been called the Secular Franciscan Order (OFS).&lt;ref name=Quinn&gt;[http://www.franciscanfriarstor.com/aboutus.php Quinn, Pat T.O.R., "TOR History", Franciscan Friars TOR, Province of Immaculate Conception]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some secular tertiaries, who in many cases had their house of meeting, gradually withdrew entirely from the world and so formed religious communities, but without the three vows of religious orders. Some of the penitents began to live communal life dedicating themselves to works of mercy; others began to live in remote places as hermits. Members of religious organizations, such as the [[Beguines]] (women) and [[Beghards]] (men) in the Low Countries, sometimes joined the Third Order. These groups were known as the Religious of the Third Order Regular of St. Francis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.franciscanfriarstor.com/archive/theorder/ Franciscans Third Order Regular - Rome]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1295, [[Pope Boniface VIII]] promulgated the papal bull ''Cupientes cultum'' which approved the style of community life of the tertiaries and the pastoral ministry they offered to the people. He permitted the brothers of penitence (Tertiaries) of northern Germany, to live in community and have oratories in their houses in order to celebrate the divine office. The aim of these fraternities was normally that of taking care of hospitals.&lt;ref name=Muscat/&gt;
 
By the fifteenth century tertiary communities of men and women existed in different parts of Europe.&lt;ref name=Robinson/&gt; In 1447, [[Pope Nicholas V]] united the eremitical communities in Umbria and the Marches which followed the Third Order rule into a single community under a minister general.  This community of men is one part of the Third Order Regular. The order spread throughout Italy. To introduce uniformity to the numerous congregations, in 1521 [[Pope Leo X]] gave a new form to the Rule, retaining much of the Rule published by Nicholas IV and adding new points, especially the three solemn vows of poverty, chastity and obedience.&lt;ref name=Muscat/&gt;

In several countries there was a gradual development of national tertiary orders. Some orders disappeared due to government suppression or war, while others joined with the Italian congregation in a single entity which today is called the Third Order Regular of Saint Francis. The French congregation maintained close ties with the First Order until its extinction during the French Revolution.

===Ireland===
The history of the Third Order Regular in Ireland dates back to the later part of the 14th and early part of the 15th centuries. These tertiary communities were small groups of clerical and lay brothers. The Franciscan Brothers of the Third Order Regular, noted for their having secretly taught the boys of the Catholic population of Ireland for decades in the underground "bog schools", established a monastery and school at Milltown, Dublin, after the relaxation of the Penal Laws which had forbidden Catholic education. In 1818 they transferred their monastery to Mountbellew in County Galway, where the Bellew family had invited them and had donated land and a house to get established. The Brothers ran a free primary school and specialized in trade schools for young men.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.franciscanbrothersosf.org/our-community/our-history/ Higgins, Michael T.O.R., ""Our History", Franciscan Brothers of Brooklyn]&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In the mid-19th century, in response to the request from bishops in the United States, the Brothers accepted apostolic works outside of Ireland. A group of Franciscan Brothers from the community at Mountbellew traveled to the United States to minister as teachers and established permanent foundations in Loretto, Pennsylvania, Brooklyn, New York, and Spaulding, Nebraska.

There are two provinces in the United States: The Province of the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus, Loretto, Pennsylvania, and the Province of the Immaculate Conception, Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania. The Sacred Heart Province focused its efforts on education and developed what is now Saint Francis University and The Franciscan University in Steubenville, Ohio. The Province of the Immaculate Conception was formed out of the need to serve Italian immigrants who came to Pennsylvania to work on the railroad, in the mines, or in steel mills. Eventually, the communities in Pennsylvania and Nebraska were permitted by their bishops to seek consolidation with the friars of the Third Order Regular, by then based in Rome. Papal permission was granted and in 1908, the two communities were incorporated into the Order, and in 1910 were established as the autonomous American Province of the Sacred Heart of the Franciscan Friars of the Third Order Regular.

==== Province of the Sacred Heart of Jesus ====
Prior to 1906, three separate and independent communities of men of the Third Order Regular existed in the United States. All of them were institutes of [[lay brothers]] dedicated to teaching and other works of charity. These were located in [[Brooklyn, New York]] (1858); [[Loretto, Pennsylvania]] (1847); and [[Spalding, Nebraska]], which came about from a school founded for [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] boys (ca. 1882), at the request of [[Bishop]] [[John Ireland (archbishop)|John Ireland]]. The communities at Loretto and Brooklyn had been founded from [[Mountbellew]] Monastery, in [[Tuam]], [[County Galway]], [[Ireland]], at the request of the bishops of Brooklyn and Pittsburgh, respectively. The community in Nebraska was a branch of the Brooklyn community.&lt;ref name=Jarrett&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14637b.htm Jarrett, Bede, Ferdinand Heckmann, Benedict Zimmerman, Livarius Oliger, Odoric Jouve, Lawrence Hess, and John Doyle. "Third Orders." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 14. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 13 June 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

As communities of lay Brothers, they were under the authority of their local bishops, who acted [[canon law|canonically]] as the [[superior general]] of the community within their [[diocese]]. The Brothers, however, came to desire a closer connection with the wider Franciscan Order. Additionally, due to the desire of some of the Brothers for [[ordination]], as well as seeing a need to have the [[pastoral care]] of both the Brothers and their students coming from within their community, Brothers Raphael Brehenny, O.S.F., and his successor, Brother Linus Lynch, O.S.F., the superiors of the Brooklyn community, asked the bishop of that diocese for permission to have some of the members of that community ordained as [[priesthood (Catholic Church)|priests]]. This request the bishop refused, as the community had been introduced into the diocese for the care of parish schools, and the bishop feared that in the event of its members becoming priests this work would suffer. Thus, in May 1906, a petition was then sent to the [[minister general]], the [[Most Rev.]] [[Father (title)|Fr.]] Angelus de Mattia, T.O.R., asking for union with the [[friar]]s of the Third Order Regular of St. Francis in Italy. The [[Roman Catholic Bishop of Brooklyn|Bishop of Brooklyn]], however, worked actively to block this effort, and it was halted.&lt;ref name=Jarrett/&gt;

In November of that same year, the Spalding community made the same request to Fr. Angelo, the minister general in Rome. In their case, however, the local bishop was in accord with their desire and gave his authorization for such a merger. The following December 8, the minister general, Fr. Angelo, signed a decree of union of the Spalding community with the Third Order Regular. In January 1907, he formally petitioned the [[Holy See]] to allow the establishment of a community of the Order in Nebraska, and to receive the vows of any qualified Brothers there. This was granted immediately, with the official approval and blessing of Pope Saint [[Pius X]] being formally declared that following November. The Brothers were received into the Order by Fr. Stanislaus Dujmoric, T.O.R., of the [[Ecclesiastical Province|Province]] of [[Dalmatia]], who had been sent as the official delegate of the minister general to supervise the merger.&lt;ref name=Jarrett/&gt;

As their own union could not be effected, some of the Brooklyn Brothers determined to ask for a dispensation from their [[religious vows]] in order to join the friars in Nebraska. In the spring of 1907, several left New York and transferred to Spalding. The former superior, Bro. Raphael, appears to have been among them. That July, led by Bro. Linus, 23 Brothers also left Brooklyn and went to Spalding. At that point, the Nebraska community had increased from the initial size of six to thirty. Relying heavily upon the teaching experience of the New York Brothers, the community opened Spalding College in January 1908.

During that year of upheaval for the Brooklyn foundation, the diocesan community of Franciscan Brothers at Loretto—now in the new [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Altoona-Johnstown|Diocese of Altoona]]—also sought incorporation with the Third Order Regular friars with the approval of their bishop, the Rt. Rev. [[Eugene A. Garvey]]. This was done on December 29, 1907. Permission for their admission received papal approval on May 22, 1908, and the union was achieved on May 28. To oversee this process, the minister general in Rome sent Fr. Jerome Zazzara, T.O.R., as his delegate, assisted by Fr. Anthony Balastieri, T.O.R. Brother Raphael and three other Brothers came from Spalding to help in the process.

At the request of Bishop Garvey, who was struggling to meet the needs of [[Italian (language)|Italian-speaking]] Catholics, Fr. Jerome accepted charge of the Church of St. Anthony of Padua at [[Johnstown, Pennsylvania]], in November 1909 as a permanent [[Christian ministry|ministry]] of the friars, appointing his fellow [[Italian (people)|Italian]], Fr. Anthony, as [[pastor]]. With the establishment of a small community of friars in that parish, there now existed three separate communities in the United States, the minimum canonically required for an independent province. The following month, Fr. Jerome also accepted the Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, [[Altoona, Pennsylvania]], and took on the office of pastor himself.

The four houses in the United States were erected into a province, 24 September 1910, under the title of the Province of the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus. Fr. Jerome was appointed as the first [[Provincial superior|minister provincial]]. The [[Archbishop of Chicago]] later gave the friars charge of Sts. Peter and Paul Slavic Church in that city, and a new college was to be opened at Sioux City, Iowa, in 1912. At that point, the American Province had five [[friary|friaries]], two colleges, 65 professed members, and 20 [[novice]]s and [[postulant]]s. Fr. Raphael Brehenny, original superior of the Brooklyn Brothers, was elected the first native minister provincial in 1913. The provincial motherhouse is at [[St. Francis University]], Loretto, Pennsylvania.

==== Province of the Immaculate Conception ====
The other province, Immaculate Conception, has its headquarters at St. Bernadine Monastery in [[Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania]]. This province came about as the result of a dispute over the eligibility of the Italian friars to vote in the Provincial [[Chapter (religion)|Chapter]] of 1918. The Minister General was unable to oversee the proceedings due to the hostilities between the United States and Italy during [[World War I]]. He thus appointed an American friar as his Delegate, who oversaw that Chapter. This friar declared that the foreign friars still belonged to their Italian provinces and thus were ineligible to vote in the Chapter. These friars, along with some Americans, refused to accept the election of a new Minister Provincial which took place. This resulted in the newly elected Minister Provincial and the then-current one both claiming the office.

The matter was referred to the [[Sacred Congregation]] in Rome. That office declared that, for the sake of peace, a new Chapter should be held under the presidency of a friar from another Province, and that the Italian friars should declare their intention to transfer formally from their original Provinces. That Chapter, held in 1919, resulted in the same results as the previous one. By that time, however, discontent among the Italian friars and others was so deep that the Italian friars and their supporters petitioned to form a separate [[Commissariat]] (a semi-autonomous division in the Order). This was approved in 1920, and the new Commissariat numbered thirteen friars—five Italians and eight Americans. Fr. Jerome was appointed Commissary Provincial.

Five years later, the Dalmatian friar, Fr. Stanislaus, who had supervised the union of the Spalding community into the Order was now Minister General. He raised the Commissariat to the status of a Province. Fr. Jerome was elected the first Minister Provincial. The Province still staffs the two original parishes in [[Pennsylvania]], as well as two in [[Minnesota]]. It also runs retreat centers in [[Orlando, Florida]] and [[West Virginia]]. The current Minister Provincial (2010) is the Very Rev. J. Patrick Quinn, T.O.R.
In 1920, the Province divided and the Province of the Immaculate Conception were established. Friars from the [[Spain|Spanish]] Province were invited to the United States to work with the [[Spanish language|Spanish-speaking]] populations of Texas and New York.

A number of the Brothers in Brooklyn also sought to join the congregation in Italy, but were denied permission by the local bishop, who was concerned that he might lose services as teachers. The Brooklyn foundation became the [[Franciscan Brothers of Brooklyn]].

In 1938, American friars were sent to establish the Order's first [[mission (station)|foreign missions]] in [[Bhagalpur]], [[India]], and later a mission was founded in [[Paraguay]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.franciscanway.org/sacredhearthistory.html "History", Sacred Heart Province]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Philippines ===
Towards the end of the 1980s the [http://www.provinciasanfrancescotor.it/ TOR Province of Assisi, Italy], promoted vocations in the [[Philippines]]. Four young men replied to the invitation. Out of the four, two became priests, Fr. Dante Anhao and Fr. Milestone Japin. Fr. Dante Anhao (still a deacon at that time) together with Fr. Carlo Stradaioli and Fr. Marcello Fadda, came to the Philippines in 1997. They were welcomed by Bishop Emilio Bataclan, DD, the Ordinary of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Iligan|Diocese of Iligan]]. This was the beginning of the TOR Philippine Mission under the Assisi Province.

The small community of three friars has grown in number as some young men came and received formation. Fr. Nilo Laput, a diocesan priest, who stayed with a local Franciscan community in [[Labason, Zamboanga del Norte]], through the invitation of former Minister General, the  late Most Rev. Fr. Bonaventure Midili, TOR came to join the new community in 1999. He received his novitiate formation in Assisi, Italy. Alvin Galicia, a former member of Fr. Laput’s community in Labason, came later and also did his novitiate formation in Italy.

At first the friars and their candidates lived in two semi-concrete houses before the establishment of a permanent friary and formation house in 2005. By this time, the temporary professed friars studied theology at [http://www.sjvts.org/ St. John Vianney Theological Seminary] (SJVTS) in [[Cagayan de Oro]], a city about eighty kilometers from Iligan. In 2007, Fr. George Mailadil, TOR, a friar from Ranchi Province, India, came to help in the formation of the friars in theology in Cagayan de Oro.

In 2009, with the support of Fr. George Mailadil, it was decided that the theological studies of the Junior Friars will be transferred from Saint John Vianney Theological Seminary (SJVTS) to St. Alphonsus Theological and Mission Institute (SATMI) in [[Davao City]]. Davao City is around four thousand kilometers away from Iligan or Cagayan de Oro. At first, they were renting a house in the city while a simple house was constructed in a two-hectare land in Indangan.

On January 6, 2012, the small TOR Philippine Mission was raised to the status of a Delegation. By this, we are now directly under the [http://www.francescanitor.org/?lang=en TOR Generalate in Rome] in terms of administration and decisions. The statutes of the new delegation was drafted and was approved by the General Minister on March 20, 2012. The name of the new delegation is '''The Delegation of Saints Cosmas and Damian.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.torpilipinas.com/sts-cosmas-damian|title=Franciscan TOR - Philippines|website=Franciscan TOR - Philippines|access-date=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary TOR==
As the traditional spirituality of the Third Order Regular derives from the Franciscan Penitence Movement the specification “de poenitentia” is always added beside the name of the Order.

The Basilica of Sts. Cosmas and Damian, Rome, is the home of the central government of the Order under the direction of a Minister General. The Order is divided into several provinces composed of friars, (brothers). Some of the friars are ordained priests or studying for ordination, but ordination is not necessary to be a member of the Order. Every six years elected representatives from the Provinces meet in General Chapter to elect the Minister General and his Council and to make decisions for the whole Order.

As of 2016 the Third Order Regular of Saint Francis is present in Italy, Croatia, Spain, France, Germany, the United States, India, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Brazil, Paraguay, Mexico, Peru, Sweden, Bangladesh, and the Philippines.  There are 208 convents. Members are assist in pastoral care within parishes, and are engaged with help for the needy, schools for the young, teaching, and missionary work. Members of the Third Order Regular wear a black habit rather than the brown habit worn by First Order congregations focused on poverty and the itinerant preaching of the Gospel.&lt;ref name=Quinn/&gt;

More than 448 congregations profess the "Rule and Life of the Brothers and Sisters of the Third Order Regular of St. Francis." There are 18 male congregations of Tertiary Franciscans, 370 congregations of Franciscan Sisters and 60 monasteries of cloistered nuns. The Third Order congregations of men and women number over 200,000 male and female religious.

A new Rule, written by friars and sisters of various congregations, was approved by [[Pope Paul VI]] in 1978. It is the current Rule followed by all congregations of the Third Order Regular, both men and women.

===Kali for Women and Zubaan Books===
Kali for Women, India's first exclusively feminist publishing house, which Butalia co-founded with and Ritu Menon, was set up in 1984 as a trust to increase the body of knowledge on women in the Third World, to give voice to such knowledge as already exists, and to provide a forum for women writers, creative and academics.&lt;ref&gt;Puri, Jyoti, ''Woman, Body, Desire in Postcolonial India: Narratives of Gender and Sexuality'' (London: Routledge, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, co-founders Urvashi Butalia and Ritu Menon parted ways due to unresolvable differences. Thereafter, Butalia started [[Zubaan Books]], which besides feminist books also published fiction, general interest books and children's titles, while Menon started Women Unlimited.&lt;ref name=mint&gt;{{cite web|first=Somak|last=Ghoshal| title = Urvashi Butalia: I want to prove that feminist publishing can survive commercially|publisher= Livemint| url =http://www.livemint.com/Companies/595QfElEltDLfuvgNqTiOI/Urvashi-Butalia--I-want-to-prove-that-feminist-publishing-c.html|date=14 June 2013|accessdate = 16 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Butalia and Menon were jointly conferred the [[Padma Shri]], India's fourth highest civilian award, by the [[Government of India]].&lt;ref name=pib2&gt;{{cite press release|title=Padma Awards Announced|url=http://www.pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=69364|publisher=[[Ministry of Home Affairs (India)|Ministry of Home Affairs]] |date=25 January 2011|accessdate=16 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=President Confers Padma Awards|url=http://news.outlookindia.com/items.aspx?artid=716285|accessdate=26 April 2013|newspaper=Outlook India|date=24 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Other Side of Silence''===
Apart from several newspaper articles and [[op-ed]] pieces dealing with feminist issues, Butalia has authored or co-authored seven books, listed below. Of these, ''The Other Side of Silence'' (1998) is being used as a text in some Indian universities. The book is the product of more than seventy interviews that Butalia conducted with survivors of the [[Partition of India|Partition]], and emphasises particularly the role of violence against women in the collective experience of the tragedy.

Butalia points out that the Partition is, like the [[holocaust]], still very much a "living history", in the sense that many survivors are still around and can be interviewed. In contrast to the many projects that have undertaken to document the oral histories of the Holocaust, few comparable initiatives have been undertaken in India. This is one of them.

== Activism ==
Butalia is an associate of the [[Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press]] (WIFP).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wifp.org/who-we-are/associates/|title=Associates {{!}}  The Women’s Institute for Freedom of the Press|website=www.wifp.org|language=en-US|access-date=21 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wesley Carter Welker''' (born May 1, 1981) is a former [[American football]] [[wide receiver]] who is currently an assistant coach for the [[Houston Texans]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL). He played [[college football]] for the [[Texas Tech Red Raiders football|Texas Tech Red Raiders]] and was signed by the [[San Diego Chargers]] as an [[undrafted free agent]] in 2004. Welker went on to also play for the [[Miami Dolphins]],  [[New England Patriots]],  [[Denver Broncos]], and [[St. Louis Rams]].

Despite being undrafted, Welker had a successful career. Only one player in NFL history, [[Gale Sayers]], had more all-purpose yards in his first three NFL seasons than Welker did with the Dolphins; Welker holds the Dolphins' all-time records for total kickoff returns, kickoff return yardage, and total punt returns. Welker also holds the record for most receptions by any undrafted player in NFL history, passing [[Rod Smith (wide receiver)|Rod Smith]] in 2014.&lt;ref name="UndraftedRecord"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Klis|first1=Mike|last2=Renck|first2=Troy|last3=Moss|first3=Irv|title=Broncos' Wes Welker humbly passes Rod Smith for "undrafted" record|url=http://www.denverpost.com/broncos/ci_26670469/broncos-wes-welker-humbly-passes-rod-smith-undrafted|work=Denver Post|accessdate=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He retired with 16,797 all-purpose yards.

As a Patriot, Welker led the league in receptions in [[2007 NFL season|2007]], [[2009 NFL season|2009]], and [[2011 NFL season|2011]]. Welker holds the four highest single-season reception totals in Patriots' history, as well as four of the top 10 receiving yardage totals, including the franchise record. He also holds the franchise records for most receptions in a single game, most receiving yards in a single game, longest reception, and career receptions.&lt;ref name="Pats Bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patriots.com/team/index.cfm?ac=playerbio&amp;bio=31608|title=Wes Welker – Official New England Patriots Biography|work=[[New England Patriots]]|accessdate=2009-12-29|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091217032710/http://www.patriots.com/team/index.cfm?ac=playerbio&amp;bio=31608|archivedate=2009-12-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Welker, who had three consecutive 110-reception seasons (and has five total), is the first receiver in NFL history with at least three 110-reception seasons, and the first with five 100-reception seasons. Welker was selected to the [[Pro Bowl]], the All-Pro Team, or both, in every season of his Patriots career.

==Early years==
Welker started his football career at [[Heritage Hall School|Heritage Hall High School]] in Oklahoma City.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/sportsextra/okpreps/st-louis-rams-sign-former-heritage-hall-receiver-wes-welker/article_241314c2-d068-5e74-8cd5-6035abb31b94.html |title=St. Louis Rams sign former Heritage Hall receiver Wes Welker |work=Tulsa World |access-date=2018-03-15 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his junior year, he helped lead the Chargers to the 2A State Football championship over Tishomingo High School. In that game, Welker had three touchdowns, over 200 all-purpose yards, a 47-yard field goal, and an interception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/sports/nfl/20080202-0123-fbn-superbowl-welker.html|title=Back in Oklahoma, story of Welker's rise to glory is often told|publisher=Signonsandiego.com|date=2008-02-02|accessdate=2012-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in 1999, he was named ''[[The Daily Oklahoman]]'' All-State Player of the Year, as well as Oklahoma State Player of the Year by ''[[USA Today]]''.

Welker played in the 2000 [[Oil Bowl (high school)|Oil Bowl]], scoring a 40-yard field goal for the Oklahoma team. Out of high school, Welker was not recruited heavily, as he was considered to be too small to play at the college level. However, after a recruit at Texas Tech backed out of his scholarship, it was offered to Welker.&lt;ref name="College Career"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.www.dailytoreador.com/media/storage/paper870/news/2007/03/26/Sports/Greatest.Tech.Athelete.Poll.Wes.Welker.And.Zach.Thomas.Profiles-2790280.shtml?reffeature=htmlemailedition |title=Greatest Tech athlete poll: Wes Welker and Zach Thomas profiles |work=[[The Daily Toreador]] |date=March 26, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929084135/http://media.www.dailytoreador.com/media/storage/paper870/news/2007/03/26/Sports/Greatest.Tech.Athelete.Poll.Wes.Welker.And.Zach.Thomas.Profiles-2790280.shtml?reffeature=htmlemailedition |archivedate=September 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Said Welker of the experience:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I was thinking I'd get a scholarship somewhere. When it didn't happen when it was supposed to, on signing day, I was pretty hurt by it. … In the end, I don't think I could've picked a better school than Texas Tech."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/patriots/2008-01-28-welker-cover_N.htm|title=Patriots' Welker goes from bit player to center stage|work=[[USA Today]]|date=January 28, 2008 | first=Jarrett | last=Bell}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At Heritage Hall, Welker was a prolific contributor on offense, defense, and special teams. As a running back, he scored 80 touchdowns (53 rushing and 27 receiving). As a defensive back, he had 190 tackles, 22 interceptions (three of which he returned for touchdowns), and nine fumble recoveries. As a punt returner, he scored seven touchdowns. As a kicker, he kicked 35 field goals and 165 extra points. His longest field goal was 58 yards.

==College career==
While attending [[Texas Tech University]], Welker played for the [[Texas Tech Red Raiders football|Texas Tech Red Raiders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/players/wes-welker-1.html |title=Wes Welker College Stats |website=College Football at Sports-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; His last-minute signing proved to be very beneficial for the Red Raider football team. Based on a highlight reel from high school, Welker earned the nickname "The Natural", given to him by his recruiter, and then running backs coach at Texas Tech, [[Art Briles]], before his freshman year for his versatility and big-game performances.&lt;ref name="College Career 2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/patriots/2007-11-23-sw-wes-welker_N.htm|title=Early frustration couldn't stop Welker's emergence|work=[[USA Today]]|date=November 23, 2007 | first=Tom | last=Pedulla}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="College Career 3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eagletribune.com/pusports/local_story_322093916?keyword=secondarystory+page=0|title=The Natural: Welker goes from unknown to irreplaceable|publisher=[[The Eagle-Tribune]]|date=November 18, 2007|access-date=2007-11-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209001000/http://www.eagletribune.com/pusports/local_story_322093916?keyword=secondarystory+page=0|archive-date=2008-12-09|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a freshman, he had 26 receptions for 334 yards to go along with a 42-yard rushing touchdown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/players/wes-welker-1/gamelog/2000/ |title=Wes Welker 2000 Game Log |website=College Football at Sports-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a sophomore, he had 50 receptions for 582 yards and two touchdowns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/players/wes-welker-1/gamelog/2001/ |title=Wes Welker 2001 Game Log |website=College Football at Sports-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a junior, he had 86 receptions for 1,054 yards and seven touchdowns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/players/wes-welker-1/gamelog/2002/ |title=Wes Welker 2002 Game Log |website=College Football at Sports-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a senior, he had 97 receptions for 1,099 yards and nine touchdowns to go along with a four-yard rushing touchdown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/players/wes-welker-1/gamelog/2003/ |title=Wes Welker 2003 Game Log |website=College Football at Sports-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over his four-year career, he had 259 receptions for 3,019 yards and 21 [[touchdown]]s and 79 rushes for 456 yards and two touchdowns. He also scored eight touchdowns returning punts in his career, which earns him a second place tie for the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] record,&lt;ref name="College Career" /&gt; behind [[Dante Pettis]] who has 9.

In 2003, Welker won the [[Mosi Tatupu Award]], given annually to the best special teams player in college football. Welker was also named to the ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' All-Decade Team as a punt returner.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

===San Diego Chargers (2004)===
Welker, who went undrafted during the [[2004 NFL Draft]], signed as an [[undrafted free agent]] with the [[San Diego Chargers]]. Welker made the Chargers out of training camp, but was released after the first game of the season when the Chargers claimed safety [[Clinton Hart]] off waivers. [[Head coach]] [[Marty Schottenheimer]] later acknowledged that in terms of roster cuts, releasing Welker was the "biggest mistake [he] ever made".&lt;ref&gt;Howe, Jeff.

After the Chargers released Welker, he passed through waivers. Although the Chargers offered him a slot on their [[practice squad]], Welker chose to sign with the [[Miami Dolphins]] instead, where he was mostly used on [[special teams]]. Playing against the [[New England Patriots]] on October 10, 2004, Welker became the second player in NFL history to return a kickoff and a punt, kick an extra point and a [[Field goal (football)|field goal]], and make a [[Tackle (football move)|tackle]] in a single game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200410100nwe.htm |title=Miami Dolphins at New England Patriots - October 10th, 2004 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 20, Welker had a 71-yard punt return to set up Miami's first touchdown in a 29–28 victory over the Patriots on ''[[Monday Night Football]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200412200mia.htm |title=New England Patriots at Miami Dolphins - December 20th, 2004 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the regular season finale against the Baltimore Ravens, he had 95-yard kickoff return touchdown in the 30–23 loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200501020rav.htm |title=Miami Dolphins at Baltimore Ravens - January 2nd, 2005 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, he finished the 2004 season with 61 kick returns for 1,415 net yards and a touchdown to go along with 43 punt returns for 464 net yards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/W/WelkWe00/gamelog/2004/ |title=Wes Welker 2004 Game Log |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After rumors that he would be cut during the preseason, Welker started off being the lone bright spot in the struggling Dolphins' offense. Through five games, he netted a team-high 29 catches and team-high 299 yards. On October 8, 2006, he was a huge target for back-up [[quarterback]] [[Joey Harrington]], recording a then career-high nine catches for 77 yards in a 20–10 loss to the Patriots.

====Trade to New England====
[[Image:patriotsgiants 046.jpg|thumb|Welker (right) being interviewed after the final game of the undefeated [[2007 New England Patriots season|2007 Patriots]] regular season]]
On March 1, 2007, the Dolphins offered Welker, a restricted free agent, a second-round tender of $1.35 million for a one-year contract. News reports indicated the New England Patriots, who were interested in Welker, had originally considered signing him to an offer sheet (Miami would have had seven days to match the offer); according to ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', that sheet would have contained a [[poison pill#Sports|poison pill]] provision that would have made the offer difficult for the Dolphins to match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/sports/football/patriots/articles/2007/10/17/patriots_pounced_fast_to_grab_welker|title=How Patriots grabbed wide receiver Wes Welker from Dolphins|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|first=Mike|last=Reiss|date=2007-10-17|accessdate=2010-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, however, the Patriots decided not to use such an offer and traded their 2007 second-round draft pick and a seventh-round draft pick to the Dolphins for Welker.

====2007 season====

{{See also|2007 New England Patriots season}}

Welker's first season as a Patriot eclipsed his 2006 season as a Dolphin; he bettered his totals for receptions, touchdowns, and yardage in his first ten games. In Week 1, he caught the first of the Patriots' record 75 touchdowns, equaling the one receiving touchdown he had scored in his three seasons with the Dolphins. He set career highs for single-game yardage three times in 2007: in the Patriots' Week 6 win against the [[2007 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]], Welker had 11 catches for 124 yards and two touchdowns (all career bests);&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200710140dal.htm |title=New England Patriots at Dallas Cowboys - October 14th, 2007 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; the next week, against the [[2007 Miami Dolphins season|Dolphins]], he had nine catches for 138 yards and two more touchdowns (the most receiving yards of any NFL player that week);&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200710210mia.htm |title=New England Patriots at Miami Dolphins - October 21st, 2007 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Week 12, against the [[2007 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]], he had 13 receptions for 149 yards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200711250nwe.htm |title=Philadelphia Eagles at New England Patriots - November 25th, 2007 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Week 15, against the [[2007 New York Jets season|New York Jets]], Welker reached 1,000 receiving yards for the first time in his career;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200712160nwe.htm |title=New York Jets at New England Patriots - December 16th, 2007 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Week 16, against the Dolphins, he recorded his 101st reception of the season, tying the Patriots franchise record set by [[Troy Brown]] in [[2001 NFL season|2001]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200712230nwe.htm |title=Miami Dolphins at New England Patriots - December 23rd, 2007 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/nwe/single-season-receiving.htm |title=New England Patriots Single-Season Receiving Leaders |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Week 17, against the [[2007 New York Giants season|Giants]], he caught 11 more passes, setting the Patriots franchise record for catches with 112, and tying [[Cincinnati Bengals|Bengals]] receiver [[T.

Welker, who finished the season with 1,175 yards and eight touchdowns, received one vote for [[National Football League Offensive Player of the Year Award|NFL Offensive Player of the Year]], an award won by his quarterback, [[Tom Brady]], and was voted to his first AP All-Pro Team (second team).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/W/WelkWe00/gamelog/2007/ |title=Wes Welker 2007 Game Log |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the season-ending injury to quarterback [[Tom Brady]] in Week 1, he continued to amass receptions at the same pace through the first half of the season with [[Matt Cassel]]: through eight games, he had 56 receptions, but only one touchdown reception. He had six or more receptions in each of the Patriots' first 11 games, breaking [[Jimmy Smith (wide receiver)|Jimmy Smith]]'s mark of eight games at the start of the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]]' [[2001 Jacksonville Jaguars season|2001 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patriots.com/news/index.cfm?ac=latestnewsdetail&amp;pid=35042&amp;pcid=47|title=Patriots vs. Bills game notes|work=[[New England Patriots]]|date=2008-11-09|accessdate=2010-01-11}}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=Red Director |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Welker had what was, at the time, the longest pass play of his NFL career in the Patriots' 48–28 victory over the Miami Dolphins in Week 12: on 2nd-and-8 from their own 15, Welker caught a 5-yard pass from [[Matt Cassel]], before eluding a pair of defenders tip-toeing and running down the left sideline to the Miami 21, for a total of 64 yards, 59 yards after the catch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200811230mia.htm |title=New England Patriots at Miami Dolphins - November 23rd, 2008 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Welker was fined $10,000 by the NFL for celebrating a December 21 touchdown against the [[Arizona Cardinals]] by lying down in the snow by the [[endzone]] and using his body to make a [[snow angel]], violating a recent [[National Football League|NFL]] rule change making going to ground after a touchdown unsportsmanlike conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3792441|title=Pats' Welker fined for TD antic|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=2008-12-24|accessdate=2009-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2009 season====

{{See also|2009 New England Patriots season}}

Welker was sidelined in Weeks 2 and 3 (against the [[New York Jets]] and [[Atlanta Falcons]], respectively) with a knee injury; rookie [[wide receiver]] [[Julian Edelman]] took his place in the lineup. In the Week 6 game against the [[Tennessee Titans]] on October 18, Welker caught 10 passes for 150 yards, a new career high (at the time), and two touchdowns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200910180nwe.htm |title=Tennessee Titans at New England Patriots - October 18th, 2009 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second of Welker's touchdowns was Tom Brady's NFL record fifth touchdown in a single quarter.

Welker set career marks again in the Patriots' Week 11 rematch against the Jets: targeted 17 times, he caught 15 passes — at the time the highest single-game total for any player in the NFL in 2009 — for 192 yards, and added 11 rushing yards on a reverse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200911220nwe.htm |title=New York Jets at New England Patriots - November 22nd, 2009 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Week 13 against the Dolphins, Welker recorded 167 receiving yards to eclipse the 1,000-yard mark for the third straight season. Against the [[Miami Dolphins]] in Week 13, Welker tallied 167 yards on 10 catches, including a season long 58-yard reception over the middle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200912060mia.htm |title=New England Patriots at Miami Dolphins - December 6th, 2009 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Patriots' Week 14 win at home against the [[Carolina Panthers]], Welker caught 10 passes (out of 19 total completions for Brady) for 105 yards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200912130nwe.htm |title=Carolina Panthers at New England Patriots - December 13th, 2009 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gave him 105 receptions in just 11 games and Welker led the NFL in receptions at that point. The performance also made Welker the fourth receiver in NFL history (after [[Jerry Rice]], [[Herman Moore]], and [[Marvin Harrison]], and tied with [[Brandon Marshall]] who did it in the same seasons as Welker) to catch 100 passes in three consecutive seasons.

In Week 16, Welker caught 13 passes, giving him 7 games with double digit receptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200912270nwe.htm |title=Jacksonville Jaguars at New England Patriots - December 27th, 2009 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gave him the record for most double digit reception games in a single season, passing [[Marvin Harrison]]. He accomplished this despite missing two games earlier in the season. 
[[Image:Wes Welker 1.JPG|thumb|alt=|Wes Welker before a game against the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] on September 12, 2010.]]

Welker finished the season with a league-high 123 receptions (the second-highest total in NFL history) and finished second in yardage, behind Houston's [[Andre Johnson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/rec_single_season.htm |title=NFL Receptions Single-Season Leaders |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2009/receiving.htm |title=2009 NFL Receiving |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also selected to represent the AFC in the [[2010 Pro Bowl|Pro Bowl]] for the second consecutive year, and, for the first time in his career, was named to the [[All-Pro]] First Team. Because of the knee injury he could not play in the Pro Bowl, and was replaced on the Pro Bowl roster by teammate [[Randy Moss]].

In the Patriots' Week 9 loss to the [[Cleveland Browns]], after an injury to kicker [[Stephen Gostkowski]], Welker was asked to kick an [[extra point]] for the first time since he did so in 2004 against the Patriots; he converted the attempt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/201011070cle.htm |title=New England Patriots at Cleveland Browns - November 7th, 2010 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While attending [[Texas Tech University]], Welker was a Texas Epsilon chapter member of the [[Phi Delta Theta]] fraternity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phideltatheta.org/index.php?Itemid=129&amp;id=24&amp;option=com_content&amp;task=view|title=Phi Delta Theta Athletics|work=[[Phi Delta Theta]]|accessdate=2010-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Welker graduated from Texas Tech University in 2003 with a [[Bachelor of Business Administration]] degree in [[Management]] from the [[Rawls College of Business]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://issuu.com/tturawlscollege/docs/prospective_students_rawls_college|title=Prospective Students Viewbook|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Welker established the 83 Foundation (after his NFL uniform number). The foundation, renamed the Wes Welker Foundation in December 2009, states its goal is "to influence at-risk youth, by encouraging their full potential through athletics and positive role models". Its work primarily benefits schools and other organizations in Welker's hometown of Oklahoma City.

In 2012, Welker married former swimsuit model Anna Burns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1940602-anna-burns-welker-wes-welkers-wife-a-potential-super-bowl-xlviii-hot-topic|title=Anna Burns Welker: Wes Welker's Wife a Potential Super Bowl XLVIII Hot Topic|first=Dan|last=Carson|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have three children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2017/07/20/wes-welkers-post-football-life-crisis/|title=Wes Welker’s post-football life crisis|date=2017-07-20|work=New York Post|access-date=2018-05-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Welker owns a chestnut colored gelding racehorse called Undrafted, trained by [[Wesley A.

{{Christianity and gender|theology}}

The '''women in the Bible''' are rarely mentioned by name, with named women representing only 5.5 to 8 percent of the total of all named characters, male and female.  This suggests that women were not usually in the forefront of public life. Those women that are named, rose to prominence for reasons outside the ordinary. They are often an aspect of the over-turning of man-made power structures commonly found in a biblical literary device called a "reversal." [[Abigail]] and [[Esther]], [[Jael]] who drove a tent peg into the enemy commander's temple while he slept, are a few examples of women who turned the tables on men with power. The [[Matriarchs (Bible)|founding matriarchs]] are mentioned by name, as are some prophetesses, judges, heroines, and Queens, while the common woman is largely, though not completely, unseen. The slave [[Hagar]]'s story is told, and the prostitute [[Rahab]]'s story is also told, along with a few others like them. 

All [[Ancient Near East|Ancient Near Eastern]] societies were [[patriarchal]], and the Bible is a patriarchal document, written by men from a patriarchal age.  Many scholars see the primary emphasis of the Bible as reinforcing women's subordinate status. However, there are also scholars who claim there is a kind of [[gender blindness]] in the Bible as well as patriarchy. Marital laws in the Bible favored men, as did inheritance laws. There were strict laws of sexual behavior with adultery a crime punishable by [[stoning]]. A woman in ancient Bible days was always under the authority of a man and was subject to strict purity laws, both ritual and moral. However, women such as [[Deborah]], the [[Woman of Shunem|Shunnemite woman]], and the prophetess [[Huldah]], rise above societal limitations in their stories. The Bible contains many noted narratives of women as both victors and victims, women who change the course of events, and women who are powerless and unable to affect their own destinies. 

The [[New Testament]] refers to a number of women in [[Jesus]]’ inner circle, and he is generally seen by scholars as dealing with women with respect. The New Testament names many women in positions of leadership in the early church as well. There are controversies within the contemporary Christian church concerning women. For example, [[Paul the Apostle]] refers to [[Junia (New Testament person)|Junia]] as "outstanding among the apostles" and there is disagreement over whether Junia was a woman and an apostle, and [[Mary Magdalene]]'s role as a leader is also disputed. Sexuality has played a major role in these issues which have impacted, and continue to impact, how the modern Christian church sees the role of women. These changing views of women in the Bible are reflected in art and culture. 

==Women, sex, and law in surrounding cultures==
Almost all Near Eastern societies of the Bronze (3000-1200 BCE) and Axial Ages (800 to 300 BCE) were patriarchal with patriarchy established in most by 3000 BCE.&lt;ref name="Henry Sumner Maine"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Maine |first1=Henry Sumner |title=Ancient Law: Its Connection with the Early History of Society, and Its Relation With to Modern Ideas |date=2015|publisher=Palala Press|isbn= 978-1340712365|quote=Originally Published in 1874 by Henry Holt and Company, New York; Republished as Historically Significant.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|xxxii}} Eastern societies such as the [[Akkadians]], [[Hittites]], [[Assyrians]] and [[Persians]] relegated women to an inferior and subordinate position. There are very few exceptions. In the third millennium B.C. the [[Sumer|Sumerians]] accorded women a position which was almost equal to that of men, but by the second millennium, the rights and status of women were reduced.&lt;ref name="Elisabeth Meier Tetlow"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tetlow |first1=Elisabeth Meier |title=Women, Crime and Punishment in Ancient Law and Society: Volume 1: The Ancient Near East |date=2004 |publisher=Continuum |location=New York |isbn=0-8264-1629-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|42}}&lt;ref name="Samuel Noah Kramer"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Swidler |first1=Leonard |title=Women in Judaism: The Status of Women in Formative Judaism |date=1976 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |location=Metuchen, New Jersey |isbn=978-0810809048 |quote=Cites Samuel Noah Kramer and an address delivered to the Recontre Assyriologique Internationale XII Rome, July 1974 titled "The Goddesses and Theologians: Reflections on Women's Rights in Ancient Sumer}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4-5}} In the West, the status of Egyptian women was high, and their legal rights approached equality with men throughout the last three millennia B.C.&lt;ref name="Swidler"&gt;{{cite book|last=Swidler|first=Leonard|title= Women in Judaism| year=1976|publisher=Scarecrow Press| location=Metuchen, New Jersey|isbn=978-0810809048}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5-6}} A few women even ruled as pharaohs.&lt;ref name="Swidler"/&gt;{{rp|7}} However, historian [[Sarah B. Pomeroy|Sarah Pomeroy]] explains that even in those ancient patriarchal societies where a woman could occasionally become Queen, her position did not empower her female subjects.&lt;ref name="Sarah Pomeroy"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pomeroy |first1=Sarah |title=Goddesses, Whores, Wives, and Slaves: Women in Classical Antiquity |date=1995 |publisher=Schocken Books |location=New York |isbn=0-8052-1030-X |chapter=Women in the Bronze Age and Homeric Epic}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|x}}

Classics scholar Bonnie MacLachlan writes that Greece and Rome were patriarchal cultures.&lt;ref name="Bonnie MacLachlan"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bonnie MacLachlan |first1=Bonnie MacLachlan |title=Women in Ancient Greece: A Sourcebook |date=2012 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |location=New York |isbn=978-1-4411-0475-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|vi}}  

The roles women were expected to fill in all these ancient societies were predominantly domestic with a few exceptions such as Sparta, who fed women equally with men, and trained them to fight in the belief women would thereby produce stronger children. The predominant views of Ancient and Classical Greece were patriarchal; however, there is also a misogynistic strain present in Greek literature from its beginnings.&lt;ref name="Susan Moller Okin"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Okin |first1=Susan Moller |title=Women in Western Political Thought |date=1979 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, New Jersey |isbn=0-691-02191-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|15}} A polarized view of women allowed some classics authors, such as [[Thales]], [[Socrates]], [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Aristophanes]] and [[Philo]], and others, to write about women as "twice as bad as men", a "pernicious race", "never to be trusted on any account", and as an inherently inferior race of beings separate from the race of men.&lt;ref name="Blumenthal"/&gt;{{rp|41,42}}&lt;ref name="Susan Moller Okin"/&gt;{{rp|15-20}}&lt;ref name="Sarah Pomeroy"/&gt;{{rp|18}}  There was a saying in ancient Greece, at various times attributed to Thales, Socrates and Plato, in which man thanked the gods that he was not uncivilized, a slave, or a woman.&lt;ref name="Diogenes Laertius"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Laertius |first1=Diogenes |editor1-last=Miller |editor1-first=James |title=Lives of the Eminent Philosophers: by Diogenes Laertius |date=2018 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-086217-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|18}} Life for women improved after Alexander,&lt;ref name="Sarah Pomeroy"/&gt;{{rp|xi}} yet the ideology remained. Rome was heavily influenced by Greek thought.&lt;ref name="Kevin M. McGeough"&gt;{{cite book |last1=McGeough |first1=Kevin M. |title=The Romans: An Introduction |date=2004 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-537986-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|248}} Sarah Pomeroy says "never did Roman society encourage women to engage in the same activities as men of the same social class."&lt;ref name="Sarah Pomeroy"/&gt;{{rp|xv}} In ''The World of Odysseus'', classical scholar [[Moses Finley]] says: "There is no mistaking the fact that Homer fully reveals what remained true for the whole of antiquity: that women were held to be naturally inferior..."&lt;ref name="Susan Moller Okin"/&gt;{{rp|16}}

Yet as Pomeroy also states, women played a vital role in classical Greek and Roman religion, sometimes attaining a freedom in religious activities denied to them elsewhere.&lt;ref name=graeco&gt;{{cite web |title=Women in Roman Religious Life |url=https://graecomuse.wordpress.com/2012/12/25/women-in-roman-religious-life/ |website=GraecoMuse |accessdate=4 November 2018 |date=25 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Priestesses in charge of official cults such as that of [[Athena]] Polias in ancient Athens were paid well, were looked upon as role models, and wielded considerable social and political power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Women of Athena's Cult |url=https://www.ancient.eu/article/74/the-women-of-athenas-cult/%7CThe/ |website=Ancient History Encyclopedia |accessdate=4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the important [[Eleusinian Mysteries]] in ancient Greece, men, women, children and slaves were admitted and initiated into its secrets on a basis of complete equality.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, William. ''A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities'', London, 1875.&lt;/ref&gt; These rites, which were of great antiquity, lasted until the Christian Roman emperor [[Theodosius I]] had them forcibly closed in in 392 AD. In Rome, too, priestesses of state cults were able to achieve positions of status and power. Among the most important were the [[Vestal Virgin]]s, numbering at various times between four and six, charged with maintaining the sacred fire in the temple of [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]], considered crucial for Rome's prosperity and well-being. The Vestals were the only full time professional clergy in ancient Rome. They  were able to live independently from men, made ceremonial appearances at public events and could  accrue considerable wealth.&lt;ref name="4 November 2018"&gt;{{cite web |title=Vestal Virgin |url=https://www.ancient.eu/Vestal_Virgin/ |website=Ancient History Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both ancient Greece and Rome celebrated important women - only religious festivals during which women were able to socialize and build bonds with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=McClure |first1=Laura |title=Women in Classical Greek Religion |url=http://religion.oxfordre.com/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199340378.001.0001/acrefore-9780199340378-e-256 |website=oxfordre.com |accessdate=5 November 2018 |language=en |doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780199340378.001.0001/acrefore-9780199340378-e-256 |date=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Versnel |first1=H.

Archaeological excavations at [[Pompeii]] have revealed the example of Julia, a priestess in the cult of [[Isis]], who was an influential and powerful member of the community, owned and operated several businesses herself and managed her properties.&lt;ref name=graeco/&gt;

Laws in patriarchal societies regulated three sorts of sexual infractions involving women: rape, fornication (which includes adultery and prostitution), and incest.&lt;ref name="Marten Stol"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stol |first1=Marten |title=Women in the Ancient Near East |date=2016 |publisher=Walter De Gruyter |location=Boston, Massachusettes |isbn=978-1-61451-323-0|url=https://www.degruyter.com/view/product/203691?format=EBOK}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is a homogeneity to these codes across time, and across borders, which implies the aspects of life that these laws enforced were established practices within the norms and values of the populations.&lt;ref name="Henry Sumner Maine"/&gt;{{rp|48}}  The prominent use of corporal punishment, capital punishment, corporal mutilation, 'eye-for-an-eye' ''[[Eye for an eye|talion]]'' punishments, and vicarious punishments (children for their fathers) were standard across Mesopotamian Law.&lt;ref name="Elisabeth Meier Tetlow"/&gt;{{rp|72}} [[Ur-Nammu]], who founded the Sumerian Third Dynasty of Ur in southern Mesopotamia, sponsored the [[Code of Ur-Nammu|oldest surviving codes of law]] dating from approximately 2200 BCE.&lt;ref name="Elisabeth Meier Tetlow"/&gt;{{rp|10,40}}  Most other codes of law date from the second millennium BCE including the famous [[Code of Hammurabi|Babylonian Laws of Hammurabi]] which dates to about 1750 BCE.&lt;ref name="Elisabeth Meier Tetlow"/&gt;{{rp|53}}  Ancient laws favored men, protecting the procreative rights of men as a common value in all the laws pertaining to women and sex.&lt;ref name="Marten Stol"/&gt;{{rp|14}}  

In all these codes, rape is punished differently depending upon whether it occurs in the city or the country (as in Deuteronomy 22:23-27).&lt;ref name="Elisabeth Meier Tetlow"/&gt;{{rp|12}} The Hittite code also condemns a woman raped in her house presuming the man could not have entered without her permission.&lt;ref name="Charles Burney"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Burney |first1=Charles |title=Historical Dictionary of the Hittites |date=2018 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers Inc. |location=New York |isbn=978-1-53810-257-2 |edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|198,199}} Fornication is a broad term for a variety of inappropriate sexual behaviors including adultery and prostitution. In the code of Hammurabi, and in the Assyrian code, both the adulterous woman and her lover are to be bound and drowned, but forgiveness could supply a reprieve.&lt;ref name="Adultery"&gt;{{cite web |title=Adultery |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/adultery |website=Encyclopaedia Britannica |publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica, inc. |accessdate=20 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Biblical law,(Leviticus 20:10; Deuteronomy 22:22) forgiveness is not an option: the lovers must die (Deuteronomy 22:21,24). No mention is made of an adulterous man in any code. In Hammurabi, a woman can apply for a divorce but must prove her moral worthiness or be drowned for asking. It is enough in all codes for two unmarried individuals engaged in a sexual relationship to marry.  However, if a husband later accuses his wife of not having been a virgin when they married, she will be stoned to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1-last=Henry|author1-first=Madeleine M.|author2-last=James|author2-first=Sharon|chapter=Women, City, State: Theories, Ideologies, and Concepts in the Archaic and Classical Periods |editor1-last=James |editor1-first=Sharon L. |editor2-last=Dillon |editor2-first=Sheila |title=A Companion to Women in the Ancient World |date=2012 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |location=Chichester, West Sussex}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|94,104}}

Until the codes introduced in the Hebrew Bible, most codes of law allowed prostitution. Classics scholars Allison Glazebrook and Madeleine M. Henry say attitudes concerning prostitution "cut to the core of societal attitude towards gender and to social constructions of sexuality."&lt;ref name="Glazebrook and Henry"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Glazebrook |first1=Allison |last2=Henry |first2=Madeleine M. |editor1-last=Glazebrook |editor1-first=Allison |editor2-last=Henry |editor2-first=Madeleine M. |title=Greek Prostitutes in the Ancient Mediterranean, 800 BCE–200 CE |date=2011 |publisher=The University of Wisconsin Press |location=Madison, Wisconsin |isbn=978-0-299-23563-5 |chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}} Many women in a variety of ancient cultures were forced into prostitution.&lt;ref name="Marten Stol"/&gt;{{rp|413}} Many were children and adolescents. According to the 5th century BC historian [[Herodotus]], the [[sacred prostitution]] of the Babylonians was "a shameful custom" requiring every woman in the country to go to the precinct of Venus, and consort with a stranger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Asheri |first1=David |last2=Lloyd |first2=Alan |last3=Corcella |first3=Aldo |editor1-last=Murray |editor1-first=Oswyn |editor2-last=Moreno |editor2-first=Alfonso |title=A Commentary on Herodotus, Books 1-4 |date=2007 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-814956-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|211}} Some waited years for release while being used without say or pay. The initiation rituals of ''devdasi'' of pre-pubescent girls included a deflowering ceremony which gave Priests the right to have intercourse with every girl in the temple. In Greece slaves were required to work as prostitutes and had no right to decline.&lt;ref name="Glazebrook and Henry"/&gt;{{rp|3}} The Hebrew Bible code is the only of these codes that condemns prostitution.&lt;ref name="Marten Stol"/&gt;{{rp|399-418}} 

In the code of Hammurabi, as in Leviticus, incest is condemned and punishable by death, however, punishment is dependent upon whether the honor of another man has been compromised.&lt;ref name="Elisabeth Meier Tetlow"/&gt;{{rp|61}}  Genesis glosses over incest repeatedly, and in 2 Samuel and the time of King David, Tamar is still able to offer marriage to her half brother as an alternative to rape. Exodus, Leviticus and Numbers condemn all sexual relations between relatives.&lt;ref name="Marten Stol"/&gt;{{rp|268-274}}

Compared to the number of men, few women are mentioned in the Bible by name. The exact number of named and unnamed women in the Bible is somewhat uncertain because of a number of difficulties involved in calculating the total. For example, the Bible sometimes uses different names for the same woman, names in different languages can be translated differently, and some names can be used for either men or women. Professor Karla Bombach says one study produced a total of 3000-3100 names, 2900 of which are men with 170 of the total being women. However, the possibility of duplication produced the recalculation of a total of 1700 distinct personal names in the Bible with 137 of them being women.  In yet another study of the Hebrew Bible only, there were a total of 1426 names with 1315 belonging to men and 111 to women.

===Hebrew Bible views on gender===
There is substantial agreement among a wide variety of scholars that the Hebrew Bible is a predominantly patriarchal document from a patriarchal age. New Testament scholar [[Ben Witherington III]] says it "limited women's roles and functions to the home, and severely restricted: (1) their rights of inheritance, (2) their choice of relationship, (3) their ability to pursue a religious education or fully participate in synagogue, and (4) limited their freedom of movement."&lt;ref name="Scot McKnight"&gt;{{cite book|last1=McKnight| first1=Scot| title=1 Peter: The NIV application commentary|date=1996|publisher=Zondervan|location=Grand Rapids, Michigan|isbn=978-0-310-87120-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Textual scholar [[Phyllis Trible]] says "considerable evidence depicts the Bible as a document of male supremacy."&lt;ref name=Trible1973depat&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Trible|first1=Phyllis|title=Depatriarchalizing in Biblical Interpretation|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Religion|date=1973|volume=41|issue=1|pages=30–48|jstor=1461386}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Trible1984terror/&gt;  Theologian Eryl Davies writes: "From the opening chapters of the book of Genesis, where woman is created to serve as man's 'helper' (Gen.2:20-24) to the pronouncements of Paul concerning the submission of wives to their husbands and the silencing of women in communal worship (1 Cor. 14:34; Col.3:18), the primary emphasis of the Bible is on women's subordinate status."&lt;ref name = "Davies1"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Davies |first1=Eryl W. |title=The Dissenting Reader Feminist Approaches to the Hebrew B ible |date=2003 |publisher=Ashgate Publishing |location=Burlington, Vermont |isbn=0-7546-0372-5 |page=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Davies says the patriarchal ethos is reflected in texts ranging from legal texts to narratives, and from the prophetic sayings to the wisdom literature.&lt;ref name = "Davies1"/&gt;{{rp|1}}

Other scholars, such as Hebrew Bible scholar [[Tikva Frymer-Kensky]], say there are evidences of "gender blindness" in the Hebrew Bible.&lt;ref name=Frymer-Kensky2006&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frymer-Kensky|first1=Tikva|title=Studies in Bible and feminist criticism|date=2006|publisher=Jewish Publication Society|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=9780827607989|edition= 1st|oclc=62127975}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|166–167}}  Frymer-Kensky says the role of women is generally one that is subordinate to men, and the Hebrew Bible does not portray Israel as less patriarchal in practice than the cultures which surrounded it, however, unlike other ancient literature, the Hebrew Bible does not explain or justify cultural subordination by portraying women as deserving of less because of their "naturally evil" natures.  The Biblical depiction of early Bronze Age culture up through the Axial Age, depicts the "essence" of women, (that is the Bible's metaphysical view of being and nature), of both male and female as "created in the image of God" with neither one inherently inferior in nature.&lt;ref name="Blumenthal"/&gt;{{rp|41,42}} Discussions of the nature of women are conspicuously absent from the Hebrew Bible.&lt;ref name="Tykva Frymer-Kensky"&gt;{{cite book|last=Frymer-Kensky |first=Tykva | title=Reading the Women of the Bible: A New Interpretation of Their Stories|publisher=Schocken Books|location =New York|year=2012| isbn=0-8052-1182-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biblical narratives do not show women as having different goals, desires, or strategies or as using methods that vary from those used by men not in authority.&lt;ref name="Tykva Frymer-Kensky"/&gt;{{rp|xv}} Judaic studies scholar [[David R.

Theologians [[Evelyn Stagg]] and [[Frank Stagg (theologian)|Frank Stagg]] say the [[Decalogue|Ten Commandments]] of [[Exodus 20]] contain aspects of both male priority and gender balance.&lt;ref name="Evelyn and Frank Stagg"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stagg|first1=Evelyn|last2=Stagg|first2=Frank|title=Woman in the World of Jesus|date=1978|publisher=The Westminster Press|location=Philadelphia}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|21}} In the tenth commandment against coveting, a wife is depicted in the examples not to be coveted: house, ''wife,'' male or female slave, ox or donkey, or 'anything that belongs to your neighbour.' On the other hand, the fifth commandment to honor parents does not make any distinction in the honor to be shown between one parent and another.&lt;ref name="Ben Witherington III1984"/&gt;{{rp|11,12}} 

The Hebrew Bible often portrays women as victors, leaders and heroines with qualities Israel should emulate. Women such as [[Hagar]], [[Tamar (Genesis)|Tamar]], [[Miriam]], [[Rahab]], [[Deborah]], [[Esther]], and [[Jael|Yael/Jael]], are among many female "saviors" of Israel. Tykva Frymer-Kensky says "victor stories follow the paradigm of Israel's central sacred story: the lowly are raised, the marginal come to the center, the poor boy makes good."&lt;ref name=Frymer-Kensky2006/&gt;{{rp|333–337}} She goes on to say these women conquered the enemy "by their wits and daring, were symbolic representations of their people, and pointed to the salvation of Israel."&lt;ref name=Frymer-Kensky2006/&gt;{{rp|333–337}}  The Hebrew Bible portrays women as victims as well as victors.&lt;ref name=Frymer-Kensky2006/&gt;{{rp|166–167}} For example, in [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 31, the Israelites [[Midian war|slay the people of Midian]], except for 32,000 virgin women who are kept as spoils of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9sPJnd0cwV0C&amp;q=midian#v=snippet&amp;q=midian&amp;f=false|title=Why Not Kill Them All?: The Logic and Prevention of Mass Political Murder|first1=Daniel|last1=Chirot|first2=Clark|last2=McCauley|page=27|date=1 July 2010|publisher=Princeton University Press|via=Google Books|isbn=978-1400834853}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.biblica.com/bible/?osis=niv:Numbers.31%E2%80%9331|title=Numbers 31 NIV - Biblica|website=www.biblica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Frymer-Kensky says the Bible author uses vulnerable women symbolically "as images of an Israel that is also small and vulnerable..."&lt;ref name=Frymer-Kensky2006/&gt;{{rp|333–337}} She adds "This is not misogynist story-telling but something far more complex in which the treatment of women becomes the clue to the morality of the social order."&lt;ref name=Frymer-Kensky2006/&gt;{{rp|174}} Professor of Religion J.

Women did have some role in ritual life as represented in the Bible, though they could not be priests. Neither could just any man, only [[Levites]] could be priests. Women (as well as men) were required to make a pilgrimage to the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] once a year (men each of the three main festivals if they could) and offer the [[Passover]] [[korban|sacrifice]].&lt;ref name="Lim 2005 41"&gt;{{cite book |title= The Dead Sea Scrolls: A Very Short Introduction|edition=  |last= Lim|first= Timothy H.|year= 2005|publisher= Oxford University Press |location= Oxford|isbn=9780191517532|oclc=929408500}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|41}}  They would also do so on special occasions in their lives such as giving a ''[[todah]]'' ("thanksgiving") offering after childbirth. Hence, they participated in many of the major public religious roles that non-Levitical men could, albeit less often and on a somewhat smaller and generally more discreet scale.&lt;ref name="HauptmanEtz"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hauptman |first1=Judith |editor1-last=Blumenthal, |editor1-first=Jacob |editor2-last=Liss |editor2-first=Janet L. |title=Etz Hayim Study Companion |date=2005 |publisher=The Jewish Publications Society |location=New York |isbn=978-0-82760-822-1 |chapter=Women}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|167-169}}   Old Testament scholar [[Christine Roy Yoder]] says that in the [[Book of Proverbs]], the divine attribute of [[Holy Wisdom]] is presented as female.

===Sex, marriage and family===
Talmudic scholar [[Judith Hauptman]] says marriage and family law in the Bible favored men over women. For example, a husband could divorce a wife if he chose to, but a wife could not divorce a husband without his consent. The law said a woman could not make a binding vow without consent of her male authority, so she could not legally marry without male approval.  The practice of [[levirate marriage]] applied to widows of childless deceased husbands, not to widowers of childless deceased wives; though, if either he or she didn't consent to the marriage, a different ceremony called ''[[chalitza]]'' was done instead; this involves the widow removing her brother-in-law's shoe, spitting in front of him, and proclaiming, "This is what happens to someone who will not build his brother's house!".&lt;ref name="HauptmanEtz"/&gt;{{rp|163}} Laws concerning the loss of female virginity have no male equivalent. Women in biblical times depended on men economically. Women generally did not own property except in the rare case of inheriting land from a father who didn't bear sons. Even "in such cases, women would be required to remarry within the tribe so as not to reduce its land holdings."&lt;ref name="HauptmanEtz"/&gt;{{rp|171}} Property was transferred through the male line and women could not inherit unless there were no male heirs (Numbers 27:1-11; 36:1-12).&lt;ref name = "Davies1"/&gt;{{rp|3}} These and other gender-based differences found in the Torah suggest that women were seen as subordinate to men; however, they also suggest that biblical society viewed continuity, property, and family unity as paramount.&lt;ref name="HauptmanEtz" /&gt; 

Philosopher Michael Berger says, the rural family was the backbone of biblical society. Women did tasks as important as those of men, managed their households, and were equals in daily life, but all public decisions were made by men. Men had specific obligations they were required to perform for their wives including the provision of clothing, food, and sexual relations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Telushkin|Telushkin, Joseph]]. ''Biblical Literacy: The Most Important People, Events, and Ideas of the Hebrew Bible''. New York: William Morrow and Company, 1997. p. 403.&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Israel was a frontier and life was "tough." Everyone was a "small holder" and had to work hard to survive. A large percentage of children died early, and those that survived, learned to share the burdens and responsibilities of family life as they grew.  The marginal environment required a strict authority structure: parents had to not just be honored but not be challenged.  Ungovernable children, especially adult children, had to be kept in line or eliminated. Respect for the dead was obligatory, and sexual lines were rigidly drawn. Virginity was expected, adultery the worst of crimes, and even suspicion of adultery led to trial by ordeal.&lt;ref name="Berger"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Berger |first1=Michael S. |editor1-last=Broyde |editor1-first=Michael J. |editor2-last=Ausubel |editor2-first=Michael |title=Marriage, Sex, and Family in Judaism |date=2005 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers Inc. |location=New York |isbn=0-7425-4516-4 |chapter=Marriage, Sex and Family in the Jewish Tradition: A Historical Overview}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1,2}} Adultery was defined differently for men than for women: a woman was an adulteress if she had sexual relations outside her marriage, but if a man had sexual relations outside his marriage with an unmarried woman, a concubine or a prostitute, it was not considered adultery on his part.&lt;ref name = "Davies1"/&gt;{{rp|3}} A woman was considered "owned by a master."&lt;ref name="Blumenthal"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Blumenthal |first1=David R. |editor1-last=Broyde |editor1-first=Michael J. |editor2-last=Ausubel |editor2-first=Michael |title=Marriage, Sex and Family in Judaism |date=2005 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers Inc. |location=New York |isbn=0-7425-4516-4 |chapter=The Images of Women in the Hebrew Bible}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|20,21}}  A woman was always under the authority of a man: her father, her brothers, her husband, and since she did not inherit, eventually her eldest son.&lt;ref name="Berger"/&gt;{{rp|1,2}} She was subject to strict purity laws, both ritual and moral, and non-conforming sex—homosexuality, bestiality, cross dressing and masturbation—was punished. Stringent protection of the marital bond and loyalty to kin was very strong.&lt;ref name="Berger"/&gt;{{rp|20}}

The ''[[zonah]]'' of the Hebrew Bible is a woman who is not under the authority of a man; she may be a paid prostitute, but not necessarily. In the Bible, for a woman or girl who was under the protection of a man to be called a "''zonah''" was a grave insult to her and her family. The ''zonah'' is shown as lacking protection, making each ''zonah'' vulnerable and available to other men; the lack of a specific man governing her meant that she was free to act in ways that other women weren't. According to David Blumenthal, the Bible depicts the ''zonah'' as "dangerous, fearsome and threatening by her freedom, and yet appealing and attractive at the same time."&lt;ref name="Blumenthal"/&gt;{{rp|42}}  Her freedom is recognized by biblical law and her sexual activity is not punishable.&lt;ref name="Blumenthal"/&gt;{{rp|42}} She is the source of extra-institutional sex. Therefore she is seen as a threat to patriarchy and the family structure it supports.&lt;ref name="Blumenthal"/&gt;{{rp|43}} Over time, the term "''zonah''" came to applied to a married woman who committed adultery, and that sense of the term was used as a metaphor for people being unfaithful to Yahweh, especially in the [[Book of Hosea]] and the [[Book of Ezekiel]]; the descriptions of sexual acts and punishments of the metaphorical ''zonah'' in those books are brutal and pornographic.&lt;ref name="Blumenthal"/&gt;{{rp|43}}

====Hagar and Sarah====

[[File:Holman Hagar and Ishmael cast out.jpg|thumb|left|upright=.8|[[Hagar]] and [[Ishmael]] cast out, 1890 illustration]]

Sarah had borne no children though God had promised them a child. Later in the story when Sarah hears the promise of God she does not believe it. "Abraham and Sarah were already very old, and Sarah was past the age of childbearing. So Sarah laughed to herself as she thought, “After I am worn out and my lord is old, will I now have this pleasure?” (Genesis 18:10-15). Sarah gives her slave Hagar to Abraham and he has sexual relations with her and she becomes pregnant. Sarah hopes to build a family through Hagar, but Hagar "began to despise her mistress" (Genesis 16:4). Then Sarah mistreated Hagar, and she fled. God spoke to the slave Hagar in the desert, sent her home, and she bore Abraham a son, [[Ishmael]], "a wild donkey of a man" (Genesis 16:12). 

When Ishmael was 13, Abraham received the covenant practice of circumcision, and circumcised every male of his household. Later "Sarah became pregnant and bore a son to Abraham in his old age, at the very time God had promised him. Abraham gave the name Isaac to the son Sarah bore him. When his son Isaac was eight days old, Abraham circumcised him, as God had commanded him. Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him" (Genesis 21:1-5). Hagar and Ishmael are sent away again and this time they do not return. 

Frymer-Kensky says "This story starkly illuminates the relations between women in a patriarchy." She adds that it demonstrates the problems associated with gender intersecting with the disadvantages of class: Sarah has the power, her actions are legal not compassionate, but her motives are clear: "she [Sarah] is vulnerable, making her incapable of compassion toward her social inferior."&lt;ref name="Frymer-Kensky2002"/&gt;{{rp|98}}

The book of Joshua tells the story of Rahab the prostitute (zonah), a resident of Jericho, who houses two spies sent by [[Joshua]] to prepare for an [[Battle of Jericho|attack on the city]]. The king of Jericho knew the spies were there and sent soldiers to her house to capture them, but she hid them, sent the soldiers off in misdirection, and lied to the King on their behalf.  She said to the spies, "I know that the Lord has given you this land and that a great fear of you has fallen on us, so that all who live in this country are melting in fear because of you. We have heard how the Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea for you when you came out of Egypt, and what you did to Sihon and Og, the two kings of the Amorites east of the Jordan, whom you completely destroyed. When we heard of it, our hearts melted in fear and everyone’s courage failed because of you, for the Lord your God is God in heaven above and on the earth below.  Now then, please swear to me by the Lord that you will show kindness to my family, because I have shown kindness to you. Give me a sure sign that you will spare the lives of my father and mother, my brothers and sisters, and all who belong to them—and that you will save us from death.” (Joshua 2:9-13) She was told to tie a scarlet cord in the same window through which she helped the spies escape, and to have all her family in the house with her and not to go into the streets, and if she did not comply, their blood would be on their own heads. She did comply, and she and her whole family were saved before the city was captured and burned (Joshua 6).

====Delilah====
{{Main|Delilah}}
[[File:Samson and Delilah film still.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Still photo from ''[[Samson and Delilah (1949 film)|Samson and Delilah]]'' (1949)]]
Judges chapters 13 to 16 tell the story of [[Samson]] who meets Delilah and his end in chapter 16. Samson was a [[Nazarite]], a specially dedicated individual, from birth, yet his story indicates he violated every requirement of the Nazarite vow.{{cn|date=October 2018}} Long hair was one of the symbolic representations of his special relationship with God; no razor was supposed to touch his hair. Samson travels to Gaza and "fell in love with a woman in the Valley of Sorek whose name was Delilah. The rulers of the Philistines went to her and said, “See if you can lure him into showing you the secret of his great strength and how we can overpower him so we may tie him up and subdue him. Each one of us will give you eleven hundred shekels of silver.” Samson lies to her a couple of times then tells her the truth. "Then the Philistines seized him, gouged out his eyes and took him down to Gaza. Binding him with bronze shackles, they set him to grinding grain in the prison. But the hair on his head began to grow again after it had been shaved." 

"Now the rulers of the Philistines assembled to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god and to celebrate, saying, “Our god has delivered Samson, our enemy, into our hands.” And they brought Samson out to entertain each other. But Samson prayed, "O Lord, remember me" and he pushed the columns holding up the Temple and killed everyone there.

The story does not call Delilah a Philistine. The valley of Sorek was Danite territory that had been overrun by Philistines, so the population there would have been mixed. Delilah was likely an Israelite or the story would have said otherwise.  The Philistines offered Delilah an enormous sum of money to betray Samson. Art has generally portrayed Delilah as a type of femme fatale, but the biblical term used (pattî) means to persuade with words. Delilah uses emotional blackmail and Samson's genuine love for her to betray him. No other Hebrew biblical hero is ever defeated by an Israelite woman. Samson does not suspect, perhaps because he cannot think of a woman as dangerous, but Delilah is determined, bold and very dangerous indeed. The entire Philistine army could not bring him down. Yet Delilah did.&lt;ref name="Tykva Frymer-Kensky"/&gt;{{rp|79-85}}

====The Levite's concubine====

[[File:The Levite finds his concubine lying on the doorstep, James Tissot.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|The Levite finds his concubine lying on the doorstep, [[James Tissot]], 19th century]]
The Levite's concubine in the book of Judges is "vulnerable as she is only a minor wife, a concubine".&lt;ref name=Frymer-Kensky2006/&gt;{{rp|173}} She is one of the [[List of names for the biblical nameless|biblical nameless]].  Frymer-Kensky says this story is also an example of class intersecting with gender and power: when she is unhappy she runs home, only to have her father give her to another, the Levite.  The Levite and his concubine travel to a strange town where they are vulnerable because they travel alone without extended family to rescue them; strangers attack. To protect the Levite, his host offers his daughter to the mob and the Levite sends out his concubine.  Trible says "The story makes us realize that in those days men had ultimate powers of disposal over their women."&lt;ref name=Trible1984terror/&gt;{{rp|65–89}} Frymer-Kensky says the scene is similar to one in the [[Sodom and Gomorrah]] story when [[Lot (biblical person)|Lot]] sent [[Lot's daughters|his daughters]] to the mob, but in Genesis the angels save them, and in the book of Judges God is no longer intervening.  The concubine is raped to death.&lt;ref name=Frymer-Kensky2006/&gt;{{rp|173}}

The Levite butchers her body and uses it to rouse Israel against the [[tribe of Benjamin]].  Civil war follows nearly wiping out an entire tribe.

Fryman-Kensky says, "Horror follows horror."&lt;ref name=Frymer-Kensky2006/&gt; The narrator caps off the story with "in those days there was no king in Israel and every man did as he pleased."

====Tamar, daughter-in-Law of Judah====
{{Main|Tamar (Genesis)}}
[[File:Figures Judah Gives his Signet, Bracelets and Staff in Pledge to Tamar.jpg|thumb|left|upright=.8|Judah Gives his Pledge to Tamar, 16th century illustration]]
In the Book of Genesis, Tamar is [[Judah (son of Jacob)|Judah]]'s daughter–in–law. She was married to Judah's son [[Er (biblical person)|Er]], but Er died, leaving Tamar childless. Under levirate law, Judah's next son, [[Onan]], was told to have sex with Tamar and give her a child, but when Onan slept with her, he "spilled his seed on the ground" rather than give her a child that would belong to his brother. Then Onan died too. "Judah then said to his daughter-in-law Tamar, 'Live as a widow in your father’s household until my son Shelah grows up.' For he thought, 'He may die too, just like his brothers'." (Genesis 38:11) But when Shelah grew up, she was not given to him as his wife. One day Judah travels to town (Timnah) to shear his sheep. Tamar "took off her widow’s clothes, covered herself with a veil to disguise herself, and then sat down at the entrance to Enaim, which is on the road to Timnah.  When Judah saw her, he thought she was a prostitute, for she had covered her face. Not realizing that she was his daughter-in-law, he went over to her by the roadside and said, 'Come now, let me sleep with you'."(Genesis 38:14) He said he would give her something in return and she asked for a pledge, accepting his staff and his seal with its cord as earnest of later payment. So Judah slept with her and she became pregnant. Then she went home and put on her widow's weeds again. Months later when it was discovered she was pregnant, she was accused of prostitution (zonah), and was set to be burned.  Instead, she sent Judah's pledge offerings to him saying "I am pregnant by the man who owns these." Judah recognized them and said, “She is more righteous than I, since I wouldn’t give her to my son Shelah.”

====Jephthah's daughter====
{{Main|Jephthah's daughter}}
[[File:Alexandre Cabanel - The Daughter of Jephthah (1879, Oil on canvas).JPG|thumb|upright|''The Daughter of Jephthah'', by [[Alexandre Cabanel]] (1879).]]
The story of [[Jephthah]]'s daughter in Book of Judges begins as an archetypal biblical hagiography of a hero. Jephthah is the son of a marginal woman, a prostitute (zonah), and as such he is vulnerable.  He lives in his father's house, but when his father dies, his half-brothers reject him. According to Frymer-Kensky, "This is not right.  In the ancient Near East prostitutes could be hired as surrogate wombs as well as sex objects. Laws and contracts regulated the relationship between the child of such a prostitute and children of the first wife... he could not be disinherited. Jephthah has been wronged, but he has no recourse. He must leave home."  Frymer-Kensky says the author assumes the biblical audience is familiar with this, will know Jephthah has been wronged, and will be sympathetic to him.&lt;ref name=Frymer-Kensky2002&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frymer-Kensky|first1=Tikva|title=Reading the Women of the Bible: A New Interpretation of Their Stories|date=2002|publisher=Schoken Books|location=New York|isbn=9780805211825|oclc=49823086}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|102–115}}

Nevertheless, Jephthah goes out into the world and makes a name for himself as a mighty warrior—a hero of Israel. The threat of [[Ammon#Biblical narrative|the Ammonites]] is grave. The brothers acknowledge their wrongdoing to gain his protection.  Frymer-Kensky says Jephthah's response reveals negotiation skills and deep piety. Then he attempts to negotiate peace with Ammon but fails.  War comes, with all of Israel vulnerable.  Before the battle he makes a battle vow: "If you give the Ammonites into my hand...the one who comes out of the doors of my house...I will offer to YHWH."  This turns out to be his daughter. Jephthah's reaction expresses his horror and sense of tragedy in three key expressions of mourning, utter defeat, and reproach. He reproaches her and himself, but foresees only his doom in either keeping or breaking his vow. Jephthah's daughter responds to his speech and she becomes a true heroine of this story. They are both good, yet tragedy happens.  Frymer-Kensky summarizes: "The vulnerable heroine is sacrificed, the hero's name is gone."&lt;ref name=Frymer-Kensky2002/&gt;  She adds, the author of the book of Judges knew people were sacrificing their children and the narrator of Judges is in opposition. "The horror is the very reason this story is in the book of Judges."&lt;ref name=Frymer-Kensky2002/&gt;{{rp|115}}

Some scholars have interpreted this story to mean that Jephthah's daughter was not actually sacrificed, but kept in seclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hirsch|first1=Emil G.|last2=Seligsohn|first2=M. |last3=Schechter|first3=Solomon|last4=Barton|first4=George A.|editor1-last=Cyrus Adler|editor1-first=et al|title=Jewish Encyclopedia|date=1906|chapter-url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/8584-jephthah|chapter=Jephthah (יפתח)|location=New York|publisher=Funk &amp; Wagnalls Co}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stewart|first1=Anne E|editor1-last=Newsom|editor1-first=Carol A.|editor2-last=Ringe|editor2-first=Sharon H.|editor3-last=Lapsley|editor3-first=Jacqueline E.|title=Women's Bible commentary|date=2012|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|location=Louisville, Ky|isbn=9780664237073|pages=133–137|edition= 3rd, 20th anniversary|chapter=Jephthah's Daughter and her Interpreters|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9uUMZ_g2_NoC&amp;pg=PA136}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|137}}

====Tamar, daughter of David====
{{Main|Tamar (daughter of David)}}
[[File:Desolation of Tamar by J.Tissot.jpg|thumb|left|upright .8|Desolation of Tamar by J.Tissot, c. 1900]]
The story of Tamar is a literary unit consisting of seven parts. According to Frymer-Kensky, the story "has received a great deal of attention as a superb piece of literature, and several have concentrated on explicating the artistry involved."&lt;ref name=Frymer-Kensky2002/&gt;{{rp|399}} This story (2 Samuel) focuses on three of King [[David]]'s children, [[Amnon]] the first born, [[Absalom]] the beloved son, and his beautiful sister Tamar.&lt;ref name=Trible1984terror/&gt;{{rp|38}}

Amnon desires Tamar deeply. Immediately after explaining Amnon's desire the narrator first uses the term sister to reveal Tamar is not only Absalom's sister but is also Amnon's sister by another mother.  Phyllis Trible says the storyteller "stresses family ties for such intimacy exacerbates the coming tragedy."  Full of lust, the prince is impotent to act; Tamar is a virgin and protected property. Then comes a plan from his cousin [[Jonadab]], "a very crafty man."&lt;ref name=Trible1984terror/&gt;{{rp|39}}

Jonadab's scheme to aid Amnon pivots on David the king. Amnon pretends to be sick and David comes to see him.&lt;ref name=Trible1984terror/&gt;{{rp|43}} He asks that his sister Tamar make him food and feed him. The king orders it sending a message to Tamar.&lt;ref name=Trible1984terror/&gt;{{rp|44}}  Amnon sends the servants away. Alone with her brother she is vulnerable, but Tamar claims her voice. Frymer-Kensky says Tamar speaks to Amnon with wisdom, but she speaks to a foolish man. She attempts to dissuade him, then offers the alternative of marriage, and tells him to appeal to the king. He does not listen, and rapes her.&lt;ref name=Trible1984terror/&gt;{{rp|45}}

Amnon is immediately full of shame and angrily throws Tamar out. “No!” she said to him. “Sending me away would be a greater wrong than what you have already done to me.” But he refuses to listen. Tamar is desolate: ruined and miserable. King David is furious but he does nothing to avenge his daughter or punish his son. Frymer Kensky says "The reader of the story who expects that the state will provide protection for the vulnerable now sees that the state cannot control itself."&lt;ref name=Frymer-Kensky2006/&gt;{{rp|174}} Absalom is filled with hatred, and kills Amnon two years later. Absalom then rebels against his father and is also killed.&lt;ref name=Trible1984terror/&gt;{{rp|48}}

====Bathsheba====
{{Main|Bathsheba}}
In the Book of Samuel, Bathsheba is a married woman who is noticed by king David. He has her brought to him, and she becomes pregnant. The text in the Bible does not explicitly state whether Bathsheba consented to sex.&lt;ref name=Campbell2005&gt;{{cite book|author=Antony F.

===Other women in the Hebrew Bible===
====Eve====
{{Main|Eve}}
[[File:Orvieto060.jpg|thumb|Creation of Eve, marble relief by [[Lorenzo Maitani]], [[Orvieto Cathedral]], Italy, c. 1300]]
The story of Eve begins in Genesis 2:18 when "The Lord God said, 'It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him'... Then the Lord God made a woman from the rib he had taken out of the man, and he brought her to the man... That is why a man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife, and they become one flesh.  Adam and his wife were both naked, and they felt no shame.” (Genesis 2:18-25) Eve is deceived, tempted and indulges, then shares with her husband who apparently neither questions nor argues. Their eyes are opened and they realize they are naked, and they make coverings from fig leaves. When God comes to the garden, they hide, and God knows something is wrong. Both attempts to shift the blame, but they end up bearing the responsibility, each receiving their own curses, and getting thrown out of the garden together. (Genesis 2) 

According to Near Eastern scholar [[Carol Meyers]], "Perhaps more than any other part of the Bible, [the story of Eve] has influenced western notions of gender and identity."&lt;ref name="Carol Meyers"/&gt;{{rp|72}} Sociologist Linda L. Lindsey says "women have born a greater burden for 'original sin'... Eve's creation from Adam's rib, second in order, with God's "curse" at the expulsion is a stubbornly persistent frame used to justify male supremacy."&lt;ref name="Linda L. Lindsey"/&gt;{{rp|133,397}}  Trible and Frymer-Kensky find the story of Eve in Genesis implies no inferiority of Eve to Adam; the word ''helpmate'' (''ezer'') connotes a mentor in the Bible rather than an assistant and is used frequently for the relation of God to Israel (not Israel to God).&lt;ref name=Trible1984terror/&gt; &lt;ref name=Frymer-Kensky2006/&gt;{{rp|168}} Trible points out that, in mythology, the last-created thing is traditionally the culmination of creation, which is implied in Genesis 1 where man is created after everything else—except Eve.&lt;ref name=Trible1984terror/&gt;  However, New Testament scholar [[Craig Blomberg]] says ancient Jews might have seen the order of creation in terms of the laws of primogeniture (both in their scriptures and in surrounding cultures) and interpreted Adam being created first as a sign of privilege.&lt;ref name=Blomberg&gt;{{cite book|author1=Craig L. Blomberg|chapter=Chapter 2: Women in Ministry: a complementarian perspective|editor1-last=Beck|editor1-first=James R., et al|title=Two views on women in ministry|date=2009|publisher=Zondervan|location=Grand Rapids, Michigan|isbn=9780310254379|oclc=779330381}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|129}}

====Deborah and Jael====
[[File:Tissot Jael Smote Sisera, and Slew Him.jpg|thumb|left|Jael smiting Sisera, Tissot, c. 1900]]
{{Main|Deborah|Jael}}
The [[Book of Judges]] tells the story of [[Deborah]], as a [[prophet]] (Judges 4:4), a judge of [[Israelites|Israel]] (Judges 4:4-5), the wife of [[Lapidoth]] and a mother (Judges 5:7). She was based in the region between [[Ramah in Benjamin]] and [[Bethel]] in the land of [[Tribe of Ephraim|Ephraim]].&lt;ref name=je&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hirsch|first1=Emil G.|last2=Levi|first2=Gerson B.|last3=Schechter|first3=Solomon|last4=Kohler|first4=Kaufmann|editor1-last=Cyrus Adler|editor1-first=et al|title=Jewish Encyclopedia|date=1906|chapter-url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/5027-deborah|chapter=Deborah|location=New York|publisher=Funk &amp; Wagnalls Co}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Deborah could also be described as a warrior, leader of war, and a leader of faith. (Judges 4:6-22). 

The narrative describes the people of Israel as having been oppressed by [[Jabin]], the king of [[Canaan]], for twenty years. Deborah sends a prophetic message to [[Barak]] to raise an army and fight them, but Barak refuses to do so without her. Deborah declares his refusal means the glory of the victory will belong to a woman.&lt;ref name=je/&gt;  A battle is fought (led by Barak), and [[Sisera]], the enemy commander, is defeated.&lt;ref name=je/&gt;

Sisera had summoned all his men and 900 iron chariots, but he was routed and fled on foot. "Barak pursued the chariots and army as far as [[Harosheth Haggoyim]], and all Sisera’s troops fell by the sword; not a man was left. Sisera, meanwhile, fled on foot to the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, because there was an alliance between Jabin king of Hazor and the family of Heber the Kenite."  Jael gave him drink, covered him with a blanket, and when, exhausted from battle, Sisera slept, Jael picked up a tent peg and a hammer and drove the peg into his temple all the way into the ground and he died.

====The Witch of Endor====
{{Main|Witch of Endor}}
[[File:Witch of Endor by Elsheimer.jpg|thumb|left||''Witch of Endor'' by [[Adam Elsheimer]]]]

The Witch of [[Endor (village)|Endor]] is a woman who summons the [[prophet]] [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]]'s spirit, at the demand of King [[Saul the King|Saul]] of the [[Kingdom of Israel (united kingdom)|Kingdom of Israel]] in the 28th chapter of the [[Books of Samuel|''First Book of Samuel'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse-nb|1|Samuel|28:3–25|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saul, the current King of Israel, seeks wisdom from God in choosing a course of action against the assembled forces of the [[Philistines]]. He receives no answer from [[dream]]s, prophets, or the [[Urim and Thummim]]. Having driven out all [[necromancer]]s and [[Magician (paranormal)|magicians]] from Israel, Saul searches for a witch anonymously and in disguise. His search leads him to a woman of Endor, who claims that she can see the ghost of the deceased prophet Samuel rising from the abode of the dead.&lt;ref&gt;[[Geza Vermes]] (2008)'' The Resurrection''. London, Penguin: 25–6&lt;/ref&gt;

The voice of the prophet's ghost at first frightens the witch of Endor, and after complaining of being disturbed, berates Saul for disobeying God, and predicts Saul's downfall. The spirit reiterates a pre-mortem prophecy by Samuel, adding that Saul will perish with his whole army in battle the next day. Saul is terrified.  The next day, his army is defeated as prophesied, and Saul commits suicide.

Although Saul is depicted as an enemy to witches and [[Divination|diviners]], the Witch of Endor comforts Saul when she sees his distress and insists on feeding him before he leaves.

====Jezebel====
{{Main|Jezebel}}
[[File:The Death of Jezebel.jpg|thumb|alt= Engraving of Jezebel being thrown out of a window to waiting mounted troops and dogs|''The Death of Jezebel'', by [[Gustave Doré]]]]
Jezebel is described in the [[Books of Kings|Book of Kings]] (1 Kings 16:31) as a queen who was the daughter of [[Ithobaal I]] of [[Sidon]] and the wife of [[Ahab]], [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|King of Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Knowles, [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O214-Jezebel.html "Jezebel"], ''The Oxford Dictionary of Phrase and Fable'', OUP 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Books of Kings, Jezebel incited her husband King Ahab to abandon the worship of [[Yahweh]] and encourage worship of the deities [[Baal]] and [[Asherah]] instead. Jezebel persecuted the prophets of Yahweh, and fabricated evidence of [[blasphemy]] against an innocent [[Naboth|landowner]] who refused to sell his property to King Ahab, causing the landowner to be put to death. For these transgressions against the God and people of Israel, Jezebel met a gruesome death—[[defenestration|thrown out of a window]] by members of her own court retinue, and the flesh of her corpse eaten by [[stray dogs]].

In the biblical story, Jezebel became associated with [[false prophet]]s. In some interpretations, her dressing in finery and putting on makeup&lt;ref name="Bibleverse||2 Kings|9:30|kjv"&gt;{{Bibleverse||2 Kings|9:30|kjv|}}&lt;/ref&gt; led to the association of the use of [[cosmetics]] with "painted women" or prostitutes.

====Athaliah====
{{Main|Athaliah}}
[[File:Athaliah1.jpg|thumb|left|''The Death of Athaliah'' by [[Gustave Doré]]]]

Athaliah was the daughter of Jezebel and King Ahab. Her story is told in [[Books of Kings|2 Kings]] 8:16 – 11:16 and [[Books of Chronicles|2 Chronicles]] 22:10-23:15. According to these passages, Athaliah married [[Jehoram of Judah|Jehoram]], King of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]]. After her husband died, Athaliah's son [[Ahaziah of Judah|Ahaziah]] came to the throne of Judah, but he reigned for only a year before being killed. When he died, Athaliah usurped the throne and ruled as Queen of Judah for six years. In an attempt to consolidate her position, she ordered all the royal house of Judah to be put to death, but unbeknownst to her, [[Jehosheba]], Ahaziah's sister, managed to rescue from the purge one of Athaliah's grandsons with Jehoram of Judah, named [[Jehoash of Judah|Jehoash]], who was only one year old. Jehoash was raised in secret by Jehosheba's husband, a priest named [[Jehoiada]].

After six years of raising the boy in secret, Jehoiada revealed his existence and had him proclaimed King. Athaliah denounced this as treason, but a successful revolt was organised in his favour and Athaliah was put to death at the entrance of her palace.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Kings|11:14-16|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|23:12-15|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Athaliah {{!}} queen of Judah |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Athaliah |website=Encyclopedia Britannica |accessdate=11 November 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Shunammite woman====
{{Main|Woman of Shunem}}
[[File:Eeckhout Elisha and the Shunammite woman.jpg|thumb|220px|''Elisha and the Shunammite woman''. [[Gerbrand van den Eeckhout]], 1649.]]
2 Kings 4 tells of a woman in [[Shunem]] who treated the prophet [[Elisha]] with respect, feeding him and providing a place for him to stay whenever he traveled through town.  One day Elisha asked his servant what could be done for her and the servant said, she has no son. So Elisha called her and said, this time next year she would have a son.  She does, the boy grows, and then one day he dies. She placed the child's body on Elisha's bed and went to find him. "When she reached the man of God at the mountain, she took hold of his feet. Gehazi came over to push her away, but the man of God said, 'Leave her alone! She is in bitter distress, but the Lord has hidden it from me and has not told me why.' 'Did I ask you for a son, my lord?' she said. 'Didn’t I tell you, ‘Don’t raise my hopes’?”  And she refuses to leave Elisha who goes and heals the boy. 

Biblical scholar Burke Long says the [[Woman of Shunem|"great woman" of Shunnem]] who appears in the Book of Kings acknowledges and respects the prophet Elisha's position yet is also a "determined mover and shaper of events."&lt;ref name="Burke Long"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Long|first1=Burke O.|title=The Shunammite Woman|url=https://members.bib-arch.org/bible-review/7/1/7|website=The BAS Library|publisher=Biblical Archaeology Society Online Archive|access-date=29 April 2018|ref=Bible Review 7:1, February 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Frymer-Kensky, this narrative demonstrates how gender intersects with class in the Bible's portrayal of ancient Israel. The Shunammite's story takes place among the rural poor, and against this "backdrop of extreme poverty, the Shunammite is wealthy, giving her more boldness than poor women or sometimes even poor men."&lt;ref name=Frymer-Kensky2006/&gt;{{rp|164}} She is well enough off she is able to extend a kind of patronage to Elisha, and is independent enough she is willing to confront the prophet and King in pursuit of the well being of her household.&lt;ref name=Frymer-Kensky2006/&gt;{{rp|164}}

====Huldah====
{{Main|Huldah}}
2 Kings 22 shows it was not unusual for women to be prophetesses in ancient Israel even if they could not be priests.&lt;ref name=Frymer-Kensky2006/&gt;{{rp|167}} [[Josiah]] the King was having the Temple repaired when the High Priest [[Hilkiah]] found the Book of the Law which had been lost. He gave it to [[Shaphan]], the king's scribe, who read it, then gave it to King Josiah.  The king tore his robes in distress and said "Go and inquire of the Lord for me ..."  So they went to the prophet [[Huldah]], the wife of Shallum. The text does not comment on the fact this prophet was a woman, but says only that they took her answer back to the king (verse 20) thereby demonstrating there was nothing unusual in a female prophet.&lt;ref name=Frymer-Kensky2006/&gt;{{rp|161}}

====Abigail====
{{Main|Abigail}}
[[Abigail]] was the wife of [[Nabal]], who refused to assist the future king David after having accepted his help. Abigail, realizing David's anger will be dangerous to the entire household, acts immediately. She intercepts David bearing gifts and, with what Frymer-Kensky describes as Abigail's "brilliant rhetoric", convinces David not to kill anyone. When Nabal later dies, David weds her. Frymer-Kensky says "Once again an intelligent determined woman is influential far beyond the confines of patriarchy" showing biblical women had what anthropology terms ''informal power.''&lt;ref name=Frymer-Kensky2006/&gt;{{rp|166}}

====Ruth====
[[File:Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld- Ruth im Feld des Boaz.jpg|thumbnail|upright=1.35| ''Ruth on the fields of Boaz'' by [[Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld]]]] 
[[Ruth (biblical figure)|Ruth]] is the title character of the [[Book of Ruth]].  In the narrative, she is not an Israelite but rather is from [[Moab]]; she marries an Israelite. Both her husband and her father-in-law die, and she helps her mother-in-law, [[Naomi (biblical figure)|Naomi]], find protection.  The two of them travel to Bethlehem together, where Ruth wins the love of [[Boaz]] through her kindness.&lt;ref name=ppp&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barton |first1=George A.|title=Jewish Encyclopedia |date=1936 |publisher=Funk &amp; Wagnalls Co. |location=New York |chapter-url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/12947-ruth-book-of |chapter=Ruth, Book of}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

She is one of five women mentioned in the [[genealogy of Jesus]] found in the [[Gospel of Matthew]], alongside [[Tamar (Genesis)|Tamar]], [[Rahab]], the "wife of [[Uriah the Hittite|Uriah]]" ([[Bathsheba]]), and [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]].&lt;ref name=CBQ&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weren |first1=Wim J.

====Esther====
[[Esther]] is described in the [[Book of Esther]] as a [[Jewish]] queen of the [[Persian king]] [[Ahasuerus#Book of Esther|Ahasuerus]].  In the narrative, Ahasuerus seeks a new wife after his queen, [[Vashti]], refuses to obey him, and Esther is chosen for her beauty.

{{see also|Women in Christianity}}
The [[New Testament]] is the second part of the Christian Bible. It tells about the teachings and person of [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus]], as well as events in [[Christianity in the 1st century|first-century Christianity]]. It consists of four narratives called gospels about the life, teaching, death and resurrection of Jesus. It includes a record of the Apostolic ministries in the early church, called the [[Acts of the Apostles]]; twenty-one letters called "epistles" written by various authors to specific groups with specific needs concerning Christian doctrine, counsel, instruction, and conflict resolution; and one Apocalyptic book, the [[Book of Revelation]], which is a book of prophecy, containing some instructions to seven local congregations of Asia Minor, but mostly containing prophetical symbology about the end times.&lt;ref&gt;Geisler, Norman (1998).

===New Testament views on gender===
The New Testament names many women among the followers of Jesus and in positions of leadership in the early church.&lt;ref name="Richards"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richards|first1=Sue Poorman|last2=Richards|first2=Lawrence O.|title=Women of the Bible: The Life and Times of Every woman in the Bible|date=2003|publisher=Thomas Nelson Publishers|location=Nashville, Tenn.|isbn=978-0-7852-5148-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mary Keng Mun Chung"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Keng Mun Chung|first1=Mary|title=Chinese Women in Christian Ministry: An Intercultural Study|date=2005|publisher=Peter Lang|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8204-5198-5|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  New Testament scholar Linda Belleville says "virtually every leadership role that names a man also names a woman. In fact there are more women named as leaders in the New Testament than men.  [[Phoebe (biblical figure)|Phoebe]] is a 'deacon' and a 'benefactor' (Romans 16:11-2).  [[Mary, mother of John Mark]], [[Lydia of Thyatira|Lydia]] and Nympha are overseers of house churches (Acts 12:12; 16:15; Colossians 4:15). [[Euodia and Syntyche]] are among 'the overseers and deacons' at [[Philippi]] (Philippians 1:1; cf, 4:2-3).  The only role lacking specific female names is that of 'elder'--but there male names are lacking as well."&lt;ref name=Belleville&gt;{{cite book|author1=Linda Belleville|chapter=Chapter 1: Women in Ministry: an egalitaritan perspective|editor1-last=Beck|editor1-first=James R., et al|title=Two views on women in ministry|date=2009|publisher=Zondervan|location=Grand Rapids, Michigan|isbn=9780310254379|oclc=779330381}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|54,112}}
  
New Testament scholar [[Craig Blomberg]] and other [[complementarian]]s assert there are three primary texts that are critical to the traditional view of women and women's roles:  "''1 [[Corinthians]] 14:34-35'', where women are commanded to be silent in the church; ''1 [[First Epistle to Timothy|Timothy]] 2:11-15'' where women (according to the TNIV) are not permitted to teach or have authority over a man; and ''1 Corinthians 11:2-16'' where the male and female relationship is defined in terms of ''[[Kephale (New Testament)|kephalē]]'' commonly translated ''head.''"&lt;ref name=Blomberg/&gt;&lt;ref name=Belleville/&gt;{{rp|97}} 
 
====Jesus' interactions with women====
{{Main|Jesus' interactions with women}}
[[File:St Photina.jpg|thumb|180px|The [[Samaritan woman at the well|Samaritan woman]], meeting Jesus by the well. Orthodox [[icon]]]]
The New Testament refers to a number of women in Jesus’ inner circle. Jesus often spoke directly to women in public. The disciples were astonished to see Jesus talking with the [[Samaritan woman at the well]] of Sychar (John 4:7-26). He spoke freely with the [[Jesus and the woman taken in adultery|woman taken in adultery]] (John 8:10–11), with the [[widow of Nain]] (Luke 7:12–13), the [[Jesus healing the bleeding woman|woman with the bleeding disorder]] (Luke 8:48; cf. Matt. 9:22; Mark 5:34), and a woman who called to him from a crowd (Luke 11:27–28). Similarly, Jesus addressed a [[Jesus healing an infirm woman|woman bent over for eighteen years]] (Luke 13:12) and a [[Crucifixion_of_Jesus#Path_to_the_crucifixion|group of women on the route to the cross]] (Luke 23:27-31).  Jesus spoke in a thoughtful, caring manner. Each synoptic writer records Jesus addressing the woman with the bleeding disorder tenderly as “daughter” and he refers to the bent woman as a “daughter of Abraham” (Luke 13:16). Theologian [[Donald G. Bloesch]] infers that “Jesus called the Jewish women ‘daughters of Abraham’ (Luke 13:16), thereby according them a spiritual status equal to that of men.”&lt;ref name="Donald G. Bloesch"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bloesch |first1=Donald G. |title=Is the Bible Sexist?

Jesus held women personally responsible for their own behavior as seen in his dealings with the woman at the well (John 4:16–18), the woman taken in adultery (John 8:10–11), and the [[Anointing of Jesus|sinful woman who anointed his feet]] (Luke 7:44–50 and the other three gospels). Jesus dealt with each as having the personal freedom and enough self-determination to deal with their own repentance and forgiveness.  There are several Gospel accounts of Jesus imparting important teachings to and about women: his public admiration for [[Lesson of the widow's mite|a poor widow who donated two copper coins]] to the Temple in Jerusalem, his friendship with [[Mary of Bethany]] and [[Martha]], the sisters of [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]], and the presence of [[Mary Magdalene]], [[Mary, mother of Jesus|his mother]], and the other women as he was crucified.  New Testament scholar [[Ben Witherington III]] says "Jesus broke with both biblical and rabbinic traditions that restricted women's roles in religious practices, and he rejected attempts to devalue the worth of a woman, or her word of witness."&lt;ref name="Ben Witherington III1984"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Witherington III|first1=Ben|title=Women in the Ministry of Jesus: A Study of Jesus' attitudes to women and their roles as reflected in his earthly life|date=1984|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|isbn=0 521 34781 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|127}}

Some New Testament texts (1 Peter 2:12;3:15-16; 1 Timothy 3:6-7;5:14) explicitly discuss early Christian communities being burdened by slanderous rumors because of Roman society perceiving Christianity as a threat. Christians were accused of incest because they spoke of each other as brother and sister and of loving one another, and they were accused of cannibalism because of the Lord's supper as well as being accused of undermining family and society. Such negative public opinion played a part in the [[persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire]].&lt;ref name="Margaret Y.

===Women in the New Testament===

====Mary, mother of Jesus====
{{main|Mary, mother of Jesus}}
[[File:Frari (Venice) - Sacristy - Il Sassoferrato - Madonna in prayer.jpg|thumb|Frari (Venice) - Sacristy - Il Sassoferrato - Mary in prayer]]
Outside of the [[infancy narrative]]s, Mary is mentioned infrequently after the beginning of Jesus' public ministry. The Gospels say Mary is the one "of whom Jesus was born" (Matthew 1:16) and that she is the "favored one" (Luke 1:28). Some scholars believe the infancy narratives were interpolations by the early church. [[Bart Ehrman]] explains that Jesus is never mentioned by name in [[Jesus in the Talmud|the Talmud ]], but there is a subtle attack on the virgin birth that refers to the illegitimate son of a Roman soldier named  "Panthera." (Ehrman says, "In Greek the word for virgin is ''parthenos''").&lt;ref&gt;[[Bart D. Ehrman|Ehrman, Bart]]. ''The New Testament: A Historical Introduction to the Early Christian Writings.'' New York: Oxford University Press, 2003. {{ISBN|0-19-515462-2}}, chapters 13, 15&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|67-69}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schachter/H.Freedman|first1=Jacob|title=Sanhedrin|url=http://www.come-and-hear.com/sanhedrin/sanhedrin_43.html|website=come-and-hear.com|publisher=The Soncino Press|accessdate=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Mary is not introduced in the Gospels in a way that would make her seem noteworthy or deserving of special honor.  She is young, resides in an insignificant town, far from the centers of power, with no special social position or status, yet she is the one granted the highest of all statuses, demonstrating the supreme reversal.&lt;ref name="Joel B. Green"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Green |first1=Joel B. |editor1-last=Gaventa |editor1-first=Beverly Roberts |editor2-last=Rigby |editor2-first=Cynthia L. |title=Blessed One: Protestant Perspectives on Mary |date=2002 |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |location=Louisville, Kentucky |isbn=0-664-22438-5 |chapter=Blessed is She Who Believed}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|14}}  When she receives the announcement of Jesus' birth, she asks "How can this be?" Then, "...let it be" (1:38). 

In the Gospel of Luke, Mary visits [[Elizabeth (biblical figure)|Elizabeth]], her cousin, twice, and twice Elizabeth calls her blessed (Luke 1:42,45). Mary herself states all future generations will call her blessed (1:48). Mary "ponders" [[Simeon (Gospel of Luke)|Simeon]]'s warning that "a sword would pierce her soul" in Luke 2:34,35. She is troubled by Jesus staying behind in the Temple at Jerusalem at 12 and his assumption his parents would know where he was (Luke 2:49). Mary "ponders all these things in her heart."&lt;ref name="Joel B. Green"/&gt;{{rp|16,17}}

In all three [[synoptic gospels]],Mark, Matthew and Luke, Mary and Jesus' brothers are disowned by Jesus. The Matthew version has it as "Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to speak with thee. But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my mother? and who are my brethren? And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren! For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother." &lt;ref&gt;({{bibleverse|Matthew|12:47-50}})&lt;/ref&gt; In Luke the repudiation is even stronger, there Jesus says his disciples have to hate their mothers. "If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple."&lt;ref&gt;({{bibleverse|Luke|14:26}})&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gospel of John never identifies her by name, referring instead to "the mother of Jesus." Mary appears twice in John, once at the beginning of the Gospel, and once near its end. The first is the [[Marriage at Cana|wedding feast at Cana]] where the wine runs out. Mary tells Jesus, and his response is "Woman, what have I to do with you? My hour has not yet come." In spite of this, Mary tells the servants, "Do whatever he says." Jesus orders 6 stone water jars filled with water, and then directs that it be taken to the steward who describes it as the "best" wine. 

Jesus' mother appears again in John (19:25-27) at [[Crucifixion of Jesus|the crucifixion]], where Jesus makes provision for the care of his mother in her senior years (John 19:25-27).&lt;ref name="Beverly Roberts Gaventa"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gaventa |first1=Beverly Roberts |editor1-last=Gaventa |editor1-first=Beverly Roberts |editor2-last=Rigby |editor2-first=Cynthia L. |title=Blessed One: Protestant Perspectives on Mary |date=2002 |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |location=Louisville, Kentucky |isbn=0-664-22438-5 |chapter=Standing Near the Cross}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|48,49}} Mary speaks not a word and the narrator does not describe her.&lt;ref name="Beverly Roberts Gaventa"/&gt;{{rp|49}}

====Junia====
{{main|Junia (New Testament person)}}
Paul wrote in Romans 16:7 "Greet [[Andronicus of Pannonia|Andronicus]] and Junia, my fellow Jews who have been in prison with me. They are outstanding among the apostles, and they were in Christ before I was." Bible translator Hayk Hovhannisyan says Junia was a woman and there is consensus supporting this view.&lt;ref name="Hayk Hovhannisyan"/&gt;{{rp|297}}&lt;ref name="Craig S.

Whether this name is masculine or feminine depends on how the word was accented in Greek. ...scribes wrote Junia as feminine.

====Priscilla====
{{main|Priscilla and Aquila}}
In Romans 16:3-5 Paul refers to the married couple Priscilla and Aquilla as his "fellow workers" saying they risked their lives for him. Paul worked and seemingly lived with them for a considerable time, and they followed him to [[Ephesus]] before he left on his next missionary journey. In Acts 18:25,26 Luke says [[Apollos]], a "learned man," came to Ephesus and began speaking in the synagogue.  When Priscilla and Aquilla heard him, they took him with them and "explained the way of God more accurately." Hayk Hovhannisyan says "either Priscilla was unaware of [Paul's doctrine that a woman shouldn't teach a man], which is virtually impossible; or she knew about it and decided to rebel--or the doctrine did not exist."&lt;ref name="Hayk Hovhannisyan"/&gt;{{rp|275}}

====Mary of Bethany====

In Luke 10:39, the author says Mary sat "at Jesus feet."

====Mary Magdalene====

[[File:IVANOV YAV HRISTA MARI1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|''Appearance of Jesus Christ to Maria Magdalena'' (1835) by [[Alexander Andreyevich Ivanov]].]]
New Testament scholar Mary Ann Getty-Sullivan says Mary Magdalene, or Mary from the town of [[Magdala]], is sometimes "erroneously identified as the ''sinner'' who anointed Jesus according to Luke's description in Luke 7:36-50. She is at times also confused with Mary of Bethany, the sister of Martha and Lazarus (John 12:1-8)",  and is sometimes assumed to be the woman caught in adultery (John 7:53-8:11), though there is nothing in the text to indicate that. Luke qualifies her as "one who was healed" but otherwise little is known about her. There is nothing to directly indicate Mary Magdalene was a former prostitute, and some scholars believe she was a woman of means who helped support Jesus and his ministry.&lt;ref name="Mary Ann Getty-Sullivan"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Getty-Sullivan|first1=Mary Ann|title=Women in the New Testament|date=2001|publisher=The Liturgical Press|location=Collegeville, Minnesota|isbn=978-0-8146-2546-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|183–187}}

Mary Magdalene is inconsolable, but she turns and Jesus' speaks to her. He calls her by name and she recognizes him.&lt;ref name="Ben Witherington III"/&gt;{{rp|173,178}} Witherington adds, "There are certain parallels between the story of the appearance to Mary and John 20:24-31 (when Jesus appears to Thomas) [however] Mary is given an apostolic task (to go tell the men) and Thomas is not...  There is little doubt the Fourth evangelist wishes to portray Mary Magdalene as important, perhaps equally important for Jesus' fledgling community as [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mother Mary]] herself."&lt;ref name="Ben Witherington III"/&gt;{{rp|179, 181}}

The Roman writer [[Celsus]]' ''On The True Doctrine'', circa 175, is the earliest known comprehensive criticism of Christianity and survives exclusively in quotations from it in ''Contra Celsum'', a refutation written in 248 by [[Origen]] of Alexandria.  Margaret MacDonald says Celsus' study of Christian scripture led him to focus on Mary Magdalene as the witness to the resurrection, as someone deluded by the "sorcery" by which Jesus did miracles, and as someone who then becomes one of Jesus' primary "instigators" and "perpetrators". MacDonald explains that, "In Celsus' work, Mary Magdalene's role in the resurrection story denigrates its credibility... From beginning to end, [Celsus says] the story of Jesus' life has been shaped by the 'fanciful imaginings' of women" thus lending enemy attestation to the importance of women in the early church and of Mary Magdalene herself.&lt;ref name="Margaret Y. MacDonald"/&gt;{{rp|104}}

MacDonald sees this negative view of Mary as reflecting a challenge taking place within the church of the second century.  This was a challenge to Mary's role as a woman disciple and to leadership roles for women in general.  "The challenge to Mary's position has been evaluated as an indication of tensions between the existing fact of women's leadership in Christian communities and traditional Greco-Roman views about gender roles."&lt;ref name="Margaret Y. MacDonald"/&gt;{{rp|105}}  MacDonald adds that "Several apocryphal and gnostic texts provide evidence of such a controversy."&lt;ref name="Margaret Y.

====Herodias and her daughter====
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens 018.jpg|thumb|left|''Feast of Herod'', [[Peter Paul Rubens]]. 17th century]]
In the Gospels of Matthew and Mark, these women are involved with the execution of [[John the Baptist]]. [[Herodias]] wanted John dead, because he had called her second marriage unlawful, but her husband king [[Herod Antipas|Herod]] prevented this. On Herod's birthday, [[Salome|Herodias' daughter]] danced for him, and he was so pleased that he took an oath, in front of witnesses, that he would give her what she wanted. Her mother instructed her to ask for the head of John the Baptist on a plate, and Herod sadly agreed. The imprisoned John was beheaded, the head given to the daughter, and she gave it to her mother.

Herodias daughter is unnamed in the gospels, but has outside the Bible been referred to as Salome.

====Sapphira====
{{main|Ananias and Sapphira}}
[[File:Nicolas Poussin, La Mort de Saphire.jpg|thumb|[[Nicolas Poussin]], ''The Death of  Sapphira'']]
Ananias and his wife Sapphira were, according to the [[Acts of the Apostles]] [[Acts 5|chapter 5]], members of the [[early Christian]] [[Local church|church]] in [[Early centers of Christianity#Jerusalem|Jerusalem]]. The account records their sudden deaths after lying about money.

Acts chapter {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|4:32}} closes by stating that the first followers of Jesus did not consider their possessions to be their own but rather held in common, in order to use what they had on behalf of those in want. As told at the beginning of Acts chapter {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|5}} Ananias and Sapphira sold their land but secretly withheld a portion of the proceeds. Ananias presented his donation to [[Saint Peter|Peter]]. Peter replied, "Why is it that [[Satan]] has so filled your heart that you have lied to the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Spirit]]?" Peter pointed out that Ananias was in control of the money and could give or keep it as he saw fit, but had withheld a portion of it.  Peter stated that Ananias had lied not to men, but to God.  Ananias died on the spot and was carried out. Three hours after Ananias' death his wife arrived, unaware of what had happened. Peter asked her the price of the land that she and Ananias had sold, and Sapphira stated the same untruthful price that Ananias had given. She also fell dead.

Theologian [[James Dunn (theologian)|James Dunn]] describes this story as "one of the most unnerving episodes in the whole of the New Testament."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Strelan |first1=Rick |title=Strange Acts:Studies in the Cultural World of the Acts of the Apostles |date=2004 |publisher=De Gruyter |isbn=978-3110182002 |page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1 Corinthians 14:34-35====

These verses read in the [[Authorized Version]] "Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience as also saith the law. And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church."

====1 Timothy 2:11-15====

{{See also|Authorship of the Pauline epistles#Pastoral epistles}}

These verses in the King James version read as follows "Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection. But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence. For Adam was first formed, then Eve.And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression. Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety."

====1 Timothy 5:3-16====

1 Timothy 5:3-16 states in the Authorized Version " Honour widows that are widows indeed. But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to shew piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God.  Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in God, and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day.  But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth.  And these things give in charge, that they may be blameless.  But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.  Let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years old, having been the wife of one man, well reported of for good works; if she have brought up children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saints’ feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every good work. But the younger widows refuse: for when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ, they will marry; having damnation, because they have cast off their first faith. And withal they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not. I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully. For some are already turned aside after Satan. If any man or woman that believeth have widows, let them relieve them, and let not the church be charged; that it may relieve them that are widows indeed."

====1 Corinthians 11:2-16====
In the King James translation these verses read as " Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you. But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God. Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoureth his head.But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven. For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered. For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.For the man is not of the woman: but the woman of the man.Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man.
For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels. Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord. For as the woman is of the man, even so is the man also by the woman; but all things of God. Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered? Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him? But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering.But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God."

===1 Peter on women===

{{See also|Saint Peter|Authorship of the Petrine epistles}}

In 1 Peter 3 wives are exhorted to submit to their husbands "so they may be won over." (''Wives, in the same way, accept the authority of your husbands, so that, even if some of them do not obey the word, they may be won over without a word by their wives’ conduct'').

===Contemporary views===
There is no contemporary consensus on the New Testament view of women. Psychologist James R. Beck points out that "[[Evangelical Christians]] have not yet settled the exegetical and theological issues."&lt;ref name=BeckConclusion&gt;{{cite book|author1=James R. Beck|chapter=Conclusion|editor1-last=Beck|editor1-first=James R., et al|title=Two views on women in ministry|date=2009|publisher=Zondervan|location=Grand Rapids, Michigan|isbn=9780310254379|oclc=779330381}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|343}} [[Liberal Christianity]] represented by the development of historical criticism was not united in its view of women either: [[suffragist]] [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] tells of the committee that formed ''[[The Woman's Bible]]'' in 1895.  Twenty six women purchased two Bibles and went through them, cutting out every text that concerned women, pasted them into a book, and wrote commentaries underneath.  Its purpose was to challenge Liberal theology of the time that supported the orthodox position that woman should be subservient to man. The book attracted a great deal of controversy and antagonism. Contemporary Christianity is still divided between those who support equality of all types for women in the church, those who support spiritual equality with the compartmentalization of roles, and those who support a more modern equivalent of patriarchy.&lt;ref name="Rebecca Moore"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Moore |first1=Rebecca |title=Women in Christian Traditions |date=2015 |publisher=New York University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-1-4798-2961-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3-5}}

==In art and culture==
{{See also|Category:Operas based on the Bible}}
[[File:Regnault, Henri, Salomé.jpg|thumb|''Salomé'', by [[Henri Regnault]] (1870).]]
There are hundreds of examples of women from the Bible as characters in painting, sculpture, opera and film. Historically, artistic renderings tend to reflect the changing views on women from within society more than the biblical account that mentions them. 

Eve is a common subject. Art historian Mati Meyer says society's views of women are observable in the differing renderings of Eve in art over the centuries. Meyer explains: "Genesis 2–3 recounts the creation of man and the origins of evil and death; Eve, the temptress who disobeys God’s commandment, is probably the most widely discussed and portrayed figure in art."&lt;ref name="Mati Meyer"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Meyer|first1=Mati|title=Art: Representation of Biblical Women|url=https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/art-representation-of-biblical-women|website=Jewish Women's Archive|publisher=Jewish Women's Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mati Meyer, Eve is historically portrayed in a favorable light up through the [[Early Middle Ages]] (AD 800's), but by the [[Late Middle Ages]] (1400's) artistic interpretation of Eve becomes heavily misogynistic.  Meyer sees this change as influenced by the writings of the 4th century theologian [[Augustine of Hippo]], "who sees Eve’s sexuality as destructive to male rationality".&lt;ref name="Mati Meyer"/&gt;  By the seventeenth century, the [[Fall of man]] as a male-female struggle emerges, and in the eighteenth century, the perception of Eve is influenced by [[John Milton]]s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' where Adam's free will is emphasized along with Eve's beauty. Thereafter a secular view of Eve emerges "through her transformation into a ''[[femme fatale]]''—a compound of beauty, seductiveness and independence set to destroy the man."&lt;ref name="Mati Meyer"/&gt;

Courageous and victorious women, such as Jael, Esther and the [[deuterocanonical]] [[Judith]], were popular "moral" figures in the Middle Ages. [[The Renaissance]], which preferred the sensuous female nude up through the eighteenth century, and the "femme fatale", such as Delilah, from the nineteenth century onward, all demonstrate how the Bible and art both shape and reflect views of women.&lt;ref&gt;https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/art-representation-of-biblical-women&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Diane Apostolos-Cappadona"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Apostolos-Cappadona|first1=Diane|title=Women in Religious Art|volume=1|url=http://religion.oxfordre.com/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199340378.001.0001/acrefore-9780199340378-e-208|website=Religion|publisher=Oxford Research Encyclopedias|accessdate=18 May 2018|doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780199340378.013.208|date=Jul 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story of the biblical Queen Athaliah was the inspiration for one of the greatest tragedies of French dramatist [[Jean Racine]], ''[[Athalie]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1897/12/07/archives/athalie-played-at-harvard-racines-masterpiece-produced-before-a.html | work=The New York Times | title="ATHALIE" PLAYED AT HARVARD; Racine's Masterpiece Produced Before a Brilliant Audience in Sander's Theatre -- Gov.

The opera ''[[Salome (opera)|Salome]]'' by [[Richard Strauss]] was highly controversial when first composed due to its combination of biblical theme, eroticism and murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kobbé |first1=Gustav |title=The Complete Opera Book |date=1976 |publisher=G.

Notable representations of Salome include [[Masolino da Panicale]], [[Filippo Lippi]], [[Benozzo Gozzoli]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]] followers [[Andrea Solario]] and [[Bernardino Luini]], [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], [[Titian]], [[Caravaggio]], [[Guido Reni]], [[Fabritius]],  [[Henri Regnault]], [[Georges Rochegrosse]], [[Gustave Moreau]], [[Lovis Corinth]] and [[Federico Beltran-Masses]].

Other examples of Biblical women in operas include the story of ''[[Samson and Delilah (opera)|Samson and Delilah]]'' by [[Camille Saint-Saëns]]; it is one of the pieces that defines [[French opera]].

==Female sexuality in the early church==
{{Main|Christianity and sexuality}}{{See also|Christian views on marriage}}
Classics scholar Kyle Harper references the historian Peter Brown as showing sexuality (especially female sexuality) was at the heart of the early clash over Christianity's place in the world. Views on sexuality in the early church were diverse and fiercely debated within its various communities; these doctrinal debates took place within the boundaries of the ideas in Paul's letters and in the context of an often persecuted minority seeking to define itself from the world around it.  In his letters, Paul often attempted to find a middle way among these disputes, which included people who saw the gospel as liberating them from all moral boundaries, and those who took very strict moral stances.&lt;ref name="Kyle Harper"/&gt;{{rp|1-14,84-86,88}}  Conflicts over sexuality with the culture surrounding Christianity, as well as within Christianity itself, were fierce.  These conflicts are thought by many scholars to have impacted Bible content in the later [[Pauline Epistles]].&lt;ref name="Kyle Harper"/&gt;{{rp|1-11}}&lt;ref name="Margaret Y. MacDonald"/&gt;{{rp|164}} For example, in Roman culture, widows were required to remarry within a few years of their husband's death, but Christian widows were not required to remarry and could freely choose to remain single, and celibate, with the church's support.&lt;ref name="Kyle Harper"/&gt;{{rp|1-7}} As Harper says, "The church developed the radical notion of individual freedom centered around a libertarian paradigm of complete sexual agency."&lt;ref name="Kyle Harper"/&gt;{{rp|4}} Many widows and single women were choosing not to marry, were staying celibate, and were encouraging other women to follow, but pagan response to this female activity was negative and sometimes violent toward Christianity as a whole.&lt;ref name="Margaret Y. MacDonald"/&gt;{{rp|164}} Margaret MacDonald demonstrates these dangerous circumstances were likely the catalysts for the "shift in perspective concerning unmarried women from Paul's [early] days to the time of the [[Pastoral epistles]]".&lt;ref name="Margaret Y. MacDonald"/&gt;{{rp|164}}

The sexual-ethical structures of Roman society were built on status, and sexual modesty and shame meant something different for men than it did for women, and for the well-born than it did for the poor, and for the free citizen than it did for the slave.&lt;ref name="Kyle Harper"&gt;{{cite book| last=Harper| first=Kyle| title=From Shame to Sin: The Christian Transformation of Sexual Morality in Late Antiquity| year=2013| publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusettes| isbn=978-0-674-07277-0 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7}}  In the Roman Empire, shame was a social concept that was always mediated by gender and status.&lt;ref name="John Younger"/&gt; Classics Professor [[Rebecca Langlands]] explains: "It was not enough that a wife merely regulate her sexual behavior in the accepted ways; it was required that her virtue in this area be conspicuous."&lt;ref name="Rebecca Langlands"&gt;{{cite book| last=Langlands| first=Rebecca| title=Sexual Morality in Ancient Rome|year=2006| publisher=Cambridge University Press| location=Cambridge, UK| isbn=978-0-521-85943-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{rp|10,38}}  Younger says men, on the other hand, were allowed live-in mistresses called ''[[pallake]].''&lt;ref name="John Younger"&gt;{{cite book| last=Younger| first=John| title=Sex in the Ancient World from A to Z|year=2005| publisher=Routledge| location= New York| isbn=978-0-415-24252-3| page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Roman society did not believe slaves had an inner ethical life or any sense of shame, since they had no status, therefore concepts of sexual morality were not applicable to slaves.&lt;ref name="Kyle Harper"/&gt;{{rp|84–86, 88}}  Langlands points out this value system permitted Roman society to find both a husband's control of a wife's sexual behavior a matter of intense importance, and at the same time, see the husband's sex with young slave boys as of little concern.&lt;ref name="Rebecca Langlands"/&gt;{{rp|12,20}} 

Harper says: "The model of normative sexual behavior that developed out of Paul's reactions to the erotic culture surrounding him...was a distinct alternative to the social order of the Roman empire."&lt;ref name="Kyle Harper"/&gt;{{rp|85}} For Paul, according to Harper, "the body was a consecrated space, a point of mediation between the individual and the divine."&lt;ref name="Kyle Harper"/&gt;{{rp|88–92}} The obligation for sexual self-control was placed equally on all people in the Christian communities, men or women, slave or free. In Paul's letters, ''[[porneia]],'' (a single name for an array of sexual behaviors outside marital intercourse), became a central defining concept of sexual morality, and shunning it, a key sign of choosing to follow Jesus. Sexual morality could be shown by forgoing sex altogether and practicing chastity, remaining virgin, or having sex only within a marriage.&lt;ref name="Kyle Harper"/&gt;{{rp|88–92}} Harper indicates this was a transformation in the deep logic of sexual morality as personal rather than social, spiritual rather than merely physical, and for everyone rather than solely for those with status.&lt;ref name="Kyle Harper"/&gt;{{rp|6,7}}

'''Zeus''' is a [[fictional deity]] in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]], an interpretation of [[Zeus]] from [[Greek mythology]]. His appearances are most significant in stories of [[Wonder Woman]] (Princess Diana). With the 2011 relaunch of DC Comics dubbed [[The New 52]], Zeus has received a prominent role in the Wonder Woman mythos, as he is now the biological father of Wonder Woman through [[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Hippolyta]].

==Fictional character biography==
Zeus' origins and early history mostly conform to the way they are presented in classical mythology. He is a child of the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]] [[Cronus]] and [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]] and leader of the twelve [[Olympian Gods (DC Comics)|Olympian Gods]]. During a war between the Titans and Olympians, Zeus slays his father and assumes his place as King of the Gods, ruling from [[Mount Olympus]] with his sister-wife [[Hera (DC Comics)|Hera]]. He is the father of numerous gods and heroes, the most famous being [[Hercules (DC Comics)|Hercules]].

In the DC Universe, the machinations of the alien god [[Darkseid]] when he spreads tales of the Roman Gods cause the Olympians to split into multiple aspects, with the [[Roman mythology|Roman]] gods existing for a time as separate entities. Zeus' counterpart [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] rules his own Olympus in a separate dimension following this. The two pantheons are merged into single entities again centuries later.

In present day, Zeus has been a benefactor of the [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazons]], the last remaining people that still worship the Olympians. However, his patriarchal attitudes, disregard for mortals, and unreasonable demands have sometimes led to conflict with his followers, particularly their champion Wonder Woman.

After Wonder Woman's defeat of [[Ares (DC Comics)|Ares]], which caused the latter to go into self-exile, Zeus becomes interested in Diana and wants her [[virginity]], offering to make her a goddess. Diana becomes the first woman ever to refuse his advances while professing love for him as god and father. Enraged at being rejected, Zeus threatens her, but is summoned back to Olympus by [[Hera]] at the urging at the Goddesses who created the Amazons and are incensed themselves at Zeus trying to make Themyscira his personal brothel.  As punishment, Zeus demands that Diana undertake the Challenge of the Gods, on which she defeats the evils that have been trapped under [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Paradise Island]], including a [[Hecatonchires|Hecatonshire]] and the [[Lernaean Hydra]]. She frees Heracles, who had been turned to stone and was supporting the Island.&lt;ref&gt;''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #7-16&lt;/ref&gt;

During a [[War of the Gods (comics)|War of the Gods]], Zeus leads the Olympians in a conflict with their Roman counterparts and other deities, until mortal heroes intervene to end the war. After Darkseid destroys the glory of [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[Action Comics]]'' #600&lt;/ref&gt; Zeus convinces the other gods to abandon both it and Earth, and only [[Hermes (DC Comics)|Hermes]] refuses. The gods later return to Olympus but have occasionally been forced to defend or relocate it.

As in classical myth, Zeus frequently cheats on his wife Hera and couples with mortals to produce [[demi-god]] offspring. Zeus has been revealed as the father of [[Wonder Girl (Cassie Sandsmark)]] and shares a complicated relationship with his daughter, who resents his absence from most of her life.

Zeus is briefly deposed as ruler of Olympus during a coup staged by his daughter [[Athena (DC Comics)|Athena]] with help from Ares. In the wake of this conflict, Athena becomes Queen of the Gods and Ares is appointed Lord of the [[Greek Underworld|Underworld]]. Shortly after this, the gods enter their second exile, following the Amazons into another dimension after the events of the [[Infinite Crisis]]. Their return to the Earth-realm is brought about by Darkseid, who captures the Olympians and tampers with their memories, seeking the secrets of their power. In ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis]]'' Darkseid's [[New Gods]] pose as Olympians and manipulate their followers. Once freed from Darkseid, the old Olympian order is restored. Athena seemingly perishes from her sustained injuries and Zeus once again becomes King of the Gods, giving Mary Marvel her powers back after she frees the Gods from a chamber on Apokolips.

Zeus' manipulations of his followers finally come to a head with the creation of the [[Gargareans]], a race of warriors intended as male counterparts of the Amazons. Zeus murders the [[Hawaii]]an god [[Kāne Milohai]], a patron of Wonder Woman, and uses his heart to resurrect [[Olympian (comics)#Achilles Warkiller|Achilles Warkiller]], whom he appoints as leader of the Gargareans. Zeus also instates Achilles as the new ruler of [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themyscira]]. When Wonder Woman learns of this and of the murder of Kāne, she becomes enraged and physically assaults Zeus. This blasphemy shocks her mother [[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Hippolyta]] and leads Diana to enter self-exile, forsaking her former

In September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Wonder Woman's origin is revised, with her now being the biological daughter of Zeus. Zeus and Hippolyta engaged in combat, and their fight ended with the couple having sex, and thus Diana was conceived. This encounter was hidden from Diana, who was raised to believe that she was born out of clay, in order to protect Diana from Hera (Zeus' wife).&lt;ref&gt;''Wonder Woman'' Vol. 4 #3&lt;/ref&gt; Lennox (another illegitimate offspring of Zeus) commented that Zeus has been "scarpered off the immortal coil", hinting that he has apparently died.&lt;ref&gt;''Wonder Woman'' Vol. 4 #5&lt;/ref&gt; It is revealed that Zeus was reborn as a baby by his daughter [[Athena]] (much as Zeus had given birth to her from his head) who had been plunged into the fictitious personality and matching body of a woman named [[Zola (DC Comics)|Zola]] who believed Zeke to be her youngest son by Zeus. Fulfilling the prophecy involving Zeus's last born son, Zeke is revealed to be the king of the gods himself, and the spell on Athena ends. Wonder Woman pleads with Athena, however, to vacate this form she has created so Wonder Woman can keep her friend Zola and mother to the new baby Zeus, who could be a better king of the gods with Zola as the mother he never really had before in his life.&lt;ref&gt;''Wonder Woman'' Vol. 4 #35&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Depending on the writer, Zeus' powers require either direct or indirect worship to sustain them.  Without this worship his powers may fade over time allowing other gods to equal or surpass him.
