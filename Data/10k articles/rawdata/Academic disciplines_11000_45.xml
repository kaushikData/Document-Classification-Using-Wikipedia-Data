'''Alexander Alfonsovich Grossheim''' (6 March 1888 – 4 December 1948) was a Ukrainian [[botanist]]. He travelled widely over the Caucasus region collecting and studying various different plant life. He is most known for [[Pteridophytes]] and [[Spermatophytes]] species.

==Biography==
Alexander Alfonsovich Grossheim (or Grossgeim) was born in Lichovka (also known as Lykhivka in [[Dnipropetrovsk Oblast]]). He was an expert on the flora of the [[Caucasus]].&lt;ref name=jstor&gt;{{cite web|title=Grossheim, Alexander Alfonsovich (1888-1948)|url=http://plants.jstor.org/person/bm000151575 |publisher=plants.jstor.org |accessdate=18 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating from [[University of Moscow]] with a [[doctorate]] in 1912, he became the director of the Azerbaijan Institute of Botany.&lt;ref name=jstor/&gt;

In 1919, he described ''Fritillaria grandiflora'', which later re-classified as a subspecies of ''[[Fritillaria kotschyena]]'' and ''[[Fritiallaria tatianae]]''.&lt;ref name=lily&gt;{{cite web| editor-first=Alan | editor-last=Mitchell|  title=Lilies and related plants | year=2013 | url=http://www.rhslilygroup.org/2013-2014_LR.pdf | format=pdf| pages=79 | publisher=RHS Lily Group| accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1929 he moved to the [[National Botanical Garden of Georgia|Tiflis (Tbilisi) Botanic Garden]] in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. He still carried on plant collecting expeditions in the Caucasus.&lt;ref name=jstor/&gt;

Between 1928 and 1934, he recorded up to 5767 plant species (out of the 6200 recorded species) in his volumes of ''Flora Kavaza'' (''Flora of the Caucasus'', 1928-1934). In 1939, he started a second volume with annotated maps.&lt;ref&gt;David G. Frodin {{Google books|aMjXCF4rmDUC| Guide to Standard Floras of the World: An Annotated, Geographically Arranged|page=675}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, Grossheim was appointed curator of the Caucasian Herbarium at the [[Komarov Botanical Institute]] in Leningrad ([[Saint Petersburg]]), and also director of the Department of Plant Systematics and Morphology at [[St. Petersburg University]]. When he died in 1948, he was still working on the second edition of his ''Flora Kavkaza'', which was continued by his colleague Andrej Fedorov.&lt;ref name=jstor/&gt;

Losina-Losinskaya named ''[[Fritillaria grossheimiana]]'' in his honour, but this is now thought to be a synonym of'' Fritillaria crassifolia'' subsp. ''kurdica''.&lt;ref name=lily/&gt;

The genus ''Grossheimia'' Sosn. &amp; Takht. (synonym ''[[Centaurea]]'') was named in his honour. 
''Grossheimiana'' was also used as a name for a subgenus of grasses.&lt;ref&gt;Harold T. Clifford, Peter D. Bostock{{Google books|FQRHAAAAQBAJ|Etymological Dictionary of Grasses|page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''animal behavior consultant''' is a practitioner of [[applied behavior analysis]] to help correct behavior problems in animals, usually [[Pet|companion animals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Pet Professional Accreditation Board - Home|url=http://www.credentialingboard.com/|website=The Pet Professional Accreditation Board|accessdate=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the IAABC|url=https://iaabc.org/about|website=International Association of Applied Animal Behavior Consultants|accessdate=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to become a certified dog behavior consultant|url=http://www.ccpdt.org/certification/dog-behavior-consultant/|website=Certification Council for Professional Dog Trainers|accessdate=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Animal behavior consultants are usually employed to identify the cause of a behavior problem, to develop an intervention plan to change the problem behavior, and to help the owners learn how to execute that plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What IS behavior consulting, really?|url=http://gooddogrising.com/uploads/Ann_s_article_COTD_July_2012.pdf|website=Good Dog Rising|accessdate=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Animal behavior consultants are distinct from [[Animal training|animal trainers]], in that their primary goal is not to train an animal to have basic manners or to perform a task, such as agility competition for dogs, but to mitigate behaviors that are problems for the animal's owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What are trainers and consultants?|url=http://www.associationofanimalbehaviorprofessionals.com/whataretrainers.html|website=Association of Animal Behavior Professionals|accessdate=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Animal Behavior Consulting 101 Part 1: What is an Animal Behavior Consultant?|url=http://iaabc.org/articles/animal-behavior-consulting-101-part-1-what-is-an-animal-behavior-consultant|website=International Association of Animal Behavior Consultants|accessdate=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Animal behavior consultants may also be known as pet behavior counsellors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pet behaviourcounsellor|url=https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/job-profiles/pet-behaviour-counsellor|website=National Careers Service|accessdate=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; or pet psychologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to become a pet psychologist|url=http://www.psychologyschoolguide.net/career-guides/becoming-a-pet-psychologist/|website=Psychology School Guide|accessdate=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

The issues that an animal behavior consultant will typically be called upon to address depend on the species of animal and its living situation. There are, however, some problems that are common to all species of companion animal. These include [[aggression]] towards other animals or humans, [[Self-harm|self-injury]] and [[Stereotypy|stereotypies]], [[phobia]]s, isolation and separation-related stress behaviors, destructiveness, making excessive noise, and resource guarding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Amat|first=Marta|last2=Torre|first2=José Luís Ruiz de la|last3=Fatjó|first3=Jaume|last4=Mariotti|first4=Valentina M.|last5=Wijk|first5=Sophie Van|last6=Manteca|first6=Xavier|title=Potential risk factors associated with feline behaviour problems|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0168159109002627|journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science|volume=121|issue=2|pages=134–139|doi=10.1016/j.applanim.2009.09.012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.aspca.org/pet-care/dog-care/common-dog-behavior-issues|title=Common Dog Behavior Issues|newspaper=ASPCA|access-date=2017-02-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Horseman|first=Susan V.|last2=Buller|first2=Henry|last3=Mullan|first3=Siobhan|last4=Whay|first4=Helen R.|date=2016-08-08|title=Current Welfare Problems Facing Horses in Great Britain as Identified by Equine Stakeholders|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0160269|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=11|issue=8|pages=e0160269|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0160269|issn=1932-6203|pmc=4976980|pmid=27501387}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davis|first=Christine|year=1991|title=Parrot psychology and behavior problems|url=|journal=Veterinary Clinics of North America: Small Animal Practice|volume=21|pages=1281–1288|via=PubMed}}&lt;/ref&gt; The kinds of behaviors that consultants are called in to address may not be [[Ethology|ethologically]] abnormal for the animal; they may be inappropriate given the individual animal’s living situation and either undesirable from the client’s point of view, a cause of diminished welfare for the animal, or both.

Animal behavior consultants may hold group classes for some behavior problems, and may work on-site at laboratories, zoos, sanctuaries or [[animal shelter]]s; many work in clients’ homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.animalbehaviorsociety.org/web/education-careers.php|title=Animal Behavior Society|access-date=2017-02-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to become a pet psychologist|url=http://www.psychologyschoolguide.net/career-guides/becoming-a-pet-psychologist/|website=Psychology School Guide|accessdate=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A typical in-home animal behavior consultation usually includes the following stages:

# '''Intake questionnaire or interview.''' After the initial contact, the animal behavior consultant collects a history of the animal’s life so far, a description of the current living situation, a description of the problem behavior and the circumstances in which the behavior happens, and a history of what the clients have done to address the issue so far.
# '''Initial consultation and observation.''' The consultant will visit the client and animal in its current environment, and observe the animal. If practically and ethically possible, the consultant will observe the animal engaging in the problem behavior and identify the antecedents and consequences of that behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.associationofanimalbehaviorprofessionals.com/whataretrainers.html|title=What Are Trainers and Consultants? {{!}} Association of Animal Behavior Professionals|website=www.associationofanimalbehaviorprofessionals.com|language=en|access-date=2017-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Intervention design.''' Certified animal behavior consultants will design interventions that conform to the Least Invasive, Minimally Aversive (LIMA) model of [[behavior modification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/book/10.1002/9780470344514|title=Handbook of Applied Dog Behavior and Training: Procedures and Protocols, Volume 3 - Lindsay - Wiley Online Library|language=en|doi=10.1002/9780470344514}}&lt;/ref&gt; They will work to develop a management plan that prevents the problem behavior from occurring, and a modification plan that teaches the animal a more desirable alternative, using relevant principles of applied behavior analysis.
# '''Implementation.''' In most cases, the consultant will teach the client some basic animal training skills, such as how to use a marker, such as a [[clicker]], and how to deliver appropriate [[reinforcement]] or punishment. They will also teach the client to recognize the environmental [[Antecedent (behavioral psychology)|antecedents]] to the problem behavior—what causes the behavior to happen—and basic observation of the animal’s [[body language]] and recognition of stress signals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dogwise.com/ItemDetails.cfm?ID=DTB1281|title=THE HUMAN HALF OF DOG TRAINING -  COLLABORATING WITH CLIENTS TO GET RESULTS - Dog Training Books - Dogwise.com|website=www.dogwise.com|access-date=2017-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The client will then follow the consultant’s plan, with follow-up sessions as necessary.

Most animal behavior consultants work face to face with the animal and human client; however, in some cases, the consultant will work remotely over video and email. Remote consultation is a particularly common modality in [[Separation anxiety in dogs|separation anxiety]] cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cottam|first=Nicole|last2=Dodman|first2=Nicholas H.|last3=Moon-Fanelli|first3=Alice A.|last4=Patronek|first4=Gary J.|date=2008-01-01|title=Comparison of Remote Versus In-Person Behavioral Consultation for Treatment of Canine Separation Anxiety|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10888700701729148|journal=Journal of Applied Animal Welfare Science|volume=11|issue=1|pages=28–41|doi=10.1080/10888700701729148|issn=1088-8705}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to veterinary medicine==

Behavior consultants do not practice [[veterinary medicine]], unless they are also veterinarians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Behavioral help for your pet|url=https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/general-pet-care/behavioral-help-your-pet|website=ASPCA|accessdate=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Veterinarians may choose to refer animals with behavioral issues to behavior consultants, and some veterinarians maintain working relationships with specific behavior consultants for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Referring to trainers|url=http://www.lindellvetbehavior.com/to-whom-to-refer.pml|website=Veterinary behavior consultations, PC|accessdate=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some general practice veterinarians also choose to see behavior cases themselves. While few [[Veterinary education|veterinary schools]] have extensive behavioral programs, some general practice veterinarians may choose to further their own education in this area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Juarbe-Diaz|first=Soraya|year=2008|title=Behavioral medicine opportunities in North American colleges of veterinary medicine: A status report|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jveb.2007.09.007|journal=Journal of Veterinary Behavior: Clinical Applications and Research|volume=3|pages=4–11|via=ScienceDirect}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a veterinary behavior specialty exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American College of Veterinary Behaviorists|url=http://www.dacvb.org/|website=ACVB|accessdate=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Veterinary behaviorists are veterinary specialists with extensive education and experience in working with behavior problems. Behavior consultants may refer cases to veterinary behaviorists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What IS behavior consulting, really?|url=http://gooddogrising.com/uploads/Ann_s_article_COTD_July_2012.pdf|website=Good Dog Rising|accessdate=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially animals who may benefit from behavioral medication, as only veterinarians are legally able to prescribe medications for animals.

==Education==

Animal behavior consultants need education in a variety of different areas to be successful. They need to know about the normal behaviors of their chosen species, to understand the etiology of abnormal behaviors and have the skills to develop effective interventions to change abnormal behaviors and instruct their clients in implementing these interventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.aspca.org/pet-care/dog-care/common-dog-behavior-issues|title=Common Dog Behavior Issues|newspaper=ASPCA|access-date=2017-02-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Animal Behavior Consulting 101 Part 1: What is an Animal Behavior Consultant?|url=http://iaabc.org/articles/animal-behavior-consulting-101-part-1-what-is-an-animal-behavior-consultant|website=International Association of Animal Behavior Consultants|accessdate=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This knowledge can come from a variety of sources: undergraduate and graduate studies in animal behavior or a related discipline such as [[psychology]] from accredited colleges; online courses through professional and technical schools; or in-person classes through [[Humane society|humane societies]] and other animal education organizations. There is no single course of study that will fully equip an aspiring animal behavior consultant for the job.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://iaabc.org/articles/part-2-what-is-certification|title=Animal Behavior Consulting 101 Part 2: What is Certification? {{!}} IAABC Articles|website=iaabc.org|access-date=2017-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As animal behavior consulting requires the practitioner to be highly skilled in the mechanics of training animals—for example, in the timing of [[Clicker training|markers]] and delivery of reinforcers—aspiring consultants often undertake practical training. This can be in the form of a [[mentorship]] under a more experienced animal trainer or behavior consultant, classes as part of advanced training for volunteers at animal shelters and humane societies, and/or workshops that form part of certificates and diplomas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.animalbehaviorsociety.org/web/applied-behavior-definition.php|title=Animal Behavior Society|access-date=2017-02-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Animal behavior consultants also need to develop strong observational and interpersonal skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Animal Behavior Consulting 101 Part 1: What is an Animal Behavior Consultant?|url=http://iaabc.org/articles/animal-behavior-consulting-101-part-1-what-is-an-animal-behavior-consultant|website=International Association of Animal Behavior Consultants|accessdate=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developing these skills to a high enough level to be successful requires that a prospective animal behavior consultant has some in-person observation and assessment of how they work. Often, an aspiring animal behavior consultant will [[Job shadow|shadow]] a more experienced colleague, accompanying them to visits and working with them in developing behavioral intervention plans and providing written guidelines for clients.

==Certification==
The term “certified animal behavior consultant” can be used to describe an individual who either has been awarded a certificate, or who holds a current [[professional certification]] in animal behavior consulting. The major difference between a certificate and certification is that certifications are awarded retrospectively, based on an independent assessment of an applicant’s knowledge and skills, whereas certificates are awarded on completion of a program of study, and assess the student’s knowledge of that program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ice.socious.com/p/cm/ld/fid=4|title=ICE : Certificate vs. Certification: What's the Difference?|website=ice.socious.com|access-date=2017-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are certifying organizations for animal behavior consultants in the United States, United Kingdom, and internationally. Certification is awarded by professional organizations to individuals who have completed their application process and paid their dues. Organizations have different standards, admission requirements, and assessment procedures. The majority of certifying organizations are species-specific; however, a small number, such as the International Association of Animal Behavior Consultants, offer separate certifications for different species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://iaabc.org/articles/part-2-what-is-certification|title=Animal Behavior Consulting 101 Part 2: What is Certification? {{!}} IAABC Articles|website=iaabc.org|access-date=2017-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most organizations require recertification every three years. To recertify, an animal behavior consultant must provide evidence of continuing education, usually in the form of [[continuing education unit]]s (CEUs).

There is no legal requirement for an animal behavior consultant to become certified, [[Licensure|licensed]], or otherwise recognized by any professional organizations in order to practice. In most of the world, no specific regulations apply to the profession of animal training or behavior consulting.

Certifications exist for dog, cat, parrot, and horse behavior consultants, but clients can hire behavior consultants to work with any species. It is generally recommended that potential clients hire a consultant with experience in their animal’s species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://responsibledog.net/2017/02/08/choosing-your-dog-trainer-or-behavior-consultant-guidelines/|title=Choosing Your Dog Trainer or Behavior Consultant Guidelines|last=Kesling|first=Joyce|date=2017-02-08|website=Responsible Dog Training and Behavior Solutions Sarasota Bradenton FL|access-date=2017-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experience is necessary because applied behavior analysis requires knowledge of typical behaviors in the species, how to observe and interpret body language, and the best way to reinforce desired behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.aspca.org/pet-care/dog-care/common-dog-behavior-issues|title=Common Dog Behavior Issues|newspaper=ASPCA|access-date=2017-02-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3398">'''Author profiling''' is a method of analyzing a given number of texts to try to uncover various characteristics of the [[author]] (e.g. age and gender) based on stylistic- and content-based features.

== Overview ==
&lt;p&gt;
Automatic Authorship Identification (AAI) has existed for almost 120 years. [[Thomas Corwin Mendenhall]] was the first to examine works of [[Francis Bacon]], [[William Shakespeare]], and [[Christopher Marlowe]] aiming to detect quantitative stylistic differences using word length.&lt;ref&gt;Mendenhall, Thomas Corwin. "The characteristic curves of composition." Science (1887): 237-249. &lt;/ref&gt; Since then, things have changed rapidly due to the development of technology.
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;
There are three major fields in AAI: authorship attribution, author identification, and author profiling. In the first two, the goal is to recognize the author from a set of authors, while in author profiling, the goal is to find specific characteristics of the author, based on stylistic- or content-based features.&lt;ref&gt;Mikros, George K., and Kostas Perifanos. "Authorship Attribution in Greek Tweets Using Author's Multilevel N-Gram Profiles." 2013 AAAI Spring Symposium Series. 2013. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stamatatos, Efstathios. "A survey of modern authorship attribution methods." Journal of the American Society for information Science and Technology 60.3 (2009): 538-556. &lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;
The author profiling task is a yet unsolved problem, due to its difficulty. It has been studied by many researchers and, while some show great progress and good results, it still has many unexplored areas and room for improvement. Through the organizational efforts of PAN,{{Clarification needed|reason=|date=December 2017}} many teams around the globe try every year to find the characteristics of authors.&lt;ref name="PAN2015"&gt;Rangel, Francisco, et al. "Overview of the 3rd Author Profiling Task at PAN 2015." CLEF. 2015. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rangel, Francisco, et al. "Overview of the 2nd author profiling task at pan 2014." CEUR Workshop Proceedings. Vol. 1180. CEUR Workshop Proceedings, 2014. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rangel, Francisco, et al. "Overview of the author profiling task at pan 2013." CLEF Conference on Multilingual and Multimodal Information Access Evaluation. CELCT, 2013. &lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;
Characteristics vary between approaches, but age and gender are usually among them.&lt;ref name="argamon"&gt;Argamon, Shlomo, et al. "Mining the blogosphere: Age, gender and the varieties of selfexpression." First Monday 12.9 (2007). &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nguyen, Dong-Phuong, et al. "" How old do you think I am?"

"Automatically categorizing written texts by author gender." Literary and Linguistic Computing 17.4 (2002): 401-412. &lt;/ref&gt; Other personality traits have included the [[zodiac]] and the [[Job|occupation]] of the author.&lt;ref name="PAN2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Schler_blog" /&gt;

A '''backdrive''' is a component used in reverse to obtain its input from its output. This extends to many concepts and systems from thought based to practical mechanical applications.

Not every system can be backdriven. A DC [[electrical generator]] can be implemented by backdriving a DC [[electric motor]], however a [[worm drive]] works only in one direction.

Example: A CNC vertical mill has a vertical lead screw on the Z-axis. A low lead screw pitch (i.e. 5 turns per inch or fewer) means when the driving motor power is removed such as by turning the machine off, the weight of the spindle will cause the lead screw to rotate as the spindle motor falls down. Obviously this is a bad thing. The solution to prevent back-driving is to use a finer (higher) lead screw pitch (i.e. 10tpi or greater) or have a locking mechanism.

{{refimprove|date=October 2011}}
A '''biological network''' is any [[network science|network]] that applies to [[biological system]]s. A network is any system with sub-units that are linked into a whole, such as species units linked into a whole [[food web]]. Biological networks provide a [[graph theory|mathematical representation]] of connections found in [[ecological network|ecological]], [[phylogenetic network|evolutionary]], and [[physiological]] studies, such as [[neural networks]].&lt;ref name="Proulx05"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Proulx | first1=S.

==Network biology and bioinformatics==
Complex biological systems may be represented and analyzed as computable networks. For example, ecosystems can be modeled as networks of interacting species or a protein can be modeled as a network of amino acids. Breaking a protein down farther, [[amino acids]] can be represented as a network of connected [[atom]]s, such as [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]], and [[oxygen]]. [[vertex (graph theory)|Nodes]] and [[vertex (graph theory)|edges]] are the basic components of a network. Nodes represent units in the network, while edges represent the interactions between the units. Nodes can represent a wide-array of biological units, from individual organisms to individual neurons in the brain. Two important properties of a network are [[vertex (graph theory)|degree]] and [[betweenness centrality]]. Degree (or connectivity, a distinct usage from that used in [[Connectivity (graph theory)|graph theory]]) is the number of edges that connect a node, while betweenness is a measure of how central a node is in a network.&lt;ref name="Proulx"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Proulx, S.R. |title= Network thinking in ecology and evolution |journal= Trends in Ecology and Evolution |year= 2005  |volume= 20 |issue= 6 |pages= 345–353 |doi=10.1016/j.tree.2005.04.004 |pmid=16701391|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nodes with high betweenness essentially serve as bridges between different portions of  the network (i.e. interactions must pass through this node to reach other portions of the network). In social networks, nodes with high degree or high betweenness may play important roles in the overall composition of a network.

As early as the 1980s, researchers started viewing [[DNA]] or [[genome]]s as the dynamic storage of a language system with precise computable finite [[state (computer science)|states]] represented as a [[finite state machine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |author= Searls, D. |title= Artificial intelligence and molecular biology |publisher= MIT Press |year= 1993 |location= Cambridge, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent [[complex system]]s research has also suggested some far-reaching commonality in the organization of information in problems from biology, [[computer science]], and [[physics]], such as the [[Bose–Einstein condensate]] (a special state of matter).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bianconi, G.  |author2=Barabasi A.  |lastauthoramp=yes |title= Bose-Einstein condensation in complex networks |journal= Phys. Rev. Lett. |year= 2001  |volume= 86 |issue= 24 |pages= 5632–5635 |doi=10.1103/physrevlett.86.5632|pmid=11415319  |arxiv=cond-mat/0011224|bibcode=2001PhRvL..86.5632B|hdl=2047/d20000696  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bioinformatics has increasingly shifted its focus from individual [[gene]]s, proteins, and [[search algorithm]]s to large-scale networks often denoted as [[omics|-omes]] such as [[biome]], [[interactome]], [[genome]] and [[proteome]]. Such theoretical studies have revealed that biological networks share many features with other networks such as the [[Internet]] or [[social network]]s, e.g. their [[network topology]].

==Networks in biology==

===Protein–protein interaction networks===
{{main article|interactome}}
Many [[protein–protein interaction]]s (PPIs) in a cell form ''protein interaction networks'' (PINs) where proteins are ''nodes'' and their interactions are ''edges''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Habibi|first=Iman|last2=Emamian|first2=Effat S.|last3=Abdi|first3=Ali|date=2014-01-01|title=Quantitative analysis of intracellular communication and signaling errors in signaling networks|journal=BMC Systems Biology|volume=8|pages=89|doi=10.1186/s12918-014-0089-z|issn=1752-0509|pmc=4255782|pmid=25115405}}&lt;/ref&gt; PINs are the most intensely analyzed networks in biology. There are dozens of PPI detection methods to identify such interactions. The [[Y2H|yeast two-hybrid system]] is a commonly used experimental technique for the study of binary interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Mashaghi, A. |title= Investigation of a protein complex network |journal= European Physical Journal |year= 2004  |volume= 41 |issue= 1 |pages= 113–121 |doi=10.1140/epjb/e2004-00301-0|display-authors=etal|arxiv= cond-mat/0304207|bibcode= 2004EPJB...41..113M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent studies have indicated conservation of molecular networks through deep evolutionary time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Sharan, R. |title= Conserved patterns of protein interaction in multiple species |journal= Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |year= 2005  |volume= 102 |issue= 6 |pages= 1974–1979 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0409522102|pmid= 15687504 |display-authors=etal|pmc= 548573|bibcode= 2005PNAS..102.1974S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, it has been discovered that proteins with high degrees of connectedness are more likely to be essential for survival than proteins with lesser degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Jeong, H. |title= Lethality and centrality in protein networks |journal= Nature |year= 2001  |volume= 411 |issue= 6833 |pages= 41–42 |doi=10.1038/35075138 |pmid=11333967|display-authors=etal|bibcode= 2001Natur.411...41J |arxiv= cond-mat/0105306 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that the overall composition of the network (not simply interactions between protein pairs) is important for the overall functioning of an organism.

===Gene regulatory networks (DNA–protein interaction networks)===

{{main article| Gene regulatory network}}
The activity of genes is regulated by [[transcription factors]], proteins that typically bind to [[DNA]]. Most transcription factors bind to multiple binding sites in a [[genome]]. As a result, all cells have complex [[gene regulatory networks]]. For instance, the [[human genome]] encodes on the order of 1,400 DNA-binding transcription factors that regulate the expression of more than 20,000 human genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Vaquerizas, J.-M. |title= A census of human transcription factors: function, expression and evolution |journal= Nature Reviews Genetics |year= 2009  |volume= 10 |issue= 4 |pages= 252–263 |pmid= 19274049 |doi=10.1038/nrg2538|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technologies to study gene regulatory networks include [[ChIP-chip]], [[ChIP-seq]], [[CliP-seq]], and others.

===Gene co-expression networks (transcript–transcript association networks)===
{{main article| Gene co-expression networks}}
Gene co-expression networks can be interpreted as association networks between variables that measure transcript abundances. These networks have been used to provide a systems biologic analysis of DNA microarray data, RNA-seq data, miRNA data etc.
[[Weighted correlation network analysis|weighted gene co-expression network analysis]] is widely used to identify co-expression modules and intramodular hub genes. Co-expression modules may correspond to cell types or pathways. Highly connected intramodular hubs can be interpreted as representatives of their respective module.

===Metabolic networks===
{{main article|metabolic network}}
The chemical compounds of a living cell are connected by biochemical reactions which convert one compound into another. The reactions are catalyzed by [[enzymes]]. Thus, all compounds in a cell are parts of an intricate biochemical network of reactions which is called [[metabolic network]]. It is possible to use network analyses to infer how selection acts on metabolic pathways.&lt;ref name="Proulx" /&gt;

===Signaling networks===
{{main article|Cell signaling}}
Signals are transduced within cells or in between cells and thus form complex signaling networks. For instance, in the [[MAPK/ERK pathway]] is transduced from the cell surface to the cell nucleus by a series of protein–protein interactions, phosphorylation reactions, and other events. Signaling networks typically integrate [[interactome|protein–protein interaction networks]], [[gene regulatory networks]], and [[metabolic network]]s.

===Neuronal networks===
{{main article| Biological neural network}}
The complex interactions in the [[brain]] make it a perfect candidate to apply network theory. [[Neuron]]s in the brain are deeply connected with one another and this results in complex networks being present in the structural and functional aspects of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bullmore, E.  |author2=O. Sporns  |lastauthoramp=yes |title= Complex brain networks: graph theoretical analysis of structural and functional systems |journal= Nature Reviews Neuroscience |year= 2009  |volume= 10 |issue= 3 |pages= 186–198 |doi=10.1038/nrn2575 |pmid=19190637}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[small-world network]] properties have been demonstrated in connections between cortical areas of the primate brain&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Stephan, K.E. |title= Computational analysis of functional connectivity between areas of primate cerebral cortex |journal= [[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B]]|year= 2000  |volume= 355 |issue= 1393 |pages= 111–126 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2000.0552|pmid= 10703047 |display-authors=etal|pmc= 1692715}}&lt;/ref&gt; or during swallowing in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2016-12-01|title=Functional connectivity patterns of normal human swallowing: difference among various viscosity swallows in normal and chin-tuck head positions|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006899316306783|journal=Brain Research|volume=1652|pages=158–169|doi=10.1016/j.brainres.2016.09.041|pmid=27693396|pmc=5102805|issn=0006-8993|last1=Jestrović|first1=Iva|last2=Coyle|first2=James L|last3=Perera|first3=Subashan|last4=Sejdić|first4=Ervin}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that cortical areas of the brain are not directly interacting with each other, but most areas can be reached from all others through only a few interactions.

===Food webs===
{{main article|Food web}}
All organisms are connected to each other through feeding interactions. That is, if a species eats or is eaten by another species, they are connected in an intricate [[food web]] of predator and prey interactions. The stability of these interactions has been a long-standing question in ecology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= MacArthur, R.H. |author-link= Robert MacArthur|title= Fluctuations in animal populations and a measure of community stability |journal= Ecology |year= 1955  |volume= 36 |issue= 3 |pages= 533–536 |doi=10.2307/1929601|jstor= 1929601}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is to say, if certain individuals are removed, what happens to the network (i.e. does it collapse or adapt)? Network analysis can be used to explore food web stability and determine if certain network properties result in more stable networks. Moreover, network analysis can be used to determine how selective removals of species will influence the food web as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Dunne, J.A. |title= Network structure and biodiversity loss in food webs: robustness increases with connectance |journal= Ecology Letters |year= 2002  |volume= 5 |issue= 4 |pages= 558–567 |doi=10.1046/j.1461-0248.2002.00354.x|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially important considering the potential species loss due to global climate change.

===Between-species interaction networks===
{{main article|social relation}}
In biology, pairwise interactions have historically been the focus of intense study. With the recent advances in [[network science]], it has become possible to scale up pairwise interactions to include individuals of many species involved in many sets of interactions to understand the structure and function of larger [[ecological network]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Bascompte, J. |title= Disentangling the web of life |journal= Science |year= 2009 |volume=325 |issue= 5939 |pages= 416–419 |doi=10.1126/science.1170749 |pmid=19628856|bibcode=2009Sci...325..416B }}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of [[Social network analysis|network analysis]] can allow for both the discovery and understanding how these complex interactions link together within the system’s network, a property which has previously been overlooked. This powerful tool allows for the study of various types of interactions (from [[competitive]] to [[cooperative]]) using the same general framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Krause, J. |title= Animal social networks: an introduction |journal= Behav. Ecol.

===Within-species interaction networks===
{{main article|social relation}}
Network analysis provides the ability to quantify associations between individuals, which makes it possible to infer details about the network as a whole at the species and/or population level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Croft, D.P |title= Social networks in the guppy (Poecilia reticulate) |journal= [[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B]] |year= 2004 |volume= 271 |issue= Suppl |pages= S516–S519 |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2004.0206|pmid= 15801620 |pmc= 1810091 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers interested in animal behavior across a multitude of taxa, from insects to primates, are starting to incorporate network analysis into their research. Researchers interested in social insects (e.g., ants and bees) have used network analyses to better understand division of labor, task allocation, and foraging optimization within colonies;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Dornhaus, A. |title= Benefits of recruitment in honey bees: Effects of ecology and colony size in an individual-based model |journal= Behavioral Ecology |year= 2006 |volume=17 |issue= 3 |pages= 336–344 |doi=10.1093/beheco/arj036|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Linksvayer, T. |title= Developmental evolution in social insects: Regulatory networks from genes to societies |journal= Journal of Experimental Zoology Part B: Molecular and Developmental Evolution |year= 2012 |volume=318 |issue= 3 |pages= 159–169 |doi=10.1002/jez.b.22001|pmid= 22544713 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Mullen, R. |title= A review of ant algorithms |journal= Expert Systems with Applications |year= 2009 |volume=36 |issue= 6 |pages= 9608–9617 |doi=10.1016/j.eswa.2009.01.020|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers are interested in how certain network properties at the group and/or population level can explain individual level behaviors.  For instance, a study on wire-tailed manakins (a small passerine bird)  found that a male’s [[degree (graph theory)|degree]] in the network largely predicted the ability of the male to rise in the social hierarchy (i.e. eventually obtain a territory and matings).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Ryder, T.B. |title= Social networks in the lek-mating wire-tailed manakin (''Pipra filicauda'') |journal= [[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B]]  |year= 2008 |volume= 275 |issue= 1641 |pages= 1367–1374 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2008.0205 |pmid=18381257 |pmc=2602714|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[bottlenose dolphin]] groups, an individual’s degree and [[betweenness centrality]] values may predict whether or not that individual will exhibit certain behaviors, like the use of side flopping and upside-down lobtailing to lead group traveling efforts; individuals with high betweenness values are more connected and can obtain more information, and thus are better suited to lead group travel and therefore tend to exhibit these signaling behaviors more than other group members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Lusseau, D. |title= Evidence for social role in a dolphin social network |journal= Evolutionary Ecology |year= 2007 |volume=21 |issue= 3 |pages= 357–366 |doi=10.1007/s10682-006-9105-0|arxiv= q-bio/0607048 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Network analysis can also be used to describe the social organization within a species more generally, which frequently reveals important proximate mechanisms promoting the use of certain behavioral strategies. These descriptions are frequently linked to ecological properties (e.g., resource distribution). For example, network analyses revealed subtle differences in the group dynamics of two related equid [[fission-fusion society|fission-fusion]] species, [[Grevy’s zebra]] and [[onager]]s, living in variable environments; Grevy’s zebras show distinct preferences in their association choices when they fission into smaller groups, whereas onagers do not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Sundaresan, S. |title= Network metrics reveal differences in social organization between two fission-fusion species, Grevy's zebra and onager |journal= Oecologia |year= 2007 |volume= 151 |issue= 1 |pages= 140–149 |doi=10.1007/s00442-006-0553-6|pmid= 16964497 |display-authors=etal|bibcode= 2007Oecol.151..140S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, researchers interested in primates have also utilized network analyses to compare social organizations across the diverse [[primate]] order, suggesting that using network measures (such as [[centrality]], [[assortativity]], [[modularity (networks)|modularity]], and betweenness) may be useful in terms of explaining the types of social behaviors we see within certain groups and not others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kasper, C. |author2=Voelkl, B. |title= A social network analysis of primate groups |journal= Primates |year= 2009 |volume= 50 |issue=4 |pages= 343–356 |doi=10.1007/s10329-009-0153-2|pmid=19533270 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Finally, social network analysis can also reveal important fluctuations in animal behaviors across changing environments. For example, network analyses in female [[chacma baboon]]s (''Papio hamadryas ursinus'') revealed important dynamic changes across seasons which were previously unknown; instead of creating stable, long-lasting social bonds with friends, baboons were found to exhibit more variable relationships which were dependent on short-term contingencies related to group level dynamics as well as environmental variability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Henzi, S. |title= Cyclicity in the structure of female baboon social networks |journal= Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology |year= 2009 |volume= 63 |issue= 7 |pages= 1015–1021 |doi=10.1007/s00265-009-0720-y|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in an individual's social network environment can also influence characteristics such as 'personality': for example, social spiders that huddle with bolder neighbours tend to increase also in boldness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Hunt, ER. |title= Social interactions shape individual and collective personality in social spiders |journal= Proceedings of the Royal Society B |year= 2018 |volume= 285 |issue= 1886 |pages= 20181366 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2018.1366|pmid= 30185649 |pmc= 6158534 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a very small set of broad examples of how researchers can use network analysis to study animal behavior. Research in this area is currently expanding very rapidly. Social network analysis is a valuable tool for studying animal behavior across all animal species, and has the potential to uncover new information about animal behavior and social ecology that was previously poorly understood.

A '''Bongard problem''' is a kind of puzzle invented by the Russian [[computer scientist]] [[Mikhail Moiseevich Bongard]] (Михаил Моисеевич Бонгард, 1924–1971), probably in the mid-1960s. They were published in his 1967 book on [[pattern recognition]]. Bongard, in the introduction of the book (which deals with a number of topics including [[perceptron]]s) credits the ideas in it to a group including [[M. N. Vaintsvaig]], [[V. V. Maksimov]], and [[M. S. Smirnov]].

==Overview==
The idea of a Bongard problem is to present two sets of relatively simple diagrams, say ''A'' and ''B''. All the diagrams from set ''A'' have a common factor or attribute, which is lacking in all the diagrams of set ''B''. The problem is to find, or to formulate, convincingly, the common factor. The problems were popularised by their occurrence in the 1979 book ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]'' by [[Douglas Hofstadter]], himself a composer of Bongard problems. Bongard problems are also at the heart of the game [[Zendo (game)|Zendo]].

Many computational architectures have been devised to solve Bongard problems, the most extensive of which being [[Phaeaco]], by [[Harry Foundalis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foundalis.com/res/diss_research.html|accessdate=24 October 2013|author=Harry Foundalis|title=The Bongard Problems}}&lt;/ref&gt; who left the field in 2008 due to ethical concerns regarding machines that can pass as human.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foundalis.com/soc/why_no_more_Bongard.html|accessdate=24 October 2013|title=Why I stopped working on the Bongard Problems|author=Harry Foundalis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10387">'''Bounded emotionality''' is a [[communications studies]] approach to dealing with [[emotional control]] in the workplace. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Emotional control simply refers to how [[Employment|employers and employees]] handle the range of emotions that naturally occur in the [[workplace]]. These emotions can occur because of work, or they can be brought into work from an employee's home life. Bounded emotionality was proposed by [[Dennis K. Mumby]] and [[Linda L. Putnam]]. Mumby and Putnam (1992) stress that bounded emotionality encourages the [[Emotional expression|expression]] of a wide range of emotions. Their theory encourages expression of emotions because it is a way to maintain [[interpersonal relationships]] and [[Personal boundaries|boundaries]] among people in the organization. Additionally, the expression of emotions strengthens work relations because people bond over mutual feelings. Bounded emotionality is a broad framework for organizations to use when dealing with emotions.  It has six defining characteristics. The characteristics are: [[intersubjective]] limitations, spontaneously emergent work feelings, tolerance of [[ambiguity]], [[heterarchy]] of values, integrated [[self identity]] and [[Authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]], and [[Sense of community|community]]. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

== Origins ==
Prior to Mumby and Putnam's specific articulation of bounded emotionality research and the role it plays in what is known about organizational emotion regulation, workplace emotion research focused on the relationship between emotion regulation, [[work performance]] and general attitudes towards work. Traditionally, two concepts, '''[[bounded rationality]]''' and '''[[emotional labor]]''' were used to describe conventional organizational theory pertaining to emotional regulation. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Bounded Rationality:''' Whereas bounded emotionality encourages the expression of a large spectrum of emotions in organizational communication, bounded rationality advocates for the “control” or tempering of any emotion or [[Personality|personal characteristics]] that may interfere with [[rational]] organizational decision making. Simon introduced the term bounded rationality and cast it as “bounded” because he viewed highly emotion-based forms of reasoning such as [[intuition]] and [[judgement]] as [[irrational]] and thus unhelpful in reaching organizational goals. Bounded rationality approaches to emotional regulation not only devalue individual emotion in the workplace but also view excessive emotional expression as [[inappropriate]] for the work setting. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Emotional Labor:''' Emotional labor refers to the way in which individuals manage emotions based on what is perceived as “appropriate” in specific social or environmental situations. Human beings often pay close attention to their surroundings and how they should act in certain social situations. A variety of organizational factors as well as personal factors may impact emotional regulation including: [[socialization]], [[Interpersonal_communication#Situational_milieu|channels of communication]], departmental differences (e.g. sales vs. packaging), etc. In an organization that deploys a bounded emotionality approach to emotional regulation, much less emotional labor will be required than an organization that deploys a bounded rationality approach.

Mumby and Putnam introduced the concept of bounded emotionality as an alternative organizational concept to bounded rationality and emotional labor in order to demonstrate the instability of traditional understandings and highlight what they believe to be the importance of emotions in organizational decision-making. In an organization framed by bounded emotionality (as opposed to bounded rationality and emotional labor), hierarchical goals and values are flexible as emotion and the physical self are not isolated from the process of organizing. In other words, emotions are “bounded” in organizations to protect [[interpersonal relationships]] and mutual understandings, two organizational aspects that Mumby and Putnam argue as important to success. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Bounded emotionality vs. Unbounded emotionality ==

'''Unbounded Emotionality''' should be enacted not for the instrumental gain of the organization, but to enhance the well-being of the individual organizational members. [[Work stress]] is a political, organizational and community issue that can be difficult to implement in large organizations. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Bounded Emotionality''' is a limited, pragmatic approach to the problem of emotional control in organizations. It focuses on work related emotions, defined as, “feelings, sensations, and affective responses to organizational sensations”. However, it is acknowledged that such work feelings stem from and affect emotions that come from one’s [[personal life]]. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* Encourages the expression of a wider range of emotions than is usually condoned in traditional and [[normative]] organizations

* Stresses the importance of maintaining interpersonally sensitive, variable boundaries between what is felt and what is expressed

* The goal of bounded emotionality to build interpersonal relationships through mutual understanding of work related feelings

* Six defining characteristics &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Defining characteristics ==
'''Intersubjective Limitations''': This is a necessary restriction known by individuals in the organization that helps them adequately work with and respond to one another . Just as individuals do in personal relationships, they need to respect emotional boundaries in professional ones. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
 ex: If a coworker feels certain emotional expressions or topics are inappropriate, you will not discuss them. Similarly, they will respect what you find inappropriate. Those [[personal boundaries]] are the intersubjective limitations of the work relationship.  For instance, a cabin crew member may be absolutely repulsed by vomit, but when a passenger vomits that cabin crew member controls the disgust and helps calms the passenger down. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Spontaneously emergent work feelings''': Feelings about work emerge in response to work tasks. Generally these form around the organizations [[Organisation climate|climate]] and [[workplace|environment]]. This is natural and [[management]] should not try to ascribe feelings to employees. When spontaneous feelings emerge they should be dealt with within the previously set intersubjective limitations. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
 ex: An example of this would be a study done on [[hair stylists]]. The study found that for the employee they found enjoyment when a [[customer]] confided in them about a private matter. That consumer as well would find it satisfying, therefore more likely to return. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Tolerance of [[ambiguity]]''': Complex emotions are likely to occur because of emotional labor (the process of controlling emotions during interactions at work). Bounded emotionality entails tolerance of these complex emotions. Contradictory feelings must coexist. This constitutes a new norm that wants to be aware of different positions, and even those directly opposite among its organizational members. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
 ex: People with low tolerance of ambiguity experience stress react prematurely and avoid ambiguous stimuli. The person with high tolerance will look at ambiguous situations as desirable, challenging, and interesting. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''[[Heterarchy]] of [[values]]''': The opposite of [[hierarchy]] of values, or placing certain values as more important than others. A heterarchy of values means that no one is set above another. The context of situations and individual preferences determines what values may be prioritized in a given moment. There is not just one universal set of values guiding one's life choices. Heterarchy is designed for handling the innovative side of things therefore it requires a different form of conflict management. This helps prevent undermining the governing logic. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
 ex: An individual may highly value human life but be against abortion rights, but maybe be for the death penalty, or the other way around. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Integrated [[Self-concept|Self Identity]] and [[Authenticity (philosophy)|Authenticity]]''': Bounded emotionality assumes that people have one single [[Identity (social science)|identity]]. This means that that their [[personality]], their [[values]], and their actions are the same no matter where they are physically. The goal of bounded emotionality is to make it easy to be one's [[true self]] while at work. It means you are part of a social collective working toward obtaining goals for your organization. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
 ex: If an [[actor]] brings in private experiences to create an original character presentation. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''[[Sense of community|Community]]''': The purpose of bounded emotionality is to create a strong sense of community among its members. There is a need for connections within freedom and for diversity within individuality.  Research has shown this structure works best in smaller organizations. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
 ex: When a director encourages questions and then the director discusses performance related critiques with them afterwards developing a sense of togetherness. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Braille music''' is a [[Braille code]] that allows music to be notated using [[Braille]] cells so music can be read by visually impaired musicians.  The Braille music system was originally developed by [[Louis Braille]].

[[File:Braille cell.svg|thumb|Braille cell, 2 dots wide by 3 dots high]]Braille music uses the same six-position [[Braille cell]] as literary braille.  However braille music assigns a separate meaning to each braille symbol or group of symbols different from literary braille and has its own syntax and abbreviations.

Almost anything that can be written in print music notation can be written in braille music notation.  However, braille music notation is an independent and well-developed system with its own conventions.

The world's largest collection of braille music is located at the National Library for the Blind in Stockport, UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nlb-online.org/mod.php?mod%3Duserpage%26menu%3D130002%26page_id%3D50 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-06-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050313234416/http://www.nlb-online.org/mod.php?mod=userpage&amp;menu=130002&amp;page_id=50 |archivedate=2005-03-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Learning Braille music ==
Braille music is in general neither easier nor more difficult to learn than print music. Visually impaired musicians gain the same benefits upon learning to read braille music as sighted musicians who learn to read print music. Visually impaired musicians can begin learning braille music about the time they have reasonable competence reading literary Braille.

== Teaching Braille music ==
Braille music for beginners, like print music for beginners, is quite simple.  Music teachers with no previous knowledge of braille music can easily learn the rudiments of braille music notation and keep a step or two ahead of the student who is learning braille music.  Some common print method books are available in braille so a sighted teacher can use a print version and the visually impaired student braille version or the other way around.

== Transcribing music into Braille ==
Much commonly used music has been transcribed into braille.  In the U.S. this is available from the National Library Service (NLS) of the Library of Congress (free for qualified individuals) and through other sources.  Most countries have a national library similar to the NLS.

However, many visually impaired musicians require a good deal of music that has never before been transcribed.  In the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, and many other countries, there is a network of braille music transcribers who can transcribe such music.

Another option is to use a computer-music system.  Such systems typically allow a user to enter music into a computerized music notation program.  The software then automatically converts the print notation into braille. One such software program is called Goodfeel. The visually impaired individual can enter music notation within the Lime program, which has been scripted so the process of music entry is accessible. Then this file can be imported into Goodfeel which converts the music into a Braille file that can be exported to a Braille embosser or read on a portable Braille display.

== Introduction to Braille music symbols and syntax ==
Some of the most common braille music symbols and combinations are summarized in the chart below:

[[File:braillemusicsummary.gif|Braille Music Summary Graphic]]

=== Pitch and rhythm ===
As the "Notes" section of the music braille chart above indicates, a single symbol shows both the pitch and rhythmic length of a note.  For instance, dots 1,4,5 indicate an eighth note (or 128th note) C. Every rhythm symbol in braille music does double duty—8th notes and 128th notes use the same symbols, as do quarter notes and 64th notes, half notes and 32nd notes, and whole notes and 16th notes.  Beginners first learn the most common rhythmic value (8th, quarter, half, and whole notes).  For advanced users there is never rhythmic ambiguity because the context, including time signature and bar lines, makes the intended rhythmic value clear.  For instance, in a measure of 4/4 time that includes only the symbol with dots 1,3,4 (whole or 16th rest), context says the symbol must indicate a whole rest.

=== Octave marks ===
An octave mark is included before a note symbol to specify the octave of the note.  For instance, the 4th Octave is the octave starting with middle C and going up to the B above middle C. Octaves are only specified when needed.  For instance, a melody proceeding upward from the first octave can, if moving by step, proceed to the second, third, and fourth octaves without requiring additional octave signs. The rule is that, in the absence of an octave mark specifying otherwise, notes move by a unison, 2nd, or 3rd rather than a 6th, 7th, or octave.  For instance, the following moves upward continuously, ending in octave 5:

:Octave 2 C C D E F G A B C D E F G A B C D E F G A B B C C

The rule for 4ths and 5ths is different, however: in the absence of an octave sign specifying otherwise, a melodic leap of a 4th or 5th will stay within the same octave as the previous note.  For instance, the following always stays within Octave 2:

:Octave 2 C G D A E B F C G D A E

Because of the use of octave marks, clef symbols are not required in braille music.  On occasion, clef symbols (bass clef, treble clef, or other) will be indicated so the visually impaired musician will be aware of every detail of the print score.

=== Musical markings ===
Musical indications like "dim", "cresc", or "rit" are inserted inline with the note and rhythm notation and, to differentiate them from note, octave, and other musical signs, always preceded by the "word sign" (dots 3,4,5).

Slurs may be indicated by a slur sign between two notes or bracket slur surrounding a group of notes to be slurred.

Musical signs such as staccato or tenuto are generally placed before the note or chord they affect.  The musical signs shown on the chart are shown modifying a quarter note C (dots 1,4,5,6).

"Music hyphen" is used to indicate that a measure will be continued on the following line (this happens somewhat more often in braille music than in print music).

A "word apostrophe" indicates that the word will be continued on the following line.

=== Repetition symbols ===
Braille music tends to be rather bulky.  Because of this, a system of repetition symbols—much more extensive than that in print music—is employed to reduce page turns, size of scores, and expense of printing.

The repetition symbol (dots 2,3,5,6) is used similarly to the musical repetition symbol [[File:Repetition symbol.jpg]] to indicate that a beat, half measure, or full measure is to be repeated.

In addition, braille music often includes instructions such as "repeat measure 2 here" or "repeat measures 5-7 here".  Such indications are in addition to the commonly used repeat marks and first and second endings.

=== Contrapuntal lines and chords within a staff ===
Unlike print music notation, braille music is a linear format.  Therefore, certain conventions must be used to indicate [[contrapuntal]] lines and chords, situations where more than one note is played simultaneously within a staff.

==== In-accords ====
Independent contrapuntal lines within a staff are indicated via whole- or part-measure in-accords.  The first of the contrapuntal lines is given, then the second, enclosed by the in-accord symbols.  The in-accord symbols indicate that the two lines are to be played simultaneously.

==== Interval notation ====
Homophonic chordal sections are written using interval notation.  For instance, the notation "quarter-note-C, 3rd, 5th" would indicate playing a C along with the notes a 3rd and 5th higher than C, making a chord C-E-G a quarter note in length. Reading the interval notation is somewhat complicated by the fact that some staves use bottom-up notation (the bottom note of each chord is specified and intervals are read upwards from the given note) and some use top-down notation (the top note of each chord is specified and intervals are read downwards from the given note). The modern convention is to specify the main note (either the bass line or melody line) and let the intervals go up or down from there as appropriate.  For instance, in most piano music the left hand specifies the bottom note and intervals go bottom-up while the right hand specifies the top note and intervals go top-down. Many older scores have all staves reading bottom-up or all reading top-down. Most scores have a note indicating the direction of the interval notation.  However, in some older scores the direction must be established from the context. By convention, in-accords are given in the same direction as the interval notation. Thus, examining the in-accords is one way to establish whether the interval notation on a particular staff is bottom-up or top-down.

=== Dealing with different staves ===
Printed music is often written on several different staves.  For instance, piano music is typically written on two different staves combined into the [[grand staff]]: one for treble clef and one for bass clef, while choral music often has four different staves (one each for soprano, alto, tenor, and bass).  The notes in different staves that play simultaneously are aligned vertically. Because of the linear nature of braille music and the fact that the blind musician can typically read only one staff at a time, multiple staves are handled in several ways depending on the complexity of the music and other considerations. ''Bar over bar format'' is most similar to print music.  Simple piano music in bar over bar format is quite similar to print music, with right-hand notation on the top line and left-hand notation on the bottom line.  Some degree of vertical alignment between the right and left hands is maintained. Other ways of dealing with multiple-staff music are ''line over line format'', [http://www.brl.org/music/code/bmb/chap29/index.html ''section by section format''], ''paragraph style'', and ''bar by bar format''.  As a rule these formats take up less space on the page but require more of the musician in working out how to fit the staves together. For instance, in a piano score notated in section by section format, the right-hand part may be written out for the first 8 measures, followed by the left-hand part.  No attempt is made to align the parts. The same procedure is followed for measures 9-16, and so on, section by section, throughout the score. The blind musician learns and memorizes one section right hand alone, then left hand alone, then works out the hands together by memory and referencing various spots in the braille score to work out how the sections fit together. A note from the transcriber often clarifies the format used.  However, with many older and more complex scores the format must be determined by examination of the music and context.

== Variations in Braille music ==
Over the years and in the many different countries, a variety of minor differences in braille music practice have arisen.  Some countries have preferred a different standard for interval or staff notation or used different codes for various less common musical notations. An international effort to standardize the braille music code culminated in the updates summarized in [http://www.brl.org/music/index.html Braille Music Code 1997] and detailed in the [http://www.opustec.com/products/newintl/newbrl.html New International Manual of Braille Music Notation (1997)].  However, users should be aware that they will continue to encounter divergences when ordering scores from printing houses and libraries because these are often older and come from various countries.

The center's goal is to increase understanding of community interactions and to harness the power of novel technologies to support the needs of real and virtual communities. The Center was inaugurated on November 13, 2008. 	The director is Derek Hansen, an assistant professor in the iSchool at the University of Maryland.

== Projects ==

Ongoing projects include:

*Improving Mass Vaccination Clinic Operations
*External Knowledge Management and Climate Change
* Libraries, Technology, and Older Adult Communities
*How and Why Physicists and Chemists Use Blogs

== Funding ==

At the inaugural ceremony, Dr. [[Marc Smith (American sociologist)|Marc Smith]], Chief Social Scientist for [[Telligent Systems]] and founder of the Community Technologies Group at [[Microsoft Research]], presented the CASCI Director with a $2,000 gift to support the Center's activities.

==Activities==

Each Tuesday morning there is a roundtable discussion; some of these feature speakers from funding agencies interested in community-related projects, while others are more informal discussions. Skill-building workshops are also held, in which professors or students with particular expertise present their ideas to the group.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20808">'''Cognitive inhibition''' refers to the mind's ability to tune out stimuli that are irrelevant to the task/process at hand or to the mind's current state. Cognitive inhibition can be done either in whole or in part, intentionally or otherwise.&lt;ref name=MacLeod&gt;{{cite journal| last = MacLeod| first = Colin| title = Concept of Inhibition in Cognition| year = 2007| url = http://www.artsci.wustl.edu/~msommers/aging/inhibit0.pdf| accessdate = March 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive inhibition in particular can be observed in many instances throughout specific areas of [[cognitive science]].

==History==

The early models of what would become the study and concept of cognitive inhibition were developed by [[Sigmund Freud]]. Inhibition was believed to play two primary roles: the prevention of unwanted thoughts or behaviors, and the [[Psychological repression|repression]] of experiences from infancy and childhood.&lt;ref name=Dempster&gt;{{cite journal| last = Dempster| first = F.N.| title = Chapter 1: A Historical Perspective| journal = Interference and Inhibition in Cognition| year = 1995| url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1021992632168?LI=true#page-3| accessdate = March 3, 2013| doi=10.1023/A:1021992632168| volume=11| pages=1–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freud believed cognitive inhibition was not just a lack of awareness to stimuli but an active process, requiring a constant energy expenditure.&lt;ref name=Dempster /&gt;

Other early theories of cognitive inhibition focused on its central developmental mechanisms and were founded by Luria and Vygotsky, two Russian psychologists. They proposed that children acquire control of behavior and thought through internalized speech, and that they consciously exhibit a cognitively inhibitory process in order to regulate their own behavior. Cognitive inhibition was thought to develop as mental control over behavior developed.

During the past 30 years inhibitory mechanisms such as cognitive inhibition have not been particularly prominent in [[developmental psychology]], but currently they are undergoing a revival in the study of inefficient inhibition (explored in a later section) and resource limitations.&lt;ref name=Dempster /&gt;

==Developmental psychology==

Cognitive inhibition can be seen at work during studies in [[developmental psychology]].  An experiment done by Friedman and Leslie&lt;ref name=MacLeod /&gt; explained children's performance in the [[Theory of mind#False-belief task|false belief task]] as relying on a critical inhibitory process. What this demonstrated is that reaching the age of 3 or 4 triggers cognitive inhibition ability formation.&lt;ref name=MacLeod /&gt; The idea is that children who are 3 or 4 can suppress information from their cognitive experience in order to evaluate a situation from another's point of view. This is very important developmentally as it may interact with the formation of [[empathy]]: cognitive inhibition cannot be so great as to completely block one's experiences while evaluating another point of view, but must be strong enough to enable an accurate representation of that point of view. Other elements of cognitive inhibition that are studied in developmental psychology include memory formation &lt;ref name=Harnishfeger&gt;{{cite journal| last = Harnishfeger| first = Katherine| title = The Development of Cognitive Inhibition| publisher = Academic Press, Inc.| location = San Diego, CA| year = 1995| url = https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=lJ5ubLyVaGYC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA175&amp;dq=harnishfeger+memory+formation&amp;ots=i9OxRMNODo&amp;sig=kk-o4lud62_NJ7Vm5n7RTGSuia8#v=onepage&amp;q=harnishfeger%20memory%20formation&amp;f=false| accessdate = March 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[memory inhibition]]. It has been demonstrated that intentional inhibition of memory commitment is not fully developed until adulthood, and is very difficult for children to accomplish. This illustrates the fact that cognitive inhibition tasks, such as those in memory processing, are a gradually acquired skill rather than instinctual. Other cognitive functions that are developed gradually throughout childhood include exercising self-control over retained representational structures of information and quickly adapting cognitive processing to changing behavioral situations. Both of these functions were determined to be present throughout development, but not at full capacity until young adulthood.&lt;ref name=Davidson&gt;{{cite journal| last = Davidson| first = Matthew|author2=Dima Amso |author3=Loren Cruess Anderson |author4=Adele Diamond | title = Development of cognitive control and executive functions from 4 to 13 years: Evidence from manipulations of memory, inhibition, and task switching| journal = Neuropsychologia| volume = 44| issue = 11| pages = 2037–2078| publisher = Neuropsychologia| year = 2006| pmc=1513793| doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2006.02.006 | pmid=16580701}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidently, the ability to intentionally ignore irrelevant details and to focus attention and [[cognitive ability]] on more relevant details is not present in young children and is a highly developmentally-related process.&lt;ref name=Harnishfeger /&gt;

==Role in survival==

Cognitive inhibition may have played a role in the survival of human children, in what is called [[betrayal trauma theory]].&lt;ref name="Freyd"&gt;{{cite journal|last = Freyd|first = Jennifer|title = What is a Betrayal Trauma? What is Betrayal Trauma Theory?|journal = Encyclopedia of Psychological Trauma|pages = 76|publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons|location = New York|year = 2008|url = http://pages.uoregon.edu/dynamic/jjf/defineBT.html|accessdate = March 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; "In situations involving treacherous acts by a caregiver, a 'cognitive information blockage' may occur that results in an isolation of knowledge of the event from awareness".&lt;ref name=Todd&gt;{{cite journal| last = Todd| first = Peter|author2=Ralph Hertwig |author3=Ulrich Hoffrage | title = Evolutionary Cognitive Psychology| journal = Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology| year = 2004| url = http://library.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/ft/pt/PT_Evolutionary_2005.pdf| accessdate = March 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This motivated forgetting caused by cognitive inhibition would have been necessary in the past to maintain the crucial relationship between child and caregiver so that the child would survive; therefore, cognitive inhibition has endured through [[evolution]]. For example, a parent or caregiver may have been abusive physically or emotionally to a child, perhaps not intentionally, but the effect would be the same to the child. However, the world outside the protection of the caregiver would be even less forgiving and almost certainly fatal to the child in ancient history. So, they cognitively inhibited the memory of the abuse in order to maintain the relationship.

==Behavioral psychology==
[[Behavioral psychology]] may play an important part in the development of cognitive inhibition.
Cognitive inhibition is believed to strongly influence both sexual and aggressive urges within human society. When signals or stimuli are perceived by an individual, the mind processes the information and the body elicits a response. However, in the case of sexual arousal or perceived aggressive behavior, the individual needs to exercise caution in the cognitive processing of the incoming signals. This is where cognitive inhibition plays its part, preventing the individual from cognitively processing the stimuli and selecting an inappropriate response, thus potentially saving crucial social relationships.&lt;ref name=Dempster2&gt;{{cite journal| last = Dempster| first = F|author2=A. Corkill| title = Neo-interference research and the development of intelligence| journal = The development of intelligence| pages = 215–243| publisher = Hove| year = 1999| jstor = 10.1086/650572| volume=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Behavior towards others in a social circle is strongly influenced by [[empathy]], which can be seen as a form of cognitive inhibition. Empathy causes an individual to understand the physical/emotional pain and suffering of others. When an interaction occurs, cognitive inhibition on the part of the individual causes him or her to respond appropriately and avoid upsetting someone already in physical or emotional pain. Again, this is important in maintaining [[social relationships]].

Behavioral control is an important application of cognitive inhibition in [[behavioral psychology]], as is emotional control. [[Depression (mood)|Depression]] is an example of cognitive inhibition failure in emotion control. Correctly functioning cognitive inhibition would result in reduced selective attention to negative stimuli and retention of negative thoughts. "There is emerging evidence that depression is characterized by deficits in the inhibition of mood-congruent material.

Hostile stimuli magnitude are considered and ignored to avoid confrontation. Social context situations that may be interpreted as hostile are processed, and through cognitive inhibition, logic and reasoning are used to handle the situation. When a degree of cognitive inhibition ability is absent in an individual, it can result in "trait anger", or frequent angry and violent outbursts at relatively inoffensive stimuli.&lt;ref name=Robinson /&gt; Without cognitive inhibition and its resulting omission of irrelevant or unimportant information, emotional stability can be compromised.

==Behavioral neuroscience==

[[Behavioral neuroscience]] applies the principles of [[neurobiology]], to the study of physiological, genetic, and developmental mechanisms of behavior.   Cognitive inhibition is caused by several different interacting [[biological]] factors. The first is the existence of inhibitory [[neurotransmitters]], or chemicals emitted by brain cells to both communicate and inhibit communication between each other. "[[GABA]], an inhibitory transmitter substance that has been implicated in certain simple behavioral measures of inhibition and the control of aggressive behavior, was discovered in the [[cerebral cortex]] in substantial quantities".&lt;ref name=Dempster2 /&gt; Given the [[cerebral cortex]]'s importance in many brain functions such as memory and thought, the presence of the inhibitory substance GABA supports the cognitive inhibition processes that go on in this area of the brain. [[Serotonin]] and [[dopamine]], which can play inhibitory roles as well, are present in the brain in large quantities. All three of these [[neurotransmitters]] are capable of "blocking" the transmissions between neurons, which can ultimately result in cognitive inhibition. In addition, the presence of inhibitory connections in the [[central nervous system]] has been firmly demonstrated (Eccles, 1969). A process known as [[lateral inhibition]], which involves the capacity of an excited neuron to reduce the activity of its neighbors, is integral in the biology of cognitive inhibition. It provides much of the [[neural]] background behind it and explains what exactly is going on at the [[cell (biology)|cellular]] level.

==Theory of inefficient inhibition==

Many contemporary cognitive theorists postulate models featuring a central pool "of mental resources that must be allocated to the various operations involved in processing, retaining, and reporting information".&lt;ref name=Dempster /&gt; This means that [[working memory]] and the various areas of the [[brain]] responsible for it are theoretically limited to a finite set of "mental resources" or mental capacity with which to carry out operation. Cognitive inhibition, of course, is responsible for determining what is relevant to the working memory and shuts out what is irrelevant, "freeing up space" and mental capacity needed for more pressing matters. In the theory of inefficient inhibition, cognitive inhibition does not perform its function fully, and a shortage of mental resources leads to decreased performance or inefficiency in tasks that require more mental capacity. While inefficient inhibition can result naturally in individuals diagnosed with mild [[cognitive impairment]], this effect is especially pronounced in [[methamphetamine]]-dependent individuals.&lt;ref name=Salo&gt;{{cite journal | last = Salo | first = Ruth |author2=Thomas E. Nordahl |author3=Kate Possin |author4=Martin Leamon |author5=David R. Gibson |author6=Gantt P. Galloway |author7=Neil M. Flynn |author8=Avishai Henik |author9=Adolf Pfefferbaum |author10=Edith V. Sullivan  | title = Preliminary evidence of reduced cognitive inhibition in methamphetamine-dependent individuals | journal = Psychiatry Research | volume = 111 | pages = 65–74 | doi=10.1016/s0165-1781(02)00111-7  | year = 2002 | url = http://ucdirc.ucdavis.edu/people/papers/salo_nordahl_etal_PR2002.pdf | accessdate = March 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinically, these individuals can be highly distractible and exhibit difficulty focusing, which illustrates the fact that cognitive inhibition is being impaired and that inefficient inhibition is resulting. Because of the nature of the [[psychoactive drug]], the brain is unable or reduced in its capacity to shut out irrelevant stimuli to the task at hand, and so tries to process and respond to any and all stimuli. This is most likely due to the effects of [[methamphetamine]] on inhibitory [[neurotransmitters]] like [[GABA]], discussed in an earlier section.

==Failure and deficits==

If an individual experiences impaired or damaged cognitive inhibition abilities, the psychological results can be extremely debilitating. Patients with [[obsessive compulsive disorder]] can experience the effects of reduced cognitive inhibition. "Failures of inhibition were identified in treatment of adults with OCD.&lt;ref name=Rosenberg&gt;{{cite journal | last = Rosenberg | first = D.R. |author2=Dick, E.L. |author3=O'Hearn, K.M. |author4=Sweeney, J.A. | title = Response-inhibition deficits in obsessive-compulsive disorder; an indicator of dysfunction in frontostriatal circuits | journal = Psychiatry Neuroscience | volume = 22  | issue = 1 | pages = 29–38 | year = 1997 | url = http://www.sci.sdsu.edu/classes/psychology/psy860/readings/ocd.pdf | accessdate = March 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Go/No-Go tasks, subjects have to make a simple motor response (such as pressing a button) as quickly as possible when target stimuli are presented, and withhold the motor response when non-target stimuli are presented. Bannon et al. (2002) found that [[OCD]] patients made significantly more commission errors than matched [[panic]] disorder control subjects in a computerized task necessitating the inhibition of responses on a proportion of trials— OCD patients tended to make inappropriate motor responses to non-target stimuli".&lt;ref name=Chamberlain&gt;{{cite journal | last = Chamberlain | first = S.R. |author2=A.D. Blackwell |author3=N.A. Fineberg |author4=T.W. Robbins |author5=B.J. Sahakin | title = The neuropsychology of obsessive compulsive disorder: the importance of failures in cognitive and behavioural inhibition as candidate endophenotypic markers | journal = Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews | volume = 29 | pages = 399–419 | publisher = Elsevier | year = 2005 | url = http://www.sci.sdsu.edu/classes/psychology/psy860/readings/ocd.pdf | accessdate = March 3, 2013 | doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2004.11.006 | pmid=15820546 | issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidently, the cognitive inhibition that OCD patients experience can have such effects as impairing response time to significant stimuli and decreasing the ability to shut out irrelevant stimuli. This may be why OCD responses to certain stimuli can be difficult to control. [[Suicidal behavior]] may also be related to cognitive inhibition impairment.&lt;ref name=Devantoy&gt;{{cite journal | last = Richard-Devantoy | first = S. |author2=F. Jollant |author3=Z.

Nigg]] |author3=Laurie A. Carr |author4=Fernanda Ferreia  | title = Cognitive Inhibition and Working Memory in Attention-Deficient/Hyperactivity Disorder | journal = Journal of Abnormal Psychology | volume = 117 | issue = 3 | pages = 591–605 | year = 2008 | url = http://libra.msra.cn/Publication/5486706/cognitive-inhibition-and-working-memory-in-attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder | accessdate = March 3, 2013 | doi=10.1037/a0012593 | pmid=18729611}}&lt;/ref&gt; This indicates that people diagnosed with ADHD experience an impaired cognitive inhibition ability and find it difficult to suppress irrelevant stimuli. The result is decreased mental representation control and perhaps a degree of [[working memory]] deficit. Finally, there are age-related effects on an individual's ability to execute cognitive inhibition, which mostly include language impairment. "In language production, older adults' increased word-finding deficits have been explained under ''inhibitory deficit theory'' as a consequence of their reduced ability to inhibit irrelevant words (competitors) that impair retrieval of the target".&lt;ref name=Zacks&gt;{{cite journal | last = Zacks | first = R.T. |author2=L. Hasher | title = Directed ignoring: Inhibitory regulation of working memory | journal = Inhibitory processes in attention, memory, and language | pages = 241–264 | publisher = Academic Press | location = San Diego, CA | year = 1994 | url = http://psychsocgerontology.oxfordjournals.org/content/52B/6/P254.full.pdf | accessdate = March 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When speaking, many older adults experience difficulty "finding" the words they want to use, which is evidence of cognitive inhibition skills not functioning properly. Because they are not omitting synonyms or replacements entirely from their working memory (which can be considered irrelevant stimuli), they exhibit similar types of mental representation degradation that patients with [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[ADHD]], or [[OCD]] indicate.

Conceptual combination is an important concept in the fields of [[cognitive psychology]] and [[cognitive science]].

==Mechanism==

The mechanism by which conceptual combination occurs is debatable, both on cognitive and neurological levels. As such, multiple models have been developed or applied to better define how the process occurs.&lt;ref name ="lynott"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lynott | first1 = D. | last2 = Connell | first2 = L. | year = 2010 | title = The effect of prosody on conceptual combination | url = | journal = Cognitive Science | volume = 34 | issue = 6| pages = 1107–1123 | doi = 10.1111/j.1551-6709.2010.01119.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cognitive===

Cognitive models attempt to functionally outline the mental computation involved in conceptual combination. 
  
====Constraint Theory====

Constraint theory stipulates that the concept that results from an attempt at conceptual combination is controlled by three constraints known as diagnosticity, plausibility and informativeness. ''Diagnosticity'' refers to the a complex concept's possession of the defining properties of its component simple concepts. Because such properties are diagnostic of the component concepts, at least some of them should be diagnostic of the higher-order representations constructed from those concepts. ''Plausibility'' refers to consistency with existing knowledge and prior experience. It is based on the assumption that a complex concept should be reasonably relevant to the context in which it is used. This assumption makes the most sense in a practical, linguistic context, particularly when a speaker is catering to the understanding of the listener. ''Informativeness'' is the property of having more meaning or properties than any individual component. If a complex concept were not distinguishable from any given component, it would be identical to that component. Because nothing can logically be both a component of something and the totality of something simultaneously, a complex concept must at least be the sum of its parts. Many argue that the interaction among component concepts should allow a complex concept to be greater than that sum.  If multiple possible ways to structure or interpret a complex concept exist, the one which best satisfies or most satisfies these constraints is the one which will be used. The paradigm upon which constraint theory is based is computational, and therefore views the mind as a processor which operates on the basis of standard problem-solving protocols (i.e. [[algorithms]] and [[heuristics]]).&lt;ref name = ck2000&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Costello | first1 = F. J. | last2 = Keane | first2 = M. T. | year = 2000 | title = Efficient creativity: Constraint-guided conceptual combination | url = | journal = Cognitive Science | volume = 24 | issue = 2| pages = 299–349 | doi = 10.1016/S0364-0213(00)00020-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Spreading Activation====

The [[spreading activation]] model is a model in [[connectionism|connectionist]] theory sometimes designed to represent how concepts are activated in relation to one another. Though it is typically applied to information search processes like recognition, [[brainstorming]], and recall, it can be used to explain how concepts are combined as well as connected.&lt;ref name="bd1988"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Balota | first1 = D. A. | last2 = Duchek | first2 = J. M. | year = 1988 | title = Age-related differences in lexical access, spreading activation, and simple pronunciation | url = | journal = Psychology and Aging | volume = 3 | issue = 1| pages = 84–93 | doi = 10.1037/0882-7974.3.1.84 | pmid = 3268246 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spreading activation models represent memory and knowledge as a network of interlinked concepts. Every concept manifests as a node within this network, with related nodes/concepts linked to one another with connections. Concepts that are more strongly associated with one another either in terms of content or an individual's past experience are correspondingly more strongly linked.&lt;ref name=bd1988 /&gt;

When one concept is employed in [[working memory]], the corresponding node is also activated. This activation spreads through the node's links, making it easier to activate nodes to which the activated node is connected. This spreading activation stimulates the linked nodes, pressuring them to activate to an extent proportional to the strength of the connection between the stimulating node and the stimulated node. If sufficient net stimulation is accrued through a stimulated node's links, it will also activate. Thus, being connected to an activated node makes it easier for an inactive node to become active as well; concepts become more readily accessed when individuals are stimulated with related concepts first. This increase in ease of access is known as "priming.&lt;ref name=bd1988 /&gt;"

Spreading activation models tend to imply that processing concepts occurs in series; that is, each concept is processed one-at-a-time, one after the other. As such, individuals tend to combine concepts more readily, easily, and quickly if they are more closely linked within the network of concepts. This implication, however, has caused spreading activation to come under a great deal of criticism, particularly with respect to how the concept is employed in feature theories.

====Feature-Based Theories====

The features and properties of complex concepts are generally assumed to be derived from the simple concepts that compose them. One popularly discussed model involves a two-stage serial process. In the initial stage, features from each of the component simple concepts are retrieved from memory through spreading activation. This allows a complex concept to accrue features with existing relationships with its component simple concepts. During this stage, the basic definition of what the complex concept is and/or means is generates. In the second stage, knowledge and reasoning are employed upon the features accrued in the previous stage to generate further features.&lt;ref name="spring"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Springer | first1 = K. | last2 = Murphy | first2 = G. L. | year = 1992 | title = Feature availability in conceptual combination | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 3 | issue = 2| pages = 111–117 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.1992.tb00008.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one might reason that the complex concept "white jacket," if worn in a blizzard, would make one difficult to see; it would follow that one should ascribe the property of "good for winter camouflage," despite the fact that this property is not closely attached to the component concepts "white" nor "jacket." This stage is especially useful when properties of complex concepts contradict those of their component concepts, such as the different colours of milk and chocolate milk.

This model, however, has come under criticism due to its inconsistency with empirical studies. If conceptual combination employed serial  spreading activation, for instance, it should take longer to verify the properties of complex concepts, as they necessarily possess more concepts than their component simple concepts. Research has nonetheless shown that it takes less time to confirm complex concepts' properties than their components and about equal time to reject false properties for both. This occurred even when the properties of the complex concept contradicted those of the simple concepts. Likewise, when experiment participants are exposed to a set of features first, and then asked to verify whether or not they correspond to simple or complex concepts, the participants tend to provide correct verification answers for the complex concepts more quickly.&lt;ref name=spring /&gt;

===Neurological===

The neurological basis of conceptual combination has received considerably less attention than its cognitive basis.&lt;ref name = "bo2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baron | first1 = S. G. | last2 = Osherson | first2 = D. | year = 2011 | title = Evidence for conceptual combination in the left anterior temporal lobe | url = | journal = NeuroImage | volume = 55 | issue = 4| pages = 1847–1852 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.01.066 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, research has revealed several specific brain regions that are intimately involved if not entirely responsible for neural processing involved in conceptual combination.&lt;ref name=bo2011 /&gt;

Of particular relevance is the left anterior [[temporal lobe]]. Studies have previously demonstrated an additive effect for stimulation in this subsection of neural cortex tissue. When experiment participants were verbally presented with certain simple concepts, the processing of the information causes electrical stimulation in the region. When the same participants were verbally presented with a single complex concept formed from the combination of the aforementioned simple concepts, the stimulation recorded was equivalent to the sum of the stimulation that resulted from each individual component simple concept. In other words, the stimulation caused by a complex concept is equivalent to the total stimulation caused by its component concepts. More recent data contradicts those results by indicating a multiplicative effect in which the activation caused by a complex concept is the product of the activation levels caused by its component concepts, rather than the sum.&lt;ref name = bo2011 /&gt;

Further support for the role of the left anterior temporal lobe has been previously established through neuropsychological studies. [[Semantic dementia]] is a disorder in which conceptual manipulation, including conceptual combination, is hindered. These indicate that the neural damage associated with semantic dementia occurs within this brain region. Unfortunately, neuropsychological studies that attempt to replicate this pattern have failed, leading uncertainty as to whether initial results were valid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mahon | first1 = B. Z. | last2 = Caramazza | first2 = A. | year = 2009 | title = Concepts and categories: A cognitive neuropsychological perspective | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 60 | issue = | pages = 27–51 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.psych.60.110707.163532 | pmid=18767921 | pmc=2908258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==

As [[language]] is the means by which concepts are communicated and expressed, the processed involved in linguistic expression and interpretation are heavily intertwined with combined concepts. Many theories of concept combination mechanisms, including constraint theory&lt;ref name=ck2000 /&gt; were developed within the context of language, and therefore make more sense when applied in a linguistic context. Study into the linguistic aspects of concept combination as has generally been focused on the interpretation mechanism.

===Lexical Concepts===

A concept that can be expressed using a single word is called a ''lexical concept.'' A lexical concept is usually treated as a basic concept, although it can just as easily be a complex concept.

Two lexical concepts are often used together as phrases to represent a combined concept of greater specificity. This is most readily seen in the use of [[adjective]]s to modify [[noun]]s and the use of [[adverb]]s to modify [[verb]]s and adjectives. Consider, for example, phrases such as "burnt toast," "eat roughly," and "readily loved." Multiple noun lexical concepts can also be used together in order to represent combined concepts.  Through this process, a limited pool of nouns can be used to produce an exponentially larger pool of phrases such as "sound wave," "video game," and "sleeping pill."&lt;ref&gt;Dunbar, G. L. &amp; Myers, T. F. (1988). Concept combination and the characterization of lexical concepts. In W. Hüllen, &amp; R. Schulze (Eds.), (pp. 292-302) Niemeyer. {{DOI|10.1515/9783111355191.292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interpretation===

In addition to constraint theory, there are two principal theories surrounding the mechanism by which noun-noun combinations are [[semantics|interpreted]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lynott | first1 = D. | last2 = Tagalakis | first2 = G. | last3 = Keane | first3 = M. | year = 2004 | title = Conceptual Combination with PUNC | url = | journal = Artificial Intelligence Review | volume = 21 | issue = 3| pages = 353–374 | doi = 10.1007/s10462-004-5219-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these is ''dual-process theory.'' Dual-process theory proposed that there are two means by which people interpreted noun-noun phrases. ''Relational interpretation'' attempts to establish a relationship between the nouns and interprets the combined phrase in terms of that relationship. For example, one might relationally interpret the phrase "snake mouse" to refer to a mouse meant to be eaten by snakes, as the two concepts have a predatory relationship. ''Property interpretation'' identifies properties associated with the first noun and then applies them onto the second noun. In this case the phrase "snake mouse" might be interpreted as a mouse with poisonous fangs or an elongated body.&lt;ref name= wiz1998&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wisniewski | first1 = E.

The second principal theory is known as the ''Competition in Relations among Nominals'' theory. It states that the assumed modification effect of a noun on its partner in a novel noun-noun combination is the one which it has been seen to employ most often in the past. For example, "chocolate cat" is usually interpreted as "a cat made of chocolate" rather than "a chocolate-eating cat" simply because the "made of" modifier is heavily conditioned to be associated with "chocolate.&lt;ref&gt;Gagne, C. L. (2002). The competition-among-relations-in-nominals theory of conceptual combination: Implications for stimulus class formation and class expansion. ''Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior'', 78 (3), 551-65. Retrieved from https://search.proquest.com/docview/214835280&lt;/ref&gt;"

Explanations of linguistic expression of complex concepts have been linked to [[spreading activation]] models. When an individual identifies a lexical concept through vision or hearing, the corresponding node in that individual's cognitive network is said to activate. This makes it easier for lexical concepts linked to the activated concept to be comprehended, as they are primed. This is consistent with current empirical data, which shows that when individuals are interpreting sentences, they process the linguistic content more quickly when several related words follow one another. In turn, it becomes easier for people to combine these related concepts together and understand them as a relationship, rather than two distinct entities.&lt;ref name="ews2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Elvevåg | first1 = B. | last2 = Wisniewski | first2 = E. | last3 = Storms | first3 = G. | year = 2010 | title = Conceptual combination and language in schizophrenia | journal = Schizophrenia Research | volume = 120 | issue = 1–3| pages = 238–239 | doi = 10.1016/j.schres.2010.04.006 | pmid=20452747 | pmc=2900465}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, consider the example, "John spread butter on a bagel." In this sentence, the lexical concepts "spread," "butter," and "bagel" are associated with one another and easy to combine into a mental representation of a breakfast scenario. Conversely, consider the example, "John baked a computer." Because "baked" and "computer" are not related lexical concepts, it takes more effort and time to build a mental representation of this unusual scenario.

However, spreading activation models of conceptual combination have been criticized in light of how humans have been observed to combined languages. Those who claim that the theory provides an insufficient account of linguistic conceptual combination refer to the ability of humans to readily understand lexical concept combinations with seemingly no apparent connection with one another. One example of this would be the sentence "John saw an elephant cloud." "Elephant" and "cloud" do not shared a close association, but it takes little effort to comprehend that the term "elephant cloud" refers to a cloud shaped like an elephant. This has led some to conclude that the combination of lexical concepts does not wholly rely on the simultaneous activation of linked lexical concepts alone. Rather, they claim that the process involves the use of existing nodes to generate entirely new concepts independent of their parent concepts.&lt;ref name="ews2010"/&gt;

====Social Context====

Although many theories of  novel noun-noun combination interpretation ignore the effect of social environment, some theorists have attempted to account for any contingencies social context may cause.

When lexical concept combinations are interpreted without the influence of social context, the interpretation carried out is termed ''sense generation.'' This includes all processes that would normally occur excepting those dependent on a conversation partner. The ''generation hypothesis'' accordingly states that the interpretation mechanism of a noun-noun combination is essentially the same regardless of context. This does not rule out the possibility that social context can affect sense generation in some way, but it does assert that the basic structure of the process is unaffected. As seen above, debate as to what sense generation entails and how many sub-processes into which it should be divided is a contentious matter in cognitive science.&lt;ref name="vlw"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Middleton | first1 = E. L. | last2 = Rawson | first2 = K. A. | last3 = Wisniewski | first3 = E. J. | year = 2011 | title = How do we process novel conceptual combinations in context? | url = | journal = The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology | volume = 64 | issue = 4| pages = 807–822 | doi = 10.1080/17470218.2010.520414 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[anaphor]] resolution hypothesis'' instead asserts that before sense generation occurs, interpreters first search their memory of recent communication to see if the combination refers to something previously discussed. This process is termed ''anaphor resolution'.' If a referent is identified, interpretation occurs without sense generation in light of that referent. Even if an explicit referent does not exist, anaphor resolution can help facilitate sense generation by providing more information that might hint at the combination's intended meaning.&lt;ref name = vlw /&gt;

The ''dual-process hypothesis'' not to be confused with dual-process theory, states that sense generation and anaphor resolution occur in parallel. Both processes begin to work once the noun-noun combination is presented. Proponents of this hypothesis disagree as to how the interpretation is eventually resolves. Some believe that whichever process reaches a conclusion first provides the answer. Others believe that both provide continuous input to a third, mediating process that eventually makes a decision based on input from both.&lt;ref name = vlw /&gt;

==Creativity==

[[Creativity]] necessitates the employment of existing concepts in novel ways, and therefore requires conceptual combination. Surprisingly, this contribution seems to be limited. Conceptual combination is a significant contributor to [[convergent thinking]], but not [[divergent thinking]]. For example, practice with generating new concepts through combination does not improve brainstorming. It does, however, assist in devising creative problem solving methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kohn | first1 = N. W. | last2 = Paulus | first2 = P. B. | last3 = Korde | first3 = R. M. | year = 2011 | title = Conceptual combinations and subsequent creativity | url = | journal = Creativity Research Journal | volume = 23 | issue = 3| pages = 203–210 | doi = 10.1080/10400419.2011.595659 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Educational applications==

The psychological community's growing understanding of how concepts are manipulated has allowed educators to teach new concepts more effectively. Tools that are developed based on conceptual combination theory attempt to teach individual tasks, and then challenge students to exercise them together in order to promote both base subject skills and the critical thinking needed to apply them simultaneously to [[problem solving|solve new problems]]. Máder &amp; Vajda, for instance, developed a three-dimensional grid with cells of adjustable height which has been successfully used in numerous activities capable of improving the effectiveness of high school [[mathematics education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Máder | first1 = A. | last2 = Vajda | first2 = R. | year = 2010 | title = Elementary approaches to the teaching of the combinatorial problem of rectangular islands | url = | journal = International Journal of Computers for Mathematical Learning | volume = 15 | issue = 3| pages = 267–281 | doi = 10.1007/s10758-010-9171-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6631">In botany, the '''correct name''' according to the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]] (ICN) is the one and only [[botanical name]] that is to be used for a particular [[taxon]], when that taxon has a particular [[Circumscription (taxonomy)|circumscription]], position and [[Taxonomic rank|rank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McNeill|Barrie|Buck|Demoulin|2012}}, Glossary&lt;/ref&gt; Determining whether a name is correct is a complex procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Turland, N. |year=2013 |volume=Regnum Vegetabile Volume 155 |title=The Code Decoded: A user's guide to the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants |publisher=Koeltz Scientific Books  |isbn=978-3-87429-433-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name must be '''validly published''', a process which is defined in no less than 16 Articles of the ICN.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McNeill|Barrie|Buck|Demoulin|2012}}, Article 6.2&lt;/ref&gt; It must also be "legitimate", which imposes some further requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McNeill|Barrie|Buck|Demoulin|2012}}, Articles 6.3 and 6.4&lt;/ref&gt; If there are two or more legitimate names for the same taxon (with the same circumscription, position and rank), then the correct name is the one which has [[Priority (nomenclature)|priority]], i.e. it was published earliest,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McNeill|Barrie|Buck|Demoulin|2012}}, Principle III&lt;/ref&gt; although names may be [[Conserved name|conserved]] if they have been very widely used. Validly published names other than the correct name are called [[synonym (botany)|synonym]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McNeill|Barrie|Buck|Demoulin|2012}}, Article 7.2&lt;/ref&gt; Since taxonomists may disagree as to the circumscription, position or rank of a taxon, there can be more than one correct name for a particular plant. These may also be called synonyms.

The correct name has only one correct spelling, which will generally be the original spelling (although certain limited corrections are allowed). Other spellings are called [[orthographical variant (botany)|orthographical variants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McNeill|Barrie|Buck|Demoulin|2012}}, Articles 60-61&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature|zoological]] equivalent of "correct name" is "[[valid name (zoology)|valid name]]".

==Example==
[[Image:Starr 070215-4478 Falcataria moluccana.jpg|thumb|Linnaeus' ''Adenanthera falcataria'' has many other names]]
Different taxonomic placements may well lead to different correct names. For example, the earliest name for the fastest growing tree in the world is ''[[Adenanthera falcataria]]'' [[Linnaeus|L.]] The "L." stands for "Linnaeus" who first validly published the name. ''Adenanthera falcataria'' is thus one of the correct names for this plant. There are other correct names, based on different taxonomic treatments.
* It can be placed in the genus ''[[Albizia]]'', as Fosberg first did. When placed in this genus, the first choice of correct name is the new genus name followed by the earlier species epithet, giving ''Albizia falcataria''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McNeill|Barrie|Buck|Demoulin|2012}}, Article 11.4&lt;/ref&gt; This name cannot be used if there is already a species  in the genus with this epithet, so that an illegitimate duplicate would be created.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McNeill|Barrie|Buck|Demoulin|2012}}, Article 53&lt;/ref&gt; As this is not the case, the correct name for the plant in this genus is ''Albizia falcataria'' (L.) Fosberg. "Fosberg" is the authority for the transfer to the new genus; "L(innaeus)" the authority for the 'base name' ([[basionym]]) from which the new name is derived.
* It can also be placed in the genus ''[[Paraserianthes]]''. Its correct name in that position is ''Paraserianthes falcataria'' (L.) I.C.Nielsen. 
* Within the genus ''Paraserianthes'', it is placed in section ''Falcataria''. If the section is raised in rank to become the genus ''Falcataria'', the correct name cannot be ''Falcataria falcataria'', as might be expected, since under the botanical code (but not the zoological code) names with the same word as both the genus and the specific epithet ([[tautonym]]s) are forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McNeill|Barrie|Buck|Demoulin|2012}}, Article 23.4&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative basionym must be sought or a new name created. The correct name is ''[[Falcataria moluccana]]'' (Miq.) Barneby and J.W.Grimes.

The four names ''Adenanthera falcataria'', ''Albizia falcataria'', ''Paraserianthes falcataria'' and ''Falcataria moluccana'' are each correct, given that the plant is placed in these four genera. Which is the 'right' genus is a problem for taxonomy, not nomenclature. Thus this tree species will have a different correct botanical name for different people.

The '''Crespi effect''' is a [[Behavioral contrast|behavioural contrast]] phenomenon first observed in rats by US [[psychologist]] [[Leo P. Crespi]] in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crespi|first=Leo P.|date=1942|title=Quantitative Variation of Incentive and Performance in the White Rat|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1417120|journal=The American Journal of Psychology|volume=55|issue=4|pages=467–517|doi=10.2307/1417120}}&lt;/ref&gt; He found that in a repeatedly carried out task such as finding food in a maze, the running speed of the rat is proportional to the size of the reward it obtained on the previous trial. The more food reward that was given to it last time upon completion of the task, the faster it will run when attempting to complete the same task. The effect also works in reverse: when rats were shifted from a larger to a smaller reward, they ran more slowly than the control rats that had always received the small reward.

It is important to note that the size of the reward has little or no influence on the speed of [[learning]], but that it does have an influence on the performance of tasks already learned.

The '''Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act''' ('''CISPA''' {{USBill|112|HR|3523}} (112th Congress), {{USBill|113|HR|624}} (113th Congress), {{USBill|114|HR|234}} (114th Congress)) was a proposed law in the United States which would allow for the sharing of Internet traffic information between the U.S. government and technology and manufacturing companies. The stated aim of the bill is to help the U.S. government investigate cyber threats and ensure the security of networks against cyberattacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=HR 3523 as reported to the House Rules Committee | url=http://www.rules.house.gov/Media/file/PDF_112_2/LegislativeText/CPRT-112-HPRT-RU00-HR3523.pdf | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130228035632/http://www.rules.house.gov/Media/file/PDF_112_2/LegislativeText/CPRT-112-HPRT-RU00-HR3523.pdf | archivedate=February 28, 2013 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015 a version of CISPA was hidden in the total federal budget.

CISPA had garnered favor from corporations and lobbying groups such as [[Microsoft]], [[Facebook]], [[AT&amp;T]], [[IBM]], and the [[United States Chamber of Commerce]], which look on it as a simple and effective means of sharing important cyber threat information with the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | title=CISPA: Who’s for it, who’s against it and how it could affect you | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/cispa-whos-for-it-whos-against-it-and-how-it-could-affect-you/2012/04/27/gIQA5ur0lT_story.html | author=Hayley Tsukayama | newspaper=[[Washington Post]] | date=April 27, 2012 | accessdate=May 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has however been criticized by advocates of [[Internet privacy]] and [[civil liberties]], such as the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], [[Free Press (organization)|Free Press]], [[Fight for the Future]], and [[Avaaz.org]], as well as various [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] and [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] groups including the [[Competitive Enterprise Institute]], TechFreedom, [[FreedomWorks]], [[Americans for Limited Government]], [[Liberty Coalition]], and the [[American Conservative Union]]. Those groups argue CISPA contains too few limits on how and when the government may monitor a private individual’s Internet browsing information.

==Content==
CISPA is an amendment to the [[National Security Act of 1947]], which does not currently contain provisions pertaining to cybercrime. It adds provisions to the Act describing cyber threat intelligence as "information in the possession of an element of the intelligence community directly pertaining to a vulnerability of, or threat to, a system or network of a government or private entity, including information pertaining to the protection of a system or network from either "efforts to degrade, disrupt, or destroy such system or network".&lt;ref&gt;[http://intelligence.house.gov/sites/intelligence.house.gov/files/documents/CyberBillDiscussion113011.pdf H.R. 3523 Discussion Draft] - U.S. House of Representatives - November 29, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, CISPA requires the Director of National Intelligence to establish procedures to allow [[United States Intelligence Community|intelligence community]] elements to share cyber threat intelligence with private-sector entities and encourage the sharing of such intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=CRS report on CISPA | url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:HR03523:@@@D&amp;summ2=m&amp; | publisher=Congressional Research Service | accessdate=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kominsky|first=Mitchell|date=February 2014|title=The Current Landscape of Cybersecurity Policy: Legislative Issues in the 113th Congress|url=http://harvardnsj.org/2014/02/the-current-landscape-of-cybersecurity-policy-legislative-issues-in-the-113th-congress/|journal=Harvard Law School National Security Journal|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an April 16, 2012, press release, the [[United States House Select Committee on Intelligence|House of Representatives Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]] announced the approval of several amendments to CISPA, including the addition of a new provision "to permit federal lawsuits against the government for any violation of restrictions placed on the government’s use of voluntarily shared information, including the important privacy and civil liberties protections contained in the bill," the inclusion of an anti-tasking provision to "explicitly prohibit the government from conditioning its sharing of cyber threat intelligence on the sharing of private sector information with the government", and the prevention of the government from using the information for "any other lawful purpose unless the government already has a significant cybersecurity or national security purpose in using the information". Relevant provisions were also clarified to "focus on the fact that the bill is designed to protect against unauthorized access to networks or systems, including unauthorized access aimed at stealing private or government information".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Discussion Draft HR 3523 | url=http://intelligence.house.gov/press-release/bill-status-update-hr-3523 | publisher=[[United States House Select Committee on Intelligence]] | accessdate=April 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, already collected cyberthreat data can also be used to investigate "the imminent threat of bodily harm to an individual" or "the exploitation of a minor," bringing the bill into line with existing law codified by the [[Patriot Act]] and the PROTECT Our Children Act&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/110/s1738|title=PROTECT Our Children Act of 2008 (2008; 110th Congress S. 1738) - GovTrack.us|work=GovTrack.us}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which these two conditions already allow for protected entities to share data voluntarily with the United States government, law enforcement agencies, and the [[National Center for Missing and Exploited Children]].

==Recent developments==
Bill sponsors [[Mike Rogers (Michigan politician)|Mike Rogers]] and [[Dutch Ruppersberger]], the chairman and ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, respectively, said on April 25, 2012, that the Obama administration's opposition is mostly based on the lack of critical infrastructure regulation, something outside of the jurisdiction of the Intelligence committee; they have also since introduced a package of amendments to the legislation that, "address nearly every single one of the criticisms leveled by the Administration, particularly those regarding privacy and civil liberties of Americans".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Albanesius | first=Chloe | title=White House Threatens to Veto CISPA | url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2403549,00.asp | publisher=PC Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the opposition the bill has experienced, the co-sponsors are planning to amend the bill to address many of the concerns of its opponents—including limiting its scope to a narrower definition of cyber-threats, and stating that the "theft of intellectual property" refers to the theft of [[research and development]]. In addition, there will now be penalties if private companies or the government uses data from CISPA for purposes "unrelated to cyberthreats".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitaltrends.com/web/new-cispa-amendments-expected-but-the-fight-will-go-on/ New CISPA amendments expected - but the fight will go on] - Digitaltrends.com - April 10, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitaltrends.com/web/cispa-and-sopa-like-apples-and-oranges-say-chief-co-sponsors/ CISPA and SOPA like 'apples and oranges,' say chief co-sponsors] - Digitaltrends.com - April 10, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Sharan Bradford Franklin, of the [[Constitution Project]] states, "Although we appreciate the Intelligence Committee's efforts to improve the bill and willingness to engage in a dialogue with privacy advocates, the changes in its most current draft do not come close to addressing the civil liberties threats posed by the bill, and some of the proposals would actually make CISPA worse. Therefore, Congress should not pass CISPA".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.usnews.com/debate-club/should-the-congress-pass-cispa/cispa-lacks-protections-for-individual-rights | title=CISPA Lacks Protections for Individual Rights | publisher=USNews  | accessdate=April 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rainey Reitman, of the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] states, "To date, the authors of the bill have been unresponsive to these criticisms, offering amendments that are largely cosmetic. Dismissing the grave concerns about how this bill could undermine the core privacy rights of everyday Internet users, Rep. Mike Rogers characterized the growing protests against CISPA as 'turbulence' and vowed to push for a floor vote without radical changes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.usnews.com/debate-club/should-the-congress-pass-cispa/cispa-is-dangerously-vague | title=CISPA Is Dangerously Vague | publisher=USNews  | accessdate=April 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kendall Burman of the [[Center for Democracy and Technology]] states, "The authors of CISPA have made some positive changes recently. Unfortunately, none of the changes gets to the heart of the privacy concerns that Internet users and advocacy groups have expressed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.usnews.com/debate-club/should-the-congress-pass-cispa/cispa-not-the-right-way-to-achieve-cybersecurity | title=CISPA Not the Right Way to Achieve Cybersecurity | publisher=USNews  | accessdate=April 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2012, the [[Office of Management and Budget]] of the Executive Office of the President of the United States released a statement strongly opposing the current bill and recommending to veto it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/legislative/sap/112/saphr3523r_20120425.pdf Statement of Administration Policy - H.R. 3523 - Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act] - Office of Management and Budget, April 25, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 26, 2012, the House of Representatives passed CISPA.

On February 13, 2013, United States Representative Mike Rogers reintroduced the CISPA bill in the 113th Congress as H.R. 624.&lt;ref name=CISPA-reintroduced/&gt;

On April 18, 2013, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 624.&lt;ref name=Final-Vote-Results/&gt; The Senate has reportedly refused to vote on the measure and is drafting competing legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Smith | first=Gerry | title=Senate Won't Vote On CISPA, Deals Blow To Controversial Cyber Bill | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/25/cispa-cyber-bill_n_3158221.html | accessdate=April 29, 2013 | newspaper=[[The Huffington Post]] | date=April 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1250">'''Departure resistance''' is a quality of an [[aircraft]] which enables it to remain in controlled flight and resist entering potentially dangerous less-controlled maneuvers such as [[spin (flight)|spin]].

Depending on its design, an aircraft may be more or less likely to leave (depart from) controlled flight when the [[aircraft pilot|pilot]] applies extreme control inputs. Good departure resistance characteristics allow the pilot to remain in control of the aircraft in such situations.

Departure resistance is considered to contribute more towards flight safety than ''departure recovery''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peter2000.co.uk/aviation/misc/3-105960-Cirrusstall-spinreport.pdf Cirrus Design SR 20 Equivalent of safety for Spin requirement]&lt;/ref&gt; Departure recovery is the ability of an aircraft to return to controlled flight once in a certain uncontrolled maneuver. Being able to [[Spin_(flight)#Entry and recovery|recover from spin]] is an example of departure recovery.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6886">In [[systems analysis]], '''Diakoptics''' (Greek ''dia''&amp;ndash;through + ''kopto''&amp;ndash;cut,tear) or the "Method of Tearing" involves breaking a (usually physical) [[problem]] down into subproblems which can be solved independently before being joined back together to obtain an ''exact'' solution to the whole problem. The term was introduced by [[Gabriel Kron]] in a series "Diakoptics — The Piecewise Solution of Large-Scale Systems" published in [[London, England]] by ''The Electrical Journal'' between June 7, 1957 and February 1959. The twenty-one installments were collected and published as a [[book]] of the same title in 1963. The term ''diakoptics'' was coined by Philip Stanley of the [[Union College]] Department of Philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Kron 1963 p 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
According to Kron, "Diakoptics, or the Method of Tearing, is a combined theory of a pair of storehouses of information, namely equations+graph, or matrices+graph, associated with a given physical or economic system.".&lt;ref&gt;Kron 1963 p 1&lt;/ref&gt; What Kron was saying here is that in order to carry out the Method of Tearing, not only were the system equations needed, but also the topology of the system.

Diakoptics was explained in terms of [[algebraic topology]] by J. Paul Roth.&lt;ref&gt;J.P. Roth (1959) "An application of algebraic topology to numerical analysis: On the existence of a solution to the network problem", [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]] 41(7):518&amp;ndash;21 {{MathSciNet|id=0074094}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.P. Roth (1959) "The validity of Kron’s method of tearing", ''PNAS'' 41(8):599&amp;ndash;600 {{MathSciNet|id=0074095}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul J. Roth (1959) "An application of algebraic topology: Kron’s method of tearing", ''Quarterly of Applied Mathematics'' 17:1&amp;ndash;24&lt;/ref&gt;
Roth describes how [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws]] in an [[electrical network]] with a given [[impedance matrix]] or [[admittance matrix]] can be solved for currents and voltages by using the [[topology (electrical circuits)|circuit topology]]. Roth translates Kron’s "orthogonality conditions" into [[exact sequence]]s of homology or cohomology. Roth’s interpretation is confirmed by [[Raoul Bott]] in reports in [[Mathematical Reviews]]. Roth says, "tearing consists essentially in deducing from the solution of one (easier to solve) network K&lt;sup&gt;~&lt;/sup&gt; the solution of a network K having the same number of branches as K&lt;sup&gt;~&lt;/sup&gt;  and having the same isomorphism L between the groups of 1-chains and 1-cochains."
 
Diakoptics can be seen applied for instance in the text ''Solution of Large Networks by Matrix Methods''.&lt;ref&gt;Homer E. Brown (1974, 1985) ''Solution of Large Networks by Matrix Methods'', [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] {{ISBN|0-471-80074-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diakoptics is peculiar as a decomposition method, in that it involves taking values on the "intersection layer" (the boundary between subsystems) into account. The method has been rediscovered by the parallel processing community under the name "[[Domain decomposition methods|Domain Decomposition]]".&lt;ref&gt;Lai C. H. (1994) "Diakoptics, Domain Decomposition and Parallel Computing",  [[The Computer Journal]], Vol 37, No 10, pp.&amp;nbsp;840–846&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Keith Bowden, "Kron was undoubtedly searching for an ontology of engineering".&lt;ref&gt;K. Bowden (1998) "Physical computation and parallelism (constructive postmodern physics)", [[International Journal of General Systems]] 27(1–3):93–103&lt;/ref&gt; Bowden also described "a multilevel hierarchical version of the method, in which the subsystems are recursively torn into subsubsystems".&lt;ref&gt;K. Bowden (1991) "Hierarchical Tearing: An Efficient Holographic Algorithm for System Decomposition", ''International Journal of General Systems'' 24(1), pp 23–38&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[parallel computing]] was provided by the [[transputer]], Keith Bowden described how diakoptics might be applied.&lt;ref&gt;K. Bowden (1990) "Kron's Method of Tearing on a Transputer Array", ''The Computer Journal'' 33(5):453–459&lt;/ref&gt; It is an ongoing open question how the parallelism of Quantum Computing may be relevant.

==Japan==
In 1951 "a group of about twenty scientists and engineers was organized in Japan for the unifying study of basic problems in engineering sciences by means of geometry….reorganized in 1954 into a new organization called the Research Association of Applied Geometry (RAAG)."&lt;ref&gt;Kazuo Kondo (1973) "An Oriental Expansion of Kron’s Science beyond Electrical Engineering", pp 153&amp;ndash;64 in ''Gabriel Kron and Systems Theory'', H.H. Happ editor, Union College Press {{oclc|613720}} {{ISBN|978-0-912156-02-6}}, see p 154&lt;/ref&gt;

"Kron was...the first charter member from overseas. He remained an Honorary Member until he passed away. Meanwhile, the RAAG membership roll has been increased to two hundred and fifty, distributed throughout the world."&lt;ref&gt;Kondo 1973 p 159&lt;/ref&gt;
Many articles on diakoptics, by Kron and others, were published in the ''Memoirs'' of RAAG.

The journal ''Tensor'' ({{ISSN|0040-3504}}), published in [[Sapporo, Japan]], placed Kron on its "honorary editorial board" in 1951. He contributed an article to the March 1955 issue.

==United Kingdom==
"Kron’s influence extends far beyond the U.S.A. The Tensor Society of Great Britain came into being to further the understanding and applications of tensor analysis."&lt;ref&gt;Happ 1973 p 3&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950 it was founded by S. Austen Stigant&lt;ref&gt;Kron 1963 p xvii&lt;/ref&gt; as The Tensor Club of Great Britain, and began publishing ''Matrix and Tensor Quarterly'' ({{ISSN|0025-5998}}). According to Kron, it was S. Austen Stigant that first suggested Kron write his serial "Diakoptics" for the ''Electrical Journal''. In September 1961 the Club became a Society. In 1968 (volume 19) the ''Quarterly'' published a commemorative issue to note the death of Gabriel Kron. The ''Quarterly'' continued publishing until 1987.

"C.H. Flurscheim and J.R. Mortlock of Associated Electrical Industries Ltd. [encouraged] the Power Systems Engineering Department of that company to investigate the applications of Diakoptics to the solution of practical load-flow problems and some difficult mechanical vibration problems; investigations which yielded results of considerable value."&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Brameller &amp; D. W. Mortifee (1973) "The influence of Gabriel Kron in the United Kingdom", pp 143 to 151 in ''Gabriel Kron and Systems Theory''&lt;/ref&gt;

:''This article describes the ''distribution function'' as used in physics. You may be looking for the related mathematical concepts of [[cumulative distribution function]] or [[probability density function]].''

In molecular [[kinetic theory of gases|kinetic theory]] in [[physics]], a particle's '''distribution function''' is a function of seven variables, &lt;math&gt;f(x,y,z,t;v_x,v_y,v_z)&lt;/math&gt;, which gives the number of particles per unit volume in single-particle [[phase space]].  It is the number of particles per unit volume having approximately the [[velocity]] &lt;math&gt;(v_x,v_y,v_z)&lt;/math&gt; near the place &lt;math&gt;(x,y,z)&lt;/math&gt; and time &lt;math&gt;(t)&lt;/math&gt;.  The usual normalization of the distribution function is

:&lt;math&gt;n(x,y,z,t) = \int f \,dv_x \,dv_y \,dv_z,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;N(t) = \int n \,dx \,dy \,dz, &lt;/math&gt;

where, ''N'' is the total number of particles, and ''n'' is the [[number density]] of particles – the number of particles per unit volume, or the [[density]] divided by the mass of individual particles.

A distribution function may be specialised with respect to a particular set of dimensions. E.g. take the quantum mechanical six-dimensional phase space, &lt;math&gt;f(x,y,z;p_x,p_y,p_z)&lt;/math&gt; and multiply by the total space volume, to give the momentum distribution, i.e. the number of particles in the momentum phase space having approximately the [[momentum]] &lt;math&gt;(p_x,p_y,p_z)&lt;/math&gt;.

Particle distribution functions are often used in [[plasma physics]] to describe wave–particle interactions and velocity-space instabilities.  Distribution functions are also used in [[fluid mechanics]], [[statistical mechanics]] and [[nuclear physics]].

The [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution|basic distribution function]] uses the [[Boltzmann constant]] &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and temperature &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; with the number density to modify the [[normal distribution]]:

:&lt;math&gt; f = n\left(\frac{m}{2 \pi  kT}\right)^{3/2} \exp\left({-\frac{m(v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2)}{2kT}}\right). &lt;/math&gt;

Related distribution functions may allow bulk fluid flow, in which case the velocity origin is shifted, so that the [[exponent]]'s [[numerator]] is &lt;math&gt;m((v_x - u_x)^2 + (v_y - u_y)^2 + (v_z - u_z)^2)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;(u_x, u_y, u_z)&lt;/math&gt; is the bulk velocity of the fluid.  Distribution functions may also feature non-isotropic temperatures, in which each term in the exponent is divided by a different temperature.

Plasma theories such as [[magnetohydrodynamics]] may assume the particles to be in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]].  In this case, the distribution function is ''[[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution|Maxwellian]]''.  This distribution function allows fluid flow and different temperatures in the directions parallel to, and perpendicular to, the local magnetic field.  More complex distribution functions may also be used, since [[Plasma (physics)|plasmas]] are rarely in thermal equilibrium.

The mathematical analog of a distribution is a [[measure (mathematics)|measure]]; the time evolution of a measure on a phase space is the topic of study in [[dynamical systems]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6313">The "'''drifty gene hypothesis'''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Speakman J.R. | year = 2008 | title = Thrifty genes for obesity and diabetes, an attractive but flawed idea and an alternative scenario: the 'drifty gene' hypothesis | url = | journal = International Journal of Obesity | volume = 32 | issue = | pages = 1611–1617 | doi=10.1038/ijo.2008.161 | pmid=18852699}}&lt;/ref&gt; was proposed by the British biologist [[John Speakman]] as an alternative to the [[thrifty gene hypothesis]] originally proposed by James V Neel in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Neel JV |title=Diabetes mellitus: a "thrifty" genotype rendered detrimental by "progress"? |journal=Am. J. Hum. Genet. |volume=14 |issue= |pages=353–62 |year=1962 |pmid=13937884 |doi= |pmc=1932342}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speakman's critique of the thrifty gene hypothesis is based on an analysis of the pattern and level of mortality during [[famine]]s. Despite much anecdotal evidence used to suggest that famines cause substantial mortality, Speakman suggests that where real data are available famines actually involve rather low levels of mortality and there is no evidence that fat people survive famines better than lean people. In fact mortality actually falls mostly on groups such as the very young and very old where differential mortality in relation to body composition is highly unlikely.&lt;ref&gt;Speakman, J.R. (2006) The genetics of obesity: five fundamental problems with the famine hypothesis.

CELL metabolism 6: 5-11&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, there is some confusion among proponents of the thrifty gene hypothesis about how long famines have played a role in evolution. On the one hand some proponents suggest famines have been an "ever present" threat dating back to the dawn of [[Australopithecine]]s about 4–6 million years ago, while others indicate that famines may actually only have been important since the [[History of agriculture|invention of agriculture]], because crop failures would exert devastating effects on our ancestors. Speakman argues that either scenario poses difficulties. If we have been under intense selection for the past 6 million years then simple calculations of the spread of favorable alelles under positive selection, known since the 1920s, indicate that we should all be obese and diabetic, which we clearly are not{{original research?|date=May 2018}}. However, if selection has only been acting for the past 15,000 years then there has been insufficient time for thrifty genes to spread at all.{{Dubious|date=May 2018}}

It is argued instead that the modern distribution of the obese phenotype likely comes about because of [[genetic drift]] in the genes encoding the regulation system controlling an upper limit on our body fatness. Hence the name "drifty" genes, to contrast the positively selected "thrifty genes". Such drift may have started because around 2 million years ago when ancestral humans effectively removed the risk of [[predation]], which was probably a key factor maintaining the upper boundary of the regulation system.

The drifty gene hypothesis was presented as part of a presidential debate at the 2007 Obesity Society meeting in New Orleans, with the counter-arguments favoring the thrifty gene hypothesis presented by British nutritionist Andrew Prentice. The main thrust of Prentice's argument against the drifty gene idea is that Speakman's critique of the thrifty gene hypothesis ignores the huge impact that famines have on fertility. It is argued by Prentice that while famine may actually have only been a force driving evolution of thrifty genes for the past 15,000 years or so, because famines exert effects on both survival and fertility the selection pressure may have been sufficient even over such a short timescale to generate the current phenotype distribution of BMI. This critique was published back to back with the original 'drifty gene' paper in the International Journal of Obesity in November 2008.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Prentice AM, Hennig BJ, Fulford AJ.  Evolutionary origins of the obesity epidemic: natural selection of thrifty genes or genetic drift following predation release? Int J Obes (Lond). 32: 1606-1610&lt;/ref&gt;

Prentice et al&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; predicted that the emerging molecular genetics field would ultimately provide a way to test between the adaptive 'thrifty gene' idea and the non-adaptive 'drifty gene' idea because it would be possible to find signatures of positive selection in the human genome, at genes that are linked to both obesity and type 2 diabetes, if the 'thrifty gene' hypothesis is correct. Two comprehensive studies have been performed seeking such signatures of selection. Ayub et al (2015)&lt;ref name="Ayub et al 2014"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Ayub et al|title=Revisiting the Thrifty Gene Hypothesis via 65 Loci Associated with Susceptibility to Type 2 Diabetes |journal=Am J Hum Genet |volume=94 |issue=2 |pages=176–185 |date=2014  |doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2013.12.010 |pmid=24412096 |pmc=3928649}}&lt;/ref&gt; searched for signatures of positive selection at 65 genes linked to type 2 diabetes, and Wang and Speakman (2016)&lt;ref name="Wang and Speakman 2016"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Wang, G and Speakman, J.R. |title=Analysis of Positive Selection at Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms Associated with Body Mass Index Does Not Support the "Thrifty Gene" Hypothesis |journal=Cell Metab |volume=24 |pages=1–11 |date=2016 |doi=10.1016/j.cmet.2016.08.014}}&lt;/ref&gt; searched for signatures of selection at 115 genes linked to obesity. In both cases there was no evidence for such selection signatures at a higher rate than in random genes selected for matched GC content and recombination rate. These two papers provide strong evidence against the thrifty gene idea, and indeed against any adapative explanation which relies on selection during our recent evolutionary history, but instead provide strong support the 'drifty gene' interpretation.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The '''fair trade debate''' is a debate around alleged issues with the [[Fairtrade]] brand. The debate surrounds the ethics and alleged economic implications of [[fair trade]]. Some criticisms have been raised about fair trade systems. One 2015 study in a journal published by the [[MIT Press]] concluded that producer benefits were close to zero because there was an oversupply of certification, and only a fraction of produce classified as Fair Trade was actually sold on Fair Trade markets, just enough to recoup the costs of certification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Janvry|first1=Alain|last2=McIntosh|first2=Craig|last3=Sadoulet|first3=Elisabeth|title=Fair Trade and Free Entry: Can a Disequilibrium Market Serve as a Development Tool?|journal=The Review of Economics and Statistics|date=July 2015|volume=97|issue=3|pages=567–573|doi=10.1162/REST_a_00512|url=http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/REST_a_00512|accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some research indicates that the implementation of certain fair trade standards can cause greater inequalities in some markets where these rigid rules are inappropriate for the specific market.&lt;ref&gt;Booth, P. and L.

== Ethical basis of criticisms==

Although there is evidence to suggest that consumers buy fair trade goods for a variety of reasons, some are willing to pay more for Fairtrade certified products – for example, in the belief that this helps the very poor.&lt;ref&gt;See for example Niemi, N. (2010). "Empowering Coffee Traders? The Coffee Value Chain from Nicaraguan Fair Trade Farmers to Finnish Consumers." Journal of Business Ethics , 97:257-270; Trudel, R., &amp; Cotte, J. (2009).

A revealed preference analysis of Fair Trade coffee purchases. Canadian Journal of Agricultural Economics , 54: 555–565.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of the [[Fairtrade]] brand have argued against the system on an ethical basis, stating that the system diverts profits from the poorest farmers, and that the profit is received by corporate firms. It has been argued that this causes "death and destitution".&lt;ref name=Griffiths&gt;{{cite journal|author=Griffiths, P.|title=Ethical objections to Fairtrade|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|volume=105|issue=3|pages=357|date=July 2011|doi=10.1007/s10551-011-0972-0|url=http://www.griffithsspeaker.com/Fairtrade/Ethical%20Objections%20to%20Fairtrade%20web.pdf|publisher=www.springerlink.com}} Accessed at [http://www.griffithsspeaker.com/Fairtrade/why_fair_trade_isn.htm Why Fairtrade isn't fair].&lt;/ref&gt; This has been used as evidence to doubt that much of the extra money paid reaches farmers, and that there is reason to believe that Fairtrade harms non-Fairtrade farmers. There are criticisms that false claims made for fair trade and the withholding of relevant information constitute Unfair Trading under EU law. There are also criticisms using many other criteria.&lt;ref name=Many&gt;Booth, Philip "Don't bully the faithful into buying Fairtrade", The Catholic Herald, 20 February 2009; Booth, P. and L.

However, pro-Fairtrade researcher Alastair Smith claims that while some of these criticisms are grounded in acceptable standards of evidence (and deserve serious attention), others are less well elaborated, and that&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Alastair|title=A Response to the Adam Smith Report &amp; A New Way to Think About Measuring the Content of the Fair Trade Cup Alastair|journal=Comment and Analysis|year=2008|url=http://www.brass.cf.ac.uk/uploads/TheFairTradeCupResponsetoAdamSmithD9_1.pdf|accessdate=2012-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a few cases, the criticisms presented are assertions with little or no credible evidence to support them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Alastair|title=Fair Trade, Diversification and Structural Change: Towards a broader theoretical framework of analysis|journal=Oxford Development Studies|year=2008|volume=37|issue=4|pages=457–478|url=http://orca.cf.ac.uk/6918/|doi=10.1080/13600810903305208}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these claims have themselves been criticized on matters of fact, theory, methodology, use of evidence and incorrect citations.&lt;ref name=Rigour/&gt;{{rp|45–49}}&lt;ref name=Rejoinder&gt;Griffiths, P.: 2011, [http://www.griffithsspeaker.com/Fairtrade/why_fair_trade_isn.htm "Rejoinder: False Statements, Misrepresentation and Distortion in Defending Fairtrade"], Economic Affairs, 103–4.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==What happens to the money==

=== Little money reaches the developing world ===

The evidence available suggests that little of the extra money paid by consumers actually reaches the farmers. [[The Fairtrade Foundation]] does not monitor how much more money retailers charge for Fairtrade goods. Furthermore, retailers almost never sell identical Fairtrade and non-Fairtrade lines side by side, so it is rarely possible to determine how much extra is charged or how much reaches the producers in spite of Unfair Trading legislation.&lt;ref name=Directive&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32005L0029:EN:HTML Directive 2005/29/EC on Unfair Commercial Practices]&lt;/ref&gt;   In a very few cases, it has been possible to find out. One British café chain was passing less than one percent of the extra charged to the exporting cooperative;&lt;ref name=Griffiths/&gt; in Finland, Valkila, Haaparanta and Niemi&lt;ref&gt;Valkila, J., Haaparanta, P., &amp; Niemi, N. (2010). “Empowering Coffee Traders? The Coffee Value Chain from Nicaraguan Fair Trade Farmers to Finnish Consumers.” Journal of Business Ethics, 97:257-270.&lt;/ref&gt;  found that consumers paid much more for Fairtrade, and that only 11.5% of that reached the exporter. Kilian, Jones, Pratt and Villalobos&lt;ref&gt;Kilian, B., Jones, C., Pratt, L., &amp; Villalobos, A. (2006). “Is Sustainable Agriculture a Viable Strategy to Improve Farm Income in Central America? A Case Study on Coffee”. Journal of Business Research, 59(3), 322–330.&lt;/ref&gt; talk of US Fairtrade coffee getting $5 per lb extra at retail, of which the exporter would have received only 2%. Mendoza and Bastiaensen&lt;ref&gt;Mendoza, R., &amp; J. Bastiaensen, J. (2003). "Fair Trade and the Coffee Crisis in the Nicaraguan Segovias." Small Enterprise Development, 14(2), 36–46.&lt;/ref&gt; calculated that in the UK only 1.6% to 18% of the extra charged for one product line reached the farmer. Critics claim that many counter-examples would be needed to show that these are not typical. Since Fairtrade charges a 1.9% licensing fee at wholesale, the maximum that reaches the developing world, even if traders charge unrealistically low margins, is 50%, and a much smaller amount would reach the target farmers.

=== Less money reaches farmers===

The Fairtrade Foundation does not monitor how much of the extra money paid to the exporting cooperatives reaches the farmer. The cooperatives incur certification and inspection fees, additional marketing costs, costs in meeting the Fairtrade political standards, and possibly costs arising from the monopoly power of the cooperative. Farmers also incur additional production costs on all of their production, even if only a small amount is sold at Fairtrade prices. Over the years, Fairtrade producers have only been able to sell 18% to 37% of their output as Fairtrade certified, selling the rest without certification at world prices.  While both proponents and opponents of Fairtrade acknowledge this problem,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Utting-Chamorro, K (2005). Does Fairtrade make a difference? The case of small coffee producers in Nicaragua. Development in Practice, Volume 15, Numbers 3 and 4, June 2005, Berndt, C. E. (2007). Is Fair Trade in coffee production fair and useful? Evidence from Costa Rica and Guatemala and implications for policy. Washington DC.: Mercatus 65 Policy Series, Policy Comment 11, Mercatus Centre, George Mason University.&lt;/ref&gt; there are scarce economic studies presenting the actual revenues of Fairtrade cooperatives and how they spend their money. Weber (2006) examined the additional marketing costs of some cooperatives and found, for example, that '.  .  . after six years Oro Verde can cover only 70 percent of its [additional marketing] costs with its current income stream' and that the cooperative needs to double its current annual export volume in order to sustain its management team. At the time they were losing money on their Fairtrade membership.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, J. (2006). Rationing in the Fair Trade Coffee Market: Who enters and How? International colloquium on fair trade and sustainable development. Montreal: Ecole des Sciences de la Gestion, Universite du Quebec.&lt;/ref&gt; FLO figures&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International.: 2010, [http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/resources/FLO_Annual-Report-2009_komplett_double_web.pdf Annual Report 2009-2010]. Retrieved May 27, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; show that 40% of the money reaching the developing world is spent on 'business and production', which includes the costs mentioned above as well as costs incurred by any inefficiency and corruption in the cooperative or the marketing system. The rest is spent on social projects, rather than being passed on to farmers.

There is no evidence that Fairtrade farmers get higher prices on average {{citation needed|date=February 2016}}. Some anecdotes state farmers are paid more by traders than by Fairtrade cooperatives and some state that they were paid less. Few of these anecdotes address the problems of price reporting in developing world markets,&lt;ref&gt;See Bowbrick, P, "Are price reporting systems of any use?", British Food Journal. 90(2) 65-69 March/April. 1988. Current international research on Third World market information systems is given at http://www.sim2g.org/.&lt;/ref&gt; and few appreciate the complexity of different price packages. A different price package may or may not include credit, harvesting, transport, processing, etc. Cooperatives typically average prices over the year, so they may pay more or less than traders, depending on the day. Bassett (2009) &lt;ref&gt;Bassett, T. (2009). Slim pickings: Fairtrade cotton in West Africa. Geoforum.&lt;/ref&gt; is able to compare prices only where Fairtrade and non-Fairtrade farmers have to sell cotton to the same [[Monopsony|monopsonistic]] ginneries, which pay low prices. Prices would have to be higher to compensate farmers for the increased costs of producing Fairtrade. For instance, when Fairtrade encouraged Nicaraguan farmers to switch to organic coffee, they earned a higher price per pound but a lower net income because of higher costs and lower yields.&lt;ref&gt;Kilian, B., Jones, C., Pratt, L., &amp; Villalobos, A. (2006). “Is Sustainable Agriculture a Viable Strategy to Improve Farm Income in Central America? A Case Study on Coffee”. Journal of Business Research, 59(3), 322–330.; Valkila, J. (2009). Fair Trade organic coffee production in Nicaragua - Sustainable development or a poverty trap? Ecological Economics, 68 3018-3025; Wilson, B. R. (2009). Indebted to Fair Trade? Coffee and Crisis in Nicaragua. Geoforum.&lt;/ref&gt; The claim that Fairtrade guarantees a 'fair price' for the producer is not supported by the evidence and although it is possible that Fair Trade may do so on occasions, there is no reason to believe that this is normal.

=== Lack of evidence of impact===
Some critics argue that there have been very few fair trade impact studies. Griffiths (2011)&lt;ref name=Griffiths/&gt; says that very few of the attempts made meet the normal standards for an [[impact evaluation]], such as comparing the before and after situation, having meaningful control groups, allowing for the fact that Fairtrade recruits farmers who are already better off, allowing for the fact that a Fairtrade cooperative receives aid from a dozen other organizations – government departments, aid agencies, donor countries, and NGOs, and allowing for the fact that Fairtrade may harm other farmers. Other serious methodological problems arise in sampling, in comparing prices, and from the fact that the social projects of Fairtrade do not usually aim to produce economic benefits.

Indeed, due to the snapshot nature of research, few studies include how long producers have been involved with fair trade. A further significant problem is that most studies ignore the agency and perspective of producer decision makers, especially the farmers excluded from the Fairtrade system. Capturing such socially constructed benefit, including that of confidence in business relationships, is notoriously difficult to capture in social science research.

An important distinction when discussing Fairtrade is the difference between impact studies and case studies.&lt;ref name=Rigour/&gt;{{rp|40–96}} Case studies are valuable for, among other things, researching specific systems and sub-systems, for constructing models, and for identifying problems. However, the impacts noted cannot be extrapolated generally. For instance, if a hundred dairy farms lose money, this does not mean that all or most dairy farms do. There are a lot of case studies on Fairtrade, but many are erroneously referred to as impact studies.

An unpublished consultancy report prepared for Fairtrade&lt;ref&gt;
Nelson, V., &amp; Pound, B.: 2009, [http://www.fairtrade.org.uk/resources/natural_resources_institute.aspx The Last Ten Years: A Comprehensive Review of the Literature on the Impact of Fairtrade"].&lt;/ref&gt; claims to have found only 33 studies that met their criteria for impact studies (which accept studies that would not be acceptable to the World Bank etc.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Angelucci, M., &amp; Di Maro, V. (2010). Project Evaluation and Spillover Effects. Impact Evaluation Guidelines. Washington, DC: Strategy Development Division, Technical Notes No. IDB-TN-136 (Inter-American Development Bank). Accessed at the [http://www-personal.umich.edu/ U-M Personal World Wide Web server];  Clemens, M. A., &amp; Demombynes, G. (2010). When Does Rigorous Impact Evaluation Make a Difference?

Introduction to the Special Feature: Evaluating the Impact of Agricultural Projects in Developing Countries. Journal of Agricultural Economics , vol. 62, no. 2, 393–402 {{doi|10.1111/j.1477-9552.2011.00296.x}}; Winters, P., Salazar, L., &amp; Maffioli, A. (2010).

These included unpublished undergraduate and masters' dissertations, unpublished theses, journalistic articles by employees or members of Fairtrade cooperatives, several reports on the same cooperatives, and one report cited under two different titles. Griffiths (2011) claims that most of these reports had significant methodological weaknesses, and that few, if any, met the normal criteria for impact studies. Further, most of the cases studied were atypical.&lt;ref name=Griffiths/&gt;

== Inefficient marketing system ==
One reason for low prices is that Fairtrade farmers are forced to sell through a [[Monopsony|monopsonist]] cooperative, which may be inefficient or corrupt – certainly some private traders are more efficient than some cooperatives. They cannot choose the buyer who offers the best price, or switch when their cooperative is going bankrupt.&lt;ref&gt;Mendoza, R., &amp; J. Bastiaensen, J. (2003). Fair Trade and the Coffee Crisis in the Nicaraguan Segovias. Small Enterprise Development, 14(2), p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; There are also complaints that Fairtrade deviates from the free market ideal of some economists. Brink calls fair trade a "misguided attempt to make up for market failures" encouraging market inefficiencies and [[overproduction]].&lt;ref&gt;Brink, Lindsey. (2004). [http://www.adamsmith.org/pdf/groundsforcomplaint.pdf Grounds for Complaint]. URL accessed on September 25, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes good are over produced and a fair trade product will be sold in a non fair trade market. If consumers find out they will not want to pay the premium for fair trade.&lt;ref&gt;de Janvry, A. (2015). Fair Trade and Free Entry: Can a Disequilibrium Market Serve as a Development Tool? The review of economics and statistics, 97(3), 567-573&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Corruption===

Low prices may also occur because the Fair Trade marketing system provides more opportunities for corruption than the normal marketing system, and less possibility of, or incentive for, controlling it. Corruption has been noted in false labelling of coffee as Fairtrade by retailers and by packers in the developing countries,&lt;ref&gt;Weitzman, H. (2006, September 8).

== Fairtrade helps the rich==

Fair Trade is profitable for traders in rich countries. It is also aimed at richer farmers: in order to join Fairtrade, cooperatives must meet quality and political standards which means their farmers must be relatively skillful, educated and well capitalized, and critics point out that these farmers are, therefore, far from the poorest farmers. The majority of Fairtrade suppliers are in the higher income or middle income developing countries, such as Costa Rica and Mexico, with relatively few in the poorest countries. Mexico has 70 times the GNP per head of Sierra Leone, and very much larger coffee farms. The minimum wage of agricultural workers in Peru is $3 a day and the average income of Fairtrade farmers in Bolivia was US$900/year, very much higher than normal agricultural incomes in Africa and much of Asia. Again, critics say this is diverting money from the poorest farmers.&lt;ref name=Griffiths/&gt;

==Fairtrade harms other farmers==

===The overproduction argument===

Critics argue that Fairtrade, but not all other Fair Trade businesses, harm all non-Fairtrade farmers. Fairtrade claims that its farmers are paid higher prices and are given special advice on better techniques, both of which will lead to increased output being sold on the global market. Economists&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Griffiths, P. (2008) 'Why Fairtrade Isn't Fair', Prospect, August Accessed at http://www.griffithsspeaker.com/Fairtrade/why_fair_trade_isn.htm; Booth, P. and L. Whetstone (2007) 'Half a Cheer for Fair Trade', Economic Affairs, 27, 2, 29–36; Sidwell, M. (2008) Unfair Trade, London: Adam Smith Institute.; Brink, Lindsey. (2004).

In addition, the Fairtrade minimum price means that when the world market price collapses, it is the non-Fairtrade farmers, and particularly the poorest, who have to cut down their coffee trees. This argument is supported by mainstream economists. This argument is often illustrated with the example of Vietnam paying its coffee farmers over the world price in the 1980s, planting lots of coffee, then flooding the world market in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=Rigour&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peter|first=Griffiths|title=Lack of rigour in defending Fairtrade: a reply to Alastair Smith|journal=Economic Affairs|volume=31|pages=103–104|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0270.2010.02058.x|url=http://www.griffithsspeaker.com/Fairtrade/Lack%20of%20rigour%20in%20defending%20fairtrade.pdf|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith (2010) questioned the relevance of the Vietnam example,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Fairtrade|title=Lack of Rigour on Defending Fairtrade: Some important clarrifications of a distorting account – a reply to Perter Griffiths|journal=Economic Affairs|year=2010|volume=30|issue=2|pages=50–53|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0270.2010.02011.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Griffiths published a sharp rejoinder.&lt;ref name=Rejoinder/&gt;

The overproduction argument depends on the assumption that there is a significant increase in prices paid to Fairtrade farmers. The argument falls away if, as Fairtrade Labelling Organization&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade International. (2013). [http://www.fairtrade.net/coffee.html Coffee]. Retrieved January 3, 2013, from Fairtrade International.&lt;/ref&gt; and critics state, farmers do not get a higher price. This is not much of a defence however since saying only one of two serious flaws is possible at any one time still means the system is flawed.

===Counter-argument===
Key principles of fair trade include transparency and capacity building. ([[World Fair Trade Organization|WFTO]] Fair trade principles). Particularly in the developing world, it is very common for small-scale farmers to have only one or two buyers for their commodity products.  Prices thus can be set by the buyers along with quality criteria.  Normally buyers do not provide transparency as to the weighing and grading of product.  Unless the buyers are linked to a quality supply chain (such as a fair trade or organic supply chain), the buyers normally do not provide any capacity building as to how to improve the quality of the product and thus gain a higher price.  Fair trade when practiced well must provide full transparency in terms of pricing, weighing, and quality standards.   Also as the end goal is a superior quality product in all ways, good fair trade organizations provide good capacity building in terms of best production, harvest, and post-harvest practices.  From my personal experience (with Green Net, Thailand) and helping many other farmer groups to develop along this path in the region, it is clear that when one honest and transparent buyer enters the local market, it forces other buyers to be more honest and transparent.  Additionally in communities where farmers talk to each other (regardless of whether one is a member of a fair trade group or not), I have witnessed that there is knowledge transfer.  Thus non-fair trade farmers may and often do improve their production, harvest, and post-harvest practices, yielding a higher quality product, which merits a higher price.  This combined with a freer and more transparent market, thanks to the entry of a buyer (the fair trade buyer), means that non-fair trade farmers now are much more likely to be paid for the quality of their products and at the real market prices.

S. (2002). Fighting the tide: alternative trade organizations in the era of global free trade. World Development, 30(6), 949–958.&lt;/ref&gt; formulation of this, both using what they agree is an unrealistic model.

===Diverting aid from other farmers===
Fairtrade supporters boast of 'The Honeypot Effect' – that cooperatives which become Fairtrade members then attract additional aid from other NGO charities, government and international donors as a result of their membership.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Utting, K. (2009). Assessing the impact of Fair Trade Coffee: Towards an Integrative Framework. Journal of Business Ethics, 86:127-149. p. 141 ; Murray, D., Raynolds, L., &amp; Taylor, P. (2003). One cup at a time: Poverty alleviation and Fair Trade coffee in Latin America. Colorado State University; Luetchford P (2006). Brokering Fairtrade: relations between coffee producers and Alternative Trade Organizations - a view from Costa Rica' in D. Lewis and D.

Ecological Economics, 68 p. 3024&lt;/ref&gt; Typically there are now six to twelve other donors. Critics point out that this inevitably means that resources are being removed from other, poorer, farmers. It also makes it impossible to argue that any positive or negative changes in the living standards of farmers are due to Fairtrade rather than to one of the other donors.

==Other ethical issues==

===Secretiveness ===

Under EU law (Directive 2005/29/EC on Unfair Commercial Practices) the criminal offence of Unfair Trading is committed if (a) advertising or selling information 'contains false information and is therefore untruthful or in any way, including overall presentation, deceives or is likely to deceive the average consumer, even if the information is factually correct', (b) 'it omits material information that the average consumer needs ... and thereby causes or is likely to cause the average consumer to take a transactional decision that he would not have taken otherwise' or (c) 'fails to identify the commercial intent of the commercial practice ... [which] causes or is likely to cause the average consumer to take a transactional decision that he would not have taken otherwise.'&lt;ref name=Directive/&gt; Griffiths (2011)&lt;ref name=Griffiths/&gt; points to false claims that Fairtrade producers get higher prices, the almost universal failures to disclose the extra price charged for Fairtrade products, to disclose how much of this actually reaches the developing world, to disclose what this is spent on in the developing world, to disclose how much, if any, reaches farmers, and to disclose the harm that Fairtrade does to non-Fairtrade farmers. He also points to the failure to disclose when 'the primary commercial intent' is to make money for retailers and distributors in rich countries, which is, again, a criminal offence.

===Imposing one's politics===

The Fairtrade criteria presuppose a set of political values as to what economic, environmental, and social problems exist and how they are to be solved. Some critics state that it is unethical to bribe developing world producers to act according to political viewpoints that they may not agree with, and the consumers providing the money may not agree with. These critics also state that the unorthodox marketing system imposed, aiming to replace capitalism, may not tie in with the objectives of producers, consumers, importers or retailers.&lt;ref name=Many/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boersma, F. (2009). The urgency and necessity of a different type of market: the perspective of producers organized within the Fair Trade market. Journal of Business Ethics, 86:51-61; Boersma, F. V. (2002). [http://www.colostate.edu/Depts/Sociology/FairTradeResearchGroup Poverty Alleviation through Participation in Fair Trade Coffee Networks: The Case of UCIRI, Oaxaca, Mexico].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Audebrand, L., &amp; Pauchant, T. (2009). Can the Fair Trade Movement enrich Traditional Business Ethics? An Historical Study of its founders in Mexico. Journal of Business Ethics, 87:343-353; Gendron, C., V., B., &amp; Rance, A.

Ethical Value-Added: Fair Trade and the Case of Cafe Fenenino. Journal of Business Ethics, 86:27-49.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Unethical selling techniques ===

Booth says that the selling techniques used by some sellers and some supporters of Fairtrade are bullying, misleading and unethical.&lt;ref&gt;Booth, Philip "Don't bully the faithful into buying Fairtrade", The Catholic Herald, 20 February 2009; Booth, P. and L. Whetstone (2007) "Half a Cheer for Fair Trade", Economic Affairs, 27, 2, 29–36; Booth, P. (2008). [http://www.iea.org.uk/record.jsp?type=book&amp;ID=437 The Economics of Fairtrade: a Christian perspective]. London: Institute of Economic Affairs&lt;/ref&gt; 
There are problems with the use of boycott campaigns and other pressure to force sellers to stock a product they think ethically suspect. However, the opposite has been argued, that a more participatory and multi-stakeholder approach to auditing might improve the quality of the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Smith, Sally|displayauthors=etal|url=http://projects.nri.org/nret/idswp223.pdf|title=Ethical Trade in African Horticulture: Gender, Rights and Participation|year=2004|isbn=1-85864-833-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people argue that these practices are justifiable: that strategic use of labeling may help embarrass (or encourage) major suppliers into changing their practices. They may make transparent corporate vulnerabilities that activists can exploit. Or they may encourage ordinary people to get involved with broader projects of social change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Julie Guthman | year = 2007 | journal = Antipode | title = The Polanyian Way?

=== Misleading volunteers ===

A lot of people volunteer to work to support Fairtrade. They may do unpaid work for firms, or market Fairtrade in schools, universities, local governments or parliament. Sometimes they do not appreciate that most or all the benefit may go to businesses in rich countries. Davies and Crane&lt;ref&gt;Davies, I.A. and A Crane, "Andrew Crane Ethical Decision Making in Fair Trade Companies", Journal of Business Ethics 45: 79–92, 2003. P84&lt;/ref&gt; report that Day Chocolate "made considerable use of unpaid volunteer workers for routine tasks, many of whom seemed to be under the (false) impression that they were helping out a charity. Not only might one question the sometimes quite excessive use of unpaid labour in a for-profit organisation, but the management team at Day appeared to have no intention of correcting the obvious misapprehensions of the volunteers. However, this did not appear to be acknowledged as a potential ethical problem at Day."

===Failure to monitor standards===
There have been complaints that Fairtrade standards are inappropriate and may harm producers, sometimes imposing months of additional work for little return.&lt;ref&gt;Utting-Chamorro, K. (2005). Does Fairtrade make a difference? The case of small coffee producers in Nicaragua. Development in Practice, 15(3, 4); Moberg M (2005). "Fairtrade and Eastern Caribbean Banana Farmers: Rhetoric and Reality in the Anti-Globalization Movement." Human Organization 64:4-16, Cited in Nelson and Pound (2009) p 10; Valkila, J.: 2009, "Fair Trade organic coffee production in Nicaragua - Sustainable development or a poverty trap?" Ecological Economics, 68, p. 3023 Fraser (2009) cited in Griffiths, P. (2012), [http://www.griffithsspeaker.com/Fairtrade/why_fair_trade_isn.htm "Ethical Objections to Fairtrade"], Journal of Business Ethics (2012) 105:357–373 {{DOI|10.1007/s10551-011-0972-0}} Retrieved 2 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been claims that adherence to fair trade standards by producers has been poor and that enforcement of standards by Fairtrade is very weak, notably by Christian Jacquiau.&lt;ref name=Hamel&gt;{{cite web|author=Hamel, I.|year=2006|title=Fairtrade Firm Accused of Foul Play|publisher=Swiss Info |url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/Fair_trade_firm_accused_of_foul_play.html?cid=5351232|accessdate=2009-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by Paola Ghillani, who spent four years as president of Fairtrade Labelling Organizations.&lt;ref name=Hamel/&gt; There is criticism of poor enforcement: labourers on Fairtrade farms in Peru are paid less than the minimum wage;&lt;ref&gt;Weitzman, H.

Ecological Economics, 68, 3018-3025.&lt;/ref&gt; "some fair trade standards are not strictly enforced";&lt;ref&gt;Reed, D.: 2009, 'What do Corporations have to do with Fair Trade? Positive and normative analysis from a value chain perspective', Journal of Business Ethics, 86, 3-26. p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; and supermarkets may avoid their responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, G., Gibbon, J., &amp; Slack, R.: 2006, "The mainstreaming of Fair Trade: a macromarketing perspective",  Journal of Strategic Marketing, 14, 329-352.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, a ''[[Financial Times]]'' journalist found that ten out of the ten mills they visited had sold uncertified coffee to co-operatives as certified. It reported that they were "also handed evidence of at least one coffee association that received Fairtrade certification despite illegally growing some 20 per cent of its coffee in protected national forest land.&lt;ref name=Weitzman/&gt;

== Trade justice and fair trade==

Segments of the [[trade justice]] movement have also criticized fair trade in the past years for focusing too much on individual small producer groups while stopping short of advocating immediate trade policy changes that would have a larger impact on disadvantaged producers' lives. [[France|French]] author and [[Radio France Internationale|RFI]] correspondent [[Jean-Pierre Boris]] championed this view in his 2005 book ''Commerce inéquitable''.&lt;ref&gt;Boris, Jean-Pierre. (2005). Commerce inéquitable. Hachette Littératures. Paris.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political objections==

There have been largely political criticisms of Fairtrade, both from the left and the right.
Some believe the fair trade system is not radical enough. [[France|French]] author Christian Jacquiau, in his book ''Les coulisses du commerce équitable'', calls for stricter fair trade standards and criticizes the fair trade movement for working within the current system (i.e. partnerships with mass retailers, [[multinational corporation]]s etc.) rather than establishing a new fairer, fully autonomous trading system. Jacquiau is also a staunch supporter of significantly higher fair trade prices in order to maximize the impact, as most producers only sell a portion of their crop under fair trade terms.&lt;ref&gt;Jacquiau, Christian. (2006). Les Coulisses du Commerce Équitable. Éditions Mille et Une Nuits. Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that the approach of the FairTrade system is too rooted in a Northern consumerist view of justice which Southern producers do not participate in setting. "A key issue is therefore to make explicit who possesses the power to define the terms of Fairtrade, that is who possesses the power to determine the need of an ethic in the first instance, and subsequently command a particular ethical vision as the truth."&lt;ref&gt;Catherine S. Dolan (2008), ''Research in Economic Anthropology'', "Arbitrating risk through moral values: the case of Kenyan fairtrade", volume 28, pp. 271–296&lt;/ref&gt;
Some of the criticisms of Fairtrade from the free market approach to economics appear to be linked to right wing political approaches, but this does not mean that their analysis in this particular case is unacceptable to mainstream economists.

'''Gary Edward Varner''' (born March 10, 1957) is an American philosopher specialising in [[environmental ethics]], philosophical questions related to [[animal rights]] and [[animal welfare]], and [[R. M. Hare]]'s [[two-level utilitarianism]]. He is currently a [[full professor|professor]] in the Department of Philosophy at [[Texas A&amp;M University]], and has been based at the university since 1990. He was educated at [[Arizona State University]], the [[University of Georgia]] and the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]; at Madison, where he was supervised by Jon Morline, he wrote one of the first [[doctoral thesis|doctoral theses]] on environmental ethics. Varner's first [[monograph]] was ''In Nature's Interests?'', which was published by [[Oxford University Press]] in 1998. In the book, Varner defended a form of [[biocentrism (ethics)|biocentric]] individualism, according to which all living entities have morally considerable interests.

From 2001, Varner embarked on a research project exploring animals in Hare's two-level utilitarianism. ''Personhood, Ethics, and Animal Cognition'', published by Oxford University Press in 2012, was the first monograph arising from this project. In the book, Varner moved away from his biocentrism, instead endorsing a developed version of Hare's ethics. Varner draws a distinction between persons, near-persons and merely sentient beings; although all are morally considerable, the lives of persons are of the most significance, and the lives of merely sentient beings are of the least. The practical consequences of this view, though initial comments were offered in ''Personhood, Ethics, and Animal Cognition'', will be explored in ''Sustaining Animals'', forthcoming with Oxford University Press.

==Career==
[[File:TAMU YMCA.JPG|thumb|left|The [[YMCA]] Building, [[Texas A&amp;M University]], houses the University's Department of Philosophy, where Varner has taught since 1990.]]
Varner completed a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in [[philosophy]] at [[Arizona State University]] in 1980, before studying for a [[Master of Arts]] in philosophy at the [[University of Georgia]], which he completed in 1983. He read for a [[PhD]] at [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]],&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt; writing a [[doctoral thesis|thesis]] on [[environmental ethics]]; this was one of the first on the topic.&lt;ref name="Biographical narrative"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A&amp;M"&gt;"[http://philosophy.tamu.edu/html/bio-Varner.html Gary Varner] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114084555/http://philosophy.tamu.edu/html/bio-Varner.html |date=2016-11-14 }}". Texas A&amp;M University. Accessed November 13, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Developed versions of some of the thesis's chapters were later published as chapters 2, 3 and 4 Varner's first book, ''In Nature's Interests?''. His doctoral research was supervised by Jon Morline, who continued as a supervisor even after leaving Madison to work at [[St. Olaf College]].&lt;ref&gt;Varner 1998, p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt; Graduating from Madison in 1988, Varner had a number of short-term jobs in the late 1980s; he [[lecturer|lectured]] in philosophy at the [[University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point]] from 1987 to 1988, acted as a [[visiting professor|visiting]] [[assistant professor]] at Madison's Institute of Environmental Studies in the Summer of 1988, and took up the same role, this time in philosophy, at [[Washington University in St. Louis]] from 1988 to 1990.&lt;ref name="CV"&gt;Varner, Gary (2016). [http://philosophy.tamu.edu/~gary/Vita.pdf CV]. Texas A&amp;M University. Accessed November 13, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Varner joined [[Texas A&amp;M University]] in 1990, becoming an assistant professor in 1991. He became Director of Graduate Studies in 1994, a post he kept until 2010. Varner was promoted to [[associate professor]] in 1996, and, in 1998, published his first book: ''In Nature's Interests? Interests, Animal Rights, and Environmental Ethics'', which was a part of [[Oxford University Press]]'s Environmental Ethics and Science Policy Series, edited by Kristin Schrader-Frechette.&lt;ref&gt;Varner 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Varner was promoted to [[full professor]] in 2010, and acted as department head from 2011 to 2014.&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt;

Varner's second monograph, ''Personhood, Ethics, and Animal Cognition: Situating Animals in the Two-Level Utilitarianism of R. M. Hare'', was published in 2012 by Oxford University Press.&lt;ref name="V2012"&gt;Varner 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Varner had been working on questions about [[R. M. Hare]] and animals since 2001, when he taught a graduate class exploring the subject; given that [[Peter Singer]] was a student of Hare, Varner was interested in exploring whether Hare's philosophy endorsed Singer's conclusions about animal liberation.&lt;ref name="preface"&gt;Varner 2012, pp. xi–xii.&lt;/ref&gt; A project entitled ''Harey Animals: Situating Animals in the Two-Level Utilitarianism of R. M. Hare'' was submitted to Oxford University Press, but this was subsequently split into two books; ''Personhood, Ethics, and Animal Cognition'' was the first, while the second, the forthcoming ''Sustaining Animals: Envisioning Humane, Sustainable Communities'', in under contract with the publisher.&lt;ref name="Biographical narrative"&gt;Varner, Gary. "[http://philosophy.tamu.edu/~gary/bio.html Biographical narrative] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141211021501/http://philosophy.tamu.edu/~gary/bio.html |date=2014-12-11 }}". Texas A&amp;M University. Accessed November 13, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="preface"/&gt; While ''Personhood, Ethics, and Animal Cognition'' addresses theoretical issues in Hare's philosophy, ''Sustaining Animals'' is more [[applied ethics|practically focussed]], exploring the applicability of the Harean philosophy developed in ''Personhood, Ethics, and Animal Cognition'' to real-world issues concerning human-animal relationships.&lt;ref name="preface"/&gt; In 2017, Varner's ''Defending Biodiversity: Environmental Science and Ethics'', co-authored with the [[University of Guelph]] [[ecologist]] Jonathan Newman and the Guelph philosopher Stefan Linquist, was published by Cambridge University Press.

==Thought==

===Biocentric individualism===
Varner's ''In Nature's Interests?'' offers a resolution of the debate between individualistic approaches to [[animal rights]] and holistic accounts of environmental ethics. Varner defends an interest-based [[biocentrism (ethics)|biocentric]] individualism according to which all living beings—including plants&lt;ref name="Jensen235"&gt;Jensen 2000, p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt;—have morally significant interests that ground ''prima facie'' (though overridable) duties.&lt;ref&gt;Rowlands 2000, p. 598.&lt;/ref&gt; The approach follows in the tradition of the work of [[Kenneth Goodpaster]] and [[Paul Taylor (philosopher)|Paul Taylor]], though Varner's approach differs from Taylor's in its focus on interests rather than duties, with Varner showing clear [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] commitments.&lt;ref name="Jensen235"/&gt;

Varner begins by critiquing holistic approaches to environmental ethics, using [[J. Baird Callicott]]'s as his example. He argues that the [[philosophic burden of proof|burden of proof]] is with holists to defend the claim that [[ecosystem]]s have interests or have value for some other reason. He next considers desires as the paradigmatic basis of interests, exploring which beings have desires. Nonetheless, he argues that desires cannot be the sole basis of interests; 19th-century mariners, for instance, had an interest in using [[ascorbic acid]] to avoid [[scurvy]], though they could not have desired the acid, as they did not know about it. Instead, such people had a "biological" interest in the acid. It is, Varner argues, the presence of biological interests that separates living beings from artifacts.&lt;ref name="Jensen236"/&gt; This grounds Varner's argument for biocentrism, which [[Mark Rowlands]] summarises as follows:

#Nothing at or below the level of a fish possesses desires.
#Nevertheless, all living things possess biological needs, and these needs are plausibly construed as interests.
#The welfare of an organism O is, at least in part, to be understood in terms of the interests, rather than the desires, of O.
#Therefore, all living things have a welfare.
#Therefore, all living things are morally considerable.&lt;ref&gt;Rowlands 2000, p. 599.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rowlands argues that the problem with the book's central approach is that it assumes that all interests have a clear relation to [[welfare]] and thus moral considerability; an assumption which, he argues, is partially undermined by the introduction of biological interests.&lt;ref&gt;Rowlands 2000, pp. 599–601.&lt;/ref&gt; Jon Jensen, who reviewed the book for ''Ethics and the Environment'', raised a similar worry, arguing that Varner did not sufficiently justify his claim that biological interests are inherently morally significant.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen 2000, p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt;

A distinctive aspect of Varner's theory as presented in ''In Nature's Interests?'' is the hierarchy of interests that he proposes; biological interests are the least important, with desire-based interests of greater significance and "ground projects"—possessed only by humans, these are "a nexus of [an individual's] most important desires"—of the most weight.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen 2000, pp. 237–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Varner defends a kind of "axiological anthropocentrism"; this can be distinguished from "valuational anthropocentrism", according to which only humans have inherent value.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen 2000, p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book also has a practical dimension, presenting debates between [[anthropocentrism|anthropocentric]] and non-anthropocentric approaches to environmental ethics as of little practical consequence, and suggesting that animal rights goals can be consistent with holistic environmentalist goals.&lt;ref name="Jensen236"&gt;Jensen 2000, p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt; Jensen argues that Varner's own discussion of the reconciliation of environmentalism and animal advocacy is too narrow, but that, nonetheless, Varner's own biocentric individualism offers potential in this area, even despite the limited engagement in the book with practical animal-related issues.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen 2000, pp. 238–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Two-level utilitarianism===
Hare's philosophy of [[two-level utilitarianism]] has been a focus of Varner's since the early 2000s, and was the subject of his ''Personhood, Ethics, and Animal Cognition''.&lt;ref name="Biographical narrative"/&gt;&lt;ref name="preface"/&gt; In the book, Varner breaks with his previous biocentrism, instead endorsing [[sentientism]] (the idea that [[sentience]] is necessary and sufficient for moral considerability), [[Universal prescriptivism|prescriptivism]], and two-level utilitarianism.&lt;ref&gt;Attfield and Humphreys 2012, p. 493.&lt;/ref&gt; The book is split into three parts: "Hare's Two-Level Utilitarianism", "Persons, Near-Persons, and the Merely Sentient", and "Formulating ILS [Intuitive-Level System] Rules for Persons, Near-Persons, and the Merely Sentient".&lt;ref name="V2012"/&gt; The first part offers a reconstruction and analysis of Hare's philosophy, while the latter two offer an original position on [[animal ethics]] and [[personhood]].&lt;ref&gt;Kadlac 2015, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Part I, Varner offers considerable endorsement of Harean philosophy. Varner interprets Hare as understanding that utilitarianism derives from prescriptivism, and affirms Hare's argument on this point. He goes on to discuss the utility of Intuitive-Level System (ILS) rules;&lt;ref&gt;Attfield and Humphreys 2012, p. 494.&lt;/ref&gt; these are the rules that one lives by in day-to-day life, which, though ultimately justified by it, do not derive their content from utilitarian calculation.&lt;ref&gt;Varner 2012, chap. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; There are, for Varner, four key kinds of ILSs: "common morality, personal morality, professional ethics, and laws". Though these are [[deontological]] in "flavor", following the precepts of these ILSs is generally justified under two-level utilitarianism.&lt;ref&gt;Kadlac 2015, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; Further arguments—these are original, rather than being derived from Hare's own—are then offered for Hare's prescriptivism.&lt;ref&gt;Attfield and Humphreys 2012, pp. 494–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Part II, Varner adopts a [[Higher-order theories of consciousness|higher-order thought theory of consciousness]] and reviews evidence for [[animal consciousness]]. He argues that, according to contemporary science, vertebrates are conscious (i.e., sentient, able to feel pain), but few invertebrates are; [[cephalopod]]s are an exception.&lt;ref name="AH495"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 2014, p. 491.&lt;/ref&gt; He goes on to argue that most animals lack a biographical sense of self, something possessed by paradigmatic humans. A good life for human persons, consequently, "consists in living a good story",&lt;ref name="AH495"&gt;Attfield and Humphreys 2012, p. 495.&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that persons can be harmed in ways that non-persons cannot.&lt;ref name="K249"&gt;Kadlac 2015, p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt; Varner denies that nonhuman animals lack the psychological sophistication necessary for personhood, but argues that some, nonetheless, may be "near-persons"; this means that they lack a biographical sense of self, but possess [[autonoetic consciousness]]. Possible candidates include nonhuman [[primates]], as well as [[Corvidae]], [[Cetacea]] and [[Elephantidae]],&lt;ref name="AH496"/&gt; and [[rat]]s and [[parrot]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 2014, p. 690.&lt;/ref&gt; Varner frames the lives of near-persons as of less significance than the lives of persons, but of greater significance than the lives of other animals who are nonetheless sentient.&lt;ref name="AH496"&gt;Attfield and Humphreys 2012, p. 496.&lt;/ref&gt; The distinctions drawn in Part II are logically independent of any commitment to utilitarianism, Harean or otherwise.&lt;ref name="K249"/&gt;

In Part III, Varner explores the replaceability argument (the idea that it would be ethically acceptable to painlessly kill beings if it was immediately replaced with a new equally happy being) in the context of two-level utilitarianism. At the critical level, he argues that both humans and animals are replaceable. However, he argues that the intuitive-level idea that humans are not replaceable should be respected.&lt;ref&gt;Moss 2015, p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; Animals typically kept on farms are, for Varner, replaceable, meaning that certain forms of [[animal agriculture]] are permissible.&lt;ref name="AH496"/&gt; Varner's also claims that there is a ''prima facie'' good in creating more happy animals and more happy humans,&lt;ref name="M228"/&gt; the latter meaning that there is a ''prima facie'' good in human procreation, and a ''prima facie'' wrong in [[abortion]].&lt;ref name="K249"/&gt; This, however, applies only to critical-level thinking, and good intuitive-level theorising, he argues, would typically leave these decisions up to individuals.&lt;ref name="M228"&gt;Moss 2015, p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt; Varner also explores the issue of [[argument from marginal cases|"marginal" cases]]. Given that he holds that the lives of nonhuman non-persons and nonhuman near-persons are of lesser value than those of human persons, it may seem that Varner has to accept that the lives of human non-persons and human near-persons are of less value than the lives of human persons or else face the charge of [[speciesism]] or inconsistency. However, Varner argues that human non- and near-persons should be given equal rights to life as human persons on the basis that, first, human persons have strong relationships with human non-persons, and, second, human persons may fear becoming human non-persons.&lt;ref name="AH496"/&gt;

Varner then considers a range of proposals for sustainable, humane agriculture, including replacing cattle with buffalo and engineering blind chickens.&lt;ref name="AH496"/&gt; Varner defends demi-[[vegetarianism]], holding that humans should eat less meat and be more selective about where their meat comes from;&lt;ref&gt;Kadlac 2015, pp. 249–50.&lt;/ref&gt; [[factory farming]], for example, is likely unacceptable.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 2014, p. 659.&lt;/ref&gt; The book closes with a consideration of the relationship between a Harean approach to animal ethics and Singer's approach; Varner argues that Singer has employed two-level utilitarianism, and implicitly supports the idea of near-persons. Varmer also argues that Singer, despite the latter's advocacy for vegetarianism, presents a theory that supports certain forms of humane agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;Attfield and Humphreys 2012, pp. 496–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection''' ('''GRAND''') is a proposed large-scale detector designed to collect [[ultra-high-energy cosmic ray|ultra-high energy cosmic particles]] as [[cosmic rays]], [[neutrino]]s and [[photon]]s with energies exceeding 10&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; [[Electronvolt|eV]]. This project aims at solving the mystery of their origin and the [[Cosmogony|early stages]] of the universe itself. The proposal, formulated by an international group of researchers, calls for an array of 200,000 receivers to be placed on mountain ranges around the world.

==Overview==

The GRAND detector would search for [[neutrino]]s, exotic particles emitted by some and the [[black hole]]s in the center of galaxies. These neutrinos could help astronomers find the source of other energetic particles called [[ultra-high-energy cosmic ray]]s. When neutrinos reach Earth, they often collide with particles either in the air or on the ground, creating showers of secondary particles. These secondary particles can be picked up by the radio antennas, which lets researchers calculate the trajectory of the initial neutrinos and trace them back to their source. &lt;ref name='Gizmodo 2018'&gt; {{cite news|url=https://gizmodo.com/astronomers-propose-huge-new-telescope-system-to-unders-1830074459|title=Astronomers Propose Huge New Telescope System to Understand the Most Energetic Particles Ever Detected|author=Ryan F. Mandelbaum|work=[[Gizmodo]]|date=31 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='PM 2018'&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.popularmechanics.com/space/telescopes/a24445762/scientists-want-to-build-a-telescope-the-size-of-nebraska/|title=Scientists Want to Build a Telescope the Size of Nebraska|author=Avery Thompson|work=[[Popular Mechanics]]|date=31 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept was first published in 2017. &lt;ref name='Present and Perspectives 2017'/&gt;

The giant radio detector array would comprise 200,000 low-cost antennas in groups of 10,000 spread out over nearly 200,000 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (80,000 square miles) at different locations around the world.&lt;ref name='PM 2018'/&gt; This would make it the largest detector in the world. Construction, installation and networking the 200,000 antennae, would cost approximately $226 million,&lt;ref name='Gizmodo 2018'/&gt; excluding the price for renting the land and manpower.&lt;ref&gt;[http://grand.cnrs.fr/grand/faq/ GRAND - Home site: FAQ].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principle==

The strategy of GRAND is to detect the radio emission coming from particle showers that develop in the terrestrial atmosphere as a result of the interaction of ultra-high energy (UHE) cosmic rays, gamma rays, and neutrinos. &lt;ref name='Alvarez 2018'/&gt; Astrophysical [[tau neutrino]]s ({{SubatomicParticle|Tauon neutrino}}) can be detected through [[Air shower (physics)|extensive air showers]] (EAS) induced by [[Tau (particle)|tau]] ({{SubatomicParticle|Tau-}}) decays in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name='Present and Perspectives 2017'/&gt; The short-lived tau decays in the atmosphere generates an EAS that emits measurable  electromagnetic emissions up to frequencies of hundreds of [[Hertz|MHz]].&lt;ref name='Present and Perspectives 2017'/&gt; The antennae are foreseen to operate in the 60-200 MHz band to avoid the short-wave background noise at lower frequencies. &lt;ref name='Present and Perspectives 2017'/&gt;

Each individual antenna is a simple [[Batwing antenna|Bow-tie design]], featuring 3 perpendicular bows with an additional vertical arm to sample all three [[Polarization in astronomy|polarization]] directions.&lt;ref name='Alvarez 2018'/&gt; Each antenna is mounted on a single 5-meter-tall pole, and each antenna in the grid is spaced at 1 km within a square grid. If the full array of 200,000 antennae is build, GRAND would reach an [[Flavour (particle physics)|all-flavor]] sensitivity of 4 x10&lt;sup&gt;-10&lt;/sup&gt; GeV cm&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;   sr&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; above 5 x10&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; eV. Because of its sub-degree angular resolution, GRAND will also search for point sources of UHE neutrinos, steady and transient, potentially starting UHE neutrino astronomy, allowing for the discovery and follow-up of large numbers of radio transients, [[fast radio burst]]s, giant radio pulses, and for precise studies of the [[Reionization|epoch of reionization]].&lt;ref name='Alvarez 2018'/&gt;

The researchers estimate that GRAND could allow not just the detection of neutrinos, but could also allow a differentiation of the source types, such as [[galaxy cluster]]s with central sources, fast-spinning newborn [[pulsar]]s, [[active galactic nuclei]], and afterglows of [[gamma-ray burst]]s.&lt;ref name='Present and Perspectives 2017'/&gt;

==Status==

Simulation and experimental work is ongoing on technological development and background rejection strategies. Phase one is called GRANDProto35, that includes 35 antennas and 24 [[scintillator]]s, deployed in the [[Tian Shan|Tian Shan mountains]] in China.&lt;ref name='Present and Perspectives 2017'/&gt; If a pulse is observed simultaneously in the signals from three or more scintillators, the signals are recorded.  As of October 2018, GRANDProto35 is in commissioning phase.&lt;ref name='Alvarez 2018'/&gt; So far, the system achieves 100% detection efficiency for trigger rates up to 20 kHz. 

The following step is planned for 2020, and its is a dedicated setup called GRANDProto300 within an area of 300 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;ref name='Present and Perspectives 2017'/&gt; The baseline layout is a square grid with a 1 km inter-antenna spacing, just as for later stages. Because GRANDProto300 will not be large enough to detect cosmogenic neutrinos, the viability will be tested using instead [[Air shower (physics)|extensive air showers]] initiated by very inclined cosmic rays, thus providing an opportunity to do cosmic-ray science.&lt;ref name='Alvarez 2018'/&gt; The site would be hosted at the Chinese provinces of XinJiang, Inner Mongolia, Yunnan, and Gansu.&lt;ref name='Alvarez 2018'/&gt; If funded, the later phases would build GRAND10k in 2025, and finally GRAND200k (200,000 receivers) in the 2030s.&lt;ref name='Alvarez 2018'/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="78415">'''Inequity aversion in animals''' is the willingness to sacrifice material pay-offs for the sake of greater equality.
It manifests itself through negative responses when rewards are not distributed equally between animals.
In controlled experiments it has been observed in [[bonobo]]s, [[chimpanzee]]s, [[macaque]]s, [[capuchin monkey]]s, [[tamarin]]s, [[dog]]s, [[rat]]s, and [[raven]]s, all species that cooperate naturally.
Disadvantageous [[inequity aversion]] is most common, that is, the animal protests when it gets a lesser reward than another animal. But advantageous inequity aversion has been observed as well, in chimpanzees and capuchins: the animal protests when it gets a better reward. Scientists believe that sensitivity to inequity co-evolved with the ability to cooperate, as it helps to sustain benefitting from cooperation.

The first researcher to discover inequity aversion in animals was [[Sarah Brosnan]]. She got the idea for an experiment when during a normal feeding session, handing out peanuts to the lower-ranked capuchin monkeys, an alpha male named Ozzie offered her an orange to also get a peanut. Brosnan and de Waal published the results of their first study in 2003 in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''. They described how capuchin monkeys refused to participate in a food-for-token exchange task once they saw another monkey get rewarded more desirable food for equal effort. This effect was even stronger if they observed the partner receiving such a reward without any effort at all.

A few experimental paradigms have been used to test inequity aversion. The exchange is most common. Here animals need to hand over a token to the human experimentator in exchange for a food reward. The animals need to have good visibility of their partner and their actions, preferably close and side-by-side. The [[Ultimatum game]] is a paradigm in which one animal chooses a token, hands it over to another animal who then can decide to exchange it for rewards. These rewards depend on the type of token and can be equal for both, more for one than the other, or nothing for one of them. Repetition of this task is key so the animals have an opportunity to base their actions on previous outcomes. Another paradigm is feeding without any task. This paradigm has so far not resulted in any evidence of inequity aversion in animals.

==Background==
The ability of humans to [[Cooperation|cooperate]] is well documented, but its origin is an open question. By researching aspects of cooperation in other species, [[Evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychologists]] aim to pinpoint when and under which conditions cooperation emerges. One key aspect of cooperation is a sense of [[Distributive_justice|fairness]]: the reward an individual gets from cooperating should be fair compared to others or else future cooperation may break down.{{sfn|Jelbert|Singh|Gray|Taylor|2015|p=1}} Humans show a consistent preference for equal over unequal outcomes.{{sfn|Fehr| Schmidt|1999}} A full-blown concept of fairness is typically present in children aged 6, although 3-year-olds already prefer a giver who distributes rewards from cooperation fairly over one who does so unfairly.{{sfn|Tomasello|Vaish|2013|p=244}}{{sfn|McAuliffe|Blake|Steinbeis|Warneken|2017}} When given the choice to accept an unfair reward, children rejected it if it was less valuable than the reward of their peer (disadvantageous inequity aversion), researchers Blake et al. found in a study across seven countries. Even if it was more valuable than the reward of their peer, children in three countries{{efn-ua|Advantageous inequity aversion was found in USA, Canada, and Uganda, but not in Senegal, Peru, Mexico, and India.{{sfn|Blake|McAuliffe|Corbit| Callaghan |2015|p=259}}}} still on average rejected it (advantageous inequity aversion), albeit only older children did so.{{sfn|Blake|McAuliffe|Corbit| Callaghan |2015|p=258}} Disadvantageous inequity aversion is considered a universal feature of human behavior,{{sfn|Heinrich|Boyd|Bowles|Camerer|2001}} whereas advantageous inequity aversion may be strongly influenced by cultural norms.{{sfn|Blake|McAuliffe|Corbit| Callaghan |2015|p=260}}

Humans are not the only cooperative animals. Many species of animals cooperate in the wild.{{sfn|Péron|Rat-Fischer|Lalot|Nagle|2011|p=545}} Collaborative [[Predation|hunting]] has been observed in the air (e.g., among [[Aplomado falcon]]s),{{sfn|Hector|1986|p=247}} on land (e.g., among [[chimpanzee]]s),{{sfn|Boesch|Boesch|1989}} in the water (e.g., among [[killer whale]]s),{{sfn|Pitman|Durban|2012|p=16}} and under the ground (e.g., among [[driver ant]]s).{{sfn|Brian|2012|p=18}} Further examples of cooperation include parents and others working together to raise young{{sfn|Péron|Rat-Fischer|Lalot|Nagle|2011|p=545}} (e.g., among [[African elephant]]s),{{sfn|Lee|1987|p=278}} and groups defending their territory, which has been studied in [[primate]]s and other [[social animal|social species]] such as [[bottlenose dolphin]]s, [[spotted hyena]]s, and [[common raven]]s.{{sfn|Massen|Ritter|Bugnyar|2015|p=1}} Fairness in cooperative animals in the wild has also been observed. Chimpanzees are known to divide the carcass obtained during collective hunting partially based on each individual’s contribution to the hunt.{{sfn|Watts|Mitani|2002|p=13}}
With cooperation not being uniquely human, inequity aversion may not be uniquely human either.{{sfn|Brosnan|de Waal|2003|p=297}} Through controlled experiments with animals researchers look for this behavior and hope to be able to answer the questions of how and why inequity aversion, and cooperative behavior as a whole, evolved.{{sfn|Jelbert|Singh|Gray|Taylor|2015|p=1}}

==First research==
The first researcher to test inequity aversion in animals was [[Sarah Brosnan]]. As a [[PhD]] student at [[Emory University]] in Atlanta, Georgia, the idea for an experiment came to her during a feeding session with capuchin monkeys. As she was handing out peanuts to the lower-ranked monkeys, an alpha male named Ozzie offered her an orange, a higher-value food, to also get a peanut.{{efn-ua|Brosnan's proposed experiment to better understand this socio-economic behavior nearly was rejected by her PhD committee, because she had already planned six other experiments. But because the committee could not agree on the expected outcome of her proposed experiment, her advisor, professor [[Frans de Waal]], told her she obviously had to do it.&lt;ref name="brosnan-podcast"&gt;{{cite AV media|title=That's Not Fair! What Cucumber-Throwing Capuchins Tell Us About the Evolution of Fairness|series=The Social Mind: A Festschrift Symposium Honoring the Career of Frans de Waal, September 19, 2014| url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/thats-not-fair!-what-cucumber/id503937750?i=319926039&amp;mt=2|first=Sarah|last=Brosnan|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Under guidance of her professor, [[Frans de Waal]], Brosnan set up an experiment to ascertain if capuchins' behavior is influenced by rewards given to others. In a preliminary test with two conditions capuchins were tested side by side and were either both given a cucumber as a reward, or one was given a cucumber and the other a grape, which was known to be perceived as a higher-value food. The results indicated that female capuchins might be sensitive to unequal distribution of rewards. Male capuchins did not show any different behavior between the two conditions.{{sfn|Brosnan|de Waal|2003|p=297-298}}

Brosnan subsequently tested five female capuchins in different conditions. As before, the rewards were either equal or inferior to what the other monkey received. Brosnan also tested if it matters if the other monkey receives food as reward for effort or for free, not doing anything at all. The task the capuchins had to perform was a common exchange task: the experimenter handed the monkey a stone which simply had to be handed back. If done so, the experimenter would give the food reward. In the side-by-side setting the capuchins could see each other's actions and, crucially, each other's rewards. A further control condition was to ascertain if the presence of the higher-value reward mattered or the presence of another monkey, since primates have long been known to show a [[contrast effect]].
{{efn-ua|Research into the contrast effect in animals dates back to 1928 when Tinklepaugh tested the effect of expectation in [[macaque]]s. He let the monkeys see he put treats under a bucket. The next day he would lift the bucket and hand out the treats. But when he surreptitiously switched the treats for a lettuce leaf, the monkeys reacted poorly in the morning, refusing those rewards.{{sfn|Brosnan |Flemming |Talbot |Mayo |2011|p=57}}{{sfn|Tinklepaugh|1928}}}}
In this condition there was only one capuchin and the experimenter first placed a grape in front of the empty place where the other monkey would have been, before starting the exchange task with the test subject  and a piece of cucumber.{{sfn|Brosnan|de Waal|2003|p=297-298}}

The results showed a clear effect of other capuchins' rewards influencing their own acceptance of rewards. Whereas in the equity condition cucumbers were happily accepted as reward for handing back the rock, in the inequity condition cucumbers were rejected one in three times. Rejection sometimes took the shape of actively throwing the piece of cucumber back at the experimenter, and sometimes as violently pulling the dividing screen. In addition, one in six times the capuchins did not even return the stone in the inequity condition. The failure rate to exchange was even higher in the effort control, where the other capuchin got a grape for not doing anything at all: three out of four times there was no successful exchange.{{sfn|Brosnan|de Waal|2003|p=297-298}}

Each run of tests consisted of 25 trails in the same condition. The researchers compared the results of the first 15 against the last 10. They found that in the inequity condition and in the effort control, the failure rate in the last 10 was higher than in the first 15, suggesting that it may have taken a few trials before
the monkeys noticed what reward the other one had received. In the food control however, where grapes were visible but without any other monkey present, the failure rate in the last 10 was lower than in the first 15, suggesting
that expectations are based on seeing a partner receive high-value rewards rather than the mere presence of such rewards.{{sfn|Brosnan|de Waal|2003|p=298-299}} The researchers concluded that female capuchin monkeys are inequity averse.

Brosnan and de Waal published the results of their first study in 2003 in the science journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''.{{sfn|Brosnan|de Waal|2003}} The study has since been cited over a thousand times.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5&amp;q=brosnan+de+waal+nature+2003&amp;btnG= |title=Google Scholar results|access-date=24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent studies==
A few researchers have criticized Brosnan and de Waal's conclusion that the capuchins avoided inequity.
The data could also be explained by other driving forces.{{sfn|Massen|Van Den Berg|Spruijt|Sterck|2012|p=146}} To get to the bottom of this, the original Brosnan and de Waal study has been replicated many times, and alternative experimental designs have been used as well.{{sfn|Brosnan|de Waal|2014|p=1251776-3}}

===Alternative hypotheses===
Various alternative explanations have been provided by other researchers:
* Perhaps the animals refuse food because getting less preferred than expected. An expectation set either by what is visible or in previous trials. Perhaps this has nothing to do with a social context.{{sfn|Neiworth|Johnson|Whillock|Greenberg|2009|p=11}}
* Perhaps refusal is caused by a social factor but not the partner animal but the human experimenter.{{sfn|Engelmann|Clift|Herrmann|Tomasello|2017|p=1}}
Controlled experiments with various species have been performed to test these hypotheses.{{sfn|Engelmann|Clift|Herrmann|Tomasello|2017|p=1}}


===Subjects===
Researchers have selected various species as subjects of their inequity aversion experiments.{{sfn|Brosnan|de Waal|2014|p=1251776-3}} Within the group of species closely related to humans, researchers have chosen both social primates (chimpanzees, bonobos, owl monkeys,{{sfn|Freeman|Sullivan|Hopper|Talbot|2013}} marmosets,{{sfn|Freeman|Sullivan|Hopper|Talbot|2013}} and tamarins{{sfn|Neiworth|Johnson|Whillock|Greenberg|2009}}), and ones living solitary or just with their offspring (orangutans,{{sfn|Brosnan|Flemming|Talbot|Mayo|2011}} gorillas, squirrel monkeys{{sfn|Talbot|Freeman|Williams|Brosnan|2011}}). Given its connection to cooperation, researchers have also looked for animals that displayed any capability of cooperation in experiments, such as corvids (crows, ravens) and dogs.{{sfn|Brosnan|de Waal|2014|p=1251776-4}} Brosnan and de Waal have called for experiments with elephants, dolphins, and domestic cats to further the understanding of the evolution of fairness.{{sfn|Brosnan|de Waal|2014|p=1251776-5}}

Within their experiments researchers have controlled for various characteristics of subjects, just like Brosnan and de Waal did by using only female capuchins. A common factor is relationship: whether or not the two animals in the experiment have a genetic relationship or not. Dominance rank in social animals has also been known to play a role in cooperation experiments and is thus controlled for.{{sfn|Brosnan|de Waal|2014|p=1251776-2}}

===Conditions===
To control for factors that may or may not influence inequity aversion researchers have used various conditions in their experiments.

====Effort control====
Does it matter if the food is handed out as a reward for effort or simply as a gift? Most commonly used is an exchange task: the experimenter hands the subject a token, and this or something equivalent needs be given back to the experimenter, for which as reward a food item is given. In a task called 'target' subjects must hold on to a token for a specified period of time.{{sfn|Brosnan|de Waal|2014|p=1251776-3}}

====Contrast control====
Is any aversion to inequity due to the social aspect of the experiment or due to the animal expecting a higher-value reward? Contrast studies date back to the 1920s{{sfn|Tinklepaugh|1928}} and involve a series of higher-value rewards, followed by a low-value reward. Subjects can be tested alone{{sfn|Brosnan|de Waal|2014|p=1251776-1}} or side-by-side.{{sfn|Brosnan|2013|p=10418}}

====Proximity control====
Does it matter if the animals are side-by-side with full visibility of each other's actions and rewards, or far apart or across from each other.{{sfn|Brosnan|de Waal|2014|p=1251776-2}}

====Ultimatum game====
A few studies have deviated from the exchange paradigm and followed a paradigm used in inequity experiments with humans, the [[Ultimatum game]].{{sfn|Proctor| Williamson|de Waal| Brosnan|2013}}{{sfn|Yamagishi|Horita|Takagishi| Shinada|2009}} In this game, one individual, the proposer, has to pick a token that either represents a fair division of rewards or an unfair division. The other individual, the responder, then needs to decide to either accept this token, in which case rewards are given as per token value, or reject the token, in which both proposer and responder do not get any reward.{{sfn|Brosnan|de Waal|2014|p=1251776-2}}
{{efn-ua|The Impunity game is a variant of the Ultimatum game with a small twist: if the responder rejects the proposal, the proposer gets to keep the reward and the responder gets nothing.{{sfn|Brosnan|de Waal|2014|p=1251776-2}} This game has not been tested with animals. The challenge is to ensure the animals understand that the proposer had a choice.{{sfn|Brosnan|2013|p=10418}}}}

====Choice====
Some studies give the subject a choice between two option with different rewards, typically one in which both animals get rewarded and one in which only the chooser gets rewarded. This could be a direct choice between food plates,{{sfn|Raihani|McAuliffe|Brosnan|Bshary|2012}} or indirect, such as for example between two pathways that lead to different rewards.{{sfn|Hernandez-Lallement|van Wingerden|Marx|Srejic|2015|p=1}}

====Cooperative pulling====
Within the [[cooperative pulling paradigm]] (an experimental design in which two or more animals pull rewards towards themselves via an apparatus that they can not successfully operate alone) researchers have varied the rewards. They compare the likelihood of animals cooperating again after both received the same reward for jointly pulling to that of one receiving more than to other, or in extremis, one receiving all and the other none. This division can be done by the experimenter (one bowl each) or by the animals (one bowl).{{sfn|Brosnan|de Waal|2014|p=1251776-4}}

==Findings==
===Overview===
The results and findings are mixed. In terms of refusal rates being higher in inequity conditions than equity, there is substantial variation across species, across studies, and even across individuals within the same studies. The conclusions researchers have drawn from these results are therefore also mixed.{{sfn|Talbot|Price|Brosnan|2016}} In studies that did find an overall inequity aversion effect, there were always some individuals that do not display any effect at all.{{sfn|Talbot|Parrish|Watzek|Essler|2018|p=76}} Researchers found that chimpanzees, long-tail macaques, rhesus macaques, capuchins, domestic dogs, carrion crows and ravens tend to avoid disadvantageous inequity in exchange tasks.{{sfn|Brosnan|de Waal|2014|p=1251776-4}}{{sfn|Wascher|Bugnyar|2013}} They refuse rewards if their partner receives a better one or they stop performing after multiple exposures to such inequity. No species displayed these behaviors when food was gifted without any effort.{{sfn|Brosnan|de Waal|2014|p=1251776-4}}

Orangutans,{{sfn|Brosnan|Flemming|Talbot|Mayo|2011}} squirrel monkeys,{{sfn|Talbot|Freeman|Williams|Brosnan|2011}} owl monkeys,{{sfn|Freeman|Sullivan|Hopper|Talbot|2013}} marmosets,{{sfn|Freeman|Sullivan|Hopper|Talbot|2013}} tamarins{{sfn|Neiworth|Johnson|Whillock|Greenberg|2009}} and New Caledonian crows{{sfn|Jelbert|Singh|Gray|Taylor|2015|p=1}} are not sensitive to inequity.{{sfn|Brosnan|de Waal|2014|p=1251776-4}} Gorillas have only been tested in the no-effort condition and, like all other species, did not object to being gifted lower-value food.{{sfn|Brosnan|de Waal|2014|p=1251776-4}} Pet dogs behave differently from pack dogs and wolves. Pet dogs only object to the other receiving a reward while they themselves do not get anything, but when the difference is in quality, they do not seem to mind. Pack dogs and wolves were sensitive to reward quality.{{sfn|Essler|Marshall-Pescini|Range|2017|p=1861}}

The first follow-up studies that failed to replicate the original Brosnan and de Waal conclusions subsequently were shown to have a crucial difference in experimental setup. They involved animals getting food for no effort. Later studies have shown that the effect disappears in this context.{{sfn|Massen|Van Den Berg|Spruijt|Sterck|2012|p=146}}

Studies that found evidence for inequity aversion and controlled for contrast effects ruled out that the aversion was due to mere visibility of better rewards is not the issue. This is aligned with findings animals reliably performing tasks for lesser rewards regardless of whether or not better ones are immediately in front of them.{{sfn|Brosnan|de Waal|2014|p=1251776-1}} Only Engelmann et al. did not explain reward refusal as inequity aversion. But they did not attribute the refusals to the contrast effect either. Instead, from their experiments with chimpanzees, they concluded that refusal is due to disappointment in the behavior of the human experimenter.{{sfn|Engelmann|Clift|Herrmann|Tomasello|2017|p=1}} Sheskin et al. however found no evidence that capuchins differentiated between experimenters who either distribute equal rewards or unequal ones.{{sfn|Sheskin|Ashayeri|Skerry|Santos|2014}} A few species (e.g. squirrel monkeys) respond more strongly to contrast effects than inequity; some respond to both (rhesus macaques), some seem indifferent to either condition (orangutans),{{sfn|Brosnan|de Waal|2014|p=1251776-1}} and some respond more strongly to inequity.{{sfn|Talbot|Parrish|Watzek|Essler|2018|p=80}}

In cooperative pulling tasks, individuals who are the victims of reward-monopolizing individuals punish this behavior by refusing to cooperate subsequently.{{sfn|Brosnan|de Waal|2014|p=1251776-4}} In a bar-pulling apparatus with unequal rewards capuchins still achieved success. Pairs that tended to alternate which monkey received the higher-value food were more than twice as successful in obtaining rewards than pairs in which one monkey dominated the higher-value food.{{sfn|Brosnan| Freeman|de Waal|2006|p=713}} In an experiment with chimpanzees, on almost half the trials the pair negotiated to work for the equal division.{{sfn|Melis|Hare|Tomasello|2009}}

Physical proximity is an essential ingredient for inequity aversion to appear in effortful tasks. Across species the effect virtually disappears if the animals are not side-by-side with full visibility of the action.{{sfn|Brosnan|de Waal|2014|p=1251776-1}}

Dominance rank, sex, the quality of the relationship, and reward characteristics all also influence the presence and/or strength of the reaction.{{sfn|Brosnan|de Waal|2014|p=1251776-2}} For example, within a well-established group of chimpanzees inequity aversion was less pronounced than in a newly-formed group.{{sfn|Brosnan|Schiff|de Waal|2005}} And the difference in value between the higher and lower reward matters for capuchins, as does the quality of the reward but not the quantity.{{sfn|Talbot|Parrish|Watzek|Essler|2018|p=85}} Having a barrier between the capuchins or not did not make any difference.{{sfn|Talbot|Parrish|Watzek|Essler|2018|p=84}}

Only three studies have found evidence for advantageous inequity aversion.{{sfn|Brosnan|de Waal|2014|p=1251776-4}}
Although in previous studies with chimpanzees it had never been observed, in a 2010 study with 16 captive adult chimpanzees, males and females, it was found chimpanzees that received a higher-value grape refused to participate more often when the other chimpanzee received an inferior carrot than they did when the other chimpanzee also received a grape.{{sfn|Brosnan|Talbot|Ahlgren|Lambeth|2010|p=1235}}

In another study with chimpanzees and very young children, a modified version of the Ultimatum Game, researchers gave chimpanzees a choice between a token representing five bananas for them and one for their partner, and a token representing an equal split of three bananas each. They had to pass this token to their partner who could either accept it and have it exchanged into the appropriate reward distribution, or reject it, resulting in nothing for both. Two of the four chimpanzees chose the equity token significantly more often than chance. When comparing their choices to those in a control condition, in which their partner had no option to reject the token, all four chimpanzees chose the equity token significantly more often.{{sfn|Proctor| Williamson|de Waal| Brosnan|2013|p=2071}} Respondents never rejected an offer, but they did sometimes protest, for instance by spitting water at the selfish proposer.{{sfn|Brosnan|de Waal|2014|p=1251776-5}}

Talbot, Parrish, Watzek, Essler, Leverett, Paukner, and Brosnan argue that it is likely that the results are mixed because of small procedural differences.{{sfn|Talbot|Parrish|Watzek|Essler|2018|p=85}} They acknowledge that controlling for this is hard, especially across species as procedures often have to be tailored to the species in question, for instance in terms of their size and natural behaviour.{{sfn|Talbot|Parrish|Watzek|Essler|2018|p=76}}

Brosnan ruled out the possibility that cognitive differences are driving inequity aversion, as orangutans are equally skillful in cognitive and exchange tasks as other great apes but never display the effect.{{sfn|Brosnan|Flemming |Talbot |Mayo |2011|p=66}} Brosnan and de Waal summarized the findings as inequity aversion being most pronounced in animals that cooperate outside of the bonds of mating and kinship.{{sfn|Brosnan|de Waal|2014|p=1251776-1}} Chimpanzees, bonobos, capuchins, macaques, dogs and corvids are all highly cooperative in nature and show inequity aversion; orangutans, owl and squirrel monkeys are not cooperative outside kin and do not show inequity aversion.{{sfn|Brosnan|de Waal|2014|p=1251776-4,5}}

Some researchers have questioned the ecological validity of the results of inequity aversion experiments, including their own. For many species cooperation typically occurs outside of the food domain. But all experiments testing for inequity aversion are with food.{{sfn|Raihani|McAuliffe|Brosnan|Bshary|2012}}

===Primates===
====Bonobos====
Bonobos (''Pan paniscus'') are social animals that live in less hierarchical structures than chimpanzees.{{sfn|Hare|Melis|Woods|Hastings|2007|p=619}} Researchers Bräuer, Call, and Tomasello tested bonobos, together with other great apes, twice and twice failed to find evidence of inequity aversion.{{sfn|Bräuer|Call|Tomasello|2006}}{{sfn|Bräuer|Call|Tomasello|2009}} In the first study the apes were simply given food.{{sfn|Bräuer|Call|Tomasello|2006|p=3124}} Three years later they made a few procedural changes, critically now using the token exchange paradigm.{{sfn|Bräuer|Call|Tomasello|2009|p=176}} Bonobos still did not refuse lower-value food when seeing that a partner got a better reward. The researchers argued that because in their method apes in the equity condition were shown the higher-value reward prior to receiving the lower-value reward, only their method allowed for proper comparison between inequity and equity conditions.{{sfn|Bräuer|Call|Tomasello|2009|p=179}}
Kaiser, Jensen, Call, and Tomasello designed a variant of the Ultimatum game that involved inequity being created by the proposer stealing a portion of the responder's share. They did not find any bonobo refusing any food, and proposers consistently stole food from responders, seemingly oblivious to the effect their action would have on their partner.{{sfn|Kaiser|Jensen|Call|Tomasello|2012|p=943}}

====Capuchins====
Roughly half of the studies with capuchins (''Sapajus apella'') found evidence of inequity aversion.

====Chimpanzees====
Chimpanzees (''Pan troglodytes'') are smart, social animals.{{sfn|Rekers|Haun|Tomasello|2011|p=1756}} In the wild they cooperate to hunt, dominate rival groups, and defend their territory.{{sfn|Melis|Hare|Tomasello|2006|p=275}} Most studies did not find any evidence of chimpanzees rejecting lesser rewards when partners received better, but some did. One study found evidence of chimps rejecting better rewards.

====Gorillas====
In an experiment with three other great ape species, Bräuer, Call and Tomasello subjected six gorillas to the inequity task. Apes were given food without having to perform a task.{{sfn|Bräuer|Call|Tomasello|2006|p=3124}}
The researchers did not report results specifically for gorillas, but overall for all four species the apes did not refuse food more often when a partner got better food.{{sfn|Bräuer|Call|Tomasello|2006|p=3126}}
From their controlled experiments they concluded that any food refusal is not due to inequity aversion but, most likely, their expectation. This food expectation hypothesis says that subjects have an expectation to receive the preferred food in some conditions but not others. Seeing the experimenter give favored food to a conspecific, not just being placed into an empty cage, may have created the expectation that they will get some of the favored food soon.{{sfn|Bräuer|Call|Tomasello|2006|p=3126}}
In speculating why their findings are different from Brosnan and de Waal's, Bräuer, Call and Tomasello point to procedural differences, especially giving food versus token exchange.{{sfn|Bräuer|Call|Tomasello|2006|p=3127}}{{efn-ua|Researchers van Leeuwen, Zimmermann, and Ross analyzed video of play fights in captive gorillas. Seven out of eight gorillas would hit another ape and then run away. The researchers interpreted this as the hitter getting an advantage and wanted to keep this advantage hence the running. The "victim" wants to avoid this inequity and thus chases.{{sfn|van Leeuwen|Zimmermann|Ross|2011}}}}

====Macaques====
Macaques (''Macaca spp.'') are small monkeys that live in hierarchical groups. They do not habitually use tools, hunt cooperatively or share food.{{sfn|Massen|Van Den Berg|Spruijt|Sterck|2012|p=154-155}} Two out of two studies did find evidence for equity aversion in macaques.{{sfn|Massen|Van Den Berg|Spruijt|Sterck|2012}}{{sfn|Hopper|Lambeth|Schapiro|Bernacky|2013}} Massen, Van Den Berg, Spruijt, and Sterck tested 12 long-tailed macaques in equity and inequity conditions with strangers and "friends".
The researchers hypothesized that friends pay less attention to equity than strangers and thus they predicted no or only a small effect in the friends condition. Contrary to their predictions, the macaques responded to inequity in largely the same way with a friend as with a stranger.
The monkeys only refused food significantly more when their effort was moderate. No effort or a lot of effort (the tray the subjects had to pull towards themselves was counterweighted with 2.3 kilograms) did not result in inequity aversion.{{sfn|Massen|Van Den Berg|Spruijt|Sterck|2012|p=145;149}} The researchers ruled out that refusal rates were higher due to a frustration effect because each individual monkey only ever received one type of reward. No evidence for advantageous inequity aversion was found.{{sfn|Massen|Van Den Berg|Spruijt|Sterck|2012|p=151}}

Hopper, Lambeth, Schapiro, Bernacky, and Brosnan were the first researchers to study the development of inequity aversion in animals. They first tested 20 young rhesus macaques (on average 17 months old) and found no difference in refusal rate between inequity and equity conditions. A year later they tested eight of them again and now found them refusing rewards more often in the inequity condition.{{sfn|Hopper|Lambeth|Schapiro|Bernacky|2013}}

====Marmosets====
Marmosets (''Callithrix spp.'') are small monkeys that form long-term parental pair bonds.{{sfn|Mustoe|Harnisch|Hochfelder|Cavanaugh|2016|p=70}}
In two of three experiments with marmosets evidence was found of inequity aversion.{{sfn|Freeman|Sullivan|Hopper|Talbot|2013}}{{sfn|Yasue|Nakagami|Nakagaki|Ichinohe|2018}}{{sfn|Mustoe|Harnisch|Hochfelder|Cavanaugh|2016}} Freeman, Sullivan, Hopper, Talbot, Holmes, Schultz-Darken, Williams, and Brosnan found that none of the ten marmosets they tested differed significantly in their rate of refusals among the three task conditions.{{sfn|Freeman|Sullivan|Hopper|Talbot|2013|p=4}} In contrast, Yasue, Nakagami, Nakagaki, Ichinohe, and Kawai did find a difference in their test of six marmosets required to hold a spoon for two seconds to receive a reward. The monkeys almost always successfully performed the task when they observed a partner receive the same reward, but only in 70% of trials when they witnessed the partner receiving a more attractive reward.{{sfn|Yasue|Nakagami|Nakagaki|Ichinohe|2018|p=38}} This high refusal rate was not present in another condition where five other marmosets had been exposed to valproic acid, leading the researchers to conclude that inequity aversion stems from weak social motivation.{{sfn|Yasue|Nakagami|Nakagaki|Ichinohe|2018|p=36}}

Mustoe, Harnisch, Hochfelder, Cavanaugh, and French tested eight marmosets in a tray pulling experiment, where subjects would pull a tray with food towards themselves and partners.They found evidence for inequity aversion in the four male marmosets towards their pairmates. The males did not avert inequity when paired with strangers. The neurohypophysial hormone [[oxytocin]], which has been found to modulate social behavior in primates, did not influence inequity aversion.{{sfn|Mustoe|Harnisch|Hochfelder|Cavanaugh|2016|p=69}}

====Orangutans====
Four inequity aversion studies involving orangutans (''Pongo pygmaeus''), a great ape with a semi-solitary lifestyle and not known to be great co-operators,{{sfn|Brosnan|Flemming| Talbot| Mayo| 2011|p=58}} have been published. No study found evidence of inequity aversion.
Brosnan, Flemming, Talbot, Mayo, and Stoinski used the same experimental set-up and method as the group had previously used with chimpanzees.{{sfn|Brosnan|Flemming| Talbot| Mayo| 2011|p=60}}{{sfn|Brosnan|Talbot|Ahlgren|Lambeth|2010}}
Five orangutans were put in eight different conditions, seven of which involved a token exchange. The highest refusal rate, 10%, was in the inequity condition but it did not differ significantly from the refusal rate in the equity conditions, neither the one in which both apes received a low value reward nor the one with a high-value reward.
The orangutans also did not refuse much in individual contrast conditions.{{sfn|Brosnan|Flemming| Talbot| Mayo| 2011|p=64-65}} As with many other species, in the no effort condition the refusal rate was very low.{{sfn|Brosnan|Flemming| Talbot| Mayo| 2011|p=65}}

====Owl monkeys====
Owl monkeys (''Aotus'') live in small groups of up to five individuals, usually a male and female and their offspring.
Both parents look after the children.{{sfn|Freeman|Sullivan|Hopper|Talbot|2013|p=2}} Freeman, Sullivan, Hopper, Talbot, Holmes, Schultz-Darken, Williams, and Brosnan tested three monkey species, including owl monkeys, in a variation of Brosnan and de Waal's original experiment.
Instead of a token exchange the monkeys had to reach out of their cage, pick a token and hold on to it. Apart from the non-social condition with high-value food visible but not given, another control condition was added in which there was no task at all but the animals were simply given food. The researchers found that owl monkeys did not differ in their rate of refusals among the four conditions.{{sfn|Freeman|Sullivan|Hopper|Talbot|2013|p=4}} They hypothesized that for species that provide bi-parental care the cost of having conflict with their reproductive partner may be too high to warrant a refusal reaction over a small amount of inequity.{{sfn|Freeman|Sullivan|Hopper|Talbot|2013|p=6}}

====Squirrel monkeys====
In the wild, squirrel monkeys (''Saimiri sciureus'') do not regularly cooperate.{{sfn|Freeman|Sullivan|Hopper|Talbot|2013|p=6}} Talbot, Freeman, Williams, and Brosnan tested squirrel monkeys in a token-for-food exchange experiment, with a free food and contrast conditions as controls. The monkeys did not refuse food more often in the inequity condition than in the equity condition. They refused food far less often in the free food condition than in the token exchange conditions. The male squirrel monkeys refused food the most in the contrast condition, when given inferior food after initially having been shown better food. The females refused food less often in all conditions, the least in the free-food condition. The researchers concluded that squirrel monkeys are not averse to inequity.{{sfn|Talbot|Freeman|Williams|Brosnan|2011|p=681}} Freeman, Sullivan, Hopper, Talbot, Holmes, Schultz-Darken, Williams, and Brosnan found no evidence of inequity aversion in squirrel monkeys either. They too observed a strong contrast effect: when there was no partner but a better reward present than given the monkeys refused food the most by far.{{sfn|Freeman|Sullivan|Hopper|Talbot|2013|p=4}}

====Tamarins====
Cotton-top tamarins (''Saguinus oedipus'') are New World monkeys that breed cooperatively, cooperative on tasks and tolerate food sharing.{{sfn|Neiworth|Johnson|Whillock|Greenberg|2009|p=11}}
Neiworth, Johnson, Whillock, and Greenberg tested 11 tamarins in six conditions.
In one of the conditions, the effort+food inequity condition, the subjects were given the less preferred food as reward for a token exchange, whereas the partners were just handed the more preferred food for no effort.
The highest rejection rates were in the food control condition, with low-value food given while preferred food was present. The researchers did find some evidence of inequity aversion, but only by comparing results from the first set of trials to the last in the food inequity condition of the token exchange task. In the non-social conditions this significant rise in rejections was not found. The researchers equated this finding to the original Brosnan and de Waal study and attributed it to an increasing aversion to the perceived inequity. Curiously, in the effort+food inequity condition the rejection rates did not rise significantly. The researchers theorised that the animals judged the situation differently as the partner did not have to act, not triggering the equity comparison scheme.{{sfn|Neiworth|Johnson|Whillock|Greenberg|2009|p=15-16}}

McAuliffe, Shelton, Stone tested the reaction of 12 cotton-top tamarins to inequity in a personalised handle pulling task. The researchers suspected that the amount of effort involved is a key factor in inequity aversion and therefore designed a tray pulling task with weights, after having calibrated how much weight each subject was willing to pull for food. In the inequity conditions the subjects had to exert a lot of effort for little food while their partners received more food for no effort. The researchers found weak support for the influence of effort on
inequity aversion, largely driven by one female.{{sfn|McAuliffe | Shelton |Stone|2014}}

===Other mammals===
====Dogs====
McGetrick and Range reviewed seven studies into inequity aversion in dogs.{{sfn|McGetrick|Range|2018|p=1}}
Range, Horn, Virányi, and Huber found a negative reaction to an all-or-nothing distribution of rewards, in an experimental setup similar to Brosnan's original work, with the task of giving a paw. However, there was no effect when the distribution was uneven in quality. The researchers concluded that dogs possess a primitive form of disadvantageous inequity aversion.{{sfn|McGetrick|Range|2018|p=4}}{{sfn|Range|Horn|Virányi| Huber|2009}} Brucks, Essler, Marshall-Pescini, and Range replicated this study with 32 pet dogs and came to the same conclusion, as did Essler, Marshall-Pescini, and Range in their study comparing pack dogs and wolves.{{sfn|McGetrick|Range|2018|p=4}}{{sfn|Brucks|Essler| Marshall-Pescini|Range|2016}}{{sfn|Essler|Marshall-Pescini|Range|2017}}

Using an experimental paradigm involving choice, Horowitz failed to find evidence for inequity aversion in dogs.{{sfn|Horowitz|2012}} When dogs were given the choice between a fair trainer or an unfair trainer who had created advantageous inequity, they had no preference. When given the choice between a fair trainer or an unfair trainer who had created disadvantageous inequity, they chose the latter. Because of various confounds, most notably the absence of a partner at the time of choice, McGetrick and Range did not consider these results to challenge the previous findings.{{sfn|McGetrick|Range|2018|p=5}} Brucks, Marshall-Pescini, Essler, McGetrick, Huber, and Range obtained results in their buzzer task study with pet dogs that does represent a legitimate challenge to earlier findings.
Dogs were asked to press a buzzer with their paw in exchange for food rewards.
Refusals rates to continue differed in conditions but were simply due to the absence of reward and not related to comparison with what the partner received.
The dogs did exhibit significantly more stress signals in the reward inequity condition.
McGetrick and Range summarized all findings as we should continue on the assumption that dogs display a primitive form of inequity aversion.{{sfn|McGetrick|Range|2018|p=6}}

====Rats====
Rats often develop in social groups, cooperate naturally, have been found to reciprocate, and generally display behavior that benefits others.{{sfn|Hernandez-Lallement|van Wingerden|Marx|Srejic|2015|p=1}}
Hernandez-Lallement, van Wingerden, Marx, Srejic, and Kalenscher tested 68 rats in a series of maze experiments where the animals could choose between a path that lead to rewards just for them or for a partner as well.{{sfn|Hernandez-Lallement|van Wingerden|Marx|Srejic|2015|p=1}}
Most rats chose the option that rewarded both significantly more, albeit with a small margin (55% versus 45%).{{sfn|Hernandez-Lallement|van Wingerden|Marx|Srejic|2015|p=5}} In a control condition the researchers replaced the partner rat with a toy lookalike.
In this condition, the rats chose the option to just reward themselves more.
The researchers concluded that rats derive value from another rat’s access to food.{{sfn|Hernandez-Lallement|van Wingerden|Marx|Srejic|2015|p=5}}
They attributed the relatively small size of the effect to individual differences. About 60% of rats showed this pro-social behavior.{{sfn|Hernandez-Lallement|van Wingerden|Marx|Srejic|2015|p=6}}
In a similar experiment with 23 rats, Oberliessen, Hernandez-Lallement, Schable, van Wingerden, Seinstra, and Kalenscher found supporting evidence of inequity aversion.{{sfn|Oberliessen|Hernandez-Lallement|Schable|van Wingerden|2016}}

====Wolves====
Essler, Marshall-Pescini, and Range found evidence wolves reject uneven reward distributions.{{sfn|Essler| Marshall-Pescini|Range|2017}}

===Birds===
====Crows====
Carrion crows (''Corvus corone corone'') are smart, social birds from the corvids family.{{sfn|Wascher|Bugnyar|2013|p=1}} Researchers Wascher and Bugnyar tested six crows in a setup similar to the original Brosnan and de Waal study.{{sfn|Wascher|Bugnyar|2013|p=1}}
The exchange rate was higher in the equity condition than in the inequity condition. The effect was strongest with high quality food.{{sfn|Wascher|Bugnyar|2013|p=4}}

====Kea====
Kea (''Nestor notabilis'') are social parrots that live in social groups. Although in lab settings they have displayed cooperative behaviour, in the wild they do not appear to cooperate.{{sfn|Heaney|Gray|Taylor|2017|p=1}}{{sfn|Heaney|Gray|Taylor|2017b|p=1}}
Researchers Heaney, Gray, and Taylor presented four male kea with a series of token exchange conditions, with the birds side by side, so they could see their partner's behaviour.
They found that the success rate did not differ significantly between the four conditions involving rewards
(inequity condition, equity condition, free gift condition, and food control condition, in which both kea were shown a high-value food but upon token exchange only received a low-value reward).
A significant drop in success rate was observed in the condition where the subject received nothing while the partner did.
The researchers concluded that this is not due to any social factor, as the drop in rate was similar to the one observed in the no partner + no reward condition.
Based on these results the researchers concluded that kea are not sensitive to inequity.{{sfn|Heaney|Gray|Taylor|2017}}

====Ravens====
Ravens (''Corvus corax'') are large-brained corvids that in the wild form coalitions and cooperate.{{sfn|Wascher|Bugnyar|2013|p=1}} Researchers Wascher and Bugnyar tested four raven on their behaviorial response to inequity in a token exchange task.{{sfn|Wascher|Bugnyar|2013}}
Two ravens never refused food in any condition. When the ravens were rewarded with low-value food after their partner received better quality food, they were more likely to exchange the token or refuse the reward.{{sfn|Wascher|Bugnyar|2013|p=5}}
Most striking were the results in the condition were the partner simply was given food but the subject had to work for it. Here the ravens had the lowest success rate.{{sfn|Wascher|Bugnyar|2013|p=6}}
The researchers speculated that this might be due to expectation setting when observing another individual receiving food and thus makes it less likely to exchange.{{sfn|Wascher|Bugnyar|2013|p=6}}
Refusing food is unusual behavior, and even more so after exchanging a token. Ravens are also known to place high value on objects others are interested in.
Because of their low sample size they were cautious to come to conclusions but it seems that ravens reject unfair offers even at a cost to themselves.{{sfn|Wascher|Bugnyar|2013|p=7-8}}

===Fish===
====Cleaner fish====
[[Bluestreak cleaner wrasse]]s (''labroides dimidiatus'') are [[cleaner fish]], found in [[coral reef]]s, that engage in [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]] with other aquatic animals by feeding on their surface [[ectoparasite]]s, [[mucus]] and dead skin.
Clients prefer having their ectoparasites being removed; they do not like cleaners cheating by biting off surface mucus or dead skin. Sometimes a male and female cleaner wrasse jointly clean a client. Males punish females for cheating because it often results in the end of the feeding session. This suggests cleaner fish may be aware of the payoffs accrued by an interaction partner.{{sfn|Raihani|McAuliffe|Brosnan|Bshary|2012}}
Researchers Raihani, McAuliffe, Brosnan, and Bshary tested two sets of cleaner fish (12 and 10 individuals) on their sensitivity to unequal outcomes. The fish had to perform a task to provide food rewards for themselves and a partner. They were equally likely to work when their partner received higher-value rewards or same-value rewards. There was no significant difference whether their partner was unfamiliar and of the opposite sex or familiar and of the same sex. The researchers provided two possible explanations for these results. It may be that the fish did not see or attend to the food distribution prior to performing their task. Alternatively, cleaner wrasses may not be inequity averse.{{sfn|Raihani|McAuliffe|Brosnan|Bshary|2012}}

==Evolution==
Almost all researchers explain the findings of animals refusing less-preferred food while others receive more-preferred food in terms of inequity aversion and a sense of fairness. The cost of foregoing a low-value food when the partner gets a high-value reward is low. It's worth to reject, protest and possibly get something better. The cost of foregoing a high-value food when the partner gets an even higher-value reward is high, not worth protesting about and risk being left empty-handed.{{sfn|Talbot|Parrish|Watzek|Essler|2018|p=83}} Comparing one's gains to those of others makes evolutionary sense. If individuals were satisfied with any absolute benefit, they might still face negative fitness consequences if they were doing less well than competing others.{{sfn|Brosnan|2006}} But this applies only in the context of extensive cooperation outside of kinship relationships.{{sfn|Brosnan|de Waal|2014|p=1251776-3}}

One explanation of the findings so far is that inequity aversion evolves in order to foster long-term cooperation between unrelated individuals. In particular, Brosnan suggests that responding to inequity facilitates partner choice. This increases an individual’s fitness by enabling them to reject partnerships which repeatedly lead to unequal outcomes. In support of this, inequity aversion is found in highly-cooperative capuchins, but not in the closely related, less cooperative squirrel monkey; and in cooperative chimpanzees, but not in typically less cooperative orangutans.{{sfn|Jelbert|Singh|Gray|Taylor|2015|p=2}}
The finding that kea, smart but not cooperating in the wild, did not display aversion to inequity supports this as well.{{sfn|Heaney|Gray|Taylor|2017}} This theory predicts that domestic cats are far less sensitive to inequity than dogs.{{sfn|Brosnan|de Waal|2014|p=1251776-5}}

The main explanation for disadvantageous inequity aversion is anticipatory conflict resolution. The animal anticipates their partner reacting negatively to disadvantageous inequity and thus rejects the better reward, or in the case of the Ultimatum Game, favours the equity token over the favorable one. Researchers have speculated that the reason why it is limited to chimpanzees and capuchins is that it requires the cognitive capability of planning, anticipating their partner's disadvantageous inequity aversion. Few species have this capacity. Chimpanzees have shown their ability to plan ahead in other contexts, for instance in tool use. Advantageous inequity aversion may also directly benefit an individual by enhancing its reputation, which may increase that individual’s long-term access to beneficial relationships.{{sfn|Brosnan|de Waal|2014|p=1251776-5}}

Including evidence from canines, Essler, Marshall-Pescini, and Range conclude that it is possible that sensitivity to inequity was already present in an earlier common ancestor with primates. Alternatively, [[convergent evolution]] may be at play: under similar conditions the same behavior has emerged multiple times in evolution.{{sfn|Essler|Marshall-Pescini|Range|2017|p=1864}} Basing their argument partly on the facts that female chimpanzees often range solitarily  and avert inequity less than males, Brosnan, Flemming, Talbot, Mayo, and Stoinski state the most likely hypothesis is that natural selection favours those who care how their outcomes compare to others.  The level and intensity of cooperation may be less relevant for female chimps than for males, which may reduce the need for the building of social expectations among females.{{sfn|Brosnan |Flemming |Talbot |Mayo |2011|p=67}}
Kim, Choe, Jeong, and Kim state it is an open question whether orangutans have lost or chimpanzees have acquired a sense of fairness in the hominid lineage.{{sfn|Kim|Choe|Jeong|Kim|2018}}

While the controlled experiments have advanced the understanding of inequity aversion, their context cannot include all possible outcomes that exist in natural social interactions. In the standard inequity task, refusals only hurt the actor, whereas in a natural social context, protest against inequity may lead to the actor either receiving a larger share or seeking out a better partner to work with.{{sfn|Brosnan|de Waal|2014|p=1251776-2}}

'''''Les Caquets de l'accouchée''''' is an anonymous French [[satire]] composed of several quires published in 1622. They were reunited in 1623 under the title « ''Recueil général des Caquets de l'Accouchée'' ».&lt;ref&gt;{{harvsp|Antoine Le Roux de Lincy|1855|p=v}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title refers to the custom, documented by the middle of the fifteenth, of Parisian bourgeoises to visit when one of them is layered.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvsp|Antoine Le Roux de Lincy|1855|p=x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The narrator introduces himself as a convalescing [[History of Paris|Parisian]] to whom a doctor has prescribed to recuperate through entertainment and goes {{Interlanguage link multi|rue Quincampoix|fr}} to listen to gossip with her cousin who has just given birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvsp|Antoine Le Roux de Lincy|1855|p=xv-xvi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Antoine Le Roux de Lincy]], this book, which details various aspects of Parisian life and specifically quotes the personalities of the time covering topics such as politics and religion can be "now classified as historical works, faithful echoes of prejudices and opinions of a period".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvsp|Antoine Le Roux de Lincy|1855|p=xxxii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lutheran art''' consists of all [[religious art]] produced for Lutherans and the [[Lutheran Church]]es. This includes sculpture, painting, and architecture. Artwork in the Lutheran Churches arose as a distinct marker of the faith during the [[Reformation]] era and attempted to illustrate, supplement and portray in tangible form the teachings of Lutheran theology.

== Reformation era ==
[[File:Lucas Cranach - Verdammnis und Erlösung.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[Law and Gospel (Cranach)|Law and Gospel]]'', by Lutheran painter [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] and [[Lucas Cranach the Younger]] (1536).]]
[[Martin Luther]], the founder of the [[Lutheran Church]]es, encouraged the display of some religious imagery in churches, seeing the Evangelical Lutheran Church as a continuation of the "ancient, apostolic church".&lt;ref name="Lamport2017-138"/&gt; He defended the use of "importance of images as tools for instruction and aids to devotion",&lt;ref name="Naaeke2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Naaeke|first=Anthony Y.|title=Kaleidoscope Catechesis: Missionary Catechesis in Africa, Particularly in the Diocese of Wa in Ghana| year=2006|publisher=Peter Lang|language=Engish|isbn=9780820486857|page=114|quote=Although some reformers, such as John Calvin and Ulrich Zwingli, rejected all images, Martin Luther defended the importance of images as tools for instruction and aids to devotion.}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating that "If it is not a sin but good to have the image of Christ in my heart, why should it be a sin to have it in my eyes?"&lt;ref name="Noble2009"&gt;Noble, 67-69&lt;/ref&gt; 

His attitude towards images became more positive after his dispute with [[Andreas Karlstadt]] began in 1521. Luther had left Karlstadt in effective charge of his church in [[Wittenberg]] when he went into retreat in the [[Wartburg]], but Karlstadt introduced a considerably more [[Radical Reformation]] than Luther approved, which included the removal of all religious images from churches.  As with the later Calvinist programmes of complete destruction of images, this aroused more popular opposition than other aspects of the radical innovations, and Luther's support for images was in part an attempt to distinguish his positions from more radical ones, as well as an attempt to avoid stirring up opposition over an issue he did not see as central. 

Luther also understood the value of [[Propaganda_during_the_Reformation#Protestant_propaganda|crude polemical woodcuts]] in the propaganda battle, and commissioned some himself.  He also appears to have worked personally with artists to develop didactic compositions that were used as book frontispieces, including for the [[Luther Bible]] which had an elaborate [[Book frontispiece|frontispiece]] in all early editions, prints, and relatively small versions in oils. ''[[Law and Gospel (Cranach)|Law and Gospel]]'' (1529) by the Lutheran painter [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] is the earliest painting of this type,&lt;ref&gt;Noble, 1, 12-14 on the extent of Cranach's "Lutheranism" in the early years&lt;/ref&gt; painted in different versions, and turned into a [[woodcut]].  Several share a similar composition, divided vertically into two by a tree, also found in many polemical prints; typically there is a good side and a bad side. Lutheran [[Catechism#Lutheran_catechisms|catechism]]s, an important means of disseminating Lutheran teachings among the congregations, were often illustrated with woodcuts, as were [[prayerbook]]s and other religious literature.&lt;ref&gt;Heal (2017), 33-38&lt;/ref&gt;

In the beginning of Lutheranism's spread to German territories in the 1520s and 1530s, local ordinances set out a variety of treatments of existing imagery in churches.  Where, as was sometimes the case, nothing was said, it is presumed that it was intended that many images could be retained. In the Lutheran churches of Nuremberg, for example, "side altars, sacrament houses and saints' shrines provided (and continue to provide) the visual backdrop for evangelical worship".&lt;ref&gt;Heal (2017), 46&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere, depending on the views of the ruler or council, all images were to be removed, as in [[Hesse]] in 1526, although Martin Luther objected to this decision, apparently ineffectively.&lt;ref name="Heal2017"&gt;Heal (2017), 43-45. "In Hesse, for example, the Homberg Synod that met in 1526 at the behest of Landgrave Phillip made no concessions with regard to images: all should be removed, whatever the status and subject matter. Although Luther objected to the conclusions reached by this synod, Phillip again decreed the removal of images in 1527."&lt;/ref&gt; Some ordinances specified that only "images near and before which particular worship and idolatry and special honour with candles and lights have been practiced" should be removed but also emphasized that "we may not be iconoclasts", in the words of a [[Hamburg]] ordinance of 1529.&lt;ref&gt;Heal (2017), 43-44&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Brandenburg]], an injunction was pronounced to retain 'altars...images and paintings' and in [[Württemberg]], images that were neglected or damaged were restored or replaced.&lt;ref&gt;Heal (2017), 52&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Augsburg Interim]] and [[Leipzig Interim]] settled the issue, both pronouncing that sacred art would be preserved in the Lutheran Churches, though they would not be the focal point of worship, thus making the Lutheran position a ''via media'' between what Lutheran theologians perceived as 'Roman Catholic idolatry' and 'Calvinist iconoclasm'.&lt;ref&gt;Heal (2017), 51&lt;/ref&gt;

A few Lutheran [[altarpiece]]s, including those of the [[Last Supper]], were commissioned under the purview of Martin Luther. The ''Schneeberg Altarpiece'' was placed at the [[high altar]] of [[St. Wolfgang im Salzkammergut]] and as Lutheran sacred imagery, reflected "the devotional forms of fifteenth- and early sixteenth-century northern art".&lt;ref name="Noble2009"/&gt; The ''Schneeberg Altarpiece'' (1539), along with the ''Wittenberg Altarpiece'' (1547) and the ''Weimar Altarpiece'' (1555), were Christocentric in their iconography and "these altarpieces reinforced the key teachings of the new church and helped consolidate a sense of confessional identity."&lt;ref name="Cameron2016"/&gt; In eastern Germany, Lutheran patrons erected some thirty new altarpieces.&lt;ref name="KatznelsonRubin2016"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Katznelson|first1=Ira|last2=Rubin|first2=Miri|title=Religious Conversion: History, Experience and Meaning|date=8 April 2016|publisher=Routledge|language=English|isbn=9781317067009|page=109-112}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most pre-Reformation altarpieces were preserved within Lutheran churches as the "altar was still believed to be a particularly holy place, and should be adorned accordingly."&lt;ref name="2016KatznelsonRubin"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Katznelson|first1=Ira|last2=Rubin|first2=Miri|title=Religious Conversion: History, Experience and Meaning|date=2016 |publisher=Routledge|language=English|isbn=9781317067009|page=109-112|quote=In most Lutheran territories, however, altars and altarpieces were not only preserved, but they also continued to be used and were even commissioned anew. Lutheran commitment to the doctrine of Christ's real presence undoubtedly provides the key to understanding this visual conservatism. The altar was still believed to be a particularly holy place, and should be adorned accordingly.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Lutheran sacred art gained a new function in addition to exciting one's mind to thoughts of the Divine by also serving a didactic purpose.&lt;ref name="Noble2009"/&gt; Cranach's ''[[Law and Gospel (Cranach)|Law and Gospel]]'', for example, "enshrines the specific authority of the word of the Bible by including biblical passages as prominent parts of the composition."&lt;ref name="Cameron2016"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cameron|first=Euan|title=The New Cambridge History of the Bible: Volume 3, From 1450 to 1750 |date=1 September 2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|language=English|isbn=9781316351741|page=1198-1339}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lutheranism was responsible for "an explosion of creativity in the graphic arts" with works such as ''Passional Christi und Antichristi'' by [[Philipp Melanchthon]], being described as "richly illustrated".&lt;ref name="Cameron2016"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/luthers-anti-papist-pamphlet-passional-christi-und-antichristi-1521|title=Luther's anti-papist pamphlet, Passional Christi und Antichristi, 1521  - The British Library|publisher=[[British Library]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With respect to the [[Divine Service (Lutheran)|Divine Service]], "Lutheran worship became a complex ritual choreography set in a richly furnished church interior."&lt;ref name="Spicer2016"&gt;{{cite book|last=Spicer|first=Andrew|title=Lutheran Churches in Early Modern Europe| date=5 December 2016|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|language=English|isbn=9781351921169|page=237|quote=As it developed in north-eastern Germany, Lutheran worship became a complex ritual choreography set in a richly furnished church interior. This much is evident from the background of an epitaph painted in 1615 by Martin Schulz, destined for the Nikolaikirche in Berlin (see Figure 5.5.).}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ornate church interiors in Lutheran churches reflected [[Eucharist in Lutheranism|Lutheran Eucharistic theology]], which taught the [[real presence of Christ in the Eucharist]] as a [[sacramental union]].&lt;ref name="Lamport2017-138"&gt;Lamport, 138. "Lutherans continued to worship in pre-Reformation churches, generally with few alterations to the interior. It has even been suggested that in Germany to this day one finds more ancient Marian altarpieces in Lutheran than in Catholic churches. Thus in Germany and in Scandinavia many pieces of medieval art and architecture survived. [[Joseph Leo Koerner]] has noted that Lutherans, seeing themselves in the tradition of the ancient, apostolic church, sought to defend as well as reform the use of images. "An empty, white-washed church proclaimed a wholly spiritualized cult, at odds with Luther's doctrine of Christ's real presence in the sacraments" (Koerner 2004, 58). In fact, in the 16th century some of the strongest opposition to destruction of images came not from Catholics but from Lutherans against Calvinists: "You black Calvinist, you give permission to smash our pictures and hack our crosses; we are going to smash you and your Calvinist priests in return" (Koerner 2004, 58). Works of art continued to be displayed in Lutheran churches, often including an imposing large crucifix in the sanctuary, a clear reference to Luther's ''theologia crucis''. ... In contrast, Reformed (Calvinist) churches are strikingly different.

== Baroque period ==
[[File:Dresden Martin Luther statue in front of Frauenkirche 04.JPG|thumb|Bronze statue of Martin Luther, in front of the [[Dresden Frauenkirche|Lutheran Church of Our Lady]], by Adolf von Donndorf. (1885)]]
Artists who designed Lutheran Baroque art not only took their inspiration from Martin Luther, but from popular Lutheran piety in the latter part of the 16th and 17th centuries.&lt;ref name="Heal2018"/&gt; The [[Dresden Frauenkirche]] serves as a prominent example of Lutheran Baroque art, which was completed in 1743 after being commissioned by the Lutheran city council of Dresden:&lt;ref name="Heal2011"/&gt;
{{quotation|From the pulpit beside the entrance to the choir area the pure Word of God was preached against a truly magnificent visual backdrop. With its imposing high altar, showing in sculpted relief the emotive scene of Christ in prayer on the Mount of Olives, its splendid organ and its cupola with paintings of the evangelists and virtues by Giovanni Battista Grone, the interior of the Frauenkirche embraces illusion, even illusion dependent on the techniques of the Italian baroque. The Frauenkirche rivalled contemporary Catholic churches in its beauty and splendour and was, in fact, compared by eighteenth-century observers to St Peter’s in Rome.&lt;ref name="Heal2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heal|first=Bridget|date=1 December 2011|title=‘Better Papist than Calvinist’: Art and Identity in Later Lutheran Germany|journal=German History|publisher=German History Society|volume=29|issue=4|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In the second half of the 17th century, high baroque art continued to spread through Saxony, under the rule of [[John George II, Elector of Saxony|Johann Georg II]].&lt;ref name="Heal2011"/&gt; Pieces like the altar of Johanneskirche resembled the ''[[Descent from the Cross]]'' by [[Peter Paul Rubens]].&lt;ref name="Heal2011"/&gt;

More typically, [[Daniel Hisgen]] (1733-1812) was a German painter of the [[rococo]] period who worked as a painter of Lutheran churches in [[Upper Hesse]], specializing on cycles of paintings decorating the front of the gallery parapet in churches with an upper gallery. His discreet cycles demonstrate the modest prominence expected of Lutheran art in German churches of his day, taking a middle route between the large and prominent images in Catholic churches, and the complete absence of images in Calvinist ones.

== 19th century ==
[[File:Maria and martha church bautzen 102.JPG|thumb|Sculpture around the entrance to a [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] Lutheran church in [[Bautzen]], [[Saxony]].]]
In the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Denmark]], several Lutheran altarpieces were designed and housed within parish churches.&lt;ref name="ELCD2017"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lutheranchurch.dk/nc/liturgy-and-worship/symbols-and-art/the-altarpiece/?print=1|title=The Altarpiece: A Long Tradition|year=2017|publisher=[[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Denmark]]|language=English|accessdate=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these were designed by artists such as [[Carl Bloch]] and [[Joakim Skovgaard]].&lt;ref name="ELCD2017"/&gt;

== Present day ==
With respect to artwork adorning Lutheran churches in the modern era:
{{quotation|Lutheran places of worship contain images and sculptures not only of Christ but also of biblical and occasionally of other saints as well as prominent decorated pulpits due to the importance of preaching, stained glass, ornate furniture, magnificent examples of traditional and modern architecture, carved or otherwise embellished altar pieces, and liberal use of candles on the altar and elsewhere.&lt;ref name="Lamport2017-138"/&gt;}}

Within the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Denmark, religious artists including [[Arne Haugen Sørensen]], [[Peter Brandes]], [[Hein Heinsen]] and [[Maja Lisa Engelhardt]] continue to design Lutheran art today.&lt;ref name="ELCD2017"/&gt; It has been claimed that more pre-Reformation [[Lutheran Marian theology|Marian]] altarpieces survive in German Lutheran churches than Catholic ones,&lt;ref name="Lamport2017-138"/&gt; where many were replaced in the Baroque period.

A '''major stationary source''' is a source that emits more than a certain amount of a [[pollutant]] as defined by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA). The amount of pollutants allowed for certain new sources is defined by the EPA's [[New Source Performance Standard]]s (NSPS).

A '''stationary source''' in air quality terminology is any fixed emitter of air pollutants, such as [[fossil fuel]] burning [[power plant]]s, [[petroleum refineries]], [[Petrochemical|petrochemical plants]], [[Food processing|food processing plants]] and other heavy industrial sources.

A '''mobile source''' in air quality terminology is a non-stationary source of air pollutants, such as automobiles, buses, trucks, ships, trains, aircraft and various other vehicles.

The '''Marsh funnel''' is a simple device for measuring [[viscosity]] by observing the time it takes a known volume of liquid to flow from a cone through a short tube.  It is standardized for use by [[mud engineer]]s to check the quality of [[drilling mud]].  Other cones with different geometries and orifice arrangements are called ''flow cones'', but have the same operating principle.

In use, the funnel is held vertically with the end of the tube closed by a finger.  The liquid to be measured is poured through the mesh to remove any particles which might block the tube.  When the fluid level reaches the mesh, the amount inside is equal to the rated volume.  To take the measurement, the finger is released as a stopclock is started, and the liquid is allowed to run into a measuring container.  The time in seconds is recorded as a measure of the viscosity.
[[File:Marsh funnel top view.jpg|thumb|right|Marsh Funnel top view showing the mesh through which drilling fluid is poured to retain particles which would not pass through the orifice.]]

==The Marsh Funnel==
Based on a method published in 1931 by H.N.Marsh,&lt;ref name=Marsh1931&gt;H. N. Marsh (1931)''Trans AIME'' vol 92 pp 234-251 "Properties and Treatment of Rotary Mud"&lt;/ref&gt; a Marsh cone is a flow cone with an [[aspect ratio]] of 2:1 and a working volume of at least a litre.  A Marsh funnel is a Marsh cone with a particular orifice and a working volume of 1.5 litres.  It consists of a cone 6 inches (152&amp;nbsp;mm) across and 12 inches in height (305&amp;nbsp;mm) to the apex of which is fixed a tube 2 inches (50.8&amp;nbsp;mm) long and 3/16 inch (4.76&amp;nbsp;mm) internal diameter.  A 10-mesh screen is fixed near the top across half the cone.&lt;ref name=API13B&gt;{{Citation |title=13B-1 Recommended Standard Procedure for Field Testing Water-Based Drilling Fluids |year=1990 | publication-place=Dallas |publisher=American Petroleum Institute |url=http://www.pngis.net/standards/6400/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In American practice (and most of the [[oil industry]]) the volume collected is a quart.  If water is used, the time should be 26 +/- 0.5 seconds.&lt;ref name=API13B/&gt; If the time is less than this the tube is probably enlarged by erosion, if more it may be blocked or damaged, and the funnel should be replaced.  In some companies, and Europe in particular, the volume collected is a litre, for which the water funnel time should be 28 seconds.  Marsh himself collected 0.50 litre, for which the time was 18.5 seconds.&lt;ref name=Marsh1931/&gt;

The Marsh funnel time is often referred to as the Marsh funnel viscosity, and represented by the abbreviation FV.  The unit (seconds) is often omitted.  Formally, the volume should also be stated.
The (quart) Marsh funnel time for typical drilling muds is 34 to 50 seconds, though mud mixtures to cope with some geological conditions may have a time of 100 or more seconds.&lt;ref&gt;A. W. McCray &amp; F. W. Cole (1979) ''Oil Well Drilling Technology'' University of Oklahoma Press {{ISBN|0-8061-0423-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the most common use is for [[drilling mud]]s, which are [[non-Newtonian fluid]]s, the Marsh funnel is not a [[rheometer]], because it only provides one measurement under one flow condition.  However the effective viscosity can be determined from following simple formula.&lt;ref name=Pitt&gt;M. J. Pitt (2000) ''SPE Drilling and Completion'' vol 15 no1  pages 3-6 “The Marsh Funnel and Drilling Fluid Viscosity: A New Equation for Field Use”&lt;/ref&gt;

μ = ρ (t - 25)

where μ = effective viscosity in [[Poise (unit)|centipoise]]&lt;br /&gt; ρ = density in g/cm³&lt;br /&gt;t = quart funnel time in seconds

For example, a mud of funnel time 40 seconds and density 1.1 g/cm³ has an effective viscosity of about 16.5 cP.  For the range of times of typical muds above, the [[shear rate]] in the Marsh funnel is about 2000 &lt;sup&gt;−s&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Pitt/&gt;

==Other Flow Cones==
The term '''Marsh cone''' is also used in the [[concrete]] and [[oil industry|oil industries]].  European standard EN445&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=BS EN445:1997 Grout for prestressing tendons - test methods |publisher=British Standards Institute |year=1997 |url=http://shop.bsigroup.com/en/SearchResults/?q=EN+445&amp;ib=1&amp;snc=Y }}&lt;/ref&gt; and American standard C939&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=ASTM C939-10 Standard Test Method for Flow of Grout |publisher=ASTM International |year=2010 |url=http://www.astm.org/Standards/C939.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; for measuring the flow properties of [[cement]] [[grout]] mixtures specify a funnel similar to the Marsh cone.  Some manufacturers supply devices which they call Marsh cones, with removable tubes with size ranges from 5 to 15&amp;nbsp;mm.  These can be used for quality control by selecting a tube which gives a convenient time, say 30 to 60 seconds.

[[File:Blotting Compass for Molecular Probes.png|thumb|right|alt=A compass of molecular probes]]

A '''molecular probe''' is a group of [[atoms]] or [[molecules]] used in [[molecular biology]] or [[chemistry]] to study the properties of other molecules or structures. If some measurable property of the molecular probe used changes when it interacts with the [[analyte]] (such as a change in [[absorbance]]), the interactions between the probe and the analyte can be studied. This makes it possible to indirectly study the properties of compounds and structures which may be hard to study directly. The choice of molecular probe will depend on which compound or structure is being studied as well as on what property is of interest. Radioactive [[DNA]] or [[RNA]] sequences are used in [[molecular genetics]] to detect the presence of a [[complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] sequence by molecular [[Nucleic acid hybridization|hybridization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/omd?molecular+probes | title = Cancerweb Molecular Probe Definition }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Newgrange''' ({{lang-ga|Sí an Bhrú}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logainm.ie/1166689.aspx|title=Sí an Bhrú /Newgrange|work=logainm.ie|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Brú na Bóinne'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beingintime.net/d-n-notes.html Day and Night endnotes]. Being in Time.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[prehistory|prehistoric]] [[monument]] in [[County Meath]], Ireland, located {{convert|8|km}} west of [[Drogheda]] on the north side of the [[River Boyne]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Kelly, Michael J. 1982. ''Newgrange: Archaeology, Art and Legend''. London: Thames and Hudson. Page 13.&lt;/ref&gt; It is an exceptionally grand [[passage tomb]] built during the [[Neolithic]] period, around 3200 BC, making it older than [[Stonehenge]] and the [[Egyptian pyramids]]. 

The site consists of a large circular mound with an inner stone passageway and chambers. Human bones and possible [[grave goods]] or [[votive offering]]s were found in these chambers. The mound has a retaining wall at the front, made mostly of white quartz cobblestones, and it is ringed by engraved kerbstones. Many of the larger stones of Newgrange are covered in [[megalithic art]]. The mound is also ringed by a [[stone circle]]. Some of the material that makes up the monument came from as far away as the [[Mourne Mountains|Mournes]] and [[Wicklow Mountains]]. There is no agreement about what the site was used for, but it is believed that it had religious significance. Its entrance is aligned with the rising sun on the [[winter solstice]], when sunlight shines through a '[[roofbox]]' and floods the inner chamber. Several other [[Passage grave|passage tombs]] in Ireland are aligned with solstices and equinoxes, and Cairn G at [[Carrowkeel Megalithic Cemetery|Carrowkeel]] has a similar 'roofbox'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=897049982 Carrowkeel Cairn G].

It is the most famous monument within the Neolithic [[Brú na Bóinne]] complex, alongside the similar passage tomb mounds of [[Knowth]] and [[Dowth]], and as such is a part of the Brú na Bóinne [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]. Newgrange consists of approximately 200,000 tonnes of rock and other materials. It is {{convert|85|m}} wide at its widest point.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=First Light: The origins of Newgrange|last=Hensey|first=|publisher=Oxbow Books|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After its initial use, Newgrange was sealed for several millennia. It continued to feature in [[Irish mythology]] and [[folklore]], in which it is said to be a dwelling of [[Tuatha Dé Danann|the deities]], particularly [[The Dagda]] and his son [[Aengus]]. [[Antiquarians]] first began its study in the seventeenth century, and [[archeology|archaeological]] excavations took place at the site in the years that followed. Archaeologist [[Michael J. O'Kelly]] led the most extensive of these and also reconstructed the frontage of the site in the 1970s, a reconstruction that is controversial and disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.irishtimes.com/news/newgrange-got-new-lease-of-light-and-life-in-1960s-rebuild-1.1275165 | publisher = Irish Times | date=20 December 2008 | title= Newgrange got new lease of light and life in 1960s 'rebuild' }}&lt;/ref&gt; Newgrange is a popular tourist site and, according to the archaeologist [[Colin Renfrew]], is "unhesitatingly regarded by the prehistorian as the great national monument of Ireland" and as one of the most important megalithic structures in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Renfrew, Colin, in O'Kelly, Michael J. 1982.

==Physical description==

===Mound and passage tomb===
[[File:Wakeman Newgrange tumulus chamber cross section.png|thumb|right|Cross section sketch of the passage]]
The Newgrange monument primarily consists of a large mound, built of alternating layers of earth and stones, with grass growing on top and a reconstructed facade of flattish white [[quartz]] stones studded at intervals with large rounded [[cobblestone|cobbles]] covering part of the circumference. The mound is {{Convert|76|m|ft}} across and {{Convert|12|m|ft}} high, and covers {{convert|4500|m2|acre}} of ground. Within the mound is a chambered passage, which may be accessed by an entrance on the southeastern side of the monument. The passage stretches for 19 metres (60&amp;nbsp;ft),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newgrange.com/|title=Newgrange|work=newgrange.com|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; or about a third of the way into the centre of the structure. At the end of the passage are three small chambers off a larger central chamber with a high [[Corbel arch|corbelled]] vault roof. Each of the smaller chambers has a large flat "basin stone" where the bones of the dead may have been deposited during prehistoric times. Whether it was a burial site remains unclear. The walls of this passage are made up of large stone slabs, twenty-two of which are on the western side and twenty-one on the eastern side. They average 1½ metres in height;&lt;ref&gt;O'Kelly (1982:21)&lt;/ref&gt; several are decorated with carvings (as well as graffiti from the period after the rediscovery). The ceiling shows no evidence of smoke.
[[File:Newgrange, Meath.jpg|thumb|The entrance passage to Newgrange, and the entrance stone]]
Situated around the perimeter of the mound is a circle of [[standing stones]]. Twelve standing-stones survive out of a possible original thirty-five or thereabouts. Most archaeologists suggest that they were added later, during the [[Bronze Age]], centuries after the original monument had been abandoned as a ritual centre.

===Art===
[[File:Ireland 2010 etc 079.jpg|thumb|right|Megalithic art on one of the kerbstones]]
[[File:Newgrange Stone Age Passage Tomb - Boyne Valley, Ireland (6961311036) (2).jpg|thumb|The retaining wall and kerbstones]]
Newgrange contains various examples of [[graphics|graphic]] Neolithic rock art carved onto its stone surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Nechvatal]], ''Immersive Ideals / Critical Distances''. [[LAP Lambert Academic Publishing]]. 2009, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; These carvings fit into ten categories, five of which are curvilinear (circles, spirals, arcs, serpentiniforms, and dot-in-circles) and the other five of which are rectilinear (chevrons, lozenges, radials, parallel lines, and offsets). They are marked by wide differences in style, the skill-level needed to produce them, and on how deeply carved they are.&lt;ref&gt;O'Kelly (1982:146–147).&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most notable types of art at Newgrange are the [[triskelion|triskele]]-like features found on the entrance stone. It is approximately three metres long and 1.2 metres high (10&amp;nbsp;ft long and 4&amp;nbsp;ft high), and about five tonnes in weight. It has been described as "one of the most famous stones in the entire repertory of [[megalithic art]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ó Ríordáin |first=Seán P. |author2=Glyn, Edmund Daniel  |title= New Grange and the Bend of the Boyne |publisher=F.A. Praeger |date= 1964 |pages=26}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=4bs9AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=newgrange+entrance+slab+famous+megalithic+art&amp;dq=newgrange+entrance+slab+famous+megalithic+art&amp;num=100&amp;ei=FCU0SKHXIpCkzgTjwpjLDw&amp;pgis=1]&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologists believe that most of the carvings were produced prior to the stones being erected, although the entrance stone was carved in situ before the kerbstones were placed alongside it.&lt;ref&gt;O'Kelly (1982:149).&lt;/ref&gt;

Various archaeologists have speculated as to the meanings of the designs, with some, such as [[George Coffey]] (in the 1890s), believing them to be purely decorative, whilst others, such as [[Michael J. O'Kelly]] (who led the 1962–1975 excavation at the site), believed them to have some sort of [[symbol]]ic purpose, because some of the carvings had been in places that would not have been visible, such as at the bottom of the orthostatic slabs below ground level.&lt;ref&gt;O'Kelly (1982:148).&lt;/ref&gt; Extensive research on how the art relates to alignments and astronomy in the Boyne Valley complex was carried out by American-Irish researcher, Martin Brennan.

==History==
The Neolithic people who built the monument were native agriculturalists, growing crops and raising animals such as cattle in the area where their settlements were located.

===Construction and burials===
The original complex of Newgrange was built between c. 3200 and 3100&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name="WHS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldheritageireland.ie/bru-na-boinne/built-heritage/newgrange/|title=Newgrange|publisher=Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs| date= |first= |last=|accessdate=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Radiocarbon dating|carbon-14 dates]],&lt;ref&gt;E. Grogan, "Prehistoric and Early Historic Cultural Change at Brugh na Bóinne", ''Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy'' 91C, 1991, pp. 126–132&lt;/ref&gt; it is approximately five hundred years older than the current form of [[Stonehenge]] and the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] in Egypt, as well as predating the [[Mycenaean culture]] of [[ancient Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Kelly (1982:48)&lt;/ref&gt; Some put its period of construction somewhat later, at 3000 to 2500 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grant|first=Jim|title=The archaeology coursebook|date=2008|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-46286-0|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BgRG99HriOUC&amp;pg=PA159q=newgrange#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|author2=Sam Gorin |author3=Neil Fleming |accessdate=17 August 2011|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geological analysis indicates that the thousands of pebbles that make up the [[cairn]], which together would have weighed about 200,000 tonnes, came from the nearby [[Fluvial terrace|river terraces]] of the Boyne. There is a large pond in this area that is believed to be the site quarried for the pebbles by the builders of Newgrange.&lt;ref name="O'Kelly 1982:117"/&gt; Most of the 547 slabs that make up the inner passage, chambers, and the outer kerbstones are [[greywacke]]. Some or all of them may have been brought from sites approximately 5&amp;nbsp;km away,&lt;ref name="tilley160"&gt;Tilley, Christopher. ''Body and Image: Explorations in Landscape Phenomenology''. Left Coast Press, 2008. p.160&lt;/ref&gt; from the rocky beach at [[Clogherhead]], [[County Louth]], about 20&amp;nbsp;km to the northeast. The facade and entrance were built with white quartz cobblestones from the [[Wicklow Mountains]], about 50&amp;nbsp;km to the south; dark rounded [[granodiorite]] cobbles from the [[Mourne Mountains]], about 50&amp;nbsp;km to the north; dark [[gabbro]] cobbles from the [[Cooley Mountains]]; and banded [[siltstone]] from the shore at [[Carlingford Lough]].&lt;ref name="tilley160"/&gt; The stones may have been transported to Newgrange by sea and up the River Boyne by fastening them to the underside of boats at low tide.&lt;ref name=Benozzo&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; None of the structural slabs were quarried, for they show signs of having been weathered naturally, so they must have been collected and then transported, largely uphill, to the Newgrange site.&lt;ref name="O'Kelly 1982:117"&gt;O'Kelly (1982:117)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[granite]] basins found inside the chambers also came from the Mournes.&lt;ref name="tilley160"/&gt;

[[George Francis Mitchell|Frank Mitchell]] suggested that the monument could have been built within a space of five years, basing his estimation upon the likely number of local inhabitants during the Neolithic and the amount of time they could have devoted to building it rather than farming. This estimate, however, was criticised by Michael. J. O'Kelly and his archaeological team, who believed that it would have taken a minimum of thirty years to build.&lt;ref&gt;O'Kelly (1982:117–118)&lt;/ref&gt;

Excavations have revealed deposits of both burnt and unburnt human bone in the passage, indicating human corpses had been placed within it, some of whom had been [[cremation|cremated]]. From examining the unburnt bone, it was shown to come from at least two separate individuals, but much of their skeletons was missing, and what was left had been scattered about the passage.&lt;ref&gt;O'Kelly (1982:105–106)&lt;/ref&gt; Various [[grave goods]] were deposited alongside the bodies inside the passage. Excavations that took place in the late 1960s and early 1970s revealed seven 'marbles', four pendants, two beads, a used flint flake, a bone chisel, and fragments of bone pins and points.&lt;ref&gt;O'Kelly (1982:105)&lt;/ref&gt; Many more artifacts had been found in the passage in previous centuries by visiting antiquarians and tourists, although most of these were removed and went missing or held in private collections. Nonetheless, sometimes these were recorded and it is believed that the grave goods that came from Newgrange were typical of Neolithic Irish passage grave assemblages.&lt;ref&gt;O'Kelly (1982:107)&lt;/ref&gt; The remains of animals also have been found in the structure, primarily those of [[mountain hare]]s, rabbits, and dogs, but also of [[bat]]s, sheep, goats, cattle, [[song thrush]]es, and more rarely, [[mollusc|molluscs]] and frogs. Most of these animals would have entered and died in the chamber many centuries or even millennia after it was constructed: for instance, rabbits were only introduced to Ireland in the thirteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;O'Kelly (1982:215–216)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Newgrange (BM).JPG|thumb|right|Gold jewellery from Roman times deposited in the mound (British Museum)]]

During much of the [[Neolithic]] period, the Newgrange area continued to be a focus of some ceremonial activity. In the Late Neolithic, it appears that Newgrange was no longer being used by the local population, who did not leave any artefacts in the structure or bury their dead there. As the archaeologist Michael J. O'Kelly stated, "by 2000 [BC] Newgrange was in decay and squatters were living around its collapsing edge".&lt;ref name="O'Kelly 1982:145"&gt;O'Kelly (1982:145).&lt;/ref&gt; These people were adherents of the [[Beaker culture]], which had been imported from mainland Europe, and made Beaker-style pottery locally.&lt;ref name="O'Kelly 1982:145"/&gt; A large [[timber circle]] (or henge) was built to the southeast of the main mound and a smaller timber circle to the west. The eastern timber circle consisted of five concentric rows of pits. The outer row contained wooden posts. The next row of pits had clay linings and was used to burn animal remains. The three inner rows of pits were dug to accept the animal remains. Within the circle were post and stake holes associated with Beaker pottery and [[flint]] flakes. The western timber circle consisted of two concentric rows of parallel [[posthole]]s and pits defining a circle {{convert|20|m}} in diameter.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} A concentric mound of [[clay]] was constructed around the southern and western sides of the mound that covered a structure consisting of two parallel lines of post and ditches that had been partly burnt. A free-standing circle of large stones was raised around the Newgrange mound. Near the entrance, seventeen [[hearth]]s were used to set fires. These structures at Newgrange are generally contemporary with a number of [[henge]]s known from the [[Boyne Valley]], at Newgrange Site A, Newgrange Site O, [[Dowth]] Henge, and Monknewtown Henge.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

The site evidently continued to have some ritual significance into the [[Iron Age]]. Among various objects later deposited around the mound are two pendants made from gold [[Roman Empire|Roman]] coins of 320–337 AD (now in the [[National Museum of Ireland]]) and Roman gold jewellery including two bracelets, two finger rings, and a necklace, now in the collections of the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?place=5016&amp;plaA=5016-3-1|title=British Museum - Collection search: You searched for|work=British Museum|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Purpose===

There have been various debates as to its original purpose. Many archaeologists believed that the monument had religious significance of some sort or another, either as a place of worship for a "cult of the dead" or for an astronomically-based faith. The archaeologist [[Michael J. O'Kelly]], who led the 1962–1975 excavations at the site, believed that the monument had to be seen in relation to the nearby [[Knowth]] and [[Dowth]], and that the building of Newgrange "cannot be regarded as other than the expression of some kind of powerful force or motivation, brought to the extremes of aggrandizement in these three monuments, the cathedrals of the megalithic religion."&lt;ref name="O'Kelly 1982:122"&gt;O'Kelly (1982:122)&lt;/ref&gt; O'Kelly believed that Newgrange, alongside the hundreds of other passage tombs built in Ireland during the Neolithic, showed evidence for a religion that venerated the dead as one of its core principles. He believed that this "cult of the dead" was just one particular form of European Neolithic religion, and that other megalithic monuments displayed evidence for different religious beliefs that were solar-oriented, rather than ancestor-oriented.&lt;ref name="O'Kelly 1982:122"/&gt;
[[File:Newgrange at a distance.jpg|thumb|right|View of Newgrange's elevation]]
Studies in other fields of expertise offer alternative interpretations of the possible functions, however, which principally centre on the astronomy, engineering, geometry, and mythology associated with the Boyne monuments. It is speculated that the sun formed an important part of the religious beliefs of the Neolithic people who built it. One idea was that the room was designed for a ritualistic capturing of sun rays on the shortest day of the year, the [[Winter Solstice]], as the room gets flooded with sunlight, which might have signaled that the days would start to get longer again. This view is strengthened by the discovery of alignments in [[Knowth]], [[Dowth]], and the [[Lough Crew]] Cairns leading to the interpretation of these monuments as calendrical or astronomical devices. 

Formerly, the Newgrange mound was encircled by an outer ring of immense standing stones, of which twelve of a possible thirty-seven remain. Evidence from carbon dating suggests that the stone circle which encircled Newgrange may not be contemporary with the monument however, but was placed there some 1,000 years later in the [[Bronze Age]]. This view is disputed and relates to a carbon date from a standing stone setting that intersects with a later timber post circle, the theory being, that the stone in question could have been moved and later, re-set in its original position. This research implies a continuity of use of Newgrange of over a thousand years; with partial remains found from only five individuals, some question the tomb theory for its purpose.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Once a year, at the Winter Solstice, the rising sun shines directly along the long passage, illuminating the inner chamber and revealing the carvings inside, notably the [[triple spiral]] on the front wall of the chamber. This illumination lasts for approximately 17 minutes.&lt;ref name="solstice" /&gt; Michael J. O'Kelly was the first person in modern times to observe this event on 21 December 1967.&lt;ref name="firstmodernobservation"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.meath.ie/Tourism/Heritage/Newgrange/| title = Brú na Bóinne (Newgrange, Knowth and Dowth)| accessdate = 12 October 2007| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071012040152/http://www.meath.ie/Tourism/Heritage/Newgrange/| archivedate = 12 October 2007| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sunlight enters the passage through a specially contrived opening, known as a [[roofbox]], directly above the main entrance. Although solar alignments are not uncommon among passage graves, Newgrange is one of few to contain the additional roofbox feature. ([[Cairn]] G at [[Carrowkeel Megalithic Cemetery]] is another, and it has been suggested that one can be found at Bryn Celli Ddu.&lt;ref&gt;Pitts (2006) Sensational new discoveries at Bryn Celli Ddu. British Archaeology No. 89 (July/August): 6.&lt;/ref&gt;) The alignment is such that although the roofbox is above the passage entrance, the light hits the floor of the inner chamber. Today the first light enters about four minutes after sunrise, but calculations based on the [[precession]] of the Earth show that 5,000 years ago, first light would have entered exactly at sunrise.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} The solar alignment at Newgrange is very precise compared to similar phenomena at other passage graves such as [[Dowth]] or [[Maes Howe]] in the [[Orkney Islands]], off the coast of [[Scotland]].

==Discovery, excavation, and restoration==

===Mythology and folklore during Medieval and Early Modern periods===
During the [[Middle Ages|medieval period]], Newgrange and the wider [[Brú na Bóinne]] Neolithic complex gained various attributes in local [[folklore]], which was often connected to figures from wider [[Irish mythology]]. The monuments of the Brú were thought of by some as being the abode of the supernatural [[Tuatha De Danann]], whilst others considered them to be the burial mounds of the ancient kings of [[Hill of Tara|Tara]]. Amongst those who believed the folkloric tales relating the Brú to the Tuatha De Danann, it was commonly thought that they were the abode of the most powerful of the Tuatha, particularly [[The Dagda]], his wife [[Boann]], and his son, [[Aengus|Oengus]]. According to the eleventh-century ''[[Book of Lecan]]'', the Dagda had built the Brú for use by his family, whilst the twelfth-century ''[[Book of Leinster]]'' describes how Oengus tricked his father into giving him the Brú for all eternity. Another text, ''The Pursuit of Diarmaid and Grainne'' also implies that Oengus owned the Brú, when he declared how he took his friend [[Diarmaid]] to it.&lt;ref&gt;O'Kelly (1982:43–46)&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometime after 1142 the structure became part of outlying farmland owned by the [[Mellifont Abbey|Cistercian Abbey of Mellifont]]. These farms were referred to as 'granges'. Newgrange is not mentioned in any of the early charters of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, but an ''[[wikt:inspeximus|Inspeximus]]'' granted by [[Edward III]] in 1348 includes a ''Nova Grangia'' among the [[demesne]] lands of the abbey.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/27728922 "An Important Mellifont Document." ''Journal of the County Louth Archaeological Society'', vol. 14, no. 1, 1957, pp. 1–13. ]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 July 1539, following the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] by [[Henry VIII]], Mellifont Abbey and its demesnes became the fortified mansion of an English soldier of fortune, Edward Moore, ancestor of the [[Earls of Drogheda]].&lt;ref&gt;Geraldine Stout, ''Newgrange and the Bend of the Boyne'', Cork University Press, Cork (2002), pp. 85, 102&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 August 1699, Alice Moore, Countess Dowager of Drogheda, leased the demesne of Newgrange to a [[Williamite]] settler, Charles Campbell, for 99 years.&lt;ref&gt;Stout (2002:128)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antiquarianism during seventeenth and eighteenth centuries===
[[File:Bru na Boinne Squire.jpg|thumb|right|The entrance to Newgrange in the late 1800s, when the mound had become largely overgrown]]
In 1699, a local landowner, Charles Campbell, ordered some of his farm labourers to dig up a part of Newgrange, which then had the appearance of a large mound of earth, so that he could collect stone from within it. The labourers soon discovered the entrance to the tomb within the mound, and a Welsh [[antiquarianism|antiquarian]] named [[Edward Lhwyd]], who was staying in the area, was alerted and took an interest in the monument. He wrote an account of the mound and its tomb, describing what he saw as its "barbarous sculpture" and noting that animal bones, beads, and pieces of glass had been found inside of it (modern archaeologists have speculated that these latter two were in fact the polished pottery beads that subsequently have been found at the site and that were a common feature of Neolithic tombs).&lt;ref&gt;O'Kelly (1982:24)&lt;/ref&gt; Soon another antiquarian visitor, [[Sir Thomas Molyneux, 1st Baronet|Sir Thomas Molyneaux]], professor at the [[University of Dublin]], also came to the site. He talked to Charles Campbell, who informed him that he had found the remains of two human corpses in the tomb, one (which was male), in one of the cisterns, and another farther along the passageway, something that Lhwyd had not noted.&lt;ref&gt;O'Kelly (1982:27)&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Newgrange was visited by a number of antiquarians, who often performed their own measurements of the site and made their own observations, which often were published in various antiquarian journals; these included such figures as [[Sir William Wilde]], Thomas Pownall, [[Thomas Wright (antiquarian)|Thomas Wright]], [[John O'Donovan (scholar)|John O'Donovan]], [[George Petrie (artist)|George Petrie]], and [[James Frederic Ferguson|James Ferguson]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Kelly (1982:33–34)&lt;/ref&gt;

These antiquarians often concocted their own theories about the origins of Newgrange, many of which have since been proved incorrect. [[Thomas Pownall]] conducted a very detailed survey of New Grange in 1769,&lt;ref&gt;Archaeologia Vol 2, 1773. A Description of the Sepulchral Monument of New Grange, near Drogheda, in the County of Meath, in Ireland. By Thomas Pownall, Esq. in a letter to the Rev. Gregory Sharpe, D.D. Master of the Middle Temple. Read at the Society of Antiquaries, June 21/28 1770. Archaeologia Vol 2, pp.236-276 [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=njp.32101076451119;view=1up;seq=338]&lt;/ref&gt; which numbers all the stones and also records some of the carvings on the stone and asserted that the mound originally had been taller and a lot of the stone on top of it had been removed, a theory that has been disproven by archaeological research.&lt;ref&gt;O'Kelly (1982:33)&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of these antiquarians also refused to believe that it was ancient peoples native to Ireland who built the monument, with many believing that it had been built in the early medieval period by invading [[Vikings]], whilst others speculated that it had been built by the [[ancient Egypt]]ians, ancient Indians, or the [[Phoenicians]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Kelly (1982:35)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern conservation, archaeological investigation, and reconstruction ===
[[File:Newgrange (8294082764).jpg|thumb|The entrance to Newgrange in the early 1900s, after much of the debris had been cleared]]
At some time in the early 1800s, a [[folly]] was built a few yards behind Newgrange. The folly, with two circular windows, was made of stones taken from Newgrange. In 1882, under the Ancient Monuments Protection Act, Newgrange and the nearby monuments of Knowth and Dowth were taken under the control of the state (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, as it was then known), and they were placed under the responsibility of the Board of Public Works. In 1890, under the leadership of [[Thomas Newenham Deane]], the board began a project of conservation of the monument, which had been damaged through general deterioration over the previous three millennia as well as the increasing vandalism caused by visitors, some of whom had inscribed their names on the stones.&lt;ref&gt;O'Kelly (1982:38–39)&lt;/ref&gt; In subsequent decades, a number of [[archaeology|archaeologists]] performed excavations at the site, discovering more about its function and how it had been built; however, even at the time, it was still mistakenly believed by archaeologists to be built during the [[Bronze Age]] rather than during the earlier Neolithic period.&lt;ref&gt;O'Kelly (1982:42)&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s, electric lighting was installed in the passageway to allow visitors to see more clearly,&lt;ref&gt;O'Kelly (1982:41)&lt;/ref&gt; whilst an exhaustive archaeological excavation was undertaken from 1962 through to 1975, the excavation report of which was written by Michael J. O'Kelly and published in 1982 by [[Thames and Hudson]] as ''Newgrange: Archaeology, Art and Legend''.&lt;ref&gt;O'Kelly (1982:09)&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the O'Kelly excavation, further restoration and reconstruction took place at the site. Based on the positions of the cobblestones, and after conducting experiments, O'Kelly concluded that they had made up a [[retaining wall]], but had fallen from the face of the mound. As part of the restoration, this wall was 'rebuilt' and the cobblestones were fixed into a near-vertical steel-[[reinforced concrete]] wall surrounding the front of the mound. This work is controversial among the archaeological community. P. R. Griot described the monument as looking like a "cream cheese cake with dried currants distributed about."&lt;ref name="Giot 1983"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Giot|first=P.-R.|title=Review: Newgrange: archaeology, art and legend.|journal=Antiquity|year=1983|volume=57|issue=220|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neil Oliver]] described the reconstruction as "a bit brutal, a bit overdone, kind of like Stalin does the Stone Age".&lt;ref&gt;"A History of Ancient Britain" Series 1 episode 3, "Age of Cosmology", BBC documentary, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of the new wall claim that the technology to fix a retaining wall at this angle did not exist when the mound was created.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} Another theory is that some, or all, of the white quartz cobblestones had formed a plaza on the ground at the entrance. This theory was preferred at nearby [[Knowth]], where the restorers laid the quartz stones out as an "apron" in front of the entrance to the great mound.

The inward-curving dark stone walls on each side of the entrance are not original, nor are they intended to suggest Newgrange's original appearance, but were designed solely to facilitate visitor access. A visitor guide book to the site, however, has a reconstruction drawing depicting Neolithic inhabitants using Newgrange that shows the modern entrance as if it were part of Newgrange's original appearance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.knowth.com/excavation.htm Alan Marshall, "Newgrange Excavation Report Critique"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location and access==

Newgrange is located {{Convert|8.4|km|}} west of [[Drogheda]] in [[County Meath]]. The interpretive centre is located on the south bank of the river and Newgrange is located on the north side of the river. Access is only from the interpretive centre.

Access to Newgrange is by guided tour only. Tours begin at the [[Brú na Bóinne Visitor Centre]] from which visitors are taken to the site in groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heritageireland.ie/en/midlands-eastcoast/brunaboinnevisitorcentre/ Heritage Ireland]&lt;/ref&gt; Current-day visitors to Newgrange are treated to a guided tour and an re-enactment of the Winter Solstice experience through the use of high-powered electric lights situated within the tomb. The finale of a Newgrange tour results in every visitor standing inside the tomb where the tour guide then turns off the lights, and then turns on ones simulating the sunlight that would appear on the winter solstice.

To experience the phenomenon on the morning of the Winter Solstice from inside Newgrange, visitors to Bru Na Bóinne Visitor Centre must enter an annual lottery at the centre. Of the thousands who enter, twenty are chosen each year. The winner is permitted to bring a single guest. The winners are split into groups of ten and taken in on the five days around the solstice in December when sunlight can enter the chamber, weather permitting.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newgrange.com/solstice-lottery.htm "Newgrange Winter Solstice Lottery Draw"]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{globalize|article|USA|date=December 2010}}
{{Onesource|date=February 2015}}

'''Onsite''' (or '''on-site''') '''sewage facilities''' ('''OSSF''') are [[wastewater]] systems designed to treat and dispose of effluent on the same property that produces the wastewater.

A [[septic tank]] and [[Septic drain field|drainfield]] combination is a fairly common type of on-site sewage facility in the United States. OSSFs account for approximately 25% of all domestic [[wastewater treatment]] in the United States. Onite sewage facilities may also be based on small-scale [[Aerobic organism|aerobic]] and [[biofilter]] units, [[Membrane bioreactor|membrane bioreactors]] or [[Sequencing batch reactor|sequencing batch reactors]]. These can be thought of as scaled down versions of municipal [[sewage treatment]] plants.

==Process description==
[[File:Septic field.jpg|thumb|Septic field (background) in public park at [[Wallendbeen]], Australia]]
The primary mechanism of biological waste recycling in the natural environment is performed by other organisms such as animals, insects, soil microorganisms, plants, and fungi, which consume all available nutrients in the waste, leaving behind fully decomposed solids that become part of [[topsoil]], and pure [[drinking water]] that has been stripped of everything that can possibly be consumed and utilized. This natural biological purification requires time and space to process wastes.

In virtually all engineered onsite sewage facilities, recycling and decomposition by natural organisms is still the primary mechanism of sewage disposal. Giving the organisms the time they need to decompose wastes is accomplished by establishing minimum sewage retention and settling times, and minimum liquid flow distances between sewage disposal sites and [[surface water]] or [[water well]]s.

===Differences===
It is normal for animals such as mice, rats, flies, and parasites to participate in the fully natural biological waste recycling process. Engineered facilities typically attempt to exclude them to prevent out of control population explosions and [[infestation]], and prevent spread of [[vermin]] and [[disease]].

Although the solids collected by onsite sewage facilities can potentially be used as compost to build topsoil, these solids are often incompletely decomposed due to either a lack of onsite storage space to wait for decomposition (municipal facilities), or because the solids are being stacked in a layered structure of new waste solids on top of previously decomposed solids (septic tanks and outhouses). Due to the incomplete state of decomposition, when removed from an onsite sewage facility, these solids are typically referred to as ''sludge'' rather than ''compost'', and have powerful offensive odors arising from the microorganisms still consuming nutrients in the sludge. 

Engineered facilities that use water suspension to transport solids (private septic systems and municipal facilities) typically form a floating layer in their primary settling tank, consisting of low-density liquids such as oils, buoyant solids, and soap foam. This is referred to as ''scum'' and is slowly decomposed by microorganisms, eventually falling to the bottom of the settling tank as part of the sludge. When private septic tanks are emptied of solids, the tank is typically vacuumed empty and the incompletely digested scum is added to the incompletely digested sludge, further adding to its aroma and bioactivity.

If left completely undisturbed and exposed to the open air through a vent, the sludge and scum in a settling tank will eventually be turned completely into low-odor compost. By building two tanks side by side, and diverting sewage between them, one tank can be allowed to rest while the other is in use, and the resting tank can be safely and easily cleaned out by hand before it is used again. This has been proposed as a solution for onsite sewage facilities in subsistence agriculture economies where hand labor is the most abundant.

Although human body waste is no different from the waste of any other animal, municipal facilities may be required to bury the collected solids in landfills, due to the risk of toxic contaminants placed into the shared communal sewage system, by humans unaware of the harm they are causing. Municipal facilities may also collect runoff from roadways, which contains traces of all the various chemicals used in vehicles such as brake fluid and engine oil, and those used in melting ice and snow.  Private septic systems typically do not experience these issues, as the homeowner is directly aware that they must not pour toxic chemicals down the drain.

==Improving treatment through performance requirements==

Most onsite wastewater treatment systems are of the conventional type, consisting of a septic tank and a subsurface wastewater infiltration system (SWIS). Site limitations and more stringent performance requirements have led to significant improvements in the design of wastewater treatment systems and how they are managed. Over the past 20 years the onsite wastewater treatment system (OWTS) industry has developed many new treatment technologies that can achieve high performance levels on sites with size, soil, ground water, and landscape limitations that might preclude installing conventional systems. New technologies and improvements to existing technologies are based on defining the performance requirements of the system, characterizing wastewater flow and pollutant loads, evaluating site conditions, defining performance and design boundaries, and selecting a system design that addresses these factors.

Performance requirements can be expressed as numeric criteria (e.g., pollutant concentration or mass loading limits) or narrative criteria (e.g., no odors or visible sheen) and are based on the assimilative capacity of regional ground water or surface waters, water quality objectives, and public health goals. Wastewater flow and pollutant content help define system design and size and can be estimated by comparing the size and type of facility with measured effluent outputs from similar, existing facilities. Site evaluations integrate detailed analyses of regional hydrology, geology, and water resources with site specific characterization of soils, slopes, structures, property lines, and other site features to further define system design requirements and determine the physical placement of system components.

Most of the alternative treatment technologies applied today treat wastes after they exit the septic tank; the tank retains settleable solids, grease, and oils and provides an environment for partial digestion of settled organic wastes. Post-tank treatment can include aerobic (with oxygen) or anaerobic (with no or low oxygen) biological treatment in suspended or fixed-film reactors, physical/chemical treatment, soil infiltration, [[trickling filters|fixed-media filtration]], and/or disinfection. The application and sizing of treatment units based on these technologies are defined by performance requirements, wastewater characteristics, and site conditions.

==Usage==
===United States===
In the United States, on site sewage facilities collect, treat, and release about {{convert|4|e9USgal|m3}} of treated effluent per day from an estimated 26 million homes, businesses, and recreational facilities nationwide (U.S. Census Bureau, 1997). Recognition of the impacts of onsite systems on ground water and surface water quality (e.g., nitrate and bacteria contamination, nutrient inputs to surface waters) has increased interest in optimizing the systems' performance. [[Public health]] and environmental protection officials now acknowledge that onsite systems are not just temporary installations that will be replaced eventually by centralized sewage treatment services, but permanent approaches to treating wastewater for release and reuse in the environment. Onsite systems are recognized as viable, low-cost, long-term, decentralized approaches to wastewater treatment if they are planned, designed, installed, operated, and maintained properly (USEPA, 1997). NOTE: In addition to existing state and local oversight, decentralized wastewater treatment systems that serve more than 20 people might become subject to regulation under the USEPA's Underground Injection Control Program, although EPA has proposed not to include them (64FR22971:5/7/01).

Although some onsite wastewater management programs have functioned successfully in the past, problems persist. Most current onsite regulatory programs focus on permitting and installation.

Few programs address onsite system operation and maintenance, resulting in failures that lead to unnecessary costs and risks to public health and water resources. Moreover, the lack of coordination among agencies that oversee land use planning, zoning, development, water resource protection, public health initiatives, and onsite systems causes problems that could be prevented through a more cooperative approach. Effective management of onsite systems requires rigorous planning, design, installation, operation, maintenance, monitoring, and controls.

====Public health and water resource impacts====
State and tribal agencies report that onsite septic systems currently constitute the third most common source of [[groundwater pollution]] and that these systems have failed because of inappropriate siting or design or inadequate long-term maintenance (USEPA, 1996a). In the 1996 Clean Water Needs Survey (USEPA, 1996b), states and tribes also identified more than 500 communities as having failed septic systems that have caused public health problems. The discharge of partially treated sewage from malfunctioning onsite systems was identified as a principal or contributing source of degradation in 32 percent of all harvest-limited shellfish growing areas. Onsite wastewater treatment systems have also contributed to an overabundance of nutrients in ponds, lakes, and coastal estuaries, leading to the excessive growth of algae and other nuisance aquatic plants (USEPA, 1996b). In addition, onsite systems contribute to contamination of drinking water sources. USEPA estimates that 168,000 viral illnesses and 34,000 bacterial illnesses occur each year as a result of consumption of drinking water from systems that rely on improperly treated ground water. Malfunctioning septic systems have been identified as one potential source of ground water contamination (USEPA, 2000).

=== Europe ===
The potential market volume of on-site treatment is suggested to be about 35 million [[Population equivalent|population equivalents]] for Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eggimann S., Truffer, B., Feldmann, U., Maurer, M.|year=2018|title=Screening European market potentials for small modular wastewater treatment systems – an inroad to sustainability transitions in urban water management?|journal=Land use Policy|volume=78|pages=711-725|doi=10.1016/j.landusepol.2018.07.031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Political history''' is the narrative and analysis of political events, ideas, movements, organs of government, voters, parties and leaders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/hi/DicHist/analytic/anaV.html Politics: The historical development of economic, legal, and political ideas and institutions, ideologies and movements.] In ''The Dictionary of the History of Ideas''.&lt;/ref&gt; It is interrelated to other fields of history, especially [[diplomatic history]], as well as constitutional history and [[public history]].

Political history studies the organization and operation of power in large societies. By focusing on the elites in power, on their impact on society, on popular response, and on the relationships with the elites in other [[social history]], which focuses predominantly on the actions and lifestyles of ordinary people,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/jsh/39.3/parthasarathi.html/facts.about.me Parthasarathi, Prasannan, "The State and Social History]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[people's history]], which is historical work from the perspective of the common people.

In two decades from 1975 to 1995, the proportion of professors of history in American universities identifying with [[social history]] rose from 31% to 41%, and the proportion of political historians fell from 40% to 30%.&lt;ref&gt;Diplomatic dropped from 5% to 3%, economic history from 7% to 5%, and cultural history grew from 14% to 16%.

==Political world history ==
{{main|history of political thinking}}

The [[political history of the world]] is the history of the evolution of the political events, ideas, movements, leaders and entities, and the way these elements shape society as a whole; Special importance is their crystallisation into political entities such as republics, empires and so on; and the study of [[Diplomatic history|the international relations between them]].  Together with this descriptive analysis, the [[history of political thinking]] narrates the evolution of the political ideas and philosophy, and goes back to antiquity. Political history, and thus the history of political thinking throughout human existence stretches though up to Medieval period and the Renaissance. In the Age of Enlightenment, political entities expanded from basic systems of self-governance and monarchy to the complex democratic and communist systems that exist of the Industrialied and the Modern Era, in parallel, political systems have expanded from vaguely defined frontier-type boundaries, to the definite boundaries existing today.

==Aspects of political history==
The first "scientific" political history was written by [[Leopold von Ranke]] in Germany in the 19th century.  His methodologies profoundly affected the way historians critically examine sources; see [[historiography]] for a more complete analysis of the methodology of various approaches to history. An important aspect of political history is the study of [[ideology]] as a force for historical change. One author asserts that "political history as a whole cannot exist without the study of ideological differences and their implications."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/cp/vol-02/no-02/author/ Freeman, Joanne B., "Founding Bothers"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629093305/http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/cp/vol-02/no-02/author/ |date=2007-06-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of political history typically centre around a single [[nation]] and its political change and development. Some historians identify the growing trend towards narrow specialization in political history during recent decades: "while a college professor in the 1940s sought to identify himself as a "historian", by the 1950s "American historian" was the designation."&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard J. Jensen]], Historiography of American Political History. In Jack Greene, ed., ''Encyclopedia of American Political History'' (New York: Scribner's, 1984), vol 1. pp 1-25&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1970s onwards, new movements challenged traditional approaches to political history. The development of [[social history]]  shifted the emphasis away from the study of leaders and national decisions, and towards the role of ordinary people, especially outsiders and minorities. Younger scholars shifted to different issues, usually focused on race, class and gender, with little room for elites. After 1990 social history itself began to fade, replaced with postmodern and cultural approaches that rejected grand narrative.

===United States: The new political history===
Traditional political history focused on major leaders and had long played a dominant role among academic historians in the United States. These studies accounted for about 25% of the scholarly books and articles written by American historians before 1950, and about 33% into the 1960s, followed by diplomacy. The arrival in the 1960s and 1970s of a new interest in [[social history]] led to the emergence of the "new political history" which saw young scholars put much more emphasis on the voters' behavior and motivation, rather than just the politicians.&lt;ref&gt;Allan G. Bogue, "United States: The 'new' political history." ''Journal of Contemporary History'' (1968) 3#1 pp: 5-27. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/259964 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allan G. Bogue, "The new political history in the 1970s." in Michael G. Kammen, ed., ''The Past Before Us: Contemporary Historical Writing in the United States'' (1980) pp: 231-251.&lt;/ref&gt;  It relied heavily on quantitative methods to integrate social themes, especially regarding ethnicity and religion.&lt;ref&gt;Robert P. Swierenga, "Ethnocultural political analysis: a new approach to American ethnic studies," ''Journal of American Studies'' (1971) 5#1 pp: 59-79.&lt;/ref&gt; The new social science approach was a harbinger of the fading away of interest in Great Men. The eclipse of traditional political approaches during the 1970s was a major shock, though diplomatic history fell even further. It was upstaged by social history, with a race/class/gender model. The number of political articles submitted to the ''Journal of American History'' fell by half from 33% to 15%. Patterson argued that contemporary events, especially the Vietnam War and Watergate, alienated younger scholars away from the study of politicians and their deeds.  Political history never disappeared, but it never recovered its dominance among scholars, despite its sustained high popularity among the reading public.&lt;ref&gt;James T. Patterson,  "The Persistence of Political History" in  Richard S. Kirkendall, ed. ''The Organization of American Historians and the Writing and Teaching of American History'' (2011)  pp 67-74; his statistical estimates appear on pp 70, 72&lt;/ref&gt;  Some political historians made fun of their own predicament, as when [[William Leuchtenburg]] wrote, "the status of the political historians within the profession has sunk to somewhere between that of a faith healer and a chiropractor.  Political historians were all right in a way, but you might not want to bring one home to meet the family."&lt;ref&gt;William Leuchenburg, "The Pertinence of Political History: Reflection on the Significance of the State In America," ''Journal of American History''  (Dec. 1986) 73:585-600 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1902978 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  Others were more analytical, as when Hugh Davis Graham observed:
:The ranks of traditional political historians are depleted, their assumptions and methods discredited, along with the Great White Man whose careers they chronicled.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Davis Graham, "The stunted career of policy history: a critique and an agenda." ''The Public Historian'' (1993): 15-37. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3377943 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Britain===
Readman (2009) discusses the historiography of British political history in the 20th century. He describes how British political scholarship mostly ignored 20th century history due to temporal proximity to the recent past, the unavailability of primary sources, and the potential for bias. The article explores how transitions in scholarship have allowed for greater interest in 20th century history among scholars, which include less reliance on archival sources, methodological changes in historiography, and the flourishing of new forms of history such as oral history.&lt;ref&gt;Readman (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
In the course of the 1960s, however, some German historians (notably [[Hans-Ulrich Wehler]] and his cohort) began to rebel against this idea, instead suggesting a "Primacy of Domestic Politics" (''Primat der Innenpolitik''), in which the insecurities of (in this case German) domestic policy drove the creation of foreign policy.  This led to a considerable body of work interpreting the domestic policies of various states and the ways this influenced their conduct of foreign policy.

===France===
The French ''[[Annales School]]'' had already put an emphasis on the role of geography and economics on history, and of the importance of broad, slow cycles rather than the constant apparent movement of the "history of events" of high politics.  It downplayed politics and diplomacy. The most important work of the ''Annales'' school, [[Fernand Braudel]]'s ''The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II'', contains a traditional Rankean diplomatic history of Philip II's Mediterranean policy, but only as the third and shortest section of a work largely focusing on the broad cycles of history in the ''longue durée'' ("long term").  The ''Annales'' were broadly influential, leading to a turning away from political history towards an emphasis on broader trends of economic and environmental change.

===Social history===
{{main|Social history}}
In the 1960s and 1970s, an increasing emphasis on giving a voice to the voiceless and writing the history of the underclasses, whether by using the quantitative statistical methods of [[social history]] or the more postmodern assessments of [[cultural history]], also undermined the centrality of politics to the historical discipline. Leff noted how social historians, "disdained political
history as elitist, shallow, altogether passe, and irrelevant to the drama of everyday lives."&lt;ref&gt;Mark H. Leff, "Revisioning US political history." ''American Historical Review'' (1995) 100#3 pp: 829-853, quote p 829. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2168607 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;


===History of political regimes and institutions===
*MaxRange data is a project that defines and shows in detail the political status and development of institutional regimes of all states in the world from 1789. MaxRange also describes the background, development, external sources and major causes behind all political changes.
MaxRange is a dataset defining level of democracy and institutional structure(regime-type) on a 100-graded scale where every value represents a unique regimetype. Values are sorted from 1-100 based on level of democracy and political accountability. MaxRange defines the value (regimetype) corresponding to all states and every month from 1789 to 2015 and updating. MaxRange is created and developed by Max Range, and is now associated with the university of Halmstad, Sweden &lt;ref&gt;http://www.hh.se/english/schoolofeducationhumanitiesandsocialsciences/research/maxrange.65441985_en.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Positive-real functions''', often abbreviated to '''PR function''', are a kind of mathematical function that first arose in [[Network analysis (electrical circuits)|electrical network analysis]]. They are [[Complex analysis#Complex functions|complex functions]], ''Z''(''s''), of a complex variable, ''s''.  A [[rational function]] is defined to have the PR property if it has a positive real part and is analytic in the right halfplane of the complex plane and takes on real values on the real axis.

In symbols the definition is,

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
&amp; \Re[Z(s)]&gt;0 \quad\text{if}\quad \Re(s) &gt; 0 \\
&amp; \Im[Z(s)]=0 \quad\text{if}\quad \Im(s)=0
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

In electrical network analysis, ''Z''(''s'') represents an [[electrical impedance|impedance]] expression and ''s'' is the [[complex frequency]] variable, often expressed as its real and imaginary parts;

:&lt;math&gt;s=\sigma+i\omega \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

in which terms the PR condition can be stated;

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
&amp; \Re[Z(s)]&gt;0 \quad\text{if}\quad \sigma &gt; 0 \\
&amp; \Im[Z(s)]=0 \quad\text{if}\quad \omega=0
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

The importance to network analysis of the PR condition lies in the realisability condition. ''Z''(''s'') is realisable as a [[one-port]] rational impedance if and only if it meets the PR condition.  Realisable in this sense means that the impedance can be constructed from a finite (hence rational) number of discrete ideal [[Passivity (engineering)|passive]] linear elements ([[resistor]]s, [[inductor]]s and [[capacitor]]s in electrical terminology).&lt;ref name=CauerMathisPauli&gt;E. Cauer, W. Mathis, and R. Pauli, "Life and Work of Wilhelm Cauer (1900 – 1945)", ''Proceedings of the Fourteenth International Symposium of Mathematical Theory of Networks and Systems (MTNS2000)'', Perpignan, June, 2000. [http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall03/cs323/links/cauer.pdf Retrieved online] 19 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The term ''positive-real function'' was originally defined by&lt;ref name=CauerMathisPauli /&gt; [[Otto Brune]] to describe any function ''Z''(''s'') which&lt;ref name=Brune1931a&gt;Brune, O, "Synthesis of a finite two-terminal network whose driving-point impedance is a prescribed function of frequency", Doctoral thesis, MIT, 1931. [http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/10661/36311006.pdf?sequence=1 Retrieved online] 3 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
*is [[rational function|rational]] (the quotient of two [[polynomials]]),
*is real when ''s'' is real
*has positive real part when ''s'' has a positive real part
Many authors strictly adhere to this definition by explicitly requiring rationality,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Network Theory |last=Bakshi |first=Uday |last2=Bakshi |first2=Ajay |year=2008 |publisher=Technical Publications |location=Pune |isbn=978-81-8431-402-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--U.A.Bakshi, J.S.Chitode --&gt; or by restricting attention to rational functions, at least in the first instance&lt;!-- Kendall Ling-chiao Su + --&gt;.&lt;ref name=Wing&gt;{{cite book |title=Classical Circuit Theory |last=Wing |first=Omar |year=2008 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-387-09739-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a similar more general condition, not restricted to rational functions had earlier been considered by Cauer,&lt;ref name=CauerMathisPauli /&gt; and some authors ascribe the term ''positive-real'' to this type of condition&lt;!-- Wai-Kai Chen --&gt;, while other consider it to be a generalization of the basic definition.&lt;ref name=Wing /&gt;

==History==
The condition was first proposed by [[Wilhelm Cauer]] (1926)&lt;ref&gt;Cauer, W, "Die Verwirklichung der Wechselstromwiderst ände vorgeschriebener Frequenzabh ängigkeit", ''Archiv für Elektrotechnik'', '''vol 17''', pp355–388, 1926.&lt;/ref&gt; who determined that it was a necessary condition.  [[Otto Brune]] (1931)&lt;ref name=Brune1931a /&gt;&lt;ref name=Brune1931b&gt;Brune, O, "Synthesis of a finite two-terminal network whose driving-point impedance is a prescribed function of frequency", ''J. Math. and Phys.'', '''vol 10''', pp191–236, 1931.&lt;/ref&gt; coined the term positive-real for the condition and proved that it was both necessary and sufficient for realisability.

==Properties==
*The sum of two PR functions is PR.&lt;!-- too obvious to mention? --&gt;
*The [[function composition|composition]] of two PR functions is PR. In particular, if ''Z''(''s'') is PR, then so are 1/''Z''(''s'') and ''Z''(1/''s'').
*All the [[zeros and poles]] of a PR function are in the left half plane or on its boundary the imaginary axis.
*Any poles and zeroes on the imaginary axis are [[zero (complex analysis)#Multiplicity_of_a_zero|simple]] (have a [[multiplicity (mathematics)|multiplicity]] of one).
*Any poles on the imaginary axis have real strictly positive [[residue (complex analysis)|residues]], and similarly at any zeroes on the imaginary axis, the function has a real strictly positive derivative.
*Over the right half plane, the minimum value of the real part of a PR function occurs on the imaginary axis (because the real part of an analytic function constitutes a [[harmonic function]] over the plane, and therefore satisfies the [[maximum principle]]).
*For a [[rational function|rational]] PR function, the number of poles and number of zeroes differ by at most one.

==Generalizations==
A couple of generalizations are sometimes made, with intention of characterizing the [[immittance]] functions of a wider class of passive linear electrical networks.

===Irrational functions===
The impedance ''Z''(''s'') of a network consisting of an infinite number of components (such as a semi-infinite [[Ladder_network#Ladder_topologies|ladder]]), need not be a rational function of ''s'', and in particular may have [[branch points]] on the negative real ''s''-axis. To accommodate such functions in the definition of PR, it is therefore necessary to relax the condition that the function be real for all real ''s'', and only require this when ''s'' is positive. Thus, a possibly irrational function ''Z''(''s'') is PR if and only if
*''Z''(''s'') is analytic in the open right half ''s''-plane (Re[''s''] &gt; 0)
*''Z''(''s'') is real when ''s'' is positive and real
*Re[''Z''(''s'')] ≥ 0 when Re[''s''] ≥ 0
Some authors start from this more general definition, and then particularize it to the rational case.

===Matrix-valued functions===
Linear electrical networks with more than one [[Port (circuit theory)|port]] may be described by [[impedance parameters|impedance or]] [[admittance parameters|admittance matrices]]. So by extending the definition of PR to matrix-valued functions, linear multi-port networks which are passive may be distinguished from those that are not. A possibly irrational matrix-valued function ''Z''(''s'') is PR if and only if
*Each element of ''Z''(''s'') is analytic in the open right half ''s''-plane (Re[''s''] &gt; 0)
*Each element of ''Z''(''s'') is real when ''s'' is positive and real
*The [[Hermitian matrix|Hermitian]] part (''Z''(''s'') + ''Z''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;(''s''))/2 of ''Z''(''s'') is [[Positive-definite matrix|positive semi-definite]] when Re[''s''] ≥ 0

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20040">'''Rapid automatized naming''' (RAN) is a task that measures how quickly individuals can name aloud objects, pictures, colors, or
[[symbol]]s (letters or digits). Variations in rapid automatized naming time in children provide a strong predictor of their later ability to [[Reading (process)|read]], and is independent from other predictors such as [[phonological awareness]], [[verbal IQ]], and existing reading skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Powell D, Stainthorp R, Stuart M, Garwood H, Quinlan P |title=An experimental comparison between rival theories of rapid automatized naming performance and its relationship to reading |journal=J Exp Child Psychol |volume=98 |issue=1 |pages=46–68 |date=September 2007 |pmid=17555762 |doi=10.1016/j.jecp.2007.04.003 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Importantly, rapid automatized naming of pictures and letters can predict later reading abilities for pre-literate children.&lt;ref name="Lervåg, 2009"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lervåg A, Hulme C |title=Rapid automatized naming (RAN) taps a mechanism that places constraints on the development of early reading fluency |journal=Psychol Sci |volume=20 |issue=8 |pages=1040–8 |date=August 2009 |pmid=19619178 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2009.02405.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The concept of rapid automatized naming began with a study by Geshwind and Fusillo in 1966. They found some adults who suffered from a [[stroke]] were later unable to name colors despite being able to color match and having no evidence of [[color blindness]].&lt;ref name="Denckla, Cutting, 1999"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Denckla|first1=Martha Bridge|last2=Cutting|first2=Laurie E. |title=History and significance of rapid automatized naming|journal=Annals of Dyslexia |volume=49 |issue=1 |year=1999 |pages=29–42|issn=0736-9387|doi=10.1007/s11881-999-0018-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; These individuals however were able to spell and write, indicating that their brain structures were intact and that they could generate the pathway from spoken words to visual and kinaesthetic representations.&lt;ref name="Denckla, Cutting, 1999"/&gt; This visual-verbal disconnection led to a search for individuals who could not read and may be unable to name colors, primarily grade one students. It was found that in grade one students who could not read, color naming was possible but took much longer than color naming in children who could read.&lt;ref name="Denckla, Cutting, 1999"/&gt;

The first color naming task was located in Ruesch and Wells Mental Examiner’s Handbook (1972).&lt;ref name="Denckla, Cutting, 1999"/&gt; It consisted of 50 squares of 5 [[primary colors]] repeated in random order 10 times. The test was originally administered as a timed continuous test at the bedside of individuals recovering from head injury.&lt;ref name="Denckla, Cutting, 1999"/&gt;

Rapid automatized naming was first identified in 1974 as predicting reading abilities in young English readers between 5–11 years of age by Martha Denckla and Rita Rudel of [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Denckla MB, Rudel R |title=Rapid "automatized" naming of pictured objects, colors, letters and numbers by normal children |journal=Cortex |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=186–202 |date=June 1974 |pmid=4844470 |doi= 10.1016/s0010-9452(74)80009-2|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Faster times in RAN trials have been found to be a good indicator of reading competence, not only in alphabetic [[writing system]]s, but in writing systems such as Chinese [[logograph]]s  and Japanese [[kanji]] and [[hiragana]].&lt;ref name="HoLai1999"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ho |first1=Connie Suk-Han|last2=Lai|first2=Daphne Ngar-Chi|title=Naming-speed deficits and phonological memory deficits in Chinese developmental dyslexia|journal=Learning and Individual Differences |volume=11|issue=2 |year=1999|pages=173–186 |issn=1041-6080 |doi=10.1016/S1041-6080(00)80004-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kobayashi MS, Haynes CW, Macaruso P, Hook PE, Kato J |title=Effects of mora deletion, nonword repetition, rapid naming, and visual search performance on beginning reading in Japanese |journal=Ann Dyslexia |volume=55 |issue=1 |pages=105–28 |date=June 2005 |pmid=16107782 |doi= 10.1007/s11881-005-0006-7|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; RAN testing has been shown to be effective in testing reader’s [[fluency]] in languages with [[Orthography|orthographically]] transparent [[Alphabet|alphabetic scripts]] such as [[German language|German]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]].&lt;ref name="Wimmer, Mayringer, 2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wimmer|first1=Heinz|last2=Mayringer|first2=Heinz|last3=Landerl|first3=Karin|title=The double-deficit hypothesis and difficulties in learning to read a regular orthography.|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology|volume=92 |issue=4|year=2000 |pages=668–680 |issn=1939-2176|doi=10.1037/0022-0663.92.4.668}}&lt;/ref&gt; Timed reading tests of poor readers of transparent [[Orthography|orthographies]] show very few reading errors; their main reading problem is slow, laborious decoding for words that are automatically read by their peers. This was also found for other readers in languages with consistent [[Orthography|orthographies]] such as [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]].&lt;ref name="Wimmer, Mayringer, 2000"/&gt; English is an inconsistent [[orthography]] because it has poor [[Phonemic orthography|letter sound correspondences]]. English [[orthography]] and  [[Orthography of French|French orthography]] are also inconsistent because of their use of silent letters.&lt;ref name="Wimmer, Mayringer, 2000"/&gt;

It has been found that continuous rapid naming of a list, compared to naming of single items, is easier for nondyslexic readers than it is for [[Dyslexia|dyslexic]] ones.&lt;ref name="JonesBranigan2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=Manon W.|last2=Branigan|first2=Holly P.|last3=Kelly|first3=M. Louise|title=Dyslexic and nondyslexic reading fluency: Rapid automatized naming and the importance of continuous lists|journal=Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review|volume=16|issue=3|year=2009|pages=567–572|issn=1069-9384|doi=10.3758/PBR.16.3.567}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, Wimmer, Mayringer and Landerl (2000) suggest that the diagnosis of [[dyslexia]] in English readers often overlooks naming-speed deficit and that most studies rely on poor word recognition to diagnose [[reading disability]].&lt;ref name="Wimmer, Mayringer, 2000"/&gt;

==Types of RAN Testing==
Rapid automatized naming can be used in many different ways. One of its strengths is flexibility in what types of stimuli categories it uses. Different categories consist of colors, digits, objects and letters.&lt;ref name="Arnell, 2009"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Arnell KM, Joanisse MF, Klein RM, Busseri MA, Tannock R |title=Decomposing the relation between Rapid Automatized Naming (RAN) and reading ability |journal=Can J Exp Psychol |volume=63 |issue=3 |pages=173–84 |date=September 2009 |pmid=19739900 |doi=10.1037/a0015721 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers use RAN to test [[Orthography|orthographic]] interpretation and [[phonological awareness]]. Two RAN tests are the CTOPP and TOWRE.&lt;ref name="FurnesSamuelsson2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Furnes|first1=Bjarte|last2=Samuelsson|first2=Stefan|title=Phonological awareness and rapid automatized naming predicting early development in reading and spelling: Results from a cross-linguistic longitudinal study|journal=Learning and Individual Differences |volume=21 |issue=1|year=2011 |pages=85–95 |issn=1041-6080|doi=10.1016/j.lindif.2010.10.005|pmc=3045196}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two formats of RAN testing are used, discrete and serial testing.

===Serial Testing===
Using a serial testing method, participants are shown a row or column of [[symbol]]s and must name the symbols sequentially as fast as possible. An assumption made of serial RAN testing is that it consists of two components: [[Articulation (phonetics)|articulation]] time (the mean time it takes to articulate the symbol), and  pause time (the mean length of time between naming two adjacent symbols).  When referring to pause time, this can include [[Saccade|saccadic eye movements]], disengagement from previously named symbols and focusing on upcoming symbols.&lt;ref name="de Jong2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Jong|first1=Peter F.|title=What Discrete and Serial Rapid Automatized Naming Can Reveal About Reading|journal=Scientific Studies of Reading|volume=15|issue=4|year=2011|pages=314–337|issn=1088-8438|doi=10.1080/10888438.2010.485624}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discrete Testing===
Using the discrete testing method, participants are shown symbols individually usually on a computer screen. In discrete RAN testing each individual symbols' naming latency is measured. The naming latency consists of the mean time from presentation to articulation of symbol. It is scored using the mean naming latency of all symbols. Some theorists believe that discrete RAN testing reflects the retrieval of [[Phonology|phonological code]] from [[memory]] which can also be referred to as lexical access speed.&lt;ref name="de Jong2011"/&gt;

Some researchers argue that discrete testing is a better method because of individual differences in the reading speed of a list of sight words; the relationship of RAN and reading will be stronger if sight word reading speed is measured by discrete presentation.&lt;ref name="de Jong2011"/&gt;

== Criticism ==
Today RAN is frequently used as a clinical instrument for diagnosing [[Reading disability|reading disabilities]] in children. It is often used to predict category membership in reading group sub-types. Some concerns with diagnosis using rapid automatized naming arise because it assesses a wide range of [[Cognition|cognitive skills]]. Speed and accuracy can be influenced by many different processing mechanisms and variables, including the perceived speed of the object to be named.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ben-Haim|first1=Moshe Shay|last2=Chajut|first2=Eran|last3=Hassin|first3=Ran|last4=Algom|first4=Daniel|title=Speeded naming or naming speed? The automatic effect of object speed on performance|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: General|date=April 2015|volume=2|issue=144|pages=326–338|doi=10.1037/a0038569|pmid=25559652|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/xge/144/2/326/|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another concern is identifying which cognitive mechanisms are shared with reading. It is not clear whether RAN is testing [[Orthography|orthographic knowledge]] or whether it is testing phonological processing.&lt;ref name="Arnell, 2009"/&gt;

==Theories==
The role RAN plays in testing reading ability is contentious. Research supports the use of RAN as a measure of phonological processing, as a measure of [[Orthography|orthographic processing]] and integration, and as a measure of reading ability. It has been suggested that RAN may link to reading because reading depends on object-naming circuits in the left [[cerebral hemisphere]] that are recruited in reading to underpin word-recognition abilities.&lt;ref name="Lervåg, 2009"/&gt;

===Orthographic and/or Phonological Processing===
Little is known about the mediator variable between [[phonological awareness]] and RAN and the relationship between [[phonological awareness]] and RAN.&lt;ref name="Swanson, Trainin, 2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Swanson|first1=H. L.|last2=Trainin|first2=G. |last3=Necoechea |first3=D. M.|last4=Hammill|first4=D. D.|title=Rapid Naming, Phonological Awareness, and Reading: A Meta-Analysis of the Correlation Evidence|journal=Review of Educational Research|volume=73 |issue=4|year=2003 |pages=407–440|issn=0034-6543 |doi=10.3102/00346543073004407}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers argue that RAN tests "the ability to retrieve phonological representations rapidly from long-term memory".&lt;ref name="de Jong2011"/&gt; Part of this view consists of RAN as tapping into the phonological system  by measuring the rate of retrieval of phonological information in long term memory. "The theoretical underpinnings being that, beyond the precision or accuracy of the grapheme–phoneme representations itself, rapid access to phonological representations is the main prerequisite to develop automaticity in reading a transparent writing system".&lt;ref name="FurnesSamuelsson2011"/&gt;

Others however dispute the link between RAN testing and phonological processing. They argue that [[phonological awareness]] is more strongly  related  to  pure  decoding ability, whereas  naming  speed  appears to be  more  strongly related to [[Fluency|reading fluency]].&lt;ref name="Schatschneider, 2002"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schatschneider C, Carlson CD, Francis DJ, Foorman BR, Fletcher JM |title=Relationship of rapid automatized naming and phonological awareness in early reading development: implications for the double-deficit hypothesis |journal=J Learn Disabil |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=245–56 |year=2002 |pmid=15493321 |doi=10.1177/002221940203500306  |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, other researchers view RAN as a sub-process of [[phonological awareness]]. In this view RAN is seen as a task that draws on accessing phonological codes for effective execution.&lt;ref name="Swanson, Trainin, 2003"/&gt; Although the relationship between RAN and [[phonological awareness]] is [[monotonic]], these measures do not produce uniform changes. Instead, as reading skills increase or decrease, RAN and [[phonological awareness]] skills do not change uniformly.&lt;ref name="Swanson, Trainin, 2003"/&gt;

An alternative view is that RAN plays a larger role in measuring [[Orthography|orthographic processing]]. Here RAN is believed to measure processes that are important in gaining [[Orthography|orthographic representations]].&lt;ref name="de Jong2011"/&gt; Studies have been conducted where RAN has been seen to measure reading of different kinds of words. These researchers argue that  "the relationship of RAN with reading should be higher if the reading task requires more [[Orthography|orthographic knowledge]]." The results of some studies tend to support this prediction as stronger relationships were found with exception word reading.&lt;ref name="de Jong2011"/&gt;

Still other studies focus on the relationship between phonological processing and [[Orthography|orthographic processing]]. "The fact that RAN as a predictor of reading and spelling was not affected by [[Orthography|orthographic]] regularity seems to suggest that RAN is a compound skill that consists of several sub-processes that are related to early literacy development. These processes might very well imply both [[Orthography|orthographical]] and phonological skills".&lt;ref name="FurnesSamuelsson2011"/&gt;

===Reading Ability===
There are several theories why rapid automatized naming is associated with reading abilities. One suggestion is that they both exploit the speed with which [[phonological]] representations are retrieved from [[long-term memory]]. Another related theory is that both depend on variations in the rate of development of a general cognitive speed of information processing.&lt;ref name="Kail, Hall, 1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kail|first1=Robert|last2=Hall|first2=Lynda K.|title=Processing speed, naming speed, and reading.|journal=Developmental Psychology|volume=30 |issue=6|year=1994 |pages=949–954 |issn=0012-1649|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.30.6.949}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kail, Hall, 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kail|first1=Robert|last2=Hall|first2=Lynda K.|last3=Caskey|first3=Bradley J.|title=Processing speed, exposure to print, and naming speed|journal=Applied Psycholinguistics|volume=20|issue=02|year=1999|issn=0142-7164|doi=10.1017/S0142716499002076}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence exists that RAN’s contribution to reading ability decreases as we age. Longitudinal studies report that the contribution of naming speed to reading skills after grade 3 diminishes, whereas the contribution of [[phonological awareness]] remains constant.&lt;ref name="Swanson, Trainin, 2003"/&gt;

The validity of RAN in measuring reading ability is based on three assumptions.&lt;ref name="Swanson, Trainin, 2003"/&gt; First, that RAN deficits and phonological deficits are independent of one another. Secondly, the relationship between RAN and [[phonological awareness]] varies according to reading maturity. Finally, naming speed is a complex process involving processes beyond the phonological system.

Labelling RAN as a measure of reading ability ignores many complexities of the task. Schatschneider et al. argue "that rapid naming tasks are composed of [[attention]]al, [[Visual system|visual]], [[Lexicon|lexical]], [[Temporal lobe|temporal]], and [[Memory|recognition]] sub-processes that all contribute to naming speed performance. Lumping all these sub-processes under the category of phonological processes obscures the complexity of rapid naming tasks. Such a hypothesis is consistent with the finding that naming speed tasks consistently account for variance in early reading skills beyond that accounted for by measures of phonemic awareness".&lt;ref name="Schatschneider, 2002"/&gt;

Another viewpoint is that rapid automatized naming directly relates to differences in reading competence. Supporting this is the fact that the ability to rapidly name digits and letters predicts reading better than rapidly naming colors and objects.  This suggests a difference due to differences in experience with letters. However, rapid automatized naming of colors, objects, numbers and letters measured in children before they learn to read predicts later differences in reading skill, while early differences in reading ability do not predict later differences in rapid automatized naming.&lt;ref name="Lervåg, 2009"/&gt;

===Double Deficit Hypothesis===
It has been proposed that [[dyslexia]] is due to a "[[Double deficit (education)|double-deficit hypothesis]]" in which phonological deficits and naming-speed deficits are two separate causes of reading problems, such that when they are combined, they produce a greater dyslexic defect than would be produced by either deficit individually.&lt;ref name="Bowers, Wolf, 1993"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bowers|first1=Patricia Greig|last2=Wolf|first2=Maryanne|title=Theoretical links among naming speed, precise timing mechanisms and orthographic skill in dyslexia |journal=Reading and Writing |volume=5 |issue=1|year=1993 |pages=69–85 |issn=0922-4777 |doi=10.1007/BF01026919}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wolf, Bowers, 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wolf |first1=Maryanne |last2=Bowers|first2=Patricia Greig|title=The double-deficit hypothesis for the developmental dyslexias.|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology |volume=91 |issue=3 |year=1999|pages=415–438|issn=0022-0663|doi=10.1037/0022-0663.91.3.415}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The double-deficit hypothesis suggests that RAN and [[phonological awareness]] operate as independent systems that are equally important in word identification. This model is based on literature showing that phonological disabilities and naming speed-deficits underlie some forms of reading disabilities. In the case of modest or severe reading disability, the concurrence of both a phonological deficit and rapid naming deficit characterizes the most difficult forms of reading disabilities. These individuals score lowest on reading measures.&lt;ref name="Swanson, Trainin, 2003"/&gt;

The '''Faculty of Chemistry (since 2014 The Institute of Chemistry)  ''' at [[Saint Petersburg State University]] is one of the leading chemistry faculties in [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Donetskaya|first1= S.S.|year= 2007|title= The scientific capabilities of chemistry faculty members in Russian universities.|journal= Eko (Russian: Эко)|issue= 4|pages= 131–143|url= http://www.sibupk.nsk.su/New/05/publicat/smk_3.pdf|accessdate= 2010-01-18|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120302160600/http://www.sibupk.nsk.su/New/05/publicat/smk_3.pdf|archivedate= 2012-03-02|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Formally, the Department of Chemistry has been created as a separate entity of [[Saint Petersburg State University|Saint Petersburg State University (then Leningrad State University)]] in 1929. However, the history of chemistry at [[Saint Petersburg State University]] began much earlier. First chemistry laboratory and lectures in chemistry were introduced at the University in 1833. One of the first professors of chemistry was Alexander Voskresensky, a doctoral student of [[Justus von Liebig]]. Voskresensky largely contributed to the growth of chemistry classes at the University. He initiated lectures in organic chemistry (1843) and promoted first scientific projects. Later, in 1868, the chemistry division hosted then by the Department of Physics and Mathematics was split into three to form the division of organic chemistry led by [[Aleksandr Butlerov]], the division of inorganic chemistry led by [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] and the division of analytical chemistry led by [[Nikolai Menshutkin]]. Since then, [[Saint Petersburg State University|the University of Saint-Petersburg]] became home to one of the most elite chemistry schools in the country. Many prominent Russian chemists began their career and/or worked there. Among them are [[Nikolay Zinin]], [[Alexey Favorsky]], [[Lev Aleksandrovich Chugaev]], Dmitry Konovalov, [[Sergei Vasiljevich Lebedev]], [[Tishchenko reaction|Vyacheslav Tishchenko]], [[Vladimir Ipatieff]], [[Nikolay Semyonov]], [[Boris Nikolsky]], [[Mikhail Shultz]].

In the Soviet era, the Department of Chemistry continued to grow with new divisions: colloid chemistry (1939), electrochemistry (1940), chemistry of macromolecular compounds (1944), radiochemistry (1945), physical organic chemistry (1946), theory of solutions (1950), chemistry of natural compounds (1963), quantum chemistry (1967), solid state chemistry (1978).

==Campuses==
Historically, some of the first chemistry offices were located in the main building of [[Saint Petersburg State University]] called [[Twelve Collegia]]. The remainder of these is the [[Dmitri Mendeleev|Mendeleev]] museum located on the first floor of the central part of this enormous building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Trimble|first1= R.F.|year= 1981|title= Mendeleev's Discovery of the Periodic Law|journal= Journal of Chemical Education|volume= 58|issue= 1|pages= 28|doi= 10.1021/ed058p28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Krotikov|first1= V.A.|year= 1960|title= The Mendeleev Archives and Museum of the Leningrad University|journal= Journal of Chemical Education|volume= 37|issue= 12|pages= 625–628|doi= 10.1021/ed037p625}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century, the Department of Chemistry was headquartered at 41/43 Sredniy prospekt on [[Vasilievsky Island]], about one mile west of [[Twelve Collegia]]. In the 1980s, most of the laboratories were relocated to a more spacious building in the newly constructed campus in the suburb of [[petergof|Peterhof]].

==Divisions==
Currently, there are 14 scientific divisions in the chemistry department:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8439">'''Seed-based d mapping''' (formerly '''Signed differential mapping''') or '''SDM''' is a [[statistical]] technique created by [[Joaquim Radua]] for [[meta-analysis|meta-analyzing]] studies on differences in [[brain]] activity or structure which used [[neuroimaging]] techniques such as [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]], [[Voxel-based morphometry|VBM]], [[Diffusion MRI#Diffusion tensor imaging|DTI]] or [[Positron emission tomography|PET]]. It may also refer to a specific piece of software created by the SDM Project to carry out such meta-analyses.

==The seed-based d mapping approach==

===Overview of the method===
SDM adopted and combined various positive features from previous methods, such as ALE or MKDA, and introduced a series of improvements and novel features.&lt;ref name=radua2009&gt;
{{Cite journal

  | pmid = 19880927
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; One of the new features, introduced to avoid positive and negative findings in the same [[voxel]] as seen in previous methods, was the representation of both positive differences and negative differences in the same map, thus obtaining a signed differential map (SDM). Another relevant feature, introduced in version 2.11, was the use of [[effect size]]s (leading to effect-size SDM or 'ES-SDM'), which allows combination of reported peak coordinates with statistical parametric maps, thus allowing more exhaustive and accurate meta-analyses.&lt;ref name=radua2012&gt;
{{Cite journal

  | journal = European Psychiatry
  | doi = 10.1016/j.eurpsy.2011.04.001 | volume=27 | pages=605–611
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The method has three steps. First, coordinates of cluster peaks (e.g. the [[voxel]]s where the differences between patients and healthy controls were highest), and statistical maps if available, are selected according to SDM inclusion criteria. Second, coordinates are used to recreate statistical maps, and effect-sizes maps and their variances are derived from [[t-statistic]]s (or equivalently from [[p-value]]s or [[standard score|z-scores]]). Finally, individual study maps are [[meta-analysis|meta-analyzed]] using different tests to complement the main outcome with sensitivity and [[Study heterogeneity|heterogeneity]] analyses.

===Inclusion criteria===
It is not uncommon in [[neuroimaging]] studies that some regions (e.g. a priori [[Region of interest|regions of interest]]) are more liberally [[Statistical hypothesis testing|thresholded]] than the rest of the [[brain]]. However, a [[meta-analysis]] of studies with such intra-study regional differences in [[Statistical hypothesis testing|thresholds]] would be [[Bias of an estimator|biased]] towards these regions, as they are more likely to be reported just because authors apply more liberal [[Statistical hypothesis testing|thresholds]] in them. In order to overcome this issue SDM introduced a criterion in the selection of the coordinates: while different studies may employ different thresholds, you should ensure that the same threshold throughout the whole brain was used within each included study.&lt;ref name=radua2009 /&gt;

===Pre-processing of studies===
After conversion of statistical parametric maps and peak coordinates to [[Talairach#Talairach atlas and Talairach coordinates|Talairach space]], an SDM map is created for each study within a specific gray or white matter template.&lt;ref name=radua2010c&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Pre-processing of statistical parametric maps is straightforward, while pre-processing of reported peak coordinates requires recreating the clusters of difference by means of an un-normalized [[Gaussian function|Gaussian Kernel]], so that [[voxels]] closer to the peak coordinate have higher values. A rather large [[Full width at half maximum|full-width at half-maximum]] (FWHM) of 20mm is used to account for different sources of spatial error, e.g. [[coregistration]] mismatch in the studies, the size of the cluster or the location of the peak within the cluster. Within a study, values obtained by close [[Gaussian function|Gaussian kernels]] are summed, though values are combined by square-distance-weighted averaging.&lt;ref name=radua2012 /&gt;

===Statistical comparisons===
SDM provides several different statistical analyses in order to complement the main outcome with sensitivity and [[Study heterogeneity|heterogeneity]] analyses.

* The main statistical analysis is the [[mean]] analysis, which consists in calculating the [[mean]] of the [[voxel]] values in the different studies. This [[mean]] is [[Weight function|weighted]] by the inverse of the variance and accounts for [[Study heterogeneity|inter-study heterogeneity]] (QH maps).&lt;ref name=radua2012 /&gt;
* [[Subgroup analysis|Subgroup analyses]] are mean analyses applied to groups of studies to allow the study of [[Study heterogeneity|heterogeneity]].
* [[Linear model]] analyses (e.g. meta-regression) are a generalization of the mean analysis to allow comparisons between groups and the study of possible [[Confounding|confounds]].&lt;ref name=radua2010a&gt;{{Cite journal

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; A low variability of the regressor is critical in meta-regressions, so they are recommended to be understood as exploratory and to be more conservatively thresholded.&lt;ref name=radua2009 /&gt;

* [[Resampling (statistics)#Jackknife|Jack-knife analysis]] consists in repeating a test as many times as studies have been included, discarding one different study each time, i.e. removing one study and repeating the analyses, then putting that study back and removing another study and repeating the analysis, and so on. The idea is that if a significant brain region remains significant in all or most of the combinations of studies it can be concluded that this finding is highly replicable.&lt;ref name=radua2009 /&gt;

The [[statistical significance]] of the analyses is checked by standard [[Monte Carlo method|randomization tests]]. It is recommended to use uncorrected p-values = 0.005, as this significance has been found in this method to be approximately equivalent to a corrected p-value = 0.05.&lt;ref name=radua2012 /&gt; A [[false discovery rate]] (FDR) = 0.05 has been found in this method to be too conservative. Values in a Talairach label or coordinate can also be extracted for further processing or graphical presentation.

==SDM software==
SDM is software written by the SDM project to aid the meta-analysis of [[Voxel|voxel-based]] [[neuroimaging]] data. It is distributed as [[freeware]] including a graphical interface and a menu/command-line console. It can also be integrated as an [[Statistical parametric mapping|SPM]] extension.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3374">In [[industrial engineering]], the '''standard time''' is the time required by an average skilled operator, working at
a normal pace, to perform a specified task using a prescribed method.&lt;ref&gt;Zandin 2001, Section X, Chapter 5.1&lt;/ref&gt; It includes appropriate allowances to allow the person to recover from [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]] and, where necessary, an additional allowance to cover contingent elements which may occur but have not been observed.

Standard time =normal time +allowance 
Where; normal time =avg time *rating factor. 
(take rating factor between 1.1 and 1.2)

==Usage of the standard time==

Time times for all operations are known. 
* [[Workforce planning|Staffing (or workforce planning)]]: the number of workers required cannot accurately be determined unless the time required to process the existing work is known.
* [[Production leveling|Line balancing (or production leveling)]]: the correct number of workstations for optimum work flow depends on the processing time, or standard, at each workstation.
* [[Material requirements planning|Materials requirement planning (MRP)]]: MRP systems cannot operate properly without accurate work standards.
* [[Systems Simulation|System simulation]]: simulation models cannot accurately simulate operation unless times for all operations are known.
* [[Wage payment systems|Wage payment]]: comparing expected performance with actual performance requires the use of work standards.
* [[Cost accounting]]: work standards are necessary for determining not only the labor component of costs, but also the correct allocation of production costs to specific products.
* Employee evaluation: in order to assess whether individual employees are performing as well as they should, a performance standard is necessary against which to measure the level of performance.

==Techniques to establish a standard time==
The standard time can be determined using the following techniques:&lt;ref&gt;Groover 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Time study]],
# [[Predetermined motion time system]] aka PMTS or PTS,
#Standard data system,
#[[Work sampling]].

==Method of calculation==
The Standard Time is the product of three factors:
#Observed time: The time measured to complete the task.
#Performance rating factor: The pace the person is working at. 90% is working slower than normal, 110% is working faster than normal, 100% is normal.  This factor is calculated by an experienced worker who is trained to observe and determine the rating.
#[[PFD allowance|Personal, fatigue, and delay (PFD) allowance]].

The standard time can then be calculated by using:&lt;ref&gt;Groover 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

 &lt;math&gt;\text{Standard Time} = (\text{Observed Time})(\text{Rating Factor})(1+\text{PFD Allowance})&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26876">The '''sulfur cycle''' is the collection of processes by which [[sulfur]] moves to and from rock, waterways and living systems.  Such  [[biogeochemical cycle]]s are important in [[geology]] because they affect many minerals.  Biochemical cycles are also important for life because sulfur is an [[essential element]], being a constituent of many [[protein]]s and [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]]s.&lt;ref name=Brock/&gt;

[[File:Sulfur cycle - English.jpg|thumb|450px|The Sulfur cycle (in general)]]
[[File:SulfurCycle copy.jpg|thumb|Sulfur cycle]]
Steps of the '''sulfur cycle''' are:
* Mineralization of [[Organosulfur compounds|organic sulfur]] into inorganic forms, such as [[hydrogen sulfide]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S), elemental sulfur, as well as [[sulfide minerals]].
* [[Oxidation]] of hydrogen sulfide, [[sulfide]], and elemental sulfur (S) to [[sulfate]] (SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;).
* Reduction of sulfate to sulfide.
* Incorporation of sulfide into organic compounds (including metal-containing derivatives).
[[Image:3'-Phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate.svg|thumb|190px|Structure of [[3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate]], a key intermediate in the sulfur cycle.]]
These are often termed as follows:
:''Assimilative sulfate reduction'' (see also [[sulfur assimilation]]) in which sulfate (SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;) is reduced by [[plant]]s, [[fungi]] and various [[prokaryote]]s. The oxidation states of sulfur are +6 in sulfate and –2 in R–SH.
:''Desulfurization'' in which organic molecules containing sulfur can be desulfurized, producing hydrogen sulfide gas (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S, oxidation state = –2). An analogous process for organic nitrogen compounds is deamination.
:''Oxidation of hydrogen sulfide'' produces elemental sulfur (S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;), oxidation state = 0. This reaction occurs in the [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] green and purple sulfur [[bacteria]] and some [[chemolithotroph]]s.  Often the elemental sulfur is stored as [[polysulfide]]s.
:''Oxidation in elemental sulfur'' by sulfur oxidizers produces sulfate.
:''Dissimilative sulfur reduction'' in which elemental sulfur can be reduced to hydrogen sulfide.
:''Dissimilative sulfate reduction'' in which [[sulfate-reducing bacteria|sulfate reducers]] generate hydrogen sulfide from sulfate.

==Sulfur sources and sinks==
Sulfur is found in [[oxidation state]]s ranging from +6 in [[Sulfate|SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;]] to -2 in [[sulfide]]s.  Thus elemental sulfur can either give or receive electrons depending on its environment. Minerals such as [[pyrite]] (FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) comprise the original pool of sulfur on earth.  Owing to the sulfur cycle, the amount of mobile sulfur has been continuously increasing through [[Volcanism|volcanic activity]] as well as [[weathering]] of the [[Crust (geology)|crust]] in an oxygenated atmosphere.&lt;ref name=Brock&gt;{{cite book |title=Brock Biology of Microorganisms | year=2006| author=Madigan MT, Martino JM | edition=11th |page=136 |publisher=Pearson |isbn=978-0-13-196893-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earth's main sulfur sink is the oceans SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;, where it is the major [[oxidizing agent]].&lt;ref&gt;Bickle, M. J., Alt, J. C., Teagle, D. A. H., 1994, Sulfur transport and sulphur isotope fractionations in ocean floor hydrothermal systems: Mineralogical Magazine, vol. 58A, p.&amp;nbsp;88-89.&lt;/ref&gt;
	
When SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; is assimilated by organisms, it is reduced and converted to organic sulfur, which is an essential component of [[protein]]s.  However, the [[biosphere]] does not act as a major sink for sulfur, instead the majority of sulfur is found in [[seawater]] or [[sedimentary rock]]s including: pyrite rich [[shale]]s, [[evaporite]] rocks ([[anhydrite]] and [[baryte]]), and [[Carbonate minerals|calcium and magnesium carbonates]] (i.e. [[carbonate-associated sulfate]]).  The amount of [[sulfate]] in the oceans is controlled by three major processes:&lt;ref name=Turchyn&gt;Alexandra V. Turchyn "Oxygen isotopes in marine sulfate and the sulfur cycle over the last 140 million years" Harvard University, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
:1. input from rivers
:2. sulfate reduction and sulfide re-oxidation on continental shelves and slopes
:3. burial of anhydrite and pyrite in the oceanic crust.
There is no significant amount of sulfur held in the atmosphere with all of it coming from either sea spray or windblown sulfur rich dust,&lt;ref&gt;(Reheis and Kihl 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; neither of which is long lived in the atmosphere.  In recent times the large annual input of sulfur from the burning of [[coal]] and other [[fossil fuel]]s adds a substantial amount SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; which acts as an [[Air pollution|air pollutant]].  In the geologic past, [[igneous]] intrusions into [[coal measures]] have caused large scale burning of these measures, and consequential release of sulfur to the atmosphere.  This has led to substantial disruption to the climate system, and is one of the proposed causes of the [[great dying]].
	
[[Dimethylsulfide]] [(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S or DMS] is produced by the decomposition of [[dimethylsulfoniopropionate]] (DMSP) from dying [[phytoplankton]] cells in the shallow levels of the ocean, and is the major biogenic gas emitted from the sea, where it is responsible for the distinctive “smell of the sea” along coastlines.&lt;ref name=Brock/&gt;  DMS is the largest natural source of sulfur gas, but still only has a residence time of about one day in the atmosphere and a majority of it is redeposited in the oceans rather than making it to land.  However, it is a significant factor in the climate system, as it is involved in the formation of clouds.

==Biologically and thermochemically driven sulfate reduction==
&lt;!-- Thermochemical Sulphate Reduction redirects here --&gt; {{Confusing|section|date=March 2017}}
Sulfur can be reduced both biologically and thermochemically.  Dissimilatory sulfate reduction has two different definitions:&lt;ref&gt;Farquhar, J., Canfield, D.E., Masterson, A., Bao, H., Johnston, D., 2008, Sulfur and oxygen isotope study of sulfate reduction in experiments with natural populations from Fællenstrand, Denmark:  Geochemica et Cosmochica, Acta 72, p.&amp;nbsp;2805–2821&lt;/ref&gt; 
:1. the microbial process that converts sulfate to sulfide for energy gain, and
:2. a set of forward and reverse pathways that progress from the uptake and release of sulfate by the cell to its conversion to various sulfur intermediates, and ultimately to sulfide which is released from the cell.{{Explain|date=March 2017}}
Sulfide and thiosulfate are the most abundant reduced inorganic sulfur species in the environments and are converted to sulfate, primarily by bacterial action, in the oxidative half of the sulfur cycle.&lt;ref&gt;Bamford, V.A., Bruno, S., Rasmussen, T., Appi-Ayme, C., Cheesman, M.R., Berks, B.C., Hemmings, A.M., 2002, Structural basis for the oxidation of thiosulfate by a sulfur cycle enzyme: European Molecular Biology Organization, vol. 21, No. 21, p.&amp;nbsp;5599-5610&lt;/ref&gt;  Bacterial sulfate reduction (BSR) can only occur at temperature from 0 up to 60–80&amp;nbsp;°C because above that temperature almost all sulfate-reducing microbes can no longer metabolize.  Few microbes can form H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S at higher temperatures but appear to be very rare and do not metabolize in settings where normal bacterial sulfate reduction is occurring.  BSR is geologically instantaneous happening on the order of hundreds to thousands of years.  Thermochemical sulfate reduction (TSR) occurs at much higher temperatures (160–180&amp;nbsp;°C) and over longer time intervals, several tens of thousands to a few million years.&lt;ref name=Machel&gt;Machel, H.G., 2001, Bacterial and thermochemical sulfate reduction in diagenetic settings – old and new insights: Sedimentary Geology, vol. 140, p.&amp;nbsp;143-175&lt;/ref&gt;

The main difference between these two reactions is obvious, one is organically driven and the other is chemically driven.  Therefore, the temperature for thermochemical sulfate reduction is much higher due to the activation energy required to reduce sulfate.{{clarify|date=March 2017}}   Bacterial sulfate reductions requires lower temperatures because the sulfur reducing bacteria can only live at relatively low temperature (below 60&amp;nbsp;°C).  BSR also requires a relatively open system; otherwise the bacteria will poison themselves when the sulfate levels rise above 5–10%.{{Explain|date=March 2017}}

The organic reactants involved in BSR are organic acids which are distinctive from the organic reactants needed for TSR.  In both cases sulfate is usually derived from the dissolution of [[gypsum]] or taken directly out of the seawater.  The factors that control whether BSR or TSR will occur are temperature, which is generally a product of depth, with BSR occurring in shallower levels than TSR.  Both can occur within the [[oil window]]. {{Explain|date=March 2017}} Their solid products are similar but can be distinguished from one another [[Petrography|petrographically]], due to their differing crystal sizes, shapes and reflectivity.&lt;ref name=Machel/&gt;

==''δ''&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;S==
Although 25 [[isotope]]s are known for sulfur, only four are [[Stable isotope|stable]] and of geochemical importance.  Of those four, two (&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;S, light and &lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;S, heavy) comprise (99.22%) of S on Earth.  The vast majority (95.02%) of S occurs as &lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;S with only 4.21% in &lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;S.  The ratio of these two isotopes is fixed in our [[solar system]] and has been since its formation.  The bulk Earth sulfur isotopic ratio is thought to be the same as the ratio of 22.22 measured from the [[Canyon Diablo (meteorite)|Canyon Diablo troilite]] (CDT), a [[meteorite]].&lt;ref name="Schlesinger" /&gt;  That ratio is accepted as the international standard and is therefore set at δ0.00.  Deviation from 0.00 is expressed as the [[Δ34S|δ&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;S]] which is a ratio in per mill [[per mil|(‰)]].  Positive values correlate to increased levels of &lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;S, whereas negative values correlate with greater &lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;S in a sample.  
	
Formation of sulfur minerals through non-biogenic processes does not substantially differentiate between the light and heavy isotopes, therefore sulfur values in [[gypsum]] or [[baryte]] should be the same as the overall ratio in the water column at {{clarify|date=March 2017}} their time of precipitation.  Sulfate reduction through biologic activity strongly differentiates between the two isotopes because of the more rapid enzymic reaction with &lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;S.&lt;ref name="Schlesinger"&gt;Schlesinger, W.H., 1997, Biogeochemistry an analysis of global change, 2nd edition: Academic Press, San Diego, California&lt;/ref&gt;  Sulfate metabolism results in an isotopic depletion of -18‰, and repeated cycles of oxidation and reduction can result in values up to -50 ‰.  Average present day seawater values of δ&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;S are on the order of +21‰.  
	
Throughout geologic history the sulfur cycle and the isotopic ratios have coevolved with the biosphere becoming overall more negative with the increases in biologically driven sulfate reduction, but also show substantial positive excursion.  In general positive excursions in the sulfur isotopes mean that there is an excess of pyrite deposition rather than oxidation of sulfide minerals exposed on land.&lt;ref name="Schlesinger" /&gt;

==Evolution of the sulfur cycle==
The isotopic composition of sedimentary sulfides provides primary information on the evolution of the sulfur cycle.

The total inventory of sulfur compounds on the surface of the Earth (nearly {{val|e=22|u=g}} S) represents the total outgassing of sulfur through geologic time.&lt;ref name="Schlesinger" /&gt; Rocks analyzed for sulfur content are generally organic-rich shales meaning they are likely controlled by biogenic sulfur reduction.  Average seawater curves are generated from evaporites deposited throughout geologic time because again, since they do not discriminate between the heavy and light sulfur isotopes, they should mimic the ocean composition at the time of deposition.  
	
4.6 billion years ago (Ga) the Earth formed and had a theoretical δ&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;S value of 0. Since there was no biologic activity on early Earth there would be no [[isotopic fractionation]].  All sulfur in the atmosphere would be released during volcanic eruptions. When the oceans condensed on Earth, the atmosphere was essentially swept clean of sulfur gases, owing to their high solubility in water. Throughout the majority of the [[Archean]] (4.6–2.5&amp;nbsp;Ga) most systems appeared to be sulfate-limited. Some small Archean evaporite deposits require that at least locally elevated concentrations (possibly due to local volcanic activity) of sulfate existed in order for them to be supersaturated and precipitate out of solution.&lt;ref name=Canfieldand&gt;Canfield, D.E. and Raiswell, R., 1999, The evolution of the sulfur cycle: American Journal of Science, vol. 299, p.&amp;nbsp;697-723&lt;/ref&gt;
	
3.8–3.6&amp;nbsp;Ga marks the beginning of the exposed geologic record because this is the age of the oldest rocks on Earth. Metasedimentary rocks from this time still have an isotopic value of 0 because the biosphere was not developed enough (possibly at all) to fractionate sulfur.&lt;ref&gt;(Schidolowski et al. 1983)&lt;/ref&gt;
	
3.5&amp;nbsp;Ga anoxyogenic [[photosynthesis]] is established and provides a weak source of sulfate to the global ocean with sulfate concentrations incredibly low the δ&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;S is still basically 0.&lt;ref name="Canfieldand" /&gt; Shortly after, at 3.4&amp;nbsp;Ga the first evidence for minimal fractionation in evaporitic sulfate in association with [[magma]]tically derived sulfides can be seen in the rock record. This fractionation shows possible evidence for anoxygenic [[phototroph]]ic bacteria.
	
2.8&amp;nbsp;Ga marks the first evidence for oxygen production through photosynthesis. This is important because there cannot be sulfur oxidation without oxygen in the atmosphere. This exemplifies the coevolution of the oxygen and sulfur cycles as well as the biosphere.
	
2.7–2.5&amp;nbsp;Ga is the age of the oldest [[sedimentary rock]]s to have a depleted δ &lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;S which provide the first compelling evidence for sulfate reduction.&lt;ref name="Canfieldand" /&gt; 
	
2.3&amp;nbsp;Ga sulfate increases to more than 1&amp;nbsp;mM; this increase in sulfate is coincident with the "[[Great Oxygenation Event]]", when redox conditions on Earth's surface are thought by most workers to have shifted fundamentally from reducing to oxidizing.&lt;ref name="Lyonset"&gt;(Lyons et al. 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;  This shift would have led to an incredible increase in sulfate weathering which would have led to an increase in sulfate in the oceans. The large isotopic fractionations that would likely be associated with bacteria reduction are produced for the first time. Although there was a distinct rise in seawater sulfate at this time it was likely still only less than 5–15% of present-day levels.&lt;ref name="Lyonset" /&gt; 
	
At 1.8&amp;nbsp;Ga, [[Banded iron formations]] (BIF) are common sedimentary rocks throughout the Archean and [[Paleoproterozoic]]; their disappearance marks a distinct shift in the chemistry of ocean water.  BIFs have alternating layers of [[iron oxide]]s and [[chert]]. BIFs only form if the water is allowed to supersaturate in dissolved iron (Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) meaning there cannot be free oxygen or sulfur in the water column because it would form Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; (rust) or pyrite and precipitate out of solution. Following this supersaturation, the water must become oxygenated in order for the ferric rich bands to precipitate it must still be sulfur poor otherwise pyrite would form instead of Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;. It has been hypothesized that BIFs formed during the initial evolution of photosynthetic organisms that had phases of population growth, causing over production of oxygen. Due to this over production they would poison themselves causing a mass die off, which would cut off the source of oxygen and produce a large amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; through the decomposition of their bodies, allowing for another bacterial bloom. After 1.8&amp;nbsp;Ga sulfate concentrations were sufficient to increase rates of sulfate reduction to greater than the delivery flux of iron to the oceans.&lt;ref name="Canfieldand" /&gt; 
	
Along with the disappearance of BIF, the end of the Paleoproterozoic also marks the first large scale sedimentary exhalative deposits showing a link between mineralization and a likely increase in the amount of sulfate in sea water.  In the Paleoproterozoic the sulfate in seawater had increased to an amount greater than in the Archean, but was still lower than present day values.&lt;ref name="Lyonset" /&gt;  The sulfate levels in the [[Proterozoic]] also act as proxies for atmospheric oxygen because sulfate is produced mostly through weathering of the continents in the presence of oxygen.  The low levels in the Proterozoic simply imply that levels of atmospheric oxygen fell between the abundances of the Phanerozoic and the deficiencies of the Archean.
	
750 million years ago (Ma) there is a renewed deposition of BIF which marks a significant change in ocean chemistry.  This was likely due to [[snowball earth]] episodes where the entire globe including the oceans was covered in a layer of ice cutting off oxygenation.&lt;ref&gt;(Hoffman et al. 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;  In the late [[Neoproterozoic]] high carbon burial rates increased the atmospheric oxygen level to &gt;10% of its present-day value.  In the Latest Neoproterozoic another major oxidizing event occurred on Earth's surface that resulted in an oxic deep ocean and possibly allowed for the appearance of multicellular life.&lt;ref&gt;(Lyons et al., 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;
	
During the last 600 million years, seawater SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; has varied between +10 and +30‰ in δ&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;S, with an average value close to that of today.  This coincides with atmospheric O levels reaching something close to modern values around the [[Precambrian]]–[[Cambrian]] boundary.

Over a shorter time scale (ten million years) changes in the sulfur cycle are easier to observe and can be even better constrained with oxygen isotopes.  Oxygen is continually incorporated into the sulfur cycle through sulfate oxidation and then released when that sulfate is reduced once again.&lt;ref name=Turchyn/&gt;  Since different sulfate sources within the ocean have distinct oxygen isotopic values it may be possible to use oxygen to trace the sulfur cycle.  Biological sulfate reduction preferentially selects lighter oxygen isotopes for the same reason that lighter sulfur isotopes are preferred.  By studying oxygen isotopes in ocean sediments over the last 10 million years &lt;ref&gt;Tychyn et al. (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; were able to better constrain the sulfur concentrations in sea water through that same time.  They found that the [[sea level change]]s due to [[Pliocene]] and [[Pleistocene]] [[glacial]] cycles changed the area of continental shelves which then disrupted the sulfur processing, lowering the concentration of sulfate in the sea water.  This was a drastic change as compared to preglacial times before 2 million years ago.

==Economic importance==
Sulfur is intimately involved in production of [[fossil fuel]]s and a majority of metal deposits because of its ability to act as an oxidizing or reducing agent.  The vast majority of the major mineral deposits on Earth contain a substantial amount of sulfur including, but not limited to: [[sedimentary exhalative deposits]](SEDEX), Mississippi Valley-Type (MVT) and copper porphyry deposits.  Iron sulfides, [[galena]] and [[sphalerite]] will form as by-products of [[hydrogen sulfide]] generation, as long as the respective transition or base metals are present or transported to a sulfate reduction site.&lt;ref name=Machel/&gt;  If the system runs out of reactive hydrocarbons economically viable elemental sulfur deposits may form.  Sulfur also acts as a reducing agent in many natural gas reservoirs and generally ore forming fluids have a close relationship with ancient hydrocarbon seeps or vents.&lt;ref name="Lyonset" /&gt;   
	
Important sources of sulfur in ore deposits are generally deep-seated, but they can also come from local country rocks, sea water, or marine [[evaporite]]s.  The presence or absence of sulfur is one of the limiting factors on both the concentration of precious metals and its precipitation from solution.  pH, temperature and especially redox states determine whether sulfides will precipitate.  Most sulfide brines will remain in concentration until they reach reducing conditions, a higher pH or lower temperatures.  
	
Ore fluids are generally linked to metal rich waters that have been heated within a sedimentary basin under the elevated thermal conditions typically in extensional tectonic settings. The redox conditions of the basin [[Lithology|lithologies]] exert an important control on the redox state of the metal-transporting fluids and deposits can form from both oxidizing and reducing fluids.&lt;ref name="Lyonset" /&gt; Metal-rich ore fluids tend to be by necessity comparatively sulfide deficient, so a substantial portion of the sulfide must be supplied from another source at the site of mineralization. Bacterial reduction of seawater sulfate or a euxinic (anoxic and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S-containing) water column is a necessary source of that sulfide. When present, the δ&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;S values of [[barite]] are generally consistent with a seawater sulfate source, suggesting barite formation by reaction between hydrothermal barium and sulfate in ambient seawater.&lt;ref name="Lyonset" /&gt;

Once fossil fuels or precious metals are discovered and either burned or milled, the sulfur become a waste product which must be dealt with properly or it can become a pollutant.  There has been a great increase in the amount of sulfur in our present day atmosphere because of the burning of fossil fuels.  Sulfur acts as a pollutant and an economic resource at the same time.

==Human impact==

Human activities have a major effect on the global sulfur cycle.  The burning of [[coal]], [[natural gas]], and other [[fossil fuel]]s has greatly increased the amount of S in the atmosphere and ocean and depleted the sedimentary rock sink.  Without human impact sulfur would stay tied up in rocks for millions of years until it was uplifted through [[tectonic]] events and then released through [[erosion]] and [[weathering]] processes.  Instead it is being drilled, pumped and burned at a steadily increasing rate.  Over the most polluted areas there has been a 30-fold increase in sulfate deposition.&lt;ref&gt;(Pham et al., 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;   
	
Although the sulfur curve shows shifts between net sulfur oxidation and net sulfur reduction in the geologic past, the magnitude of the current human impact is probably unprecedented in the geologic record.  Human activities greatly increase the flux of sulfur to the [[atmosphere]], some of which is transported globally.  Humans are mining coal and extracting petroleum from the [[Crust (geology)|Earth's crust]] at a rate that mobilizes 150 x 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; gS/yr, which is more than double the rate of 100 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Brimblecombe, P., Hammer, C., Rodhe, H., Ryaboshapko, A.,  Boutron, C.F., 1989, Human Influences on the sulphur cycle. pp.&amp;nbsp;77–121. In P. Brimblecombe and A.Y. Lein (eds.), Evolution of the Global Biogeochemical Sulphur Cycle, Wiley, New York&lt;/ref&gt;  The result of human impact on these processes is to increase the pool of oxidized sulfur (SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) in the global cycle, at the expense of the storage of reduced sulfur in the Earth's crust.  Therefore, human activities do not cause a major change in the global pools of S, but they do produce massive changes in the annual flux of S through the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;(Schlesinger 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;
	
When SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is emitted as an air pollutant, it forms [[sulfuric acid]] through reactions with water in the atmosphere.  Once the acid is completely dissociated in water the [[pH]] can drop to 4.3 or lower causing damage to both man-made and natural systems.  According to the EPA, [[acid rain]] is a broad term referring to a mixture of wet and dry deposition (deposited material) from the atmosphere containing higher than normal amounts of nitric and sulfuric acids.  Distilled water (water without any dissolved constituents), which contains no [[carbon dioxide]], has a neutral pH of 7.  Rain naturally has a slightly acidic pH of 5.6, because carbon dioxide and water in the air react together to form carbonic acid, a very weak acid. Around Washington, D.C., however, the average rain pH is between 4.2 and 4.4.  Since pH is on a log scale dropping by 1 (the difference between normal rain water and acid rain) has a dramatic effect on the strength of the acid.  In the United States, roughly 2/3 of all SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and 1/4 of all NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; come from electric power generation that relies on burning fossil fuels, like coal.

'''Thermofluids'''&lt;ref&gt;http://mech.ubc.ca/undergraduate-students/thermofluids/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imeche.org/knowledge/industries/thermofluids&lt;/ref&gt; is a branch of science and engineering encompassing four intersecting fields:
*[[Heat transfer]]
*[[Thermodynamics]]
*[[Fluid mechanics]]
*[[Combustion]]

The term is a combination of "thermo", referring to heat, and "fluids", which refers to [[liquid]]s, [[gas]]es and [[vapor]]s. [[Temperature]], [[pressure]], equations of state, and transport laws all play an important role in thermofluid problems.  [[Phase transition]] and [[chemical reactions]] may also be important in a thermofluid context.  The subject is sometimes also referred to as "thermal fluids".

==Heat Transfer==
[[Heat transfer]] is a discipline of [[thermal engineering]] that concerns the transfer of [[thermal energy]] from one physical system to another. Heat transfer is classified into various mechanisms, such as [[heat conduction]], [[convection]], [[thermal radiation]], and phase-change transfer. Engineers also consider the transfer of mass of differing chemical species, either cold or hot, to achieve heat transfer.  

Sections include :
*[[Energy transfer]] by heat, work and mass
*[[Laws of thermodynamics]]
*[[Entropy]]
*[[Refrigeration]] Techniques
*Properties and nature of pure substances

===Applications===
*Engineering : Predicting and analysing the performance of machines

==Thermodynamics==
[[Thermodynamics]] is the science of [[energy]] conversion involving heat and other forms of energy, most notably [[mechanical work]]. It studies and interrelates the [[macroscopic]] variables, such as [[temperature]], [[volume]] and [[pressure]], which describe physical, thermodynamic systems.

==Fluid Mechanics==
[[Fluid Mechanics]] the study of the physical forces at work during fluid flow. Fluid mechanics can be divided into fluid [[kinematics]], the study of fluid motion, and [[fluid dynamics]], the study of the effect of forces on fluid motion, which can further be divided into fluid statics, the study of fluids at rest, and fluid kinetics, the study of fluids in motion. Some of its more interesting concepts include [[momentum]] and reactive forces in fluid flow and fluid machinery theory and performance.

Sections include:
*[[Fluid flow]] and continuity
*[[Momentum]] in fluids
*Static and dynamic forces on a boundary
*[[Laminar flow|Laminar]] and turbulent flow
*Metacentric height and vessel stability

===Applications===
*Pump Design.
*Hydro-Electric Power Generation.
*Naval Architecture.

==Combustion==
[[Combustion]] is the sequence of [[exothermic]] chemical reactions between a [[fuel]] and an [[oxidant]] accompanied by the production of [[heat]] and conversion of chemical species. The release of heat can result in the production of light  in the form of either glowing or a [[flame]]. Fuels of interest often include organic compounds (especially [[hydrocarbons]]) in the gas, liquid or solid phase.

'''Urticating hairs''' or '''urticating bristles''', i.e. irritating hairs, are one of the primary [[Antipredator adaptation|defense mechanism]]s used by numerous plants, almost all New World [[tarantula]]s, and various lepidopteran caterpillars. ''Urtica'' is Latin for "nettle" (stinging nettles are in the genus ''[[Urtica]]''), and hairs that urticate are characteristic of this type of plant, and many other plants in several families. This term also refers to certain types of barbed hairs that cover the dorsal and posterior surface of a tarantula's or caterpillar's abdomen. Many tarantula species eject hairs from their abdomens, directing them toward potential attackers. These hairs can embed themselves in the other animal's skin or eyes, causing physical irritation, usually to great discomfort.

==In plants==
[[File:Urtica dioica stinging hair.jpg|thumb|Urticating hairs of a [[stinging nettle]]]]
The most common form of urticating hairs in plants are typified by nettles, which possess sharp-pointed hollow hairs seated on a gland that secretes an acrid fluid. The points of these hairs usually break off in the wound, and the acrid fluid is pressed into it. Various plants unrelated to true nettles (''Urtica'' species) possess similar defensive hairs, and the common names often reflect this (e.g. "[[Cnidoscolus stimulosus|bull nettle]]").

==In Lepidoptera==
[[File:Eutricha capensis Lasiocampidae larval anterior.jpg|thumb|The larva of ''[[Eutricha capensis]]'' in the family [[Lasiocampidae]] is practically covered with urticaceous hairs, but the worst of them are the stiff, shortish ones in the orange and dark-maroon bands across the thorax]]
[[File:Taturana.JPG|thumb|Larva of ''[[Lonomia obliqua]]'', the most toxicologically significant species of the genus; severe cases of its sting are life-threatening and require treatment with [[antivenom]]]]

Several [[lepidoptera]]n families include species whose larvae bear urticating hairs. Families prominent in this respect include the following:&lt;ref&gt;Matheson 1950&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Riley and Johannsen 1938&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roth and Eisner 1962&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wirtz 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

{{div col end}}

Adults of some species also have urticating scales, and some species shed some of their urticating hairs as defense for their pupae and eggs.

The urticating setae or spines can cause irritation when they break off and lodge in skin. In some species these structures are hollow and connected to [[venom]]-producing cells, functioning like a [[hypodermic needle]]. Generally most hairs are only irritating, but some are dangerous to the eyes and respiratory tract, and some can cause severe skin necrosis and shedding. Certain species of ''[[Lonomia]]'' in the family [[Saturniidae]] actually can inject venom that is life-threatening to humans.&lt;ref&gt;Pinto, Antônio F.M.; Berger, Markus; Reck, José, Jr.; Terra, Renata M.S.; Guimarães, Jorge A. ''Lonomia obliqua'' venom: In vivo effects and molecular aspects associated with the hemorrhagic syndrome. ''Toxicon''. Volume 56, Issue 7, 15 December 2010, pages 1103–1112&lt;/ref&gt;

The stings are not part of a deliberate attack, but are mainly the result of brushing against the spines. However, many species whose larvae are armed with such hairs have behavioral patterns adapted to present the urticating hairs as a defensive threat and to inflict them on any perceived attackers. For example, many larvae in the family Lasiocampidae bear dense bands of short stinging hairs across their [[Thorax (insect anatomy)|thoracic]] segments. The hairs are normally retracted into a shallow fold in the skin, but if the caterpillar is disturbed, it everts the folds and displays the hairs, which are usually of a contrasting color.

If seriously stimulated or gripped, lasiocampid larvae are likely to lash about, forcing the stinging hairs into any vulnerable organ within reach. Many other species of larvae lack any such localized concentrations of hairs and are armed more generally with urticating hairs; even so, they too will lash about frantically if disturbed, making them difficult to handle without suitable equipment. Toxins from the broken hairs may spill out, causing [[dermatitis]] on the surface of the skin.&lt;ref&gt;[https://extension.umd.edu/sites/default/files/_docs/programs/ipmnet/StingingCaterpillarsInMaryland-UMD.pdf Stinging Caterpillars Found In Maryland] University of Maryland Extension (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; For [[brown-tail moth]]s (Euproctis chrysorrhoea) native to Europe and invasive in other parts of the world, hairs are shed or broken off during molts and can be wind-borne, so that direct contact with live or dead larvae is not required to trigger a rash.&lt;ref name=MainePDF&gt;[https://www.maine.gov/dacf/mfs/forest_health/documents/browntail_moth_brochure.pdf Browntail Moth] Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (accessed 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of such defenses, some species of birds feed avidly on hairy caterpillars. Usually they grab them in their beaks and scrub them on the ground till the majority of the hairs have been stripped or damaged, but at least some species of cuckoos apparently collect the hairs in the digestive tract until they form pellets that can be regurgitated. Examples of avian predators other than cuckoos that feed on hairy caterpillars include at least tens of species from several continents.&lt;ref name="Wyllie1981"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian Wyllie|title=The Cuckoo|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JkVHAAAAYAAJ|year=1981|publisher=Universe Books|isbn=978-0-87663-371-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCullough, Deborah G., Raffa Kenneth A., Chris Williamson R.

==In tarantulas==

Urticating hairs (setae) are found in about 90% of the species of [[tarantula]] (spiders of the family Theraphosidae) found in the [[New World]]. They are not found in tarantulas from other parts of the world.&lt;ref name=BertGuad13/&gt;

===Development===

Urticating hairs do not appear at birth but form with each consecutive [[molt]], widening from molt to molt and outwardly presenting themselves around areas of more dark hairs on the upper back part of the abdomen of juveniles. In elder ages their coloration shifts to match the main tone of abdomen. Despite this shift, urticating hairs nonetheless retain unique characteristics that render them visually distinct from abdominal hairs, such as their tendency to cover only a portion instead of the entirety of the [[opisthosoma]].

===Types===

There are six different types of urticating hair known in tarantulas, varying in size and shape, particularly the distribution of barbs.&lt;ref name=BertGuad13&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Bertani |first1=Rogério |last2=Guadanucci |first2=José Paulo Leite |date=2013 |title=Morphology, evolution and usage of urticating setae by tarantulas (Araneae: Theraphosidae) |journal=Zoologia (Curitiba) |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=403–418 |doi=10.1590/S1984-46702013000400006 |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Type I (0.2–0.6&amp;nbsp;mm)
* Type II (0.5–1.5&amp;nbsp;mm)
* Type III (0.3–1.2&amp;nbsp;mm)
* Type IV (0.06–0.2&amp;nbsp;mm)
* Type V
* Type VI

Each type of urticating hair is believed to target different enemies. Defined targets for some hair types are unknown.

Type II is usually not kicked off by the tarantula, rather delivered by direct contact. However, there is at least one aviculariine species - ''[[Caribena versicolor]]'' - which can kick type II urticating hairs off of the abdomen, similarly to species from the subfamily Theraphosinae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bertani |first=R. |authorlink=Rogério Bertani |author2=Boston, T. |author3=Evenou, Y. |author4= Guadanucci, J.P.L.  |year=2003 |title=Release of urticating hairs by ''Avicularia versicolor'' (Walckenaer, 1837) (Araneae, Theraphosidae) |journal=Bulletin of the British Arachnological Society |volume=12|issue=9|pages=395–398}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tarantulas from the genera ''[[Avicularia]]'', ''[[Pachistopelma]]'' and ''[[Iridopelma]]'' possess Type II hairs. (Toni Hoover, 1997)

Type III urticating hairs are most efficient for defense against vertebrates and invertebrates.

Types III and IV are the most irritating to mammalian predators.

===Types particular to species===
[[File:Brachypelma smithi, urticating hairs.JPG|right|thumb|An adult female of ''[[Brachypelma smithi]]'', showing a bald patch after kicking hairs off of her abdomen. After molting, the hairs will grow again.]]
Not all urticating hair types are exhibited by each species of tarantula.

Type II urticating hairs can be found in the genera ''[[Avicularia]]'', ''[[Iridopelma]]'' and ''[[Pachistopelma]]'' (subfamily Aviculariinae).

Type I and III urticating hairs are representative on a wide diversity of large bodied genera in the subfamily Theraphosinae ''[[Lasiodora]]'' and ''[[Acanthoscurria]]'' ''[[Nhandu]] spp.'', ''[[Megaphobema]] spp.'', ''[[Sericopelma]] spp.'', ''[[Eupalaestrus]] spp.'', ''[[Proshapalopus]] spp.'', ''[[Brachypelma]] spp.'', ''[[Cyrtopholis]] spp.'',  and others, although some only have Type I in mature males. Unusually, Type III urticating hair is found alone on the species of ''[[Theraphosa]] spp.'', but these otherwise are similar to many species that also have Type I hairs.

Type III alone is found in many 'dwarf' new world genera "Hapalopus spp." etc.

Type IV is found in several South American genera ''[[Grammostola]]'', "Euathlus" etc (exhibits types III and IV).

Type V urticating hair is typical of the species of genus ''[[Ephebopus]]''. They are located on the pedipalps. They are much shorter and lighter in contrast with other types of urticating hair. These are easily thrown by the spider into the air (Marshal and Uetz, 1990).

Type VI urticating hair is found in the genus ''[[Hemirrhagus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;F. Perez-Miles, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Genera with the most urticating hairs are ''Lasiodora'', ''Grammostola'' and ''Acanthoscurria''.&lt;ref&gt;Vellard (1936)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buecherl (1951)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defensive behavior===

[[New World]] tarantulas will, at the moment of danger, turn toward the attacker and briskly rub their hind legs against the [[opisthosoma]] throwing the urticating hairs in the direction of the enemy.  The cloud of small hairs will get into the mucous membrane of small mammals and cause [[edema]], which can be fatal.  The latest studies{{which|date=January 2010}} suggest these hairs cause both mechanical and chemical harm to the skin and membranes.

Reaction and the degree of irritation to a defensive urticating hair barrage can vary tremendously, based on the species in question.  Some, such as those of the [[Chilean rose tarantula]] (''Grammastola rosea'') and the [[Pinktoe tarantula]] (''Avicularia avicularia''), are fairly mild and innocuous to humans.  Others, such as those of the [[Brazilian giant white knee tarantula]] (''Acanthoscurria geniculata''), are moderately irritating.  Still others, such as the [[Goliath Birdeater]] (''Theraphosa blondi''), are far more severe.  These hairs can result in painful rashes, and have been likened to sharp shards of fiberglass.

After kicking urticating hairs, the Tarantula will have a bald spot on its abdominal region.

===As territorial markings===

Urticating hairs are not just thrown at an enemy as a first line defense, but are also used as an indication of territory. They can be found on and around the burrow entrance and in webbing for protection (for example, some subfamily Theraphosinae species include these hairs in cocoon silk).

Urticating hairs can also be found protecting tarantula egg sacs (''Avicularia'' spp. and ''Theraphosa blondi'' respectively). This is thought to discourage [[Fly|fly larvae]] from consuming their eggs and young. 
&lt;!--

BEGIN COMMENT: The below text was originally placed in the article but later removed pending review and finding if it should be included in an article on Urticating Hair as it really has more to do with Tarantula Defence.

Tarantulas without urticating hairs have other means of defence. Their first line defence is an aggressive stance with the front legs in the air, body weight on the hind legs. The cheliceras (fangs) bared. This stance is followed by an attack. The species [[''Stromatopelma griseipes]]'', ''[[Citharischius crawshayi]]'', ''[[Pterinochilus murinus]]'' and the subfamily[[Ornithoctoninae]] are examples of Old World tarantulas that use this defence.

Such behaviour is not typical of New World tarantulas. Old World tarantulas are more aggressive and their venom is more toxic than New World tarantulas.

It is interesting to note that urticating hairs are absolutely absent in Old World (Asian &amp; African) tarantulas.

[[File:Yard Sale Northern CA 2005.JPG|thumb|A yard sale is a common place to find cheap used goods.]]

A '''secondhand''' or '''used good''' is a piece of [[personal property]] that is being purchased by or otherwise transferred to a second or later [[end user]]. A ''used'' [[Good (economics and accounting)|good]] can also simply mean it is no longer in the same condition as it was when transferred to the current owner. When the term ''used'' means that an item has expended its purpose (such as a used [[diaper]]), it is typically called [[garbage]], instead. 

Used goods may be transferred informally between friends and family for free as '''hand-me-downs'''.  They may be sold for a fraction of their original price at [[garage sale]]s, in [[bazaar|bazaar-style]] fundraisers, in privately owned consignment shops, or through [[Online auction|online auctions]]. Some things are typically sold in specialized shops, such as a [[Used car dealer|car dealership]] that specializes in the sale of used vehicles or a [[used bookstore]] that sells [[Used book|used books]].  In other cases, such as a [[charity shop]], a wide variety of used goods might be handled by the same establishment.  High-value used luxury goods, such as antique furniture, jewelry, watches, and artwork, might be sold through a generic [[auction house]] such as [[Sotheby's]] or a more specialized niche like [https://www.bobswatches.com Bob's Watches].

Governments require some used goods to be sold through regulated markets, as in the case of items which have safety and legal issues, such as used firearms or cars.  For these items, government licensing bodies require certification and registration of the sale, to prevent the sale of stolen, unregistered, or unsafe goods. For some high-value used goods, such as cars and motorcycles, governments regulate sales of used goods to ensure that the government gets its sales tax revenue from the sale.

==Benefits==
Secondhand goods can benefit the purchaser as the price paid is lower than that of the same items bought new. If the reduction in price more than compensates for the possibly shorter remaining lifetime, lack of warranty, and so on, there is a net benefit.

Selling unwanted goods secondhand instead of discarding them obviously benefits the seller.

[[Recycling]] goods through the secondhand market reduces use of resources in manufacturing new goods, and diminishes waste which must be disposed of, both of which are significant environmental benefits. However, manufacturers who profit from sales of new goods lose corresponding sales. Scientific research shows that buying used goods reduces carbon footprint and [[CO2]] emissions significantly compared to the complete product life cycle, because of less production, raw material sourcing and logistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.citeulike.org/article/9832067|title=Impact of closed-loop network configurations on carbon footprints: A case study in copiers|first=Harold|last=Krikke|date=1 October 2011|publisher=|journal=Resources, Conservation and Recycling|volume=55|issue=12|pages=1196–1205|accessdate=25 May 2018|doi=10.1016/j.resconrec.2011.07.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often the relative carbon footprint of production, raw material sourcing and the [[supply chain]] is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.durabilit.eu/Plone/news/how-to-reduce-your-company2019s-carbon-footprint-2013-by-reuse http://www.durabilit.eu/Plone/news/how-to-reduce-your-company2019s-carbon-footprint-2013-by-reuse] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819083915/http://www.durabilit.eu/Plone/news/how-to-reduce-your-company2019s-carbon-footprint-2013-by-reuse |date=2014-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A scientific methodology has been made to analyze how much CO2 emissions are reduced when buying used goods like secondhand hardware versus new hardware.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.future-science.com/doi/full/10.4155/cmt.11.29 Scientific Greener CO2 calculator for reuse] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130124001944/http://www.future-science.com/doi/full/10.4155/cmt.11.29 |date=2013-01-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quality secondhand goods can be more durable than equivalent new goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/nov/28/buying-secondhand-an-alternative-to-rampant-consumerism-of-black-friday|title=Buying secondhand: an alternative to rampant consumerism of Black Friday|first1=Sarah|last1=LaBrecque|first2=Hannah|last2=Gould|date=28 November 2014|website=the Guardian|accessdate=25 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risks==
Secondhand goods may have faults which are not apparent even if examined; purchasing sight unseen, for example, from an [[Internet auction]] site, has further unknowns. Goods may cause problems beyond their value; for example, furniture may have not easily seen [[Bed bug (insect)|bedbug]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11915026/ns/dateline_nbc-dont_let_the_bed_bugs_bite/t/what-you-need-know-about-bed-bugs/ Msnbc: What you need to know about bed bugs]: "Do not buy used furniture (especially bedding items or upholstered items) ... until inspected carefully for any signs of bedbugs"&lt;/ref&gt; which may cause an infestation which is difficult and expensive to eradicate. Faulty electrical and mechanical goods can be hazardous and dangerous. This is especially a big issue if sold to countries that do not have recycling facilities for these devices, which has led to an issue with [[electronic waste]].

==Types of transfers==
Many items that are considered obsolete and worthless in [[developed countries]], such as decade-old hand tools and clothes, are useful and valuable in impoverished communities in the country or in [[developing countries]]. Underdeveloped countries like Zambia are extremely welcoming to donated secondhand clothing. At a time when the country's economy was in severe decline, the used goods provided jobs by keeping "many others busy with repairs and alterations".&lt;ref name="Karen Tranberg-Hansen 2004"&gt;Karen Tranberg-Hansen. 2004. Helping or hindering? Controversies around the international second-hand clothing trade. Anthropology Today 20(4):3-9.&lt;/ref&gt; It has created a type of spin-off economy at a time when many Zambians were out of work. The used garments and materials that were donated to the country also allowed for the production of "a wide range of fabrics" whose imports had been previously restricted.&lt;ref name="Karen Tranberg-Hansen 2004" /&gt; The trade is essentially executed by women who operate their small business based on local associations and networks. Not only does this provide self-employment, but it also increases household income and enhances the economy.&lt;ref name="Karen Tranberg-Hansen 2004" /&gt; But while many countries would be welcoming of secondhand goods, it is also true that there are countries in need who refuse donated items. Countries like Poland, Philippines and Pakistan have been known to reject secondhand items for "fear of venereal disease and risk to personal hygiene".&lt;ref name="Karen Tranberg-Hansen 2004" /&gt;  Similar to these countries, India also refuses the [[Global trade of secondhand clothing|import of secondhand clothing]] but will accept the import of wool fibers, including ''mutilated hosiery'' which is a term meaning "woollen garments shredded by machine in the West prior to export".&lt;ref name="Karen Tranberg-Hansen 2004" /&gt; Through the production of ''[[shoddy]]'' (recycled wool), most of which is produced in Northern India today, unused clothing can be recycled into fibres that are spun into yarn for reuse in 'new' used goods.&lt;ref name="Karen Tranberg-Hansen 2004" /&gt; 

United States taxpayers can deduct donations of used goods to charitable organizations. Both [[Goodwill Industries]] and the [[The Salvation Army|Salvation Army]] websites have lists of items with their estimated range of values. Another way that people transfer used goods is by giving them to friends or relatives. When a person gives an item of some value that they have used to someone else, such as a used car or a winter coat, it is sometimes referred to as a "hand-me-down".

[[File:Ebayscreen.png|thumb|[[Online auction]] sites have become a popular way to sell used goods in recent years.]]

Used items can often be found for sale in [[thrift store]]s and [[pawnshop]]s, [[auction]]s, [[garage sale]]s, and in more recent times [[online auction]]s. Some stores sell both new and used goods (e.g. [[car dealership]]s), while others only sell new goods but may take used items in exchange for credit toward the purchase of newer goods. For example, some musical instrument stores and high-end audio stores only sell new gear, but they will accept good quality used items as trade ins towards the purchase of new items; after the store purchases the used items, they then sell them using online auctions or other services.

When an item is no longer of use to a person they may sell or ''pawn'' it, especially when they are in need of [[money]]. Items can also be sold (or taken away free of cost) as [[scrap]] (e.g. a broken-down old car will be towed away for free for its scrap metal value). Owners may sell the good themselves or to a dealer who then sells it on for a profit. They may also choose to give it away to another person this is often referred to as [[freecycling]]. However, because the process takes some effort on part of the owner they may simply keep possession of it or dump it at a [[landfill]] instead of going to the trouble of selling it. It has been common to buy secondhand or used good on markets or bazaars for long time. When the web became popular, it became common with websites such as [[eBay]] and [[Yahoo!|Yahoo! Classifieds]].

==Purchases==
[[File:Landfill compactor.jpg|thumb|left|As dumped used goods take up space in landfills, some may purchase them for [[environmentalism|environmental motivations]].]]

The strategy of buying used items is employed by some to save [[money]], as they are typically worth less than the equivalent new items. Purchasing used items for [[reuse]] prevents them from becoming [[waste]] and saves costly production of equivalent new goods. Motivations for purchase include conserving [[natural resource]]s and protecting the [[natural environment|environment]], and may form part of a [[simple living]] plan.

==Types==

===Cars===
{{Main article|Used car}}
[[File:Toyota Corolla AE82 Sweden.JPG|thumb|Used cars like this 1980s-era [[Toyota Corolla]] are very inexpensive, but a buyer runs the risk of getting stuck with a [[Lemon (automobile)|lemon]].]]

Used [[Automobile|cars]] are especially notable for depreciating in value much faster than many other items.  Used cars may have been bought or [[lease]]d by their previous user, and may be purchased directly from the previous owner or through a dealer. [[George Akerlof]] published a paper entitled "[[The Market for Lemons]]", examining the effects of [[information asymmetry]] on the used car market. Used cars may require more maintenance or have fewer features than later equivalent models.

=== Books ===
{{Main|Used book}}
Used books are often re-sold through a [[used bookstore]].  They may also be given away, perhaps as part of a program such as the [[Little Free Library|Little Free Library's]] programs.  Used bookstores may also sell secondhand music recordings or videos.

=== Used clothing ===
In developed countries, unwanted used clothing is often donated to charities that sort and sell it. Some of these distribute some of the clothing to people on low incomes for free or a very low price. Others sell all of the collected clothing in bulk to a commercial used clothing redistributor, and then use the raised funds to finance their activities.&lt;ref name="tsun2007"&gt;[http://www.torontosun.com/News/TorontoAndGTA/2007/01/11/3299397-sun.html Old duds, big bucks; Clothes you think you're donating to charity are frequently sold for profit] [[Toronto Sun]], 2007-Jan-11, retrieved 2007-Apr-16.&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., almost 5 billion pounds of clothing is donated to charity shops each year.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.racked.com/platform/amp/2018/3/13/17082288/used-clothing-mexico-goodwill|title=Here’s What Really Happens to Your Used Clothes - Racked|last=Guo|first=Eileen|date=13 March 2018|website=Racked|publisher=Vox Media|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Only about 10% of it can be re-sold by the charity shops.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; About a third of the donated clothing is bought, usually in bulk and at a heavy discount, by commercial dealers and fabric recyclers, who export it to other countries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Some of the used clothes are also smuggled into Mexico.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Used clothing unsuitable for sale in an affluent market may still find a buyer or end-user in another market, such as a student market or a less affluent region of a developing country. In developing countries, such as [[Zambia]], secondhand clothing is sorted, recycled and sometimes redistributed to other nations. Some of the scraps are kept and used to create unique fashions which enable the locals to construct identity. Not only does the trade represent a great source of employment for women as well as men, it also supports other facets of the economy: the merchants buy timber and other materials for their stands, metal hangers to display clothing, and food and drinks for customers. Carriers also find work as they transport the garments from factories to various locations. The secondhand clothing trade is central to the lives of many citizens dwelling in such countries.&lt;ref name="Karen Tranberg-Hansen 2004" /&gt; A dress agent will often deal with a buyer and seller directly, taking unwanted clothes that still have value, and reselling them in a shop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cosmood.com/?module=articles&amp;id=1 |title=Second hand by cosmood |publisher=cosmood.com |date=2017-08-02 |accessdate=2017-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Importation of used clothing is sometimes opposed by the [[textile industry]] in developing countries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They are concerned that fewer people will buy the new clothes that they make when it is cheaper to buy imported used clothing. Nearly all the clothes made in Mexico are intended for export, and the Mexican textile industry opposes the importation of used clothes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Other items ===
The Sierra Club, an environmental organization, argues that secondhand purchasing of furniture is the "greenest" way of furnishing a home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sierraclub.typepad.com/greenlife/2008/09/green-your-re-1.html|title=Green Your Rental - Eco Furnishings - The Green Life|date=2008-09-30|publisher=Sierraclub.typepad.com|accessdate=2012-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Vintage guitar]]s also became increasingly desired objects among musicians and collectors during the nineties and afterwards.  Some music stores specialize in selling used musical instruments, used copies of printed music, and related paraphernalia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2432">'''Virtual instrumentation''' is the use of customizable software and modular measurement hardware to create user-defined measurement systems, ''called virtual instruments''. 

Traditional hardware instrumentation systems are made up of pre-defined hardware components, such as [[digital multimeter]]s and [[oscilloscope]]s that are completely specific to their stimulus, analysis, or measurement function.  Because of their hard-coded function, these systems are more limited in their versatility than virtual instrumentation systems.  The primary difference between hardware instrumentation and virtual instrumentation is that software is used to replace a large amount of hardware. The software enables complex and expensive hardware to be replaced by already purchased computer hardware; e. g. [[analog-to-digital converter]] can act as a hardware complement of a virtual [[oscilloscope]], a [[potentiostat]] enables [[frequency response]] acquisition and analysis in [[electrochemical impedance spectroscopy]] with virtual instrumentation. 

The concept of a [[synthetic instrument]] is a subset of the virtual instrument concept. A synthetic instrument is a kind of virtual instrument that is purely software defined. A synthetic instrument performs a specific synthesis, analysis, or measurement function on completely generic, measurement agnostic hardware. Virtual instruments can still have measurement specific hardware, and tend to emphasize modular hardware approaches that facilitate this specificity. Hardware supporting synthetic instruments is by definition ''not'' specific to the measurement, nor is it necessarily (or usually) modular. 

Leveraging commercially available technologies, such as the PC and the [[analog-to-digital converter]], virtual instrumentation has grown significantly since its inception in the late 1970s.  Additionally, software packages like [[National Instruments]]' [[LabVIEW]] and other [[graphical programming]] languages helped grow adoption by making it easier for non-programmers to develop systems.

The newly updated technology called "HARD VIRTUAL INSTRUMENTATION" is developed by some companies. It is said that with this technology the execution of the software is done by the hardware itself which can help in fast real time processing.

'''Water stagnation''' occurs when [[water]] stops [[Environmental flow|flowing]]. '''Stagnant water''' can be a major [[environmental hazard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/general-article/panama-fever/ |title=General Article: Yellow Fever and Malaria in the Canal |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2010 |website=Panama Canal (film) |series=American Experience |publisher=WGBH Educational Foundation |location=Boston, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dangers==
[[Malaria]] and [[dengue]] are among the main dangers of stagnant water, which can become a breeding ground for the [[mosquitoes]] that transmit these diseases.&lt;ref name="WHO health risks"&gt;{{cite report |date=2013 |title=Health Risks Associated with Stagnant Water |series=Recommendations for Occupational Health and Safety Following Disasters |url=http://www.wpro.who.int/philippines/typhoon_haiyan/media/health_risks_associated_with_stagnant_water.pdf |publisher=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stagnant water can be dangerous for drinking because it provides a better incubator than running water for many kinds of [[bacteria]] and [[parasite]]s. Stagnant water is often contaminated with [[human]] and [[animal]] [[feces]], particularly in [[deserts]] or other areas of low rain.&lt;ref name="WHO health risks"/&gt;

Stagnant water may be classified into the following basic, although overlapping, types:

* Water body stagnation (stagnation in swamp, lake, lagoon, river, etc.)
* Surface and ground waters stagnation
* Trapped water stagnation. The water may be trapped in human artifacts (discarded cans, plant pots, tires, dug-outs, roofs, etc.), as well as in natural containers, such as hollow tree trunks, leaf sheath etc.

To avoid ground and surface water stagnation, [[drainage]] of surface and [[subsoil]] is advised. Areas with a shallow water table are more susceptible to ground water stagnation due to the lower availability of natural soil drainage.

==Life that may thrive in stagnant water==
Some plants prefer flowing water, while others, such as [[Lotus (genus)|lotus]]es, prefer stagnant water.

Various [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] [[bacteria]] are commonly found in stagnant water &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cabral|first1=João|title=Water Microbiology. Bacterial Pathogens and Water|journal=International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health|date=October 10, 2010|pmc=2996186|pmid=21139855|doi=10.3390/ijerph7103657|volume=7|pages=3657–703}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  For this reason, pools of stagnant water have historically been used in processing [[hemp]] and some other [[fiber crops]], as well as [[Tilia|linden]] [[Bark (botany)|bark]] used for making [[bast shoe]]s. Several weeks of soaking makes [[bast fiber]]s easily separable due to bacterial and fermentative processes known as [[retting]].

In [[architecture]], a '''waterleaf''' is a distinctive [[sculpture|sculptural]] motif used on the [[capital (architecture)|capitals]] of [[column]]s and pillars in [[Europe]]an buildings during the late twelfth century. It is a highly simplified plant motif, characteristic of the "late [[Norman architecture|Norman]]" style of [[Romanesque architecture]]. 

A '''waterleaf capital''' is formed of broad, smooth leaf-shapes (typically four in number), unribbed except for a central fold, which curve upward and outward before curling over at the tips where they meet the [[abacus (architecture)|abacus]] (the flat slab at the top of the column, normally square but sometimes [[octagon]]al). The curled tip of the waterleaf may be small and neat or large and bulbous; it usually curves inward towards the abacus, but may occasionally turn outwards (both forms can sometimes be seen in adjacent capitals of the same period, as for example at [[Geddington]], Northamptonshire, UK.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crsbi.ac.uk/search/location/geddington*/site/ed-nh-geddi.html ''The Corpus of'' ROMANESQUE SCULPTURE ''in Britain and Ireland'' (CRSBI) website:] Geddington&lt;/ref&gt;).

The '''Weibull modulus''' is a [[Dimensionless quantity|dimensionless parameter]] of the [[Weibull distribution]] which is used to describe variability in measured [[strength of materials|material strength]] of brittle materials. 

For [[ceramic materials|ceramics]] and other brittle materials, the maximum [[stress (physics)|stress]] that a sample can be measured to withstand before failure may vary from specimen to specimen, even under identical testing conditions. This is related to the distribution of physical flaws present in the surface or body of the brittle specimen, since brittle failure processes originate at these weak points. When flaws are consistent and evenly distributed, samples will behave more uniformly than when flaws are clustered inconsistently. This must be taken into account when describing the strength of the material, so strength is best represented as a distribution of values rather than as one specific value. The Weibull modulus is a shape parameter for the [[Weibull distribution]] model which, in this case, maps the probability of failure of a component at varying stresses.

Consider strength measurements made on many small samples of a brittle ceramic material. If the measurements show little [[Statistical dispersion|variation]] from sample to sample, the calculated Weibull modulus will be high and a single strength value would serve as a good description of the sample-to-sample performance. It may be concluded that its physical flaws, whether inherent to the material itself or resulting from the manufacturing process, are distributed uniformly throughout the material. If the measurements show high variation, the calculated Weibull modulus will be low; this reveals that flaws are clustered inconsistently and the measured strength will be generally weak and variable. Products made from components of low Weibull modulus will exhibit low reliability and their strengths will be broadly distributed.

Test procedures for determining the Weibull modulus are specified in DIN EN 843-5 and DIN 51 110-3.

A further method to determine the strength of brittle materials has been described by the Wikibook contribution [[Wikibooks:Strength of materials/Weakest link determination by use of three parameter Weibull statistics|Weakest link determination by use of three parameter Weibull statistics]].

==Definition==

If the [[probability distribution]] of the strength, ''X'', is a [[Weibull distribution]] with its [[Probability density function|density]] given by 

:&lt;math&gt;f(x; x_0,\lambda,k) =  \begin{cases}
\frac{k}{\lambda}\left(\frac{x-x_0}{\lambda}\right)^{k-1}e^{-((x-x_0)/\lambda)^{k}} &amp; x\geq x_0 ,\\
0 &amp; x&lt; x_0 ,\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

then ''k'' is the Weibull modulus.

The value of k shows the kind of failure being experienced. If k&lt;1, then the failure rate decreases with time. This implies that the weak and defective parts fail in the beginning, with the harder sections surviving. If k=1, the rate of failure remains constant. This implies that there is random failure occurring. Thus, there should be some external factor strong enough to cause random failure irrespective of whether the section is strong or weak. If the value of k&gt;1, the rate of failure increases over time. This points to some kind of ageing process, the weakening of the material with the passage of time.
