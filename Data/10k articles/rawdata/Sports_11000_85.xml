The '''1933 Chatham Cup''' was the 11th annual nationwide knockout [[association football|football]] competition in [[New Zealand]].

The competition was run on a regional basis, with seven regional associations (Auckland, Walkato, Wellington, Manawatu, Buller, Canterbury, and Otago) each holding separate qualifying rounds.

Teams taking part in the final rounds are known to have included [[Ponsonby (soccer)|Ponsonby]], [[Hamilton Wanderers]], [[St. Andrews FC|St. Andrews]] (Manawatu), [[Waterside (Wellington)]], [[Riccarton (soccer)|Riccarton]], [[Millerton All Blacks]] and [[Maori Hill (soccer)|Maori Hill]] (Dunedin).

==The 1933 final==
Ponsonby won their second title, having previously held the cup in 1927. [[John Morrison (footballer)|John Morrison]] and [[Bob Innes (New Zealand footballer)|Bob Innes]] were the only two players to have been in both winning teams. Millerton reached the final for the second consecutive time, but again finished runners-up. In the final, Millerton dominated the first half but were unable to beat the Ponsonby defence. [[Jack Jepson]] put the Auckland side up after 20 minutes against the run of play, and Innes doubled the lead before the break through a defensive mistake. In the second spell [[Tom Pollock]] pulled a goal back for Millerton, but they were unable to get a second breakthrough, despite having several good chances.&lt;ref&gt;{{HiltonNZAssoc}} p.69&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cheshire Cup''' is an annual [[rugby union]] knock-out club competition organized by the [[Cheshire Rugby Football Union]]. It was first introduced in the 1877–78 season as the Cheshire Challenge County Cup and the inaugural competition was won by [[Birkenhead Park FC|Birkenhead Park]], who along with eight other local sides including [[New Brighton F.C. (rugby union)|New Brighton]] and [[Sale Sharks|Sale]], made up the club members of the Cheshire RFU at that time. Four years later the cup was discontinued due to arguments over whether cup ties were beneficial to the county game. The Cheshire RFU reintroduced the cup during the 1969–70 season, with Sale the first winners of the competition in over 80 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite  web|url=http://www.cheshirerfu.co.uk/archive/HISTORY%20OF%20RUGBY%20UNION%201876%20TO%201976/THE%20HISTORY%20OF%20CHESHIRE%20RUGBY%20FOOTBALL%20UNION%201876%20-%201976.pdf |title=The History Of Cheshire Rugby Football Union 1876–1976  |publisher=Cheshire RFU|accessdate=20 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cheshire Cup is currently the premier county cup competition for club sides in tier 4 ([[National League 2 North]]) and tier 5 ([[National League 3 North]] or [[National League 3 Midlands]]) of the English rugby union system that are based in either [[Cheshire]], [[Merseyside]] or the [[Isle of Man]]. Originally it was the only men's county cup competition but plate, shield and bowl competitions have been introduced over the years for lower ranked clubs. The current format is as a knock-out cup with a quarter-final, semi-final and final which is held at a neutral venue during the latter stages of the season (March–May).  At present Cheshire Cup finals are held on the same date and at the same venue as [[Cheshire RFU Plate|Cheshire Plate]] finals.

[[File:Michigan attempts an empty net goal.JPG|250px|thumb|right|The [[Michigan Wolverines men's ice hockey|Michigan Wolverines]] attempt an empty net goal against the [[Ferris State Bulldogs men's ice hockey|Ferris State Bulldogs]].]]
An '''empty net goal''', or colloquially an '''empty netter''' (abbreviated as '''EN''' or '''ENG'''), occurs in [[ice hockey]] when a team scores a [[goal (ice hockey)|goal]] into a net with no [[goaltender]] ''(goalie)'' present.  The Dallas Stars currently hold the NHL record for most empty net goals in a season.

Empty net goals usually occur in one of two different occasions: 
#Usually in about the last two minutes of a game, if a team is within two goals, they will often ''pull the goalie'', leaving the net defenseless, for an [[extra attacker]], in order to have a better chance of scoring to either tie or get within one goal. If the team with the lead gets control of the [[hockey puck|puck]] they will often shoot at the net after clearing center ice. It is less common for a team to shoot from their own zone at an empty net because [[icing (ice hockey)|icing]] could occur if the shooter misses the net. Sometimes a team will pull their goalie when they are on a [[power play (sport)|two-man advantage]], even if not nearing the end of the game. With the team then gaining an advantage of six skaters to three, this will increase even further the chances of the team scoring.
#In the case of a delayed [[penalty (ice hockey)|penalty]], the non-offending team will often pull their goaltender for an extra attacker in this situation as well.  Empty net goals that are scored in this case are accidental own goals because the whistle would be blown if the offending team touches the puck. An own goal is usually scored when a [[forward (ice hockey)|forward]] from the non-offending team passes backwards to a [[defenceman (ice hockey)|defenseman]] that is not in position, and the puck slides all the way down the ice into the team's own net, or when players of the non-offending team are being pressured in their own [[Ice hockey rink#Zones|zone]] and they accidentally knock it into the net.  This goal is credited to the last player on the scoring team who touched the puck.

==Goaltender's statistics==
Empty net goals are charged to the goaltender that was previously in net as '''empty net goals against''' (abbreviated as '''EN''', '''ENG''' or '''ENA'''). Empty net goals do not count against a goaltender's [[goals against average]] or their [[save percentage]], but rather are tracked separately. A goaltender can, however, be credited with a loss as the result of an empty net goal (for example, if a team is trailing by one point, pulls its goalie, concedes an empty net goal, but then scores another but does not score a tying goal before time expires; since no goaltender was on the ice for the game winning goal, the loss is pegged to the last goaltender on the ice). In an unusual case, goaltender [[Adam Wilcox (ice hockey)|Adam Wilcox]], in his [[List of players who played only one game in the NHL|lone NHL appearance]] to date, did not concede a goal but was credited with the loss because of the aforementioned scenario.&lt;ref&gt;https://puckprose.com/2018/04/07/buffalo-sabres-adam-wilcox-gets-loss-without-allowing-goal/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soccer==
An empty net [[Goal (sport)#Football .28soccer.29|goal]] can  occur in [[association football|soccer]] in a situation where a team is losing by a goal late in a game in which [[goal difference]] is not a relevant factor, such as in a [[single elimination|knockout]] cup competition. Often in these situations the [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] of the team that is losing will go into the attacking area if his team has a set play, such as a [[corner kick]]. In this case it is then possible for the defending team to score into the empty net if they are able to win possession of the ball.

Examples of this include [[Xabi Alonso]] scoring for [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] against [[Luton Town]] in the [[FA Cup]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5T_bZ9Jn1U Alonso's empty net goal against Luton Town]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ryan McCann]] scoring for [[Queen of the South F.C.|Queen of the South]] against [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]] in the [[Scottish Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_cups/7281745.stm Queen of the South 2-0 Dundee]&lt;/ref&gt;
==Handball==
With rule changes in the 2010s, the goalie can also be pulled in [[handball]]. Unlike the soccer and ice hockey examples, this is not only done in desperate situations near the end of a game, as scoring even on a goal with a goalkeeper in it is easier in handball than ice hockey or soccer. A loss of ball possession and the inability to quickly get a goalie back in time almost always results in empty net goal.

The A score measures the difficulty of each element (and combinations of elements) within the routine, while the B score evaluates the performance, ie, the "execution, composition and artistry" of the routine. For further information, please see the [[Code of Points (artistic gymnastics)|Code of Points]] article.&lt;/ref&gt; for all six apparatus were summed to give an all-around qualification score.

[[Image:Jeu de paume.jpg|thumb|240px|''Jeu de paume'' in the 17th century.]]
'''''Jeu de paume''''' ({{IPA-fr|ʒø d(ə) pom}}; {{lang-en|"palm game"}}) is a ball-and-court game that originated in [[France]]. It was an indoor precursor of [[tennis]] played without [[racquet]]s, though these were eventually introduced. It is a former [[Olympic sport]], and has the oldest ongoing annual world championship in sport, first established over 250 years ago.  Originally spelled '''''jeu de paulme''''', now it is called "'''[[real tennis]]'''" ,  '''''court tennis''''' (US) or '''''courte paume''''' (France).

==History==
[[File:Jeu de paume racquets and battoirs, 1772.jpg|left|thumb|Late 18th-century illustration of jeu de paume paddle-bats or ''battoirs'', and (in various stages of construction) strung racquets.]]
In the earliest versions of the game, the players hit the ball with their hands, as in [[palla]], [[volleyball]], or certain varieties of [[Basque pelota|pelota]]. ''Jeu de paume'', or ''jeu de paulme'' as it was formerly spelled,&lt;ref name="Diderot"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; literally means "palm game".  In time, gloves replaced bare hands.  Even when paddle-like bats, and finally racquets, became standard equipment for the game by the late 17th century, the name did not change.  It became known as "tennis" in English ''(see [[Tennis#History|History of tennis]])'', and later "[[real tennis]]" after the derived game of [[Tennis|lawn tennis]] became the more widely known sport.

The term is used in France today to denote the game of tennis on a court in which the ancient or modern game might be played. The indoor version is sometimes called ''jeu de courte paume'' or just ''courte paume'' ("short palm") to distinguish it from the outdoor version, ''[[longue paume]]'' ("long palm"), played on a field of variable length.

[[Jeu de paume at the 1908 Summer Olympics]] was a medal event; [[United States|American]] [[Jay Gould II]] won the Gold medal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/sports/JDP/mens-singles.html |title=Jeu De Paume Men's Singles Medalists |accessdate=19 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519154218/http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/sports/JDP/mens-singles.html |archivedate=19 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1740, jeu de paume has been the subject of an amateur world championship, held each year in September. It is the oldest active trophy in international sport.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

==Cultural references==
[[File:Jeu de paume, Fontainebleau (septembre 1991).JPG|right|thumb|A modernised court in the [[Palace of Fontainebleau]], Fontainebleau (1991).]]
The [[Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume]], a museum of contemporary art, is housed in a former court on the north side of the [[Tuileries]] park in the centre of [[Paris]].

The painter [[Jacques-Louis David]]'s famous sketch, ''le Serment du jeu de paume'' ('the [[Tennis Court Oath]]') now hangs in the court of the [[Palace of Versailles]]. It depicts a seminal moment of the [[French Revolution]], when, on 20 June 1789, deputies of the Estates-General met at the court and vowed that they would not disband before the proclamation of a formal Constitution for France.

''Le Jeu de Paume'' is a moral ode published in 1791 by [[André Chénier]].

In the 1981 film ''[[The French Lieutenant's Woman (film)|The French Lieutenant's Woman]]'', socialite Charles Smithson ([[Jeremy Irons]]) is seen playing ''jeu de paume'' in London.

The 2014 [[Whitney Biennial]] exhibition featured the premiere of the stop-motion film ''Jeu de Paume'' by [[Joshua Mosley]].

A member of the [[Sac and Fox Nation]], Thorpe became the first Native American to win a gold medal for the United States. Considered one of the most versatile athletes of modern sports, he won Olympic gold medals in the [[1912 Summer Olympics|1912]] [[pentathlon#Athletics pentathlons|pentathlon]] and [[decathlon]], and played [[American football]] (collegiate and professional), professional baseball, and basketball. He [[List of stripped Olympic medals|lost his Olympic titles]] after it was found he had been paid for playing two seasons of semi-professional baseball before competing in the Olympics, thus violating the [[Olympic Games#Amateurism and professionalism|amateurism]] rules that were then in place.  In 1983, 30 years after his death, the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) restored his Olympic medals.

[[File:Jim Thorpe 1912.jpg|thumb|Thorpe in 1912]]
Thorpe grew up in the Sac and Fox Nation in [[Oklahoma]], and attended [[Carlisle Indian Industrial School]] in [[Carlisle, Pennsylvania]], where he was a two-time [[All-America]]n for the [[Carlisle Indians football|school's football team]]. After his Olympic success in 1912, which included a record score in the decathlon, he added a victory in the All-Around Championship of the [[Amateur Athletic Union]]. In 1913, Thorpe signed with the [[San Francisco Giants|New York Giants]], and he played six seasons in [[Major League Baseball]] between 1913 and 1919. Thorpe joined the [[Canton Bulldogs]] American football team in 1915, helping them win three professional championships; he later played for six teams in the [[National Football League]] (NFL). He played as part of several all-American Indian teams throughout his career, and [[Barnstorm (athletics)|barnstormed]] as a professional basketball player with a team composed entirely of American Indians.

From 1920 to 1921, Thorpe was nominally the [[History of the NFL Commissioner#Jim Thorpe (1920)|first president]] of the [[American Professional Football Association]] (APFA), which became the NFL in 1922. He played professional sports until age&amp;nbsp;41, the end of his sports career coinciding with the start of the [[Great Depression]].  He struggled to earn a living after that, working several odd jobs. He suffered from [[alcoholism]], and lived his last years in failing health and poverty. He was married three times and had eight children, before suffering from heart failure and dying in 1953.

Thorpe has received various accolades for his athletic accomplishments. The [[Associated Press]] named him the "greatest athlete" from the first 50 years of the 20th century, and the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] inducted him as part of its inaugural class in 1963. A [[Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania town]] was named in his honor and a monument site there is the site of his remains, which were the subject of legal action. Thorpe appeared in several films and was portrayed by [[Burt Lancaster]] in the 1951 film ''[[Jim Thorpe – All-American]]''.

== Early life ==
Information about Thorpe's birth, name and ethnic background varies widely.&lt;ref name="County"&gt;O'Hanlon-Lincoln. pg. 129&lt;/ref&gt; He was baptized "Jacobus Franciscus Thorpe" in the [[Catholic Church]].  Thorpe was born in [[Indian Territory]] of the United States (later [[Oklahoma]]), but no [[birth certificate]] has been found.  He was generally considered to have been born on May 22, 1887,&lt;ref name="BD"/&gt; near the town of [[Prague, Oklahoma|Prague]], Oklahoma.&lt;ref name="NYTobit"/&gt; Thorpe himself said in a note to ''[[The Shawnee News-Star]]'' in 1943 that he was born May 28, 1888, "near and south of Bellemont – Pottawatomie County – along the banks of the North Fork River&amp;nbsp;... hope this will clear up the inquiries as to my birthplace."&lt;ref name="Wheeler291"&gt;Wheeler. pg. 291&lt;/ref&gt; However, most biographers believe that he was born on May 22, 1887, as that is what is listed on his baptismal certificate.  Bellemont was a small community, now disappeared, on the line between [[Pottawatomie County, Oklahoma|Pottawatomie]] and [[Lincoln County, Oklahoma|Lincoln]] Counties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~okpcgc/towns/bellemont.html|title=Bellemont: "Ghost" town of Pottawatomie County, Oklahoma|publisher=Rootsweb|accessdate=October 27, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026090416/http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~okpcgc/towns/bellemont.html|archivedate=October 26, 2011|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tnonline.com/2010/nov/22/author-jim-thorpes-biography-shakes-things|title=Author of Jim Thorpe's biography shakes things up|work=Times News Online|date=November 22, 2010|accessdate=May 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thorpe referred to [[Shawnee, Oklahoma|Shawnee]] as his birthplace in the 1943 note.&lt;ref name="Wheeler291"/&gt;

Thorpe's parents were both of mixed-race ancestry. His father, Hiram Thorpe, had an Irish father and a [[Sac and Fox Nation|Sac and Fox]] Indian mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/sport/other-sports/america-at-large-bizarre-coda-to-olympian-jim-thorpe-s-epic-life-1.2743918 |work=The Irish Times |title=America at Large: Bizarre coda to Olympian Jim Thorpe's epic life |date=August 3, 2016 |first=Dave |last=Hannigan |accessdate=June 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Irish and the Making of American Sport, 1835–1920 |first=Patrick R. |last=Redmond |publisher=McFarland and Company |location=Jefferson, North Carolina |year=2014  |page=279 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ATzTAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Irish+and+the+Making+of+American+Sport,+1835-1920#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Irish%20and%20the%20Making%20of%20American%20Sport%2C%201835-1920&amp;f=false |isbn=978-1-4766-0584-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, Charlotte Vieux, had a French father and a [[Potawatomi]] mother, a descendant of Chief [[Louis Vieux]].

Thorpe's parents were both Roman Catholic, a faith which Thorpe observed throughout his adult life.&lt;ref&gt;O'Hanlon-Lincoln. pg. 131&lt;/ref&gt;

Thorpe attended the Sac and Fox Indian Agency school in [[Stroud, Oklahoma]], with his twin brother, Charlie. Charlie helped him through school until he died of [[pneumonia]] when they were nine years old.&lt;ref name="cgm"&gt;[http://www.cmgww.com/sports/thorpe/facts/facts.html Jim Thorpe&amp;nbsp;– Fast facts], cgmworldwide.com.

In 1904 the sixteen-year-old Thorpe returned to his father and decided to attend [[Carlisle Indian Industrial School]] in [[Carlisle, Pennsylvania]]. There his athletic ability was recognized and he was coached by [[Pop Warner|Glenn Scobey "Pop" Warner]], one of the most influential coaches of early American football history.&lt;ref name="CNN"/&gt; Later that year he became orphaned after Hiram Thorpe died from [[gangrene]] poisoning after being wounded in a hunting accident,&lt;ref name="Hoxie"&gt;Hoxie. pg. 628&lt;/ref&gt; and Jim again dropped out of school.

[[Glenn Scobey Warner|Pop Warner]] was hesitant to allow Thorpe, his best track and field athlete, to compete in a physical game such as football.&lt;ref name="Warner"&gt;Jeansonne. pg. 60&lt;/ref&gt; Thorpe, however, convinced Warner to let him try some rushing plays in practice against the school team's defense; Warner assumed he would be tackled easily and give up the idea.&lt;ref name="Warner"/&gt; Thorpe "ran around past and through them not once, but twice".&lt;ref name="Warner"/&gt; He then walked over to Warner and said "Nobody is going to tackle Jim", while flipping him the ball.&lt;ref name="Warner"/&gt;

Thorpe gained nationwide attention for the first time in 1911.&lt;ref name="Redskin"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1912/04/28/archives/indian-thorpe-in-olympiad-redskin-from-carlisle-will-strive-for.html "Indian Thorpe in Olympiad: Redskin from Carlisle Will Strive for Place on American Team"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', April 28, 1912. Retrieved July 23, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[running back]], [[defensive back]], [[placekicker]] and [[punter (football position)|punter]], Thorpe scored all of his team's four field goals in an 18–15 upset of [[Harvard Crimson football|Harvard]], a top-ranked team in the early days of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association#History|National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA).&lt;ref name="Warner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NCAAHarvard"&gt;{{cite web|last=Richmond |first=Sam |url=https://www.ncaa.com/news/football/article/2015-11-11/jim-thorpe-leads-carlisle-upset-harvard-1911 |title=Jim Thorpe leads Carlisle to upset of Harvard in 1911 |accessdate=August 29, 2018 |publisher=National Collegiate Athletic Association |date=November 11, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His team finished the season 11–1. In 1912 Carlisle won the national collegiate championship largely as a result of his efforts – he scored 25 [[touchdown]]s and 198&amp;nbsp;points during the season, according to [[CNN]]'s Greg Botelho.&lt;ref name="CNN"/&gt; Steve Boda, a researcher for the NCAA, credits Thorpe with 27 touchdowns and 224 points.

Carlisle's 1912 record included a 27–6 victory over [[United States Military Academy|Army]].&lt;ref name="NYTobit"/&gt; In that game, Thorpe's 92-yard touchdown was nullified by a teammate's penalty, but on the next play Thorpe rushed for a 97-yard touchdown.&lt;ref name="usoc"&gt;[http://www.usoc.org/26_37888.htm Jim Thorpe], usoc.org, Retrieved April 26, 2007. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930201621/http://www.usoc.org/26_37888.htm |date=September 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Future President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], who played against him that season, recalled of Thorpe in a 1961 speech:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Here and there, there are some people who are supremely endowed. My memory goes back to Jim Thorpe. He never practiced in his life, and he could do anything better than any other football player I ever saw.&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;Botelho, Greg.

Football was – and would remain – Thorpe's favorite sport.&lt;ref&gt;O'Hanlon-Lincoln. pg. 144 &lt;br /&gt;* [http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/member.jsp?player_id=213 Jim Thorpe], profootballhalloffame.com.

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the spring of 1912, he started training for the Olympics. He had confined his efforts to jumps, hurdles and shot-puts, but now added pole vaulting, javelin, discus, hammer and 56&amp;nbsp;lb weight. In the Olympic trials held at Celtic Park in New York, his all-round ability stood out in all these events and so he earned a place on the team that went to Sweden.&lt;ref name="NYTobit"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Olympic career ===
[[File:Jim Thorpe, 1912 Summer Olympics.jpg|thumb|upright|Thorpe at the 1912 Summer Olympics]]
For the [[1912 Summer Olympics]] in Stockholm, Sweden, two new multi-event disciplines were included, the [[pentathlon]] and the [[decathlon]].&lt;ref name="Buford112"&gt;Buford. pg. 112&lt;/ref&gt; A pentathlon, based on the ancient Greek event, had been introduced at the [[1906 Intercalated Games]].&lt;ref&gt;Zarnowski (2013). pg. 150&lt;/ref&gt; The 1912 version consisted of the [[long jump]], [[javelin throw]], 200-meter dash, [[discus throw]] and 1500-meter run.&lt;ref name="Buford112"/&gt;

The decathlon was a relatively new event in modern athletics, although a similar competition known as the all-around championship had been part of American track meets since the 1880s and a [[Athletics at the 1904 Summer Olympics – Men's all-around|version]] had been featured on the program of the [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904 St.&amp;nbsp;Louis Olympics]]. The events of the new decathlon differed slightly from the American version.&lt;ref&gt;Zarnowski (2005). pgs. 29–30, 240&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Athletics at the 1904 St. Louis Summer Games: Men's All-Around Championship|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/1904/ATH/mens-all-around-championship.html|accessdate=January 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both seemed appropriate for Thorpe, who was so versatile that he served as Carlisle's one-man team in several track meets.&lt;ref name="NYTobit"/&gt; According to his obituary in ''[[The New York Times]]'', he could run the 100-yard dash in 10&amp;nbsp;seconds flat; the 220 in 21.8&amp;nbsp;seconds; the 440 in 51.8&amp;nbsp;seconds; the 880 in 1:57, the mile in 4:35; the 120-yard high hurdles in 15&amp;nbsp;seconds; and the 220-yard low hurdles in 24&amp;nbsp;seconds.&lt;ref name="NYTobit"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0528.html "Jim Thorpe Is Dead On West Coast at 64"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', March 29, 1953.

Thorpe entered the U.S.&amp;nbsp;Olympic trials for both the pentathlon and the decathlon. He easily earned a place on the pentathlon team, winning three events. The decathlon trial was subsequently cancelled, and Thorpe was chosen to represent the U.S. in the event.&lt;ref&gt;Buford. pg. 114&lt;/ref&gt; The pentathlon and decathlon teams also included future [[International Olympic Committee]] president [[Avery Brundage]].&lt;ref&gt;Findling and Pelle. pgs. 473–4&lt;/ref&gt;

His schedule in the Olympics was busy. Along with the decathlon and pentathlon, he competed in the long jump and high jump. The first competition was the pentathlon on July 7.&lt;ref name="sr"/&gt; He won four of the five events and placed third in the javelin,&lt;ref&gt;Buford. pgs. 127–8&lt;/ref&gt; an event he had not competed in before 1912.&lt;ref name="recognized"/&gt; Although the pentathlon was primarily decided on place points, points were also earned for the marks achieved in the individual events. He won the gold medal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Athletics at the 1912 Stockholm Summer Games: Men's Pentathlon|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/1912/ATH/mens-pentathlon.html|accessdate=June 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same day, he qualified for the high jump final in which he finished in a tie for fourth, and on July 12 he placed seventh in the long jump.&lt;ref name="sr"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Athletics at the 1912 Stockholm Summer Games: Men's High Jump Qualifying Round|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/1912/ATH/mens-high-jump-qualifying-round.html|accessdate=June 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thorpe's final event was the decathlon, his first (and as it turned out, his only) decathlon.&lt;ref name="sr"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jim Thorpe|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/th/jim-thorpe-1.html|accessdate=January 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jim Thorpe|publisher=National Track and Field Hall of Fame|url=https://www.usatf.org/HallOfFame/TF/showBio.asp?HOFIDs=170|accessdate=January 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strong competition from local favorite [[Hugo Wieslander]] was expected. Thorpe, however, defeated Wieslander by more than 700 points. He placed in the top four in all ten events, and his Olympic record of 8,413 points would stand for nearly two decades.&lt;ref name="bookrag"/&gt; Even more remarkably, because someone had stolen his shoes just before he was due to compete, he found a mismatched pair of replacements, including one from a rubbish bin, and won the gold medal wearing them.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Neely.

As was the custom of the day, the medals were presented to the athletes during the closing ceremonies of the games. Along with the two gold medals, Thorpe also received two challenge prizes, which were donated by King [[Gustav&amp;nbsp;V of Sweden]] for the decathlon and Czar [[Nicholas&amp;nbsp;II of Russia]] for the pentathlon. Several sources recount that, when awarding Thorpe his prize, King Gustav said, "You, sir, are the greatest athlete in the world", to which Thorpe replied, "Thanks, King".&lt;ref name="Flatter"&gt;Flatter, Ron. [http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/features/00016499.html "Thorpe preceded Deion, Bo"], [[ESPN.com]].

S. Barnes, 1952) pg. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thorpe's successes had not gone unnoticed at home, and on his return he was the star attraction in a [[ticker-tape parade]] on [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]].&lt;ref name="Flatter"/&gt; He remembered later, "I heard people yelling my name, and I couldn't realize how one fellow could have so many friends."&lt;ref name="Flatter"/&gt;

Apart from his track and field appearances, he also played in one of two exhibition [[Baseball at the 1912 Summer Olympics|baseball games at the 1912&amp;nbsp;Olympics]], which featured two teams composed mostly of U.S.&amp;nbsp;track and field athletes.&lt;ref&gt;Cava. pgs. 8–9&lt;/ref&gt; Thorpe had previous experience in the sport, as the public would soon learn.&lt;ref&gt;Buford. pgs. 158–61&lt;/ref&gt;

=== All-Around champion ===
After his victories at the Olympic Games in Sweden, on September 2, 1912, he returned to Celtic Park, the home of the [[Irish American Athletic Club]], in [[Queens]], New York (where he had qualified four months earlier for the Olympic Games), to compete in the [[Amateur Athletic Union]]'s All-Around Championship. Competing against [[Bruno Brodd]] of the [[Irish American Athletic Club]] and [[John L. Bredemus]] of [[Princeton University]], he won seven of the ten events contested and came in second in the remaining three. With a total point score of 7,476&amp;nbsp;points, Thorpe broke the previous record of 7,385&amp;nbsp;points set in 1909, (also set at Celtic Park), by [[Martin Sheridan]], the champion athlete of the Irish American Athletic Club.&lt;ref&gt;"Indian Thorpe is Best Athlete&amp;nbsp;– Olympic Champion Wins All-Around Championship and Breaks Record". ''The New York Times'', September 3, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/albert-lea-evening-tribune-aug-29-1912-p-6/|title=Hopes to Set New Record|date=August 29, 1912|page=6|work=Albert Lea Evening Tribune|accessdate=September 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheridan, a five-time Olympic gold medalist, was present to watch his record broken, approached Thorpe after the event and shook his hand saying, "Jim, my boy, you're a great man. I never expect to look upon a finer athlete."  He told a reporter from ''[[New York World]]'', "Thorpe is the greatest athlete that ever lived. He has me beaten fifty ways. Even when I was in my prime, I could not do what he did today."&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler. pg. 118&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Controversy ===
In 1912, [[Olympic Games#Amateurism and professionalism|strict rules]] regarding [[Amateur sports|amateurism]] were in effect for athletes participating in the Olympics. Athletes who received money prizes for competitions, were sports teachers or had competed previously against professionals were not considered amateurs and were barred from competition.&lt;ref&gt;Buford. pg. 121&lt;/ref&gt;

In late January 1913, the ''[[Worcester Telegram]]'' published a story announcing that Thorpe had played professional baseball, and other U.S.&amp;nbsp;newspapers followed up the story.&lt;ref name="Flatter"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;""Jim" Thorpe Admits He Is Professional, and Retires from Athletics", ''[[The Washington Post]]'', January 28, 1913, pg. 8. "Charges that Thorpe had played professional baseball in Winston Salem, N.C. were first published in a Worcester (Mass.) newspaper last week."&lt;/ref&gt; Thorpe had indeed played professional baseball in the [[Eastern Carolina League]] for [[Rocky Mount, North Carolina]], in 1909 and 1910, receiving meager pay; reportedly as little as US$2 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|2|1910|r=0}}}} today) per game and as much as US$35 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|35|1910|r=0}}}} today) per week.&lt;ref name="Anderson"/&gt; College players, in fact, regularly spent summers playing professionally but most used aliases, unlike Thorpe.&lt;ref name="CNN"/&gt;

Although the public did not seem to care much about Thorpe's past,&lt;ref name="Schaff"&gt;Schaffer and Smith. pg. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Amateur Athletic Union]] (AAU), and especially its secretary [[James Edward Sullivan]], took the case very seriously.&lt;ref&gt;Schaffer and Smith. pg. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Thorpe wrote a letter to Sullivan, in which he admitted playing professional baseball:&lt;ref name="Flatter"/&gt;

{{quote|I hope I will be partly excused by the fact that I was simply an Indian schoolboy and did not know all about such things. In fact, I did not know that I was doing wrong, because I was doing what I knew several other college men had done, except that they did not use their own names&amp;nbsp;...}}

His letter did not help.&lt;ref&gt;Buford. pg. 161&lt;/ref&gt; The AAU decided to withdraw Thorpe's amateur status retroactively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Campagna|first=Jeff|title=Wishing Jim Thorpe a Happy Birthday|magazine=Smithsonian|date=May 28, 2010|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/wishing-jim-thorpe-a-happy-birthday-133250524/|accessdate=May 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) unanimously decided to [[List of stripped Olympic medals|strip]] Thorpe of his Olympic titles, medals and awards and declare him a professional.&lt;ref&gt;Buford. pg. 167&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Thomas|first=Louisa|title=Doping and an Olympic Crisis of Idealism|magazine=The New Yorker|date=July 29, 2016|url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/doping-and-an-olympic-crisis-of-idealism|accessdate=May 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Quirk. pg. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Thorpe had played for money, the AAU and IOC did not follow the rules for disqualification. The rulebook for the 1912&amp;nbsp;Olympics stated that protests had to be made "within" 30&amp;nbsp;days from the closing ceremonies of the games.&lt;ref name="usoc"/&gt; The first newspaper reports did not appear until January 1913, about six months after the Stockholm Games had concluded.&lt;ref name="usoc"/&gt; There is also some evidence that Thorpe was known to have played professional baseball before the Olympics, but the AAU had ignored the issue until being confronted with it in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;Buford. pg. 162&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dyreson. pg. 171&lt;/ref&gt;  The only positive element of this affair for Thorpe was that, as soon as the news was reported that he had been declared a professional, he received offers from professional sports clubs.&lt;ref&gt;Rogge, Johnson, and Rendell. pg. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the minor league team that last held Jim Thorpe's contract had disbanded in 1910, he found himself in the rare position of being a sought-after [[free agent]] at the major league level during the era of the [[reserve clause]], and thus had a choice of baseball teams for which to play.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1913/02/01/archives/thorpe-is-to-play-ball-with-giants-famous-indian-athlete-accepts.html "Thorpe is to Play Ball with Giants; Famous Indian Athlete Accepts McGraw's Terms Over the Telephone"], ''The New York Times'', February 1, 1913.

But Thorpe had not abandoned football either. He first played professional football in 1913 as a member of the Indiana-based [[Pine Village, Indiana#Football|Pine Village Pros]], a team that had a several-season winning streak against local teams during the 1910s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/history/chronology/1911-1920|title=NFL History by Decade, 1911–1920|publisher=[[National Football League]]|accessdate=September 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then signed with the [[Canton Bulldogs]] in 1915.

== Marriage and family ==

Thorpe married three times and had eight children (one of whom died in childhood).
In 1913, Thorpe married Iva M. Miller,&lt;ref name="NYTobit"/&gt; whom he had met at Carlisle. In 1917, Iva and Thorpe bought a house now known as the [[Jim Thorpe House]] in [[Yale, Oklahoma]], and lived there until 1923.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory – Nomination Form|publisher=National Park Service|url={{NRHP url|id=71000673}}|format=PDF|accessdate=December 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had four children: Gail, James F., Charlotte, and Frances.&lt;ref name="NYTobit"/&gt; Miller filed for divorce from Thorpe in 1925, claiming desertion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,720180,00.html List of marriages, divorces, births, and deaths], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', April 6, 1925, available online via time.com.

== Later life, film career, and death ==
[[File:JimThorpeGoudeycard.jpg|thumb|right|upright|1933 [[Goudey]] Sport Kings card]]
After his athletic career, Thorpe struggled to provide for his family. He found it difficult to work a non-sports-related job and never held a job for an extended period of time. During the [[Great Depression]] in particular, he had various jobs, among others as an [[extra (drama)|extra]] for several movies, usually playing an American Indian chief in [[Western movie|Westerns]].&lt;ref name="ohanlon1445"/&gt;&lt;ref name="time1943"/&gt; In the 1932 comedy ''Always Kickin{{'}}'', Thorpe was prominently cast in a speaking part as himself, a kicking coach teaching young football players to [[drop-kick]]. In 1931, during the Great Depression, he sold the film rights to his life story to [[MGM]] for $1,500 (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|1500|1931|r=-3}}}} today).{{inflation-fn|US}}&lt;ref&gt;O'Hanlon-Lincoln. pg. 145&lt;/ref&gt; Thorpe portrayed an umpire in the 1940 film ''[[Knute Rockne, All American]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Buford. pgs. 313–4&lt;/ref&gt; He played a member of the Navajo Nation in the 1950 film ''[[Wagon Master]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Hilger. pg. 324&lt;/ref&gt;

Thorpe was memorialized in the [[Warner Bros.]] film ''[[Jim Thorpe – All-American]]'' (1951) starring [[Burt Lancaster]], with [[Billy Gray (actor)|Billy Gray]] performing as Thorpe as a child. The film was directed by [[Michael Curtiz]]. Although there were rumors that Thorpe received no money, he was paid $15,000 by Warner Bros. plus a $2,500 donation toward an annuity for him by the studio head of publicity.&lt;ref&gt;Kate Buford, ''Native American Son, The Life and Sporting Legend of Jim Thorpe'', Alfred A.

Apart from his career in films, he also worked as a construction worker, a [[bouncer (doorman)|doorman (bouncer)]], a security guard and a ditch digger, and briefly joined the [[United States Merchant Marine]] in 1945.&lt;ref name="ohanlon1445"&gt;O'Hanlon-Lincoln. pgs. 144–5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="time1943"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,774347,00.html Briefs], ''Time'', February 22, 1943, available online via time.com.

In early 1953, Thorpe went into [[heart failure]] for the third time while dining with Patricia in their home in [[Lomita, California]]. He was briefly revived by [[artificial respiration]] and spoke to those around him, but lost consciousness shortly afterward and died on March 28 at the age of 65.&lt;ref name="NYTobit"/&gt;

== Victim of racism ==
Thorpe, whose parents were both half Caucasian, was raised as an American Indian. His accomplishments occurred during a period of severe racial inequality in the United States. It has often been suggested that his medals were stripped because of his ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;Watterson. pg. 151&lt;br /&gt;* Elfers. pg. 18&lt;/ref&gt; While it is difficult to prove this, the public comment at the time largely reflected this view.&lt;ref&gt;Schaffer and Smith. pg. 50&lt;/ref&gt; At the time Thorpe won his gold medals, not all Native Americans were recognized as U.S.&amp;nbsp;citizens. (The U.S.&amp;nbsp;government had wanted them to make concessions to adopt European-American ways to receive such recognition.) Citizenship was not granted to all American Indians until 1924.&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln and Slagle. pg. 282&lt;/ref&gt;

While Thorpe attended Carlisle, students' ethnicity was used for marketing purposes.&lt;ref name="Bloom"/&gt; The football team was called the Indians. A photograph of Thorpe and the 1911 football team emphasized racial differences among the competing athletes; the inscription on the most important game ball of that season reads, "1911, Indians&amp;nbsp;18, Harvard&amp;nbsp;15."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.historicalsociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Jim_Thorpe_Photo_Collection.pdf Jim Thorpe Photo Collection] &lt;small&gt;(PDF)&lt;/small&gt;, historicalsociety.com. Retrieved May 20, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the school and journalists often categorized sporting competitions as conflicts of Indians against whites; newspaper headlines such as "Indians Scalp Army 27–6" or "Jim Thorpe on Rampage" made stereotypical journalistic play of the Indian background of Carlisle's football team.&lt;ref name="Bloom"&gt;Bloom quoted in Bird. pg. 97&lt;/ref&gt; The first notice of Thorpe in ''The New York Times'' was headlined "Indian Thorpe in Olympiad; Redskin from Carlisle Will Strive for Place on American Team."&lt;ref name="Redskin"/&gt; His accomplishments were described in a similar racial context by other newspapers and sportswriters throughout his life.&lt;ref&gt;Demaree, Al.

"'''Ka Mate'''" is a [[Māori people|Māori]] [[haka]] composed by [[Te Rauparaha]], war leader of the [[Ngāti Toa]] tribe of the [[North Island]] of [[New Zealand]].

==Composition==
Te Rauparaha composed "Ka Mate" circa 1820 as a celebration of life over death after his lucky escape from pursuing [[Ngāti Maniapoto]] and [[Tainui|Waikato]] enemies.&lt;ref name="Pomare"&gt;{{cite web| last = Pōmare | first = Mīria | url = http://www.teara.govt.nz/NewZealanders/MaoriNewZealanders/NgatiToarangatira/4/ENZ-Resources/Standard/2/en | title = Ngāti Toarangatira – Chant composed by Te Rauparaha | work = Te Ara – the Encyclopedia of New Zealand | publisher = Ministry for Culture &amp; Heritage | date = 12 February 2014 | accessdate = 31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Guidelines&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ngatitoa.iwi.nz/wp-content/uploads/PhotoGallery/2010/09/Haka-Ka-Mate-Guidelines_Final2.pdf | format = pdf | title = Haka Ka Mate Attribution Act 2014 Guidelines | publisher = Ministry of Business, Innovation &amp; Employment | accessdate = 31 August 2015 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160123115113/http://www.ngatitoa.iwi.nz/wp-content/uploads/PhotoGallery/2010/09/Haka-Ka-Mate-Guidelines_Final2.pdf | archivedate = 23 January 2016 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He had hidden from them in a food-storage pit, and climbed back into the light to be met by a chief friendly to him – Te Whareangi (the "hairy man").

The haka as composed by Te Rauparaha begins with a chant:&lt;ref name="Pomare"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guidelines/&gt;
{{Verse translation|lang=mi|
Kikiki! Kakaka!
Kauana kei waniwania taku tara
kei tarawahia, kei te rua i te kerokero!
He pounga rahui te uira
ka rarapa ketekete kau ana
To peru kairiri mau au e koro e!
Hi! Ha! - Ka wehi au ka matakana,
ko wai te tangata kia rere ure tirohanga
ngā rua rerarera
ngā rua kuri kakanui i raro! Aha ha!
|
Let your valor rise! Let your valor rage!
We’ll ward off these haunting hands
while protecting our wives and children!
For thee, I defy
the lightning bolts of hell
while my enemies stand there in confusion!
O God – to think I would tremble
to a pack of wolves seeing fear, or running away,
because they would surely fall in the pit of shame
as food for the hounds who chow down in delight! Oh, what in the name…?}}

Then follows the main body of the haka:
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|mi|Ka mate, ka mate! ka ora! ka ora!
Ka mate! ka mate! ka ora! ka ora!
Tēnei te tangata pūhuruhuru
Nāna nei i tiki mai whakawhiti te rā
Ā, upane! ka upane!
Ā, upane, ka upane, whiti te ra!}}
|
'Tis death! 'tis death! ''(or: I may die)'' ’Tis life! ‘tis life! ''(or: I may live)''
’Tis death! ‘tis death! ’Tis life! ‘tis life!
This is the hairy man
Who summons the sun and makes it shine
A step upward, another step upward!
A step upward, another... the Sun shines!}}

"Ka Mate" was conceived as a brief energizing haka of the [[Haka#Origins|''ngeri'']] type, where, in the absence of set movements, the performers are free to [[Extemporization (music)|extemporize]] their chanting and [[Dance improvisation|movement]] as they feel fit, without any need for synchronization.&lt;ref name="Jackson2002"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jackson |first1=SJ |last2=Hokowhitu |first2=B |title=Sport, Tribes, and Technology: The New Zealand All Blacks Haka and the Politics of Identity |journal=Journal of Sport and Social Issues |date=2002 |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=125–139 |doi=10.1177/0193723502262002 |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0193723502262002 |language=en |issn=0193-7235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:ADAM BLAIR AND ISSAC LUKE.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Isaac Luke]] and [[Adam Blair]] of the [[New Zealand national rugby league team]] performing "Ka Mate"]]
"Ka Mate" is the most widely known haka in New Zealand and internationally because a choreographed and synchronized version&lt;ref name="Jackson2002"/&gt; of the chant has traditionally been performed by the [[All Blacks]], New Zealand's international [[rugby union]] team, as well as the [[New Zealand Kiwis|Kiwis]], New Zealand's international [[rugby league]] team, immediately prior to test (international) matches. Since 2005 the All Blacks have occasionally performed another haka, "[[Kapa o Pango]]". Since the introduction of "Kapa o Pango" the longest sequence of "Ka Mate" performances by the All Blacks is nine, which occurred between 22 August 2009 and 12 June 2010.

==Ownership==
{{further information|Indigenous intellectual property#Ka Mate haka}}
Between 1998 and 2006, [[Ngati Toa]] attempted to trademark "Ka Mate" to prevent its use by commercial organisations without their permission.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/793975.stm 
|title=All Blacks fight to keep haka |publisher=''[[BBC News|news.bbc.co.uk]]'' |date=16 July 2000 |accessdate=3 May 2008}}

|title= Iwi threatens to place trademark on All Black haka|publisher=''[[New Zealand Herald]]'' |date=22 May 2005 |accessdate=3 May 2008}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 the [[Intellectual Property Office of New Zealand]] declined their claim on the grounds that "Ka Mate" had achieved wide recognition in New Zealand and abroad as representing New Zealand as a whole and not a particular trader. In March 2011 The NZ Rugby Union came to an amicable agreement with the iwi not to bring the [[mana]] of the haka into disrepute.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10389347 |title=Iwi claim to All Black haka turned down|publisher=''[[New Zealand Herald]]'' |date=2 July 2007 |accessdate=3 May 2008}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, as a part of a wider settlement of grievances, the [[New Zealand government]] agreed to:
:"...record the authorship and significance of the haka Ka Mate to Ngāti Toa and ... work with Ngāti Toa to address their concerns with the haka... [but] does not expect that redress will result in royalties for the use of Ka Mate or provide Ngāti Toa with a veto on the performance of Ka Mate...".&lt;ref&gt;[http://nz01.terabyte.co.nz/ots/livearticle.asp?ArtID=1234231829 Ngāti Toa Rangatira Letter of Agreement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100521222630/http://nz01.terabyte.co.nz/ots/LiveArticle.asp?ArtID=1234231829 |date=21 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7882775.stm | work=BBC News | title=New Zealand Maori win haka fight | date=11 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44088">The '''members of the National Lacrosse Hall of Fame''' are inducted by [[US Lacrosse]] and are enshrined at the [[Lacrosse National Hall of Fame and Museum|National Lacrosse Hall of Fame]]. Members have been inducted into the [[hall of fame]] annually since 1957.&lt;ref name="hof"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hall of Fame|url=https://www.uslacrosse.org/about-us-lacrosse/hall-of-fame|publisher=US Lacrosse|accessdate=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Lacrosse Hall of Fame and Museum moved to US Lacrosse's new headquarters in Sparks, Maryland in 2016.

Individuals are nominated in four distinct categories: players, coaches, and contributors. Contributors can be either officials and umpires or administrators and developers. The annual number of inductees is limited to four male and four female honorees. Each year, the nominating and voting process takes place from January through April. The annual class of inductees is publicly announced over [[Memorial Day]] weekend in May, in conjunction with the [[NCAA Men's Lacrosse Championship|NCAA Men's Championships]] held the same weekend. They are then officially inducted at a ceremony in September or October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nomination &amp; Selection Process|url=https://www.uslacrosse.org/sites/default/files/public/documents/about-us-lacrosse/HOF-selection-process_2014.pdf|publisher=US Lacrosse|accessdate=8 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, [[Rosabelle Sinclair]], a pioneer of the [[women's lacrosse|women's game]], was the first woman to be inducted into the Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apps.uslacrosse.org/museum/halloffame/view_profile.php?prof_id=189 |title=Rosabelle Sinclair Hall of Fame Biography |publisher=US Lacrosse |archivedate=March 3, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303180553/http://apps.uslacrosse.org/museum/halloffame/view_profile.php?prof_id=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Sinclair, there have been 76 other woman inductees, and, combined with 287 men, there are 364 total inductees as of the 2010 class.

The '''Marine Life Protection Act''' (MLPA)  was passed in 1999 and is part of the California Fish and Game Code. The MLPA requires California to reevaluate all existing marine protected areas (MPAs) and potentially design new MPAs that together function as a statewide network. The MLPA has clear guidance associated with the development of this MPA network. MPAs are developed on a regional basis with MLPA and MPA-specific goals in mind and are evaluated over time to assess their effectiveness in meeting these goals. The overall goals of the Marine Life Protection Act are to maintain the diversity of marine ecosystems, conserve its populations, better educate people on human-marine life interactions, protect habitats, and effectively enforce MPAs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2012.08.015 |title=California's Marine Life Protection Act Initiative: Supporting implementation of legislation establishing a statewide network of marine protected areas |journal=Ocean &amp; Coastal Management |volume=74 |pages=3–13 |year=2013 |last1=Kirlin |first1=John |last2=Caldwell |first2=Meg |last3=Gleason |first3=Mary |last4=Weber |first4=Mike |last5=Ugoretz |first5=John |last6=Fox |first6=Evan |last7=Miller-Henson |first7=Melissa }}&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment of this policy is an important step in expanding science-based management and decision making regarding policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Carr |first1=Mark H. |first2=Emily |last2=Saarman |first3=Margaret R. |last3=Caldwell |title=The role of 'rules of thumb' in science-based environmental policy: California's Marine Life Protection Act as a case study |journal=Stanford Journal of Law, Science and Policy |volume=2 |year=2010 |pages=1–17 |url=http://web.stanford.edu/group/sjlsp/cgi-bin/orange_web/users_images/pdfs/61_Carr%20Final.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Unlike terrestrial conservation, [[marine conservation]] often lacks a systematic approach to conserving biodiversity.&lt;ref name="Gleason"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1890/1540-9295(=2006 |volume=4 |issue=5 |pages=249–58 |title=Assessing gaps in marine conservation in California |journal=Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment |last1=Gleason |first1=Mary G. |last2=Merrifield |first2=Matt S. |last3=Cook |first3=Chuck |last4=Davenport |first4=Audrey L. |last5=Shaw |first5=Rebecca }}&lt;/ref&gt; Little [[gap analysis]] has been performed on the marine environment, and there is a lack of knowledge into what is protected, what needs to be protected, and where the protection needs to occur.&lt;ref name="Gleason"/&gt;  Over the last century there has been a rapid increase in the loss of marine [[biodiversity]] and habitat degradation. About 70%-80% of California's population lives within one hour of the coast and the ocean provides resources to local, state, and national interests. As a result, species and habitat loss have become a major issue. Over 90% of California's coastal wetlands have been lost, coastal waters have become contaminated with a variety of urban and agricultural toxins, and a large number of targeted species have declined in the last 10–20 years.&lt;ref name="Gleason"/&gt; Over the last two decades, California fish catches have decreased by over 50%.&lt;ref name="Avasthi"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.308.5721.487 |pmid=15845821 |title=ECOSYSTEM MANAGEMENT: California Tries to Connect Its Scattered Marine Reserves |journal=Science |volume=308 |issue=5721 |pages=487–8 |year=2005 |last1=Avasthi |first1=A. }}&lt;/ref&gt; These impacts have decreased the health and value of the California's coastal ocean and imply a need for a more systematic approach to marine conservation.&lt;ref name="Gleason"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Avasthi"/&gt; Although there is no single solution to conserving the marine environment, MPAs are a potentially valuable tool for marine conservation when designed and managed effectively. A well designed and managed network of MPAs helps to prevent degradation, fosters marine biodiversity, and may maintain a more [[sustainable fishing]] industry.&lt;ref name="Avasthi"/&gt; The MLPA helps to promote a shift from single-species management to an [[ecosystem-based management]] and is a more systematic approach to marine conservation.

==A Brief History of California MPAs==
{{See also|List of California Department of Fish and Game protected areas}}
California's first six MPAs were created between 1909 and 1913; by 1950 all had been removed. After 1950 more than 50 other MPAs were created along the California coast. But these MPAs were established in a random manner and without regard to regional conservation goals.&lt;ref name="CDFG"&gt;CDFG. 2004. Marine Life Protection Act: sections 2850-2863. Sacramento, CA: California Department of Fish and Game, Marine Region.&lt;/ref&gt; Most have been thought to be too small and ineffective in protecting against habitat and species loss.&lt;ref name="Gleason"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Avasthi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CDFG"/&gt; With these existing MPAs less than 1% of coastal waters were protected, and none extended to deeper waters.&lt;ref name="Gleason"/&gt; In 1999 the MLPA was created in order to re-evaluate the current MPA system and to establish a better network of MPAs that would be more effective in protecting against habitat and species loss.

Prior to the enforcement of the Marine Life Protection Act, very few of California's coastal areas were protected within MPAs. There needed to be a system established that would improve the marine systems protection in California and help regulate building in marine areas and researchers' plans to alter any of these areas. Although the original plans for MPAs did attempt to follow the guidelines of science and practicality, at first they were not satisfactory for stakeholders who managed the area. Eventually, the plan that was approved increased the number of habitats that were protected by MPAs. The establishment of these created benefits for fisheries management too, though this was not the main focus of the plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2012.08.013 |title=Designing a network of marine protected areas in California: Achievements, costs, lessons learned, and challenges ahead |journal=Ocean &amp; Coastal Management |volume=74 |pages=90–101 |year=2013 |last1=Gleason |first1=Mary |last2=Fox |first2=Evan |last3=Ashcraft |first3=Susan |last4=Vasques |first4=Jason |last5=Whiteman |first5=Elizabeth |last6=Serpa |first6=Paulo |last7=Saarman |first7=Emily |last8=Caldwell |first8=Meg |last9=Frimodig |first9=Adam |last10=Miller-Henson |first10=Melissa |last11=Kirlin |first11=John |last12=Ota |first12=Becky |last13=Pope |first13=Elizabeth |last14=Weber |first14=Mike |last15=Wiseman |first15=Ken }}&lt;/ref&gt; Creating these MPAs increased the abundance, size, and diversity of fish, invertebrate, and algae. The success of this plan inspired the creation of similar policies around the world. The Marine Life Protection Act caused science to play a larger role in California environmental planning than ever before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2012.08.021 |title=The role of science in supporting marine protected area network planning and design in California |journal=Ocean &amp; Coastal Management |volume=74 |pages=45–56 |year=2013 |last1=Saarman |first1=Emily |last2=Gleason |first2=Mary |last3=Ugoretz |first3=John |last4=Airamé |first4=Satie |last5=Carr |first5=Mark |last6=Fox |first6=Evan |last7=Frimodig |first7=Adam |last8=Mason |first8=Tom |last9=Vasques |first9=Jason }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Marine Life Protection Act==

===MLPA Findings===
The MLPA found that existing MPAs were not created under a coherent plan or scientific guidelines and that there is a need to redesign the MPA system. Coastal development, water pollution, and other human activities are a threat to California's diverse coastal waters. These coastal waters, along with the ecosystems and species which thrive within them are vital assets to the state and nation. An improved MPA system would help protect against habitat and ecosystem loss, conserve biological diversity, provide safe breeding grounds for fish and other marine species, improve research opportunities, create a reference point from which the rest of the ocean can be compared against, and may help to re-grow depleted fisheries.&lt;ref name="CDFG"/&gt;

===MPA Network===
The MLPA appointed the [[California Department of Fish and Game]] (CDFG) with the task of developing and managing a network of MPAs. The CDFG determines the final location and size of each MPA. The goal is to establish a network of MPAs that work together. This network takes into account the movement of adult and larval fish and also focuses on deepwater habitats for the first time.&lt;ref name="Avasthi"/&gt; A proportion of the MPA network is to be designated as no-take zones. No-take zones allow for a large area of safe breeding grounds and a sanctuary for large, female fish. Large female fish produce more viable offspring and are vital in a population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/430621a |pmid=15295581 |title=Fisheries science:  Why mothers matter |journal=Nature |volume=430 |issue=7000 |pages=621–2 |year=2004 |last=Palumbi |first=Stephen R. |authorlink=Stephen Palumbi |bibcode=2004Natur.430..621P }}&lt;/ref&gt; With this idea, the MPA network has the potential to boost fish populations in areas outside of MPAs. Fishery growth has been successful along the [[Great Barrier Reef Marine Park]] and the [[Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary]] after reserves were established in these areas.&lt;ref name="Avasthi"/&gt; The final decision of the size and location of the MPAs depends on the species and habitats affected, stakeholder and conservation goals, and how each individual MPA will function on its own and as part of the network.

===MLPA Implementation===
After its passage in 1999, the CDFG began to implement the MLPA. The first attempt involved a Master Plan Team which included primarily scientific experts and governmental agencies, with little input from local [[Stakeholder analysis|stakeholders]].&lt;ref name="Weible"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1541-0072.2004.00060.x |title=A Comparison of a Collaborative and Top-Down Approach to the Use of Science in Policy: Establishing Marine Protected Areas in California |journal=Policy Studies Journal |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=187–207 |year=2004 |last1=Weible |first1=Christopher |last2=Sabatier |first2=Paul A. |last3=Lubell |first3=Mark }}&lt;/ref&gt; This plan failed once it was brought to the public for approval, mostly because stakeholders and other members of the public were excluded from the process. Commercial and recreational fishers showed the most resistance, stating that MPAs produce no benefits for fisheries and objecting to the size and location of the proposed MPAs.&lt;ref name="Avasthi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weible"/&gt; In 2002, the CDFG implemented the MLPA for a second time. This plan involved members from the Master Plan Team, as well as seven Working Stakeholder Groups, which included governmental agency officials, recreational and commercial fishing interests, recreational divers, ocean vessel representatives, environmental interests, charter boat operators, harbormasters, and scientists/educators.&lt;ref name="Weible"/&gt; This attempt was more successful and gained public support, but the project lost funding in 2003 due to a poor fiscal year.

In 2004 the CDFG gained new funding from several organizations to initiate the Marine Life Protection Act Initiative. The Initiative divided the coast into sequential regions and assembled a Blue Ribbon Task Force on Marine Protected Areas, Science Advisory Team, and Regional Stakeholder Group to develop and evaluate the first set of MPAs in the Central Coast region.&lt;ref name="Avasthi"/&gt; On April 13, 2007, after nearly three years of public meetings and proposal reviews, the Fish and Game Commission evaluated and voted on a final MPA proposal for the Central California coast. The commission voted on a plan to establish 29 MPAs covering approximately 204 square miles (18%) of state waters with 85 square miles (8%) designated as no-take state marine reserves.&lt;ref name="CDFG 2007"&gt;CDFG. 2007. Marine Life Protection Act initiative: commission gives final approval for Central Coast marine protected areas. [http://www.dfg.ca.gov/MRD/mlpa/ccmpas.html]. Viewed 22 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The network ranges from Pigeon Point in San Mateo County south to Point Conception in Santa Barbara Coun and contains several types of MPAs with varying degrees of protection.

The Central Coast plan has received high marks for scientific effectiveness.  Local stakeholders developed a balanced network that protects the region's best habitat, including parts of the Big Sur Coast and Monterey Bay while allowing continued access to most recreational and commercial fishing grounds. California's Central Coast MPAs went into effect in September 2007 and scientific baseline data has been collected over the last two years.&lt;ref name="CDFG 2007"/&gt;

The Central Coast was the first to be designated, first to be violated and first to be successfully prosecuted. The SMR in [[Morro Bay State Marine Recreational Management Area and Morro Bay State Marine Reserve]] is the recipient of two creeks that drain 75 square miles of the watershed, known as the [[Estero Bay (California)|Estero Bay]] Hydrologic Unit. One of these creeks (Chorro) hosts effluent from a habitual polluter upstream, the CMC ([[California Men's Colony]] State Prison). The SMR took effect in Sept 2007, and in Jan 2008, the CMC spilled sewage into Chorro Creek, which meandered into the State Marine Reserve portion of the Morro Bay Estuary. Working together, coastal activist Joey Racano, then-Gov Arnold Schwarzenegger and the Central Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board together successfully prosecuted the SMR violation by getting the ACL (Administrative Civil Liability) to reflect the violation was more than just another spill, but was a spill into an MPA (Marine Protected Area) into a no-take SMR. This set the precedent for all future violators, and for upstream violators (or violations from outside the SMR boundaries) as well as a precedent set for too much chlorine in the discharge. Due to the MPA violation, the CCRWQCB staff ordered the CMC to receive a higher fine than the original ACL had specified.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The North Central Coast plan, adopted by the Fish and Game Commission on August 5, 2009, also represented a compromise between different interest groups and protected iconic sites like the Farallon Islands, Point Reyes Headlands, and Bodega Head while leaving nearly 90 percent of coastal waters open for fishing.  Regulations for the North Central Coast MPAs, which extend from Alder Creek, near Pt. Arena in Mendocino County, to Pigeon Point in San Mateo County, went into effect on May 1, 2010. The regulations established 21 marine protected areas (MPAs), three State Marine Recreational Management Areas, and six special closures, in total covering approximately 153 square miles (20.1%) of state waters in the north central coast study region. Approximately 86 square miles (11%) of the {{convert|153|sqmi|km2}} are designated as "no take" state marine reserves, while different take allowances providing varying levels of protection are designated for the rest.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

In 2008, South Coast Regional Stakeholders began a public planning process to design the part of the statewide MPA network that spans from Pt. Conception in Santa Barbara county to the U.S. border with Mexico. On Dec. 15, 2010, the CA Fish and Game Commission adopted regulations to create 36 new MPAs encompassing approximately 187 square miles (8 percent) of state waters in the study region. Approximately 116 square miles (4.9 percent) have been designated as no-take state marine reserves (82.5 square miles/3.5 percent) and no-take state marine conservation areas (33.5 square miles/1.4 percent), with the remainder designated as state marine conservation areas with different take allowances and varying levels of protection. Implementation of the new South Coast MPAs took place on January 1, 2012.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The North Coast region, which stretches from Point Arena to the Oregon border, concluded the stakeholder planning process in August 2010.  Stakeholders developed a unified proposal for their regional MPA network supported by fishermen, conservationists, and tribal representatives.  The unified plan was adopted by the Fish and Game Commission on June 6, 2012; and will be implemented in 2013.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===The Science===
An extensive body of peer-reviewed studies on marine protected areas have concluded that well-designed networks of protected waters are effective in improving ocean health and making ocean waters more resilient.&lt;ref name="Halpern"&gt;Halpern, Benjamin S. et al. 2010.  Placing marine protected areas onto the ecosystem-based management seascape. ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most recently, the February 2010 issue of the [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] (PNAS) included several new studies that showed that scientifically-based MPA networks have a net positive impact on both ecosystem productivity and associated fisheries. One of the studies found that such well-designed networks can simultaneously improve the quality of ocean habitat, increase the size and abundance of sea life, and increase fishing yields and profits.&lt;ref name="Gaines"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.0906473107 |jstor=25748482 |pmid=20200311 |pmc=2972919 |title=Designing marine reserve networks for both conservation and fisheries management |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=107 |issue=43 |pages=18286–93 |year=2010 |last1=Gaines |first1=Steven D. |last2=White |first2=Crow |last3=Carr |first3=Mark H. |last4=Palumbi |first4=Stephen R. |authorlink4=Stephen Palumbi |bibcode=2010PNAS..10718286G |url=https://works.bepress.com/cwhite31/4/download/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several studies have stressed the importance of location: The location of protected areas is important. In order to be effective, marine reserves must be placed in the areas where fish and shellfish feed and breed.&lt;ref name="Halpern"/&gt;

===MLPA Controversy / Conflict of Interest Investigation===
The MLPA Initiative recently began to receive negative press from fishing rights groups and individual fishermen due to the apparent [[conflict of interest]] of some MPA officials and unfair practices in the MLPA process.&lt;ref name="Holland"&gt;Richard Holland. 2009. Rules Disregarded, Changed. [http://www.wonews.com/Blog.aspx?id=608&amp;AuthorID=59062&amp;t=BLATANT%20FRAUD]. Viewed 29 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; On May 14, 2009, Fish and Game Commission Member Jim Kellogg called for the Commission to put the MLPA process on hold due to the state budget crisis. Senate Majority Leader [[Dean Florez]] and North Coast Assemblyman [[Wes Chesbro]] requested investigation into conflicts of interest among Blue Ribbon Task Force members as well as sources of funding for the MLPA.&lt;ref name="Indy Bay"&gt;Indy Bay. 2009. Jim Kellogg Asks Commission to Put MLPA Process on Hold. [http://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2009/05/15/18595079.php]. Viewed 29 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 19, 2009, the [[California Fair Political Practices Commission]] (CFPPC) disclosed that its Enforcement Division had started a formal investigation into Fish and Game Commissioner George Michael Sutton, under charge of having violated the [[California Fair Political Practices Commission|Political Reform Act of 1974]] (PRA) due his conflicts of interest on votes on the MLPA while serving on the Fish and Game Commission.&lt;ref name="Earthtimes.org"&gt;Earth Times. 2009. CCFCC Applauds Fair Political Practices Commission Opening Investigation of Fish and Game Commissioner Mike Sutton. [http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/ccfcc-applauds-fair-political-practices,837883.shtml]. Viewed 29 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; On June 24, after investigating the matter, the CFPPC declared that Commissioner Sutton can participate in any and all public processes and deliberations surrounding the MLPA without conflict.&lt;ref name="Woodlock"&gt;Woodlock, Lawrence T. Senior Counsel, Legal Division, Fair Political Practices Commission. [Letter to Steven S. Lucas, Nielson, Merksamer, Parrinello, Mueller &amp; Naylor LLP re conflict-of-interests provisions of Political Reform Act]. June 24, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lawsuits===
On January 27, 2011, a number of member organizations of the Partnership for Sustainable Oceans led by Robert C. Fletcher (a former California Department of Fish and Game Chief Deputy director) filed a lawsuit challenging closures of certain fishing areas under the California Fish and Game Commission (CGFC).  The plaintiff's challenged the legality of the CGFC's ability to impose its own regulation and claimed that the commission had violated the [[California Administrative Procedure Act]] and the [[California Environmental Quality Act]] (CEQA).{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

As part of administrative state government process, the Game and Fish Commission is required by law to disclose to the public all matters concerning MLPA research, regulation and closures. The BRTF (Blue Ribbon Task Force) and MPT (Master Plan Team), who were charged with the task of conducting research and establishing a conservation plan, had been executively ordered not to disclose the information it had obtained and produced by order of California Resource Secretary Mike Chrisman.  Documents obtained in the PRA lawsuit included an email dated April 7, 2007 and advised BRTF members to "give your own notes verbally and throw them away after."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wonews.com/Blog.aspx?id=1244{{full citation needed|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This constituted a breach of the [[California Public Records Act]], which states that "the people have the right of access to information concerning the conduct of the people's business".{{cite quote|date=January 2017}}

On March 10, 2011, a California Superior Court ruling found in favor of the plaintiffs, citing that the BRTF and MPT had failed to produce evidence that it complied with the California Public Records act while conducting research from April 2007 through November 2009. It cited that the practices used by the privately-funded BRTF and MPT under the GFC did not comply with "open and transparent" processes as outlined in the Public Records Act and ordered the California Game and Fish Commission to pay all legal fees incurred by Mr. Fletcher and his team.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wonews.com/Blog.aspx?id=1292{{full citation needed|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fletcher Court decision further declared that the BRTF and Master Science Team were "public bodies."  According to the Court:  "Based on the facts present here, they cannot be characterized as private contractors or consultants or truly independent advisory bodies, but are "State bodies" engaged in state governmental decision making."&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher Final Order adopting tentative minute order p 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Court arrived at this decision by applying the criteria of the ''[[California State University, Fresno]] Association, Inc. v. Superior Court (2001)'' case&lt;ref&gt;[https://law.justia.com/cases/california/court-of-appeal/4th/90/810.html California State University, Fresno Association, Inc. v. Superior Court (2001)] 90 Cal App 4th 810.&lt;/ref&gt; that whether a particular entity qualifies as a governmental agency depends on whether it is performing  governmental actions.  The Court further found that private individuals on the BRTF and Master Plan Team were not entitled to privacy rights over public records.

There is a second relevant superior court case of Gurney v. California Department of Fish and Game et al. Superior Court of California in and For the County of Mendocino Case #SCUK-CVG-10-57448.   Gurney had attempted to video tape&lt;ref&gt;Gurney was followed by protests or attempted protests by former U.S. Congressman Dan Hamburg, fisherman Dennis Mayo and five other prospective protestors.  The rule was eventually changed.&lt;/ref&gt; a North Group Initiative Stakeholder Group (SG) meeting where the SG group was split in half to develop different marine reserves or arrays.  He was forced to stop for disrupting the meeting. Gurney privately financed suing the Initiative and Fish and Wildlife in order to establish that the [[Bagley-Keene Open Meeting Act]] rules—which allow video taping—applied.   While the Court could have decided the case on the narrow technical grounds that neither divided group constituted a majority of a public body and therefore there was no quorum, the court issued a more fundamental decision that the SG was not a public body so there were no rights to sue for violations of the California Public Meeting Laws.  The court contrasted the SG with the clearly legislatively created and public meeting body the SAT or Master Planning Team.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

There is a fascinating side decision in the Gurney case regarding the naming of Melissa Hansen-Miller an employee of the initiative as a party.  The California deputy attorney argued in a motion to dismiss her as a named party of the initiative that:

{{quote|The MLPA Initiative moreover is not an organization, agency, or association of any kind which may be sued in a court of law.  While staffed by CNRA and DFG the "Initiative" is not incorporated.  It has no officers, and it has no members or association.}}

The Court granted the motion to dismiss Melissa Hansen-Miller from the case on these grounds.

Despite this ''de minimis'' to nonexistent legal status, the 38 million budgeted and highly organized initiative created by Memorandum of Understanding between the Department of Fish and Game, the Resources Agency, and the Resource legacy foundation conducted the largest marine planning effort in California if not U.S. history from 2004 to 2011.

There were substantial controversies between Native Americans and the North Group Science Advisory Team (SAT).  The SAT initiated a survey of Native American harvesting which was conducted prior to the issuance of an [[Institutional Review Board]] (IRB) permit or conditional exemption.&lt;ref&gt;Such permits or conditional exemptions are required under the 1974 Research Act.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Tribes wanted to keep answers confidential and have greater Native American participation in the survey.  The SAT agreed to keep the answers confidential and established the procedure to do so.  The SAT eventually got the necessary I.R.B. permit exemption although there remained a controversy of co-mingling information gathered before the conditional exemption was issued.   Native Americans wanted to have a qualified Native American appointed to the SAT.  Their first nomination was rejected as unqualified.  The second qualified nomination was not acted upon by the Director of Fish and Wildlife.   The SAT was asked to treat Native American harvesting separately from state recreational harvesting and the SAT answered that was not legal.&lt;ref&gt;This legal opinion is clearly overbroad and not universally accepted.  For example under the Magnuson Pacific Coast Fisheries Regulations require that the recreational catch numbers for the State be kept separate from the Tribal Harvest to insure that the Tribal allocation is met.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On February 11, 2010, meeting  the SAT substantially changed the statewide definition of taking used in all other marine regions for the Levels Of Protection (LOP) model. It was changed  to be the maximum amount allowed by state and federal law.&lt;ref&gt;See The g.1 draft issued 7-27-10 answer to science questions heard by the SAT on July 28, 2010.  California Marine Life Protection Act Initiative Master Plan Science Advisory Team California Marine Life Protection Act Master Plan Science Advisory Team.&lt;/ref&gt;  This meant that million-plus recreational license holders were assumed to harvest the full limit every single day within each proposed North Group marine reserve.  Under this assumption, Native American harvesting in thinly populated northern California, in a single reserve, for a single day, was greater than the annual harvest of all of Southern California.   Native Americans erupted in a demonstration before the SAT at the June 29, 2010, SAT meeting demanding access to the SAT.   Individual, Tribes, and North Coast Tribal Chairman's Association,&lt;ref&gt;E-mails 6-18-2010 and 6-22-2010 Rocha to Wiseman (Initiative Executive Director) and replies.&lt;/ref&gt; followed up with requests  to allow Tribal PH.D. and other Tribal scientists to get on the agenda and submit written peer-reviewed marine studies.  These requests were denied by the SAT. There was a second demonstration on November 17, 2010, by scientists from the Tribes who professionally objected to not being allowed to present to the SAT.  The scientists stated their Ph. D. or other educational qualifications and their area of marine research.&lt;ref&gt;November 17, 2010 California Marine Life Protection Act Initiative Master Plan Science Advisory Team California Marine Life Protection Act Master Plan Science Advisory Team.&lt;/ref&gt;  Native Americans were never allowed to present on the last minute SAT take assumption changes to the Statewide Levels of Protection Model.  The LOP model was never independently peer reviewed.  The amended LOP model and the science behind it remain controversial to this day.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1713">The '''Mikan Drill''' is a [[basketball]] drill commonly credited to [[George Mikan]] and [[Ray Meyer]]. It is designed to help basketball [[Center (basketball)|centers]] and [[forward (basketball)|forwards]] develop rhythm, timing for [[Rebound (basketball)|rebounding]], and scoring in [[Key (basketball)|the paint]]. It is also used for outside players to better their [[layup]] skills and increase stamina, for longer games.

The drill is practiced as follows: From under the basket, make a layup with the right hand, rebound the ball under the net with the left hand and make a layup with the left hand. Rebound with the right hand and layup with the right hand. Continue to repeat this, alternating hands. Eventually the player should learn how to quickly grab the ball and take a shot while taking the permitted two steps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web 
| title = Mikan Drill
| url = http://www.nba.com/canada/madskillz/madskillz_drill6e.html
| accessdate = January 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Virtually every great forward and center since Mikan has practiced this drill. [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]] describes teaching it to children he coached in his book ''[[A Season on the Reservation]]''. [[Shaquille O'Neal]], who admired Mikan so much that he offered to pay for his funeral expenses, learned the drill from his coach [[Dale Brown (basketball)|Dale Brown]], when O'Neal played college basketball at [[LSU Tigers basketball|LSU]].  The drill is more or less a standard practice procedure for all basketball "[[center (basketball)|big men]]".

'''Pittsburgh International Race Complex''' (commonly known as Pitt Race) is an auto racing road course located in [[Wampum, Pennsylvania]].  Pitt Race hosts amateur and professional automobile, motorcycle, and karting events.

== The track ==
[[File:Pitt Race Ariel Photo.jpg|left|thumb|300x300px|Aerial photo of the Pitt Race facility, including the South Track addition]]
Pittsburgh International Race Complex offers three track configurations. The North track configuration is 1.6 miles and the South track covers 1.2 miles.  The full course is 2.78 miles in length and combines both the North and South track.  All tracks feature significant elevation change throughout and were designed to follow the natural terrain.  Pitt Race hosts many different sports car series such as [[Sports Car Club of America|SCCA]] and [[National Auto Sport Association|NASA]], as well as holding track days and open tests for both cars and motorcycles.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ellwoodcityledger.com/news/business/transformation-continues-at-former-beaverun/article_b2b420cb-18e0-5340-b424-a266af1e6f3c.html|title=Transformation continues at former BeaveRun|last=Ledger|first=Louise Carroll For The|work=Ellwood City Ledger|access-date=2017-06-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2017 the track will host the 8th round of the [[MotoAmerica|MotoAmerica Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.motoamerica.com/pittsburgh-international-race-complex|title=Championship of Pittsburgh|work=MotoAmerica|access-date=2017-07-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The track also runs a program called Total Vehicle Control (TVC).  It provides instruction in situational awareness, driving dynamics, skid control, emergency braking, and accident avoidance techniques.  The program is targeted at commercial and emergency vehicle drivers as well as individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/local/west/2013/07/10/Beaver-County-s-Pitt-Race-is-like-driving-school-on-steroids/stories/201307100150|title=Beaver County's Pitt Race 'is like driving school on steroids'|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|access-date=2017-07-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Corvette C5 NASA Pitt Race.jpg|left|thumb|300x300px|C5 Corvette at NASA Event]]
The 0.82 mile kart track was designed by [[Alan Wilson (motorsport)|Alan Wilson]].  It plays host to several major kart series including WKA and USPKS as well as featuring 9.5&amp;nbsp;hp rental karts.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.com/motorsports-facility-promises-to-stimulate-area-driving-enthusiasts-and-local/article_4852ce72-adf3-5932-9e1b-8eb11f8a2431.html|title=Motorsports facility promises to stimulate area driving enthusiasts and local economy|last=Editor|first=Chuck Curti, Assistant Sports|work=Timesonline.com|access-date=2017-06-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The idea for the track came from two area attorneys, who attracted local investors to assist in the funding the facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://autoweek.com/article/car-news/tracks-little-guy-designer-alan-wilson-focuses-club-level|title=Tracks For The Little Guy: Designer Alan Wilson Focuses On The Club Level|work=Autoweek|access-date=2017-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The track broke ground in December 2001.  It officially opened on July 1, 2002 as BeaveRun Motorsports Complex.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  It included a 1.6 mile road course, a 0.82 mile [[Kart racing|kart]] track, and a six-acre [[skidpad]] used for driver training and [[autocross]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  In 2004, work began on a one-mile addition to the main track with trees being cleared and plans drawn up, but the project was put on hold in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.com/road-course-expansion-in-works-at-beaverun/article_bc1e7dd9-6cb9-527e-ae97-a7c167025df8.html|title=Road course expansion in works at BeaveRun|work=Timesonline.com|access-date=2017-08-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 12,000 square-foot event center overlooking the North Track was also constructed at this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.com/beaverun-racetrack-ready-to-proceed-with-expansion/article_cd4f3e9a-5a45-583d-bd1b-2bc89943fb01.html|title=BeaveRun racetrack ready to proceed with expansion|work=Timesonline.com|access-date=2017-08-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 the track was bought by Jim and Kathy Stout, and re-branded as Pittsburgh International Race Complex.  A three-stage renovation of the facility began soon after.  The South Track addition, which added 1.2 miles of track, was the largest update to the facility and was completed in 2015.  It can be run as its own circuit or run combined with the North Track.  An expanded Vehicle Dynamics Area was also part of the facility renovations.  Both the North and South Tracks were repaved in 2017.  A new timing and scoring building located on pit lane was completed in 2017.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Preston Hall''' is a former manorial home and associated estate in [[Aylesford]] in the [[English county]] of [[Kent]]. It dates to the Norman period and was owned by the Culpepper family for over 400 years. Part of the estate became the [[The Royal British Legion|Royal British Legion Village]] in the 1920s and the hall itself was used as a hospital after [[World War II]]. The estate was broken up over a period of time and most of the area it once covered is now used for housing. The hall itself was transformed into 36 flats in 2015. The Heart of Kent Hospice also occupies a site on the property.

At the end of the 19th century the estate stretched from the current [[A20 road (England)|A20]] to the [[River Medway]] just south of Aylesford.&lt;ref name=os1895&gt; Ordnance Survey Map of Kent, XXXI.SW. Revised: 1895, Published: 1898.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=times13jan48&gt;The Preston Hall Estate, near Maidstone, Kent, ''[[The Times]]'', issue 19758, 1848-01-13, p.10.&lt;/ref&gt; The hall is located towards the southern edge of the estate, having been rebuilt there in the mid 19th century. It is around {{convert|2.5|mi|km}} north-west of [[Maidstone]] and {{convert|0.5|mi|km}} south of Aylesford. The [[M20 motorway]] and the [[Medway Valley line|Maidstone to Gillingham railway line]] both cross the former estate between the hall and the river. Junction 5 of the M20 and [[Aylesford railway station]] are on the edges of the former estate.&lt;ref name=os1895 /&gt;&lt;ref name=osx148&gt;Explorer Map 148 – Maidstone &amp; the Medway Towns, [[Ordnance Survey]], 2015-09-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The estate dates to at least 1102. Between around 1300 and 1734 the estate was owned by the [[Culpeper baronets]]. Jeffrey Culpepper was [[High Sheriff of Kent]] twice, once between 1364–66 and again in 1374 and the family remained influential in [[Kent]] throughout their time at the hall. The Baronetcy of Culpeper of Preston Hall was created on 17 May 1627 for William Culpeper. He served as High Sheriff of Kent in 1637 and his grandson, [[Sir Thomas Culpeper, 3rd Baronet]] served as High Sheriff in 1704 and was [[Maidstone (UK Parliament constituency)|Member of Parliament for Maidstone]] between 1705 and 1713 and again between 1715 and 1723. On his death in 1723 the estates passed to Alicia Culpepper, Thomas' sister, and, though her, to her husband's family, the Milners.&lt;ref name=burke&gt;[[John Burke (genealogist)|Burke J]], [[Bernard Burke|Burke JB]] (1838) Culpepper of Preston Hall, ''A genealogical and heraldic history of the extinct and dormant baronetcies of England'', pp.143–144.

The Milner family lived at Preston Hall until the mid 19th century, Charles Milner also serving as High Sheriff in 1808.&lt;ref name=gaz2feb08&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16115|page=173|date=1808-02-02|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; The property was purchased by [[Edward Ladd Betts]], a successful railway contractor, in 1848.&lt;ref name=whhistory /&gt; When the estate was offered for sale it covered an area of {{convert|180|acre|ha}}, although much more land was in the ownership of the estate in parishes stretching from [[Boxley, Kent|Boxley]] and [[Burham]] to [[East Malling]], with farmland covering {{convert|1650|acre|ha}} and woodlands extending for {{convert|800|acre|ha}}.&lt;ref name=times13jan48 /&gt; Betts demolished the old house and commissioned [[John Thomas (sculptor)|John Thomas]] to build a replacement in the Jacobean style slightly to the south of the original house location.&lt;ref name=os1895 /&gt;&lt;ref name=nh&gt;[https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1070492 Preston Hall], [[Historic England]].

Betts landscaped the estate during his time at the hall, laying out a series of carriage drivers and lawns. He built [[Aylesford railway station]] on the [[Medway Valley Line]] to make his access to Preston Hall easier.&lt;ref name=whhistory /&gt; Betts ran into financial difficulties  after the [[Panic of 1866|banking crisis of 1866]], became insolvent the following year and was forced to sell the hall which was brought by [[Thomas Brassey]], also a railway contractor.&lt;ref name=whhistory /&gt;

Brassey had worked with Betts and Peto in the [[Peto, Brassey and Betts]] partnership. The hall was inherited by his son, [[Henry Brassey]] who was [[Sandwich (UK Parliament constituency)|MP for Sandwich]], in 1870. On the death of Brassey's wife in 1898 the hall was inherited by their son, [[Henry Leonard Campbell Brassey]] and his wife Violet. The couple moved to [[Apethorpe Hall]] in Northamptonshire in 1904 and sold off much of the land associated with the estate which was reduced to around {{convert|24.9|acre|ha}} in area.&lt;ref name=whhistory /&gt;

During [[World War I]] the hall was used as a hospital and convalescent home for servicemen wounded in the war.

At a time when the only treatment for TB was fresh air and rest, the cottages had verandas so that TB patient’s beds could be pushed outside. The cottages were large enough that patient’s families could live with them. Eventually about 30 cottages were built. Numbers of patients had fallen by 1925 when the [[Royal British Legion]] took over the running of the colony.&lt;ref name=times15may24&gt;Future Of Preston Hall, ''[[The Times]]'', issue 43652, 1924-05-15, p.12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=times17jan31&gt;British Legion Village, ''[[The Times]]'', issue 45723, 1931-01-17, p.8.&lt;/ref&gt; The village quickly increased in population and became known as the British Legion Village.&lt;ref name=rblhistory&gt;[https://www.rbli.co.uk/page/our-history Our history], Royal British Legion Industries.

A [[cricket]] ground had been built within the grounds of the hall by the mid 19th century. It was used in 1846 and 1847, when the hall was owned by the Milner family, by [[Kent County Cricket Club]] for two [[first-class cricket]] matches, both played against [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]]. These were the ground's only first-class fixtures&lt;ref name=cafc&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/289_f.html First-Class Matches played on Preston Hall Ground, Aylesford], CricketArchive.

Prior to the formation of the first county club in 1842, Kent teams had played at the [[Old County Ground]] in [[Town Malling]], {{convert|2.5|mi|km}} west of Preston Hall. The county returned to the ground to play four matches later in the 19th century.

The ground was also used for a number of non-first-class matches. Aylesford Cricket Club used the ground during the ownership of Charles Milner&lt;ref name=milton /&gt; and a side called Preston Hall used the ground between 1873 and 1897, as did a team bearing the name of [[Henry Brassey]]. Matches are known to have been played against a variety of well-known amateur teams including [[I Zingari]], [[Free Foresters]], The Mote, [[Royal Engineers Cricket Club|Royal Engineers]], [[Sevenoaks Vine]] and Eton Ramblers.&lt;ref name=camisc&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/289_misc.html Other matches played on Preston Hall Ground, Aylesford], CricketArchive.

== History ==

=== FIU Community Stadium ===
FIU Community Stadium was the first dedicated sports facility at the school, replacing [[Tamiami Park|Tamiami Field]]. Construction officially began on July 24, 1994 and the facility opened on September 24, 1995, as a 7,500-seat football and track stadium. It was built as a joint venture between FIU, [[Miami-Dade County Public Schools]], [[Miami-Dade County, Florida#Parks|Miami-Dade Parks]], and the Miami-Dade County Youth Fair.&lt;ref name="opening" /&gt; In anticipation of the inaugural [[FIU Panthers football|FIU Golden Panthers football]]{{#tag:ref|FIU dropped the word "Golden" from its nickname starting in the 2010–11 school year.|group="Note"}} season in fall 2002, the university placed movable [[bleachers]] around the stadium's [[all-weather running track]] in 2001, which increased the stadium's capacity to 17,000 seats.

In 2007, the university announced a major expansion and redesign for FIU Stadium. The redesign of FIU Stadium would increase the stadium's capacity to 45,000 fans, to be built in phases. For the first phase of the expansion, the school demolished a large portion of the original 1995 stadium. The west, south and east sides of FIU Stadium were taken down and construction began on the new, permanent stadium. The expansion was completed in September 2008 for the [[2008 FIU Golden Panthers football team|2008 football season]].

On October 1, 2011 FIU Stadium drew its largest attendance in school history. A crowd of 22,268 came to watch the Panthers play the Duke Blue Devils football team for the team's 2011 homecoming game. During the game, the [[Goodyear Blimp]] made its first appearance at FIU Stadium. The [[Miami Tower]] in [[Downtown Miami]] was also lit in blue and gold from September 26 to October 1, 2011 in honor of the game.&lt;ref name="tower"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.fiu.edu/2011/09/iconic-downtown-building-to-go-blue-and-gold-for-homecoming|title=Iconic Downtown Building to go Blue and Gold for Homecoming|last=Merille|first=Eduardo|date=September 1, 2011|work=FIU News|accessdate=July 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Renaming ===
On April 3, 2017 FIU stadium was renamed Riccardo Silva Stadium.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://therealdeal.com/miami/2017/04/03/fiu-names-stadium-for-entrepreneur-real-estate-investor-riccardo-silva/|title=FIU names stadium for entrepreneur, real estate investor Riccardo Silva|date=2017-04-03|work=The Real Deal Miami|access-date=2017-04-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The decision to rename the stadium is in recognition of the support given by Italian businessman [[Riccardo Silva]] to the FIU Department of Intercollegiate Athletics since 2015. 

The newly renamed stadium home opener featured a performance by Grammy nominated Latin star [[Maluma (singer)|Maluma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/Colombian-Music-Sensation-Maluma-Set-to-Perform-at-Miami-FCs-Historic-Home-Opener-375110211.html|title=Maluma Set to Perform at Miami FC's Home Opener|work=NBC 6 South Florida|access-date=2018-04-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.miamifc.com/news/2016/04/01/global-music-idol-maluma-joins-miami-fc-at-historic-home-opener|title=Global music idol Maluma joins Miami FC at historic home opener|access-date=2018-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maluma returned to the stadium in April 2018 to record the video for the Spanish language version of [[Jason Derulo]]'s World Cup 2018 anthem for Coca-Coca.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.miamifc.com/news/2018/04/17/maluma-returns-to-riccardo-silva-stadium-to-shoot-new-music-video|title=Maluma Returns to Riccardo Silva Stadium to Shoot New Video for Coca Cola's 2018 FIFA World Cup Anthem|access-date=2018-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/features/fl-reg-music-videos-filmed-in-miami-20180423-story.html|title=Drake, Taylor Swift, Zayn and others make Miami music videos a trend again|last=Diaz|first=Johnny|work=Sun-Sentinel.com|access-date=2018-04-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure and facilities ==
Designed by [[Rossetti Architects]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://facilities.fiu.edu/projects/BT-842/BT-842FIUStadiumExpansionMasterPlanAELegalAd.pdf|title=NOTICE TO ARCHITECT/ENGINEERS &amp;ndash; BT-842 FIU Stadium Expansion &amp; Master Plan|date=September 9, 2011|publisher=[[Florida International University]]|page=1&amp;ndash;3|format=PDF|accessdate=July 4, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130124214750/http://facilities.fiu.edu/projects/BT-842/BT-842FIUStadiumExpansionMasterPlanAELegalAd.pdf|archivedate=January 24, 2013|df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt; the stadium has a {{convert|6500|sqft|m2|adj=on}} Panther Club on the ground level, an upper concourse for additional fan seating and concessions, a [[jumbotron]] scoreboard, and 19 [[luxury suites]]. Seating includes chairback seats and bench seating, all with backrests. Panther fans shout "Rattle the Cage!" and fans will stomp and jump in unison on the bleachers creating a very loud [[reverberation]] throughout the steel and aluminum stadium.{{citation needed|date=July 2012|reason=Every fan says this about every stadium.}} The Rattling of the Cage is done throughout the game, notably while the team is on defense and during cheers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antisteez.com/news/fiu-rattles-the-city/|title=FIU Rattles The City|date=November 30, 2010|publisher=Antisteez.com|accessdate=July 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constructionequipmentguide.com/Odebrecht-Building-Expandable-Stadium-at-FIU/9054/|title=Odebrecht Building Expandable Stadium at FIU|last=Brooks|first=Jeff|date=August 1, 2007|publisher=ConstructionEquipmentGuide.com|id=9054|edition=Southeast}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017 Riccardo Silva Stadium has also seen significant improvements made to the facility over the last two months, with completion of two major projects.  The first is the installation of a new state of the art playing surface.  The new surface, FieldTurf’s Revolution 360, features fibers that provide for optimal durability, resilience and feel and is used by many of the country’s biggest NFL and soccer teams.

Riccardo Silva Stadium has also been enhanced by installation of a new videoboard, replacing the existing scoreboard, providing a huge boost to the fan experience at The Miami FC’s soccer games.  Measuring approximately 31x59 feet, the new videoboard will feature a 13HD pixel layout, the premier technology for outdoor applications within the sports industry. It will have full live video and instant replay capabilities, along with multiple zones of content, including statistics and graphics.

In April 2011, the field was named Alfonso Field after alumnus [[David F. Alfonso]]. The facility also includes a two-story, {{convert|50000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} field house, named for [[Higher education governing board#Trustees|trustee]] R. Kirk Landon, which includes a {{convert|14000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} weight room. The stadium also includes {{convert|8500|sqft|m2}} of locker rooms, an equipment room, a full-service athletic training facility, a ticket office, a merchandise area, and an FIU Athletics Hall of Fame.

[[File:Skydiving in Central London!! cropped.jpg|right|thumb|Skysurfer on a simulator]]

'''Sky surfing''' is a type of [[skydiving]] in which the skydiver wears a board attached to his or her feet and performs [[surfing]]-style [[aerobatics]] during [[freefall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.topendsports.com/sport/more/skysurfing.htm|title=Skysurfing the Sport|website=www.topendsports.com|language=en|access-date=2017-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The boards used are generally smaller than actual [[surfboard]]s, and look more like [[snowboard]]s or large [[skateboard]]s. The attachment to the feet is normally made removable, so that if the skydiver loses control or has difficulty opening their parachute, the board can be jettisoned. Surf Flite was the first sky board company, copyrighted by [[Jerry Loftis]] (January 1, 1969 – August 12, 1998).

Skysurfing is a skill requiring considerable practice. The simplest skysurfing technique is to stand upright on the board during freefall, and tilt the nose of the board down to generate forward movement. However even this basic technique is a balancing act which experienced skydivers find tricky to learn. The extra drag of the board tends to upset the balance and make the skydiver flip over. The jumper must also learn to control the board and their body position so as to open the parachute in a stable configuration. More advanced aerobatics such as loops, rolls and helicopter spins, are more difficult still and are tackled once the basics have been mastered. Since some techniques require constant spinning at a high speed, one technique some skysurfers take to is tightly wrapping ace bandages all the way up the arms and legs to keep the blood from pooling at the end of your limbs. Even with the bandage technique, however, many techniques in skysurfing can be extremely painful.

Because of the possibility of dropping the board, not every skydiving club permits skysurfing, and only a minority of skydivers have attempted this recent specialisation in the sport.

When a skysurfer is filmed by another skydiver falling alongside them, the resulting film gives the appearance that the skysurfer is riding on the air in the same way a surfer rides on a wave. The downward motion is not very apparent and this creates the illusion that a skysurfer is gliding on air currents like a sailplane or hang glider. In fact a skysurfer always falls at a high speed comparable to any other freefalling parachutist.  The competitive discipline of skysurfing is a team sport consisting of a skysurfer and a camera flyer with a video camera.

== History ==
The Sky Surf was invented by two French skydivers, Dominique Jacquet and Jean-Pascal Oron in 1986 but it became popular and gained recognition during the 1990s thanks to the efforts of the first few exponents to master the more complex aerobatics, such as the late [[Patrick de Gayardon]] and the late Jerry Loftis. The rise of skysurfing coincided with other new-age disciplines in skydiving, such as [[Freestyle skydiving|freestyle]] and [[freeflying]]. Freestyle skydiving is a balletic, mostly individual style which seeks to extend the sport beyond the traditional belly-to-earth flat position used by most skydivers who make formations with their bodies.

Freeflying is also a form of skydiving using a variety of body positions, such as head-down or feet-to-earth, while still building formations with others. These evolutions in skydiving have taken the sport further away from the traditional image of a daredevil stunt.

In 1991, after performing standing on a surfboard for a skysurfing advertisement of [[Coca-Cola|Coca Cola]] Ray Palmer became the first Australian skysurfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dropzone.com/forum/Skydiving_C1/General_Skydiving_Discussions_F18/Skysurfing_P2234113|title=Skysurfing : Dropzone.com Skydiving Forums|website=www.dropzone.com|access-date=2017-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skysurfing reached its peak in popularity in the late 1990s.  Skysurfers were featured in prime time television commercials for major brands like [[Pepsi]] and [[AT&amp;T]]. Competitive team skysurfing was featured as part of the [[ESPN]] [[X Games]] from 1995 to 2000.  In 1996 and 1997, the [[SSI Pro Tour]] staged eight X-Trials qualifying events in both North America and Europe.  During this six-year period, pro skysurf teams received a total of $392,000 in cash winnings and the discipline garnered over 100 hours of global TV exposure without incident.  After ESPN decided not to renew the sport for the seventh season, skysurfing has become exceptionally rare in the skydiving community.  Reasons for the decline include the rise in popularity of freeflying and [[wingsuit flying]], the hazards associated with flying and releasing the board, and the dwindling number of experienced skysurfers to train new pilots.

== Competitions ==
In general, a sky surfing team include two persons: a sky surfer and a camera flier. Judges give scores to a sky surfing team not only for the variety of tricks and the total performance but also for the skills of camera flier to catch the best moments of performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u3NGyquUc7EC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;lpg=PA30|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 75% of the total score is calculated on sky surfer's performance,  and the rest is made up on the cameraman's score.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UpF_CT5NTQwC&amp;pg=PT42&amp;lpg=PT42|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Skysurf World Championship was held in Efes, [[Turkey]] on 13–21 September 1997 by the International Parachuting Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i7eRl7Az4KEC&amp;pg=PA112&amp;lpg=PA112|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Main sky surfing competitions are USA national sky surf Championships, Sky surfing world Championships, ESPN X games, European Sky surfing Championships and SSI pro tour sky surfing.

'''Stockbridge Racecourse''' was a [[horse racing]] venue in [[Hampshire]], [[England]] which closed in 1898.

== History ==

The first racing at Stockbridge took place on Houghton Down from, at the latest, 1775, and possibly earlier.&lt;ref name="GreyhoundDerby"/&gt; By 1839 a new course had been developed on Danebury Hill near [[Nether Wallop]].

The course is associated with leading [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[horse trainer|trainer]] [[John Barham Day|John Day]] who, together with stable [[jockey]] [[Tom Cannon, Sr.|Tom Cannon]], sent out multiple [[British Classic Races|Classic]] winners.  He trained from stables at Danebury House, built in 1832 by [[Lord George Bentinck]], adjacent to the track and now the [[headquarters]] of a [[winery]].  Another important, but short-lived figure in the history of the course was Harry, [[Marquis of Hastings]] who had horses trained at Stockbridge in the 1860s.{{sfn|Graham|2012|pp=1-6}}  A notable visitor to the track was King [[Edward VII]], who whilst still [[Prince of Wales]] watched his horse, Counterpane, come last in the Stockbridge Cup and then fall down dead.  It is reported that souvenir hunters pulled out every hair of its tail.&lt;ref name="SouthernLife"/&gt;

Horses were often entered and shown at the Swan Inn in Stockbridge. Race week was usually in June or July.&lt;ref name="Pollock"/&gt;  The track had a straight mile and a severe 'elbow'.{{sfn|Graham|2011|p=3}}
In the years before its closure, the major races at the course were:{{sfn|Graham|2011|p=98-102}}

*Bibury Stakes - a 1 1/2 mile [[Handicap (horse racing)|handicap]], worth £251 in 1898
*Stockbridge Cup Stakes - a 6 [[furlong]] race, worth £290
*Hurstborne Stakes - a 5 furlong race for two-year-olds, worth £622
*Arlington Plate - a mile handicap, worth £460
*Champagne Stakes - a 5 furlong race for two-year-olds, worth £340

== Closure ==

In 1898, the land on which the eastern end of the course stood was inherited by Marianne Vaudrey who strongly disapproved of [[gambling]], and therefore refused to extend the lease.&lt;ref name="Pollock"/&gt;  At the time, [[Jockey Club]] rules stated that all racecourses should have a straight mile and since Stockbridge's straight mile extended into this area of land, the course was forced to close.  The final meeting took place on 7 July 1898.

After closure, the gallops served as a testing site for [[Spitfire]]s during [[World War II]].  Meanwhile, the Bibury Club Grandstand, which opened in 1867, survived until 1973, when it was destroyed by fire. The ivy-covered ruins of the Grandstand remain, but are in a precarious condition.&lt;ref name="Pollock"/&gt;

Today, the ground on which the course stood is part of the Danebury Racing Stables estate owned by trainer Ken Cunningham-Brown.

The Southern half of the course is now part of an organic dairy farm farmed by A Burnfield &amp; Sons Ltd.

'''The Beautiful Game''' ({{lang-pt|o jogo bonito}}) is a nickname for [[association football]] popularised by the Brazilian professional footballer [[Pelé]]. Although the exact origin of the phrase is disputed, football commentator [[Stuart Hall (presenter)|Stuart Hall]] used it in 1958. Hall admired [[Peter Doherty (footballer)|Peter Doherty]] when he went to see [[Manchester City]] play at [[Maine Road]] and used the term "The Beautiful Game" to describe Doherty's style when playing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Stuart Hall |last=Harper |first=Nick |quote=The player I fell in love with and who inspired me to coin the phrase "the beautiful game" was Peter Doherty, an inside forward, my first hero. |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2003/may/02/newsstory.sport11 |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=2 May 2003 |accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The exact origins of the term are disputed. The origin has been attributed to Brazilian footballer [[Didi (footballer)|Waldyr Pereira (Didi)]],&lt;ref name="Moore"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/world-cup-2010/7890542/Brian-Moore-South-Africa-World-Cup-besmirched-beautiful-game.html |author= Moore, Brian |title= South Africa World Cup besmirched 'beautiful' game |date= 15 July 2010 |newspaper= The Daily Telegraph |location=London |accessdate= 18 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the presenter [[Stuart Hall (presenter)|Stuart Hall]] claimed to have originated it in 1958.&lt;ref name="Moore"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hall, S; Mayo, S: ''The Daily Mayo'', 6 May 2009, BBC Radio 5 Live&lt;/ref&gt; The English author and football fanatic [[H. E. Bates]] used the term earlier, including in a 1952 newspaper piece extolling the virtues of the game entitled "Brains in the Feet".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=The Sunday Times | last=Bates | first=H. E. | date=16 November 1952 | page=4 | url=http://www.hebatescompanion.com/node/1091 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier writers used the term in 1848 to describe the game of ''[[baaga'adowe]]'', a forerunner of [[lacrosse]] as played by [[Ojibwe]] at [[Vauxhall Gardens]] in [[London]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Usage==
[[File:Pelé Mar del Plata 1965.PNG|thumb|upright|[[Pelé]]]]
Brazilian footballer [[Pelé]] is credited with making the phrase synonymous with football.&lt;ref name=”Fox”/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The World Cup will show why football is still a beautiful game|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/10887009/The-World-Cup-will-show-why-football-is-still-a-beautiful-game.html|issue=12 June 2014|publisher=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, he named his autobiography ''My Life and the Beautiful Game''. The book's dedication reads "I dedicate this book to all the people who have made this great game the Beautiful Game."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7PdWkxoZ0l0C&amp;q=I+dedicate+this+book#v=onepage&amp;q=dedicate&amp;f=false |authors= Pelé, Robert L. Fish, Shep Messing |title= My Life and the Beautiful Game: The Autobiography of Pelé |year= 2007 |isbn= 9781602391963 |page= v}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase has entered the language as a description for football.&lt;ref name=”Fox”&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2016/05/12/pele-journey-from-street-urchin-to-soccer-greatest-star-hits-big-screen.html "Pelé's journey from street urchin to soccer's greatest star hits the big screen"]. Fox News. Retrieved 31 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

It is used as a title for the 13-part 2002 series charting the history of the game: ''History of Football: The Beautiful Game'', narrated by the actor [[Terence Stamp]].&lt;ref&gt;Brown, David (2004). "God and Enchantment of Place: Reclaiming Human Experience". p. 398. Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

The song “[[Wavin' Flag]]” – rapper [[K'naan]]‘s [[Coca-Cola]] promotional anthem for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa – contained the lyric “let’s rejoice in the Beautiful Game.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10342791 ““Rapper K'Naan's Wavin' Flag in World Cup triumph”]. BBC. Retrieved 17 October 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014, [[New Model Army (band)|New Model Army]] released a song called The Beautiful Game in support of the project "Spirit of Football".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theball.tv/2014/2014/01/09/new-model-armys-beautiful-game/ |title=New Model Army’s "Beautiful Game" « The Ball 2014 |publisher=Theball.tv |accessdate=28 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A football [[podcast]] was released with the title "The Beautiful Game".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.SoccerTheBeautifulGame.com |title=The Beautiful Game |publisher=Soccerthebeautifulgame.com |accessdate=28 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terms used==
Sportswear company [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] has referenced the beautiful game in its football commercials. In 1996, a Nike commercial titled "Good vs Evil" was a gladiatorial game set in a [[Roman amphitheatre]] where ten football players from around the world, including [[Eric Cantona]], [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]], [[Paolo Maldini]], [[Luís Figo]], [[Patrick Kluivert]] and [[Jorge Campos]], defend "the beautiful game" against a team of demonic warriors, which culminates in Cantona receiving the ball from Ronaldo, pulling up his shirt collar, and delivering the final line, "Au Revoir", before striking the ball and destroying evil.&lt;ref name="Jackson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jackson|first1=Steven J.|title=Sport, Culture and Advertising: Identities, Commodities and the Politics of Representation|date=10 November 2004|publisher=Routledge|page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nike also uses the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] phrase ''Joga bonito''—meaning "play beautifully", and not "beautiful game", which would be ''Jogo bonito''—as one of its slogans for football products.&lt;ref&gt;Antony Young (2007).

"Rigorous Magic: Communication Ideas and their Application". John Wiley &amp; Sons,&lt;/ref&gt; Nike began using the slogan ''Joga bonito'' in a campaign preceding the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] in an attempt to curb players' behaviours on the pitch. In collaboration with, and promoted by, former international footballer Eric Cantona (who once karate-kicked a fan), Nike released a series of adverts to promote a game that is skillful and dignified, not riddled with theatrics and poor sportsmanship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/jul/18/letfootballeatitself |title=Let football eat itself |last=Kane |first=Pat |date=18 July 2006 |accessdate=22 September 2014 |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The club finished in a  qualifying position during the [[2001 A-Division (Bhutan)|2001]] season. &lt;ref name="RSSSF2001"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesb/bhutan01.html|title=Bhutan 2001|last=Schöggl|first=Hans|last2=King|first2=Ian|date=31 Jul 2003|website=www.rsssf.com|publisher=[[Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation]]|accessdate=27 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were then drawn in Group A along with [[Paro FC|Paro]] and [[Druk Pol FC|Druk Pol]].&lt;ref name="RSSSF2001" /&gt; They managed a win against Paro and then drew with Druk Pol to top the group and qualified for the semifinals.&lt;ref name="RSSSF2001" /&gt; Although they lost to [[Samtse FC|Samtse]] in the semifinals, they beat Druk Pol in the third place final to finish third overall.&lt;ref name="RSSSF2001" /&gt;
Thimpu also participated in [[2002 A-Division (Bhutan)|2002]], although their final position is not known.&lt;ref name="RSSSF2003"/&gt; The only known result involving Thimpu is a 5–1 victory over [[Druk Pol FC|Druk Pol]].&lt;ref name="RSSSF2003" /&gt; In 2015, Thimphu became the first Bhutanese club to hire a foreign coach when they hired [[Fabio Lopez]]. However, the Italian coach resigned from the club without coaching a single game due to difficulty in adjusting to change in life style from his native Italy. The two foreign players signed under coach Lopez remained in the squad for the 2015 season. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Italian coach says ciao|url=http://www.kuenselonline.com/italian-coach-says-ciao/#.VT2WaNKUdA0|accessdate=27 April 2015|publisher=Kuensel|date=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3933">{{about|the baseball statistic|the Matt Christopher novel|Wild Pitch (novel)|the American hip hop record label|Wild Pitch Records}}

In [[baseball]], a '''wild pitch''' (abbreviated '''WP''') is charged against a [[pitcher]] when his [[pitch (baseball)|pitch]] is too high, too short, or too wide of [[home plate]] for the [[catcher]] to control with ordinary effort, thereby allowing a baserunner, perhaps even the batter-runner on an [[uncaught third strike]], to advance.

A wild pitch usually passes the catcher behind home plate, often allowing runners on base an easy chance to advance while the catcher chases the ball down. Sometimes the catcher may block a pitch, and the ball may be nearby, but the catcher has trouble finding the ball, allowing runners to advance.

A closely related statistic is the [[passed ball]]. As with many [[baseball statistics]], whether a pitch that gets away from a catcher is counted as a wild pitch or a passed ball is at the discretion of the [[official scorer]]. The benefit of the doubt is usually given to the catcher if there is uncertainty; therefore, most of these situations are scored as wild pitches. If the pitch was so low as to touch the ground, or so high that the catcher has to jump to get to it, or so wide that the catcher has to lunge for it, it is usually then considered a wild pitch and not a passed ball. Because the pitcher and catcher handle the ball much more than other fielders, certain misplays on pitched balls are defined in Rule 10.13 as wild pitches and passed balls. No [[error (baseball)|error]] shall be charged when a wild pitch or passed ball is scored.

[[File:Cannon Ball Stemmeyer.jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[Bill Stemmyer]] threw an MLB-record 63 wild pitches in one season.]]
A wild pitch may only be scored if one or more runners advance. If the bases are empty, or the catcher retrieves the ball quickly and the runner(s) are unable to advance, a wild pitch is not charged. A scored run due to a wild pitch is recorded as an [[earned run]]. A runner who advances on a wild pitch is not credited with a [[stolen base]] unless he breaks before the pitcher begins his delivery.

==Records==
[[Nolan Ryan]] is the modern-era leader in the category, throwing 277 wild pitches over his 27 years in [[Major League Baseball]]. He also led his [[sports league|league]] in the category in six different seasons. However, the all-time record belongs to [[Tony Mullane]], who threw 343 in the early years of the game from 1881 to 1894. After Ryan's 277, the next pitcher on the list is [[Mickey Welch]] 274, followed by [[Tim Keefe]]'s 233.

[[Bill Stemmyer]] still holds the single-season record, throwing 63 wild pitches in 1886.  Since 1900, however, the highest total in a season has been 30 (by [[Red Ames]] in 1905).  The modern record in a single game is 6, held by three different pitchers.

[[R.A. Dickey]], [[Phil Niekro]], [[Walter Johnson]], and [[Kevin Gregg]] all hold the modern-era regular season single inning wild pitch record with four. [[Rick Ankiel]], however, threw five wild pitches in the 3rd inning of the first game of the [[2000 NLDS]]. [[Bert Cunningham]] of the [[Players' League]] (considered a major league) in 1890 also threw five in an inning. [[Adam Ottavino]] on June 26, 2017 set the MLB record of five runs scored on four wild pitches.

The current active leader (prior to the 2017 season) is [[Félix Hernández]], with 132 wild pitches. The only other active pitchers with 100+ wild pitches are [[John Lackey]] with 114 and [[Tim Lincecum]] with 107.
