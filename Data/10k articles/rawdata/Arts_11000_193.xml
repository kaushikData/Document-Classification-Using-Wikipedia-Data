'''''A Modern Instance''''' is a realistic novel written by [[William Dean Howells]], and published in 1882 by [[James R. Osgood|J. R. Osgood &amp; Co.]] The novel is about the deterioration of a once loving marriage under the influence of capitalistic greed. It is the first American novel by a canonical author to seriously consider divorce as a realistic outcome of marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, Kimberly. "The 'Enormous Fact' of American Life: Divorce in W. D. Howells' 'A Modern Instance.'" ''American Literary Realism'' 36.1 (Fall, 2003): 65-85. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/27747121]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
The novel explores the deterioration of what could have been an otherwise healthy marriage through industrial enterprise and capitalistic greed.  The story chronicles the rise and fall of the romance between Bartley Hubbard and Marcia Gaylord, who migrate from Equity, Maine, to [[Boston, Massachusetts]], following their marriage.  The reader believes at the beginning of the story that their love for each other is unbreakable  , but as the plot advances, more and more troubles arise, alienating the couple.  Soon their entire marriage collapses, inundated with problems from a wide array of areas.  Marcia Hubbard, lost and desolate in the gloom of her husband's abandonment, is offered solace in the comforting touch of her friend Ben Halleck, who secretly is attracted to her.  However, he worries that she may reject him, unable to move on from her previous partner.  The story concludes in a meaningless vortex of isolation representing modern society.  Marcia Hubbard, still attached to Bartley, confines herself to her father's home in Equity, Maine, from which she never leaves.  Bartley, on the other hand, has died.  Ben Halleck stands hesitantly, unable to determine whether or not he should seize the chance and propose to her.

==Significance==
''A Modern Instance'' is regarded as one of the most pivotal works in the career of William Dean Howells; it solidified his reputation as a champion of realism in the United States. Part of that realism is the groundbreaking unapologetic portrait of Bartley Hubbard as an agnostic and which could be modeled on Howells' friend [[Mark Twain]].&lt;ref&gt;Duffy, Myrtle M. "Twain in Howells' 'A Modern Instance.'" ''American Quarterly'' 16.4 A Mark Twain Issue (Winter 1964): 612-614.&lt;/ref&gt; A version of the Bartley Hubbard character appears as a somewhat sleazy journalist interviewing the title character at the beginning of Howells's novel ''[[The Rise of Silas Lapham]]'' (1885).&lt;ref&gt;Casper, Scott E.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2037">"'''A New Refutation of Time'''" ({{lang-es|Nueva refutación del tiempo}}) is an essay by Argentinian writer [[Jorge Luis Borges]] (written between 1944 and 1946) in which he argues that the negations of [[idealism]] may be extended to time. It consists of a prologue and two articles: the first one was written in 1944 and appeared in number 115 of the review ''[[Sur (magazine)|Sur]]''; the second, written in 1946, is a rework of the first. Borges comments that he did not combine the two texts into one, as the reading of two analogous texts might facilitate the comprehension of an indocile subject.

Just as [[George Berkeley]] denies that there is an object existing independently of our perception of it, and [[David Hume]] denies that there is a subject apart from a mere recollection of sensations, Borges tries to demonstrate that there is no time.

He proceeds on the assumption that if "man" is reduced, as according to Hume, to a collection of sensations, a single repeated perception, either in one man's life or in the experience of two different men, suffices to prove that time is a fallacy, since this repetition will destroy its linear sequence.

==History==
Over the last 30 years Ahar carpets have emerged as a recognizable group in the marketplace, and are sold in many parts of Iran outside its town of origin.

==Characteristics==
It is a distinctive [[carpet]] in the [[Heriz]] group of carpets. However the Ahar rug has a more [[linear]] design than the Heriz types. The rug is designed so the [[knot]] counts are higher but no higher than many carpets that have the [[geometric]] design.

==Facts==
The plaintiff, [[Amar Nath Sehgal]] is a renowned artist and sculptor, who created a mural in the lobby of [[Vigyan Bhawan]], Delhi on the direction of appropriate authority. In the year 1957, the Government of India commissioned Mr. Sehgal for creating a bronze mural for Vigyan Bhavan, the most prominent International Convention Hall in Delhi. The Bronze sculpture so commissioned, of about 140&amp;nbsp;ft. span and 40&amp;nbsp;ft. sweep took five years to complete and was placed on the wall of the Lobby in the Convention hall. This embellishment on a national architecture became a part of the Indian art heritage. However, in 1979, the mural was pulled down and consigned to the store room of the Union without notice or permission or authorization of Amarnath. When Mr. Sehgal came to know of this ill treatment, he made representations to the government authorities for restoration of the mural, to no avail. As this act of destruction of the mural as it was improperly handled which cause minor damage to the sculpture. He filed a petition under Section 57 of the Copyright Act, 1957 in the Delhi High Court praying for an apology from the defendants, a permanent injunction on the defendants to restrain them from distorting, mutilating or damaging the plaintiff’s mural and damages to the tune of Rs. 50 lacs.

==Judgment==
The Court termed the Moral rights as the soul of the author’s works. "The author has a right to preserve, protect and nurture his creations through his moral rights. A creative individual is uniquely invested with the power and mystique of original genius, creating a privileged relationship between a creative author and his work."

The Court elucidated on the moral rights that flow from art and literary work .They are Identification right or attribution right, right to dissemination, Right to integrity that is to maintain the purity of work and right to withdraw from the publication of the work .The language of the Section 57 makes it possible to legally protect the cultural heritage of India through the moral rights of the artist. "Intellectual property and knowledge are interconnected. Intellectual property embodies traditional thought and knowledge with value addition. Thus, physical destruction or loss of intellectual property has far reaching social consequence. Knowledge which has grown with it is also lost." Court ruled that moral rights in the work of art acquire the  status of the cultural heritage of the nation and India being a signatory to many conventions , it would be the obligation of the state to protect such work.

Further, Section 57 of the Copyright Act, 1957 includes destruction of a work of art as a ground as it is the extreme form of mutilation and reduces the volume of the author’s creative corpus and affects his reputation prejudicially as being actionable under said section. Further, in relation to the work of an author, subject to the work attaining the status of a modern national treasure, the right would include an action to protect the integrity of the work in relation to the cultural heritage of the nation.

The Court held that the plaintiff has a cause to maintain an action under Section 57 of the Copyright Act, 1957 even though the copyright in the mural stands vested in the defendants. It was further held that the defendants have not only violated the plaintiff's moral right of integrity in the mural but have also violated the integrity of the work in relation to the cultural heritage of the nation. The Court ordered the defendants to return to the plaintiff the remnants of the mural permanently with no rights vesting with the defendants henceforth and ordered the defendants to pay damages with costs.

==Significance of the Decision==
The decision taken by the single bench of the Delhi High Court was instrumental in determining the course of moral rights in the country. It also gave a broad construction to the term moral rights in the country, by not only providing for the right of the author in the case of any distortion, mutilation, modification or other act in relation to the work if such distortion etc. would be prejudicial to his honour or reputation but also ‘right of the author to receive the copyrighted work for the purposes of restoration and sell it’. It included within the moral right of integrity the right to protect an artistic work from outright destruction. 
The interim decision in the case, given by Justice Jaspal Singh, given in favour of the plaintiff, restricted the Indian Government from causing any further loss to the plaintiff by destroying the property. The interim ruling, given in 1992, established two central points about the ambit of moral rights within India. Firstly, that the moral right of integrity under Indian Law can in fact protect an artistic work from outright destruction and secondly, that the Government has a duty of care towards artworks in its possession.
This gave rise to amendments in the Copyright Act in 1994. Even though the purported primary motive of the Government was to bring the Indian Act in conformity with the Berne Convention, the wording of the amendment seemed to be a direct reaction to the interim ruling.  Under the amended Section 57, a legal claim by an author against unauthorized modifications to his work had to establish that the treatment of the work has been prejudicial to his honour or reputation. The revised Section 57 corresponded to Article 6bis of the Berne Convention and also provided that failure to display a work, or to display it in accordance with the wishes of the author, would not qualify as a violation of the author’s moral rights.

In light of this amendment in 1994, an important question that Justice Nandrajog needed to address was that of which law would be applicable to the final ruling, the pre amendment or post amendment Copyright Act. There were compelling arguments for both the sides, as the old provisions of the Copyright Act would apply because they governed the time when the acts of destruction occurred, and when the case was actually filed before the court. On the other hand, he could have said that the post amended provisions should apply because they reflected the currently policy of the Govt. and were actually in force at the time of the judgment. However, he sidestepped the question and chose neither of the paths, arguing that the law must be read to fulfil the higher objective of protecting our cultural heritage, in light of the many international treaties on cultural heritage that India is a signatory to. The artwork in question constituted an ‘outstanding work of art’ and in such cases there is an overriding obligation to protect their integrity, no matter which law is applied.

'''Andreas Pavias''' (born 1440 - died between 1504 and 1512) was a [[Cretan School]] painter and teacher of painting. He was active in [[Heraklion]], [[Crete]] during the second half of the 15th century.

== Life ==
He lived and worked in [[Heraklion]], [[Crete]] (referred to at the time by the Venetians as [[Kingdom of Candia|Candia]]) during the second half of the 15th century. In 1470 there was evidence he was teaching painting to children of nobles. He died between 1504 and 1512.

Like other contemporaries [[Cretan School]] painters painted pictures by following different styles and yielding various iconographic themes in the [[Byzantine]] and "italokritika" works. His works addressed Orthodox and [[Catholic]] doctrine. Main means of expression of an image, an object of reverence looked up positions both in churches and monasteries as well as in residential homes.

== Art and work ==
Considered a teacher, master of art and literature his clientele consisted of wealthy burghers and nobles. The project is small in number but high quality, but the artistic activity was so long it is likely to assume that even latent projects mainly western churches or in private collections.
Archival documents in Venice provide information about the life of the painter in Heraklion, Crete, covering the period from 1470, appearing as a teacher of painting, until 1512 when he is recorded as already dead. The years 1471, 1473 and 1479 he was involved in economic affairs in Heraklion, where he lived. On April 23, 1480 signed as a witness: magister Andreas Pavias, penctor. 1481 rented a house (on Georgio Grin) in Vourgo Candia. In 1482 he signed a contract with Angelo Pitzamanos, to teach his son painting for five years. In the years 1482, 1483, 1486 and 1491 in the name refers to acts of purchase and sale and rental in Heraklion, from which it appears that it had considerable fortune. On October 24, 1492 by Andreas Pavias pentor signed a contract with Manousos Koukou, a resident of Heraklion, to teach his son painting for five years. In 1493 he was again involved in economic affairs in Heraklion. During the period of the years 1493-1505 we know that the Catholic Bishop Giovanni Battista Lagni commissioned an image of the Pieta in Crete, which is currently in [[Rossano]].

On 23 May 1499, he agreed to teach painting for three years to Niccolo da Napoli, and on July 16 of the Andreas Pavias depentor same time signed an apprenticeship contract for four years with John Ploraio. On November 19, 1499 he agreed with Jewish Aquilo (Soulouma) to teach her son not only painting but also letters to eight years.

On 7 May 1500, he requested to be returned a picture of the Nativity Angel painter. In March of the same year again referred to economic matters. On July 26, 1500 handwritten signatures into a covenant said: I am the man (let) the Pavias (we) witness without specifying whether it is the painter. 1502 A. Pavias refers to a document relating to a financial matter and July 8, 1503 signed as a witness, magister Andreas Pavias, together with the painter Marco Amaranto. According to a document of 1504, he had purchased warehouse in Heraklion, the same year the painter, resident Vourgo Candia, promises to give his adoptive daughter Agnes considerable dowry: 500 hyperpyra and 10 gold ducats, which include the value of a house in Candia, gold, silver, gems, clothes, bed and jewelry.

On November 8, 1512 the painter has already died, a document refers to his widow Marietta. In 1514 again referred to as administrator of the estate of the painter's widow, which gives an area of the monastery of the Holy Spirit, she belonged and was outside the Vourgo Candia. The same Maria refers to document 1516.a.

== Influence ==
Andreas Pavias was able to paint in a variety of styles. Created iconographic types -protypa for posterity (Crucifixion -pieta). To fulfill a of the often xaraktirizetai from entoni realistic mood, laid due to an earlier trend, antiklasikou character of Palaiologian painting. In "italokritika" projects follows the Late Gothic style, that realism fits with his artistic temperament.

H installing the student, [[Angelos Pitzamanos]] in Italy is not irrelevant to the trends of the painting of Andreas Pavias his teacher. Adaptation to more modern Italian influences (Bellini), recognized in the art of Nicholas Tzafouri, meticulous miniatures with "lyrical mood," which creates this new iconographic types (Akra Tapeinosi).

The '''Apocalypse Tapestry''' is a large medieval French set of [[tapestries]] commissioned by [[Louis I, Duke of Anjou|Louis I]], the [[Duke of Anjou]], and produced between 1377 and 1382. It depicts the story of the [[Apocalypse]] from the [[Book of Revelation]] by [[Saint John the Divine]] in colourful images, spread over a number of sections that originally totalled 90 scenes. Despite being lost and mistreated in the late 18th century, the tapestry was recovered and restored in the 19th century and is now on display at the [[Chateau d'Angers]]. It is the oldest French medieval tapestry to have survived, and historian Jean Mesqui considers it "one of the great artistic interpretations of the revelation of Saint John, and one of the masterpieces of French cultural heritage".&lt;ref name=MesquiP49&gt;Mesqui, p.49.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Angers Apocalypse Loire Valley 2007a.jpg|thumb|Detail of the tapestry (reverse side), showing an important figure seated under a ceremonial shade]]
The Apocalypse Tapestry was commissioned by Louis I, the Duke of Anjou in the late 1370s.&lt;ref name=MesquiP44&gt;Mesqui, p.44.&lt;/ref&gt; Louis instructed [[Jean Bondol]], a Flemish artist, to draw the sketches that would form the model for the tapestry, which was then woven in Paris between 1377 and 1380 by Nicholas Bataille.&lt;ref&gt;Mesqui, p.44; Klein, p.191.&lt;/ref&gt; The tapestry was probably finally complete by 1382.&lt;ref name=MesquiP44/&gt; It was unusual for a tapestry to be commissioned by a buyer to a specific design in this way.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, p.64.&lt;/ref&gt; It is uncertain how Louis used the tapestry; it was probably intended to be displayed outside, supported by six wooden structures, possibly arranged so as to position the viewer near to the centre of the display, imitating a [[jousting]] field.&lt;ref name=MesquiP50&gt;Mesqui, p.50.&lt;/ref&gt; The tapestry and its theme would have also helped to bolster the status of Louis's [[Valois dynasty]], then involved in the [[Hundred Years' War]] with England.&lt;ref name=MesquiP50/&gt; 

The tapestry shows the story of the Apocalypse from the Book of Revelation by Saint John the Divine.&lt;ref&gt;Bausum, p.70.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 14th century, the Apocalypse was a popular story, focusing on the heroic aspects of the last confrontation between good and evil and featuring battle scenes between angels and beasts.&lt;ref&gt;Aberth, p.186; Benton, p.199.&lt;/ref&gt; Although many of the scenes in the story included destruction and death, the account ended with the triumphant success of good, forming an uplifting story.&lt;ref&gt;Mesqui, p.45.&lt;/ref&gt; Various versions of the Apocalypse story, or cycle, were circulating in Europe at the time and Louis chose to use an Anglo-French Gothic style of the cycle, partially derived from a manuscript he borrowed from his brother, [[Charles V of France]], in 1373.&lt;ref name=MesquiP44/&gt; This version of the Apocalypse had first been recorded in [[Metz]] and then later adapted by English artists; Charles' manuscript had been produced in England around 1250.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, pp.188-189, 191; Aberth, p.190.&lt;/ref&gt; Louis may also have been influenced by a particularly grand tapestry given to Charles by the magistrates of [[Lille]] in 1367.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, p.88.&lt;/ref&gt;

After a century in the ownership of the dukes of Anjou, [[René of Anjou]] bequeathed the tapestry to [[Angers Cathedral]] in 1480 where it remained for many years.&lt;ref name=MesquiP49/&gt; During the [[French Revolution]] the Apocalypse Tapestry was looted and cut up into pieces. The pieces of the tapestry were used for various purposes: as floor mats, to protect local orange trees from frost, to shore up holes in buildings, and to insulate horse stables.&lt;ref&gt;Benton, p.200; Belozerskaya, p.92.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Revolution many medieval tapestries were destroyed, both through neglect and through being melted down to recover the gold and silver used in their designs.&lt;ref&gt;Belozerskaya, p.92.&lt;/ref&gt; The surviving fragments were rediscovered in 1848 and preserved, being returned to the cathedral in 1870.&lt;ref name=MesquiP39&gt;Mesqui, p.39.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The cathedral was not ideal for displaying and preserving the tapestry.&lt;ref name=MesquiP40&gt;Mesqui, p.40.&lt;/ref&gt; The neighbouring Chateau d'Angers had been used as a French military base for many years, but transferred to civilian use after the [[Second World War]]. In 1954 the tapestry was moved there, to be displayed in a new gallery designed by French architect Bernard Vitry.&lt;ref name=MesquiP39/&gt; Between 1990 and 2000 the castle gallery was itself improved, with additional light and ventilation controls installed to protect the tapestry.&lt;ref name=MesquiP40/&gt;

==Description and style==

The tapestry was made in six sections, each {{convert|78|ft|adj=on}} wide by {{convert|20|ft|adj=on}} high, comprising 90 different scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Bausum, p.70.&lt;/ref&gt; Each scene had a red or blue background, alternating between the sections.&lt;ref&gt;Benton, p.199.&lt;/ref&gt; They would have taken considerable effort to produce, with between 50 and 84 man-years of effort required by the weaving teams.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, p.66.&lt;/ref&gt; Only 71 of the original 90 scenes survive today.&lt;ref&gt;Benton, p.200.&lt;/ref&gt; The tapestry is dominated by blue, red and ivory coloured threads, supported by orange and green colours, with gilt and silver woven into the wool and silk.&lt;ref&gt;Bausum, p.70; Mesqui, p.48; Bell, p.66.&lt;/ref&gt; These colours are now considerably faded on the front of the tapestry but were originally similar to the deep and vibrant hues seen on the back of the tapestry panels.&lt;ref&gt;Bausum, p.70; Mesqui, p.48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jean Bondol's weaving follows the Franco-Flemish school of tapestry design, with rich, realist, fluid images placed into a simple, clear structure through the course of the tapestry.&lt;ref&gt;Mesqui, p.48.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the angels and monsters are depicted with considerable energy and colour, the impact reinforced by the sheer size of the tapestry, which allows them to be portrayed slightly larger than life-size.&lt;ref&gt;Benton, p.200; Bausum, p.70.&lt;/ref&gt; Various approaches are taken in the tapestry to interpreting the allegorical language used by St John in his original text; in particular, the tapestry takes an unusual approach to portraying the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse|Fourth Horseman]] of the Apocalypse, [[Death (personification)|Death]]. The depiction of Death in this tapestry follows the style then becoming popular in England: he is represented as a decaying corpse, rather than the more common 14th century portrayal of Death as a conventional, living person.&lt;ref&gt;Aberth, pp.187, 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''art dealer''' is a person or company that buys and sells [[works of art]]. Art dealers' professional associations serve to set high standards for accreditation or membership and to support art exhibitions and shows.&lt;ref name="ADAA"&gt;[http://www.artdealers.org/dnloads/adaa_guide.pdf Collector's Guide to Working with Art Dealers, 45th Anniversary Edition, The Art Dealers Association of America (ADAA), New York] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131008045449/http://www.artdealers.org/dnloads/adaa_guide.pdf |date=October 8, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role==
An art dealer typically seeks out various [[artist]]s to represent, and builds relationships with [[art collector|collectors]] and [[museum]]s whose interests are likely to match the work of the represented artists. Some dealers are able to anticipate [[market trends]], while some prominent dealers may be able to influence the taste of the market. Many dealers specialize in a particular style, period, or region. They often travel internationally, frequenting [[Art exhibition|exhibitions]], [[auctions]], and artists' [[studio]]s looking for good buys, little-known treasures, and exciting new works. When dealers buy works of art, they resell them either in their galleries or directly to collectors. Those who deal in [[contemporary art]] usually exhibit artists' works in their galleries, and take a percentage of the price the works sell for.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=B7u8s0SN7KcC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;dq=art+dealer%27s+percentage+of+the+artwork+price&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=AAbXUoOSH-iy0QXf44DQDA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=art%20dealer's%20percentage%20of%20the%20artwork%20price&amp;f=false Alan D.

==Job requirements==
[[File:Gillis van Tilborgh - A Picture Gallery.jpg|thumb|300px|''A Picture Gallery'' by [[Gillis van Tilborch]], 1660s]]
Art dealers often study the [[history of art]] before entering on their careers. Related careers that often cross-over include [[curator]]s of museums and [[art auction]] firms are industry-related careers.&lt;ref name="ADAA" /&gt; Gallery owners who do not succeed may seek to work for more successful galleries. Others pursue careers as [[art critic]]s, academics, curators of museums or auction houses, or practicing artists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.princetonreview.com/careers.aspx?cid=12 Career: Art Dealer, The Princeton Review]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dealers have to understand the business side of the art world. They keep up with trends in the market and are knowledgeable about the style of art people want to buy. They figure out how much they should pay for a piece and then estimate the resale price. They are also often passionate and knowledgeable about art. Those who deal with contemporary art promote new artists, creating a market for the artists' works and securing financial success for themselves.  The art world is subject to economic booms and bust just like any other market. Art dealers must be economically conscious in order to maintain their livelihoods. The mark ups of art work must be carefully monitored. If prices and profits are too large, then investments may be devalued should an overstock or economic downturn occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://money.cnn.com/2008/04/15/smbusiness/singing_in_rain_art.fsb/index.htm?section=magazines_fsb | author=Cowley, Stacy | title=Amid art boom, dealers brace for a bust | publisher=Fortune Small Business | date=2008-04-16 | accessdate=2008-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To determine an artwork's value, dealers inspect the objects or paintings closely, and compare the fine details with similar pieces. Some dealers with many years of experience learn to identify unsigned works by examining stylistic features such as brush strokes, color, form. They recognize the styles of different periods and individual artists. Often art dealers are able to distinguish authentic works from [[forgeries]] (although even dealers are sometimes fooled).&lt;ref name="ADAA" /&gt;

==Notable art dealers==
[[File:Frans Francken the Younger - A visit to the Art Dealer - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|300px|''A visit to the Art Dealer'' by [[Frans Francken the Younger]], early 1600s]]
* [[Guillam Forchondt|Guillam Forchondt the Elder]] (1608–1678)

A 17th century Flemish Baroque painter and art dealer based in Antwerp.  He established an important art dealing business with international connections in Europe maintained by his extended family. He originally trained as a painter and cabinet maker but built a reputation through his international art business.  His children became art dealers who settled in various cities in Europe such as Venice, Paris, Vienna, Prague, Linz, [[Passau]] and [[Cadiz]] where they supplied an elite clientele with a variety of art objects.  When in the 1670s Flanders suffered a severe economic downturn due mostly to an invasion by the French, Guillam Forchondt and his brother Melchior the Younger became art entrepreneurs by hiring lesser painters to create group projects such as large commissioned copies of famous works or large decorative objects. At one point, the ''Brothers Forchondt'' had 60 painters in service for export to France, Austria, Spain and Portugal.&lt;ref name=RKD&gt;[https://rkd.nl/en/explore/artists/28613 Guilliam Forchondt] in the [[RKD]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Australian Watercolour Institute''' (AWI) is a non-profit membership organization devoted to the advancement of [[watercolour painting]] in [[Australia]]. It was founded in 1923 by six painters in [[Sydney]], and was modeled after the [[Royal Watercolour Society]] and the [[American Watercolor Society]].

==History==
The AWI's first exhibition occurred in 1924. A students' exhibition began in 1930. Until 1974, the AWI met in a variety of places and the annual exhibitions were held in different galleries. In that year, it received a grant enabling the AWI to rent space in a building on Sydney's Sussex Street. A reciprocal exhibition with the American Watercolor Society occurred in 1975, and in 1977, an AWI exhibition toured New Zealand. The international presence expanded to include Mexico City, Mexico; Spain; Vancouver, Canada; Hong Kong; and Korea (4th Asian Grand Watercolour Festival, Busan Biennale).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awi.com.au/AWI%20HISTORY%201..htm |title=AWI History |work=awi.com.au |accessdate=21 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003084821/http://www.awi.com.au/AWI%20HISTORY%201..htm |archivedate=3 October 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The founding members were J. Bennett, [[Alfred James Daplyn]], [[Albert Henry Fullwood]], [[Benjamin Edwin Minns]], [[Martin Stainforth]] and Charles Ephraim Smith Tindall. Invited foundation members included [[Albert Collins (painter)|Albert Collins]], John Eldershaw, [[Hans Heysen]], [[Norman Lindsay]], [[Sydney Long]], [[Arthur Streeton]], John D Moore, [[J. W.

In 2006, ten percent of the membership were recipients of honours awarded by the Australian state ([[Orders, decorations, and medals of Australia|Australia Honours]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mosman.nsw.gov.au/media/index.php?id=102 |title=Australia's eminent watercolourists launch their major anniversary exhibition &amp; book |date=23 November 2006 |work=mosman.nsw.gov.au |accessdate=21 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090919062926/http://www.mosman.nsw.gov.au/media/index.php?id=102 |archivedate=19 September 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Berlin Sculpture-Network''' is a cooperative project between the Antiquities Collection of the [[Berlin State Museums]] and the Institute of [[Classical Archaeology]] at the [[Free University of Berlin]]. It is funded by the [[German Federal Ministry of Education and Research]] within the initiative “Translating Humanities” (“Übersetzungsfunktion von Geisteswissenschaften"). This project aims to reconstruct the spatial, functional and substantive contexts context of ancient sculptures.

The "Berlin Sculpture-Network" project includes a [[database]] of the ancient sculptures in the museums, the associated archival records and current excavation data as well as the collection of all plaster casts in the [[Berlin]] collections. The data will be made available in the online database [[Arachne (archaeological database)|Arachne]].

== Objects ==

Selected research results will be shown in a major exhibition in the [[Pergamon Museum]] in 2011, where an interactive 3D visualization of archaeological monuments of the city of [[Pergamon]] will be introduced to the general public. This virtual [[3D model]] will be a research tool combining the latest research results from the excavations in Pergamon and the reconstruction of the famous city in its surrounding landscape with marble sculptures shown in their original contexts. The exhibition provides a basis for the long-term development of new exhibition concepts for the Berlin [[Antiquities]] collection of the Berlin State Museums.

The "Berlin Sculpture-Network" is a platform for scientific exchange between project members and numerous specialists in and outside of Berlin who research Greek and Roman sculpture and supply scientific contributions to the project.

After a stint as an actor in radio soap operas,&lt;ref name=lambert/&gt; he went to Paris, where he met Daniel Stoenescu (1921&lt;ref name=moma/&gt;-after 1970), son of the Romanian artist [[Eustațiu Stoenescu]], and nephew of [[Liane de Pougy|Princess Ghika]],&lt;ref name=lambert/&gt; who proposed they go into jewelry design together.&lt;ref name=alice&gt;{{cite news|last=Hughes|first=Alice|title=A Woman's New York|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&amp;dat=19660824&amp;id=ArIhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=BJwFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6093,4748557|accessdate=26 November 2012|newspaper=The Reading Eagle|date=24 August 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cadoro, which was launched on [[Fifth Avenue]], became known for inventive jewelry which used [[Chenille stem|chenille]] and plastics alongside more traditional crystals, brushed gold, and enamel for designs which were bought by the likes of [[Wallis Simpson|the Duchess of Windsor]] and [[Barbra Streisand]].&lt;ref name=alice/&gt; In 1969, Cadoro also designed body jewellery in the form of filigree bras and breastplates for wearing with trendy [[see-through clothing]] to enable followers of fashion to preserve their modesty.&lt;ref name=nemy&gt;{{cite news|last=Nemy|first=Enid|title=No Matter What You Call It, Body Jewelry Is Made to Top Nudity |url=http://fultonhistory.com/newspaper%202/Utica%20NY%20Daily%20Observer/Utica%20NY%20Observer%201969%20pdf/Utica%20NY%20Observer%201969%20-%201451.PDF|accessdate=26 November 2012 |newspaper=Utica Observer Dispatch|date=17 February 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cadoro's metal "breastplates" were inspired by a statue of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] found at [[Pompeii]].&lt;ref name=nemy/&gt; The following year in 1970 Brody and Stoenescu were two of a group of costume jewelry designers awarded special [[Coty Awards]], alongside [[Alexis Kirk]], [[Marty Ruza]], [[Clifton Nicholson|Cliff Nicholson]] and the first black recipient of a Coty, [[Bill Smith (jewelry designer)|Bill Smith]].&lt;ref name=mcdowell&gt;{{cite book|last=McDowell|first =Colin |title=McDowell's Directory of Twentieth Century Fashion|publisher=Frederick Muller|year=1984|pages=299–301|isbn =0-584-11070-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Banik|first=Sheila|title=Bill Smith: The Maverick|journal=Black Enterprise |date=July 1981 |pages=36 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rqJ_ZvaSPggC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;lpg=PA36&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cadoro designs for that year were Indian-themed, following on from an African and [[Pre-Columbian art]]-inspired collection in polished wood and carved gold and silver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lambert|first=Eleanor|title=Ethnic Theme Monopolises Front Seat in Fashion|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2506&amp;dat=19700919&amp;id=45lIAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=vgkNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4164,4626742|accessdate=29 November 2012|newspaper=The News and Courier|date=19 September 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Carol Es''' (born {{Birth date|1968|7|20|mf=yes}}) is a self-taught visual artist, writer, musician (drummer), and [[book artist]] who lives and works in [[Los Angeles, California]]. She has written articles for [[Coagula Art Journal]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esart.com/news/press/coagula-botello.pdf|title=Rochelle Botello, Down by the River on Tenterhooks|publisher=Coagula Art Journal, Issue #91, March 2008|accessdate=2015-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Huffington Post]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/carol-es/a-snow-white-story-on-its-head_b_3263641.html|title=A Snow White Story Turned on Its Head|publisher=Huffington Post Arts Section|accessdate=2013-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a musician, she has played for 20 years as an R&amp;B drummer touring and recording drums with various artists. She played drums on Rickie Lee Jones' [[Ghostyhead]] album in 1997.

Her Artists' books are featured in the [[J. Paul Getty Trust]] Research Institute Library in Los Angeles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esart.com/news/press/dailybreeze-caroles.pdf|title=A Pattern of Creativity by Josh Grossberg|publisher=Daily Breeze, 5 March 2006|accessdate=2015-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[National Museum of Women in the Arts]], [[Brooklyn Museum]], [[Centre Georges Pompidou]] in Paris, and also in prominent university collections such as the Arthur and Mata Jaffe Collection at [[Florida Atlantic University Library]], UC Irvine, [[Otis College of Art &amp; Design]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.otis.edu/press-release/binding-desire-unfolding-artists-books|title=Binding Desire: UNFOLDING ARTISTS BOOKS|publisher=AN EXHIBITION AT BEN MALTZ GALLERY from the Millard Sheets Library Special Collections, 2014.|accessdate=2015-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[UCLA Library]] Special Collections.

As a visual artist, Es is known for creating personal narratives. She has used past experience as the fuel for her subject matter, transforming a broken history into a positive and spiritual resolve. Candid experiences are laid bare and forged directly into her paintings, drawings, soft sculptures, mixed media installations, and handmade books.[http://esart.com/] In 2015, Los Angeles Art Critic, [[Peter Frank (art critic)|Peter Frank]] wrote: "An autodidact, Es has long embodied her interests and her struggles - in painted and drawn and even sculpted and sewn imagery - darkly whimsical forms and figures whose deft fluidity have the eye "going for a walk with a line" (in the words of [[Paul Klee]], who strongly influenced Es) but aggressively trouble the mind."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artillerymag.com/carol-es/|title=Carol Es - Shulamit Gallery / Los Angeles|work=Artillery|date=July 2015|accessdate=17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Los Angeles art critic, A. Moret wrote: "The viewer activates the past as Es rewrites the story by mending a broken history and constructing a new narrative. Carol Es has transformed the past that once plagued her existence into her raison d’ être.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moret|first=A|url=http://whitehotmagazine.com/articles/carol-es-george-billis-gallery/2151|title=Carol Es @ George Billis Gallery|work=Whittehot magazine|date=November 2010|accessdate=17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Castle of Verzuolo''' ({{lang-it|Castello di Verzuolo}}) is a medieval [[castle]] in the [[Piedmont]] region of Italy, near [[Verzuolo]], [[Province of Cuneo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= |first= |year= |title=Historiae patriae Monumenta:|publisher=Carlo Baudi di Vesme|publication-place= |page= |url=https://books.google.com.ar/books?id=xs5QAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA2087|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located around {{convert|6|km|mi}} from the city of [[Saluzzo]] and {{convert|84|km|mi}} from [[Turin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= |first= |year= |title=A General Gazetteer ...

== History ==
The castle was originally built in the 11th century and was modified in its original structure by order of [[Frederick II, Marquess of Saluzzo|Frederick II]] in 1377.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= |first= |year= |title=Dizionario geografico-storico-statistico-commerciale degli stati del Redi ..|publisher=Goffredo Casalis|publication-place= |page= |url=https://books.google.com.ar/books?id=EQhTAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA56|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The successors of Frederick II continued modifying the structure of the building, turning it into the main fortress of the [[Marquisate of Saluzzo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= |first= |year= |title=Storia di Saluzzo dal XVe al XIXe secolo, Volume 1|publisher=Carlo Fedele Savio|publication-place= |page= |url=https://books.google.com.ar/books?id=o_M-AQAAMAAJ|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1528, [[Giovanni Ludovico, Marquess of Saluzzo]], was imprisoned in the castle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= |first= |year= |title=Dizionario di erudizione storico|publisher=Italy|publication-place= |page= |url=https://books.google.com.ar/books?id=qKOu__OaucYC&amp;pg=PA308|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1600 the castle facade was renovated, changing its aspect from that of a military fortress to that of a luxury mansion, and it has since been used as a summer residence of illustrious personalities, including [[Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy]], and [[Giambattista Bodoni]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= |first= |year= |title=Il Castello|publisher=Comune di Verzuolo|publication-place= |page= |url=http://www.comune.verzuolo.cn.it/archivio/pagine/Il_Borgo_medievale.asp|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 June 1916, valuable documents referring to the history of Piedmont were lost in the collapse of one of the castle's two towers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= |first= |year= |title=I giornali dei viaggi|publisher=Giorgio Gallesio, Enrico Baldini|publication-place= |page= |url=https://books.google.com.ar/books?id=A58fAQAAIAAJ|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and release==
During the [[Taking Chances World Tour]], Dion played concerts in five continents, 25 countries and 93 cities, selling more than three million tickets.&lt;ref name="pr"&gt;{{cite web|title=Celine: Through the Eyes of the World, an expanded DVD edition of the acclaimed documentary &amp; Taking Chances World Tour: The Concert, a new live DVD/CD, available in May|publisher=celinedion.com|url=http://www.celinedion.com/ca/press/celine-through-eyes-world-expanded-dvd-edition-acclaimed-documentary-taking-chances-world-tour|date=6 April 2010|accessdate=6 April 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120814064625/http://www.celinedion.com/ca/press/celine-through-eyes-world-expanded-dvd-edition-acclaimed-documentary-taking-chances-world-tour|archivedate=14 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Running from February 2008 through February 2009, featuring both Anglophone and Francophone setlists, the tour broke attendance and box office records at venues around the world.&lt;ref name="pr"/&gt; In December 2009, [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] announced that their division, The Hot Ticket will bring a special motion picture entitled ''Celine: Through the Eyes of the World'' to theaters.&lt;ref name="press"&gt;{{cite web|title=Celine Dion Entertains the World in The Hot Ticket's Presentation of 'Celine: Through the Eyes of the World' |publisher=[[PR Newswire]]|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/celine-dion-entertains-the-world-in-the-hot-tickets-presentation-of-celine-through-the-eyes-of-the-world-78432527.html|date=3 December 2009|accessdate=3 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fr.canoe.ca/divertissement/cinema/nouvelles/2010/02/05/12759166-jdm.html|title=Céline à l'état pur|author=Michelle Coudé-Lord|publisher=[[Canoe.ca]]|date=5 February 2010|accessdate=5 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intercutting concert performances of Dion's biggest hits with behind-the-scenes footage, the documentary depicts the singer's life during the Taking Chances World Tour, giving fans the unique opportunity to follow Dion everywhere, on stage, backstage, and enjoying free time with her family.&lt;ref name="press"/&gt; It was filmed by Jean Lamoureux and directed by Stéphane Laporte.&lt;ref name="press"/&gt; According to Dion herself, "This was an amazing world tour, but there's a lot more than just concert footage on this film. I let the cameras follow me everywhere. There are a lot of ups and downs, and it's very personal... and it's definitely the most intimate journey that I've ever shared with my fans."&lt;ref name="press"/&gt;

Dion promoted ''Celine: Through the Eyes of the World'' on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' on 10 February 2010 and ''[[Larry King Live]]'' on 15 February 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Celine on The Oprah Show Tomorrow!|publisher=celinedion.com|url=http://www.celinedion.com/ca/node/95460|date=9 February 2010|accessdate=9 February 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140625203046/http://www.celinedion.com/ca/node/95460|archivedate=25 June 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Celine on Larry King Live|publisher=celinedion.com|url=http://www.celinedion.com/ca/node/95719|date=14 February 2010|accessdate=14 February 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129211658/http://www.celinedion.com/ca/node/95719|archivedate=29 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also attended the [[Miami]] premiere of the movie on 16 February 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canoe.com/divertissement/cinema/nouvelles/2010/02/11/12847196-jdm.html|title=Dans l'intimité de la diva|author=Michelle Coudé-Lord|publisher=Canoe.ca|date=11 February 2010|accessdate=11 February 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607093717/http://www.canoe.com/divertissement/cinema/nouvelles/2010/02/11/12847196-jdm.html#|archive-date=7 June 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Premiere of "Celine: Through The Eyes of the World" - Regal South Beach Cinema|publisher=celinedion.com|url=http://www.celinedion.com/ca/gallery/premiere-celine-through-eyes-world-regal-south-beach-cinema|date=16 February 2010|accessdate=16 February 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129211658/http://www.celinedion.com/ca/gallery/premiere-celine-through-eyes-world-regal-south-beach-cinema|archivedate=29 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting on 17 February 2010 and for eight days only, fans could enjoy a very limited engagement featured in movie theatres across North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Celine : Through the Eyes of the World' – New Release Details!|publisher=celinedion.com|url=http://www.celinedion.com/ca/node/94939|date=8 January 2010|accessdate=8 January 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129211658/http://www.celinedion.com/ca/node/94939|archivedate=29 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Sony Pictures Entertainment released ''Celine: Through the Eyes of the World'' in movie theatres in Australia for one week only (18–24 February 2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Celine: Through The Eyes of the World – Australian Release Details|publisher=celinedion.com|url=http://www.celinedion.com/ca/node/95339|date=27 January 2010|accessdate=27 January 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129211658/http://www.celinedion.com/ca/node/95339|archivedate=29 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was also shown in [[Vue Cinemas|Vue]], [[Odeon Cinemas|Odeon]] and [[Cineworld]] cinemas across the United Kingdom in late February 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Celine: Through the Eyes of the World – UK Release Details|publisher=celinedion.com|url=http://www.celinedion.com/ca/node/95984|date=20 February 2010|accessdate=20 February 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129211658/http://www.celinedion.com/ca/node/95984|archivedate=29 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Review aggregation website [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[weighted mean]] rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, gave the film an average score of 52 based on 4 reviews, which indicates "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref name=metacritic&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/celine-through-the-eyes-of-the-world|title=Celine: Through the Eyes of the World|publisher=[[Metacritic]].

She stated that "Celine Dion may be responsible for some of the smoothest, most syrupy pop recordings in recent decades, but in concert, she is a pit bull." &lt;ref name=usa&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/reviews/2010-02-18-celineworld18_ST_N.htm|title=Celine Dion is a dynamo in 'Eyes of World' docu-musical|date=17 February 2010|author=Elysa Gardner|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=17 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lauren Carter from ''[[Boston Herald]]'' gave the film A-. According to her "the film succeeds because it lets us in on Celine the person as much as Celine the performer."&lt;ref name=boston&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bostonherald.com/entertainment/movies/reviews/view/20100219dion_reveals_her_world_offstage/srvc=home&amp;position=also|title=Dion reveals her 'World' offstage|date=19 February 2010|author=Lauren Carter|work=[[Boston Herald]]|accessdate=19 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Ouzounian of ''[[Toronto Star]]'' gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars and said that "it's more than just a collection of the Quebec singer's greatest hits performed in concert, although there's enough high-energy, nicely shot musical numbers to gladden the heart of any Dionista." Also "what makes this a real surprise and something that should strike a chord with those who aren't necessarily Dion fans, is that it also takes you inside: inside the universe of a superstar tour as it careens around the world, as well as inside the mind, heart and – in one unforgettable scene – even the larynx of Dion." In the end, "if you like Dion, the singer, then you will love ''Celine: Through the Eyes of the World''. But even if you don't, you can't help but be impressed by this fascinating portrait of a superstar trying very hard to keep her feet on earth while her career keeps soaring ever upward."&lt;ref name=toronto&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/music/article/766616--celine-through-the-eyes-of-the-world-gets-deep-with-the-diva|title=Céline: Through The Eyes Of The World gets deep with the diva|date=18 February 2010|author=Richard Ouzounian|work=[[Toronto Star]]|accessdate=18 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michelle Coude-Lord from ''[[Toronto Sun]]'' gave it 3.5 out of 5 stars and wrote that "the movie is a must-see." It "shows Celine as being human, and perfectly depicts the bond between her and [[René Angélil|Angélil]]. It connects the public with Dion's words, successes, career heights and her superstardom."

Linda Cook of ''[[Quad-City Times]]'' gave the film 3 out of 4 stars and said that she "was pleasantly surprised when she realized the movie had her hooked about 15 minutes into the film". She also said that "it's mesmerizing to see audiences all over the world singing along in French and/or English, and to see the moment when she was presented with the [[Legion of Honour]]." She "enjoyed watching as Celine and her family became tourists in the countries she visited, whether she was taking in the sounds and sights of Africa or Australia.

[[File:SaintCynog1.png|thumb|Drawing of a [[Church Building|Church]] [[Stained glass|Stained Glass window]] depicting Saint Cynog.]]'''Cynog son of [[Brychan]]''' ({{lang-cy|Cynog ap Brychan}}; born c. 434), better known as '''Saint&amp;nbsp;Cynog''' ({{lang-owl|Kennauc}}), was an early [[Welsh people|Welsh]] saint and martyr. His shrine is at [[Merthyr Cynog]] in [[Wales]] and his feast day is observed on 7&lt;ref&gt;Moran, Patrick. ''[https://archive.org/details/irishsaints00morauoft Irish Saints in Great Britain]''. Gill (Dublin), 1879. Accessed 9 Feb 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; or 9&lt;ref&gt;Tristam, Simon K. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=mKRMFO19_5gC&amp;pg=PA425 Exciting Holiness]''. Hymns Ancient and Modern Ltd, 2007. Accessed 9 Feb 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; October.

Cynog was reputedly a son of [[Brychan]], a powerful [[Welsh (people)|Welsh]] prince of the [[Sub-Roman Britain|British Dark Ages]]. Cynog's mother was reputedly [[Benadulved]], daughter of [[Benadyl]], a prince of [[Kingdom of Powys|Powys]], whom Brychan seduced while a hostage at the court of her father.&lt;ref name="visionofbritain.org.uk"&gt;[http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/text/chap_page.jsp;jsessionid=C38A36A0500F1F9C3F762D6E4846D204?t_id=Cambrensis_Tour&amp;c_id=4 Vision of Britain: Gerald of Wales, The Itinerary of Archbishop Baldwin through Wales, Chapter 2]&lt;/ref&gt;

He is said to have been murdered on the mountain called ''the Van'' ([[Bannau Brycheiniog]]). His relics are housed at [[Merthyr Cynog]].

In 1188, [[Gerald of Wales]] wrote that there still existed a certain relic purported to be a royal [[torc]] that had once been worn by Cynog, presumably as an item of [[Crown Jewels|royal regalia]]. Gerald encountered this relic while travelling through [[Brycheiniog]]. He wrote of this relic:

{{quote|Moreover I must not be silent concerning the collar which they call St. Canauc's; for it is most like to gold in weight, nature, and colour; it is in four pieces wrought round, joined together artificially, and clefted as it were in the middle, with a dog's head, the teeth standing outward; it is esteemed by the inhabitants so powerful a relic, that no man dares swear falsely when it is laid before him: it bears the marks of some severe blows, as if made with an iron hammer; for a certain man, as it is said, endeavouring to break the collar for the sake of the gold, experienced the divine vengeance, was deprived of his eyesight, and lingered the remainder of his days in darkness.|Gerald of Wales|The Itinerary of Archbishop Baldwin through Wales, Chapter II &lt;ref name="visionofbritain.org.uk"/&gt;}}

The detailed description, which, though not easy to interpret, points, in the opinion of [[T. D. Kendrick|Sir T. D. Kendrick]], to its probably being Welsh or Irish work of the Viking period, i.e. the 10th or the 11th century.&lt;ref name=lloyd/&gt;

He is chiefly commemorated in Brycheiniog, where Defynnog, [[Ystradgynlais]], Penderyn, Battle, Llangynog, and  Merthyr Cynog, are all named after him, the last being reputed his place of burial.&lt;ref name=lloyd&gt;[http://wbo.llgc.org.uk/en/s-CYNO-APB-0500.html Lloyd, John Edward.

==Film industry==
In the [[film industry]], it is an agreement between a writer and an independent producer (production company) or an independent producer and a film studio in which the potential buyer (producer or studio) of a not-yet-written script or [[development (film)|in-development]] movie or television project pays a development fee to the writer or producer for the right to have the first look at the new material before others in the industry get to see it, and at that time make an offer to purchase or distribute or adhere to purchase or distribution terms already stated in the agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Konigsberg, Ira |year=1997 |title=The Complete Film Dictionary |publisher=Penguin |location=New York |isbn=0-670-10009-9}} "First look deal.

[[File:Gmaciunas-manifesto.jpg|250px|thumb|''Fluxus Manifesto'', 1963, by [[George Maciunas]]]]
'''Fluxus''' was an international, interdisciplinary community of artists, composers, designers and poets during the 1960s and 1970s who engaged in experimental art performances which emphasized the artistic process over the finished product.&lt;ref&gt;''Nationalencyclopedin'' (''Swedish National Encyclopedia''). 2016. "Fluxus." Accessible at: http://www.ne.se/uppslagsverk/encyclopedi/lång/fluxus Accessed September 11, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wainwright, Lisa S. 2016. "Fluxus." ''Britannica Academic'' (Encyclopedia Britannica Online).&lt;/ref&gt; Fluxus is known for experimental contributions to different artistic media and disciplines and for generating new art forms. These art forms include [[intermedia]], a term coined by Fluxus artist [[Dick Higgins]];&lt;ref&gt;Higgins, Dick. 1966. "Intermedia." ''Something Else Newsletter''.

Barcelona: Fundacio Joan Miro.&lt;/ref&gt; Dutch gallerist and art critic Harry Ruhé describes Fluxus as "the most radical and experimental art movement of the sixties."&lt;ref name="Ruhé, Harry 1979"&gt;Ruhé, Harry. 1979. ''Fluxus, the Most Radical and Experimental Art Movement of the Sixties'' Amsterdam: Editions Galerie A.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ruhé, Harry. 1999. "Introduction." ''25 Fluxus Stories'' Amsterdam: Tuja Books, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fluxus participants included "artists, composers, designers, and architects, as well as economists, mathematicians, ballet dancers, chefs, and even a would-be theologian.&lt;ref name="Friedman, Ken 2011. p.35"&gt;Friedman, Ken. 2011. "Fluxus: A Laboratory of Ideas." ''Fluxus and the Essential Qualities of Life''. Jacquelynne Baas, editor. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, p.35.&lt;/ref&gt; Equally significant, they represented nations across many continents, predominantly Asia, Europe, and North America.&lt;ref name="Friedman, Ken 2011. p.35"/&gt;

They produced performance "events," which included enactments of scores, "[[Neo-Dada]]" [[noise music]], and time-based works, as well as [[concrete poetry]], [[visual art]], [[urban planning]], architecture, design, literature, and publishing. Many Fluxus artists share anti-commercial and [[anti-art]] sensibilities. Fluxus is sometimes described as "intermedia". The ideas and practices of composer [[John Cage]] heavily influenced Fluxus. Especially, his notions that one should embark on an artwork without a conception of its end, and his understanding of the work as a site of interaction between artist and audience. The process of creating was privileged over the finished product.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Fluxus Movement, Artists and Major Works|url = http://www.theartstory.org/movement-fluxus.htm|accessdate = 2015-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another notable influence were [[Marcel Duchamp|the readymades of Marcel Duchamp]], a French artist who was active in [[Dada]] (1916 – c. 1922). [[George Maciunas]], largely considered to be the founder of this fluid movement, coined the name Fluxus in 1961 to title a proposed magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = In the Spirit of Fluxus|last = Armstrong|first = Elizabeth|publisher = The Occasion of the Exhibition|year = 1993|isbn =9780935640403|location = Minneapolis|pages = 24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many artists of the 1960s took part in Fluxus activities, including [[Joseph Beuys]], [[George Brecht]], [[Robert Filliou]], [[Al Hansen]], [[Dick Higgins]], [[Bengt af Klintberg]], [[Alison Knowles]], Addi Køpcke, [[Yoko Ono]], [[Nam June Paik]], [[Ben Patterson]], [[Daniel Spoerri]], and [[Wolf Vostell]]. Not only were they a diverse community of collaborators who influenced each other, they were also, largely, friends. They collectively had what were, at the time, radical ideas about art and the role of art in society.&lt;ref&gt;Zurbrugg, Nicholas. 1990. “A Spirit of Large Goals.” – Dada and Fluxus at Two Speeds. ''Fluxus!'' Nicholas Zurbrugg, Francesco Conz, and Nicholas Tsoutas, eds. Brisbane, Australia: Institute of Modern Art, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; The intersecting communities within Fluxus and the way that Fluxus developed in overlapping stages meant that participants each had very different ideas about what Fluxus was.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Owen F. 1998. ''Fluxus: The History of an Attitude''. San Diego: San Diego State University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Fluxus founder George Maciunas proposed a well known manifesto, but few considered Fluxus to be a true movement,&lt;ref&gt;Higgins, Dick. 1992. "Fluxus: Theory and Reception." ''Lund Art Press'', Vol II, No 2, pp. 25–46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Higgins, Dick. 1998. "Fluxus: Theory and Reception." ''The Fluxus Reader'', Ken Friedman, ed. Chichester, West Sussex: Wiley Academy Editions, pp. 218–236.&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore the manifesto was not largely adopted. Instead, a series of festivals in Wiesbaden, Copenhagen, Stockholm, Amsterdam, London, and New York, gave rise to a loose but robust community with many similar beliefs. In keeping with the reputation Fluxus earned as a forum of experimentation,&lt;ref name="Ruhé, Harry 1979"/&gt; some Fluxus artists came to describe Fluxus as a laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Ken. 2011. “Fluxus: A Laboratory of Ideas.” ''Fluxus and the Essential Qualities of Life''.

==History to 1965==

===Origins===
[[File:FluxYearBox2.jpg|280px|thumb|''Flux Year Box 2'', c.1967, a Flux box edited and produced by George Maciunas, containing works by many early Fluxus artists]] 
The origins of Fluxus lie in many of the concepts explored by composer [[John Cage]] in his [[experimental music]] of the 1930s through the 1960s. After attending courses on Zen Buddhism taught by D. T. Suzuki, Cage taught a series of classes in experimental composition from 1957 to 1959 at the [[New School for Social Research]] in New York City. These classes explored the notions of chance and [[Indeterminacy in music|indeterminacy]] in art, using music scores as a basis for compositions that could be performed in potentially infinite ways. Some of the artists and musicians who became involved in Fluxus, including [[Jackson Mac Low]], [[La Monte Young]], [[George Brecht]], [[Al Hansen]], and [[Dick Higgins]] attended Cage's classes.&lt;ref&gt;Maciunas himself joined the class in 1959–60, and was taught by Maxfield&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George Brecht; A Heterospective, Walther König, p28.{{Full citation needed|date=April 2013}}&lt;!--What the heck is this, a book, an exhibition catalog, a journal or newspaper article?--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A major influence is found in the work of [[Marcel Duchamp]].&lt;ref name="MOMA"&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/theme.php?theme_id=10457 Michael Corris, MoMA, Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; Also of importance was ''Dada Poets and Painters'', edited by Robert Motherwell, a book of translations of Dada texts that was widely read by members of Fluxus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Dada Painters And Poets: An Anthology|last=Motherwell|first=Robert and Jean Arp|publisher=Belknap Press Of Harvard University Press|year=1989|isbn=|location=Cambridge, Mass|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term [[anti-art]], a precursor to [[Dada]], was coined by Duchamp around 1913, when he created his first readymades from [[found object]]s (ordinary objects found or purchased and declared art).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/a/anti-art Anti-art, Art that challenges the existing accepted definitions of art, Tate]&lt;/ref&gt; Indifferently chosen, [[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|readymades]] and altered readymades challenged the notion of art as an inherently optical experience, dependent on academic art skills. The most famous example is Duchamp's infamous altered readymade ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' (1917), a work which he signed "R. Mutt." While taking refuge from WWI in New York, in 1915 Duchamp formed a Dada group with [[Francis Picabia]] and American artist [[Man Ray]]. Other key members included [[Arthur Cravan|Arthur Craven]], [[Florine Stettheimer]], and the Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven, credited by some with proposing the idea for [[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]] to Duchamp.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/06/arts/design/06dada.html?_r=1|title=New York Times|last=Cotter|first=Holland|date=|work=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1916 these artists, especially Duchamp, Man Ray, and Picabia, became the center for radical anti-art activities in New York City. Their artworks would inform Fluxus and [[conceptual art]] in general.&lt;ref name="MOMA" /&gt; In the late 1950s and very early 1960s, Fluxus and contemporaneous groups or movements, including [[Happenings]], [[Nouveau réalisme]], [[mail art]], and [[performance art|action art]] in Japan, Austria, and other international locations were, often placed under the rubric of [[Neo-Dada]]".&lt;ref&gt;Hapgood, Susan and Rittner, Jennifer. "Neo-Dada: Redefining Art, 1958–1962" Performing Arts Journal, Vol. 17, No. 1 (Jan., 1995), pp. 63–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of other contemporary events are credited as either anticipating Fluxus or as constituting proto-Fluxus events.&lt;ref name="MOMA" /&gt; The most commonly cited include the series of Chambers Street loft concerts, in New York, curated by Yoko Ono and La Monte Young in 1961, featuring pieces by Yoko Ono, J[[Jackson Mac Low|ackson MacLow]], [[Joseph Byrd]], and [[Henry Flynt]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jeclique.com/onoweb/loftono.html Performances at Yoko Ono's Chambers Street Loft]&lt;/ref&gt; the month-long ''Yam'' festival held in upstate New York by George Brecht and [[Robert Watts (artist)|Robert Watts]] in May 1963 with [[Ray Johnson]] and [[Allan Kaprow]] (the culmination of a year's worth of [[Mail Art]] pieces);&lt;ref name="MOMA" /&gt; and a series of concerts held in [[Mary Bauermeister]]'s studio, Cologne, 1960–61, featuring [[Nam June Paik]] and John Cage among many others. It was at one of these events in 1960, during his Etude pour Piano, that Paik leapt into the audience and cut John Cage's tie off, ran out of the concert hall, and then phoned the hall's organisers to announce the piece had ended.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/exhibition/nam-june-paik/nam-june-paik-room-guide/nam-june-paik-section-2 Tate, Nam June Paik, Fluxus, Performance, Participation]&lt;/ref&gt; As one of the movement's founders, Dick Higgins, stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Fluxus started with the work, and then came together, applying the name Fluxus to work which already existed. It was as if it started in the middle of the situation, rather than at the beginning.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9feLztCuQ18 Dick Higgins on Fluxus], interviewed 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amongst the earliest pieces that would later be published by Fluxus were Brecht's event scores, the earliest of which dated from around 1958/9, and works such as Valoche, which had originally been exhibited in Brecht's solo show 'Toward's Events' at 1959.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The American musician and artist La Monte Young had been enlisted to guest-edit an issue of a literary journal, ''Beatitude East'', and asked George Maciunas, a trained graphic designer, for help with the layout. Maciunas supplied the paper, design, and some money for publishing the anthology which contained the work of a more or less arbitrary group of New York [[avant-garde]] artists from that time. By the end of 1961 before ''[[An Anthology of Chance Operations]]''&lt;ref&gt;full title, 'An Anthology of chance operations concept art anti-art indeterminacy improvisation meaningless work natural disasters plans of action stories diagrams Music poetry essays dance constructions mathematics compositions'&lt;/ref&gt; was completed (it was finally published in 1963 by Mac Low and Young), Maciunas had moved to Germany to escape his creditors and work for the U.S. military.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artinamericamagazine.com/news-features/magazine/design-in-flux/. Chamberlain, Colby. "Design in Flux" Art In America. 1 October 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; From there, he continued his contact with the New York artists and with artists like Benjamin Patterson, whom he met in Europe, by September 1962 was joined by Dick Higgins and Alison Knowles, who traveled to Europe to help him promote a second planned publication to be called "Fluxus", the first of a series of "yearbooks" of artists' works.

===Early Fluxus and Neo-Dada===
Lithuanian-born [[George Maciunas]] coined the name Fluxus for art produced by a range of artists with a shared sensibility as an attempt to 'fuse... cultural, social, &amp; political revolutionaries into [a] united front and action'.&lt;ref&gt;Fluxus Manifesto, 1963, by George Maciunas&lt;/ref&gt; After fleeing Lithuania at the end of [[World War II]], his family settled in New York, where he first met a group of avant-garde artists and musicians centered around John Cage and La Monte Young. After opening a short-lived art gallery on [[Madison Avenue]], which showed work by Higgins, Yoko Ono, [[Jonas Mekas]], [[Ray Johnson]], Flynt and Young, Maciunas moved to [[Wiesbaden]], West Germany, having taken a job as a graphic designer with the [[US Air Force]] in late 1961&lt;ref&gt;''Fluxus Codex'', Hendricks, p22&lt;/ref&gt; after the gallery had gone bust. Maciunas first publicly coined the term ''Fluxus'' (meaning 'to flow') in a 'brochure prospectus' that he distributed to the audience at a festival he had organized, called ''Aprés Cage; Kleinen Sommerfest'' (After Cage; a Small Summer Festival), in [[Wuppertal]], West Germany, 9 June 1962.&lt;ref&gt;''Fluxus Codex'', Hendricks, p91&lt;/ref&gt;

Maciunas was an avid art historian, and initially referred to fluxus as 'neo-dadaism' or 'renewed dadaism'.&lt;ref&gt;Maciunas, ''Fluxus Prospectus'', quoted in ''Fluxus Codex'', Hendricks, p23&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote a number of letters to [[Raoul Hausmann]], an original [[dada]]ist, outlining his ideas. Hausmann discouraged the use of the term;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I note with much pleasure what you said about German neodadaists—but I think even the Americans should not use the term "neodadaism" because neo means nothing and -ism is old-fashioned. Why not simply "Fluxus"? It seems to me much better, because it's new, and dada is historic.&lt;ref&gt;Raoul Hausmann, quoted in ''Mr. Fluxus'', Williams andNoel, p40. Letter dated 4 November 1962, according to The Dream of Fluxus, n.47, p65&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
As part of the festival, Maciunas wrote a lecture, entitled 'Neo-Dada in the United States'.&lt;ref&gt;The lecture was actually given, in German, by Artus C Caspari&lt;/ref&gt; After an attempt to define 'Concretist Neo-Dada' art, he explained that Fluxus was opposed to the exclusion of the everyday from art. Using 'anti-art and artistic banalities', Fluxus would fight the 'traditional artificialities of art'.&lt;ref name=fluxus62&gt;The Dream of Fluxus, Kellein, p62&lt;/ref&gt; The lecture ended with the declaration;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Anti-art is life, is nature, is true reality—it is one and all.&lt;ref name=fluxus62/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===European festivals and the Fluxkits===
[[File:PianoActivities.jpg|280px|left|thumb|''Piano Activities'', by Philip Corner, as performed in Wiesbaden, 1962, by (l-r) Emmett Williams, Wolf Vostell, Nam June Paik, Dick Higgins, Benjamin Patterson and George Maciunas]]
In 1962, Maciunas, Higgins and Knowles, traveled to Europe to promote the planned Fluxus publication with concerts of 
antique musical instruments.  With the help of a group of artists including [[Joseph Beuys]] and [[Wolf Vostell]], Maciunas eventually organised a series of ''Fluxfests'' across Western Europe. Starting with 14 concerts between 1 and 23 September 1962, at [[Wiesbaden]], these ''Fluxfests'' presented work by musicians such as John Cage, [[Ligeti]], [[Penderecki]], [[Terry Riley]] and [[Brion Gysin]] alongside [[Performance art|performance]] pieces written by Higgins, Knowles, George Brecht and [[Nam June Paik]], Benjamin Patterson, [[Robert Filliou]], and [[Emmett Williams]], amongst many others. One performance in particular, ''Piano Activities'' by [[Philip Corner]], became notorious by challenging the important status of the piano in post-war German homes.

The score—which asks for any number of performers to, among other things, "play", "pluck or tap", "scratch or rub", "drop objects" on, "act on strings with", "strike soundboard, pins, lid or drag various kinds of objects across them" and "act in any way on underside of piano"&lt;ref&gt;[http://marcusboon.com/node/23 Marcus Boon] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101102022741/http://marcusboon.com/node/23 |date=2 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;—resulted in the total destruction of a piano when performed by Maciunas, Higgins and others at Wiesbaden. The performance was considered scandalous enough to be shown on German television four times, with the introduction "The lunatics have escaped!"&lt;ref&gt;"Die Irren Sind Los" quoted in The Dream Of Fluxus, Kellein, p65.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;At the end we did Corner's ''Piano Activities'' not according to his instructions since we systematically destroyed a piano which I bought for $5 and had to have it all cut up to throw it away, otherwise we would have had to pay movers, a very practical composition, but German sentiments about this "instrument of Chopin" were hurt and they made a row about it...&lt;ref&gt;George Maciunas, letter to La Monte Young, 1962, quoted in ''Mr. Fluxus'', Williams and Noël, p53&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
At the same time, Maciunas used his connections at work to start printing cheap mass-produced books and multiples by some of the artists that were involved in the performances. The first three to be printed were ''Composition 1961'' by La Monte Young [http://archives.carre.pagesperso-orange.fr/Young%20La%20Monte.html see], ''An Anthology of Chance Operations'' edited by Young and Mac Low and ''[[Water Yam (artist's book)|Water Yam]]'', by George Brecht. ''Water Yam'', a series of event scores printed on small sheets of card and collected together in a cardboard box, was the first in a series of artworks that Maciunas printed that became known as ''Fluxkits''. Cheap, mass-produced and easily distributed, ''Fluxkits'' were originally intended to form an ever-expanding library of modern [[performance art]]. ''Water Yam'' was published in an edition of 1000 and originally cost $4.&lt;ref&gt;Price listed in the Fluxus Preview Review, July 1963, quoted in the ''Fluxus Codex'', Hendricks, Abrams, 1989 p217&lt;/ref&gt; By April 1964, almost a year later, Maciunas still had 996 copies unsold.&lt;ref&gt;Maciunas, letter to Emmett Williams, quoted in ''Mr. Fluxus'', Williams and Noel, p106&lt;/ref&gt;

Maciunas' original plan had been to design, edit and pay for each edition himself, in exchange for the copyright to be held by the collective.&lt;ref&gt;''Fluxus Codex'', Hendricks, p24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Dream of Fluxus, Kellein, p69&lt;/ref&gt; Profits were to be split 80/20 at first, in favor of the artist.&lt;ref&gt;This was to go down to 50/50 within a year; Dream of Fluxus, Kellein, p88&lt;/ref&gt; Since most of the composers already had publishing deals, Fluxus quickly moved away from music toward performance and visual art. John Cage, for instance, never published work under the Fluxus moniker due to his contract with the music publishers [[Edition Peters]].&lt;ref&gt;Maciunas sent out letters to 20 international artists between late 62 and early 63, demanding each artist relinquish any publishing rights and have Fluxus as sole and exclusive publisher. Maciunas likened his agreement to Cage's arrangement with Peters Editions. Only two artists—Henry Flynt and Thomas Schmitt signed up. Cage was not asked, due at least on Maciunas' side, to the aforesaid contract with editions peters. Dream of Fluxus, Thomas Kellein, Thames And Hudson, p69-71&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Maciunas seemed to have a fantastic ability to get things done.... if you had things to be printed he could get them printed. It's pretty hard in East Brunswick to get good offset printing. It's not impossible, but it's not so easy, and since I'm very lazy it was a relief to find somebody who could take the burden off my hands. So there was this guy Maciunas, a Lithuanian or Bulgarian, or somehow a refugee or whatever—beautifully dressed—"astonishing looking" would be a better adjective. He was somehow able to carry the whole thing off, without my having to go 57 miles to find a printer.&lt;ref&gt;George Brecht, "An Interview with Robin Page for [[Carla Liss]]", In ''Art And Artists'', London October 1972, p30-31 reprinted in ''Mr. Fluxus'', Williams and Noel, Thames And Hudson, p109-10 {{ISBN|0-500-97461-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Since Maciunas was [[colorblind]], Fluxus multiples were almost always black and white.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/24/arts/art-in-review-069620.html Art in Review, NY TImes]&lt;/ref&gt;

===New York and the FluxShops===
[[File:DeRidder'sFluxMailOrder.jpg|upright|left|thumb|Willem de Ridder's Mail Order FluxShop, Amsterdam, with Dorothea Meijer, winter 1964–65. Photo by Willem de Ridder]]
After his contract with the US Air Force was terminated due to ill health, Maciunas was forced to return to the US on 3 September 1963.&lt;ref&gt;''Mr. Fluxus'', Willims and Noel, p340&lt;/ref&gt; Once back in New York, he set about organizing a series of street concerts and opened a new shop, the 'Fluxhall', on [[Canal Street (Manhattan)|Canal Street]].
12 concerts, 'away from the beaten track of the New York art scene&lt;ref name=fluxus93&gt;The Dream of Fluxus, p93&lt;/ref&gt;' took place on Canal Street, 11 April to 23 May 1964. With photographs taken by Maciunas himself, pieces by [[Ben Vautier]], [[Alison Knowles]] and Takehisha Kosugi were performed in the street for free, although in practice there was 'no audience to speak of'&lt;ref name=fluxus93/&gt; anyway. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'The people in Fluxus had understood, as Brecht explained, that "concert halls, theaters, and art galleries" were "mummifying." Instead, these artists found themselves "preferring streets, homes, and railway stations...." Maciunas recognized a radical political potential in all this forthrightly anti-institutional production, which was an important source for his own deep commitment to it. Deploying his expertise as a professional graphic designer, Maciunas played an important role in projecting upon Fluxus whatever coherence it would later seem to have had.'&lt;ref&gt;Julia Robinson quoting George Brecht in George Brecht, Events; A Heterospective, Walther Konig, p118.&lt;!--What the heck is this, a book, an exhibition catalog, a journal or newspaper article?--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Along with the New York shop, Maciunas built up a distribution network for the new art across Europe and later outlets in California and Japan. Gallery and mail order outlets were established in Amsterdam, Villefranche-Sur-Mer, Milan and London, amongst others.&lt;ref&gt;The Dream of Fluxus, p109&lt;/ref&gt; By 1965, the first anthology ''[[Fluxus 1]]'' was available, consisting of manila envelopes bolted together containing work by numerous artists who would later become famous including LaMonte Young, [[Christo]] and Yoko Ono. Other pieces available included packs of altered playing cards by George Brecht, sensory boxes by [[Ay-O]], a regular newsletter with contributions by artists and musicians such as [[Ray Johnson]] and John Cale, and tin cans filled with poems, songs and recipes about beans by [[Alison Knowles]] ([http://www.aknowles.com/beanrolls.html see]). A videotape of George and Billy Maciunas' wedding was produced by [[Dimitri Devyatkin]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVDB1oy1O8s Marriage of George and Billy Maciunas]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stockhausen's ''Originale''===
[[File:FluxusTraitor.jpg|280px|thumb|''Traitor, you left Fluxus!'', a postcard sent by George Maciunas to Nam June Paik, c late 1964, after the latter's involvement with Stockhausen's ''Originale'']]
After returning to New York, Maciunas became reacquainted with Henry Flynt,&lt;ref&gt;At the time, a member of the leftist set WWP, Mr Fluxus, p108&lt;/ref&gt; who encouraged members of Fluxus to take a more overtly political stance. One of the results of these discussions was to set up a picket line at the American premiere of ''[[Originale]]'', a recent work by the German composer [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], 8 September 1964.&lt;ref name=":Bloch"&gt;[http://www.panmodern.com/OnStockhausen-sOriginale.pdf Bloch, Mark. "On Originale.", from Bloch, Mark, editor]. "Robert Delford Brown: Meat, Maps and Militant Metaphysics," Cameron Museum of Art, Wilmington, N.C., 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Stockhausen was deemed a 'Cultural Imperialist' by Maciunas and Flynt, while other members vehemently disagreed. The result was members of Fluxus, such as Nam June Paik and Jackson Mac Low, crossing a picket line made up of other members, including Ben Vautier and [[Takako Saito]]&lt;ref&gt;The Dream of Fluxus, p98&lt;/ref&gt; who handed out leaflets denouncing Stockhausen as "a characteristic European-North American ruling-class Artist".&lt;ref&gt;Picket Stockhausen Concert! Flynt and Maciunas flyer, 1964. Reproduced{{Full citation needed|date=July 2015}}&lt;!--something got chopped off here.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Dick Higgins participated in the picket, and then coolly joined the other performers inside;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ubu.com/film/stockhausen_originale.html A film of the event, UbuWeb]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Maciunas and his friend Henry Flynt tried to get the Fluxus people to march around outside the circus with white cards that said Originale was bad. And they tried to say that the Fluxus people who were in the circus weren't Fluxus any more. That was silly, because it made a split. I thought it was funny, and so first I walked around with Maciunas and with Henry with a card, then I went inside and joined the circus; so both groups got angry with me. Oh well. Some people say that Fluxus died that day—I once thought so myself—but it turned out I was wrong.&lt;ref&gt;Dick Higgins, "[http://www.artnotart.com/fluxus/dhiggins-childshistory.html A Child's History of Fluxus]", 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The event, arranged by [[Charlotte Moorman]] as part of her ''2nd Annual New York Avant Garde Festival'', would cement animosities between Maciunas and her,&lt;ref&gt;The Dream of fluxus, note 104, p98&lt;/ref&gt; with Maciunas frequently demanding that artists associated with Fluxus have nothing to do with the annual festival, and would often expel artists who ignored his demands. This hostility continued throughout Maciunas' life—much to Moorman's bemusement—despite her continued championing of Fluxus art and artists.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiEJdOlgcDE Charlotte Moorman and Nam June Paik "The Originale"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History, 1965–78==

===Perceived insurgencies and the Asiatic influence===
[[File:CutPieceOno.jpeg|thumb|''Cut Piece'', a performance piece by Yoko Ono in which the audience is invited to cut off her clothing. This version was staged at Carnegie Recital Hall, New York, 21 March 1965. Still taken from a film by [[Albert and David Maysles]]]]
The picketing of ''Originale'' marked the high point of Maciunas' [[agitprop]] approach,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stewarthomesociety.org/ass/fluxone.htm Stewart Home, The Assault on Culture, The origins of Fluxus and the movement in its 'heroic' period, Chapter 9]&lt;/ref&gt; an approach that estranged many of Fluxus' early proponents; Jackson Mac Low had resigned immediately after hearing 'antisocial' plans laid in April 1963, such as breaking down trucks under the Hudson River.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson Mac Low quoted in Mr Fluxus, p94-95&lt;/ref&gt; Brecht threatened to quit on the same issue, and then left New York in the spring of 1965. Despite his continued allegiance to Fluxus ideals, Dick Higgins fell out with Maciunas around the same time, ostensibly over his setting up the [[Something Else Press]] which printed many texts by key Fluxus-related personalities and other members of the avant garde. Charlotte Moorman continued to present her annual Avant Garde Festivals.&lt;ref&gt;[[Annual Avant Garde Festival of New York]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Such perceived insurrections in the coherence of Maciunas' leadership of Fluxus provided an opening for Fluxus to become increasingly influenced by Japanese members of the group.&lt;ref&gt;The Dream of Fluxus, p101&lt;/ref&gt; Since returning to Japan in 1961, Yoko Ono had been recommending colleagues look Maciunas up if they moved to New York; by the time she had returned, in early 1965, [[Genpei Akasegawa|Hi Red Center]], [[Shigeko Kubota]], Takako Saito, [[Mieko Shiomi (composer)|Mieko Shiomi]] and [[Ay-O]] had all started to make work for Fluxus, often of a contemplative nature.&lt;ref&gt;Dream of Fluxus, p102&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blurring boundaries===
As Fluxus gradually became more famous, Maciunas' ambitions for the sale of cheap multiples grew. The second flux-anthology, the ''Fluxkit'' (late 1964),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2011/fluxus_editions/works/fluxkit/ Fluxkit, MoMA]&lt;/ref&gt; collected together early 3D work made by the collective in a businessman's case, an idea borrowed directly from Duchamp's ''Boite en Valise''&lt;ref&gt;Fluxus Codex, p76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MoMA, Interactive"&gt;[http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/1999/muse/artist_pages/duchamp_boite.html MoMA, Interactive exhibitions]&lt;/ref&gt; Within a year, plans for a new anthology, ''Fluxus 2'', were in full swing to contain Flux films by [[John Cale]] and Yoko Ono (with hand held projectors provided), disrupted matchboxes and postcards by Ben Vautier, plastic food by [[Claes Oldenburg]], FluxMedicine by [[Shigeko Kubota]],&lt;ref&gt;containing empty pill packages&lt;/ref&gt; and artworks made of rocks, ink stamps, outdated travel tickets, undoable puzzles and a machine to facilitate humming.&lt;ref&gt;fluxus codex, Hendricks, p124&lt;/ref&gt;

Maciunas' belief in the collective extended to authorship; a number of pieces from this period were anonymous, mis-attributed, or have had their authorship since questioned.&lt;ref&gt;Yoko Ono, for instance, has claimed authorship of Mieko Shiomi's Disappearing Music For Face (aka Smile) for instance.&lt;/ref&gt; As a further complication, Maciunas was in the habit of dramatically changing ideas submitted by various artists before he put the works into production.
''Solid Plastic in Plastic Box'', credited to [[Per Kirkeby]] 1967, for instance, had originally been realised by Kirkeby as a metal box, inscribed 'This Box Contains Wood'. When opened, the box would be found to contain sawdust. By the time the multiple had been manufactured by Maciunas, it was a block of solid plastic contained in a plastic box of the same color.&lt;ref name="MoMA, Interactive" /&gt; Conversely, Maciunas assigned ''Degree Face Clock'', in which a clock face is measured out in 360°, to Kirkeby despite being an idea by [[Robert Watts (artist)|Robert Watts]];&lt;ref&gt;fluxus codex p290&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Some years ago, when I spoke with Robert Watts about ''Degree Face Clock'' and ''Compass Face Clock'', he had recalled thinking up the idea himself and was surprised that George Maciunas advertised them as Per Kirkeby's. Watts shrugged and said that was the way George worked. There would be ideas in the air and Maciunas would assign the piece to one artist or another.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Hendricks, quoted in fluxus codex, p291.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Other tactics from this time included Maciunas buying large amounts of plastic boxes wholesale, and handing them out to artists with the simple request to turn them into Fluxkits, and the use of the rapidly growing international network of artists to contribute items needed to complete works. Robert Watts' ''Fluxatlas'', 1973, for instance, contains small rocks sent by members of the group from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;'All contributors will receive a box in return...' Codex, p542&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his numerous original compositions which have joined the collective's catalog of works, [[Larry Miller (artist)|Larry Miller]], associated with the group since 1969, has also been active as an interpreter of the "classic" scores and responsible for bringing the group's works to a wider public, blurring the lines between artist, producer and researcher. Besides Miller’s own artistic work, he has also organized, reconstructed and performed at numerous Fluxus events and assembled an extensive collection of material on the history of Fluxus.&lt;ref&gt;Fluxus East: Fluxus Networks in Central Eastern Europe. http://www.fluxus-east.eu/?item=exhib&amp;lang=en&amp;sub=miller&lt;/ref&gt; Through Miller, Fluxus attracted media coverage such as the worldwide CNN coverage of ''Off Limits'' exhibit at Newark Museum, 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Marter, Joan M. and Anderson, Simon. Off Limits: Rutgers University and the Avant-garde, 1957–1963. Newark Museum. Newark, NJ&lt;/ref&gt; Other Miller activities as organizer, performer and presenter within the Fluxus milieu include ''Performance in Fluxus Continue 1963–2003'' at Musee d'Art et d'Art Contemporain in Nice; ''Fluxus a la Carte'' in Amsterdam; and ''Centraal Fluxus Festival'' at Centraal Museum, Utrecht, Netherlands. In 2004, for Geoff Hendricks' ''Critical Mass: Happenings, Fluxus, Performance, Intermedia and Rutgers University 1958–1972'', Miller reprised and updated the track and field events of the Flux Olympics, first presented in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Hendricks, Geoffrey, editor. Critical Mass: Happenings, Fluxus, Performance, Intermedia, and Rutgers. Mead Art Museum, Amherst, Massachusetts&lt;/ref&gt; For ''Do-it Yourself Fluxus'' at AI – Art Interactive – in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Miller worked as the curatorial consultant for an exhibit of works that allowed viewers hands-on experience including the reconstruction of several sections of the historic ''Flux Labyrinth'', a massive and intricate maze that Miller originally constructed with George Maciunas at Akademie Der Kunst, Berlin in 1976 and which included sections by several of the Fluxus artists. Miller created a new version of the ''Flux Labyrinth'' at the ''In the Spirit of Fluxus'' exhibit at the Walker Art Center in 1994, where Griel Marcus said, "Miller was... fine tuning the monster."&lt;ref&gt;Marcus, Griel. Real Life Rock: The Complete Top Ten Columns, 1986–2014. Yale University Press, New Haven, Connecticut pg. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Feminism ===
Fluxus women artists were founding members and contributed works in varying media and with differing content. Some made experimental and performative work having to do with the female body that created a powerful female presence, which existed within Fluxus from the group's beginning. This is illustrated by works such as [[Carolee Schneemann|Carolee Schneemann's]] "Interior Scroll", Yoko Ono's "Cut Piece", and [[Shigeko Kubota]]'s "Vagina Painting".  Women working within Fluxus were often simultaneously critiquing their position within a male dominated society while also exposing the inequalities within an art collective that claimed to be open and diverse.  George Maciunas, in his rejection of Schneeman as a member of Fluxus, called her "guilty of Baroque tendencies, overt sexuality, and theatrical excess".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor=1146571 |title = Fluxus Feminus|last = O'Dell|first = Kathy|authorlink=Kathy O'Dell|date = Spring 1997|journal = TDR|doi = 10.2307/1146571|pmid =|volume=41|pages=43–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Interior Scroll" was a response to Schneemann's experience as a filmmaker in the 1950s and 1960s, when male filmmakers claimed that women should restrict themselves to dance.

===Utopian communities===
A number of artists in the group were interested in setting up Flux communes, intending to 'bridge the gap between the artist community and the surrounding society'&lt;ref name="Danielle"&gt;[http://www.wordsinspace.net/urban-media-archaeology/2011-fall/2011/10/11/project-proposal-2/ The History of Artists and Art Production in SoHo, Danielle]&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these, La Cédille qui Sourit or ''The [[Cedilla]] That Smiles'',&lt;ref&gt;Harren, Natilee. "La cédille qui ne finit pas: Robert Filliou, George Brecht, and Fluxus in Villefranche." Getty Research Journal, No. 4 (2012), pp. 127–143.&lt;/ref&gt; was set up in [[Villefranche-sur-Mer]], France, by [[Robert Filliou]] and George Brecht, 1965–1968. Intended as an 'International Centre of Permanent Creation', the shop sold Fluxkits and other small wares as well as housing a 'non-school', boasting the motto "A carefree exchange of information and experience. No students, no teachers. Perfect licence, at times to listen at times to talk."&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalogue.drouot.com/ref-drouot/lot-ventes-aux-encheres-drouot.jsp?id=1150365 Fluxkit documenting the project]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, Maciunas, Watts and others took advantage of new legislation drafted to regenerate the area of Manhattan known as 'Hell's Hundred Acres', soon to become rebranded as [[SoHo]], allowing artists to buy live/work spaces in an area that had been blighted due to a proposed 18-lane expressway along [[Broome Street]].&lt;ref name="Danielle" /&gt; Led by Maciunas, plans were laid to start a series of real-estate developments in the area, designed to create an artists' community within a few streets of the FluxShop on Canal Street. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'Maciunas wanted to establish collective workshops, food-buying cooperatives and theaters to link the strengths of various media together and bridge the gap between the artist community and the surrounding society'&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The first warehouse, intended to house Maciunas, Watts, Christo &amp; Jeanne-Claude, Jonas Mekas, LaMonte Young &amp; others, was located on Greene Street. Likening these communities to the soviet [[Kolkhoz]]s, Maciunas didn't hesitate to adopt the title 'Chairman of Bldg. Co-Op'&lt;ref&gt;Dream of Fluxus, p131&lt;/ref&gt; without first registering an office or becoming a member of the New York State Association of Realtors.&lt;ref&gt;The Dream of Fluxus, p132&lt;/ref&gt; FluxHousing Co-Operatives continued to redevelop the area over the next decade, and were widened to include plans to set up a ''FluxIsland''- a suitable island was located near Antigua, but the money to buy and develop it remained unforthcoming- and finally a performance arts centre called the ''FluxFarm'' established in [[New Marlborough]], Massachusetts. The plans were continually dogged by financial problems, constant run-ins with the New York authorities, and eventually resulted, on 8 November 1975, in Maciunas being severely beaten by thugs sent by an unpaid electrical contractor.&lt;ref&gt;Dream of Fluxus, p147&lt;/ref&gt;

=== End ===
It is arguably said that Fluxus came to an end when its founder and leader George Maciunas died in 1978 from complications due to pancreatic cancer. Maciunas' funeral was held in typical Fluxus style where they dubbed the funeral "Fluxfeast and Wake", ate foods that were only black, white, or purple.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.theartstory.org/movement-fluxus.htm|title = Fluxus Movement, Artists and Major Works|date = 2015|accessdate = |website = The Art Story|publisher = |last = DiTolla|first = Racy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maciunas left behind his thoughts on Fluxus in a series of important video conversations called ''Interview With George Maciunas'' with Fluxus artist [[Larry Miller (artist)|Larry Miller]], which has been screened internationally and translated into numerous languages.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Larry Miller, 1978, referenced in Mr Fluxus, E Williams and A Noel, Thames and Hudson, 1997, p114&lt;/ref&gt; Over the past 30 years, Miller has shot and collected Fluxus related materials including tapes on Joe Jones, Carolee Schneemann, Ben Vautier, Dick Higgins, and Alison Knowles, in addition to the 1978 Maciunas interview.

==Since 1978==
Maciunas moved to the Berkshire Mountains in Western Massachusetts in the late 1970s. Two decades earlier, after collecting paintings, the Boston art collector Jean Brown, and her late husband Leonard Brown, began to shift their focus to Dadaist and Surrealist art, manifestoes and periodicals.  In 1971, after Mr. Brown's death, Mrs. Brown moved to [[Tyringham, Massachusetts|Tyringham]], and expanded into areas adjacent to Fluxus, including artists' books, concrete poetry, happenings, mail art and performance art. Maciunas helped turn her home, originally a Shaker seed house, into an important center for both Fluxus artists and scholars, with Mrs. Brown alternately cooking meals and showing guests her collection. Activities centered on a large archive room on the second floor built by Maciunas, who settled in nearby [[Great Barrington, Massachusetts|Great Barrington]], where it was discovered that Maciunas developed cancer of the pancreas and liver in 1977.

Three months before his death, he married his friend and companion, the poet Billie Hutching. After a legal wedding in Lee, Massachusetts, the couple performed a "Fluxwedding" in a friend's loft in SoHo, 25 February 1978. The bride and groom traded clothing.&lt;ref&gt;According to Hutching, quoted in Mr. Fluxus, p280. Maciunas was a transvestite and masochist.&lt;/ref&gt; Maciunas died on 9 May 1978 in a hospital in Boston.

After the death of George Maciunas a rift opened in Fluxus between a few collectors and curators who placed Fluxus as an art movement in a specific time frame (1962 to 1978), and the artists themselves, many of whom continued to see Fluxus as a living entity held together by its core values and world view. Different theorists and historians adopted each of these views. Fluxus is therefore referred to variously in the past or the present tense. While the definition of Fluxus was always a subject of controversy, the question is now significantly more complex due to the fact that many of the original artists who were still living when Maciunas died are now dead themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/24/arts/design/fluxus-and-the-essential-questions-of-life-review.html Ken Johnson, ''Liberating Viewers, and the World, With Silliness'', NY Times, exhibition Review]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyu.edu/greyart/exhibits/fluxus/FluxNYU.html ''Fluxus at NYU'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have argued that the unique control that curator Jon Hendricks holds over a major historical Fluxus collection (the Gilbert and Lila Silverman collection) has enabled him to influence, through the numerous books and catalogues subsidized by the collection, the view that Fluxus died with Maciunas. Hendricks argues that Fluxus was a historical movement that occurred at a particular time, asserting that such central Fluxus artists as Dick Higgins and Nam June Paik could no longer label themselves as active Fluxus artists after 1978, and that contemporary artists influenced by Fluxus cannot lay claim to be Fluxus artists.&lt;ref&gt;Hendricks, Jon. 1988. Fluxus codex. Detroit, Mich: Gilbert and Lila Silverman Fluxus Collection in association with H.N. Abrams, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sdrc.lib.uiowa.edu/atca/subjugated/one_2.htm Robert Pincus-Witten on Fluxus, and Jon Hendricks's Codex]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Museum of Modern Art]] makes the same claim dating the movement to the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref name="MOMA" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/visit/calendar/exhibitions/1033 MoMA exhibitions, October 2009 – August 2010] Retrieved 5 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; However, the influence of Fluxus continues today in [[multi-media]] [[digital art]] performances.
In September, 2011 [[Other Minds (organization)|Other Minds]] presented a performance at the SOMArts building in San Francisco to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Fluxus.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sfcv.org/reviews/other-minds/always-in-flux-mostly-in-fun] Retrieved 1 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  The performance was curated by [[Adam Fong]] who was also one of the performers along with [[Yoshi Wada]], [[Alison Knowles]], [[Hannah Higgins]], [[Luciano Chessa]] and Adam Overton.

Others, including [[Hannah Higgins]], daughter of fluxus artists [[Alison Knowles]] and [[Dick Higgins]], assert that although Maciunas was a key participant, there were many more, including Fluxus co-founder Higgins, who continued to work within Fluxus after the death of Maciunas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mouthtomouthmag.com/higgins.html Interview with Hannah Higgins]&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of the Internet in the 1990s enabled a vibrant post-Fluxus community to emerge online. After some of the original Fluxus artists from the 1960s and 1970s including Higgins, created online communities such as the Fluxlist, following their departure, younger artists, writers, musicians, and performers have attempted to continue their work in [[cyberspace]]. Many of the original Fluxus artists still working enjoy homages by younger Fluxus-influenced artists who stage events to commemorate Fluxus, but discourage the use of the "Fluxus" label by younger artists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whitehotmagazine.com/articles/boat-book-alison-knowles/3113 Bloch, Mark.

"Human Telepathic Collaborations from Fluxus to Now"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 the [[Los Angeles Philharmonic]] in its ''Fluxus Festival'' presented a fluxus performance incorporating [[John Cage|John Cage's]] "Europeras 1 and 2" directed by [[Yuval Sharon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What Happens When Fluxus Enters the Concert Hall? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/11/arts/music/la-philharmonic-fluxus-festival.html |website=New York Times |accessdate=17 November 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influences ==
An immediate predecessor of Fluxus, according to Maciunas, was the Gutai group which promoted art as an anti-academic, psychophysical experience, an "art of matter as it is" as explained by Shiraga Kazuo in 1956. Gutai became connected with a sort of artistic mass-production, anticipating Fluxus's trademark, i.e., ambiguity between the cultivated and the trivial, between high and low. Indeed, avant-garde art in Japan tended toward informal rather than conceptual elements, radically opposing the extreme formality and symbolism found in Japanese art.

In the 1950s New York music scene there could be discerned many issues related to the post-war disenchantment experienced by many throughout the developed world. Such disillusionment in itself presented a case for commitment to Buddhism and Zen in everyday matters such as mental attitude, meditation, and approach to food and body care. It was also felt, however, that there was a general need for a more radical artistic sensibility. The themes of decay and of the inadequacy of the idea of modernity in artistic fields were adopted, partly from Duchamp and Dada and partly from consciousness of the uneasiness of living in contemporary society.

It is said that Fluxus challenged notions of representation, offering instead simple presentation. This, in fact, corresponds to a major difference between Western and Japanese art. Another important Fluxus characteristic was the elimination of perceived boundaries between art and life, a very prominent trend in post war art. This was exemplified by the work and writings of Josheph Bueys who stated, "every man is an artist." Fluxus's approach was an everyday, "economic" one as seen in the production of small objects made of paper and plastic. Again, this strongly corresponds with some of the fundamental characteristics of Japanese culture, i.e., the high artistic value of everyday acts and objects and the aesthetic appreciation of frugality. This also links with Japanese art, and the concept of shibumi, which may involve incompleteness, and supports the appreciation of bare objects, emphasizing subtlety rather than overtness. The renowned Japanese aesthetics scholar Onishi Yoshinori called the essence of Japanese art pantonomic because of the consciousness of no distinction between nature, art and life. Art is the way to approach life and nature/reality corresponding to actual existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 25164637|title = Toshi Ichiyanagi, Japanese Composer and "Fluxus"|last = Galliano|first = Luciana|date = Summer 2006|journal = |doi = |pmid =|volume=44|pages=250–261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fluxus art==
Fluxus encouraged a "[[do-it-yourself]]" aesthetic, and valued simplicity over complexity. Like [[Dada]] before it, Fluxus included a strong current of anti-commercialism and an [[anti-art]] sensibility, disparaging the conventional market-driven art world in favor of an artist-centered creative practice. As Fluxus artist [[Robert Filliou]] wrote, however, Fluxus differed from Dada in its richer set of aspirations, and the positive social and communitarian aspirations of Fluxus far outweighed the anti-art tendency that also marked the group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://artsbirthday.blogspot.com/2007/12/who-was-robert-filliou.html Robert Filliou on Fluxus and art] Retrieved 5 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Among its early associates were [[Joseph Beuys]], [[Dick Higgins]], [[Davi Det Hompson]], [[Nam June Paik]], [[Wolf Vostell]], [[La Monte Young]], [[Joseph Byrd]], [[Al Hansen]] and Yoko Ono who explored media ranging from performance art to poetry to experimental music to film. Taking the stance of opposition to the ideas of tradition and professionalism in the arts of their time, the Fluxus group shifted the emphasis from what an artist makes to the artist's personality, actions, and opinions. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s (their most active period) they staged "action" events, engaged in politics and public speaking, and produced sculptural works featuring unconventional materials. Their radically untraditional works included, for example, the [[video art]] of Nam June Paik and [[Charlotte Moorman]] and the performance art of Joseph Beuys and Wolf Vostell. During the early years of Fluxus, the often playful style of the Fluxus artists resulted in them being considered by some to be little more than a group of [[prank]]sters. Fluxus has also been compared to [[Dada]] and aspects of [[Pop Art]] and is seen as the starting point of [[mail art]] and [[no wave]] artists. Artists from succeeding generations such as [[Mark Bloch]] do not try to characterize themselves as Fluxus but create spinoffs such as Fluxpan or Jung Fluxus as a way of continuing some of the Fluxus ideas in a 21st-century, post-[[mail art]] context.

In terms of an artistic approach, Fluxus artists preferred to work with whatever materials were at hand, and either created their own work or collaborated in the creation process with their colleagues. Outsourcing part of the creative process to commercial fabricators was not usually part of Fluxus practice. Maciunas personally hand-assembled many of the Fluxus multiples and editions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artnotart.com/fluxus/kfriedman-fourtyyears.html Ken Friedman, ''40 Years of Fluxus''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100211142656/http://www.artnotart.com/fluxus/kfriedman-fourtyyears.html |date=11 February 2010 }} Retrieved 5 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; While Maciunas assembled many objects by hand, he designed and intended them for mass production.&lt;ref name="MOMA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Maciunas on Fluxus"&gt;[http://www.artnotart.com/fluxus/gmaciunas--.html Maciunas on Fluxus] Retrieved 5 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Where multiple publishers produced signed, numbered objects in limited editions intended for sale at high prices, Maciunas produced open editions at low prices.&lt;ref name="MOMA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Maciunas on Fluxus"/&gt; Several other Fluxus publishers produced different kinds of Fluxus editions. The best known of these was the [[Something Else Press]], established by Dick Higgins, probably the largest and most extensive Fluxus publisher, producing books in editions that ran from 1,500 copies to as many as 5,000 copies, all available at standard bookstore prices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.chello.nl/j.seegers1/flux_files/something-else-press.html Fluxus and Happening, the Something Else Press] Retrieved 5 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ubu.com/historical/gb/ UBUWeb] Retrieved 5 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Higgins created the term "[[intermedia]]" in a 1966 essay.

The art forms most closely associated with Fluxus are event scores and Fluxus boxes. Fluxus boxes (sometimes called Fluxkits or Fluxboxes) originated with George Maciunas who would gather collections of printed cards, games, and ideas, organizing them in small plastic or wooden boxes.&lt;ref&gt;Kellein, Hendriks, and Hendricks 1995{{Page needed|date=January 2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Event score===
An event score, such as [[George Brecht]]'s "Drip Music", is essentially a [[performance art]] script that is usually only a few lines long and consists of descriptions of actions to be performed rather than dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kotz |first=Liz |date=Spring 2001 |title=Post-Cagean aesthetics and the 'event' score |journal=[[October (journal)|October]] |issue=95 |pages=55–89 |jstor=779200}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dezeuze |first=Anna |date=January 2002 |title=Origins of the Fluxus score: from indeterminacy to the 'do-it-yourself' artwork |journal=[[Performance Research]] |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=78–94 |doi=10.1080/13528165.2002.10871876}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Robinson |first=Julia |date=Winter 2009 |title=Abstraction to model: George Brecht's events and the conceptual turn in art of the 1960s |journal=[[October (journal)|October]] |volume=127 |pages=77–108 |doi=10.1162/octo.2009.127.1.77 |jstor=40368554}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fluxus artists differentiate event scores from "[[happening]]s". Whereas happenings were sometimes complicated, lengthy performances meant to blur the lines between performer and audience, performance and reality, event performances were usually brief and simple. The event performances sought to elevate the banal, to be mindful of the mundane, and to frustrate the [[high culture]] of academic and market-driven music and art.

The idea of the event began in [[Henry Cowell]]'s philosophy of music.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Cowell, a teacher to John Cage and later to Dick Higgins, coined the term that Higgins and others later applied to short, terse descriptions of performable work. The term "score" is used in exactly the sense that one uses the term to describe a music score: a series of notes that allow anyone to perform the work, an idea linked both to what [[Nam June Paik]] labeled the "do it yourself" approach and to what [[Ken Friedman]] termed "musicality." While much is made of the do it yourself approach to art, it is vital to recognize that this idea emerges in music, and such important Fluxus artists as Paik, Higgins, or Corner began as composers, bringing to art the idea that each person can create the work by "doing it." This is what Friedman meant by musicality, extending the idea more radically to conclude that anyone can create work of any kind from a score, acknowledging the composer as the originator of the work while realizing the work freely and even interpreting it in far different ways from those the original composer might have done.

Other creative forms that have been adopted by Fluxus practitioners include [[collage]], [[sound art]], music, video, and poetry—especially [[visual poetry]] and [[concrete poetry]].

===Use of shock===
[[Nam June Paik]] and his peers in the Fluxus art movement thoroughly understood the impact and importance of shock on the viewer. Fluxus artists believed that shock not only makes the viewer question their own reasoning, but is a means to awaken the viewer, "...from a perceptive lethargy furthered by habit."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=64_MywUrftoC&amp;lpg=PA131&amp;ots=zG1AOZCdU4&amp;dq=.from%20a%20perceptive%20lethargy%20furthered%20by%20habit%22&amp;pg=PA131#v=onepage&amp;q=.from%20a%20perceptive%20lethargy%20furthered%20by%20habit%22&amp;f=false|title=Shock and the Senseless in Dada and Fluxus|last=Brill|first=Dorothée|date=2010|publisher=UPNE|year=|isbn=9781584659174|location=|pages=131|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paik himself described the shock factor in his Fluxus work: "People who come to my concerts or see my objects need to be transferred into another state of consciousness. They have to be high. And in order to put them into this state of highness, a little shock is required... Anyone who came to my exhibition saw the head and was high."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xv7XCwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA294&amp;dq=People%20who%20come%20to%20my%20concerts%20or%20see%20my%20objects%20paik&amp;pg=PA294#v=onepage&amp;q=People%20who%20come%20to%20my%20concerts%20or%20see%20my%20objects%20paik&amp;f=false|title=Into the Maelstrom: Music, Improvisation and the Dream of Freedom: Before 1970|last=Toop|first=David|date=2016-05-05|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA|year=|isbn=9781441102775|location=|pages=294|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paik's "head" was that of a real cow displayed at the entrance to his exhibition, Exposition of Music—Electronic Television, located in the Galerie Parnass, Wuppertal, Germany in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Shock and the Senseless in Dada and Fluxus|last = Brill|first = Dorothee|publisher = University Press of New England Hanover and London|year = 2010|isbn = 978-1-58465-917-4|location = |pages = 131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistic philosophies==
Fluxus is similar in spirit to the earlier art movement of [[Dada]], emphasizing the concept of [[anti-art]] and taking jabs at the seriousness of modern art.&lt;ref name="rush24"&gt;Rush 2005, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Fluxus artists used their minimal performances to highlight their perceived connections between everyday objects and art, similarly to Duchamp in pieces such as ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]''.&lt;ref name="rush24"/&gt; Fluxus art was often presented in "events", which Fluxus member [[George Brecht]] defined as "the smallest unit of a situation."&lt;ref name="rush24"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.chello.nl/j.seegers1/flux_files/brecht.html On George Brecht, Robert Filliou and others] Retrieved 5 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The events consisted of a minimal instruction, opening the events to accidents and other unintended effects.&lt;ref name="rush25"&gt;Rush 2005, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Also contributing to the randomness of events was the integration of audience members into the performances, realizing Duchamp's notion of the viewer completing the art work.&lt;ref name="rush25"/&gt;

The Fluxus artistic philosophy has been defined as a synthesis of four key factors that define the majority of Fluxus work:
# Fluxus is an attitude. It is not a movement or a style.&lt;ref name="smith1"&gt;Smith 1998,{{Page needed|date=January 2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Fluxus is intermedia.&lt;ref name="higgins1"&gt;Higgins 1966,{{Page needed|date=January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fluxus creators like to see what happens when different media intersect. They use found and everyday objects, sounds, images, and texts to create new combinations of objects, sounds, images, and texts.
# Fluxus works are simple. The art is small, the texts are short, and the performances are brief.
# Fluxus is fun. Humor has always been an important element in Fluxus.

==Late criticism==
There is a complexity in adequately charting a unified history of Fluxus. In ''Fluxus: A brief History and Other Fictions'', Owen Smith concedes that, with the emergence of new material published about Fluxus and its expansion into the present, its history must remain open.&lt;ref name="O'neill"&gt;O'neill, Rosemary. ''In the Spirit of Fluxus''. Art Journal 53.1 (1994): 90–93. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; The resistance to being pigeonholed, and with the absence of a stable identity, Fluxus opened up to wide participation but also, from what would appear in history, closed off that possibility. Maciunas made frequent acts of excommunication between 1962 and 1978 which destabilized the collective.&lt;ref&gt;O'dell, Kathy. ''Fluxus Feminus''. Tdr (1988–) 41.1 (1997): 43–60. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Kristine Stiles argues in one of her essays that the essence of Fluxus is "performative", while recently she feels that essence has been "eroded or threatened". Fluxus instead moved towards favoring the objects of publication, Stiles asserts: "Care must be taken that Fluxus is not transformed historically from a radical process and presentational art into a tradition static and representational art."&lt;ref name="O'neill" /&gt; With no leadership, no identifiable guidelines, no real collective strategy, no homogeneity in terms of practices, Fluxus cannot be handled through traditional critical tools. Fluxus is an indicator of this confusion. Fluxus therefore is nearly always a discourse on the failure of discourse.&lt;ref&gt;''Fluxus, More Flux Than History''. Art-Press 391 (2012): 65–69. Art Source. Web. 6 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fluxus artists==
Fluxus artists shared several characteristics including wit and "childlikeness", though they lacked a consistent identity as an artistic community.&lt;ref name="odell43"&gt;O'Dell, 1997, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; This vague self-identification allowed the group to include a variety of artists, including a large number of women. The possibility that Fluxus had more female members than any Western art group up to that point in history is particularly significant because Fluxus came on the heels of the white male-dominated [[abstract expressionism]] movement.&lt;ref name="odell43"/&gt; However, despite the designed open-endedness of Fluxus, Maciunas insisted on maintaining unity in the collective. Because of this, Maciunas was accused of expelling certain members for deviating from what he perceived as the goals of Fluxus.&lt;ref name="oren8"&gt;Oren 1993, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many artists, writers, and composers have been associated with Fluxus over the years, including:

'''Gandharvanpattu''' is a [[ritual]] artform in [[North Kerala]].&lt;ref&gt;http://digitalpaper.mathrubhumi.com/c/15989669&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mannarasala.org/dynamic.php?page=mannarasalaFestivals&lt;/ref&gt; This ritual is mainly performed by [[Vannan]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.india9.com/i9show/Kenthran-Pattu-71818.htm&lt;/ref&gt; There is five [[theyyam]]s called Rudhirakkali, Varavakkali, Devathe, Mekkkaruvaal, Gandharvan in gandharvanpattu.&lt;ref&gt;http://vtzmp3.com/download/mp3-download/KDNfaI4bkSI.html&lt;/ref&gt; This ritual is performed for the blessing of [[bhootam]]. The ritual is performed in the style of [[Kalampattu|kalam pattu]] in [[Kavu]].&lt;ref&gt;http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/173586/7/07_chapter%202.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://keralaculture.org/kalamezhuthupattu/66&lt;/ref&gt; In past times this artform is performed on the houses where pregnant women live&lt;ref&gt;http://www.india9.com/i9show/Kenthran-Pattu-71818.htm&lt;/ref&gt; to eliminate different kinds of [[Batha (demon)|badha]](ghost). [[Pulluvaveena]] and [[Pulluvakkudam]] are also used in Gandharvan Pattu.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scert.kerala.gov.in/images/2015/Plustwo/music.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 this artform is performed again in stage.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-editorialfeatures/deities-dancers-and-drumbeats/article13385395.ece&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDNfaI4bkSI&lt;/ref&gt;

This art is also known as '''Kenthran Pattu&lt;ref&gt;http://www.india9.com/i9show/Kenthran-Pattu-71818.htm&lt;/ref&gt;'''

'''Heraldry''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɛ|r|ə|l|d|r|i}}) is a broad term, encompassing the design, display, and study of armorial bearings (known as ''armory''), as well as related disciplines, such as [[vexillology]], together with the study of ceremony, rank, and [[genealogy|pedigree]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Charles Fox-Davies]], ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', Dodge Publishing Company, New York (1909), reprinted by Bonanza Books, New York (1978), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Friar, Ed. ''A Dictionary of Heraldry''. (Harmony Books, New York: 1987), p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Webster's 3rd new international|Webster's Third New International Dictionary]]'', [[Merriam-Webster|C. &amp; G. Merriam Company]], Cambridge, Massachusetts (1961).&lt;/ref&gt;  Armory, the best-known branch of heraldry, concerns the design and transmission of the [[achievement (heraldry)|heraldic achievement]], more commonly known as the [[coat of arms]]. The coat of arms usually includes a [[escutcheon (heraldry)|shield]], [[helmet (heraldry)|helmet]], and [[Crest (heraldry) |crest]], together with any accompanying devices, such as [[supporter]]s, [[heraldic badge|badges]], [[heraldic flag|heraldic banners]], and [[motto]]es.&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 1, 57–59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the use of various devices to signify individuals and groups goes back to [[ancient history|antiquity]], both the form and use of such devices varied widely, and the concept of regular, hereditary designs, constituting the distinguishing feature of heraldry, did not develop until the [[High Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name="CGH 1–18"&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 1–18.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of helmets with face guards during this period made it difficult to recognize one's commanders in the field when large armies gathered together for extended periods, necessitating the development of heraldry as a symbolic language.&lt;ref name="CGH 1–18"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[John Brooke-Little]], ''An Heraldic Alphabet'', Macdonald, London (1973), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The beauty and pageantry of heraldic designs allowed them to survive the gradual abandonment of armour on the battlefield during the seventeenth century.  Heraldry has been described poetically as "the handmaid of history",&lt;ref&gt;S. T. Aveling, ''Heraldry: Ancient and Modern, including Boutell's Heraldry,'' Frederick Warne and Company, London and New York (1890), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; "the shorthand of history",&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', p. v.&lt;/ref&gt; and "the floral border in the garden of history".&lt;ref&gt;[[Iain Moncreiffe of that Ilk]] &amp; [[Don Pottinger|Pottinger]], ''Simple Heraldry'', Thomas Nelson (1953).&lt;/ref&gt;  In modern times, individuals, public and private organizations, corporations, cities, towns, and regions use heraldry and its conventions to symbolize their heritage, achievements, and aspirations.&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 19–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main|History of heraldry}}
===Precursors===
Various symbols have been used to represent individuals or groups for thousands of years.  The earliest representations of distinct persons and regions in [[ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] art show the use of standards topped with the images or symbols of various gods, and the names of kings appear upon emblems known as [[serekh]]s, representing the king's palace, and usually topped with a falcon representing the god [[Horus]], of whom the king was regarded as the earthly incarnation.  Similar emblems and devices are found in ancient [[Mesopotamia]]n art of the same period, and the precursors of heraldic beasts such as the [[griffin]] can also be found.&lt;ref name="CGH 1–18"/&gt;  In the [[Bible]], the [[Book of Numbers]] refers to the standards and ensigns of the [[Israelites|children of Israel]], who were commanded to gather beneath these emblems and declare their pedigrees.&lt;ref&gt;[[Book of Numbers|Numbers]], i. 2, 18, 52; ii. 2, 34; quoted by William Sloane Sloane-Evans, in ''A Grammar of British Heraldry'', John Russell Smith, London (1854), p. ix (quoted by Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', p. 6).&lt;/ref&gt;  The Greek and Latin writers frequently describe the shields and symbols of various heroes,&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 6–10.&lt;/ref&gt; and units of the Roman army were sometimes identified by distinctive markings on their shields.&lt;ref&gt;''Notitia Dignitatum'', Bodleian Library&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the nineteenth century, it was common for heraldic writers to cite examples such as these, and metaphorical symbols such as the "Lion of Judah" or "Eagle of the Caesars" as evidence of the antiquity of heraldry itself; and to infer therefrom that the great figures of ancient history bore arms representing their noble status and descent.  The [[Book of Saint Albans]], compiled in 1486, declares that Christ himself was a gentleman of coat armour.&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  But these fabulous claims have long since been dismissed as the fantasy of medieval heralds, for there is no evidence of a distinctive symbolic language akin to that of heraldry during this early period; nor do many of the shields described in antiquity bear a close resemblance to those of medieval heraldry; nor is there any evidence that specific symbols or designs were passed down from one generation to the next, representing a particular person or line of descent.&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 11–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The medieval heralds also [[attributed arms|devised arms]] for various knights and lords from history and literature.  Notable examples include the toads attributed to [[Pharamond]], the cross and martlets of [[Edward the Confessor]], and the various arms attributed to the [[Nine Worthies]] and the Knights of the [[Round Table]].  These too are now regarded as a fanciful invention, rather than evidence of the antiquity of heraldry.

===Origins of modern heraldry===
{{seealso|List of oldest heraldry}}
[[File:Geoffrey of Anjou Monument.jpg|thumb|Enamel from the tomb of [[Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou]], one of the earliest depictions of modern heraldry.]]
The development of the modern heraldic language cannot be attributed to a single individual, time, or place.  Although certain designs that are now considered heraldic were evidently in use during the eleventh century, most accounts and depictions of shields up to the beginning of the twelfth century contain little or no evidence of their heraldic character.  For example, the [[Bayeux Tapestry]], illustrating the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman invasion]] of England in 1066, and probably commissioned about 1077, when the cathedral of Bayeux was rebuilt,{{efn-lr|This was undertaken by Odo, Bishop of Bayeux, and half-brother of William I, whose conquest of England is commemorated by the tapestry.}} depicts a number of shields of various shapes and designs, many of which are plain, while others are decorated with dragons, crosses, or other typically heraldic figures.  Yet no individual is depicted twice bearing the same arms, nor are any of the descendants of the various persons depicted known to have borne devices resembling those in the tapestry.&lt;ref&gt;John Woodward and George Burnett, ''A Treatise on Heraldry: British and Foreign'', W. &amp; A. K. Johnson, Edinburgh and London (1892), vol. 1, pp. 29–31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CGH 14–16"&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 14–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, an account of the French knights at the court of the Byzantine emperor [[Alexios I Komnenos|Alexius I]] at the beginning of the twelfth century describes their shields of polished metal, utterly devoid of heraldic design.  A Spanish manuscript from 1109 describes both plain and decorated shields, none of which appears to have been heraldic.&lt;ref name="ToH 26"&gt;Woodward and Burnett, vol. 1, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Basilica of St Denis|Abbey of St. Denis]] contained a window commemorating the knights who embarked on the [[Second Crusade]] in 1147, and was probably made soon after the event; but [[Bernard de Montfaucon|Montfaucon's]] illustration of the window before it was destroyed shows no heraldic design on any of the shields.&lt;ref name="CGH 14–16"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woodward and Burnett, vol. 1, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, from the time of the Norman conquest, official documents had to be sealed.  Beginning in the twelfth century, seals assumed a distinctly heraldic character; a number of seals dating from between 1135 and 1155 appear to show the adoption of heraldic devices in England, France, Germany, Spain, and Italy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Woodcock (officer of arms)|Thomas Woodcock]] &amp; [[John Martin Robinson]], ''The Oxford Guide to Heraldry'', Oxford University Press, New York (1988), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  A notable example of an early armorial seal is attached to a charter granted by [[Philip I, Count of Flanders]], in 1164.  Seals from the latter part of the eleventh and early twelfth centuries show no evidence of heraldic symbolism, but by the end of the twelfth century, seals are uniformly heraldic in nature.&lt;ref name="ToH 26"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, ''Heraldry in England'', p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest known examples of armory as it subsequently came to be practiced can be seen on the tomb of [[Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou]], who died in 1151.&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;  An enamel, probably commissioned by Geoffrey's widow between 1155 and 1160, depicts him carrying a blue shield decorated with six golden lions rampant.{{efn-lr|Only four lions are visible in this depiction, in which the shield is shown in profile, but judging from their position, there must have been six; the tomb of Geoffrey's grandson, William Longspée, shows him bearing an apparently identical shield, but on this all six lions are at least partly visible.}}  He wears a blue helmet adorned with another lion, and his cloak is lined in vair.  A medieval chronicle states that Geoffrey was given a shield of this description when he was knighted by his father-in-law, [[Henry I of England|Henry I]], in 1128; but this account probably dates to about 1175.&lt;ref&gt;C. A. Stothard, ''Monumental Effigies of Great Britain'' (1817) pl. 2, illus. in Anthony Wagner, Richmond Herald, ''Heraldry in England'', Penguin (1946), pl. I.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Michel Pastoureau]], ''[https://books.google.com/books/about/Discoveries_Heraldry.html?id=hmZ5QgAACAAJ Heraldry: An Introduction to a Noble Tradition]'', "[[Abrams Discoveries]]" series. Harry N. Abrams, Inc. (1997), {{p.|18}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earlier heraldic writers attributed the lions of England to [[William the Conqueror]], but the earliest evidence of the association of lions with the English crown is a seal bearing two lions passant, used by the future [[John, King of England|King John]] during the lifetime of his father, [[Henry II of England|Henry II]], who died in 1189.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward and Burnett, vol. 1, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CGH 173–174"&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 173–174.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since Henry was the son of Geoffrey Plantagenet, it seems reasonable to suppose that the adoption of lions as an heraldic emblem by Henry or his sons might have been inspired by Geoffrey's shield.  John's elder brother, [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]], who succeeded his father on the throne, is believed to have been the first to have borne the arms of three lions passant-guardant, still the arms of England, having earlier used two lions rampant combatant, which arms may also have belonged to his father.&lt;ref&gt;Pastoureau, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;  Richard is also credited with having originated the English crest of a lion statant (now statant-guardant).&lt;ref name="CGH 173–174"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woodward and Burnett, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of heraldry are sometimes associated with the [[Crusades]], a series of military campaigns undertaken by Christian armies from 1096 to 1487, with the goal of reconquering Jerusalem and other former Byzantine territories captured by Muslim forces during the seventh century.  While there is no evidence that heraldic art originated in the course of the Crusades, there is no reason to doubt that the gathering of large armies, drawn from across Europe for a united cause, would have encouraged the adoption of armorial bearings as a means of identifying one's commanders in the field, or that it helped disseminate the principles of armory across Europe.  At least two distinctive features of heraldry are generally accepted as products of the crusaders: the surcoat, an outer garment worn over the armor to protect the wearer from the heat of the sun, was often decorated with the same devices that appeared on a knight's shield.  It is from this garment that the phrase "coat of arms" is derived.&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt;  Also the lambrequin, or mantling, that depends from the helmet and frames the shield in modern heraldry, began as a practical covering for the helmet and the back of the neck during the Crusades, serving much the same function as the surcoat.  Its slashed or scalloped edge, today rendered as billowing flourishes, is thought to have originated from hard wearing in the field, or as a means of deadening a sword blow and perhaps entangling the attacker's weapon.&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 17–18, 383.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heralds and heraldic authorities===
The spread of armorial bearings across Europe soon gave rise to a new occupation: the [[herald]], originally a type of messenger employed by noblemen, assumed the responsibility of learning and knowing the rank, pedigree, and heraldic devices of various knights and lords, as well as the rules and protocols governing the design and description, or ''blazoning'' of arms, and the precedence of their bearers.&lt;ref name="CGH 27–29"&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 27–29.&lt;/ref&gt;  As early as the late thirteenth century, certain heralds in the employ of monarchs were given the title "King of Heralds", which eventually became "[[King of Arms]]."&lt;ref name="CGH 27–29"/&gt;

[[File:Pursuivant.JPG|thumb|left|Two pursuivants wearing [[tabard]]s, [[Windsor Castle]], 2006.]]
In the earliest period, arms were assumed by their bearers without any need for heraldic authority.  However, by the middle of the fourteenth century, the principle that only a single individual was entitled to bear a particular coat of arms was generally accepted, and disputes over the ownership of arms seems to have led to gradual establishment of heraldic authorities to regulate their use.  The earliest known work of [[Law of Arms|heraldic jurisprudence]], ''De Insigniis et Armis'', was written about 1350 by [[Bartolus de Saxoferrato]], a professor of law at the [[University of Padua]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldica.org/topics/bartolo.htm ''De Insigniis et Armis'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George Squibb, "The Law of Arms in England", in ''The Coat of Arms'' vol. II, no. 15 (Spring 1953), p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;  The most celebrated armorial dispute in English heraldry is that of ''[[Scrope v Grosvenor]]'' (1390), in which two different men claimed the right to bear ''azure, a bend or''.&lt;ref name="CGH 21–22"&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt;  The continued proliferation of arms, and the number of disputes arising from different men assuming the same arms, led [[Henry V of England|Henry V]] to issue a proclamation in 1419, forbidding all those who had not borne arms at the [[Battle of Agincourt]] from assuming arms, except by inheritance or a grant from the crown.&lt;ref name="CGH 21–22"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woodward and Burnett, vol. 1, pp. 35–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the reign of [[Henry VIII]], the Kings of Arms were commanded to make ''[[heraldic visitation|visitations]]'', in which they traveled about the country, recording arms borne under proper authority, and requiring those who bore arms without authority either to obtain authority for them, or cease their use.  Arms borne improperly were to be taken down and defaced.  The first such visitation began in 1530, and the last was carried out in 1700, although no new commissions to carry out visitations were made after the accession of [[William III of England|William III]] in 1689.&lt;ref name="CGH 21–22"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Julian Franklyn, ''Shield and Crest: An Account of the Art and Science of Heraldry'', MacGibbon &amp; Kee, London (1960), p. 386.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1484, during the reign of [[Richard III of England|Richard III]], the various heralds employed by the crown were incorporated into the [[College of Arms]], through which all new grants of arms would eventually be issued.&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pastoureau 39–41"&gt;Pastoureau, pp. 39–41.&lt;/ref&gt;  The college currently consists of three Kings of Arms, assisted by six Heralds, and four [[Pursuivants]], or junior officers of arms, all under the authority of the [[Earl Marshal]]; but all of the arms granted by the college are granted by the authority of the crown.&lt;ref name="CoA Official Site"&gt;[http://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/about-us/heralds-officers College of Arms official website], accessed 3 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar bodies regulate the granting of arms in other monarchies and several members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], but in most other countries there is no heraldic authority, and no law preventing anyone from assuming whatever arms they please, provided that they do not infringe upon the arms of another.&lt;ref name="Pastoureau 39–41"/&gt;

===Later uses and developments===
Although heraldry originated from military necessity, it soon found itself at home in the pageantry of the [[tournament (medieval)|medieval tournament]].  The opportunity for knights and lords to display their heraldic bearings in a competitive medium led to further refinements, such as the development of elaborate tournament helms, and further popularized the art of heraldry throughout Europe.  Prominent burghers and corporations, including many cities and towns, assumed or obtained grants of arms, with only nominal military associations.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gwynn-Jones, ''The Art of Heraldry: Origins, Symbols, and Designs'', Parkgate Books/Barnes &amp; Noble (1998), pp. 18–20.&lt;/ref&gt;  Heraldic devices were depicted in various contexts, such as religious and funerary art, and in using a wide variety of media, including stonework, carved wood, [[vitreous enamel|enamel]], [[stained glass]], and [[embroidery]].&lt;ref&gt;Ottfried Neubecker, ''Heraldry: Sources, Symbols and Meaning'', Macdonald and James Publishers (1977), pp. 253–258.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the rise of firearms rendered the mounted knight increasingly irrelevant on the battlefield during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and the tournament faded into history, the military character of heraldry gave way to its use as a decorative art.  Freed from the limitations of actual shields and the need for arms to be easily distinguished in combat, heraldic artists designed increasingly elaborate achievements, culminating in the development of "landscape heraldry", incorporating realistic depictions of landscapes, during the latter part of the eighteenth and early part of the nineteenth century.  These fell out of fashion during the mid-nineteenth century, when a renewed interest in the history of armory led to the re-evaluation of earlier designs, and a new appreciation for the medieval origins of the art.&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 87–88.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gwynn-Jones, pp. 110–112.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the late nineteenth century, heraldry has focused on the use of varied lines of partition and little-used ordinaries to produce new and unique designs.&lt;ref&gt;Gwynn-Jones, pp. 113–121.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heraldic achievement==

===Elements of an achievement===
{{COA elements}}
A heraldic achievement consists of a [[escutcheon (heraldry)|shield of arms]], together with all of its accompanying elements, such as a [[crest (heraldry)|crest]], [[supporter]]s, and other heraldic embellishments.  The term "[[coat of arms]]" technically refers to the shield of arms itself, but the phrase is commonly used to refer to the entire achievement.  The one indispensable element of a coat of arms is the shield; many ancient coats of arms consist of nothing else, but no coat of arms exists without a shield.&lt;ref name="CGH 57–59"&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 57–59.&lt;/ref&gt;

From a very early date, illustrations of arms were frequently embellished with [[helmet (heraldry)|helmets]] placed above the shields.  These in turn came to be decorated with fan-shaped or sculptural crests, often incorporating elements from the shield of arms; as well as a wreath or [[torse]], or sometimes a [[coronet]], from which depended the lambrequin or [[mantling]].  To these elements, modern heraldry often adds a [[motto]] displayed on a ribbon, typically below the shield.  The helmet is borne of right, and forms no part of a grant of arms; it may be assumed without authority by anyone entitled to bear arms, together with mantling and whatever motto the armiger may desire.  The crest, however, together with the torse or coronet from which it arises, must be granted or confirmed by the relevant heraldic authority.&lt;ref name="CGH 57–59"/&gt;

If the bearer is entitled to the ribbon, collar, or badge of a knightly order, it may encircle or depend from the shield.  Some arms, particularly those of the nobility, are further embellished with supporters, heraldic figures standing alongside or behind the shield; often these stand on a [[compartment (heraldry)|compartment]], typically a mound of earth and grass, on which other [[heraldic badge|badges]], symbols, or [[heraldic flag|heraldic banners]] may be displayed.  The most elaborate achievements sometimes display the entire coat of arms beneath a pavilion, an embellished tent or canopy of the type associated with the medieval tournament.&lt;ref name="CGH 57–59"/&gt;

====Shield====
{{main article|Escutcheon (heraldry)}}
The primary element of an heraldic achievement is the shield, or escutcheon, upon which the coat of arms is depicted.{{efn-lr|Note that the term "coat of arms" is sometimes used to refer to the entire achievement, of which the shield is the central part.}}  All of the other elements of an achievement are designed to decorate and complement these arms, but only the shield of arms is required.&lt;ref name="CGH 57–61"&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 57, 60–61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aveling, ''Boutell's Heraldry'', p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Whitmore, ''The Elements of Heraldry'', Weathervane Books, New York (1968), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;  The shape of the shield, like many other details, is normally left to the discretion of the heraldic artist,{{efn-lr|There are exceptions to this rule, in which the shape of the escutcheon is specified in the blazon; for example, the [[coat of arms of Nunavut|arms of Nunavut]],&lt;ref&gt;Government of Nunavut. n.d.

One shape alone is normally reserved for a specific purpose: the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)#Lozenge|lozenge]], a diamond-shaped escutcheon, was traditionally used to display the arms of women, on the grounds that shields, as implements of war, were inappropriate for this purpose.&lt;ref name="CGH 57–61"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aveling, ''Boutell's Heraldry'', p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Slater, ''The Complete Book of Heraldry'', Hermes House, New York (2003), p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;  This distinction was not always strictly adhered to, and a general exception was usually made for sovereigns, whose arms represented an entire nation.  Sometimes an oval shield, or cartouche, was substituted for the lozenge; this shape was also widely used for the arms of clerics in French, Spanish, and Italian heraldry, although it was never reserved for their use.&lt;ref name="CGH 57–61"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Woodward 54–58"/&gt;  In recent years, the use of the cartouche for women's arms has become general in Scottish heraldry, while both Scottish and Irish authorities have permitted a traditional shield under certain circumstances, and in Canadian heraldry the shield is now regularly granted.&lt;ref&gt;Slater, p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;

The whole surface of the escutcheon is termed the [[field (heraldry)|field]], which may be plain, consisting of a single tincture, or divided into multiple sections of differing tinctures by various lines of partition; and any part of the field may be ''semé'', or powdered with small charges.&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 89, 96–98.&lt;/ref&gt;  The edges and adjacent parts of the escutcheon are used to identify the placement of various heraldic charges; the upper edge, and the corresponding upper third of the shield, are referred to as the chief; the lower part is the base.  The sides of the shield are known as the dexter and sinister flanks, although it is important to note that these terms are based on the point of view of the bearer of the shield, who would be standing behind it; accordingly the side which is to the bearer's right is the dexter, and the side to the bearer's left is the sinister, although to the observer, and in all heraldic illustration, the dexter is on the left side, and the sinister on the right.&lt;ref name="Boutell 8"&gt;Aveling, ''Boutell's Heraldry'', p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Woodward 59–60"&gt;Woodward and Burnett, vol. 1, pp. 59–60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CGH 104–105"&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 104–105.&lt;/ref&gt;

The placement of various charges may also refer to a number of specific points, nine in number according to some authorities, but eleven according to others.  The three most important are ''fess point'', located in the visual center of the shield;{{efn-lr|Because most shields are widest at the chief, and narrow to a point at the base, fess point is usually slightly higher than the midpoint.}} the ''honour point'', located midway between fess point and the chief; and the ''nombril point'', located midway between fess point and the base.&lt;ref name="Boutell 8"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Woodward 59–60"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CGH 104–105"/&gt;  The other points include ''dexter chief'', ''center chief'', and ''sinister chief'', running along the upper part of the shield from left to right, above the honour point; ''dexter flank'' and ''sinister flank'', on the sides approximately level with fess point; and ''dexter base'', ''middle base'', and ''sinister base'' along the lower part of the shield, below the nombril point.&lt;ref name="Boutell 8"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Woodward 59–60"/&gt;

====Tinctures====
&lt;!--[[File:tinctures.svg|left|upright|thumb|]]--&gt;
{{Main article|Tincture (heraldry)}}

One of the most distinctive qualities of heraldry is the use of a limited palette of colours and patterns, usually referred to as [[tincture (heraldry)|tinctures]].  These are divided into three categories, known as ''metals'', ''colours'', and ''furs''.{{efn-lr|Technically, the word ''tincture'' applies specifically to the colours, rather than to the metals or the furs; but for lack of another term including all three, it is regularly used in this extended sense.}}&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

The metals are ''or'' and ''argent'', representing gold and silver, respectively, although in practice they are usually depicted as yellow and white.  Five colours are universally recognized: ''gules'', or red; ''sable'', or black; ''azure'', or blue; ''vert'', or green; and ''purpure'', or purple; and most heraldic authorities also admit two additional colours, known as ''sanguine'' or ''murrey'', a dark red or mulberry colour between gules and purpure, and ''tenné'', an orange or dark yellow to brown colour.  These last two are quite rare, and are often referred to as ''stains'', from the belief that they were used to represent some dishonourable act, although in fact there is no evidence that this use existed outside the imagination of the more fanciful heraldic writers.&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 70–74.&lt;/ref&gt;  Perhaps owing to the realization that there is really no such thing as a ''stain'' in genuine heraldry, as well as the desire to create new and unique designs, the use of these colours for general purposes has become accepted in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.{{efn-lr|For instance, the arms of Lewes Old Grammar School, granted October 25, 2012: "Murrey within an Orle of eight Crosses crosslet Argent a Lion rampant Or holding in the forepaws a Book bound Azure the spine and the edges of the pages Gold" and those of Woolf, granted October 2, 2015: "Murrey a Snow Wolf's Head erased proper on a Chief Argent a Boar's Head coped at the neck between two Fleurs de Lys Azure."}}&lt;ref name="CoA Official Site"/&gt;  Occasionally one meets with other colours, particularly in continental heraldry, although they are not generally regarded among the standard heraldic colours.  Among these are ''cendrée'', or ash-colour; ''brunâtre'', or brown; ''bleu-céleste'' or ''bleu de ciel'', sky blue; ''amaranth'' or ''columbine'', a bright violet-red or pink colour; and ''carnation'', commonly used to represent flesh in French heraldry.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward and Burnett, vol. 1, pp. 61–62.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;  A more recent addition is the use of ''copper'' as a metal in one or two Canadian coats of arms.

There are two basic types of heraldic fur, known as [[Ermine (heraldry)|ermine]] and [[vair]], but over the course of centuries each has developed a number of variations.  Ermine represents the fur of the [[stoat]], a type of weasel, in its white winter coat, when it is called an ermine.  It consists of a white, or occasionally silver field, powdered with black figures known as ''ermine spots'', representing the black tip of the animal's tail.  Ermine was traditionally used to line the cloaks and caps of the nobility.  The shape of the heraldic ermine spot has varied considerably over time, and nowadays is typically drawn as an arrowhead surmounted by three small dots, but older forms may be employed at the artist's discretion.  When the field is sable and the ermine spots argent, the same pattern is termed ''ermines''; when the field is ''or'' rather than argent, the fur is termed ''erminois''; and when the field is sable and the ermine spots ''or'', it is termed ''pean''.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward and Burnett, vol. 1, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 77–79.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vair represents the winter coat of the [[red squirrel]], which is blue-grey on top and white underneath.  To form the linings of cloaks, the pelts were sewn together, forming an undulating, bell-shaped pattern, with interlocking light and dark rows.  The heraldic fur is depicted with interlocking rows of argent and azure, although the shape of the pelts, usually referred to as "vair bells", is usually left to the artist's discretion.  In the modern form, the bells are depicted with straight lines and sharp angles, and meet only at points; in the older, undulating pattern, now known as ''vair ondé'' or ''vair ancien'', the bells of each tincture are curved and joined at the base.  There is no fixed rule as to whether the argent bells should be at the top or the bottom of each row.  At one time vair commonly came in three sizes, and this distinction is sometimes encountered in continental heraldry; if the field contains fewer than four rows, the fur is termed ''gros vair'' or ''beffroi''; if of six or more, it is ''menu-vair'', or miniver.&lt;ref name="CGH 79–83"&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 79–83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Innes of Learney|Thomas Innes]], ''Scots Heraldry'', Johnston &amp; Bacon, London (1978), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

A common variation is ''counter-vair'', in which alternating rows are reversed, so that the bases of the vair bells of each tincture are joined to those of the same tincture in the row above or below.  When the rows are arranged so that the bells of each tincture form vertical columns, it is termed ''vair in pale''; in continental heraldry one may encounter ''vair in bend'', which is similar to vair in pale, but diagonal.  When alternating rows are reversed as in counter-vair, and then displaced by half the width of one bell, it is termed ''vair in point'', or wave-vair.  A form peculiar to German heraldry is ''alternate vair'', in which each vair bell is divided in half vertically, with half argent and half azure.&lt;ref name="CGH 79–83"/&gt;  All of these variations can also be depicted in the form known as ''potent'', in which the shape of the vair bell is replaced by a ''T''-shaped figure, known as a potent from its resemblance to a crutch.  Although it is really just a variation of vair, it is frequently treated as a separate fur.&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 84–85.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the same patterns are composed of tinctures other than argent and azure, they are termed ''vairé'' or ''vairy'' of those tinctures, rather than ''vair''; ''potenté'' of other colours may also be found.  Usually vairé will consist of one metal and one colour, but ermine or one of its variations may also be used, and vairé of four tinctures, usually two metals and two colours, is sometimes found.&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 80–85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Three additional furs are sometimes encountered in continental heraldry; in French and Italian heraldry one meets with ''plumeté'' or ''plumetty'', in which the field appears to be covered with feathers, and ''papelonné'', in which it is decorated with scales.  In German heraldry one may encounter ''kursch'', or vair bellies, depicted as brown and furry; all of these probably originated as variations of vair.&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 83–85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Considerable latitude is given to the heraldic artist in depicting the heraldic tinctures; there is no fixed shade or hue to any of them.{{efn-lr|"There are no fixed shades for heraldic colours. If the official description of a coat of arms gives its tinctures as Gules (red), Azure (blue) and Argent (white or silver) then, as long as the blue is not too light and the red not too orange, purple or pink, it is up to the artist to decide which particular shades they think are appropriate."}}&lt;ref name="CoA Official Site"/&gt;

Whenever an object is depicted as it appears in nature, rather than in one or more of the heraldic tinctures, it is termed ''proper'', or the colour of nature.  This does not seem to have been done in the earliest heraldry, but examples are known from at least the seventeenth century.  While there can be no objection to the occasional depiction of objects in this manner, the overuse of charges in their natural colours is often cited as indicative of bad heraldic practice.  The much-maligned practice of landscape heraldry, which flourished in the latter part of the eighteenth and early part of the nineteenth century, made extensive use of such non-heraldic colours.&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 75, 87–88.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most important conventions of heraldry is the so-called "[[rule of tincture]]".  To provide for contrast and visibility, metals should never be placed on metals, and colours should never be placed on colours.  This rule does not apply to charges which cross a division of the field, which is partly metal and partly colour; nor, strictly speaking, does it prevent a field from consisting of two metals or two colours, although this is unusual.  Furs are considered amphibious, and neither metal nor colour; but in practice ermine and erminois are usually treated as metals, while ermines and pean are treated as colours.  This rule is strictly adhered to in British armory, with only rare exceptions; although generally observed in continental heraldry, it is not adhered to quite as strictly.  Arms which violate this rule are sometimes known as "puzzle arms", of which the most famous example is the arms of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], consisting of gold crosses on a silver field.&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 85–87.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruno Heim, ''Or and Argent'', Gerrards Cross, Buckingham (1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Variations of the field====
{{Main article|Variation of the field}}

The [[Field (heraldry)|field]] of a shield, or less often a charge or crest, is sometimes made up of a pattern of colours, or ''variation''. A pattern of horizontal (barwise) stripes, for example, is called ''barry'', while a pattern of vertical (palewise) stripes is called ''paly''. A pattern of diagonal stripes may be called ''bendy'' or ''bendy sinister'', depending on the direction of the stripes. Other variations include ''chevrony'', ''gyronny'' and ''chequy''. Wave shaped stripes are termed ''undy''. For further variations, these are sometimes combined to produce patterns of ''barry-bendy'', ''paly-bendy'', ''lozengy'' and ''fusilly''. Semés, or patterns of repeated charges, are also considered variations of the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Arthur Charles|last=Fox-Davies|title=A Complete Guide to Heraldry|isbn=1-4179-0630-8|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|year=2004|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Rule of tincture]] applies to all semés and variations of the field.

====Divisions of the field====
[[File:Varpaisjärvi.vaakuna.svg|right|upright|thumb|upright=0.45|A shield parted per pale and per fir twig fess]]
{{main article|Division of the field}}

The [[Field (heraldry)|field]] of a [[shield]] in heraldry can be divided into more than one [[Tincture (heraldry)|tincture]], as can the various [[Charge (heraldry)|heraldic charge]]s. Many coats of arms consist simply of a division of the field into two contrasting tinctures. These are considered divisions of a shield, so the rule of tincture can be ignored. For example, a shield divided azure and gules would be perfectly acceptable. A line of partition may be straight or it may be varied. The variations of partition lines can be wavy, indented, embattled, engrailed, [[nebuly]], or made into myriad other forms; see [[Line (heraldry)]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Friar and John Ferguson. ''Basic Heraldry''. (W.W. Norton &amp; Company, New York: 1993), 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ordinaries====
{{Main article|Ordinary (heraldry)}}

In the early days of heraldry, very simple bold rectilinear shapes were painted on shields. These could be easily recognized at a long distance and could be easily remembered. They therefore served the main purpose of heraldry: identification.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl-Alexander von Volborth]]. ''Heraldry: Customs, Rules, and Styles''. (Blandford Press, Dorset: 1981), 18.&lt;/ref&gt; As more complicated shields came into use, these bold shapes were set apart in a separate class as the "honorable ordinaries". They act as charges and are always written first in [[blazon]]. Unless otherwise specified they extend to the edges of the field. Though ordinaries are not easily defined, they are generally described as including the [[cross]], the [[fess]], the [[pale (heraldry)|pale]], the [[bend (heraldry)|bend]], the [[chevron (insignia)|chevron]], the [[saltire]], and the [[Pall (heraldry)|pall]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Friar, Ed. ''A Dictionary of Heraldry''. (Harmony Books, New York: 1987), 259.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a separate class of charges called sub-ordinaries which are of a geometrical shape subordinate to the ordinary. According to Friar, they are distinguished by their order in blazon. The sub-ordinaries include the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|inescutcheon]], the [[Ordinary (heraldry)#Subordinaries|orle]], the tressure, the double tressure, the [[bordure]], the [[chief (heraldry)|chief]], the [[Canton (heraldry)|canton]], the [[label (heraldry)|label]], and [[flaunch]]es.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Friar, Ed. ''A Dictionary of Heraldry''. (Harmony Books, New York: 1987), 330.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ordinaries may appear in parallel series, in which case blazons in English give them different names such as pallets, bars, bendlets, and chevronels. French blazon makes no such distinction between these diminutives and the ordinaries when borne singly. Unless otherwise specified an ordinary is drawn with straight lines, but each may be indented, embattled, wavy, engrailed, or otherwise have their lines varied.&lt;ref&gt;Woodcock, Thomas &amp; John Martin Robinson. ''The Oxford Guide to Heraldry''. (Oxford University Press, New York: 1988), 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Charges====
{{Main article|Charge (heraldry)}}

A charge is any object or figure placed on a heraldic shield or on any other object of an armorial composition.&lt;ref&gt;John Brooke-Little. ''Boutell's Heraldry''. (Frederick Warne &amp; Company, London: 1973), 311.&lt;/ref&gt; Any object found in nature or technology may appear as a heraldic charge in armory. Charges can be animals, objects, or geometric shapes. Apart from the ordinaries, the most frequent charges are the [[cross]] &amp;ndash; with its hundreds of variations &amp;ndash; and the [[Lion (heraldry)|lion]] and [[Eagle (heraldry)|eagle]]. Other common animals are [[Deer|stags]], [[wild boar]]s, [[martlet]]s, and [[fish]]. [[European dragon|Dragons]], [[bat#The bat in heraldry|bats]], [[unicorn]]s, [[griffin]]s, and more exotic monsters appear as charges and as [[supporters]].

Animals are found in various stereotyped positions or ''[[Attitude (heraldry)|attitudes]]''. [[Quadruped]]s can often be found rampant (standing on the left hind foot). Another frequent position is [[Passant guardant|passant]], or walking, like the lions of the [[coat of arms of England]]. Eagles are almost always shown with their wings spread, or displayed. A pair of wings conjoined is called a [[vol (heraldry)|vol]].

In [[English heraldry]] the [[crescent]], [[mullet (heraldry)|mullet]], [[martlet]], [[annulet (heraldry)|annulet]], [[fleur-de-lis]], and [[rose (heraldry)|rose]] may be added to a shield to distinguish [[cadency|cadet]] branches of a family from the senior line. These cadency marks are usually shown smaller than normal charges, but it still does not follow that a shield containing such a charge belongs to a cadet branch. All of these charges occur frequently in basic undifferenced coats of arms.&lt;ref&gt;[[Iain Moncreiffe of that Ilk]] and [[Don Pottinger]]. ''Simple Heraldry, Cheerfully Illustrated''. (Thomas Nelson and Sons, London: 1953), 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Marshalling====
[[File:Stowe Armorial.jpg|thumb|An extravagant example of marshalling: the 719 quarterings of the [[George Nugent-Temple-Grenville, 1st Marquess of Buckingham|Grenville]] [[Roll of arms|Armorial]] at [[Stowe House|Stowe]].]]

To ''marshal'' two or more coats of arms is to combine them in one shield, to express inheritance, claims to property, or the occupation of an office. This can be done in a number of ways, of which the simplest is [[Impalement (heraldry)|impalement]]: [[division of the field|dividing the field]] ''per pale'' and putting one whole coat in each half. Impalement replaced the earlier [[dimidiation]] &amp;ndash; combining the dexter half of one coat with the sinister half of another &amp;ndash; because dimidiation can create ambiguity between, for example, a [[bend (heraldry)|bend]] and a [[Chevron (insignia)|chevron]]. "Dexter" (from Latin ''dextra'', right) means to the right from the viewpoint of the bearer of the arms and "sinister" (from Latin ''sinistra'', left) means to the left. The dexter side is considered the side of greatest [[honour]] (see also [[Dexter and sinister]]).

A more versatile method is [[Quartering (heraldry)|quartering]], division of the field by both vertical and horizontal lines. This practice originated in Spain ([[Coat of arms of Castile and León|Castile and León]]) after the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Woodcock &amp; John Martin Robinson. ''The Oxford Guide to Heraldry''. (Oxford University Press, New York: 1988), 14.&lt;/ref&gt; As the name implies, the usual number of divisions is four, but the principle has been extended to very large numbers of "quarters".

Quarters are numbered from the dexter chief (the corner nearest to the right shoulder of a man standing behind the shield), proceeding across the top row, and then across the next row and so on. When three coats are quartered, the first is repeated as the fourth; when only two coats are quartered, the second is also repeated as the third. The quarters of a personal coat of arms correspond to the ancestors from whom the bearer has inherited arms, normally in the same sequence as if the pedigree were laid out with the father's father's ... father (to as many generations as necessary) on the extreme left and the mother's mother's...mother on the extreme right.  A few lineages have accumulated hundreds of quarters, though such a number is usually displayed only in documentary contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Edmundas Rimša. ''Heraldry Past to Present''. (Versus Aureus, Vilnius: 2005), 38.&lt;/ref&gt; The Scottish and Spanish traditions resist allowing more than four quarters, preferring to subdivide one or more "grand quarters" into sub-quarters as needed.

The third common mode of marshalling is with an [[inescutcheon]], a small shield placed in front of the main shield. In Britain this is most often an "escutcheon of pretence" indicating, in the arms of a married couple, that the wife is an heraldic heiress (i.e., she inherits a coat of arms because she has no brothers). In continental Europe an inescutcheon (sometimes called a "heart shield") usually carries the ancestral arms of a monarch or noble whose domains are represented by the quarters of the main shield.

In [[German heraldry]], animate [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]s in combined coats usually turn to face the centre of the composition.

===Helm and crest===
[[File:Wappen Deutsches Reich - Herzogtum Sachsen-Altenburg (Grosses).png|upright|thumb|German heraldry has examples of shields with numerous crests, as this arms of [[Saxe-Altenburg]] featuring a total of seven crests. Some [[thaler]] coins display as many as fifteen.]]
{{Main article|Helmet (heraldry)|Crest (heraldry)}}

In [[English language|English]] the word "crest" is commonly (but erroneously) used to refer to an entire heraldic achievement of armorial bearings. The technical use of the heraldic term [[crest (heraldry)|crest]] refers to just one component of a complete achievement. The crest rests on top of a [[Helmet (heraldry)|helmet]] which itself rests on the most important part of the achievement: the shield.

The modern crest has grown out of the three-dimensional figure placed on the top of the mounted knights' helms as a further means of identification. In most heraldic traditions, a woman does not display a crest, though this tradition is being relaxed in some heraldic jurisdictions, and the stall plate of Lady Marion Fraser in the Thistle Chapel in St Giles, Edinburgh, shows her coat on a lozenge but with helmet, crest, and motto.

The crest is usually found on a [[torse|wreath]] of twisted cloth and sometimes within a [[coronet]]. Crest-coronets are generally simpler than coronets of rank, but several specialized forms exist; for example, in [[Canada]], descendants of the [[United Empire Loyalist]]s are entitled to use a [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] military coronet (for descendants of members of Loyalist regiments) or Loyalist civil coronet (for others).

When the helm and crest are shown, they are usually accompanied by a [[mantling]]. This was originally a cloth worn over the back of the helmet as partial protection against heating by sunlight. Today it takes the form of a stylized cloak hanging from the helmet.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Gwynn-Jones]]. ''The Art of Heraldry''. (Parkgate Books, London: 1998), 124.&lt;/ref&gt; Typically in British heraldry, the outer surface of the mantling is of the principal colour in the shield and the inner surface is of the principal metal, though peers in the United Kingdom use standard colourings (Gules doubled Argent - Red/White) regardless of rank or the colourings of their arms. The mantling is sometimes conventionally depicted with a ragged edge, as if damaged in combat, though the edges of most are simply decorated at the emblazoner's discretion.

Clergy often refrain from displaying a helm or crest in their [[Ecclesiastical heraldry|heraldic achievements]]. Members of the clergy may display appropriate headwear. This often takes the form of a small crowned, wide brimmed hat called a [[galero]] with the colours and tassels denoting rank; or, in the case of [[Papal coats of arms]] until the inauguration of [[Pope Benedict XVI]] in 2005, an elaborate triple crown known as a [[tiara]]. Benedict broke with tradition to substitute a [[mitre]] in [[Coat of arms of Pope Benedict XVI|his arms]]. Orthodox and Presbyterian clergy do sometimes adopt other forms of head gear to ensign their shields. In the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] tradition, clergy members may pass crests on to their offspring, but rarely display them on their own shields.

===Mottoes===
An armorial [[motto]] is a phrase or collection of words intended to describe the motivation or intention of the armigerous person or corporation. This can form a pun on the family name as in [[Thomas Nevile]]'s motto ''Ne vile velis''. Mottoes are generally changed at will and do not make up an integral part of the armorial achievement. Mottoes can typically be found on a scroll under the shield. In [[Scottish heraldry]], where the motto is granted as part of the [[blazon]], it is usually shown on a scroll above the crest, and may not be changed at will. A motto may be in any language.

===Supporters and other insignia===
[[File:Coat of Arms of Baldomero Espartero, Prince of Vergara.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Flags as supporters and orders in the armory of the [[Baldomero Espartero, Prince of Vergara|Prince of Vergara]].]]

[[Supporters]] are human or animal figures or, very rarely, inanimate objects, usually placed on either side of a coat of arms as though supporting it. In many traditions, these have acquired strict guidelines for use by certain social classes. On the [[Continental Europe|European continent]], there are often fewer restrictions on the use of supporters.&lt;ref&gt;Ottfried Neubecker. ''Heraldry: Sources, Symbols, and Meaning''. (Tiger Books International, London: 1997), 186.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, only [[Peer of the realm|peers of the realm]], a few baronets, senior members of orders of knighthood, and some corporate bodies are granted supporters. Often, these can have local significance or a historical link to the armiger.

If the armiger has the title of [[baron]], hereditary [[knight]], or higher, he may display a coronet of rank above the shield. In the United Kingdom, this is shown between the shield and helmet, though it is often above the crest in Continental heraldry.

Another addition that can be made to a coat of arms is the insignia of a baronet or of an order of knighthood. This is usually represented by a collar or similar band surrounding the shield. When the arms of a knight and his wife are shown in one achievement, the insignia of knighthood surround the husband's arms only, and the wife's arms are customarily surrounded by an ornamental garland of leaves for visual balance.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Franklyn. ''Shield and Crest''. (MacGibbon &amp; Kee, London: 1960), 358.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Differencing and cadency===
{{Main article|Cadency}}
Since arms pass from parents to offspring, and there is frequently more than one child per couple, it is necessary to distinguish the arms of siblings and extended family members from the original arms as passed on from eldest son to eldest son. Over time several schemes have been used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baronage.co.uk/jag-ht/jag008.html |title=Baronage.co.uk |publisher=Baronage.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blazon===
{{Main article|Blazon}}
To "blazon" arms means to describe them using the formal language of heraldry. This language has its own vocabulary and [[syntax]], or rules governing word order, which becomes essential for comprehension when blazoning a complex coat of arms. The verb comes from the [[Middle English]] ''blasoun'', itself a derivative of the French ''blason'' meaning "shield". The system of [[blazon]]ing arms used in [[English language|English-speaking]] countries today was developed by heraldic officers in the [[Middle Ages]]. The blazon includes a description of the arms contained within the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] or shield, the [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]], [[supporters (heraldry)|supporters]] where present, [[motto]] and other insignia. Complex rules, such as the [[rule of tincture]], apply to the physical and artistic form of newly created arms, and a thorough understanding of these rules is essential to the art of heraldry. Though heraldic forms initially were broadly similar across Europe, several national styles had developed by the end of the [[Middle Ages]], and artistic and blazoning styles today range from the very simple to extraordinarily complex.

==National styles==
The emergence of heraldry occurred across [[western Europe]] almost simultaneously in the various countries. Originally, heraldic style was very similar from country to country.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, T. R. (Spring 1976). "Did National Heraldry Exist?". ''The Coat of Arms'' '''NS II''' (97): 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, heraldic tradition diverged into four broad styles: German-Nordic, Gallo-British, Latin, and Eastern.&lt;ref&gt;von Warnstedt, Christopher. (October 1970). "The Heraldic Provinces of Europe". ''The Coat of Arms'' '''XI''' (84): 128.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition it can be argued that newer national heraldic traditions, such as [[South Africa]]n and Canadian, have emerged in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Beddoe, revised by Strome Galloway. ''Beddoe's Canadian Heraldry''. (Mika Publishing Company, Belleville: 1981).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Central and Northern European heraldry===
{{Main article|Czech heraldry|Danish heraldry|Finnish heraldry|German heraldry|Icelandic heraldry|Norwegian heraldry|Swedish heraldry}}

Coats of arms in Germany, the [[Nordic countries]], [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Czech lands]] and northern [[Switzerland]] generally change very little over time. Marks of difference are very rare in this tradition as are heraldic furs.&lt;ref name="Warnstedt, Christopher 1970"&gt;von Warnstedt, Christopher. (October 1970). "The Heraldic Provinces of Europe". ''The Coat of Arms'' '''XI''' (84): 129.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most striking characteristics of German-Nordic heraldry is the treatment of the crest. Often, the same design is repeated in the shield and the crest. The use of multiple crests is also common.&lt;ref name="OGH-15"&gt;Thomas Woodcock &amp; John Martin Robinson. ''The Oxford Guide to Heraldry''. (Oxford University Press, New York: 1988), 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The crest is rarely used separately as in British heraldry, but can sometimes serve as a mark of difference between different branches of a family.&lt;ref&gt;Neubecker, Ottfried. ''Heraldry. Sources, Symbols and Meaning'' (London 1976), p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; [[Torse]] is optional.&lt;ref&gt;Pinches, J. H.: European Nobility and Heraldry. (Heraldry Today, 1994, {{ISBN|0-900455-45-4}}, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; Heraldic courtoisie is observed: that is, charges in a composite shield (or two shields displayed together) usually turn to face the centre.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl-Alexander von Volborth]]. Heraldry: Customs, Rules, and Styles. (Blandford Press, Dorset: 1981), p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

Coats consisting only of a [[Division of the field|divided field]] are somewhat more frequent in Germany than elsewhere.

===Dutch heraldry===
{{Main article|Dutch heraldry}}

The [[Low Countries]] were great centres of heraldry in medieval times. One of the famous armorials is the [[Gelre Armorial]] or ''Wapenboek'', written between 1370 and 1414.
Coats of arms in the [[Netherlands]] were not controlled by an official heraldic system like the two in the United Kingdom, nor were they used solely by [[Nobility|noble families]]. Any person could develop and use a coat of arms if they wished to do so, provided they did not usurp someone else's arms, and historically, this right was enshrined in [[Roman Dutch law]].&lt;ref&gt;J. A. de Boo. ''Familiewapens, oud en nieuw. Een inleiding tot de Familieheraldiek.'' (Centraal Bureau voor Genealogie, [[The Hague]]: 1977)&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, many merchant families had coats of arms even though they were not members of the nobility. These are sometimes referred to as ''[[burgher arms]],'' and it is thought that most arms of this type were adopted while the Netherlands was a [[Dutch Republic|republic]] (1581–1806).{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} This heraldic tradition was also exported to the erstwhile [[South African heraldry|Dutch colonies]].&lt;ref name="AHS"&gt;[http://americanheraldry.org/pages/index.php?n=President.Roosevelt Roosevelt Coats of Arms: Theodore and Franklin Delano] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017052446/http://americanheraldry.org/pages/index.php?n=President.Roosevelt |date=2007-10-17 }} at American Heraldry Society. Accessed January 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dutch heraldry is characterised by its simple and rather sober style, and in this sense, is closer to its medieval origins than the elaborate styles which developed in other heraldic traditions.&lt;ref name="CP"&gt;Cornelius Pama ''Heraldiek in Suid-Afrika''. (Balkema, Cape Town: 1956).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gallo-British heraldry===
{{Main article|American heraldry|Canadian heraldry|Cornish heraldry|English heraldry|French heraldry|Irish heraldry|Scottish heraldry|Welsh heraldry}}

The use of cadency marks to difference arms within the same family and the use of [[semy]] fields are distinctive features of Gallo-British heraldry (in Scotland the most significant mark of cadency being the bordure, the small brisures playing a very minor role). It is common to see heraldic furs used.&lt;ref name="Warnstedt, Christopher 1970"/&gt; In the United Kingdom, the style is notably still controlled by royal officers of arms.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl-Alexander von Volborth]]. ''Heraldry of the World''. (Blandford Press, Dorset: 1979), 192.&lt;/ref&gt; French heraldry experienced a period of strict rules of construction under [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Woodcock &amp; John Martin Robinson. ''The Oxford Guide to Heraldry''. (Oxford University Press, New York: 1988), 21.&lt;/ref&gt; English and Scots heraldries make greater use of supporters than other European countries.&lt;ref name="OGH-15"/&gt;

Furs, chevrons and five-pointed stars are more frequent in France and Britain than elsewhere.

===Latin heraldry===
{{Main article|Papal coats of arms|Portuguese heraldry|Spanish heraldry|Brazilian heraldry}}

The heraldry of [[southern France]], [[Andorra]], [[Spain]], and [[Italy]] is characterized by a lack of crests, and uniquely shaped shields. Portuguese heraldry, however, does use crests.&lt;ref&gt;von Warnstedt, Christopher. (October 1970). "The Heraldic Provinces of Europe". ''The Coat of Arms'' '''XI''' (84): p.129.&lt;/ref&gt; Portuguese and Spanish heraldry occasionally introduce words to the shield of arms, a practice usually avoided in British heraldry. Latin heraldry is known for extensive use of quartering, because of armorial inheritance via the male and the female lines. Moreover, Italian heraldry is dominated by the Roman Catholic Church, featuring many shields and achievements, most bearing some reference to the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Woodcock &amp; John Martin Robinson. ''The Oxford Guide to Heraldry''. (Oxford University Press, New York: 1988), pp.24-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Trees are frequent charges in Latin arms. Charged bordures, including bordures inscribed with words, are seen often in Spain.

===Central and Eastern European heraldry===
[[File:Turiec.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Coat of Arms of the [[Turiec]] county in [[Slovakia]].]]
{{Main article|Polish heraldry|Hungarian heraldry|Serbian heraldry|Belarusian heraldry|Russian heraldry}}
Eastern European heraldry is in the traditions developed in [[Belarus]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Serbia]], [[Croatia]], [[Hungary]], [[Romania]], [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]], [[Poland]], [[Slovakia]], [[Ukraine]], and [[Russia]]. Eastern coats of arms are characterized by a pronounced, territorial, [[clan]] system &amp;ndash; often, entire villages or military groups were granted the same coat of arms irrespective of family relationships. In Poland, nearly six hundred unrelated families are known to bear the same [[Jastrzębiec coat of arms]]. Marks of cadency are almost unknown, and shields are generally very simple, with only one charge. Many heraldic shields derive from ancient [[house mark]]s. At the least, fifteen per cent of all Hungarian personal arms bear a severed Turk's head, referring to their wars against the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;von Warnstedt, Christopher. (October 1970). "The Heraldic Provinces of Europe". ''The Coat of Arms'' '''XI''' (84): pp.129-30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Woodcock &amp; John Martin Robinson. ''The Oxford Guide to Heraldry''. (Oxford University Press, New York: 1988), 28-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quasi-heraldic emblems==
True heraldry, as now generally understood, has its roots in medieval Europe. However, there have been other historical cultures which have used symbols and emblems to represent families or individuals, and in some cases these symbols have been adopted into Western heraldry. For example, the [[coat of arms of the Ottoman Empire]] incorporated the royal [[tughra]] as part of its [[crest (heraldry)|crest]], along with such traditional Western heraldic elements as the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] and the [[Compartment (heraldry)|compartment]].

===Greek symbols===
Ancient Greeks were among the first civilizations to use symbols consistently in order to identify a warrior, clan or a state.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} The first record of a shield blazon is illustrated in [[Aeschylus]]' tragedy ''[[Seven Against Thebes]]''. The Greek Heraldry Society is a useful source of information on Hellenic Heraldry and Byzantine etiquette.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://greekheraldry.com/ |title=Greek Heraldry Society |publisher=Greekheraldry.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mon===
{{Main article|Mon (emblem)}}
{{nihongo|'''Mon'''|紋|}}, also {{nihongo|'''monshō'''|紋章|}}, {{nihongo|'''mondokoro'''|紋所|}}, and {{nihongo|'''kamon'''|家紋|}}, are [[Japan]]ese emblems used to decorate and identify an individual or family. While ''mon'' is an encompassing term that may refer to any such device, ''kamon'' and ''mondokoro'' refer specifically to emblems used to identify a family.{{Elucidate|reason=This is the same as previously stated, so what is the difference with mon and monshō? |date=February 2016}} An authoritative ''mon'' reference compiles Japan's 241 general categories of ''mon'' based on structural resemblance (a single ''mon'' may belong to multiple categories), with 5116 distinct individual ''mon'' (it is however well acknowledged that there exist lost or obscure ''mon'' that are not in this compilation).&lt;ref&gt;日本の家紋大全 梧桐書院 {{ISBN|434003102X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Some 6939 ''mon'' are [https://x181.secure.ne.jp/~x181007/kamon/goodslist.cgi listed here].&lt;/ref&gt;

The devices are similar to the [[Heraldic badge|badges]] and [[Coat of arms|coats of arms]] in European heraldic tradition, which likewise are used to identify individuals and families.  ''Mon'' are often referred to as [[Crest (heraldry)|crests]] in Western literature, another European heraldic device similar to the ''mon'' in function.

===Socialist heraldry===
{{Main article|Socialist heraldry}}
'''Socialist heraldry''', also called '''communist heraldry''', consists of emblems in a style typically adopted by [[communist state]]s and filled with [[communist symbolism]]. Although commonly called ''[[coat of arms|coats of arms]]'', most such devices are not actually coats of arms in the traditional heraldic sense and should therefore, in a strict sense, not be called arms at all.&lt;ref name="von Volborth"&gt;{{cite book |last= von Volborth|first= Carl-Alexander|author-link1= Carl-Alexander von Volborth|date= 1981|title= Heraldry – Customs, Rules and Styles|location= Ware, Hertfordshire|publisher= Omega Books Ltd.|page= 11|isbn= 0-907853-47-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many communist governments purposely diverged from the traditional forms of [[European heraldry]] in order to distance themselves from the [[monarchy|monarchies]] that they usually replaced, with actual coats of arms being seen as symbols of the monarchs.

The [[Soviet Union]] was the first state to use socialist heraldry, beginning at its creation in 1922. The style became more widespread after [[World War II]], when many other communist states were established. Even a few non-socialist states have adopted the style, for various reasons—usually because [[Wars of national liberation|communists had helped them to gain independence]]—but also when no apparent connection to a Communist nation exists, such as the [[emblem of Italy]].&lt;ref name="von Volborth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="von Volborth 1972"&gt;{{cite book |last= von Volborth|first= Carl-Alexander|author-link1= Carl-Alexander von Volborth| date= 1972 | title= Alverdens heraldik i farver | language=Danish | others=Editor and translator from English to Danish: [[Sven Tito Achen]] | location= Copenhagen | publisher=Politikens Forlag |page= 158|isbn= 87 567 1685 0}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the fall of the Soviet Union and the other communist states in Eastern Europe in 1989–1991, this style of heraldry was often abandoned for the old heraldic practices, with many (but not all) of the new governments reinstating the traditional heraldry that was previously cast aside.

===Tamgas===
{{Main article|Tamga}}
A '''tamga''' or '''tamgha''' "stamp, seal" ({{lang-mn|тамга}}, [[turkic languages|Turkic:]] tamga) is an abstract [[Seal (emblem)|seal]] or [[Seal (emblem)|stamp]] used by [[Eurasian nomad]]ic peoples and by cultures influenced by them. The tamga was normally the emblem of a particular tribe, clan or family. They were common among the Eurasian nomads throughout Classical Antiquity and the Middle Ages (including [[Alans]], [[Mongols]], [[Sarmatians]], [[Scythians]] and [[Turkic peoples]]). Similar "tamga-like" symbols were sometimes also adopted by sedentary peoples adjacent to the Pontic-Caspian steppe both in [[Eastern Europe]] and [[Central Asia]],&lt;ref&gt;Ottfried Neubecker. ''Heraldik''. Orbis, 2002; Brook 154; Franklin and Shepard 120-121; Pritsak 78-79.&lt;/ref&gt; such as the [[East Slavs]], whose ancient [[Symbols of the Rurikids|royal symbols]] are sometimes referred to as "tamgas" and have similar appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ru/books?id=LMwmcqwZUGcC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;lpg=PA36&amp;dq=rurikid+tamga&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OZoyQCrJDu&amp;sig=2nASSscIJn6WshI6ORaX5PoWiuI&amp;hl=ru&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj6ifi2sqPNAhXkNJoKHYB7DrEQ6AEIRDAF#v=onepage&amp;q=rurikid%20tamga&amp;f=false|title = Pre-modern Russia and Its World: Essays in Honor of Thomas S. Noonan | accessdate = 2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike European coats of arms, tamgas were not always inherited, and could stand for families or clans (for example, when denoting territory, livestock, or religious items) as well as for specific individuals (such as when used for weapons, or for royal [[seal (emblem)|seals]]). One could also adopt the tamga of one's master or ruler, therefore signifying said master's patronage. Outside of denoting ownership, tamgas also possessed religious significance, and were used as [[talisman]]s to protect one from curses (it was believed that, as symbols of family, tamgas embodied the power of one's heritage). Tamgas depicted geometric shapes, images of animals, items, or [[glyph]]s. As they were usually inscribed using heavy and unwieldy instruments, such as knives or brands, and on different surfaces (meaning that their appearance could vary somewhat), tamgas were always simple and stylised, and needed to be laconic and easily recognisable.&lt;ref&gt;ТАМГА (к функции знака). В.С. Ольховский (Историко-археологический альманах, No 7, Армавир, 2001, стр. 75-86)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tughras===
{{Main article|Tughra}}
{{Further information|Coat of arms of the Ottoman Empire}}
Every sultan of the Ottoman Empire had his own monogram, called the tughra, which served as a royal symbol. A coat of arms in the European heraldic sense was created in the late 19th century. Hampton Court requested from Ottoman Empire the coat of arms to be included in their collection. As the coat of arms had not been previously used in Ottoman Empire, it was designed after this request and the final design was adopted by Sultan Abdul Hamid II on April 17, 1882. It included two flags: the flag of the Ottoman Dynasty, which had a crescent and a star on red base, and the flag of the Islamic Caliph, which had three crescents on a green base.

==Modern heraldry==
[[File:Stenungsund vapen.svg|thumb|upright=0.6|Arms created in 1977, featuring a hydrocarbon molecule]]
[[File:052-ADA-Rgmt-COA.png|thumb|upright=0.45|Military coat of arms, depicting a red locomotive.]]
Heraldry flourishes in the modern world; institutions, companies, and private persons continue using coats of arms as their pictorial identification. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, the English [[King of Arms|Kings of Arms]], Scotland's [[Lord Lyon King of Arms]], and the [[Office of the Chief Herald of Ireland|Chief Herald of Ireland]] continue making grants of arms.&lt;ref&gt;See the [http://college-of-arms.gov.uk/#newsletter College of Arms newsletter] for quarterly samplings of English grants and the [http://www.nli.ie/h_arms1999.htm Chief Herald of Ireland's webpage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004045906/http://www.nli.ie/h_arms1999.htm |date=2006-10-04 }} for recent Irish grants.&lt;/ref&gt; There are heraldic authorities in [[Public Register of Arms, Flags and Badges of Canada|Canada]],&lt;ref&gt;See the [http://reg.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/main.asp?lang=e Public Register of Arms, Flags and Badges of Canada].&lt;/ref&gt; South Africa, Spain, and Sweden that grant or register coats of arms. In [[South African heraldry|South Africa]], the right to armorial bearings is also determined by [[Roman Dutch law]], due to its origins as a 17th-century colony of the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;Cornelius Pama. ''Heraldry of South African families: coats of arms/crests/ancestry.'' (Balkema, Cape Town: 1972)&lt;/ref&gt;

Heraldic societies abound in Africa, Asia, Australasia, the Americas and Europe. Heraldry aficionados participate in the [[Society for Creative Anachronism]], medieval revivals, [[micronation]]s and other related projects. Modern armigers use heraldry to express ancestral and personal heritage as well as professional, academic, civic, and national pride. Little is left of class identification in modern heraldry, where the emphasis is more than ever on expression of identity.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Slater. ''The Complete Book of Heraldry''. (Hermes House, New York: 2003), p.238.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heraldry continues to build on its rich tradition in [[academia]], [[government]], guilds and [[professional associations]], religious institutions, and the military. Nations and their subdivisions &amp;ndash; provinces, states, counties, cities, etc. &amp;ndash; continue to build on the traditions of civic heraldry. The [[Roman Catholic Church]], [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] churches, and other religious institutions maintain the traditions of [[ecclesiastical heraldry]] for clergy, religious orders, and schools. 

Many of these institutions have begun to employ blazons representing modern objects unknown in the medieval world. For example, some heraldic symbols issued by the [[United States Army Institute of Heraldry]] incorporate symbols such as guns, airplanes, or locomotives. Some scientific institutions incorporate symbols of modern science such as the [[Symbol (chemistry)|atom]] or particular scientific instruments. The arms of the [[United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority]] uses traditional heraldic symbols to depict the harnessing of atomic power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=CUdMRj7qOr8C&amp;pg=PA21&amp;dq=atom+symbol+in+heraldry&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwihiN2D48XTAhVB_IMKHa4CClwQ6AEIKDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=atom%20symbol%20in%20heraldry&amp;f=false|title=Heraldic Design: A Handbook for Students|last=Child|first=Heather|date=1976-01-01|publisher=Genealogical Publishing Com|isbn=9780806300719|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Locations with strong associations to particular industries may incorporate associated symbols. The coat of arms of [[Stenungsund Municipality]] in Sweden, pictured right, incorporates a hydrocarbon molecule, alluding to the historical significance of the petrochemical industry in the region.

Heraldry in countries with heraldic authorities continues to be regulated generally by [[Law of heraldic arms|laws]] granting rights to arms and recognizing possession of arms as well as protecting against their misuse. Countries without heraldic authorities usually treat coats of arms as creative property in the manner of [[logo]]s, offering protection under [[copyright law]]s.

{{Linguistics}}
In [[linguistics]] and [[rhetoric]], the '''historical present''' or '''historic present''' (also called '''dramatic present''' or '''narrative present''') is the employment of the [[present tense]] when narrating past events. It is widely used in writing about history in Latin (where it is sometimes referred to by its Latin name, ''praesens historicum'') and some modern European languages; in English it is used above all in historical chronicles (listing a series of events); it is also used in fiction,  for "hot news" (as in headlines), and in everyday conversation.{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|p=129–131}} In conversation, it is particularly common with "verbs of communication" such as ''tell'', ''write'', and ''say'' (and in colloquial uses, ''go'').{{sfn|Leech|1971|p=7}}  "Historic present" is the form recognised by the Oxford English Dictionary, whereas "historical present" is the form in Merriam Webster.

More recently, analysts of its use in conversation have argued that it functions not by making an event present, but by marking segments of a narrative, [[foregrounding]] events (that is, signalling that one event is particularly important, relative to others) and marking a shift to evaluation.{{sfn|Brinton|1992|p=221}}  

==Examples==
In an excerpt from [[Dickens]]' ''[[David Copperfield (novel)|David Copperfield]]'', the shift from the [[past tense]] to the historical present gives a sense of immediacy, as of a recurring vision:
{{quote|If the funeral  had been yesterday, I could not recollect it better. The very air of the best parlour, when I went in at the door, the bright condition of the fire, the shining of the wine in the decanters, the patterns of the glasses and plates, the faint sweet smell of cake, the odour of Miss Murdstone’s dress, and our black clothes. Mr. Chillip '''is''' in the room, and '''comes''' to speak to me.

"And how is Master David?" he '''says''', kindly.

I '''cannot''' tell him very well. I '''give''' him my hand, which he '''holds''' in his.|author=Charles Dickens|source=''David Copperfield'', Chapter IX}}

Notable novels written entirely in the historical present include [[John Updike]]'s ''[[Rabbit, Run]]'' and [[Margaret Atwood]]'s ''[[The Handmaid's Tale]]''.

==In describing fiction==
Summaries of the narratives (plots) of works of fiction are conventionally presented using the present tense rather than the past tense. At any particular point of the story, as it unfolds, there is a ''now'', and hence a ''past'' and a ''future'', so whether some event mentioned in the story is past, present, or, future changes as the story progresses; the entire plot description is presented as if the story's ''now'' is a continuous present. Thus, in summarizing the plot of ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'', one may write:
{{quote|Manette '''is''' obsessed with making shoes, a trade he '''learned''' while in prison.}}

==Other languages==

In French, the historical present is used in journalism, and in historical texts for reporting events in the past.&lt;ref name="Revaz-2002"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Le Français aujourd’hui |language=French |last=Revaz |first=Françoise |authorlink=&lt;!--viaf:51724807--&gt; |title=Le présent et le futur historiques : des intrus parmi les temps du passé ? |trans-title=The historical present and future: intruders among the past tenses? |publisher=[[Armand Colin]]-[[:fr:Éditions Dunod|Dunod]] |location=Paris |year=2002 |volume=4 |number=139 |pages=87–96 |url=http://www.cairn.info/revue-le-francais-aujourd-hui-2002-4-page-87.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Imhotep''' is the titular [[antagonist]] in the 1932 film ''[[The Mummy (1932 film)|The Mummy]]'', and later featured in its [[The Mummy (1999 film)|1999 remake]] and its sequel ''[[The Mummy Returns]]'' again as one of the main [[antagonist]]s. [[Sofia Boutella]] plays a female version of this character named [[Ahmanet]] in the [[The Mummy (2017 film)|2017 remake]]. Imhotep is loosely inspired by the historical figure [[Imhotep]], a noted [[polymath]] and counselor to the Pharaoh [[Djoser]] in the [[27th century BC]].

==''The Mummy'' (1932)==
In his original appearance, Imhotep was portrayed by [[Boris Karloff]] as a high priest of [[Ancient Egypt]], who steals the Scroll of Thoth in attempt to resurrect his lover Princess Ankh-es-en-amon. For Imhotep's sacrilege, the princess's father [[Pharaoh]] Amenophis the Magnificent orders Imhotep to be tortured, [[Mummy|mummified]] and buried alive. The scroll is buried with him, so that no one would ever again have the chance to use it again like he did.

Imhotep is accidentally revived as a [[Mummy (monster)|mummy]] when an archaeological expedition discovers his mummy and one of the archaeologists unknowingly reads the scroll's ancient life-giving spell. While reviewing his mummy, the archaeologists that discovered Imhotep note not only was he buried alive as indicated by his struggle, but that sacred spells meant to protect his soul on its journey to the Underworld were chipped off his coffin, so his soul would be condemned in the afterlife.

Imhotep escapes from the archaeologists and assumes the identity of Ardath Bey, a modern Egyptian. In this form he helps the archaeologists find the tomb of Ankh-es-en-amon. When Bey meets a woman, Helen Grosvenor, who bears a striking resemblance to Ankh-es-en-amon, he realizes that she is a [[reincarnation]] of the princess, and attempts to mummify her and make her his bride.

Imhotep is able to use years of power and strength to control others in person and through a looking pool from afar, causing both attraction to him, and death to those he wishes it upon. His powers allow him to control others to take his orders, which gives him control and the ability to draw Helen Grosvenor to him, where she can never remember what she did, or why she was with him. In the end, Grosvenor, recalling her past life, appeals to the goddess [[Isis]] who causes Imhotep to dissolve.

The ancient Egyptian priest from the film is named after a famous Egyptian architect named Imhotep who was responsible for designing the step pyramid at Sakkara. He is also well known for becoming his own priest, and excelling in medicine where he was considered a healer, using plants to treat common diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/imhotep.shtml|title=BBC - History - Imhotep|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the mummy of Imhotep has never been found, an empty sarcophagus was found in a tomb that is thought to have been his. People are in a disagreement on if the tomb discovered actually does belong to Imhotep, however, because there is evidence that whoever was laid to rest in that tomb did not worship [[Ra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://josephandisraelinegypt.wordpress.com/2014/01/23/the-tomb-of-imhotep-found-the-coffin-was-empty-and-orientated-to-the-north/|title=The tomb of Imhotep adjoining the Ibis Galleries in Saqqara. The coffin was empty and orientated to the north. The tomb dated to the 3rd dynasty. The Ibis galleries dated to the Ptolemaic period when pilgrims brought offerings to Imhotep hoping for healing.|date=23 January 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Mummy'' (1999)==
In the 1999 remake, Imhotep is portrayed by [[Arnold Vosloo]] and is the main [[antagonist]] of the film. In 1290 B.C., Imhotep was high priest under the rule of Pharaoh [[Seti I]]. He began an affair with Seti's mistress Anck-su-namun and they murder the Pharaoh when he discovers it. They are discovered and Anck-su-namun commits suicide, intending that Imhotep resurrect her. He and his priests later steal her corpse from her burial place. Imhotep attempts to resurrect Anck-su-namun, but is captured at [[Hamunaptra]] (the City of the Dead) by the [[Medjay]] (the Pharaoh's sacred bodyguards). His priests are mummified and buried alive. Imhotep, meanwhile, is condemned to endure the Curse of the Hom Dai: the ritual involves cutting out his tongue, mummifying him alive, and sealing him in a sarcophagus filled with carnivorous [[Scarabaeidae|scarab beetles]]. The curse transforms Imhotep into an undead fiend kept in a state of living death. If revived, he would gain control over sand and other elements.

During an archaeological dig 3,000 years later, Imhotep is accidentally revived when Egyptologist Evelyn Carnahan ([[Rachel Weisz]]) reads the ''Book of the Dead'' at Hamunaptra, where his sarcophagus was. Imhotep regenerates himself using the flesh of four thieves who breached his burial chamber and opened a cursed chest. He attempts to resurrect Anck-su-namun again, using Evelyn as a sacrifice. Ultimately, Imhotep is defeated when he is stripped of immortality by the Book of Amun-Ra, and he is stabbed with a sword by the film's [[protagonist]] [[Rick O'Connell]] ([[Brendan Fraser]]). As he degenerates into a skeletal form and falls into the pool from which he summoned Anck-su-namun's [[Egyptian soul|Ba]], Imhotep vows he will return to have his revenge.

Once revived, Imhotep gained several powers, including regeneration, invulnerability, and the ability to turn himself into sand and control the desert sands. He could also wield the [[Ten Plagues of Egypt]] to an unspecified degree; he could turn water to blood, unleash swarms of [[locust]]s, and control the people of the city by inflicting them with boils and sores. Early in the film, Imhotep expresses an intense [[Ailurophobia|fear of cats]], screaming in fear when a white one appears in Evelyn's room. Ardeth Bay (the leader of an ancient [[secret society]] devoted to guarding Imhotep's tomb, rather than an alias of Imhotep) and Evelyn's employer explain that Imhotep will fear them until he is fully regenerated, cats being associated with the Guardians of the Underworld in Egyptian mythology. Rick uses this fear against Imhotep later in the film.

==''The Mummy Returns'' (2001)==
In the 2001 sequel ''[[The Mummy Returns]]'', Imhotep, having been resurrected and freed from the resin he had been trapped in at the end of the first movie by a group of cultists and Anck-su-namun's reincarnation, proceeds to seek out the Bracelet of Anubis which was the key to finding the lair of the Scorpion King, an ancient warrior whose defeat will grant Imhotep control over the Scorpion King's near-indestructible Army of [[Anubis]]. After finding the bracelet on the arm of Alex O'Connell, the son of Rick and Evy, Imhotep captures the boy and uses him to find the lair of the Scorpion King, rejuvenating his body using the flesh of mercenaries Anck-su-namun tricks into opening the cursed chest. Once Imhotep reaches the lair, he walks over a magic seal on the floor which causes him to be robbed of his telekinesis, immortality, and other powers granted by the Curse of Hom Dai by Anubis, who seemingly wishes him to face the Scorpion King as a normal mortal. When the Scorpion King responds to Imhotep's summons, Imhotep tricks him into attacking Rick O'Connell. When Rick kills the Scorpion King and sends him and his army to the Underworld, the palace begins to collapse. Rick and Imhotep both nearly fall into a chasm, that apparently leads to the Underworld, and grab onto the ledge. While Rick is rescued by Evelyn, Imhotep begs Anck-su-namun for assistance to save him, but she selfishly refuses and leaves him to die. After this betrayal, Imhotep loses all will to live, since his only reason for returning from the grave was to be reunited with his lover, who apparently did not fully reciprocate his affection. He gives Rick and Evelyn a sad smile, understanding their love is genuine, and willingly casts himself into the pit, thus ending his reign of terror once and for all.

==''The Mummy'' (2001–2003)==
In the animated television series simply titled ''[[The Mummy (TV series)|The Mummy]]'', based on the 1999 and 2001 films, he is voiced by [[Jim Cummings]] and is again the main antagonist. Unlike the movies, he is able to speak contemporary English in this series. Many years ago, Imhotep was a priest who wanted to rule the world. He was already the keeper of the Scrolls of Thebes. When he was about to steal the Manacle of Osiris, the Pharaoh sent his royal guards to intercept him and sentence him to be mummified alive. Years later, Imhotep was resurrected by Colin Weasler, despite his co-worker Evy's attempt to destroy him. He plots to seek the Scrolls of Thebes in order to remove the Manacle of Osiris from Alex. When it comes to the fight in the Paris Catacombs where the Scrolls of Thebes are, he does regain them before they end up destroyed by Alex using the Manacle's power to bring a torch underneath the Scrolls of Thebes. Though he was thought dead when fighting the [[Minotaur]] within the flooding catacombs, Imhotep managed to survive and strives to find other ways to conquer the world.

'''Interactive art''' is a form of [[art]] that involves the spectator in a way that allows the art to achieve its purpose. Some interactive art installations achieve this by letting the observer or visitor "walk" in, on, and around them; some others ask the artist or the spectators to become part of the artwork.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Soler-Adillon|first=Joan|date=2015-12-21|title=The intangible material of interactive art: agency, behavior and emergence|url=http://journals.uoc.edu/index.php/artnodes/article/view/n16-soler|journal=Artnodes|language=en|volume=0|issue=16|doi=10.7238/a.v0i16.2744|issn=1695-5951}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Works of this kind of art frequently feature [[computer]]s, interfaces and sometimes sensors to respond to motion, heat, meteorological changes or other types of input their makers programmed them to respond to. Most examples of virtual [[Internet art]] and [[electronic art]] are highly interactive. Sometimes, visitors are able to navigate through a [[hypertext]] environment; some works accept textual or visual input from outside; sometimes an audience can influence the course of a [[performance art|performance]] or can even participate in it. Some other interactive artworks are considered as immersive as the quality of interaction involve all the spectrum of surrounding stimuli. Virtual reality environments like works by [[Maurice Benayoun]] and [[Jeffrey Shaw]] are highly interactive as the work the spectators – Maurice Benayoun call them "visitors", Miroslaw Rogala calls them (v)users,  [[Char Davies]] "immersants" –  interact with take all their fields of perception.

Though some of the earliest examples of interactive art have been dated back to the 1920s, most digital art didn’t make its official entry into the world of art until the late 1990s.&lt;ref name="Paul, C page 67"&gt;Paul, C: ''Digital Art'', page 67. Thames &amp; Hudson Inc, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since this debut, countless museums and venues have been increasingly accommodating digital and interactive art into their productions.  This budding genre of art is continuing to grow and evolve in a somewhat rapid manner through internet social sub-culture, as well as through large scale urban installations.

== Interactivity in art ==
[[File:Boundaryfunctions 1.jpg|thumb|right|250 px|alt=Boundary Functions at the Tokyo Intercommunications Center, 1999.|''Boundary Functions'' (1998) interactive floor projection by [[Scott Snibbe]] at the [[NTT InterCommunication Center]] in Tokyo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://snibbe.com/projects/interactive/boundaryfunctions "Boundary Functions"]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Interactive art is a genre of art in which the viewers participate in some way by providing an input in order to determine the outcome.  Unlike traditional art forms wherein the interaction of the spectator is merely a mental event, interactivity allows for various types of navigation, assembly, and/or contribution to an artwork, which goes far beyond purely psychological activity.&lt;ref name="Paul, C page 67"/&gt;  Interactivity as a medium produces meaning.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Muller, L, Edmonds, E, Connel, M: "Living laboratories for interactive art", ''CoDesign'', 2(4):3&lt;/ref&gt;

Interactive art installations are generally computer-based and frequently rely on sensors, which gauge things such as temperature, motion, proximity, and other meteorological phenomena that the maker has programmed in order to elicit responses based on participant action.  In interactive artworks, both the audience and the machine work together in dialogue in order to produce a completely unique artwork for each audience to observe. However, not all observers visualize the same picture. Because it is interactive art, each observer makes their own interpretation of the artwork and it may be completely different than another observer's views.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Interactive art can be distinguished from [[Generative art]] in that it constitutes a dialogue between the artwork and the participant; specifically, the participant has agency, or the ability, even in an unintentional manner, to act upon the artwork and is furthermore invited to do so within the context of the piece, i.e. the work affords the interaction. More often, we can consider that the work takes its visitor into account. In an increasing number of cases an installation can be defined as a [[responsive environment]], especially those created by architects and designers. By contrast, Generative Art, which may be interactive, but not responsive per se, tends to be a monologue – the artwork may change or evolve in the presence of the viewer, but the viewer may not be invited to engage in the reaction but merely enjoy it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==History==
According to the new media artist and theorist {{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} [[Maurice Benayoun]], the first piece of interactive art should be the work done by [[Parrhasius (painter)|Parrhasius]] during his art contest with [[Zeuxis]] described by [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], in the fifth century B.C. when Zeuxis tried to unveil the painted curtain. The work takes its meaning from Zeuxis' gesture and wouldn’t exist without it. Zeuxis, by its gesture, became part of Parrhasius' work. This shows that the specificity of interactive art resides often less in the use of computers than in the quality of proposed "situations" and the "Other's" involvement in the process of [[sensemaking]]. Nevertheless, computers and real time computing made the task easier and opened the field of virtuality – the potential emergence of unexpected (although possibly pre-written) futures – to contemporary arts.

Some of the earliest examples of interactive art were created as early as the 1920s.  An example is [[Marcel Duchamp]]’s piece named ''Rotary Glass Plates''.  The artwork required the viewer to turn on the machine and stand at a distance of one meter in order to see an optical illusion.&lt;ref&gt;Paul, C: ''Digital Art'', page 11. Thames &amp; Hudson Inc, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The present idea of interactive art began to flourish more in the 1960s for partly political reasons.  At the time, many people found it inappropriate for artists to carry the only creative power within their works.  Those artists who held this view wanted to give the audience their own part of this creative process.  An early example is found in the early 1960s "change-paintings" of [[Roy Ascott]], about whom [[Frank Popper]] has written: "Ascott was among the first artists to launch an appeal for total spectator participation".&lt;ref&gt;Popper, Frank (2007). From Technological to Virtual Art. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press. p. 77. {{ISBN|978-0-262-16230-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Aside from the “political” view, it was also current wisdom that interaction and engagement had a positive part to play within the creative process.&lt;ref&gt;Edmonds, E, Muller, L, Connel, M: "On creative engagement", ''Visual Communication'', 5(307):3&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s artists began to use new technology such as video and satellites to experiment with live performances and interactions through the direct broadcast of video and audio.&lt;ref&gt;Paul, C: ''Digital Art'', page 18. Thames &amp; Hudson Inc, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Interactive art became a large phenomenon due to the advent of computer based interactivity in the 1990s. Along with this came a new kind of art-experience.  Audience and machine were now able to more easily work together in dialogue in order to produce a unique artwork for each audience.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  In the late 1990s, museums and galleries began increasingly incorporating the art form in their shows, some even dedicating entire exhibitions to it.&lt;ref&gt;Paul, C: ''Digital Art'', page 23. Thames &amp; Hudson Inc, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  This continues today and is only expanding due to increased communications through digital media.

A hybrid emerging discipline drawing on the combined interests of specific artists and architects has been created in the last 10–15 years. Disciplinary boundaries have blurred, and significant number of architects and interactive designers have joined electronic artists in the creation of new, custom-designed interfaces and evolutions in techniques for obtaining user input (such as dog vision, alternative sensors, voice analysis, etc.); forms and tools for information display (such as video projection, lasers, robotic and mechatronic actuators, led lighting etc.); modes for human-human and human-machine communication (through the Internet and other telecommunications networks); and to the development of social contexts for interactive systems (such as utilitarian tools, formal experiments, games and entertainment, social critique, and political liberation).

== Forms ==
There are many different forms of interactive art.  Such forms range from interactive dance, music, and even drama.&lt;ref&gt;Dannenberg, R, Bates, J: "[https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rbd/papers/interactiveart.pdf A model for interactive art]", ''Proceedings of the Fifth Biennial Symposium for Arts and Technology'', 51(78):2&lt;/ref&gt;  New technology, primarily computer systems and computer technology, have enabled a new class of interactive art.&lt;ref&gt;Dannenberg, R, Bates, J: "A model for interactive art", ''Proceedings of the Fifth Biennial Symposium for Arts and Technology'', 51(78):1&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples of such interactive art are [[installation art]], [[interactive architecture]], [[interactive film]], and [[interactive storytelling]].

== Impact ==
The aesthetic impact of interactive art is more profound than expected.

Supporters of more “traditional” contemporary art saw, in the use of computers, a way to balance artistic deficiencies, some other consider that the art is not anymore in the achievement of the formal shape of the work but in the design of the rules that determine the evolution of the shape according to the quality of the dialogue.

== Events and places ==
There are number of globally significant festivals and exhibitions of interactive and media arts. [[Prix Ars Electronica]] is a major yearly competition and exhibition that gives awards to outstanding examples of (technology-driven) interactive art.  [[SIGGRAPH|Association of Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group in Graphics (SIGGRAPH)]], DEAF Dutch Electronic Arts Festival, Transmediale Germany, [[Electronic Language International Festival|FILE - Electronic Language International Festival]] Brazil, and AV Festival England, are among the others.

CAiiA, Centre for Advanced Inquiry in the Interactive Arts, first established by [[Roy Ascott]] in 1994 at the [[University of Wales, Newport]], and later in 2003 as the [[Planetary Collegium]], was the first doctoral and post doc research center to be established specifically for research in the interactive art field.

[[Interactive architecture]] has now been installed on and as part of building facades, in foyers, museums and large scale public spaces, including airports, in a number of global cities. A number of  leading museums, for example, the [[National Gallery (London)|National Gallery]], [[Tate]], [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]] and [[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum]] in [[London]] (to cite the leading UK museums active in this field) were early adoptors in the field of interactive technologies, investing in educational resources, and more latterly, in the creative use of MP3 players for visitors. In 2004 the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum commissioned curator and author Lucy Bullivant to write Responsive Environments (2006), the first such publication of its kind. Interactive designers are frequently commissioned for museum displays; a number specialize in wearable computing.

==Tools==
* [[Wiring (development platform)|Wiring]], the first [[Open-source software|open-source]] electronics prototyping platform composed of a [[programming language]], an [[integrated development environment]] (IDE), and a [[Single-board microcontroller|single-board micro controller]].

The '''Jamaica Center for Arts &amp; Learning''' in [[Jamaica, Queens]], [[New York (state)|New York]] is a [[performing arts|performing]] and [[visual arts|visual]] [[arts center]] that was founded in 1972 in an effort to revitalize the surrounding business district. As of 2012, it serves more than 28,000 people annually via a 1,650 [[square foot]] [[art gallery|gallery]], a 99-seat [[proscenium]] theater, and art &amp; music studios.  The building that houses the center is the former Queens Register of Titles and Deeds Building, a [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission|New York City landmark]] that is also listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name=jchist&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jcal.org/about/history.html|work=History|title=History|publisher=Jamaica Center for Arts &amp; Learning|accessdate=2012-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Outside the building is one of only two remaining [[Sidewalk clock on Jamaica Avenue|cast-iron sidewalk clocks]] in New York City,&lt;ref name=lp&gt;{{cite web|title=Jamaica Center for Arts &amp; Learning|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/new-york-city/sights/gallery/jamaica-center-for#ixzz24z7X3knH|work=New York City Sights|publisher=[[Lonely Planet]]|accessdate=2012-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a late-Victorian era headquarters of the [[Jamaica Savings Bank]] next door.

==Queens Register of Titles and Deeds Building==
'''Office of the Register''', also known as Queens Register of Titles and Deeds Building, is a historic government building located in the [[Jamaica, Queens|Jamaica]] section of the [[New York City]] [[borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[Queens]].  It was built between 1895 and 1913 and is an imposing, three story building with a [[limestone]] facade in the [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Neo-Italian Renaissance]] style. A rear five story addition was built in 1938.  The facade features deep rustication on the first floor and a smooth [[ashlar]] surface above.  The building housed the Office of the Register until 1974, after which it became the Jamaica Center for Arts &amp; Learning (JCAL).&lt;ref name="nrhpinv_ny"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=7361|title=National Register of Historic Places Registration: Office of the Register|date=October 1989|accessdate=2011-01-16 |author1=David J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7646">The '''Jane Drew Prize''' is an architecture award given annually by the ''[[Architects' Journal]]'' to a person showing innovation, diversity and inclusiveness in [[architecture]]. It is named after the [[English people|English]] [[modern architecture|modernist architect]] [[Jane Drew]].

==Background==
The Jane Drew Prize began with discussions in 1997 between the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] (RIBA) Women Architects Group and the [[Arts Council England|Arts Council of England]].&lt;ref name="Indy 1998"&gt;{{cite news|author=Nonie Niesewand |title =Prize farce at the gong show |work=[[The Independent]] |publisher= |date=4 June 1998 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/prize-farce-at-the-gong-show-1162676.html |accessdate=12 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new prize was launched in January 1998 with a ceremony held at the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]] in [[London]]. The award was created to recognise promotion of innovation, diversity and inclusiveness in architecture. It was named after the English architect Dame [[Jane Drew]] (died 1996)&lt;ref name="AJ 1998"&gt;{{cite news|author= |title =Jane Drew prize launched with wit and affection |work=[[Architects' Journal]] |publisher= |date=29 January 1998 |url=http://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/home/jane-drew-prize-launchedwith-wit-and-affection/776534.article |accessdate=12 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; who, among other achievements, had tried to set up the first all-women architecture practice and had been the first female full Professor at [[Harvard University]] and [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref name="Huff Zaha latest"&gt;{{cite news|author=Vanessa Quirk |title = Is Zaha's Latest Prize Really an Advancement for Women? |work=[[Huffington Post]] |publisher= |date=16 April 2012 |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/16/is-zahas-latest-prize-rea_n_1427375.html |accessdate=12 January 2014}} Originally published by ArchDaily 12 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Nominations were invited by the RIBA, after which a jury selected the winner who received a prize of £10,000.&lt;ref name="AJ 1998" /&gt; The 1998 winner also received a sculpture by [[Eduardo Paolozzi]].&lt;ref name="Indy 1998" /&gt;

Problems were encountered with the initial award, primarily in finding suitable candidates that met all three criteria. A forum was held on 19 May 1998 where the four shortlisted candidates (client [[Jane Priestman]], artist Martin Richman, landscape architect [[Kathryn Gustafson]] and architectural practice [[Fashion Architecture Taste]]) were asked to give a ten-minute presentation. The evening was described as "tedious" and Gustafson didn't even turn up.&lt;ref name="Indy 1998" /&gt;  The award was finally presented to Gustafson on 4 June after strong disagreements and near-resignations amongst the judging panel.&lt;ref name="Indy 1998" /&gt;

The prize has subsequently come under the jurisdiction of the ''[[Architects' Journal]]''. Winners are chosen by the AJ Women in Architecture Judging Panel.&lt;ref name="Huff Zaha latest" /&gt; According to the 2013 entry guidelines, the prize recognises a "contribution to the status of women in architecture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = THE JANE DREW PRIZE Entry Guidelines |publisher=Architects' Journal |url=http://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/Journals/2013/10/30/c/s/t/WIA-entry-JaneDrew.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=12 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Storylines===

====Season three====
Kirby, the daughter of [[Blake Carrington]]'s [[majordomo]], [[Joseph Anders]], returns to [[Denver]] in "Kirby" (1982). Having grown up at the mansion, in recent years she had been studying in [[Paris]], where she worked as a nanny but left her job after she became romantically involved with her (married) employer. Upon her return, she reconnects with her childhood playmate, Blake's daughter [[Fallon Carrington]]. As adults, however, the gulf between rich and poor is more of an impediment to their friendship. In "[[La Mirage (Dynasty)|La Mirage]]", Fallon hires Kirby to be the nanny for her young son, [[L.B. Colby]]. Kirby immediately has eyes for Fallon's husband, [[Jeff Colby]]. In "[[Acapulco (Dynasty)|Acapulco]]", Joseph warns Kirby not to interfere with the troubled marriage. But as Kirby watches Fallon's relationship with Jeff deteriorate—mostly due to Fallon's infidelities—she ingratiates herself with Jeff. During this time, Blake's son [[Adam Carrington]] is also attracted to Kirby. Jeff protects Kirby from Adam's unwanted advances, increasing tension between the two men. Adam rapes Kirby in "[[The Search (Dynasty)|The Search]]". He offers her a job in "[[Two Flights to Haiti]]", which she declines. Adam attacks Kirby again in "[[Reunion in Singapore]]", but she is rescued by Jeff. In the heat of the moment, Jeff (who has recently divorced Fallon) proposes marriage to her. Jeff and Kirby are married in [[Reno]] in the next episode, "[[Fathers and Sons (Dynasty)|Fathers and Sons]]". In the season finale "[[The Cabin (Dynasty)|The Cabin]]", Kirby learns that she is pregnant and realizes that the child is Adam's, but is afraid to tell Jeff.

====Season four====
Joseph commits suicide in the season four episode "[[The Bungalow (Dynasty)|The Bungalow]]", and Kirby is devastated. Blake explains that Joseph had tried to protect him by attempting to kill Blake's ex-wife [[Alexis Colby]] in the cabin fire, and when he failed, Joseph shot himself. Kirby suspects there is more to the story. She confronts Alexis in "[[The Hearing - Part 1 (Dynasty 1983)|The Hearing]]", and then tries to strangle her. Blake manages to stop Kirby. Jeff learns that Kirby is pregnant with Adam's child in "[[Peter De Vilbis (Dynasty)|Peter De Vilbis]]", and attacks Adam in "[[The Proposal (Dynasty 1983)|The Proposal]]". When Adam learns why, he tells Kirby that he wants to be a father to their baby. Kirby plans to leave Denver but Jeff stops her, though she suggests that they divorce. In "[[The Wedding (Dynasty 1983)|The Wedding]]", Adam insists that Kirby will tell their child that he is the father, but when he learns that she is divorcing Jeff, he proposes. Kirby accepts in "[[Lancelot (Dynasty)|Lancelot]]". She is diagnosed with [[hyperreflexia]] and hospitalized, after which she suffers from seizures and convulsions, and doctors are forced to operate. In "[[A Little Girl (Dynasty)|A Little Girl]]", Adam learns that Kirby's baby has not survived. Adam and Kirby decide to proceed with their wedding plans. To prevent them from marrying, Adam's mother Alexis offers Kirby a job in Paris. When Kirby refuses, Alexis tells her the real reason Joseph tried to kill her: to prevent her from revealing that Kirby's mother did not die when Kirby was a child—she had been institutionalized. Kirby is shocked. In "[[The Voice - Part 2 (Dynasty)|The Voice - Part 2]]", she visits the sanitarium and learns that her mother died a few years before. Investigating further, Kirby finds her father's suicide note in Blake's desk in "[[The Voice - Part 3 (Dynasty)|The Voice - Part 3]]". Driven to the brink, Kirby buys a handgun. Kirby tries to kill Alexis in "[[The Check (Dynasty)|The Check]]", but is interrupted. In the season finale "The Nightmare", Kirby pulls a gun on Alexis but cannot bring herself to shoot. Alexis agrees not to press charges if Kirby leaves Denver. Kirby abruptly breaks off her engagement to Adam and leaves town.

====''The Reunion'' (1991)====
Kirby is working in Paris as a translator for the Consortium when she runs into Adam Carrington. Kirby and Adam rekindle their romance as she helps him and Blake regain control of Denver-Carrington. Kirby and Adam announce their plans to marry at the end of the miniseries.

== Research ==

Brubaker began as an expert in Byzantine illuminated manuscripts, writing a pathbreaking book on one manuscript, Paris Grec. 510, in her ''Vision and Meaning''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Maguire|first1=Henry|title=Review in Slavic Review|jstor=2697076}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her interests have extended since to the cultural history of [[Byzantine Iconoclasm|Iconoclasm]] and the development of the cult of icons, on which she wrote two now-basic books on the subject with John Haldon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barber|first1=Charles|title=Review in Speculum|jstor=20060651}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has written substantially on the relationship between material culture and its visual expressions, and other aspects of cultural history, including visual and textual representations of gender, and female patronage.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

She has been fellowships at [[Dumbarton Oaks Research Library]] and Collection, first in 1980-81 as a Junior Fellow, a Summer Fellow in 1984 and a Spring Fellow in 2001 and 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of Prior Fellows and Visiting Scholars|url=http://www.doaks.org/research/byzantine/fellows/fellows-and-visiting-scholars-in-byzantine-studies|website=Dumbarton Oaks|accessdate=14 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her research into icons, relics and the proliferation of the cult of the Virgin Mary (known as the [[Theotokos]]) in Byzantium developed into a major research project subsidized by an [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]] grant and the International Iconoclasms network, led by Brubaker with Dr Richard Clay (University of Birmingham),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iconoclasms - Practices of the Past; Interpretations of the Present|url=http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J002518/1|website=Gateway to Research (Research Councils UK)|accessdate=2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in collaboration with the [[Tate Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art Under Attack: Histories of British Iconoclasm - Exhibition at the Tate Britain|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/art-under-attack-histories-british-iconoclasm|website=Tate|accessdate=2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MIDAS Heritage''' ''– the UK Historic Environment Data Standard'' is a British [[cultural heritage]] standard for recording information on buildings, archaeological sites, shipwrecks, parks and gardens, battlefields, areas of interest and artefacts.&lt;ref&gt;Association of Local Government Archaeological Officers UK (ALGAO). Data Standards.  {{cite web|url=http://www.algao.org.uk/Cttees/HERs/HERStandards.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820014333/http://www.algao.org.uk/Cttees/HERs/HERStandards.htm |archivedate=2008-08-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The data standard suggests the minimum level of information needed for recording heritage assets and covers the procedures involved in understanding, protecting and managing these assets. It also provides guidelines on how to support effective sharing of knowledge, [[data retrieval]] and long-term preservation of data.&lt;ref&gt;English Heritage (2007): MIDAS Heritage – The UK Historic Environment Data Standard. (Best practice guidelines). http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/publications/midas-heritage/midasheritagepartone.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

''MIDAS Heritage'' is freely available to anyone interested in recording historic environment information. It is used by national government organisations, local authorities, heritage sector organisations, amenity groups and societies, the research community and professional contractors.&lt;ref&gt;English Heritage (2007): MIDAS Heritage – The UK Historic Environment Data Standard. (Best practice guidelines). http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/publications/midas-heritage/midasheritagepartone.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first edition of the standard, ''MIDAS – A Manual and Data Standard for Monument Inventories'', was published by the ''[[Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England]]'' &lt;ref&gt;Lee, E., (ed), MIDAS - A Manual and Data Standard for Monument Inventories. The Royal Commission on Historical Monuments of England. Swindon (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; (RCHME) in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;the Data Hub – The easy way to get, use and share data. (MIDAS – Heritage project) http://ckan.net/dataset/midas-heritage&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation merged with ''[[English Heritage]]'' in 1999 and the updated version, ''MIDAS Heritage'', was published in 2007 in collaboration with other UK heritage organisations. The standard was developed by the ''Forum on Information Standards in Heritage'' (FISH), a discussion forum aimed at helping to resolve standards and recording issues for the whole of the heritage sector.&lt;ref&gt;Forum on Information Standards in Heritage http://www.fish-forum.info/{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Forum on Information Standards in Heritage http://www.fish-forum.info/{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A revised version, with more explicit compliance statements, was released in 2012 &lt;https://content.historicengland.org.uk/images-books/publications/midas-heritage/midas-heritage-2012-v1_1.pdf/&gt;

==Coverage==
''MIDAS Heritage'' is a set of closely integrated data standards, rather than one single standard.  It is designed to be used in conjunction with separate standards covering specific types of applications or projects, which will give the necessary [[data element]]s.&lt;ref&gt;English Heritage (2007): MIDAS Heritage – The UK Historic Environment Data Standard. (Best practice guidelines). http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/publications/midas-heritage/midasheritagepartone.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include ''SPECTRUM'' (artefacts), ''UK Gemini Discovery Metadata Standard'' (GIS), ''[[CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model]]'' (concepts and relationships),&lt;ref&gt;International Organization for Standardization. ISO 21127:2006 http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=34424&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Informing the Future of the Past: Guidelines for Historic Environment Records’’.&lt;ref&gt;Gilman, P; Newman, M. (2007): “Informing the Future of the Past: Guidelines for Historic Environment Records”. 2nd edition.  http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/ifp/ &lt;/ref&gt; MIDAS Heritage complies with the UK e-Government Metadata Standard ([[e-GMS]]),&lt;ref&gt;esd standards, e-GMS-e-Government Metadata Standard, Version 3.0, {{cite web|url=http://www.esd.org.uk/standards/egms/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111118112837/http://www.esd.org.uk/standards/egms/ |archivedate=2011-11-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is based on [[Dublin Core]].&lt;ref&gt;English Heritage (2007): MIDAS Heritage – The UK Historic Environment Data Standard. (Best practice guidelines). http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/publications/midas-heritage/midasheritagepartone.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

There are six main themes, each containing several  Information Groups, which in turn contain a number of Information Units.

The standard aims only to provide a common information framework and does not cover: what software or file format to use; what to call fields and tables in a database and how they are designed; what indexing terms to use; how to record archives and museum collections, or how to redesign an existing information system.&lt;ref&gt;English Heritage (2007): MIDAS Heritage – The UK Historic Environment Data Standard.

Blackman's award-winning ''Noughts &amp; Crosses series'', exploring love, racism and violence, is set in a fictional [[utopian and dystopian fiction|dystopia]]. Explaining her choice of title, in a 2007 interview for the [[BBC]]'s ''Blast'' website, Blackman said that [[tic-tac-toe|noughts and crosses]] is "one of those games that nobody ever plays after [[childhood]], because nobody ever wins".&lt;ref name="BBC Blast interview"&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = 2007-03-23 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview for ''[[The Times]]'', Blackman said that before writing ''Noughts &amp; Crosses'', her [[protagonist]]s' [[ethnic group|ethnicities]] had never been central to the plots of her books.&lt;ref name="Craig interview"/&gt; She has also said, "I wanted to show black children just getting on with their lives, having adventures, and solving their dilemmas, like the characters in all the books I read as a child."&lt;ref name="Penguin authors" /&gt;

Blackman eventually decided to address racism directly.&lt;ref name="Craig interview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC Blast interview" /&gt; She reused some details from her own experience, including an occasion when she needed a [[bandage|plaster]] and found they were designed to be inconspicuous only on white people's skin.&lt;ref name="Craig interview"/&gt; ''The Times'' interviewer [[Amanda Craig]] speculated about the delay for the ''Noughts &amp; Crosses'' series to be  published in the [[United States]]: "though there was considerable interest, 9/11 killed off the possibility of publishing any book describing what might drive someone to become a terrorist".&lt;ref name="Craig interview"/&gt; ''Noughts and Crosses'' is now available in the US published under the title ''Black &amp; White'' (Simon &amp; Schuster Publishers, 2005).

''Noughts &amp; Crosses'' was No. 61 on the [[Big Read]] list, a 2003 BBC survey to find "The Nation's Best-Loved Book", with more votes than ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'', several [[Terry Pratchett]] novels and ''[[Lord of the Flies]]''.

She was appointed [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) in the 2008 Birthday Honours.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=58729 |date=14 June 2008 |page=9 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2013, Blackman was announced as the new Children's Laureate, succeeding [[Julia Donaldson]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin Chilton, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/booknews/10094538/Malorie-Blackman-is-new-Childrens-Laureate.html "Malorie Blackman is new Children’s Laureate"], ''The Telegraph'', 4 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michelle Pauli, [https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2013/jun/04/malorie-blackman-childrens-laureate "Malorie Blackman is the new children's laureate"], Children's Books, ''The Guardian'', 4 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

Malorie Blackman lives with her husband Neil and daughter Elizabeth in [[Kent]], England. In her free time, she likes to play her piano, compose, play computer games and write poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Preface to ''Tell Me No Lies''.&lt;/ref&gt; She is the subject of a biography for children by [[Verna Wilkins]].&lt;ref&gt;Verna Wilkins, [http://www.randomhouse.co.uk/editions/malorie-blackman-biography/9781870516495 ''Malorie Blackman – Author''] Black Stars series, Tamarind/Random House, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, Blackman joined other prominent authors in supporting the [[Let books be books|Let Books Be Books]] campaign, which seeks to stop children’s books being labelled as 'for girls' or 'for boys'.&lt;ref name="BBC 17 March 2014" &gt;{{cite news |last= Masters |first= Tim |title= Campaign over gender-specific books gains support |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-26612080|accessdate=24 November 2014 |website= BBC News |date=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014, Malorie Blackman was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to ''[[The Guardian]]'' opposing [[Scottish independence]] in the run-up to September's [[Scottish independence referendum, 2014|referendum on that issue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/aug/07/celebrities-open-letter-scotland-independence-full-text |title=Celebrities' open letter to Scotland – full text and list of signatories &amp;#124; Politics |publisher=theguardian.com |date=2014-08-07 |accessdate=2014-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Mambo Graphics logo.png|frame|A Mambo shirt logo]]
'''Mambo Graphics''' (also, '''100% Mambo''') and marketed as '''Mambo''' is an Australian company designer of surf, snow and street clothing. It was launched in 1984, by musician Dare Jennings and business partner, Andrew Rich in the [[Sydney]] suburb of [[Alexandria, Sydney|Alexandria]]. On January 6, 2015 Mambo was acquired by American company [[Saban Brands]]

==Early Days: Founding==
In the early 1970s Dare Jennings owned a large and successful screenprinting business Phantom Textile Printers, producing T-shirt and fabric prints for a variety of commercial clients. He also owned an independent record label, [[Phantom Records]].

Mambo began life as an “after hours” project in the Phantom artroom. The graphics were initially created by in-house artists such as musician [[Jodi Phillis]], and by freelance artist, Richard Allan whose first T-shirt graphics, ‘Real Wrestlers, Real Wrestling’ and, ‘Call Of The Wild (Farting Dog)’ were the best sellers..

'100% Mambo' clothing was often available in surf / skate shops in the mid to late 80s in the UK. As skateboarders naturally wore a lot of surfer inspired gear, Mambo board shorts in loud / Hawaiian patterns were ideal skate wear. Other similar surf / skate brands around at the time were Stussy, Life's A Beach and Vision Street Wear. As this was long before skate culture became mainstream (e.g. skate shops often only sold Vans, Vision or Converse shoes), these were usually niche products.

==Mambo graphic arts==
Richard Allan’s arrival at Mambo was followed by other Australian and overseas artists including, [[Reg Mombassa]]   [[Robert Williams (artist)|Robert Williams (US)]],  and [[Ben Frost (artist)|Ben Frost]] 

==Exclusive stores==

Mambo opened its first store in 1995. Located in the [[Sydney]] suburb of [[Paddington, New South Wales|Paddington]], it was called the ‘Mambo Friendship Store’. Stores opened in other Australian cities and in the UK, [[Europe]], [[Asia]] and [[NZ]]. By 2001 Mambo had opened 25 independent retail stores.

==History and development-chronology ==
In 1994, the first Mambo ‘Loud Shirt’ was released. The design was influenced by the famous [[Hawaiian shirt|Hawaiian ‘Aloha’ shirt]]. It was called ‘Blue Hawaii’ by [[Martin Plaza]] (a band mate of [[Reg Mombassa]]). This shirt became one of Mambo’s best sellers and started the Mambo ‘Loud Shirt’ style.

In 2000 Mambo received an invitation from the [[Australian Wool Board]] to design the athlete’s uniform for the [[opening ceremony]] of the [[Sydney Olympics|Summer Olympic Games]] in [[Sydney]].

After the [[Sydney Olympics|Summer Olympic Games]], Dare Jennings was approached by [[Gazal Corporation]] to buy the brand. Dare Jennings sold the company in March of that year and took over the role of creative director. He left the company two years later, in 2002.  Dare went on to create the surf and moto inspired brand Deus Ex Machina that have mixed retail, food &amp; beverage and custom moto/ surf/ bicycle Flagships in Sydney, LA, Tokyo, Milan and Bali.

In 2006, Principle (an Australian research company) named Mambo ‘Australia’s sixth most authentic brand’ alongside [[Bonds (clothing)|Bonds]], [[Speedo International Limited|Speedo]], [[R. M. Williams]] and [[Billabong (clothing)|Billabong]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.superbrands.com.au/BrandDetails.aspx?id=67 Superbrands Vol.5] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110222212525/http://superbrands.com.au/BrandDetails.aspx?id=67 |date=2011-02-22 }}. [[Superbrands]]. 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 Mambo was sold to The Nervous Investor Group, an Australian-based consortium headed by Angus Kingsmill and based in the [[Sydney]] beachside suburb of [[Manly, New South Wales|Manly]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1853177-1,00.html Time Magazine]. [[Time magazine|Time]]. Oct 23rd, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Mambo has entered into partnerships with key players in the US and Brazil with plans to introduce the brand on a vast scale in each country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.textilesource.com.au/news/mambo-restructure-leads-to-global-expansion-20120202-20822.html | location=Melbourne | work=Textile Source | title=Mambo restructure leads to global expansion | date=2 February 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120914092833/http://www.textilesource.com.au/news/mambo-restructure-leads-to-global-expansion-20120202-20822.html | archivedate=14 September 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internationally ==
Mambo is sold across Australia and New Zealand and, in 2011, entered the United States and Canada and has opened Mambo stores in the UK.

==Designs ==
The first pair of board shorts was created by an English designer [[Paul Smith (fashion designer)|Paul Smith]]. Peter Pilotto and other designers inspired the female wetsuits.

'''Monte Vettore''' (from latin ''Vector'', "winner") is a [[mountain]] of the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]]. It is the highest peak of the [[Sibillini mountains|Cyblings massif]].

== Geography ==
The southwestern side of Cyblings massif, Vector, is included in [[Parco Nazionale dei Monti Sibillini|Sibillini Mountains National Park]]. Below the summit of Vector lies [[Lago di Pilato|a small glacial lake]] in a small enclosed valley between [[Cima del Redentore (Sibillini Mountains)|Redeemer Peak]].&lt;ref&gt;[htqtp://utenti.lycos.it/umbriadascoprire/castelluccio.htm Umbria :Castelluccio di Norcia].&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Sibillla Appenninica di Adolfo de Carolis.jpg|thumb|'''Apennine Sibyl''' by [[Adolfo de Carolis]].]]
The local medieval tradition was that the '''Apennine Sibyl''', a mysterious prophetess not counted among the [[Sibyl]]s of [[Classical Antiquity]], was condemned by God to dwell in a mountain cavern and await [[Last Judgement|Judgement Day]], having rebelled at the news that she had ''not'' been chosen [[Mother of God]], but that some humble Judaean virgin had been favored. The peak of Monte Vettore, surrounded by reddish cliffs was recognized as the crown of ''Regina Sibilla.''
[[Image:Monte Vettore - summit view of gran sasso3.JPG|thumb|Monte Vettore summit view with Maile]]
Less stringently Christian legend set her in an underworld paradise entered through a grotto in the mountains of Norcia. Nearby the magical lake is fed by water from the cavern. Whoever stayed longer than a year could no longer leave, but remained deathless and ageless, feasting in abundance, amid revelry and voluptuous delights. 

== In popular culture ==
In ''[[Il Guerrin Meschino]]'', written by [[Andrea da Barberino]] about 1410, the central episode of the sixth part (Canto V) contains the "prodigious adventures" of Guerrino with this enchantress, the "Fata" Alcina, whom he seeks out, against all advice. He locates her cavern in the mountains of central Italy with the aid of Macco, a [[Serpent (mythology)|speaking serpent]]. She shows him the delights and horrors of her cavern, where sinners have been changed to the appropriate animals, but where sin is the only path to the knowledge of his real parents that he seeks, and Guerrin has to flee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lfb.it/fff/enc/guerimes5.htm Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;

The long informative captions in the maps of [[Ortelius]]' 16th-century atlas, ''Cartographia Neerlandica'', offer some detail about this Apennine Sybil:
{{quote|The Mountain Apennine here looms over the country with exceedingly high cragged tops, in which one finds that huge cave called Sibylla's cave, (in their language Grotta de la Sibylla) and which the poets would have the Elysian Fields. For the common people dream about a certain Sibylla [supposed] to be in this cave, who [is claimed to] possess a large kingdom full of gorgeous buildings and Princely palaces, covered with pleasant gardens, abounding with many fine lecherous wenches and all kinds of pleasures and delights. All of these she will bestow on those who through this cave (which is always open) will come to her.
And after they have been there for the period of one whole year, they have the freedom and liberty given to them by Sibylla to depart (if they please) and from that moment, having returned to us, they state that they live a most blessed and happy life ever after. This cave is also known to our countrymen by the name of &lt;small&gt;VROU VENUS BERGH&lt;/small&gt;, that is, The Lady Venus mount.&lt;ref&gt;Compare the legend of the [[Venusberg (mythology)|Venusberg]].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Locally the Sibilla was in some sense a beneficent ''[[Fairy|fata]]'' whose retinue would descend from her mountain at times to teach the village girls all the secrets of spinning and weaving (see [[Weaving (mythology)]] for other European weaving goddesses), and perhaps to dance the [[saltarello]] with the best of the young men. But if they were not back in their mountain fastness by sunrise, they would be denied access and would become mere mortals. On one occasion, what with dancing and pleasure, the ''faterelle'' had not noticed the approach of dawn. Scrambling up the Vettore, their goatlike feet crushed the rock to fragments. They reached the safety of their grotto just before dawn, but the long slope of [[Scree|talus]] is still pointed out as the ''Path of the Fata''.

The '''International Organisation of Scenographers, Theatre Architects and Technicians''' ('''OISTAT''') is a [[non-governmental organization]] (NGO) founded in 1968 in [[Prague]], Czech Republic. According to its founding name, the organization is mainly a network for theatre designers, theatre architects and theatre technicians around the world, made up of people associated with creating or studying live performances, including educators, researchers and practitioners. The organization has members from 53 countries,{{cn|date=March 2018}} in the membership categories: Centre Member, Associate Member and Individual Member.

==History==
The predecessor of the organization was the scenography section of the [[International Theatre Institute]] (ITI), founded in 1948. This institute was expected to form an international co-operation of all artistic fields and establish leading publishing and educational direction from the drama sections. The project failed, but interest in the visual elements of theatre grew.{{cn|date=March 2018}} Shortly after, in 1958, the International Association of Theatre Technicians (IATT) was formed in Paris. This association also faltered due to lack of direction, programming, organizational structure, administrative and financial provisions.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

The representatives sought ITI to take up the activities again, and the ITI Secretary General [[Jean Darcante]] went to Prague in 1967 to discuss with representatives of the Czechoslovak National ITI Center, the Theatre Institute and the Institute of Scenography, the possibility of establishing an organization with a general secretariat in Prague. Czechoslovak scenographers, including professional workers and theatre specialists from both institutions, prepared a draft program for the activity of the new organization with the Czechoslovak Ministry of Culture. Darcante travelled to Prague again in early 1968 to obtain a binding promise from the Czechoslovak official authorities and agree the final details with the Theatre Institute and the Institute of Scenography. On 7 and 8 June 1968, the foundation committee met to establish the new International Organization of Scenographers and Theatre Technicians ({{lang-fr|Organisation Internationale des Scénographes et technicians de Théatre}}; OISTT). The founding membership consisted of representatives from Czechoslovakia, Canada, Israel, Hungary, the German Democratic Republic, the Federal Republic of Germany and the United States.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

==Organizational structure==
===The World Congress===
OISTAT is composed of members in regions around the world, known as OISTAT Centres, Associate members and Individual members. As defined in the Statutes, "the directing body of OISTAT is the Congress, which is formed when the delegates of the OISTAT Centres, Associate Members and Individual Members are assembled in plenary session". Every four years, the delegates of the World Congress elect the President and the members of Executive Committee. They also decide on changes in the Statutes and other arising issues of the organization.

===Executive Committee and Governing Board ===
OISTAT affairs are coordinated by the Governing Board and its Executive Committee. The Executive Committee consists of eight elected members including the President, elected at the congress. The Governing Board consists of the elected chairs of the six commissions.

===Headquarters===
The Headquarters, known as the Secretariat until 2011, are the only constant office of the organization in charge of daily communications, and serve as the central network for its members and commissions. The Headquarters has moved twice since its foundation; it was in Prague from 1968-1993, in the Netherlands from 1993-2005, and since 2006 it is in Taipei, Taiwan.

===Commissions===
Six commissions lead various projects in their field of studies: 

* '''Architecture''': The Architecture commission was composed mainly of architects, theatre designers and technicians. The commission initiated the quadrennial Theatre Architecture Competition (TAC) in 1978 and the finalist designs are exhibited at the Prague Quadrennial.
* '''Education''': This commission is the main facilitator of OISTAT Scenofest and International Stage Design Students' Works Exchange (ISDSWE) in Beijing, China.
* '''Research''': The Research commission focuses on the theoretical and historical aspects of theatre [[scenography]], architecture, and technologies. The Theatre Timeline Sub-commission is a recent establishment by the commission focusing on archiving theatre technologies, recording and preservation.
* '''Performance design''': Performance Design includes four sub-commissions: Costume Design, Lighting Design, Sound Design and Space Design.
* '''Publication and communication''': This commission's recent projects include Core Strategy, World Scenography, the Digital Theatre Words and the Bibliography of Theatre Arts.
* '''Technology''': OISTAT Technology facilitates exchange of ideas in the field of theatre technology, develops research projects, and examines standards and safety issues. The commission offers technical advice and support for theatre technicians worldwide. The Theatre Invention Prize (TIP) is a competition initiated since 2011 by the commission.

==OISTAT projects ==
{{cleanup|section|reason=Excessive trivial detail|date=March 2018}}
===Theatre Architecture Competition (TAC)===
Theatre Architecture Competition is an international ideas competition, aimed at students and emerging practitioners, which is organized every four years by the Architecture commission. The sites of the competition have been in these cities:
*1978, Paris, France 
*1983, Stockholm, Sweden
*1990, Moscow, Russia
*1999, Prague, Czech Republic
*2003, Hengelo, Netherlands
*2007, Prague, Czech Republic
*2011, Prague, Czech Republic &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pq.cz/en/tac-competition.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141103062538/http://www.pq.cz/en/tac-competition.html |archivedate=2014-11-03 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;
*2015, Berlin, Germany
*2017, Hsinchu, Taiwan &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dropbox.com/s/6v6aqkgqnfazoqs/10th+OISTAT+Theatre+Architecture+Brief.final.+Hsinchu+City_rev.pdf?dl=0|title=10th OISTAT Theatre Architecture Brief.final. Hsinchu City_rev.pdf|website=Dropbox.com|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the competition theme was to design a theatre for a specific performance. The theatre can be in 'found' spaces which were not previously or presently a performing space or create a temporary installation.

In 2015, the theme was to construct a 'floating theatre' on Spree River in Berlin, Germany. The competition has moved from Prague Quadrennial to Berlin's Stage|Set|Scenery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oistat.org/Item/list.asp?id=1503|title=TAC Info &amp; Schedule|website=Oistat.org|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the theme is 'Theatre as Public Space'. The aim of the competition is to challenge the conventional typology of the theatre and to focus on the design of a temporary theatre (or theatres) in The Public Activity Center, a disused sports stadium in Hsinchu City in Taiwan. The 25 selected entries of TAC 2017 were exhibited and awarded during 2017 World Stage Design on July 1–9, 2017 in Taipei, Taiwan.

===World Stage Design===
World Stage Design is an international exhibition of performance design from theatre, dance, music, and opera, as well as a showcase for cross-disciplinary performances and installations in non-conventional theatre spaces since 2005. It is held every four years on different continents, to purposely show the latest designs in theatre performances. Different from the Prague Quadrennial which presents designs curated by each country, World Stage Design allows every individual designer to submit design works directly to the curatorial panel for the grand exhibition. It has been in these cities:
*2005, Toronto, Canada
*2009, Seoul, South Korea
*2013, Cardiff, UK
*2017, Taipei, Taiwan

The '''Paper Project''' is a fusion project that blends art, science, and technology into engaging 2D and 3D experiences.

==About the project==

The Paper Project is a multidimensional art and science project exploring the microscopic structure of paper using a [[Confocal laser scanning microscopy|scanning-laser confocal microscope]]. Created by artist and scientist Charles Kazilek and printer and paper maker Gene Valentine in 1999 the project has been exhibiting works in various formats including 2D and virtual 3D images. The 3D [[anaglyphic]] images make use of inexpensive red-blue [[Anaglyph 3D|3D glasses]] first introduced to movie goers in the 1950s. When wearing 3D glasses, it is as if the viewer has been reduced to the size of a period at the end of a sentence and is able to explore the invisible structure and beauty of paper.

In 2002, the project expanded to dance, collaborating with costume designers Jacqueline Benard and Galina Mihaleva and dance choreographer Jennifer Tsukayama.  The result of the collaboration was ''Paper Interiors: a dance exploration of real and virtual dimensions'' that debuted at the American College Dance Festival. In 2004, Jennifer Tsukayama became a member of the Paper Project and the group created a traveling 3D immersive room based on the earlier dance performance. The first installation of the room was at the Arizona Museum for Youth.

Since its creation, images from the Paper Project have been viewed around the world in museums, science centers, and on the Web. In addition to exhibits the Paper Project has developed educational content that can be used to engage students in art, history, biology, chemistry, and physics.

'''Taras Shevchenko State Art School''' ({{lang-uk|Державна художня середня школа імені Тараса Шевченка}}) is a [[Selective school|selective high school]] (5th through 12th grade) specializing in [[fine arts]] (painting, sculpture and architecture), in [[Kiev]], [[Ukraine]].&lt;ref name="History"/&gt; 
The school is part of the complex that also includes schools of [[ballet]] and [[music]]. It is located adjoining a historic park overlooking the Southern end of [[Babi Yar]].

The school was established on August 12, 1937, and was originally located at 2 Volodymyrska Street, Kiev (now the [[National Museum of the History of Ukraine]]). The first pupils graduated in 1940. Due to the [[German invasion of the Soviet Union]] in 1941, all the graduates from this class as well as the directors of the school were conscripted into the [[Soviet Army]] and sent to the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]].&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;

There are many notable artists among its graduates.

The '''Shpilman Institute for Photography''' (SIP) was an Israeli non profit organisation which promoted [[photography]] worldwide.

==History==
SIP was founded in 2010 Shalom Shpilman&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/life/arts-leisure/the-engineer-who-put-together-a-startlingly-efficient-photograph-collection.premium-1.433168|title=The engineer who put together a startlingly efficient photograph collection|author=Daniel Rauchwerger|date=29 May 2012|work=Haaretz.com|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to promote [[photography]] as an art in [[Israel]] and worldwide. The institute, located in [[Tel Aviv]], hosts exhibitions, lectures and various artistic activities by people in the field of photography and media art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artandeducation.net/client/shpilman_institute_for_pho/|title=Shpilman Institute for Photography|work=Art &amp; Education | access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SIP also provides ground and holds academic research. It offers grants and scholarships to projects, both locally in [[Israel]] and internationally. 

In addition to hosting temporary exhibitions, the SIP had a permanent collection with over 900 works, including photographs by [[Erwin Blumenfeld]], Frederick Sommer, Berenice Abbott, [[Arthur Siegel]], Nan Goldin, Cindy Sherman, [[Man Ray]], Cecil Beaton, Elliott Erwitt, [[Bill Brandt]], Andre Breton, [[Claude Cahun]], [[Salvador Dali]], Harry Callahan, Paul Heismann, [[Yasuhiro Ishimoto]], [[Adi Nes]], [[Jeff Wall]], [[Uri Gershuni]], [[Ilit Azulay]], [[Deganit Berest]], [[Eli Lotar]], [[Ohad Matalon]], [[Lee Miller]] and [[Michal Heiman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://thesip.org/language/en/artist/millerbio-en/ | title=Miller Lee | access-date=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of end 2016, Shpilman Institute of Photography ceased its activities and sold its permanent collection at [[Sotheby's]] and [[Christie's]]. Fifty-five works from the collection were purchased by [[Israel Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/gallery/art/1.2784326|title=Israel Museum purchased 55 works from Shpilman collection|work=Haaretz.com | access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation site's latest update was at the end of 2014 and the institute premises were vacated at the beginning of 2015.

{{Culture of South Africa}}
'''South African art''' is the [[visual art]] produced by the people inhabiting the territory occupied by the modern country of [[South Africa]]. The oldest art objects in the world were discovered in a South African cave. Archaeologists have discovered two sets of art kits thought to be 100,000 years old at a cave in South Africa. The findings provide a glimpse into how early humans produced and stored [[ochre]] – a form of paint – which pushes back our understanding of when evolved complex cognition occurred by around 20,000 – 30,000 years. Also, dating from 75,000 years ago, they found small drilled snail shells could have no other function than to have been strung on a string as a necklace. South Africa was one of the cradles of the human species. 

The scattered tribes of [[Khoisan]] and [[San people|San]] peoples moving into South Africa from around 10000 [[Anno Domini|BC]] had their own art styles seen today in a multitude of cave paintings.&lt;ref name="South African art"&gt;{{cite web|title=South African art|url=http://www.southafrica.info/about/arts/art.htm#.Vw5td8d6FlI|website=www.southafrica.info|accessdate=13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were superseded by [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] and [[Nguni people|Nguni]] peoples with their own vocabularies of art forms. 

In the present era, traditional tribal forms of art were scattered and re-melded by the divisive policies of [[apartheid]]. New forms of art evolved in the mines and [[townships]]: a dynamic art using everything from plastic strips to bicycle spokes. In addition to this, there also is the [[Dutch people|Dutch]]-influenced [[folk art]] of the [[Afrikaner]] Trek [[Boer]]s and the urban white artists earnestly following changing European traditions from the 1850s onwards, making for an eclectic mix which continues to evolve today.

== Paleolithic Rock Art==
[[File:Karoo sandstone with bushmen paintings.jpg|thumb|Sandstone with bushmen rock paintings, [[Karoo System]], ([[Amathole Mountains]], South Africa)]]

The pre-Bantu peoples migrating southwards from around the year 30,000 [[Anno Domini|BC]] were nomadic hunters who favoured caves as dwellings. Before the rise of the Nguni peoples along the east and southern coasts and central areas of Africa these nomadic hunters were widely distributed. It is thought they entered South Africa at least 10 years ago. They have left lots of signs of life, people toilets and rocks ('[[Bushmen|Bushman]]' paintings) depicting hunting, domestic and magic-related art.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite web|title=Paleolithic Period|url=http://www.britannica.com/event/Paleolithic-Period|website=Britannica|accessdate=13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a stylistic unity across the region and even with more ancient art in the [[Tassili n'Ajjer]] region of northern Africa, and also in what is now desert [[Chad]] but was once a lush landscape.

The figures are dynamic and elongate, and the colours (derived probably from earthen and plant pigments and possibly also from insects) combine ochreous red, white, grey, black, and many warm tones ranging from red through to primary yellow. Common subjects include hunting, often depicting with great accuracy large animals which no longer inhabit the same region in the modern era, as well as: warfare among humans, dancing, domestic scenes, multiple images of various animals, including giraffes, antelope of many kinds, and snakes. The last of these works are poignant in their representation of larger, darker people and even of white hunters on horseback, both of whom would supplant the 'Bushman' peoples.
 
Many of the 'dancing' figures are decorated with unusual patterns and may be wearing masks and other festive clothing. Other paintings, depicting patterned quadrilaterals and other symbols, are obscure in their meaning and may be non-representational. Similar symbols are seen in [[shaman]]istic art worldwide. This art form is distributed from Angola in the west to [[Mozambique]] and [[Kenya]], throughout [[Zimbabwe]] and South Africa and throughout [[Botswana]] wherever cave conditions have favoured preservation from the elements.

==Contemporary Art in South Africa==

The [[contemporary art]] scene in South Africa is as diverse and vibrant as the population and cultures in the country. Contemporary artists in South Africa have adopted new media technologies to produce varied and creative bodies of work, as seen in the work of [[Dineo Seshee Bopape]] and CUSS Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Williams-Wynn|first1=Christopher|last2=McCulloch|first2=Samantha|title=Between the Archive and the Real: Contemporary Digital Art and South Africa|journal=[[Third Text]]|year=2016|issn=0952-8822|doi=10.1080/09528822.2016.1213959|via=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their art gives insight into the pressing issues of South African society. On a global scale, contemporary South African art is relevant and sought-after. A charcoal and oil on canvas work by leading South African contemporary artist [[William Kentridge]] was sold on auction for R3,5&amp;nbsp;million in London in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Contemporary South African Artists|url=http://www.southafrica.net/za/en/articles/entry/article-southafrica.net-contemporary-south-african-artists|publisher=South Africa.net|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art 21, Inc|url=http://www.art21.org/artists/william-kentridge|website=Art 21|accessdate=13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Station North Arts and Entertainment District''' (often referred to as just '''Station North''') is an area and official arts and entertainment district in the [[United States|U.S.]] city of [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], [[Maryland]]. The neighborhood is marked by a combination of artistically-leaning commercial ventures, such as theaters and museums, as well as formerly abandoned warehouses that have since been converted into loft-style living. It is roughly triangular, bounded on the north by 20th Street, on the east by Greenmount Avenue, and on the south and west by the tracks of [[Amtrak]]'s [[Northeast Corridor]], though the neighborhood's boundaries include a one-block wide extension over the tracks.

==History==
Station North is composed of portions of three Baltimore neighborhoods: Charles North, Greenmount West, and Barclay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stationnorth.org/about |title=Station North: About |first=John McCartin |accessdate=July 23, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In recent decades, the area represented a relatively impoverished area between the wealthier neighborhoods of [[Mount Vernon, Baltimore|Mount Vernon]], [[Bolton Hill]], and [[Charles Village, Baltimore|Charles Village]]. However, in addition to its proximity to those neighborhoods, a number of factors made the area amenable to redevelopment and [[gentrification]]. Much of even the poorest sections of the neighborhood feature beautiful, three-story, early 20th-century [[rowhouse]]s as the main housing stock; the [[Maryland Institute College of Art]] is within walking distance; and [[Pennsylvania Station (Baltimore)|Penn Station]] lies at the south edge of the neighborhood, providing walking-distance access to Amtrak, [[Baltimore Light Rail|Light Rail]] and [[MARC Train|MARC commuter rail]] service (the latter being of particular interest to those commuting to [[Washington, D.C.]]). The [[United States housing bubble|real estate bubble]] of the 2000s caused Baltimore's housing prices to skyrocket, and drove home buyers seeking out cheaper areas on the upswing to the neighborhood.

The Baltimore city government's 2002 designation of the area as an arts district has furthered the neighborhood's transformation. The earliest and most visible signs of change were the official conversion of several industrial and warehouse buildings to mixed-use housing. The [[Copycat Building]] is probably the best known, but two other buildings—the Oliver Street Studios Building (which also houses Area 405 and the Station North Tool Library) and the Cork Factory—are also occupied. These buildings have been in use recently as artist's studios and benefitted by the area winning the State of Maryland's first Arts and Entertainment District status under then-mayor [[Martin O'Malley]]. Such designation paved the way for these buildings to be rezoned for residential use, due to the collaboration between multiple building owners in The District.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.citypaper.com/news/story.asp?id=4761 |title=For Industry to Easels - Arts District Designation Easing Conversion of Factories to Studios |first=Brennen Jensen |date=May 8, 2002 |publisher=Baltimore City Paper |accessdate=January 14, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708161929/http://www2.citypaper.com/news/story.asp?id=4761 |archivedate=July 8, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The neighborhood's commercial, residential, and artistic venues began to thrive. The commercial district on Charles Street is anchored by the [[Charles Theatre]], a popular art house multiplex that also serves as the anchor venue for the annual [[Maryland Film Festival]] each May, as well as Scapescape (a music and arts festival) each Labor Day weekend,[http://www.stationnortharts.com The Station North Arts Cafe Gallery], the Station North Arts Underground, [http://themetrogallery.net/ The Metro Gallery], Tapas Teatro, [http://www.clubcharles.us/ Club Charles], The Yellow Sign Theater, [http://www.strand-theater.org/ The Strand Theater], [http://singlecarrot.com/ Single Carrot Theater], and Sofi's Crepes; one block away is the [[Charm City Art Space]] which serves as a Music Venue, and Art Gallery.  In recent years, the North Avenue corridor has become a hub of activity with Joe Squared Restaurant, The Wind Up Space (an arts venue and bar), Liam Flynn's Ale House, and The Chicken Box, a Station North Arts District sponsored multiuse arts space opened in mid-2013. The Chicken Box is also home to the [http://www.baltimoreannextheater.org/ Baltimore Annex Theater].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bizjournals.com/baltimore/blog/real-estate/2012/12/station-north-arts-and-entertainment.html?page=all | title=Station North Arts and Entertainment, Annex Theater begin work on new space}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2005, the neighborhood was seeing a definite boom, but areas of blight persisted, particularly at the northern and eastern edges. As of 2010, the northern and eastern edges of Station North, particularly near Greenmount Avenue, are still affected by vacant housing, [[drug dealing]], and [[prostitution]]. This area stands in stark contrast to the environment only a few blocks west, where in 2007 the [https://web.archive.org/web/20060117031415/http://www.stationnorthtownhomes.com/ Station North Townhomes] were completed. The proximity of these luxury $300,000 townhouses to the remaining areas of urban decay illustrates both the potential and the challenges that the neighborhood faces.

==Maryland Arts and Entertainment District designation==
[[Image:Station North Arts District Baltimore Chas St.jpg|400px|right|thumb|Looking north on Charles Street, with the Charles Theatre on the right.]]
In Maryland, the State Department of Business and Economic Development designates certain neighborhoods “arts and entertainment districts”, which confers three specific tax breaks. Artists who live and work in the district are offered property-tax credits on qualifying renovations, can apply for an income-tax credit when they make money on their art, and are given a waiver of the admissions and amusement tax charged by the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.urbanitebaltimore.com/sub.cfm?issueID=50&amp;sectionID=4&amp;articleID=699 |title=The SoHo Effect: In a creative-class economy, cities are increasingly banking on artists to save neighborhoods.

Major tax benefits concerning building usage are also in place, with assessment freezes and building rehab credits to encourage growth.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

==Criticism of gentrification==
It has been argued that the Arts District designation confers little benefit to the artists who worked so tirelessly to rebuild the area and change the antiquated zoning laws which were heavy industrial, to mixed use - for studios, retail and living spaces. Many of the benefits promised residents and building owners when the District was formed have never materialized and the line of direct communication with the Mayor's office, which oversaw the transformation, is just a faded memory.

Although the city and state have developed preliminary plans to provide affordable housing and work space for local artists and residents,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baltimorehousing.org/pressroom_detail.asp?id=104 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120721072151/http://www.baltimorehousing.org/pressroom_detail.asp?id=104 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-21 |title=Preserving Affordable Housing in Greenmount West |first=John Fritze |date=unknown, 2007? |publisher=Baltimore Sun |accessdate=January 14, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; many argue that the area provides few actual benefits to working artists. This has fostered the sentiment that the city has been exploiting the cachet of the artists in Station North, while rarely working with them in any meaningful way.

Furthermore, as the neighborhood undergoes gentrification, there is the concern that, like [[SoHo]] in [[Manhattan]] before it, local artists and entertainers will be forced out of the neighborhood if a proper balance is not struck between redevelopment and the needs of artists and lower income residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.urbanitebaltimore.com/sub.cfm?issueID=50&amp;sectionID=4&amp;articleID=699 |title=The SoHo Effect: In a creative-class economy, cities are increasingly banking on artists to save neighborhoods.

==Transportation==

Station North's namesake comes from its placement of being north of [[Penn Station (Baltimore)|Penn Station]], which houses [[Amtrak]] and [[MARC (rail)|MARC]] trains. The [[Baltimore Light Rail]]  has two stations that are within proximity to the district; [[Penn Station (Baltimore)|Penn Station]] and [[North Avenue (Baltimore Light Rail station)|North Avenue]]. [[MTA Maryland]] bus lines 3, 8, 11, 13, 27, 36, 61, and 64 also service the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.google.com/maps/place/ST+PAUL+ST+%26+PENN+STATION+DR+sb/@39.3117647,-76.6175071,17z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x89c80494e6848cf5:0x603d8ba26f401b10?hl=en | title=SAINT PAUL ST &amp; PENN STATION fs sb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future plans==

A 2006 Action Plan Report, prepared by Randall Gross / Development Economics, the Baltimore Neighborhood Collaborative, and Station North Arts &amp; Entertainment, Inc., focuses on four key strategies: To strengthen positive image and identity, to establish commercial corridors, to provide housing options to attract new residents while preventing displacement of existing residents, and to encourage economic development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abagmd.org/usr_doc/SN_Action_Plan.pdf |title=Action Plan Report: Station North Strategic Plan |date=August 2006 |accessdate=January 15, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2008, Baltimore’s development arm, the Baltimore Development Corporation (BDC), released a preview of their master plan for the area. In the near term, the master plan includes converting the top three floors of Penn Station into a botique hotel, with long-term goals including construction of high-rise residential buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baltimoregrows.com/2008/01/29/master-plan-for-charles-north |title= Master Plan for Charles North |date=January 29, 2008 |accessdate=January 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 30, 2008, Mayor [[Sheila Dixon]] unveiled the Charles North Vision Plan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baltimoredevelopment.com/files/pdf/rfp/upload/CharlesNorth_Brochure_lowres.pdf |title=Press Release: Vision Plan for Charles North |accessdate=January 15, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091123032815/http://www.baltimoredevelopment.com/files/pdf/rfp/upload/CharlesNorth_Brochure_lowres.pdf |archivedate=November 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baltimoredevelopment.com/files/pdf/rfp/upload/Charles%20North%20Vision%20Plan%20Presentation.pdf |title=Charles North Vision Plan |accessdate=January 15, 2010}}{{dead link|date=June 2016}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt; a multi-phased development initiative. This plan identified four areas to focus revitalization on: Charles Gateway/Penn Station, the corner of Charles Street and North Avenue, the creation of an "Asia Town" at 20th Street and Charles Street, and the "Creative/Design Zone".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://baltimorecity.gov/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=xb8yKcmAVao%3d&amp;tabid=1177&amp;mid=2230 |title=Mayor Dixon and Central Baltimore Community Announce Charles North Vision Plan |date=October 30, 2008 |accessdate=January 15, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baltimoredevelopment.com/files/pdf/rfp/upload/0806%5b1%5d...L%20BOOK.pdf |title=Charles North: The Operations Manual |date=June 18, 2008 |accessdate=January 15, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan's ultimate goal is to transform the arts and entertainment district north of Pennsylvania Station into a $1 billion "cultural crossroads" for Baltimore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2008-10-30/news/0810290151_1_charles-north-north-vision-north-avenue |title=City unveils 30-year plan to transform 100-acre north pf Penn Station into a regional crossroads of culture |first=Edward Gunts |date=October 30, 2008 |publisher=The Baltimore Sun |accessdate=January 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan calls for over $100 million in subsidies to aid in the development of the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baltimoredevelopment.com/files/pdf/rfp/upload/Charles%20North%20Vision%20Plan%20Presentation.pdf |title=Charles North Vision Plan |accessdate=January 15, 2010}}{{dead link|date=June 2016}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:President Ali Khamenei reopening the National Museum of Iran.jpg|thumb|President [[Ali Khamenei]] looks towards the Statue; Reopening of National Museum of Iran, 8 February 1987]]
The '''Statue of Parthian Noble Man, National Museum of Iran 2401''' is one of the main surviving works of [[Parthian art]]. It is currently in the [[National Museum of Iran]] and was found at Shami (modern [[Khūzestān Province]]), where there was an ancient sanctuary.

The [[bronze]] statue is 1.94 m high. The man depicted is shown frontally. The figure's head is slightly too small in relation to the rest of its body and the face has a plain, unmodelled surface with an [[aquiline nose]]. The man bears a short beard and a heavy moustache, while his hair is long and covers the ears. Around the head he wears a wide ribbon. He wears a tunic with a V-shaped opening at the front and wears trousers. Around the neck he wears a necklace, perhaps a metal ring. The right hand and the entire left arm are missing. In Shami, however, there was found a bronze arm which might belong to this statue.

It is possible that the head and the body of the figure were crafted separately and put together in Shami, as the head is too small and made from a different type of bronze as to the rest of the statue.

The high quality of the art work caused some speculations of its production place. Some scholars believe that it was made by Greek or Roman artists.&lt;ref&gt;R.R.R. Smith: ''Hellenistic Royal Portraits'', Oxford, 1988, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue that it was produced in [[Palmyra]] or by an artist from this city,&lt;ref&gt;Hans Erik Mathiesen: ''Stylistic Trends in Late Parthian Sculpture, A Survey'', In: ''Analecta Romana Institut Danici'', 17-18 (1989), p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; while others suggest that it was made in [[Susa]]&lt;ref&gt;D. Schlumberger: ''L'Orient Hellenise'', Paris 1970, p. 156-157&lt;/ref&gt; (the nearest bigger ancient city).

The statue was found by local peasants but must have originally adorned a sanctuary at Shami, where several Hellenistic bronze statues were found. The statue depicts a noblemen from the [[Parthian Empire]].

The statue is hard to date. Scholars have proposed various datings ranging from the 2nd century BC to the 2nd century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Mathiesen: ''Sculpture in the Parthian Empire'', p. 167, n. 11 (list of various datings)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Charles Robert Leslie - Sir Walter Scott - Ravenswood and Lucy at the Mermaiden's Well - Bride of Lammermoor.jpg|thumb|200px|A scene from ''[[The Bride of Lammermoor]]'']]
'''Tales of my Landlord''' is a series of novels by Sir [[Walter Scott]] (1771–1832) that form a subset of the so-called [[Waverley Novels]]. There are four series:

{| class="wikitable"
! Title !! Published !! Main setting !! Period
|-
|colspan=4|''Tales of My Landlord'', 1st series:
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''[[The Black Dwarf (novel)|The Black Dwarf]]'' || 1816 || [[Scottish Borders]] || 1707
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''[[The Tale of Old Mortality]]'' || 1816 || Southern Scotland || 1679–89
|-
|colspan=4|''Tales of my Landlord'', 2nd series:
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''[[The Heart of Midlothian]]'' || 1818 || [[Edinburgh]], [[Richmond, London]], || 1736
|-
|colspan=4|''Tales of my Landlord'', 3rd series:
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''[[The Bride of Lammermoor]]'' || 1819 || [[East Lothian]] || 1709–11
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''[[A Legend of Montrose]]'' || 1819 || [[Scottish Highlands]] || 1644–5
|-
|colspan=4|''Tales of my Landlord'', 4th series:
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''[[Count Robert of Paris]]'' || 1832 || [[Constantinople]], [[Shkodër|Scutari]] || 1097
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''[[Castle Dangerous]]'' || 1832 || [[Kirkcudbrightshire]] || 1307
|}

Of these, ''The Heart of Midlothian'' and ''The Bride of Lammermoor'' have been the most successful, and ''Old Mortality'' is considered by modern critics to be among Scott's best work. The fourth were the least successful.

They were so called because they were supposed to be tales collected from the (fictional) landlord of the Wallace Inn at Gandercleugh, compiled by a "Peter Pattieson", and edited and sent to the publisher by [[Jedediah Cleishbotham]]. This is gone into in great depth in the introduction to ''The Black Dwarf''.

The first series was planned to comprise four volumes, each containing a separate novel, but Scott — by his own admission — botched ''The Black Dwarf'', and ''Old Mortality'' came to be three volumes in its own right. [http://www.walterscott.lib.ed.ac.uk/works/novels/dwarf.html]. The other three series thus consisted of two volumes each, or just one, in the case of the second.

They were supposed to reflect aspects of Scottish regional life.

The '''Terracotta Army''' is a collection of [[terracotta]] sculptures depicting the armies of [[Qin Shi Huang]], the first [[Emperor of China]]. It is a form of [[funerary art]] buried with the emperor in 210–209 BCE with the purpose of protecting the emperor in his afterlife.

The figures, dating from approximately the late third century BCE,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=TL dating of pottery sherds and baked soil from the Xian Terracotta Army Site, Shaanxi Province, China |author=Lu Yanchou, Zhang Jingzhao, Xie Jun |journal= International Journal of Radiation Applications and Instrumentation.

== History ==
[[File:秦始皇帝陵.JPG|thumb|right|The mound where the tomb is located]]
The construction of the tomb was described by historian [[Sima Qian]] (145{{ndash}}90 BCE) in his most noted work ''[[Shiji]]'', written a century after the mausoleum's completion.  Work on the mausoleum began in 246 BCE soon after Emperor Qin (then aged 13) ascended the throne, and the project eventually involved 700,000 workers.&lt;ref name="chinesetext"/&gt; Geographer [[Li Daoyuan]], writing six centuries after the First Emperor's death, recorded in ''[[Shui Jing Zhu]]'' that Mount Li was a favoured location due to its auspicious geology, "famed for its jade mines, its northern side was rich in gold, and its southern side rich in beautiful jade; the First Emperor, covetous of its fine reputation, therefore chose to be buried there".{{sfn|Clements|2007|p = 158}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/%E6%B0%B4%E7%B6%93%E6%B3%A8/19 Shui Jing Zhu Chapter 19] 《水经注·渭水》'''Original text:''' 秦始皇大兴厚葬，营建冢圹于骊戎之山，一名蓝田，其阴多金，其阳多美玉，始皇贪其美名，因而葬焉。&lt;/ref&gt; Sima Qian wrote that the First Emperor was buried with palaces, towers, officials, valuable artifacts and wondrous objects. According to this account, 100 flowing rivers were simulated using mercury, and above them the ceiling was decorated with heavenly bodies below which were the features of the land. Some translations of this passage refer to "models" or "imitations"; however, those words were not used in the original text, which makes no mention of the terracotta army.&lt;ref name="chinesetext"&gt;[http://ctext.org/pre-qin-and-han?filter=d270 Sima Qian –  Shiji Volume 6] 《史记·秦始皇本纪》 '''Original text:''' {{lang|zh-hans|始皇初即位，穿治郦山，及并天下，天下徒送诣七十余万人，穿三泉，下铜而致椁，宫观百官奇器珍怪徙臧满之。令匠作机驽矢，有所穿近者辄射之。以水银为百川江河大海，机相灌输，上具天文，下具地理。以人鱼膏为烛，度不灭者久之。二世曰："先帝后宫非有子者，出焉不宜。" 皆令从死，死者甚众。葬既已下，或言工匠为机，臧皆知之，臧重即泄。大事毕，已臧，闭中羡，下外羡门，尽闭工匠臧者，无复出者。树草木以象山。}} '''Translation:'''  When the First Emperor ascended the throne, the digging and preparation at Mount Li began. After he unified his empire, 700,000 men were sent there from all over his empire. They dug down deep to underground springs, pouring copper to place the outer casing of the coffin. Palaces and viewing towers housing a hundred officials were built and filled with treasures and rare artifacts. Workmen were instructed to make automatic crossbows primed to shoot at intruders. Mercury was used to simulate the hundred rivers, the Yangtze and Yellow River, and the great sea, and set to flow mechanically. Above, the heaven is depicted, below, the geographical features of the land. Candles were made of "mermaid"'s fat which is calculated to burn and not extinguish for a long time. The Second Emperor said: "It is inappropriate for the wives of the late emperor who have no sons to be free", ordered that they should accompany the dead, and a great many died. After the burial, it was suggested that it would be a serious breach if the craftsmen who constructed the tomb and knew of its treasure were to divulge those secrets.  Therefore, after the funeral ceremonies had completed, the inner passages and doorways were blocked, and the exit sealed, immediately trapping the workers and craftsmen inside. None could escape. Trees and vegetation were then planted on the tomb mound such that it resembled a hill.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Portal|2007|p=17}} High levels of mercury were found in the soil of the tomb mound, giving credence to Sima Qian's account.{{sfn|Portal|2007|p=202}} Later historical accounts suggested that the tomb had been looted by [[Xiang Yu]], a contender for the throne after the death of the first emperor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/%E6%B0%B4%E7%B6%93%E6%B3%A8/19 Shui Jing Zhu Chapter 19] 《水经注·渭水》 '''Original text:''' 项羽入关，发之，以三十万人，三十日运物不能穷。关东盗贼，销椁取铜。牧人寻羊，烧之，火延九十日，不能灭。'''Translation:''' Xiang Yu entered the gate, sent forth 300,000 men, but they could not finish carrying away his loot in 30 days.

[[File:2015-09-22-081415 - Terrakotta-Armee, Grosse Halle.jpg|thumb|left|Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor, Hall 1]]

The Terracotta Army is part of a much larger [[necropolis]].  Ground-penetrating radar and core sampling have measured the area to be approximately 98 square kilometers (38 square miles).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/10/china-first-emperor-terra-cotta-warriors-tomb/?sf38672445=1|title=Discoveries May Rewrite History of China's Terra-Cotta Warriors|date=12 October 2016|access-date=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The necropolis was constructed as a microcosm of the emperor's imperial palace or compound, and covers a large area around the tomb mound of the first emperor. The earthen tomb mound is located at the foot of Mount Li and built in a [[Chinese pyramids|pyramidal]] shape,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=73号 Qin Ling Bei Lu |url=http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&amp;source=embed&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=34.38130,+109.25365&amp;aq=&amp;sll=53.800651,-4.064941&amp;sspn=14.588871,37.265625&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;t=h&amp;ll=34.381864,109.254398&amp;spn=0.004967,0.009098&amp;z=16 |title=Google maps |date=1 January 1970 |accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is surrounded by two solidly built [[rammed earth]] walls with gateway entrances. The necropolis consists of several offices, halls, stables, other structures as well as an imperial park placed around the tomb mound.

The warriors stand guard to the east of the tomb. Up to {{convert|5|m}} of reddish, sandy soil had accumulated over the site in the two millennia following its construction, but archaeologists found evidence of earlier disturbances at the site. During the excavations near the Mount Li burial mound, archaeologists found several graves dating from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, where diggers had apparently struck terracotta fragments. These were discarded as worthless and used along with soil to back fill the excavations.{{sfn|Clements|2007|p=160}}

The soldiers within were laid out as if to protect the tomb from the east, where the Qin Emperor's conquered states lay.

This design was also used for the tombs of nobles and would have resembled palace hallways when built. The wooden ceilings were covered with reed mats and layers of clay for waterproofing, and then mounded with more [[soil]] raising them about {{convert|2|to|3|m}} above the surrounding ground level when completed.{{sfn|Portal|2007}}

==== Others ====

Pit 2 has cavalry and infantry units as well as [[Chariot (China)|war chariots]] and is thought to represent a military guard. Pit 3 is the command post, with high-ranking officers and a war chariot. Pit 4 is empty, perhaps left unfinished by its builders.

Some of the figures in Pits 1 and 2 show fire damage, while remains of burnt ceiling rafters have also been found.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8676886.stm |title=China unearths 114 new Terracotta Warriors |publisher=BBC News  |date=12 May 2010|accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These, together with the missing weapons, have been taken as evidence of the reported looting by Xiang Yu and the subsequent burning of the site, which is thought to have caused the roof to collapse and crush the army figures below. The terracotta figures currently on display have been restored from the fragments.

Other pits that formed the necropolis have also been excavated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.travelchinaguide.com/cityguides/xian/terracotta/pits.htm |title=Terracotta Accessory Pits |publisher=Travelchinaguide.com |date=10 October 2009 |accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These pits lie within and outside the walls surrounding the tomb mound. They variously contain bronze carriages, terracotta figures of entertainers such as acrobats and strongmen, officials, stone armour suits, burial sites of horses, rare animals and labourers, as well as bronze cranes and ducks set in an underground park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/m/daminggong/2010-05/13/content_9845517_3.htm |title=Decoding the Mausoleum of Emperor Qin Shihuang |work=China Daily  |date=13 May 2010 |accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Types and appearance===

[[File:I was impressed with the life-like expression (35300697030).jpg|thumb|left|A terracotta soldier]]
The terracotta figures are life-sized. They vary in height, uniform, and hairstyle in accordance with rank. Their faces appear to be different for each individual figure; scholars, however, have identified 10 basic face shapes.&lt;ref name="national geographic"&gt;{{cite book |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=TrPmZXt-wIEC|page=27}} |title =The Terra Cotta Warriors |work=National Geographic Museum |page=27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The figures are of these general types: armored warriors; unarmored [[infantrymen]]; [[cavalrymen]] who wear a pillbox hat; helmeted drivers of chariots with more armor protection; spear-carrying charioteers; kneeling archers who are armored; standing archers who are not; as well as generals and other lower-ranking officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=DbtrAwAAQBAJ|page=110}}|title=The Terracotta Warriors: The Secret Codes of the Emperor's Army |first= Maurice |last=Cotterell |publisher=Inner Traditions Bear and Company|date=June 2004|isbn=978-1591430339 |pages=105–112 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are, however, many variations in the uniforms within the ranks: for example, some may wear shin pads while others not; they may wear either long or short trousers, some of which may be padded; and their body armors vary depending on rank, function, and position in formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=DbtrAwAAQBAJ|page=103}}|title=The Terracotta Warriors: The Secret Codes of the Emperor's Army |first= Maurice |last=Cotterell |publisher=Inner Traditions Bear and Company|date=June 2004|isbn=978-1591430339 |pages=103–105 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also terracotta horses placed among the warrior figures.

[[File:Recreated colored terracotta warriors.jpg|thumb|Recreated figures of an archer and an officer, showing how they would have looked when painted]]

Originally, the figures were painted with bright pigments, variously coloured pink, red, green, blue, black, brown, white and lilac.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Simpson, Greg Hurst 3 December 2011 12:01&amp;nbsp;am |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article2414695.ece |title=Terracotta soldier – in full colour |work=The Times |location=UK |accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2010-09/09/content_11278335.htm |title=Terracotta army emerges in its true colors |work=China Daily  |accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coloured lacquer finish and individual facial features would have given the figures a realistic feel. However, much of the colour coating had flaked off or become greatly faded.

Some scholars have speculated a possible [[Hellenistic]] link to these sculptures, because of the lack of life-sized and realistic sculptures before the Qin dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soas.ac.uk/news/newsitem89619.html Early links with West likely inspiration for Terracotta Warriors, argues SOAS scholar], School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), University of London&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lukas Nickel, [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=9035632 The First Emperor and sculpture in China], SOAS, University of London, Cambridge University Press, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; They argued that potential Greek influence is particularly evident in some terracotta figures such as those of acrobats, as well as the technique used for casting bronze sculptures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-37624943 |title=Western contact with China began long before Marco Polo, experts say |date=12 October 2016 |work=BBC }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/china-terracotta-army-ancient-greek-sculptors-alexander-the-great-marco-polo-a7357606.html | title = Ancient Greeks may have built China's famous Terracotta Army – 1,500 years before Marco Polo| last = Johnston | first = Ian | date = 13 October 2016 | website = Independent.co.uk | access-date = 14 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this idea is disputed by scholars and it has been pointed out that there is "no substantial evidence at all" for contact between ancient Greeks and Chinese builders of the tomb.&lt;ref name=han-sil&gt;{{cite web |author1 = Hanink, Johanna | author2 = Silva, Felipe Rojas |date= 20 November 2016 | url=https://www.livescience.com/56939-china-terracotta-warriors-stir-controversy.html |title=Why China's Terracotta Warriors Are Stirring Controversy |publisher=Live Science}} Originally published in {{cite web|last1=Hanink&lt;!-- Associate Professor of Classics, Brown University  --&gt;|first1=Johanna|last2=Silva&lt;!-- Assistant Professor of Archaeology and the Ancient World, Brown University --&gt;|first2=Felipe Rojas|title=Why there's so much backlash to the theory that Greek art inspired China's Terracotta Army|url=https://theconversation.com/why-theres-so-much-backlash-to-the-theory-that-greek-art-inspired-chinas-terracotta-army-67488|publisher=The Conversation|date=18 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is argued that such speculations in its core rest on flawed and old "Eurocentric" ideas that assumed other civilizations were incapable of sophisticated artistry and thus foreign artistry must be seen through western traditions.&lt;ref name=han-sil/&gt;

===Construction===
The terracotta army figures were manufactured in workshops by government laborers and local craftsmen using local materials. Heads, arms, legs, and torsos were created separately and then assembled by [[luting]] the pieces together. When completed, the terracotta figures were placed in the pits in precise military formation according to rank and duty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.upf.edu/materials/huma/central/abast/ledder.htm |title=A Magic Army for the Emperor |publisher=Upf.edu |date=1 October 1979 |accessdate=3 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111128181533/http://www.upf.edu/materials/huma/central/abast/ledder.htm |archivedate=28 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The faces were created using [[Molding (process)|molds]], and at least ten face molds may have been used.&lt;ref name="national geographic"/&gt; Clay was then added after assembly to provide individual facial features to make each figure appear different.{{sfn|Portal|2007|p=170}} It is believed that the warriors' legs were made in much the same way that terracotta drainage pipes were manufactured at the time. This would classify the process as [[assembly line]] production, with specific parts manufactured and assembled after being fired, as opposed to crafting one solid piece and subsequently firing it. In those times of tight imperial control, each workshop was required to inscribe its name on items produced to ensure quality control. This has aided modern historians in verifying which workshops were commandeered to make tiles and other mundane items for the terracotta army.

=== Weaponry ===
[[File:Bronze jian of the Terracotta Army.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Bronze ''[[jian]]'' sword with chrome plating]]
Most of the figures originally held real weapons, which would have increased their realism. The majority of these weapons were looted shortly after the creation of the army or have rotted away.  Despite this, over 40,000 bronze items of weaponry have been recovered, including swords, daggers, spears, lances, battle-axes, scimitars, shields, crossbows, and crossbow triggers. Most of the recovered items are arrowheads, which are usually found in bundles of 100 units.&lt;ref name="lecture"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.travelchinaguide.com/attraction/shaanxi/xian/terra_cotta_army/weapon_1.htm |title=Exquisite Weaponry of Terra Cotta Army |publisher=Travelchinaguide.com |accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Making Weapons for the Terracotta Army |authors= Marcos Martinón-Torres, Xiuzhen Janice Li, Andrew Bevan, Yin Xia, Zhao Kun, Thilo Rehren |date =2011 |journal= Archaeology International|volume= 13 |pages=65–75 |doi=10.5334/ai.1316 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=DbtrAwAAQBAJ|page=99}}|title=The Terracotta Warriors: The Secret Codes of the Emperor's Army |first= Maurice |last=Cotterell |publisher=Inner Traditions Bear and Company|date=June 2004|isbn=978-1591430339 |pages=99–102 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of these arrowheads suggests that they were produced by self-sufficient, autonomous workshops using a process referred to as ''cellular production'' or ''[[Toyotism]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/chinese-terra-cotta-warriors-had-real-and-very-carefully-made-weapons/2012/11/26/999b9cb4-2840-11e2-b4e0-346287b7e56c_story.html |title=Chinese terra cotta warriors had real, and very carefully made, weapons | first=Jennifer |last=Pinkowski |date=26 November 2012|work=The Washington Post }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some weapons were coated with a 10–15 micrometer layer of [[chromium dioxide]] before burial that has protected them from any form of decay for the last 2200 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinatourguide.com/xian/terracotta_warriors_details.html|title=Terracotta Warriors (Terracotta Army)|publisher=China Tour Guide|accessdate=28 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=K5PpAAAAMAAJ|page=102}}|title=China's imperial tombs and mausoleums|author=Zhewen Luo|year=1993|publisher=Foreign Languages Press|isbn=978-7-119-01619-1|accessdate=28 June 2010|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; The swords contain an alloy of copper, tin, and other elements including nickel, magnesium, and cobalt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalgeographic.co.uk/terracottawarriors/assets/tcw-exhibition-eguide.pdf|title=Terracotta Warriors|year=2009|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=28 July 2011}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some carry inscriptions that date their manufacture to between 245 and 228 BCE, indicating that they were used before burial.&lt;ref name="bm"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/PDF/Teachers_resource_pack_30_8a.pdf |title=The First Emperor - China's Terracotta Army - Teacher's Resource Pack |publisher=British Museum }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scientific research ==

In 2007, scientists at [[Stanford University]] and the [[Advanced Light Source]] facility in Berkeley, California reported that [[powder diffraction]] experiments combined with [[energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy]] and [[micro-X-ray fluorescence]] analysis showed that the process of producing terracotta figures colored with [[Han purple and Han blue|Chinese purple]] dye consisting of [[barium]] [[copper]] [[silicate]] was derived from the knowledge gained by [[Taoist]] [[alchemy|alchemists]] in their attempts to synthesize [[jade]] [[Ornament (art)|ornaments]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bertrand|first=Loïc|author2=Robinet, Laurianne |author3=Thoury, Mathieu |author4=Janssens, Koen |author5=Cohen, Serge X. |author6= Schöder, Sebastian |title=Cultural heritage and archaeology materials studied by synchrotron spectroscopy and imaging|journal=[[Applied Physics A]]|date=26 November 2011|volume=106|issue=2|pages=377–396|doi=10.1007/s00339-011-6686-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Liu|first=Z.|author2=Mehta, A. |author3=Tamura, N. |author4=Pickard, D. |author5=Rong, B. |author6=Zhou, T. |author7= Pianetta, P. |title=Influence of Taoism on the invention of the purple pigment used on the Qin terracotta warriors|journal=[[Journal of Archaeological Science]]|date=November 2007|volume=34|issue=11|pages=1878–1883|doi=10.1016/j.jas.2007.01.005|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440307000131|citeseerx=10.1.1.381.8552}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2006, an international team of researchers at the [[UCL Institute of Archaeology]] have been using [[analytical chemistry]] techniques to uncover more details about the production techniques employed in the creation of the Terracotta Army. Using [[X-ray fluorescence]] spectrometry of 40,000 bronze [[arrowhead]]s bundled in groups of 100, the researchers reported that the arrowheads within a single bundle formed a relatively tight cluster that was different from other bundles. In addition, the presence or absence of metal impurities was consistent within bundles. Based on the arrows’ chemical compositions, the researchers concluded that a [[cellular manufacturing]] system similar to the one used in a modern [[Toyota]] factory, as opposed to a continuous [[assembly line]] in the early days of the automobile industry, was employed.&lt;ref name="rsc"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Rees|first=Simon|title=Chemistry unearths the secrets of the Terracotta Army|url=https://eic.rsc.org/feature/chemistry-unearths-the-secrets-of-the-terracotta-army/2000074.article|magazine=[[Education in Chemistry]]|volume=51|issue=2|pages=22–25|publisher=[[Royal Society of Chemistry]]|accessdate=29 March 2014|date=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Martinón-Torres|first=Marcos|author2=Li, Xiuzhen Janice |author3=Bevan, Andrew |author4=Xia, Yin |author5=Zhao, Kun |author6= Rehren, Thilo |title=Forty Thousand Arms for a Single Emperor: From Chemical Data to the Labor Organization Behind the Bronze Arrows of the Terracotta Army|journal=Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory|volume=21|issue=3|pages=534|date=20 October 2012|doi=10.1007/s10816-012-9158-z|url=http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1361957/1/Rehren_Forty_thousand_arms_for_a_single_emperor.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Questors Theatre''' is a theatre venue located in the [[London Borough of Ealing]], west [[London]]. It is home of The Questors, a large theatre company which hosts a season of around twenty productions a year and is a member of the ''[[Little Theatre Guild of Great Britain]]'' and the ''[[International Amateur Theatre Association]]''.

==Activities==
The Questors theatre club was founded in 1929 by a group of 17 amateur performers and friends,&lt;ref&gt;Evans et al.&lt;/ref&gt; and – pursuing an adventurous artistic policy led by one of the founders, Alfred Emmet – has grown into a vibrant theatre company which in the 2013-14 season staged productions of 17 plays (drawing all actors and backstage teams from its membership), and 2 student productions.&lt;ref&gt;The Questors Annual Review 20013/14.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2014 the company had 1,344 members (of whom about 300 were actors and about 200 worked backstage and front-of-house, with the remainder supporting the theatre as audience members).&lt;ref&gt;The Questors Annual Review 20013/14.&lt;/ref&gt; The company also runs Questors Academy which provides actor training and a youth theatre.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.questors.org.uk/academy (retrieved 6 October 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Site==
In 1964 The Questors completed the construction of a new theatre building, which was opened by [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother]] in April 1964, replacing the previous theatre building which had been converted from an old church. This new theatre's adaptable configuration was one of the first in a new wave of [[thrust stage]] theatres in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Evans et al.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2014, to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the opening, it was renamed the Judi Dench Playhouse.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thestage.co.uk/news/2014/questors-theatre-building-renamed-judi-dench-playhouse/ (retrieved 6 October 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

The site also contains a studio theatre (the [[Constantin Stanislavski|Constantin Stanislavsky]] Room, built as a rehearsal room in 1960 and converted into a studio theatre in 1968), three rehearsal rooms (the [[George Bernard Shaw|Bernard Shaw]] Room built in 1958; the [[Michael Redgrave]] Room, opened in 1968, converted from part of the original Mattock Lodge; and the Alfred Emmet Room built in 1998), a scenery workshop, and a members' bar (The Grapevine, opened in 1959, converted from part of Mattock Lodge).&lt;ref&gt;Evans et al.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The original building on the site, Mattock Lodge, is a house dating from the early 1850s, owned from around 1895 by Father O'Halloran who built a small church on the land behind the house, and on his death willed all the property to Miss Ann Webb as life tenant, who then lived in the house with her sister.&lt;ref&gt;Evans et al.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933 The Questors theatre club, looking for a permanent venue, were invited to share the old church premises by the Ealing [[Boy Scout]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Evans et al.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938 The Questors took over as the sole users of the old church building and, following the death of Miss Webb, bought the freehold of the complete site on 25 April 1952 for £8,500.&lt;ref&gt;Evans et al.&lt;/ref&gt;

==New plays==
Throughout their history The Questors have regularly produced new plays, including an annual New Plays Festival from 1960 to 1977. They have staged three new plays by [[Rodney Ackland]] (''The Dark River'', 1943; ''The Diary of a Scoundrel'', adapted from Ostrovsky, 1946; and ''The Other Palace'', 1952), as well five new plays by [[James Saunders (playwright)|James Saunders]], four new plays by [[Dannie Abse]], four new plays by David Mowat, and new plays by [[David Storey]] (''Phoenix'', 1984) and [[Ruth Prawer Jhabvala]] (''Abode of Peace'', 1984).&lt;ref&gt;Evans et al.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1964, The Questors presented six one-act plays at the Forum-Theatre, Berlin. One of these was ''Guildenstern &amp; Rosencrantz'' written and directed by [[Tom Stoppard]]. The cast included [[Peter Whelan]] as Guildenstern. The production was staged the following month at The Questors Theatre, and Stoppard subsequently expanded his one-act play into ''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://archive.questors.org.uk/prods/1964/berlinplays/page.html (retrieved 6 October 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Training==
The Questors established a Student Group in 1946 to train actors. Initially it was a one-year part-time course, but since 1949 has offered two years of part-time training, based on the acting techniques of [[Constantin Stanislavski]].&lt;ref&gt;Evans et al.&lt;/ref&gt; The Questors also run a large youth theatre (which in 2013-14 had about 460 members) and evening classes for beginner actors, and since 2012 have worked in partnership with the [[University of West London]] to provide a BA Hons course in Technical Theatre Production.&lt;ref&gt;The Questors Annual Review 20013/14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coarse acting==

Writer [[Michael Green (humorist)|Michael Green]] drew upon his experiences as an acting member of The Questors (from 1953) when he wrote his book ''[[The Art of Coarse Acting]]'' (published 1964) which he dedicated to The Questors.&lt;ref&gt;Evans et al.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972 The Questors hosted the ''World Coarse Acting Championship'', and then took ''The Coarse Acting Show'' to the 1977 [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] and ''The Coarse Acting Show 2'' to the 1979 Festival Fringe.&lt;ref&gt;Evans et al. &amp; http://archive.questors.org.uk/index.html (retrieved 6 October 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Coarse Acting Show 2'' subsequently transferred to the [[Shaftesbury Theatre]], [[London]], where it was visited by [[Charles, Prince of Wales|HRH The Prince of Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;Evans et al.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984 The Questors presented the ''Third Great Coarse Acting Show'' at The Questors Theatre (which was again visited by HRH The Prince of Wales), and in 1988 took ''Coarse Acting Strikes Back'' to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.&lt;ref&gt;Evans et al. &amp; http://archive.questors.org.uk/index.html (retrieved 6 October 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presidents==
Among those who accepted an invitation between 1930 and 1944 to serve as The Questors' Presidents were [[Robert Atkins (actor)|Robert Atkins]], Ion Swinley, [[Ben Webster (actor)|Ben Webster]], [[Gwen Ffrangcon-Davies]] and [[Margaret Webster]].&lt;ref&gt;Evans et al.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent presidents have been:&lt;ref&gt;Evans et al.&lt;/ref&gt;
*John Burrell (1944–52)
*[[Tyrone Guthrie]] (1952–58)
*[[Michael Redgrave]] (1958–85)
*[[Judi Dench]] (1985–present)

'''Traditional metal working in Mexico''' dates from the [[Mesoamerica]]n period with metals such as gold, silver and copper. Other metals were mined and worked starting in the colonial period. The working of gold and silver, especially for jewelry, initially declined after the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]]. However, during the colonial period, the working of metals rose again and took on much of the character traditional goods still have.  Today, important metal products include those from silver, gold, copper, iron, [[tin]] and more made into jewelry, household objects, furniture, pots, decorative objects, toys and more. Important metal working centers include [[Taxco]] for silver, [[Santa Clara del Cobre]] for copper, [[Celaya]] for tin and [[Zacatecas, Zacatecas|Zacatecas]] for [[wrought iron]].

==History==

===Prehispanic period===
[[File:AztecGoldPalacioCV.JPG|thumb|150px|Aztec gold ornament from the 16th century at the [[Palace of Cortés, Cuernavaca]], Mexico]]
Metal working in Mesoamerica, especially of silver, gold and copper was advanced by the time the Spanish arrived, mostly concentrated in the modern states of [[Michoacán]], [[Oaxaca]] and [[Guerrero]].&lt;ref name="fonart"&gt;{{cite book |title= Art popular mexicano al estilo FONART/FONART’s style in Mexican popular art |year=1992 |publisher= Fondo Nacional para el Fomento de las Artesanías |location=Mexico City |isbn=968 29 4019 2|pages= V1-V17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aprahamian58"&gt;Aprahamian, p 58&lt;/ref&gt; The mining and working of metals probably came to Mesoamerican cultures from the south. Metal working was principally in gold, silver, tin and lead, with some copper work known in what is now Michoacán.&lt;ref name="jruiz1011"&gt;Ruiz, p.10-11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jruiz106"&gt;Ruiz, p.106&lt;/ref&gt; Gold was generally obtained in powder or pellet form in rivers and streams from various sites in Guerrero, Oaxaca, Michoacán, the [[Mexican Plateau|Central Highlands]] and the Mayan region.&lt;ref name="jruiz114"&gt;Ruiz, p.114&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jruiz12"&gt;Ruiz, p.12&lt;/ref&gt;  As silver rarely appeared on the surface it was almost exclusively mined.&lt;ref name="jruiz12"/&gt;

In the pre Hispanic period, metals were used to create needles, punches, tweezers, weapons and musical instrument but its most important uses, especially gold and silver, was as jewelry for the social elite and as offerings to the gods.&lt;ref name="aprahamian58"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jruiz15"&gt;Ruiz, p.15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mexdes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/la-plateria-como-artesania.html |title=La Plateria |publisher=Mexico Desconocido magazine |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |trans-title=Silver work |accessdate=December 21, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130209205047/http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/la-plateria-como-artesania.html |archivedate=February 9, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gold and silver were worked by hammering, plating and molds the blending of these and some casting was known.&lt;ref name="aprahamian58"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jruiz106"/&gt;&lt;ref name="artepueblo377"&gt;Arte del Pueblo, p. 377&lt;/ref&gt;  One pre Hispanic technique was to hammer metal flat, punch out a design and then layer this design over wood or leather, often used on shields.&lt;ref name="artepueblo377"/&gt;  Silver was less used in the pre Hispanic period as it was less valued as tribute. It did not have the same divine symbolic value that gold did.&lt;ref name="jruiz15"/&gt;  The use of copper was almost exclusive to the [[Purépecha Empire]] in what is now Michoacán when the Spanish arrived. Copper instruments included axes, hoes, scythes, punches, chisels, needles, pins, arrowheads, brooches, canes, handles, helmets, shields and small bells.&lt;ref name="jruiz106"/&gt;

===Colonial period===

According to tradition, one of the first gifts that [[Hernán Cortés]] received from [[Moctezuma II]] was a pair of discs, one in gold and one in silver, which represented the sun and moon respectively.&lt;ref name="mexdes"/&gt; The existence of gold and silver in Mexico was one of the main attractions for the Spanish in the New World, with the conquest of the [[Aztec Empire]] and subsequent exploration with the aim of finding more of these precious metals. Mining and metal working became a main aspect of the economy of colonial Mexico.&lt;ref name="jruiz1522"&gt;Ruiz, p.15, 22&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the emphasis was on the mining of gold, silver, copper, iron, lead, [[platinum]] and tin with much of the metal, especially gold, shipped to Spain.&lt;ref name="jruiz2154"&gt;Ruiz, p.21, 54&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, the working of metals in the new colony was heavily restricted or outright banned for several reasons, including protection of Spanish metal guilds, the fact that the work did not contribute to royal taxes and the fear that the indigenous would make weapons.&lt;ref name="jruiz114"/&gt;&lt;ref name="artepueblo409"&gt;Arte del Pueblo, p. 409&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aprahamian60"&gt;Aprahamian, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; However, these soon became impractical to enforce with the restrictions then only to the making of objects related to indigenous religion.&lt;ref name="jruiz21105"&gt;Ruiz, p.21, 105&lt;/ref&gt;  The Spanish introduced new metalworking techniques, especially the promoting of copper work by [[Vasco de Quiroga]] in Michoacan and various metals by [[Pedro de Gante]] in [[Mexico City]] .&lt;ref name="fonart"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jruiz114"/&gt;&lt;ref name="artepueblo409"/&gt; and eventually indigenous craftsmen competed with European ones.&lt;ref name="jruiz21105"/&gt; Most of Mexican colonial metal work copied that in Spain, which was Gothic in style and later Renaissance. These styles eventually defined the handcraft work of areas such as Oaxaca, [[Zacatecas]], [[Durango]], [[San Luis Potosí]] and [[Guanajuato]] .&lt;ref name="artepueblo410"&gt;Arte del Pueblo, p. 410&lt;/ref&gt;    However, after the Conquest, the making of jewelry in Mexico nearly disappeared, with precious metals shipped to Spain. Only after 1551, with the establishment of a Mexican upper class, did this return slowly. At first Spanish craftsmen arrived to work European methods including [[filigree]], [[repoussé and chasing]], engraving and the incrustation of precious stones. But during the colonial period, these craftsmen never reached the level of their contemporaries in Europe. Indigenous craftsmen were relegated in this area to producing cheaper jewelry with lesser metals.&lt;ref name="jruiz114118"&gt;Ruiz, p.114-118&lt;/ref&gt;

One exception to the relative lack of precious metal work was that in silver, which became more important over the colonial period after the start of trade with Asia in the 17th century. Mexico’s abundance made silver an important form of currency and silver working guilds gained prestige and power, mostly in the creation of coins, silverware, religious medallions, crosses and liturgical items.&lt;ref name="artepueblo377"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jruiz120"&gt;Ruiz, p.120&lt;/ref&gt; Indigenous silver jewelry often became marked by the use of silver coins as decoration. Trade with the Orient introduced elements to silver pieces such as pearls (later augmented by those found in the [[Gulf of California]]), turtle shell  and colored glass from Europe. The last was particularly popular with indigenous communities.&lt;ref name="artepueblo377"/&gt;  One item that was important in the 18th century were cigarette and snuff cases made of both silver and gold, as the habit of using tobacco became very fashionable among the upper classes. The creation of the cases waned in the 19th as lower classes began to use tobacco as well.&lt;ref name="jruiz122"&gt;Ruiz, p.122&lt;/ref&gt;

===Independence to the present===
[[File:CombAllende.JPG|thumb|19th century silver comb on display at the Allende House Museum in San Miguel Allende, Guanajuato]]
After the [[Mexican War of Independence]], much of Mexico metalworking continued to follow European trends, with elements added such as Mexican national symbols. Silverwork became less Baroque in nature and more secularized during the 19th century as political antagonism towards the Church grew and became more focused on items such as buttons, cane handles, pocket watches and hair decorations, incrustations as well as jewelry. The indigenous tended to keep more of the colonial era designs especially necklaces with dangling coins, glass and silver figurines, filigree.&lt;ref name="jruiz125"&gt;Ruiz, p.125&lt;/ref&gt;

As mines gave out in the 19th and 20th centuries, precious metalworking declined. Traditional utilitarian iron and copper working declined due to industrialization.&lt;ref name="artepueblo410"/&gt;  In the mid 20th century, a revival began in silver working in the town of Taxco, even though the area’s mines had given out. It began with the work of American artisan [[William Spratling]], who took traditional Mexican indigenous and colonial designs and gave them new adaptations, then teaching other artisans in the area. Today, Taxco’s silverwork is one of Mexico’s important exports of finished products.&lt;ref name="aprahamian60"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jruiz125"/&gt;  Copper working, mostly for utilitarian items and home décor continues in Santa Clara del Cobre, a tradition that has remained since the early colonial period.  These items include bowls, plates, pitchers, vases and their quality has won awards in both Mexico and abroad.&lt;ref name="fonart"/&gt;

==Jewelry making==
[[File:Artisan assembling pieces in the workshop of Oro de Monte¦ü Alba¦ün.jpg|thumb|left|Artisan assembling silver necklace in Oaxaca]]
[[File:JagNeckMAPDF.JPG|thumb|Silver necklace with ruby, emerald and Mexican opal with two jaguars in confrontation from Guadalajara on display at the Museum of Arte Popular in Mexico City]]
Jewelry making began well before the arrival of the Spanish, with mines providing supplies of metals and stones. The designs of modern Mexican handcrafted jewelry is a mixture of both Spanish and indigenous traditions. Indigenous designs are based on those seen in [[Mesoamerican codices]] and artifacts from archeological sites. Most of Mexico’s fine jewelry is made in silver, with the most important center being Taxco, Guerrero. A lesser known center is [[San Felipe del Progreso]] in the [[State of Mexico]]. Here traditional [[Mazahua people|Mazahua]] jewelry has seen a revival, especially the production of earrings used for Mazahua weddings, but also bracelets and necklaces.&lt;ref name="fonart"/&gt; In Guanajuato, jewelry making focuses on cast silver in colonial style often decorated with images of birds along with glass beads and pearls.&lt;ref name="artepueblo379"&gt;Arte del Pueblo, p. 379&lt;/ref&gt;   In [[Pátzcuaro]], artisans made necklaces and earrings of smooth or scratched silver, often with small dangling fish, combined with red and black porcelain beads. In [[Yalalag]], Oaxaca they make silver necklaces with colonial era style crosses.&lt;ref name="fonart"/&gt; In [[Huetamo]] and Zitácuaro, they made dangling earrings called arracadas of silver with images of leaves, flowers and birds. In [[Santa María Huazolotitlán|Huazolotitlán]], Oaxaca, they make beaded necklaces with crosses and small animals made of silver.&lt;ref name="artepueblo383"&gt;Arte del Pueblo, p. 383&lt;/ref&gt;

While gold jewelry making faded during the colonial period in Mexico, it is still done in a number of places such as Iguala and Taxco in Guerrero. In [[Ometepec]], large and small crosses are made with various metals along with gold necklaces of various colors. Gold filigree is an important trade in [[Chiapas]], often made with local [[amber]] .&lt;ref name="artepueblo379"/&gt;  Fine gold and silver wire is used by craftsmen in Oaxaca, [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]], Guerrero and Chiapas to create earrings, necklaces and bracelets with intricate designs.&lt;ref name="fonart"/&gt; In the [[Tierra Caliente (Mexico)|Tierra Caliente]] region of Michoacán, they make a type of dangling gold earring with the name of “siete lunas” or seven moons.&lt;ref name="artepueblo383"/&gt;  In Yucatán rosaries made with gold or gold plated filigree are popular often made with red and pink coral. Turtle shell jewelry is incrusted with gold and silver.   Soplillos are necklaces de cuentas de oro ochavadas in Yucatán.&lt;ref name="artepueblo387"&gt;Arte del Pueblo, p. 387&lt;/ref&gt; Fine jewelry making in [[Campeche]] tends to focus on the creation of earrings and rings with incrustations of gold and silver. Mayan influence can be seen in the large gold chains.&lt;ref name="artepueblo379"/&gt; In [[Quintana Roo]], a type of dangling earring called an arracadas in gold are popular since the 20th century, which includes men of high social status in Mayan communities.&lt;ref name="artepueblo387"/&gt; The creation of gold and silver jewelry is very varied in Oaxaca mixed with various other materials including coral, coins, colored glass and various stones.&lt;ref name="artepueblo383"/&gt;

==Silver==
[[File:SilverDishesFMayer.jpg|thumb|Display of silver dishes at the Franz Mayer Museum]]
Despite down from its peak in the colonial era, Mexico is still the number one producer of silver in the world.&lt;ref name="artepueblo391"&gt;Arte del Pueblo, p. 391&lt;/ref&gt; Silver pieces made in Mexico include [[candelabra]]s, jars, platters, necklaces and buttons for [[charro]] outfits.&lt;ref name="artepueblo394"&gt;Arte del Pueblo, p. 394&lt;/ref&gt;  Traditional silver work in Mexico has its origins in the colonial period, as the metal was not particularly prized in the Mesoamerican era.&lt;ref name="artepueblo391"/&gt;&lt;ref name="srlopez"&gt;{{cite news |title= Temen se pierda orfebreria barroca |first= Sergio Raul |last=Lopez |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=October 18, 2000 |page=2 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Fear of losing Baroque precious metal work }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mexican silver from the colonial era to the present can be found in many museum collections around the world.&lt;ref name="artepueblo3896"&gt;Arte del Pueblo, p. 396&lt;/ref&gt; There are still artisans which still make silver pieces in the style of the 17th and 18th centuries. However, these kind of work tends to bring more fame than money.&lt;ref name="srlopez"/&gt; Globalization has affected the design of silver pieces in Mexico as much of it is exported.&lt;ref name="artepueblo3896"&gt;Arte del Pueblo, p. 396&lt;/ref&gt; Most Mexican silver work today is updated designs, a trend that dates from the work of William Spratling in Taxco, making Mexico again a center of export for finished pieces.&lt;ref name="artepueblo391"/&gt; The tradition continues here, with some schools that teach the trade but most smiths learn through a term of apprenticeship, often as a part of the family business.&lt;ref name="artepueblo397"&gt;Arte del Pueblo, p. 397&lt;/ref&gt; Taxco has been designated a [[Pueblo Mágico]] in part because of its silver work, and it is home to the [[William Spratling Museum]], which has a collection of this silver work.&lt;ref name="mexdes"/&gt;

The number of artisans who can do traditional Mexican silver work is dwindling.&lt;ref name="srlopez"/&gt; To help preserve the tradition, every two years the Hugo Salinas Price National Silver Prize is awarded to Mexican silversmiths in various categories. It is sponsored by the Fomento Cultural Grupo Salinas, the [[Secretariat of Social Development|Secretaría de Desarrollo Social (SEDESOL)]], the [[National Fund for the Development of Arts and Crafts|Fondo Nacional para el Fomento de las Artesanías (FONART)]] and the [[Museo de Arte Popular]]. The purpose is to promote the craft in the country both in Mexico and abroad.&lt;ref name="salinas"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fomentoculturalgruposalinas.com.mx/quehacemos/concursoplata.aspx |title= Importancia del premio |publisher=Fomento Cultural Grupo Salinas|location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=Importance of the prize |accessdate=December 21, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Copper==
[[File:TablewareSCCobre.JPG|thumb|Copper products for sale in [[Santa Clara del Cobre]], Michoacán]]
While copper was worked in some parts of Mesoamerica, modern Mexican tradition is Spanish in origin.&lt;ref name="artepueblo416"&gt;Arte del Pueblo, p. 416&lt;/ref&gt; Copper working was initially ignored by the Spanish [[conquistador]]s as they were looking for gold and silver. It was not shipped to Spain as much as the other two. Instead, it eventually became important for the creation of utilitarian items, especially domestic items such as pots and pans.&lt;ref name="artepueblo410"/&gt; Today, the center of traditional copper work in Mexico is the state of Michoacán, especially the municipality of Santa Clara del Cobre.  One traditional hammered copper object is a large vessel in which pork fat is rendered or sugar caramelized for making candies. Every year during the month of August [[Santa Clara del Cobre]] holds a copper festival.&lt;ref name="hossack24"&gt;{{cite book |title= Handmade Style Mexico |last= Hossack |first= Karin |year=1999 |publisher= Chronicle Books |location= San Francisco |isbn=0-8118-2567-1 |page=24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iron==
[[File:LagunillaAntiques08.JPG|thumb|Antique iron tools and other items at the [[La Lagunilla Market, Mexico City]] ]]
Iron was not worked in the Mesoamerican period, with its mining and working introduced by the Spanish.&lt;ref name="artepueblo401"&gt;Arte del Pueblo, p. 401&lt;/ref&gt; Exploration of the metal was initially banned to protect the industry in Spain, but as tools made from the metal were essential for exploration and conquest, the prohibition was soon ignored.&lt;ref name="artepueblo409"/&gt;&lt;ref name="artepueblo402"&gt;Arte del Pueblo, p. 402&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the items were purely utilitarian such as tools, locks, horseshoes and tools.&lt;ref name="artepueblo401"/&gt;&lt;ref name="artepueblo414"&gt;Arte del Pueblo, p. 414&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the colonial period, iron began to be used in other ways, including decorative elements in churches and mansions such as railings and balconies.&lt;ref name="artepueblo409"/&gt; The height of traditional Mexican ironworking was in the 17 and 18th centuries.&lt;ref name="artepueblo401"/&gt;

Initially the main iron working centers were Puebla and Oaxaca.&lt;ref name="artepueblo401"/&gt; Oaxacan iron was exceptionally malleable and light allowing for intricate designs and tools not possible with other types of iron. Most Oaxacan iron objects date from the 17th and 18th centuries and include locks, furniture and scissors, often with intricate designs etched on them.&lt;ref name="artepueblo401402"&gt;Arte del Pueblo, p. 401-402&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the 18th century, there were important iron working centers in Oaxaca, Puebla, Mexico City, Guanajuato and [[Querétaro]], as well as western Mexico such as [[Guadalajara]], Zacatecas and [[Aguascalientes, Aguascalientes|Aguascalientes]], which eventually developed its own style. Western Mexican ironwork is distinguished by oriental influence due to trade with [[Manila]] as well as the use of iron for decorative purposes on wooden objects.&lt;ref name="artepueblo406"&gt;Arte del Pueblo, p. 406&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aleyniers"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Leyniers |first=A |date=May–August 2008 |title=El hierro forjado artístico en Zacatecas |trans-title=The artistic wrought iron of Zacatecas |journal=XII JORNADAS DE INVESTIGACIÓN Revista Investigación Científica |volume=4 |issue=2 |location=Zacatecas |publisher=Universidad Autónoma de Zacatecas |language=Spanish |issn=1870-8196 |accessdate=December 21, 2012 |url=http://www.uaz.edu.mx/cippublicaciones/ricvol4num2tom1/Arte%20y%20cultura/Elhierro.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304032831/http://www.uaz.edu.mx/cippublicaciones/ricvol4num2tom1/Arte%20y%20cultura/Elhierro.pdf |archivedate=March 4, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Handcrafted wrought iron is still important in [[San Miguel de Allende]], [[León, Guanajuato|Leon]], [[Guanajuato, Guanajuato|city of Guanajuato]], [[Guadalajara]], [[Teocaltiche]], [[Jalisco]], [[Morelia]], San Felipe de los Herreros, Michoacán, Mexico City, [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]] and [[Amozoc de Mota]].  It is used to make garden and home furniture, lamps, chimneys and chimney tools.&lt;ref name="artepueblo414"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aleyniers"/&gt; [[San Cristobal de las Casas]] is known for the creation of intricate crosses made of wrought iron, popular as symbols of divine protection.&lt;ref name="artepueblo414"/&gt;

==Tin==
[[File:Our Lady of San Juan de los Lagos votive 1911.jpg|thumb|Traditional votive painting on tin from 1911]]
In the colonial period, tin was worked for its functional rather than aesthetic value. It was created and sold in standard sheets, which were then cut, folded and joined to make various objects. These sheets also became a traditional base for [[Votive paintings of Mexico|folk ex votos]].&lt;ref name="mortiz"&gt;{{cite news |title= Tin exhibit mirrors wit, religion of Mexico |first= Mario G. |last=Ortiz |newspaper=Milwaukee Journal|location=Milwaukee, WI |date=Sep 8, 1992 |page=OZWC }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, tin and other sheet metals, often from industrial waste, is still used to create decorative and functional objects such as castles, churches, masks, airplane models, saints, nativity scenes, contains, mirror frames, chandeliers, lamps, trays and plates.&lt;ref name="fonart"/&gt;&lt;ref name="artepueblo416"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mortiz"/&gt; Another important line is toys, which are painted in bright enamels, especially in Celaya and San Miguel de Allende.&lt;ref name="fonart"/&gt; Other important centers include Oaxaca, [[Irapuato]], Mexico City, Puebla, [[Tlaxcala, Tlaxcala|Tlaxcala]] and [[Tlaquepaque]] .&lt;ref name="artepueblo416"/&gt;

==Other metals==

[[Brass]], tin and iron are used to create old fashioned lamps, decorative items for the home as well as furniture and sculptures.&lt;ref name="fonart"/&gt; The creation of brass and [[bronze]] objects was introduced by the Spanish. Bronze was mostly used for the casting of church bells, some tools and decorative elements on iron railings. The indigenous adapted it to the use of small bells used in ceremonial dances. Brass was used for many different types of implements, mostly for domestic use.&lt;ref name="artepueblo410"&gt;Arte del Pueblo, p. 410&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lead]] miniature figures are made for collectors although originally they are created as toys for children. They typically include soldiers, furniture, boats, machines and more in Romantic styles from the 19th century and before.&lt;ref name="fonart"/&gt; Celaya makes a wide variety of miniature for doll houses including figures, furniture, and decorations. Another popular line is toy soldiers. Most pieces are made with molds, some of which date from the 19th century, then painted.&lt;ref name="artepueblo417"&gt;Arte del Pueblo, p. 417&lt;/ref&gt;

The main producer of handcrafted metal eating utensils is the city of Oaxaca, with fine silverware produced in Taxco. Other areas that make this are in [[Cualac, Guerrero|Cualac]], [[Ciudad Altamirano, Guerrero|Ciudad Altamirano]], [[Ayutla, Jalisco|Ayutla]], and [[Tecpan de Galeana]] in Guerrero, especially blades such as utility knives and [[machete]]s.&lt;ref name="artepueblo416"/&gt;

:In 1941, Roy Sabre's girlfriend Betty mysteriously disappears. Ten years later he has constructed a time-machine and his first trip is to go back to find her. But his arrival is observed and his machine attacked and damaged as it departs; instead of returning to 1951, it travels to the far future where mankind has disappeared and the Earth is under the control of machines controlled by insects. Roy finds that several other time-travellers, due to damage and malfunction, have been cast forward to the same time...
* "'''Derelict of Space'''" (''Fantasy, Number 3'', 1939&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?61766 Bibliography: Derelict of Space] Retrieved 2013-08-11.&lt;/ref&gt;)
:The salvage of the ''Excelsis'', a spaceship reported lost 50 years earlier, ends in disaster when it breaks free of the magnetic hawsers attaching it to the space-tug ''Dido'' and, instead of splashing down in the North Atlantic, it impacts a German town with great loss of life on the ground. The captain and crew of the ''Dido'' are arrested and the German authorities demand their extradition to answer accusations that they stole the wreck's valuable cargo and hid it on the moon before deliberately crashing the hull as part of an anti-[[Nazi]] plot...
* "'''Child of Power'''" (''Fantasy, Number 3'', 1939&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?190566 Bibliography: Child of Power] Retrieved 2013-08-11.&lt;/ref&gt;)
:During a discussion on the next step in human evolution a doctor reveals that one of his patients, the son of a quarryman in [[Derbyshire]], was born 'electro-sentient' - that is, he was able to directly sense electromagnetic radiation, able to tune in to radio programs and diagnose problems with electrical equipment. The doctor expands on the opportunities and problems this presented  both the boy and his unimaginative working-class family, especially when the boy reveals he can also sense unknown languages emanating from outer space...
* "'''The Last Lunarians'''" (''Wonder Stories'', April 1934 as "The Moon Devils"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?78625 Bibliography: The Moon Devils] Retrieved 2013-08-11.&lt;/ref&gt;)
:Due to a mechanical problem, the ''Scintilla'' is forced to land on the edge of the [[Sea of Serenity]] whilst performing a survey for the Lunar Archaeological Society, and discovers an entrance to what appears to be an underground tomb for members of the extinct Lunarian race. But, the assumption that it is just a tomb proves tragically wrong; the Lunarians are woken from their slumber and determine to use the ''Scintilla'' to escape their dead world...
* "'''The [[Puff-ball]] Menace'''" (''Wonder Stories'', October 1933 as "Spheres of Hell"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?97456 Bibliography: Spheres of Hell] Retrieved 2013-08-11.&lt;/ref&gt;)
:The leaders of Ghangistan resolve that they cannot hope to defeat the West using conventional warfare and must seek an alternative. In [[Cornwall]] and west [[Devon]], hundreds of keen gardeners are contacted individually to perform a field trial of a new plant. The seeds grow rapidly into bulbous fungi, feet across but weighing only a pound or so. Rashes break out in people nearby and there are several deaths but, by the time a causal link to prematurely ruptured fungi is suspected it is too late - the puff-balls are nearing maturity, ready to spread their deadly spores, and a storm approaching from the west threatens to blow, not only the spores but also the puff-balls themselves, across the whole of southern England...

==History==
Women's Audio Mission (WAM) was founded by Terri Winston in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burgess|first=Richard James|title=The Art of Music Production: The Theory and Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p_UQH6L_n14C&amp;pg=PA195|year=2013|publisher=Oxford UP|isbn=9780199921744|page=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winston, who got a bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from [[Purdue University]],&lt;ref name="Christensen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spars.com/best-tracks/2012/09/spars-spotlights-womens-audio-mission-qa-with-terri-winston/|title=SPARS Spotlights Women’s Audio Mission: Q&amp;A with Terri Winston|last=Christensen|first=Paul|date=19 September 2012|publisher=Society of Professional Audio Recording Services|accessdate=8 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a multi-instrumentalist who had toured with P.J. Harvey, The Pixies, and The Flaming Lips. Winston had with a career in recording and engineering. Her father was an engineer and she "grew up in research labs around engineers that were always pulling pranks" on her; as a result, she said, she developed the thick skin necessary for a woman to succeed "in male-dominated careers".&lt;ref name="wimn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewimn.com/front-and-center-womens-audio-mission-founder-terri-winston/|title=Front and Center: Women's Audio Mission Founder, Terri Winston|publisher=Women's International Music Network|accessdate=8 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 2000s Winston was a professor at [[City College of San Francisco]], teaching recording engineering, when she founded WAM, the only all-female built and run professional recording studio in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://kalw.org/post/women-stem-terri-winston-and-women-s-audio-mission|title=Women in STEM: Terri Winston and Women’s Audio Mission|last=Chien|first=Jen|date=27 March 2014|publisher=[[KALW]]|accessdate=8 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a world-class facility located in downtown San Francisco, in the former SF Soundworks studio, home to projects by Alanis Morissette, Radiohead, R.E.M., and Timbaland with much of the equipment donated by various manufacturers.&lt;ref name="Christensen"/&gt;

WAM also organizes online classes; their Sound Channel program contains "animated, interactive e-textbooks that include audio examples, video demonstrations, DIY projects and quizzes" and was, according to Winston, used by 6,900 students in more than 131 countries.&lt;ref name="Christensen"/&gt;
