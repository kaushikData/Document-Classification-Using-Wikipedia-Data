The '''Academic Staff Union of Universities''' (ASUU) is a [[Nigeria]]n union of university academic staff, founded in 1978.

==Foundation==

The ASUU was formed in 1978, a successor to the Nigerian Association of University Teachers formed in 1965 and covering academic staff in all of the Federal and State Universities in the country.

==Military regime==

The union was active in struggles against the military regime during the 1980s.&lt;ref name=self/&gt;
In 1988 the union organized a National Strike to obtain fair wages and university autonomy. As a result, the ASUU was proscribed on 7 August 1988 and all its property seized. It was allowed to resume in 1990, but after another strike was again banned on 23 August 1992. However, an agreement was reached on 3 September 1992 that met several of the union's demands including the right of workers to collective bargaining. The ASUU organized further strikes in 1994 and 1996, protesting against the dismissal of staff by the [[Sani Abacha]] military regime.&lt;ref name=self/&gt;

==Fourth Republic==

After the return to democracy in 1999 with the [[Nigerian Fourth Republic]], the union continued to be militant in demanding the rights of university workers against opposition by the government of President [[Olusegun Obasanjo]].&lt;ref name=self/&gt;
In July 2002 Dr. Oladipo Fashina, the then national president of the union,petitioned Justice [[Mustapha Akanbi]] of the [[Independent Corrupt Practices Commission]] to investigate the authorities of the [[University of Ilorin]] for financial mismanagement and corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2007, the ASUU went on strike for three months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In May 2008, it held two one-week "warning strikes" to press a range of demands, including an improved salary scheme and reinstatement of 49 lecturers who were dismissed many years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In June 2009, ASUU ordered its members in federal and state universities nationwide to proceed on an indefinite strike over disagreements with the Federal Government on an agreement it reached with the union about two and a half years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

After three months of strikes, in October 2009, the union and other staff unions signed a memorandum of understanding with the government and called off the industrial action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Some Nigerian students said that the strike was a curse to them while others said it was a blessing before the ASUU strike was called.&lt;ref name = self/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Akademie von Athen.jpg|right|thumb|261x261px|The main building of the Academy of Athens, one of [[Theophil Hansen]]'s "Trilogy" in central Athens.]]
The '''Academy of Athens''' ({{lang-el|Ακαδημία Αθηνών}}, ''Akadimía Athinón'') is [[Greece]]'s [[national academy]], and the highest research establishment in the country. It was established in 1926, and operates under the supervision of the [[Ministry of National Education and Religious Affairs (Greece)|Ministry of Education]]. The Academy's main building is one of the major landmarks of Athens.

== History and structure ==
The organization of the Academy of Athens, whose title hearkens back to the ancient [[Academy of Plato]], was first established on 18 March 1926, and its charter was ratified by the law 4398/1929. This charter, with subsequent amendments, is still valid and governs the Academy's affairs. According to it, the Academy is divided into three Orders: Natural Sciences, Letters and Arts, Moral and Political Sciences.

=== Research centres===
The Academy today, maintains 14 research centres, seven research offices and the "Ioannis Sykoutris" central library. In 2002, the Foundation for Biomedical Research of the Academy of Athens was established. The Hellenic Institute for [[Byzantine]] and Post-Byzantine Studies in [[Venice]] also functions under the supervision of the Academy.

=== Membership in international organizations ===
From its foundation, the Academy of Athens has been a member of the [[International Association of Academies]] (AIA), and the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU). It also participates in the following body: [[All European Academies]] (ALLEA), European Academies Science Advisory Council (EASAC), [[Inter Academy Council]] (IAC), Inter Academy Medical Panel (IAMP).

== Main building ==

The main building of the Academy is a [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] building between [[Panepistimiou Street]] and [[Akadimias Street]] in the centre of Athens. The building was designed as part of an architectural "trilogy" in 1859 by the Danish architect [[Theophil Hansen]], along with the [[National and Kapodistrian University of Athens|University]] and the [[National Library of Greece|National Library]]. Funds had been provided by the magnate [[Simon Sinas]] specifically for the purpose, and the foundation stone was laid on 2 August 1859. Construction proceeded rapidly, after 1861 under the supervision of [[Ernst Ziller]], but the internal tumults during the latter years of King [[Otto of Greece|Otto]]'s reign, which resulted in his ousting in 1862, hampered construction until it was stopped in 1864. Works resumed in 1868, but the building was not completed until 1885, at a total cost of 2,843,319 gold [[drachma]]s, most of it provided by Sinas, and, after his death, by his wife Ifigeneia.

The Greek neo-classical sculptor [[Leonidas Drosis]] sculpted the principle multi-figure [[pediment]] sculpture, on the theme of the birth of Athena, based on a design by painter [[Carl Rahl]].  This brought first prize at the [[Weltausstellung 1873 Wien|Vienna Exhibition of 1873]].&lt;ref name="academyofathens.gr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.academyofathens.gr/en/building/exterior |title=The Exterior |work=Academy of Athens}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Drosis is also responsible for the figures of Athena and Apollo with lyre on the Academy's flanking pillars, and the seated marble figures of Plato and Socrates, which were executed "by the Italian sculptor Piccarelli".&lt;ref name="academyofathens.gr" /&gt;  The eight smaller pediments in the Academy complex are the terra-cotta work of Austrian sculptor Franz Melnitzky.&lt;ref&gt;Neoclassical Architecture in Greece, by Mānos G. Bīris, Márō Kardamítsī-Adámī, page 142&lt;/ref&gt;  Interior murals and paintings were done by the Austrian artist [[Christian Griepenkerl]].[[Image:2004 Greece 100 Euro OS Academy of Athens front.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Greece)#2004 coinage|Academy of Athens commemorative coin]]|alt=|left]]

On 20 March 1887, the building of the "Sinaean Academy", as it was called, was delivered by Ziller to the Greek Prime Minister, [[Charilaos Trikoupis]]. In the absence of a national Academy, the building was used for housing the [[Numismatic Museum of Athens|Numismatic Museum]] in 1890, and in 1914 the [[Byzantine &amp; Christian Museum|Byzantine Museum]] and the State Archives. Finally, on 24 March 1926, the building was handed over to the newly established Academy of Athens.

=== 2004 commemorative coin issue ===
[[File:Front Facade of the Academy of Athens.jpg|thumb|
Front facade at sunset.
]]The Academy of Athens was recently selected as main motif for a high value euro collectors' coin; the €100 Greek [[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Greece)#2004 coinage|Academy of Athens commemorative coin]], minted in 2004 to commemorate the [[2004 Summer Olympics]]. In the obverse of the coin, a close view of the building is depicted.  The intention was to highlight the premise that in the city of Athena, the Olympic Games should not only be the most important athletic event, but also reflect equal importance toward intellectual and cultural activities. All three should be equivalent to the style and character of the city that was the birthplace and the matrix for the revival of the modern Olympic Games.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7962">'''ArtsBridge''' is a university scholarship program in the United States created by [[Lawrence University]] president [[Jill Beck]] in April 1996 when she was dean of the [[Claire Trevor School of the Arts]] at the [[University of California, Irvine]].  She brought together groups of local elementary pupils to receive arts training from UCI arts majors.&lt;ref&gt;Haycox, Lori, [http://articles.latimes.com/1996-11-20/local/me-863_1_arts-bridge-scholars "Building an Arts Bridge to Area Schools"], ''Los Angeles Times,'' November 20, 1996. Retrieved 2012-02-27.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was designed to attract public and private funding to support scholarships for top arts graduate and undergraduate students who commit themselves to teaching their speciality to one or more classes of K-12 pupils in local schools.&lt;ref&gt;Perera, Andrea, [http://articles.latimes.com/2002/feb/06/local/me-class6 "Bridging the Artistic Gap for Students and Teachers"], ''Los Angeles Times,'' February 06, 2002. Retrieved 2012-02-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reason for creation ==
The program was a response to two perceived needs: (1) to provide financial aid to university students and (2) to help primary and secondary schools whose arts budgets had been wiped out by several economic downturns in California, including the passage in 1978 of [[Proposition 13]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/.const/.article_13A |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160124223517/http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/.const/.article_13A |archivedate=2016-01-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which restricted property taxes to such an extent that educational commitments to  [[File:AblogoBW.jpg|thumb|ArtsBridge logo 1998, at the time of expanding throughout UC campuses]]the state's children could not be met.  "ArtsBridge Scholars" aimed to fill in the arts gap by partnering with classroom teachers and teaching dance, drama, music or studio arts directly to pupils, requiring no payment from the schools' budgets and often providing the classes with musical instruments, cameras, and other physical accessories necessary to each art.

== The Original Program ==
UCI drama professor [[Keith Fowler]] served as the original director of ArtsBridge.&lt;ref&gt;Brandt, Lori, "State of the arts," ''Today@UCI,'' 08/29/2002, {{cite web |url=http://archive.today.uci.edu/Features/profile_detail.asp?key%3D36 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120114001431/http://archive.today.uci.edu/Features/profile_detail.asp?key=36# |archivedate=2012-01-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;    Aware that hundreds of new Scholars were still not enough to fill arts needs uniformly for so many schools, Fowler built relationships with those schools who signed on to a four-year plan stating that every pupil would progress from a year in studio art, to music, then dance, and finally drama.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, K. "How Much Art and How Often?" ''Learning through the Arts,'', 2002,http://escholarship.org/uc/item/7tn7c4vh?query=keith%20fowler&lt;/ref&gt;  The purpose of the plan was not only to guarantee arts on a consistent basis but to help research scholars by providing pupil subjects with stable exposure to the arts.  In 1998, with the encouragement of then California Secretary of Education, [[Marian Bergeson]], the state legislature granted funding to spread the ArtsBridge program to eight campuses of the University of California.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artsbridgeamerica.com/docs/AnnRpt01.pdf{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The various campuses modeled their programs initially on Fowler's documentation, including the master manual, begun in 1997 and updated through 2001, ''Bridging the Gap''.&lt;ref&gt;http://escholarship.org/uc/item/86m657p8. (Fifth edition, September 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Fowler resigned his post in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Succeeded on the original campus by Ana Halland, Claire Trevor director of Outreach&lt;/ref&gt;

== Success story ==
Throughout America, local school districts have responded to funding crises by drastic cutting of arts programs, ignoring clear evidence that regular exposure to the arts ''significantly'' enhances learning as shown in SAT scores  in mathematics, science,  and other "traditional" academics.&lt;ref&gt;"Art Students outperform non-arts peers on the SAT," shown in chart, at http://escholarship.org/uc/item/7tn7c4vh?query=How%20Much%20art#page-5&lt;/ref&gt;  ArtsBridge is an educational success story, its importance attested to by conference proceedings and internal studies &lt;ref&gt;http://www.artsbridgeamerica.com/publications.php{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as independent papers by experts like Maureen Burns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|isbn=978-0-493-77157-1|title=ArtsBridge: An exploration of collaborative outreach in the arts |author=Burns, Maureen Anne |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the few programs helping to maintain or restore the arts to American school children. It has gained support from such private sources as the [[Dana Foundation]] &lt;ref&gt;See The Dana Foundation Annual Reports, 1998–2008, Lists of Grant Recipients, http://www.dana.org/news/publications/publication.aspx?id=6408&lt;/ref&gt; and from local government programs, and has grown into a supra-national network, "ArtsBridge America," of thirty-one universities in sixteen states and Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artsbridgeamerica.com/home.php{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Beck remains active as its national director, with an immediate support staff of Liane Brouillete and Jasmine Yep.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artsbridgeamerica.com/whoswho.php{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arts integration''' is an approach to teaching that integrates the fine and performing arts as primary pathways to learning. Arts integration differs from traditional education by its inclusion of both the arts discipline and a traditional subject as part of learning (e.g. using improvisational drama skills to learn about conflict in writing.) The goal of arts integration is to increase knowledge of a general subject area while concurrently fostering a greater understanding and appreciation of the fine and performing arts.  The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts defines arts integration as "an approach to teaching in which students construct and demonstrate understanding through an art form. Students engage in a creative process which connects an art form and another subject and meets evolving objectives."

==History of arts education and arts integration==
Arts integration is related to [[Arts in education|arts education]] in schools. Arts education, while existing in different forms during the 19th century, gained popularity as part of [[John Dewey]]'s Progressive Education Theory. The first publication that describes a seamless interplay between the arts and other subjects (arts integration) taught in American schools was Leon Winslow's ''The Integrated School Art Program (1939).'' For the remainder of the 20th century, arts education's role in public schools ebbed and flowed with the country's political leanings and financial well-being.

According to Liora Bresler, during the 1970s and 1980s, two advocates for arts integration emerged: Harry Broudy and Elliot Eisner. Broudy advocated for the arts on the basis of strengthening the imagination. Broudy viewed imagination as an essential component of learning that should be cultivated in schools, and he advocated for the integration of aesthetic education into all subject matters in his work,'' Enlightened Cherishing''. Eisner followed Broudy, citing that the arts were important to varying types of [[cognition]]. He believed that arts brought about a deeper understanding of the world due to their interactivity—the arts move learning beyond what is written or read.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bresler | first1 = Liora | year = | title = The Subservient, Co-Equal, Affective, and Social Integration Styles and their Implications for.. | url = | journal = Arts Education Policy Review | volume = 96 | issue = 5| page = 31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cassandra B. Whyte]] emphasized the importance of artistic experiences for students to encourage creative and independent thought processes that would be important throughout an individual's lifetime. The arts helped students with problem solving and decision making and those processing experiences could be adapted in general life situations.&lt;ref&gt;Whyte, Bolyard Cassandra. (1973). Creativity: An Integral Part of the Secondary School Curriculum.Education.Nov.-Dec.190-191.&lt;/ref&gt; Whyte advocated including aspects of art education with [[locus of control]] identification counseling experiences to help higher education students develop confidence in their unique problem solving abilities in the classroom and in life.&lt;ref&gt;Whyte, Cassandra B. (1978). Effective Counseling Methods for High-Risk College Freshmen.Measurement and Evaluation in Guidance.6. (4). January, 198-200.&lt;/ref&gt;

Formerly, [[No Child Left Behind]] legislation describes arts education as "essential to every child's education," and include it as one of the Core Subjects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ed.gov/teachers/how/tools/initiative/updates/040826.html The Importance of Arts Education] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071002052454/http://www.ed.gov/teachers/how/tools/initiative/updates/040826.html |date=October 2, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; No Child Left Behind legislation also emphasizes accountability through assessment (often taking the form of the standardized test.) While no standardized assessment has been mandated in any of the arts, the need for academic accountability in the arts, as well as in other academic subject areas, has led to increased research on and advocacy of arts integration and its impact on student learning.&lt;ref&gt;Please see Renaissance in the Classroom's sub-chapter entitled "The Arts in American Public Education: A Brief History" for a more comprehensive reading with additional references&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, [[Common Core State Standards Initiative|Common Core]] and close adaptions of it are changing the way schools approach learning. Common Core's approach to art integration is that it enhances education by making learning interesting and fun. With Common Core becoming the norm for many school districts through the United States, teachers are integrating art into the classroom now more than ever. The rise of popularity in art integration has increased the amount of resources available to include the classroom, making it easier than ever to use art integration in the classroom. 

==Arts integration research and advocacy==
Arts advocacy discourse currently presents two main opposing views in support of arts in education. The first points to economic grounds that art teaches "21st-century skills" like collaboration and innovation, which are necessary only as a means to breed productivity for the growth of the market. The second, alternative approach focuses instead on the philosophical value of creative inquiry that art instills in students, arguing lifelong development with no end in mind as a necessary habit borne out of an arts education. Tension between the utilitarian, workplace-focused view and the educational, growth-centered framework on advocacy continues to shape and reshape the arts education universe as revisions to the&amp;nbsp;[http://www.nationalartsstandards.org/ National Core Arts Standards]&amp;nbsp;reflect fluctuations in advocacy rhetoric.&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Logsdon|first=Leann F.|date=2013|title=Questioning the Role of "21st-Century Skills" in Arts Education Advocacy Discourse|jstor=43288769|journal=Music Educators Journal|volume=100|issue=1|pages=51–56|doi=10.2307/43288769}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Key players ===
The impetus for the arts integration is a growing body of research that demonstrates how learners experience success when taught why and how to use music, visual art, drama/dance, theatre and the literary arts to both express and understand ideas, thoughts and feelings. Critical Links,&lt;ref&gt;Deasy, Richard, et al. Critical Links : Learning in the Arts and Student Academic and Social Development. Washington, DC: Arts Education Partnership, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; a compendium published by the Arts Education Partnership ([http://www.aep-arts.org/e.com AEP]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}), includes 62 studies which examine the relationship between arts learning, academic achievement, and social development of students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aep-arts.org/resources/toolkits/criticallinks Arts Education Partnership : : Publication Toolkits : : Critical Links] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070826130015/http://www.aep-arts.org/resources/toolkits/criticallinks |date=August 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Highlights include studies which explore the use of drama to increase students' reading comprehension and studies which examine the relationship between music and math concepts. The Arts Education Partnership has also published The Third Space,&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, L. M., R. Deasy, and A. E. Partnership. Third Space: When Learning Matters. Arts Education Partnership, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; which profiles ten arts-integrated schools across the [[United States]].

Another American organization conducting research in arts integration is the Chicago Arts Partnerships in Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capeweb.org/ |title=CAPE &amp;#124; Chicago Arts Partnerships in Education |publisher=Chicago Arts Partnerships in Education (CAPE) |date= |accessdate=2014-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has published, through Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Renaissance in the Classroom: Arts Integration and Meaningful Learning.&lt;ref&gt;Renaissance in the Classroom : Arts Integration and Meaningful Learning. Mahwah, N.J.: L. Erlbaum Associates, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The book, edited by Gail Burnaford, Ph.D, former professor at [[Northwestern University]] and current professor at Florida Atlantic University; Cynthia Weiss, teaching artist and former CAPE associate (2000 to 2002); and Arnold Aprill, CAPE's Founding &amp; Creative Director, combines the contributions of two-hundred seventy-two participants in CAPE's arts integration partnerships. James Catterall, arts education researcher and professor at [[University of California, Los Angeles]]'s Graduate School of Education and Information Studies, has collaborated with CAPE on publications.

[[Harvard University]]'s Graduate School of Education supports [https://web.archive.org/web/20070814120148/http://www.pzweb.harvard.edu/ Project Zero], an educational research group founded in 1967 by Nelson Goodman, which investigates learning in the arts. Former directors of Project Zero include David Perkins and [[Howard Gardner]]. Currently, it is directed by Steve Seidel, and has expanded its research in arts learning to include other branches of education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pzweb.harvard.edu/History/History.htm History of Project Zero] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611210538/http://pzweb.harvard.edu/History/History.htm |date=June 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Howard Gardner]]'s [[Theory of multiple intelligences]] has been used as part of the rationale for the use of integrated arts models in teaching and learning.

For over 30 years, [http://www.kennedy-center.org the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts] in Washington, D.C., has been offering arts integration learning opportunities for educators.  Locally, through its [http://www.kennedy-center.org/education/ceta/ Changing Education Through the Arts (CETA)] program, the Kennedy Center provides professional learning for Washington, D.C. area educators that are implementing arts integration in their classrooms or teaching about an art form.  To develop a school-wide culture of arts integration, a network of CETA schools partner with the Kennedy Center to engage their teachers in in-depth professional learning focused on arts integration.  The CETA program has added to the research about the impact of arts integration on students, teachers, and school culture through multiple evaluation studies.  To reach educators throughout the nation, the Kennedy Center hosts an annual Arts Integration Conference, in which educators actively explore arts integration concepts and strategies.  The Kennedy Center’s online resource, [http://artsedge.kennedy-center.org/educators.aspx ARTSEDGE], also hosts a web series of arts integration resources that explain the ‘what’ and ‘why’ of arts integration, provides examples of arts integration in practice, and links to a range of resources.  A series of Kennedy Center Seminars for Teaching Artists that focus on arts integration, as well as practices for developing strong arts-integrated residencies for students and workshops for teachers are available throughout the nation. A National Seminar for Teaching Artists is offered bi-annually at the Kennedy Center during the summer. 
Three other Kennedy Center national initiatives support practices and partnerships in arts integration and arts education: [http://www.kennedy-center.org/education/anygivenchild/ Any Given Child], [http://www.kennedy-center.org/education/partners/ Partners in Education], and [http://www.kennedy-center.org/education/vsa/ VSA].

[[The Kennedy Center]] Partners in Education, headquartered in [[Washington, DC]], is an organization that has promoted arts integration for over two decades. While The Kennedy Center does conduct research in arts learning, they also provide networking opportunities for arts education programs nationwide through The Kennedy Center Alliance for Arts Education Network [https://web.archive.org/web/20071013044855/http://kennedy-center.org/education/kcaaen/home.html KCAAEN]. This organization advocates for arts education, fosters collaboration between artists and schools to support arts learning, develops and conducts professional development in arts education for teachers, and recognizes achievement in the arts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kennedy-center.org/education/kcaaen/home.html KCAAEN] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013044855/http://kennedy-center.org/education/kcaaen/home.html |date=2007-10-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1980s, [[Lesley University]] in Cambridge,  MA, has been educating classroom teachers across the US in the implementation of arts integration through a [http://www.lesley.edu/academics/graduate/curriculum-instruction-integrated-teaching-through-the-arts-professional-teacher professional development master's degree program]. A [http://www.artsedsearch.org/summaries/voices-from-the-field-teachers%E2%80%99-views-on-the-relevance-of-arts-integration 2012 research study], funded by the Ford Foundation, has found that teachers who graduate from the program and integrate the arts into their teaching are more resilient and remain committed to their profession. Their students engage in deep learning through arts integrated activities, leading to a greater interest in school.&lt;ref&gt;Bellisario, K. &amp; Donovan, L. (2012). Voices from the field: Teachers’ views on the relevance of arts integration.

ArtsNow [http://www.artsnowlearning.org] provides professional development training for educators, focused on building the skills needed to integrate arts across the curriculum. Through the innovative Foundational Training course, teachers learn to identify opportunities to integrate all art forms - visual, dance, and music - into lessons in all class subjects for grades K-12, meeting both state and national curriculum standards (including Common Core standards). ArtsNow offers free Ignite Curriculum Guides through its website.&lt;ref&gt;ArtsNow Learning, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

EducationCloset [http://educationcloset.com] provides professional development in arts integration and innovation in teaching.  With an annual Arts Integration conference, [https://educationcloset.com/integrated-curriculum/ Arts Integrated Curriculum], courses, webinars and publications available, teachers, artists, arts educators, administrators, and arts advocates can find rigorous, high-quality resources for Arts Integration which connect to Common Core State Standards and STEM.

With a focus on the classroom practice of arts integration, a nonprofit called Arts Integration Solutions (formerly the Opening Minds through the Arts Foundation) [http://www.artsintegration.com] provides professional development for teachers and program planning and implementation for schools and school districts. AiS has developed a set of tenets that are the basis for arts integration and a cycle that helps teachers develop daily lessons in math, science, reading and writing that use the arts to fully engage students. AiS has developed programming for use of arts integration in teaching the STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and math) and Literacy.

==Art education obstacles==
The three major skills in education that are considered the “core” subjects to teach students include math, writing, and reading comprehension. These important areas are considered by many the tools for success for student achievement. A consequence of predominately emphasizing these three areas of academic study is a lack of attention to other major areas of academics, mainly the arts. Viewing the arts as insignificant has had a major impact on teaching creativity to students.

===No Child Left Behind===
The importance of teaching the arts to students has recently been viewed as less essential than teaching other core studies, particularly by school administrators. Educational institutions are attempting to maintain federal standards to receive government funding. These standards focus predominantly on subjects such as English and math and are also highly emphasized during standardized testing. If schools can improve student achievement within these areas, they do not become vulnerable to a loss or reduction in federal funding. Robin Pogrebin of the New York Times states, “In a time when President Bush’s “No Child Left Behind” policy emphasizes test results, the arts do not easily lend themselves to quantifiable measurements”.&lt;ref&gt;Pogrebin, Robin. [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/04/arts/design/04stud.html“Book Tackles Old Debate: Role of Art in Schools]. [[The New York Times]]. (2007). 7 Nov. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, schools are placing a large emphasis on teaching students to excel in these areas of study. This includes more time allotted for the instruction of these classes as well as a large amount of the school budget to enhance these courses.

===School budgets===
While a sizable amount of the educational budget is spent on these important areas of academic study, schools are finding that there is less money for what some would consider as non-essential courses, such as higher level music and art. According to the academic journal The Electronic Musician, “On March 2, 2011, both the House and Senate agreed to eliminate a number of small education programs at the U.S. Department of Education, including the complete defunding of the Arts in Education program, a $40 million fund that supports competitive grants and national initiatives”.&lt;ref&gt;"The FY11 Budget Deal: What Does It Mean For The Arts?." Electronic Musician 27.7 (2011): 13. Academic Search Premier. Web. 16 Nov. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; While small reductions to budgets are common during a recession, some states have reduced their arts budgets drastically. According to the Teaching Artists Journal, “In 2004, total state funding for the arts will drop to $272 million, a 23% decrease in just the last year. And nearly two-thirds of that total decrease comes from cutbacks in just three of the hardest hit states: California, Michigan and Florida”.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, Heather. "The Simple Facts." Teaching Artist Journal 2.3 (2004): 189. Academic Search Premier. Web. 7 Nov. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; While the reduction of funding for the arts has been reduced nearly a quarter in different areas, educators often struggle to maintain their arts program as a vital skill to teach to students. The funds that have been reduced now disallow the arts to provide furnishings and supplies as well as instructor salaries that are essential to these programs. As a result, art courses are not regarded with the same amount of respect and students are denied a creative outlet within their education.

Budget issues and the reduction of spending for the arts has caused numerous schools to attempt to find additional sources to help support their arts program. School administrators frequently look towards state funding to assist in financing the arts. Grants and other means to finance the arts are increasingly becoming more frequent, but they are temporary solutions to fund these programs. Schools often work with local and state governments to receive income; however numerous state governments are experiencing other budget deficit issues and can rarely afford to finance such a program in the amount that is needed. So to help support the arts, often there is need for assistance from private contributors. Still, as with grants, private contributors cannot donate enough funds to adequately support the arts in education and cannot contribute as consistently as the government could. Funding the arts in education still remains a large and unresolved issue for many school districts nationwide.

===Practical uses===
Advocacy for the arts raises an issue of how essential teaching the arts to students actually is. Due to statistical analysis of a perceived lapse in mathematical and reading skills of our youth, many parents feel that importance of the arts is less crucial than other fundamental areas of academic study. This is namely due, in part, by the fact that art is viewed as less needed in the workforce. However many advocates argue that students in the arts excel in interpreting and analyzing visual and spatial information. According to the National Assessment of Educational Progress, "Educators have acknowledged that the arts are basic to the acquisition of a well-rounded education. The arts provide meaning to learning. They serve as a vehicle for acquiring the skills to which educational reformers have said students should aspire: problem-solving, higher order thinking, flexibility, persistence, and cooperation."&lt;ref&gt;“What Does the NEAP Arts Assessment Measure?” National Center for Educational Statistics. 2009. 16 Nov, 2011. &lt;http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/arts/whatmeasure.asp&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; These skills that are acquired by the arts are actually needed characteristics in the modern workforce. The stress of the importance for the arts then becomes one that benefits the students for their future careers. While many view the arts as inapplicable in today’s modern workforce, many would argue that the arts provide positive results for students competing in today’s competitive job market.

===Arts integrated teachers===
An issue commonly brought is that “not all teachers are artists,” meaning that there aren’t enough teachers capable of doing art to teach in every classroom. However, this is not the case, as any teacher can become an arts teacher. While art is, to its core, incredibly subjective, there is a basis for every practice. In the fine arts there are the elements and principles of design, the color wheel, etc. In music there is basic music theory. In drama, there is basic play structure, acting theory, etc. Whether or not a teacher can do these things is irrelevant; if they can be taught, that information can be passed on from the teacher to the student. The goal is not to create master artists, but rather teach basic arts skills, processes, and aesthetic quality, and encourage creative teaching techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Oreck |first=Barry |title=Artistic choices: A study of teachers who use the arts in the classroom |url=http://ijea.asu.edu/v7n8/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205121705/http://ijea.asu.edu/v7n8/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=5 February 2007 |publisher=International Journal of Education &amp; the Arts |accessdate=12 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This basic understanding can then be passed on to the students, who then learn by doing. These skills are simple and easy to learn and teach, and will be infinitely useful in creating lesson plans and in practice. Once an arts-integrated environment is established, techniques, examples, and information can be shared amongst colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dittrich |last2=Pool |last3=Pool |first=Charles |first2=Jonelle |first3=Ken|title=Arts Integration in Teacher Preparation: Teaching the Teachers|url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ985616.pdf|publisher=ERIC Institute of Education Sciences|accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They can discuss findings and share what works and does not work within the classroom.

Funding and advocacy for the arts still remains the largest issue that is currently facing teaching this important area to students. Many districts and supporters speak out for more funding to ensure advancement in the arts, however there is little money to be shared across the many programs in education. Many fear that certain arts programs may be removed from some schools due to these concerns. While art education is considered one of the core subjects in the No Child Left Behind Act, there are many who fear for its future.

==The contribution of arts education to children’s development==
The arts are often perceived as a hobby, an interest or purely as a recreational occupation. In a society where the entire educational system is based on preparing a future work force, focus is put on the STEM field (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) and the arts are neglected. In a time of economic instability resources are strictly distributed and the arts are ever so often first to get cut. Yet, research on the effects of arts education on children’s learning and development show significant positive outcomes on children exposed to arts programs with teacher supervision compared to children not exposed to arts education. Research shows that children exposed to arts do better in school, develop greater social, cognitive and emotional skills and are more likely to earn higher degrees of education later in life.

===Academic effects===
Participation in arts programs is positively correlated with increased academic achievement, including higher math and verbal SAT scores, when compared to the performance of students without arts education.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;President’s Committee on the Arts and Humanities. (2011). Reinvesting in arts education: Winning America’s future through creative schools. http://www.pcah.gov/sites/default/files/PCAH_Reinvesting_4web.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;

Research by the National Educational Longitudinal Survey (NELS;88), a panel study which has followed more than 25,000 students in American secondary schools for 10 years, show significant results on the positive outcomes from children exposed to high arts in school with a teacher supervising. The study examines the time from 8th grade through 10th and 12th grade and throughout high school. Furthermore, this study, conducted by James Catterall and colleagues, which started in the mid-90s followed up on the same students at age 26 in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Catterall, J. S. (2009). Doing Well and Doing Good by Doing Art: The Effects of Education in the Visual and Performing Arts on the Achievements and Values of Young Adults. Los Angeles/London: Imagination Group/I‐Group Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

An exploratory study published by the [[National Art Education Association]] looked at the integration of arts in classroom curriculum and concluded that this integration enhanced academic learning because of the fully immersive engagement of the arts, which allows students to understand different perspectives, safely take risks, express feelings through less restrictive modes, and draw parallels between the arts and traditional core subject areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lynch|first=Patricia|date=2007|title=Making Meaning Many Ways: An Exploratory Look at Integrating the Arts with Classroom Curriculum|jstor=27696226|journal=Art Education|volume=60|issue=4|pages=33–38|doi=10.2307/27696226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Socio-emotional development===
A significant consensus among research on arts education exists and this is that arts reach students who are not otherwise being reached and that the arts reach students in ways that they are otherwise not being reached.&lt;ref&gt;Fiske, E. B. (1999). Champions of Change - The Impact of the Arts on Learning. Washington, D.C.: The Arts Education Partnership &amp; The President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities.&lt;/ref&gt; Students failing is commonly explained by disengaged students and finding that arts provide students a reason and a motivation for being engaged with school and thus preventing students from dropping out of school.&lt;ref&gt;Achbacher, P. &amp;. (1991). The Humanitas Program evaluation, 1990-91. Center for the Study of Evaluation, UCLA Graduate School of Los Angeles, California.&lt;/ref&gt; This motivation found within can be examined through the way that engagement in arts enhances self-awareness, self-confidence, trust and empowerment. Creating art is a personal experience and involves the student’s personal resources implicating a greater involvement and investment in a work without right or wrong answers.  Personal investment nourishes self-directed learning and encourages the learning experience itself rather than learning as a means of test score performance. The confidence, collaboration, and creativity that arts education fosters has a circular, positive effect on academics as well as cultural engagement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Socio-cultural development===
Positive outcomes by means of socio-cultural development, through exposure to minorities and different cultures, is a contribution of arts education aiming at breaking stereotypes and developing teamwork skills, tolerance and appreciation of diversity. One study, collected by the Association for the Advancement of Arts Education (AAAE), on students’ exposure to Native American music using an interdisciplinary approach incorporating the teaching of instrumental music and bringing in guest artists, showed decreased stereotypical attitudes and greater cultural awareness and sensitivity. These changes were measured by the American Indian Belief Inventory was measured on four groups exposed to Native American culture and a fifth group with no cultural exposure. All of the four groups showed improvement while the fifth control group did not.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, K. (1994). North American Indian Music Instruction : Influences upon attitudes, cultural perceptions, and achievement.D.M.A. dissertation. Tempa, Arizona.: Arizona State University.&lt;/ref&gt;

Longitudinal studies have shown that students with arts education are more civically engaged. This socio-cultural effect of arts integration is disproportionately stronger for at-risk students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=S.|first=Catterall, James|date=March 2012|title=The Arts and Achievement in At-Risk Youth: Findings from Four Longitudinal Studies. Research Report #55.|url=http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED530822|journal=National Endowment for the Arts|language=en|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cognitive development===
Research on the contribution of the arts to the cognitive field show a great array of cognitive developments in spatial-temporal abilities, verbal skills, memory and spatial reasoning.
A study by Chan ''et al.'' using sixty female college students in the U.S showed a relationship of the students’ music training before age 12 and their verbal memory. The students with music training showed a significantly better recall than those without formal training. 
A meta-analysis by the American Psychological Association furthermore showed how listening to music can result in progressive relaxation and that listening to classical music one hour a day increases greater brain coherence and more time spent in the alpha state (state of aware relaxation stimulating imagination, intuition and higher awareness).&lt;ref&gt;Malyarenko. (1996). Music Alters Children's Brainwaves, Human Physiology, 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies on premature babies have also found that while receiving special care and being exposed to classical music they physically and mentally developed significantly faster than those babies who weren’t exposed to classical music.  Further studies have also indicated that incorporating Art into academic education for disabled children better supported cognitive development and improved communication skills.&lt;ref&gt;Silver, Rawley A. ''Developing Cognitive and Creative Skills through Art: Programs for children with Communication Disorders or Learning Disabilities''. New York. Ablin Press, 1989. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Integration of arts in classroom curriculum ==
Jessica Davis presents eight different frameworks for considering the role of the arts in education.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davis|first=Jessica Hoffman|date=1999-05-01|title=Nowhere, Somewhere, Everywhere: The Arts in Education|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/10632919909599472|journal=Arts Education Policy Review|volume=100|issue=5|pages=23–28|doi=10.1080/10632919909599472|issn=1063-2913}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gullatt|first=David E.|date=2008|title=Enhancing Student Learning through Arts Integration: Implications for the Profession|jstor=40364094|journal=The High School Journal|volume=91|issue=4|pages=12–25|doi=10.1353/hsj.0.0001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her categories and methods are as follows:
# ''Arts-Based -'' Art is at the core of learning, providing a lens through which students can understand other subjects. Art serves as the basic threshold for general learning.
# ''Arts-Injected (or Infused) -'' Art is "injected" from the outside as a matter of enrichment (e.g., a period of music, visiting artists, etc.)
# ''Arts-Included'' - Art is offered alongside traditional curriculum, not necessarily for interdisciplinary purposes but rather as its own course of study.
# ''Arts-Expansion'' - Art is an exploratory adventure that takes students outside of school (e.g., field trips to a museum, concert hall, etc.)
# ''Arts-Professional'' - This approach treats art training as a means for a professional career in the arts, and turning students into artists is the primary goal.
# ''Arts-Extras'' - Art is sometimes offered as an additional commitment outside of regular school curriculum (e.g., school newspaper, after-school dance clubs, etc.).
# ''Arts-Education -'' Referred to by some as aesthetic education, this approach uses art as a way of knowing, turning its study more philosophical to interpret and apply to experiences.
# ''Arts-Cultura'' - Art connects individual students' "culture" to collective community "cultures" to more structured racial/national "Cultures" to the ultimate universal "Culture." It is through this interplay that art encourages students to take risks, think critically, and make meaning.
It is often difficult to fully integrate the arts with traditional classroom instruction in a way that allows for the arts-cultura model. This is largely due to the disconnect between art teachers and teachers of other subjects, who are not given the time or ability to coordinate and interweave lesson plans that apply art to core subjects and vice versa.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Arts Technology Integration ===
As technology continually advances, arts integration evolves to match. The challenge in integrating arts in today's technology-first education lies not in implementing production labs on school campuses or accessing the latest computer software, but rather in effectively managing the sheer amount of information that technology makes available. Students must learn to select relevant data, assess these data, and draw critically from them in order to make meaning, answer questions, or form new ones. Technology also presents more channels of expression, whether through digital art or artificial intelligence, which, if supported by arts-technology integration, can cultivate the experimentation and inquiry that arts education champions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mayo|first=Sherry|date=2007|title=Implications for Art Education in the Third Millennium: Art Technology Integration|jstor=27696216|journal=Art Education|volume=60|issue=3|pages=45–51|doi=10.2307/27696216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== UNESCO Arts Integration Program ===
The United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), a special agency of the UN that operates from Paris, France, advocates the need for the integration of arts, culture, and creativity in all educational platforms worldwide. This agenda is in line with the structure of “Quality Education” and “Education for All” to support methodologies for promoting and protecting diversity of cultural manifestation. For example, UNESCO Bangkok took the initiative of upholding research activities related to Arts Education and swap of information along with case studies among educators, artists, and other stakeholders within Asia and the Pacific. The very first international congress on arts education was held in Seoul (Korea) in 2006 and the second in 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://bangkok.unesco.org/content/releasing-power-arts-%E2%80%93-exploring-arts-education-asia-pacific|title=Releasing the Power of the Arts – Exploring Arts Education in the Asia-Pacific|work=UNESCO Bangkok|access-date=2018-05-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Conclusion==
Due to current economic recession many schools across see their arts programs cut off in favor of core curriculum subject such as English, math and science. Despite the lack of apparent and secure job possibilities within the arts and a pressuring need for a strong work force within the [[STEM fields]] (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) research show that arts education is crucial in children’s learning process and development. In 2013 a congressional resolution sought to include "A" for Art in the STEM acronym, changing it to STEAM.&lt;ref name="113HR51"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-113hres51ih/pdf/BILLS-113hres51ih.pdf |title=H. RES. 51 House of Representatives Joint Resolution|year=2012 |author= |publisher=113th Congress, 2013–2015|accessdate=2013-03-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies show that children exposed to arts education throughout childhood through primary, secondary and tertiary school show greater scores on academic achievements as well as greater social, cultural, emotional and cognitive development. Some of the measured improvement are greater self-confidence, communicative skills, cultural awareness and sensitivity alongside greater stimulated creativity and overall academic achievement.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4359">'''Bachelor of Vocational Education''' (''B.V.E.'', '''BVE''', or '''BVEd''') is a specialized [[Undergraduate education|undergraduate]] [[bachelor's degree]] which qualifies the graduate as a [[vocational education|vocational teacher]] in public schools or trainer for private companies. Some universities offer a Bachelor of Vocational Education and Training, or a Bachelor of Career and Technical Education degree, which are basically equivalent to a BVE. Further, many universities have specific vocational education bachelor's degrees to prepare agricultural, business, computer, health occupations, marketing, and industrial arts teachers as well as degrees for Adult and Continuing Education.

== History ==
Vocational educators have existed since the first vocations existed. One of the main systems of vocational education was through masters and apprentices. As traditional academic institutions started to recognize the need for vocational education, there became a need to accredit potential vocational teachers within the traditional academic system. This can be seen in California through their requirement that all community college tenured vocational instructors have a bachelor's degree&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

| accessdate = 2007-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Requirements ==

=== California ===
While each college's specific curriculum and courses may vary, nearly every college in California that offers a Bachelor of Vocational Education degree includes courses in Characteristics and Management of Education for Adult Students, Assessment and Instruction, Teaching Diverse Learners, Advanced Instructional Design, Program Evaluation and Leadership, and School Health Care as these are generally required for a Designated Subjects Vocational Education Teaching Credential.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Further, BVE students may generally complete a SWAN Portfolio that allows them to get college credit for experience they have had from their specific vocations.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

== Value and effectiveness ==

A study done by the Department of Education of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada found that 94% of BVE graduates were working in a field related to their degree compared with 80% for all graduates with an undergraduate degree. Further, BVE graduates earned on average $18.01-$20.00 per hour compared to $14.01-$16.00 for the general graduating population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

'''Betty Dodson''' (born August 24, 1929) is an American [[sex education|sex educator]]. An artist by training, she exhibited erotic art in New York, before pioneering the [[Sex-positive feminism|pro-sex feminist]] movement, separate from mainstream [[feminism]], which she sees as needlessly political and hostile towards males. Dodson’s workshops and manuals encourage women to masturbate, often in groups. Although bisexual herself, she repudiates the labels that define sexuality.

Originally from Kansas, Dodson went to New York City to train as an artist in 1950, and has lived on [[Manhattan]]'s [[Madison Avenue]] since 1962.&lt;ref name="GuardMay14"&gt;{{cite news| last = Theobold | first = Stephanie | url = https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/may/05/masturbation-secret-to-a-long-life-betty-dodson-self-love|title=Masturbation: the secret to a long life? | work = [[The Guardian]] | date = May 5, 2014 | accessdate = March 7, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, Dodson married Frederick Stern, an advertising director, with the marriage ending in divorce in 1965.&lt;ref name="GuardMay14"/&gt; Dodson's quest for "sexual self-discovery" began after her divorce.&lt;ref name="GuardMay14"/&gt; Dodson held the first one-woman show of erotic art at the Wickersham Gallery in New York City in 1968. She left the art world to teach sex to women. She is widely known as a pioneer in women's liberation, and to a somewhat lesser extent in men's [[sexual liberation]], having sold more than one million copies of her first book, ''[[Sex for One]]''. Much of her fame has come from her work not only advocating [[masturbation]], but conducting workshops for more than 30 years in which groups of about 10 or more women (and at least once a group of men) would talk, explore their own bodies, and masturbate together. Her website, "Betty Dodson's Genital Gallery," showed many films of masturbation and intercourse, with close-up views of genitals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dodsonandross.com/what-happened-bettys-genital-art-gallery On the reasons why Betty Dodson's Genital Gallery disappeared (Retrieved November 9, 2017)]&lt;/ref&gt;

She left behind the traditional feminist movement, because she considered it banal, [[antisexual]] and over-politicized. Dodson considers too much is made of sexual labels and embraces them all by calling herself a heterosexual, bisexual lesbian. She looks forward to the day we can all be just "sexual."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Dodson | first = Betty | title = We Are All Quite Queer (blog) | url = http://dodsonandross.com/sexfeature/we-are-all-quite-queer | website = Bettydodson.com | publisher = Betty Dodson with Carlin Ross | date = June 26, 2005 | access-date = November 17, 2006 }} {{Self published inline|date = February 2017|certain = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years she has criticized [[Eve Ensler]]'s ''[[The Vagina Monologues]]'', which she believes has a negative and restrictive view of sexuality and an anti-male bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Dodson | first = Betty | title = Betty's Response to the ''Vagina Monologues'' (blog) | url = http://dodsonandross.com/sexfeature/bettys-response-vagina-monologues | website = Bettydodson.com | publisher = Betty Dodson with Carlin Ross | date = March 15, 2001 | accessdate = September 9, 2013 }} {{Self published inline|date = February 2017|certain = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dodson earned a degree from the [[Institute for the Advanced Study of Human Sexuality]] for her research work on sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Betty Dodson author biography | url = http://www.randomhouse.com/author/7172/betty-dodson | website = randomhouse.com | publisher = [[Random House]] | accessdate = April 8, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Women's masturbation education ==
Dodson became active in the [[sex-positive movement]] in the late 1960s.&lt;ref name="barbarajlove2006"&gt;{{citation | last = Love | first = Barbara J. | author-link = Barbara Love | contribution = Dodson, Betty Ann | editor-last = Love | editor-first = Barbara J. | editor-link = Barbara Love | title = Feminists who changed America, 1963–1975 |pages=120–121 | publisher = University of Illinois Press | location = Urbana, Illinois | year = 2006 | isbn = 9780252031892 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dodson used the [[Hitachi Magic Wand]], a powerful main-powered [[vibrator (sex toy)|vibrator]], in demonstrations and instructional classes to instruct women regarding self-pleasure techniques.&lt;ref name="christophertrout"&gt;{{cite news|last=Trout|first=Christopher|title=The 46-year-old sex toy Hitachi won't talk about|url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/08/27/history-of-the-hitachi-magic-wand/|accessdate= August 30, 2014|work=[[Engadget]]|date= August 27, 2014 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140827183517/http://www.engadget.com/2014/08/27/history-of-the-hitachi-magic-wand/|archivedate=27 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="westheimer"&gt;{{citation | last = Westheimer | first = Ruth K. | authorlink = Ruth K.

She recommended women put a small towel over their sex organs in order to dull the sensation of the vibrator and prolong the pleasurable experience.&lt;ref name="kmkemp2003"&gt;{{cite journal|first=K.M.|last=Kemp|journal=[[Marie Claire]]|date=June 2003|page=233|title=25 ways to have your best orgasm ever!|volume=10|issue=6|via=[[InfoTrac]]|publisher=Hearst Communications | url = http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/9810770/25-ways-have-your-best-orgasm-ever | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her technique became known as the Betty Dodson Method.&lt;ref name="piastruck"&gt;{{Cite journal | first1 = Pia | last1 = Struck | last2 = Ventegodt | first2 = Søren | title = Clinical holistic medicine: teaching orgasm for females with chronic anorgasmia using the Betty Dodson Method | journal = [[The Scientific World Journal]] | volume = 8 | issue =  | pages = 883–895 | publisher = [[Hindawi Publishing Corporation]] | doi = 10.1100/tsw.2008.116 | date = 2008 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1100/tsw.2008.116 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her sessions were known as Bodysex workshops and featured 15 naked women in supine position, each using a Magic Wand simultaneously to aid in masturbation.&lt;ref name="winks1997"&gt;{{citation | last1 = Winks | first1 = Cathy | last2 = Semans | first2 = Anne | contribution = ''Profiles in pleasure: Betty Dodson'' &amp;#124; Vibrators and partners | editor-last1 = Winks | editor-first1 = Cathy | editor-last2 = Semans | editor-first2 = Anne | title = [[The Good Vibrations Guide to Sex|The new good vibrations guide to sex]] | pages = 102 &amp; 154 | publisher = Cleis Press | location = Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania | year = 1997 | isbn = 9781573440691 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; She provided a Magic Wand to each woman for these two-hour masturbation sessions.&lt;ref name="dodson1996"&gt;{{citation | last = Dodson | first = Betty | contribution = Making love alone | editor-last = Dodson | editor-first = Betty | title = Sex for one: the joy of selfloving | page = 154 | publisher = Crown Trade Paperbacks | location = New York | year = 1996 | isbn = 9780517886076 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dodson taught thousands of women to achieve orgasm using this technique.&lt;ref name="winks1997" /&gt;

== Later career ==
Dodson published a memoir, ''Sex by Design'', in 2010.&lt;ref name="GuardMay14"/&gt;

In 2014, she expressed that she considers herself a [[fourth-wave feminist]], stating that the previous waves of feminist were banal and anti-sexual, which is why she has chosen to look at a new stance of feminism, fourth wave feminism. In 2014, Dodson worked with women to discover their sexual desires through masturbation. Dodson says her work has gained a fresh lease of life with a new audience of young, successful women who have never had an orgasm. This includes fourth-wave feminists – those rejecting the anti-pleasure stance they believe [[third-wave feminism|third-wave feminists]] stand for.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Smith | first = Lydia | title = Betty Dodson and fourth-wave feminism: masturbation is key to longer life | url = http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/betty-dodson-fourth-wave-feminism-masturbation-key-longer-life-1447536 | work = [[International Business Times]] | date = May 7, 2014 |access-date = May 12, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dodson maintains a private practice in New York City and has an active website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Dodson | first = Betty | title = Home page | url = http://dodsonandross.com | website = dodsonandross.com | publisher = Betty Dodson with Carlin Ross | access-date = December 12, 2013 }} {{Self published inline|date = February 2017|certain = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article on her website about hands-on sex therapy, she explains her choice against pursuing a degree in [[psychology]] and licensing as a therapist since it would have prevented her from continuing with the types of sex workshops and counseling for women that she had been doing for decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Dodson | first = Betty | title = Ask Dr. Betty – Sex Coaching | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070407222128/http://www.bettydodson.com/sexcoachinginfo.htm | archive-date = April 7, 2007 | url = http://www.bettydodson.com/sexcoachinginfo.htm | website = bettydodson.com | publisher = Betty Dodson with Carlin Ross | access-date = December 12, 2013 }} {{Self published inline|date = February 2017|certain = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is available for group and solo Bodysex workshops and private individual and couples coaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Dodson | first = Betty | title = Bodysex for one and for groups | url = http://dodsonandross.com/private-session-dr-betty-dodson | website = dodsonandross.com | publisher = Betty Dodson with Carlin Ross }} {{Self published inline|date = February 2017|certain = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publication and other works==
Dodson's books include ''Liberating Masturbation'', ''Sex for One: The Joy of Self-Loving'' and ''Orgasms for Two: the Joy of Partnersex''. She also produced four videos: ''Selfloving: Portrait of a Sexual Seminar'', ''Celebrating Orgasm: Women's Private Selfloving Sessions'', ''Viva la Vulva: Women's Sex Organs Revealed'' and ''The Orgasm Doctor: Two Private Hands-on Sex Coaching Sessions''.

In 2006, [[:es:Carlin Ross|Carlin Ross]], a former [[corporate lawyer]], met Betty Dodson for an interview and became her business partner.&lt;ref name="GuardMay14"/&gt; They created an online sexuality portal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Dodson | first = Betty | title = Home page | url = http://dodsonandross.com | website = dodsonandross.com | publisher = Betty Dodson with Carlin Ross | access-date = December 4, 2013 }} {{Self published inline|date = February 2017|certain = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; for women under the brand Dodson and Ross. Together, they launched an online video series ''[[Basic Sex Skills: The New Porn]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Dodson | first1 = Betty | last2 = Ross | first2 = Carlin | title = About us | url = https://dodsonandross.com/about-u | website = dodsonandross.com | publisher = Betty Dodson with Carlin Ross }} {{Self published inline|date = February 2017|certain = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media appearances ==
Dodson appeared in a Season 4 episode of [[Penn &amp; Teller]]'s ''[[Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!|Bullshit!]]'' that dealt with [[Sexual abstinence|abstinence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode | title = Abstinence | episode-link = List of Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit! episodes#Season 4 (2006) | url = http://www.sho.com/penn-and-teller-bullshit/season/4/episode/6 | series = Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit! | series-link = Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit! | first1 = Penn (co-host) | last1 = Jillette | last2 = Teller (co-host) | first3 = Betty (guest) | last3 = Dodson | author-link1 = Penn Jillette | author-link2 = Teller (magician) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | station = [[CBS Corporation|CBS]] | date = June 5, 2006 | season = 4 |number= 10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also on ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]'', and has appeared in numerous sex documentaries.

__NOTOC__

==Cases==
The first recorded case was in 1900. Allegations of cruelty toward children residing at the [[Stoke Industrial School]] (also known as St Mary's Orphanage) instigated a Royal Commission and the eventual prosecution of two Marist Brothers. Edouard Forrier (Brother Wybertus) was charged with five counts of common assault. They were also charged with five counts of indecent assault of which they were acquitted. The alleged incidents occurred between September 5, 1893 and June 1, 1897.&lt;ref&gt;[http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=NZH19000921.2.57&amp;e=-------10--1----0Colonist-- The Stoke School Scandal], ''New Zealand Herald'', Vol. XXXVII, Issue 11483, 21 Sept. 1900, 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marist Father Alan Woodcock abused children at [[St John's College, Hastings|St John's College]] in [[Hastings]], [[St. Patrick's College, Silverstream|St Patrick's College]] in [[Upper Hutt]], [[Highden]] in the [[Manawatu]] and [[Futuna (retreat)|Futuna]] in [[Wellington]]. After he left the [[Marist Priesthood]] and left New Zealand to live in England, he was extradited back to New Zealand and convicted of 21 sex offences committed between 1978 and 1987. The abuse continued despite the knowledge of Father Michael Curtain and Father Fred Bliss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=3574937 |title=Police may go after the clergymen who hid abuse |work=nzherald.co.nz |year=2012 |accessdate=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tracking him down abroad was done with the assistance of the [[Sisters of St Joseph of Nazareth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=3567930 |title=Sex abuser's sisters bring him home to face justice  |work=nzherald.co.nz |year=2012 |quote=Sisters of St Joseph of Nazareth |accessdate=22 April 2012 |first=Eugene |last=Bingham}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Louis Stevenson (known as Brother Bernard) and Brother Andrew Cody of the [[Hato Paora College|Hato Paora Māori Boys school]] in [[Feilding]] were convicted of sexual offenses and jailed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10361156 |title=Jailed churchman was sexually abused as child |work=nzherald.co.nz |year=2012 |accessdate=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/feilding/news/article.cfm?l_id=200&amp;objectid=10342691 | work=The New Zealand Herald | title=Catholic brother sent to jail for abusing boys | date=August 27, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 a staff member of [[St Bede's College, Christchurch]] admitted to being a sex offender before he was employed at that college, but was allowed to remain as a teacher.&lt;ref&gt;'[https://www.odt.co.nz/news/dunedin/teacher-stayed-working-even-after-admitting-abuse Teacher stayed working even after admitting abuse]' on ''[[Otago Daily Times]]'' website, 7 September 2018, viewed 19 September 2018&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, abuse victim advocates called for the resignation of the school's rector for continuing the staff member's employment.&lt;ref&gt;'[https://www.odt.co.nz/news/dunedin/school-stays-silent-amid-calls-resignation School stays silent amid calls for resignation]' on ''[[Otago Daily Times]]'' website, 19 September 2018, viewed 19 September 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 and 2018, the issue was raised of [[Magnus Murray (Catholic priest)|Magnus Murray]], a Catholic priest, who taught at [[Kavanagh College#Christian Brothers School (St Paul's High School) (1876–1989)|St Paul's College, Dunedin]], until 1972 and was later convicted of child sexual abuse.&lt;ref name="remains"&gt;[https://www.odt.co.nz/news/dunedin/paedophile-remains-priest 'Paedophile remains a priest'] on''[[Otago Daily Times]]'' website dated 2017-08-11, viewed 10 September 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Allegations were also made against former Christian Brothers Junior School principal, Desmond Fay.&lt;ref name="scale"&gt;[https://www.odt.co.nz/news/dunedin/scale-abuse-suffering-revealed 'Scale of abuse revealed'] on ''[[Otago Daily Times]]'' website, dated 2018-09-07, viewed 2018-09-10&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Dooley]], Bishop of Dunedin, acknowledged the offences of Murray and Fay and apologised for the "suffering endured by victims and their families".&lt;ref name="dooleyletter"&gt;Letter dated 22 August 2018 by Bishop Michael Dooley, published on [http://cdd.org.nz Catholic Diocese of Dunedin] website; [https://web.archive.org/web/20180910033852/https://static1.squarespace.com/static/51dbe649e4b09506a9c7266f/t/5b7e376c0e2e7270a52cd453/1534998400119/Bishop+Michael%27s+letter.jpg?format=750w archived] on [[Internet Archive]] on 2018-09-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marylands School==
{{Main|Sexual abuse scandal at Marylands School, Christchurch}}
[[Marylands School]], which was operated by the [[Brothers Hospitallers of St. John of God]], a Catholic religious order in [[Christchurch]], was the centre of a number of sex abuse cases. By 2006, the [[Australasia]]n branch of the St John of God order had paid out $5.1 million to survivors who had been sexually abused at the school.&lt;ref name="Henzell"&gt;{{cite news | last = Henzell| first = John| coauthors = | title = Trial attempt to regain faith | work =  | pages = 1| publisher = [[The Press]]| date = 2006-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; A nonprofit trust, the Survivors of Sex Abuse Trust, worked with many of the victims. Over 120 complaints were made in regard to sexual and physical abuse alleged to have occurred at the school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fresh allegations against order|last=Martin|first=Yvonne|date=2007-06-21|publisher=The Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the offences were committed in the 1970s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15124">The '''Charles A. Lindbergh Chair in Aerospace History''', also known as the '''Lindbergh Chair''',  is a one-year senior fellowship hosted by the U.S. [[National Air and Space Museum]] (NASM), to assist a scholar in the research and composition of a book about aerospace history. Named for the famous aviator [[Charles Lindbergh]], the position is competitive: one experienced scholar is selected each year from multiple applicants worldwide. Up to $100,000 is granted to the winner.&lt;ref name="Lindbergh Chair"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasm.si.edu/getinvolved/fellow/lindfellow.cfm |title=Charles A.

The Lindbergh Chair is one of four research fellowships administered by NASM within the [[Smithsonian Institution]]: the others are the Daniel and Florence Guggenheim Fellowship, the [[A. Verville Fellowship]], and the Postdoctoral Earth and Planetary Sciences Fellowship.&lt;ref name="NASM Fellowships"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasm.si.edu/getinvolved/fellow/index.cfm |title=National Air and Space Museum Research Fellowships |work=Get Involved: Internships &amp; Fellowships |publisher=[[National Air and Space Museum]] |accessdate=May 26, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110410065957/http://www.nasm.si.edu/getinvolved/fellow/index.cfm |archivedate=April 10, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Announced in 1977 at the 50th anniversary of Lindbergh's famous solo flight,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasm.si.edu/events/pressroom/presskits/museumkit/siflight.cfm |title=National Air and Space Museum Press Kit: The Smithsonian and Flight |work=Press Room |publisher=National Air and Space Museum |accessdate=May 26, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306040520/http://www.nasm.si.edu/events/pressroom/presskits/museumkit/siflight.cfm |archivedate=March 6, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 1978 was the first year that the Lindbergh Chair was occupied—British aviation historian [[Charles Harvard Gibbs-Smith]] was selected as the first recipient.&lt;ref name="VAObit"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/collections/periods_styles/features/history/staff_obituaries/photography/gibbs_smith/index.html |title=Charles Harvard Gibbs-Smith |work=Staff Obituaries |publisher=Victoria and Albert Museum |quote=Reproduced with kind permission of The Times ©Times Newspapers Limited |accessdate=May 26, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110115163356/http://www.vam.ac.uk/collections/periods_styles/features/history/staff_obituaries/photography/gibbs_smith/index.html# |archive-date=2011-01-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each Lindbergh Chair application is judged relative to the suitability of its proposal, the scholarly record of the applicant, the availability of relevant museum staff advisors knowledgeable on the proposed topic, whether the NASM can provide the specific resources,&lt;ref name="NASM Fellowships"/&gt; and the applicability of the proposal to NASM's work-in-progress series.&lt;ref name="NASM Application"/&gt; The winner is expected to reside in the [[Washington, DC]], area for nine months to a year, the academic year generally starting in September and ending by the following August. He or she is also expected to take part in discussions with museum staff and to attend professional seminars and colloquia.&lt;ref name="NASM Application"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasm.si.edu/getinvolved/fellow/fellowapp_instructions.pdf |title=General Instructions for Guggenheim, Verville, and Lindbergh Fellowship Applicants |work=Get Involved: Internships &amp; Fellowships |publisher=[[National Air and Space Museum]] |accessdate=May 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with access to primary research materials, the winner is given the use of an office, a phone and a computer.&lt;ref name="NASM Application"/&gt;

'''David Amiel Freedman''' (5 March 1938 – 17 October 2008) was Professor of Statistics at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. He was a distinguished mathematical statistician whose wide-ranging research included the analysis of [[martingale (probability theory)|martingale]] inequalities, [[Markov process]]es, [[de Finetti's theorem]], consistency of [[Bayes estimator]]s, [[sampling (statistics)|sampling]], the [[Bootstrapping (statistics)|bootstrap]], and procedures for testing and evaluating models. He published extensively on methods for [[causal inference]] and the behavior of standard statistical models under non-standard conditions&amp;nbsp;– for example, how [[regression model]]s behave when fitted to data from [[randomized experiment]]s.  Freedman also wrote widely on the application—and misapplication—of statistics in the social sciences, including [[epidemiology]], [[public policy]], and [[law]].

== Biography and awards ==
Freedman was a fellow of the [[Institute of Mathematical Statistics]] and the [[American Statistical Association]] and an elected fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]. He won the 2003 [[John J. Carty Award for the Advancement of Science]] from the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] "for his profound contributions to the theory and practice of statistics, including rigorous foundations for Bayesian inference and trenchant analysis of census adjustment."&lt;ref name=Carty&gt;{{cite web|title=John J. Carty Award for the Advancement of Science|url=http://www.nasonline.org/programs/awards/john-j-carty-award.html|publisher=National Academy of Sciences|accessdate=12 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a Fellow at the [[Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science]] in 1990, an [[Alfred P. Sloan Foundation]] Fellow in 1964–66, and a [[Canada Council]] Fellow at [[Imperial College London]] in 1960–61.

Freedman was born in [[Montreal, Quebec]], Canada, on 5 March 1938.  He received a B.Sc. from [[McGill University]] in 1958 and a M.A. and a Ph.D. from [[Princeton University]] in 1959 and 1960, respectively. He joined the [[University of California, Berkeley]] Department of Statistics in 1961 as a lecturer and was appointed to the research faculty in 1962. He remained at Berkeley his entire career. He started his professional life as a probabilist and mathematical statistician with Bayesian leanings but became one of the world's leading applied statisticians and a circumspect frequentist.

Freedman was a consulting or testifying expert on statistics in disputes involving [[employment discrimination]], fair loan practices, [[voting rights]], duplicate signatures on petitions, railroad taxation, [[ecological inference]], flight patterns of [[golf ball]]s, [[price scanner]] errors, [[Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy]] (Mad Cow disease), and sampling.  He consulted for the [[Bank of Canada]], the [[Carnegie Commission]], the [[San Francisco|City of San Francisco]], the [[County of Los Angeles]], and the [[Federal Reserve]], as well as the U.S. departments of energy, treasury, justice, and commerce. Freedman and his colleague Kenneth Wachter testified to the [[United States Congress]] and the courts against adjusting the 1980 and 1990 [[census]]es using estimates of differential undercounts. A 1990 lawsuit that sought to compel the [[United States Department of Commerce]] to adjust the census was heard on appeal by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]], which ruled unanimously in favor of the Commerce Department and Freedman and Wachter's analysis.  With David Kaye, Freedman wrote a widely used primer on statistics for lawyers and judges published by the [[Federal Judicial Center]], the education and research agency for the [[United States federal courts]].

In addition to his work in [[forensic statistics]], Freedman had a broad impact on the application of statistics to important medical, social, and public policy issues, such as [[clinical trial]]s, [[epidemiology]], [[economic models]], and the interpretation of [[scientific experiment]]s and [[observational studies]].  In his applied work, Freedman emphasized exposing and checking the assumptions that underlie standard methods, as well as understanding how those methods behave when the assumptions are false.  He characterized circumstances in which the methods continue to perform well, and those where they break down—regardless of the quality of the data. Two of his earlier results (1963 and 1965) investigate whether or not and under what circumstances a Bayesian learning approach is consistent, i.e. when does the prior converge to the true probability distribution given sufficiently many observed data. In particular the 1965 paper with the innocent title "On the asymptotic behaviour of Bayes estimates in the discrete case II" finds the rather disappointing answer that when sampling from a countably infinite population the [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian procedure]] fails almost everywhere, i.e. one does not obtain the true distribution asymptotically. This situation is quite different from the finite case when the (discrete) random variable takes only finite many values and the Bayesian method is consistent in agreement with earlier findings of Doob (1948).

Freedman was the author or co-author of 200 articles, 20 technical reports and six books, including a highly innovative and influential introductory statistics textbook, ''Statistics'' (2007), with Robert Pisani and Roger Purves, which has gone through four editions. The late [[Amos Tversky]] of [[Stanford University]] observed that "This is a great book. It is the best introduction to how to think about statistical issues...." It has a "wealth of real-world examples that illuminate principles and applications....a classic." Freedman's ''Statistical Models: Theory and Practice'' (2005) is an advanced text on statistical modeling that likewise achieves a remarkable integration between extensive examples and statistical theory.

Landmark articles by Freedman include "Statistical Models and Shoe Leather" (1991), "What is the Chance of an Earthquake?" (2003), "Methods for Census 2000 and Statistical Adjustments" (2007), and "On Types of Scientific Enquiry: The Role of Qualitative Reasoning" (2008).

'''Education in [[Eritrea]]''' is officially [[compulsory education|compulsory]] between 7 and 16 years of age.&lt;ref name=cp&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Eritrea.pdf Eritrea country profile]. [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (September 2005). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt; Important goals of [[Eritrea]]'s educational policy are to provide basic education in each of Eritrea's mother tongues&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Asfaha|first=Yonas Mesfun|author2=Jeanne Kurvers |author3=Sjaak Kroon |title=Literacy use and instruction in multilingual Eritrea|journal=Leeds African Studies Bulletin|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as to produce a society that is equipped with the necessary skills to function with a culture of self-reliance in the modern economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibe.unesco.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Publications/WDE/2010/pdf-versions/Eritrea.pdf |title=Eritrea |date=September 2010 |work=World Data on Education |publisher=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization |accessdate=2012-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The education infrastructure is currently inadequate to meet these needs.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;

==History==

{{Quote|''The first schools in Ertrea were those of the catholic missionaries, but in 1902 were officially created by the Italian government the first two elementary schools in Italian Eritrea, with two teachers from Italy: the first and main in Asmara and the second in Cheren.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scuoleasmara.it/scuola/scuola-coloniale.html  Scuola coloniale eritrea (in Italian)]&lt;/ref&gt; During colonial times most of the students were Italians, but after WW2 the number of Eritrean students has increased: in 1956 they were 17% of the students (while the Italians were 83%), while in 2015 they were nearly all. The highest-level institution (in the 1930s) was the Italian Lyceum "Ferdinando Martini" in Eritrea's capital, that was founded in 1926.''B. D'Ambrosio}}

Initially there were only a few religious schools in [[Italian Eritrea|Eritrea]], but with the Italian governments were started the first school systems in Eritrea mainly during the late 1930s (when was established the [[Eritrea Governorate]]). In 1940 Dr. [[Vincenzo Di Meglio]] promoted the creation of the "School of Medicine" in Asmara (the first university institution in Eritrea, located initially in the [[Liceo Sperimentale "G. Marconi"|Liceo Martini]]), under the direction of Prof. Ferro Luzzi&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilcornodafrica.it/st-nik%20scuola.pdf Nicky Di Paolo: "La Scuola di Medicina di Asmara" (in Italian)]&lt;/ref&gt;.

{{Quote|''In 1940 a group of Italian doctors under the leadership of Dr. Vincenzo Di Meglio promoted the creation of university studies in Asmara and in 1941 they created the "Scuola di Medicina" (using a section of the Liceo Martini), linked to the Asmara Hospital (then named "Regina Elena"). It was the first university institution of Eritrea and aimed at the preparation of students for the Faculty of Medicine in the University of Rome.''Silvia Nocchi}}

After [[WW2]] was created the [[University of Asmara|first university in Asmara]]. This university was founded in 1958, albeit by a different name as the ''Collegio Cattolico della Santa Famiglia'' while ruled by the Italian religious organization called 'Piae Madres Nigritiae' ("Comboni Sisters"): successively, in 1964 the university had been renamed as "University of Asmara".

In the 1990s the independent Eritrea started a program to bring literacy to all children in Eritrea. Since then the school system has reached nearly 90% of young [[Eritreans]].

==Levels education==
[[Image:Eritrea 13.jpg|thumb|Pupils in uniform]]
There are five levels of education in Eritrea, pre-primary, primary, middle, secondary and tertiary. There are nearly 238,000 students in the primary, middle, and secondary levels of education. There are approximately 824 schools&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 | title = Baseline Study on Livelihood Systems in Eritrea
 | publisher = National Food Information System of Eritrea
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; in Eritrea and two universities, [[University of Asmara]] (UoA) and the [[Eritrea Institute of Technology]] (EIST), as well as several smaller colleges and technical schools.

Current centers of tertiary education in Eritrea include, the College of Marine Biology, the College of Agriculture, the College of Arts and Social Sciences, the College of Business and Economics, the College of Nursing and Health Technology, as well as EIST and the UoA.There are some big primary and middle schools like Mai-Tesfa, Awet and Model&lt;ref name="college"&gt;{{cite web

The education system in Eritrea is also designed to promote private sector schooling, equal access for all groups (i.e. prevent gender discrimination, prevent ethnic discrimination, prevent class discrimination, etc.) and promote continuing education through formal and informal systems.

Barriers to education in Eritrea include traditional taboos, school fees (for registration and materials), and the cost barriers of low-income households.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statistics==

Statistics suggest that between 39 and 57 percent of school-aged children attend [[primary school]] and 21 percent attend secondary school.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt; Student-teacher ratios are high: 45 to 1 at the elementary level and 54 to 1 at the secondary level.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt; There are an average 63 students per classroom at the elementary level and 97 per classroom at the secondary level.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt; Learning hours at school are often less than four hours per day.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt; Skill shortages are present at all levels of the education system, and funding for and access to education vary significantly by gender (with [[Dropping out|dropout]] rates much higher for girls) and location.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt; 

The overall [[literacy rate]] in Eritrea is estimated to be about 67.8 percent, with young adults aged 15–24, 89 percent literate.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/er.html Eritrea]. CIA World Factbook&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://data.worldbank.org/country/eritrea Eritrea].

'''Georg Friedrich Parrot''' (15 July 1767 – 8 July 1852) was a [[Germany|German]] [[scientist]], the first [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of the [[University of Tartu|Imperial University of Dorpat]] (today [[Tartu]], [[Estonia]]) in what was then the [[Governorate of Livonia]] of the [[Russian Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Thomas [https://books.google.com/books?id=r1oWAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1895 Universal pronouncing dictionary of biography and mythology, Volume 2] 1901&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Georges-Frédéric Parrot was born in Mömpelgard (now [[Montbéliard]]) (then part of the [[Duchy of Württemberg]], from 1806 in France). His father, a [[surgeon]] by profession and the local duke’s [[physician]] in ordinary, had a respectable position in the society becoming the [[mayor]] of his hometown. As the family was [[Protestants]], they sent Georg Friedrich to study [[physics]] and [[mathematics]] at the [[University of Stuttgart]] in [[Stuttgart]], the capital of the Duchy (1782–1786).

==Career beginnings==
For several years after graduation, Parrot took positions as a private [[tutor]] in France and Germany, and in 1795 in Livonia, one of the [[Baltic governorates|Baltic provinces]] of the Russian Empire. His reasons for leaving [[Germany]] were mainly economic: as he was recently married, he needed a more regular income than he could gain from giving occasional private classes in mathematics and attending to various contests of [[invention]]s. His talent was noticed and he was appointed to be the first secretary of the Livonian Charitable and Economic Society (''Livländische gemeinnützige und ökonomische Sozietät'') founded in 1796 in [[Riga]], the capital of Livonia, for the promotion of [[science]] and new ideas of management. At that time, there was no longer a [[university]] in the region. Although King [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden]] had founded the [[Academia Gustaviana]] in 1632, it had ceased to exist in 1710 when [[Peter the Great]] had conquered the [[Baltic Sea]] provinces. Only in 1802 was the university re-founded by the order of the [[Tsar]] [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] as the only [[German language|German-language]] and [[Lutheran]] university in the Russian Empire. Parrot was initially appointed to the Chair of Pure and Applied Mathematics but after defending his [[doctoral dissertation]] “On the influence of Physics and Chemistry on Pharmacy” (''Über den Einfluss den Physic und Chemie auf die Arzneikunde'') in 1802, he was appointed to the Chair of Physics.

==Imperial University of Dorpat==
Due to his extraordinary energy, he became the first rector of the [[Imperial University of Dorpat]] (University of Tartu), being elected by the University Council consisting of all chaired professors. In this capacity, Parrot skillfully fought for the academic freedom and the self-government of the university, protecting her from the political pressure of Baltic German [[baron]]s who had been given the right to autonomously govern in the Baltic provinces. The university was re-opened on the initiative of the local aristocratic establishment but they disliked Parrot for his unconcealed sympathy to the ideals of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. Parrot openly talked about [[Social equality|equality]] of people, irrespective of their social status and heritage. In his inaugural speech at the opening ceremony of the University he said, addressing the students:
[[File:TKM 1240G, Tartu Ülikooli peahoone, Georg Friedrich Schlater.jpg|thumb|250px|The Imperial University of Dorpat, 1832–1835.]]
{{Quote frame|text=While you are using with a laudatory diligence all that science and art are able to provide for the benefit of your culture, the countryman is working for you on his field; he is devoting his toil for you, working in the hardest conditions all his days, even part of the nights, and because of that he is enforced to fall behind you in his cultural development.  [...] You understand that those who feed you are entitled to much more than merely a miserable existence, that they have every right to expect your gratitude, your respect, our gratitude, our respect.}}

According to the memoirs of Parrot’s contemporaries, these words made an inextinguishable impression. However, Parrot’s hour of triumph arrived on May 22, 1802. Tsar Alexander I stopped in [[Dorpat]] on his way to [[Klaipėda|Memel]] (Klaipėda) for the meeting with the King [[Frederick William III]] of [[Prussia]]. Parrot was nominated to give a speech in his honour with which he immediately won the sympathy of the young ambitious Tsar. Appealing to the ideal of enlightened monarchy, Parrot expressed his gratitude to the Tsar who had ordered the reopening of the university, and repeated the promise to honestly serve science and the whole humanity. Alexander was so delighted with Parrot’s eloquence that he asked him to prepare a written copy of his speech. This episode laid the foundations of a friendly relationship between the Tsar and Parrot, which lasted for ten years and proved to be extremely beneficial for the University, to say nothing about Parrot himself.

In 1811, Parrot was elected to be a corresponding member of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Imperial Academy of Sciences]], becoming a full member in 1826. In the same year, he retired from the University of Dorpat and continued his work as a head of the physics laboratory of the Academy of Sciences in [[Saint Petersburg]].  He died on a trip to [[Helsingfors]] (Helsinki), in 1852.

The Parrot dynasty left an indelible mark on the [[Science and technology in Russia|history of science in Russia]] and Estonia. His son, [[Friedrich Parrot]] (1791-1841), followed in his father's footsteps, making a career as a [[Natural history|naturalist]] and later assuming the rectorship at the University of Dorpat in 1830.  A pioneer of Russian and Estonian scientific mountaineering, he is best known for leading the first expedition to the summit of [[Mount Ararat]] in recorded history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Randveer|first1=Lauri|title=How the Future Rector Conquered Ararat|url=http://www.ut.ee/en/how-future-rector-conquered-ararat|publisher=[[University of Tartu]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RBTH"&gt;{{cite web|last=Giles|first=Thomas|title=Friedrich Parrot: The man who became the 'father of Russian mountaineering'|url=http://rbth.com/arts/literature/2016/04/27/friedrich-parrot-the-man-who-became-the-father-of-russian-mountaineering_588545|work=[[Russia Beyond the Headlines]]|date=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==250th Anniversary==
On the occasion of Parrot's upcoming 250th anniversary, University of Tartu purchased Parrot's original rector portrait, thought to have been lost, at an auction. The portrait was revealed at the Old Anatomical Theatre in Tartu in the summer of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Eljand-Kärp|first1=Viivika|title=200-year-old painting of G. F.

'''Gustav Langenscheidt''' (October 21, 1832 – November 11, 1895) was a [[Germans|German]] [[language teacher]], [[book publisher]], and the founder of [[Langenscheidt|Langenscheidt Publishing Group]].

== Life ==

Gustav Langenscheidt was the son of Johann Ludwig Langenscheidt, a decorator, and his wife Sophie Caroline Schwartze.  After graduating from high school in 1850 Langenscheidt started a commercial apprenticeship, which he completed in two years.

Between 1851 and the spring of 1853 Langenscheidt traveled to almost all the neighboring countries of Germany and covered around 7000 kilometers on foot and by stagecoach.  After returning to Germany he joined the army in summer of 1853.  During his time in the military Langenscheidt extensively studied the different ways of learning the [[French language]].

In 1857, he married Pauline Hartmann (1832 – 1903) in [[Berlin]] and had two daughters and four sons, including the writer and publisher [[Paul Langenscheidt]] and Carl Langenscheidt, who later became his successor.

Gustav Langenscheidt died on November 11, 1895, at the age of nearly 63 years. He was first buried in the old St. Matthew's Cemetery in [[Schöneberg]], and then in  his final resting place in the family grave in West [[Stahnsdorf]] in 1935. The family's [[mausoleum]] is in Department D of the cemetery.

== Work ==

[[File:Toussaint-Langenscheidt Spanisch 30.59-60.png|thumb|Example title page of a language learning letter for [[Spanish language|Spanish]], which uses the [[Toussaint-Langenscheidt method]]]]

Together with [[Charles Toussaint]] Langenscheidt developed a self-learning method, which he published in 1856 under the title ''Unterrichtsbriefe zur Erlernung der französischen Sprache'' ("Teaching letters for learning the French language"). Langenscheidt had copied the idea of such a teaching method and especially the sales strategy of [[William Cobbett]].  Since no publisher was interested in this teaching work, Langenscheidt himself established a publishing house on October 1, 1856.  These correspondence lessons became very popular and were widely read, so today Langenscheidt can be considered the "Father of [[distance education]]."

In 1857 Langenscheidt was appointed chief writer of the 11th Infantry Brigade in Berlin. In 1861, together with [[Carl Dalen]] and Henry Lloyd, Langenscheidt published "English lessons letters" (similar in structure to the French).  From 1867 Langenscheidt Publishing Group had its own [[printing press]].

From 1869 Langenscheidt worked with [[Karl Sachs]] and [[Césaire Villatte]] on the ''Encyklopädisches französisch-deutsches und deutsch-französisches Wörterbuch'' ("Encyclopedic French-German and German-French dictionary") and was finally able to publish it in 1880.  In 1874, Langenscheidt  was awarded the title of professor.

In 1891, in close collaboration with [[Eduard Muret]] and [[Daniel Sanders (lexicographer)|Daniel Sanders]], he started working on the English equivalent, the ''Encyklopädisches englisch-deutsches und deutsch-englisches Wörterbuch'' ("Encyclopedic English-German and German-English dictionary"). Langenscheidt did not live to see its publication; his son Carl, his successor, published it in 1901.

The [[Toussaint-Langenscheidt method]] is based on the language teaching methodology of [[James Hamilton (language teacher)|James Hamilton]] and [[Jean Joseph Jacotot]]. The revolutionary aspect of this method was that the focus was no longer on grammar, but on reading and communication.  Langenscheidt and Toussaint created a new [[phonetic transcription|phonetic alphabet]] for the representation of pronunciation in order to facilitate learning. This was used until the [[Second World War]], after which it was replaced by the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA).

'''HighWire Press''' is a US company that provides [[digital content]] development and [[hosting service]]s to ~140 influential societies, university presses and independent publishers that produce journals, books, and other scholarly publications. It was founded by [[Stanford University Libraries]] in 1995.&lt;ref name="HighwireAbout"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.highwirepress.com/about-us |title=About us |publisher=HighWire Press |accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HighWire also offers Bench&gt;Press,&lt;ref&gt;http://highwire.org/publishers/benchpress.dtl&lt;/ref&gt; a customizable peer-review manuscript submission and tracking system, used by ~65 publishers.

In 2014, majority ownership of HighWire Press was purchased by the [[private equity firm]] [[Accel-KKR]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.highwire.org/news/stanford-university%E2%80%99s-highwire-press-receives-growth-equity-investment-accel-kkr Stanford University’s HighWire Press receives Growth Equity Investment from Accel-KKR]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, it was announced that the entirety of the journals published by HighWire Press would be indexed in [[Meta (academic company)|Meta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.highwirepress.com/thought-leadership/news/ai-tool-meta-index-all-content-highwire-platform-increase-rapid|title=AI Tool Meta to Index All Content on HighWire Platform to Increase Rapid Discoverability |website=www.highwirepress.com |date=22 June 2017 |language=en|access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
HighWire-hosted publishers collectively make over 2 million articles available (out of 7.5 million articles) freely accessible.&lt;ref name="HighwireFree"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://highwire.stanford.edu/lists/freeart.dtl |title=Free online full-text articles |date=2014-01-14 |work=HighWire |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, the ''[[Journal of Biological Chemistry]]'' (JBC) (1905) published by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, was the first to launch online on the HighWire platform. Since then, a number of other journals use the technology service to develop and host their online content. Titles include, among many others:
* ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' (1880) American Association for the Advancement of Science
* ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]'' (PNAS), (1914) National Academy of Sciences
* ''[[eLife]]'' from elifesciences
* ''[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]]'' (the oldest continuously published journal) from the Royal Society
* ''[[American Journal of Botany]]'' (1914) by the Botanical Society of America
* ''[[The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition]] (1952) by the American Society for Nutrition
* ''[[Blood (journal)|Blood]]'' (1945) by the American Society of Hematology
* ''[[BMJ]]'' (British Medical Journal, 1840) BMJ Group, UK
* ''[[The EMBO Journal]]'', (1982) by the European Molecular Biology Organization, Germany
* ''[[The FASEB Journal]]'', (1987) Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology
* ''[[Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery]]'', (1903)
* ''[[Journal of Cell Biology]]'', (1955) Rockefeller University Press
 
The organization has grown significantly since its inception in 1995. In addition to journals, HighWire produces and hosts ebooks, conference proceedings, databases, and more. They use open source technologies, such as Drupal, as part of the front end of the newest version of the websites.

==Reviews and awards==
While HighWire is primarily a hosting facility, a 2007 study showed that its search engine outperformed [[PubMed]] in the identification of desired articles, and yielded a higher number of search results than when the same search was performed on PubMed. PubMed, however, was faster.&lt;ref name="pmid17184763"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vanhecke TE, Barnes MA, Zimmerman J, Shoichet S |title=PubMed vs. HighWire Press: a head-to-head comparison of two medical literature search engines |journal=Comput.

HighWire was the recipient of the 2003 [[Association for Learned and Professional Society Publishers]] (ALPSP) Award for "Service to Not-for-Profit Publishing", and was named one of the "Ten to Watch" organizations in the Scientific, Technical &amp; Medical information space in 2014 by Outsell.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.outsellinc.com/store/products/1211&lt;/ref&gt; Founding Director John Sack was awarded the Council of Science Editors (CSE) 2011 Award for Meritorious Achievement.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.councilscienceeditors.org/wp-content/uploads/v34n3p76.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Institute of Continuing Education''' (ICE) is a constituent part of the [[University of Cambridge]].  The institute encourages people in all walks of life to take advantage of [[continuing education]].

==Offerings, students, and staff==
ICE offers residential, online, weekend, summer, and part-time courses, as well as public lectures.&lt;ref name="CN1"/&gt;  The Institute also provides free public concerts performed by [[Cambridge]] musicians, featuring new student work alongside more traditional repertoire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/event/Ghislaine-McMullin-plays-Russian-cello-music/event-26046123-detail/event.html "Ghislaine McMullin plays Russian cello music”], ''[[Cambridge News]]'' (February 18, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ice.cam.ac.uk/what-we-do/madingley-concerts “University of Cambridge Institute of Continuing Education: Welcome to the Madingley Concerts”], Accessed June 17, 2015; [http://www.ice.cam.ac.uk/what-we-do “University of Cambridge Institute of Continuing Education: What We Do”], Accessed June 17, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute has an enrollment of over 6,000 students and has an academic staff of 13.  A summer program brings in another 1,000 students from over 60 countries.&lt;ref name="CN1"&gt;{{cite web|author1= Care, Adam|title=You’re never too old for a Cambridge education|url=http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/8217-old-Cambridge-education/story-23299689-detail/story.html|publisher=''[[Cambridge News]]''|accessdate=June 13, 2015|date=October 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The academic staff are called "lecturers", and the Institute's teaching is also accomplished by a group of about 300 "tutors" located in the Cambridge area and elsewhere.&lt;ref name=CN1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Barlow&gt;Barlow, Adrian.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=NKYABAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA19 Extramural: Literature and Lifelong Learning]'', pp. 18-19. (Lutterworth Press 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

ICE offers course credits via the United Kingdom's [[Credit Accumulation and Transfer Scheme]], and those credits may be transferable to other Cambridge degree programs, and to other U.K. and U.S. universities.&lt;ref name=Henderson /&gt;  The duration of study varies, from one and two-day courses, through two-year part-time master's degrees, and courses are often taken for personal interest or for professional development.&lt;ref name="CN1" /&gt;

==Headquarters and history==
The Institute's headquarters is in the village of [[Madingley]], [[Cambridgeshire]].  It is housed in Madingley Hall, about four miles west of the Cambridge city limits.&lt;ref name= Henderson /&gt;  Madingley Hall was built in the 1540s and was later rented by [[Queen Victoria]] for the young [[Prince of Wales]] (later [[Edward VII]]) while he was a student at Cambridge.&lt;ref name="CN1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Henderson /&gt;&lt;ref name="CN2"&gt;{{cite web|author1= Care, Adam|title=More than 380 species discovered at Cambridge University's Madingley Hall|url=http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/380-species-discovered-Cambridge-University-s/story-26376175-detail/story.html|publisher=''[[Cambridge News]]''|accessdate=June 13, 2015|date=April 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

ICE moved to Madingley Hall in 1975,&lt;ref name="CN1" /&gt; but has been educating part-time and adult students since the 1860s.&lt;ref name=Henderson&gt;Henderson, C.W.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=r3rDaCO-VFkC&amp;pg=PT87 Open the Gates to the Ivy League: A Plan B for Getting into the Top Colleges]'', p. 87 (Penguin 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the oldest continuing education department in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="CN1" /&gt;

The founder of ICE was University of Cambridge scientist [[James Stuart (scientist)|James Stuart]].&lt;ref name=Barlow /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://m.cambridge-news.co.uk/Institute-Continuing-Education-sponsor-Team-Year/story-26503588-detail/story.html "Institute of Continuing Education to sponsor Team of the Year prize at News' Junior Sports Award"], ''[[Cambridge News]]'' (May 15, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1867, Stuart gave a course of lectures in various cities, which marked the beginning of the university extension movement.  The University of Cambridge sanctioned the movement a few years later, in 1873, with the first course offered in [[Derby]] that year.&lt;ref&gt;Jarvis, Peter.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=SMMgRnWmf3YC&amp;pg=PA318 Adult Education and Lifelong Learning: Theory and Practice]'', p. 318 (Routledge 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supervision by university==
In 2008, when Cambridge University indirectly offered its stamp of approval for certificates in things like "garden history" and "creative writing", the university faced accusations of [[dumbing down]].&lt;ref name=Bingham&gt;Bingham, John.  [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/3902094/Garden-history-and-wellbeing-qualifications-from-Cambridge-University.html "Garden history and 'wellbeing' qualifications from Cambridge University”], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' (December 22, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;  According to ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', the university decided to, "take over the awarding of certificates currently offered by bodies such as the Cambridge Institute of Continuing Education….”&lt;ref name=Bingham /&gt;

Today, the work of ICE is controlled by the General Board of the University, through a management committee.  The institute's lecturers are all appointed by the University.&lt;ref name=Barlow /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3755">'''John Duncan Wiley''' (born March 23, 1942 in [[Evansville]], [[Indiana]]) is a faculty member and former chancellor of the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]. Wiley was named the 28th Chancellor of the University on November 10, 2000, and assumed office on January 1, 2001. He stepped down as chancellor and returned to the faculty on September 1, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.news.wisc.edu/wiley/&lt;/ref&gt; From November 1, 2008, through November 2011, he served as interim director of the [[Wisconsin Institute for Discovery]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.news.wisc.edu/19822&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career overview==
Wiley has had a long career with UW–Madison, with nearly 40 years of involvement as either a student, faculty member, or administrator. From 1994 to 2000, he served as Wisconsin's Provost and Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs. Prior to that, he was the University's Vice Chancellor for Research and Dean of the Graduate School and the Associate Dean for Research in the College of Engineering.

==Research==
A research physicist by training, Wiley's academic work has focused on research in [[semiconductors]] and [[solid state physics]]. He received his bachelor's degree in physics from [[Indiana University]] in 1964, and master’s and doctoral degrees in physics in 1965 and 1968 from UW–Madison on a [[National Science Foundation]] Fellowship. He returned to UW–Madison as a faculty member in the College of Engineering in 1975, after having worked with [[Bell Telephone Laboratories]] and at the [[Max Planck Institute]] in [[Stuttgart, Germany]] as an awardee of the [[Alexander von Humboldt]] Senior U.S. Service Award for Research and Training.

==Chancellor tenure==
His tenure as Chancellor was distinguished by record-breaking fund-raising efforts and a strong emphasis on strategic planning. Wiley attracted alumni and institutional investment to several projects on campus, most notably the Wisconsin Institutes of Discovery. A number of new construction projects were begun during his tenure, including two new dormitories, a new Microbial Sciences Building, and major expansions to the Business and Medical Schools. He also commissioned an expansive Campus Master Plan that would guide physical development of the campus for the next decade. Central to this plan is the creation of an East Campus Arts Corridor, which required the renovation or demolition of several existing campus buildings. Wiley, throughout his tenure, also sponsored and funding a number of different performing and visual arts activities both on and off campus, including a series of performances by artists across campus called "The Chancellor Presents . . .

She now runs a dance studio at [[Imperial Wharf]], London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=United Kingdom |url=http://www.karenhardystudios.com/ |title=London Dance School – Karen Hardy Studios – Chelsea / Fulham, London, SW6 2UB |publisher=Karen Hardy Studios |date=28 April 2012 |accessdate=18 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dancing career==
She started dancing aged five in her home town of [[Bournemouth]], and competed in the United States for two years from the age of 18 winning both East and West Coast amateur championship titles. She returned to the UK in 1990 after two years in America where she teamed up with new partner Mark Lunn. It only took 6 months before they broke into the finals worldwide, representing England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.karenhardy.com/2a.asp |title=Karen Hardy Dance : Who am I? |publisher=Karenhardy.com |date= |accessdate=18 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120430035329/http://www.karenhardy.com/2a.asp |archivedate=30 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hardy turned professional in August 1994, after being asked to partner [[South African]] dancer [[Bryan Watson (dancer)|Bryan Watson]]. They were highly successful from 1995–1999. In January 1995 they entered the Professional Final of the Pioneer United Kingdom Open Championship finishing fourth. Their progress to the top continued over the coming year going from fourth to first. The couple won the [[Carl Alan award]] for services to the dance world, and were named the most outstanding Latin American couple in 1995 by the [[Ballroom Dancers' Federation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.karenhardy.com/2b.asp |title=Karen Hardy Dance : Who am I? |publisher=Karenhardy.com |date= |accessdate=18 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505074733/http://www.karenhardy.com/2b.asp |archivedate=5 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; During their 5-year partnership they were World Masters, Osaka World Trophy, United Kingdom Open, International Open, British National, Italian Open, London Open, Yankee Classic Professional Latin American Champions.

Discussing her success, she writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
To create a step and then see it copied around the world is an indescribable reward. They don't come any more dedicated and focused than Bryan, and that's why we were able to break what had been set in stone for so long.&lt;ref&gt;''Strictly Come Dancing Official Guide'', 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hardy retired from competitive dancing in 1999 and moved into coaching. She was named Teacher of the Year in 2002 and 2003 at the Crystal Palace Dance Championships. She is also an adjudicator and now judges all of the Grand Slam events worldwide which she had previously competed in and more. She is a Senior Commentator for EuroSport DanceSport Series. Hardy also co-hosts as the Master of Ceremonies in the International Open to the World Championships held annually at the [[Royal Albert Hall]], London.

Hardy participated in the television series [[Faking It (UK TV series)|Faking It]] (Series 4) for [[Channel 4]].  Along with [[Paul Harris (choreographer)|Paul Harris]] they mentored a young female kick boxer to become a Latin American Dancer.

==Strictly Come Dancing==
After seven years retirement from competitions, Hardy appeared in the third series of the [[BBC]]'s television series ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]''. She appeared with journalist and presenter [[Bill Turnbull]], in the 2005 Christmas show with former World Heavyweight Champion [[Evander Holyfield]], and won the [[Strictly Come Dancing (series 4)|2006 series]] with cricketer [[Mark Ramprakash]]. She danced in the 2007 series with actor [[Brian Capron]]. They were eliminated in the first round.

In June/July 2007 Hardy completed filming the DVD "Strictly Come Dancersize" with [[Erin Boag]]. The DVD went on general release on 4 December 2007.

In the 2008 series of Strictly Come Dancing, Hardy partnered [[Gary Rhodes]]. They were knocked out in week 3. The [[Daily Mail]] newspaper reported that she had been "axed" from ''Strictly Come Dancing'' on 4 August 2009, although many ballroom fans suspected that she had retired from the show voluntarily to concentrate on her new dance school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jo Clements |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1203947/Axed-Strictly-Come-Dancing-star-Karen-Hardy-puts-BBC-ageism-row-night-town.html |title=Axed Strictly Come Dancing star Karen Hardy puts BBC ageism row behind her for night on the town |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=4 August 2009 |accessdate=18 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has since said that she left as due to Gary Rhodes work commitments he was unable to train much and so each week they would be struggling to do the routines. This caused arguments due to frustration on both sides which she didn't like causing her to "fall out of Love" with it.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} She does however continue to make regular appearances on sister-show ''[[Strictly Come Dancing: It Takes Two]]'' giving her professional opinion on the couple's training and performances.

In 2011 she appeared on the BBC red button service, giving live commentary on the dancing, a role she continued in 2012. 
From 2011 until 2017 Hardy had been a regular presenter on the sister show "It Takes Two".  Her Tuesday night slot "Choreography Corner" which has essentially become a review of the previous Saturday night show. Initially the focus was on specific pieces of interesting choreography.

==Personal life==
At the age of eight Hardy was diagnosed with a rare and acute form of [[ear cancer]]. Despite successive operations, the cancer returned three times. As a consequence of this, Hardy was advised to take up the art of ballroom dancing to compensate for the loss in her balance. A last-ditch operation when she was 21 cleared the cancer permanently. As a result of the cancer, Hardy lost 70% of the hearing in her left ear&lt;ref name="dailymail1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1090211/Strictlys-Karen-Hardy-Gary-Rhodes-want-quit-show.html |title=Strictly's Karen Hardy: Gary Rhodes has made me want to quit the show |publisher=[[Mail Online]] |date=28 November 2008 |accessdate=18 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in August 2012 was fitted with a hearing device.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/362711/Strictly-s-Karen-Hardy-and-her-battle-with-chronic-hearing-problems- Strictly's Karen Hardy and her battle with chronic hearing problems | Celebrity News | Showbiz &amp; TV | Daily Express].

Ryan was born in [[San Jose, California]], and was raised in several areas of the [[San Joaquin Valley]] and the [[Mojave Desert]].&lt;ref name=pbs&gt;{{cite interview | subject = Kay Ryan | title = Kay Ryan Discusses New Collection of Poems | url = https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/entertainment/july-dec06/poetry_07-26.html | type=Interview: Video/Transcript | work = Newshour with Jim Lehrer | publisher = PBS | date = July 26, 2006 | accessdate = 2008-07-18}}&lt;!--https://www.webcitation.org/5ZOxU0AfZ?url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/entertainment/july-dec06/poetry_07-26.html --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; After attending [[Antelope Valley College]], she received bachelor's and master's degrees in English from [[University of California, Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Kay Ryan, UCLA graduate in English, named 16th poet laureate of U.S. | last = Hewitt | first = Alison | date = 2008-07-17 | url = http://newsroom.ucla.edu/portal/ucla/poet-laureate-53591.aspx | publisher = UCLA | accessdate = 2008-09-12}} Ryan received her B.A. in 1967 and her M.A. in 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1971, she has lived in [[Marin County, California]], and has taught English part-time at the [[College of Marin]] in [[Kentfield, California|Kentfield]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Cohen | first = Patricia | title = Kay Ryan, Outsider With Sly Style, Named Poet Laureate | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/17/books/17poet.html?ex=1374120000&amp;en=a5a5e18fb6a6d6c9&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink | work = The New York Times | date = July 17, 2008 | accessdate = 2008-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carol Adair, who was also an instructor at the College of Marin, was Ryan's [[domestic partner|partner]] from 1978 until Adair's death in 2009.&lt;ref name="Halstead"&gt;{{cite news|last=Halstead |first=Richard |title=Kay Ryan rises to the top despite her refusal to compromise |url=http://www.marinij.com/ci_6975060 |work=Marin Independent Journal |date=September 23, 2007 |accessdate=2008-07-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ZfbVJ2ZL?url=http://www.marinij.com/ci_6975060 |archivedate=July 29, 2008 |df= }}&lt;!--archived copy at https://www.webcitation.org/5ZfbVJ2ZL?url=http://www.marinij.com/ci_6975060 .

Her first collection, ''Dragon Acts to Dragon Ends'', was privately published in 1983 with the help of friends.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan told Richard Halstead (''Marin Independent Journal'', 2007) that, "There is a certain onus on publishing one's own book. So, I wasn't terribly proud to be doing that. It was the act of a desperate woman, and it did me not a shred of good."&lt;/ref&gt; While she found a commercial publisher for her second collection, ''Strangely Marked Metal'' (1985), her work went nearly unrecognized until the mid-1990s, when some of her poems were anthologized and the first reviews in national journals were published.&lt;ref name="Gioia"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gioia |first=Dana |title=Review: Discovering Kay Ryan |journal=[[The Dark Horse (magazine)|The Dark Horse]] |issue=7 |date=Winter 1998–99 |url=http://www.danagioia.net/essays/eryan.htm |accessdate=2008-07-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ZOxN14Jb?url=http://www.danagioia.net/essays/eryan.htm |archivedate=July 18, 2008 |df= }}&lt;!--https://www.webcitation.org/5ZOxN14Jb?url=http://www.danagioia.net/essays/eryan.htm --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; She became widely recognized following her receipt of the [[Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize]] in 2004, and published her sixth collection of poetry, ''The Niagara River'', in 2005.

In July 2008, the U.S. [[Library of Congress]] announced that Ryan would be the sixteenth [[Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress]] for a one-year term commencing in Autumn 2008. She succeeded [[Charles Simic]].&lt;ref name="locpr" /&gt; In April 2009, the Library announced that Ryan would serve a second one-year term extending through May 2010.&lt;ref name="The Library of Congress"&gt;{{cite web | title = Library of Congress Appoints Kay Ryan to Second Term as U.S. Poet Laureate | date = April 13, 2009 | url = https://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2009/09-073.html | publisher = The Library of Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was succeeded by [[W.S.

==Poetry==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed:--&gt;
The Poetry Foundation's website characterizes Ryan's poems as follows: "Like Emily Dickinson and Marianne Moore before her, Ryan delights in quirks of logic and language and teases poetry out of the most unlikely places. She regards the 'rehabilitation of clichés,' for instance, as part of the poet’s mission. Characterized by subtle, surprising rhymes and nimble rhythms, her compact poems are charged with sly wit and off-beat wisdom." [[J. D. McClatchy]] included Ryan in his 2003 anthology of contemporary American poetry.&lt;ref name=McClatchy&gt;{{cite book | last = McClatchy | first = J. D. | title = The Vintage Book of Contemporary American Poetry:Second Edition | year = 2003 | publisher = Vintage Books | chapter = Kay Ryan | page = 530 | isbn = 978-1-4000-3093-4}} McClatchy included the following poems in this anthology: "Paired Things", "Mirage Oases", "A Cat/A Future", "The Old Cosmologists", "That Will to Divest", and "Drops in the Bucket".&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote in his introduction, "Her poems are compact, exhilarating, strange affairs, like Satie miniatures or Cornell boxes. … There are poets who start with lived life, still damp with sorrow or uncertainty, and lead it towards ideas about life. And there are poets who begin with ideas and draw life in towards their speculations. Marianne Moore and May Swenson were this latter sort of artist; so is Kay Ryan."&lt;ref name=McClatchy /&gt;

Ryan's poems are often quite short. In one of the first essays on Ryan, [[Dana Gioia]] wrote about this aspect of her poetry. "Ryan reminds us of the suggestive power of poetry–how it elicits and rewards the reader’s intellect, imagination, and emotions. I like to think that Ryan’s magnificently compressed poetry – along with the emergence of other new masters of the short poem like Timothy Murphy and H.L. Hix and the veteran ''maestri'' like Ted Kooser and Dick Davis – signals a return to concision and intensity."&lt;ref name="Gioia" /&gt; Ryan tends to avoid using the personal "I" in her poetry, claiming that she "didn’t want confession. [She] didn’t want to be Anne Sexton."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Ryan | first = Kay | title = Cooling the Surface, Tending the Cracks: An Interview with Kay Ryan | url = http://www.drunkenboat.com/db11/04kay/kay/interview.php | publisher = Drunken Boat | accessdate = October 28, 2013 | date = March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though distanced, her work is often deeply introspective, analyzing both the nature of the mind&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ryan | first = Kay | title = Elephant Rocks | year = 1996 | publisher = Grove Press | location = New York | isbn = 0-8021-3525-0 | pages = 20–21 | chapter = How a Thought Thinks}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the ability of language to mold reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ryan | first = Kay | title = The Best of It: New and Selected Poems | year = 2010 | publisher = Grove Press | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-8021-1914-8 | page = 5 | chapter = Bait Goat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many reviewers have noted an affinity between Ryan's poetry and Marianne Moore's.&lt;ref name="Muse"&gt;{{cite web | last = Muse | first = Charlotte | date = Autumn 1999 | title = Review: ''Elephant Rocks'' by Kay Ryan | work = The Able Muse | url = http://www.ablemuse.com/premiere/cmuse_review.htm | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20000901075329/http://www.ablemuse.com/premiere/cmuse_review.htm | archivedate = 2000-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the oft-remarked affinity with Moore, affinities with poets [[May Swenson]], [[Stevie Smith]], [[Emily Dickinson]], [[Wendy Cope]], and [[Amy Clampitt]] have been noted by some critics. Thus [[Katha Pollitt]] wrote that Ryan's fourth collection, ''Elephant Rocks'' (1997), is "Stevie Smith rewritten by William Blake" but that ''Say Uncle'' (2000) "is like a poetical offspring of George Herbert and the British comic poet Wendy Cope."&lt;ref name="Pollitt"&gt;{{cite web | last = Pollitt | first = Katha | date = November 8, 2000 | title = Shaking New Meanings Out of Worn Phrases | work = Slate.com | url = http://www.slate.com/id/2000213/ | accessdate = 2008-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another reviewer of ''Say Uncle'' (2000) wrote of Ryan, "Her casual manner and nods to the wisdom tradition might endear her to fans of A. R. Ammons or link her distantly to Emily Dickinson. But her tight structures, odd rhymes and ethical judgments place her more firmly in the tradition of Marianne Moore and, latterly, Amy Clampitt."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = PW staff writers | title = Review: ''Say Uncle'', Ryan, Kay (Author) | url = http://reviews.publishersweekly.com/bd.aspx?isbn=0802137172&amp;pub=pw | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070311014652/http://reviews.publishersweekly.com/bd.aspx?isbn=0802137172&amp;pub=pw | work = Publishers' Weekly | date = July 24, 2000 | archivedate = 2007-03-11 | accessdate = 2008-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ryan's wit, quirkiness, and slyness are often noted by reviewers of her poetry, but [[Jack Foley (poet)|Jack Foley]] emphasizes her essential seriousness. In his review of ''Say Uncle'' he writes, "There is, in short, far more darkness than 'light' in this brilliant, limited volume. Kay Ryan is a serious poet writing serious poems, and she resides on a serious planet (a word she rhymes with 'had it'). Ryan can certainly be funny, but it is rarely without a sting."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Kay Ryan, ''Say Uncle'' | last = Foley | first = Jack | work = [[The Alsop Review]] | accessdate = 2008-08-14 | url = http://www.alsopreview.com/columns/foley/jlkayryan.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061019191807/http://www.alsopreview.com/columns/foley/jlkayryan.html | archivedate = 2006-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these disjoint qualities in her work are illustrated by her poem "Outsider Art", which [[Harold Bloom]] selected for the anthology ''[[The Best of the Best American Poetry 1988–1997]]''.

Ryan is also known for her extensive use of internal rhyme. She refers to her specific methods of using internal rhyme as "recombinant rhyme." She claims that she had a hard time "tak[ing] end-rhyme seriously," and uses recombinant rhyme to bring structure and form to her work. As for other types of form, Ryan claims that she cannot use them, stating that it is "like wearing the wrong clothes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Paris Review – The Art of Poetry No. 94, Kay Ryan | last = Fay | first = Sarah | work = [[The Paris Review]] | accessdate = 2010-09-16 | url = http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/5889/the-art-of-poetry-no-94-kay-ryan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Gilmour was a teacher at [[Pinelands High School]]&lt;ref name="History of LEAP" /&gt; in Cape Town in 1987 when he decided to respond to a call from individuals within the South African business community, to contribute to the redress of the devastation of the [[Bantu Education Act]],&lt;ref name="History of LEAP" /&gt; a segregation law imposed in the education sector by the [[Apartheid]] system in 1953.

“Africa Week” was then introduced by a team led by John Gilmour to bring black learners under the “Bantu Education” system to spend a week at Pinelands High School, which was then a white’s only school. The program became the precursor for the Langa Education Assistance Program (or LEAP) which aimed at providing one hundred black students from the Langa township, with support tuition from Pinelands High teachers in [[English language|English]], [[Maths]] and [[Science]], three afternoons a week.

The prohibitive transport cost of bringing learners from the township schools to Pinelands High School forced the model to be revised. In 1996, it was then decided that instead of learners being bussed in to Pinelands High, teachers will be transported to meet learners in township schools.&lt;ref name="History of LEAP" /&gt;

Community members in Langa perceived the new model of LEAP as an attempt of white teachers to “save” black children. Teachers from the community felt that they were as able as other teachers to provide extra lessons that would address the inadequacies in the students' educational foundations.  The uneasiness within the community obliged the leadership of LEAP to change the model and include community teachers in the program.

When John Gilmour realised that despite best efforts of LEAP and similar programs in the country there was no increase in the proportion of black learners entering university, especially science-based disciplines, he sought for an alternative model. LEAP Science and Maths school was the alternative model.

===LEAP Science and Maths School===

LEAP Science and Maths school was a deliberate decision of John Gilmour seeking to increase the number of black learners who take science and maths-based modules at high school in order to increase the chance of being accepted at University, particular in disciplines where these modules are a prerequisite.&lt;ref name="A Leap in the dark"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Terblanche|first1=Barry|title=A leap in the dark|publisher=Mail and Guardian|date=19 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John resigned as Headmaster of Abbot’s College in 2004, where he has been since he left Pinelands in 1997, to focus on LEAP Science and Maths School.  In January 2004, the first LEAP Science and Maths School opened its doors in the suburb of Observatory, Cape Town, with seventy-two learners, seven teachers and one administrative staff member.&lt;ref name="History of LEAP" /&gt;

===Expansion of the LEAP model===

====LEAP 1====

The LEAP Science and Maths school, which started in Observatory later moved to Pinelands and become known as LEAP 1. It serves learners from community of Langa Township. It is the first and oldest of the LEAP Science and Maths schools.&lt;ref name="History of LEAP" /&gt; The school is headed by its Operation Leader Oscar Dlodlo.

====LEAP 2====

LEAP 2 opened in 2007 also in Pinelands. It serves learners from the townships of Gugulethu and Crossroads. In 2013, the school opened satellite classes to serve grade 9 and 10 learners from the township of Delft. Learners of the school are taught in English and [[isiXhosa]]. The head of the school is Mr. Babele Emedi, who also assumes the role of Operations Leader.&lt;ref name="History of LEAP" /&gt;

====LEAP 3====

The school opened its doors in 2008 to serve learners from the township of Alexandra in [[Johannesburg]].  Learners are taught in [[English language|English]], [[isiZulu]], [[Sepedi]] and [[Sesotho]] under the leadership of the Operations leader, Mr. Mark Fletcher.&lt;ref name="History of LEAP" /&gt;

====LEAP 4====

This school is situated in the township of [[Diepsloot]] just outside Johannesburg. The school opened in 2011 through a partnership with the South Africa corporate Aveng Group.&lt;ref name="Aveng Group Projects"&gt;{{cite web|title=Aveng Group Projects|url=http://www.aveng.co.za/csi-trust/projects/leap-science-and-maths-school|website=http://www.aveng.co.za/csi-trust/projects/leap-science-and-maths-school|publisher=Aveng Group|accessdate=10 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141003105051/http://www.aveng.co.za/csi-trust/projects/leap-science-and-maths-school|archivedate=3 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; LEAP 4 teaches learners in isiZulu and [[Sepedi]] as home languages, along with English.  Paul Mumba, is the Operations Leader and head of LEAP 4.

====LEAP 5====

In 2012, LEAP 5 opened its doors in Jane Furse, [[Sekhukhune District Municipality|Sekhukhune]] in [[Limpopo]] province. The school is under the leadership of its Operation Leader, Raphael Mukachi.

====LEAP 6====

LEAP 6 is situated in [[Ga-Rankuwa]] near [[Pretoria]]. The school opened in 2012 to respond to the request of the Anglican Diocese of Pretoria, concerned with the community’s poor educational results and high unemployment rate, particularly among young people. The school is led by its Operation Leader, Lawrence Manyesa.

==Vision==

“We strive for the positive transformation of communities through the meaningful education of children from those communities”&lt;ref name="About LEAP"&gt;{{cite web|title=About LEAP|url=http://leapschool.org.za/aboutleap/|website=http://leapschool.org.za/aboutleap/|publisher=LEAP Science and Maths Schools|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==

“LEAP schools provide student-centered, math’s and science-focused education to economically disadvantaged students from grades 8 to 12. We focus on enabling the self-awareness necessary for each student’s growth to healthy adulthood, and to ensuring optimal academic results which will allow for choices for lifelong learning and a fulfilling future.”&lt;ref name= "About LEAP" /&gt;

== Values and focus==

Although LEAP schools focus on Maths and Sciences; it puts a lot of emphasis on the emotional [[child development|development]] of learners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dugger|first1=Celia W|title=New Schools in South Africa Serve the Underserved|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/09/world/africa/09safrica.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=3&amp;|accessdate=10 November 2014|publisher=New York Times|date=8 September 2010|ref=New Schools in South Africa Serve the Underserved}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Gilmour acknowledged the importance of the emotional development in a country where “eight million children come from single-parent households and a further 4.3 million reside with neither biological parent”.  In his article “A tale of two systems”, he speaks of LEAP’s response to this problem “has been to recognise that social transformation starts with personal transformation:  one person at a time, one room at a time, one school at a time and one community at a time.”&lt;ref name="A tale of two systems"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gilmour|first1=John|title=A tale of two systems|url=http://leapschool.org.za/2012/02/12/a-tail-of-two-systems/|website=http://leapschool.org.za/|publisher=LEAP Science and Maths Schools|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school cherishes the following values:
*Being kind, honest and healthy
*Being punctual and looking good
*Working hard and never giving up
*Admitting and learning from mistakes
*Confronting issues and being open to change
*Working together and sharing

== Success stories==

===Statistics===

In a report that analyses the performance of the school between 2005 and 2013, LEAP reported that:

*Its grade 12 learners have achieved a 93% pass rate within the reporting period.
*600 learners passed the National Senior Certificate (NSC) examinations commonly known as “matric”
*77% qualified for study at academic and technical universities with a bachelor or diploma pass.&lt;ref name=Success&gt;{{cite web|title=Success|url=http://leapschool.org.za/success/|website=http://leapschool.org.za/success/|publisher=LEAP Science and Maths Schools|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school claims to outperform national statistics when it compares itself with national averages of learners who write maths and science in 2013. All LEAP learners wrote these modules compared to only 43% who took maths and 33% who took physical science nationally.&lt;ref name="LEAP Annual Report 2013"&gt;{{cite web|title=LEAP Annual Report 2013|url=http://leapschool.org.za/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/LEAP_AnnualReport2013.pdf|website=http://leapschool.org.za/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/LEAP_AnnualReport2013.pdf|publisher=LEAP Science and Maths Schools|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Graduates===

Bonisanani Mtshekisa&lt;ref name="Never Give Up"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mtshekisa|first1=Bonisanani|title=Never Give Up|url=http://leapschool.org.za/2011/08/08/never-give-up/|website=http://leapschool.org.za/2011/08/08/never-give-up/|publisher=LEAP Science and Maths Schools|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is LEAP’s first university graduate. He graduated with a bachelor in [[Bachelor of Commerce]] in Finance from the [[University of the Western Cape]]. In its 2012 annual report, the school reported to have over 30 university graduates ranging from physiotherapist, engineer to accountants.

===Celebratory adverts===

In 2014, LEAP launched a series of celebratory adverts to showcase its work and celebrate the achievements of its past students. Qondisa Nxganga, a Master’s graduate from the prestigious [[African Institute for Mathematical Sciences]] (AIMS), is featured in these adverts alongside a number of other LEAP alumni.&lt;ref name="Celebrating LEAP Alumni"&gt;{{cite web|title=Celebrating LEAP Alumni|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPYGiXxlQCo|website=www.youtube.com|publisher=LEAP Science &amp; Maths School|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Partnerships===

LEAP’s model is based on strong engagement with the broader community and building beneficial partnerships and collaboration with other organizations, particular schools. It is a three-way collaboration approach where each LEAP school partners with a more privileged school as well as a less privileged school (a township school) in the community where it operates to promote a culture of shared resources and cultural exchange&lt;ref name=Schools&gt;{{cite web|title=Schools|url=http://leapschool.org.za/schools/|website=http://leapschool.org.za/schools/|publisher=LEAP Science and Maths Schools|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LEAP has also been successful in building strong partnerships with both commercial and non-profit organizations. Most of its funding comes from South African corporates, trusts and Foundations.

LEAP, is Teach with Africa’s partner on the continent and together they have established the Teacher Institute which seeks to develop teachers and supports individuals wanting to enter the teaching profession&lt;ref name="Teach for Africa"&gt;{{cite web|title=Teach for Africa|url=http://www.teachwithafrica.org/what-we-do/our-in-country-partners/|website=http://www.teachwithafrica.org/what-we-do/our-in-country-partners/|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Life skills-based education''' ('''LSBE''') is a form of education that focuses on cultivating personal [[life skills]] such as self-reflection, critical thinking, problem solving and interpersonal skills. LSBE aims to help children reach their full personal potentials and to prepare them for the challenges of everyday life. 

Life skills-based education has a long history of supporting child development and health promotion in many parts. In 1986, the [[Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion]] recognized life skills in terms of making better health choices. The 1989 [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] (CRC) linked life skills to education by stating that education should be directed towards the development of the child’s fullest potential. The 1990 Jomtien Declaration on Education for All took this vision further and included life skills among essential learning tools for survival, capacity development and quality of life. The 2000 Dakar World Education Conference took a position that all young people and adults have the human right to benefit from "an education that includes learning to know, to do, to live together and to be", and included life skills in two out of the six EFA Goals.

Life skills-based education is now recognized as a methodology to address a variety of issues of child and youth development and thematic responses including as expressed in UNGASS on HIV/AIDS (2001), UNGASS on Children (2002), World Youth Report (2003), World Program for Human Rights Education (2004), UN Decade on Education for Sustainable Development (2005), UN Secretary General’s Study on Violence Against Children (2006), 51st Commission on the Status of Women (2007), and the World Development Report (2007).

Expected learning outcomes include a combination of knowledge, values, attitudes and skills with a particular emphasis on those skills that related to critical thinking and problem solving, self-management and communication and inter-personal skills.

In Washington, D.C., a prayer and vigil was held at the [[Washington National Cathedral]] on the eve of the rally, as a memorial for the victims of gun violence, and to declare the church's belief, "This work is rooted in our commitment to Jesus' command to love our neighbors as ourselves... We gather out of a conviction that the right to bear arms does not trump the right to life."&lt;ref name="WNC"&gt;Washington National Cathedral.

On March 21, NRA TV host Grant Stinchfield stated that "March for Our Lives is backed by radicals with a history of violent threats, language and actions"; fact-checker [[PolitiFact]] has rated this statement as being "without merit" and "[[wiktionary:liar liar pants on fire|Pants on Fire]]" indicating that it is a "ridiculous claim".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Greenberg|first1=Jon|title=NRA says violent radicals are behind the March for Our Lives|url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/mar/23/national-rifle-association/nra-says-violent-radicals-are-behind-march-our-liv/|publisher=[[PolitiFact]]|accessdate=March 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Holan|first1=Angie|title=The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter: PolitiFact's methodology for independent fact-checking|url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2018/feb/12/principles-truth-o-meter-politifacts-methodology-i/#Truth-O-Meter%20ratings|publisher=[[PolitiFact]]|accessdate=March 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the march was occurring, the [[National Rifle Association|NRA]] posted a membership drive video on their Facebook page, declaring that the "protests aren't spontaneous. Gun-hating billionaires and Hollywood elites are manipulating and exploiting children as part of their plan to DESTROY the Second Amendment". Another video dubbed "A March for Their Lies" was uploaded to [[YouTube]] featuring [[Colion Noir]], in which he described the planned rally as a "carnival of a march". Noir also said in the video that there is an "agenda that's a million times bigger than the guns".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Griggs|first1=Brandon|title=Here's what the NRA had to say today about the March for Our Lives|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/03/24/us/nra-march-response-trnd/index.html|publisher=[[CNN]]|accessdate=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/march-for-our-lives-nra-responds/|title="March for Our Lives": NRA posts membership drive, YouTube video about march|work=CBS|first=Caroline |last=Linton|date=March 24, 2018|accessdate=March 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Boggioni|first1=Tom|title='No one would know your names': NRA host taunts Parkland teens over their dead classmates on eve of DC march|url=https://www.rawstory.com/2018/03/no-one-know-names-nra-host-taunts-parkland-teens-dead-classmates-eve-dc-march/|publisher=[[The Raw Story]]|accessdate=March 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported that there were many [[Democratic party of the United States|Democrats]] encouraging the marchers, and many of them, including candidates for office, participated from the sidelines in the march, but few [[Republican party of the United States|Republicans]] did similarly.&lt;ref name="twsWashPost900"&gt;{{cite news|first=David |last=Wiegel |date=March 24, 2018 |work=[[The Washington Post]]| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/democrats-message-at-anti-gun-violence-rallies-do-what-the-students-say/2018/03/24/1a9afbd6-2f87-11e8-8688-e053ba58f1e4_story.html?wpisrc=nl_headlines&amp;wpmm=1 |title=Democrats' message at gun-control rallies: Do what the students say| quote=Democrats' message at gun-control rallies: Do what the students say ... politicians, most of them Democrats, cheered them on ...

On the day of the protests, Florida [[Republican party of the United States|Republican]] senator [[Marco Rubio]] responded by stating: "However, many other Americans do not support a gun ban" and "view banning guns as an infringement on the Second Amendment rights of law abiding citizens that ultimately will not prevent these tragedies". He called for protesters to find "common ground with those who hold opposing views" for change to happen. However, a blanket gun ban was not called for by the protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Cummings|first1=William|title=Marco Rubio tells March for Our Lives crowd many oppose gun bans|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/03/24/marco-rubio-statement-march-our-lives/455912002/|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=March 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sen.

Former Republican senator and presidential candidate [[Rick Santorum]] criticized the Parkland activists, suggesting during an interview with [[CNN]] that students should be learning ways to respond to a shooter rather than asking lawmakers "to solve their problem"; Santorum advised students to take classes in [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] rather than marching in Washington.&lt;ref name="twsPolitico5544"&gt;{{cite web |work=Politico |first=Kevin |last=Robillard |date=March 25, 2018 |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2018/03/25/santorum-cpr-parkland-students-guns-484543 |title=Santorum: Parkland students should learn CPR instead of marching |accessdate=March 25, 2018 |quote=...

Former Democratic President [[Barack Obama]] said that he was "so inspired by all the young people" who made March for Our Lives possible. He addressed them: "Keep at it. You're leading us forward. Nothing can stand in the way of millions of voices calling for change."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Obama's message to marchers: 'You're leading us forward'|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/03/24/politics/obama-tweet-march-trnd/index.html?sr=twCNN032418obama-tweet-march-trnd0215PMVODtop|publisher=[[CNN]]|accessdate=March 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Media ===
A report in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' praised the leaders of the march for their "extraordinary inclusiveness" in that they expanded the locus of concern from suburban schools to those of urban neighborhoods as well.&lt;ref name="twsNewYorker3324"&gt;{{cite web |first=Margaret |last=Talbot |date=March 25, 2018 |work=The New Yorker |url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-extraordinary-inclusiveness-of-the-march-for-our-lives |title=The Extraordinary Inclusiveness of the March for Our Lives |accessdate=March 25, 2018 |quote=....leadership has managed to broaden the locus of concern beyond mass shootings at comfortable suburban schools ... to gun violence in urban neighborhoods as well...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On social media, fake pictures and [[GIF]]s of [[Emma González]] tearing up a copy of the [[U.S. Constitution]] were circulated in an effort to discredit the march. The images were doctored from originals of González tearing up a shooting target sign. Actor and conservative commentator [[Adam Baldwin]] defended circulating the doctored images as "political satire".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/fake-photo-emma-gonzalez-slammed-860143|title=Fake Photo of Emma Gonzalez Slammed as Bid to Discredit March for Our Lives|work=Newsweek|first=Sofia |last=Lotto Persio|date=March 26, 2018|accessdate=March 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/03/some-conservatives-are-sharing-a-fake-photo-of-emma-gonzalez.html|title=People Are Sharing Fake Photos of Emma González Tearing Up the Constitution|work=New York Magazine|first=Chas |last=Danner|date=March 26, 2018|accessdate=March 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mary Rockwell Hook''' (September 8, 1877 &amp;ndash; September 8, 1978) was an [[Americans|American]] [[architect]] and a pioneer for women in [[architecture]]. She worked principally from [[Kansas City, Missouri]] but designed throughout the United States.  She was denied admission to the [[American Institute of Architects]] (AIA) because of her gender.

However, she did obtain recognition for her work, including by the AIA, later, on her 100th birthday.  And according to an article in the newsletter of the [[International Archive of Women in Architecture]], "Mary Rockwell Hook will be remembered, not because she was a woman working in a 'man's field,' but because she was a successful designer who made her mark in the field of architecture."&lt;ref name="iawa"&gt;{{cite web| url =http://spec.lib.vt.edu/IAWA/news/news3.html| title =IAWA Spotlight: Mary Rockwell Hook| publisher =[[International Archive of Women in Architecture]]| accessdate =2008-03-23|date=Autumn 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1910 - 1930, there were actually five women who worked as architects in the Kansas City area.  Hook was the only one to achieve any wider recognition.&lt;ref name=mrh_tr/&gt;{{rp|24}}

==Background==

===Personal life===
Born in [[Junction City, Kansas|Junction City]], [[Kansas]], Mary was the third of five daughters of Bertrand Rockwell (1844-1930), a captain of the Army and successful grain merchant and banker, and Julia Marshall Snyder (1850-1947), a vital woman who was the first historian for the parish known today as [[Grace and Holy Trinity Cathedral]] of the [[Episcopal Diocese of West Missouri]], in Kansas City, Missouri. In 1906, the Rockwell family moved to [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]]. Mary Rockwell married Inghram D. Hook (1883-1973), an attorney, in 1921.&lt;ref name="whmc-kc"&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.umkc.edu/whmckc/collections/IKC0010.HTM| title =Mary Rockwell Hook (1877-1978) Papers (KC0010)| publisher =Western Historical Manuscript Collection - Kansas City| accessdate =2008-03-23|date=2006-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple adopted two boys, Eugene and Edward (Dick). Mary died on her 101st birthday.

===Education===
Mary Rockwell (later Hook) graduated from [[Wellesley College]] in 1900. According to Hook's [[autobiography]], she decided to become an architect after a 1902 family trip abroad:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It was during this trip home from the [[Philippines]] that I decided someone needed to improve the design of the buildings used by our government abroad. I made up my mind to go home and study architecture.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=This and That|last=Hook|first=Mary Rockwell|publisher=Mary Rockwell Hook|year=1970|isbn=|location=Kansas City, Missouri, and Sarasota, Florida|pages=1–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1903, she enrolled as the only woman in her class in the architecture department at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]].

===Gender discrimination===
In 1905, Rockwell (later Hook) went to [[Paris]] to study in the atelier of Marcel Auburtin, an admirer of her sister Kitty, as a prerequisite for being admitted at the [[École des Beaux-Arts]].&lt;ref name="iawa" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clausen|first=Meredith|date=June 2010|title=The Ecole Des Beaux-Arts: Toward a Gendered History|url=|journal=Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians|volume=69|issue=2|pages=153–161|DOI: 10.1525/jsah.2010.62.2.153,=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a female student in a predominantly male school, Rockwell (Hook) faced [[gender discrimination]]. In 1906, after her entrance examinations at the [[École des Beaux-Arts]], French male students intended to fling buckets of water at her as she fled through the courtyard.&lt;ref name="iawa"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She did not pass the exam nor repeated it as other students did and thus did not study at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Instead, she explored French architecture on bicycle trips with her sister.

''[[The Kansas City Star]]'' later wrote that the era was one "when male architects were openly antagonistic to women joining the profession."&lt;ref name="iawa"/&gt;

Discrimination did not end with her training. When she applied for her first job in an architecture office in Kansas City, she was rejected because "you can't swear at women and they can't climb all over full sized details."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, the next firm gladly employed her, although without a salary because her father did not allow her to be paid.

The [[American Institute of Architects]] (AIA) denied Hook's membership because of her gender. Upon her 100th birthday in 1977, however, the professional organization presented her with a plaque for distinguished service. Kansas City residents further celebrated the occasion by touring famous homes that she had designed locally.&lt;ref name="iawa" /&gt;

==Career and impact==

===Pine Mountain Settlement School===
Around 1913, when [[Katherine Pettit]] and Ethel De Long Zande were preparing for the foundation of [[Pine Mountain Settlement School]] in the Appalachian Mountains, Ethel wrote Mary Rockwell asking her to plan its campus. By then, she had successfully designed several houses. Hook later described [[Pine Mountain (ridge)|Pine Mountain]] as "an 18th-century world" where "there is no village to mar the peaceful landscape, where trains, motors, and chewing gum have not penetrated."&lt;ref name="iawa"/&gt;

After studying the area, the three agreed that lower lands should be used for farming to feed the students while steeper lands would be used for construction. Public buildings would be central, and cottages would line the edges of the valley.&lt;ref name="iawa"/&gt;

Rockwell's (later Hook) first project for the campus construction was the renovation of a dilapidated [[log cabin]] called Old Log House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721043256/http://kydgi.ky.gov:2005/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/Pmt2&amp;CISOPTR=78&amp;REC=6|title=Kentucky Historical Society Digital Collections : Item Viewer|date=21 July 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She next designed a log house for Pettit. Hook worked with local resources in her designs, including [[chestnut]], [[populus|poplar]], [[oak]], and [[boulder]]s. Even though a mill was installed on campus, it took more than a year to cut and dry lumber for Laurel House,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721043318/http://kydgi.ky.gov:2005/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/Pmt2&amp;CISOPTR=23&amp;REC=5|title=Kentucky Historical Society Digital Collections : Item Viewer|date=21 July 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the school's dining hall.&lt;ref name="iawa"/&gt;

Hook remained involved with the school as a member of the [[Trustee|Board of Trustees]] until she was over 90 years old.&lt;ref name="iawa"/&gt; [[Pine Mountain Settlement School]] is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] and is now a [[List of National Historic Landmarks in Kentucky|National Historic Landmark]].&lt;ref name="about pmss"&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.pinemountainsettlementschool.com/about.php| title =About PMSS| publisher =Pine Mountain Settlement School| accessdate =2008-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hook and Remington===
In 1923, Hook returned to Kansas City and started the Hook and Remington architectural firm with partner Eric Douglas Macwilliam Remington (1893-1975).&lt;ref name="whmc-kc"/&gt; They worked together until 1932 when Remington settled in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Obituary|last=Remington|first=Eric Douglass Macwilliam|date=1975-12-22|work=The Kansas City Times|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== White House ===
Despite blindness in her later years, Hook imagined designs and offered ideas to modify the [[White House]] and other buildings.&lt;ref name="iawa"/&gt;

===Architectural style===

====Kansas City====
Mary Rockwell Hook's Kansas City designs date from as early as 1908, with her most eminent work completed during the 1920s and 1930s in the Sunset Hills area. Many of her designs in Sunset Hills pay tribute to the architectural styles she witnessed during childhood trips to [[Europe]] and [[East Asia]]. Hook's [[Italianate architecture]] was evidenced by her synthesis of brick, stone, and antique materials with tiles, frescoes, and leaded panes. Hook's own home, which she designed in 1925, is one example of an Italianate residence.&lt;ref name="iawa"/&gt;  Nine of Hook's works in Kansas City were studied in a National Register of Historic Places "Thematic Resources" study and were listed on the National Register with extensive descriptions and analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dnr.mo.gov/shpo/nps-nr/64000399.pdf|title=Residential Structures in Kansas City by Mary Rockwell Hook|last=National Register of Historic Places|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mrh_tr&gt;{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=64000399}} |title=Residential Structures by Mary Rockwell Hook TR|date=June 29, 1983|author=Sherry Piland and Elaine Ryder|publisher=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of Hook's early houses were commissioned for members of her family.  She later also received several commissions from non-family members.

==== California ====
While the Rockwell family traveled widely for the enrichment of their daughters' education, Bertrand Rockwell sought the mild climate of Northern California to improve his health on the advice of his brother-in-law, a medical doctor in Santa Rosa. There, Mary's sister Florence met and married James Edwards. Around 1908, Mary built a house for them in Santa Rosa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Elliott|first=Jeffrey|date=November 2013|title=The House that Mary Built|url=|journal=Santa Rosa History|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The asymmetrical house was designed in the First Bay Area Tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Guide to Architecture in San Francisco and Northern California|last=Gebhard et al|first=David|publisher=Gibbs Smith|year=1973|isbn=0-87905-202-3|location=Layton, Utah|pages=565}}&lt;/ref&gt; For many years, the architect of the house was unknown and assumed to be Julia Morgan&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Julia Morgan Architect|last=Boutelle|first=Sara Holmes|publisher=Abbeville Press|year=1988|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or Brainerd Jones of Petaluma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/The-man-who-built-Petaluma-Brainerd-Jones-2522848.php|title=The man who built Petaluma/Brainerd Jones designed much of what is now the city's historic section|last=Weinstein|first=David|date=2006-02-18|website=SFGate.com|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The house is listed under the name of the second owner as the Wasserman House on the National Register of Historic Places.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://npgallery.nps.gov./AssetDetail/NRIS/79000562|title=National Register of Historic Places|last=|first=|date=|website=nps.gov|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170916053613/https://npgallery.nps.gov/AssetDetail/NRIS/79000562|archive-date=2017-09-16|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the listing does not include the well-documented findings of architectural historian Jeffrey Elliott such as the names of the first owners, James and Florence Edwards, nor the architect's name, Mary Rockwell (Hook).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://santarosahistory.com/wordpress/2013/11/the-house-that-mary-built/|title=The House that Mary Built|last=Elliott|first=Jeffrey|date=November 2013|website=Santa Rosa History|access-date=2007-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The house was transformed into an office building with careful attention to the original design.

The second house in California was designed at the height of her career in 1926 as an impressive French mansion called "Le Soleil" for Francis and Katherine Crosby in Woodside, an hour south of San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=C.|first=W.C.|date=October 1933|title=The Estate of Mr. and Mrs. Francis H. Crosby, near Woodside|url=|journal=The Peninsulan|volume=2| issue = 1|pages=12–13 and 28–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.refin.com/CA/Woodside/320-Harcross-Rd-94062/home/1609589|title=320 Harcross Road|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}{{dead link|date=February 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Francis Crosby was the president of the Key System transportation service and owner of several small telephone companies. The design of "Le Soleil" was a collaboration of three Rockwell sisters: Mary Rockwell Hook and her partner Eric Douglas Remington were the architects; Katherine Rockwell Crosby, the owner, designed the interior, acquired the furniture and designed the French gardens, and Bertha Rockwell Venanzi, an artist living in Italy, painted floral murals in the grand ballroom. The estate has many formal rooms for entertaining with requisite kitchen and cellar rooms, a total of seven bedroom suites, and a garage for nine cars, all on a large property of several beautifully landscaped acres with a pool and tennis court.

====Siesta Key====
After purchasing {{convert|55|acre|m2}} of [[Gulf of Mexico|Gulf]]-front property on [[Siesta Key, Florida|Siesta Key]], [[Florida]] in 1935, Hook developed part of the area with her designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.louiswery.com/mary-rockwell-hook.php|title=Mary Rockwell Hook|last=Wery|first=Louis|date=|work=realty website|accessdate=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306011542/http://www.louiswery.com/mary-rockwell-hook.php|archive-date=2016-03-06|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Whispering Sands, she designed a resort hotel and vacation homes as a sanctuary for writers and artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Mary Hook brought her skill, love to Siesta|last=Bergen|first=Brooksie|date=1994-04-27|work=Sarasota Herald-Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another subdivision called Sandy Hook was intended to be a residential area for architects and incubator for the Sarasota School of Architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Sarasota School of Architecture, 1941-1966|last=Howey|first=John|publisher=MIT Press|year=1995|isbn=0262082403|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarasota_School_of_Architecture|title=Sarasota School of Architecture|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=November 2017}} In 1952, Hook developed another area called Sandy Cove&lt;ref name="iawa"/&gt;  and designed her own octagon-shaped home where she spent the last years of her life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.heraldtribune.com/news/20040104/sandy-hook-attracting-redevelopers|title=Sandy Hook attracting Redevelopers|last=Stockbridge-Pratt|first=Dorothy|date=January 4, 1952|work=Sarasota Herald -Tribune|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=6870908|title=Mary Rockwell Hook|last=|first=|date=|website=Find a Grave|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architectural innovations===

====Employing natural terrain====
Mary Rockwell Hook was the first Kansas City architect to incorporate natural formations in her designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sarasotahistoryalive.com/history/articles/siesta-key-architecture-a-natural/|title=Siesta Key Architecture a Natural|last=Muldowny|first=Lorrie|date=|website=Sarasota History Alive|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When she continued this style on [[Siesta Key, Florida|Siesta Key]], local newspaper ''[[Sarasota Herald-Tribune]]'' described Hook as "bringing the outdoors in, and many of the homes she designed on Siesta Key reflected the trend long before it became popular."&lt;ref name="iawa"/&gt;

====Solar energy====
In Siesta Key, Hook used [[solar heating|solar power]] to heat water for the resort hotel Whispering Sands as early as 1937.&lt;ref name="whmc-kc"/&gt;

====Other firsts====
Mary Rockwell Hook was the first architect in Kansas City to use [[Insulating concrete form|cast-in-place concrete]] walls. Additionally, one of her house designs was the first in Kansas City to include a private swimming pool, while another was the first to have an attached garage.&lt;ref name="iawa"/&gt;

Mary Rockwell Hook used salvaged materials in her designs as for example marble tiles salvaged from a hotel in Topeka.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kansascity.com/living/home-garden/article39350469.html|title=Mary Rockwell Hook's home blends Italian ornate with reclaimed salvage|last=Billhartz Gregorian|first=Cynthia|date=October 18, 2015|website=The Kansas City Star|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oz came to general prominence with appearances on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' beginning in 2004, and later on ''[[Larry King Live]]'' and other TV programs. In 2009, ''The Dr. Oz Show'', a daily television program focusing on medical issues and personal health, was launched by Winfrey's [[Harpo Productions]] and [[Sony Pictures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oprah.com/article/pressroom/pressrelease/20080613_orig_drozsony|title=Harpo Productions and Sony Pictures Television To Launch Dr. Oz|work=Oprah.com|date=June 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is a proponent of [[alternative medicine]], and has been criticized by physicians, government officials, and publications, including ''[[Popular Science]]'' and ''[[The New Yorker]]'', for giving non-scientific advice and promoting [[pseudoscience]]. In a Senate hearing on weight loss scams, Senator [[Claire McCaskill]] chided Oz, saying: "The scientific community is almost monolithic against you in terms of the efficacy of the three products you call miracles".&lt;ref name="USATodayMcCaskill"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2014/06/17/dr-oz-senate-panel-weight-scams/10701067/ |title=Senators scold Dr. Oz for weight-loss scams |last=Mutnick |first=Ally |date=2014-06-17 |work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 the  [[British Medical Journal]] examined over 400 medical or health recommendations from 40 episodes of his program and found that only 46% of his claims were supported by reputable research, while 15% of his claims contradicted medical research and the remainder of  Oz's advice were either vague banalities or unsupported by research.&lt;ref name="mehmetpost" /&gt;

==Early life==
Oz was born in 1960 in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], to Suna and Mustafa Öz, who had emigrated from [[Konya Province]], [[Turkey]].&lt;ref name=gma20090831&gt;{{cite news|first=Lana|last=Zak|title=Dr. Oz on Complementary Medicine: 'Challenge the Status Quo'|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/OnCall/story?id=8450292|work=Good Morning America|date = August 31, 2009|access-date= October 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Faces"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/facesofamerica/profiles/dr-mehmet-oz/4/ |title=Faces of America: Dr. Mehmet Oz |work=[[Faces of America (PBS series)|Faces of America]]'' series, with Professor [[Henry Louis Gates|Henry Louis Gates, Jr.]] |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mustafa, born in [[Bozkır]], a small town in central Turkey, earned scholarships that allowed him to emigrate to the United States as a [[Residency (medicine)|medical resident]] in 1955. Suna (née Atabay), who comes from a wealthy [[İstanbul]] family, is the daughter of a [[pharmacist]] with [[Circassians|Circassian]] ([[Shapsug]]) descent on her mother's side.

Oz appeared as a health expert on ''The Oprah Winfrey Show'' for five seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oprah.com/contributor/dr-mehmet-oz |title=Live your best Life |publisher=Oprah.com |date= |access-date= May 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His show debuted September 14, 2009. The show is co-produced by Oprah Winfrey's [[Harpo Productions]] and distributed by Sony Pictures Television. It is the second ''Oprah'' spin-off series featuring a regular guest (''[[Dr. Phil (TV series)|Dr. Phil]]'' being the first), and it marks the first time that Winfrey's company has partnered with another studio outside of the current [[CBS Television Distribution]], which co-produces her series as well as her other series. This is assumed to be because ''The Dr. Oz Show'' is in direct competition with the ''Dr. Phil'' spinoff ''[[The Doctors (talk show)|The Doctors]]'', which CBS distributes. For the first four seasons, shows were recorded in Studio 6A at [[NBC Studios (New York City)|NBC Studios]] in New York,&lt;ref name="myfoxny.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myfoxny.com/subindex/health/Dr_Oz |title=Dr. Oz&amp;nbsp;— New York News &amp;#124; NYC Breaking News |publisher=Myfoxny.com |date= |accessdate=November 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but vacated [[Rockefeller Center]] after NBC reclaimed the space for its ''[[Late Night (NBC)|Late Night]]'' franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bond|first=Paul|title=NBC Dumps $25 Million Jimmy Fallon NYC 'Tonight Show' Studio|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/jimmy-fallon-tonight-show-nbc-518867|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=September 4, 2013|date=May 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with season five, ''Dr. Oz'' originates from ABC Television Center East on the [[Upper West Side]] of [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doctoroz.com/get-show-tickets|title=Get Show Tickets!|website=www.doctoroz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the show, Oz addressed issues like Type 2 [[diabetes]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2010-02-04-Oprahdiabetes04_ST_N.htm|work=USA Today|title=Oprah Winfrey takes on a killer: type 2 diabetes|date= February 4, 2010|access-date= January 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and promoted [[resveratrol]] supplements, which he stated were anti-aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/06/15/mehmet-oz-oprah-business-media-resveratrol.html|first=Dirk|last=Smillie|work=Forbes|title=A Headache For Dr. Oz|date=16 June 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619083439/http://www.forbes.com/2009/06/15/mehmet-oz-oprah-business-media-resveratrol.html|archive-date= June 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; His ''Transplant!'' television series won both a Freddie&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreddies.com/Awards/Results.aspx?CategoryId=17&amp;Year=2006 |title=The FREDDIE Awards |publisher=Thefreddies.com |date= |access-date= May 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a Silver Telly award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tellyawards.com/winners/list/?l=L&amp;event=7&amp;category=1&amp;award=S |title=The 31st Annual TELLY Awards &amp;#124; Winners |publisher= TellyAwards.com |date= |access-date= May 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served as medical director for [[Denzel Washington]]'s ''[[John Q]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0251160/fullcredits#cast |title=John Q (2002) – Full Cast &amp; Crew | publisher = [[Internet Movie Database]] |year=2015 |access-date= February 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2011, Oz premiered as part of a weekly show on [[Oprah Winfrey Network (U.S. TV channel)|OWN]] called "Oprah's Allstars". In each episode, he, [[Suze Orman]], and [[Dr. Phil]] answer various questions about life, health and finance. He also currently does a health segment on [[1010 WINS]] titled "Your Daily Dose".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rbr.com/westwood-one-brings-dr-oz-to-wins-am-new-york/|title=Westwood One brings Dr. Oz to WINS-AM New York {{!}} Radio &amp; Television Business Report|last=cmarcucci|website=rbr.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-08|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 23, 2014, ''Surgeon Oz'', showing Oz's career as a surgeon, debuted on OWN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://decoy.tvpassport.com/news/dealing-demons-comic-book-renaissance-continues-nbc?subid=national-00001|title=Dealing with demons: Comic book renaissance|last=Warren|first=Andrew|publisher=TV Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Author===
Oz co-authored, with [[Michael F. Roizen]], six ''New York Times'' best sellers including ''You: The Owner's Manual'', ''You: The Smart Patient'', ''You: On a Diet'', ''You: Staying Young'', ''You: Being Beautiful'' as well as ''Healing from the Heart''. His book ''You: Having a Baby'' was published by Free Press in 2009. He has a regular column in ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' magazine and ''[[O, The Oprah Magazine]]'' and his article "Retool, Reboot, and Rebuild" was awarded the 2009 National Magazine Award for Personal Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.magazine.org/asme/magazine_awards/nma_winners |title=American Society of Magazine Editors – 2010 National Magazine Awards Winners Announced! |publisher=Magazine.org |date= April 22, 2010 |access-date= May 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Oz has faced criticism due to his tendency to feature non-scientific and [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] advice.

===Arsenic in apple juice===
In September 2011, Oz drew criticism for a show focusing on the alleged dangers of arsenic in apple juice. Oz hired an independent toxicology laboratory, EMSL, and found arsenic levels in some samples to be above the limit the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) allows in drinking water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doctoroz.com/videos/arsenic-apple-juice |title=Arsenic in apple juice – Dr Oz's extensive national investigation |publisher=Doctoroz.com |date= September 9, 2011 |access-date= March 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FDA said "there is currently no evidence to suggest a public health risk", and criticized the emphasis on measurements of total arsenic without distinguishing between harmless organic arsenic compounds and toxic inorganic arsenic compounds that pose differing levels of health risk.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504763_162-20106763-10391704.html "Apple juice safe despite arsenic, FDA tells Dr. Oz"].

[[ABC News]]. September 15, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doctoroz.com/videos/dr-oz-answers-your-questions-about-arsenic-apple-juice |title=Dr. Oz Answers Your Questions About Arsenic in Apple Juice &amp;#124; The Dr. Oz Show |publisher=Doctoroz.com |date= September 15, 2011 |access-date= March 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Consumer Reports]] conducted similar tests on samples of apple and grape juices around the same time. Unlike the tests done by Oz, Consumer Reports tested for both organic and inorganic types of arsenic. Results showed that 6% (5 out of 80) of the samples tested by Consumer Reports exceeded the 10-parts-per-billion (ppb) federal limit for arsenic in drinking water. When counting only inorganic arsenic, one of the 80 apple juice samples tested slightly exceeded 10-parts-per-billion limit, at 10.48 ppb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Atlantic Wire |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2011/12/dr-oz-vindicated-new-study-finds-high-arsenic-levels-in-apple-juice/249331/ |title=Dr. Oz Vindicated: New Study Finds High Arsenic Levels in Apple Juice |publisher=Theatlantic.com |date= December 1, 2011 |access-date= March 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.consumerreports.org/safety/2011/11/consumer-reports-tests-juices-for-arsenic-and-lead.html |title=Consumer Reports tests juices for arsenic and lead |publisher=Consumer Reports |date=November 30, 2011 |access-date= May 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The limits only apply to arsenic levels for drinking water; there are no legal limits for arsenic in fruit juices. After the ''Dr. Oz Show'' aired, the FDA indicated it is continuing to research the levels of arsenic in fruit juices and other foods, and may implement limits for fruit juices in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.doctoroz.com/videos/fda-statement-arsenic-apple-juice |title=FDA Statement: Arsenic in Apple Juice |author=Food and Drug Administration |date=November 29, 2011 |publisher=doctoroz.com |access-date=May 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Real Age drug marketing===
Oz is a spokesman and advisor for the website [[RealAge]].com, which ''[[The New York Times]]'' has criticized for its pharmaceutical marketing practices.  The site solicits medical information from visitors to determine a visitor's biological age and then uses the visitor's medical profile for pharmaceutical marketing purposes. As ''The Times'' reporter explained the significance of this fact: "While few people would fill out a detailed questionnaire about their health and hand it over to a drug company looking for suggestions for new medications, that is essentially what RealAge is doing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Online Age Quiz Is a Window for Drug Makers |author=Stephanie Clifford |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/26/technology/internet/26privacy.html |newspaper= [[The New York Times]] |date=March 25, 2009 |access-date=May 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reparative therapy of homosexuals===
A November 28, 2012 episode of ''[[The Dr. Oz Show]]'' was devoted to [[reparative therapy]],&lt;ref name="huff-ex-gay"&gt;{{Cite newspaper |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/29/dr-oz-reparative-ex-gay-therapy-backlash-_n_2211621.html |title=Dr. Oz's Reparative Or 'Ex-Gay' Episode Prompts Backlash From GLAAD, PFLAG And GLSEN | work = [[The Huffington Post]] | access-date= January 25, 2013|date=2012-11-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "forms of therapy that are designed to turn a gay person straight",&lt;ref name="oz-reparative"&gt;{{cite blog | url = https://blog.doctoroz.com/dr-oz-blog/reparative-therapy-controversy | date = 2012-11-28 | title = The Reparative Therapy Controversy | first = Mehmet | last = Oz | work = Dr. Oz Blog | publisher = [[Harpo, Inc.]] | accessdate = 2018-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; all of which have been directly rejected by the mainstream mental health professions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/just-the-facts.pdf | author = Just the Facts Coalition | year = 2008 | title = Just the facts about sexual orientation and youth: A primer for principals, educators, and school personnel | location = Washington, D.C. | publisher = American Psychological Association | accessdate = 2018-02-01 | page = 5 | quote = The most important fact about these "therapies" is that they are based on a view of homosexuality that has been rejected by all the major mental health professions. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The broadcast featured Julie Hamilton, a representative of the [[National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality]] (NARTH), which offers reparative therapy, and also had guests who condemned it.&lt;ref name="pr-reparative"&gt;{{cite news release | url = https://www.glaad.org/releases/lgbt-organizations-condemn-dr-oz-show-episode-so-called-reparative-therapy-ask-dr-oz-stand | date = November 28, 2012 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121203140252/https://www.glaad.org/releases/lgbt-organizations-condemn-dr-oz-show-episode-so-called-reparative-therapy-ask-dr-oz-stand | archivedate = 2012-12-03 | author1 = [[Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation]] | author2 = [[Gay, Lesbian &amp; Straight Education Network]] | author3 = [[PFLAG National]] | title = LGBT Organizations Condemn Dr. Oz Show for Episode on So-Called Reparative Therapy, Ask Dr. Oz to Stand Up for His LGBT Viewers | publisher =  Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation | location = Los Angeles }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Three of the groups who were consulted for the show &amp;mdash; [[Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation|GLAAD]], [[Gay, Lesbian &amp; Straight Education Network|GLSEN]], and [[PFLAG National]] &amp;mdash; issued a joint press release repudiating the episode just after it aired.  The press release, calling NARTH "a splinter group of anti-gay therapists/activists", criticized the episode for starting with two segments of the show featuring proponents of reparative therapy without challenge, then introducing the NARTH representative as an "expert", and providing no opinion by Dr. Oz on the subject, which the press release authors characterized as causing the audience to be "misled to believe that there are actual experts on both sides of this issue".  The press release also stated that "GLSEN would not have participated in The Dr. Oz Show had we known that NARTH would be represented".&lt;ref name="pr-reparative"/&gt;  Oz responded in a blog post, mentioning the opposition of respected medical organizations to the practice of reparative therapy, and saying that "if we want to reach everyone who might benefit from understanding the risks of this therapy, you have to present multiple perspectives."  He also said that he agreed "with the established medical consensus", that he had "not found enough published data supporting positive results with gay reparative therapy", and that he was concerned about "potentially dangerous effects when the therapy fails".  Oz also pointed out that "the guests who appeared on my show on either side of this debate agreed that entering into any therapy with guilt and self-hate is a major error."&lt;ref name="oz-reparative"/&gt;

===June 2014 Senate hearing===
During a Senate hearing on consumer protection, Senator [[Claire McCaskill]] stated that by airing segments on weight loss products that are later cited in advertisements, Oz plays a role, intentional or not, in perpetuating these scams, and that she is "concerned that you are melding medical advice, news, and entertainment in a way that harms consumers."&lt;ref name=ScamHearing&gt;{{cite web |title=Senate Sub-Committee for Commerce, Science, and Transportation Hearing on Protecting Consumers from False and Deceptive Advertising of Weight-Loss Products |url=http://www.commerce.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?p=Hearings&amp;ContentRecord_id=c1698871-3625-4f67-b0e5-a06d3bab6ca1&amp;ContentType_id=14f995b9-dfa5-407a-9d35-56cc7152a7ed&amp;Group_id=02096e14-bdcc-424b-842c-d6809f3f69c9 |date=June 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mary Engle of the [[U.S. Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) criticized Oz for calling [[green coffee extract]] "magic" and a "miracle", stating that it is difficult for consumers to listen to their inner voices when products are praised by hosts they trust.&lt;ref name="ScamHearing" /&gt;

One of the products Oz was promoting, Green Coffee Bean Extract, was found to have no weight loss benefits. Two of the researchers who were paid to write the study admitted that they could not back their data so they retracted their paper. The FTC filed a complaint that the Texas-based company Applied Food Sciences (the promoters of the study) had falsely advertised. The FTC alleged that the study was "so hopelessly flawed that no reliable conclusions could be drawn from it" so Applied Food Sciences agreed to pay a $3.5 million settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/dr-oz-endorsed-green-coffee-bean-diet-study-retracted/ |title=Dr.Oz-endorsed diet pill study was bogus, researchers admit |publisher=CBS News |date= October 20, 2014 |access-date= February 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Saunders |first=Russell |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/cheats/2014/10/20/green-coffee-bean-dr-oz-study-retracted.html |title=Dr. Oz Green Coffee Bean Study Retracted |publisher=The Daily Beast |date= 2014-10-20|access-date= February 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lack of scientific validity===
[[File:McCaskill Takes Aim at Diet Scams That Are 'A Crisis in Consumer Protection'.webm|thumb|right|Oz was heavily criticised by Senator [[Claire McCaskill]] in a hearing on consumer fraud in diet product advertising.]]
''[[Popular Science]]''&lt;ref name="PopSci"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2013-01/dr-oz-bad-science | title=Is Dr. Oz Bad For Science? | work=[[Popular Science]] | date=January 30, 2013 | access-date=March 11, 2014 | author=Lecher, Colin}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The New Yorker]]''&lt;ref name="NewYorker"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/02/04/130204fa_fact_specter | title=The Operator | work=[[The New Yorker]] | date=February 4, 2013 | access-date=March 11, 2014 | author=[[Michael Specter|Specter, Michael]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; have published critical articles on Oz for giving "non-scientific" advice. These criticisms include questioning if he is "doing more harm than good"&lt;ref name="NewYorker"/&gt; and pointing out his "irresponsible and dangerous" treatment of eating disorders.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

The [[James Randi Educational Foundation]] has awarded Oz with their [[Pigasus Award]], an award intended "to expose parapsychological, paranormal or psychic frauds that Randi has noted over the previous year."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://archive.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/article/37-static/256-pigasus-awards.html |title=Pigasus Awards |first=Jeff |last=Wagg | publisher =James Randi Educational Foundation |date=October 31, 2008 |access-date= February 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The award consists of a silver flying pig and refers to claiming something so doubtful that it will only happen "[[when pigs fly]]". Oz has been given this award on three separate occasions, more than any other recipient:

*In 2009 for the promotion of energy therapies such as [[Reiki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pigasus Awards |url=http://archive.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/928-the-2009-pigasus-awards.html |publisher=James Randi Education Foundation |date= April 2, 2010 | access-date= October 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 2010 for support of [[faith healing]] and [[mediumship|psychic communication with the dead]], among other controversial practices. Oz became the first person to receive a Pigasus Award two years in a row.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.latimes.com/health/boostershots/la-heb-dr-oz-andrew-wakefield-james-randi-awards-20110401,0,3573991.story | title=Dr. Oz, Andrew Wakefield and others, um, 'honored' by James Randi | access-date=April 2, 2011 | author=Mestel, Rosie | date=April 1, 2011 | work= [[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 2012, Oz won "The Pigasus Award for Refusal to Face Reality" for his continued promotion of "quack medical practices, paranormal belief, and pseudoscience".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Randi|first1=James|authorlink=James Randi|title=JREF's Pigasus Awards "Honors" Dubious Peddlers of "Woo" |url=http://archive.randi.org/site/index.php/jref-news/2074-jrefs-pigasus-awards-honors-dubious-peddlers-of-woo.html |publisher=James Randi Education Foundation |date= April 1, 2013 |access-date= October 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oz has also been supportive of [[homeopathy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.doctoroz.com/videos/homeopathy-starter-kit-pt-1 | title=Homeopathy Starter Kit, Pt 1 |work=[[The Dr. Oz Show]] | date=January 28, 2013 | access-date=May 22, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well, Oz's image and quotes have been used in many weight loss product [[scam]]s.  While he himself has not been found to be involved in these scams, he has made statements that were exploited by scammers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/06/17/dr-oz-gets-scolded-by-senators-over-weight-loss-scams/ |title=Dr. Oz gets scolded by senators over weight loss scams |publisher = [[Fox News]] |date=June 17, 2014 |access-date=February 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oz has stated that he is a proponent of [[alternative medicine]] and that he makes great efforts to inform viewers that he neither sells nor endorses any supplements.&lt;ref name="ScamHearing" /&gt;

A study published in the British Medical Journal on the effectiveness of Oz's medical advice found that only 46 percent of his recommendations had any scientific backing or rationale.&lt;ref name="mehmetpost"&gt;{{cite news|last1=McCoy|first1=Terrence|title=Half of Dr. Oz's medical advice is baseless or wrong, study says|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/12/19/half-of-dr-ozs-medical-advice-is-baseless-or-wrong-study-says/| work = [[The Washington Post]] |date= December 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study showed that 39 percent had no supporting scientific evidence, while the remaining 15 percentage points went directly against scientific evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Apstein|first1=Adam|title=Research confirms it: Dr. Oz dispenses a lot of medical advice with no scientific grounding|url=http://qz.com/315813/research-confirms-it-dr-oz-dispenses-a-lot-of-medical-advice-with-no-scientific-grounding/|agency=Quartz|date= December 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2015, a group of ten physicians from across the United States, including Henry Miller, a fellow in scientific philosophy and public policy at Stanford University's Hoover Institute, sent a letter to Columbia University calling Oz's faculty position  unacceptable. They accused Oz of "an egregious lack of integrity by promoting quack treatments and cures in the interest of personal financial gain".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/17/health/dr-oz-columbia-letter/ "Physicians to Columbia University: 'Dismayed' that Dr. Oz is on faculty"]. [[CNN]]. April 18, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Oz grew up in a mixed [[Muslim]] environment where his father's family practiced more traditional [[Islam]], while his mother's family were more [[secular]] Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Dr. Oz |year= 2010|title=Islam and Identity |url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/facesofamerica/video/islam-and-identity/140/ |format=Flash Video |medium= |trans_title= |publisher=PBS |location= |access-date= April 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oz identifies himself as a Muslim&lt;ref name="Business Insider"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/these-9-famous-americans-are-all-muslim-2014-10|title=9 Famous Americans You Probably Didn't Know Were Muslim |publisher=businessinsider.com |date= October 27, 2014 |access-date= April 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wfaa8"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wfaa.com/story/news/health/2014/08/10/13618098/|title=Dr. Oz: The inside story |publisher=[[WFAA|WFAA.com]] |date= August 10, 2014 |access-date= April 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and says that he has been influenced by the mysticism of [[Sufi]] Muslims from Central Turkey,&lt;ref name="theroot1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theroot.com/multimedia/meet-faces-america-dr-mehmet-oz |title=Henry Louis Gates Jr. Faces of America: Dr. Mehmet Oz |publisher=Theroot.com |date= August 19, 2010 |access-date= August 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the ideas of [[Emanuel Swedenborg]], the 18th century Swedish theologian, scientist, philosopher, revelator and mystic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Martin Gardner |last=Gardner |first=Martin |year=2010 |title=Swedenborg and Dr. Oz. |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |volume=34 |number=5 |url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/swedenborg_and_dr._oz/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spirituality-health.com/NMagazine/articles.php?id=1768 |title=Spirituality &amp; Health: Mehmet Oz Finds His Teacher |publisher=Spirituality-health.com |date= |access-date= May 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oz is a practitioner of [[Transcendental Meditation technique|transcendental meditation]]. "When I meditate, I go to that place where truth lives", he said. "I can see what reality really is, and it is so much easier to form good relationships then."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/features/tribu/ct-tribu-skube-multitasking,0,5213589.column | work=Chicago Tribune | title=Become a wizard of multitasking! | first=Daneen | last=Skube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mexican International Conference on Artificial Intelligence (MICAI)''' is the name of an annual [[Meeting|conference]] covering all areas of [[Artificial Intelligence]] (AI), held in [[Mexico]]. The first MICAI conference was held in 2000. The conference is attended every year by about two hundred of AI researchers and PhD students and 500−1000 local graduate students.

== Overview ==
MICAI is a high-level peer-reviewed international conference covering all areas of Artificial Intelligence. All editions of MICAI have been published in Springer [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] [[Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence|LNAI]] (N 1793, 2313, 2972, 3789, 4293, 4827, 5317, 5845, 6437–6438). Recent MICAI events (2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010) received over 300 submissions from over 40 countries each. The conference's scientific program includes keynote lectures, paper presentations, tutorials, panels, posters, and workshops.

The '''National Agrarian University''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Universidad Nacional Agraria'', '''UNA''') is a public university in [[Managua]], [[Nicaragua]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org.ve/docs/wrt/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2542:nicaragua&amp;catid=210&amp;Itemid=757 UNESCO: Lista de universidades en Nicaragua]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnu.edu.ni/index.php/universidades?pid=56&amp;sid=62:Universidad-Nacional-Agraria-UNA Universities members of the CNU]&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Agrarian University has its roots in the National School of Agriculture ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Escuela Nacional de Agricultura''), established on May 25, 1917. It was incorporated in 1986, by presidential decree, into the [[National Autonomous University of Nicaragua]] as the Institute of Agricultural Sciences (ISCA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.una.edu.ni/index.php/institucional/resena-historica Reseña histórica de la UNA]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, the ISCA faculty at the National University became an independent entity; the National Agrarian University, with four faculties:

* Faculty of Agronomy (FAGRO)
* Faculty of Natural Resources and Environment (FARENA)
* Faculty of Distance Education and Rural Development (FED-DR)
* Faculty of Animal Science (FACA)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1843">The '''Northern Territory Certificate of Education''' (NTCE) is the credential awarded to [[High School]] students who successfully complete senior high school level studies (years 11 and 12 or equivalent) in the [[Northern Territory]], [[Australia]].

==The NTCE structure==
NTCE is normally taught in years 11 and 12 of senior high school in the Northern Territory. There are two levels: Stage 1, generally taught in Year 11, and Stage 2, taught in Year 12. At least 22 approved units must be studied.

Each NTCE subject is organised into units, there is a list of subjects available to senior secondary students through Territory schools. Students can select up to 9 free choice units from Stage 1 and/or Stage 2 subject offerings. Each territory school can provide a list of senior subjects it offers.

Secondary students work towards the Northern Territory Certificate of Education. The [[Northern Territory Board of Studies]] issues the certificate to students who meet the requirements of achievement during their studies.

==Calculation of the Tertiary Entrance Rank==
The TER is calculated by the [[South Australian Tertiary Admissions Centre]] (SATAC) for students who successfully complete the Northern Territory Certificate of Education (NTCE) and fulfill certain other criteria to qualify for a TER.

Results for the NTCE are forwarded to SATAC by the [[Northern Territory Board of Studies]].

'''Paduka Seri Begawan Sultan Science College''' ({{Lang-ms|Maktab Sains Paduka Seri Begawan Sultan}}, abbreviated as ''MSPSBS'', or simply {{Lang|ms|Maktab Sains}}) is a selective government secondary school and [[sixth form college]] in [[Bandar Seri Begawan]], [[Brunei]]. It was founded in 1966 and is named after the 28th [[Sultan of Brunei]], the [[Omar Ali Saifuddien III|Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddien III]].

== Location ==
The school is located on Jalan Muara, close to the [[Brunei International Airport]], commercial areas and two other educational institutions - [[Berakas Secondary School]] and the [[IBTE Sultan Saiful Rijal Campus|Sultan Saiful Rijal Campus]] of the [[Institute of Brunei Technical Education]].

==History==
Paduka Seri Begawan Sultan Science College began as {{Lang|ms|Sekolah Menengah Melayu Pertama}} (First Malay Secondary School) in the then Brunei Town in 1966. Upper secondary level (Form 4) was introduced in the school in 1967 while [[sixth form]] was introduced two years later. In 1969, the school moved from Brunei Town to an area along Jalan Muara.

On 23 September 1971 the school was officially renamed as {{Lang|ms|Maktab Melayu Paduka Seri Begawan Sultan}} (Paduka Seri Begawan Sultan Malay College). It was inaugurated by the late [[Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddien III]], the 28th [[Sultan of Brunei]] and the father of the current [[Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah]].

Bilingual education policy was implemented in 1974 and English medium classes were introduced. Two years later science education was started. The school was then again renamed as {{Lang|ms|Maktab Melayu Paduka Seri Begawan Sultan/Sekolah Sains}} (Paduka Seri Begawan Sultan Malay College/Science School).

In 1985, the status of the school was upgraded to a college to acknowledge the inclusion of the sixth form and the school finally adopted the current name.

The students population of the school increased and the campus was renovated to accommodate its growing population. In 1994, the college moved to a new campus in the [[Rimba, Brunei|Rimba]] area on the outskirts of [[Bandar Seri Begawan]]. The old campus was renovated and on 2 April 2005 the college moved back to its old site and the campus in Rimba becomes [[Rimba Secondary School]]. Since 2007, the Form 1 (now known as Year 7) students were scheduled in the afternoon session due to a shortage of classrooms. In 2008, Year 8 students were also scheduled in the afternoon session. Year 7 students in 2008 were the first batch to try out the scheme of work for SPN21 (Sistem Pendidikan Negara Abad Ke-21).

==Enrolment and structure==
Entry to the college requires grade "A" in all five subjects (hence more commonly known as "5 'A's") of the Primary School Assessment ({{Lang-ms|Penilaian Sekolah Rendah}} or ''{{Abbr|PSR|Penilaian Sekolah Rendah}}''), the national examination taken at the end of Year 6 in primary school.

The school operates in a two sub-school structure. The secondary school caters for students in years 7 to 10, whilst the Sixth Form Centre caters for students in Lower and Upper Six. The school enrolls students only for Year 7 every year, prohibiting entries for other years. Only current enrolled Year 7 students are allowed to proceed to upper levels. The size of classes vary each year, depending on the entrance quotas.

==Uniform==
The school uniform for boys consists of purple pants for years 7 to 10 and grey pants for sixth form students, white MIB shirt with embroidered school logo and a black [[songkok]].

Girls' uniforms are long white and lavender checkered skirt for years 7 to 10 and long grey skirt for sixth form students, white dress and a school embroidered square [[tudong]].

Members of the student councils wear the same uniform with the exception of the colour of their pants and long skirts, which are navy blue.

A different uniform applies for physical education classes.

==Extracurricular activities==
Aside from academics, the school provides a wide range of [[extracurricular activities]] for its students. These include: Debate (Gavel Club), Da Vinci, Drama and Theatre, Environmental Club and more. This is along with Swimming, Basketball, Football, Netball, Badminton, Table Tennis, Track and Field, Golf, Rugby, Hiking and Hockey.

The school takes part in interschool competitions including Science, Mathematics, Computing, Debate, [[Hadrah]] and Nasyid competitions.

The school is also known for their notable Choir, Netball, Hockey, Track and Field team, winning several titles each year. In 2013, the unofficial school team, consisting of sixth form girls, MS Rebels came second in the First National Women's Rugby Tournament. During the early years in 1978-1980 the hockey teams and netball teams were very competitive and went to national competitions. This trend still continues today.

The school has also been known to be active in extracurricular activities including a drug awareness team. The school also has an Environmental Club to encourage students on natural awareness and for class research purposes.

The college has a [[house system]] for the purpose of the annual inter-house competitions in sports (track and field, football and netball) and arts (debate and drama). There are four houses and they are colour-coded, which consist of {{Lang|ms|Hulubalang|italic=no}} (yellow), {{Lang|ms|Laksamana|italic=no}} (blue), {{Lang|ms|Panglima|italic=no}} (red) and {{Lang|ms|Pahlawan|italic=no}} (green); they are named after the Malay traditional military ranks which mean 'Commander', 'Admiral', 'General' and 'Warrior' respectively.

==Notable Alumnae==
Several members of Brunei's royal family attended the College including the Crown Prince of Brunei, [[Al-Muhtadee Billah]], and his wife, [[Sarah, Crown Princess of Brunei|Pengiran Anak Sarah]], [[Prince Mateen of Brunei|Prince Abdul Mateen]], Princess Majeedah Nuruul Bolkiah, Princess Hafizah Sururul Bolkiah, Princess Azemah Ni'matul Bolkiah, and other members of Brunei's royal family attended the college including, Pengiran Muda ‘Abdul Qawi, Pengiran Muda Omar ‘Ali, Pengiran Muda ‘Abdul Muqtadir and Pengiran Anak Khalilah Khalilat ul-Bolkiah, sons and daughter of HRH Prince Mohammed Bolkiah,the Pengiran Anak Hajjah Siti Radhiah Bolkiah,daughter of HRH Princess Norain Bolkiah and Pengiran Anak Muhammad ‘Abdul Hafiz, Pengiran Anak Muhammad ‘Abdul Qayyum and Pengiran Anak Nurul-Amal Ni’matullah Athirah, and Pengiran Anak Nurul-Amal Munjiat ul-Athirah, sons and daughters of HRH Princess Amal Jefriah Bolkiah .

The Science College is also known to produce most of Brunei's prominent lawyers, doctors, educators, high ranking government officers, and armed personnel.

'''Prague Student Summit (PSS)''' is an educational project for high school and university students, which has more than 20 years of tradition in the Czech Republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amo.cz/en/prague-student-summit/s/15648-about/|title=About - Prague Student Summit - Association for International Affairs|website=Association for International Affairs|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through simulation of negotiations of international organizations, the participants have the opportunity to widen their knowledge in fields like international affairs, human rights, economy, cultural heritage and environment. At the same time, they can develop their rhetorical, presentation and argumentation skills. The Prague Student Summit gives the participants a unique opportunity to get a glimpse of the world of diplomacy and international relations. It is a project that endorses the idea of informal education, puts emphasis on the development of individual and this way complements the education in Czech schools.

Over the years, the format of the Prague Student Summit developed considerably; today it offers simulations of 4 key organizations: [[UN]], [[NATO]], [[EU]] and [[OSCE]]. The participants in each model defend the interests of the states they represent and negotiate in the same way as real representatives of individual countries would.  Within the agenda of individual bodies, the delegates deal with the current problems that the international community tackles.

The preparatory team that prepares the PSS every year consists of more than 60 university students, usually picked from the group of former participants of the Summit. 
The organizer of the project is '''Association for International Affairs''', a non-governmental and non-profit organization established in 1997 for the purpose of research and education in the field of international relations. 
The General partner is [[The Kellner Family Foundation]].

In the past, Prague Summit Student was taken under patronage by such personalities as [[Václav Havel]], [[Karel Schwarzenberg]], [[Petr Pithart]], [[Madeleine Albright]] or [[Kateřina Valachová]].

==Progress of the project==

The year of the Prague Student Summit is divided into two main parts – the preparatory stage and the Final conference.

During the academic year, five preparatory meetings take place at the [[University of Economics, Prague]]. Their purpose is to prepare the participants not only for the Final conference, but also to develop their expert knowledge and soft skills. Here, delegates impersonate the roles of diplomats, learn to discuss, take a stand and formulate an opinion, for which they are trying to get the support of their peers. An integral part of these preparatory meetings are lectures, panel discussions with interesting guests and interactive activities to develop the skills and abilities of the students.
[[File:Účastníci XXI. ročníku..jpg|thumb|Participants of the XXI season]]
[[File:Dopolední program přípravného setkání.jpg|thumb|Participants of the XXI season during morning programme of the preparatory meeting]]
The Final conference traditionally takes place in the spring. The Opening ceremony has been attended by guests from the project partners, diplomats, politicians and media representatives. In recent years, its venue has been, for example, the [[Prague Castle]] Ball Room, the [[Czernin Palace]], the Ambassador Hotel or the [[Hilton Prague]]. The actual negotiations take place as usual in the Prague Congress Centre. Thereby, Students have a unique occasion to meet with guests such as [[Petr Pavel]], [[Michal Horáček]], Erik Tabery and many others who have already visited the Prague Student Summit.

Among other things, the project is enriched by a wide range of accompanying events that are held throughout the year. In the past, for instance, students attended a reception in the residence of the Mayor of Prague and traveled to Brussels, Vienna, Geneva and Strasbourg on a tour of the actual seats of the simulated organizations. Before the beginning of Final conference, participants also have the opportunity to visit the embassies of states which they represent in the project.

Within the XXII season of the PSS, a new project "Prague Student Summit arrives to the regions" is organized. The aim is to show the activities of the UN Security Council to students of 8th and 9th grades of primary schools in different regions.

==Project goals==
[[File:Účastníci XXI. ročníku.jpg|thumb|Participants of the XXI season]]
The main goal of the project is to develop knowledge, skills and abilities of its participants; this applies not only to high-school and university students taking the roles of diplomats, but members of the PSS’s preparatory team as well. The project’s participant carries off new insights, perfects [[soft skills]] and forms critical and analytical thinking. The project is open to all applicants regardless their interests and career plans, for it focuses on gaining competences which can be utilized in everyday life just as in any other field of human activity.

==The Pillars of the Prague Student Summit==

===The Model UN===
[[File:Model OSN.jpg|thumb|Model UN]]
The Model of the United Nations is a project with a long tradition. More than 300 high school students represent the UN member states in its structures. Along with the new skills and knowledge the model introduces students to fundamental ideas and goals of this largest international organisation, such as the will to solve global conflict with diplomacy and pursuit of a more just International Order. 
The Model UN offers students an opportunity to experience  the world of diplomacy through a simulated negotiation in seven bodies: United Nations Security Council (UNSC) Disarmament and International Security Committee (DISEC) Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN), Human Rights Council (HRC), United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA).

===The Model NATO===
[[File:Model NATO.jpg|thumb|Model NATO]]
The Model NATO simulates the negotiation of the principal political body of the Alliance - the North Atlantic Council. It is too intended for high school students although the negotiation is run in English. That brings a new dimension to the educational activities and represents an additional challenge for delegates and the opportunity to improve their language skills. Student in a role of the member state diplomat will be occupied with the key security issues and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization´s global standing.

===The Model EU===
[[File:Model Evropské unie.jpg|thumb|Model EU]]
The Model of the European Union is designed for university students who as ministers of member states simulate sessions of the key institution in the EU structure, the Council of the European Union. Model´s goal is to show the operation of the Council as authentically as possible by updating its agenda with current topics.  Besides negotiating, the programme is constituted by discussions and seminars with prominent Czech and foreign experts, including diplomats and politicians accustomed to the EU surroundings.

===The Model OSCE===
The Model of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe is representing this year´s international model of the Prague Student Summit. Its negotiation is naturally held in English and its participants are students from all over Europe. The admission procedure will begin in January 2017.

==Chronicle==

The Chronicle, the official newspapers of Prague Student Summit, are inseparably linked to the project from its very beginning. Every year, the first edition of the Chronicle is published at the time of start of the admission process, and following editions are available at every preparatory meeting and throughout the conference days. Their electronic version is also available for download at the PSS’s website. Archive.
The Chronicle brings not only detailed coverage of activities of all Models and bodies, organizational information and information about accompanying events, but interviews with important personalities, too. Through expert columns, the newspapers provide participants with insights into the world of politics, law, economics and recent events on the field of international relations.
The editorial staff consists mainly of the project’s preparatory team members, but offers space to the participants as well.

==About organizer==

The project is prepared by students for students, with former participants usually becoming the organizers. This unique feature ensures the continuity as well as constant inflow of new ideas and approaches.
The project’s organizer is a non-governmental non-profit organization Association for International Affairs (AMO), which was founded in 1997 with an aim of research and education on the field of international relations. This leading Czech think-tank is not linked to any political party or ideology. AMO provides space for a development of education, understanding and tolerance among people and cultures and intermediates a dialogue among representatives of broad public, academic sphere, civil sector, politics and business. With its activities, it consistently supports a pro-active approach of citizens of the Czech Republic towards international politics and provides information necessary for forming one’s own opinion on both domestic and foreign events.

Brenneisen Distinguished Professor of Law, before which he was the Rice Distinguished Professor (2003–17), at the [[University of Kansas School of Law]], and has served as its Associate Dean for International and Comparative Law.&lt;ref&gt;Raj Bhala (September 2017). CV – Raj Bhala http://law.ku.edu/bhala&lt;/ref&gt; Bhala is the author of 74 articles and 13 books. BloombergQuint (India)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bloombergquint.com/&lt;/ref&gt; publishes his monthly column on international law and economics, "On Point," the first one of which appeared in January 2017, "The Trump Raj Begins … But How Will It Endure?"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bloombergquint.com/opinion/2017/01/20/the-trump-raj-begins-but-how-will-it-endure&lt;/ref&gt;

In international trade law, Bhala's ''Stare Decisis Trilogy'' was the first to highlight that, in practice, the [[doctrine of precedent]] operates in multilateral trade [[adjudication]].&lt;ref&gt;''Corus Staal BV v. United States'' DOC, 259 F.Supp. 2d 1253 (CIT 2003); "The Myth About Stare Decisis and International Trade Law (Part One of a Trilogy)", 1999, ''American University International Law Review, 14,'' 845-956; "The Precedent Setters:  De Facto Stare Decisis in WTO Adjudication (Part Two of a Trilogy)", 1999, ''Florida State University Journal of Transnational Law and Policy, 9,'' 1-151.

His ''Doha Round Trilogy'' pointed out that the detailed negotiating texts of the round had deviated from a key original purpose of the round: re-writing trade rules to help alleviate poverty, and thereby reduce the vulnerability of marginalized populations to Islamist extremist ideologies.&lt;ref&gt;Frank J. Garcia, "Doha, Security, and Justice: A Response to Prof. Raj Bhala," 2011, University of Saint Thomas Law Journal, 9, 194-213, and Robert J. Delahunty, "Trade, War, and Terror: A Reply to Bhala," 2011, University of Saint Thomas Law Journal, 9, 161-193, both reviewing the Trilogy. The Trilogy is published at: "Poverty,   Islamist Extremism, and the Debacle of Doha Round Counter-Terrorism: Part One of a Trilogy – Agricultural Tariffs and Subsidies," 2011, University of Saint Thomas Law Journal, 9, 5-160; "Poverty, Islamist Extremism, and the Debacle of Doha Round Counter-Terrorism: Part Two of a Trilogy – Non-Agricultural Market Access and Services Trade," 2011, Case Western Reserve Journal of International Law, 44, 1-81; and "Poverty, Islamist Extremism, and the Debacle of Doha Round Counter-Terrorism: Part Three of a Trilogy – Trade Remedies and Facilitation," 2012, Denver Journal of International Law and Policy, 40, 237-320.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bhala authored ''Modern GATT Law'', the first major treatise on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade since the 1970 publication of ''The Law of the GATT'' (Kenneth W.

In Islamic Law, Bhala became the first non-Muslim American law professor to produce a textbook on the subject designed for English-speaking law students, teachers, and practitioners (''Understanding Islamic Law (Shari'a)'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Callahan |first=Kim |url=http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2012/aug/19/law-professors-innovative-scholarship-puts-ku-glob |title=Law professor's innovative scholarship puts KU on global map / LJWorld.com |publisher=.ljworld.com |date=2012-08-19 |accessdate=2013-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uy91hIavLRU&lt;/ref&gt; He has spoken out against state anti-Sharia legislation, arguing it is unfair and bad for business.&lt;ref&gt;http://billtammeus.typepad.com/my_weblog/2011/09/9-1718-11.html; http://billtammeus.typepad.com/my_weblog/2011/09/9-19-11.html; KCUR 89.3 FM, KC Currents (2012-2-19), "Shariah in the Midwest," http://www.kcur.org/post/shariah-law-freedom-now-charles-ferruzza: KCUR 89.3 FM, KC Currents (2012-2-20), "Midwest Muslims Work to Change Anti-Shariah Movement," http://www.kcur.org/post/midwest-muslims-work-change-anti-shariah-movement; Marso, Andy (2012-4-15), "Lawmakers Urged to Address Sharia," TOPEKA CAPITAL-JOURNAL, http://cjonline.com/news/2012-04-14/lawmakers-urged-address-sharia - .T4pLVal2Acs.email; Marso, Andy (2012-5-25), "Brownback Signs Bill That Caused Sharia Flap," TOPEKA CAPITAL JOURNAL, http://cjonline.com/news/2012-05-25/brownback-signs-bill-caused-sharia-flap; Helen T.

Some of Bhala's research is at the intersection of International Trade and Islamic Law. One article analyzes the tariff schedules of every Islamic country in the world, and points out few such countries use the GATT Article XX(a) public morality exception to ban importation of products, such as alcohol and pork, the consumption of which the Sharia forbids.&lt;ref&gt;"Diversity within Unity: Import Laws of Islamic Countries on Ḥarām (Forbidden) Products," 2014, The International Lawyer, 47, 343-406 (with Shannon B.

Other areas of Bhala's research are the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) and Indian trade law and policy. His book ''TPP Objectively'' examines the legal, economic, and national security aspects of TPP, arguing the deal merits a grade of "B," and calls for stronger provisions to benefit women and their extension to the LGBTQ community.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.cap-press.com/books/isbn/9781611639599/TPP-Objectively-Shipping-in-August&lt;/nowiki&gt;; Mike Krings, August 6, 2016, "International Trade Law Export Authors Book on TPP, New Edition on Islamic Law," KU Today, &lt;nowiki&gt;http://news.ku.edu/2016/07/19/international-trade-law-expert-authors-book-tpp-new-edition-understanding-islamic-law&lt;/nowiki&gt;; "Trans Pacific Partnership Status," The Scholar's Circle (Radio Interview) (2015-3-15), Melissa Chirpin, "Trans Pacific Partnership Status," &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.armoudian.com/log/scholars-circle/scholars-circle-trans-pacific-trade-partnership-statu-mar-15th-2015/&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Via scholarly presentations and media appearances in India, he urged India to consider joining TPP.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OshTZNh0qg, Oval Observer Foundation, London, Professor Raj Bhala on Indian Trade Policy and Mega Regional Trade Deals, Dec. 21, 2014; (2014-3-4), What's Up with Indo-U.S. Trade Ties?, CNBC TV 18 (Mumbai, India), thefirm.moneycontrol.com/video_page.php?autono=1051631&amp;video_flag=1&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking in Riyadh at the Council of Saudi Chambers of Commerce and Harvard Alumni Association of Saudi Arabia (HASA) in April 2015, he discussed reorienting Saudi trade law and policy toward the Asia-Pacific region.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.csc.org.sa/English/News/Pages/14oom.aspx, http://www.spa.gov.sa/viewphotonews.php?id=1357858&amp;pic=, Council of Saudi Chambers, "The Kingdom and International Trade Developments:&lt;blockquote&gt; Agreements to Enhance Kingdom's Benefits from International Trade (April 2015); {{cite web|url=http://www.law.ku.edu/bhala|title=Raj Bhala &amp;#124; School of Law|date=|publisher=Law.ku.edu|accessdate=2016-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; He addressed the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) Law Association of Malaysia, and justices from the Supreme and High Courts of Malaysia, in April 2016 on the topic of ''Risks and Opportunities with the Trans-Pacific Partnership for Malaysia''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aseanlawassociation.org/index.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014, Bhala was one of over 80 Distinguished Professors in Kansas to sign a letter calling for suspension and ultimate repeal of the Social Media Policy adopted the previous month by the state's Board of Regents.&lt;ref&gt;"Dear Kansas Board of Regents" (2014-12-01), Lawrence Journal-World, page A4; Nick DeSantis (2014-10-01), "Kansas Regents Are Urged to Suspend Social-Media Policy During Review," The Chronicle of Higher Education, http://chronicle.com/blogs/ticker/kansas-regents-are-urged-to-suspend-social-media-policy-during-review/71257.&lt;/ref&gt; The letter was published simultaneously in The Lawrence Journal World, The Manhattan Mercury, and The Topeka Capital Journal.&lt;ref&gt;Phil Nel, Nine Kinds of Pie, http://www.philnel.com/2014/01/12/ksukudp/ (containing the letter as published in the Lawrence Journal World, Manhattan Mercury, and Topeka Capital Journal).&lt;/ref&gt;  The Policy attracted nationwide condemnation, including from the American Association of University Professors, (AAUP)&lt;ref&gt;"AAUP Statement on the Kansas Board of Regents Social Media Policy" (2013-20-12), http://www.aaup.org/file/KansasStatement.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; and jointly from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE), and National Coalition Against Censorship (NCAP).&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Fred Logan, Chair, Kansas Board of Regents (2013-12-20), from Will Creeley

Smith (06-01-2014), "Be Sure to Bring Your Gun," The Salina Journal, Salina.com, http://www.salina.com/editorials/Smith-column-for-Monday--Jan--6--2014.
&lt;/ref&gt;  Bhala also expressed his concern about the scope of the Policy on television.&lt;ref&gt;Craig Andres (2014-10-01), "Free Speech Battle Heats Up," KSN TV Channel 3 (NBC News, Wichita), http://www.ksn.com/news/local/free-speech-battle-heats-up.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2014, along with 80 other Distinguished Professors from across Kansas, he signed a petition in favor of a revised Policy. The revision was published widely, and widely supported, but, the Regents essentially rejected it, retaining the controversial elements concerning speech that undermines harmony at, or efficient operation of, a university.&lt;ref&gt;Llopis-Jepsin, Celia, "Faculty Remain Skeptical of Regents Social Media Policy." Topeka Capital-Journal. http://cjonline.com/news/2014-04-19/faculty-remain-skeptical-regents-social-media-policy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press (2014-04017), "Kansas Regents Stick with Social Media Policy for Universities."

In December 2014, he commented in a TV interview that the release of the U.S. Senate report on enhanced interrogation techniques (torture) by the CIA showed not only a disconnect between the myth and reality of American support for human rights, but also (ultimately) the strength of America and its commitment to the rule of law.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kmbc.com/news/ku-professor-torture-reports-release-shows-us-strength/30148362&lt;/ref&gt; In a New Zealand radio interview, Bhala spoke about the meaning of "enhanced interrogation techniques," and the lack of any justification for torture.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.95bfm.co.nz/assets/sm/219198/3/raj.mp3&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:US Navy 100416-N-5539C-006 Construction Electrician 3rd Class Jill Johnston and Lt. Col. Johnny Lizama listen to third-graders from Harry S. Truman Elementary School explain their science projects.jpg|thumb|science fair project display]]
A '''science fair''' experiment is generally a competition where contestants present their [[science project]], results in the form of a report, [[display board]], and/or models that they have created. Science fairs allow students in elementary, middle and high schools to compete in science and/or technology activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eduplace.com/science/profdev/science_fair/whatis.html|title=What is a science fair project?|last= Fredericks |first=Anthony D.|date=2000|website=Science Fair Handbook|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company|access-date=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main motive of a science fair is for students to answer a question or task, not from a textbook but found out themselves by conducting a range of experiments and ongoing research in the short amount of time allocated to them. In order that the questions or tasks spark a true interest in the student they should be able to have an interesting, eye catching project often portrayed on a [[display board]].

Science fairs also provide a mechanism for students with intense interest in the sciences to be paired with mentors from nearby colleges and universities, so that they can access to instruction and equipment that the local schools can not provide.

== History ==
Science fairs date back to 1942, when [[William Emerson Ritter]] and [[Edward W. Scripps]] created "[[The Science Talent Search]]" for high school students. 
The first American National Science Fair was won by '''Alan J. Fletcher''' when he was 18, winning with a display on the [[laws of motion]].
In the [[United States]], science fairs became popular in the early 1950s. Interest in the sciences was at a new high after the world witnessed the use of the first two [[atomic weapon]]s and the dawn of [[television]]. As the decade progressed, science stories in the news, such as [[Jonas Salk]]'s [[vaccine for polio]] and the launch of [[Sputnik]], brought science fiction to reality and attracted increasing numbers of students to fairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.streetdirectory.com/travel_guide/118515/science/a_history_of_science_fairs.html|title=A History of Science Fairs|last=Cox|first=Jimmy|date=|website=|publisher= Streetdirectory|access-date=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Science fair competitions ==
Most countries have regional science fairs in which interested students can freely participate. Winners of these regional fairs send students to national fairs such as [[ISEF]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://findafair.societyforscience.org/|title=Student Science - Find a Fair|website=findafair.societyforscience.org|access-date=2018-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Canada-Wide Science Fair|CWSF]]. National science fairs typically send winners to international fairs such as ISEF (which is a national and an international science fair) and [[EUCYS]].

{{cite news |title=`NCERT textbooks are dotted with disgraceful words, distorted history' |newspaper=Deccan Chronicle |date=3 August 2014 |url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/140803/commentary-op-ed/article/%E2%80%98ncert-books-are-dotted-disgraceful-words-distorted-history%E2%80%99 |accessdate=2014-11-14}}
&lt;/ref&gt;) is a Hindu right-wing educational activist organisation founded by [[Dinanath Batra]], a [[Pracharak]] of the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] (RSS) and the former director of its education wing [[Vidya Bharati]]. The Nyas, founded on 18 May 2007, works in collaboration with a sister organisation ''Shiksha Bachao Andolan Samiti'' (Campaign Committee for Saving Education), which was also founded by Batra.  The stated objective of the Nyas is to find and establish alternatives to the present education system in India by changing its "syllabus, system, methods and policy" in an effort to "Indianise" it, which in effect means moulding it in a [[Hindu nationalist]] framework (popularly called "[[saffronisation]]").&lt;ref name=works&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.shikshautthan.com/the-works-of-shiksha-sanskriti-utthan-nyas/ |title=The works of Shiksha Sanskriti Utthan Nyas |publisher=Shiksha Bachao Andolan Samity |accessdate=2014-11-14}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Key members ==
The key members of the Nyas include, in addition to Batra:&lt;ref name=saffronfringe&gt;
{{cite news |title=How saffron fringe is shaking the Centre |newspaper=India Today |date=7 August 2014 |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/rss-bjp-gm-crop-trials-labour-law-reform-wto-negotiations/1/376025.html |accessdate=2014-11-14}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[J. S. Rajput]], a former chairman of the [[National Council of Educational Research and Training]] (NCERT), who helped prepare a new curriculum framework,
* [[Kapil Kapoor]], a former pro-Vice Chancellor of the [[Jawaharlal Nehru University]] and a present member of the review committee for the [[University Grants Commission (India)|University Grants Commission]], who is also involved in the curriculum framework, and
* Atul Kothari, former general secretary of [[Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad]], co-convenor of ''Shiksha Bachao Andolan Samiti'' and the general secretary of the Nyas.

== Activism ==
Batra has said in July 2014 that the Nyas is focusing on seven subjects:
* "Total Development" of the child
* Character-Building
* Environmental Education
* Vedic Mathematics
* Hindi and other [[scheduled languages of India]]
* Autonomy in the field of education
* Reforms in Competitive Examinations (UPSC, SSC &amp; other)
On the matter of autonomy, the Nyas demands that there should be an all-India autonomous (non-governmental) education commission.  It has proposed a commission of 21 members called ''Bharatiya Shiksha Niti Ayog'' (Indian Commission for Educational Principles) and already recruited 9 members, with the former director of [[Central Board of Secondary Education|CBSE]] Badrinath Khandelwal among them.&lt;ref name=Batra&gt;
{{cite news |title=`It pleases me when people say we want to saffronise education' |newspaper=Rediff |date=28 July 2014 |url=http://www.rediff.com/news/interview/it-pleases-me-when-people-say-we-want-to-saffronise-education/20140728.htm |accessdate=2014-11-14}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
The Commission is mandated to "suggest corrective steps" to "indianise" the education system, according to a leader of the RSS. Observers believe that the Commission will become a rather powerful body due to the backing of the RSS, somewhat akin to the "[[National Advisory Council]]" of the [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] Party chairperson [[Sonia Gandhi]], which dictated terms to the [[United Progressive Alliance]] government.&lt;ref name=panel&gt;
{{cite news |first=Dhirendra K. |last=Jha |title=RSS sets up panel to supervise saffronisation of education |newspaper=scroll.in |date=2 August 2014 |url=http://scroll.in/article/672545/RSS-sets-up-panel-to-supervise-saffronisation-of-education/ |accessdate=2014-11-14}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 August 2014, [[India Today]] reported that Batra had met the [[Ministry of Human Resource Development (India) |Human Resource Development]] minister [[Smriti Irani]] and she promised him that the Government would soon constitute a National Education Commission.  Batra had also asked Irani to intervene when the National Curriculum Framework is changed in 2015 so that the [[NCERT]] does not continue with what he regards as a "flawed curriculum."&lt;ref name=saffronfringe/&gt; The same magazine reported in November 2014 that the minister seems to be caught between the pressure from the RSS groups and the need to deliver results, being unable to take decisions as a result.&lt;ref name=command&gt;
{{cite news |title=In command and control |newspaper=India Today |date=6 November 2014 |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/narendra-modi-bjp-smriti-irani-pmo-defence-piyush-goyal/1/399463.html |accessdate=2014-11-14}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been reported that ''Shiksha Bachao Andolan Samiti'', the sister organisation of the Nyas, will be convening a national conference in December 2014, with 200 academics and experts, to review the recommendations of the previous panels on education and identify deficiencies in the current system.  Based on these deliberations the organisation will submit a report to the Human Resource Development ministry to guide the new education policy.&lt;ref name=Sangh&gt;

'''Southwestern College''' is a four-year private [[college|higher educational institution]] affiliated with the [[United Methodist Church]] located in [[Winfield, Kansas]], United States.  It was founded in 1885 as '''Southwest Kansas Conference College''' and graduated its first class of three in June 1889. The name of the school was changed to its current form in 1909.

==History==

===Background===
The first step towards the establishment of Southwest Kansas Conference College took place in the spring of 1884 when land was [[plat]]ted for the purpose east of [[Wichita, Kansas]].&lt;ref name=Launched&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2735988/southwest_kansas_college_launching/ "Southwest Kansas College,"] ''Wichita Daily Eagle,'' vol. 1, no. 122 (Oct. 4, 1884), pg. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; With construction slated for the future, in October of that same year the principals behind the project decided to acquire a substantial residence to serve as a temporary building for the school.&lt;ref name=Launched /&gt; The Wichita home of a certain Dr. Crokey, located on the corner of Central and Topeka Avenues, was obtained for this purpose at a cost of $4,000.&lt;ref name=Launched /&gt; Initial plans called for establishment of a school with academic departments in the fields of business, music, and art.&lt;ref name=Launched /&gt;

[[File:SouthwestKansasCollege.jpg|thumb|left|300px|A 1901 newspaper advertisement for Southwest Kansas Conference College touting the school's "Christian influence."]]

The school was incorporated in [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]] on October 9, 1884, headed by a nine-member board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2736135/southwest_kansas_college_incorporated/ "State House,"] ''Topeka Daily Capital,'' vol. 6, no. 247 (Oct. 10, 1884), pg. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; No courses were conducted during the 1884-85 school year, however, and the project remained dormant.

The Southwest Kansas Conference of the [[Methodist Church]] affirmed its connection with the college project at its April 1885 annual meeting at [[El Dorado, Kansas|El Dorado]]. There the regional division of the church formally decided to establish a college within the district, selecting a committee of 7 headed by Rev. N.S. Buckner to find a suitable permanent location.&lt;ref name=Committee&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2741256/letter_to_the_great_bend_weekly_tribune/ "Letter to the Great Bend ''Inland Tribune'' from James Clayton, April 10, 1885,"] ''Inland Tribune,'' vol. 9, no. 36 (April 10, 1885), pg. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Conditions established by the committee included the availability of at least 20 acres of land and community donations of at least $15,000 towards completion of the project.&lt;ref name=Committee /&gt;

The committee's decision on siting was initially slated for a meeting to be held in Wichita on May 12, 1885.&lt;ref name=Committee /&gt; This proved to be a preliminary gathering, however, at which guidelines for bids were established and interested communities made their initial presentations.&lt;ref name=TheME&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2741345/the_methodistepiscopal_college_siting/ "The M.E. College,"] ''Wichita Daily Beacon,'' vol. 2, no. 39 (May 13, 1883), pg. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Communities making initial appeals for the siting of the college included El Dorado, [[Harper, Kansas|Harper]], [[Newton, Kansas|Newton]], [[Peabody, Kansas|Peabody]], Winfield, and Wichita.&lt;ref name=TheME /&gt; The towns of [[Hutchinson, Kansas|Hutchinson]] and [[Wellington, Kansas|Wellington]] also later made proposals.&lt;ref name=WinfieldPicked&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2744083/location_of_an_me_college_siting_of/ "Location of an M.E. College,"] Topeka ''Daily Commonwealth,'' (June 11, 1885), pg. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; A tour of visitation by Buckner's siting committee was planned.&lt;ref name=TheME /&gt;

Formal decision was rendered at a meeting held in Wichita on June 9, 1885, at which the bid of Winfield was accepted.&lt;ref name=WinfieldPicked /&gt; Winfield in its winning bid pledged $40,000 towards college construction, 20 acres of land for the campus, additional payments of $2,000 a year for ten years, and an additional 40 acres of land.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2744171/the_me_college_details_of_bidding/ "The M.E. College,"] Fort Scott ''Weekly Monitor,'' vol. 2, no. 11 (June 18, 1885), pg. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The selection of Winfield was met the next day with [[Cowley County, Kansas|Cowley County]] approving the issuance of $100,000 in [[government bond|bonds]] on behalf of the [[Denver, Memphis &amp; Atlantic Railway]] for the expeditious construction of a new railway line to the town.&lt;ref name=WinfieldPicked /&gt;

Construction of the main college building began in the fall of 1885 upon a plan designed by W.A. Ritchie, with the 4-story building anticipated to be ready for occupancy September 1, 1886, in time for the 1886-87 academic year.&lt;ref name=Building&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2744299/our_improvements_construction_of/ "Our Improvements,"] ''Winfield Tribune,'' vol. 1, no. 41 (Sept. 2, 1885), pg. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Dormitory cottages were also to be built.&lt;ref name=Building /&gt; Total cost of construction was projected at $60,000.&lt;ref name=Building /&gt; Upon completion the building was touted in the local press as "one of the finest buildings in the state."&lt;ref&gt;W.C. Barnes, Editorial in the Winfield ''Tribune,'' June 16, 1886, pg. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Launch===
In April 1886, Dr. John E. Earp, formerly head of [[DePauw University|Indiana Asbury University]], a Methodist-affiliated college in [[Greencastle, Indiana]], was tapped by the board of trustees as the first President of the Southwest Kansas Conference College.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2744377/john_earp_named_president_of_southwest/ "Local Miscellany,"] ''Newton Daily Republican,'' vol. 2, whole no. 425 (April 23, 1886), pg. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Southwest Kansas Conference College graduated its first class of 3 students on June 3, 1889.&lt;ref name=Official&gt;[http://www.sckans.edu/connecting-to-sc/history/ "Southwestern College: History,"] www.sckans.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Name change===
In 1909 the name of Southwest Kansas Conference College was changed to Southwestern College.&lt;ref name=Official /&gt;

==Southwestern College today==

===Academics===
The main campus is a laptop learning community, with laptop computers provided to all incoming students. An emphasis on service learning has led to nationally recognized programs in leadership, discipleship, and sustainability (green issues). In addition to bachelor's degrees, several master's programs give undergraduate students the option of completing a graduate degree.  Its doctoral degree in education started during the summer of 2012.

Southwestern College's professional studies programs focus on degree completion for working adults. Six professional studies sites in three states allow students to earn their bachelor's degrees  and selected master's programs in either a traditional classroom setting or online. The  ground locations are in [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]], [[McConnell Air Force Base|McConnell AFB]], [[Fort Riley, Kansas]] and [[Midwest City, Oklahoma]].

The school owns and operates radio station [[KSWC-LP]].

===Accreditation===
Southwestern College is accredited by The Higher Learning Commission and is a member of the North Central Association.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncahlc.org/component/option,com_directory/Action,ShowBasic/Itemid,184/instid,1299/lang,en/ The Higher Learning Commission] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620204158/http://ncahlc.org/component/option,com_directory/Action,ShowBasic/Itemid,184/instid,1299/lang,en/ |date=2010-06-20 }} Southwestern College (listing)&lt;/ref&gt; It is further accredited by the University Senate of the United Methodist Church and other accrediting bodies for individual majors.

=== Athletics ===
{{main article|Southwestern Moundbuilders}}
Southwestern College teams are nicknamed as the Moundbuilders. The university is a member of the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics]] (NAIA), primarily competing in the [[Kansas Collegiate Athletic Conference]] (KCAC). Men's sports include basketball, cross country, football, golf, soccer, tennis and track &amp; field; while women's sports include basketball, cheerleading, cross country, dance, golf, soccer, softball, tennis, track &amp; field and volleyball.

The Men's Track Team has won 30 consecutive conference championships, while the women have won 16 straight. Men's Cross Country has won 30 consecutive conference championships, while the women have won 4 straight and 11 of the last 14, with the school garnering 134 conference championships in nine different sports since 1960. The track teams are coached by [[Jim Helmer (coach)|Jim Helmer]] and [[Mike Kirkland (coach)|Mike Kirkland]]. The school has   had over 160 All-American scholar-athletes since 1980.

Southwestern College football players have gone on to successful coaching careers, including [[Jerry Kill]], a former head football coach at the [[University of Minnesota]].

=== "The Mound" ===
The college's nickname, "Moundbuilders," (frequently shortened to just "Builders") has inspired the creation of a large pile of rocks on the college campus, called "The Mound."  At the beginning of each school year, the "Moundbuilding Ceremony" allows students, faculty, clubs, and guests of Southwestern College to place a rock on the Mound.  Participants are invited to decorate their rocks with paint, and some are decorated quite creatively.  Although rocks are never removed from the Mound, the Mound itself was moved from the upper campus to the lower campus in the 1970s when Darbeth Fine Arts Building was built on the original site of the Mound. A major renovation in 2006 added a plaza area around the Mound with commemorative stones, benches, and landscaping.

The nickname Moundbuilders originated in 1910 when students wanted to be called something other than "Preachers" or "Methodists."  Editorialists toyed with various suggestions based on the fact that Southwestern students lived on "the hill."  The name "Cliff-dwellers" was suggested but was ultimately scrapped for "Moundbuilders" after student Harry Hart wrote that "anybody could just dwell there, but 'builders' shows action."  The Moundbuilding ceremony was instituted in 1927 by Dean Leroy Allen who said, "Nobody but Moundbuilders can build mounds.  So no other college has now, or ever is likely to have such a custom."

=== The Order of the Mound ===
The Order of the Mound is the official Honor Society for Southwestern College graduates. Although the society was formally organized in 1917, membership in the Order of the Mound includes graduates from 1889 onward. In 1927, a process was established to induct qualified graduates from years prior to 1917.

Currently, to qualify for induction, students must be in the top 10% of all graduates who have completed at least 60 graded hours or more at Southwestern College.

==Notable alumni==

The '''University Entrance Examination''' ({{lang-my|တက္ကသိုလ်ဝင်တန်း စာမေးပွဲ}}) is an academic examination administered to 10th standard students at all schools in Myanmar, including government schools, comprehensive schools and private boarding schools, for students seeking university admission. The test is administered at least 3 weeks after the Basic Education High School Examination.&lt;ref name="wde"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibe.unesco.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Publications/WDE/2010/pdf-versions/Myanmar.pdf|title=Myanmar|date=2010|work=World Data on Education|accessdate=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Test results determine the eligibility of high school students to pursue higher education, and their entrance into select universities and majors.

The current college admission system is being revised by the [[Ministry of Education (Burma)|Ministry of Education]].&lt;ref name="mtn"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mmtimes.com/index.php/special-features/207-education-2015/14534-university-application-process-to-be-reformed.html|title=University application process to be reformed|last=May Thinzar Naing|date=18 May 2015|work=Myanmar Times|accessdate=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 2015-16 academic year, students will be able to sit for entrance exams at the universities of their choice. Further, students will be allowed to retake such exams.&lt;ref name="mtn"/&gt;

==Administration==
The University Entrance Examination is administered by the [[Board of Examinations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Announcement for submitting matriculation exam applications |newspaper=The New Light of Myanmar |date=2007-09-14 |url=http://myanmargeneva.org/NLM2007/eng/9Sep/n070914.pdf |accessdate=2010-09-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110428013548/http://myanmargeneva.org/NLM2007/eng/9Sep/n070914.pdf |archive-date=2011-04-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each year, there are eleven question papers of equal format for Burmese states and regions.&lt;ref name="kirk"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kirkpatrick|first=Robert |author2=Hmone Lian Hlaing |date=29 May 2013|title=The Myanmar university entrance examination|journal=Language Testing in Asia|publisher=Springer|volume=3|issue=14|url=http://www.languagetestingasia.com/content/3/1/14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system of eleven test papers per year was adopted in 2001-02 to prevent the leakage of some questions prior to the exam administration.&lt;ref name="kirk"/&gt;

In [[Yangon]], sales of alcohol are banned during matriculation exam administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=No booze as students cram for their exams |newspaper=Myanmar Times | author=Ye Ye Htwe and Shwe Yinn Mar Oo |date=2008-03-10 |url=http://www.mmtimes.com/no409/n005.htm |accessdate=2010-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Registration==
Students from government high schools and comprehensive schools can register for the examinations internally by the guidelines of school teachers, although students from private boarding schools have to register for the exams externally themselves. Students who attend international English-language schools or other private schools are not eligible to sit for the matriculation exam, nor are they allowed to enroll in Burmese universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Burma Considers Private Education |newspaper=The Irrawaddy |date=2009-11-18 |url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=17243&amp;page=2 |accessdate=2010-09-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101005133356/http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=17243&amp;page=2 |archive-date=2010-10-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over 500,000 students take part in these exams annually, which take place in mid-March each year (for 9 days), with results released at testing sites throughout the country in June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Parents feel the stress of matriculation |newspaper=Myanmar Times |author=Min Zaw |date=2008-03-17 |url=http://www.mmtimes.com/no410/n003.htm |accessdate=2010-09-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430045116/http://www.mmtimes.com/no410/n003.htm |archive-date=2011-04-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tested subjects==
Students are administered a combination of 6 tests depending on their track: arts, science, and arts and sciences. The subjects offered are [[Burmese language|Myanmar]], [[English language|English]], Mathematics, Chemistry, Physics, Biology, History, Geography, Economics, and Optional Myanmar. Each subject examination is 3 hours long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Timetable of 2010 matriculation examination announced |newspaper=New Light of Myanmar |date=2009-12-19 |url=http://www.myanmar.com/newspaper/nlm/Dec02_19.html |accessdate=2010-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exam scores==
High marks in a subject garner a distinction known as ''gondu'' ({{my|ဂုဏ်ထူး}}). Students who achieve distinctions in five or more subjects are generally guaranteed placement in one of Myanmar's medical universities, the most selective of universities. In recent years, the combined score of students who receive 5 subject distinctions has been above 500 out of 600.  The scores of students at remote testing sites are announced via [[shortwave radio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Result of matriculation exam on air through Radio Myanmar |newspaper=New Light of Myanmar | author=Aung Shin |date=2010-06-13 |url=http://www.myanmar.com/newspaper/nlm/Jun13_03.html |accessdate=2010-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, 30% of students who participated received passing marks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Results of matriculation exams posted |newspaper=Myanmar Times | author=Aung Shin |date=2010-06-15 |url=http://www.mmtimes.com/no475/n003.htm |accessdate=2009-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pass rate in 2015 was 37.6%, a 7% increase from 2014.&lt;ref name="em"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.elevenmyanmar.com/local/number-students-pass-university-entrance-exam-distinctions-rises|title=Number of students to pass University Entrance Exam with distinctions rises|date=July 2015|work=Eleven Myanmar|accessdate=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, the national pass rate was 32.82%; the highest pass rate was in [[Mandalay Region]] (38.17%), while the lowest pass rate was in [[Chin State]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://r18h5b54hrdss7tbksbdfhgg2523f34mv.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/stats/01.pdf|title=၂၀၁၈ ခုနှစ် တက္ကသိုလ်ဝင်စာမေးပွဲ ပြည်နယ်နှင့်တိုင်းဒေသကြီးအလိုက် အောင်ချက်နှင့် ဂုဏ်ထူးဦးရေပြဇယား|last=|first=|date=|website=၂၀၁၈ - တက္ကသိုလ်ဝင် စာမေးပွဲအောင်စာရင်း|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

UA opened in 1996, after a student attending [[Anacostia]] Senior High School expressed a need for positive job experiences to UA founder Andrew Plepler.  Plepler, at that time an Attorney for the U.S. Department of Justice, was visiting the school and asked the students what they needed to succeed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theurbanalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/DCJobPartnerInfo.pdf|title=About Urban Alliance|last=|first=|date=September 2009|website=Urban Alliance|access-date=8 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plepler, with the support of Mary and [[Jeff Zients]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/advisory-boards/pmab/members/jeffrey-zients |accessdate=May 15, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120726000726/http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/advisory-boards/pmab/members/jeffrey-zients |archivedate=July 26, 2012 |title=Jeffrey Zients |website=President's Management Advisory Board}}&lt;/ref&gt; placed that student and five of his friends at internships throughout the city during 1996.  The program was developed according to the practices implemented by the National Youth Employment Coalition. Specifically, the program aims to establish long-term mentoring relationships with adults, to increases youths’ personal, academic, and financial independence, and support them to meet their increased responsibilities through workshops on [[time management]], [[financial literacy]], and [[conflict resolution]]. The group documents students’ ongoing progress by tracking each internship on a weekly basis and collecting tri-annual ratings from the mentors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theurbanalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/DCJobPartnerInfo.pdf|title=About Urban Alliance|last=|first=|date=September 2009|website=Urban Alliance|access-date=8 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program continued to work with students at Anacostia Senior High School for the next eight years, providing them with [[youth development]] and employment opportunities.  In 2005, UA expanded to recruit students at ten other [[District of Columbia Public Schools]] (DCPS) targeting DCPS seniors who were eligible for a half- day class schedule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.guidestar.org/profile/52-1938443|title=URBAN ALLIANCE FOUNDATION INC - GuideStar Profile|website=www.guidestar.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monday through Thursday, these students attend school in the morning, work at their job sites in the afternoon and on Fridays attend UA's professional development workshops.

In 2004, UA began working with the [[World Bank]]'s summer internship program.  As of 2012, that partnership has resulted in over 170 students finding placement at the World Bank.  Students work thirty-two hour weeks as well as attend weekly internship trainings developed by the Bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/dc-youth-take-on-global-development-158609945.html|title=DC Youth Take on Global Development|last=Alliance|first=The Urban|website=www.prnewswire.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  UA also works with organizations such as [[Bank of America]], Marriott, and Morgan Stanley.

In 2008, Urban Alliance expanded to work in the [[Baltimore City Public Schools]]. The organization currently works with nine Baltimore City high schools.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.baltimorecityschools.org/site/default.aspx?PageType=3&amp;ModuleInstanceID=7065&amp;ViewID=047E6BE3-6D87-4130-8424-D8E4E9ED6C2A&amp;RenderLoc=0&amp;FlexDataID=17956&amp;PageID=6776{{dead link|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2012, Urban Alliance expanded to the [[City of Chicago]]. The organization recruited students from schools such as [[Curie High School]], [[Dunbar Vocational High School]], and Crane Technical Preparatory High School.  During the 2012-2013 school year, 71 students from six Chicago public high schools participated. In 2013-2014, the program planned to include 150 students across 13 schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20130718/south-loop/michelle-obama-tells-students-envision-life-beyond-their-neighborhoods |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130721054913/http://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20130718/south-loop/michelle-obama-tells-students-envision-life-beyond-their-neighborhoods |archivedate=2013-07-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2012, UA announced a partnership with [[Venture Philanthropy Partners]] (VPP).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://theurbanalliance.org/blog/vpp-and-urban-alliance-announce-a-partnership-to-provide-career-skills-to-youth-in-northern-virginia/|title=VPP and Urban Alliance Announce a Partnership to Provide Career Skills to Youth in Northern Virginia {{!}} Urban Alliance|website=theurbanalliance.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The partnership focused on expanding the foundation's efforts into the suburban areas of Northern Virginia to work with 200 high school students and 70 alumni of the program.  UA also works with VPP's youthCONNECT initiative.

The organization that became the Watkinson School has its origins in a major bequest of businessman and philanthropist David Watkinson (1778-1857), whose will included provisions for establishing a school for troubled boys.  Originally led by noted Hartford educator [[Henry Barnard]], school trustees built Watkinson's bequest to over $200,000 by 1880.  In that year, a farm was purchased on Park Street, and the institution was opened as a school and working farm known as the '''Watkinson Juvenile Asylum and Farm School'''.  In 1892, under the leadership of Rev. Francis Goodwin, the school leased land on the Prosser Farm at the corner of Albany Street and Bloomfield Avenue, which had been purchased by Goodwin for the Handicraft School, an organization whose leadership was identical to that of the Watkinson School.  The Watkinson School facilities were built on this land at the northern end, while those of the Handicraft School were located in its south.  The land occupied by the Watkinson School was formally transferred to the school in 1949.  The school formally adopted the name "Watkinson School" in 1923.&lt;ref name=NRHP/&gt;

The school campus is located at 140, 180, and 190 Bloomfield Avenue in [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]] and [[West Hartford, Connecticut|West Hartford]].  The complex consists of nine buildings on about {{convert|36|acre|ha}}, most of which (including all of the buildings) is in Hartford.  Feringa Hall is the oldest academic building on the campus, built in 1894-5 to a Queen Anne design attributed to Francis Goodwin.  Residence houses, originally for the headmaster and his assistant, date to the early 20th century.  Frances Goodwin Hall is a two-story brick classroom building with attached gymnasium, built in 1924.&lt;ref name=NRHP&gt;{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=95000273}}|title=NRHP nomination for Watkinson Juvenile Asylum and Farm School|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2014-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The campus was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1995.&lt;ref name=nris/&gt;

'''''Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail'''''&amp;nbsp;is a 2012 memoir by [[Americans|American]] author [[Cheryl Strayed]], describing her 1,100-mile hike on the [[Pacific Crest Trail]] in 1995 as a [[journey of self-discovery]]. The book reached No. 1 on the [[New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Seller list]], and was the first selection for [[Oprah's Book Club 2.0]].

The [[Wild (2014 film)|film adaptation]] was released in December 2014.

== Plot ==
''Wild'' is Cheryl Strayed's memoir of her 1,100 mile solo hike along the [[Pacific Crest Trail]], beginning in the [[Mojave Desert]] and hiking through California and Oregon to the [[Bridge of the Gods (modern structure)|Bridge of the Gods]] into Washington. The book also contains flashbacks to prior life occurrences that led her to begin her journey.&lt;ref name=nyt2&gt;{{cite news|last=Shapiro |first=Dani |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/01/books/review/wild-a-hiking-memoir-by-cheryl-strayed.html |title=The High Road / Wild, a Hiking Memoir by Cheryl Strayed |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2012-03-30 |accessdate=2012-12-24}} [https://www.webcitation.org/6ByjZMzMY WebCite archive].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Oprah201204&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oprah.com/spirit/Wild-by-Cheryl-Strayed-Cheryl-Strayed-Interview  |title=Cheryl Strayed Hikes Her Way Through Heartbreak in ''Wild'' |publisher=Oprah.com (April 2012 issue of ''O, The Oprah Magazine'') |date=March 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324092418/http://www.oprah.com/spirit/Wild-by-Cheryl-Strayed-Cheryl-Strayed-Interview |archivedate=March 24, 2012 |deadurl=no }}  (Originally titled "Inward Bound: Hiking Her Way Through Heartbreak").&lt;/ref&gt;

At age 22, Strayed had been devastated by the lung cancer death of her mother at 45. Her stepfather disengaged from Strayed's family, and her brother and sister remained distant. Strayed and her husband divorced, and eventually a lover convinced her to start using [[heroin]].&lt;ref name=nyt2/&gt;

Seeking self-discovery and resolution of her enduring grief and personal challenges, at age 26, Strayed set out on her journey, alone and with no prior hiking experience. ''Wild'' intertwines the stories of Strayed's life before and during the journey, describing her physical challenges and spiritual realizations while on the trail.&lt;ref name=nyt2/&gt;

By the time the book was published, actress [[Reese Witherspoon]]'s film company, Pacific Standard, had optioned ''Wild'' for film rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hallett |first=Alison |url=http://blogtown.portlandmercury.com/BlogtownPDX/archives/2012/03/15/cheryl-strayeds-wild-optioned-by-reese-witherspoon |title=Cheryl Strayed's Wild Optioned by Reese Witherspoon &amp;#124; Blogtown, PDX |publisher=Blogtown.portlandmercury.com |date=2012-03-15 |accessdate=2012-12-24}} [https://www.webcitation.org/6C3xEmHlC WebCite archive].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Reese Witherspoon Set For Nick Hornby’s Book Adaptation ‘Wild’ For Fox Searchlight|url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/07/reese-witherspoon-to-star-in-wild-book-adaptation-for-fox-searchlight/|accessdate=2013-07-17 |newspaper=deadline.com |date=2013-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Witherspoon portrayed Strayed in the 2014 film ''[[Wild (2014 film)|Wild]],'' which was written by [[Nick Hornby]] and directed by [[Jean-Marc Vallée]].

==Reception==
In ''[[The New York Times]],'' [[Dwight Garner (critic)|Dwight Garner]] wrote that "the lack of ease in (Strayed's) life made her fierce and funny; she hammers home her hard-won sentences like a box of nails," adding that the memoir reflected a "too infrequent sight: that of a writer finding her voice, and sustaining it, right in front of your eyes."&lt;ref name=NYTimes20120327&gt;{{cite web |last=Garner |first=Dwight |title=The Tracks of an Author’s, and a Reader’s Tears / ‘Wild’ by Cheryl Strayed, a Walkabout of Reinvention |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/28/books/wild-by-cheryl-strayed-a-walkabout-of-reinvention.html?pagewanted=all |website=The New York Times |archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/6VACbFGO1 |archivedate=December 28, 2014 |date=March 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In ''[[The New York Times]],'' [[Dani Shapiro]] called the book "spectacular... at once a breathtaking adventure tale and a profound meditation on the nature of grief and survival, ... both a literary and human triumph."&lt;ref name=NYTimes20120330/&gt; Shapiro wrote that unlike many parallel-arc stories, Strayed's two parallel narratives—the challenging hike itself and the difficult life events that preceded it—are delivered in perfect balance.&lt;ref name=NYTimes20120330/&gt; According to Shapiro, the memoir did not overdramatize its events, but followed a "powerful, yet understated, imperative to understand (their) meaning," allowing readers "to feel how her actions and her internal struggles intertwine, and appreciate the lessons she finds embedded in the natural world."&lt;ref name=NYTimes20120330&gt;{{cite web |last=Shapiro |first=Dani |title=The High Road / ‘Wild,’ a Hiking Memoir by Cheryl Strayed |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/01/books/review/wild-a-hiking-memoir-by-cheryl-strayed.html?pagewanted=all |website=The New York Times |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6VAEfncFp |archivedate=December 28, 2014 |date=March 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]],'' Melanie Rehak began by contrasting ''Wild'' with the 2006 memoir ''[[Eat, Pray, Love]]''—whose story was "pleasant, mild, romantic, and completely lacking urgency" and in which everything would work out.&lt;ref name=Slate20120303/&gt; In contrast, ''Wild'' was said to be "crammed with... passages of vicious discomfort" and was carried by a voice that was "fierce, billowing with energy, precise."&lt;ref name=Slate20120303/&gt; Crediting the years that passed between Strayed's 1995 hike and her 2012 memoir, Rehak wrote that Strayed had "fine control" over "unfathomable, enormous experiences" and never wrote "from a place of desperation in the kind of semi-edited purge state that has marred so many true stories."&lt;ref name=Slate20120303&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rehak |first1=Melanie |title=Trail of Tears |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/books/2012/03/cheryl_strayed_s_wild_reviewed_.single.html |publisher=''Slate'' |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303181008/http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/books/2012/03/cheryl_strayed_s_wild_reviewed_.single.html |archivedate=March 3, 2012 |date=March 3, 2012 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Formal education for women in Iran began in 1907 with the establishment of the first primary school for girls.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Esfehani|first=qouhi|date=2014|title=Iranian Women: One Step Forward, Two Steps Back|url=|journal=Middle Eastern Studies / Ortadogu Etütleri|volume=5|issue=2|pages=36, 38, 39, 40|doi=|pmid=|ref=qouhi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Education held an important role in Iranian society, especially as the nation began a period of modernization under the authority of [[Reza Shah|Reza Shah Pahlavi]] in the early 20th century when the number of women's schools began to grow. By mid-century, legal reforms granting women the right to vote and raising the minimum age for marriage offered more opportunities for women to pursue education outside the home.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After periods of imposed restrictions, women's educational attainment continued its rise through the Islamification of education following the Iranian Revolution of 1979, peaking in the years following radical changes in the curriculum and composition of classrooms.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mehran|first=Golnar|date=2003-08-01|title=The Paradox of Tradition and Modernity in Female Education in the Islamic Republic of Iran|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/378248|journal=Comparative Education Review|volume=47|issue=3|pages=269–286|doi=10.1086/378248|issn=0010-4086}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1989, women dominated the entrance examinations for college attendance.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;

Women's participation in education has not slowed despite efforts to impose restrictions on the increasingly female-dominated educational sphere. The changes in women's education have split into increased usage and dominance of the opportunities available to women, and the imposition of strict requirements governing their role in education, including gender-segregated classes, Islamic dress, and the channeling of women into "feminine" majors that prevent the pursuit of certain careers.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== History of education for women in Iran ==

The nature of education for Iranian women changed significantly from the period leading up to the Iranian Revolution when compared to the imposition of restrictions following it. Despite the various obstacles for women entering an educational setting, they manage to comprise the majority of college attendees and outperform their male peers on university admissions tests as well as in graduation rates.

=== Pre-Iranian Revolution ===

At the beginning of the 20th century education for women expanded slowly, with enrollment of female students in the 1922 academic year totaling just over 7200 students compared with 35,000 of their male peers.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Iravani|first=Mohammad Reza|date=2011|title=Women's Education, Employment and Unemployment in Iran|url=|journal=J. Basic. Appl. Sci. Res.|volume=1|pages=2965–2970|doi=|pmid=|number=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935, women first experienced the secularization of Iran's educational system when the University of Tehran was established.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; As the nation's secularization created demand for professionally trained students, women were encouraged to attend schools. Education became a social norm and a marker of achievement in Iranian society.

On the eve of the Iranian Revolution, in 1976-77, 40 percent of secondary school enrollment was female.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These numbers largely reflect the upper echelon of Iranian society, as women who were a part of an ethnic minority or from rural areas of Iran were largely excluded from these educational reforms.

=== Education from Iranian Revolution, 1979-1989 ===

The [[Iranian Revolution]] of March 1979 ushered in a period of conservative leadership that altered the role and conception of the new model female in Iranian society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The period was characterized by the retraction of previously passed laws reforming women's status in the home, and the institution in its place of family and civil law based in notions of patriarchy.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rezai-Rashti|first=Goli M.|last2=Moghadam|first2=Valentine M.|date=2011-10-13|title=Women and higher education in Iran: What are the implications for employment and the "marriage market"?|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11159-011-9217-9|journal=International Review of Education|language=en|volume=57|issue=3–4|pages=419–441|doi=10.1007/s11159-011-9217-9|issn=0020-8566}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The newly enacted [[Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran]] stated the importance of women's economic and social well-being, yet did not guarantee the right to educational opportunities.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Instead, the new regime of religious authority cracked down on women's participation in education, barring coeducation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Immediately following the Revolution, universities and many high schools were shut down, not to be reopened for another 3 years. During this time many female faculty were excused from their positions and many women lost their jobs. This included all female judges as well as women who held positions of authority in the government.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Upon reopening of schools and under the leadership of [[Ruhollah Khomeini|Ayatollah Khomein&lt;nowiki/&gt;i]], educational curriculum was altered to reflect a new focus on Islamic values. Women were depicted wearing a veil in textbooks, appearing in social studies books as managers of the home and offering guidance on Islam and schoolwork. Men were depicted as providers for the family's needs.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Some women did appear in pursuit of farming or factory work, working in hospitals and in schools in these textbooks, mostly in conformity with a gender stereotype of feminine work.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Because of this, Iran became a sexist place. 
[[File:Pmiokl.jpg|thumb|Iranian women taking the university entrance exam.|alt=Women sitting for the Konkur, the university entrance exam]]
Textbooks and curriculum remained uniform across genders, though the Ministry of Education's "Study of Professions" textbooks differentiated between "male" and "female" specializations and were distributed according to gender.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 1982, gender stereotyped work was institutionalized by the Ministry of Education's introduction of ''KAr va Danesh'', an experiential cooperative day in which students were excused from school to work in various occupations. For females, these experiences consisted of workshops focused on topics such as nutrition, child rearing, cooking, and health.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Course restrictions in higher education also began under the authority of [[Ruhollah Khomeini|Religious leader Khomeini]], in which men and women were each barred from studying certain majors. Women were excluded from studying veterinary science, animal husbandry, geology, and natural resources, while men were precluded from subjects such as fashion design, obstetrics, and mid-wifery.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; Of 108 mathematics and computer science majors, women were only permitted to study 43. The government also established quotas for certain specializations, capping the number of women who could pursue specified majors to ensure against the domination of women in these subjects.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; To comply with the segregation of sexes in schooling and employment, the segregation of subjects led to the founding of a women's only medical school so that female patients could seek treatment from a female physician.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Out of fear that single women may be corrupted by external society, state scholarships to study abroad were also restricted, offered to male students and married women only.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The "Sponsorship for Foreign Students Act" additionally required that married women who received the scholarship be accompanied by their husbands.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Beginning in 1980, female faculty and students were directed to wear Islamic dress by the Ministry of Education. The institution of veiling throughout Iran in 1981 extended the compulsion to women beginning at 6 years of age. At this time many schools limited teachers to instruct only same-gendered students.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;

=== Khomeini to Khatami, 1989-2005 ===

In 1989, the First Economic, Social, and Cultural Development Plan of the Islamic Republic of Iran, 1989-1993, offered improvement in women's educational opportunities and involvement in social and economic life as key targets for the incoming administration.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Following the death of Khomeini in 1989, President [[Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani|Rafsanjani]] began a process of scaling back restrictions on women's education.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Hurdles to education still existed, with the majority of Iranian women married by the age of 19 at the start of the 1990s.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The situation was more dire for rural female students, with half of female Iranians living outside urban areas remaining uneducated.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Progress began to be made toward alleviating some of these restrictions in the 1990s. Quotas restricting the number of women who could study particular fields were eliminated while the Women's Cultural and Social Council, an institution headed by Iranian women who held influential positions in Iran, began studying the effects continued restrictions had on the Iranian economy. This led to a lifting of all remaining quotas or bans on studying particular fields, completed in 1993.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; By the 1990s many of the restrictions imposed on majors were also lifted, offering women more opportunities to pursue a degree in fields such as veterinary science that were banned under the Khomeini government. More women beyond the few, urban elite that initially enrolled in higher education began to attend school under its Islamic form, no longer hesitant about sending their children to institutions taught by men.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;

Educational opportunities continued through the rule of [[Mohammad Khatami]], who served as President of Iran from 1997-2005. Khatami viewed the home as the proper setting for an Iranian woman, yet did not seek to exclude her from participation in the public sphere.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Noting the increasing dominance of women in higher education, Khatami stated that though the increase was concerning, he did not wish to create obstacles in order to reduce this participation.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Khatami called for an opening of majors and specialities for women in universities and an end to the quota system.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

At the beginning of Khatami's presidency, over 95 percent girls in Iran attended elementary school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women and Politics in the Islamic Republic of Iran: Action and Reaction|last=Vakil|first=Sanam|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA|year=2011|isbn=1441105166|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997-98, 38.2 percent of Iranian women enrolled in higher education.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women, Power and Politics in 21st Century Iran|last=Povey|first=Tara|last2=Rostami-Povey|first2=Elaheh|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|year=2012|isbn=1409402053|location=|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; This number rose to 47.2 percent by 2000.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; As female enrollment in schooling continued to climb, the segregation of the sexes in academic specialization continued to persist through the end of the 1990s. In the 1998-99 academic year, males dominated enrollment in math-physics and technical fields with 58 and 71 percent  of the enrolled class of secondary school students. Women disproportionately comprised the humanities and experimental sciences field with 61 percent  enrollment.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Gender specialization continued through university level where the fields of basic sciences, medical sciences, and arts were studied by a majority of women, and agriculture and veterinary science, engineering, and humanities were pursued mostly by men.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Overall, however, the decade was characterized by a three-fold increase in female enrollment in higher education.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kurzman|first=Charles|date=2008-01-01|title=A Feminist Generation in Iran?|jstor=25597464|journal=Iranian Studies|volume=41|issue=3|pages=297–321|doi=10.1080/00210860801981260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the turn of the 21st century the government continued to scale back restrictions. By 2000, the government supported the establishment of a Women's Studies course to be offered for graduate level study of topics including [[Women's rights in Iran|women's rights]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; A 2001 report on women's status in Iran published by his office emphasized the goal of improving educational materials for women to reflect their modern role in society, including the counseling of high school students toward specializations that were traditionally dominated by men.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 2001, the government also authorized the use of the "Sponsorship for Foreign Students Act" supplement for single women to study abroad, a change from the former restriction. Single women could avail themselves of the funds to pursue higher education in foreign institutions, with the consent of their fathers.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 2001 is also the year that female enrollment in university-level education exceeded that of men, showing their continued dominance of education.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The statistics of the Khatami presidency show the slow rise of female participation in education. In 2002, women dominated the results of its national college entrance examination, comprising 62 percent  of passing students.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shavarini|first=Mitra K.|date=2005-01-01|title=The Feminisation of Iranian Higher Education|jstor=25054545|journal=International Review of Education / Internationale Zeitschrift für Erziehungswissenschaft / Revue Internationale de l'Education|volume=51|issue=4|pages=329–347, 331, 333, 334, 335}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women pursuing teaching positions in higher education also made gains during this period, holding nearly half of all assistant professorships at universities, nearly double that held a decade before.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The number of women accepted into tenured-track and full-time professorships in 2001-02 remained low at 17.3 percent as it was not nearly as proportionate to the number of educated women in Iranian society.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Ahmadinejad Era, 2005-2013 ===

Many of the reforms achieved earlier in Rasfanjani and Khatami's presidencies were eroded with the election of [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] in 2005. In 2006, the average woman in Iran attended school for nine years.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; At the start of his presidency in 2007-08, women's gains in education permeated every level, composing 44 percent of students pursuing associate degrees, 55 percent of bachelor's degree students, 43 percent of master's degree students, and a high 58 percent of students pursuing a professional doctorate.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mehran|first=Golnar|date=2009-01-01|title="Doing And Undoing Gender": Female Higher Education In The Islamic Republic Of Iran|jstor=40608077|journal=International Review of Education / Internationale Zeitschrift für Erziehungswissenschaft / Revue Internationale de l'Education|volume=55|issue=5/6|pages=541–559|doi=10.1007/s11159-009-9145-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women also dominated 6 of the 7 academic fields offered at university level, save for engineering, comprising the majority of students studying veterinary sciences, basic sciences, human sciences, medical sciences, agriculture and the arts.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

With the former rise of participation by women in education and the reduction of artificially created obstacles to their success in pursuing studies, conservative forces in the Iranian government became alarmed at the erosion of traditional notions of women's role in the home and the competition in the labor market with educated men for whom work outside the home was essential.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The government took action, with Ahmadinejad appointing a religious cleric as the Chancellor of the secular [[University of Tehran|Tehran University]] in November 2005.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Razavi|first=Reza|date=2009-01-01|title=The Cultural Revolution in Iran, with Close Regard to the Universities, and its Impact on the Student Movement|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00263200802547586|journal=Middle Eastern Studies|volume=45|issue=1|pages=1–17|doi=10.1080/00263200802547586|issn=0026-3206}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the Ministry of Health and Education imposed a quota system on particular majors and specialities and restricted enrollment of women to universities located in their hometowns.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; It also instituted the gender segregation of higher education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Power, Islam, and Political Elite in Iran. A Study on the Iranian Political Elite from Khomeini to Ahmadinejad|last=Rakel|first=Eva|publisher=BRILL|year=2008|isbn=9047425081|location=|pages=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The response from students to what was perceived as the attempt to turn secular universities into religious institutions were protests demanding the preservation of civil liberties, such as the freedom of speech. Conservative politicians demanded, in turn, a crackdown on the "westernization" of secular education and an imposition of Islamic philosophy. The [[Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei|Supreme Leader]]'s spokesman for higher education, Hojatoleslam Mohammadian, and the Minister of Science and Higher Education, [[Mohammad Mehdi Zahedi]], both called for the Islamization of universities, while Mohammadian also stated his opposition to women pursuing certain studies in higher education.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

In 2009 Ahmadinejad's pursuit of the further de-feminization of education led to the establishment of the "Special Council for the Development and Promotion of Humanities."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Iran's [[Supreme Council of the Cultural Revolution]] oversaw this effort, in which seven appointees were responsible for infusing humanities discipline with Islamic principles.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== 2010-11 Restrictions ====

In 2010, Iran again adopted a quota system to limit the number of women able to enter university education.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cit journal|last=Haeri|first=Shahla|date=May 1, 2013|title=Comparative And International Perspectives On The 'End Of Men': No End In Sight: Politics, Paradox, And Gender Policies In Iran|url=|journal=Boston University Law Review|volume=93|page=1049|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Iran imposed restrictions on a dozen social studies courses, including women's studies and human rights, on the grounds that "The content of the current courses in the 12 subjects is not in harmony with religious fundamentals and they are based on Western schools of thought."&lt;ref name="AP4"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3974198,00.html|title=Iran restricts social sciences seen as 'Western'|first=Associated Press|date=24 October 2010|newspaper=Associated Press|accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, universities began to announce new restrictions on entry to female students. Whereas previously students who scored highest on the previously gender-neutral university entrance exam, the ''Konkur'', were placed in the best university programs across the country, universities now barred females from enrollment in over 70 specializations.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;  The practical result was to concentrate more women in local universities closer to their homes, and farther from the urban, more secular universities they were otherwise qualified to attend.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

===== January 2011 Allameh Tabatabai University announcement =====
In January 2011, the president of [[Allameh Tabatabai University]] in [[Tehran]], [[Sadreddin Shariati]], announced that subjects with large numbers of students would be split by gender. Prior to this, university libraries and canteens were already segregated. It was claimed that the Iranian public had already been requesting gender segregation in education in some highly religious areas and in the capital; also, such segregation was said to already be in progress in a number of other Iranian universities. Senior cleric [[Hojatoleslam Mohammad Mohamadian]] pushed for segregated classes in 2006, and again in 2009; other governmental requests to allow segregation date back over 15 years.&lt;ref name="UWN1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20110204224833806|title=IRAN: Growing separation of genders in universities|author1=Sharma, Yojana  |author2=Raeis, Shaya |lastauthoramp=yes |date=6 February 2011|newspaper=University World News|accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== August 2012 Course Ban ====
{{POV|date=May 2016}}
On 20 August 2012, an announcement was made by Iran's [[Ministry of Science, Research and Technology (Iran)|Ministry of Science, Research and Technology]] that 36 universities in [[Iran]] would be cutting 77 fields of study from the female curriculum, making them male-only fields. The fields chosen include most sciences and engineering, among others. The curriculum change was set to be implemented for the 2013 school year and the fields of study limitations for women have been added to the university "leaflets".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rt.com/news/iran-women-university-ban-171/|title=Male-order education: Iran bars women from 77 university courses|date=21 August 2012|newspaper=[[RT (TV network)|Russia Today]]|author=[[Staff writer]]|accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Universities like the [[Oil Industry University]] have completely barred women from attending, citing the "lack of employer demand".&lt;ref name="hdn22"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/iran-bans-women-from-77-university-majors-including-engineering-physics-.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=28325&amp;NewsCatID=352|title=Iran bans women from 77 university majors, including engineering, physics|date=22 August 2012|newspaper=[[Hurriyet Daily News]]|location=Istanbul|author=[[Staff writer]]|accessdate=22 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The announcement came soon after the release of statistics showing that women were graduating in far higher numbers than men from Iranian universities and were scoring overall better than men, especially in the sciences.&lt;ref name="Telegraph2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iran/9487761/Anger-as-Iran-bans-women-from-universities.html|title=Anger as Iran bans women from universities|date=20 August 2012|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=August 24, 2012|author=Tait, Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This reasoning was echoed by [[Isfahan University]], which stated that from those that obtained mining engineering degrees "98 percent  of female graduates ended up jobless."&lt;ref name="Telegraph2"/&gt; The disciplines related to agriculture were also regarded as "unfit" for female students.&lt;ref name="hdn22" /&gt; Therefore, as a consequence of this move, women may not become engineers, nuclear physicists, archaeologists, business graduates and computer scientists in Iran.&lt;ref name="hdn22" /&gt; Additionally, they are also banned from attending the departments of English literature, translation and hotel management.&lt;ref name="hdn22" /&gt; Another reason given was that because of a shortage of available female dormitories, attendance had to be lowered. A comparison was made, however, to the fact that [[nursing]] was made a female-only degree in the same announcement.&lt;ref name="LAT2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/world_now/2012/08/iranian-universities-female-students.html|title=Iranian universities shut female students out of dozens of fields|date=20 August 2012|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|author1=Ramin Mostaghim  |author2=Emily Alpert |lastauthoramp=yes |accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The possibility of fields of study restrictions was first reported by the [[Mehr News Agency]] on 6 August 2012. The news followed the release of the year's entrance exam scores, showing that 60 percent  of university attendees are women,&lt;ref name="NYT2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/20/world/middleeast/20iht-educbriefs20.html?_r=1|title=Universities in Iran Put Limits on Women's Options|date=20 August 2012|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|author=Zakiyyah Wahab|accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with test scores of the past few years showing women largely outperforming men. This included 52 percent  of university graduates and 68 percent  of science degree graduates being women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-21/iran-barring-women-from-atomic-oil-fields-draws-rebuke.html|title=Iran Barring Women From Atomic, Oil Fields Draws Rebuke|date=21 August 2012|newspaper=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]|author=Jonathan Tirone|accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These results have caused concern among the senior clerics of the country, who became worried about the "social side-effects of rising educational standards among women, including declining birth and marriage rates".&lt;ref name="Telegraph2"/&gt;

[[Amnesty International]] reported that in April 2012, university security personnel at the Roudehen Branch of Islamic [[Azad University]] beat female students who were not complying with [[hijab]] (Islamic dress) standards.&lt;ref name="AI1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde13/033/2012/en/|title=Amnesty International Joint Public Statement|first=Amnesty International|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also claimed reports of quotas restricting women’s admission to specific university programs ("designed to reduce women’s access to specific fields of study") implemented by the [[Ministry of Science, Research and Technology (Iran)|Ministry of Science, Research and Technology]]. Such restrictions on women’s educational choices were said to violate the prohibition on discrimination and Iran’s obligations under [[international law]].&lt;ref name="AI1" /&gt;

===== Responses =====
[[Seyed Abolfazl Hassani]], a senior Iranian education official, stated in defense of the announcement that, "Some fields are not very suitable for women’s nature, such as agricultural machinery or mining, partly because of the hard work involved in them."&lt;ref name="LAT2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT2"/&gt; The policy change was criticized by some Iranian parliamentarians, such as [[Mohammad-Mehdi Zahedi]], head of the Iranian parliament’s education and research committee. However, [[Kamran Daneshjoo]], the science and higher education minister, gave a "guarded response" to the news, saying that the universities would have to state a reason, but also supported the change by explaining that "90 percent  of degrees remain open to both sexes and that single-gender courses were needed to create 'balance'." Zahedi said in response that Daneshjoo is "expected to present himself to parliament to explain this policy".&lt;ref name="Telegraph2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theinternational.org/articles/235-tensions-in-the-iranian-leadership-over-e|title=Tensions in the Iranian Leadership Over Excluding Women from Universities|date=August 27, 2012|newspaper=The International|author=[[Staff writer]]|accessdate=August 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iranian [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winner and human rights activist [[Shirin Ebadi]] wrote to the [[United Nations]] in protest of the restrictions, stating that the Iranian government is "trying to limit the active presence of women in society". She has asked for the issue to be added to "Iran's human rights dossier". The letter was then forwarded to UN special rapporteur for Iran Ahmad Shaheed and to the UN [[High Commissioner for Human Rights]] [[Navanethem Pillay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.payvand.com/news/12/aug/1176.html|title=Nobel laureate calls on UN to protect Iranian women|date=21 August 2012|newspaper=[[Radio Zamaneh]]|author=Staff writer|accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ebadi also added that the purpose of this policy change is to reduce the number of female university attendees to below 50 percent, down from the current 65 percent .&lt;ref name="Telegraph2" /&gt; On 22 September 2012, [[Human Rights Watch]] urged Iran to reverse the new policy, claiming that such restrictions are a violation of the international right to education for everyone without discrimination.&lt;ref name="CT12"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/sns-rt-us-iran-womenbre88l03l-20120922,0,6158083.story|title=Lift restrictions on women's education, rights group tells Iran|last=Torbati|first=Yeganeh|date=22 September 2012|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=22 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rouhani Era, 2013-Present ===
When [[Hassan Rouhani]] took control of the Presidency in 2013, there was hope that he would usher in a radical shift in Iranian society toward equal women's rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/11/17/hassan-rouhanis-womens-rights-conundrum/|title=Hassan Rouhani’s Women’s Rights Conundrum|last=Esfandiari|first=Haleh|date=17 November 2015|work=|access-date=|via=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hopes that he would scale back quota use and institute more lenient reforms have not been fully realized, with the [[United Nations Special Rapporteur|UN Special Rapporteur]] noting in a 2015 report that significant discrimination against women still persists in the political and economic spheres, overshadowing the gains made in education.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/70/352|title=Report of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran|website=www.un.org|access-date=2016-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Special Rapporteur also noted that despite 14 recommendations made to alleviate the obstacles currently preventing equal gender attainment in the educational sphere, the Rouhani government rejected consideration of all of them.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

While the vast majority of Iranian students who attend secondary school do not go on to study at a university, 42 percent of women who take the university entrance exams continue on to higher education, compared to 29 percent  of males.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The state of literacy and educational attainment among ethnic minority females is also poor when compared to urban, non-minority peers, as they are not forced to attend school and often enter marriage at an early age.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The dual nature of female participation in education is not yet reflected in their role in the economy, where 20-25 percent  of educated women are able to find work.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

== Alternative Schooling Options for Women in Iran ==

=== Adult Literacy Programs ===

In addition to formal education, women in Iran may enroll in literacy programs.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These programs target women, offering basic training in simple math, reading, and writing. In the 1990s, women composed over two-thirds of enrollees in these programs.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This may have contributed to the steep rise in female literacy rates in Iran in the 1990s, which increased twenty-percent from 1987 to 1997.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Religious Schools ===

Religious schools have also become an educational option for Iranian women, and the rise in the institution of "female seminaries" to 280 as of 2010 shows their increasing use as an academic pursuit.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sakurai|first=Keiko|date=November 2012|title=Shi‘ite Women’s Seminaries (howzeh-ye ‘elmiyyeh-ye khahran) in Iran: Possibilities and Limitations|url=|journal=Iranian Studies|volume=45|doi=10.1080/00210862.2012.726846 |pmid=|pages=727–744}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity stems from the infusion of religion into Iran post-revolution, when Ayatollah Khomeini called for the establishment of [[Jamiat al-Zahra|Jami‘at al-Zahra]] in 1984, the first female seminary in Iran.&lt;ref name=":11"/&gt; The institution, a consolidation of smaller religious schools, offers enrollees the chance to earn anything from high school diplomas to doctoral degrees.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Women must apply to enroll in the institutions, where only 7,000 women were accepted from a field of over 25,000 applicants in the 2010 academic year.&lt;ref name=":11"/&gt;

Seminaries have served as an alternative to higher education when female applicants are denied admission, either as a result of academic success or the quota system employed by public universities.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

=== Other schooling ===

Newly married Iranian women must attend government-mandated family planning classes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Information on health and birth control use is included in these programs.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Role of Education in Iran ==
Though education has been dominated in many fields by females, especially at the university level, it has not enabled women to enter the work force in comparative numbers.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Aside from having an empowering aspect for women, some scholars note increased schooling has yet to result in paid employment increases or roles in authoritative positions of employment.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  While female participation in the paid economy was shown to increase by a third after the Iranian Revolution, the seemingly optimistic figure was attributed more so to the continued employment of women already in the labor force rather than an increase in newly graduated women successfully entering it.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Whereas 23.5 million men held paid positions in the Iranian economy in 2006, for instance, merely 3.5 million Iranian women obtained similar positions, or 20 percent of the labor force pool.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The increase in educational opportunities has also not correlated with an increase in the number of educated women entering decision-making positions in government or the private economy. Women are largely absent from high-level full-time professorship positions or as heads of institutions of higher educations, a reality made more difficult by the low enrollment rate of women at the master's and specialized doctorate levels of education that are necessary for positions in university-level positions.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Some scholars have argued that education has contributed to female self-empowerment, giving women a task to achieve that is outside the home even if it does lead to viable employment.

Survey evidence indicates that young educated Iranian women view education as important or very important to a female in Iranian society, more so than other members of Iranian society.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; More of these educated youth also believe, more so than their non-educated and older female compatriots, that their daughters should marry following attendance of an institution of higher education.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The education of Iranian women has correspondingly led to a delayed entry into marriage, with non-educated females more than half as likely to be married by the time they turn 22 years old than educated peers.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Education is also shown to contribute to the delayed start of having a family, with  the majority of educated women having their first child by the age of 24, 4 years later than non-educated women in Iran.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=November 2008}}
The '''Youth Empowerment Scheme''', or '''YES''', is a charity in [[Belfast]] that offers a mentoring service to children between 11 and 14 years old. 

==History==
YES was established in 2001 by participants on the [[Washington Ireland Program]] including Chris Johnston, Ryan Moffett, Sarah Quinlan and Andrea Erskine and was based on [[Teamwork for Tomorrow]], a similar scheme run by students at [[Notre Dame University]], [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wiprogram.org/AlumniUpdate.cfm |title=Alumni Updates |publisher=Washington Ireland Program}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 YES was awarded the BT Link Award for Challenge with the University of Ulster.

==Approach==
The Youth Empowerment Scheme aims at empowering the young people of Belfast and encouraging them to be active citizens in their city. It holds that [[youth mentoring]] can provide young people with positive role models, support and encouragement, and is thus the most effective way of helping them reach their fullest potential as citizens and productive members of society.

YES aims to promote the social inclusion of young people of ethnic, religious, educational and social economic diversity. To contribute to the creation of a tolerant, pluralist society in Belfast, free from racism, sectarianism and anti-Semitism, the Youth Empowerment Scheme runs weekly workshops that explain and celebrate the diversity of cultures in the city. In 2005 a project entitled 'Gaining Voice' culminated in the release of a short film written and produced by the young participants in the Scheme. It took the form of a political broadcast and highlighted issues of concern to young people, such as peer pressure, bullying and racism.

==Operations==
The Youth Empowerment Scheme is run primarily by student volunteers from the [[University of Ulster]] and [[Queen's University Belfast]]. Volunteers receive training in child mentoring and in child protection policy and procedures.

===Fundraising activities===
YES relies on the goodwill of volunteers in terms of time and also donations to run the charity. Some successful charity fundraisers include 'A night at the movies'.&lt;ref name=MBBBOTCC&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.ulster.ac.uk/releases/2005/1569.html |title=Movies Bring Big Box-Office To Children’s Charity |date=March 11, 2005 |publisher=University of Ulster}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Film fans came together at the Sheridan IMAX movie theatre to raise over £1,500 in box-office takings for a children’s charity.'The silver screen worked its magic for the Youth Empowerment Scheme (YES), a cross community, multi-ethnic charity set up by UU and QUB students to work as mentors with children aged 11–14. Featuring live jazz as well as cinema the special fundraising event - billed as ‘A Night at the Movies’.&lt;ref name=MBBBOTCC /&gt;
