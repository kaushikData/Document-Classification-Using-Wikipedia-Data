'''Aboriginal sites of Victoria''' form an important record of human occupation for probably more than 40,000 years. They may be identified from archaeological remains, historical and ethnographic information or continuing [[oral traditions]] and encompass places where rituals and ceremonies were performed, occupation sites where people ate, slept and carried out their day to day chores, and ephemeral evidence of people passing through the landscape, such as a discarded axe head or isolated artefact.

Victorian Aboriginal sites include [[Midden|shell middens]], [[scarred trees]], [[Burnt mound|cooking mounds]], [[rock art]], [[burials]], [[Aboriginal sacred site|ceremonial sites]] and innumerable [[Stone tool|stone artefacts]]. These stone flakes represent the tools Aboriginal people used, such as knives, spear points, scrapers and awls, and the waste material left behind when they were made. Commonly referred to as ''stone artefact scatters'' such sites can be found on the surface or exposed by ploughing or erosion, or through careful [[archaeological excavation]].

==Types of sites==

Scarred trees result from removing bark for the manufacture of shields, [[Coolamon (vessel)|coolamons]], shelters and other utensils can be found where appropriate species of tree of sufficient age survive. Some trees were marked with designs and symbols. A large [[river red gum]] with a canoe scar is located at [[Heide Museum of Modern Art|Heide Gallery]] in [[Bulleen]].

[[File:ScarTree.jpg|thumb|Scar tree from removal of bark for a shield, near Wahgunyah]]

There have been more than 60 rock art sites identified in the [[Grampians National Park#Cultural heritage|Grampians National Park]] which contains about 80% of the known Aboriginal [[rock art]] sites in Victoria, with a number of new discoveries after the fires of January 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Brochure, ''[http://www.environment.gov.au/heritage/publications/about/pubs/national-heritage-grampians.pdf Grampians National Park (Gariwerd), Victoria] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123084633/http://environment.gov.au/heritage/publications/about/pubs/national-heritage-grampians.pdf |date=23 November 2011 }}'', Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts. Accessed 25 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; They depict humans, human hands, animal tracks and birds, while some are open to the public and are readily accessible including: Billimina (Glenisla shelter), Jananginj Njani (Camp of the Emu's Foot), Manja (Cave of Hands), Larngibunja (Cave of Fishes), Ngamadjidj (Cave of Ghosts), and Gulgurn Manja (Flat Rock).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grampiansnationalpark.com/grampians/national/park/history.asp#aboriginal |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426023101/http://www.grampiansnationalpark.com/grampians/national/park/history.asp |archivedate=26 April 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearby [[Bunjil|Bunjil's Shelter]], which illustrates Bunjil, the creator, is in the Black Range near [[Stawell, Victoria|Stawell]]. A painting thought to be of a [[thylacine]] (Tasmanian tiger) is noted from [[Chiltern-Mount Pilot National Park|Mt Pilot]] and the paintings at [[Mudgegonga]] rock shelter in north-eastern Victoria are possibly 3500 years old.

[[File:Wurdi Youang.jpg|thumb|right|A small part of the Wurdi Youang stone arrangement]]

Ceremonial sites are rare, but two large stone arrangements have been found at [[Wurdi Youang]] near [[Mount Rothwell]] and [[Carisbrook]]. others have been identified from Oral tradition, although archaeological remains are no longer evident such as the [[Corroboree|Corroboree Tree]] at [[Richmond, Victoria|Richmond]] oval was a significant gathering place for the Wurundjeri people. A number of earth rings have been identified in [[Sunbury earth rings|Sunbury]],&lt;ref&gt;Frankel, David 1982 Earth rings at Sunbury, Victoria. Archaeology in Oceania 17:83-89&lt;/ref&gt; which, although lacking historical or ethnographic evidence, have been interpreted as ceremonial Bora rings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.archaeology.arts.uwa.edu.au/about/research/bowdler/a_study_of_indigenous_ceremonial_(bora)_sites_in_eastern_australia |title=Bowdler, Sandra, 1999, ''A study of Indigenous ceremonial ("Bora") sites in eastern Australia'', Centre for Archaeology, University of Western Australia, paper delivered at "Heritage Landscapes: Understanding Place &amp;Communities" conference, Southern Cross University, Lismore, November 1999 |access-date=6 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414223443/http://www.archaeology.arts.uwa.edu.au/about/research/bowdler/a_study_of_indigenous_ceremonial_(bora)_sites_in_eastern_australia |archive-date=14 April 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mount William Aboriginal stone axe quarry.jpg|thumb|Mount William Quarry]]

Evidence of stone quarrying is rare, but the [[Mount William stone axe quarry]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.iprimus.com.au/foo7/arch2.html Archaeological site at Mount William Lancefield Australia, Romsey Australia]&lt;/ref&gt; is one of a number of stone sources used for making tools which were traded long distances throughout central and western Victoria and into New South Wales.&lt;ref&gt;Coutts, P.J.F. &amp; Miller, R (1977). The Mt. William archaeological area. Melbourne: Victorian Archaeological Survey, Government Printer&lt;/ref&gt;

Only a relatively small number of burials have been identified in Victoria, most of which are associated with sand dunes along the coast or in the north west of the state. [[Kow Swamp Archaeological Site|Kow Swamp]] is particularly significant for evidence of 13000 year old burial rituals using a headband of kangaroo incisors similar to those worn by Aboriginal people until recently, and for consistent burial practices over a long period. A burial on the banks of the Werribee river has been dated to about 7300 years ago.

Shell [[midden]]s occur along most of the coastline and some lake-shores and river banks. Most of these were relatively recent (due to the mobile nature of sand) such as [[Apollo Bay|Seal Point]] and [[Moonlight Head]] in the [[Otway Ranges]], although some like [[Mallacoota]] Inlet in eastern Gippsland have been dated to more than 2500 years ago, and [[Wilsons Promontory]] 6500 years ago.

Large earth mounds were built up by deliberate transport of soil and the remains of clay heat retainers in hearths, the collapse of seasonally abandoned turf huts and camp activities. Examples have been found on the [[Hopkins River]] flood plain in central western Victoria, and in the [[Nyah Forest]], the oldest is dated to about 2500 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Coutts and Jane Wesson, Victoria Archaeological Survey Summer Schools in Archaeology: An Evaluation, ''Australian Archaeology'' No. 11 (Dec., 1980), pp. 19–127&lt;/ref&gt;

Fish and eel traps were constructed on many rivers, and while most were probably of organic materials and have left little trace, some, such as at [[Lake Condah]] in western Victoria reveal complex systems of excavated channels and stone weirs, dated to 3000 years ago. Stone artefacts found near the bones of now extinct megafauna at Lancefield in central Victoria have suggested Aboriginal people were living alongside giant marsupials 26,000 years ago.

While rock shelters are often the sites of cave painting and other art, they also provide deeply stratified occupation deposits because they are protected from erosion. [[New Guinea II cave]] on the Snowy River near Buchan has deposits more than 10 000 years old along with delicate cave paintings and engravings. Rock shelters were occupied in the [[Tarragal Caves|Cape Bridgewater]] area about 12,000 years ago. [[Cloggs Cave]] rock shelter near [[Buchan, Victoria]] was occupied about 18,000 years ago, where bone tools and animal remains were found. At the [[Keilor Archaeological Site]] a human hearth excavated in 1971 was radiocarbon-dated to about 31,000 years [[Before Present|BP]], making Keilor one of the earliest sites of human habitation in Australia, while at [[Box Gully archaeological site|Box Gully]] on [[Lake Tyrrell]], emu eggs and other artefacts have been dated to 27,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Josephine Flood, Pleistocene Human Occupation and Extinct Fauna in Cloggs Cave, Buchan, South-east Australia
 ''Nature'' 246, 303 (30 November 1973); {{doi|10.1038/246303a0}}, Department of Prehistory, Research School of Pacific Studies, Australian National University, Box 4, PO, Canberra, ACT 2600&lt;/ref&gt;

Stone artefact scatters are among the most common site types and provide evidence of tool use and manufacture. These are often extensive surface scatters and deep [[Archaeological stratigraphy|stratified]] deposits of flaked finegrained stone, of [[lithic flake]]s. Much of this material is waste flakes, discarded during the manufacture process. Specific types of artefacts such as blades, scrapers or [[burin (lithic flake)|burin]]s may indicate what the area was used for, for example processing animal skins. Stone artefact material is usually rine grained [[silcrete]], [[chert]], and [[quartz]]. [[Hornfels in Victorian archaeological sites|Hornfels]] is an unusual and rare material, but is highly distinctive.

==Age and chronology==

Archaeological evidence points to people first arriving in [[Australia]] around 50,000 years ago and in Victoria shortly after. Sites over 22,000 years old have been found at [[Kow Swamp Archaeological Site]] and the [[Keilor archaeological site]].&lt;ref name="keilor_presland"&gt;Gary Presland, ''[http://www.emelbourne.net.au/biogs/EM00792b.htm Keilor Archaeological Site]'', eMelbourne website. Accessed 3 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Human cranium|cranium]] found at the site has been dated at between 12,000&lt;ref&gt;Peter Brown, ''[http://www-personal.une.edu.au/~pbrown3/Keilor.html The Keilor Cranium] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041217013357/http://www-personal.une.edu.au/~pbrown3/Keilor.html |date=17 December 2004 }}'', Peter Brown's Australian and Asian Palaeoanthropology, Accessed 3 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and 14,700 years [[Before Present|BP]].&lt;ref name="keilor_presland" /&gt;

The oldest archaeological site in the greater Melbourne area, and one of the most important, is at Keilor on the Maribyrnong River. A human skull discovered there in 1940 was later found to be around 13 000 years old, older than any other human remains found in Australia up to that time, and the find attracted worldwide attention. After small excavations in the 1960s and 1970s, archaeologists from [[La Trobe University]] and the [[Victoria Archaeological Survey]] (VAS) began an excavation that continued for five years finding a sequence of stone tools and butchered animal bone.

==Occupation patterns==

Whilst most evidence of Aboriginal settlement is derived from camp sites where fireplaces, remains of stone tool making and sometimes structures such as mounds and huts can be found, and these sites are almost always located close to reliable water sources, the distribution of Aboriginal archaeological sites demonstrates occupation of all the climatic zones in Victoria, even during the extreme global climatic conditions at the peak of the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] when temperatures were colder, vast amounts of surface water were frozen in glaciers and sea levels were lower. Around 18,000 BP sea levels were about 65 metres below present day levels,&lt;ref&gt;John Mulvaney &amp; Johan Kamminga, ''Prehistory of Australia'', Washington, D.C. : Smithsonian Institution Press,1999&lt;/ref&gt; while archaeological evidence has shown that people were present in south‐eastern Australia throughout all of the climatic changes of at least the last 30,000 years ranging from the deep gorges and highlands of [[East Gippsland]] such as at Clogg’s Cave,&lt;ref&gt;Josephine Flood, ''Archaeology of the Dreamtime'', J. B. Publishing, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and New Guinea II cave,&lt;ref&gt;'New Guinea II Cave: a Pleistocene site on the Snowy River, Victoria' by Paul Ossa | Papers by Paul co-authored with Brendan Marshal &amp; Cathie Webb, ''Archaeology in Oceania'' (1995) Volume: 30, Issue: 1, Pages: 22-35.&lt;/ref&gt; the riverine plains at Keilor, the inland plains and swamps such as Kow Swamp, and the eastern ranges at the Grampians.

==Protection and management==

All Aboriginal archaeological sites and relics in Victoria are protected under the [[Aboriginal Heritage Act 2006 (Victoria)|Aboriginal Heritage Act 2006]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/aha2006164/ Aboriginal Heritage Act 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; and are administered by [[Victorian Minister for Aboriginal Affairs|Aboriginal Affairs Victoria]], in some instances through delegation to [[Registered Aboriginal Party|Registered Aboriginal Parties]]. All known sites are recorded on the [[Victorian Aboriginal Heritage Register]] (VAHR), which is maintained by Aboriginal Affairs Victoria. There were approximately 30,000 places and objects included on the register to date.&lt;ref&gt;[https://applications.vic.gov.au/apps/achris/public/home AAV Home - Aboriginal Affairs Victoria - ACHRIS]&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''Auto Restaurant''' is a [[Rest area]] facility found in Japan, equipped with food sale and feeding facilities by a [[vending machine]].
In many cases it is unmanned and it is open 24 hours a day, but the facilities that include an {{Sfn | Ogasawara | 2017}} ,{{Sfn | Kawakami | 2017 | p = 1}} [[Amusement arcade]], may have established business hours. Some locations have bathing facilities such as an [[Onsen]].

== History ==
Suburban type shops along the [[National highways of Japan]] developed for customers who eat at midnight, such as the truck drivers of the 1970s. Initially, the range of foods available at the vending machines was hamburgers, [[cup noodle]], and [[Japanese curry]]. They were prepared in a, {{Sfn | SALTY | 2015}} [[microwave]] or used hot water from an integrated water heater, But later vending machines appeared that could automatically cook enriched meals with variations such as [[tempura]], [[soba]], and [[udon]]. There is also a sit down [[Drive-in]].

In 1978, a video game machine "[[space invaders]]" appears, a fusion shop of the auto restaurant and the suburban game center has appeared, and it is at its peak. However, entering the 1980s, when the 24-hour [[convenience store]] and [[fast food]] stores increase all over the country, it is possible to procure meals without relying on vending machines even at midnight As a result, automatic vending machines that are complex and difficult to maintain have become obsolescent. Due to public security problems, the number of stores quickly reduced .{{Sfn | Kawakami | 2017 | p = 2}}

Thereafter, business types like "[[am / pm # AUTOMATIC SUPER · DELIS|AUTOMATIC SUPER · DELIS]] in which convenience chains set up vending machines for lunch and drinks at offices and the like also appeared. Moreover, in parking area of [[Controlled-access highway|expressway]], there are increasing cases of abolishing the shops / light snack corner or making it unmanned, and there are increasing cases to shift to this form, and parking areas with only the toilet and parking areas newly established Even such as doing such correspondence.

'''Buiten De Zone''' (English translation: ''Outside The Zone'') was a 1994-1996 Flemish humoristic-satirical TV series aiming a teenage demographic. It was a combination of a [[sitcom]] and a [[sketch show]] and broadcast on the Flemish public TV channel TV1. It gained a [[cult following|cult status]] &lt;ref&gt;https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2017/10/06/waarom-staat-bart-de-pauw-op-de-foto-met-de-cast-van--buiten-de-/&lt;/ref&gt;  and has been repeated several times since. The show was furthermore important for launching the notability of TV host [[Bart De Pauw]], who both co-wrote and acted in the series.

==Concept==

''Buiten De Zone'' is set at a [[call center]] named ''De Jongerenphoon'' (''The Young Adult Phone''), where five young adults have to take calls to help out teenagers and twens with questions and problems. Three of them are men, Raf Willems, Ubi Stevens and Robin Laureys and two are women, Merel Van Outrive and Roxanne Seynaeve. Since the [[quintet]] are still very young themselves they are generally bored with taking the calls, particularly since the few people who phone them just make [[prank call]]s. &lt;ref&gt;http://focus.knack.be/entertainment/tv-radio/tv-nostalgie-buiten-de-zone-buiten-de-lijntjes/article-normal-212375.html&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the time they either just talk with one another, practice hobbies or [[daydream]]. These daydreams are used as [[cut-away]]s to absurd comedic sketches. &lt;ref&gt;http://focus.knack.be/entertainment/tv-radio/tv-nostalgie-buiten-de-zone-buiten-de-lijntjes/article-normal-212375.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

The series ran for two seasons, the first one broadcast in 1994, the other in 1996. Each episode is built around a thematic concept. Much of the comedy was subversive and dealt with [[anarchism|anarchic]] jokes about religion, education, teenage life and sex, along with historic-cultural references. The show also had a wide variety of [[running gag]]s and [[catch phrase]]s.   

==Cast==

The show was the brainchild of [[Bart De Pauw]], Danny Timmermans, Pietje Horsten, Ief Stuyvaert and [[Tom Lenaerts]], who all co-wrote each episode. &lt;ref&gt;http://focus.knack.be/entertainment/tv-radio/tv-nostalgie-buiten-de-zone-buiten-de-lijntjes/article-normal-212375.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

* [[Bart De Pauw]] - Raf Willems
* [[Mathias Sercu]] - Ubi Stevens
* [[Danny Timmermans]] - Robin Laureys
* [[Reinhilde Van Driel]] - Merel Van Outrive
* [[Elise Bundervoet]] - Roxanne Seynaeve

Various celebrity TV actors also had [[Cameo appearance|cameos]] in the series. 

==Cultural impact==

''Buiten De Zone'' originally wasn't a huge success &lt;ref&gt;http://focus.knack.be/entertainment/tv-radio/tv-nostalgie-buiten-de-zone-buiten-de-lijntjes/article-normal-212375.html&lt;/ref&gt; , mostly since none of the cast were well known actors at the time. Apart from that the series was also advertised as a show aimed at youngsters, which already gave many potential viewers the wrong impression that it was a child-oriented series. Since the series was cast on Friday evenings &lt;ref&gt;http://focus.knack.be/entertainment/tv-radio/tv-nostalgie-buiten-de-zone-buiten-de-lijntjes/article-normal-212375.html&lt;/ref&gt; , after 22.00 p.m., it didn't reach its target demographic either, since many young people went to parties at that moment. Slowly but surely it started to gain a cult following, which grew as the second season was broadcast. De Pauw attributed this to the fact that the second series was much better and tighter written.&lt;ref&gt;http://focus.knack.be/entertainment/tv-radio/tv-nostalgie-buiten-de-zone-buiten-de-lijntjes/article-normal-212375.html&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Buiten De Zone'' now won the TV awards ''Best National TV Show 1996'' and the HA! van Humo from the magazine [[Humo]]. It also won silver at the [[Golden Rose of Montreux]] festival. In 1996-1998 Bart De Pauw and [[Tom Lenaerts]] became media superstars thanks to another TV show, ''[[Schalkse Ruiters]]'', which made rebroadcasts of ''Buiten De Zone'' gain a much wider audience than ever before. 

In 2010 the entire series was released on DVD. The reason it had taken this long had to do with the fact that De Pauw often used [[film soundtrack]] music as atmospheric background music, which made copyright issues unavoidable. &lt;ref&gt;http://focus.knack.be/entertainment/tv-radio/tv-nostalgie-buiten-de-zone-buiten-de-lijntjes/article-normal-212375.html&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.standaard.be/cnt/dmf20100826_069&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://jeugdsentimentportaal.wordpress.com/buiten-de-zone/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Andrea Mantegna 054.jpg|thumb|right|The "Court Scene".]]

The '''Camera degli Sposi''' ("bridal chamber"), sometimes known as the '''Camera picta''' ("painted chamber"), is a room [[fresco]]ed with [[illusionistic painting]]s by [[Andrea Mantegna]] in the [[Ducal Palace, Mantua]], [[Italy]].&lt;ref name="radke"&gt;{{cite book|first=John T.|last=Paoletti|author2=Gary M. Radke|title=Art, Power, and Patronage in Renaissance Italy|location=[[Upper Saddle River]]|publisher=[[Pearson PLC|Pearson]]/[[Prentice Hall]] |year=2005|pages=356–359}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="adams"&gt;{{cite book|first= Laurie |last=Schneider Adams|title=Italian Renaissance Art|location=[[Boulder]]|publisher=[[Westview Press]]|year=2001|pages=262–267}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was painted between 1465 and 1474 and commissioned by [[Ludovico III Gonzaga, Marquis of Mantua|Ludovico III Gonzaga]], and is notable for the use of ''[[trompe l'oeil]]'' details and its ''[[di sotto in sù]]'' ceiling.
[[Image:Andrea Mantegna 080.jpg|thumb|left|The "Meeting Scene".]]

The chronological sequence of the paintings has been recently discovered: the painter started from the vault by dry painting in the background small bits particularly those of the oculus and the wreath surrounding it. Then he moved on to the ‘Court scene’ where he used a mysterious oily tempera dry laid out on the surface. The east and south walls followed, with the traditional fresco technique representing heavy curtains. Finally the ‘Meeting scene’ on the west wall was painted, always ‘a fresco’ but in very small bits which confirms an almost ten-year period of work on that part of the chamber.&lt;ref name="guidemantova"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://guideturistichemantova.it/English/?p=34 |title=Mantua Tourist Guide, The Bridal Chamber |accessdate=4 April 2011 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The walls==
The "Court Scene" on the north wall shows Ludovico Gonzaga, dressed informally, with his wife [[Barbara of Brandenburg, Marquise of Mantua|Barbara of Brandenburg]]. They are seated with their relatives, while a group of [[courtier]]s fill the rest of the wall. The figures are interacting in an illusionistically expanded space.

On the west wall is the "Meeting scene". This fresco shows Ludovico in official robes in an ideal meeting with his son, Cardinal Francesco Gonzaga, the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]] and [[Christian I of Denmark]].

The commission is far from being explained by scholars. The traditional interpretation sees the frescos as linked to the election as Cardinal of Ludovico's son Francesco Gonzaga, which took place on January 1, 1462: the Court scene should then represent the Marquis receiving the news, and the Meeting Scene should see father and son reunited in the happy event.&lt;ref name="guidemantova"/&gt;

The mature and strongly-built figure of Francesco though, doesn’t seem to match with his age in 1461, which was only 17 (an early portrait held today in Naples confirms this). For this reason, these frescos could refer to a later visit of Cardinal Francesco to Mantua, perhaps on August 1472 when he was given the title of St. Andrew.&lt;ref name="guidemantova"/&gt;

==The ceiling==
Mantegna's playful ceiling presents an [[oculus]] that illusionistically opens into a blue sky, with foreshortened [[putti]] playfully frolicking around a balustrade. This was one of the earliest [[di sotto in sù]] ceiling paintings.

'''Citizenship Counts''' is a non-partisan [[501(c)(3) organization]] based in [[Arizona]] that is dedicated to inspiring American youth with a [[civic education]] curriculum that teaches them the value and responsibilities of [[citizenship]], promotes pride in [[American citizenship]], and encourages students to be involved in their communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://citizenshipcounts.org/index.php/about/vision-statement |title=Citizenship Counts: Mission and Vision |date= |accessdate=February 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
By educating students on the tenets of citizenship, inspiring their pride of being United States citizens, and encouraging them to serve in their communities, Citizenship Counts empowers students to be responsible, active, and socially just citizens who appreciate the benefits of living in a diverse, inclusive, [[democracy|democratic]] country. Through this program, all citizens have greater access to naturalization ceremonies in their communities. Attending these ceremonies provides Americans with a deeper understanding and appreciation of the role that [[immigration]] has played in creating their diverse and dynamic communities.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In October 2004, [[Gerda Weissmann Klein]] was asked to speak at a [[naturalization]] ceremony that was hosted by Three Rivers Middle School in [[Cleves]], [[Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://citizenshipcounts.org/index.php/about/history/ |title=Citizenship Counts: History |date= |accessdate=February 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Klein was touched by the students' interest and excitement as they witnessed immigrants taking the [[Oath of Allegiance (United States)|"Oath of Allegiance"]] to become citizens of the [[United States]]. She envisioned students across the country having the opportunity to participate in planning and engaging in naturalization ceremonies hosted by their schools.

Klein shared her experience with her granddaughter, Alysa Ullman Cooper, and her friend, Rita Schaefer, then President of [[Holt McDougal|McDougal Littell]], a publisher of educational materials for middle- and high-school students. After learning that Klein and Ullman were invited to attend a special naturalization ceremony at the [[White House]], Schaefer encouraged Ullman to author a civics-based curriculum about the naturalization process. In February 2008, ''The Path to Citizenship'' was published, and in August 2008, Citizenship Counts was founded to implement the program in schools across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gonzales |first=Angela |title=Group’s mission is to help middle-school students plan naturalization ceremonies |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/stories/2008/10/20/story4.html?b= |date=October 17, 2008 |work=Phoenix Business Journal |publisher=American City Business Journals, Inc. |accessdate=February 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 23, 2009, the inaugural naturalization ceremony under the stewardship of Citizenship Counts was held at the [[Phoenix Convention Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gonzales |first=Angela |title=Students take lesson from new citizens |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/stories/2009/03/23/daily13.html |date=March 25, 2009 |work=Phoenix Business Journal |publisher=American City Business Journals, Inc. |accessdate=February 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fifty new citizens from twenty-six countries took the "Oath of Allegiance," which was administered by former Supreme Court Justice [[Sandra Day O’Connor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Haros |first=Sandra |title=Ret.

In 2009 and 2010, multiple naturalization ceremonies have been hosted at local schools and community centers in Arizona, including Villa Montessori and [[Mesquite High School (Gilbert, Arizona)|Mesquite High School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Joyce |first=Kirsten |title=20 people from around the world become U.S. citizens legally |url=http://www.azfamily.com/video/featured-videos/20-people-from-around-the-world-become-US-citizens-legally-92271089.html |date=April 27, 2010 |work=KTVK |publisher=Belo Corp. |accessdate=February 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Seligman |first=Allie |title=Mesquite students get first-hand look at citizenship process |url=http://www.azcentral.com/community/gilbert/articles/2010/05/03/20100503mesquite-citizen-process-0503.html |date=May 3, 2010 |work=azcentral.com |publisher=Gannett Co.

On January 29, 2011, Citizenship Counts and the [[USCIS|United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS)]] hosted a naturalization ceremony at the [[Mall of America]] in [[Bloomington, Minnesota|Bloomington]], [[Minnesota]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rosario |first=Rubén |title=Holocaust survivor Gerda Weissmann Klein spreads love for her adopted land |url=http://www.twincities.com/ci_17210844?IADID |date=January 28, 2011 |work=Pioneer Press |publisher=MediaNews Group |accessdate=February 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; where forty-one adults from twenty-two countries and thirty-nine children from thirty-six countries participated. At this event, Gerda Weissmann Klein received the Outstanding American By Choice award from USCIS Director, Alejandro Mayorkas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.5af9bb95919f35e66f614176543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=f6f37f39153ed210VgnVCM100000082ca60aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=34165c2af1f9e010VgnVCM1000000ecd190aRCRD |title=2011 Outstanding American By Choice Recipients |publisher=USCIS |date= January 29, 2011|accessdate=February 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2011, Gerda Weissmann Klein received the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] in a ceremony at the White House. Klein was nominated for this award by U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] for her dedication to "the value of freedom" and "promoting tolerance and understanding among all people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=President Obama Names Presidential Medal of Freedom Recipients |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2010/11/17/president-obama-names-presidential-medal-freedom-recipients |date=November 17, 2010 |work=Office of the Press Secretary |publisher=The White House |accessdate=February 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=2010 Presidential Medal of Freedom Ceremony |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/photos-and-video/video/2011/02/15/2010-presidential-medal-freedom-ceremony |date=February 15, 2011 |work=Office of the Press Secretary |publisher=The White House |accessdate=February 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Future ceremonies and events are planned for [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Twin Cities|Minneapolis-Saint Paul]], [[Omaha]], [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[Cincinnati]], [[Denver]], and [[Honolulu]] schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://citizenshipcounts.org/index.php/in-the-community/event-calendar-2/ |title=Citizenship Counts: Event Calendar |date= |accessdate=February 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 2011, Citizenship Counts will be partnering with the [[Close Up Foundation]] to host a ceremony in [[Washington, D.C.]], bringing students together from several communities across the country.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Curriculum==
Citizenship Counts' interactive and multi-disciplinary curriculum, ''The Path to Citizenship'', provides a unique opportunity for students to plan and host a community-based naturalization ceremony in their schools. This curriculum also helps students learn about the processes of immigration and naturalization and the rights of being a citizen in the United States. Topics and features include historical background on immigration to the United States, the naturalization process, classroom activities about immigration and citizenship, a citizenship handbook, and a school-wide naturalization ceremony project.&lt;ref&gt;Ullman, Alysa. ''The Path to Citizenship: A Naturalization Project for Your School''. United States: McDougal Littell, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Citizenship Counts acts as the liaison between the schools that utilize the curriculum and both [[USCIS]] and the U.S. [[United States federal courts|Federal Courts]], which perform naturalization ceremonies at the schools. At these ceremonies, school-wide participation is encouraged: the student choir has sung "[[America the Beautiful]]", the school band has played "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]", the [[ROTC]] has presented the colors, and students have participated in essay and artwork contests. During the ceremony the students have the unique opportunity to witness the emotion and fulfillment felt by new citizens as they take "The Oath of Allegiance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://citizenshipcounts.org/index.php/educators/curriculum/ |title=Citizenship Counts: Curriculum |accessdate=February 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This page lists the '''Classifications of scholarship'''; the classifications, thesauri or maps developed to categorise scholarly research. Classifications have been created by many organisations to classify scholarly research. The kinds of activity covered by these classifications include the research itself, the outputs of the research (such as articles in learned journals) and funding for the research.

The classifications operate at different levels of detail. Some cover the whole of scholarly endeavour; some cover broad fields, such as medicine; some cover entire disciplines, such as physics; some cover a specific sub-discipline, such as high-energy physics. In total there are probably hundreds or thousands of different classifications. The classifications have found new applications in the digital era as the basis for many commercial text-mining algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Elsevier Fingerprint Engine|url=http://info.scival.com/fingerprint|website=info.scival.com|accessdate=July 13, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The classifications are the subject of ongoing inquiry and development among academics and agencies studying the system of science.&lt;ref name=ucsd&gt;{{cite web|last1=Börner|first1=Katy|last2=Klavans|first2=Richard|last3=Patek|first3=Michael|last4=Zoss|first4=Angela M.|last5=Biberstine|first5=Joseph R.|last6=Light|first6=Robert P.|last7=Larivière|first7=Vincent|last8=Boyack|first8=Kevin W.|title=Design and Update of a Classification System: The UCSD Map of Science|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0039464|website=PLOS ONE|accessdate=July 13, 2017|pages=e39464|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0039464|date=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These agencies include the [[OECD]] and the [[United States National Research Council|U.S. National Research Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Data on Federal Research and Development Investments: A Pathway to Modernization|date=2009|publisher=National Research Council|isbn=9780309145237|url=https://www.nap.edu/catalog/12772/data-on-federal-research-and-development-investments-a-pathway-to|accessdate=July 13, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A conference on science mapping standards was held in 2013 at [[Indiana University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cyberinfrastructure for Network Science (CNS) Center at Indiana University|url=http://cns.iu.edu/workshops/event/131104.html|website=cns.iu.edu|accessdate=July 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, clothing is, and has been, made from many materials. These materials range from grasses to furs, to much more elaborate and exotic materials. Some cultures, such as the various people of the Arctic Circle, have made their clothing entirely of prepared and decorated furs and skins. Other cultures have supplemented and replaced leather and skins with cloth. Cloth is either woven or knitted, and can be made from a large variety of [[fibers]], which in turn can be [[natural fiber|natural]], [[cellulose fiber|cellulose]], or [[synthetic fiber|synthetic]].

Humans have shown extreme inventiveness in devising clothing solutions to environmental hazards and the distinction between clothing and other protective equipment is not always clear-cut; examples include [[space suit]], [[air conditioned clothing]], [[armor]], [[diving suit]], [[swimsuit]], [[Beekeeping#Protective clothing|bee-keeper's protective clothing]], [[motorcycle leathers]], [[high-visibility clothing]], and [[protective clothing]] in general.

==Clothing materials==
Clothing is generally made of cloth. There are many different types of cloth, with different names and uses. Main differences between types of cloth include how the cloth was made (woven, knitted, felted, and how those techniques were implemented), what fiber it was made from, and what weight the cloth is. Different types of cloth are used for different types of clothing.

Some common natural clothing materials are:
* Fabric made of [[cotton]], [[flax]], [[wool]], [[ramie]], [[silk]]
* [[Denim]]
* [[Leather]]
* [[Down feather|Down]] for down-filled [[Anorak|parka]]s
* [[Fur clothing|Fur]] 
Some are made from synthetic fibers, which are man made and generally not [[biodegradable]]. These are made primarily from [[petrochemical]]s.
Common man-made materials include:
* [[Nylon]] was first produced in 1935. Nylon is a [[thermoplastic]] silky material. It became famous when used in women's [[stocking]]s ("nylons") in 1940. It was intended to be a synthetic replacement for [[silk]] and substituted for it in many different products after silk became scarce during [[World War II]]. 
* [[Polyester]]s include naturally occurring chemicals and [[Organic compound#Synthetic compounds|synthetic]]s. Natural polyesters and a few synthetic ones are biodegradable, but most synthetic polyesters are not. Polyesters may change shape after the application of heat and are combustible at high temperatures. They tend to shrink away from flames and self-extinguish upon ignition. Polyester fibers have high tenacity and E-modulus as well as low water absorption and minimal shrinkage in comparison with other industrial fibers. 
* [[Spandex]] (elastane) is known for its exceptional [[elasticity (physics)|elasticity]]. It is stronger and more durable than [[rubber]], its major non-synthetic competitor. It was [[invention|invented]] in 1959 by Charles Lewis French Jr. and Taylor.

Less-common clothing materials include:
* [[Acetate (clothing material)|Acetate]]
* [[Cupro (clothing material)|Cupro]]
* [[Flannel]]
* [[Lyocell]]
* [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]]-Polyvinyl chloride
* [[Rayon]]
* Recycled or Recovered [[Cotton]]
* Recycled [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]]
* [[Paper recycling|Recycled bob]]
* [[Tyvek]]
* Other [[Natural Fiber]]s, including [[bamboo]], [[jute]], and [[hemp]]

Reinforcing materials such as [[wood]], [[bone]], [[plastic]] and [[metal]] may be used in [[fastener]]s or to stiffen garments.

'''Cohabitation''' is an arrangement where two people who are not [[Marriage|married]] live together. They often involve a [[Romance (love)|romantic]] or [[Human sexuality|sexually]] [[intimate relationship]] on a long-term or permanent basis.

Such arrangements have become increasingly common in [[Western world|Western countries]] during the past few decades, being led by changing social views, especially regarding marriage, gender roles and religion.

More broadly, the term ''cohabitation'' can mean any number of people living together. To "cohabit", in a broad sense, means to "coexist".&lt;ref name=oxford&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/cohabit?q=cohabitation#cohabit__19|title=Definition of cohabit|work=oxforddictionaries.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of the term comes from the mid 16th century, from the Latin ''cohabitare'', from co- 'together' + habitare 'dwell'.&lt;ref name=oxford/&gt;

==Social changes leading to increase==

[[File:Non marital by countries.gif|450px|thumb|Percentage of births to unmarried women, selected countries, 1980 and 2007&lt;ref name="non_mar1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db18.htm|title=Changing Patterns of Nonmarital Childbearing in the United States |work=CDC/National Center for Health Statistics|date=13 May 2009|accessdate=24 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Today, cohabitation is a common pattern among people in the Western world.

In Europe, the [[Scandinavia]]n countries have been the first to start this leading trend, although many countries have since followed.&lt;ref&gt;http://paa2011.princeton.edu/papers/110852&lt;/ref&gt; Mediterranean Europe has traditionally been very conservative, with religion playing a strong role. Until the mid-1990s, cohabitation levels remained low in this region, but have since increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/5467158/Cohabitation_in_Spain_No_longer_a_marginal_path_to_family_formation|title=Cohabitation in Spain: No longer a marginal path to family formation|author=Teresa Castro Martin|publisher=|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the past decades, in Western countries, there has been an increase in unmarried couples cohabiting. Historically, many Western countries have been influenced by [[Religion and sexuality#Christianity|Christian doctrines on sex]], which opposes unmarried cohabitation. As social mores have changed, such beliefs have become less widely held by the population and some Christian denominations today view cohabitation as a precursor to [[Christian views on marriage|marriage]].&lt;ref name="Taylor2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Ina|title=Religion and Life with Christianity|year=2005|publisher=[[Heinemann (publisher)|Heinemann]]|isbn=9780435302283|page=45|quote=Some Protestant groups, although preferring sex to exist exclusively in a married relationship, understand times have changed. These Christians are prepared to accept cohabitation if it is a prelude to marriage.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope Francis]] has married a cohabiting couple who had children,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-09-15/pope-francis-marries-20-couples-in-first-mass-papal-ceremony/5743838|title=Pope Francis breaks taboo by marrying cohabiting couples, conducts mass wedding ceremony|work=ABC News|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; while former [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[Rowan Williams]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-140843/Sex-outside-marriage-sin-says-Archbishop.html |title=Sex outside marriage is no sin, says Archbishop |date=17 March 2013 | location=London |work=Daily Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Archbishop of York [[John Sentamu]] have expressed tolerance of cohabitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Royal wedding: Archbishop backs William and Kate's decision to live together before marriage|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/royal-wedding/8481736/Royal-wedding-Archbishop-backs-William-and-Kates-decision-to-live-together-before-marriage.html|accessdate=3 August 2013|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=29 April 2011|first1=Tim|last1=Ross|first2=Jonathan|last2=Wynne-Jones|first3=Gordon|last3=Rayner|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent decades high rates of participation of women in the workforce, and the widespread availability of highly effective [[Long-acting reversible contraception|long acting reversible contraceptives]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The reproductive context of cohabitation in comparative perspective: Contraceptive use in the United States, Spain, and France|work=Demographic Research|author1=Megan M. Sweeney|author2=Teresa Castro-Martin|author3=[[Melinda Mills]]|volume=32|doi=10.4054/DemRes.2015.32.5|url=http://www.demographic-research.org/volumes/vol32/5/32-5.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; has led to women making individual choices over their reproduction with decreased reliance on male partners for financial stability. All these changes favored living arrangement alternatives to marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://demogr.mpg.de/publications%5Cfiles%5C3367_1248875633_1_Full%20Text.pdf|title=Non-Marital Cohabitation in Italy|author=Christin Löffler|date=31 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Central and Eastern Europe, during the late 1980s and early 1990s, there were major political changes, such as the fall of Communist governments. These societies entered a new era of increased social freedom, less rigid rules, and less authoritarian governments. They interacted with Western Europe and some became members of the European Union. As a result, the patterns of family life have started to change: marriage rates have declined, and marriage was postponed to a later age. Cohabitation and births to unmarried mothers increased, and in some countries the increase was very quick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Thornton A, Philipov D |title=Sweeping Changes in Marriage, Cohabitation, and Childbearing in Central and Eastern Europe: New Insights from the Developmental Idealism Framework |journal=Eur J Popul |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=123–156 |year=2009 |pmid=19498956 |pmc=2690230 |doi=10.1007/s10680-009-9181-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''deinstitutionalization of marriage'' refers to the weakening of the social and legal norms that regulate peoples' behavior in regard to marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3600162?uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21104370783487|title=The Deinstitutionalization of American Marriage|date=|accessdate=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rise in cohabitation is part of other major social changes such as: higher divorce rate, older age at first marriage and childbearing, and more births outside marriage. Factors such as secularization, increased participation of women in the labor force, changing in the meaning of marriage, risk reduction, individualism, and changing views on sexuality have been cited as contributing to these social changes.&lt;ref&gt;http://epc2008.princeton.edu/papers/80065&lt;/ref&gt; There has also been a change in modern [[sexual ethics]], with a focus on consent, rather than marital status (i.e. decriminalization of [[adultery]] and [[fornication]]; criminalization of [[marital rape]]), reflecting new concepts about the role and purpose of sexual interaction, and new conceptualizations of [[female sexuality]] and of self-determination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Yes Means Yes! Visions of Female Sexual Power and a World Without Rape |last=Friedman |first=Jaclyn |author2=[[Jessica Valenti]] |year=2008 |publisher=Seal Press |isbn=1-58005-257-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been objections against the legal and social regulation of female sexuality; with such regulations being often seen as violations of [[women's rights]].&lt;ref&gt;High Commissioner for Human Rights [[Navi Pillay]] has called for full respect and recognition of women's autonomy and sexual and reproductive health rights, stating: "Violations of women's human rights are often linked to their sexuality and reproductive role. Women are frequently treated as property, they are sold into marriage, into trafficking, into sexual slavery. (...) In many countries, married women may not refuse to have sexual relations with their husbands, and often have no say in whether they use contraception. (...) Ensuring that women have full autonomy over their bodies is the first crucial step towards achieving substantive equality between women and men. Personal issues - such as when, how and with whom they choose to have sex, and when, how and with whom they choose to have children - are at the heart of living a life in dignity."[http://www.chr.up.ac.za/images/files/news/news_2012/Navi%20Pillay%20Lecture%2015%20May%202012.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, some individuals may feel that marriage is unnecessary or outdated, leading to couples not formalizing their relation.&lt;ref name="researchgate.net"/&gt; For instance, in the European Values Study (EVS) of 2008, the percentage of respondents who agreed with the assertion that "Marriage is an outdated institution" was 37.5% in Luxembourg, 35.4% in France, 34.3% in Belgium, 31.2% in Spain, 30.5% in Austria, 29.2% in Germany, 27.7% in Switzerland, 27.2% in Bulgaria, 27.0% in the Netherlands, 25.0% in Slovenia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zacat.gesis.org/webview/index.jsp?study=http%3A%2F%2F193.175.238.79%3A80%2Fobj%2FfStudy%2FZA4783&amp;variable=http%3A%2F%2F193.175.238.79%3A80%2Fobj%2FfVariable%2FZA4783_V252&amp;mode=documentation&amp;submode=variable&amp;top=yes&amp;language=en] See for each country: Variable Description - Family - Q 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fact that many couples choose to live together without formalizing their relation is also recognized by the European Union. A 2004 directive forbids EU members from

==Contemporary objections to cohabitation==

Contemporary objections to cohabiting couples include religious opposition to non-marital unions, social pressure for couples to get married, and potential effects of cohabitation on a child's development.

The rise in the number of cohabiting couples and children born out of wedlock in the Western world has made cohabitation a strong focus of sociological research.&lt;ref name="germanypmc"/&gt; The rise in cohabiting couples in the United States, from around 450,000 in 1960 to 7.5 million in 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jay|first=M|title=The Downside of Cohabitation Before Marriage|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/15/opinion/sunday|accessdate=22 April 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=15 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been accompanied by US research performed on child development within cohabiting households.&lt;ref name="Dunifon"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dunifon|first=R|author2=Kowaleski-Jones, L|title=Who's in the house? race differences in cohabitation, single-parenthood, and child development|journal=Child Development|year=2002|volume=73|issue=4|url=http://ebscohost.com|accessdate=22 April 2012|doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00470|pages=1249–1264}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of cohabitation say non-marital parenting is an unsuitable environment for a child's development. One study from 2002 correlated lower numeracy skills and higher delinquency to children of cohabiting couples,&lt;ref name="Dunifon" /&gt; however, recent studies that control for factors including poverty, the educational level of parents and violence in the home show children of cohabiting couples are developmentally similar to peers of comparable married couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Coontz|first=S.|title=Cohabitation Doesn't Cause Bad Parenting|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/30/opinion|accessdate=22 April 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effect on children===

In 2001, researchers compared teenage children living in a cohabiting household against peers in single-parent households. The results showed Caucasian and Hispanic teenagers had lower performance in school, greater risk of suspension or expulsion than peers from single-parent households, and the same rate behavioral and emotional problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nelson|first=Sandi|author2=Rebecca L.

A study on the 1995 and 2002 National Survey of Family Growth found increases in both the prevalence and duration of unmarried cohabitation.&lt;ref name="pmid19119426"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy|first=Sheela|author2=Larry Bumpass|title=Cohabitation and children's living arrangements: New estimates from the United States|journal=Demographic Research|date=19 September 2008|volume=19|issue=47|pages=1663–1692|doi=10.4054/DemRes.2008.19.47|pmc=2612998|pmid=19119426}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that 40% of children in the United States would live in a cohabiting household by age 12, and children born to single mothers were more likely than those born to married mothers to live in a cohabiting household. The percentage of women ages 19–44 who had ever cohabited increased from 45% in 1995 to 54% in 2002.&lt;ref name="pmid19119426" /&gt;

In 2002, 63% of women who graduate from high school were found to spend some time cohabiting, compared to only 45% of women with a four-year college degree.&lt;ref name="pmid19119426" /&gt; Cohabiting couples who have children often get married. One study found that children born of parents who cohabit are 90% more likely to end up living in households with married parents than children born to single mothers. 67% of unmarried Hispanic mothers are expected to marry, while 40% of African American mothers are expected to marry.&lt;ref name="pmid19119426" /&gt;

==Effects on marriage and family life==

===Likelihood of split===

As premarital cohabitation occurs more frequently, there are more research participants which has led to a greater understanding of the factors of stable, lasting relationships. This has led to more possibilities and studies. The early studies, performed decades ago, did not account for the multiple factors that comprise the stability of a relationship. Researchers have found evidence that previous research into the effects of premarital cohabitation does not apply to modern relationships. New results have shown there are many factors that lead to divorce that are not cohabitation.

Conflicting studies on the effect of cohabitation on subsequent marriage have been published. In countries where the majority of people disapprove of unmarried individuals living together, or a minority of the population cohabits before marriage, marriages resulting from cohabitation are more prone to divorce. But in a study on European countries, those where around half of the population cohabits before marriage, cohabitation is not selective of divorce-prone individuals, and no difference in couples that have cohabited before and after marriage is observed.&lt;ref name="pmid16889125"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors= Liefbroer AC, Dourleijn E | title= Unmarried cohabitation and union stability: testing the role of diffusion using data from 16 European countries. | journal= Demography | year= 2006 | volume= 43 | issue= 2 | pages= 203–21 | pmid= 16889125 | doi= 10.1353/dem.2006.0018 | pmc=  | url= http://www.nidi.knaw.nl/Content/NIDI/output/2006/dem-43-02-liefbroer.pdf }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://econpapers.repec.org/article/uwpjhriss/v_3a39_3ay_3a2004_3ai_3a2_3ap523-535.htm|author=Svarer, Michael

In 2002 the [[Centers for Disease Control|CDC]] found that for married couples the likelihood percentage of the relationship ending after five years is 20%, for unmarried cohabitators the likelihood percentage is 49%. After 10 years the likelihood percentage for the relationship to end is 33% for married couples and 62% for unmarried cohabitators.

who cohabit before engagement are at greater risk for poor marital outcomes than those who

A follow-up [[Statistical survey|survey]] by the researches of over 1,000 married men and women married in the past 10 years found those who moved in with a lover before engagement or marriage reported significantly lower quality marriages and a greater possibility of a separation than other couples.
&lt;ref name="pmid19203165"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Rhoades GK, Stanley SM, Markman HJ | title=The pre-engagement cohabitation effect: a replication and extension of previous findings. | journal=J Fam Psychol | year= 2009 | volume= 23 | issue= 1 | pages= 107–11 | pmid=19203165 | doi=10.1037/a0014358 | pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=19203165  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
About 20% of those who cohabited before getting [[engagement|engaged]] had since suggested splitting – compared with only 12% of those who only moved in together after getting engaged and 10% who did not cohabit prior to marriage.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/5840263/Couples-who-live-together-before-marriage-more-likely-to-get-divorced.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Couples who live together before marriage more likely to get divorced | date=16 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The researchers from Denver suggest that relationships with pre-engagement cohabitation "may wind up sliding into marriage",&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt; whereas those that only cohabit post engagement or marriage make a more clear decision. This could explain their 2006 study of 197 heterosexual couples finding that men who cohabited with their spouse before engagement were less dedicated than men who cohabited only after engagement or not at all before marriage.&lt;ref name="pmid17176189"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Rhoades GK, Stanley SM, Markman HJ | title=Pre-engagement cohabitation and gender asymmetry in marital commitment. | journal=J Fam Psychol | year= 2006 | volume= 20 | issue= 4 | pages= 553–60 | doi=10.1037/0893-3200.20.4.553 | pmid=17176189

An analysis of data from the CDC's [[National Survey of Family Growth]] data from 1988, 1995, and 2002 suggests that the positive relationship between premarital cohabitation and marital instability has weakened for more recent birth and marriage cohorts, as the total number of couples cohabiting before marriage has increased.&lt;ref name="pmid20879685"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Reinhold S| title=Reassessing the link between premarital cohabitation and marital instability. | journal=Demography | year= 2010 | volume= 47 | issue= 3 | pages= 719–33 | pmid=20879685 | doi= 10.1353/dem.0.0122| pmc=3000053 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later CDC work found that between 2002 and 2006-2010, the number of couples in opposite-sex cohabiting relationships increased from 9.0% to 11.2% for women, and from 9.2% to 12.2% for men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nsfg/abc_list_c.htm#chabitation

Drawing on the 2006–2008 data, [[Princeton university]] researchers examined whether and to what extent variation in premarital cohabitation experiences influence marital stability. They found that the relationship between cohabitation and marital instability is complex and depends in part on marriage cohort, race/ethnicity, and marriage plans. Their analyses reveal that a 'cohabitation effect' exists only for women married prior to 1996, and that, until marriage plans are considered, there is no cohabitation effect among women married since 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Recent research from 2011 by the [[Pew Research Center]] has found that the number of couples that cohabit before marriage has increased. 44% of adults (and more than half of 30- to 49-year-olds) say they have cohabited at some point. Nearly two-thirds of adults who ever cohabited (64%) say they thought about it as a step toward marriage. The report also notes a trend toward rising public acceptance of cohabiting couples over the years. Most Americans now say the rise in unmarried couples living together either makes no difference to society (46%) or is good for society (9%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A 2012 study found that, among cohabiting individuals, those who were engaged prior to cohabitation or had "definite plans for marriage" were linked to lower risks of marital instability among women, but the relationship was not observed with men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wendy Manning |author2=Jessica Cohen | journal=[[Journal of Marriage and Family]] | title=Premarital cohabitation and marital dissolution: An examination of recent marriages|pmc=3487709 | pmid=23129875 | doi=10.1111/j.1741-3737.2012.00960.x | volume=74 | date=Apr 2012 | pages=377–387}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most cohabiting couples have a faithful relationship, but Waite's surveys also demonstrated that 20% of cohabiting women reported having secondary sex partners, compared to only 4% of married women. A 1992 study found that male members of heterosexual couples with children are less likely to be a part of the childcare but half the time they are responsible for child abuse.&lt;ref name="pmid1393717"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Margolin L| title=Child abuse by mothers' boyfriends: why the overrepresentation? | journal=Child Abuse Negl | year= 1992 | volume= 16 | issue= 4 | pages= 541–51 | doi= 10.1016/0145-2134(92)90070-8| pmc= | pmid=1393717}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fertility===
Regarding cohabitation as a [[fertility factor (demography)|fertility factor]], a large survey in the [[United States]] came to the result that [[marriage|married]] women had an average of 1.9 children, compared to 1.3 among those cohabiting. The corresponding numbers for men were 1.7 and 1.1, respectively. The difference of 0.6 children for both sexes was expected to decrease to between 0.2 and 0.3 over the lifetime when correcting for the [[confounder]] that married people have their children earlier in life.&lt;ref name=us2012&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhsr/nhsr051.pdf|title=Fertility of Men and Women Aged 15–44 Years in the United States: National Survey of Family Growth, 2006–2010|author1=Gladys Martinez |author2=Kimberly Daniels |author3=Anjani Chandra |publisher=Division of Vital Statistics, [[National Center for Health Statistics]]|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of the United States and multiple countries in Europe came to the result that women who continue to cohabit after birth have significantly lower probability of having a second child than married women in all countries except those in Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=European Journal of Population|year=2014|volume=30=issue 4|pages=437–464|title=How Similar are Cohabiting and Married Parents?

Survey data from 2003 in [[Romania]] came to the result that marriage equalized the total fertility rate among both highly educated and low educated people to approximately 1.4. Among those cohabiting, on the other hand, lower level of education increased fertility rate to 1.7, and a higher level of education decreased it to 0.7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Recent Features of Cohabitational and Marital Fertility in Romania|author1=Jan M.

===Financial effects===

In the United States, married couples that submit a combined tax return may face a [[marriage penalty]], where tax credits for low-income single earners are not applied to the combined income.
In October 1998, Senate GOP leader [[Trent Lott]] decided to pull a bill to abolish "the [[marriage penalty]]," "which in the tax code reflects the fact that married couples who both work for wages frequently pay more in taxes than if they earned the same amount of income but weren't married. And the more equal the incomes of the couple, the steeper the marriage tax penalty." &lt;ref name="americanvalues.org"&gt;Horn, W. (October 1998) Government Punishes Marriage, Pushes Cohabitation.''Institute for American Values.''  Retrieved from: {{cite web |url=http://www.americanvalues.org/html/mp8.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110803200857/http://www.americanvalues.org/html/mp8.html |archivedate=3 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[earned income tax credit]] (EITC)  is cash welfare for low-income workers, but the problem is the EITC is not for married couples because they have to combine their wages, which again leads to "the marriage penalty." If couples do not get married then their wages do not have to combine and the EITC in a way is "paying for" low-income couples not to marry. Opponents of cohabitation believe that some cohabiting couples choose not to marry because they would suffer a tax penalty.&lt;ref name="americanvalues.org"/&gt;

Despite the perceived disincentive to marry that the EITC provides, cohabiting couples suffer many financial losses as their unions are not recognized with the same legal and financial benefits as those who are legally married. These financial penalties can include the costs of separate insurance policies and the costs of setting up legal protections similar to those that are automatically granted by the state upon marriage.&lt;ref&gt;"http://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0412/why-marriage-makes-financial-sense.aspx"&lt;/ref&gt;

===No effect===

A conflicting study, published by the [[National Center for Health Statistics]], with a sample of 12,571 people, concludes that "those who live together after making plans to marry or getting engaged have about the same chances of divorcing as couples who never cohabited before marriage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jayson, Sharon |date=14 October 2010 |title=Report: Cohabiting has little effect on marriage success|work=USA Today|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2010-03-02-cohabiting02_N.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, William Doherty, a professor in the Department of Family Social Science at the University of Minnesota has remarked that in his research he has found that "committed cohabiting relationships seem to confer many of the benefits of marriage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unmarried.org/experts.html#cohabitation |title=The Experts Speak |publisher=Unmarried.org |accessdate=10 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130207003408/http://www.unmarried.org/experts.html#cohabitation |archivedate=7 February 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2003 study by the [[Australian Institute of Family Studies]] found that "The differences in measured outcomes for those from direct and indirect marriages appear to be entirely attributable to other factors." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Premarital cohabitation and subsequent marital stability

There are, however, very significant differences by province/territory; for example in 2012, 77.8% of births in [[Nunavut]] were listed to "single mothers", by contrast, less than 20% of mothers in [[Ontario]] were listed in this category.&lt;ref name="www5.statcan.gc.ca"/&gt; Latest data from the [[Institut de la statistique du Québec|Quebec Statistical Institute]] shows that as of 2015, in Quebec, 63% of children were born to unmarried women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stat.gouv.qc.ca/statistiques/population-demographie/naissance-fecondite/5p2.htm|title=Proportion de naissances hors mariage selon le rang de naissance, Québec, 1976-2016|first=Institut de la Statistique du|last=Québec|website=www.stat.gouv.qc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, legal issues regarding cohabitation are very complicated by the fact that [[family law]] in this regard differs by province/territory, which is very confusing to the public,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/4-myths-about-common-law-relationships-1.1315129|title=4 myths about common-law relationships|date=20 March 2013|publisher=|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially as this contrasts to [[criminal law]] which is the same across Canada, as well as to marriage and divorce law, which is also the same across the country, under the 1986 [[Divorce Act (Canada)]] (although provinces/territories have jurisdiction over some marital issues, including the solemnization of marriage, spousal and child support, and property division).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/fl-df/pt-tp/|title=Provincial and Territorial Government Web Sites|publisher=|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[marital status]] of Canadians also varies by province/territory: in 2011, 46.4% of the population aged 15 and over was legally married; ranging from the lowest percentage of married people being in Nunavut (29.7%), Northwest Territories (35.0%), Quebec (35.4%), and Yukon (37.6%); to highest being in Newfoundland and Labrador (52.9%), Prince Edward Island (51.7%), Ontario (50.3%) and Alberta (50.2%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/91-209-x/2013001/article/11788-eng.htm|title=Marital Status: Overview, 2011|publisher=|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While today Quebec is known for liberal family formation and cohabitation, this is a recent development: during the first half of the 20th century, family life in the province was conservative and strongly dominated by [[Roman Catholicism]]; before 1968, there was no provincial divorce legislation in Quebec, and spouses could only end their marriage if they obtained a private [[Act of Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/content/lop/researchpublications/963-e.htm|title=Divorce Law in Canada / 96-3E|publisher=|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the explanations of the current high rates of cohabitation in Quebec is that the traditionally strong social control of the church and the Catholic doctrine over people's private relations and sexual morality has led the population to rebel against traditional and conservative social values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=20058678|title=The Rise of Cohabitation in Quebec: Power of Religion and Power over Religion|date= | volume=31|pages=1–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some provinces were early to modernize family law, in others this only happened in the 1990s and the 21st century, such as in [[Alberta]], through the [[Family Law Act (Alberta)]] which came into force in 2005. This Act overhauled family legislation, replacing the Domestic Relations Act, the Maintenance Order Act, the Parentage and Maintenance Act, and parts of the Provincial Court Act and the Child, Youth and Family Enhancement Act, which were seen as outdated. Also, the [[Adult interdependent relationship in Alberta|Adult Interdependent Relationships Act (S.A. 2002, c.

This may seem quite paradoxical, because it is the eastern provinces which have the strongest tradition of cohabitation; according to a study "unmarried cohabitation seems to be more common in Eastern Canada than in Western Canada, which might be related to internal and international migration".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://paa2015.princeton.edu/uploads/150158 |title=Archived copy |access-date=23 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623211955/http://paa2015.princeton.edu/uploads/150158 |archive-date=23 June 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; (as of 2012, 48% of births in [[New Brunswick]], 47.1% in [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], and 45.2% in [[Nova Scotia]], were listed to "single mothers", way above the national average).&lt;ref name="www5.statcan.gc.ca"/&gt; In [[British Columbia]], the Family Law Act came into force in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ag.gov.bc.ca/legislation/family-law/|title=Family Law Act|publisher=|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cohabitation in the United States]] became common in the late 20th century. {{As of|2005}}, 4.85 million unmarried couples were living together, and {{as of|2002|lc=y}}, about half of all women aged 15 to 44 had lived unmarried with a partner. In 2007, it is estimated that 6.4 million households were maintained by two opposite sex persons who said they were unmarried.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cherlin|first=Andrew|title=Public and Private Families|year=2010|publisher=McGraw Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-340435-6|page=227}}=&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the General Social Survey found that public disapproval of cohabitation had dropped to 20% of the population.&lt;ref name="roper2014"/&gt;

Researchers at the National Center for Family and Marriage Research estimated in 2011 that 66% of first marriages are entered after a period of cohabitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paa2013.princeton.edu/papers/132048|title=Two Decades of Stability and Change in Age at First Union Formation|publisher=Population Association of America|date=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 2009 American Community Survey conducted by the Census Bureau, the proportion of 30- to 44-year-olds living together has almost doubled since 1999, from 4% to 7%. Fifty-eight percent of women aged 19 to 44 had ever cohabited in data collected in 2006-08, while in 1987 only 33% had. Cohabitation is more prevalent among those with less education. "Among women ages 19 to 44, 73% of those without a high school education have ever cohabited, compared with about half of women with some college (52%) or a college degree (47%)," note the Pew study's authors, Richard Fry and D'Vera Cohn.&lt;ref&gt;Luscombe, B.

Before the mid-20th century, laws against cohabitation, fornication, adultery and other such behaviors were common in the US (especially in Southern and Northeastern states), but these laws have been gradually abolished or struck down by courts as unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-201_162-2007258.html |title=N.C.

  | Cohabitation was almost impossible in the United States prior to the 1960s. Laws prevented unmarried couples from registering in hotels and it was very difficult for an unmarried couple to obtain a home mortgage. From 1960 to 1998, cohabitation moved from disreputable and difficult to normal and convenient.

On 13 December 2013, [[United States federal judge|US Federal Judge]] [[Clark Waddoups]] ruled in ''[[Brown v.

====Latin America====

Cohabitation in [[Latin America]] is becoming more common. Indeed, although this is a largely [[Roman Catholic]] region, it has the highest rates of non-marital childbearing in the world (55–74% of all children in this region are born to unmarried parents).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sustaindemographicdividend.org/articles/international-family-indicators/global-childrens-trends |title=Global Children's Trends &amp;#124; The Sustainable Demographic Dividend |publisher=Sustaindemographicdividend.org |accessdate=10 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Mexico, 18.7% of all couples were cohabiting {{as of|2005|lc=y}}. Among young people, the figures are much higher.&lt;ref name="Vanier"&gt;[[Anne-Marie Ambert]]: [http://www.vifamily.ca/sites/default/files/cohabitation_and_marriage.pdf "Cohabitation and Marriage: How Are They Related?"]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. The Vanier Institute of the Family, Fall 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2000, in [[Argentina]] 58% of births were to unmarried women.&lt;ref name="sustaindemographicdividend.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sustaindemographicdividend.org/articles/international-family-indicators/global-childrens-trends|title=Global Children’s Trends - The Sustainable Demographic Dividend|publisher=|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'''note''': "The most recent data for Argentina are from 2000 because after 2000, Argentina’s Ministry of Health changed to publishing births as mother living with a partner or not (including married or cohabiting) rather than as marital and nonmarital."&lt;/ref&gt;
The percentage of births outside marriage has increased throughout Latin America during the past decades, and there is also a relation to place of residence: women living in the capital city are more likely to have children outside marriage than those living in other parts of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcs.edu.uy/archivos/Mesa_46_Castro%20Mart%C3%ADn%20et%20al.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402091547/http://www.fcs.edu.uy/archivos/Mesa_46_Castro%20Mart%C3%ADn%20et%20al.pdf |archivedate=2 April 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent data shows figures for non-marital childbearing to be 74% for [[Colombia]], 69% for [[Peru]], 68% for [[Chile]], 66% for [[Brazil]] and 55% for [[Mexico]].&lt;ref name="sustaindemographicdividend.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://paa2013.princeton.edu/papers/131703&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nepal====
In [[Nepal]], living together is socially acceptable only after marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/3403008.html|title=Changing Family Formation in Nepal: Marriage, Cohabitation and First Sexual Intercourse|author1=Marcantonio Caltabiano |author2=Maria Castiglioni |date=9 April 2008|work=guttmacher.org|accessdate=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, cohabitation is an emerging trend in urban areas of Nepal. Reports have shown that there may be significant number of unmarried couples cohabiting in cities, especially in the capital, [[Kathmandu]]. Even when the unmarried couples cohabit they either prefer to remain anonymous or pose themselves as married couple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xnepali.net/movies/living-together-without-marriage-new-trend-in-nepali-society/|title=Living Together Without Marriage – New Trend in Nepali Society|work=Nepali Movies, Nepali Films|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cohabitation is not recognized by the law of Nepal and there is no special provision to secure the right of cohabitants in Nepalese law.

====Bangladesh====
In [[Bangladesh]] cohabitation after divorce is frequently punished by the [[salishi]] system of informal courts, especially in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;Women and Islam in Bangladesh By Taj ul-Islam Hashmi, page 112&lt;/ref&gt;

In Bangladesh, cohabitation is considered both socially and legally unacceptable, although legal grounds are not clear. An unmarried couple will feel immense pressure to marry, will probably choose to live as if they were married and, if exposed, can be expelled from housing or university&lt;ref&gt;http://www.refworld.org/docid/4f40f0072.html Refugee Review Tribunal (Australia); Research Response Number BGD32882, 12 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

====India====
[[Cohabitation in India]] had been taboo in traditional medieval Hindu and Muslim society. However, this is no longer true in large cities, but is not often found in rural areas which are more conservative. '''Live-in''' relationships are legal in India. Recent Indian court rulings have ascribed some rights to long-term cohabiting partners. Female live-in partners have economic rights under [[Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act 2005]] subject to following conditions as laid by Honourable [[Supreme Court of India]] in case of ''D. Velusamy v D. Patchaiammal'':

# The couple must hold themselves out to society as being akin to spouses.
# They must be of legal age to marry.
# They must be otherwise qualified to enter into a legal marriage, including being unmarried.
# They must have voluntarily cohabited and held themselves out to the world as being akin to spouses for a significant period of time.

====Indonesia====
In Indonesia, an Islamic penal code proposed in 2005 would have made cohabitation punishable by up to two years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/world/asia-pacific/4239177.stm | work=BBC News | title=Indonesia plans new morality laws | date=6 February 2005 | accessdate=28 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice is still frowned upon, and many hotels and boarding houses have been raided by police for allowed unmarried couples to share a room.

====Japan====
In Japan, according to M. Iwasawa at the National Institute of Population and Social Security Research, less than 3% of females between 25–29 are currently cohabiting, but more than one in five have had some experience of an unmarried partnership, including cohabitation. A more recent Iwasawa study has shown that there has been a recent emergence of non-marital cohabitation. Couples born in the 1950s cohort showed an incidence of cohabitation of 11.8%, where the 1960s and 1970s cohorts showed cohabitation rates of 30%, and 53.9% respectively. The split between urban and rural residence for people who had cohabited is indicates 68.8% were urban and 31.2% were rural.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://paa2006.princeton.edu/download.aspx?submissionId=61321 |title=Archived copy |access-date=26 August 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901174621/http://paa2006.princeton.edu/download.aspx?submissionId=61321 |archive-date=1 September 2006 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Philippines====
In the [[Philippines]], around 2.4 million Filipinos were cohabiting {{as of|2004|lc=y}}. The 2000 census placed the percentage of cohabiting couples at 19%. The majority of individuals are between the ages of 20–24. Poverty was often the main factor in decision to cohabit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gmanews.tv/wedding/tomarryornot.html :: GMA News.TV ::&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
In the [[European Union]], cohabitation is very common. In 2014, 42% of all births in the 28 EU countries were nonmarital.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;plugin=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tps00018 |title=Eurostat - Tables, Graphs and Maps Interface (TGM) table |website=Ec.europa.eu |date=2016-08-11 |accessdate=2017-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following European countries the majority of births occur outside marriage: [[Iceland]] (69.9% in 2016&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;), [[France]] (59.7% in 2016&lt;ref&gt;https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/2381394#tableau-Donnes&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Bulgaria]] (58.6% in 2016&lt;ref name="ec.europa.eu"&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;plugin=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tps00018&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Slovenia]] (58.6% in 2016&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stat.si/StatWeb/en/News/Index/6768&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Norway]] (56.2% in 2016&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;), [[Estonia]] (56.1% in 2016&lt;ref name="ec.europa.eu"/&gt;), [[Sweden]] (54.9% in 2016&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;), [[Denmark]] (54% in 2016&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;), [[Portugal]] (52.8% in 2016&lt;ref name="pordata.pt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pordata.pt/en/Portugal/Live%20births%20outside%20of%20marriage%20%20with%20parents%20co%20habiting%20or%20not%20(percentage)-620 |title=PORDATA - Live births outside of marriage, with parents co-habiting or not (%) in Portugal |website=Pordata.pt |date=2016-04-28 |accessdate=2017-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and the [[Netherlands]] (50.4% in 2016&lt;ref name="ec.europa.eu"/&gt;).
 
While couples of all ages cohabit, the phenomenon is much more common among younger people. In late 2005, 21% of families in Finland consisted of cohabiting couples (all age groups). Of couples with children, 18% were cohabiting.&lt;ref&gt;

Legal obstacles for cohabitation were removed in 1926 in a reform of the [[Criminal Code of Finland|Criminal Code]], while the phenomenon was socially accepted much later on. In France, 17.5% of couples were cohabiting as of 1999.&lt;ref name=Vanier /&gt;

====Britain====
{{main|Cohabitation in the United Kingdom}}
In Britain today, nearly half of babies are born to people who are not married (in the United Kingdom 47.3% in 2011;&lt;ref name="epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/product_details/dataset?p_product_code=TPS00018 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GpdRM2MZ?url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/product_details/dataset?p_product_code=TPS00018 |archivedate=23 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Scotland]] in 2012 the proportion was 51.3%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/files2/stats/births-marriages-deaths-quarterly/ve-2012-q4-tableq1.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617080614/http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/files2/stats/births-marriages-deaths-quarterly/ve-2012-q4-tableq1.pdf |archivedate=17 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;). It is estimated that by 2016, the majority of births in the UK will be to unmarried parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-23265810|title=Most babies born out of marriage by 2016, trend suggests|work=BBC News|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Victorian era]] of the late 19th century is famous for the Victorian standards of personal morality.  Historians generally agree that the middle classes held high personal moral standards and rejected cohabitation. They have debated whether the working classes followed suit. Moralists in the late 19th century such as [[Henry Mayhew]] decried high levels of cohabitation without marriage and illegitimate births in London slums.  However new research using computerized matching of data files shows that the rates of cohabitation were quite low—under 5% -- for the working class and the urban poor.&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Probert, "Living in Sin," ''BBC History Magazine'' (Sept 2012); G. Frost, ''Living in Sin: Cohabiting as Husband and Wife in Nineteenth-Century England'' (Manchester U.P. 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

Falling marriage rates and increased births outside marriage have become a political issue, with questions of whether the government should promote marriage or focus on the status of a parent rather than a spouse; the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] support the former whilst [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] support the latter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/research/key-issues-for-the-new-parliament/social-reform/marriage-and-cohabitation/|title=Marriage and cohabitation: key issues for the 2010 Parliament|work=UK Parliament|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also differences between [[England and Wales]] and [[Scotland]], with the latter being more accepting of cohabitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Justice/law/17867/fm-couples-root/fm-couples-cohabitation|title=Family Matters - Couples - Cohabitation|publisher=|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.familylawweek.co.uk/site.aspx?i=ed98906|title=Family Law Week: Lessons to be learned for cohabitation cases in England, says Lady Hale in Supreme Court Scottish case|publisher=|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bulgaria====

In Bulgaria, there has been a rapid increase in cohabitation after the fall of Communism. The transition from communism to market economy had a great impact on the demographic behavior of the population. After the fall of Communism, the legal and social pressure to get married has declined, and the population has started to experience new life styles.&lt;ref name="researchgate.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/200166754_Contemporary_union_formation_in_Bulgaria_the_emergence_of_cohabitation|title=Contemporary union formation in Bulgaria: the emergence of cohabitation|author=Elena von der Lippe (Koytcheva)|work=ResearchGate|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014, 58.8% of children were born to unmarried mothers.&lt;ref name="nsi.bg"&gt;http://www.nsi.bg/sites/default/files/files/pressreleases/Population2014_en_2Y19BGI.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

====Czech Republic====

The marriage rates in Czech Republic have fallen dramatically during the past decades. In the 1970s to 1980s, about 96–97% of women got married; in 2000 it was estimated that only 75% of women would ever get married.&lt;ref name="paa2004.princeton.edu"&gt;http://paa2004.princeton.edu/papers/41732&lt;/ref&gt; The [[age at first marriage]] for women has increased from being in the range of 21.4–21.8 years in the 1970s and 1980s,&lt;ref name="paa2004.princeton.edu"/&gt; to being 29.6 in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://w3.unece.org/pxweb/Dialog/Saveshow.asp?lang=1{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1990s, predictions were made by some Czech demographers that cohabitation would increase during the next decades; and indeed, there has been a marked increase in the number of people who live in non-marital couple relations.&lt;ref&gt;http://sreview.soc.cas.cz/uploads/cdc4797ec7b3175a5d3a03224384501d3dc06789_184_65hampl44.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, 48.6% of births were to unmarried women.&lt;ref name="ec.europa.eu"/&gt;

====Germany====

As in other western societies, patterns of family life have been changing in Germany during the past decades. This has not created a moral panic, but has been seen more as an ongoing social evolution.&lt;ref name="lawfamger"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lawfam.oxfordjournals.org/content/15/1/88.short|title=Cohabitation in Germany - rules, reality and public discourses|date=|work=oxfordjournals.org|accessdate=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cohabitation, divorce rates, lone parents, and people's reluctance to marry or to have children have increased.&lt;ref name="lawfamger"/&gt; However, when it comes to family formation and long term cohabitation instead of marriage, there are very strong differences between the regions of former [[West Germany]] and [[East Germany]] (which was formally Communist). Significantly more children are born out of wedlock in eastern Germany than in western Germany. In 2012, in eastern Germany 61.6% of births were to unmarried women, while in western Germany only 28.4% were.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.demographic-research.org/volumes/vol33/9/33-9.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Panel data|longitudinal survey]] found that union stability was significantly higher for cohabiting mothers in eastern Germany than western Germany, due to differences in German society.&lt;ref name="germanypmc"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schnor C |title=The Effect of Union Status at First Childbirth on Union Stability: Evidence from Eastern and Western Germany |journal=Eur J Popul |volume=30 |issue= |pages=129–160 |year=2014 |pmid=24882913 |pmc=4037585 |doi=10.1007/s10680-013-9304-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Greece====
In [[Greece]], family dynamics remain conservative. The principal form of partnership is marriage, and extramarital childbearing and long term cohabitation are not widespread. For instance, in 2016 only 9.4% of births were outside marriage, which is the lowest percentage among the European Union member states.&lt;ref name="europa.eu1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tps00018&amp;plugin=1|title=Eurostat - Tables, Graphs and Maps Interface (TGM) table|website=ec.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Religion in Greece]] plays a very important role in society; it was only in 1983 that [[civil marriage]] was introduced in the country. The new laws modernized [[family law]], abolished [[dowry]], and provided for equal rights for "[[Legitimacy (family law)|illegitimate]]" children.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Marcos, Anastasios C, and Bahr, Stephen J.

====Hungary====
The literature on [[second demographic transition]] argues as well that highly educated women are more prone to engage in cohabitation, although the reasons are different: they are less concerned with respecting the societal norms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lesthaeghe | first1 = R | year = 1983 | title = A Century of Demographic and Cultural Change in Western Europe: an Exploration of Underlying Dimensions | url = | journal = Population and Development Review | volume = 9 | issue = 3| pages = 411–435 | doi=10.2307/1973316}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars argued that cohabitation is very similar to being single in the sense of not giving up independence and personal autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rindfuss | first1 = R.R | last2 = van del Heuve | first2 = A. | year = 1990 | title = Cohabitation: A precursor to marriage or an alternative to being single? | url = | journal = Population and Development Review | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 703–726 | doi=10.2307/1972963}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hungary, cohabitation was an uncommon phenomenon until the late 1980s and it was largely confined to the divorced or widowed individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Carlson | first1 = E. | last2 = KJingerA | first2 =  | year = 1987 | title = Partners in life: Unmarried couples \nHnx\^ziy | url = | journal = European Journal of Population | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 85–99 | doi=10.1007/bf01797093}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the ethnic groups, Gypsy/Rroma tended to have higher rates of cohabitation, mainly due to their reluctance to register their marriages officially.&lt;ref&gt;Barany. Zoltan. (2002). ''The East European Gypsies. Regime Change. Marginality, and Ethnopolitics''. Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the 1980s, cohabitation became much more frequent among all ethnic groups and it has been argued to have strongly influenced the decline in fertility.&lt;ref&gt;Speder. Z. (2001). [http://www.dpa.demografia.hu "Turning Points of the Life Course"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224135228/http://www.dpa.demografia.hu/ |date=24 December 2008 }} Retrieved 7 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015, 47.9% of births were to unmarried women.&lt;ref name="europa.eu1"/&gt;

====Ireland====

[[File:Magdalen-asylum.jpg|200px|thumb|Irish [[Magdalene laundries|Magdalene Laundry]], {{circa|lk=no}} early 1900s. Women who had sexual relations outside marriage were often sent to Magdalene laundries until the mid-20th century]]

Cohabitation in Ireland has increased in recent years, and 36.6% of births were to unmarried women in 2016.&lt;ref name="ec.europa.eu"/&gt; Until a few decades ago, women who had children outside marriage were severely stigmatized and often detained in [[Magdalene laundries]]. The [[Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010]] gives some rights to unmarried cohabitants (under this act same-sex couples can enter into [[civil partnerships]], while long term unmarried couples – both heterosexual and same sex – who have not registered their relation have some limited rights and obligations).

====Italy====

In [[Italy]], where [[Roman Catholicism]] had a historically strong presence, cohabitation is not as common as in other countries of Europe, yet it has increased in recent years. There are significant regional differences, with non-marital unions being more common in the [[Northern Italy|North of the country]] than in [[Southern Italy]]. A study published in 2006 found that long term cohabitation was still novel to Italy, though more common among young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/29789325?sid=21105187401371&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3738920|title=Cohabitation in Italy: do parents matter?|date=|accessdate=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015, the share of births outside marriage was 28.7%, but this varied by statistical regions as follows: [[Central Italy]] (33.8%), [[Northeast Italy]] (33.1%), [[Northwest Italy]] (31.3%), [[Insular Italy]] (24.2%), and [[South Italy]] (20.3%).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.istat.it/it/files/2016/11/Statistica-report-Nati.pdf?title=Natalit%C3%A0+e+fecondit%C3%A0++-+28%2Fnov%2F2016+-+Testo+integrale+e+nota+metodologica.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Netherlands====

Dutch researchers have found that research participants see cohabitation as a risk-reduction strategy in a country with high relationship instability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.demographic-research.org/volumes/vol32/10/32-10.pdf|title=Risk-avoidance or utmost commitment?

====Norway====

Cohabitation is a common type of partnership in Norway. Cohabitants have some rights if they have joint children, or if they have lived together for five years. Cohabitants can also regulate their relationship through a [[cohabitation agreement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyinorge.no/en/Familiegjenforening/New-in-Norway/Families-and-children-in-Norway-/Families-and-children-in-Norway/Cohabitation/|title=Cohabitation|publisher=|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Norway, in 2016, 56.2% of children were born outside marriage.&lt;ref name="europa.eu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;plugin=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tps00018|title=Eurostat - Tables, Graphs and Maps Interface (TGM) table|publisher=|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Poland====
In Poland, after the fall of Communism, the influence of religion has increased. Indeed, Poland has one of the most religious populations in Europe (see [[religion in Europe]]). Cohabitation in Poland has traditionally been associated with the lower social classes, but in recent years an increase has been seen among the more educated. Family structure in Poland remains traditional: Marriages are contracted at relatively young ages, and the incidence of divorce is relatively low (by European standards). The exact incidence of cohabitation is not well established, but it is quite low compared to other Western countries. However, Poland is not completely 'immune' to Western influence and, in 2016, 25% of children were born outside marriage.&lt;ref name="europa.eu1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.demographic-research.org/volumes/vol21/8/21-8.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

====Slovakia====
Slovakia is more conservative and religious than neighboring Czech Republic. The principal form of partnership is marriage, but extramarital childbearing and cohabitation are slowly spreading, yet this trend is not without criticism; and some view these phenomena as a threat to traditional values.&lt;ref name="demographic-research.org"&gt;http://www.demographic-research.org/volumes/vol19/25/19-25.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oeaw.ac.at/vid/download/col100319mp.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726132730/http://www.oeaw.ac.at/vid/download/col100319mp.pdf |archivedate=26 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, 40.2% of births were to unmarried women.&lt;ref name="europa.eu1"/&gt; Fertility in Slovakia has been described in a 2008 study as "between tradition and modernity".&lt;ref name="demographic-research.org"/&gt;

====Switzerland====
{{Switzerland Cantons Labelled Map|float=right}}
[[Switzerland]] has a tradition of strong conservatism; which can be seen in its legal and social history: in Europe, Switzerland was one  of the last countries to establish gender equality in marriage: married women's rights were severely restricted until 1988, when legal reforms providing gender equality in marriage, abolishing the legal authority of the husband, come into force (these reforms had been approved in 1985 by voters in a [[Voting in Switzerland|referendum]], who narrowly voted in favor with 54.7% of voters approving).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/23/world/swiss-grant-women-equal-marriage-rights.html|title=SWISS GRANT WOMEN EQUAL MARRIAGE RIGHTS|first=Special To The New York|last=Times|date=23 September 1985|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-17988450|title=Switzerland profile - Timeline|date=28 December 2016|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history-switzerland.geschichte-schweiz.ch/chronology-womens-right-vote-switzerland.html|title=The Long Way to Women's Right to Vote in Switzerland: a Chronology|first=Markus G.

Births outside marriage are most common in the French speaking part (highest percentage in the cantons of [[Vaud]], [[Canton of Neuchâtel|Neuchâtel]], [[Canton of Geneva|Geneva]], [[Canton of Jura|Jura]]) and least common in the eastern German speaking cantons (lowest percentage in the cantons of [[Canton of St. Gallen|St. Gallen]], [[Canton of Zug|Zug]], [[Appenzell Innerrhoden]], [[Appenzell Ausserrhoden]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/fr/index/themen/01/06/blank/key/02/03.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-04-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160411103759/http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/fr/index/themen/01/06/blank/key/02/03.html |archivedate=11 April 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Spain====

Spanish society has undergone major changes since the fall of the [[Francoist Spain|Franco regime]]. Important legal changes which have occurred throughout the 1970s and 1980s include legalization of [[divorce]], decriminalization of [[adultery]], [[gender equality]] in [[family law]], and removing the ban on [[contraception]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/spain/43.htm|title=Spain - SOCIAL VALUES AND ATTITUDES|publisher=|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The liberalization of the political climate has allowed for alternative family formation. In the mid-1990s, cohabitation in Spain was still described as a "marginal" phenomenon, but since the 1990s, cohabitation has increased dramatically in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.demographic-research.org/volumes/vol32/5/32-5.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In Spain, in 2016, 45.9% of births were outside marriage.&lt;ref name="ec.europa.eu"/&gt; As in other countries, there are regional differences: in 2011, in [[Catalonia]] the figure was 42% – highest in mainland Spain in that year ([[Canary Islands]] 59% and [[Balearic Islands]] 43.5% were highest) while in [[Region of Murcia|Murcia]] it was only 30.7% (lowest).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.republica.com/2013/01/17/mas-de-un-tercio-de-los-nacimientos-en-espana-fuera-del-matrimonio/|title=Más de un tercio de los nacimientos en España, fuera del matrimonio|work=Republica.com|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Russia====

In Russia, many couples express a desire to cohabit before marriage, then register a civil marriage, and then at a later stage have a large church wedding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.demographic-research.org/volumes/vol32/11/32-11.pdf|title=Trust, responsibility, and freedom: Focus-group research on contemporary patterns of union formation in Russia|author=Olga Isupova|volume=32|work=Demographic Research|doi=10.4054/DemRes.2015.32.11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle East===
The cohabitation rate in West Asian countries is much lower than in European countries. In some parts of the continent it is however becoming more common for young people.

'''Credentialism and educational inflation''' are any of a number of related processes involving increased demands for formal educational qualifications, and the devaluation of these qualifications. In Western society, there have been increasing requirements for formal qualifications or certification for jobs, a process called credentialism that is not easily differentiated from [[professionalization]]. This process has, in turn, led to credential inflation (also known as credential creep, academic inflation or degree inflation), the process of [[inflation]] of the minimum credentials required for a given job and the simultaneous devaluation of the value of diplomas and degrees. These trends are also associated with [[grade inflation]], a tendency to award progressively higher academic grades for work that would have received lower grades in the past. In countries in the [[Middle East]], where the rulers have traditionally used public sector jobs as a form of political appeasement for the middle classes, this has resulted in many youth seeking university degrees that are only suited for work in public sector roles, making them unqualified for private sector roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/2193-9020-3-6 |title=Making sense of Arab labor markets: The enduring legacy of dualism |journal=Iza Journal of Labor &amp; Development |volume=3 |pages=6 |year=2014 |last1=Assaad |first1=Ragui }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are some occupations which used to require a [[high school diploma]], such as [[construction|construction supervisors]], loans officers, insurance clerks and [[executive assistant]]s,&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/catherine-rampell-the-college-degree-has-become-the-new-high-school-degree/2014/09/08/e935b68c-378a-11e4-8601-97ba88884ffd_story.html|title=The college degree has become the new high school degree|website=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; that are increasingly requiring a [[bachelor's degree]]. Some jobs that formerly required candidates to have a bachelor's degree, such as becoming a Director in the federal government,&lt;ref&gt;Some positions of Director in the Canadian federal government, an entry-level Executive position, which formerly required a bachelor's degree began requiring a master's degree as the minimum credential in the 2000s&lt;/ref&gt; tutoring students, or being a history tour guide in a historic site,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/24/education/edlife/edl-24masters-t.html|title=The Master's as the New Bachelor's|first=Laura|last=Pappano|date=22 July 2011|publisher=|via=www.nytimes.com|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; now require a [[master's degree]]. As well, some jobs that used to require a master's degree, such as junior [[scientific researcher]] positions and [[sessional lecturer]] jobs, now require a [[Ph.D]]. Finally, some jobs that formerly required only a Ph.D, such as [[Professor|university professor]] positions, are increasingly requiring one or more [[postdoctoral fellowship]] appointments.  Furthermore, the increasingly global nature of competitions for high-level positions is another cause of credential creep.

==Credentialism and professionalization==
{{See also|Professionalization}}

Credentialism is a reliance on formal qualifications or certifications to determine whether someone is permitted to undertake a task, speak as an expert&lt;ref&gt;"Credentialism." International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences. 2008. Retrieved 12 December 2014 from Encyclopedia.com: http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3045300482.html&lt;/ref&gt; or work in a certain field. It has also been defined as "excessive reliance on credentials, especially [[academic degree]]s, in determining hiring or promotion policies.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/credentialism|title=the definition of credentialism|website=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Credentialism has also been defined as occurring where the credentials for a job or a position are upgraded, even though there is no skill change that makes this increase necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.hodder.co.uk/Books/detail.page?isbn=9781473601147|title=Tony Buon - The Leadership Coach: Teach Yourself - Hodder &amp; Stoughton|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professionalization is the social process by which any [[trade]] or occupation is transformed into a true "[[profession]] of the highest integrity and competence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Nilsson |first= Henrik |title= Professionalism, Lecture 5, What is a Profession? |publisher=[[University of Nottingham]] |date=n.d.| url=http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~nhn/G52GRP/LectureNotes/lecture05-4up.pdf |accessdate=2007-08-05|format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926100028/http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~nhn/G52GRP/LectureNotes/lecture05-4up.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate=2007-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process tends to involve establishing acceptable [[Professional certification|qualifications]], a [[professional body]] or association to oversee the conduct of members of the [[profession]] and some degree of demarcation of the qualified from unqualified [[amateurs]]. This creates "a hierarchical divide between the knowledge-authorities in the professions and a deferential citizenry."&lt;ref name="polaris.gseis.ucla.edu"&gt;{{|0=15 May 2015 }} ''What Is Conservatism and What Is Wrong with It?'' Philip E. Agre, August 2004&lt;/ref&gt; This demarcation is often termed "[[occupational closure]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/344121 |title=Why do Some Occupations Pay More than Others?

===Development===
Over the past sixty years in the Western world, and more recently in developing countries, there has been significant growth in the number of people who have educational credentials, an increase in the number of credentialing bodies, and a growth in the use of educational credentials as a way of selecting people for employment.&lt;ref name=BuonCompton1990&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/103841119002800413 |title=Credentials, Credentialism and Employee Selection |journal=Asia Pacific Journal of Human Resources |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=126–132 |year=1990 |last1=Buon |first1=T. |last2=Compton |first2=B. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist [[Tony Buon]] has stated that in demanding credentials for certain occupations, employers' reasons fall into two rather crude categories:
# The Investment Effect-credentials show that the applicant has undergone certain educational training that has made the applicant more productive. 
# The Screening Effect-education, and hence credentials, indicate certain attributes in the applicant that the employer wants.

Buon cautions that this is an uneasy dichotomy and that it is probable that in every case, to some extent, the screening and the investment effect would co-exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;user=yqRdxs0AAAAJ&amp;citation_for_view=yqRdxs0AAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC|title=Occupational Credentialism: Employers' Use of Educational Credentials for the Selection of Training Professionals|first=Tony|last=Buon|date=21 April 1993|publisher=|via=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An employer may require a [[diploma]], [[Licensure|professional license]] or academic degree for a job which can be done by applying skills acquired through experience, informal study, or less extensive study. One example is the requirement by some [[investment bank]]s that new hires have an [[M.Sc.]] in [[Economics]]. Jobs that, in the past, required a high school diploma (such as entry level [[policy analyst]]s in the government) increasingly require a B.A. degree or even an M.A. during the screening process.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Credentialism can be lessened if certification accurately reflects actual skill competencies and expectations of those skill competencies. As [[Tony Buon]] &amp; Bob Compton (1990) state, given that the entire recruitment process is aimed at predicting future success, it does not make a great deal of sense to rely on only one indicator (i.e. educational credentials).&lt;ref name=BuonCompton1990/&gt; The results of at least one study support this view, and suggest that employers see experience as a better indication of potential work performance than educational credentials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aitd.com.au/resources-for-training-and-development-professionals/articles-and-information|title=The Australian Institute of Training and Development|first=|last=Enjin|website=www.aitd.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social status===
The term "credentialism" also refers to an over-emphasis on certificates and degrees as a way of determining [[social status]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sociologydictionary.org/credentialism/|title=credentialism definition: Free Sociology Dictionary: credentialism defined|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Credentialism can lead to [[credential inflation]]. Sociologist Randall Collins' 1979 book ''The Credential Society'' "examine[s] the connection between credentialism and [[social stratification|stratification]]." &lt;ref&gt;Boundless. "The Credentialized Society." Boundless Sociology. Boundless, 14 Nov. 2014. Retrieved 8 Jan. 2015 from https://www.boundless.com/sociology/textbooks/boundless-sociology-textbook/education-13/the-conflict-perspective-101/the-credentialized-society-571-3192/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150108175612/https://www.boundless.com/sociology/textbooks/boundless-sociology-textbook/education-13/the-conflict-perspective-101/the-credentialized-society-571-3192/ |date=8 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Credential creep==
'''Credential creep''' is the process of [[inflation]] of the minimum job requirement. This may happen when a professional organization increases the entry to practice requirements for the profession, or it may be the result of "one-upmanship" among candidates for a job, creating a kind of [[de facto]] increase in required credentials for a position.

In the early 20th century, an individual with a high school diploma could essentially work as a banking professional and rise to the ranks of a branch manager or to even branch [[president]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}. However, the quest for further education, the [[industrial revolution]] and the subsequent surge in national population in the US in the mid-20th century resulted in a professional transposition{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}. In the process, the [[bachelor’s degree]] supplanted the standing of high-school training, and the credentials required for certain positions increased.  This occurrence continued up to the end of the last century; as a furtherance of this trend based on the same conditions, the early years of the 21st century saw the [[master’s degree]] displacing the bachelor's degree in some job-entry positions.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

For instance, in the late 1980s, a bachelor's degree was the standard ticket to enter the profession of physical therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Credential-Creep/25476|title=Credential Creep|journal=The Chronicle of Higher Education|date=22 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1990s, a master's degree was expected. Today, a [[doctorate]] is becoming the norm. This change was due to the explosion of bachelor's degrees spurred by the rise in knowledge exchange—hinged on population growth and technological innovation. With the advent of [[globalization]], recent years see the Ph.D. taking over the role of the master's degree—especially [[professional degree]]s. Universities are currently reporting significant renewed interest in their graduate programs, with a particular focus on Ph.D. study, as candidates consider [[retraining]] or adding new skills to their resumes that will benefit them if the economic situation improves.  What once was considered to be specific training for the academic profession and open to a minor assemblage of individuals absorbed in research has become a benchmark for some job-entry positions.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} This change is forcing individuals to push for more advanced degrees to be considered for some positions.

The creeping-credentials phenomenon has resulted in the growth in the higher-education industry, with institutions expanding their offerings beyond the traditional graduate degrees.  Offerings now include increasingly narrow, job-specific training courses.  Degrees aimed at working professionals often come with very high tuition pricing.

Another consequence of credential creep is the increased time spent in school, with the resulting deferment of career establishment.

==Academic inflation==
"Academic inflation", or "education inflation," is the process of [[inflation]] of the minimum job requirement, and the simultaneous growing number of higher educated persons. This results in an excess of [[college]]-educated individuals with lower degrees (associate and bachelor's degrees), and even higher qualifications (master's or doctorate degrees), competing for too few jobs that require these degrees, and devaluation of educational degrees. This condition causes an intensified race for higher qualification and education in a society where a bachelor's degree today is no longer sufficient to gain employment in the same jobs that may have only required a two- or four-year degree in former years.&lt;ref&gt;Vedder, R. [http://chronicle.com/blogs/innovations/the-great-college-degree-scam/28067 The Great College-Degree Scam], [[The Chronicle of Higher Education]], December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Inflation has occurred in the minimum degree requirements for jobs, to the level of master's degrees, Ph.D.s, and post-doctoral, even where advanced degree knowledge is not absolutely necessary to perform the required job.

Academic inflation occurs when university graduates take up work that was not formerly done by graduates of a certain level, and higher-degree holders continue to migrate to this particular occupation until it eventually becomes a field known as a "graduate profession" and the minimum job requirements have been inflated academically for low-level job tasks.&lt;ref name=Rowntree&gt;Rowntree, 'Assessing Students: How Shall We Know Them?', Routledge  Grading 1987, page 19, {{ISBN|1-85091-300-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an effect of [[overeducation]].

The institutionalizing of professional education has resulted in fewer and fewer opportunities for young people to work their way up from artisan to professional status (e.g., as an engineer) by "learning on the job". Academic inflation leads employers to put more and more faith into certificates and diplomas awarded on the basis of other people's assessments.&lt;ref name=Rowntree/&gt;

The term "academic inflation" was popularized by Sir Ken Robinson in his [[TED Talk]] entitled "Schools Kill Creativity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rispin|first=Kenith|title=Academic Inflation – Disaster in the Work Place|url=http://www.keithrispin.com/education/academic-inflation-knowledge-gone-wrong/|accessdate=4 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160731182703/http://www.keithrispin.com/education/academic-inflation-knowledge-gone-wrong/|archive-date=31 July 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all|date=2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Robinson|first=Ken|title=Schools Kill Creativity|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic inflation is similar to inflation of paper currencies where too much currency chases too few commodities.&lt;ref&gt;Day et al., ''Issues in Educational Drama'', Taylor &amp; Francis, 1983, page 12, {{ISBN|0-905273-66-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Credential inflation or degree inflation==
Credential inflation refers to the devaluation of educational or academic credentials over time and a corresponding decrease in the expected advantage given a degree holder in the job market. Credential inflation is thus similar to [[inflation|price inflation]], and  describes the declining value of earned certificates and degrees.  Credential inflation has been recognized as an enduring trend over the past century in Western [[higher education]], and is also known to have occurred in ancient China and Japan, and at Spanish universities of the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Randall Collins, 2000.

===Indications===
A good example of credential inflation is the decline in the value of the US [[high school diploma]] since the beginning of the 20th century, when it was held by less than 10 percent of the population. At the time, high school diplomas attested to middle-class respectability, and for many years even provided access to managerial level jobs. More recently, however, the high school diploma barely qualifies the graduate for manual or menial service work.&lt;ref name="Randall Collins 2002 pages 23-46"&gt;Randall Collins, "Credential Inflation and the Future of Universities," Chapter One of ''The Future of the City of Intellect: The Changing American University'', edited by Steven Brint (Stanford University Press, 2002), pages 23-46.&lt;/ref&gt;

One indicator of credential inflation is the relative decline in the wage differential between those with college degrees and those with only high school diplomas.&lt;ref name=WesselWSJ&gt;David Wessel, Why It Takes a Doctorate To Beat Inflation, ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', 19 October 2006, page A2.&lt;/ref&gt; An additional indicator is the gap between the credentials requested by employers in job postings and the qualifications of those already in those occupations. A 2014 study in the United States found, for example, that 65% of job postings for executive secretaries and executive assistants now call for a bachelor's degree, but only 19% of those currently employed in these roles have a degree.&lt;ref name="burning-glass.com"&gt;[http://burning-glass.com/research/credentials-gap/] Burning Glass Technologies, "Moving the Goalposts: How Demand for a Bachelor’s Degree Is Reshaping the Workforce," Sept. 2014, accessed 2016-06-12&lt;/ref&gt; Jobs that were open to high school graduates decades ago now routinely require higher education as well—without an appreciable change in required skills.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ets.org/Media/Research/pdf/PICJOBS.pdf] Educational Testing Service, "What Jobs Require: Literacy, Education, and Training 1940-2006", published January 2000, accessed 2016-06-12&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, such as IT help desk roles, a study found there was little difference in advertised skill requirements between jobs requiring a college and those that do not.&lt;ref name="burning-glass.com"/&gt;

A predictable result of credential inflation is a glut of the credential markets and overschooling. It is estimated that 30 percent of the college graduates in 2005 will be forced into jobs that do not require a degree.&lt;ref&gt;David F. Labaree, ''How to Succeed in School without Really Learning: The Credentials Race in American Education'', Yale University Press (1997), pages 71-72. A good example of this is the "Ph.D. glut," or the oversupply of terminal degrees at levels in excess of what the job market requires for certain disciplines. Gary North, The Ph.D Glut Revisited, 24 January 2006 [http://archive.lewrockwell.com/north/north427.html]&lt;/ref&gt; M.B.A. or M.A. holders may end up working as store clerks or servers.

===Causes===
{{weasel-words|date=April 2012}}
The causes of credential inflation are controversial, but it is generally thought to be the result of a strong push for education in the 1980s and 90's along with increased technological access to higher education. This has resulted in entry level jobs requesting a bachelor's (or higher) degree when they were once open to high school graduates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Furlong|first=Andy|title=Youth Studies: An Introduction|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=9780415564762|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Potential sources of credential inflation include: degree requirements by employers, self-interest of individuals and families, increased standards of living which allow for additional years of education, high unemployment which spurs the need for competitive advantages in the job market, cultural pushes for being educated, and the availability of taxpayer-funded and guaranteed federal student loans which allow many more individuals to obtain degrees and/or credentials than could otherwise afford to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Randall Collins,  1979. The Credential Society: An Historical Sociology of Education and Stratification. New York: Academic Press. [http://media.pfeiffer.edu/lridener/courses/COLLINR2.HTML]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David K. Brown, "The Social Sources of Educational Credentialism: Status Cultures, Labor Markets, and Organizations," ''Sociology of Education'', Extra Issue (2001): 19-34.&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, the internal dynamics of credential inflation threaten higher education initiatives around the world because credential inflation appears to operate independently of market demand for credentials.&lt;ref&gt;David F. Labaree, ''How to Succeed in School without Really Learning: The Credentials Race in American Education'', Yale University Press (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; Credential markets themselves, as described by [[Signalling (economics)|signalling theory]], use earned degrees as a measure of ability in screening potential employees. This is because employers take it for granted that degrees are positively correlated with greater ability. (See Michael Spence's job-market signalling model.)

Although credential inflation has been acknowledged for years by institutions of higher education, a clear solution or consensus on how to address the problem has not yet been found or agreed upon. Academic institutions are generally expected to provide education to qualified applicants who desire admission, and many economists and politicians find the idea of government regulations on private hiring practices to be a large overstep in combating the issue.

The push for more Americans to get a higher education rests on the idea that those without a college degree are less employable. Many critics of higher education, in turn, complain that a surplus of college graduates has produced an "employer's market". A wide range of occupations have seen their academic requirements raised to the next level, even if only to reduce the number of applications that personnel departments must consider.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Problems ===
Credential inflation is a controversial topic. There is very little consensus on how, or if, this type of inflation impacts higher education, the job market, and salaries. Some common concerns discussed in this topic are:

* College [[tuition]] and fee increases have been blamed on degree inflation, though the current data do not generally support this assertion &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usnews.com/education/articles/2009/01/15/the-surprising-causes-of-those-college-tuition-hikes |title= The Surprising Causes of Those College Tuition Hikes  |last=Clark |first=Kim |date=January 15, 2009 |website= www.usnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Presentation of Chris Rasmussen, Director of Policy Research, Midwestern Higher Education Compact, at Loyola University, Chicago, Illinois, before the US Department of Education, on 5 October 2006. Transcript page 174.
http://www2.ed.gov/policy/highered/reg/hearulemaking/2007/transcript-il.doc&lt;/ref&gt;
* Credential-driven students may be less engaged than those who are attending college for personal enrichment&lt;ref&gt;David F. Labaree, ''How to Succeed in School without Really Learning: The Credentials Race in American Education'', Yale University Press (1997), pages 32, 50, 259.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Devaluation of high school diplomas &lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"/&gt;
* [[Opportunity cost]]s of attending graduate school, which can include delayed savings, less years in work force (and less earnings), and postponement of starting families &lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Fthecollegebubble%2F2014%2F05%2F21%2Fdo-the-math-how-opportunity-costs-multiply-tuition%2F&amp;usg=AFQjCNHPEGFSEZ2KlI063Tox88ukIZHB5Q&amp;sig2=sTLxKLxg2sXPNbtO48f1Mg&lt;/ref&gt;
* Lack of adequately trained faculty and rises in the number of [[adjunct professor]]s which can adversely impact quality of education &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/making-sense/when-a-college-contracts-adjunctivitis-its-the-students-who-lose/|title=When a college contracts 'adjunctivitis,' it's the students who lose|website=PBS NewsHour|date=2014-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Grade inflation]] has been correlated to degree inflation by some academics, though the causal direction is debated &lt;ref name="Randall Collins 2002 pages 23-46"/&gt;
* Some have accused degree inflation of devaluating job and employment experience, though most data show that degrees are not as highly sought after as relevant experience, which is the cited reason for student loan debt that cannot be paid back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inflationdata.com/articles/2012/09/03/college-degree-academic-inflation/|title=The College Degree and Academic Inflation|date=3 September 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grade inflation==
{{main|Grade inflation}}
Grade inflation is the tendency to award progressively higher [[Grade (education)|academic grades]] for work that would have received lower grades in the past. It is frequently discussed in relation to [[education in the United States]], and to [[GCSEs]] and [[Advanced Level (UK)|A levels]] in [[England and Wales]]. It is also an issue in [[Canada]] and many other nations, especially Australia and New Zealand.

===Problems ===
*It reduces the incentive for students to excel, since such [[excellence]] is no longer reflected in their [[Transcript (education)|transcript]]s.
*It undermines the [[corrective feedback]] function of grading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Leef| first =George| title =Grade Inflation Eats Away at the Meaning of College| website =Foundation for Economic Education| date =21 April 2016| url =https://fee.org/articles/grade-inflation-eats-away-at-the-meaning-of-college/| accessdate = 7 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*It is not uniform between schools. This places students in more stringently graded schools and departments at an unfair disadvantage, unless employers take into account a [[College and university rankings|school's ranking]].
*It is not uniform among disciplines.
*It makes it more difficult to compare students who took their exams at different times.
*Prospective employers must rely on indicators other than grades, such as [[internship]]s and [[work experience]], in order to gauge a graduate's [[aptitude]] and [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Princeton University]] took a rare stand against grade inflation in 2004, and publicly announced a policy designed to curb it. The policy states that "A" grades should account for less than 35% of the grades for undergraduate courses, and less than 55% of grades for junior and senior independent work. The standard by which the grading record of each department or program is evaluated is the percentage of "A" grades given over the previous three years.&lt;ref name="Princeton2"&gt;{{Citation

===Arguments against the existence of grade inflation===
* In 1995, Clifford Adelman, a senior research analyst for the U.S. Department of Education, reviewed student transcripts from more than 3,000 universities and reported that student grades have actually declined slightly over the last 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ericdigests.org/2005-1/grade.htm|title=Grade Inflation in Higher Education. ERIC Digest.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A report issued by the National Center for Education Statistics surveyed all 16.5 million undergraduate students in the US in the year 1999–2000.  The study concluded that 28.9% of graduates received mostly "C" grades or lower, while only 14.5% received mostly "A" grades. These results conform to grading based upon a normal distribution.&lt;ref&gt;http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2002/2002168.PDF pg. 68&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dege &amp; Skinner''' are a [[bespoke]] [[gentleman]]'s [[tailor]] located at 10 [[Savile Row]], [[London]].  Founded in 1865, they are one of the oldest, continually operated bespoke tailoring companies in the world. They possess the unique distinction of having the Row's first and only on-site, bespoke shirt service.&lt;ref name="D&amp;S"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dege-skinner.co.uk/bespoke-shirt-making/our-shirt-making|title=Our Shirt Making|publisher=Dege &amp; Skinner|accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Wiktionary|destiny}}{{Wiktionary|fate}}
'''Destiny''', sometimes referred to as '''fate''' (from [[Latin]] ''fatum'' – destiny), is a predetermined course of events. &lt;ref name=Raphals&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lisa Raphals|authorlink1=|title=Philosophy East and West|date=4 October 2003|publisher=University of Hawai'i Press|pages=537–574|edition=Volume 53}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Compare ''[[determinism]]'', the [[philosophy|philosophical]] [[proposition]] that every event, including human cognition and behavior, is [[causality|causally]] determined by an unbroken [[chain of prior occurrences]].&lt;/ref&gt; It may be conceived as a predetermined future, whether in general or of an individual.

==Fate==
[[File:Alphonse Mucha - Fate.jpg|thumb|''Fate'', by [[Alphonse Mucha]]]]
Although often used interchangeably, the words [[wiktionary:fate|"fate"]] and "destiny" have distinct connotations.

* Traditional usage defines fate as a power or agency that predetermines and orders the course of events. Fate defines events as ordered or "inevitable" and unavoidable. This is a concept based on the belief that there is a fixed [[Natural order (philosophy)|natural order]] to the universe, and in some conceptions, the [[cosmos]]. Classical and European mythology feature personified "fate spinners," known as the [[Moirai]] in Greek mythology,&lt;ref name=Dietrich&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dietrich|first1=B.C.|title=The Spinning of Fate in Homer|date=1962|pages=86–101}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Parcae]] in Roman mythology, and the [[Norns]] in Norse mythology. They determine the events of the world through the [[Weaving (mythology)|mystic spinning of threads]] that represent individual human fates. Fate is often conceived as being divinely inspired.{{cn|date=September 2015}}
* Destiny is used with regard to the finality of events as they have worked themselves out; and to that same sense of "destination", projected into the future to become the flow of events as they will work themselves out.{{cn|date=September 2015}}
* [[Fatalism]] refers to the belief that events fixed by fate are unchangeable by any type of human agency. In other words, humans can not alter their own fates or the fates of others.&lt;ref name=Raphals /&gt;

==Fortune==
Fortune differs terminologically from destiny and fate in that it has more to do with specific occurrences and outcomes, whereas destiny ultimately revolves around death rather than the events of one’s life. In [[Hellenistic civilization]], the chaotic and unforeseeable turns of [[chance (philosophy)|chance]] gave increasing prominence to a previously less notable goddess, [[Tyche]] (literally "[[Luck]]"), who embodied the good fortune of a city and all whose lives depended on its security and prosperity, two good qualities of life that appeared to be out of human reach. The Roman image of [[Fortuna]], with the wheel she blindly turned, was retained by Christian writers, revived strongly in the Renaissance and survives in some forms today.&lt;ref&gt;"[[Rota Fortunae|The Wheel of Fortune]]" remains an emblem of the chance element in fate(destiny). 
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
Philosophy on the concepts of destiny and fate has existed since the Hellenistic period with groups such as the [[Stoics]] and the [[Epicureanism|Epicureans]].

The Stoics believed that human decisions and actions ultimately went according to a divine plan devised by a god. They claimed that although humans theoretically have free will, their souls and the circumstances under which they live are all part of the universal network of fate.

The Epicureans challenged the Stoic beliefs by denying the existence of this divine fate. They believed that a human's actions were voluntary so long as they were rational.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Greece and the Hellenic Tradition"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Karamanolis|first1=George E.|title=Vol. 1 of Encyclopedia of Greece and the Hellenic Tradition|date=2000|publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn|location=Chicago, Illinois|pages=610–611}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In daily language, "destiny" and "fate" are synonymous, but with regard to [[19th-century philosophy]], the words gained inherently different meanings.

For [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], destiny was just a manifestation of the Will to Live, which can be at the same time living fate and choice of overrunning fate, by means of the [[Art]], of the [[Morality]] and of the [[Asceticism|Ascesis]].

For [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], destiny keeps the form of ''[[Amor fati]]'' (Love of Fate) through the important element of Nietzsche's philosophy, the "[[will to power]]" (der ''Wille zur Macht''), the basis of human behavior, influenced by the Will to Live of Schopenhauer. But this concept may have even other senses, although he, in various places, saw the will to power as a strong element for adaptation or survival in a better way.&lt;ref&gt;Beyond Good &amp; Evil 13, Gay Science 349 &amp; Genealogy of Morality II:12&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche eventually transformed the idea of matter as centers of force into matter as centers of will to power as humanity's destiny to face with ''amor fati''. The expression ''Amor fati'' is used repeatedly by [[Nietzsche]] as acceptation-choice of the ''fate'', but in such way it becomes even another thing, precisely a "choice" destiny.

[[Determinism]] is a philosophical concept often confused with fate, it can be defined as the notion that all intents/actions are ''causally'' determined by the culminations of an agent's existing circumstances; simply put, everything that happens is determined by things that have already happened.&lt;ref name=Nagel&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nagel|first1=Thomas|authorlink1=Thomas Nagel|title=What Does it all Mean?|date=1987|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|chapter=Chapter 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Determinism differs from fate in that it is never conceived as being a spiritual, religious, nor astrological notion; fate is typically thought of as being "given" or "decreed" while determinism is "caused."  Influential philosophers like [[Robert Kane (philosopher)]], [[Thomas Nagel]], [[Roderick Chisholm]], and [[A.J. Ayer]] have written about this notion.

==Religion==
The idea of a god controlled destiny plays an important role in numerous religions.

* Followers of [[Ancient Greek religion]] regarded not only the [[Moirai]] but also the gods, particularly [[Zeus]], as responsible for deciding and carrying out destiny, respectively. 
* Those who followed [[Gnosticism]] believed in fate as something strict and unchangeable, resulting in salvation only for the “chosen ones.”
* Followers of [[Christianity]] consider God to be the only force with control over one’s fate and that he has a plan for every person. Many believe that humans all have free will, which is contrasted with [[predestination]], although naturally inclined to act according to God’s desire.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Greece and the Hellenic Tradition"/&gt;
* In Islam, fate or ''[[qadar]]'' is the decree of Allah.

==Literature==
Historically and globally, fate has played a large role in several literary works.  In ancient Greece, many legends and tales teach the futility of trying to outmaneuver an inexorable fate that has been correctly predicted. This portrayal of fate is present in works such as ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'' (427 BCE),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sophocles|editor1=Stephen Berg|editor2=Diskin Clay|title=Oedipus the King|date=1978|origyear=427 BC|publisher=Oxford UP|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[Iliad]],'' the ''[[Odyssey]]'' (800 BCE), and ''[[Theogony]].'' Many ancient Chinese works have also portrayed the concept of fate, most notably the ''[[Liezi]],'' ''[[Mencius (book)|Mengzi]],'' and the ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]].'' Similarly, and in Italy, the Spanish [[Duque de Rivas]]' play that [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]] transformed into ''[[La Forza del Destino]]'' ("The Force of Destiny") includes notions of fate. In England, fate has played a notable literary role in Shakespeare's ''[[Macbeth]]'' (1606), Thomas Hardy's ''[[Tess of the d'Urbervilles]]'' (1891), Samuel Beckett's ''[[Endgame (play)|Endgame]]'' (1957), and W.W Jacobs' popular short story "[[The Monkey's Paw]]" (1902). In America, [[Thornton Wilder]]'s book ''[[The Bridge of San Luis Rey]]'' (1927) portrays the conception of fate. In Germany, fate is a recurring theme in the literature of [[Hermann Hesse]] (1877–1962), including ''[[Siddhartha (novel)|Siddharta]]'' (1922) and his magnum opus, ''Das Glasperlenspiel,'' also published as ''[[The Glass Bead Game]]'' (1943). And by Hollywood through such characters as Neo in ''[[The Matrix]]''. The common theme of these works involves a protagonist who cannot escape their  destiny, however hard they try.

{{Monarchism|expanded=Related}}
'''Enlightened absolutism''' (also called '''enlightened despotism''' or '''benevolent despotism''') refers to the conduct and policies of European [[Absolute monarchy|absolute monarchs]] during the 18th and 19th centuries who were influenced by the ideas of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], espousing them to enhance their power.{{sfn|Perry|Chase|Jacob|2015|p=442}} The concept originated during the Enlightenment period in the [[18th century|18th]] and into the early [[19th century|19th centuries]].

An enlightened [[despotism|despot]] is a non-[[Democracy|democratic]] or [[authoritarian]] leader who exercises their political power for the benefit of the people, rather than exclusively for themselves or elites.

Enlightened despots distinguished themselves from ordinary despots by claiming to rule for their subjects' well-being. They may focus government priorities on [[healthcare]], [[education]], nonviolent population control, or physical infrastructure. The leader may profess a commitment to [[peace]]ful relations and/or allow some democratic decision-making, such as public [[referendum|referenda]], but would not propose reforms that undermined their sovereignty or disrupted the social order; "Despotism is a legitimate mode of government in dealing with barbarians, provided the end be their improvement."{{sfn|Mill|1989|p=13}}

Enlightened despots' beliefs about royal power were typically similar to those of regular despots, both believing that they were destined to rule. Enlightened rulers may have played a part in the abolition of [[serfdom]] in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Disappearance of Serfdom. France. England. Italy. Germany. Spain.|url = http://www.1902encyclopedia.com/S/SLA/slavery-12.html|website = www.1902encyclopedia.com|accessdate = 2015-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The enlightened despot [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Joseph II]] of Austria summarized, "Everything for the people, nothing by the people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.habsburger.net/en/chapter/joseph-ii-long-awaited-son |title=Joseph II: The long-awaited son |author=World of the Habsburgs |work=Textmode |publisher=World of the Habsburgs |accessdate=2015-10-21 |quote=‘Everything for the people, nothing by the people’ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Enlightened absolutism is the theme of an essay by [[Frederick the Great]], who ruled [[Prussia]] from 1740 to 1786, defending this system of government.&lt;ref name="Kramnick1995"&gt;Reprinted in {{cite book|author=Isaac Kramnick|title=The Portable Enlightenment Reader|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gIoFAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=26 August 2013|year=1995|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0-14-024566-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the prominent French Enlightenment philosopher [[Voltaire]] fell out of favor in [[France]], he eagerly accepted Frederick's invitation to live at his palace. He believed that an enlightened monarchy was the only real way for society to advance. Frederick was an enthusiast of French ideas. Frederick explained: "My principal occupation is to combat ignorance and prejudice ... to enlighten minds, cultivate morality, and to make people as happy as it suits human nature, and as the means at my disposal permit."&lt;ref&gt;Giles MacDonogh, ''Frederick the Great: A Life in Deed and Letters'' (2001) p. 341&lt;/ref&gt;

Enlightened absolutists held that royal power emanated not from [[Divine right of kings|divine right]] but from a [[social contract]] whereby a despot was entrusted with the power to govern through a social contract in lieu of any other governments. The monarchs of enlightened absolutism strengthened their authority by improving the lives of their subjects. This philosophy implied that the sovereign knew that the interests of his or her subjects better than they themselves did. The monarch taking responsibility for the subjects precluded their political participation.

The difference between an [[Absolutism (European history)|absolutist]] and an ''enlightened'' absolutist is based on a broad analysis of the degree to which they embraced the Age of Enlightenment. For example, although Empress [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II of Russia]] entirely rejected the concept of the social contract, she [[Russian Enlightenment|embraced many ideas of the Enlightenment]], being one of the great patrons of the arts in [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]] and incorporating many ideas of Enlightenment philosophers, especially [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]], in her [[Nakaz]], which was intended to revise Russian law.

However, historians debate the actual implementation of enlightened absolutism. They distinguish between the "enlightenment" of the ruler personally, versus that of his or her regime. For example, Frederick the Great was tutored in the ideas of the French Enlightenment in his youth, and maintained those ideas in his private life as an adult, but in many ways was unable or unwilling to effect enlightened reforms in practice.&lt;ref&gt;H.M. Scott, ed., ''Enlightened Absolutism: Reform and Reformers in Later Eighteenth-Century Europe'', (University of Michigan Press, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt; Other rulers such as the [[Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo|Marquis of Pombal]], prime minister of [[Portugal]], used the ideas and practices of the Enlightenment not only to achieve reforms but also to enhance [[autocracy]], crush opposition, suppress criticism, advance colonial economic exploitation, and consolidate personal control and profit.

The concept of enlightened absolutism was formally described by the German historian [[Wilhelm Georg Friedrich Roscher|Wilhelm Roscher]] in 1847&lt;ref&gt;A. Lentin (ed.), ''Enlightened Absolutism (1760-1790)'', Aveiro, 1985, p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt; and remains controversial among scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Ingrao, "The Problem of 'Enlightened Absolutism and the German States," ''Journal of Modern History'' Vol. 58, Supplement: Politics and Society in the Holy Roman Empire, 1500–1806 (Dec., 1986), pp. S161–S180 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1880014 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political reforms ==
The most important political reforms these monarchs instituted in their kingdoms included:
* Codifying the laws of their territories.
* Reforming the countryside by establishing who owned which land and by reporting this data in property surveys called ''[[Cadastre|cadasters]].''
* Abolishing, or taking steps to abolish, aristocratic tax immunities.
* Limiting the nobility's power to police and pass judgement upon their peasants.
* Diminishing peasants' legal disabilities, including ameliorating, if not abolishing, the hereditary status and impositions of serfdom where they still existed.
* Promoting commerce (whether directly, through royal manufactures, or indirectly, through subsidies, tariffs, the reduction of tolls, or the improvement of transportation).
* Establishing some measure of religious toleration.
* Sponsoring cultural activities and institutions (such as individual ''philosophies'', royal academies, libraries, and essay contests).[https://faculty.unlv.edu/gbrown/westernciv/wc201/wciv2c11/wciv2c11lsec5.html]

== Major nations ==
Governmental responses to the Age of Enlightenment varied widely. In several nations with powerful rulers, called "enlightened despots" by historians, leaders of the Enlightenment were welcomed at Court and helped design laws and programs to reform the system, typically to build stronger national states.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen J. Lee, ''Aspects of European history, 1494–1789'' (1990) pp. 258–66&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[France]], the government's posture was one of hostility and philosophers fought government censorship. The [[British Empire|British]] government generally ignored the Enlightenment's leaders. [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]], King of [[Spain]] from 1759 to 1788, sought to rescue his empire from decay through ambitious reforms such as weakening the Church and its monasteries, promoting science and university research, facilitating trade and commerce, modernizing agriculture, and avoiding war. Spain relapsed into former patterns after his death.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas  Henderson, "Charles III of Spain: An Enlightened Despot," ''History Today'', Nov 1968, Vol. 18  Issue 10, pp. 673–82 and Issue 11, pp. 760–68&lt;/ref&gt;

Empress Catherine the Great, who ruled [[Russia]] from 1762 to 1796, had an enthusiastic response toward Enlightenment ideas. Emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], ruler of [[Austria]] from 1780 to 1790, was over-enthusiastic, announcing so many reforms with so little support that revolts broke out and his regime reverted to a comedy of errors.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Henderson, "Joseph II", ''History Today'' (March 1991) 41:21–27&lt;/ref&gt;

Senior ministers, such as the [[Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquess of Pombal|Marquis of Pombal]], who was [[Joseph I of Portugal]]'s Secretary of State, and [[Johann Friedrich Struensee|Struensee in Denmark]], did govern amicably with Enlightenment ideals.

Long-seated [[dictator]]s are more likely to be regarded as enlightened because they acknowledge public interest in order to remain in power and to be regarded as [[legitimacy (political)|legitimate]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

In Spanish the word ''[[dictablanda]]'' is sometimes used for a [[dictatorship]] that preserves some of the liberties and mechanisms of democracy.

== Chinese Legalism ==
Xuezhi Guo contrasts the [[Confucianism|Confucian]] ideal of a "humane ruler" (renjun) with the ideal of [[Chinese Legalism|Chinese Legalists]], who he says "intended to create a truly 'enlightened ruler' (''mingjun'') who is able to effectively rule the masses and control his bureaucracy"; this ruler would be a "skilful manipulator and successful politician who uses means or 'technique' in achieving self-protection and political control." Guo quotes [[Benjamin I. Schwartz]] as describing the features of "a truly Legalist 'enlightened ruler{{Single double}}:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6vG-MROnr7IC&amp;pg=PA141#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Ideal Chinese Political Leader: A Historical and Cultural Perspective|last=Guo|first=Xuezhi|publisher=Praeger Publishers|year=2002|isbn=|location=Westport, CT|pages=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;He must be anything but an arbitrary despot if one means by a despot a tyrant who follows all his impulses, whims and passions. Once the systems which maintain the entire structure are in place, he must not interfere with their operation. He may use the entire system as a means to the achievement of his national and international ambitions, but to do so he must not disrupt it's impersonal workings. He must at all times be able to maintain an iron wall between his private life and public role. Concubines, friends, flatterers and charismatic saints must have no influence whatsoever on the course of policy, and he must never relax his suspicions of the motives of those who surround him.&lt;ref&gt;Benjanmin I. Schwartz p. 345, The World of Thought in Ancient China&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Firmin Abauzit''' (November 11, 1679{{snd}}March 20, 1767) was a [[France|French]] scholar who worked on [[physics]], [[theology]] and [[philosophy]], and served as librarian in [[Geneva]] ([[Republic of Geneva]]) during his final 40 years. Abauzit is also notable for proofreading or correcting the writings of [[Isaac Newton]] and other scholars.

==Biography==
Firmin Abauzit was born of [[Huguenot]] parents November 11, 1679 at [[Uzès]], in [[Languedoc]].&lt;ref name=eb&gt;{{harvnb|Hoiberg|2010|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cam&gt;{{harvnb|Magnusson|Goring|1990|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father died when he was but two years of age; and when, on the revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]] in 1685, the authorities took steps to have him educated in the [[Roman Catholic]] faith, his mother contrived his escape.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

For two years his brother and he lived as fugitives in the mountains of the [[Cévennes]], but they at last reached [[Geneva]], where their mother afterwards joined them on escaping from the imprisonment in which she was held from the time of their flight. Abauzit at an early age acquired great proficiency in languages, physics, and theology.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In 1698, he traveled to [[Germany]], then to [[Dutch Republic|Holland]],&lt;ref name=cam/&gt; where he became acquainted with [[Pierre Bayle]],&lt;ref name=eb/&gt; [[Pierre Jurieu]] and [[Jacques Basnage]]. Proceeding to [[England]], he was introduced to Sir [[Isaac Newton]], who found in him one of the earliest defenders, against [[Charles-Irénée Castel de Saint-Pierre|Castel]] of his discoveries.&lt;ref name=eb/&gt;&lt;ref name=ww/&gt; Newton corrected in the second edition of his ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'' an error pointed out by Abauzit,&lt;ref name=ww/&gt; and, when sending him the ''Commercium Epistolicum,'' said, "You are well worthy to judge between [[Gottfried Leibniz]] and me."{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

The reputation of Abauzit induced [[William III of England|William III]] to request him to settle in [[England]], but he did not accept the king's offer, preferring to return to [[Geneva]].&lt;ref name=ww/&gt;
There, from 1715 he rendered valuable assistance to a society that had been formed for translating the [[New Testament]] into [[French language|French]]. He declined the offer of the chair of philosophy at the [[University of Geneva]] in 1723.&lt;ref name=eb/&gt; He assisted in the French language [[New Testament]] in 1726.&lt;ref name=eb/&gt; In 1727, he was granted citizenship in Geneva, and he accepted the office of honorary librarian to Geneva, the city of his adoption.&lt;ref name=eb/&gt; It was while he was in Geneva in his later years that he authored many of his works. Here also was the city of his death past the age of 87, on March 20, 1767.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

==Legacy==
Abauzit was a man of great learning and of wonderful versatility. Whatever chanced to be discussed, it used to be said of Abauzit that he seemed to have made it a subject of particular study. [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], who was jealously sparing of his praises, addressed to him, in his ''[[Julie, ou la nouvelle Héloïse]]'', a fine [[panegyric]]; and when a stranger flatteringly told [[Voltaire]] he had come to see a great man, the philosopher asked him if he had seen Abauzit.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} Among his acquaintances, Abauzit claimed Rousseau, Voltaire, Newton, and Bayle.&lt;ref name=ww&gt;{{harvnb|Debus|Calinger|Collins|Kennedy|1968|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Little remains of the labours of this intellectual giant, his heirs having, it is said, destroyed the papers that came into their possession, because their own religious opinions were different. A few theological, archaeological, and astronomical articles from his pen appeared in the ''Journal helvétique'' and elsewhere, and he contributed several papers to Rousseau's ''Dictionnaire de musique'' (1767). He wrote a work throwing doubt on the [[Biblical canon|canonical]] authority of the [[Apocalypse]], which called forth a reply from Dr [[Leonard Twells]], and was published in [[Denis Diderot]]'s ''[[Encyclopédie]]''. He also edited and made valuable additions to [[Jacob Spon]]'s ''Histoire de la république de Genève''. A collection of his writings was published at Geneva in 1770 (''Œuvres de feu M. Abauzit''), and another at [[London]] in 1773 (''Œuvres diverses de M. Abauzit'').

The '''flag of [[Jordan]]''', officially adopted on 18 April 1928, is based on the flag of the [[Arab Revolt]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]] during [[World War I]]. The flag consists of horizontal black, white, and green bands that are connected by a red [[Flag terminology|chevron]]. The colors stand are the [[Pan-Arab Colors]], representing the [[Abbasid]] (black band), [[Umayyad]] (white band), and [[Fatimid]] (green band) [[caliphate]]s. The red chevron is for the [[Hashemite]] dynasty, and the [[Arab Revolt]].&lt;ref name="fotw"&gt;{{Cite web

==Features==

In addition to the bands and chevron, a white star with seven points is featured on the hoist side of the red chevron. The star stands for the unity of the [[Arab nationalism|Arab people]].&lt;ref name="kinghussein"/&gt; Its seven-pointed star refers to the seven hills on which [[Amman]], the capital, was built. The seven points represent faith in one God, humanity, humility, national spirit, virtue, social justice, and aspiration.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

{{Linguistics}}
In [[linguistics]], '''Functional Sentence Perspective''' (FSP) is a theory describing the information structure of the sentence and language communication in general. It has been developed in the tradition of the [[Prague school (linguistics)|Prague School]] of Functional and Structural Linguistics together with its sister theory, Topic-Focus Articulation.

The key concepts of FSP were laid down by [[Jan Firbas]] in the mid-1950s on the basis of the linguistic work of [[Vilém Mathesius]], especially his idea of functional syntax in linguistic characterology of language.

==Terminology==
The term '''Functional Sentence Perspective''' was created by Jan Firbas as a more convenient English equivalent of Mathesius’ Czech term [[:cz:aktuální členění větné|aktuální členění větné]]:

{{quote|“It is not without interest to note that Mathesius, who knew [[Henri Weil|Weil]]’s work, coined the felicitous term ‘aktuální členění větné. … As English ‘actual’ is not an exact equivalent of Czech ‘aktuální’, another term had to be found for English. I accepted Professor [[Josef Vachek]]’s suggestion and started using the term ‘functional sentence perspective’ (FSP; Firbas 1957). The term is based on Mathesius’ term ‘Satzperspektive’. Vachek’s suggestion has added the qualification ‘functional’. This is the way the term ‘functional sentence perspective’ (FSP) has found its way into the literature.”|Firbas, 1994, p. 4}}

Within Czech linguistics the Czech calque of the English term Functional Sentence Perspective '''funkční větná perspektiva''' is nowadays used to refer to the approach stemming from the writings of Jan Firbas and his followers, while the original Mathesius’ Czech term '''aktuální členění větné''' tends to be associated with the group of linguists developing the Topic-Focus Articulation, i.e. [[Petr Sgall]], [[Eva Hajičová]], [[Jarmila Panevová]] and their disciples, despite the fact that both terms are still sometimes used interchangeably in some Czech contributions to the topic of information structure of language. (Cf.  Karlík - Nekula - Pleskalová (2002))

'''Research funding''' is a term generally covering any funding for scientific [[research]], in the areas of both "hard" [[science]] and [[technology]] and [[social science]]. The term often connotes funding obtained through a competitive process, in which potential research projects are evaluated and only the most promising receive funding. Such processes, which are run by government, corporations or foundations, allocate scarce funds.

Most research funding comes from two major sources, corporations (through [[research and development]] departments) and government (primarily carried out through universities and specialized government agencies; often known as ''research councils''). Some small amounts of scientific research are carried out (or funded) by charitable foundations, especially in relation to developing cures for diseases such as [[cancer]], [[malaria]] and [[AIDS]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

According to [[OECD]], more than 60% of [[research and development]] in scientific and technical fields is carried out by industries, and 20% and 10% respectively by [[universities]] and government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/science-and-technology/oecd-science-technology-and-industry-scoreboard-2015_sti_scoreboard-2015-en|title=OECD Science, Technology and Industry Scoreboard 2015: Innovation for growth and society |last= |first= |publisher=OECD |year=2015 |isbn=9789264239784 |location= |pages=156 |doi=10.1787/sti_scoreboard-2015-en |quote=|via=oecd-ilibrary.org|series=OECD Science, Technology and Industry Scoreboard }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparatively, in countries with less GDP, such as [[Portugal]] and [[Mexico]] the industry contribution is significantly lower. The US government spends more than other countries on military R&amp;D, although the proportion has fallen from around 30% in the 1980s to under 20.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} Government funding for medical research amounts to approximately 36%&lt;!-- OF WHAT?? --&gt; in the U.S. The government funding proportion in certain industries is higher, and it dominates research in [[social science]] and [[humanities]]. Similarly, with some exceptions (e.g. [[biotechnology]]) government provides the bulk of the funds for ''basic'' scientific research.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} In commercial research and development, all but the most research-oriented corporations focus more heavily on near-term commercialization possibilities rather than "blue-sky" ideas or technologies (such as [[nuclear fusion]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Taylor | first1 = R.A. | year = 2012 | title = Socioeconomic impacts of heat transfer research | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735193312002199 | journal = International Communications in Heat and Mass Transfer | volume = 39 | issue = 10| pages = 1467–1473 | doi=10.1016/j.icheatmasstransfer.2012.09.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main article|History of science policy}}

In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, as the pace of technological progress increased before and during the [[industrial revolution]], most scientific and technological research was carried out by individual [[inventor]]s using their own funds. A system of [[patent]]s was developed to allow inventors a period of time (often twenty years) to commercialise their inventions and recoup a profit, although in practice many found this difficult. The talents of an inventor are not those of a businessman, and there are many examples of inventors (e.g. [[Charles Goodyear]]) making rather little money from their work whilst others were able to market it.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

In the twentieth century, scientific and technological research became increasingly systematised, as [[corporation]]s developed, and discovered that continuous investment in [[research and development]] could be a key element of success in a competitive strategy. It remained the case, however, that imitation by competitors - circumventing or simply flouting patents, especially those registered abroad - was often just as successful a strategy for companies focused on innovation in matters of organisation and production technique, or even in marketing. A classic example is that of [[Wilkinson Sword]] and [[Global Gillette|Gillette]] in the [[disposable razor]] market, where the former has typically had the technological edge, and the latter the commercial one.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

==National funding by country==
{{Main|List of countries by research and development spending}}
Different countries spend vastly different amounts on research, in both absolute and relative terms. For instance, [[South Korea]] and [[Israel]] spend more than 4% of their GDP on research while many Arabic countries spend less than 1% (e.g. [[Saudi Arabia]] 0.25%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Gross domestic spending on R&amp;D (indicator)|doi=10.1787/d8b068b4-en|url=https://data.oecd.org/rd/gross-domestic-spending-on-r-d.htm|accessdate=1 July 2017|date=2017-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===USA===
The US spent $456.1 billion for research and development (R&amp;D) in 2013, the most recent year for which such figures are available, according to the [[National Science Foundation]]. The private sector accounted for $322.5 billion, or 71%, of total national expenditures, with universities and colleges spending $64.7 billion, or 14%, in second place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anonymous|year=2016|title=Microbiology Policy Bulletin Board|url=http://www.asmscience.org/docserver/fulltext/microbe/11/4/microbe_11_4.pdf|journal=Microbe Magazine|volume=11|pages=145|via=ASM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Switzerland===
[[Switzerland]] spent CHF 22 billion for R&amp;D in 2015 with an increase of 10.5% compared with 2012 when the last survey was conducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Recherche et développement en Suisse 2015 (press release)|url=https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/fr/home/actualites/communiques-presse.assetdetail.2422944.html |accessdate=1 July 2017|date=2017-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In relative terms, this represents 3.4% of the country's GDP. R&amp;D activities are carried out by nearly 125,000 individuals, mostly in the private sector (71%) and higher education institutions (27%).

==Process==
Often scientists apply for research funding which a granting agency may (or may not) approve to financially support.  These ''grants'' require a lengthy process as the granting agency can inquire about the researcher(s)'s background, the facilities used, the equipment needed, the time involved, and the overall potential of the scientific outcome.  The process of grant writing and grant proposing is a somewhat delicate process for both the grantor and the grantee:  the grantors want to choose the research that best fits their scientific principles, and the individual grantees want to apply for research in which they have the best chances but also in which they can build a body of work towards future scientific endeavors.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

The [[Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council]] in the United Kingdom has devised an alternative method of fund-distribution: the sandpit.&lt;ref&gt;

[...] The wheels of such events are oiled with the promise of up to £1 million in funding, which is dished out at the end through a group peer-review process.
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Most universities have research administration offices to facilitate the interaction between the researcher and the granting agency.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
"Research administration is all about service—service to our faculty, to our academic units, to the institution, and to our sponsors.  To be of service, we first have to know what our customers want and then determine whether or not we are meeting those needs and expectations."&lt;ref&gt;
Robert A. Killoren, Jr., Associate Vice President for Research, Office of Sponsored Programs, Penn State U, Fall 2005.  From Lowry, Peggy (2006)  "Assessing the Sponsored Research Office". ''[http://www.aiseducation.com/RAG_product.html SPONSORED RESEARCH ADMINISTRATION: A Guide to Effective Strategies and Recommended Practices ]''
&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States of America, the [[National Council of University Research Administrators]] (NCURA) serves its members and advances the field of research administration through education and professional development programs, the sharing of knowledge and experience, and by fostering a professional, collegial, and respected community.

===Public funding===
{{Main article|Science policy}}
{{see also|Research council|United States national laboratories (disambiguation){{!}}United States national laboratories|Federally funded research and development centers|label 3 = List of federally-funded research and development centers (US)}}
Government-funded research can either be carried out by the government itself, or through [[Grant (money)|grants]] to researchers outside the government.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} The bodies providing public funding are often referred to as ''research councils''.

Critics{{Who|date=December 2014}} of [[basic research]] are concerned that research funding for the sake of knowledge itself does not contribute to a great return.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}  However, scientific innovations often foreshadow or inspire further ideas unintentionally. For example, NASA's quest to put a man on the moon inspired them to develop better sound recording and reading technologies.  NASA's research was furthered by the music industry, who used it to develop audio cassettes.  Audio cassettes, being smaller and able to store more music, quickly dominated the music industry and increased the availability of music.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

An additional distinction of government-sponsored research is that the government does not make a claim to the [[intellectual property]], whereas private research-funding bodies sometimes claim ownership of the intellectual property that they are paying to have developed. Consequently, government-sponsored research more often allows the individual discoverer to file intellectual property claims over their own work.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

====List of research councils====
Research councils are (usually public) bodies that provide research funding in the form of research grants or [[scholarship]]s.  These include [[arts council]]s and research councils for the funding of science.

Examples of companies that fund basic research include IBM (high temperature superconductivity was [[High-temperature superconductivity|discovered by IBM sponsored basic experimental research]] in 1986), L'Oreal (which created the [[L'Oréal-UNESCO Awards for Women in Science|L'Oreal-Unesco prize for women scientists]] and finances internships), AXA (which launched a [http://www.axa-research.org/ Research Fund] in 2008 and finances Academic Institutions such as advanced fundamental mathematics French Foundation IHES).

A company may share resources with a [[materials science]] society to gain proprietary knowledge or trained workers.

===Hard money versus soft money===
In academic contexts, '''hard money''' may refer to funding received from a government or other entity at regular intervals, thus providing a steady inflow of financial resources to the beneficiary. The antonym, '''soft money''', refers to funding provided only through competitive [[research grant]]s and the writing of grant proposals.&lt;ref name="StackExchangeHardMoney"&gt;[http://academia.stackexchange.com/a/30627 "What is a soft-money research position?"], Academia StackExchange&lt;/ref&gt;

Hard money is usually issued by the government for the advancement of certain projects or for the benefit of specific agencies. Community [[healthcare]], for instance, may be supported by the government by providing hard money. Since funds are disbursed regularly and continuously, the offices in charge of such projects are able to achieve their objectives more effectively than if they had been issued one-time grants.

Individual jobs at a research institute may be classified as "hard-money positions" or "soft-money positions";&lt;ref name="StackExchangeHardMoney"/&gt; the former are expected to provide [[job security]] because their funding is secure in the long term, whereas individual "soft-money" positions may come and go with fluctuations in the number of grants awarded to the institution.

==Influence on research==
The source of funding may introduce conscious or unconscious biases into a researcher's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://undsci.berkeley.edu/article/0_0_0/who_pays|title=Who pays for science?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disclosure of potential conflicts of interest (COIs) is used by biomedical journals to guarantee credibility and transparency of the scientific process. Conflict of interest disclosure, however, is not systematically nor consistently dealt with by journals which publish scientific research results.  When research is funded by the same agency that can be expected to gain from a favorable outcome there is a potential for biased results and research shows that results are indeed more favorable than would be expected from a more objective view of the evidence. A 2003 [[systematic review]] studied  the scope and impact of industry sponsorship in biomedical research.  The researchers found financial relationships among industry, scientific investigators, and academic institutions  widespread.  Results  showed a statistically significant association between industry sponsorship and pro-industry conclusions and concluded that "Conflicts of interest arising from these ties can influence biomedical research in important ways".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Relationship between Funding Source and Conclusion among Nutrition-Related Scientific Articles|volume=4|issue=1|pages=e5|work=[[PLOS Medicine]]|publisher=[[PLOS]]|author1=Lenard I Lesser |author2=Cara B Ebbeling |author3=Merrill Goozner |author4=David Wypij |author5=David S Ludwig |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0040005|pmid=17214504|pmc=1764435|date=January 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A British study found that a majority of the members on national and food policy committees receive funding from food companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Food company sponsorship of nutrition research and professional activities: a conflict of interest?|volume=4|issue=5|pages=1015–1022|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=566532|work=[[Public Health Nutrition]]|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|accessdate=24 March 2014|author=Marion Nestle|doi=10.1079/PHN2001253|date=October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an effort to cut costs, the pharmaceutical industry has turned to the use of private, nonacademic research groups (i.e., contract research organizations [CROs]) which can do the work for less money than academic investigators.  In 2001 CROs came under criticism when the editors of 12 major scientific journals issued a joint editorial, published in each journal, on the control over clinical trials exerted by sponsors, particularly targeting the use of contracts which allow sponsors to review the studies prior to publication and withhold publication of any studies in which their product did poorly. They further criticized the trial methodology  stating that researchers are frequently restricted from contributing to the trial design, accessing the raw data, and interpreting the results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 81460 | pmid=11584570 | volume=165 | issue=6 | title=Sponsorship, authorship and accountability |date=September 2001 | journal=CMAJ | pages=786–8| author1=Davidoff | first1=F | last2=Deangelis | first2=C.

The [[Cochrane Collaboration]], a worldwide group that aims to provide compiled scientific evidence to aid well informed health care decisions,  conducts [[systematic review]]s of [[randomized controlled trial]]s of health care interventions and tries to disseminate the results and conclusions derived from them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Cochrane Collaboration|journal=Eur J Clin Nutr|date=August 2005|volume=59|series=Suppl 1|issue=S1|pages=S147–S149|doi=10.1038/sj.ejcn.1602188|url=http://www.nature.com/ejcn/journal/v59/n1s/full/1602188a.html|accessdate=31 January 2012|pmid=16052183|last1=Scholten|first1=R.

The systematic reviews are published in the [[Cochrane Library]]. A 2011 study done to disclose possible conflicts of interests [COI] in underlying research studies used for medical [[meta-analyses]] reviewed 29 meta-analyses and found that COIs in the studies underlying the meta-analyses were rarely disclosed.   The 29 meta-analyses reviewed an aggregate of 509 randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Of these, 318 RCTs reported funding sources with 219 (69%) industry funded. 132 of the 509 RCTs reported author COI disclosures, with 91 studies (69%) disclosing industry financial ties with one or more authors. The information was, however, seldom reflected in the meta-analyses. Only two (7%) reported RCT funding sources and none reported RCT author-industry ties. The authors concluded "without acknowledgement of COI due to industry funding or author industry financial ties from RCTs included in meta-analyses, readers' understanding and appraisal of the evidence from the meta-analysis may be compromised."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Well Do Meta-Analyses Disclose Conflicts of Interests in Underlying Research Studies|url=http://www.cochrane.org/news/blog/how-well-do-meta-analyses-disclose-conflicts-interests-underlying-research-studies|work=The Cochrane Collaboration website|publisher=[[Cochrane Collaboration]]|accessdate=24 March 2014|date=2011-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 researchers looked at the association between authors' published positions on the safety and efficacy in assisting with weight loss of [[olestra]], a [[fat substitute]] manufactured by the [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] (P&amp;G), and their financial relationships with the food and beverage industry.  They found that supportive authors were significantly more likely than critical or neutral authors to have financial relationships with P&amp;G and all authors disclosing an affiliation with P&amp;G were supportive.  The authors of the study concluded: "Because authors' published opinions were associated with their financial relationships, obtaining noncommercial funding may be more essential to maintaining objectivity than disclosing personal financial interests."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Authors' Financial Relationships With the Food and Beverage Industry and Their Published Positions on the Fat Substitute Olestra| pmc=1447808 | pmid=12660215|volume=93| issue=4 |year=2003|pages=664–9 | last1 = Levine | first1 = J | last2 = Gussow | first2 = JD | last3 = Hastings | first3 = D | last4 = Eccher | first4 = A | doi=10.2105/ajph.93.4.664 | journal=American Journal of Public Health}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Out of the scientists questioned, 15.5% admitted to altering design, methodology or results of their studies due to pressure of an external funding source.

A theoretical model has been established whose simulations imply that peer review and over-competitive research funding foster mainstream opinion to monopoly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fang | first1 = H. | year = 2011 | title = Peer review and over-competitive research funding fostering mainstream opinion to monopoly | url = | journal = Scientometrics | volume = 87 | issue = 2| pages = 293–301 | doi=10.1007/s11192-010-0323-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Efficiency of funding ==
Most funding agencies mandate efficient use of their funds, that is, they want to maximize outcome for their money spent. Outcome can be measured by [[Scientific literature|publication]] output, [[citation impact]], number of [[Patent|patents]], number of [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhDs]] awarded etc. Another question is how to allocate funds to different disciplines, institutions, or researchers. A recent study by Wayne Walsh found that “prestigious institutions had on average 65% higher grant application success rates and 50% larger award sizes, whereas less-prestigious institutions produced 65% more publications and had a 35% higher citation impact per dollar of funding.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/research-dollars-go-farther-at-less-prestigious-institutions--study-64529|title=Research Dollars Go Farther at Less-Prestigious Institutions: Study|website=The Scientist Magazine®|language=en|access-date=2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wahls|first=Wayne P.|date=2018-07-13|title=High cost of bias: Diminishing marginal returns on NIH grant funding to institutions|url=https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/07/13/367847|journal=bioRxiv|language=en|pages=367847|doi=10.1101/367847}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Godiva's Hymn"''', '''"Engineer's Hymn"''' or '''"Engineers' Drinking Song"''' is a traditional [[drinking song]] for engineers.  Versions of it have been associated with the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]], as well as MIT and various universities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=An Engineer's Alphabet: Gleanings from the Softer Side of a Profession | publisher=Cambridge University Press | author=Petroski, Henry | year=2011 | pages=122 | isbn=9781139505307}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is now often performed by the MIT a cappella group The Chorallaries.  In many university [[engineering]] faculties, military engineering [[corps]] and other engineering organizations and [[Engineering Society|societies]], [[Lady Godiva]] is a school icon or [[mascot]].

Godiva's Hymn is sung either to the tune of "[[The Battle Hymn of the Republic]]" or "The Son of a Gambolier". Near Christmas, it is a tradition of the [[Lady Godiva Memorial Bnad]] ([[sic]]) of the [[University of Toronto]] to sing Godiva's Hymn to the tune of [[Good King Wenceslaus]].

One Version of the Chorus is as follows:&lt;ref name="quote"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://web.mit.edu/choral/www_old/repertoire/engineers.htm | title=the engineers' drinking song | publisher=MIT | accessdate=15 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;We are We are We are We are--
We are the engineers--
We can We can We can We can--
Demolish forty beers--
Drink rum Drink rum Drink rum all day--
and come along with us for--
We don't give a damn for any old man--
Who don't give a damn for us--&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One of Godiva's Verses:&lt;ref name="quote"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Godiva was a lady who through Coventry did ride--
To show to all the villagers her fine and lily-white hide--
The most observant villager, an engineer of course--
Was the only one to notice that Godiva rode a horse--&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Parody version==
A bawdy parody of the engineer's song, known as [[Round and Round Went the Great Big Wheel]], was famously recorded during the 1940s by [[Oscar Brand]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.horntip.com/mp3/1950s/1956ca_bawdy_songs_vol_6_bawdy_western_songs_(LP)/14_the_great_big_wheel_(aka_the_engineers_song).htm Oscar Brand version]&lt;/ref&gt; It later served as the inspiration for an episode of [[Dad's Army]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/navysong/Data%20Song/B0011.htm Rugby songs]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0552309/ Dads army]&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt; An [[engineer]] told me before he died
And I have no reason to say he lied
That though he tried throughout his life
He could never satisfy his wife

Round and round went the great big wheel
In and out went the rod of steel
I'll lay you money on a surefire bet
That the great big wheel is a-turning yet

So he mounted up a great big [[wheel]] 
And there upon set a [[dildo|rod of steel]]
Two brass balls were filled with cream
And the [[steampunk|whole darn thing was run by steam]]

Round and round went the great big wheel
In and out went the rod of steel
I'll lay you money on a surefire bet
That the great big wheel is a-turning yet

Then he rolled it up to the bedroom door
And the wheel started up with a mighty roar
It rolled to the bedpost and rolled on top
And pumped his wife til she hollered stop

Round and round went the great big wheel
In and out went the rod of steel
I'll lay you money on a surefire bet
That the great big wheel is a-turning yet

But the great big wheel went right on through
Til the engineer's wife was split in two
Then as if possessed by a monstrous [[wikt:whim#Noun|whim]]
It turned around and [[buggery|mounted him]]

Round and round went the great big wheel
In and out went the rod of steel
I'll lay you money on a surefire bet
That the great big wheel is a-turning yet

Then it rolled through the streets and into town
Mounting people up and down
Covered them all with [[Grease (lubricant)|grease]] and [[cream]]
And disappeared in a cloud of [[steam]]

Round and round went the great big wheel
In and out went the rod of steel
I'll lay you money on a surefire bet
That the great big wheel is a-turning yet

So if some day you should see a wheel
With two brass [[ball]]s and a rod of steel
Run to the [[prairie]], run to the hill
Unless you're looking for a longtime thrill

Round and round went the great big wheel
In and out went the rod of steel
I'll lay you money on a surefire bet
That the great big wheel is a-turning yet
&lt;/poem&gt;}}

'''Groundskeeping''' is the activity of tending an area of land for aesthetic or functional purposes; typically in an institutional setting. It includes mowing grass, trimming hedges, pulling weeds, planting flowers, etc. The U.S. Department of Labor estimated that more than 900,000 workers are employed in the landscape and groundskeeping services industry in the United States in 2006. Of these over 300,000 workers were groundskeepers for [[greenskeeper|golf courses]], schools, resorts, and public parks.&lt;ref&gt;The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2008-144/ "Fact Sheet: Fatal Injuries Among Landscape Services Workers"]. DHHS Publication 2008-144. October 2008. Accessed 10-22-2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Compare [[gardener]].

A '''groundskeeper''' is a person who maintains landscaping, gardens or sporting venues (and their vegetation where appropriate) for appearance and functionality. In [[United Kingdom|Britain]] the word '''groundsman''' (occasionally '''groundswoman''' if appropriate) or '''park-keeper''' is used much more commonly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/groundskeeper groundskeeper] in [[Oxford Dictionaries Online]]: "North American term for groundsman."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/park-keeper park-keeper] in [[Oxford Dictionaries Online]]: "The caretaker of a park."&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[Australia]], the word '''curator''' is often used for a person undertaking this job, especially those involving [[cricket pitch]]es.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} At university campuses, groundskeepers are often called [[horticulturists]]. The equivalent on a golf course is a [[greenskeeper]].{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) estimated in May 2015 that statistical group 37-3011 "Landscaping and Groundskeeping Workers" numbered 895,600 with a median annual wage of $25,030.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes373011.htm |title=Occupational Employment and Wages, May 2015 |publisher=bls.gov |date=2015-05-01 |accessdate=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BLS describes the functions of this group as "Workers typically perform a variety of tasks, which may include any combination of the following: sod laying, mowing, trimming, planting, watering, fertilizing, digging, raking, sprinkler installation, and installation of mortarless segmental concrete masonry wall units".

==Groundskeepers==
[[File:20120801 Wrigley Field groundscrew.JPG|thumb|[[Wrigley Field]] Grounds crew smooths the infield dirt.]]
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}
A groundskeeper's job requires a wide range of knowledge of horticulture, pest control, and weed abatement. As many institutions (especially schools) are moving away from the use of chemical pesticides and toward [[integrated pest management]] the experience, knowledge and scholastic requirements of top groundskeepers are increasing. While groundskeepers usually follow a site plan created by a [[landscape architecture|landscape architect]], there can be many opportunities for creativity in detailed design and presentation.

==Groundskeeping equipment==
{{see also|Equipment manager}}
'''Groundskeeping equipment''' comprise [[tool|implement]]s and [[vehicle]]s used in groundskeeping, including:

* [[mower]]s
* [[lawn mower]]s
* [[tractor]]s
* [[string trimmer]]s
* [[snow blower]]s
* [[snow plow]]s
* [[edger]]s
* [[string trimmer|rotary brushe]]s
* [[Rake (tool)|rake]]s
* [[leaf blower]]s
* [[shovel]]s
* [[trowel]]s
* [[irrigation sprinkler|sprinkler]]s
* [[garden tool]]s
* [[watering can]]s or truck mounted watering system (polyethylene tank and hoses)

==Environmental impact==
Pollution from gas-powered groundskeeping equipment is a significant source of air pollution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/air/community/details/yardequip.html Lawn Equipment | Improving Air Quality in Your Community | US EPA&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090428102707/http://www.epa.gov/air/community/details/yardequip.html |date=2009-04-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[US emission standard]]s specifically limit emissions from small engines.  Electric models produce no emissions at the point of use, but may shift pollution to power plants.  Emissions may still be reduced by the use of [[renewable energy]] in grid generation, or because central power plants generally must have stricter emissions control equipment installed.

==Groundskeepers in fiction==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}
Groundskeepers have appeared occasionally as minor characters in fiction and moving images. They are usually presented as comic or peculiar characters, often exhibiting a compulsive or obsessive personality defect.

Some examples of fictional groundskeepers include:

* On [[Cartoon Network]]'s animated series ''[[Regular Show]]'', Mordecai, Rigby, Skips, Muscle Man and High Five Ghost are Groundskeepers at a local city park
* [[Groundskeeper Willie]] is a gruff speaking Scot in the television animated series ''[[The Simpsons]]''. He is both a groundskeeper and a [[janitor]].
* Ben Weatherstaff in ''[[The Secret Garden]]'', is the only adult in the story to have some idea of the children's doings.
* Carl Spackler is an assistant groundskeeper played by actor [[Bill Murray]] in the movie ''[[Caddyshack]]'', who obsessively pursues the destruction of a [[gopher (animal)|gopher]] on the [[golf|golf course]] that he maintains.
* [[Boothby (Star Trek)|Boothby]] is the longtime [[Starfleet Academy]] groundskeeper and grandfatherly figure to many cadets in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' series ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation|The Next Generation]]'', ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine|Deep Space Nine]]'', and ''[[Star Trek: Voyager|Voyager]]''.
* Chauncey Gardiner, played by [[Peter Sellers]] in ''[[Being There]]''. In this case the character is central to the plot. Although of limited intelligence (from our viewpoint) he uniquely mirrors all who interact with him and so becomes a popular persona, even to the point of being suggested by others as a possible United States presidential candidate.
* In the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' book series, [[Rubeus Hagrid]] is the [[Half-giant|Half-Giant]] groundskeeper at Hogwarts.

'''''Halloween: Resurrection''''' is a 2002 American [[slasher film]] directed by [[Rick Rosenthal]], who had also directed ''[[Halloween II (1981 film)|Halloween II]]'' in 1981. Larry Brand and [[Sean Hood]] devised the screenplay. The film stars [[Busta Rhymes]], [[Bianca Kajlich]], [[Thomas Ian Nicholas]], [[Ryan Merriman]], [[Sean Patrick Thomas]], [[Katee Sackhoff]], [[Daisy McCrackin]], [[Luke Kirby]] and [[Tyra Banks]], with [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] reprising her role as [[Laurie Strode]]. The eighth installment in the ''[[Halloween (franchise)|Halloween]]'' series, it follows [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]] continuing his murderous rampage in his hometown of Haddonfield, when his old, derelict childhood home is used for a live internet horror show.

''Halloween: Resurrection'' was released on July 12, 2002, to largely negative reviews, receiving an 11% score on [[Rotten Tomatoes]],&lt;ref name="rotten"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/halloween_resurrection/|title=Halloween: Resurrection|last=|first=|date=|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=November 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; with many considering it to be an unnecessary sequel to ''[[Halloween H20: 20 Years Later]]''. Despite heavy criticism, ''Resurrection'' was a minor box office success, earning $37.7 million. Although more sequels were planned to follow ''Resurrection'', the series was eventually [[Reboot (media)|rebooted]] with [[Rob Zombie]]'s ''[[Halloween (2007 film)|Halloween]]''.

==Plot==
On October 31, 2001, three years after [[Laurie Strode]] accidentally killed a paramedic with whom her brother [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]] had swapped clothes, a guilt-ridden Laurie is an inmate at the Grace Andersen Sanitarium, where the nurses believe her to be [[catatonic]]. Instead, she is preparing for Michael's return. Laurie, pretending to be heavily medicated, prepares herself for the inevitable confrontation with her brother. Michael breaches the facility and kills two security guards, decapitating one and slitting the throat of the other as he makes his way to Laurie. After a chase, Laurie lures Michael on to the institution's rooftop. Although he falls into her trap, Laurie's fears of again killing the wrong person get the better of her; when she tries to remove his mask, Michael stabs her and throws her off the roof to her death. Michael then returns home to his abandoned childhood house. 

One year later, college students Bill Woodlake, Donna Chang, Jen Danzig, Jim Morgan, Rudy Grimes, and Sara Moyer win a competition to appear on an Internet reality show ''Dangertainment'', directed by Freddie Harris and his friend, Nora Winston, in which they have to spend a night in Michael's home in order to figure out what led him to kill. On Halloween, equipped with head-cameras as well as the cameras throughout the house, they enter the house and separate into three groups. Sara's messaging friend Deckard watches the broadcast during a Halloween party. Meanwhile, Michael suddenly appears and kills Bill, and cameraman Charlie.

Donna and Jim discover a wall filled with fake corpses and realize the show is a setup. Myers kills Donna; at the party, Deckard and other partygoers witness the murder, and only Deckard realizes that the murder was real. Freddie goes through the house dressed as Michael, but is secretly followed by the real Michael. Freddie, mistaking Michael for Charlie, tells him to go to the garage and help Nora out; he goes to the garage and promptly kills Nora. When Rudy, Sara, and Jim find Freddie in the Myers costume, he reveals the scheme to them and begs them to cooperate, telling them that he has set up a nice payday for all of them. When he leaves, the trio decides to gather up the other three and leave. Jen discovers the body of Bill and is decapitated by Myers right in front of Rudy, Sara, and Jim. Michael kills Jim and Rudy before chasing Sara upstairs.

Locking herself in a bedroom, Sara begs for Deckard to help her. The other party goers realize that the deaths have not been staged. With Deckard messaging her Myers' location, Sara escapes and is found by Freddie. Myers finds and attacks them. Michael subdues Freddie and Sara makes her way to the tunnels. She finds an exit near Donna's body and emerges in the garage, where Myers finds her and starts an electrical fire in the garage. Freddie appears and begins fighting Michael hand-to-hand, before finally electrocuting him, and carrying Sara out of the burning garage. The Myers house burns to the ground, as Sara thanks Deckard for saving her life. Michael's body and the bodies of his victims are then taken to the morgue. As the medical examiner begins to inspect Michael's body, he awakens.

==Production==
The writers of ''[[Halloween H20: 20 Years Later]]'' were left with a dilemma when [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] wanted to end the series, but [[Moustapha Akkad]] had a clause that legally wouldn't allow the writers to kill [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]] off. According to the Blu-ray released by [[Scream Factory]], Curtis almost left the project just weeks before filming, until [[Kevin Williamson (screenwriter)|Kevin Williamson]] came up with the paramedic storyline and presented it to Akkad. Curtis finally agreed to be a part of the film under the condition that no footage hinting toward a sequel would be presented by the film, and that the audience would believe that Michael was dead until the inevitable sequel was announced. ''Resurrection''{{'}}s first shot of Michael in the paramedic uniform was filmed the day after ''H20''{{'}}s principal photography ended, according to ''H20''{{'}}s editor, [[Patrick Lussier]].

Both Whitney Ransick and [[Dwight H. Little]] were approached to direct the film but turned it down. Later [[Rick Rosenthal]], the director of ''[[Halloween II (1981 film)|Halloween II]]'', was chosen to direct. During the casting period of the film, producers considered [[Danielle Harris]] (who played [[Jamie Lloyd]] in ''[[Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers]]'' and ''[[Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers]]'') for a role in the film. In post-production, [[Bianca Kajlich]]'s screams had to be [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] because of her inability to scream. The film's trailer was delivered on April 26, 2002, with the release of ''[[Jason X]]''. Principal photography began in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]] on May 14, 2001 with the opening scene filmed at Riverview Hospital in Coquitlam, BC.&lt;ref name="halloweenmovies"&gt;''Halloween: Resurrection'' Behind The Scenes at [http://www.halloweenmovies.com/filmarchive/h8bts.htm HalloweenMovies.com] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130124225756/http://www.halloweenmovies.com/filmarchive/h8bts.htm |date=2013-01-24 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
For this eighth installment of the series, [[Danny Lux]] created a genuine score relying upon the original instead of generating something new. He approaches the score with an [[Electroacoustic music|electro-acoustic]] feel that dates back to the [[synthesizer]] scores of the '80s.&lt;ref name="musicfromthemovies"&gt;''Halloween: Resurrection'' Music Review at [http://www.musicfromthemovies.com/review.asp?ID=1621 Music from the Movies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029043128/http://www.musicfromthemovies.com/review.asp?ID=1621 |date=2008-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film also features several rap and [[hip-hop]] songs.&lt;ref name=newt/&gt;

In direct contrast to general critical reviews of the film, some assessments of its sound and theme music have been praising. For example, critic Steve Newton complimented the film's "creepy" and "unsettling" revival of the original iconic theme, while criticising the film itself, as well as the rap tracks included.&lt;ref name=newt&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earofnewt.com/2014/02/08/horror-review-halloween-resurrection/|accessdate=February 4, 2015|title=Horror Review: Halloween - Resurrection|date=February 8, 2014|first=Steve|last=Newton|publisher=[http://earofnewt.com/ earofnewt.com]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Box office===
''Halloween: Resurrection'' was released on July 12, 2002 in the US to moderate reception which did not change in its later international release. The film peaked at #4 on its opening weekend on US screens raking in $12,292,121 behind ''[[Reign of Fire (film)|Reign of Fire]]'', ''[[Road to Perdition]]'' and ''[[Men in Black II]]''. It grossed $30,354,442 domestically and a further $7,310,413 for a moderate $37,664,855 worldwide gross.&lt;ref name="boxofficemojo"&gt;''Halloween: '' at [http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=halloween8.htm Box Office Mojo]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical response===
The film received highly unfavorable reviews from several critics. It has garnered a score of 11% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 62 reviews, with the site's consensus being: "The only thing this tired slasher flick may resurrect is nostalgia for when the genre was still fresh and scary."&lt;ref name=rotten/&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 19 out of 100, based on 17 reviews, indicating “overwhelming dislike”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Halloween: Resurrection|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/halloween-resurrection|accessdate=2018-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lou Lumenick of the ''[[New York Post]]'' said, "It's so devoid of joy and energy it makes even ''[[Jason X]]'' look positively [[William Shakespeare|Shakespearian]] by comparison." Dave Kehr of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said, "Spectators will indeed sit open-mouthed before the screen, not screaming but yawning."&lt;ref name="newyorktimes"&gt;''Halloween: Resurrection'' Movie Review at [https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9407E6D81130F930A25754C0A9649C8B63 New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' said, "Every sequel you skip will be two hours gained. Consider this review life-affirming." Joe Leydon of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said, "[Seems] even more uselessly redundant and shamelessly money-grubbing than most third-rate horror sequels."  Glenn Lovell of the ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]'' was slightly more positive: "No, it's not as single-minded as [[John Carpenter]]'s original, but it's sure a lot smarter and more unnerving than the sequels."{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref name="CinemaScore"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://m.cinemascore.com |title=CinemaScore |work=cinemascore.com }}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{IPA notice}}'''[[Hindustani language|Hindustani]]''' is the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of northern [[India]] and [[Pakistan]], and through its two standardized [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]]s, [[Hindi]] and [[Urdu]], an official language of India and Pakistan. Phonological differences between the two standards are minimal.

[[File:Hindi vowel chart.svg|thumb|upright=1.27|right|The oral vowel phonemes of Hindi according to {{Harvcoltxt|Ohala|1999|p=102}}]]Hindustani natively possesses a symmetrical ten-vowel system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Masica|1991|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vowels {{IPA|[ə], [ɪ], [ʊ]}} are always short in length, while the vowels {{IPA|[ɑː]}}, {{IPA|[iː]}}, {{IPA|[uː]}}, {{IPA|[eː]}}, {{IPA|[oː]}}, {{IPA|[ɛː]}}, {{IPA|[ɔː]}} are always considered long, in addition to an eleventh vowel {{IPA|/æː/}} which is found in [[English language|English]] [[loanword]]s (but see the details below).

=== Vowel {{IPA|[ə]}} ===

Schwa is a short vowel which vanishes to nothing at unstressed position. {{IPA|/ə/}} is often realized more open than mid {{IPAblink|ə}}, i.e. as near-open {{IPAblink|ɐ}}.&lt;ref name="ohala102"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Ohala|1999|p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vowel {{IPA|[ɑː]}} ===

The open back vowel is transcribed in IPA by either {{IPA|[aː]}} or {{IPA|[ɑː]}}.

=== Vowels {{IPA|[ɪ], [ʊ]}}, {{IPA|[iː]}}, {{IPA|[uː]}} ===

Among the [[close vowel]]s, what in [[Sanskrit]] are thought to have been primarily distinctions of [[vowel length]] (that is {{IPA|/i ~ iː/}} and {{IPA|/u ~ uː/}}), have become in Hindustani distinctions of [[Vowel quality|quality]], or length accompanied by quality (that is, {{IPA|/ɪ ~ iː/}} and {{IPA|/ʊ ~ uː/}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Masica|1991|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historical opposition of length in the close vowels has been neutralized in word-final position, for example Sanskrit loans {{transl|hi|śakti}} ({{lang|hi|शक्ति}} – {{lang|ur|{{nastaliq|شَکتی}}}} 'energy') and {{transl|hi|vastu}} ({{lang|hi|वस्तु}} – {{lang|ur|{{nastaliq|وَستُو}}}} 'item') are {{IPA|/ʃəkti/}} and {{IPA|/ʋəstu/}}, not *{{IPA|/ʃəktɪ/}} and *{{IPA|/ʋəstʊ/}}.&lt;ref name="Harvcoltxt|Shapiro|2003|p=258"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Shapiro|2003|p=258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vowels {{IPA|[ɛ]}}, {{IPA|[ɛː]}} ===

The vowel represented graphically as {{lang|hi|ऐ}} – {{lang|ur|{{nastaliq|اَے}}}} (romanized as {{transl|hi|ai}}) has been variously transcribed as {{IPA|[ɛː]}} or {{IPA|[æː]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Masica|1991|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among sources for this article, {{Harvcoltxt|Ohala|1999}}, pictured to the right, uses {{IPA|[ɛː]}}, while {{Harvcoltxt|Shapiro|2003|p=258}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Masica|1991|p=110}} use {{IPA|[æː]}}. Furthermore, an eleventh vowel {{IPA|/æː/}} is found in [[English language|English]] [[loanword]]s, such as {{IPA|/bæːʈ/}} ('[[Cricket bat|bat]]').&lt;ref name="Harvcoltxt|Ohala|1999|p=101"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Ohala|1999|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hereafter, {{lang|hi|ऐ}} – {{lang|ur|{{nastaliq|اَے}}}} (romanized as {{transl|hi|ai}}) will be represented as {{IPA|[ɛː]}} to distinguish it from {{IPA|/æː/}}, the latter. Despite this, the Hindustani vowel system is quite similar to that of English, in contrast to the consonants.

| &lt;big&gt;{{IPA link|ə}}&lt;/big&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{IPA|[ɛ]}} occurs as a conditioned allophone of {{IPA|/ə/}} near an {{IPA|/ɦ/}} surrounded on both sides by schwas. Usually, the second schwa undergoes syncopation, and the resultant is just an {{IPA|[ɛ]}} preceding an {{IPA|/ɦ/}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, {{IPA|[ɛ]}} occurs as a conditioned [[allophone]] of {{IPA|/ə/}} ([[schwa]]) in proximity to {{IPA|/ɦ/}}, if and only if the {{IPA|/ɦ/}} is surrounded on both sides by two schwas.&lt;ref name="Harvcoltxt|Shapiro|2003|p=258"/&gt; and is realised as separate vowel. For example, in {{transl|hi|kahanā}} {{IPA|/kəɦ(ə)naː/}} ({{lang|hi|कहना}} – {{lang|ur|{{nastaliq|کَہنا}}}} 'to say'), the {{IPA|/ɦ/}} is surrounded on both sides by schwa, hence both the schwas will become fronted to short {{IPA|[ɛ]}}, giving the pronunciation {{IPA|[kɛɦɛnaː]}}. Syncopation of phonemic middle schwa can further occur to give {{IPA|[kɛɦ.naː]}}. The fronting also occurs in word-final {{IPA|/ɦ/}}, presumably because a lone consonant carries an unpronounced schwa. Hence, {{transl|hi|kaha!}} {{IPA|/kəɦ(ə)/}} ({{lang|hi|कह}} – {{lang|ur|{{nastaliq|کَہہ}}}} 'say!') becomes {{IPA|[kɛh]}} in actual pronunciation. However, the fronting of schwa does not occur in words with a schwa only on one side of the {{IPA|/ɦ/}} such as {{transl|hi|kahānī}} {{IPA|/kəɦaːniː/}} ({{lang|hi|कहानी}} – {{lang|ur|{{nastaliq|کَہانی}}}} 'a story') or {{transl|hi|bāhar}} {{IPA|/baːɦər/}} ({{lang|hi|बाहर}} – {{lang|ur|{{nastaliq|باہَر}}}} 'outside').

=== Vowels {{IPA|[ɔ]}}, {{IPA|[ɔː]}} ===

The vowel {{IPA|[ɔ]}} occurs in proximity to {{IPA|/ɦ/}} if the {{IPA|/ɦ/}} is surrounded by one of the sides by a schwa and on other side by a round vowel. It differs from the vowel {{IPA|[ɔː]}} in that it is a short vowel. For example, in {{transl|hi|bahut}} {{IPA|/bəɦʊt/}} the {{IPA|/ɦ/}} is surrounded on one side by a schwa and a round vowel on the other side. One or both of the schwas will become {{IPA|[ɔ]}} giving the pronunciation {{IPA|[bɔɦɔt]}}.

=== Nasalization of vowels ===

As in French and Portuguese, there are nasalized vowels in Hindustani. There is disagreement over the issue of the nature of [[nasal vowel|nasalization]] (barring English-loaned {{IPA|/æ/}} which is never nasalized&lt;ref name="Harvcoltxt|Ohala|1999|p=101" /&gt;). {{Harvcoltxt|Masica|1991|p=117}} presents four differing viewpoints:

# there are no {{IPA|*[ẽ]}} and {{IPA|*[õ]}}, possibly because of the effect of nasalization on vowel quality;
# there is phonemic nasalization of all vowels;
# all vowel nasalization is predictable (i.e. allophonic);
# Nasalized long vowel phonemes ({{IPA|/ɑ̃ː ĩː ũː ẽː ɛ̃ː õː ɔ̃ː/}}) occur word-finally and before voiceless stops; instances of nasalized short vowels ({{IPA|[ə̃ ɪ̃ ʊ̃]}}) and of nasalized long vowels before voiced stops (the latter, presumably because of a deleted [[nasal stop|nasal consonant]]) are allophonic.

Masica&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Masica|1991|pp=117–118}}&lt;/ref&gt; supports this last view.

Hindustani has a core set of 28 [[consonant]]s inherited from earlier [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]]. Supplementing these are 2 consonants that are internal developments in specific word-medial contexts,&lt;ref name="Harvcoltxt|Shapiro|2003|p=260"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Shapiro|2003|p=260}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 7 consonants originally found in loan words, whose expression is dependent on factors such as status (class, education, etc.) and cultural register (Modern Standard Hindi vs Urdu).

Most native consonants may occur [[gemination|geminate]] (doubled in length; exceptions are {{IPA|/bʱ, ɽ, ɽʱ, ɦ/}}). Geminate consonants are always medial and preceded by one of the interior vowels (that is, {{IPA|/ə/}}, {{IPA|/ɪ/}}, or {{IPA|/ʊ/}}). They all occur monomorphemically except {{IPA|[ʃː]}}, which occurs only in a few Sanskrit loans where a [[morpheme]] boundary could be posited in between, e.g. {{IPA|/nɪʃ + ʃiːl/}} for {{transl|hi|niśśīl}} {{IPA|[nɪʃʃiːl]}} ('without shame').&lt;ref name="Harvcoltxt|Ohala|1999|p=101"/&gt;&lt;!---what about antar-rashtriya... which is incorrect Sandhi according to Masica anyway?---&gt;

For the English speaker, a notable feature of the Hindustani consonants is that there is a four-way distinction of [[phonation]] among [[plosive]]s, rather than the two-way distinction found in English. The phonations are:

# [[tenuis consonant|tenuis]], as {{IPA|/p/}}, which is like {{angbr|p}} in English ''spin''
# [[voice (phonetics)|voiced]], as {{IPA|/b/}}, which is like {{angbr|b}} in English ''bin''
# [[Aspirated consonant|aspirated]], as {{IPA|/pʰ/}}, which is like {{angbr|p}} in English ''pin'', and
# [[breathy voice|murmured]], as {{IPA|/bʱ/}}.

The last is commonly called "voiced aspirate", though {{Harvcoltxt|Shapiro|2003|p=260}} notes that,
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Evidence from experimental [[phonetics]], however, has demonstrated that the two types of sounds involve two distinct types of voicing and release mechanisms. The series of so-called voice aspirates should now properly be considered to involve the voicing mechanism of murmur, in which the air flow passes through an aperture between the [[arytenoid cartilage]]s, as opposed to passing between the ligamental vocal bands."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The murmured consonants are believed to be a [[Linguistic reconstruction#Reflex|reflex]] of murmured consonants in Proto-Indo-European, a phonation that is absent in all branches of the Indo-European family except Indo-Aryan and Armenian.

; Notes
* Marginal and non-universal phonemes are in parentheses.
* {{IPA|/ɽ/}} is lateral {{IPAblink|ɺ̢}} for some speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Masica|1991|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{fix|text=can the aspirated {{IPA|(ɽʱ)}} also be lateral?|date=July 2015}}
* {{IPA|/ɣ/}} is [[Voiced velar fricative|post-velar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Kachru|2006|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stops in final position are not released; {{IPA|/ʋ/}} varies freely with {{IPA|[v]}}, and can also be pronounced {{IPA|[w]}}; {{IPA|/ɾ/}} can surface as a trill {{IPA|[r]}} (mostly in word-initial and syllable-final positions), and geminate {{IPA|/ɾː/}} is always a trill, e.g. {{transl|hi|zarā}} {{IPA|[zəɾaː]}} ({{lang|hi|ज़रा}} – {{lang|ur|{{nastaliq|ذرا}}}} 'little') versus well-trilled {{transl|hi|zarrā}} {{IPA|[zəraː]}} ({{lang|hi|ज़र्रा}} – {{lang|ur|{{nastaliq|ذرّہ}}}} 'particle'), this happens in loanwords of [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] origin.&lt;ref name="ohala102"/&gt; The [[Palatal nasal|palatal]] and [[velar nasal]]s {{IPA|[ɲ, ŋ]}} occur only in consonant clusters, where each nasal is followed by a [[homorganic]] stop, as an allophone of a [[nasal vowel]] followed by a stop, and in Sanskrit loanwords.&lt;ref name="Harvcoltxt|Shapiro|2003|p=260"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ohala102"/&gt;  There are murmured [[sonorant]]s, {{IPA|[lʱ, ɾʱ, mʱ, nʱ]}}, but these are considered to be consonant clusters with {{IPA|/ɦ/}} in the analysis adopted by {{Harvcoltxt|Ohala|1999}}.

The fricative {{IPA|/ɦ/}} in Hindustani is typically voiced (as {{IPA|[ɦ]}}), especially when surrounded by vowels, but there is no phonemic difference between this voiceless fricative and its voiced counterpart (Hindustani's ancestor Sanskrit ''has'' such a phonemic distinction).

Hindustani also has a phonemic difference between the dental plosives and the so-called retroflex plosives. The dental plosives in Hindustani are laminal-denti alveolar as in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and the tongue-tip must be well in contact with the back of the upper front teeth. The retroflex series is not purely retroflex; it actually has an apico-postalveolar (also described as apico-pre-palatal) articulation, and sometimes in words such as {{transl|hi|ṭūṭā}} {{IPA|/ʈuːʈaː/}} ({{lang|hi|टूटा}} – {{lang|ur|{{nastaliq|ٹُوٹا}}}} 'broken') it even becomes alveolar.&lt;ref&gt;Tiwari, Bholanath ([1966] 2004) {{lang|hi|हिन्दी भाषा}} ({{transl|hi|Hindī Bhāshā}}), Kitāb Mahal, Allahabad, {{ISBN|81-225-0017-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some [[Indo-Aryan languages]], the plosives {{IPA|[ɖ, ɖʱ]}} and the [[Flap consonant|flaps]] {{IPA|[ɽ, ɽʱ]}} are [[allophone]]s in complementary distribution, with the former occurring in initial, geminate and postnasal positions and the latter occurring in intervocalic and final positions. However, in Standard Hindi they contrast in similar positions, as in {{transl|hi|nīṛaj}} ({{lang|hi|नीड़ज}} – {{lang|ur|{{nastaliq|نیڑج}}}} 'bird') vs {{transl|hi|niḍar}} ({{lang|hi|निडर}} – {{lang|ur|{{nastaliq|نڈر}}}} 'fearless').&lt;ref name="masicapage97"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Masica|1991|p=97|quote=''.. The retroflex flap [ṛ] is often taken as an allophone of /ḍ/, with which it often stands in complementary distribution: initial, geminate, and postnasal for [ḍ]; intervocalic, final, and before or after other consonants for [ṛ]. It has, however, come to contrast with [ḍ] in at least some environments in Punjabi (sāṛī/sāḍī 'burnt'/'our,fsg.'), "Lahnda" (naṛī/vaḍī 'reed'/'big,f'), Sindhi (jhāṛū/pāḍū 'tree'/'ruin'), in Modern Standard Hindi (as noted earlier) (nīṛaj/niḍar 'bird'/'fearless', toṛ/roḍ 'break!'/'road' &lt; Eng.), and in Bengali (primarily though English loans, cf Ferguson and Chowdhury 1960). It may be or is reported as phonemic also in Shina and some other Dardic languages, Dogri, Rajasthani (except Southern Mewari, Lamani, and Gujuri), various Western Hindi dialects (Haryanvi, Braj, Bundeli), and in several West Pahari dialects, notably the westernmost. ..''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allophony of {{IPA|[v]}} and {{IPA|[w]}}===
{{IPA|[v]}} and {{IPA|[w]}} are [[allophone]]s in Hindustani. These are distinct phonemes in English, but both are allophones of the phoneme {{IPA|/ʋ/}} in Hindustani (written {{angbr|{{lang|hi|व}}}} in Hindi or {{angbr|{{lang|ur|{{nastaliq|و}}}}}} in Urdu), especially in loanwords of [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] origin. More specifically, they are ''[[complementary distribution#in phonology|conditional allophones]]'', i.e. rules apply on whether {{angbr|{{lang|hi|व}}}} is pronounced as {{IPA|[v]}} or {{IPA|[w]}} depending on context. Native Hindi speakers pronounce {{angbr|{{lang|hi|व}}}} as {{IPA|[v]}} in {{transl|hi|vrat}} ({{lang|hi|व्रत}} – {{lang|ur|{{nastaliq|ورت}}}}, 'vow') and {{IPA|[w]}} in {{transl|hi|pakwān}} ({{lang|hi|पकवान}} – {{lang|ur|{{nastaliq|پکوان}}}} 'food dish'), treating them as a single phoneme and without being aware of the allophonic distinctions, though these are apparent to native English speakers. The rule is that the consonant is pronounced as semivowel {{IPA|[w]}} in onglide position, i.e. between an onset consonant and a following vowel.&lt;ref name="ref25lojir"&gt;{{Citation | title=Implications of Hindi Prosodic Structure (Current Trends in Phonology: Models and Methods) | author=Janet Pierrehumbert, Rami Nair | publisher=European Studies Research Institute, University of Salford Press, 1996 | isbn=978-1-901471-02-1 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_jqjQwAACAAJ | quote=''... showed extremely regular patterns. As is not uncommon in a study of subphonemic detail, the objective data patterned much more cleanly than intuitive judgments ... {{IPA|[w]}} occurs when /{{lang|hi|व}} {{lang|ur|{{nastaliq|و}}}}/ is in onglide position ... {{IPA|[v]}} occurs otherwise ...''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the allophone phenomenon becomes obvious when speakers switch languages. When speakers of other languages that have a distinction between {{IPA|[v]}} and {{IPA|[w]}} speak Hindustani, they might pronounce {{angbr|{{lang|hi|व}} {{lang|ur|{{nastaliq|و}}}}}} in {{transl|hi|vrat}} ({{lang|hi|व्रत}} – {{lang|ur|{{nastaliq|ورت}}}}) as {{IPA|[w]}}, i.e. as {{IPA|[wɾət]}} instead of the correct {{IPA|[vɾət]}}. This results in an intelligibility problem because {{IPA|[wɾət]}} can easily be confused for {{transl|hi|aurat}} ({{lang|hi|औरत}} {{lang|ur|{{nastaliq|عورت}}}}) {{IPA|[ˈɔːɾət]}}, which means "woman" instead of "vow" in Hindustani. Similarly, Hindustani speakers might unconsciously apply their native allophony rules to English words, pronouncing ''war'' {{IPA|/wɔːɹ/}} as {{IPA|[vɔːɹ]}} or ''advance'' {{IPA|/ədˈvɑːns/}} as {{IPA|[ədˈwɑːns]}}, which can result in intelligibility problems with native English speakers.&lt;ref name="ref25lojir"/&gt;

In some situations, the allophony is non-conditional, i.e. the speaker can choose {{IPA|[v]}}, {{IPA|[w]}} or an intermediate sound based on personal habit and preference, and still be perfectly intelligible. This includes words such as ''advait'' ({{lang|hi|अद्वैत}} – {{lang|ur|{{nastaliq|ادویت}}}}) which can be pronounced equally correctly as {{IPA|[ədˈwɛːt]}} or {{IPA|[ədˈvɛːt]}}.&lt;ref name="ref25lojir"/&gt;

===External borrowing===
Loanwords from [[Sanskrit]] reintroduced {{IPA|/ɳ/}} into formal Modern Standard Hindi. In casual speech it is usually replaced by {{IPA|/n/}}.&lt;ref name="Harvcoltxt|Ohala|1999|p=101"/&gt; It does not occur initially and has a nasalized flap {{IPA|[ɽ̃]}} as a common [[allophone]].&lt;ref name="Harvcoltxt|Shapiro|2003|p=260"/&gt;

Loanwords from [[Persian language|Persian]] (including some words which Persian itself borrowed from Arabic or Turkish) introduced five consonants, {{IPA|/f, z, q, x, ɣ/}}. Being Persian in origin, these are seen as a defining feature of Urdu, although these sounds officially exist in Hindi and modified [[Devanagari]] characters are available to represent them.&lt;ref name="A Primer for Modern Standard Hindi"&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=vvuP8sD1wloC&amp;pg=PR5&amp;lpg=PR5&amp;dq=A+Primer+of+modern+standard+Hindi++By+Michael+C.+Shapiro&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ncOBlKHXfm&amp;sig=oFtsGyFfUQlQleSePMzV4Ja6ndY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=RMKUSrWCAo2QNrrS2fkH&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false| title =  A Primer of Modern Standard Hindi|publisher = Motilal Banarsidass|accessdate = 2009-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Association for Computational Linguistics"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/C/C08/C08-1068.pdf| title =  Hindi Urdu Machine Transliteration using Finite-state Transducers|publisher = Association for Computational Linguistics|accessdate = 2009-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among these, {{IPA|/f, z/}}, also found in English and Portuguese loanwords, are now considered well-established in Hindi; indeed, {{IPA|/f/}} appears to be encroaching upon and replacing {{IPA|/pʰ/}} even in native (non-Persian, non-English) Hindi words, as happened in Greek with [[phi]].&lt;ref name="Harvcoltxt|Shapiro|2003|p=260"/&gt;  This {{IPA|/pʰ/}} to {{IPA|/f/}} shift also occasionally occurs in Urdu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OtCPAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=editions:oREZJn85rOIC&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=c_yiVPawD9eiyATfiILYBA&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=urdu%20fir&amp;f=false|title=The Indo-Aryan Languages|first1=Danesh|last1=Jain|first2=George|last2=Cardona|date=26 July 2007|publisher=Routledge|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The other three Persian loans, {{IPA|/q, x, ɣ/}}, are still considered to fall under the domain of Urdu, and are also used by many Hindi speakers; however, some Hindi speakers assimilate these sounds to {{IPA|/k, kʰ, ɡ/}} respectively.&lt;ref name="A Primer for Modern Standard Hindi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harvcoltxt|Masica|1991|p=92"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Masica|1991|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sibilant {{IPA|/ʃ/}} is found in loanwords from all sources (English, Persian, Sanskrit) and is well-established.&lt;ref name="Harvcoltxt|Ohala|1999|p=101"/&gt;  The failure to maintain {{IPA|/f, z, ʃ/}} by some Hindi speakers (often non-urban speakers who confuse them with {{IPA|/pʰ, dʒ, s/}}) is considered nonstandard.&lt;ref name="A Primer for Modern Standard Hindi"/&gt; Yet these same speakers, having a Sanskritic education, may hyperformally uphold {{IPA|/ɳ/}} and [[Voiceless_retroflex_sibilant|{{IPA|[ʂ]}}]]. In contrast, for native speakers of Urdu, the maintenance of {{IPA|/f, z, ʃ/}} is not commensurate with education and sophistication, but is characteristic of all social levels.&lt;ref name="Harvcoltxt|Masica|1991|p=92"/&gt;The sibliant {{IPA|/ʒ/}} is very rare and is found in loanwords from Persian and English and is considered to fall under the domain of Urdu and although it is officially present in Hindi, many speakers of Hindi assimilate it to {{IPA|/z/}} or {{IPA|/dʒ/}}.

Being the main sources from which Hindustani draws its higher, learned terms– English, Sanskrit, [[Arabic]], and to a lesser extent Persian provide loanwords with a rich array of [[consonant cluster]]s. The introduction of these clusters into the language contravenes a historical tendency within its native core vocabulary to eliminate clusters through processes such as cluster reduction and [[epenthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Shapiro|2003|p=261}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Harvcoltxt|Schmidt|2003|p=293}} lists distinctively Sanskrit/Hindi biconsonantal clusters of initial {{IPA|/kɾ, kʃ, st, sʋ, ʃɾ, sn, nj/}} and final {{IPA|/tʋ, ʃʋ, nj, lj, ɾʋ, dʒj, ɾj/}}, and distinctively Perso-Arabic/Urdu biconsonantal clusters of final {{IPA|/ft, ɾf, mt, mɾ, ms, kl, tl, bl, sl, tm, lm, ɦm, ɦɾ/}}.

==Suprasegmental features==
Hindustani has a [[stress accent]], but it is not as important as in [[English language#Characteristics of intonation|English]]. To predict stress placement, the concept of [[syllable weight]] is needed:
* A light syllable (one [[mora (linguistics)|mora]]) ends in a short vowel {{IPA|/ə, ɪ, ʊ/}}: V
* A heavy syllable (two moras) ends in a long vowel {{IPA|/aː, iː, uː, eː, ɛː, oː, ɔː/}} or in a short vowel and a consonant: VV, VC
* An extra-heavy syllable (three moras) ends in a long vowel and a consonant, or a short vowel and two consonants: VVC, VCC
Stress is on the heaviest syllable of the word, and in the event of a tie, on the last such syllable. If all syllables are light, the penultimate is stressed. However, the final mora of the word is ignored when making this assignment (Hussein 1997) [or, equivalently, the final syllable is stressed either if it is extra-heavy, and there is no other extra-heavy syllable in the word or if it is heavy, and there is no other heavy or extra-heavy syllable in the word]. For example, with the ignored mora in parentheses:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Hayes|1995|p=276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Content words in Hindustani normally begin on a low [[Intonation (linguistics)|pitch]], followed by a rise in pitch.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.und.nodak.edu/dept/linguistics/theses/2001Dyrud.PDF Dyrud, Lars O. (2001)  ''Hindi-Urdu: Stress Accent or Non-Stress Accent?''

(1996)  ''Word Boundary Detection Using Pitch Variations.'' ([[IIT Madras]], Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering)&lt;/ref&gt; Strictly speaking, Hindustani, like most other Indian languages, is rather a [[syllable-timed language]]. The [[schwa]] {{IPA|/ə/}} has a strong tendency to vanish into nothing (syncopated) if its syllable is unaccented.

'''Holophrastic indeterminacy''', or '''indeterminacy of sentence translation''', is one of two kinds of [[indeterminacy of translation]] to appear in the writings of philosopher [[Willard Quine|W. V. O. Quine]].&lt;ref name=Quine/&gt; According to Quine, "there is more than one correct method of translating sentences where the two translations differ not merely in the meanings attributed to the sub-sentential parts of speech but also in the net import of the whole sentence".&lt;ref name=Quine1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Quine2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hylton/&gt; It is holophrastic indeterminacy that underlies Quine's argument against synonymy, the basis of his objections to [[Rudolf Carnap]]'s [[Analytic/synthetic distinction#Quine.27s criticisms and responses|analytic/synthetic distinction]].&lt;ref name=Hylton2/&gt; The other kind of indeterminacy introduced by Quine is the "[[inscrutability of reference]]", which refers to parts of a sentence or individual words.

==Indeterminacy of translation==
{{main|Indeterminacy of translation|Radical translation}}
Quine's work on indeterminacy of translation, stemming from the basic forms of indeterminacy,&lt;ref name=Quine1/&gt; is widely discussed in modern analytic philosophy:

{{quote|W. V. O. Quine's contention that translation is indeterminate has been among the most widely discussed and controversial theses in modern analytical philosophy. It is a standard-bearer for one of the late twentieth century's most characteristic philosophical preoccupations: the skepticism about semantic notions which is also developed in [[Saul Kripke|Kripke's]] interpretation of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] on rules... and which many have read into [[Hilary Putnam|Putnam's]] 'model-theoretic' assault on realism...[Cross references to chapters 15 and 17 omitted]&lt;ref name=Wright/&gt;|Crispin Wright|The indeterminacy of translation }}

Quine's approach to translation, [[radical translation]], takes the perspective of trying to establish the meaning of sentences in a foreign language (Quine calls it ''Arunta'') by observing and questioning native speakers of that language.&lt;ref name=Malpas/&gt;&lt;ref name=Blackman/&gt;  It is a hypothetical version of what could be an empirical investigation. By an armchair analysis of such an adventure, Quine argues that it is impossible to construct a unique translation that can be defended as better than all others. The reason is predicated upon an argued ''unavoidable'' introduction of the two indeterminacies above. According to [[Hilary Putnam]], it is “what may well be the most fascinating and the most discussed philosophical argument since Kant’s Transcendental Deduction of the Categories”.&lt;ref name=Putnam/&gt;

==Naturalized epistemology==
{{Main|Naturalized epistemology}}
Holophrastic indeterminacy is important to the understanding of Quine's naturalized epistemology. As Quine states his thesis:
{{quote|"If the English sentences of a theory have their meaning only together as a body, then we can justify their translation into ''Arunta'' [a hypothetical foreign language] only together as a body...Any translations of the English sentences into ''Arunta'' sentences will be as correct as any other, so long as the net empirical implications of the theory as a whole are preserved in translation. But it is to be expected that many different ways of translating the component sentences, essentially different individually, would deliver the same empirical implications for the theory as a whole; deviations in the translation of one component sentence could be compensated for in the translation of another component sentence. Insofar, there can be no ground for saying which of two glaringly unlike translations of individual sentences is right."&lt;ref name=Quine3/&gt;|Willard V. O. Quine|Epistemology naturalized, p. 80}}

Quine's naturalized epistemology in brief is the view that instead of traditional attempts to connect how our beliefs relate to evidence, epistemology should focus upon how experience leads to beliefs: the causal connections between our sensory evidence and our beliefs about the world. .&lt;ref name=Feldman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bayer/&gt;

The '''input hypothesis''', also known as the '''monitor model''', is a group of five hypotheses of [[second-language acquisition]] developed by the linguist [[Stephen Krashen]] in the 1970s and 1980s. Krashen originally formulated the input hypothesis as just one of the five hypotheses, but over time the term has come to refer to the five hypotheses as a group. The hypotheses are the input hypothesis, the acquisition–learning hypothesis, the monitor hypothesis, the natural order hypothesis and the affective filter hypothesis. The input hypothesis was first published in 1977.&lt;ref name="Krashen1977"&gt;{{cite book | ref = harv | last = Krashen | first = Stephen | chapter = Some issues relating to the monitor model | pages = 144–158 | editor1-last = Brown | editor1-first = H | editor2-last = Yorio | editor2-first = Carlos | editor3-last = Crymes | editor3-first = Ruth | title = Teaching and learning English as a Second Language: Trends in Research and Practice: On TESOL '77: Selected Papers from the Eleventh Annual Convention of Teachers of English to Speakers of Other Languages, Miami, Florida, April 26 – May 1, 1977 | publisher = Teachers of English to Speakers of Other Languages | location = Washington, DC | year = 1977 | oclc = 4037133}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Byram2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Byram|first=Michael|title=Routledge Encyclopedia of Language Teaching and Learning|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PirCWxMpAHkC&amp;pg=PA413|accessdate=14 September 2012|year=2001|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-12085-2|pages=413–415}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hypotheses put primary importance on the '''comprehensible input''' (CI) that language learners are exposed to. Understanding spoken and written language input is seen as the only mechanism that results in the increase of underlying [[linguistic competence]], and language output is not seen as having any effect on learners' ability. Furthermore, Krashen claimed that linguistic competence is only advanced when language is subconsciously ''acquired'', and that conscious ''learning'' cannot be used as a source of spontaneous language production. Finally, learning is seen to be heavily dependent on the mood of the learner, with learning being impaired if the learner is under stress or does not want to learn the language.

Krashen's hypotheses have been influential in [[language education]], particularly in the [[United States]], but have received criticism from some academics. Two of the main criticisms state that the hypotheses are untestable, and that they assume a degree of separation between ''acquisition'' and ''learning'' that has not been proven to exist.

== Outline ==

The five hypotheses that Krashen proposed are as follows:

* The ''input hypothesis''. This states that learners progress in their knowledge of the language when they comprehend language input that is slightly more advanced than their current level. Krashen called this level of input "i+1", where "i" is the learner's interlanguage and "+1" is the next stage of language acquisition.
* The ''acquisition–learning hypothesis'' claims that there is a strict separation between ''acquisition'' and ''learning''; Krashen saw acquisition as a purely subconscious process and learning as a conscious process, and claimed that improvement in language ability was only dependent upon acquisition and never on learning.
* The ''monitor hypothesis'' states that consciously learned language can only be used to ''monitor'' language output; it can never be the source of spontaneous speech.
* The ''natural order hypothesis'' states that language is acquired in a particular order, and that this order does not change between learners, and is not affected by explicit instruction.
* The ''affective filter hypothesis''. This states that learners' ability to acquire language is constrained if they are experiencing negative emotions such as fear or embarrassment. At such times the affective filter is said to be "up".

If ''i'' represents previously acquired linguistic competence and extra-linguistic knowledge, the hypothesis claims that we move from ''i'' to ''i+1'' by understanding input that contains ''i+1''. Extra-linguistic knowledge includes our knowledge of the world and of the situation, that is, the [[Context (language use)|context]]. The ''+1'' represents new knowledge or language structures that we should be ready to acquire.&lt;ref name="Krashen2003"&gt;Krashen, S. (2003). ''Explorations in Language Acquisition and Use''. Portsmouth: Heinemann.&lt;/ref&gt;

The comprehensible input hypothesis can be restated in terms of the [[Stephen Krashen|natural order hypothesis]]. For example, if we acquire the [[rules of language]] in a linear order (1, 2, 3...), then ''i'' represents the last rule or language form learned, and ''i+1'' is the next structure that should be learned.&lt;ref&gt;Seek information on the [[acquisition-learning hypothesis]] to learn more about the differentiations between learning and acquisition&lt;/ref&gt; It must be stressed, however, that just any input is not sufficient; the input received must be comprehensible.&lt;ref name="Krashen2003" /&gt; According to Krashen, there are three corollaries to his theory.

=== Corollaries of the input hypothesis ===
# ''Talking (output) is not practicing''.&lt;br /&gt;Krashen stresses yet again that speaking in the [[Second language|target language]] does not result in language acquisition. Although speaking can indirectly assist in language acquisition, the ability to speak is not the ''cause'' of language learning or acquisition. Instead, [[comprehensible output]] is the ''effect'' of language acquisition.&lt;ref name="Krashen2003" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See [[comprehensible output]] for more information on output theories and hypotheses&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''When enough comprehensible input is provided, ''i+1'' is present''.&lt;br /&gt;If language models and teachers provide enough comprehensible input, then the structures that acquirers are ready to learn will be present in that input. According to Krashen, this is a better method of developing grammatical accuracy than direct grammar teaching.&lt;ref name="Krashen2003" /&gt;
# ''The teaching order is not based on the natural order''.&lt;br /&gt;Instead, students will acquire the language in a natural order by receiving comprehensible input.&lt;ref name="Krashen2003" /&gt;

== Acquisition-learning hypothesis ==

In modern [[linguistics]], there are many theories as to how humans are able to develop [[language]] ability. According to [[Stephen Krashen]]'s '''acquisition-learning hypothesis''', there are two independent ways in which we develop our linguistic skills: acquisition and learning.&lt;ref name="Krashen2003" /&gt; This theory is at the core of modern language acquisition theory, and is perhaps the most fundamental of Krashen's theories.

Acquisition of language is a natural, [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuitive]], and [[subconscious]] process of which individuals need not be aware. One is unaware of the process as it is happening and, when the new knowledge is acquired, the acquirer generally does not realize that he or she possesses any new knowledge. According to Krashen, both adults and children can subconsciously acquire language, and either [[written]] or [[speech|oral]] language can be acquired.&lt;ref name="Krashen2003" /&gt; This process is similar to the process that children undergo when learning their native language. Acquisition requires ''meaningful'' interaction in the target language, during which the acquirer is focused on meaning rather than form.&lt;ref name="Schutz2007"&gt;Schutz, R. (2007). "Stephen Krashen's Theory of Second Language Acquisition." ''English Made in Brazil''. Available from [http://www.sk.com.br/sk-krash.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Learning a language, on the other hand, is a conscious process, much like what one experiences in [[school]]. New knowledge or language forms are represented consciously in the learner's mind, frequently in the form of language "rules" and "[[grammar]]", and the process often involves error correction.&lt;ref name="Krashen2003" /&gt; [[Language learning]] involves formal instruction and, according to Krashen, is less effective than acquisition.&lt;ref name="Schutz2007" /&gt; Learning in this sense is conception or conceptualisation: instead of learning a language itself, students learn an abstract, conceptual ''[[Conceptual model|model]]'' of a language, a "theory" about a language (a grammar).

== Monitor hypothesis ==

The monitor hypothesis asserts that a learner's learned system acts as a monitor to what they are producing. In other words, while only the acquired system is able to produce spontaneous speech, the learned system is used to check what is being spoken.

Before the learner produces an utterance, he or she internally scans it for errors, and uses the learned system to make corrections. Self-correction occurs when the learner uses the Monitor to correct a sentence after it is uttered. According to the hypothesis, such self-monitoring and self-correction are the only functions of conscious language learning.&lt;ref name="Krashen2003" /&gt;&lt;!-- ''Explorations in Language Acquisition and Use''--&gt;

The Monitor model then predicts faster initial progress by adults than children, as adults use this ‘monitor’ when producing L2 (target language) utterances before having acquired the ability for natural performance, and adult learners will input more into conversations earlier than children.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

=== Three conditions for use of the monitor ===
According to Krashen, for the Monitor to be successfully used, three conditions must be met:
# ''The acquirer/learner must know the rule''&lt;br /&gt;This is a very difficult condition to meet because it means that the speaker must have had explicit instruction on the language form that he or she is trying to produce.&lt;ref name="Krashen2003" /&gt;
# ''The acquirer must be focused on correctness''&lt;br /&gt;He or she must be thinking about form, and it is difficult to focus on meaning and form at the same time.&lt;ref name="Krashen2003" /&gt;
# ''The acquirer/learner must have time to use the monitor''&lt;br /&gt;Using the monitor requires the speaker to slow down and focus on form.&lt;ref name="Krashen2003" /&gt;

=== Difficulties using the monitor ===
There are many difficulties with the use of the monitor, making the monitor rather weak as a language tool.
# ''Knowing the rule'': this is a difficult condition to meet, because even the best students do not learn every rule that is taught, cannot remember every rule they have learned, and can't always correctly apply the rules they do remember. Furthermore, not every rule of a language is always included in a text or taught by the teacher.&lt;ref name="Krashen2003" /&gt;
# ''Having time to use the monitor'': there is a price that is paid for the use of the monitor- the speaker is then focused on form rather than meaning, resulting in the production and exchange of less information, thus slowing the flow of conversation. Some speakers over-monitor to the point that the conversation is painfully slow and sometimes difficult to listen to.&lt;ref name="Krashen2003" /&gt;
# ''The rules of language make up only a small portion of our language competence'': Acquisition does not provide 100% language competence. There is often a small portion of grammar, punctuation, and spelling that even the most proficient native speakers may not acquire.&lt;!-- bad example unless used by Krashen because most linguists would argue that this distinction is an artificial preservation of an older and outdated usage specifically because the distinction is no longer made by most people: (for example- the lie/lay distinction in English)--&gt; While it is important to learn these aspects of language, since writing is the only form that requires 100% competence, these aspects of language make up only a small portion of our language competence.&lt;ref name="Krashen2003" /&gt;

Due to these difficulties, Krashen recommends using the monitor at times when it does not interfere with communication, such as while writing.&lt;ref name="Krashen2003" /&gt;

== Natural order hypothesis ==
{{See also|Order of acquisition}}
The natural order hypothesis states that all learners acquire a language in roughly the same order. This order is not dependent on the ease with which a particular language feature can be taught; some features, such as third-person "-s" ("he runs") are easy to teach in a classroom setting, but are not typically acquired until the later stages of language acquisition. This hypothesis was based on the [[morpheme studies]] by Dulay and Burt, which found that certain morphemes were predictably learned before others during the course of second-language acquisition.

== Affective filter hypothesis ==
The '''affective filter''' is an impediment to [[learning]] or acquisition caused by negative [[emotion]]al ("[[affective]]") responses to one's environment. It is a [[hypothesis]] of [[second-language acquisition]] theory, and a field of interest in [[educational psychology]].

According to the affective filter hypothesis, certain emotions, such as anxiety, self-doubt, and mere boredom interfere with the process of acquiring a second language. They function as a filter between the speaker and the listener that reduces the amount of language input the listener is able to understand. These negative emotions prevent efficient processing of the language input.&lt;ref name="Krashen2003" /&gt; The hypothesis further states that the blockage can be reduced by sparking interest, providing low-anxiety environments, and bolstering the learner's self-esteem.

According to Krashen (1982),&lt;ref&gt;Krashen, S. (1982). ''Principles and practice in second language acquisition''. Oxford: Pergamon Press {{cite web |url=http://www.sdkrashen.com/Principles_and_Practice/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716023230/http://www.sdkrashen.com/Principles_and_Practice/index.html |archivedate=2011-07-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; there are two prime issues that prevent the lowering of the affective filter. The first is not allowing for a silent period (expecting the student to speak before they have received an adequate amount of comprehensible input according to their individual needs). The second is correcting their errors too early-on in the process.

== Reception and influence ==
The model has been criticized by some linguists{{who|date=August 2014}} and isn't considered a valid hypothesis for some{{who|date=August 2014}}{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}. It has, however, inspired much research, and many linguists praise its value.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}&lt;!-- apparently reliable: http://homepage.ntlworld.com/vivian.c/SLA/Krashen.htm--&gt;

According to [[Wolfgang Butzkamm]] &amp; John A. W. Caldwell (2009), comprehensible input, defined by Krashen as understanding messages, is indeed the necessary condition for acquisition, but it is not sufficient. Learners will crack the speech code only if they receive input that is comprehended at two levels. They must not only understand what is meant but also how things are quite literally expressed, i.e. how the different meaning components are put together to produce the message. This is the principle of dual comprehension. In many cases both types of understanding can be conflated into one process, in others not. The German phrase "Wie spät ist es?" is perfectly understood as "What time is it?" However learners need to know more: *How late is it? That’s what the Germans say literally, which gives us the anatomy of the phrase, and the logic behind it. Only now is understanding complete, and we come into full possession of the phrase which can become a recipe for many more sentences, such as "Wie alt ist es?" / "How old is it?" etc. According to Butzkamm &amp; Caldwell (2009:64) "dually comprehended language input is the fuel for our language learning capacities".&lt;ref&gt;Butzkamm, Wolfgang, and Caldwell, John A. W. (2009) The bilingual reform. A paradigm shift in foreign language teaching. Tübingen: Narr Verlag&lt;/ref&gt; It is both necessary and sufficient.

The theory underlies Krashen and [[Tracy D. Terrell|Terrell]]'s [[comprehension approach|comprehension-based]] [[language learning]] [[methodology]] known as the [[natural approach]] (1983). The [[Focal Skills]] approach, first developed in 1988, is also based on the theory.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} [[English as a Second Language Podcast]] was also inspired by Krashen's ideas on providing comprehensible input to language acquirers.

The most popular competitors are the [[Skill-building Hypothesis|skill-building hypothesis]] and the [[Comprehensible output|comprehensible output hypothesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Krashen|1989|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The input hypothesis is related to [[instructional scaffolding]].

== Applications in language teaching ==
Krashen designed two levels:
''Beginning level''&lt;ref name="Krashen2003" /&gt;
* Class time is filled with comprehensible oral input
* Teachers must modify their speech so that it is comprehensible
* Demands for speaking (output) are low; students are not forced to speak until ready
* Grammar instruction is only included for students high school age and older

''Intermediate level'''&lt;ref name="Krashen2003" /&gt;
* Sheltered subject-matter teaching that uses modified academic texts to provide comprehensible input. (Note that sheltered subject-matter teaching is not for beginners or native speakers of the target language.)
* In sheltered instruction classes, the focus is on the meaning, and not the form.

As a practical matter, ''comprehensive input'' works with the following teaching techniques:
# The teacher should slow down and speak clearly and slowly, using short sentences and clauses.
# The teacher needs to prepare and use graphical or visual aids.
# Use textbooks or supporting materials that are not overly cluttered.
# Appropriate with the grade (higher than 2nd grade), develop a [[study guide]].
# Use multi-modal teaching techniques.
# Have the students read aloud, and other students paraphrase what they said.
# Consider using a small set of content vocabulary repeatedly.&lt;ref name="EAS SIOP"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lookaside.fbsbx.com/file/EAS-Secrets-Study-Guide.pdf?token=AWygKTJzdwm41wLZ1ma_DbYjH5K3QS-y7ZiWYUf5gyJa-q5YwHWPgJeVV5Tga4VGygZLj1gUc-j6atXX_SF78s35vJKYwGksAH3AAFquHE3qp7F1XzAwdyKLqp_DnigWlFVWjR_BMyzYrEnyy23uNl-w|title=EAS Secrets Study Guide|work=Metromix|pages=22–25|year=2017|accessdate=May 1, 2017}} (work is copyrighted and cannot be copied)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Postman SIOP"&gt;{{cite book|title=Barron's NYSTCE: EAS, ALST, Multi-Subject CST, Overview of the edTPA|edition=4th|last=Postman|first=Robert|page=39|isbn=978-1-4380-0618-5|place=[[Hauppauge, New York]]|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Society for Contemporary Music''' ('''ISCM''') is a music organization that promotes [[contemporary classical music]].

The organization was established in [[Salzburg]] in 1922 as '''Internationale Gesellschaft für Neue Musik''' (IGNM) following the
Internationale Kammermusikaufführungen Salzburg, a festival of modern chamber music held as part of the Salzburg Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.nypl.org/mus/18409|title=archives.nypl.org -- League of Composers/ISCM records|website=Archives.nypl.org|accessdate=24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, aside from a hiatus between 1940 and 1945 due to [[World War II]], the ISCM's core activity has been an annual festival of contemporary classical music held every year at a different location, the first of which took place in 1923 in Salzburg, which has come to be known as the [[ISCM World Music Days]] (sometimes World New Music Days, abbreviated either WMD or WNMD depending on which name is used). There have been a total of 86 of these thus far, the most recent of which took place in [[Tongyeong]], [[South Korea]] in April 2016.  The next WMD is scheduled to take place in [[Vancouver]], [[Canada]] in November 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musiconmain.ca/vancouver-to-host-the-host-the-2017-iscm/|title=ISCM World New Music Days 2017 coming to Vancouver|website=Musiconmain.ca|accessdate=24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each year, during the World Music Days. ISCM members also convene in a General Assembly. Membership in the ISCM is organized through national sections that promote contemporary music in each country. These sections are usually organizations independent from the ISCM that send delegates to the ISCM General Assembly. Each member of the national section is also a member of ISCM and may send in 6 works that are evaluated for performance at the World Music Days. National organizations that promote contemporary music, but have not been designated as the nation section of ISCM, are sometimes given an associate membership status. This status also applies to the members of these organizations. Some individual music professionals receive the "honorary membership" status. The ISCM is governed by an Executive Committee consisting of seven people; two (Secretary General and Treasurer) are appointed positions and the remaining five (President, Vice President, and three regular members) are chosen from and by the delegates in an election during the General Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iscm.org/about/excomm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-04-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107044251/http://www.iscm.org/about/excomm |archivedate=2016-01-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Since 1991, the ISCM has also published an annual ''World New Music Magazine'', a print publication that is distributed to its members for further dissemination. A total of 24 issues have been produced thus far, and since 2006, each magazine has also been made available as a digital downloadable PDF from the ISCM's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iscm.org/catalogue/wnmm|title=World New Music Magazine|first=|last=ISCM|date=24 May 2018|website=Iscm.org|accessdate=24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ISCM is a member of the [[International Music Council]].

'''John Trobaugh''' (born 1968) in [[Lansing, Michigan|Lansing]], [[Michigan]] is an [[United States|American]] artist specializing in [[photography]] and based in [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], [[Alabama]]. Trobaugh received his BFA in 1996 with honors from [[University of Alabama at Birmingham]] and went on to study photography at the [[School of Visual Arts]]. In 2003 he received his Masters in Fine Art from the [[University of Alabama]] in [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Tuscaloosa]], [[Alabama]].

His photography has been published in [[Art Papers]], selected as the cover artist. He has also been published in [[The Chronicle of Higher Education]], [http://nyartsmagazine.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=6663&amp;Itemid=199 NY Arts Magazine], [[The Washington Post]] and [[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]] as well as [[The Birmingham News]] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20070928090420/http://worldofwonder.net/archives/2005/Oct/26/why_we_havent_seen_barbie_with_ken_lately.wow World of Wonder], among many others.

While teaching at Sheldon State in Tuscaloosa Alabama, Trobaugh's work was censored before a planned exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wbhm.org/News/Public_Arts_Funding.html wbhm.org]&lt;/ref&gt; The case has yet to be resolved but gained national attention due to censorship issues. He was  forbidden to discuss this censorship as part of his art appreciation class. Trobaugh later resigned his post.

Richard Meyer, Chair of the Art Department at The [[University of Southern California]] in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[California]], spoke about Trobaugh's work at various national conferences about censorship. Trobaugh was also presented in The [[Smithsonian]] National Gallery and is the author of several articles including [[Art Papers]].

==Work==
In 2005, Space One Eleven exhibited Trobaugh's work alongside [[Karen Graffeo]] for''"In This Place"''. M. K. Matalon organized this exhibition to investigate place and location in relationship to contemporary Southern issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spaceoneeleven.org/pr/Graffeo_and_Trobaugh_SOE_Press_Release.html "''Graffeo/Trobaugh''" ''"In This Place''"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929034351/http://www.spaceoneeleven.org/pr/Graffeo_and_Trobaugh_SOE_Press_Release.html |date=2007-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trobaugh's work was selected to be part of ''Patterns of Nature'' in Denver, Colorado.&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.colorado.edu/~farsi/conference/slide_trobaugh.html ''Patterns of Nature''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612172359/http://math.colorado.edu/~farsi/conference/slide_trobaugh.html |date=2010-06-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trobaugh was included in "Politics, Politics: Nine Artists Explore the Political Landscape" curated by [[Anne Arrasmith]] and Peter Prinz of Space One Eleven. This exhibition was funded by the [[Andy Warhol]] Foundation for the Visual Arts and included [[Pinky Bass]], [[Clayton Colvin]], Peggy Dobbins, Randy Gachet, binx Newton, Arthur Price, Paul Ware, and Stan Woodard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spaceoneeleven.org/press_releases.html Space One Eleven Press Release] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061020194416/http://www.spaceoneeleven.org/press_releases.html |date=2006-10-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trobaugh was a presenter for ''Photography in the Digital Age'' by The Society For Photographic Education South Central Regional Conference, 2003. This meeting took place at the [[University of Alabama at Birmingham]] and [[Birmingham Museum of Art]] in [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], [[Alabama]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uab.edu/scrcphoto/SPE_PDF.pdf Society For Photographic Education South Central Regional Conference] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060508220308/http://www.uab.edu/scrcphoto/SPE_PDF.pdf |date=2006-05-08 }}, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books==
* In ''Potentially Harmful: The Art of American Censorship'', Trobaugh's work was shown alongside Dread Scott, [[Robert Mapplethorpe]], [[Sue Coe]], [[Lynda Benglis]], [[Andres Serrano]], [[Karen Finley]], Alma Lopez, John Jota Leaos, [[Benita Carr]], Anita Steckel, [[Renee Cox]], Gayla Lemke, Marilyn Zimmerman, John Sims, The Critical Art Ensemble, [[Eric Fischl]], Tom Forsythe, Nancy Worthington, David Avalos, Scott Kessler, Louis Hock and Elizabeth Sisco. This project was funded by a major grant from The [[Andy Warhol]] Foundation for the Visual Arts with considerable local support from the Atlanta Bureau of Cultural Affairs, and the [[Georgia State University]] College of Arts and Sciences Visiting Artists and Scholars Fund, the College of Law, the Ethics Center, [[Women's Studies]], [[African American Studies]], the Department of Communications and additional private donors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gsu.edu/~wwwart/gallery/exhibition_current.html ''Potentially Harmful: The Art of American Censorship''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070213033118/http://www2.gsu.edu/~wwwart/gallery/exhibition_current.html |date=2007-02-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quotes==
* Photographs by John Trobaugh were removed from display for “inappropriate” content at an exhibition at Shelton State Community College in [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Tuscaloosa]], [[Alabama]]. The photographs portray [[Ken Carson|Ken]] and [[G.I. Joe]] posed in romantic (though not sexually explicit) couplings. this decision involved the [[National Coalition Against Censorship]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncac.org National Coalition Against Censorship]&lt;/ref&gt; -Queer Caucus for Art
* The censoring of my work from this faculty exhibition served to illustrate this point because administrators “loved” the images, yet the president of the college removed the whole series. People ask why would I want to show my work in the South anyway? I was raised here, the fantasy world was created here, and the images are made or based in the South. Why shouldn’t the South see what the South created? -John Trobaugh &lt;ref&gt;[http://nyartsmagazine.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=6663&amp;Itemid=199 NYArts Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;
* His most recent series, called ''Double Duty'', are photographs using the 12" dolls to make social commentary," the text says. "Trobaugh's photographs uncannily portray human likeness and gesture." True. In fact, for a second, we thought someone had found and posted photos we took in the '70s. Just for a second. -Stephen Saban of [https://web.archive.org/web/20070928090420/http://worldofwonder.net/archives/2005/Oct/26/why_we_havent_seen_barbie_with_ken_lately.wow The WOW Report]
* Actually I like Trobaugh's photos more than [[David Leventhal]]. Nothing is more subjective than art and nothing is more common in art than homoeroticism. -Stephen Smith, [http://www.birminghamfreepress.com/v4.html Birmingham Free Press], 2004

==History==
Through the 1960s, under its founding editor Balkrishna Rao and later under Rajendra Awasthi, Kadambini and a few other leading publications of the time, started publishing short stories (''laghu katha'') by leading writers like [[Agyeya]], [[Mahadevi Verma]], [[Kunwar Narayan]] and Ramanada Doshi. This in time had an important impact on the growth of short story movement (''[[Nayi Kahani]]'') in [[Hindi literature]].&lt;ref name="Sarma2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ira Valeria Sarma|title=The Laghukatha: A Historical and Literary Analysis of a Modern Hindi Prose Genre|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AVMgAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA37|year= 2003|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-089652-7|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Siṃha1974"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kripa Shankar Sinha|title=Modern Hindi short story|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cDAmAQAAMAAJ|year=1974|page=238|publisher=National Pub.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, it became a prominent magazine of [[North India]],&lt;ref name="Malik1979"&gt;{{cite book|author=Yogendra K.

[[File:Egypte – Haywal. (Danseur excentrique habillé en danseuse).jpg|thumb|200px|Postcard depicting a khawal (pre–1907).]]
The '''''khawal''''' (plural ''khawalat'') ar: خول  was  traditional 1911 native [[Egypt]]ian male dancer [[cross-dressing|cross-dressed]] in feminine attire and was popular up until the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.

==Name==
In the oldest Arabic dictionary ''[[Kitab al-'Ayn]]'' the definition of ''khawal'' was a "servant" or "slave". ''Khawalat'' were acquired by unknown means, perhaps purchased as the spoils of war. However, they were different from classic slaves because the term did not necessarily imply ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mohammed Ennaji|date=2013|title=Slavery, the State, and Islam|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=182|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In response to the prohibition of women dancing in public, cross-dressing males took their place. The khawal were [[effeminate]] male transvestite dancers in Egypt that emulated the female [[ghawazi]] by dancing with [[castanets|castanet]] self accompaniment, their hands painted with [[henna]], long hair dressed in braids, plucking facial hair, wearing make-up, and adopting the manners of women. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;As they impersonate women, their dances are exactly of the same description as those of the Ghawazee [female dancers] ... Their general appearance ... is more feminine than masculine: they suffer the hair of the head to grow long, and generally braid it, in the manner of women ... they imitate the women also in applying [[Kohl (cosmetics)|kohl]] and henna to their eyes and hands like women. In the streets, when not engaged in dancing, they often veil their faces; not from shame, but merely to affect the manners of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph A. Boone|date=2014|title=The Homoerotics of Orientalism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N3QRAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA188|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=9780231521826|page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

They would distinguish themselves from real females by wearing a costume that was part male and part female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Judith Lynne Hanna|date=1988|title=Dance, Sex, and Gender: Signs of Identity, Dominance, Defiance, and Desire|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0226315517|publisher=University of Chicago Press|pages=57–58|isbn=9780226315515}}&lt;/ref&gt; The khawal performed at various functions such as weddings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward William Lane|date=1842|title=An Account of the Manners and Customs of the Modern Egyptians|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HSlDAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA260|volume=1|publisher=London: Charles Knight &amp; Co.|page=260}}&lt;/ref&gt; births, [[circumcision]]s, and festivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=edited by Mona L.

'''Koonalda Cave''' is  a [[cave]] in the Australian state of [[South Australia]], on the [[Nullarbor Plain]] in the locality of [[Nullarbor, South Australia|Nullarbor]].  It is notable as an [[archeological site]].&lt;ref name="Koonalda Cave"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/321989/Koonalda-Cave "Koonalda Cave"], ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://austhrutime.com/koonalda_cave.htm "Koonalda Cave"] ''Australia Thru Time''. Retrieved 2014-3-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

I.D. Lewis described the cave in 1976 as:&lt;ref name="LMV"/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Large doline 60m in diam. and 25m deep; talus slope to two main large passages connected by a high window; total length of cave 1200m; three lakes at -80m; narrow airspace beyond third lake leads to 45m diam. dome and lake; another 30m sump leads off this...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thousands of square metres in the cave are covered in parallel finger-marked geometric lines and patterns, [[Indigenous Australian]] artwork which has been dated as 20,000 years old,&lt;ref name="Koonalda Cave"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Koonalda"&gt;[http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/archaeology/sites/pacific/koonalda.html "Koonalda"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609030320/http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/archaeology/sites/pacific/koonalda.html |date=9 June 2008 }}, [[Minnesota State University, Mankato|Minnesota State University]]&lt;/ref&gt; making it older than any known [[prehistoric art]] in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey Blainey|BLAINEY, Geoffrey]], ''Triumph of the Nomads: A History of Aboriginal Australia'', 1976, {{ISBN|0-87951-084-6}}, p.84&lt;/ref&gt; It is located about {{convert|99|km}} west of the [[Nullarbor, South Australia| Nullarbor roadhouse]]&lt;ref name="LMV"/&gt; and about {{convert|60|mi|km|0|order=flip}} north east from [[Eucla, Western Australia|Eucla]]&lt;ref name=R1/&gt; within the [[Nullarbor Wilderness Protection Area]].&lt;ref name=PA2014&gt;{{cite web|title=Protected Areas of South Australia September (Map) 2014 Edition|url=http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/files/bf6977cb-f1f9-4700-9b5f-a35500fda94f/protected-areas-of-south-australia-map.pdf|publisher=Department of Environment, Water and Natural Resources|accessdate=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cave was abandoned 19,000 years ago, and rediscovered by [[archeology|archeologists]] in 1956.&lt;ref name="Koonalda"/&gt;

The cave was explored by an expedition led by Captain J. M. Thompson in 1935. The team entered the cave by a ladder and found themselves in a chamber some {{convert|800|ft|m|0|order=flip}} in circumference and walked down tunnels over {{convert|1200|ft|m|0|order=flip}} in length.&lt;ref name=R1&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17221733 |title=Caves and Lakes. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=20 November 1935 |accessdate=6 June 2014 |page=12 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, the cave was excavated by Alexander Gallus, who found that Aboriginal peoples had mined [[flint]] there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samuseum.sa.gov.au/research/humanities/archaeology/secrets-of-koonalda-caves|title=Secrets of Koonalda Caves|year=2014|accessdate=6 June 2014|publisher=[[South Australian Museum]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21510">There is a body of films that feature miniature people. The concept of a human shrinking in size has existed since the beginning of cinema, with early films using camera techniques to change perceptions of human sizes. The earliest film to have a shrunken person was a 1901 short ''[[The Dwarf and the Giant]]'' by [[Georges Méliès]] in which a character was split into two, with one growing in size and the other shrinking. Before digital effects became commonplace, composite screens were used to create the illusion of miniature people. The element appeared in numerous [[B movie]]s.&lt;ref name="zarracina" /&gt; James Luxford, writing for the British Film Institute, said, "Each era has used the scenario for very different purposes, in ways that often reflect the anxieties of the time." He added, "The reason shrinking characters have been so popular in films is that they enable the viewer to see the world in a different way."&lt;ref name="luxford" /&gt;

Don Kaye, writing for ''Den of Geek!'', said, "The 'shrinking person' genre got its start in the early ‘30s, with nearly each decade since then offering up its own variation on the theme. Some have been frightening, some humorous and others just plain ludicrous -- but all tap into that deep-seated fear of being diminished in a world that looms too large around us."&lt;ref name="kaye" /&gt; In the 1960s, ''[[Fantastic Voyage]]'' featured miniature people, but no major film revisited the concept until the 1980s. ''[[Grantland]]''{{'}}s Claire L. Evans said during this decade, "The conceit, being inherently silly, was reframed as a vehicle for broad physical comedies and family movies." She said, "These kinds of films reframe domestic life — a bowl of cereal, the family cat — as a cinematic landscape of awe and terror as exotic as anything on an alien world."&lt;ref name="evans" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3220">'''Makonde art''' is the [[art]] of the [[Makonde people]].

Makonde art can be subdivided into different areas. The Makonde traditionally carve household objects, figures and masks. After the 1930s, the Portuguese colonizers and other missionaries arrived at the [[Makonde plateau]]. They immediately showed great interest and fascination for the Makonde wood carvings and began to order different pieces, from religious to political “eminences.” The Makonde sculptors, after noticing such interest, decided to carve the new pieces using pau-preto (ebony wood, Diospyros ebenum) and pau-rosa (Swartzia spp.) instead of the soft and non long-lasting wood they had used before. This first contact with the Western culture can be considered to be the first introduction of the classical European style into the traditional Makonde style.Since the 1950s years the socalled Modern Makonde Art has been developed. An essential step was the turning to abstract figures, mostly spirits, [[Shetani]], that play a special role. This shetani style originated in the early 1950s by master carver [[Samaki Likankoa]], whose patron [[Mohamed Peera]], an art curator in Tanzania played an instrumental and decisive role in influencing the modern makonde art movement. Some Makonde sculptors, the best known of whom is [[George Lugwani]], have embraced fully abstract style of carving without discernible figures. Makonde are also part of the important contemporary artists of Africa today. The most internationally acknowledged such artist was [[George Lilanga]].

The ex libris of ritual Makonde art are the unique Mapiko masks (singular: Lipiko), which have been used in coming-of-age rituals since before contact was made with missionaries, in the 19th century. These masks are painstakingly carved from a single block of light wood (usually 'sumaumeira brava') and may represent spirits ('shetani'), ancestors, or living characters (real or idealized). The dancer wears them so that he sees through the mask's mouth and the mask faces straight when he bends forward. Examples of such masks are provided in the second row of pictures below.

The '''Manila hostage crisis''', officially known as the '''Rizal Park hostage-taking incident''',&lt;ref name="IIRC" /&gt; took place when a disgruntled former [[Philippine National Police]] officer named Rolando Mendoza hijacked a tourist bus in [[Rizal Park]], [[Manila]], [[Philippines]] on August 23, 2010. The bus carried 25 people: 20 tourists, a tour guide from [[Hong Kong]], and four local Filipinos. Mendoza claimed that he had been unfairly dismissed from his job, and demanded a fair hearing to defend himself.&lt;ref name=robles/&gt;&lt;ref name=BWTimeline&gt;Gregorio, Ann Rozainne R. (August 24, 2010).[http://www.bworldonline.com/main/content.php?id=16456 Timeline: Manila hostage crisis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923221512/http://www.bworldonline.com/main/content.php?id=16456 |date=September 23, 2015 }}. ''[[BusinessWorld]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Negotiations (which were broadcast live on television and the internet) broke down dramatically about ten hours into the stand-off, when the police arrested Mendoza's brother and thus incited Mendoza to open fire.&lt;ref name="driver" /&gt; The bus driver managed to escape, and declared "Everyone is dead" before he was whisked away by policemen.&lt;ref name="DriverEscapes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/video/nation/metro-manila/08/23/10/driver-escapes-says-no-one-alive-bus|title=Driver escapes, says 'hostages all dead'|date=August 23, 2010|publisher=ABS-CBN News|language=tl}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a 90-minute gun battle, Mendoza and eight of the hostages were killed and several others injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticle09.asp?xfile=data/international/2010/August/international_August1258.xml&amp;section=international|title=9 killed in Manila hostage drama|first=Gina|last=Abuyuan|publisher=Khaleej Times|date=August 23, 2010|accessdate=April 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Philippine and Hong Kong governments conducted separate investigations into the incident. Both inquiries concluded that the Philippine officials' poor handling of the situation caused the eight hostages' deaths.&lt;ref name="ReportDelivery" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc20110323"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-12827835|publisher=BBC|title=Hong Kong inquest criticises Philippines on bus hijack|date=March 23, 2011|accessdate=April 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The assault mounted by the [[Manila Police District]] (MPD), and the resulting shoot-out, have been widely criticized by [[pundit (expert)|pundits]] as "bungled" and "incompetent",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/philippines/7961669/Hostage-rescue-team-bungled-Philippines-coach-rescue.html|title=Hostage rescue team 'bungled Philippines coach rescue'|publisher=The Daily Telegraph|date=August 24, 2010|accessdate=April 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Government of Hong Kong|Hong Kong Government]] has issued a "black" [[travel alert]] for the Philippines as a result of the affair.&lt;ref name="bbc310" /&gt;

On April 12, 2018, Philippine president [[Rodrigo Duterte]] publicly apologized for the incident on behalf of his country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://politics.com.ph/after-8-years-of-silence-duterte-says-sorry-to-china-hk-over-2010-luneta-hostage-crisis/|title=After 8 years of silence: Duterte says sorry to China, HK over 2010 Luneta hostage crisis|last=|first=|date=Apr 12, 2018|work=Politiko|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perpetrator==
Rolando Mendoza graduated from the [[Philippine College of Criminology]] with a degree in criminology, joined the Philippine National Police force as a patrolman, and rose to become senior inspector.&lt;ref name="who_is_this"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/metro/view/20100823-288385/Who-is-this-hostage-taking-cop |title=Who is this hostage-taking cop? |first=Alcuin |last=Papa |work=Philippine Daily Inquirer |date=August 23, 2010 |accessdate=August 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was decorated 17 times for bravery and honor, and was described by colleagues as hard-working and kind.&lt;ref name=robles&gt;Robles, Alan (August 24, 2010). "Disgrace of a model policeman thrown out of force for corruption", ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1986, Mendoza led a group of policemen that accosted a van carrying 13 crates full of money, which former Philippine president and dictator [[Ferdinand Marcos]] was apparently trying to smuggle out of the country. Mendoza and his team turned the shipment over to authorities,&lt;ref name=robles/&gt; for which he was declared one of the Ten Outstanding Policemen of the Philippines by the [[Junior Chamber International|Jaycees International]] that year.&lt;ref name="who_is_this" /&gt;

On April 9, 2008, hotel chef Christian Kalaw alleged that he was accosted by Mendoza and several other officers over a parking violation.  Kalaw alleged that the police planted sachets of [[methamphetamine]] in his car, forced him to take the drug, and accused him of being a drug addict. The officers also allegedly demanded Kalaw access his bank ATM and hand over money. Kalaw said the policemen released him after a friend raised 20,000 pesos on his behalf. The [[Philippine Ombudsman|Office of the Ombudsman]] found Mendoza and four others guilty of misconduct, and ordered Mendoza's dismissal from the service and the voiding of all his benefits.&lt;ref name=robles/&gt; In late April 2008, he was relieved as Chief of the Mobile Patrol Unit. In August 2008, the Eighth Division of the Manila Prosecutors' Office vacated the case after Kalaw failed to attend the dismissal proceedings, and in October the PNP Internal Affairs Service recommended the case be dropped. Mendoza's brother, Gregorio, later stated that all his brother wanted was a fair hearing by the Ombudsman, who "never even gave him a chance to defend himself; they [just] immediately dismissed him."&lt;ref name=robles/&gt;

There were later reports that Mendoza was also charged with gang rape in a 1996 incident, but the case was dismissed when the complainants did not show up at court.&lt;ref name=rape&gt;[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/08/30/10/hostage-taker-also-faced-gang-rape-charges Hostage-taker also faced gang rape charges].

On the morning of August 23, 2010, Mendoza attempted to board a [[Hong Thai Travel Services]] tour bus as it was taking on riders. Mendoza requested a free ride, and when he was declined by the driver, Mendoza brandished a weapon, handcuffed the driver to the steering wheel and hijacked the bus.&lt;ref name="nataliewong"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=11&amp;art_id=102088&amp;sid=29349481&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20100824&amp;fc=1|author=Natalie Wong|work=The Standard|location=Hong Kong|title=Tour leader calmly sent SOS to office|date=August 24, 2010|accessdate=August 24, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68XEw2Uty?url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=11&amp;art_id=102088&amp;sid=29349481&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20100824&amp;fc=1|archivedate=June 19, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are conflicting reports as to whether Mendoza boarded in front of [[Quirino Grandstand]] at [[Rizal Park]], or at [[Fort Santiago]]; a number of witnesses saw a man answering Mendoza's description boarding the bus at the latter location.&lt;ref name=driver/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ramos|first1=Marlon|date=August 27, 2010|title=NBI probing who brought hostage-taker to Fort Santiago|publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Masa Tse Ting-chunn, the bus' tour guide, immediately called his agency in Hong Kong shortly after 10:30&amp;nbsp;am. During the two-minute conversation, Tse calmly informed the customer services manager that his group was being held hostage.&lt;ref name="nataliewong"/&gt; Initial media reports were confusing and contradictory; the suspect was alternatively identified as "Ronaldo," "Rolando" and "Reynaldo"; and the hostages aboard were initially reported to be South Koreans&lt;ref name=media&gt;Jemandre, Tessa.

* The side-issue of Gregorio Mendoza had been allowed to preoccupy Lim, Rodolfo Magtibay and Chief negotiator Orlando Yebra at a critical moment, setting off a chain of events that led to Mendoza becoming "fatally hostile".
* Lim decided to arrest Gregorio Mendoza.
* Lim and Magtibay were absent from the command post at a crucial time, having a meal, which created a decision-making vacuum.
* "The inefficient, disorganised and stalled assault" took place without "vital information" about the bus. Magtibay rejected an order from the Philippine National Police director for Manila to use the national elite Special Action Force.
* There was no plan for what to do after the assault and the crime scene was not preserved.

The report also recommended administrative or criminal charges for 15 individuals and organisations, including Manila mayor Alfredo Lim, vice-mayor [[Isko Moreno]], Ombudsmen [[Merceditas Gutierrez]] and Emilio Gonzales III, government undersecretary Rico J. Puno, retired Philippine National Police chief director general Jesus Verzosa, National Capital Region Police Office director Leocadio Santiago Jr., Manila Police District chief superintendent Rodolfo Magtibay, MPD hostage negotiator Orlando Yebra, SWAT commander Santiago Pascual, journalists [[Erwin Tulfo]] and Mike Rogas, and three broadcasting networks.&lt;ref name="ReportDelivery" /&gt;

On March 31, 2011, Ombudsman Emilio Gonzales was dismissed by President Aquino for his "inordinate and unjustified delay" in handling Mendoza's appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=672155|title=Noy fires deputy Ombudsman|first=Delon|last=Porcalla|publisher=[[The Philippine Star]]|date=April 2, 2011|accessdate=April 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gonzales was the first individual to receive direct sanction from the Philippine government in connection with the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{zh-hk icon}} {{cite news|url=http://www.rthk.org.hk/rthk/news/expressnews/20110401/news_20110401_55_745399.htm|publisher=[[Radio Television Hong Kong|RTHK]]|date=April 1, 2011|accessdate=April 19, 2011|title=菲律賓首名官員因馬尼拉人質事件被撤職}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appealed the decision, claiming that he was "prejudged guilty before the investigation started".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=675628|title=Deputy Ombudsman seeks TRO vs. Palace's dismissal order|publisher=[[The Philippine Star]]|date=April 12, 2011|accessdate=April 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investigations by the Hong Kong government===
On August 25, 2010, the bodies of the victims were brought back to Hong Kong on a government-chartered flight.&lt;ref name="home"&gt;{{cite news|title=Home|first=Natalie|last=Wong|date=August 26, 2010|url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=30&amp;art_id=102196&amp;sid=29373108&amp;con_type=1|accessdate=June 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Coroner decided that an investigation into their deaths should be carried out, and ordered autopsies on all eight bodies.

They claimed that, rather than conduct another probe, Hong Kong should respect the conclusion of the Philippines' investigation that Mendoza was responsible for the deaths. They claimed that the Hong Kong probe was an encroachment of Philippine sovereignty and independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allheadlinenews.com/briefs/articles/90031975?Manila%20officials%20won%26%23146%3Bt%20attend%20Hong%20Kong%20bus%20hostage%20investigation |title=Manilla Officials won't attend Hong Kong Bus Investigation |work=The Standard |location=Hong Kong |date=January 25, 2011 |accessdate=February 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compensation issue===
In August 2011, two survivors of the crisis, Joe Chan Kwok-chu (陳國柱) and Yik Siu-ling (易小玲), along with Tse Che-kin, brother of Masa Tse, met with Philippines government officials to discuss compensation. Chief executive Donald Tsang refused to intervene, labeling it a civil case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Manila hostage crisis survivors to seek compensation from PHL govt|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/229219/nation/manila-hostage-crisis-survivors-to-seek-compensation-from-phl-govt|accessdate=August 12, 2011|newspaper=GMANews.tv|date=August 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Democratic Party (Hong Kong)|Democratic Party]] lawmaker [[James To]] had assisted Chan and Yik in their plea for legal aid, which was expensive and complicated.&lt;ref name=scmpcomp1&gt;{{cite news|last=Cheung|first=Simpson|title=Call to push Philippines to pay up|newspaper=[[South China Morning Post]]|date=August 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the visit by Manila Mayor Estrada and Cabinet Secretary Almendras to meet with the victims and Hong Kong officials, the latter had stated that a "token of solidarity" will be given to the victims and their families.&lt;ref name="New"&gt;http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/focus/04/24/14/how-philippines-hong-kong-agreed-closure&lt;/ref&gt; It, however, was not officially addressed as compensation money.&lt;ref name="New"/&gt;

The Hong Kong government had wanted to resolve the hostage situation in a peaceful manner. Its [[Security Bureau (Hong Kong)|Security Bureau]] formed a taskforce, and sent officers to Manila to assist the hostage rescue efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=港府今午安排被挾團友回港|date=August 24, 2010 |location=Hong Kong|publisher=[[Sing Tao Daily]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately following the assault, however, the Security Bureau announced a 'black' outbound [[Travel advisory|travel alert]] for the Philippines, (this lasted until August 2014) and Hong Kong residents were advised against traveling there, while residents already in the Philippines were advised to return to Hong Kong as soon as possible.&lt;ref name=bbc310/&gt; Hong Kong officials also announced that visa-free privileges for Philippine diplomats and officials would be revoked after February 5, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.interaksyon.com/article/79725/hong-kong-cancels-visa-free-travel-for-filipinos-over-bus-hostage-fiasco-more-sanctions-eyed&lt;/ref&gt;

The hostage crisis is dramatised in the episode "Hostage Crisis Massacre" of the American television documentary series ''National Geographic Investigates'' produced by Partisan Pictures and [[National Geographic Channel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mahtani |first=Shibani |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/searealtime/2011/11/15/an-interview-with-manila-hostage-crisis-documentary-producer/ |title=An Interview With Manila Hostage Crisis Documentary Producer – Southeast Asia Real Time – WSJ |publisher=Blogs.wsj.com |date=2011-11-15 |accessdate=2012-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the documentary, Micah Fink (the director) clarifies elements of the crisis left unclear by media response. "Mr. Mendoza staged a media event, just like the gunmen in Mumbai," he said in an interview for the Wall Street Journal. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mahtani |first=Shibani |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/searealtime/2011/11/15/an-interview-with-manila-hostage-crisis-documentary-producer/ |title=An Interview With Manila Hostage Crisis Documentary Producer – Southeast Asia Real Time – WSJ |publisher=Blogs.wsj.com |date=2011-11-15 |accessdate=2012-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sensationalism is major theme in this documentary, according to this interview. 

Former FBI Deputy Assistant Director and hostage rescue expert Danny Coulson, who was also a subject in the documentary, reiterates how "Even when there is a system in place to deal with these things, things can still go wrong." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mahtani |first=Shibani |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/searealtime/2011/11/15/an-interview-with-manila-hostage-crisis-documentary-producer/ |title=An Interview With Manila Hostage Crisis Documentary Producer – Southeast Asia Real Time – WSJ |publisher=Blogs.wsj.com |date=2011-11-15 |accessdate=2012-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muturangi was an accomplished  navigator and it was he who started the tradition of The High Priest at Taputapuatea. He was responsible for collecting and recording knowledge of deepsea voyaging across Te Moananui a Kiwa (Pacific Ocean) 

Muturangi supposedly had as a [[familiar spirit|familiar]] or kaitiaki (guardian spirit), a giant octopus known as [[Te Wheke-a-Muturangi]] (the Octopus of Muturangi), the same octopus which others were said to have followed to reach Aotearoa New Zealand.

Another theory for Te Wheke-a-Muturangi states that the name actually refers to the many navigation paths  centered on [[Ra'iātea]] with the tentacles reaching out across the pacific (Tetahiotupa 2009).&lt;ref&gt;E.

'''''Night of the Lepus''''' (also known as '''''Rabbits''''') is a 1972 American [[science fiction]] [[horror film|horror]] [[thriller film]] based on the science fiction novel ''[[The Year of the Angry Rabbit]]'' (1964) by [[Russell Braddon]].  It concerns an infestation of mutated rabbits.

Production was made in 1972 and released theatrically on July 26th in that year. The film was the first science fiction work for producer [[A. C. Lyles]] and for director [[William F. Claxton]], both of whom came from [[Western (genre)|Western film]] backgrounds. Character actors from Westerns the pair had worked on were brought in to star in the ''Night of the Lepus'', including [[Stuart Whitman]], [[Janet Leigh]], [[Rory Calhoun]], and [[DeForest Kelley]].

Shot in Arizona, ''Night of the Lepus'' used [[domestic rabbit]]s filmed against miniature models and actors dressed in rabbit costumes for the attack scenes.

Before its release, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM) renamed the film from its original name of ''Rabbits'' and avoided including rabbits in most promotional materials to try to keep the featured mutant creatures a secret. However, the studio itself broke the secret by issuing [[rabbit's foot]]-themed promotional materials before the release. Widely panned by critics for its premise, bad directing, stilted acting, and laughable special effects, the film's biggest failure was considered to be the inability to make the rabbits seem scary. ''Night of the Lepus'' has gained [[cult following|cult status]] for its poor quality. It was never released on [[VHS]] but was released on [[DVD region code#1|Region 1]] [[DVD]] in October 2005 and on [[Blu-Ray]]  in June of 2018.

==Plot==
Rancher Cole Hillman seeks the help of college president Elgin Clark to combat thousands of [[rabbit]]s that have invaded the area after their natural predators, [[coyote]]s, were killed off. Elgin asks for the assistance of researchers Roy and Gerry Bennett because they respect Cole's wish to avoid using [[cyanide]] to poison the rabbits. Roy proposes using hormones to disrupt the rabbits' breeding cycle and takes some rabbits for experimentation. One is injected with a new serum believed to cause [[birth defect]]s. However, the Bennett's daughter Amanda loves the injected rabbit, so she switches it with one from the [[control group]]. Amanda is then given the injected rabbit as a pet, but it soon escapes.

While inspecting the rabbits' old burrowing areas, Cole and the Bennets find a large, unusual animal track. Meanwhile, Cole's son Jackie  and Amanda go to a [[gold mine]] to visit Jackie's friend Billy but find him missing. Jackie finds more of the animal tracks in Billy's shed, while Amanda goes into the mine and runs into an enormous rabbit with blood on its face. Screaming in terror, she runs from the mine.

Mutilated bodies begin to crop up around town, including Billy, a truck driver, and a family of four. Elgin, the Bennets, Cole, and Cole's two ranch hands, Frank and Jud, go to the mine to try to kill the rabbits with explosives. As Elgin and Cole set charges on top of the mine, Roy and Frank enter the shaft to get pictorial evidence. Outside, a rabbit surfaces and attacks Jud before Gerry can shoot it. Roy and Frank escape the rabbits in the mine and run outside as the explosives are detonated.

The explosives fail to kill the rabbits, and that night they attack Cole's ranch, killing Jud while Cole, Frank, Jackie, and Cole's housekeeper escape into the [[storm shelter]]. The rabbits make their way to the [[general store]], killing housekeeper Mildred and eating everybody else in the small town of Galanos they find before taking refuge in the buildings for the day. In the morning, Gerry and Amanda leave to avoid the coming press but get stuck along a sandy stretch of road. Roy and Elgin update Sheriff Cody on the situation and, after realizing the rabbits have escaped the mine, call in the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]]. As night falls, the rabbits leave Galanos to continue the rampage, making their way to the main town of [[Ajo, Arizona|Ajo]] and eating and killing everybody in their pathway. Cole proposes using a half-mile wide stretch of electrified [[railroad track]] as a fence to contain and kill the rabbits. They recruit a large group of people at a [[Drive-in theater|drive in theater]] to help herd the rabbits with their car lights, with assistance from the machine gun fire of the National Guard.

Thousands of rabbits make their way into the trap, where they are shot and electrocuted. At the film's ending, Cole tells Roy that normal rabbits, as well as coyotes, have returned to the ranch. 

The ending shows Roy and Gerry running on a grassy field where a normal rabbit is shown sitting on the grass just before the ending credits roll.

==Production==
The script for ''Night of the Lepus'' was based on Australian author [[Russell Braddon]]'s [[science fiction]] novel ''[[The Year of the Angry Rabbit]]'' (1964).&lt;ref name="Stories"&gt;{{cite book |title=Stories Rabbits Tell: A Natural and Cultural History of a Misunderstood Creature |first1=Susan E. |last1=Davis |first2=Margo |last2=DeMello |year=2003 |publisher=[[Lantern Books]] |location=New York, New York |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZCS5yfJ7NAEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=1-59056-044-2 |chapter=4.

C. Lyles]], known primarily for producing [[Western (genre)|western]] films, would make ''Night of the Lepus'' his first and only [[science fiction]] production.&lt;ref name="In the Know"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/article.jsp?contentId=181223 |title=Night of the Lepus: TCM Underground - In The Know |first=David |last=Kalat |publisher=[[Turner Classic Movies]] |accessdate=January 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To craft the film, he pulled together people he had worked with on other Westerns. [[Gene R. Kearney]] and [[Don Holliday]] were tasked with converting the novel to a screenplay. In doing so, they removed many aspects of the novel (the plot of which focused on Australia dominating the world with a superweapon inadvertently created through the rabbits), and moved its setting from Australia to Arizona.&lt;ref name="In the Know" /&gt; It was shot at the [[Old Tucson Studios]] in [[Tucson, Arizona]], a site well known for its use in [[Western (genre)|Western]] pictures.&lt;ref name="TCM Behind the Scenes" /&gt; Filming began at the end of January 1972 and concluded in early March.&lt;ref name="TCM"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=807 |title=Night of the Lepus (1972) |publisher=[[Turner Classic Movies]] |accessdate=January 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Turner Classic Movies]]' David Kalat, the film's director William F. Claxton also came from a Western film background. In directing ''Night of the Lepus'', he applied the same techniques used in his other films and declined the use of "standard" horror effects that would have enhanced the atmosphere, such as "canted camera angles, dark shadows, [and] eerie music."&lt;ref name="In the Know" /&gt; Rory Calhoun was cast as rancher Cole Hilman, whose ranch would be the start of the rabbit explosion. Well known for his western work, ''Night of the Lepus'' put him in unfamiliar territory as it was his first science fiction role,&lt;ref name="In the Know" /&gt; however, he found familiarity in the Western film trappings and his role as a rancher.&lt;ref name="TCM Behind the Scenes" /&gt; Janet Leigh, who played Gerry Bennet, took the role because it was being filmed close to her own home, allowing her to travel home on weekends and allowing her family to visit her on the set.&lt;ref name="In the Know" /&gt; Though she felt the script "read well",&lt;ref name="In the Know" /&gt; she declined to allow her two children play minor roles as she did not want them to see or be part of any type of horror film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Callas' New Beau Dean At Juilliard |first=Jack |last=O'Brian |publisher=[[Sarasota Journal]] |date=May 16, 1972 |page=6-B |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZHU0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=GY0EAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=night-of-the-lepus&amp;pg=7417%2C2985205 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She would later state the film lacked an "ideal director" to bring the script to life,&lt;ref name="In the Know" /&gt; and the film failed, in part, because it was impossible to make a "bunny rabbit menacing."&lt;ref name="TCM Behind the Scenes" /&gt; Fellow ''[[The Rifleman]]'' actor [[Paul Fix]] was given the role of the sheriff of the town under siege, while [[DeForest Kelley]], who frequently guest starred in Westerns, was cast as Elgin Clark, the college president who asked researchers to try to stop the rabbits.&lt;ref name="In the Know" /&gt;

The domesticated rabbits used in the film differed greatly in appearance from the wild rabbits that were plaguing the southwest at the time. In ''Night of the Lepus'', this was explained by stating that they were descended from recent rabbit farm escapees.&lt;ref name="TCM Behind the Scenes" /&gt; To depict the rabbit attacks, a combination of techniques were used. For some scenes, the rabbits were filmed in close-up stomping on [[Scale model|miniature]] structures in [[slow motion]].&lt;ref name="AllMovie Review"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmovie.com/work/night-of-the-lepus-103974/review |title=Night of the Lepus Review |first=Jeremy |last=Wheeler |publisher=[[Allmovie]] |accessdate=January 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For attack scenes, they had [[ketchup]] smeared on their faces.&lt;ref name="Stories" /&gt; For other scenes, human actors were shown wearing rabbit [[costume]]s.&lt;ref name="Stories" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TCM Behind the Scenes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AllMovie Review" /&gt;

Originally titled ''Rabbits'', production company MGM renamed the film, using the Latin name for "rabbit" in hopes of keeping the audience from presuming the animals would be non-menacing. To further prevent the audience from thinking of cuddly bunnies in relation to the film, the theatrical posters featured no rabbits, instead displaying only eyes and referencing unnamed "creatures". The trailers showed no critters, and the press releases only mentioned that the film had "mutants." The only clue given to the audience was the required acknowledgment on the poster to Braddon's novel. However, some ''Night of the Lepus'' promoters gave away the secret by sending out souvenirs decorated with rabbit's foot designs.&lt;ref name="TCM Behind the Scenes" /&gt;

''Night of the Lepus'' was released theatrically on July 26, 1972.&lt;ref name="TCM" /&gt; Its [[home video]] release did not come until 33 years later, when [[Warner Home Video]] released an edited version to [[DVD region code#1|Region 1]] [[DVD]] on October 4, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000A0GOGE/ |title=Night of the Lepus (1972) |publisher=[[Amazon.com]] |accessdate=January 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==

===Contemporary===
In a July 1972 issue of ''[[The New York Times]]'' Vincent Canby wrote it was not an "especially memorable movie", that it was typical for the genre of science fiction horror, and that it failed because the rabbits, despite attempts to make them "appear huge and scary, still look like [[Easter bunny|Easter bunnies]]".&lt;ref name="King Kong"&gt;{{cite news |title=King Kong, Where Are You? |first=Vincent |last=Canby |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |date=July 16, 1972 |pages=D1, D5-D6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an October 1972 issue, fellow critic Roger Greenspun panned it for not "even reasonably try[ing]" to make the rabbits scary, its reliance on "tired clichés of monsterdom", "technical laziness" in its special effects, "stupid story", and "dumb direction that leaves the film in limbo" between a horror film and a fairy tale.&lt;ref name="Greenspun NYT"&gt;{{cite news |title=Night of the Lepus Shoes Peter Rabbit's Other Side |first=Peter |last=Greenspun |date=October 5, 1972 |page=56 |publisher=[[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Monthly Film Bulletin]]'', Tom Milne felt ''Night of the Lepus'' had a promising beginning before moving into a "well-worn horror groove", such as the effort to trap Gerry and Amanda alone in a deserted area for a last-minute rescue. Noting that the film had "a certain overall charm and several striking sequences", he felt the film would have been more successful if it "had the courage of its convictions – and its realism". As an example, he points to the scene following the attack on the Calhoun ranch, in which Roy is walking into town, and tourists refuse to stop and pick him up because he has a gun. The tourists then go to the small town where the rabbits have killed everyone and are hiding in the buildings. Rather than becoming the next victims, the family call it a [[ghost town]] and leave.&lt;ref name="MFB"&gt;{{cite journal |title=[[Monthly Film Bulletin]] |first=Tom |last=Milne |date=March 1973 |volume=40 |issue=468/479 |page=55 |issn=0027-0407 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1977 piece ''Dark Dreams 2.0: A Psychological History of the Modern Horror Film'', Charles Derry compared it to the earlier successful works ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'' and ''[[Willard (1971 film)|Willard]]'', particularly the former, noting that both featured a "loveable creature". Though he felt the special effects were poor, he felt ''Night of the Lepus'' successfully tied into ongoing fears of throwing [[ecology]] out of balance, with the rabbits serving as an appropriate [[metaphor]] for human fears about [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]].&lt;ref name="Dark Dream"&gt;{{cite book |title=Dark Dreams 2.0: A Psychological History of the Modern Horror Film |first=Charles |last=Derry |publisher=McFarland |year=2009 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=loUaJC9VBMUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-7864-3397-1 |page=71 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retrospective===
[[Allmovie]]'s Jeremy Wheeler felt the film was "all good, unintentionally campy fun" and "silly to its core". Noting that the special effects were "obvious", he criticized the "truly heinous dialogue" and remarked that Leigh "slums it" by appearing in the film.&lt;ref name="AllMovie Review" /&gt; In ''Stories Rabbits Tell: A Natural and Cultural History of a Misunderstood Creature'', Susan E. Davis and Margo DeMello considered the film an "entertaining romp", praising the "alarmingly realistic" circumstances behind the rabbit mutations, while criticizing the "notoriously badly done" [[special effects]] and the rabbits being made to "roar" during their attacks. Calling it "one of [the] worse career moves" for Kelley and Leigh, they criticized the ending in which all the rabbits were killed, calling them "unwitting victims...of human attempts to control nature".&lt;ref name="Stories" /&gt; In his book ''Videohound's Horror Show: 999 Hair-Raising, Hellish, and Humorous Movies'', critic [[Mike Mayo]] panned the film, calling the script "lame", the scenes of the rabbits "hopping around [[H0 scale]] sets in slow motion" humorous, and the rabbits just not scary. He also criticized the principal performers, stating that the film featured a "group of so-so character actors", except Leigh who he considered a "star", and that all gave "wooden performances".&lt;ref name="HorrorShow"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mayo |first=Mike |title=VideoHound's Horror Show: 999 Hair-Raising, Hellish and Humorous Movies |date=February 1, 1998 |publisher=Visible Ink Press |location=Detroit |isbn=1-57859-047-7 |oclc=39052368 |page=257 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

John J. Puccio of DVDTown.com felt ''Night of the Lepus'' would have been better had it been an intentionally humorous horror spoof, rather than a legitimate attempt at making a horror film with killer rabbits. Stating that it was in the "so-bad-it's-good" category for only two minutes, he found the actors to be "stiff and uninvolved" in delivering their lines, and that it seemed more like an "old television horse opera" than a horror film with more slow-paced filler than action sequences, and the few bits of action ruined by the "corniest possible 'action' music".&lt;ref name="DVD Town"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dvdtown.com/review/night-of-the-lepus/dvd/3182 |title=Night Of The Lepus - DVD review |first=John J. |last=Puccio |publisher=DVDTown.com |date=October 9, 2005 |accessdate=January 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC Film Critic]]'s Christopher Null states that it is famous as "one of the worst films ever made". He heavily criticizes Claxton, feeling that he "just seems wholly incapable of making the movie remotely frightening, or even of making much sense" and that the bad special effects "make the entire film a huge joke".&lt;ref name="AMC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/reviews/Night-of-the-Lepus |title=Night of the Lepus |first=Christopher |last=Null |year=2005 |publisher=[[AMC (TV channel)|AMC's Filmcritic.com]] |accessdate=January 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewing the title for Classic-Horror.com, Julia Merriam gave ''Night of the Lepus'' credit for attempting to be a "socially-conscious eco-horror", but criticized the slow pacing, bad dialog, poor editing with a heavy reliance on [[stock footage]] that did not appear to be from the same film, and senseless character actions such as entering a rabbit-filled cave just to photograph them. She also criticized the film's obvious use of people in rabbit suits, but concluded its biggest flaw was that "fluffy bunnies just aren't scary".&lt;ref name="Classic Horror"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://classic-horror.com/reviews/night_of_the_lepus_1972 |title=Night of the Lepus (1972) |first=Julia |last=Merriam |publisher=Classic-Horror.com |date=April 30, 2007 |accessdate=January 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Horror Films of the 1970s'', [[John Kenneth Muir]] felt ''Night of the Lepus'' was one of the "most ridiculous horror film[s] ever conceived", with a poor blend of horror and environmentalism that resulted in it being more of a comedy. He criticized the "primitive special effects", badly done editing and laughable dialogue, and noted that while the rabbits and actors are rarely seen on screen together, the filmmakers used obviously fake rabbit paws and people in rabbit suits for the few scenes calling for human/rabbit interactions. Like most critics, he pointed out that the rabbits were "cute bunnies" rather than "fanged, disease-ridden mutated creatures", but he felt the actors did the best they could with the material, and praised them for "[keeping] straight faces as they heroically stand against the onslaught of the bunnies".&lt;ref name="Horror films"&gt;{{cite book |title=Horror Films of the 1970s |first= John Kenneth |last=Muir |publisher=[[McFarland &amp; Company]] |date=August 20, 2002 |isbn=0-7864-1249-6 |chapter=1972: Night of the Lepus |pages=216–219 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1019">A '''plant''' in [[control theory]] is the combination of [[Process (engineering)|process]] and [[actuator]]. A plant is often referred to with a [[transfer function]]
(not uncommonly in the [[s-domain]]) which indicates the relation between an input signal and the output signal of a system without feedback, commonly determined by physical properties of the system. An example would be an [[actuator]] with its transfer of the input of the actuator to its physical displacement. In a system with feedback, the plant still has the same transfer function, but a control unit and a feedback loop (with their respective transfer functions) are added to the system.

A plot twist may be [[Foreshadowing|foreshadowed]], to prepare the audience to accept it. There are a variety of methods used to execute a plot twist, such as withholding information from the audience or misleading them with ambiguous or false information.

Revealing a plot twist to readers or viewers in advance is commonly regarded as a "[[spoiler (media)|spoiler]]", since the effectiveness of a plot twist usually relies on the audience not expecting it. Even revealing the fact that a work contains plot twists – especially at the ending – can also be controversial, as it changes the audience's expectations. However, at least one study suggests that this does not affect the enjoyment of a work.&lt;ref&gt;Jonah Lehrer, [https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/08/spoilers-dont-spoil-anything/ Spoilers Don’t Spoil Anything], '' Wired Science Blogs''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early examples==
An early example of the romance genre&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Arabian Nights Reader|first=Ulrich|last=Marzolph|publisher=[[Wayne State University Press]]|year=2006|isbn=0-8143-3259-5|pages=240–2|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'' tale "[[The Three Apples]]". It begins with a fisherman discovering a locked chest. The first twist occurs when the chest is broken open and a dead body is found inside. The initial search for the murderer fails, and a twist occurs when two men appear, separately claiming to be the murderer. A complex chain of events finally reveals the murderer to be the investigator's own slave.

==Mechanics==
{{section refimprove|date=September 2014}}
Literary analysts have identified several common categories of plot twists, based on how they are executed.

===Anagnorisis===
''[[Anagnorisis]]'', or discovery, is the protagonist's sudden recognition of their own or another character's true identity or nature.&lt;ref name="Baldick2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Chris Baldick|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mp0s9GgrafUC&amp;pg=PA12|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-920827-2|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through this technique, previously unforeseen character information is revealed. A notable example of anagnorisis occurs in ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'': [[Oedipus]] kills his father and marries his mother in ignorance, learning the truth only toward the climax of the play.&lt;ref&gt;John MacFarlane, "Aristotle's Definition of Anagnorisis." ''American Journal of Philology'' - Volume 121, Number 3 (Whole Number 483), Fall 2000, pp. 367-383.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest use of this device as a twist ending in a [[crime fiction|murder mystery]] was in "[[The Three Apples]]", a medieval ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'' tale, where the protagonist [[Ja'far ibn Yahya]] discovers by chance a key item towards the end of the story that reveals the culprit behind the murder to be his own slave all along.&lt;ref name=Pinault&gt;{{Cite book|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992|isbn=90-04-09530-6|pages=95–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Marzolph&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Arabian Nights Reader|first=Ulrich|last=Marzolph|publisher=[[Wayne State University Press]]|year=2006|isbn=0-8143-3259-5|pages=241–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[M. Night Shyamalan]]'s 1999 film ''[[The Sixth Sense]]'', a main character, who struggles with his failure to help a former patient who shot him, resolves his conflict by helping a boy who believes he communicates with dead people, only to discover that he didn't survive the shooting and is one of the dead people being helped. In the 2001 film ''[[The Others (2001 film)|The Others]],'' a mother is convinced that her house is being haunted; at the end of the film, she learns that she and her children are really the ghosts. In the episode of ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'' titled "[[Five Characters in Search of an Exit]]", the viewer discovers at the climax that the characters are discarded toys in a [[clothing bin|donation bin]].&lt;!-- This fact is self evident by watching the episode.--&gt; In ''[[Fight Club (film)|Fight Club]]'', [[Edward Norton]]'s character realizes that Tyler Durden ([[Brad Pitt]]) is his own [[multiple personality]]. A mental patient in the horror film ''[[The Ward (film)|The Ward]]'' reveals that the three persons she is talking to are all actually herself. Sometimes the audience may discover that the true identity of a character is, in fact, unknown, as in ''[[Layer Cake (film)|Layer Cake]]'' or the eponymous assassins in ''[[V for Vendetta]]'' and ''[[The Day of the Jackal]]''.

===Flashback===
[[Flashback (narrative)|Flashback]], or analepsis, a sudden, vivid reversion to a past event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Chris Baldick|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mp0s9GgrafUC&amp;pg=PA13|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-920827-2|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;, surprises the reader with previously unknown information that solves a mystery, places a character in a different light, or reveals the reason for a previously inexplicable action. The [[Alfred Hitchcock]] film ''[[Marnie (film)|Marnie]]'' employed this type of surprise ending. Sometimes this is combined with the above category, as the flashback may reveal the true identity of one of the characters, or that the protagonist is related to one of the villain's past victims, as [[Sergio Leone]] did with [[Charles Bronson]]'s character in ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]]'' or [[Frederick Forsyth]]'s ''[[The Odessa File]]''. The TV series ''[[Boardwalk Empire]]'' and manga (twice made into a movie) ''[[Old Boy (manga)|Old Boy]]'' uses similar twists.

===Unreliable narrator===
An [[unreliable narrator]] twists the ending by revealing, almost always at the end of the narrative, that the narrator has manipulated or fabricated the preceding story, thus forcing the reader to question their prior assumptions about the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Chris Baldick|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mp0s9GgrafUC&amp;pg=PA347|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-920827-2|page=347}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Motif (literature)|motif]] is often used within [[noir fiction]] and [[Film noir|films]], notably in the film ''[[The Usual Suspects]]''. An unreliable narrator motif was employed by Agatha Christie in ''[[The Murder of Roger Ackroyd]]'', a novel that generated much controversy due to critics' contention that it was unfair to trick the reader in such a manipulative manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://my.en.com/~mcq/unreliable.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011224193140/http://my.en.com/~mcq/unreliable.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2001-12-24 |title=The ubiquitous unreliable narrator |publisher=My.en.com |date=1996-03-26 |accessdate=2012-12-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of unreliable narration is a character who has been revealed to be insane and thus causes the audience to question the previous narrative; notable examples of this are in the [[Terry Gilliam]] film ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]'', [[Chuck Palahniuk]]'s ''[[Fight Club (novel)|Fight Club]]'' (and [[David Fincher]]'s [[Fight Club|film adaptation]]), [[Gene Wolfe]]'s novel ''[[Book of the New Sun]]'', the second episode of ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', ''[[Premonition (2007 film)|Premonition]]'', [[Iain Pears]]'s ''[[An Instance of the Fingerpost]]'', ''[[Shutter Island (film)|Shutter Island]]'' and [[Kim Newman]]'s ''[[Life's Lottery]]''.

===Peripeteia===
''[[Peripeteia]]'' is a sudden reversal of the protagonist's fortune, whether for good or ill, that emerges naturally from the character's circumstances.&lt;ref name="PayneBarbera2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael Payne|author2=Jessica Rae Barbera|title=A Dictionary of Cultural and Critical Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZjSl5y_i8TEC&amp;pg=PA689|accessdate=23 July 2013|date=31 March 2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-2346-7|page=689}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the ''deus ex machina'' device, peripeteia must be logical within the frame of the story. An example of a reversal for ill would be [[Agamemnon]]'s sudden murder at the hands of his wife [[Clytemnestra]] in [[Aeschylus]]' ''[[The Oresteia]]'' or the inescapable situation [[Kate Hudson]]'s character finds herself in at the end of ''[[The Skeleton Key]]''. This type of ending was a common twist ending utilised by ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'', most effectively in the episode "[[Time Enough at Last]]" where [[Burgess Meredith]]'s character is robbed of all his hope by a simple but devastating accident with his glasses. A positive reversal of fortune would be Nicholas Van Orton's suicide attempt after mistakenly believing himself to have accidentally killed his brother, only to land safely in the midst of his own birthday party, in the film ''[[The Game (1997 film)|The Game]]''.

===Deus ex machina===
''[[Deus ex machina]]'' is a Latin term meaning "god out of the machine." It refers to an unexpected, artificial or improbable character, device or event introduced suddenly in a work of fiction to resolve a situation or untangle a plot.&lt;ref name="Shipley1964"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph Twadell Shipley|title=Dictionary of World Literature: Criticism, Forms, Techniques|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AlUVAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA156|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=1964|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|page=156|id=GGKEY:GL0NUL09LL7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Ancient Greek theater]], the "deus ex machina" ('ἀπὸ μηχανῆς θεός') was the character of a Greek god literally brought onto the stage via a crane (μηχανῆς—''mechanes''), after which a seemingly insoluble problem is brought to a satisfactory resolution by the god's will. In its modern, figurative sense, the "deus ex machina" brings about an ending to a narrative through unexpected (generally happy) resolution to what appears to be a problem that cannot be overcome (see [[Mel Brooks]]' ''[[History of the World, Part I]]''). This device is often used to end a bleak story on a more positive note.

===Poetic justice===
[[Poetic justice]] is a literary device in which [[virtue]] is ultimately rewarded or [[vice]] punished in such a way that the reward or punishment has a logical connection to the deed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph Twadell Shipley|title=Dictionary of World Literature: Criticism, Forms, Techniques|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AlUVAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA439|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=1964|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|page=439|id=GGKEY:GL0NUL09LL7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern literature, this device is often used to create an [[Irony|ironic]] twist of fate in which the villain gets caught up in his/her own trap. For example, in [[C. S. Lewis]]' ''[[The Horse and His Boy]]'', Prince Rabadash climbs upon a mounting block during the battle in Archenland. Upon jumping down while shouting "The bolt of [[Tash (Narnia)|Tash]] falls from above," his [[hauberk]] catches on a hook and leaves him hanging there, humiliated and trapped. Another example of poetic justice can be found in [[John Boyne]]'s ''[[The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas]]'', in which a [[concentration camp]] commander's son is mistakenly caught up with inmates rounded up for gassing, or in [[Chris Van Allsburg]]'s picture book, ''[[The Sweetest Fig]]'', where a cold-hearted dentist is cruel to his dog, and ends up getting his comeuppance.

===Chekhov's gun===
[[Chekhov's gun]] refers to a seemingly minor character or plot element introduced early in the narrative that suddenly acquires great importance to the narrative. One example of this is the beggar woman in ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street|Sweeney Todd]]''. At the end of the musical, she is revealed to be the main character's wife.&lt;ref name="BergmanLambert2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gregory Bergman|author2=Josh Lambert|title=Geektionary: From Anime to Zettabyte, An A to Z Guide to All Things Geek|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CbYLQfZrUPcC&amp;pg=PA201|accessdate=23 July 2013|date=18 December 2010|publisher=Adams Media|isbn=978-1-4405-1188-2|page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar mechanism is the "plant", a preparatory device that repeats throughout the story. During the resolution, the true significance of the plant is revealed.

===Red herring===
A [[red herring]] is a false clue intended to lead investigators toward an incorrect solution.&lt;ref name="Asong2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Linus Asong|title=Detective Fiction and the African Scene: From the Whodunit? to the Whydunit?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DGH1BpSyI2AC&amp;pg=PA31|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=2012|publisher=African Books Collective|isbn=978-9956-727-02-5|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; This device usually appears in [[detective fiction|detective novels]] and [[mystery fiction]]. The red herring is a type of [[wikt:misdirection|misdirection]], a device intended to distract the [[protagonist]], and by extension the reader, away from the correct answer or from the site of pertinent clues or action. The Indian murder mystery film ''[[Gupt: The Hidden Truth]]'' cast many veteran actors who had usually played villainous roles in previous Indian films as red herrings in this film to deceive the audience into suspecting them. In the bestselling novel ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'', the misdeeds of a key character named "Bishop Aringarosa" draw attention away from the true master villain ("Aringarosa" literally translates as "pink herring"). In the [[William Diehl]] novel [[Primal Fear (novel)|Primal Fear]] (also adapted into a [[Primal Fear (film)|film]]), a defendant named [[Aaron Stampler]] is accused of brutally murdering the Archbishop of Chicago. He is revealed to have a [[dissociative identity disorder]], and is not executed on plea of insanity. Near the end, Aaron's lawyer discovers that he feigned his insanity to avoid the death penalty. Agatha Christie's classic ''[[And Then There Were None]]'' is another famous example and includes the term as well in a murder ploy where the intended victims are made to guess that one of them will be killed through an act of treachery. A red herring can also be used as a form of false [[foreshadowing]].

=== False protagonist ===
A [[false protagonist]] is a character presented at the start of the story as the main character, but then disposed of, usually killing them. An example is the film ''[[Executive Decision]]'', in which the [[Special forces|special-forces]] team leader, played by highly-billed action star [[Steven Seagal]], is killed shortly after their mission begins.

===In medias res===
''[[In medias res]]'' ([[Latin]] for "into the middle of things") is a literary technique in which narrative proceeds from the middle of the story rather than its beginning.&lt;ref name="Clifford2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tim Clifford|title=The Middle School Writing Toolkit: Differentiated Instruction Across the Content Areas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ofntq_pjaocC&amp;pg=PA63|accessdate=23 July 2013|date=1 January 2013|publisher=Maupin House Publishing, Inc.|isbn=978-0-929895-75-8|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Information such as characterization, setting, and motive is revealed through a series of [[flashback (literary technique)|flashback]]s. This technique creates a twist when the cause for the inciting incident is not revealed until the climax. This technique is used within the film ''[[The Prestige (film)|The Prestige]]'' in which the opening scenes show one of the main characters drowning and the other being imprisoned. Subsequent scenes reveal the events leading up to these situations through a series of flashbacks. In ''[[Monsters (2010 film)|Monsters]]'', a similar beginning proves to be a flashforward as it is the linear conclusion of the events that then follow; this is not apparent until the end. ''In medias res'' is often used to provide a [[narrative hook]].

===Non-linear narrative===
A [[non-linear narrative]] works by revealing plot and character in non-chronological order.&lt;ref name="Steiff2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Josef Steiff|title=Sherlock Holmes and Philosophy: The Footprints of a Gigantic Mind|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vq24xAyfoq0C&amp;pg=PA96|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=2011|publisher=Open Court|isbn=978-0-8126-9731-5|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technique requires the reader to attempt to piece together the timeline in order to fully understand the story. A twist ending can occur as the result of information that is held until the climax and which places characters or events in a different perspective. Some of the earliest known uses of non-linear story telling occur in ''[[The Odyssey]]'', a work that is largely told in flashback via the narrator [[Odysseus]]. The nonlinear approach has been used in works such as the films ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]'', ''[[Sin City (film)|Sin City]]'', ''[[Premonition (2007 film)|Premonition]]'', ''[[Arrival (film)|Arrival]]'', ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]'', ''[[Memento (film)|Memento]]'', ''[[Babel (film)|Babel]]'', the television shows [[Lost (TV series)|''Lost'']], ''[[How I Met Your Mother (TV series)|How I Met Your Mother]]'' (especially in many episodes in the later seasons), ''[[Heroes (U.S. TV series)|Heroes]]'', ''[[Westworld (TV series)|Westworld]]'' and the book ''[[Catch-22]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Adrienne Redd, [http://prosetoad.blogspot.com/2006/01/nonlinear-films-and-anticausality-of.html Nonlinear films and the anticausality of Mulholland Dr.], '' Prose Toad Literary Blog''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plotsinc.com/sitenew/column_art_02.html |title=Plots Inc.

===Reverse chronology===
[[Reverse chronology]] works by revealing the plot in reverse order, i.e., from final event to initial event.&lt;ref name="Philips2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Edward Philips|title=Writing African History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pq5wGaae5qkC&amp;pg=PA507|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=2006|publisher=University Rochester Press|isbn=978-1-58046-256-3|page=507}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike chronological storylines, which progress through causes before reaching a final effect, reverse chronological storylines reveal the final effect before tracing the causes leading up to it; therefore, the initial cause represents a "twist ending". Examples employing this technique include the films ''[[Irréversible]]'', ''[[Memento (film)|Memento]]'', ''[[Happy End (1966 film)|Happy End]]'' and ''[[5x2]]'', the play ''[[Betrayal (play)|Betrayal]]'' by [[Harold Pinter]], and [[Martin Amis]]' ''[[Time's Arrow (novel)|Time's Arrow]]''. [[Stephen Sondheim]] and [[George Furth|George Furth's]] [[Merrily_We_Roll_Along_(musical)|Merrily We Roll Along]] and the [[Merrily_We_Roll_Along_(play)|1934 Kaufman and Hart play]] that inspired it both tell the story of the main characters in reverse order.

{{Philosophy of religion sidebar |challenges}}

The '''problem of religious language''' considers whether it is possible to talk about [[God]] meaningfully if the traditional conceptions of God as being incorporeal, infinite, and timeless, are accepted. Because these traditional conceptions of God make it difficult to describe God, religious language has the potential to be meaningless. Theories of religious language either attempt to demonstrate that such language is meaningless, or attempt to show how religious language can still be meaningful.

Traditionally, religious language has been explained as [[Apophatic theology|via negativa]], analogy, symbolism, or myth, each of which describes a way of talking about God in human terms. The ''via negativa'' is a way of referring to God according to what God is not; analogy uses human qualities as standards against which to compare divine qualities; symbolism is used non-literally to describe otherwise [[ineffability|ineffable]] experiences; and a mythological interpretation of religion attempts to reveal fundamental truths behind religious stories. Alternative explanations of religious language cast it as having political, performative, or imperative functions.

Empiricist [[David Hume|David Hume's]] requirement that claims about reality must be verified by evidence influenced the [[logical positivism|logical positivist]] movement, particularly the philosopher [[A. J. Ayer]]. The movement proposed that, for a statement to hold meaning, it must be possible to verify its truthfulness empirically&amp;nbsp;– with evidence from the senses. Consequently, the logical positivists argued that religious language must be meaningless because the propositions it makes are impossible to verify. Austrian philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] has been regarded as a logical positivist by some academics because he distinguished between things that can and cannot be spoken about; others have argued that he could not have been a logical positivist because he emphasised the importance of mysticism. British philosopher [[Antony Flew]] proposed a similar challenge based on the principle that, in so far as assertions of religious belief cannot be empirically falsified, religious statements are rendered meaningless.

The analogy of [[language-games|games]]&amp;nbsp;– most commonly associated with Ludwig Wittgenstein&amp;nbsp;– has been proposed as a way of establishing meaning in religious language. The theory asserts that language must be understood in terms of a game: just as each game has its own rules determining what can and cannot be done, so each context of language has its own rules determining what is and is not meaningful. Religion is classified as a possible and legitimate language game which is meaningful within its own context. Various parables have also been proposed to solve the problem of meaning in religious language. [[R. M. Hare]] used his parable of a lunatic to introduce the concept of "bliks"&amp;nbsp;– unfalsifiable [[belief-in|belief]]s according to which a worldview is established&amp;nbsp;– which are not necessarily meaningless. [[Basil Mitchell (academic)|Basil Mitchell]] used a parable to show that faith can be logical, even if it seems unverifiable. [[John Hick]] used his parable of the Celestial City to propose his theory of [[eschatological verification]], the view that if there is an afterlife, then religious statements will be verifiable after death.

==Problem of religious language==
Religious language is a philosophical problem arising from the difficulties in accurately describing God. Because God is generally conceived as incorporeal, infinite, and timeless, ordinary language cannot always apply to that entity.{{sfn|Weed|2007}} This makes speaking about or attributing properties to God difficult: a religious believer might simultaneously wish to describe God as good, yet also hold that God's goodness is unique and cannot be articulated by human language of goodness. This raises the problem of how (and whether) God can be meaningfully spoken about at all,{{sfn|Davies|2004|p=139–140}} which causes problems for religious belief since the ability to describe and talk about God is important in religious life.{{sfn|White|2010|p=1}} The French philosopher [[Simone Weil]] expressed this problem in her work ''Waiting for God'', in which she outlined her dilemma: she was simultaneously certain of God's love and conscious that she could not adequately describe him.{{sfn|McFague|1982|p=1}}

The medieval doctrine of [[divine simplicity]] also poses problems for religious language. This suggests that God has no [[Accident (philosophy)|accidental properties]]&amp;nbsp;– these are properties that a being can have which do not contribute to its essence. If God has no accidental properties, he cannot be as he is traditionally conceived, because properties such as goodness are accidental. If divine simplicity is accepted, then to describe God as good would entail that goodness and God have the same definition.{{sfn|Weed|2007}} Such limits can also be problematic to religious believers; for example, the [[Bible]] regularly ascribes different emotions to God, ascriptions which would be implausible according to the doctrine of divine simplicity.{{sfn|White|2010|p=1–2}}

The theologian [[Sallie McFague]] believes that the more recent problem of religious language is based on individual experience, owing to the increased [[secularism|secularisation]] of society. She notes that human experience is of this world rather than regular encounters with the divine, which makes the experience of God uncommon and potentially unnecessary. Because of this, she argues, religious language is both [[idolatry|idolatrous]] because it fails to express sufficient awe of God, and irrelevant because without adequate words it becomes meaningless.{{sfn|McFague|1982|p=1–2}}

==Classical understanding of religious language==

===Via negativa===
[[File:Rambam-portrait.jpg|thumb|18th-century depiction of Maimonides, who developed the ''via negativa'']]

[[Jewish philosophy|Jewish philosopher]] [[Maimonides]] believed that God can only be ascribed negative attributes, a view based on two fundamental Jewish beliefs: that the existence of God must be accepted, and that it is forbidden to describe God.{{sfn|Levin|Schweid|2008|p=237}} Maimonides believed that God is [[divine simplicity|simple]] and so cannot be ascribed any essential attributes.{{sfn|Hyman|2008|p=400}} He therefore argued that statements about God must be taken negatively, for example, "God lives" should be taken as "God does not lack vitality".{{sfn|Seeskin|2005|p=88}} Maimonides did not believe that God holds all of his attributes perfectly and without impairment; rather, he proposed that God lies outside of any human measures. To say that God is powerful, for example, would mean that God's power is beyond worldly power, and incomparable to any other power. In doing so, Maimonides attempted to illustrate God's indescribable nature and draw attention to the linguistic limits of describing God.{{sfn|Seeskin|2005|p=89}}

===Analogy===
[[Thomas Aquinas]] argued that statements about God are analogous to human experience.{{sfn|Weed|2007}} An analogous term is partly [[univocity|univocal]] (has only one meaning) and partly [[Equivocation|equivocal]] (has more than one potential meaning) because an analogy is in some ways the same and in some ways different from the subject.{{sfn|Cahalan|1985|p=438}} He proposed that those godly qualities which resemble human qualities are described analogously, with reference to human terms; for example, when God is described as good, it does not mean that God is good in human terms, but that human goodness is used as a reference to describe God's goodness.{{sfn|Weed|2007}}

Philosopher [[Taede A. Smedes|Taede Smedes]] argued that religious language is symbolic.{{sfn|Depoortere|van Erp|Boeve|2010|p=44}} Denying any conflict between science and religion, he proposes that 'to believe' means to accept a conviction (that God exists, in the context of Christianity), which is different from 'knowing', which only occurs once something is proven. Thus, according to Smedes, we believe things that we do not know for sure.{{sfn|Depoortere|van Erp|Boeve|2010|p=41}} Smedes argues that, rather than being part of the world, God is so far beyond the world that there can be no common standard to which both God and the world can be compared.{{sfn|Depoortere|van Erp|Boeve|2010|p=43}} He argues that people can still believe in God, even though he cannot be compared to anything in the world, because belief in God is just an alternative way of viewing that world (he likens this to two people viewing a painting differently).{{sfn|Depoortere|van Erp|Boeve|2010|p=45-46}} Smedes claims that there should be no reason to look for a meaning behind our metaphors and symbols of God because the metaphors are all we have of God. He suggests that we can only talk of God ''pro nobis'' (for us) and not ''in se'' (as such) or ''sine nobis'' (without us). The point, he argues, is not that our concept of God should correspond with reality, but that we can only conceive of God through metaphors.{{sfn|Depoortere|van Erp|Boeve|2010|p=44}}

In the twentieth century, [[Ian Ramsey]] developed the theory of analogy, a development later cited in numerous works by [[Alister McGrath]]. He argued that various models of God are provided in religious writings that interact with each other: a range of analogies for salvation and the nature of God. Ramsey proposed that the models used modify and qualify each other, defining the limits of other analogies. As a result, no one analogy on its own is sufficient, but the combination of every analogy presented in Scripture gives a full and consistent depiction of God.{{sfn|McGrath|2011|loc=ch. 13}} The use of other analogies may then be used to determine if any one model of God is abused or improperly applied.{{sfn|McGrath|1998|p=183}}

===Symbolism===
[[File:Sri Guru Granth Sahib Nishan.jpg|thumb|Sikh religious text, the Sri Guru Granth Sahib Nishan, in which religious language is used symbolically]]
Philosopher [[Paul Tillich]] argued that religious faith is best expressed through symbolism because a symbol points to a meaning beyond itself and best expresses transcendent religious beliefs. He believed that any statement about God is symbolic and participates in the meaning of a concept.{{sfn|Cooper|1997|p=134}} Tillich used the example of a national flag to illustrate his point: a flag points to something beyond itself, the country it represents, but also participates in the meaning of the country. He believed that symbols could unite a religious believer with a deeper dimension of himself as well as with a greater reality.{{sfn|Dourley|1975|p=85–6}} Tillich believed that symbols must emerge from an individual collective unconsciousness, and can only function when they are accepted by the unconscious. He believed that symbols cannot be invented, but live and die at the appropriate times.{{sfn|Rees|2001|p=80}}

[[Louis Dupré (philosopher)|Louis Dupré]] differentiates between signs and symbols, proposing that a sign points to something while a symbol represents it. A symbol holds its own meaning: rather than merely pointing someone towards another object, it takes the place of and represents that object. He believes that a symbol has some ambiguity which does not exist with a sign.{{sfn|Dupré|2000|p=1}} Dupré believes that a symbol may deserve respect because it contains what is signified within itself.{{sfn|Dupré|2000|p=1–2}} A symbol reveals a reality beyond what is already perceived and transforms the ways the current reality is perceived.{{sfn|Dupré|2000|p=2}} Dupré differentiates between religious and [[aesthetic]] symbols, suggesting that a religious symbol points towards something which "remains forever beyond our reach". He proposed that a religious symbol does not reveal the nature of what it signifies, but conceals it.{{sfn|Dupré|2000|p=6}}

[[Langdon Brown Gilkey]] explained religious language and experience in terms of symbolism, identifying three characteristic features of religious symbolism which distinguish it from other language use. Firstly, religious symbolism has a double focus, referring both to something empirical and to something transcendent; Gilkey argued that the empirical manifestation points towards the transcendent being. Secondly, he believed that religious symbolism concerns fundamental questions of life, involving issues important to an individual or community. Finally, he argued that religious symbols provide standards by which life should be lived.{{sfn|Pasewark|Pool|1999|p=103}}

In the [[Sikhism|Sikh]] religious text the [[Guru Granth Sahib]], religious language is used symbolically and metaphorically. In the text, Sikh Gurus repeat that the [[religious experience|experiences]] they have while [[meditation|meditating]] are [[ineffability|ineffable]], incognizable, incomprehensible, and transensuous&amp;nbsp;– this means that there is no object of their experience that can be conceptualised.{{sfn|Singh|1990|p=185}} To overcome this, the Sikh Gurus used symbolic and metaphorical language, assuming that there is a resemblance between the mystical experience of the divine (the sabad) and those experiencing it. For example, light is used to refer to the spiritual reality.{{sfn|Singh|1990|p=186}}

===Myth===
William Paden argued that religious language uses myth to present truths through stories. He argued that to those who practice a religion, myths are not mere fiction, but provide religious truths. Paden believed that a myth must explain something in the world with reference to a sacred being or force, and dismissed any myths which did not as "[[Folklore|folktale]]s".{{sfn|Paden|1994|p=73–74}} Using the example of [[creation myth]]s, he differentiated myths from scientific hypotheses, the latter of which can be scientifically verified and do not reveal a greater truth; a myth cannot be analysed in the same way as a scientific theory.{{sfn|Paden|1994|p=73–74}}

[[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] theologian [[Rudolf Bultmann]] proposed that the Bible contains [[existentialism|existential]] content which is expressed through mythology; Bultmann sought to find the existential truths behind the veil of mythology, a task known as 'demythologising'.{{sfn|Sherratt|2006|p=81}} Bultmann distinguished between informative language and language with personal import, the latter of which commands obedience. He believed that God interacts with humans as the divine Word, perceiving a linguistic character inherent in God, which seeks to provide humans with self-understanding.{{sfn|Sherratt|2006|p=82}} Bultmann believed that the cultural embeddedness of the Bible could be overcome by demythologising the Bible, a process which he believed would allow readers to better encounter the word of God.{{sfn|Dray|2002|p=259}}

Christian philosopher John Hick believed that the language of the Bible should be demythologised to be compatible with [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]]. He offered a demythologised [[Christology]], arguing that Jesus was not God incarnate, but a man with incredible experience of divine reality. To Hick, calling Jesus the [[Son of God]] was a metaphor used by Jesus' followers to describe their commitment to what Jesus represented.{{sfn|Mbogu|2008|p=117}} Hick believed that demythologising the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnation]] would make sense of the variety of world religions and give them equal validity as ways to encounter God.{{sfn|Hebblethwaite|1987|p=7}}

==Alternative explanations of religious language==

===Political===
Islamic philosopher [[Carl Ernst]] has argued that religious language is often political, especially in the public sphere, and that its purpose is to persuade people and establish authority, as well as convey information. He explains that the modern criticisms of the West made by some sections of Islam are an ideological reaction to colonialism, which intentionally uses the same language as colonialists.{{sfn|Ernst|2004|p=8}} Ernst argues that when it is used rhetorically, religious language cannot be taken at face value because of its political implications.{{sfn|Ernst|2004|p=9}}

===Performative===
Peter Donovan argues that most religious language is not about making [[Truth claim|truth-claim]]s; instead, it is used to achieve certain goals.{{sfn|Donovan|1982|p=78}} He notes that language can be used in alternative ways beyond making statements of fact, such as expressing feelings or asking questions. Donovan calls many of these uses ''performative'', as they serve to perform a certain function within religious life. For example, the words "I promise" perform the action of promising themselves&amp;nbsp;– Donovan argues that most religious language fulfils this function.{{sfn|Donovan|1982|p=79–80}} Ludwig Wittgenstein also proposed that language could be performative and presented a list of the different uses of language. Wittgenstein argued that "the meaning of the language is in the use", taking the use of language to be performative.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=29}} The philosopher [[J. L. Austin]] argued that religious language is not just cognitive but can perform social acts, including vows, blessings, and the naming of children.{{sfn|Hoffman|2007|p=26}} He distinguished performative statements as those that do not simply describe a state of affairs, but bring them about.{{sfn|Lawson|McCauley|1993|p=51}} Historian of religion Benjamin Ray uses the performance of rituals within religions as evidence for a performative interpretation of language. He argues that the language of rituals can perform social tasks: when a priest announces that a spiritual event has occurred, those present believe it because of the spiritual authority of the priest. He believed that the meaning of a ritual is defined by the language used by the speaker, who is defined culturally as a superhuman agent.{{sfn|Lawson|McCauley|1993|p=51–2}}

===Imperative===
British philosopher [[R. B. Braithwaite]] attempted to approach religious language [[empiricism|empirically]] and adopted Wittgenstein's idea of "meaning as use".{{sfn|Harris|2002|p=49}} He likened religious statements to moral statements because they are both non-descriptive yet still have a use and a meaning; they do not describe the world, but the believer's attitudes towards it. Braithwaite believed that the main difference between a religious and a moral statement was that religious statements are part of a linguistic system of stories, metaphors, and [[parable]]s.{{sfn|Tracy|1996|p=121}}

Professor [[Nathan Katz (professor)|Nathan Katz]] writes of the analogy of a burning building, used by the [[Buddha]] in the [[Lotus Sutra]], which casts religious language as imperative. In the analogy, a father sees his children at the top of a burning building. He persuades them to leave, but only by promising them toys if they leave. Katz argues that the message of the parable is not that the Buddha has been telling lies; rather, he believes that the Buddha was illustrating the imperative use of language. Katz believes that religious language is an imperative and an invitation, rather than a truth-claim.{{sfn|Katz|1982|p=232}}

==Challenges to religious language==

===David Hume===
In the conclusion of his ''[[Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding]]'', Scottish philosopher David Hume argued that statements that make claims about reality must be verified by experience, and dismissed those that cannot be verified as meaningless. Hume regarded most religious language as unverifiable by experiment and so dismissed it.{{sfn|Clack|Clack|2008|p=98}}
{{Quote|Does it contain any abstract reasoning concerning quantity or number? No. Does it contain any experimental reasoning concerning matter of fact of existence? No. Commit it then to the flames: for it can contain nothing but sophistry and illusion.|David Hume|''Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding''{{sfn|Clack|Clack|2008|p=98}}}}
Hume criticised the view that we cannot speak about God, and proposed that this view is no different from the skeptical view that God cannot be spoken about. He was unconvinced by Aquinas' theory of analogy and argued that God's attributes must be completely different from human attributes, making comparisons between the two impossible. Hume's scepticism influenced the logical positivist movement of the twentieth century.{{sfn|Jones|2006|p=171–2}}

===Logical positivism===
&lt;!--  Commented out: [[File:Alfred Jules Ayer.jpg|thumb|A. J. Ayer argued that religious language is meaningless because it is unverifiable.]] --&gt;
The [[logical positivism]] movement originated in the [[Vienna Circle]] and was continued by British philosopher [[A. J. Ayer]]. The Vienna Circle adopted the [[analytic-synthetic distinction|distinction between analytic and synthetic statements]]: analytic statements are those whose meaning is contained within the words themselves, such as definitions, tautologies or mathematical statements, while synthetic statements make claims about reality.{{sfn|Evans|1985|p=142}} To determine whether a synthetic statement is meaningful, the Vienna Circle developed a [[verifiability theory of meaning]], which proposed that for a synthetic statement to have cognitive meaning, its truthfulness must be empirically verifiable.{{sfn|Weinberg|2001|p=1}} Because claims about God cannot be empirically verified, the logical positivists argued that religious propositions are meaningless.{{sfn|Evans|1985|p=142}}

In 1936, Ayer wrote ''[[Language, Truth and Logic]]'', in which he claimed that religious language is meaningless.{{sfn|Attfield|2006|p=11}} He put forward a strong empirical position, arguing that all knowledge must either come from observations of the world or be [[logical truth|necessarily true]], like mathematical statements.{{sfn|Tracy|1996|p=120}} In doing so, he rejected [[metaphysics]], which considers the reality of a world beyond the natural world and science. Because it is based on metaphysics and is therefore unverifiable, Ayer denounced religious language, as well as statements about ethics or aesthetics, as meaningless.{{sfn|Oppy|Scott|2010|p=8}} Ayer challenged the meaningfulness of all statements about God&amp;nbsp;– theistic, atheistic and agnostic&amp;nbsp;– arguing that they are all equally meaningless because they all discuss the existence of a metaphysical, unverifiable being.{{sfn|Evans|1985|p=142}}

Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein finished his ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'' with the proposition that "Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent." Beverly and Brian Clack have suggested that because of this statement, Wittgenstein was taken for a positivist by many of his disciples because he made a distinction between what can and cannot be spoken about. They argue that this interpretation is inaccurate because Wittgenstein held the ''mystical'', which cannot be described, as important.{{sfn|Clack|Clack|1998|p=110}} Rather than dismissing the mystical as meaningless, as the logical positivists did, Wittgenstein believed that while the facts of the world remain the same, the perspective from which they are viewed will vary.{{sfn|Clack|Clack|1998|p=111}}

===Falsification===
The falsification principle has been developed as an alternative theory by which it may be possible to distinguish between those religious statements that may potentially have meaning, and those that are meaningless. It proposes that most religious language is [[unfalsifiable]] because there is no way that it could be empirically proven false. In a landmark paper published in 1945, [[Analytic philosophy|analytic]] philosopher [[Antony Flew]] argued that a meaningful statement must simultaneously assert and deny a state of affairs; for example, the statement "God loves us" both asserts that God loves us and denies that God does not love us. Flew maintained that if a religious believer could not say what circumstances would have to exist for their statements about God to be false, then they are unfalsifiable and meaningless.{{sfn|Tracy|1996|p=120}}

Using [[John Wisdom]]'s [[Parable of the Invisible Gardener|parable of the invisible gardener]], Flew attempted to demonstrate that religious language is unfalsifiable. The parable tells the story of two people who discover a garden on a deserted island; one believes it is tended to by a gardener, the other believes that it formed naturally, without the existence of a gardener. The two watch out for the gardener but never find him; the non-believer consequently maintains that there is no gardener, whereas the believer rationalises the non-appearance by suggesting that the gardener is invisible and cannot be detected.{{sfn|Lumsden|2009|p=44}} Flew contended that if the believer's interpretation is accepted, nothing is left of the original gardener. He argued that religious believers tend to adopt counterpart rationalisations in response to any apparent challenge to their beliefs from empirical evidence; and these beliefs consequently suffer a "death by a thousand qualifications" as they are qualified and modified so much that they end up asserting nothing meaningful.{{sfn|Jones|2006|p=172}} Flew applied his principles to religious claims such as God's love for humans, arguing that if they are meaningful assertions they would deny a certain state of affairs. He argued that when faced with evidence against the existence of a loving God, such as the terminal illness of a child, theists will qualify their claims to allow for such evidence; for example they may suggest that God's love is different from human love. Such qualifications, Flew argued, make the original proposition meaningless; he questioned what God's love actually promises and what it guarantees against, and proposed that God's qualified love promises nothing and becomes worthless.{{sfn|Allen|1992|p=283–284}}

Flew continued in many subsequent publications to maintain the falsifiability criterion for meaning; but in later life retracted the specific assertion in his 1945 paper that all religious language is unfalsifiable, and so meaningless.  Drawing specifically on the emerging science of [[molecular genetics]] (which had not existed at the time of his original paper), Flew eventually became convinced that the complexity this revealed in the mechanisms of biological reproduction might not be consistent with the time known to have been available for evolution on Earth to have happened; and that this potentially suggested a valid empirical test by which the assertion "that there is no creator God" might be falsified;  "the latest work I have seen shows that the present physical universe gives too little time for these theories of abiogenesis to get the job done."{{sfn|Flew|2007|p=124}}

==Analogies of games==
The analogy of a game was first proposed by [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] in an attempt to demonstrate the [[epistemology|epistemic]] unity of language. He suggested that language is like a game which everyone participates in and is played by a greater being.{{sfn|Horn|2005|p=111}} Gadamer believed that language makes up the fundamental structure of reality and that human language participates in a greater language; [[Christianity]] teaches this to be the [[logos (Christianity)|divine word]] which created the world and was incarnate in Jesus Christ.{{sfn|Cooper|2006|p=217–218}}

Ludwig Wittgenstein proposed a calculus theory of language, which maintained that all language should be analysable in a uniform way. Later in his life he rejected this theory, and instead proposed an alternative [[language-game]] analogy.{{sfn|Labron|2006|p=28}} He likened the differences in languages to the differences in games, arguing that just as there are many different games, each with different rules, so there are many different kinds of language.{{sfn|Horn|2005|p=112}} Wittgenstein argued that different forms of language have different rules which determine what makes a proposition meaningful; outside of its language-game, a proposition is meaningless. He believed that the meaning of a proposition depends on its context and the rules of that context.{{sfn|Glock|1996|p=192–193}} Wittgenstein presented a language game as a situation in which certain kinds of language are used. He provided some examples of language games: "Asking, thanking, greeting, cursing, praying".{{sfn|Brenner|1999|p=16}}
{{quote|It is as if someone were to say: 'A game consists of moving objects about on a surface according to certain rules...'&amp;nbsp;– and we replied: You seem to be thinking of board games, but there are others.|Ludwig Wittgenstein|''[[Philosophical Investigations]]''{{sfn|Horn|2005|p=112}}}}
Wittgenstein believed that religion is significant because it offers a particular way of life, rather than confirming the existence of God. He therefore believed that religious language is confessional&amp;nbsp;– a confession of what someone feels and believes&amp;nbsp;– rather than consisting of claims to truth. Wittgenstein believed that religious language is different from language used to describe physical objects because it occupies a different language game.{{sfn|Clack|1999|p=79}}

[[Dewi Zephaniah Phillips]] defended Wittgenstein's theory by arguing that although religious language games are autonomous, they should not be treated as isolated because they make statements about secular events such as birth and death. Phillips argued that because of this connection, religions can still be criticised based on human experiences of these secular events. He maintained that religion cannot be denounced as wrong because it is not empirical.{{sfn|Lacewing|Pascal|2007|p=173–4}}

Peter Donovan criticises the language-games approach for failing to recognise that religions operate in a world containing other ideas and that many religious people make claims to truth. He notes that many religious believers not only believe their religion to be meaningful and true in its own context, but claim that it is true against all other possible beliefs; if the language games analogy is accepted, such a comparison between beliefs is impossible.{{sfn|Donovan|1982|p=93}} Donovan proposes that debates between different religions, and the [[apologetics]] of some, demonstrates that they interact with each other and the wider world and so cannot be treated as isolated language games.{{sfn|Donovan|1982|p=94–95}}

==Parables==

===R. M. Hare===
In response to Flew's falsification principle, British philosopher [[R. M. Hare]] told a parable in an attempt to demonstrate that religious language is meaningful. Hare described a lunatic who believes that all university professors want to kill him; no amount of evidence of kindly professors will dissuade him from this view. Hare called this kind of unfalsifiable conviction a "blik", and argued that it formed an unfalsifiable, yet still meaningful, worldview. He proposed that all people&amp;nbsp;– religious and non-religious&amp;nbsp;– hold bliks, and that they cannot be unseated by [[empirical evidence]]. Nevertheless, he maintained that a blik is meaningful because it forms the basis of a person's understanding of the world.{{sfn|Jones|2006|p=173}} Hare believed that some bliks are correct and others are not, though he did not propose a method of distinguishing between the two.{{sfn|Harris|2002|p=37–38}}

===Basil Mitchell===
Basil Mitchell responded to Flew's falsification principle with his own parable. He described an underground resistance soldier who meets a stranger who claims to be leading the resistance movement. The stranger tells the soldier to keep faith in him, even if he is seen to be fighting for the other side. The soldier's faith is regularly tested as he observes the stranger fighting for both sides, but his faith remains strong.{{sfn|Clarke|2001|p=148}} Mitchell's parable teaches that although evidence can challenge a religious belief, a believer still has reason to hold their views.{{sfn|Griffiths|Taliaferro|2003|p=108–109}} He argued that although a believer will not allow anything to count decisively against his beliefs, the theist still accepts the existence of evidence which could count against religious belief.{{sfn|Harris|2002|p=64}}

===John Hick===
{{See also|Eschatological verification}}
Responding to the verification principle, [[John Hick]] used his parable of the Celestial City to describe his theory of [[eschatological verificationism]]. His parable is of two travellers, a theist and an atheist, together on a road. The theist believes that there is a Celestial City at the end of the road; the atheist believes that there is no such city. Hick's parable is an allegory of the Christian belief in an afterlife, which he argued can be verified upon death.{{sfn|Polkinghorne|2003|p=145–146}} Hick believed that eschatological verification is "unsymmetrical" because while it could be verified if it is true, it cannot be falsified if not. This is in contrast to ordinary "symmetrical" statements, which can be verified or falsified.{{sfn|Cheetham|2003|p=39}}

In his biography of Hick, David Cheetham notes a criticism of Hick's theory: waiting for eschatological verification could make religious belief provisional, preventing total commitment to faith.{{sfn|Cheetham|2003|p=30}} Cheetham argues that such criticism is misapplied because Hick's theory was not directed to religious believers but to philosophers, who argued that religion is unverifiable and therefore meaningless.{{sfn|Cheetham|2003|p=30}}

James Morris notes that Hick's eschatological verification theory has been criticised for being inconsistent with his belief in [[religious pluralism]]. Morris argues that such criticism can be overcome by modifying Hick's parable to include multiple travellers, all with different beliefs, on the road. He argues that even if some beliefs about life after death are unverifiable, Hick's belief in [[bodily resurrection]] can still be verified.{{sfn|Harris|2002|p=64}}

'''''Star Cops''''' is a British science fiction television series first broadcast on [[BBC2]] in 1987. It was devised by [[Chris Boucher]], a writer who had previously worked on the science fiction television series ''[[Doctor Who]]'' and ''[[Blake's 7]]'' as well as crime dramas such as ''[[Juliet Bravo]]'' and ''[[Bergerac (TV series)|Bergerac]]''. Set in the year 2027, a time where [[Interplanetary travel]] has become commonplace, it starred [[David Calder (actor)|David Calder]] as Nathan Spring, commander of the International Space Police Force—nicknamed the "Star Cops"—who provide [[police|law enforcement]] for the newly developing colonies of the [[Solar System]]. The series follows Nathan Spring and the rest of his multinational team as they work to establish the Star Cops and solve whatever crimes come their way. Operating in a relatively accurately realised [[hard SF]], near-future, space environment, many of the cases that the Star Cops investigate arise from opportunities for new crimes presented by the technologically advanced future society the series depicts and from the hostile frontier nature of the environment that the Star Cops live in.

In total nine episodes of ''Star Cops'' were made. A tenth episode, titled "Death on the Moon", was planned but [[industrial relations]] difficulties during production led to it being abandoned shortly before recording was to commence. A combination of factors, including conflict between Boucher and producer Evgeny Gridneff and poor scheduling, meant that the series never found a satisfactory audience and the series was cancelled after one season. In recent years, ''Star Cops'' has undergone something of a critical re-appraisal and is generally hailed for being "a pretty good attempt at a moderately realistic "[[The High Frontier: Human Colonies in Space|High Frontier]]" SF series".&lt;ref name="SFX#50"&gt;{{ cite journal | last=Golder | first=Dave (editor) |date=April 1999 | title=The Top 50 SF TV Shows of All Time | journal=SFX | issue=supplement to issue 50 |page=17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish]] announced in November 2017 that they would be releasing new Star Cops audio plays starring some of the surviving original cast members, beginning in 2018.&lt;ref name="bigfinish.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bigfinish.com/news/v/star-cops-relaunches|title=Star Cops relaunches! |website=Bigfinish.com|accessdate=10 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept and setting==
{{quote |text = Spacemen are ten-a-penny. What they need out there is a good copper.|author=The Commander |source=''Star Cops'', episode 1: "An Instinct for Murder", written by Chris Boucher}}

''Star Cops'' is set in the year 2027—some 40 years into the future at time of broadcast—a time in which space travel has become common and mankind is in the process of exploiting and colonising the Solar System. There are five permanently manned [[space station]]s orbiting the Earth and there are bases on the [[Moon]] and [[Mars]]. Approximately 3,000 people are living and working in space.&lt;ref name="Black-1987"&gt;{{ cite magazine | last=Black | first=Johnny |date=July 1987 | title=High Noon |magazine=Radio Times | issue=4–10 July 1987 | pages=82–84 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This near future setting was influenced by the potential for greater access to space promised by the burgeoning [[Space Shuttle]] programme and by the [[militarisation of space]] through the US Government's [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] programme (also known as "Star Wars") both of which were underway in the early 1980s.&lt;ref name="Followell-2006"&gt;{{ cite video | people = Followell, Tony (Director) | title = The Cult of... Star Cops | medium = Television programme | publisher=BBC Scotland | location = United Kingdom | date = 28 November 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, space travel and life in space is portrayed in a realistic manner with depictions of [[weightlessness]] and low gravity environments and lengthy space journeys (months or years in cases of [[interplanetary travel]])&lt;ref name="Black-1987" /&gt; as well as hazards such as spacesuit failures,&lt;ref name="Boucher-1987a"&gt;Boucher, Chris (Writer) &amp; Baker, Christopher (Director).

Law and order is provided by the International Space Police Force (ISPF), twenty part-time volunteers disparagingly nicknamed the "Star Cops". The decision has been made to put the ISPF on a permanent full-time footing and a new commander, Nathan Spring, has been appointed to accomplish this.&lt;ref name="Boucher-1987a" /&gt; Many of the series episodes deal with Spring's efforts to establish the Star Cops—he sets up a base of operations on the Moonbase,&lt;ref name="Boucher-1987b"&gt;Boucher, Chris (Writer) &amp; Baker, Christopher, (1987).

;Nathan Spring ([[David Calder (actor)|David Calder]])
: Nathan Spring is a 41-year-old [[Chief Superintendent]]  in the [[British police|British police force]] who reluctantly accepts promotion to [[Commander#British police rank|Commander]] of the International Space Police Force with the brief of turning them into a full-time professional police force.&lt;ref name="Boucher-1987a" /&gt; Spring is a career policeman who has become disenchanted with the prevailing methods of policing which, he feels, are too dependent on computer logic and not on human instinct.&lt;ref name="McKay-1987" /&gt; His first job as a young detective was to arrest his own father, a computer salesman, for industrial espionage.&lt;ref name="Collee-1987c" /&gt; Spring is a man who is driven but lonely, a man who doesn't make friends easily and whose ability to do so is not easy on account of his choice of career and work environment.&lt;ref name="CB-Commentary-2"&gt;Commentary by Chris Boucher on "Little Green Men and Other Martians", in ''Star Cops. The Complete Series'' (DVD), Disc 3, Network.&lt;/ref&gt; His constant companion is Box, a prototype handheld computer (also voiced by Calder), bequeathed to him by his father.&lt;ref name="Boucher-1987c" /&gt; The conversations between Box and Spring provide insight into Spring's emotional state and thought processes as Spring engages in "almost Jacobean-style soliloquies" with the device.&lt;ref name="Topping-1997" /&gt;

;David Theroux ([[Erick Ray Evans]])
: Spring's second in command is [[Chief Superintendent]] David Theroux, an American. Theroux, an engineer, started out in the US space program but quit and joined the European space effort instead. When he is introduced in the opening episode, "An Instinct for Murder", he is working as a traffic controller and part-time Star Cop on the European space station ''[[Charles de Gaulle]]''.&lt;ref name="Boucher-1987a" /&gt; Movie buff Theroux generally tries to maintain an air of wise-cracking, cool detachment which breaks down only when he is forced in "This Case to be Opened in a Million Years" to face his morbid fear of [[radioactivity]].&lt;ref name="Martin-1987" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McKay-1987" /&gt;

;Colin Devis ([[Trevor Cooper]])
: When Spring's girlfriend, Lee Jones, is killed in "Conversations with the Dead", the task of investigating the murder is handed to Chief Inspector Colin Devis of the [[London Metropolitan Police]], "one of the Department's all-time cretins".&lt;ref name="Boucher-1987b" /&gt; Devis' pursuit of the killer, an agent of the [[MI5|British Secret Service]], costs him his job but Spring compensates him by hiring him, at the rank of [[Inspector]], for the ISPF.&lt;ref name="Boucher-1987b" /&gt; Although Devis is not the sharpest investigator, his heart is in the right place and he is fiercely loyal to Spring.&lt;ref name="PM-Commentary"&gt;Commentary by Philip Martin on ''This Case to be Opened in a Million Years'', in "Star Cops. The Complete Series" (DVD), Disc 2, Network.&lt;/ref&gt; Overweight, sexist and bigoted, five times married Devis is the series' main comedy element and frequently gets the best lines.&lt;ref name="Topping-1997" /&gt;

;Pal Kenzy (Linda Newton)
: Australian Pal Kenzy is briefly glimpsed in "An Instinct for Murder" and then introduced properly in "Intelligent Listening for Beginners" where she is fired by Spring for corruption. Determined not to go quietly, Spring is forced to reinstate her when she foils an attempted hijacking on the Earth-Moon shuttle.&lt;ref name="Boucher-1987c" /&gt; She has a stormy relationship with Spring who mistrusts her but over the course of the series they develop a close bond.&lt;ref name="McKay-1987" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Topping-1997" /&gt; By the end of the series it is apparent that Spring has saved her from falling into a pit of corruption whereas she has restored his faith in humanity.&lt;ref name="Topping-1997" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CB-Commentary-2" /&gt;

;Anna Shoun (Sayo Inaba)
: Rounding off the team is Dr Anna Shoun, a 29-year-old general [[physician]] from Japan.&lt;ref name="Collee-1987a" /&gt; Spring takes her on when she is fired for betraying her employers, the multinational Hanimed corporation, to the Star Cops in the episode "In Warm Blood".&lt;ref name="Collee-1987a" /&gt; The Shoun character has been criticised as a [[ethnic stereotype|racial stereotype]], a charge that has also been levelled at other aspects of the series such as depicting Italians as members of the [[Mafia]], Arabs as [[Islamism|Islamists]] and Americans as jingoistic warmongers.&lt;ref name="McKay-1987" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Topping-1997" /&gt;

;Alexander Krivenko ([[Jonathan Adams (British actor)|Jonathan Adams]])
: Finally, introduced in ''Trivial Games and Paranoid Pursuits'', is Russian Alexander Krivenko, the commander of the Moonbase where the ISPF have their headquarters. A winner of the [[Nobel Prize|Nobel Prize for Medicine]], it is Krivenko's research into bone damage that has contributed to enabling humanity to access space easily.&lt;ref name="Boucher-1987d" /&gt; Although the Star Cops are independent, Spring's relationship with Krivenko is often deferential and he frequently seems to capitulate to Krivenko's wishes.&lt;ref name="McKay-1987" /&gt;

== Production history ==

=== Origins ===

Chris Boucher began his television writing career in comedy, working on such programmes as ''[[Dave Allen (comedian)|Dave Allen at Large]]'' and ''[[Romany Jones]]'', before moving on to write for drama series, including ''[[Shoestring (TV series)|Shoestring]]'', ''Juliet Bravo'' and ''Bergerac''.&lt;ref name="imbd-Boucher"&gt;{{IMDb name|id=0098980|name=Chris Boucher}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was no stranger to television science fiction, having written three serials for ''Doctor Who'' and having acted as [[script editor]] on the entire four season run of ''Blake's 7'' as well as writing nine episodes for it himself.&lt;ref name="imbd-Boucher" /&gt; Boucher originally pitched ''Star Cops'' to the BBC in 1981 as a radio series but, with [[James Follet]]'s epic ''[[Earthsearch]]'' serial in production that year, it was felt that science fiction was adequately served in the schedules and so Boucher tried to sell it to television instead.&lt;ref name="BBC-Cult"&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/classic/starcops/interview.shtml | title=Interview with Chris Boucher | accessdate=5 October 2006 | work=BBC Cult Website }}&lt;/ref&gt; He sent the draft script of the first ''Star Cops'' story to [[Jonathan Powell (producer)|Jonathan Powell]], the Head of Drama at BBC television.&lt;ref name="DVD-Makingof"&gt;Collinson, Gavin (Producer) (2004), "It Won't be Easy – The Making of Star Cops", in ''Star Cops. The Complete Series'' (DVD), Disc 1, Network.&lt;/ref&gt; Powell responded asking Boucher to write a second script and on the strength of this the series was commissioned.&lt;ref name="DVD-Makingof" /&gt; However, Powell insisted that the first story, which Boucher had intended to run over two episodes, be reworked into a single episode.&lt;ref name="DVD-Makingof" /&gt; This would be the first of many difficulties Boucher would have with how ''Star Cops'' was eventually realised for the screen. Boucher, who at this time was working as script editor on the crime series ''Bergerac'', was also told by Powell he could work on ''Star Cops'' or on ''Bergerac'' but not on both and so chose to leave ''Bergerac''.&lt;ref name="Nazzaro-1991" /&gt;

=== Production ===

Assigned to produce ''Star Cops'' was Evgeny Gridneff, who had previously worked for the BBC on ''[[Tenko (TV series)|Tenko]]'', ''[[Blott on the Landscape]]'' and ''[[Hold the Back Page]]''.&lt;ref name="imbd-Gridneff"&gt;{{IMDb name|id=0340851|name=Evegny Gridneff}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gridneff and Boucher clashed over their respective visions for the series from the outset when, on their first meeting, Gridneff told Boucher that all his scripts would have to be rewritten.&lt;ref name="Griffiths-1998"&gt;{{ cite magazine | last=Griffiths | first=Peter | date=11 February 1998 | title=Written to the Core |magazine=Doctor Who Magazine | issue=261 | pages=6–13 | issn=0957-9818 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Boucher later remarked that their "relationship started out at the bottom and worked its way down".&lt;ref name="Nazzaro-1991" /&gt;

Boucher had intended to write all ten scripts for the series himself but the tight timescale under which the episodes had to be recorded meant he could only contribute five,&lt;ref name="Nazzaro-1991" /&gt; with the rest written by John Collee (three scripts) and [[Philip Martin (screenwriter)|Philip Martin]] (two scripts). Having previously qualified and worked as a doctor, Collee was a journalist who wrote for ''[[The Observer]]'' newspaper&lt;ref name="Topping-1997" /&gt; and later moved into films, most notably writing the screenplay for ''[[Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World]]''.&lt;ref name="imbd-Collee"&gt;{{IMDb name|id=0171722|name=John Collee}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Martin was an experienced scriptwriter, best known for the controversial BBC drama series ''[[Gangsters (TV series)|Gangsters]]'', with previous experience in television science fiction, having written for ''Doctor Who''.&lt;ref name="DVD-Martin"&gt;Collinson, Gavin (Producer) (2004), "PM's Question Time – Philip Martin Discusses His Career", in ''Star Cops. The Complete Series'' (DVD), Disc 3, Network.&lt;/ref&gt; Two directors were assigned to the show: Christopher Baker, who had worked with Gridneff before on ''Hold the Back Page'' as well as BBC [[veterinarian]] dramas ''[[All Creatures Great and Small (TV series)|All Creatures Great and Small]]'' and ''[[One By One (TV series)|One by One]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|id=0048337|name=Christopher Baker}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Graeme Harper]] who had directed two ''Doctor Who'' stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|id=0363865|name=Graeme Harper}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time, most British television drama was shot on a combination of [[film format|film]] and [[videotape]]. Usually [[location shooting]] would be on film and studio work would be recorded on video. The effect of the change in medium from film to video (or vice versa) during a scene change in a programme could be jarring for some viewers. Boucher structured his scripts carefully so that all the Earth-based scenes would be shot on film on location and all the space scenes would be recorded on video in the studio hoping that the effect would give the space scenes a unique look. He was disappointed, therefore, to discover that Gridneff had decided to record the entire series on videotape.&lt;ref name="CB-Commentary-1"&gt;Commentary by Chris Boucher on "An Instinct for Murder", in ''Star Cops. The Complete Series'' (DVD), Disc 1, Network.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cast as Nathan Spring was David Calder, an experienced character actor with a reputation for "tough-guy" roles and best known at the time for his role as Detective Inspector George Resnick in the [[Lynda La Plante]] television serial ''[[Widows (TV series)|Widows]]''.&lt;ref name="McKay-1987" /&gt; Naming him Nathan after his youngest son,&lt;ref name="DVD-Makingof" /&gt; Boucher had originally written Spring as a much younger character, a high-flyer in his early thirties who had risen rapidly through the ranks of the police.&lt;ref name="Nazzaro-1991" /&gt; Despite this Boucher was pleased with Calder's performance describing Calder as "a class act" whose "performance was immaculate".&lt;ref name="DVD-Makingof" /&gt; Trevor Cooper was cast as Colin Devis at the suggestion of Graeme Harper who had worked with him on ''Doctor Who'' and in theatre.&lt;ref name="DVD-Cooper"&gt;Collinson, Gavin (Producer) (2004), "Introduction by Trevor Cooper", in ''Star Cops. The Complete Series'' (DVD), Disc 1, Network.&lt;/ref&gt; The rest of the cast, with the exception of Jonathan Adams (who had a semi-regular role on ''Bergerac''),&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|id=0011094|name=Jonathan Adams}}&lt;/ref&gt; were relatively unknown.&lt;ref name="McKay-1987" /&gt;

Given that the series was set in the relatively near future, Gridneff took great pains to ensure that the space scenes were depicted as accurately as possible, seeking advice from [[NASA]] and other space agencies as well as arranging a set visit by astronaut [[Pete Conrad]], the third man to set foot on the Moon.&lt;ref name="Black-1987" /&gt; Conrad's input proved useful in making the scenes set in [[weightlessness]] as convincing as the budget would allow.&lt;ref name="DVD-Cooper" /&gt; Assistance was also received from an [[aerospace manufacturer]], the [[McDonnell Douglas|McDonnell Douglas Corporation]], who provided stock footage of astronauts training in a water tank and received an on-screen credit on the first episode "An Instinct for Murder".&lt;ref name="Pixley-2001"&gt;{{ cite magazine | last=Pixley | first=Andrew |date=February 2001 | title=Fantasy Flashback: Star Cops – An Instinct for Murder |magazine=TV Zone | issue=135 | pages=66–69 | issn=0957-3844 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recording of the series began on 12 August 1986 with the first block of episodes—"An Instinct for Murder", "Conversations with the Dead" and "Intelligent Listening for Beginners"—directed by Christopher Baker. This was followed by a block directed by Graeme Harper comprising "Trivial Games and Paranoid Pursuits", "This Case to be Opened in a Million Years" and "In Warm Blood". Christopher Baker then returned to the director's chair for "A Double Life" and "Other People's Secrets".&lt;ref name="Pixley-1987"&gt;{{ cite magazine | last=Pixley | first=Andrew |date=Winter 1987 | title=Star Cops Episode Guide |magazine=Time Screen. the Magazine of British Telefantasy | issue=20 | pages=– | url=http://www.the-mausoleum-club.org.uk/timescreen/Trial%2010/starepg.htm | accessdate=6 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both directors had differing visions for the overall look and feel of the series, with the initial block directed by Baker favouring a pristine, brightly lit approach. This contrasted with the look preferred by Graeme Harper who drastically reduced the light levels (leaving many scenes illuminated only by computer monitor screens) and whose designer, Malcolm Thornton, dressed the sets in a messier and dingier fashion. When Baker returned for his second block of episodes, he sought to return to the brighter, cleaner look which led to some continuity problems.&lt;ref name="Followell-2006" /&gt; Meanwhile, Evgeny Gridneff and Chris Boucher's professional relationship continued to be stormy with Gridneff deciding to introduce a new Star Cop, Anna Shoun, without consulting Boucher.&lt;ref name="Pixley-2001" /&gt; The cast and crew were well aware of the behind the scenes conflicts and David Calder later recalled that there was "uncertainty as to which direction this series should go in".&lt;ref name="Followell-2006" /&gt; Chris Boucher has been frequently critical of the way in which the series was realised and has since stated that, in retrospect, he wishes he had volunteered to produce the series himself.&lt;ref name="DVD-Makingof" /&gt; In response to Boucher's criticisms, Gridneff has said, "I respect him as a writer and he's professional and, you know, it's his series and if it didn't quite go the way he thought, you know, that's unfortunate when you're dealing, you know, you're losing your baby".&lt;ref name="Followell-2006" /&gt;

The final block was to be directed by Graeme Harper and would comprise the final two episodes "Death on the Moon", written by Philip Martin, and "Information Received", written by Chris Boucher. However [[industrial action]] at the BBC affected ''Star Cops'' and many other BBC programmes leaving a backlog of programmes once the strike had ended. Forced to prioritise and despite the fact that the episode had been cast, costumes made and sets constructed, the decision was taken to drop "Death on the Moon" and bring "Information Received", now titled "Little Green Men and Other Martians", forward. The three-day recording block for this episode began on 16 February 1987 just two days after recording of episode 8 had finished. Recording was further complicated when Erick Ray Evans fell ill and his lines had to split amongst the rest of the cast at the last minute with most of Theroux's dialogue going to Pal Kenzy. Production on ''Star Cops'' finally wrapped on 18 February 1987.&lt;ref name="Houldsworth_1991"&gt;{{ cite magazine | last=Houldsworth | first=Richard |date=May 1991 | title=Fantasy Flashback: Star Cops – Little Green Men and Other Martians |magazine=TV Zone | issue=18 | pages=24–27 | issn=0957-3844 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theme song for the series, titled "It Won't be Easy", was written and performed by [[Justin Hayward]], the lead vocalist with the [[Moody Blues]]. The theme was produced by record producer [[Tony Visconti]] who also composed, with Hayward, the [[incidental music]] for every episode.&lt;ref name="Topping-1997" /&gt; Gridneff hoped that the theme would act as a gentle method of enticing casual viewers into the series.&lt;ref name="Followell-2006" /&gt; Reaction to the music and Hayward's song in particular, has generally been negative. ''[[SFX magazine|SFX]]'' magazine, in particular, has been highly critical of the theme tune: in one issue it was placed twenty-ninth in a list article titled "The 50 Worst Things About SF Ever!"&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |last=Golder |first=Dave (editor) |date=October 1998 |title=The 50 Worst Things About SF Ever! |journal=SFX |issue=43 |pages=78–89 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while in another it was placed sixth in a list article titled "The 10 Worst Things About UK Telefantasy".&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |last=Bradley |first=Dave (editor) |year=2005 |title=The 10 Worst Things About UK Telefantasy |journal=SFX Collection |issue=22 |page=130 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Writer and critic [[Kim Newman]] has described the theme as the "worst single theme tune of any TV show ever".&lt;ref name="Followell-2006" /&gt; Chris Boucher has said that he "hated the music. The incidental music wasn't appropriate and it didn't have the style and feeling it should have had".&lt;ref name="Nazzaro-1991" /&gt;

=== Transmission and viewer reaction ===

''Star Cops'' was broadcast on Monday nights at around 8:30pm starting on 6 July 1987 on BBC2.&lt;ref name="Pixley-1987" /&gt; Competition was provided on [[BBC One]] by sitcom ''[[Terry and June]]'' and ''[[BBC Nine O'Clock News|The Nine O'Clock News]]''.&lt;ref name="Topping-1997" /&gt; The fifth episode, "This Case to be Opened in a Million Years", was broadcast at the later time of 9.55pm.&lt;ref name="Pixley-1987" /&gt; The BBC [[listings magazine]] ''[[Radio Times]]'' promoted the series, giving it the front cover of the 4–10 July 1987 edition accompanied by a four-page article by Johnny Black inside.&lt;ref name="Black-1987" /&gt; ''Star Cops'' performed poorly in the ratings with an average audience across the series of only 2.2&amp;nbsp;million viewers.&lt;ref name="Ratings"&gt;"Continuity and Miscellanea", in ''Star Cops. The Complete Series'' (DVD), Disc 1, 2 and 3, Network.&lt;/ref&gt; Chris Boucher has blamed the poor ratings on the timeslot the show was given, stating: "There is nothing that has ever gone out on BBC 2 at half-past eight until twenty-past nine; it's a grotesque period. It doesn't synch with anything on BBC 1; it just doesn't work in relation to anything. You had to badly want to see ''Star Cops'' in order to watch it because you had to sacrifice at least two hours of viewing to see it. I can see why people didn't want to have that problem.".&lt;ref name="Nazzaro-1991" /&gt; He has also commented that the poor timeslot and the decision to air the series in July and August (a time when viewing figures are traditionally lower due to the summer) reflected the fact that ''Star Cops'' didn't have the confidence of the BBC management.&lt;ref name="CB-Commentary-1" /&gt; This view is echoed by star David Calder who has described the timeslot as "an act of sabotage and absurdity".&lt;ref name="Followell-2006" /&gt;

Critical reaction to the show was generally negative: writing in ''[[The Times]]'' following the broadcast of "Conversations with the Dead", Andrew Hislop wrote that "''Star Cops'' has neither the campiness of ''[[Star Trek]]'' nor the imagination of ''Dr. Who'' to overcome its technological limitations".&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | first=Andrew | last=Hislop | title=Arts (Television): Longing for lift-off | work=The Times | publisher=News Corp. | date=14 July 1987 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in ''The Times'', reviewing "Intelligent Listening for Beginners", Martin Cropper found that "some of the individual plot-lines show invention of a sort, but the script is uniformly feeble".&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | first=Martin | last=Cropper | title=Arts (Television): Floppy future | work=The Times | publisher=News Corp. | date=21 July 1987 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, in ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'', [[Patrick Stoddart]] was confused by the plot of "This Case to be Opened in a Million Years" asking readers "if you are following any of this, please write to me and explain".&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | first=Patrick | last=Stoddart | title=Cariani up the canal – TV Review | work=The Sunday Times | publisher=News Corp. | date=9 August 1987 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Letter writers to the ''Radio Times'' were split on the merits of the show: some such as P. Tricker of [[Alpheton]], [[Suffolk]] praising it for having "brilliant special effects, well-written scripts and actors who were convincing" while others like Martin Bower of [[Allendale, Northumberland|Allendale]], [[Northumberland]] slated the "dated designs, poor music [and] cheap sets" and P. Curwen of [[Balloch, West Dunbartonshire|Balloch]], [[Dunbartonshire]] described it as "boring – too much talk and not enough action".&lt;ref name="RT-Letters"&gt;{{ cite magazine | title=You Write: sci-fi makes a comeback | magazine=Radio Times | publisher=BBC | date=15–21 August 1987 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Science fiction fandom]] at the time was more positive with Anthony McKay in ''Time Screen'' describing the series as "one of the most refreshing telefantasy series for years"&lt;ref name="McKay-1987" /&gt; while the [[British Science Fiction Association]] gave the show their [[BSFA award|Media Award]] in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://www.bsfa.co.uk/index.cfm/section.awrdlist | title = BSFA: Previous winners of the BSFA awards | accessdate = 13 October 2006 | work=Official Website of the British Science Fiction Association }}&lt;/ref&gt;
''[[The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction]]'' stated "the low-key realism of the show was efficient enough" but argued, in
the end, that ''Star Cops'' "failed to imagine the future with any real vividness or depth".&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction'', edited by [[John Clute]] and [[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Peter Nicholls]] ,
Orbit Books, 1993, {{ISBN|1857231244}} (pgs. 1153).&lt;/ref&gt; 
The low ratings doomed the show to a single season and, although admired, it has never developed a significant following among science fiction aficionados. Boucher has stated that, in retrospect, he feels that the series was too outlandish for crime drama fans and not outlandish enough for science fiction fans and that ultimately it appealed to neither.&lt;ref name="Followell-2006" /&gt;

=== Proposals for a second season ===

When recording was completed, Gridneff asked Boucher if he had any ideas for a further season of ''Star Cops''.&lt;ref name="Anorak-Articles"&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.anorakzone.com/starcops/articles.html | title=Star Cops Articles | accessdate=5 October 2006 | author="The Anorak" | work=The Anorak's Guide to Star Cops }}&lt;/ref&gt; Boucher felt that were the series to continue he would like to extend the setting further out into the Solar System, visiting the [[colonisation of Mars|Mars colonies]] and the [[space habitat|Big Ring space colonies]] under construction.&lt;ref name="Anorak-Boucher"&gt;{{ cite web |url=http://www.anorakzone.com/starcops/interview.html | title=Chris Boucher Interview | accessdate=5 October 2006 | author="The Anorak" | work=The Anorak's Guide to Star Cops }}&lt;/ref&gt; He intended to achieve this either by transferring one of the existing regular characters to the Mars colony or by introducing a new regular who would be based there.&lt;ref name="Anorak-Boucher" /&gt; The second season was never developed beyond these few basic notions as it was clear to Boucher from an early stage that there was little prospect of the series being renewed.&lt;ref name="Anorak-Articles" /&gt; Following ''Star Cops'', Boucher went on to work as script editor on the long-running [[ITV Network|ITV]] police drama ''[[The Bill]]'' before returning to freelance writing&lt;ref name="imbd-Boucher" /&gt; while Gridneff moved on to work on the BBC drama series ''[[The House of Eliott]]''.&lt;ref name="imbd-Gridneff" /&gt;

== Legacy ==

The demise of ''Star Cops'' after just nine episodes has been seen as indicative of the decline of British television science fiction in the 1980s and, after ''Doctor Who'' followed ''Star Cops'' into cancellation in 1989, there would be no British regular science fiction drama series on British television until ''[[Bugs (TV series)|Bugs]]'' began in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | last = Wright | first = Peter | editor = in Seed, David (ed.) | title = A Companion to Science Fiction | year = 2005 | publisher=Blackwell | location = London | isbn = 1-4051-1218-2 | pages = 289–306 | chapter = British Science Fiction }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''Star Cops'' has undergone something of a reappraisal – in science fiction circles at least – since it went off the air in 1987. Reviewing the VHS releases for ''[[TV Zone]]'' in 1991, [[Gary Russell]] stated that "''Star Cops'' represents ''excellent'' science fiction" and recanted his original impression of the series upon broadcast that it was "''Bergerac'' in spacesuits, complete with rather cruddy visual effects and boring performances".&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite magazine | last=Russell | first=Gary | authorlink=Gary Russell |date=July 1991 | title=Reviews: Star Cops Tapes One, Two, Three |magazine=TV Zone | issue=20 |page=18 | issn=0957-3844 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A retrospective article penned by [[Keith Topping]] for ''[[Dreamwatch]]'' to mark the series' 10th anniversary in 1997 described ''Star Cops'' as "a series that could (and should) have been one of the BBC's most popular, influential and entertaining products of the era. On at least one of these points the series failed miserably, but, certainly when it came to entertainment, it succeeded magnificently".&lt;ref name="Topping-1997" /&gt; In 1999, when science fiction magazine ''SFX'' asked an expert panel from the SF field, including [[Terry Pratchett]] and [[Stephen Baxter (author)|Stephen Baxter]], to compile a list of the top 50 SF shows of all time, ''Star Cops'' came thirteenth on the list, with ''SFX'' describing it as "the SF TV show SF writers love. It wasn't perfect but it's as close as TV will ever get to producing proper written SF".&lt;ref name="SFX#50" /&gt; Later, in 2005, ''SFX'' went on to poll its readers for their list of the top 50 British telefantasy shows and ''Star Cops'' was voted into twenty-seventh position on the list.&lt;ref name="SFXSpecial#22"&gt;{{ cite journal | last=Bradley | first=Dave (editor) | year=2005 | title=The Top 50 Greatest UK Telefantasy Shows Ever | journal=SFX Collection | issue=22 |page=21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC themselves revisited ''Star Cops'' in a thirty-minute retrospective documentary about the show, recorded as part of a series titled ''The Cult of...'', first broadcast on [[BBC Four]] on 28 November 2006 as part of that channel's ''Science Fiction Britannia'' season. Reflecting on the show in the programme, the author and critic Kim Newman said that "the strength of ''Star Cops'' is the writing. I don't think any of the episodes are realised as well on screen as they are on the page. [...] If it had come back for another couple of seasons it might well have been the BBC's best science fiction show". The documentary concluded that ''Star Cops'' was an "overlooked gem".&lt;ref name="Followell-2006" /&gt;

=== Audio series ===

On 9 November 2017, [[Big Finish Productions]] announced they would be releasing a new series of Star Cops stories as audio plays,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Star Cops relaunches! |date=9 November 2017 |work=Big Finish |url=https://www.bigfinish.com/news/v/star-cops-relaunches |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171110114325/https://www.bigfinish.com/news/v/star-cops-relaunches |archivedate=10 November 2017 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; with surviving original cast members David Calder, Trevor Cooper and Linda Newton reprising their roles as Nathan Spring, Colin Devis and Pal Kenzy respectively.

== Merchandising ==

A very small amount of merchandising has been produced for ''Star Cops''. To coincide with the broadcast of the series in 1987, [[BBC Worldwide|BBC Enterprises]] released Justin Hayward's theme song "It Won't Be Easy" as a [[gramophone record|7-inch and 12-inch single]]. The 7-inch included the track "Outer Space" by Hayward and Tony Visconti, which was one of the incidental music tracks written for "An Instinct for Murder",&lt;ref name="Pixley-2001" /&gt; on the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]]. The 12-inch had an extended version of "It Won't Be Easy" on the [[A-side and B-side|A-Side]] and the 7-inch version of "It Won't Be Easy" and "Outer Space" on the B-Side. "It Won't Be Easy" was later released on compact disc as part of the compilation ''The Best of BBC TV's Themes''.&lt;ref name="Merchandise"&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.geocities.com/thestarcopssite/Web/Others/Merchandise.html | title=The Star Cops Website Merchandise Guide | accessdate=5 October 2006 | work=The Star Cops Site |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/thestarcopssite/Web/Others/Merchandise.html&amp;date=2009-10-25+23:02:38|archivedate=26 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The entire series was released by BBC Video in three volumes, each containing three episodes, on VHS [[video tape]] in 1991. Some purchasers of the VHS tapes also received embroidered ISPF and Moonbase patches made by Stewart Aviation, which were also available separately.&lt;ref name="Merchandise" /&gt;

Chris Boucher's five ''Star Cops'' scripts have been semi-professionally published in two volumes by Judith Proctor. The first volume ''An Instinct for Murder'' was adapted from the first ''Star Cops'' episode of the same name. The second volume ''Little Green Men and Other Stories'' included the four remaining Boucher scripts. There are some changes from the broadcast episodes – neither the characters of Alexander Krivenko nor Anna Shoun appear in these books. Krivenko is replaced by a Chinese character, Jiang Li Ho, as an attempt to update the ''Star Cops'' universe to reflect the ending of the [[Cold War]] in 1989. Shoun is replaced by an Irish character, Dana Cogill – Boucher didn't own the rights to use the Shoun character who had been created by John Collee.&lt;ref name="Anorak-Novels"&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.anorakzone.com/starcops/starcopsnovels.html | title=Star Cops Novels | accessdate=5 October 2006 | author="The Anorak" | work=The Anorak's Guide to Star Cops }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The complete series was released on DVD by Network Video in a single, three-disc volume in 2004. This release contained a number of extras including commentaries by Chris Boucher on "An Instinct for Murder" and "Little Green Men and Other Martians" and by Philip Martin on "This Case to be Opened in a Million Years" as well as a making of documentary, interviews with Chris Boucher, Philip Martin and Trevor Cooper and behind the scenes footage.&lt;ref&gt;''Star Cops.

[[File:Ekaterina Vilkova and Igor Voynarovsky.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Shooting a scene for the 2008 Russian film ''[[Stilyagi (2008 film)|Stilyagi]]]]

'''Stilyagi''' ({{lang-rus|стиляги|p=sʲtʲɪˈlʲæɡʲɪ}}, {{literally}} "stylish, style hunters") were members of a youth [[counterculture]] from the late 1940s until the early 1960s in the [[Soviet Union]].  A '''stilyaga''' ({{lang-rus|стиляга|p=sʲtʲɪˈlʲaɡə}}), was primarily distinguished by snappy clothing—preferably foreign-label, acquired from ''[[fartsovshchik]]s''—that contrasted with the communist realities of the time, and their fascination with ''[[zagranitsa]]'', modern Western music and fashions corresponding to that of the [[Beat Generation]]. English writings on Soviet culture variously translated the derogatory term as "[[dandy|dandies]]", "[[wikt:fashionista|fashionista]]s", "[[beatnik]]s", "[[Hipster (1940s subculture)|hipsters]]", "[[zoot suit]]ers", etc.

Today, the stilyagi phenomenon is regarded as one of the Russian historical social trends which further developed during the late Soviet era (notably the [[Brezhnev stagnation|Stagnation Period]]) and allowed "informal" views on life, such as [[hippie]]s, [[punk subculture|punk]]s and [[Rapping|rappers]].

==Characteristics==
Their [[apolitical]] views, neutral or negative attitudes toward Soviet [[morality]], and their open admiration of modern, especially American, lifestyles were key characteristics that slowly developed during the 1950s.

At the dawn of the [[phenomenon]], the stilyagi look was rather a caricature, inspired by movies from abroad of recent years. It resembled the [[zoot suit]] but combined different bright colors. By the late fifties, the look had evolved into something more elegant and stylish. Typical stilyagi wear included narrow pants, long jackets, narrow ties, bright-colored shirts, and thick soled shoes.

Usually stilyagi enjoyed popular American music of the 1940s, especially [[swing music|swing]] and [[boogie-woogie]], especially the music of [[Glenn Miller]], [[Benny Goodman]] and the soundtrack from the film ''[[Sun Valley Serenade]]''. The "serenade" instantly became a cult among stilyagi, and one of its songs, the famous "[[Chattanooga Choo Choo]]", served as their unofficial anthem. Stilyagi developed their own styles of dance originating from [[boogie-woogie (dance)|boogie-woogie]] and later also adopted [[rock-n-roll]].

==History and legacy==
[[File:Rock on Bones2.jpg|thumb|300px|"Rock on the bones"]]
The first stilyagi were from the generation of young adults in their early twenties who had lived through the hard times of [[Great Depression|economic crisis]] and [[World War II]], leaving them perturbed about the future of their lives. Many of the young men returning from the army were heavily influenced by the contact with the foreign countries and modern [[Fads and trends|trends]] at the time. As a result, many of them wore clothes based on images from abroad (early 1940s [[romance film]]s, daily newspapers and photographs) and young women later adopted styles from modern female stereotypes too.

The main cause of this phenomenon was the struggle between [[capitalism]] and [[communism]]-led societies. The enforced uniformity of the Soviet thought and the heavy weight of its [[dictatorship]] were the only politically correct form of view, lifestyle and [[emotional expression|self-expression]] permitted during [[Stalinism]]. Therefore, the stilyagi sought to follow the modern ideology and morality in order to avoid Soviet pressure and its influence on society.

The stilyagi were largely repressed until [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]'s death in 1953, which let the style grow into a [[counterculture]]. By 1955, the stilyagi had acquired both respect and contempt from many layers of society (especially the then emerging Soviet [[upper-middle class]], known as "[[intelligentsia]]") and were frowned upon in political instances, but had grown too many in number to be repressed. Thus, instead of trying to get rid of them, the media and politics, including journalism, eagerly mocked their style by portraying them as ridiculous as opposed to "normal" parts of Soviet society.

In the mid-1950s, many people were arrested for making musical recordings on [[Ribs (recordings)|"bones"]] (developed [[X-ray]] films).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jazz on Bones: X-Ray Sound Recordings|url=http://www.kk.org/streetuse/archives/2006/08/jazz_on_bones_xray_sound_recor_1.php|publisher=kk.org|accessdate=29 December 2010|date=August 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Jazz-Rock Counterculture is Born|url=http://www.powerhat.com/tusovka/tus.ch1.html#howyoung-records |work=The Historical Political Development of Soviet Rock Music|accessdate=29 December 2010|author=Tracy Donovan Drake |archiveurl = https://swap.stanford.edu/20090621074303/http%3A//www%2Epowerhat%2Ecom/tusovka/tus%2Ech1%2Ehtml |archivedate = June 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Those found guilty of manufacturing and distributing such recordings received from three to five years of imprisonment in [[labour camp]]s for [[profiteering (business)|profiteering]].

In the late 1950s, the catchphrase "Today he dances jazz, but tomorrow [he] will sell [his] homeland" (Сегодня он танцует джаз, а завтра Родину продаст), became the stilyagi's signature and the key idea underlying their social protest. Stilyagi were recognized as an official musical, artistic and pop culture movement that later took on further modern influences, notably [[rockabilly]], [[rock-n-roll]] and [[pop rock]] musical genres.

Following the [[6th World Festival of Youth and Students|international festival of 1957]], however, the USSR became more open to modern culture. The official ban on jazz music was removed, and many records became available in stores from the 1960s. Admiration of modern music, especially the rock-n-roll wave of the sixties, met more tolerance from official ideology and little active resistance. All this contributed to the decline of the movement in the early sixties, as former stilyagi abandoned the lifestyles of their youth, while the next generation felt no need to follow such a lifestyle in order to enjoy modern culture or a nonpolitical way of life.

The influence of the stilyagi movement on Soviet-Russian culture is tremendous. Many of today's most respected Russian musicians, writers, film editors and other cultural personalities belonged to the movement, or shared its free, bohemian lifestyle. There is a 2008 Russian comedy musical film, ''[[Stilyagi (film)|Stilyagi]]'', about this subculture.

'''''Le Diable et les Dix Commandements''''' ({{lang-en|The Devil and the Ten Commandments}}), is a French comedy-drama film from 1963, directed by [[Julien Duvivier]], written by [[David Alexander (writer)|David Alexander]] and [[Michel Audiard]], starring [[Michel Simon]] and [[Louis de Funès]] (uncredited). The cast list includes several famous French actors: Simon, de Funès, [[Fernandel]], [[Danielle Darrieux]], [[Lino Ventura]], [[Jean-Claude Brialy]], [[Charles Aznavour]] and a very young [[Alain Delon]].

According to [[Bosley Crowther]] only one from seven episodes tickled him, in which play Louis de Funes and [[Jean-Claude Brialy]].&lt;ref name = NYTimes&gt;{{Cite journal | author = [[Bosley Crowther]] | url = https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9406E0D81638E23ABC4D52DFB6678388679EDE | title = Le Diable et les Dix Commandements | journal = [[The New York Times]] | date = October 15, 1963}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film offers a perspective on sin and salvation. A snake proclaims – voice of [[Claude Rich]] – that it is our old friend, the Devil.&lt;ref name = NYTimes/&gt;

== Plot ==
The film consists of seven roughly 15 minute episodes, each showing what will happen if one or more of the Ten Commandments will be broken. The episodes are either mini-dramas. The version available in Germany and Japan has eight episodes.

In the first episode Jérome Chambard is warned that he will lose his job if he continues to swear.

In second episode Françoise Beaufort enamored of a stripper calls on her only to find her married to a janitor who doesn't know what kind of dancing his wife performs.

In the third episode Denis, a Jesuit novice, leaves the order to avenge his sister's suicide, which was provoked by Garigny, who seduced her into prostitution and drug addiction.

In the fourth episode Philip buys a necklace for Micheline though he is bored with her. Fernandel (horse-faced) declares that he is God.

In the fifth episode a young man find out that his real mother is not Madeleine, but actress Clarisse Ardant.

In the sixth episode Didier Marin, cashier of a bank, was fired by his boss.

In the seventh episode the Devil appears as a serpent for Jérome Chambard and the bishop are eating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=s1k1RsGvFwwC&amp;pg=PA251&amp;lpg=PA251&amp;dq= | title = The American Film Institute Catalog of Motion Pictures Produced in the United States | volume = Part 2 | publisher = [[University of California Press]] | year = 1997 | page = 251 | isbn = 0-520-20970-2}} &lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Thirty-Five Confession Buddhas''' ({{bo|w=gsheg lha so lnga}})  are known from the ''Sutra of the Three Heaps'' (Sanskrit: ''Triskandhadharmasutra''; Tib. ''phung po gsum pa'i mdo''), popular in [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. This [[Mahāyāna]] sutra actually describes the practice of purification by confession and making prostrations to these Buddhas, and is part of the larger ''Stack of Jewels Sutra'' (Sanskrit: ''Ratnakutasutra''; Tib. ''dkon mchog brtsegs pa'i mdo'').

In Tibet there were two distinct traditions of the Thirty-five Confession Buddhas which arose  from the two main Indian schools of [[Mahāyāna Buddhism]]: one from the  [[Madhyamaka]] school founded by [[Nagarjuna|Nāgārjuna]], and the other from the [[Yogachara|Yogācāra]] school founded by [[Asanga|Asaṅga]] and [[Vasubandhu]]. Both of these schools developed their own rituals for conferring the Bodhisattva vows, each incorporating a visualization of the Thirty-five Buddhas along with the recitation of the confession from the Triskhandhadharma Sutra.&lt;ref name="HimalayanArt1"&gt;{{cite web

==Iconography==
The Thirty-Five Confession Buddhas are a common subject depicted in [[Himalayan Buddhism|Himalayan Buddhist]] paintings and sculpture. There are at least three different iconographic systems for depicting the Thirty-Five Buddhas, based on the different descriptions found in ritual texts  and commentaries by different authors including Nagarjuna,{{refn|group=nb|Probably not the Nagarjuna who founded the Madhyamaka school but a later teacher with the same name}} [[Sakya Pandita|Sakya Paṇḍita]], [[Taranatha|Jonang Tāranātha]]  and [[Je Tsongkhapa]].

The three main iconographic traditions are: 1. The system attributed to Nagarjuna where the 35 Buddhas are depicted with different objects in their hands, 2. The system of Sakya Paṇḍita where the 35 Buddhas are depicted with hand gestures only (no hand objects), and 3. The system based on Je Tsongkhapa's personal vision of the 35 Buddhas where only some of the Buddhas have objects in their hands.&lt;ref name="HimalayanArt1" /&gt;

'''UnFrame''' collective is an independent resource of documentary photography exclusively managed by an international group of photographers dedicated to shining the spotlight on social, political and everyday issues that surround us. The collective was founded in February 2013 with the aim of developing and working on both long term social and political issues with a deeper perspective in addition to responding to news events as they happen anywhere in the world.

== Documented events ==
In 2013, during the first year of its activity, events documented were:

* The [[Rana Plaza]] building collapse in [[Dhaka]], [[Bangladesh]].
* The [[2013 protests in Turkey]].
* The consequences on civilians of the troubled political season in [[Bangladesh]].
* The [[Ukraine]] political crisis, the Kiev revolution ([[Euromaidan]]) and the Russian occupation of Crimea.

== Issues ==
The photographers have organized a collective archive of long term issues. Amongst others are the following:

[[File:Malian_wedding_celebration_.jpg|thumb|A wedding in Mali]]
'''Weddings in Mali''' involve various important customs and celebrations spread out through a number of days. Usually, the groom and the bride do not personally know the attendees that come to the wedding festivity, because
Malian families tend to be very big due to [[polygamy]]. Therefore, most of the time it is very hard for one to know every member of his or her extended family. Thus [[weddings]] are a perfect occasion for all the extended family members of the couple to come for the big day. Wedding ceremonies in Bamako are a time when the community comes together to support the bride and groom's family. During this time food is given, and family from the village come to say goodbye to the bride-to-be and celebrate with the family.

== Pre-wedding henna==
Before the actual wedding takes place there is a pre-wedding [[henna]] ceremony only for women. Where local henna designers apply henna for the bride, and the other women present at the ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hill|first1=Erin|title=Mali's henna,shea butter,'hiplaces' enhance women's beauty|url=http://www.shfwire.com/malis-henna-shea-butter-hiplaces-enhance-womens-beauty/|website=shfwire.com|accessdate=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The three forms of marriage in Mali==

=== Religious marriage===
* This form of marriage is very common for the [[Islam]] religion. Usually taking place in a mosque. In Islam weddings both the groom and bride have to give their consent to get wedded to each other willingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schreiber|first1=Shannon|last2=McLaughlin|first2=Sheila|title=Mali Wedding beads|url=http://www.thebead.net/index.php/bead-blog-rss/183-mali-wedding-beads|website=the bead.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the wedding ceremony [[Kola nut|cola nuts]] are distributed amongst the women's family to symbolize the engagement for the couple, to inform her family members of the initial engagement. During this ceremony both the men and women remain separate from each other, while an [[imam]] officiates the marriage. Since about 90 percent of Malians are Muslim, the religious marriage is considered as the most important form.

=== Civil marriage===
* [[Civil marriage]] is the nonreligious, legal wedding ceremony that generally takes place at the courthouse with the presence of a legal official (judge, magistrate, mayor).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hochbein|first1=Kelly|title=THE CHANGING FACE OF MARRIAGE IN MALI|url=http://www1.lehigh.edu/news/changing-face-marriage-mali|website=lehigh|accessdate=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Traditional marriage===
* [[Marriage|Traditional marriage]] varies greatly from region to region and differs greatly between different [[ethnic groups]]. Traditional weddings usually last for a couple of days, which are typically lead by an imam. Traditional marriages are a way to celebrate the newlyweds and a way for families to express their joys of the day.
* Throughout the wedding festivities the newlyweds family and guests, sing, dance, and play traditional music outdoors until late at night. This celebration usually takes place in front of the family house of the groom and the bride.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://observers.france24.com/en/20120823-northern-mali-islamists-encourage-getting-marriage-without-music-dancing-singing-wedding-gao-timbuktu-couple|title=In northern Mali, Islamists strongly encourage getting married – but without music or dancing|date=23 August 2012|editor-last=Bruguière|website=observers.france24.com|publisher=Peggy Bruguière|others=|ref=Web|last1=Bruguière|first1=Peggy|accessdate=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where everyone sits in a circle under a tent while being entertained by the Djembefola and [[Griot|Djeli]] (Traditional artists) who sing and praise the families in their ethnic languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bucknell.edu/Documents/GriotInstitute/What%20is%20a%20Griot.pdf|title=What is a Griot|date=|website=bucknell.edu|publisher=Thomas A.

== Malian wedding attire and jewelry==

=== Attire===
The main wedding attire in Mali is called bazin, (sometimes referred to as [[Boubou (clothing)|boubou]] for men). This fabric is hand dyed polished cotton, which is popularly characterized by its shine. There are two types of bazin/boubou: rich and basic, which are formal and informal. The bazin/boubou rich is the most expensive fabric that is usually reserved for greater occasions which are typically worn formally. While the basic bazin/boubou is worn every day on a more informal basis.  The bazin/boubou is worn to many different occasions such as during the two main Islamic celebrations [[Muslim holidays|Eid]], in funerals, weddings, and on [[Jumu'ah|Friday prayers]] to the mosque. It is well known for its decorative fundamental embroidery that stands out for its elegant designs.
They generally come in many different designs, which is embroidered by a tailor using either a pedal driven or electric sewing machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ighobor|first1=Kingsley|last2=Haidara|first2=Aissata|title=Malian women create beauty and profit through local fabrics|url=http://www.biyokulule.com/view_content.php?articleid=4636|website=Biyokulule}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bazin/boubous are sewed differently for men and women. Whereas the men boubou consists of three different pieces of clothing that are the same color. A tie up trouser, a long sleeve chemise, and a wide open- embroidered sleeveless gown that is worn over everything. While for women even though their bazin is sewn in a three piece, it comes with a wrapper that is typically tied around the waist, a blouse, and a headscarf.

The bride is expected to wear the best quality of bazin rich designed just for her for the traditional and religious wedding, and for the civil wedding, she dresses in a white modern gown. While the groom dresses in white boubou for the traditional and religious wedding and wears a suit for the civil wedding.

=== Jewelry===
Malian women take a lot of pride in their jewelry especially when they are going to weddings.  To go with their expensive embroidered bazin outfits they wear gold necklaces, bracelets, and earrings.  This is because gold symbolizes wealth, money, and prestige between Malian women. Such that women see weddings as the perfect occasion to dress up and wear their most expensive gold jewelry to go and celebrate the union of the new couple. Where the Djeli's&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=James|first1=John|title=THE GRIOTS OF WEST AFRICA – MUCH MORE THAN STORY-TELLERS|url=http://www.goethe.de/ins/za/prj/wom/osm/en9606618.htm|website=Gothe institut|accessdate=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; sing to them, in such a way that they are praising them for their beauty and respectful family name, in which the women [[urbandict:front|front]] and give money out to the [[Griot|Djeli's]].
