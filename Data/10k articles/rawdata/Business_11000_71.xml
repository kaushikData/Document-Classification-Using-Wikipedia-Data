The Ahsani family control [[shell company|shell companies]] in the tax havens of the [[Channel Islands]], the [[Marshall Islands]], and the [[British Virgin Islands]], through which Unaoil's business is conducted. In March 2016 ''[[The Age]]'' described Unaoil as "the unseen intermediary in massive deals between the world's biggest energy companies and notoriously corrupt governments in the Middle East, Eastern Europe and Africa."&lt;ref name=MelAgeWho/&gt; The family’s portfolio of real estate includes German nursing homes, and properties in multiple countries.&lt;ref name=MelAgeWho/&gt;

==Family members==

==Description==
Hundreds of thousands of emails sent within Unaoil and between members of the Ahsani family from 2001 to 2012 were leaked to investigative journalists and formed the basis for a series of stories in [[Fairfax Media]]'s ''[[The Age]]'' newspaper and the ''[[Huffington Post]]'' in March 2016. ''The Age'' described Cyrus as "...in charge of day to day operations, though he often defers to his father for big decisions and important interactions" and described his character as "intelligent and good humoured: a man who inspires loyalty".&lt;ref name=MelAgeWho/&gt;

The '''Ambassador Theatre''' is a [[Broadway theatre]] located at 219 West [[49th Street (Manhattan)|49th Street]] between [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] and [[Eighth Avenue (Manhattan)|8th Avenue]] in [[Midtown Manhattan]].

Designed by architect [[Herbert J. Krapp]] for the [[The Shubert Organization|Shuberts]], the structure is noteworthy in that it is situated diagonally on its site to fit the maximum number of seats possible. Its external appearance, indistinguishable from many other Broadway houses, does not hint at the unusual layout within. The building has been designated a [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission|New York City landmark]]. The theatre's proscenium opening is {{convert|44|ft|11|in|m}} with a [[Fly system#Grid deck|grid height]] of {{Convert|54|ft|9|in|m}}.

The theatre opened on February 11, 1921, with the [[musical theatre|musical]] ''The Rose Girl''. The Shuberts sold the property in 1935, and for the next two decades it was used as a movie theater and television studio for [[NBC]] and later the [[DuMont Television Network]], when it was known as the Ambassador Tele-Theatre. In 1956, the Shuberts assumed ownership again and returned it to strictly legitimate use.

==Biography==
Amina was born in Bungoma in the west of Kenya, where her mother, Sarah Hersi Ali, is a prominent businesswoman. Adam Hersi Ali, her uncle, who was another inspirational pillar in Amina's life, served as a Financial Secretary of Treasury in the Kenya's [[Finance minister|Ministry of Finance]] in the late 1980s. As a young girl, Moghe and her sister regularly joined their family in the cross border trade between Kenya and Uganda.The two girls were sent to [[Accountancy|accounting]] school by their mother, where they built on their entrepreneurial skills. Having a strong entrepreneurial mother led her to be business savvy not afraid of making big business risks. Her biggest risk was closing her successful hardware store in Bungoma Kenya and venturing in a start up business in Uganda after the stabilisation of the country in 1996. With no foundation set for her she used the skills she was taught to set up a hardware store in the bustling city of Kampala Uganda. This stride into the unknown was the first step of the enterprising woman she is today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|

Moghe quickly adapted to her new environment and acted as a convenient link on the ground for her family's commercial trade. She began expanding the family business and entered the real estate sector. Moghe would eventually become one of the [[List of wealthiest people in Uganda|wealthiest people in Uganda]] and come to own the Oasis Centre, a multimillion-dollar shopping mall complex and grand scale luxurious apartment Laburnam Courts that are both situated in the center of the capital.

'''Bioequivalence''' is a term  in [[pharmacokinetics]] used to assess the expected [[in vivo]] biological equivalence of two proprietary preparations of a drug. If two products are said to be bioequivalent it means that they would be expected to be, for all intents and purposes, the same.

Birkett (2003) defined bioequivalence by stating that, "two pharmaceutical products are bioequivalent if they are pharmaceutically equivalent and their [[bioavailability|bioavailabilities]] (rate and extent of availability) after administration in the same molar dose are similar to such a degree that their effects, with respect to both efficacy and safety, can be expected to be essentially the same. Pharmaceutical equivalence implies the same amount of the same active substance(s), in the same dosage form, for the same route of administration and meeting the same or comparable standards."&lt;ref name="Birkett_2003"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Birkett DJ | title=Generics - equal or not? | journal = Aust Prescr | year = 2003 | volume = 26 | pages = 85–7 | url = http://www.australianprescriber.com/magazine/26/4/article/712.pdf | doi=10.18773/austprescr.2003.063}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[World_Health_Organization|The World Health Organization]] [http://www.who.int (WHO)] "two pharmaceutical products are bioequivalent if they are pharmaceutically equivalent or pharmaceutical alternatives, and their bioavailabilities, in terms of rate (Cmax and tmax) and extent of absorption (area under the curve), after administration of the same molar dose under the same conditions, are similar to such a degree that their effects can be expected to be essentially the same" &lt;ref&gt;WHO Guidance for organizations performing in vivo bioequivalence studies. WHO Technical Report Series No. 996, 2016, Annex 9&lt;/ref&gt;.

The [[United States]] [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) has defined bioequivalence as, "the absence of a significant difference in the rate and extent to which the active ingredient or active moiety in pharmaceutical equivalents or pharmaceutical alternatives becomes available at the site of drug action when administered at the same molar dose under similar conditions in an appropriately designed study."&lt;ref name="url_www.fda.gov"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/HowDrugsareDevelopedandApproved/ApprovalApplications/AbbreviatedNewDrugApplicationANDAGenerics/UCM154838.pdf | title = Guidance for Industry: Bioavailability and Bioequivalence Studies for Orally Administered Drug Products — General Considerations | author = Center for Drug Evaluation and Research | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2003 | format = | work = | publisher = United States Food and Drug Administration | pages = | language = | quote = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bioequivalence  ==
In determining bioequivalence, for example, between two products such as a commercially available Brand product and a potential to-be-marketed Generic product, pharmacokinetic studies are conducted whereby each of the preparations are administered in a cross-over study to volunteer subjects, generally healthy individuals but occasionally in patients. Serum/plasma samples are obtained at regular intervals and assayed for parent drug (or occasionally metabolite) concentration. Occasionally, blood concentration levels are neither feasible or possible to compare the two products (e.g. inhaled corticosteroids), then pharmacodynamic endpoints rather than pharmacokinetic endpoints (see below) are used for comparison. For a pharmacokinetic comparison, the plasma concentration data are used to assess key pharmacokinetic parameters such as area under the curve (AUC), peak concentration (''C''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;), time to peak concentration (''T''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;), and absorption lag time (''t''&lt;sub&gt;lag&lt;/sub&gt;). Testing should be conducted at several different doses, especially when the drug displays non-linear pharmacokinetics.

In addition to data from bioequivalence studies, other data may need to be submitted to meet regulatory requirements for bioequivalence. Such evidence may include:

* analytical method validation
* ''in vitro-in vivo'' correlation studies ([[IVIVC]])

== Regulatory definition ==

=== The World Health Organization ===

The World Health Organization considers two formulation bioequivalent if the 90% confidence interval for the ratio multisource (generic) product/comparator lie within 80.00-125.00% acceptance range for AUC&lt;sub&gt;0–t&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;. For high variable finished pharmaceutical products, the applicable acceptance range for C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; can be 69.84-143.19% &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/medicines/areas/quality_safety/quality_assurance/trs1003_annex6.pdf?ua=1 WHO guidelines on Multisource (generic) pharmaceutical products: guidelines on registration requirements to establish interchangeability WHO Technical Report Series, No. 1003, 2017, Annex 6]&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Australia ===

In [[Australia]], the [[Therapeutics Goods Administration]] (TGA) considers preparations to be bioequivalent if the 90% [[confidence interval]]s (90% CI) of the rate ratios, between the two preparations, of ''C''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; and AUC lie in the range 0.80–1.25. ''T''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; should also be similar between the products.&lt;ref name="Birkett_2003"/&gt;

There are tighter requirements for drugs with a narrow [[therapeutic index]] and/or saturable metabolism &amp;ndash; thus no generic products exist on the Australian market for [[digoxin]] or [[phenytoin]] for instance.

=== Europe ===

According to regulations applicable in the [[European Economic Area]]&lt;ref name="urlwww.emea.europa.eu"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Scientific_guideline/2010/01/WC500070039.pdf | title = Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence | author = Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use | authorlink = | coauthors = |date=20 January 2010 | format = pdf| work = | publisher = [[European Medicines Agency]] | accessdate = 21 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; two medicinal products are bioequivalent if they are pharmaceutically equivalent or pharmaceutical alternatives and if their bioavailabilities after administration in the same molar dose are similar to such a degree that their effects, with respect to both efficacy and safety, will be essentially the same. This is considered demonstrated if the 90% [[confidence interval]]s (90% CI) of the ratios for AUC&lt;sub&gt;0–t&lt;/sub&gt; and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; between the two preparations lie in the range 80–125%.

=== United States ===

The FDA considers two products bioequivalent if the 90% CI of the relative mean C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;, AUC&lt;sub&gt;(0–t)&lt;/sub&gt; and AUC&lt;sub&gt;(0–∞)&lt;/sub&gt; of the test (e.g. generic formulation) to reference (e.g. innovator brand formulation) should be within 80% to 125% in the fasting state. Although there are a few exceptions, generally a bioequivalent comparison of Test to Reference formulations also requires administration after an appropriate meal at a specified time before taking the drug, a so-called "fed" or "food-effect" study. A food-effect study requires the same statistical evaluation as the fasting study, described above.&lt;ref name="url_www.fda.gov"/&gt;

== Bioequivalence issues ==
While the FDA maintains that approved generic drugs are equivalent to their branded counterparts, bioequivalence problems have been reported by physicians and patients for many drugs.&lt;ref name="Midha KK, McKay G 664–70"&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=2782076 | pmid=19806461 | doi=10.1208/s12248-009-9142-z | volume=11 | title=Bioequivalence; its history, practice, and future | journal=AAPS J | pages=664–70 | author=Midha KK, McKay G}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain classes of drugs are suspected to be particularly problematic because of their chemistry. Some of these include chiral drugs, poorly absorbed drugs, and cytotoxic drugs. In addition, complex delivery mechanisms can cause bioequivalence variances.&lt;ref name="Midha KK, McKay G 664–70"/&gt; Physicians are cautioned to avoid switching patients from branded to generic, or between different generic manufacturers, when prescribing anti-epileptic drugs, [[warfarin]], and [[levothyroxine]].&lt;ref name="cell.com"&gt;http://www.cell.com/trends/pharmacological-sciences/fulltext/S0165-6147(15)00241-2&lt;/ref&gt;

Major issues were raised in the verification of bioequivalence when multiple generic versions of FDA-approved generic drug were found not to be equivalent in efficacy and side effect profiles.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.raps.org/focus-online/news/news-article-view/article/3794/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, two providers of consumer information on nutritional products and supplements, [[ConsumerLab.com]] and The People's Pharmacy, released the results of comparative tests of different brands of bupropion.&lt;ref name=peoples&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peoplespharmacy.com/archives/generic_drug_problems/generic_drug_equality_questioned.php |title=Generic drug equality questioned |accessdate=13 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The People's Pharmacy received multiple reports of increased side effects and decreased efficacy of generic bupropion, which prompted it to ask ConsumerLab.com to test the products in question. The tests showed that some generic versions of Wellbutrin XL 300&amp;nbsp;mg didn't perform the same as the brand-name pill in laboratory tests.&lt;ref name=msnbc&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21142869/ |title=Report questions generic antidepressant |accessdate=13 October 2007 |author=Stenson, Jacqueline |date=12 October 2007|publisher=[[msnbc.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FDA investigated these complaints and concluded that the generic version is equivalent to Wellbutrin XL in regard to bioavailability of bupropion and its main active metabolite hydroxybupropion. The FDA also said that coincidental natural mood variation is the most likely explanation for the apparent worsening of depression after the switch from Wellbutrin XL to Budeprion XL.&lt;ref name="urlReview of Therapeutic Equivalence: Generic Bupropion XL 300&amp;nbsp;mg and Wellbutrin XL 300&amp;nbsp;mg"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/OfficeofMedicalProductsandTobacco/CDER/ucm153270.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606092603/http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/CDER/ucm153270.htm |archivedate=6 June 2011|title=Review of therapeutic equivalence: generic bupropion XL 300&amp;nbsp;mg and Wellbutrin XL 300&amp;nbsp;mg |accessdate=19 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After several years of denying patient reports, in 2012 the FDA reversed this opinion, announcing that "Budeprion XL 300&amp;nbsp;mg fails to demonstrate therapeutic equivalence to Wellbutrin XL 300&amp;nbsp;mg."&lt;ref name=PR_FDA20121023&gt;{{cite press release |title=Budeprion XL 300&amp;nbsp;mg not therapeutically equivalent to Wellbutrin XL 300&amp;nbsp;mg |publisher=FDA |date=3 October 2012 |url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/ucm322161.htm |accessdate=23 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FDA did not test the bioequivalence of any of the other generic versions of Wellbutrin XL 300&amp;nbsp;mg, but requested that the four manufacturers submit data on this question to the FDA by March 2013. As of October 2013, the FDA has made determinations on the formulations from some manufacturers not being bioequivalent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FDA Update|url=http://www.fda.gov/drugs/drugsafety/postmarketdrugsafetyinformationforpatientsandproviders/ucm322161.htm|publisher=FDA|accessdate=15 June 2015|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, [[Ranbaxy]] was revealed to have been falsifying data regarding the generic drugs they were manufacturing. As a result, 30 products were removed from US markets and Ranbaxy paid $500 million in fines. The FDA investigated many Indian drug manufacturers after this was discovered, and as a result at least 12 companies have been banned from shipping drugs to the US.&lt;ref name="cell.com"/&gt;

The '''Börsen-Zeitung''' is the main daily newspaper in Germany exclusively focused on the financial markets. The Börsen-Zeitung's headquarters is in Frankfurt, with editorial offices in Berlin, Düsseldorf, Hamburg, Munich and Stuttgart, as well as Brussels, London, New York, Madrid, Milan, Paris, Shanghai, Tokyo, Washington, DC, and Zurich.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zeitung.de/medien/boersen-zeitung/ |title=Börsen-Zeitung – Geschichte &amp; Abo – Gratiszeitung &amp; Probeabo |website=Zeitung.de |date= |accessdate=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.boersen-zeitung.de/index.php?li=31&amp;subm=an |title=Anbieterkennzeichnung |website=Boersen-zeitung.de |date= |accessdate=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Börsen-Zeitung was founded in the postwar period to help "revive and promote stock exchange trading", according to the editorial in the first issue of 1 February 1952. The existing [[:de:Herausgebergemeinschaft Wertpapier-Mitteilungen, Keppler, Lehmann|Herausgebergemeinschaft Wertpapier-Mitteilungen, Keppler, Lehmann]] had been published since 1947 and focused on securities administration and bank settlements. Its publishers, a syndicate composed of the "Interessengemeinschaft Frankfurter Kreditinstitute" and the Lehmann and Keppler publishing families, decided to complement Wertpapier-Mitteilungen with a daily newspaper reporting on the securities business.

The focus of the Börsen-Zeitung in the 1950s was the capital markets. The first issues consisted mainly of reports from the German regional stock exchanges. In the early years the editorial part of the Börsen-Zeitung was limited to one or two pages and the remaining pages were lists of securities prices. Since then, the reporting content has steadily increased. The Börsen-Zeitung's perspective has become increasingly international, and the increased interest in the financial markets is reflected in the current issue length of 28 to 32 pages.

==Editorial focus==
The focus of reporting is on news, analysis, and commentary ranging from listed companies in the banking and insurance industry, international financing institutions, German and global capital markets to monetary policy and economic and financial policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Angela Cullen |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-23/commerzbank-may-cut-as-many-as-5-000-jobs-boersen-zeitung-says |title=Commerzbank Said to Weigh Thousands of Job Cuts in CEO Overhaul |publisher=Bloomberg |date=2016-07-04 |accessdate=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the outset, the Börsen-Zeitung's target readership was experts and decision makers. Thus the Börsen-Zeitung is a pure subscription newspaper and is available only at a limited number of newsagents.  The Börsen-Zeitung's articles are made available to subscribers online on the eve of ach publication day.

The paper is an official publication organ of all German stock exchanges.

Before stock market prices were disseminated via the Internet, the Börsen-Zeitung was the most comprehensive source for price information on the German stock exchanges. Today, closing prices and price movements are provided to subscribers via Börsen-Zeitung's "BZ WPI" online securities information system. Articles published in the Börsen-Zeitung since 1995 are searchable in the online archive [[:de:GBI-Genios|GBI-Genios]].

The Börsen-Zeitung also publishes monthly "Rendite – Das Anlagemagazin der Börsen-Zeitung" (Yield – The investment magazine of the Börsen-Zeitung).

In addition, the Börsen-Zeitung publishes two newsletters every two weeks:
"Rules &amp; Regulations, der Regulierungs-Newsletter der Börsen-Zeitung" (Rules &amp; Regulations, the Regulatory Newsletter of the Börsen-Zeitung)
"Fonds &amp; Finanzen, der Assetmanagement-Newsletter der Börsen-Zeitung" (Funds &amp; Finance, the Asset Management Newsletter of the Börsen-Zeitung)

WM Datenservice, the leading German information service for scheduling and master data for securities administration and settlement is also affiliated with Börsen-Zeitung. WM Datenservicel also issues WKN and ISIN [[Wertpapierkennnummer|Securities Identification Numbers]] in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grody |first=Allan D |url=http://www.fow.com/3522314/Battle-over-future-of-data-ID-standards-hots-up.html |title=Battle over future of data ID standards hots up &amp;#124; Futures &amp; Options World – Let's Talk Derivatives |website=Fow.com |date=2016-01-20 |accessdate=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wmdaten.de/index.php |title=WM Datenservice (WM Data Service) |publisher=WM Gruppe }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7974">The '''cement industry in the United States''' produced {{convert|82.8 |e6t}} of [[cement]] in 2015, worth US$9.8 billion, and was used to manufacture concrete worth about US$50 billion. The US was the world's third-largest producer of cement, after [[Cement industry in China|China]] and [[India]]. The US [[cement industry]] includes 99 [[cement mill]]s in 34 states, plus two plants in [[Puerto Rico]]. The industry directly employed 10,000 workers in 2015. Ten percent of the cement used in the United States in 2015 was imported.&lt;ref name="Summary"&gt;US Geological Survey, [http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/cement/ Cement], Mineral Commodity Summary, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
The types and amounts of cement produced in 2015 were:
* [[Portland cement]]  80.4 million tons
* Masonry cement  2.4 million tons
* Other [[hydraulic cement]]  0.6 million tons

Cement production is predominantly [[portland cement]], which is mostly used in concrete. Cement for concrete is an essential material for construction, and demand is a function of construction spending. Single-family residential construction is considered only moderately cement-intensive; multifamily residential somewhat more intensive. Nonresidential construction and government construction projects are considered the most cement-intensive.

In 2013, 70.8 percent of portland cement was sold as [[ready-mix concrete]], such as is delivered in cement-mixer trucks. 11.5 percent was sold dry to contractors and construction materials stores; 11.3 percent was sold to manufacturers of concrete products; 4.6 percent was sold for oil and gas wells, and 1.8 percent was sold to government agencies and others.&lt;ref name="Yearbook"&gt;US Geological Survey, [http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/cement/myb1-2013-cemen.pdf Cement], Minerals Yearbook, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
Because cement is a bulk commodity, transportation can be a significant part of the cost. To minimize transportation costs, cement plants are ideally located close to the market, with access to efficient transportation such as ship or railroad. Most cement plants are located close to the limestone deposits.

Thirty-four states have cement manufacturing plants. In 2013, the five leading cement-producing states, in descending order, were: [[Texas]], [[California]], [[Missouri]], [[Florida]], and [[Alabama]]. Together, the five accounted for almost half of US cement production. The list of top five cement-consuming states is similar: Texas, California, Florida, [[Ohio]] and [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name="Yearbook"/&gt;

In 2015, about 10 percent of US cement consumption came from imports. The largest sources of US cement imports were [[Canada]] and [[Greece]].&lt;ref name="Summary"/&gt;

==Industry structure==
In 2013, the top producers of portland cement in the US were:&lt;ref name="Yearbook"/&gt;

* 1 - [[CEMEX]]
* 2 - [[Holcim]] (now [[LafargeHolcim]])
* 3 - Lehigh Hanson Inc.
* 4 - [[Buzzi Unicem]]
* 5 - [[Ash Grove Cement Company]] (to be acquired by [[CRH plc]] in early 2018)
* 6 - [[Lafarge North America]] (merged with Holcim in 2015)
* 7 - [[Texas Industries Inc]]
* 8 - Eagle Minerals Inc.
* 9 - Essroc Cement Corp.
* 10 - St. Marys Cement Group

In 2013, the top 5 companies produced 54 percent of US portland cement; the top 10 companies produced 78 percent.

==Inputs==
Portland cement is a complex mixture, mostly calcium, with admixtures of aluminium, silica, and iron. The choice of source materials depends on local availability. The calcium is usually supplied by limestone, but sometimes shell or coral. Slightly clayey limestones are preferable, because they already contain the necessary aluminium. Cement cannot contain more than 5 percent magnesium, so the limestone must be low in magnesium.

Energy sources used in the US to manufacture cement in 2013 were:
* Coal  6.0 million metric tons
* Petroleum coke  1.6 million metric tons
* Solid waste  1.1 million metric tons
* Used tires  0.4 million metric tons
* Oil  15.7 million liters
* Liquid waste  0.8 million liters
* Natural gas  694 million cubic meters
* Electricity  10.5 billion kilowatt-hours

==Environmental Effects==
The cement industry has both positive and negative effects on the environment.

===Source of waste and pollutants===
Cement manufacture is a source of the following airborne contaminants: particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www3.epa.gov/ttnchie1/ap42/ch11/final/c11s06.pdf Cement manufacture], US EPA, accessed 1 June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cement production releases carbon dioxide by [[sintering]] limestone or shells. It is also very energy-intensive, with the result that the cement industry is a large emitter of carbon dioxide.

===Destruction of waste and pollutants===
The high temperatures of [[cement kiln]]s, the ability of concrete to incorporate different materials, and the stable and nonreactive nature of the concrete end product, all make cement kilns a desirable method for the destruction of hazardous waste. 

Hazardous wastes efficiently destroyed by cement kilns include chlorinated solvents ([[methylene chloride]], [[trichloroethylene]], [[trichloromethane]], [[trichloroethane]], [[carbon tetrachloride]]), [[Freon]]-113, [[polychlorinated biphenyl]]s (PCBs), [[dioxin]], waste oil, and used hydrocarbon solvents. Whatever undesirable materials are not destroyed are locked in the finished concrete, a stable material with low permeability. Hydrocarbon waste and used tires contribute to the kiln heat, and reduces fuel use. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www3.epa.gov/trimewebhelp/test/WebHelp.1282016/section_4_5_3_cement_kilns_burning_hazardous_waste_as_supplemental_fuel.htm "Cement kilns burning hazardous waste as supplemental fuel], US Environmental Protection Agency, accessed 2 June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to destruction of hazardous waste, waste materials from other industries, such as slag and fly ash, are commonly incorporated into cement, eliminating the need to landfill the waste.&lt;ref&gt;[http://industrialresourcescouncil.org/Applications/PortlandCementManufacturing/tabid/384/Default.aspx Portland cement manufacturing], Industrial Resources Council, accessed 1 June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The ability of cement to incorporate different materials allows contaminated soil to be added to the feed, eliminating the need to take the material to a hazardous waste landfill. The US EPA estimated that in 2014, 13.1 million tons of coal fly ash, which otherwise would have to be landfilled, was beneficially used in cement.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.epa.gov/coalash/coal-ash-reuse&lt; Coal as reuse], US EPA, 24 June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the use of fly ash improves the strength and durability of concrete&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/pavement/recycling/fach03.cfm Fly ash concrete for highways], US Dept. of Transportation, accessed 13 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17040">The term '''"Crown servant"''' is used to denote a "person employed by the Crown".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.btb.termiumplus.gc.ca/tpv2alpha/alpha-fra.html?lang=fra&amp;i=&amp;index=alt&amp;srchtxt=CROWN%20SERVANT |title=Crown Servant |website=Termium Plus - The Government of Canada’s terminology and linguistic data bank.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the term is not consistently defined, generally speaking the term encompasses all [[Minister of the Crown|executive officials]] and their staffs, [[civil servants]], [[police]], [[judiciary|judicial officials]], and members of the [[armed forces]]. While the term is used in other Commonwealth countries such as [[Canada]], it has the most predominant use and is the most well-defined with the [[United Kingdom]].

==Crown servant vs civil servant==
{{quote|There is no meaningful legal definition of a civil servant. The [[Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010]] following the Tomlin Commission on the Civil Service unhelpfully refers to "the civil service of the State".|John Alder, ''Constitutional and Administrative Law''&lt;ref name=Alder&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alder|first1=John|title=Constitutional and Administrative Law|date=2013|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9781137050007|pages=326–327|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qwAdBQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA327&amp;ots=qfSDSQHqz1&amp;dq=crown%20servant%20definition&amp;pg=PA326#v=onepage&amp;q=crown%20servant%20definition&amp;f=false|accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The terms [[civil servant]] and Crown servant can coincide but are sometimes exclusive. It is suggested that the phrase "civil servant" may include every person who serves the Crown, with the exception of members of the [[British Armed Forces|armed forces of the United Kingdom]], the [[British Government frontbench|Ministers of the Crown]] and the [[judiciaries of the United Kingdom]]. However, members of the armed forces are nonetheless Crown servants.&lt;ref name=Alder /&gt;

==Employment rights==
Crown servants serve "at the pleasure of the Crown", and do not therefore benefit from the protections normally available to employees by law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carroll|first1=Alex|title=Constitutional and Administrative Law|date=2007|publisher=Pearson Education|isbn=9781405812313|page=267|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TViGFDOkFRoC&amp;lpg=PA269&amp;ots=gyEB_FuHV1&amp;dq=crown%20servant%20definition&amp;pg=PA267#v=onepage&amp;q=crown%20servant%20definition&amp;f=false|accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the majority of these protections are applied to them by the [[Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992]]. For the purposes of the Act, "crown employment" means employment "under or for the purposes of a government department or any officer or body exercising on behalf of the Crown functions conferred by an enactment", though members of the armed forces are excluded from this provision, and the government has the ability to exclude other Crown servants "for the purpose of safeguarding national security".&lt;ref&gt;{{Halsbury|39|Employment|893}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Official Secrets Act 1989==
Section 12(1) of the [[Official Secrets Act 1989]] defines the expression "Crown servant" for the purposes of that Act. It now provides:

{{Blockquote|In this Act "Crown servant" means -

:[(ab) the [[First Minister for Wales]], a [[Welsh Minister]] appointed under section 48 of the Government of Wales Act 2006, the [[Counsel General to the Welsh Assembly Government]] or a [[Deputy Welsh Minister]];]
:(b) . . .
:(c) any person employed in the civil service of the Crown, including [[Her Majesty's Diplomatic Service]], [[Her Majesty's Overseas Civil Service]], the civil service of Northern Ireland and the [[Northern Ireland Court Service]];
:(d) any member of the naval, military or air forces of the Crown, including any person employed by an association established for the purposes of [Part XI of the [[Reserve Forces Act 1996]]];
:(e) any [[constable]] and any other person employed or appointed in or for the purposes of any police force [(including the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]] and the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland Reserve]])][or of the [[Serious Organised Crime Agency]]];
:(f) any person who is a member or employee of a prescribed body or a body of a prescribed class and either is prescribed for the purposes of this paragraph or belongs to a prescribed class of members or employees of any such body;

The words "or of the [[National Criminal Intelligence Service]] or the [[National Crime Squad]]" had been inserted on 1 April 1998,&lt;ref&gt;The [[Police Act 1997 (Commencement No. 5 and Transitional Provisions) Order 1998]] (S.I. 1998/354 (C.8)), [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1998/354/article/2/made article 2(2)(ay)]&lt;/ref&gt; by section 134(1) of, and [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1997/50/schedule/9/paragraph/62 paragraph 62] of Schedule 9 to the [[Police Act 1997]].

[[Image:DowntownJerseyCity.JPG|right|250px|thumb|View of Downtown focused around the [[30 Hudson Street|Goldman Sachs Tower]]]]'''Downtown''' is an area of [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]], [[New Jersey]], United States, which includes the Historic Downtown and the Waterfront.  Historic Downtown can be further broken down into the neighborhoods of [[Harsimus Cove]], [[The Village, Jersey City|The Village]], [[Van Vorst Park]], Grove Street, [[Hamilton Park, Jersey City|Hamilton Park]] and [[Holland Tunnel#Boyle Plaza|Boyle Plaza]].  The Waterfront includes the [[Powerhouse Arts District, Jersey City|Powerhouse Arts District]]/WALDO, [[Newport, Jersey City|Newport]], the [[Harborside Financial Center]] and [[Paulus Hook, Jersey City|Paulus Hook]] (including [[Exchange Place (Jersey City)|Exchange Place]]).  Historic Downtown is the area west of Marin Boulevard, while the Waterfront lies to the east.

'''Historic Downtown''' was an area of mostly low-rise buildings to the west of the waterfront—but that is rapidly changing.  It includes the neighborhoods of [[Van Vorst Park]] and Hamilton Park, which are square parks surrounded by brownstones.  The Grove Street neighborhood has also seen a lot of development and the neighborhood is rich with stores and restaurants&lt;ref&gt;http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/firstatfour/story?section=firstatfour&amp;id=8452406{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; that cater to the diverse backgrounds of Jersey City's inhabitants.  The [[Grove Street (PATH station)|Grove Street]] [[Port Authority Trans-Hudson|PATH]] station is in the process of being rebuilt and a number of new housing is being built around the stop. Historic Downtown is home to many cultural attractions including the Jersey City Museum, the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad Powerhouse (planned to become a museum and artist housing) and the [[Harsimus Stem Embankment]] along Sixth Street, which a citizens' movement is working to turn into public parkland.

Like Historic Downtown, the '''Waterfront''' of Jersey City is an area rich in history and full of current development.  It is the location of the end of the [[Morris Canal]] and there is still a segment of this basin surrounded by [[Liberty State Park]].  The giant [[Colgate Clock (New Jersey)|Colgate Clock]], next to the [[30 Hudson Street|Goldman Sachs Tower]] reminds people of the industry that used to line the [[Hudson River]] on New Jersey's Coast.  Many of the names of Jersey City's downtown neighborhoods come from [[Dutch language|Dutch words]] or [[Dutch people|Dutch names]] from the early inhabitants along the Hudson.  Paulus Hook is a quiet mostly residential neighborhood stretching to the west from the Goldman Sachs building.  Its main streets are Essex and Morris Streets and its waterfront is along the Morris Canal, where it maintains a walkway which is part of Jersey City's longer waterfront walkway.  The [[Essex Street (HBLR station)|Essex Street]] station on the [[Hudson-Bergen Light Rail]] and the development of office buildings to the east have allowed more businesses to line Morris Street including a number of restaurants with outdoor seating.  The Paulus Hook and Grove Street neighborhoods, unlike many other redeveloped neighborhoods on the Hudson have undergone the same revitalization with less [[gentrification]].  The Newport/Pavonia, Harborside Financial Center and Exchange Place neighborhoods on the waterfront are experiencing significant construction of [[tower block|high-rise towers]] and with the addition of the Light Rail and more ferry service the area has become a growing destination for businesses, residents and tourists.  WALDO (work and live district overlay) is an area that is being redeveloped from its days as a warehouse center to an artist community.  It is already home to several galleries and restaurants and development of artist housing, more galleries, a museum and stores are being planned.  The former [[Hudson and Manhattan Railroad Powerhouse]] is the building that anchors this neighborhood and when it is renovated it will maintain its shell that so many locals are used to seeing.  A Trump Plaza is currently being constructed on the property to the south of the Powerhouse. In January 2016, the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] gave navigational clearance for construction of a {{convert|900|ft|adj=on}} residential and commercial tower planned by the Chinese Overseas America Corporation, which would succeed the Goldman Sachs Tower as the tallest [[skyscraper]] in New Jersey.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, Terrence T. [http://www.nj.com/hudson/index.ssf/2016/01/plans_for_njs_new_tallest_tower_gets_federal_ok.html "Plans for N.J.'s new tallest tower get federal OK"], ''[[The Jersey Journal]]'', January 12, 2016. Accessed January 14, 2016. "China Oversea America is behind the project, which is set to include 781 condo units. Originally planned to rise 950 feet and include 95 stories, the newest plans have it topping out at 900 feet and 79 stories."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Downtown districts==
Tulsa includes many structures built during the Oil Boom in the 1920s and 1930s, including [[Art Deco]] buildings such as the [[Mid-Continent Tower]], [[Boston Avenue Methodist Church]], and the Exchange Bank Building (today known as the [[320 South Boston Building]]). Oilman [[Waite Phillips]], left a significant architectural impact on downtown Tulsa through the [[Philtower Building|Philtower]] and Philcade buildings. Other notable Tulsa buildings include the [[Atlas Life Building]], [[Holy Family Cathedral in Tulsa|Holy Family Cathedral]], Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church, and the [[Mayo Hotel]], the former of which once served as home to [[J. Paul Getty]]. Known for a time as "[[Terracotta|Terra Cotta]] City",&lt;ref&gt;Tulsa City-County Library, "Art Deco in Tulsa." Accessed August 22, 2011.{{cite web |url=http://www.tulsalibrary.org/research/artdeco/artdecointulsa.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114162424/http://www.tulsalibrary.org/research/artdeco/artdecointulsa.php |archivedate=2012-11-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tulsa hosted the International Sixth Congress on Art Deco in 2001.

Downtown Tulsa is in the northwest quadrant of the city and is ringed by an expressway system called the inner dispersal loop. Downtown's buildings include many large office towers. At {{convert|667|ft|m|abbr=on}}, the [[BOK Tower]] (formerly One Williams Center) was the tallest building in any of the 5 "plains states" ([[Oklahoma]], [[Kansas]], [[Nebraska]], [[North Dakota]] and [[South Dakota]]) until the [[Devon Tower]] in [[Oklahoma City]] was completed in 2012. The BOK Tower was designed in 1975 by [[Minoru Yamasaki]] &amp; Associates, the same architect who designed the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] in [[New York City]].

The [[Tulsa Performing Arts Center]] occupies a half city block in Tulsa's historical downtown. The PAC is also the design of [[Minoru Yamasaki]]. It houses five theatres and a reception hall. More than a quarter of a million people visit the Center each year to attend a performance from one of Tulsa's seven acclaimed musical and dramatic companies including the [[Tulsa Ballet]], [[Tulsa Symphony Orchestra]], [[Tulsa Opera]], and a variety of symphonic groups. The PAC hosts a multitude of cultural events through the fall, winter and spring.

In 2005 the City of Tulsa broke ground on a 19,199 seat regional events center designed by [[architect]] [[César Pelli]]. The arena was named the [[BOK Center]] (or [[Bank of Oklahoma Center]]) and opened on August 30, 2008.

===Blue Dome District===
[[Image:BlueDome.jpg|thumb|left|The Blue Dome, a former Gulf Oil Service Station, built in 1924.]]

Another popular downtown entertainment district is the Blue Dome, named for a distinctive, domed building at Second Street and Elgin Avenue, in the area in the eastern section of downtown. The building was originally constructed in 1924 as a [[Gulf Oil]] service station. It has been converted to an information desk/office for the district, and is about two blocks south of the OneOK field.

The Blue Dome District is known for its local dining options, large art festival, and scenic Downtown Tulsa views. Every May, the Blue Dome Arts Festival allows families to enjoy local music and street vendors surrounding the historic dome. Further, there is no bad angle for pictures of Tulsa's infamous skyline in this district. With so many delicious restaurants and walkable views, it is no wonder that the Blue Dome District continues to bring its unique art scene to Tulsa. 

=== Deco District ===
Tulsa boasts one of the nation’s most extensive collections of Art Deco architecture, which is most visible in the downtown Deco District. This region spans the area from 1st to 8th street, with borders at Boston and Cheyenne. This area is located in the heart of the skyscrapers of Downtown Tulsa and thus has many food, beverage, and fitness options readily available. The Bartlett Square at 5th and Main provides a unique European feel to this region, but the entire area is overflowing with Tulsa charm. 

The Philtower and Philcade buildings, the Atlas Life building, Tulsa Club, and Public Service Company of Oklahoma building are some of the most prominent displays of the Art Deco architecture style in Tulsa. Many tours of this region are readily available. Perhaps one of the more interesting facts about the Art Deco region are the underground tunnels which connect many of the classic buildings. They are now open for public tours, providing interested guests with a one of a kind Tulsa experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tulsaworld.com/tulsaworldmagazine/are-hidden-tunnels-under-downtown-tulsa/article_5b5b8e68-e53c-5b8f-bb22-e751c5bf81f1.html|title=Are ‘hidden tunnels’ under downtown Tulsa?|last=World|first=Michael Overall Tulsa|work=Tulsa World|access-date=2018-08-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond the extensive variety of local shops and restaurants, this district annually hosts one of the largest festivals in Tulsa: Mayfest. Every May, the Deco District comes alive during Mayfest, where artists, vendors, and live musicians combine to create one of the largest street festivals in Tulsa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tulsamayfest.org/|title=Tulsa International Mayfest presented by Midfirst Bank|website=Tulsa International Mayfest presented by Midfirst Bank|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===East Village===
East Village comprises 115 acres bordered by East 2nd and East 7th Streets, Detroit Avenue and Lansing Avenue, just inside the inner-dispersal loop.&lt;ref&gt;Easterling, Mike. "East Village: Dead or Alive?." March 25, 2009. Accessed September 7, 2011.[http://www.urbantulsa.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A26686] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120806034615/http://www.urbantulsa.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A26686 |date=2012-08-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This area boasts an upscale martini bar, a hair salon, a pet day care, photography studios, lofts, a knitting room and living arts district, among others. The cornerstone of this neighborhood is the fifth largest [[LGBT]] community center in the United States, the Dennis R. Neill Equality Center, owned and operated by Oklahomans for Equality/OkEq (formerly Tulsa Oklahomans for Human Rights/TOHR), with further development being planned for more restaurants, residential lofts and retail.

The development in the East Village has provided Tulsans and visitors with many food and entertainment opportunities. With areas like the Bond Center for large events intertwined with luxurious apartment complexes, the feeling of community is particularly strong within this area. The Boxyard- a shopping complex made from repurposed shipping containers- has quickly become a popular destination for local shopping and eating within the East Village.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tulsaboxyard.com/|title=home|website=The Boxyard|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The annual MOJO music fest occurs in this region, mixing live music with local craft beers and food trucks. Regardless of interest, the East Village District has something for everyone in Downtown Tulsa.

===Greenwood Historical District===

{{Main|Greenwood, Tulsa, Oklahoma}}

The [[Greenwood, Tulsa, Oklahoma|Greenwood Historical District]] is just north of downtown and east of the Brady District. It was once one of the most affluent African-American communities in the United States and referred to as Black Wall Street.  In 1921, thirty-five blocks of businesses and residences were burned in this district during the infamous [[Tulsa Race Riot]], the bloodiest racial riot in the history of the United States. The [[Oklahoma Legislature]] passed laws in 2001 aimed at revitalizing Greenwood, setting up a [[scholarship]] fund for college-bound descendants of riot victims and appropriating $2 million for a riot memorial. As of 2004, two blocks of the old neighborhood have been restored and are part of the Greenwood Historical District. It is now home to the Greenwood Cultural Center, the Tulsa Race Riot Memorial, and the Oklahoma Jazz Hall of Fame, as well as [[Oklahoma State University - Tulsa]] and [[Langston University]]-Tulsa.

Because of its rich history, the Greenwood Historical District provides visitors with one of the most unique cultural experiences in Tulsa. The John Hope Franklin Reconciliation Park details the relationship between African-Americans and the state of Oklahoma throughout history with an emphasis on the Tulsa Race Riot. The Mabel B Little Heritage House takes visitors back to the 1920s with its classic furnishings and information about the Riots&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.travelok.com/listings/view.profile/id.4718|title=TravelOK.com - Oklahoma's Official Travel &amp; Tourism Site|website=www.travelok.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The Greenwood Cultural Center strives to educate on the unique history of the Greenwood District, with a focus on jazz and the blues as well. Alongside these important landmarks in the Greenwood District lies a growing retail district bordering OneOK Field on the east. With an ever-increasing number of food and dessert options in the region, Greenwood Historical District is a great stop to learn about Tulsa's history and refuel. 

===Tulsa Arts District===
Formerly known as the Brady Arts District, the Tulsa Art District is located north across the Sante Fe Railroad tracks from the central business district and centered at Main Street &amp; Brady Avenue. The Brady District is one of Tulsa's oldest areas, characterized by two-story brick warehouses.

[[Image:Cains Ballroom Tulsa Night.jpg|thumb|right|Cain's Ballroom]]

The [[Brady Theater]], built between 1912 and 1914, was originally designed to serve as the city's municipal auditorium and was simply called "Convention Hall" for the first forty years of its life and was one of three internment camps where African Americans were detained after the 1921 Tulsa Race Riot.  In 1952, major additions were added and the building was renamed Tulsa Municipal Theater.  The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.  Supplanted as the city auditorium in 1979 by construction of the Performing Arts Center in downtown, "the Old Lady on Brady" continues to be used today for a wide variety of concerts and theatrical productions.

North of the Brady on Main Street is the [[Cain's Ballroom]], formerly the garage of the Brady family&lt;ref&gt;''This Land'', "The Nightmare of Dreamland." Accessed September 12, 2011.[http://thislandpress.com/09/01/2011/tate-brady-battle-greenwood/]&lt;/ref&gt; and the home of [[Bob Wills]] and his band, the Texas Playboys. The district is also the location of many local artists' galleries, restaurants with late night hours, bars and dance clubs. It is also an emerging gay neighborhood, with several gay or gay-friendly bars and numerous supportive shops and restaurants.

A few blocks southeast of Cain's Ballroom lies one of the gems of the Downtown Tulsa area- the Guthrie Green. This urban park is a cross between a garden and an amphitheater with events ranging from movie nights to workout classes hosted there. With family friendly concerts, food truck Wednesday's, and fountains to play in, the Guthrie Green has become a central point for the Tulsa Arts District. In fact, on the first Friday of every month, local businesses in this area center their First Friday Art Crawl around the Green, with exhibits at Philbrook Downtown, 108 Contemporary, and the Hardesty Arts Center (AHHA) which border the park. This monthly event brings the community together to enjoy the best food, drinks, and entertainment that the Tulsa Arts District can provide. 

Today, the Tulsa Arts District is one of the most diverse areas in all of Tulsa. It hosts restaurants, clubs, museums, and businesses and is a prime example of urban living. There is presently construction which will more than double the number of permanent residents in this artistic conclave. On its present path, the area will continue to develop as a hub of the community welcoming all people as it acknowledges its past while looking to a vibrant and inclusive future.

==Economy==
Major employers in Downtown Tulsa include the corporate headquarters of [[Williams Companies]] and [[ONEOK]].&lt;ref&gt;http://co.williams.com/contact-us/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oneok.com/en/About.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; BOK Financial is headquartered there as well.

'''Emil Kolben''' (1 November 1862 in [[Strančice]] - 3 September 1943 in [[Terezín]]) was an engineer and entrepreneur from [[Bohemia]]. The large engineering company [[ČKD]] bears his name. He died in the [[Theresienstadt concentration camp]].

== Biography ==
Kolben was born into the German-speaking Jewish family of a small shopkeeper in the village of [[Strančice]], southeast from [[Prague]]. He had nine siblings and from the age of 15 he was left to care for himself. After completing his secondary education in Prague, Kolben studied there at the German Technical University. After finishing university he obtained a two-year [[František Josef Gerstner|Gerstner's]] stipend that allowed him to study abroad. In 1887 he traveled to [[Zürich]], [[Paris]] and [[London]] and in April 1888 he sailed with his wife Malvinus to the [[United States]], where he stayed for five years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;hl=en&amp;prev=search&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=cs&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;u=https://praha.idnes.cz/tovarna-ckd-kolbenka-slavi-120-let-da6-/praha-zpravy.aspx%3Fc%3DA160610_2252496_praha-zpravy_rsr&amp;usg=ALkJrhhEKGp5TS6Sq2qQPBNz8CwC_ewrNg iDNES.cz Kolbenka celebrates 120 years, 10 June 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; After arriving in New York he set off on further study trips traveling across the country. He obtained a position as an engineer at the [[Edison Machine Works]] in [[Schenectady]], then as an assistant of [[Thomas Edison]] in [[Orange, New Jersey]] and finally as the chief-engineer in Edison's laboratories. In 1889 he visited the laboratory of [[Nikola Tesla]] to learn about the poly-phase [[alternating current]] motors and power system the inventor was developing there.&lt;ref&gt;[https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=cs&amp;u=https://www.3pol.cz/cz/rubriky/biografie/177-emil-kolben&amp;prev=search Emil Kolben, Třípól - student magazine, 15 December 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1892 Kolben returned to Europe and for two years worked as the chief-designer in [[Switzerland]] for company [[Maschinenfabrik Oerlikon|Oerlikon]] which manufactured poly-phase alternating current generators. In 1896 he returned to Bohemia and, in the same year, set up a company  named "''Kolben a spol.''" in [[Vysočany, Prague|Vysočany]], an industrial district of Prague.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Die Grossindustrie Böhmens, 1848-1918|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=u3nxwch3imMC&amp;pg=PA126&amp;lpg=PA126|publisher = Oldenbourg Verlag|date = 1987-01-01|isbn = 9783486518719|language = de|first = Karl M.|last = Brousek}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 60 [[Watt (unit)|kW]] alternator was the first system constructed. With secured financial investment from a bank the company became a stock holding company in 1898. In 1899 it was renamed to "''Elektrotechnická a. s.''". In 1911 Kolben invited Edison to visit Prague.

The company produced large electrotechnical systems such as hydro-electric power stations, [[locomotive]]s and machines. Used technologies and equipment were much above standards of the time - for example instead of using a centralized power source and mechanical transmitters the machines were fitted with electrical engines.

In 1921 the company merged with another engineering company "''Českomoravská strojírna''" into "''Českomoravská-Kolben a. s.''". In 1927 it merged with "''A. s. strojírny''" (formerly "''Breitfeld &amp; Daněk''") into "''Českomoravská-Kolben-Daněk''", the [[ČKD]]. Kolben had served as the director until 1939. The company produced a wide array of electrotechnic and engineering systems and also complete industrial plants. ČKD employed up to 15,000&amp;nbsp;people.

Kolben also founded two other companies: "''Pražská továrna na káble''" in Prague-[[Hostivař]] (power cables) and "''Pražská elektroinstalační společnost''" in Prague-[[Hloubětín (Prague)|Hloubětín]] (wiring systems). He published dozens of articles, mostly about electrotechnic and engineering.

Immediately after the occupation of Czechoslovakia by the [[Nazis]] (1939) Kolben was recalled from his position as the director (March 16) and later imprisoned in the [[concentration camp Theresienstadt]]. He died there abandoned and exhausted. Almost all members of his family were imprisoned; 26 of them were killed by the Germans. His grandson Jindřich (b. 1926) survived.

ČKD was heavily damaged during the last days of [[World War II]]. It later employed up to 50,000&amp;nbsp;people and was known mainly for locomotives and [[tram]]s. Mismanagement during the new free-market era (1990s) and technological delay accumulated during previous decades resulted in bankruptcy in 1998 and a massive reduction in production.

The '''Fair Trading Act 1986''' is a statute of [[New Zealand]].  Its purpose is to encourage competition and to protect consumers/customers from misleading and deceptive conduct and unfair trade practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comcom.govt.nz/the-fair-trading-act/|title=The Fair Trading Act|publisher=[[Commerce Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fair Trading Act provides for consumer information standards.
Under the Act, the [[Commerce Commission]] enforces product safety standards on items such as bicycles and flammability of children's night clothing.

==Main rules==
{{expand section|date=November 2014}}
The Act protects customers from unfair conduct. Unfair conduct has been classified in the act as the following:
# Misleading and deceptive conduct: Generally, in relation to goods, in relation to services and in relation to employment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1986/0121/latest/link.aspx?id=DLM96902|title=Fair Trading Act - Section 9 - Misleading and deceptive conduct generally}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Unsubstantial representation&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consumeraffairs.govt.nz/pdf-library/publications/fair_trading_actc.pdf Fair Trading Act - Consumer facts]. ''Consumer Affairs''. Retrieved on 28 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

# Unfair practices: These include but are not limited to [[Bait-and-switch|Bait advertising]], referral selling and trading stamp schemes. Regulation relation to Trading stamp schemes however has been repealed. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1986/0121/latest/DLM96943.html|title=Fair Trading Act - Section 18 - Trading stamp schemes prohibited}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comcom.govt.nz/fair-trading/fair-trading-act-fact-sheets/misleading-consumers-about-their-rights/|title=Misleading consumers about their rights|publisher=Commerence Commission}} Retrieved on 26 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Part 2 of the Act also looks at Consumer information. It defines standards and also compliance requirements.

A 2015 amendment increased protection against "unfair contracts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/opinion-analysis/65245387/New-regime-targets-terms-in-contracts-fine-print| title=New regime targets terms in contracts' fine print| first=Troy| last=Pilkington| date=21 January 2015| publisher=stuff.co.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt;\

Flash is particularly visible as a solid patch of plastic at bottom centre-right, between the model aeroplane side and the sprue.]]'''Flash''', also known as '''flashing''', is excess material attached to a [[molding (process)|molded]], [[forging|forged]], or [[casting|cast]] product, which must usually be removed. This is typically caused by leakage of the material between the two surfaces of a mold (beginning along the [[parting line]]&lt;ref name="Kazmer2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Kazmer|title=Injection mold design engineering|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fWTftzWhBp4C&amp;pg=PA70|accessdate=15 April 2011|year=2007|publisher=Hanser Verlag|isbn=978-1-56990-417-6|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;) or between the base material and the mold (in the case of overmolding). Molding flash is seen when the optimized parameter on cull height is not calibrated.{{citation needed|date=July 2009}} Proper design of mold parting surfaces can reduce or eliminate flash.&lt;ref name="VGX"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plm.automation.siemens.com/en_sg/Images/3014_tcm963-4308.pdf|title=NX I-deasVGX Core/Cavity|year=2007|publisher=Siemens PLM Software|accessdate=2009-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Molding flash can be caused from old or worn mold cavities that no longer fit tightly together. Other times, the complexity of the part requires so many mating pieces with such precise geometries that it is almost impossible to create a perfect fit on every impression. Most often, the type of material being molded, and its attendant viscosity in its liquid form, is the primary factor that leads to the creation of the unwanted mold flash.&lt;ref name="bozzelli"&gt;Bozzelli, John [http://www.ptonline.com/articles/an-expert-tells-how-to-stop-flash "An Expert Tells How to Stop Flash"], ''Plastics Technology'', July 2004, accessed May 9, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of removing flash, known as '''deflashing''', is commonly performed via cutting, breaking, [[grinding (abrasive cutting)|grinding]], or [[Tumble finishing|tumbling]]. Some foundries use robot autogrinders to remove this unwanted material. It is very typical for molders to have their operators trim flash with hand tools at the molding machine between cycles. Many molders and OEMs seek out the use of batch processes including vibratory tumbling, cryogenic deflashing&lt;ref name="Nitrofreeze"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nitrofreeze.com/services/deflashing/cryogenic-deflashing-using-blast-media/|title=Cryogenic Deflashing for Molded Plastic, Rubber &amp; Silicone|publisher=Nitrofreeze Cryogenic Solutions|accessdate=2014-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; or media blasting to remove unwanted flash from large batches of parts.

== Witness mark ==
In plastic injection, a faint mark called a '''witness mark''' (or '''witness line''') will occur along the parting line.&lt;ref name="Kazmer2007"/&gt; This is unavoidable and is usually accepted despite the minor aesthetics issue. However, some part surfaces (e.g. when used for sealing&lt;ref name="Bernard2005"&gt;{{cite patent|country=US | number = 6939500 | status = patent | title = Method and apparatus for eliminating a parting line witness mark from a molded part | gdate = 2005-09-06 | invent1 = Bernard, Edward Helmut}}&lt;/ref&gt;) cannot tolerate witness marks, and thus either the marks must be removed post-molding or the [[Molding (process)|mold]] redesigned.

{{Contract law}}

'''Frustration of purpose''', in [[law]], is a defense to enforcement of a [[contract]]. Frustration of purpose occurs when an unforeseen event undermines a party's principal purpose for entering into a contract such that the performance of the contract is radically different from performance of the contract that was originally contemplated by both parties, and both parties knew of the principal purpose at the time the contract was made.&lt;ref name="1982 HCA 24"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|24|1992|litigants=[[Codelfa Construction Pty Ltd v State Rail Authority of NSW]] |parallelcite=(1982) 149 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 337 |date=11 May 1982 |courtname=auto}}.austlii&lt;/ref&gt; Despite frequently arising as a result of government action, any third party or even nature can frustrate a contracting party's primary purpose for entering into the contract. The concept is also called commercial frustration.

For example, if Joe gets a mortgage for a new home, suppose after three years, the home is destroyed, through no fault of Joe's. Without a [[hell or high water clause]], Joe might be exempt from the remainder of the mortgage, as the principal purpose of the contract, to have a home to live in, has been compromised. However, he might still have a [[foreclosure]] on his [[credit rating]].

Frustration of purpose is often confused with the closely related doctrine of [[impossibility]]. The distinction is that impossibility concerns the duties specified in the contract, but frustration of purpose concerns the reason a party entered into the contract. An example is if entrepreneur Emily leases space from landlord Larry so that she can open a restaurant that serves only Tibetan Speckled Lizard meat. If the city rezones the property to forbid commercial uses or if the property is destroyed by a tornado, both Larry and Emily are excused from performing the contract by impossibility.

However, if the Tibetan Speckled Lizard suddenly goes extinct, Emily may be excused from performing the contract because Larry knew her primary purpose for entering into the lease was to serve Tibetan Speckled Lizard, and the purpose has been frustrated. In the second scenario, the parties could still carry out their obligations under the lease, but one of them no longer has a reason to.

The ''[[Restatement (Second) of Contracts]]'', Section 265, defines frustration of purpose:
{{quote|Where, after a contract is made, a party's principal purpose is substantially frustrated without his fault by the occurrence of an event the non-occurrence of which was a basic assumption on which the contract was made, his remaining duties to render performance are discharged, unless the language or circumstances [of the contract] indicate the contrary.}}

A circumstance is not deemed to be a "basic assumption on which the contract is made" unless the change in circumstances could not have been reasonably foreseen at the time the contract was made. As a result, it is rarely invoked successfully. Successful invocations usually come in waves during times of substantial tumult, such as after the passage of [[Prohibition]], when bars and taverns no longer had a reason for their leases, or during major wars, when demand for many consumer goods and services drops far below what is normal.

If the defense is successfully invoked, the contract is terminated, and the parties are left as they are at the time of the litigation.

==In English law==
{{main|Frustration in English law}}
{{see also|Coronation cases}}

The [[English law| English]] case of ''[[Taylor v Caldwell]]'' established the doctrine of frustration, alleviating the potential harshness of "[[sanctity of contract]]".&lt;ref&gt;Beale (2002) p. 611&lt;/ref&gt; Here, two parties contracted on the hire of a [[Royal Surrey Gardens|music hall]], for the performance of concerts. Subsequent to contracting, but prior to the dates of hire, the music hall burned down. Since the contract was impossible to perform, [[Colin Blackburn, Baron Blackburn|Judge Blackburn]] held that the absolute liability set forth in ''[[Paradine v Jane]]'' would not apply here, as there was an [[Implied terms in English law|implied term]] that the music hall would be in existence at the date of the planned concerts.&lt;ref name=km1&gt;Koffman, Macdonald, p. 520&lt;/ref&gt; 

The requirement of "impossibility" in ''Taylor v Caldwell'' was modified in the 1903 case of ''[[Krell v Henry]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Krell v Henry]]'' [1903] 2 [[Kings Bench Law Reports|KB]] 740.&lt;/ref&gt; which concerned a party who had rented a room for the purpose of watching the [[Coronation of the British monarch|coronation procession]] of [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward VII]]. The king fell ill and the coronation was indefinitely postponed. The hirer refused to pay for the room, so the owner sued for [[breach of contract]]; and the hirer then countersued for the return of his £25 deposit. The court determined that the cancellation of the coronation was unforeseeable by the parties, and discharged the contract, leaving the parties as they were: the hirer lost his one-third deposit, and the owner lost the rest of the rent. The court reasoned that the doctrine of "impossibility" could not be applied in this case because it was technically been possible for the hirer to take possession of the flat and sit on the balcony. However, the owner knew the only reason the hirer would want to rent the flat was to watch the procession; had the hirer actually gone to the flat and sat on the balcony, he would have seen nothing of interest. Thus the purpose of the contract had been frustrated by an outside event (the King's illness and consequent cancellation of the parade), justifying termination (but not rescission) of the contract.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4288">'''Gibson Burrell''' (born 1948) is a British [[sociologist]] and [[organizational theorist]], and Professor of Organisation Theory at [[University of Leicester]]. He became known as writer of the 1979 book ''Sociological Paradigms and Organizational Analysis'' with [[Gareth Morgan (author)|Gareth Morgan]],&lt;ref name="MW03"&gt;[[Morgen Witzel]] (2003) ''Fifty key figures in management''. p.232-239&lt;/ref&gt; and is recognized for establishing a ''critical'' ''management'' school at the University of Leicester.&lt;ref&gt;Don Antunes, Howard Thomas (2007). "The Competitive (Dis)Advantages of European Business Schools", ''Long Range Planning,'' Volume 40, Issue 3, pp. 382-404.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and work ==
Burrell studied sociology at the [[University of Leicester]], where in 1974 he also completed his M.Phil. In 1980 he received his PhD at the [[University of Manchester]].

Burrell started his academic career as researcher at the [[University of Birmingham]]. In the late 1970s he was appointed Lecturer in the Department of Behaviour in Organizations at the [[University of Lancaster]]. In the mid-1980s he was appointed Professor of Organizational Behaviour at the [[University of Warwick]]. In 2002 he was appointed Professor of Organisation Theory at University of Leicester, where he headed its School of Management from 2002 to 2007. This was a radical hire by the Vice Chancellor, Sir Bob Burgess. Over the next few years, Gibson presided over the creation of a distinctive, radical and creative school. From nowhere, Leicester began to be talked about as one of the most exciting schools in Europe. Leicester was certainly one of the most interesting management schools during the noughties. According to the Carter / Mueller Dean index, Burrell ranks as the best Dean in the UK over the last two decades.

Burrell is co-editor of the international, interdisciplinary journal ''Organization'', together with [[Linda Smircich]], Marta Calàs, and Mike Reed.&lt;ref name="oxford"&gt;[http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/oso/public/content/oho_business/9780199275250/oxfordhb-9780199275250-chapter-23.html The Oxford Handbook of Organization Theory], At Home from Mars to Somalia: ''Recounting Organization Studies'' (Marta B. Calás, Linda Smircich)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 Burrell was elected an Academician for the Social Sciences (AcSS), and in 2014, with Gareth Morgan, he was awarded the Academy of Management Trailblazer Award for his contributions to organization and management theory.

'''Heinrich Gotthold Dietel''' (March 15, 1839 - June 24, 1911) was a German textile industry entrepreneur, with one of the largest contribution to [[Sosnowiec]] development.

He was born in [[Greiz]] as a son of Heinrich Gottlob Dietl, owner of spinning mills at [[Wilkau-Haßlau|Wilkau]], and Johann Wilhelmina Merbold. He traveled to the United States to examine the techniques of industrial wool production as well as conducting business. Together with his father and brothers he ran a factory in Wilkau near [[Zwickau]] in [[Saxony]]. He also practiced in [[Bohemia]] and [[Württemberg]].

In 1877 he began his studies at the [[Technical University of Dresden]]. On June 11, 1878 he married Julia Jacob in Leipzig. The same year he arrived in Sosnowiec with his wife as a result of the customs reform carried out a year earlier. On the land purchased from Gustav von Kramsty (Pogoń), he immediately proceeded to build the first Polish [[spinning (textiles)|spinning mill]] in Russian ruled Poland. He had five sons: Heinrich Georg, Henryk, Borys, Alfred, Roman and Boguslav. With the enlargement of the family, a new residence, the [[The Dietel Palace|Dietel Palace]], was built from 1890 to 1900. Heinrich Gotthold Dietel died in Sosnowiec, where he was also buried in a mausoleum at the Evangelical Cemetery.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11138">'''Help desk software''' refers to a [[computer program]] that enables customer-care operators keep track of user requests and deal with other customer-care-related issues. It is what makes customer-care service efficient and enterprising.&lt;ref name="PC1"&gt;{{cite news | last =Oliver | first =Haslam | title =The Best Help Desk Software of 2015 | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''Pcmag''| date =4 September 2015| url =https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2489457,00.asp | accessdate =11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, help desk software is part of an umbrella category called service desk, which includes asset management and IT service management. Oftentimes, the two terms are used interchangeably. Nevertheless, help desk software specifically refers to the system that addresses customer queries.&lt;ref name="FO"&gt;{{cite news | last =Oliver | first =Haslam | title =Types of Help Desk Software: Which One Will Suit Your Company Needs? | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''Finances Online''| date = | url =http://financesonline.com/types-of-help-desk-software-which-one-will-suit-your-company-needs/ | accessdate =11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, customer service and help desk software systems have become increasingly popular in recent times. According to a recent report, there is massive increase in sales of customer relationship management (CRM) software, which includes help desk software across the globe.
&lt;ref name="ITWC"&gt;{{cite news | last =Gary | first =Hilson | title =Canada lags U.S. in adopting help desk software as email, spreadsheets still prevail | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''IT World Canada''| date =23 July 2015 | url =http://www.itworldcanada.com/article/canada-lags-u-s-in-adopting-help-desk-software-as-email-spreadsheets-still-prevail/376078 | accessdate =11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The history of help desk software dates back to the 20th century when businesses relied mostly on face-to-face interaction to resolve customer issues. Customers had to visit a company’s store or office with the product to get their problems solved.&lt;ref name="CC"&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | title =History of Help Desk Software: Evolution and Future Trends | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''Compare Camp''| date = | url =http://comparecamp.com/history-of-help-desk-software-evolution-and-future-trends/ | accessdate =11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the invention of the telephone in 1876, and the telephone switchboard in the 1890s, help desk assumed a better approach. Customers were able to reach their company and voice out their problem over the phone system.&lt;ref name="CC"/&gt; During the 20th century era, companies used mainly equipment like dictation machines, typewriters, and dumb terminals with access to a [[mainframe computer]], to address customer issues. The earliest use of computers for customer service was done through the use of mainframe software. Customers would submit paper forms or communicate their issue by phone to customer service agents who would seek for avenues to handle the issues.&lt;ref name="CC"/&gt;

In the 1960s, companies began to set up call centers and also train staff to receive and handle customer enquiries in an organized and efficient manner. This was the era of [[Interactive voice response]] (IVR) which became a big boost to telephone customer service system.&lt;ref name="CC"/&gt; Later on, Desktop PCs and email significantly improved help desk systems. Customers could communicate their problems by email, bypassing paper forms. Help desk agents could provide status updates and resolutions by email as well.&lt;ref name="CC"/&gt;

Meanwhile, the actual introduction of help desk systems began in the 1980 when the internet was officially made available for public use.  Many companies started outsourcing their customer service department.  This led to massive use of email and live chat systems in the 1990s. This new development enabled several [[United States|US]] companies to outsource their help desk to low-cost countries like [[India]] and the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref name="CC"/&gt;

In any case the real invention of help desk software came in the 2000s when companies began to use diverse kind of software packages to deal with customer-care issues.  This led to the massive production of different kinds of help desk software programs across the internet and the world at large.&lt;ref name="CC"/&gt; In recent times, the internet and networked systems make help desk software more interactive and participatory for customers and the agents. Customer can now submit and track their issues more easily.&lt;ref name="CC"/&gt;

==Basic characteristics==
Help desk software automates customer services in diverse ways. It typically consists of at least three parts. These include Ticket Management, Automation Suite, and Reporting/Optimization.&lt;ref name="KY"&gt;{{cite news | last =Jammi | first =Nandini | title =What Is a Helpdesk? What Isn’t a Helpdesk? | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''Kayako''| date =27 January 2015 | url =https://www.kayako.com/blog/what-is-a-helpdesk/ | accessdate =16 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Help desk software has a point of contact for customers to send their queries and a ticketing system that tracks and organizes issues for faster resolution.&lt;ref name="FO"/&gt; It may also have a feature that aggregates and organizes queries and answers into a knowledge base, such as FAQs or guide articles. It may accommodate multiple points of contact; a working dashboard; and analytics section. It may also have a feature that allows agents to escalate issues to a higher level.&lt;ref name="FO"/&gt;

More advanced help desk applications  feature [[Online chat|online chat]], insights and analytics, automated processes, multiple contact channels, reporting tools, collaboration tools, and a CRM feature.&lt;ref name="FO"/&gt;

==Classifications==
Today help desk software is generally classified by its deployment, business size of the target users, or source code accessibility.&lt;ref name="FO"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | title =SaaS Help Desk Is A Must-Have | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''Cloud Tweaks''| date =16 July 2015 | url =http://cloudtweaks.com/2015/06/survey-says-saas-help-desk-is-a-must-have/ | accessdate =11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic types include:

* Web help desk software
* On-premises help desk software
* Enterprise help desk software
* Open-source help desk software
* Cloud based help desk software

Most brands and models of help desk software in use today fall in one of the classifications outlined above.

==Current trends==
Web-based and cloud-hosted help desk software packages are becoming very popular today. Social network channels are also being widely used as they are both interactive and allow for effective community support. The new generation of help desk software also offers real-time updates and uses remote desktop access.&lt;ref name="FO"/&gt;

==The future of help desk software==
With the massive increase in development and use of help desk software, the future holds more for companies that make use of these system.  Based on current trends, the future projection envisages the following points for the help desk software technology:&lt;ref name="CC"/&gt;

* Faster resolution of tickets
* Greater integration of cloud computing
* Greater support  for app and devices
* More use of the remote access methodology 
* Integration of better self-service resources and tools

==Benefits==
The following benefits are typically associated with help desk software:

* Today's help desk software handles complex databases of customer queries, profiles, call reports, resolution logs and service level agreements. A knowledge base, FAQ page, community or live chat can also be part of help desk software.&lt;ref name="FO"/&gt;
* Any business that uses [[webmail]] for support tends to resolve customer support issues quicker and sees an increase in support productivity when they switch to help desk software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Suzanne | first =Kattau | title =5 Tips: Pick the Right Help Desk Software for Your Small or Midsize Business | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''Pcmag''| date =4 September 2014 | url =https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2489868,00.asp | accessdate =11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | title =How to Find the Right Helpdesk Software to Turbo Charge Your Business | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''huffington Post''| date =2 December 2015 | url =http://www.huffingtonpost.com/andre-bourque/how-to-find-the-right-hel_b_6674220.html | accessdate =11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Help desk software automates tasks such as: ticket categorization and prioritization, ticket routing, alerts and notifications, ticket status management, and so on. With the right help desk solution, workload is cut down as many tasks such as issue tracking, assigning, and ticket management can be automated.&lt;ref name="CC"/&gt;
* Some cloud-based help desk software have built-in security features, such as HIPAA compliance if for handling US health care information, or GDPR compliance for accepting requests from persons located in the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Chloe | first =Green  | title =How to choose the right help desk software: a step-by-step guide | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''Information-age''| date =5 November 2015 | url =http://www.information-age.com/industry/software/123460446/how-choose-right-help-desk-software-step-step-guide | accessdate =11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disadvantages==
Despite benefits of help desk software, there are some disadvantages related to it as well, mainly:
* Many help desk software platforms have expensive upfront costs as well as time-consuming implementation periods, which can significantly drain company resources. While most offer a trial option, effectively trialing software is difficult and time consuming in a large organization. It's also difficult to evaluate software with a full volume of tickets and staff in a short period of time.
* On-premise help desks can have costs associated with maintenance, upgrades and scheduled downtime of servers, which are borne by the customer, not the help desk software provider.
* Cloud-based help desks can incur higher costs over longer periods of time.&lt;ref name="CC"/&gt; Cloud-based help desk software can become partially or entirely unavailable to users without an Internet connection. Consequently, unexpected disruptions in Internet connection may make such services temporarily unavailable.&lt;ref name="CC"/&gt;

Many of the problems listed above can easily be surmounted if proper research, planning and inquiries are made beforehand.&lt;ref name="CC"/&gt;

== Controversy ==
Ichikowitz has been criticised for being a "close ally" of the ruling [[African National Congress]] (ANC),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Stephan Hofstatter, Rob Rose And Mzilikazi Wa Afrika |url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/specialreports/stinvestigations/2013/03/27/arms-and-the-man-who-would-be-king |title=Arms and the man who would be king |publisher=Times LIVE |date= |accessdate=2013-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for providing President [[Jacob Zuma]] with an aircraft to use for an ANC fundraising and business trip to Lebanon and Kazakhstan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citypress.co.za/features/ivor-the-invincible-20101010/ |title=Ivor the invincible |publisher=City Press |date= |accessdate=2013-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2010-03-05-crony-capitalists-on-jzs-coattails |title=Crony capitalists on JZ's coat-tails &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; National &amp;#124; Mail &amp; Guardian |publisher=Mg.co.za |date=5 March 2010 |accessdate=2013-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another flight by Zuma to the United States on an aircraft owned by Ichikowitz in 2011 caused considerable controversy when the cost ([[South African rand|R]]6.3 million) was questioned in parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.iol.co.za/the-star/da-wants-answers-on-zuma-s-us-trip-1.1141559 |title=DA wants answers on Zuma's US trip – The Star |publisher=IOL.co.za |date=21 September 2011 |accessdate=2013-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official presidential aircraft, operated by the [[South African Air Force]], was not available for the flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ewn.co.za/2011/11/24/Zumas-R63m-US-flight |title=Eyewitness News: Zuma's R6.3m US flight |publisher=Ewn.co.za |date= |accessdate=2013-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://ewn.co.za/2011/09/20/More-questions-raised-over-Zumas-hired-jet |title=Eyewitness News: More questions raised over Zuma's hired jet |publisher=Ewn.co.za |date= |accessdate=2013-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.defenceweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=19294:zuma-flies-qair-ichikowitzq&amp;catid=35:Aerospace&amp;Itemid=107 |title=Zuma flies "Air Ichikowitz" |publisher=DefenceWeb |date=21 September 2011 |accessdate=2013-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ichikowitz has also been criticised for his involvement in the controversial [[Oil-for-Food Programme]] in the aftermath of the [[Gulf War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sareporter.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=490&amp;Itemid=41 |title=The arms dealer who flies Zuma |publisher=sareporter.com |date=13 March 2009 |accessdate=2013-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business dealings==
Picower was a [[Certified Public Accountant|certified public accountant]] and lawyer,&lt;ref name=MSNBC&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/31510209/ns/business-small_business// |title=Madoff may not have benefited most in scam |publisher=[[MSNBC]] |last=Bernstein |first=Jake |date=June 28, 2009 |accessdate=July 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but made most of his fortune by investing with Madoff.&lt;ref name=MSNBC/&gt;

As an accountant at Laventhol &amp; Horwath in the 1980s, Picower set up questionable [[tax shelter]]s.&lt;ref name=Forbes/&gt; When the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] challenged their validity, one of Picower's clients sued him and the firm.&lt;ref name=Forbes/&gt; The case was settled out of court.&lt;ref name=Forbes/&gt;

In 1983, Picower was rebuked by the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] for late disclosure of his greater than 5% position in a company involved in a merger.&lt;ref name=Forbes/&gt;

In 1991, Picower and [[Anthony Cerami]] established a charity, the Picower Institute for Medical Research,&lt;ref name=Forbes&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2002/1014/068_print.html |title=Unaccountable |last=McMenamin |first=Brigid |publisher=[[Forbes]] |date=October 14, 2002 |accessdate=July 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; with an initial endowment of $10 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/01/nyregion/noted-scientist-and-staff-leave-rockefeller-u.html?scp=3&amp;sq=Anthony%20Cerami&amp;st=cse |title=Noted Scientist And Staff Leave Rockefeller U. |last=Stevens |first=William K. |publisher=''[[New York Times]]'' |date=August 1, 1991 |accessdate=July 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers there, led by [[Kevin J. Tracey]], made a potentially valuable discovery, with possible applications in the treatment of [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[Crohn's disease]], and [[multiple sclerosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sptimes.com/News/122901/State/Foundations__founder_.shtml | title=Foundations' founder yet to donate $67-million |last=Jacoby |first=Mary |publisher=''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'' |date=December 29, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sptimes.com/News/070801/news_pf/Worldandnation/Complex_web_benefits_.shtml

However, it was revealed that Picower owned 76% of PharmaSciences stock and actually controlled 86.2%, putting him in a [[conflict of interest]] in the merger negotiations.&lt;ref name=Forbes/&gt;

After Physician Computer Network, Inc., went bankrupt, Picower, the chairman of the board and 45% shareholder, had to give $21 million to other shareholders in 2000&lt;ref name=Forbes/&gt; after it was discovered that company executives had falsified financial statements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://securities.stanford.edu/1012/PCNI98/ |title=Physician Computer Network, Inc. |publisher=Stanford Law School Securities Class Action Clearinghouse |accessdate=July 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alaris Medical Systems, 65% owned by Picower, was taken over by [[Cardinal Health]] in 2004 for $1.6 billion.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/20/business/20foundation.html |title=Foundation That Relied on Madoff Fund Closes |last=Fabrikant |first=Geraldine |publisher=''New York Times'' |date=December 19, 2008 |accessdate=July 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Picower was listed by ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine as one of the 400 richest people in the United States for 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/lists/2009/54/rich-list-09_The-400-Richest-Americans_Rank_16.html |title=The 400 Richest Americans 2009 |publisher=Forbes.com |date=September 30, 2009 |accessdate=December 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; his only time on the list. Forbes, which listed Picower at no. 371, placed his net worth at $1 billion, although the magazine acknowledged that the former lawyer and accountant is "likely worth billions more."&lt;ref name=CNN_Money&gt;{{cite web |url=http://money.cnn.com/2009/09/30/news/economy/richest_americans/index.htm

==Involvement with Bernard Madoff==
The Jeffry M. and Barbara Picower Foundation was created in 1989 by Picower and his wife Barbara.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; Barbara Picower was listed as Executive Director and trustee, with both Picowers being members of the [[board of directors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://investing.businessweek.com/businessweek/research/stocks/private/people.asp?privcapId=4923073 |title=Jeffry M. &amp; Barbara Picower Foundation |publisher=[[BusinessWeek]] |accessdate=July 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Longtime friend [[Bernard Madoff]] managed foundation assets listed at over $1 billion.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;&lt;ref name=Reuters&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSTRE4BJ1GB20081220?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=topNews |title=Charity Picower says closes from Madoff losses |last=Weinraub |first=Mark |publisher=[[Reuters]] |date=December 20, 2008 |accessdate=July 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It distributed over $268 million in grants to various American organizations, including [[Human Rights First]] and the [[New York Public Library]].&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;&lt;ref name=Reuters/&gt; In 2002, it granted $50 million to the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] neuroscience research center, which was subsequently renamed the [[Picower Institute for Learning and Memory]].&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/picower/about/index.html |title=The Picower Institute: About |publisher=[[MIT]] |accessdate=July 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Picower Foundation was forced to close in 2009 due to losses arising from the uncovering of Madoff's [[Ponzi scheme]].&lt;ref name=Reuters/&gt;

It has been reported that between December 1995 and December 2008, Picower and his family withdrew "from their various Madoff accounts $5.1 billion more than they invested."&lt;ref name="Propublica-withdrawals"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bernstein|first1=Jake|title=Madoff Client Jeffry Picower Netted $5 Billion—Likely More Than Madoff Himself|url=https://www.propublica.org/article/madoff-client-jeffry-picower-netted-5-billion|website=Propublica|accessdate=7 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
In June 2009, [[Irving Picard]], the trustee liquidating Madoff's assets, filed a lawsuit against Picower in the [[United States bankruptcy court|U.S. Bankruptcy Court]] for the Southern District of New York (Manhattan), seeking the return of $7.2 billion in profits, alleging that Picower and his wife knew or should have known that their rates of return were "implausibly high", with some accounts showing annual returns ranging from 120% to more than 550% from 1996 through 1998, and 950% in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idUSTRE54C4HW20090513 |title=Lawsuit claims Picower profits from Madoff $5 billion |author=Santosh Nadgir and Grant McCool |publisher=Reuters |date=May 13, 2009 |accessdate=July 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT2&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/13/business/13madoff.html |title=Billions Withdrawn Before Madoff Arrest |author=Diana B.

Zabel of Schulte Roth &amp; Zabel, responded that, "They were totally shocked by his fraud and were in no way complicit in it."&lt;ref name=NYT2/&gt;

On November 1, 2009, an additional court filing from the Madoff trustee documented an apparently fraudulent gain benefiting Picower.
"According to the new filing, Mr. Picower opened an account with Mr. Madoff on April 18, 2006, by wiring a check for $125 million, more than a quarter of the entire sum he invested with Mr. Madoff over time. Within two weeks, the $125 million deposit had purportedly grown to $164 million because of a dramatic ‘gain’ on the securities held in the account—all of which supposedly had been purchased three months earlier ... Five months later, Mr. Picower withdrew his original $125 million, leaving $81 million in the account. There is no legitimate explanation for these events nor any possibility that they escaped Picower’s notice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |

On 17 December 2010, it was announced that a settlement of $7.2 billion had been reached with the Picower estate to resolve the Madoff trustee suit, and repay losses in the Madoff fraud.  Madoff has suggested that Picower was allowed to remain as a client because he was "the Ponzi equivalent of a bank too big to fail: an investor too big to fire." It would have been impossible for Madoff to find enough cash to completely redeem his multi-billion account.&lt;ref name = settle&gt;Diana B. Henriques, "The Wizard of Lies" 2011 p.134&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
On October 25, 2009, Jeffry Picower died at his Palm Beach home. Picower's wife Barbara told dispatchers she found him "at the bottom of their swimming pool" at their oceanfront estate shortly after noon, Palm Beach police said. He was taken to [[Good Samaritan Medical Center (West Palm Beach, Florida)|Good Samaritan Medical Center]], where he was pronounced dead about 80 minutes later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aqEtoujbbNJI|title=Picower, Sued by Madoff Trustee, Died of Heart Attack (Update2)  |date=2009-10-26|publisher=bloomberg.com|accessdate=October 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Palm Beach Police Department, "An autopsy of the body of Jeffry M. Picower was performed this morning. The Palm Beach County Medical Examiner's Office determined that Mr. Picower suffered a massive heart attack while in the swimming pool resulting in accidental drowning."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.palmbeachpolice.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=communityalerts.one&amp;content_id=202&amp;x=9846618 |title=Death of Jeffry M.

In 2011, Barbara Picower resumed philanthropic activities, setting up a new foundation called the JPB Foundation with assets that remained from Jeffry Picower's estate following the legal settlement.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jpbfoundation.org/|title=JPB Foundation -|website=JPB Foundation|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Forbes'' reported that the foundation was established with a $100 million endowment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/nathanvardi/2014/09/09/barbara-picower-is-back-in-business-as-one-of-the-nations-top-philanthropists/#15d26a6849b2|title=Barbara Picower Is Back In Business As One Of The Nation's Top Philanthropists|last=Vardi|first=Nathan|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-04-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2018, the JPB Foundation has over $3.7 billion in total assets.

{{Spanish name|Hank|Rhon}}
'''Jorge Hank Rhon''' (born January 28, 1956) is a [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[businessman]] and owner of Mexico's largest [[sports betting]] company, ''Grupo Caliente''. He served from December 2004 to February 2007 as the [[presidente municipal|president]] of the [[municipio (Mexico)|municipality]] of [[Tijuana (municipality)|Tijuana]]. He is the son of former [[Head of Government of the Federal District|Mexico City mayor]] [[Carlos Hank González]] and Guadalupe Rhon. Hank is the father of professional [[tennis]] player [[Tigre Hank]] and of Matador [[Alejandro Amaya]].

==Biography==
Of German descent,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/mexico/family/bergman.html&lt;/ref&gt; Jorge Hank Rhon studied at the [[Colegio Alemán Alexander von Humboldt (Mexico City)|Alexander von Humboldt German College]] and [[Industrial Engineering]] at the [[Universidad Anáhuac]] in the [[State of Mexico]]. In 1980 he founded the [[Grupo Taos]], a company that operates pet stores and amusement parks of which he is the President of the Board and General Director. He moved to Tijuana in 1985 to manage the [[Agua Caliente Racetrack]] and formed the [[Grupo Caliente]] which includes the [[dog racing]] track, a hotel, a mall and a network of entertainment centers in 19 [[states of Mexico]] as well as 13 countries of [[Central America|Central]], [[South America]] and [[Europe]]. The number of employees of the racetrack grew from 700 to close to 6,000. During his management Tijuana has hosted the [[Señorita México]] pageant, the World Boxing title fight between [[Julio César Chávez]] and [[Danilo Cabrera]] and from 1986 to 1988 the Caribe International Classic Horserace, considered the most important in [[Latin America]]. The Racetrack also hosts the Day of the Three Wise Men, Children's Day, Mother's Day where thousands of children and their mothers receive free food, gifts and an entertainment show since 1988. Hank also created the [[Cuauhtémoc Hank Foundation]] to give scholarships to students of all grades including studies in foreign schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jorgehank.com.mx/indexMain.php Official Campaign site]&lt;/ref&gt; On April 20, 1988 a local newspaper columnist, Hector "El Gato" Felix Miranda was assassinated on his way to work. The gunmen turned out to be security guards at the Caliente track, and one had worked as well for Hank Rhon's father, Carlos Hank. To this day the independent newsweekly in Tijuana, ZETA, runs a full page ad with white letters: "Jorge Hank: Why did your bodyguards assassinate me?" 'El Gato' had been a fierce critic of the Hank family.&lt;ref name="PBS"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/mexico/family/bergman.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaign for municipal president==
Hank won the [[Tijuana]] mayoral race of 2004, beating [[National Action Party (Mexico)|PAN]] candidate [[Jorge Ramos (politician)|Jorge Ramos]] by a slim margin, thus ending 15 years of PAN government in Tijuana. 

==Mayor of Tijuana==
The most notable infrastructure improvement in Tijuana during the Hank administration was the multi-million investment on an underpass at the ''Alba Roja'' intersection, just south of the ''5 y 10'' intersection. The ''5 y 10'' intersection is one of the most famous in the city and with the heaviest traffic. The investment was for a figure close to 45 million pesos, more than four million dollars.&lt;ref name="Alba Roja"&gt;[http://www.oem.com.mx/elsoldetijuana/notas/n176162.htm El Sol de Tijuana], February 19, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 8, 2005 the Hank administration inaugurated the five million pesos&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bajacalifornia.gob.mx/portal/gobierno/finanzas/obra_pub/C4_tij.jsp Government of Baja California] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928093528/http://www.bajacalifornia.gob.mx/portal/gobierno/finanzas/obra_pub/C4_tij.jsp |date=2007-09-28 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Center of Communication, Control, Computing and Command]] (C4) that included 60 [[High-definition video|high definition]] cameras.&lt;ref name="C4"&gt;[http://www.tijuana.gob.mx/Apps/AppsPublico/Comunicados/VerComunicado.asp?ID=546 Government of Tijuana] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610155750/http://www.tijuana.gob.mx/Apps/AppsPublico/Comunicados/VerComunicado.asp?ID=546 |date=2007-06-10 }}, February 1, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In order the reduce kidnappings, a problem of Tijuana for many years, the municipal government started a program of installing [[GPS]] devices on the cars of potential victims.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laprensa-sandiego.org/archieve/2006/september29-06/policia.htm La Prensa San Diego], September 29, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, a program of [[road safety camera]]s was introduced in Tijuana that issued speeding tickets in which some drivers received up to 800 tickets issued the same day, same time, and on the same location.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frontera.info/EdicionEnLinea/Notas/Otras/28022007/224499.aspx Frontera] February 28, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hank administration produced significant urban development but failed to significantly reduce crime&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.panoramadebc.com/carta-del-editor-mar07.html Panorama de Baja California] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927080303/http://www.panoramadebc.com/carta-del-editor-mar07.html |date=2007-09-27 }}, March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the Operation Tijuana of the Federal Government only momentarily reduced serious crimes and ordinary crimes increased 40%&lt;ref name="OperativoTijuana"&gt;[http://www.frontera.info/EdicionEnLinea/Notas/Noticias/07052007/236102.aspx Frontera], May 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and it was detected corruption amongst the federal forces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.univision.com/content/content.jhtml?cid=1078057 Univision] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006021732/http://www.univision.com/content/content.jhtml?cid=1078057 |date=2008-10-06 }}, January 22, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The operation was then extended to the five municipalities of the state and dubbed [[Operation Baja California]], per request of the governor [[Eugenio Elorduy Walther]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frontera.info/edicionenlinea/notas/Noticias/26042007/233976.aspx Frontera] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070510035725/http://www.frontera.info/edicionenlinea/notas/Noticias/26042007/233976.aspx |date=2007-05-10 }}, Abril 26, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 20, 2007 Hank requested a license to leave his post as mayor. The license was approved by nine PRI representatives with six PAN representatives rejecting the license and one PRD representative abstaining from voting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2007/02/20/index.php?section=estados&amp;article=035n1est Jornada], February 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple billboards reporting Hank actions as mayor were put out after the annual report and PAN representative complained and offered to remove the PAN-sponsored radio spots on fighting radar camera-issued tickets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oem.com.mx/elsoldetijuana/notas/n185923.htm El Sol de Tijuana], February 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Run for governor of Baja California==
At the end of 2006, Jorge Hank expressed his wishes to run a campaign for the [[Baja California state election, 2007|2007 Baja California state election]].
This flared up comments from PAN politicians&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lacronica.com/edicionenlinea/notas/Nacional/23122006/213400.aspx PAN confident that the ''Anti-grasshopper law'' will be reversed] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927070052/http://www.lacronica.com/edicionenlinea/notas/Nacional/23122006/213400.aspx |date=2007-09-27 }}, La Crónica December 23, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; saying that he would be violating the state's ''Antichapulin'' ("anti-[[grasshopper]]") law which prohibits a person of public office to "jump" from one charge to another without ending their current term.

In February 2007 he requested permission from leaving his post as municipal president to accept the candidacy for governor by the ''Alianza para que vivas mejor'' ([[The Alliance So You May live better]]), which was approved by his party's [[regidor]]es and denied by the PAN [[regidor]]es. The PAN also accused five district electoral council members of partiality towards Hank because they served as judges during his administration as president of Tijuana. The Federal Electoral Tribune rejected the complaint determining that the law does not have such restriction that would prevent these five lawyers from serving as judges and then as council members&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/423027.html Desecha tribunal queja de PAN sobre Hank Rohn], El Universal, May 5, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 20, 2007, Baja California's state elections court voted 2 to 1 in favor of the validity of the so-called "anti grasshopper law" thus cancelling Hank's bid for Governor. He appealed the decision before the [[Federal Electoral Tribunal]], which unanimously ruled to uphold his candidacy on July 7, holding that the state law contravened the electoral and political rights of the citizenry. Pending that decision, Hank was not a registered candidate and had to abstain from campaigning. The election date was Sunday August 5, 2007.

According to the Baja California's State Electoral Institute, Jorge Hank lost the election by 8 points (almost 55,000 votes) against Jose Guadalupe Osuna Millan, PAN's candidate.

The '''National Historic Route 66 Federation''' was founded in 1995 for the purpose of saving the businesses, communities and roadbed of [[U.S. Route 66]]. The famous road carried travelers across much of the country from the day it was commissioned on November 11, 1926 through June 25, 1985 when it was decommissioned.

==Historical background==
Since its construction, most motorists preferred to travel that way because the weather tended to be more hospitable than along the more northerly highways. Businesses and entire towns sprang up to cater to the ever-increasing traffic. Although it brought considerable prosperity, the thoroughfare also spawned bumper-to-bumper congestion in the communities and numerous accidents on the rural stretches leading to the gruesome nickname, “Bloody 66”.

Just as it seemed the mostly two lane road could not handle another vehicle, on June 29, 1956, President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] signed the [[Interstate Highway Act]] into law, which allocated $25 billion for the construction of {{convert|41000|mi|km}} of interstate highways. Over the next 29 years, section after section of Route 66 was methodically bypassed by multi-lane, high speed [[Limited-access road|expressways]] enabling motorists to increase their speeds and avoid hazardous congestion. This was a time-saving advantage to those on the move, but a distinct disadvantage to businesses and communities along the Route. Where customers once thronged, they rarely showed up at all, anymore.

==Inspiring the Federation==
By 1994, Route 66 was well on its way to becoming little more than miles of memories. Unaware of these declining conditions, in August of that year, David and Mary Lou Knudson set out to relive their early experiences along the legendary road. Mary Lou remembered traveling it during [[World War II]] with her parents as her father, a [[U.S. Air Force]] Sergeant, drove between several bases in Illinois and California. David remembered the trip he made in 1963 to move from Detroit to Los Angeles as being like a “2,400 mile carnival”. But this time, they couldn’t even find the famous byway. They soon discovered it was no longer a [[U.S. Highway]] and was not on their map as “US 66”. So the Knudsons stopped at a [[truck stop]] west of Chicago to ask where it was, and the clerk sold them the “Here It Is” map set which guided them to and along the original road.

The moment they got on what was once Route 66, the Knudsons realized that something was very wrong. The once colorful and often gaudy trading posts, side shows, rare animal displays, [[motel]]s and cafés were gone. In their place was mile after mile of roadside that was little more than boarded up buildings. Many stretches of roadbed were poorly maintained or completely closed to traffic. Entire  towns that were once bustling tourist meccas were all but shut down.

They were saddened by the deterioration of such an important American icon; so much so, they decided to do something about it. As they traveled, they photographed many of the buildings and [[Tape recorder|tape recorded]] captions for each of their locations. They had planned to take a week to travel to their home in Los Angeles but that turned into 3 weeks. They arrived home laden with hundreds of photos and several tapes of captions. On the trip, David decided to sell the shares in his business and commit his time to developing a nonprofit corporation that would work to save Route 66.

==Establishing the federation==
To that end, the Knudson’s first step was to contact the gentleman who had prepared the Route 66 map set they had used to cross the country. He directed them to the [[National Park Service]] office in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] where they had prepared a study of the Route for [[United States Senator|Senators]] [[Pete Domenici]] (R) and [[Jeff Bingaman]] (D). Between the Knudsons, the Senators and New Mexico Congresswoman [[Heather Wilson]] (R) a [[Bill (law)|Congressional Bill]] was drafted that would help fund the restoration of the famous highway. In 1999, the "National Route 66 Preservation Bill" was passed by the [[United States Congress]] and signed into law by President [[Bill Clinton]]. The act provides $10 million in matching fund grants to individuals, corporations and communities for the purpose of preserving or restoring historic properties along Route. To this day, David Knudson sits on the grant committee.

Acquiring the funds for restoration through the Bill was the first tangible step toward the renaissance. Although restoration dollars were essential to the Knudson’s plans and hopes, bringing in tourists to patronize the businesses was every bit as important. This is where David’s advertising and publicity background came into play. He launched a worldwide campaign to turn the Route into a tourist destination. To this day, it is estimated that 40% of the business the Route generates comes from countries other than the U. S.

==The John Steinbeck Awards==
Then came the Federation’s [[John Steinbeck]] Awards evenings. The purpose of these events was threefold:
#Present the “John Steinbeck Award” to an individual who had contributed significantly to the preservation of Route 66.
#Bring Route 66 historians, authors, artists, photographers, business people and enthusiasts together to network and meet to discuss what could be done to preserve the road.
#Introduce these people to various Route 66 communities and conversely, familiarize citizens within these host communities with the importance of the Route.

The first John Steinbeck Awards Evening was scheduled for May, 1995 in [[Oklahoma City]]. The [[Oklahoma City bombing|bombing of the Murrah building]] on April 19 put an end to those plans. The Federation suffered significant financial loss as a result, and it was not until October 1998 that a John Steinbeck Awards Evening took place; this time in [[Kingman, Arizona]]. From that year on, the evenings were produced annually in one Route 66 community after another until the last one in [[San Bernardino, California]] in September 2005. By that time, Route 66 communities were vying to have the evenings and they would build three-day, communitywide Route 66 celebrations around them. Shortly after that last event, Mary Lou Knudson suffered a debilitating [[stroke]] and died three years later. She had been the one who managed the myriad of details involved in producing the large events.

==Promoting Route 66==
As the popularity of Route 66 grew around the world, an increasing number of tourists began driving the road and enjoying its history and sights, however most of them were not enjoying the vintage dining and lodging establishments that were so much the essence of early roadside [[Americana]]. The majority of travelers were staying in and eating in chain establishments that were familiar to them. The Knudsons had become acquainted with many of the owners of the vintage businesses and knew that most of their facilities were at least as clean and as well run as the chains. They were also usually much less expensive.

In order to introduce the public to the family-owned, vintage enterprises, the first “Route 66 Dining &amp; Lodging Guide” was published in 1999. It was, and still is prepared from reviews conducted by the “Adopt-A-Hundred” adopters. The Federation’s “Adopt-A-Hundred” Program was initially developed to keep an eye on possible preservation problems along the Route such as a bridge, a business or a stretch of roadbed being closed. Adopters canvassed their {{convert|100|mi|km|adj=on}} sections once a year watching for preservation trouble. So, the adopters were asked to review the dining and lodging businesses while they traveled their sections. The current edition is the 14th and includes over 500 mostly vintage businesses.

&lt;!-- Over the years, Route 66 acquired several nicknames and marketing titles, probably the most notable being, “The Mother Road” which John Steinbeck coined  in his epic novel, “[[The Grapes Of Wrath]]”. Others included, “The Main Street Of America", "The Glory Road", the "[[Will Rogers]] Highway", "The Fair Weather Highway",and "Bloody 66". In addition to the various names, it also acquired many different alignments. One extreme case is the two alignments in New Mexico—one traveling a virtually horizontal east-to-west path through Albuquerque, the other wending its way {{convert|60|mi|km}} north through Santa Fe. Yet, it was the alignments that only varied by a few miles or even blocks that often lost first-time traveling enthusiasts. It is to be noted here that U. S. 66 road signs do exist along some of the more popular alignments of the road but sporadically, at best. (This appears to be an after-the-fact addition that duplicates material in the Route 66 main article.) --&gt;

==Map guide==

With the intent of making it as easy as possible for travelers to find the most popular alignments, the Federation commissioned Route 66 artist, historian and cartographer, Jerry McClanahan to produce a map guide. The product, introduced in 2005, was the 200 page, spiral bound EZ66 GUIDE For Travelers. It is now in its 3rd edition.

'''New Public Administration''' is an [[Antipositivism|anti-positivist]], anti-technical, and anti-hierarchical reaction against [[Public administration#History|traditional public administration]]. A practiced theory in response to the ever changing needs of the public and how institutions and administrations go about solving them. Focus is on the role of government and how they can provide these services to citizens in which are a part of public interest, by means, but not limited to public policy.

== History  ==
New Public Administration traces its origins to the first Minnowbrook Conference held in 1968 under the patronage of [[Dwight Waldo]]. This conference brought together the top scholars in public administration and management to discuss and reflect on the state of the field and its future.&lt;ref&gt;O'Leary, Rosemary. &amp; Slyke, David M. Van. &amp; Kim, Soonhee. The Future of Public Administration around the World: The Minnowbrook Perspective. Washington, DC: Georgetown University Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1960s in the USA was a time of [[1960s#Social and political movements|unusual social and political turbulence and upheaval]].  In this context, Waldo concluded that neither the study nor the practice of public administration was responding suitably to the escalating turmoil and the complications that arose from those conditions. Part of the reasoning for this Waldo argued, was the general mistrust that had become associated with public administration itself.  A call to revamp the ethical obligations of the service sector was necessary in rebuilding the public's trust of government and bureaucracy in which had been plagued by corruption and the narrow self interests of others.  Moving toward a more ethical public service, then, required attention to the underlying values that support public service-and public servants-in any sector.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Getha-Taylor|first=Heather|title=Where's (Dwight) Waldo?|journal=Public Performance &amp; Management Review|date=June 2009|volume=32|series=No. 4|pages=574–578|doi=10.2753/pmr1530-9576320406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[new public management]](npm) did not offer public servants an alternative model to help them resolve emerging conflicts and tensions. Concepts of citizenship, democracy or public interest have evolved over time and they are continuing to evolve. Consequently, the role of government and the role of the public service are being transformed in ways that push beyond the constraints of the Classic model he lenses of varying perspectives can challenge, clarify, and create a history that boasts enough depth to serve as not only a history in a traditional sense but also an interactive timeline that ignites constant improvement. At its core, public service requires a vision that extends beyond narrow self-interest.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Waldo sees public administration and bureaucracy as integrally bound to civilization and to our culture in two senses: the evolution of civilization itself was dependent upon public administration and related concepts are constitutive elements within out specific civilization and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Martini|first=Frank|title=Leaders in the Field: Dwight Waldo|journal=Public Administration Review|date=1993|volume=53|series=September/October|issue=5|pages=409–418|doi=10.2307/976341|jstor=976341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''New Public Administration theory deals with the following issues''':
* '''Democratic citizenship'''; Refers directly to the belief in creating a government where the "common man" has a voice in politics. For such an approach to work, citizens must become aware, knowledgeable, and active in their communities and nations. True democratic citizenship requires more than voting for representatives. It requires using one's own mind, voice, and actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chilcoat,G.W.|first=&amp; Ligon J.A.|title="It is democratic citizens we are after:" The curriculum orientation of Shirley H. Engle's approach to social studies education.|journal=Submitted to the International Journal of Social Education|date=February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''Public interest'''; Refers to the collective common good within society, to which is the main objective of public     interest. 
* '''Public policy'''; The means by which new public policy is enacted, and introduced. Not limited in participation of the public but encouraged involvement.  
*'''Services to citizens'''; Providing and upholding the moral and ethical standard in regards to meeting the needs of citizens  through institutions and bureaucracies.

First, a ‘new’ theory should start with the ideal of democratic citizenship. The public service derives its true meaning from its mandate to serve citizens to advance the public good. This is the raison d’être of the institution, the source of motivation and pride of all those who choose to make it their life, whether for a season or for an entire career.

== Main Features of new public administration ==
These are:
# '''Responsiveness''': The administration should bring about certain internal as well as external changes so that public administration could be made more relevant to the social, economic, political and technological environment. For this to happen the administration has to be more flexible and adaptable to the various changes.
# '''Client Centricity''': this means that the effectiveness of the administrator should be judged not only from the point of view of the government, but from that of the citizens. If the administrative actions did not improve the quality of life of citizens then they are not effective notwithstanding whatsoever rationality and efficiency they may have.
# '''Structural Changes in Administration''': the new public administration approach calls for small, flexible and less hierarchical structures In administration so that the citizens administration interface could become more flexible and comfortable. The organizational structure should be in with the socially relevant conditions.
# '''Multi-disciplinary Nature of Public Administration''': knowledge from several disciplines and not just one dominating paradigm build the discipline of public administration. The political, social, economic, management and human relation approaches are needed to ensure the growth of discipline.
# '''[[Politics-Administration Dichotomy]]''' since administrators today are involved in policy formulation and policy implementation at all the stages. Dichotomy meaning "a division or contrast between two things that are or are represented as being opposed or entirely different".
# '''Awareness''': Bring attention to the works of a public administration and the task that public administrators carry out for the community and for the government. Jobs of public administrators affect communities and large numbers of people. The importance of the job should be highlighted.
# '''Case Studies''': Case studies help public administrators highlight situations and events where policies were not carried out as they should be. They set an example for what to do and what not to do. Case studies are a basic way to break down events in order to learn from other people’s mistakes and the affects those mistakes have had on the community. With public administration being a job devoted to the people; it is an obvious way to see the reality of the work you do in the community. While there are many cases where policies were not carried out as planned. There are also plenty of examples of executed policies that have benefited communities, and those are important to look at as well.
# '''Structure Change''': Public Administration is moving is many different directions, it is more often called Public Management now. This is because the job is moving towards a direction of not only implementing policy to people but also managing policies as it trickles down through the law process, so that it is realistic for communities and the people in them.
# '''Jack of All Trades''': the best public administrators tend to be someone who has knowledge in politics and law, but also has a hand in community functions. This allows for a smooth transition from policy to implementation.
# '''Change''': With the changes in the world, the job of public administration has changed. The job may be the same, but titles like Public Manager and Public Adviser have replaced the title Public Administrator.

== Themes ==
#'''Relevance''': Traditional public administration has too little interest in contemporary problems and issues. Social realities must be taken into consideration. i.e. people should see changes as relevant meaning thereby that changes should be specific to the needs of the area and the need of the people. Earlier approaches to NPA considered that rationality of the people was neglected. NPA suggests the inclusion of rationality of the people too in the process of policy formulation.
#'''Values''': Value-neutrality in public administration is an impossibility. The values being served through administrative action must be transparent.To practice transparency in public administration is to ensure citizens the availability of information which is deemed public. This should be an organizational goal, and is to be taken into account when conducting all public business regardless of one’s job title. If the goal of an organization is to serve the citizens to the best of their ability, then avoiding or failing to achieve transparency would cause significant damage to the relationship between them and the people they are aiming to serve.
#'''[[Social equity|Social Equity]]''': Realization of social equity should be a chief goal of public administration.
#'''Change''': Skepticism toward the deeply rooted powers invested in permanent institutions and the status quo. Operational flexibility and organisational adaptability to meet the environmental changes should be in-built in the administrative system.
#'''Client Focus''': Positive, proactive, and responsive administrators rather than inaccessible and authoritarian "[[ivory tower]]" bureaucrats.
#'''Management-Worker relations.''' There should be equal emphasis both on efficiency and humane considerations. The new approach has to satisfy both the efficiency and the human relations criterion in order to achieve success.

NPA provides solutions for achieving these goals, popularly called 4 D's i.e. Decentralisation, Debureaucratisation, Delegation and Democratisation.

== Criticism ==
Though New Public Administration brought public administration closer to political science, it was criticized as anti-theoretic and anti-management. Robert T. Golembiewski describes it as radicalism in words and status quo in skills and technologies. Further, it must be counted as only a cruel reminder of the gap in the field between aspiration and performance. Golembiewski considers it as a temporary and transitional phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Golembiewski|first=Robert|title=Public Administration as a Developing Discipline|date=1 August 1977|publisher=CRC Press|location=New York, New York|pages=118–246}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, we can say that the solutions for achieving the goals and anti-goals were not provided by the NPA scholars explicitly. Secondly, how much one should decentralize or delegate or debureaucratize or democratize in order to achieve the goals? On this front NPA is totally silent.

As said in ''A New Synthesis of Public Administration,'' governments have always been called upon to make difficult decisions, undertake complicated initiatives and face complex problems characteristics of the period. This is not in dispute. Nonetheless, the current circumstances is to determine what can be handled in the traditional way and what must be done differently.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.2307/973347|jstor=973347|title=Needed: New Expertise in Public Administration|journal=Public Administration Review|volume=27|issue=4|pages=321|year=1967|last1=Banovetz|first1=James M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Governments have always been called upon to face difficult problems. Setting priorities and making choices have always been difficult. For example, eliminating a sizable deficit is “merely” a difficult problem, although it is hard to believe when one is in the middle of such a heart-wrenching exercise. This entails making choices among equally deserving public purposes and making tough decisions about what should be preserved for the future. It requires reconciling future needs with what could garner a sufficient degree of public support in the short term to move forward. Academic public administration has lagged considerably behind practicing public administration. Improved curricula and a refocusing of emphasis upon the policy dynamics of government administration will be important factors in enticing more students to study of public administration. It is more important to increase the number and improving the geographic spread of universities with public affairs programs, integrating public affairs components into the curricula of other graduate and professional programs, developing many more in-service, mid-career educational programs for public servants, and utilizing existing resources to strengthen public affairs programs.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

The motives behind the promotion of New Public Administration is also in question in the case of [[Hong Kong]]. As [[Anthony Cheung]] argues, officials often employed the rhetoric of New Public Administration to roll back public expenditure and decrease welfare provision in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Cheung | first=Anthony B. L. |date= 1996 | title=Efficiency As the Rhetoric: Public-Sector Reform in Hong Kong Explained | journal=[[International Review of Administrative Sciences]] | volume= 62 | issue=  | pages=43 | url= | accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Governors at that time used the excuse of administrative efficiency to curtail the power of the bureaucracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Cheung | first=Anthony B. L. |date= 1992 | title=Public Sector Reform in Hong Kong: Perspectives and Problems | journal=Asian Journal of Public Administration | volume= 14 | issue=2 | pages=141 | url= | accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significance ==
[[Felix A. Nigro|Felix]] and [[Lloyd Nigro]] observe that New Public Administration has seriously jolted the traditional concepts and outlook of the discipline and enriched the subject by imparting a wider perspective by linking it closely to the society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nigro|first=Lloyd|title=New Public Personnel Administration|date=2014|publisher=Cengage Learning|location=Boston, MA|isbn=1133734286|pages=320}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The overall focus in NPA movement seems to be to make administration to be less "generic" and more "public", less "descriptive" and more "prescriptive", less "institution-oriented" and more "client-oriented", less "neutral" and more "normative" but should be no less scientific all the same.

[[File:OLAP Cube.svg|thumb|An example of an OLAP cube]]

In database engineering in computing, '''OLAP cube''' is a term that typically refers to a multi-dimensional [[array data structure|array]] of data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |author1=Gray, Jim |author2=Bosworth, Adam | author3=Layman, Andrew | author4=Pirahesh, Hamid |title=Data Cube: A Relational Aggregation Operator Generalizing Group-By, Cross-Tab, and Sub-Totals | booktitle=Proceedings of the International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE) | year=1996 | pages=152–159 | url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/492099/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''OLAP'' is an acronym for '''[[online analytical processing]]''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://support.office.com/en-us/article/overview-of-online-analytical-processing-olap-15d2cdde-f70b-4277-b009-ed732b75fdd6 |title=Overview of Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) |publisher=support.office.com |accessdate=2018-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a computer-based technique of analyzing data to look for insights. The term ''cube'' here refers to a multi-dimensional
dataset, which is also sometimes called a [[hypercube]] if the number of dimensions is greater than 3.

== Terminology ==
A cube can be considered a multi-dimensional generalization of a two- or three-dimensional [[spreadsheet]].  For example, a company might wish to summarize financial data by product, by time-period, and by city to compare actual and budget expenses.  Product, time, city and scenario (actual and budget) are the data's dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.postgresql.org/about/news.653 | title=Cybertec releases OLAP cubes for PostgreSQL | publisher=PostgreSQL | date=2006-10-02 | accessdate=2008-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Cube'' is a shorthand for ''multidimensional dataset'', given that data can have an arbitrary number of ''[[Dimension (data warehouse)|dimensions]]''. The term [[hypercube]] is sometimes used, especially for data with more than three dimensions. A cube is not a "cube" in the strict mathematical sense, as all the sides are not necessarily equal. But this term is used widely.

''Slice'' is a term for a dimension which is held constant for all cells so that multi-dimensional information can be shown in a two-dimensional physical space of a [[spreadsheet]] or [[pivot table]].

Each cell of the cube holds a number that represents some ''measure'' of the business, such as sales, profits, expenses, budget and forecast.

OLAP data is typically stored in a [[star schema]] or [[snowflake schema]] in a [[relational database|relational]] [[data warehouse]] or in a special-purpose data management system. Measures are derived from the records in the [[fact table]] and dimensions are derived from the [[dimension table]]s.

== Hierarchy ==
The elements of a dimension can be organized as a [[hierarchy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lorentzcenter.nl/awcourse/oracle/server.920/a96520/glossary.htm#432038 | title=Oracle9i Data Warehousing Guide hierarchy | publisher=Lorentz Center | accessdate=2008-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a set of parent-child relationships, typically where a parent member summarizes its children. Parent elements can further be aggregated as the children of another parent.&lt;ref name=OLAPGlossary1995&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.olapcouncil.org/research/glossaryly.htm | title=OLAP and OLAP Server Definitions | publisher=The OLAP Council | year=1995 | accessdate=2008-03-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, May 2005's parent is Second Quarter 2005 which is in turn the child of Year 2005.  Similarly cities are the children of regions; products roll into product groups and individual expense items into types of expenditure.

== Operations ==
Conceiving data as a cube with hierarchical dimensions leads to conceptually straightforward operations to facilitate analysis. Aligning the data content with a familiar visualization enhances analyst learning and productivity.&lt;ref name=OLAPGlossary1995/&gt; The user-initiated process of navigating by calling for page displays interactively, through the specification of slices via rotations and drill down/up is sometimes called "slice and dice".  Common operations include slice and dice, drill down, roll up, and pivot.

[[File:OLAP slicing.png|thumb|OLAP slicing|350x350px]]
''Slice'' is the act of picking a rectangular subset of a cube by choosing a single value for one of its dimensions, creating a new cube with one fewer dimension.&lt;ref name=OLAPGlossary1995/&gt; The picture shows a slicing operation: The sales figures of all sales regions and all product categories of the company in the year 2005 and 2006 are "sliced" out of the data cube.

{{Clear}}
[[File:OLAP dicing.png|thumb|OLAP dicing|350x350px]]
''Dice'': The dice operation produces a subcube by allowing the analyst to pick specific values of multiple dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~zaiane/courses/cmput690/glossary.html | title=Glossary of Data Mining Terms | publisher=University of Alberta | year=1999 | accessdate=2008-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The picture shows a dicing operation: The new cube shows the sales figures of a limited number of product categories, the time and region dimensions cover the same range as before.

{{Clear}}
[[File:OLAP drill up&amp;down.png|thumb|alt=OLAP-functionalities|OLAP Drill-up and drill-down|350x350px]]
''Drill Down/Up'' allows the user to navigate among levels of data ranging from the most summarized (up) to the most detailed (down).&lt;ref name=OLAPGlossary1995/&gt;
The picture shows a drill-down operation: The analyst moves from the summary category "Outdoor-Schutzausrüstung" to see the sales figures for the individual products.

{{Clear}}
''Roll-up'': A roll-up involves summarizing the data along a dimension. The summarization rule might be computing totals along a hierarchy or applying a set of formulas such as "profit = sales - expenses".&lt;ref name=OLAPGlossary1995/&gt;

{{Clear}}
[[File:OLAP pivoting.png|thumb|OLAP pivoting|350x350px]]
''[[Pivot table|Pivot]]'' allows an analyst to rotate the cube in space to see its various faces. For example, cities could be arranged vertically and products horizontally while viewing data for a particular quarter. Pivoting could replace products with time periods to see data across time for a single product.&lt;ref name=OLAPGlossary1995/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.answers.com/topic/multidimensional-views?cat=technology | title=Computer Encyclopedia: multidimensional views |publisher=Answers.com | accessdate=2008-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The picture shows a pivoting operation: The whole cube is rotated, giving another perspective on the data.

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; an abstract representation of a [[projection (relational algebra)|projection]] of an [[RDBMS]] relation. Given a [[relation (database)|relation]] of order ''N'', consider a projection that subtends ''X'', ''Y'', and ''Z'' as the key and ''W'' as the [[Errors and residuals in statistics|residual]] [[Attribute (computing)|attribute]]. Characterizing this as a [[function (mathematics)|function]],

:''f'' : (''X'',''Y'',''Z'') → ''W'',

the attributes ''X'', ''Y'', and ''Z'' correspond to the axes of the cube, while the ''W'' value corresponds to the data element that populates each cell of the cube.

Insofar as two-dimensional output devices cannot readily characterize three dimensions, it is more practical to project "slices" of the data cube (we say ''project'' in the classic vector analytic sense of dimensional reduction, not in the [[SQL]] sense, although the two are conceptually similar),

:''g'' : (''X'',''Y'') → ''W''

which may suppress a primary key, but still have some semantic significance, perhaps a slice of the triadic functional representation for a given ''Z'' value of interest.

The motivation&lt;ref name=DataCubeGray1995/&gt; behind [[OLAP]] displays harks back to the ''cross-tabbed report'' paradigm of 1980s [[DBMS]], and to earlier [[contingency table]]s from 1904. The resulting spreadsheet-style display, where values of ''X'' populate row $1; values of ''Y'' populate column $A; and values of ''g'' : ( ''X'', ''Y'' ) → ''W'' populate the individual cells "southeast of" $B2, so to speak, $B2 itself included.

'''Peter Hanbury Masfen''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|CNZM}} (born 9 August 1941) is a New Zealand businessman, philanthropist, and former representative [[Rowing (sport)|rower]]. Regarded as one of the country's most astute businessmen, he is best known for his former shareholding in [[Montana Wines]].

==Private life==
Masfen was born in 1941 in [[Auckland]], New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Peter Masfen |url=http://www.olympic.org.nz/athletes/peter-masfen/ |publisher=[[New Zealand Olympic Committee]] |accessdate=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received his schooling at [[King's School (Auckland)|King's School]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Old Boys |url=http://kings.school.nz/old-boys/ |accessdate=7 September 2016 |work=[[King's School (Auckland)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then [[King's College, Auckland|King's College]] in Auckland.&lt;ref name="Many a reserve"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Fletcher |first1=Hamish |title=New Year Honours: Peter Masfen - Many a reserve up his sleeve |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=11567775 |accessdate=7 September 2016 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he worked for Porter Wigglesworth &amp; Grayburn, he married Joanna Porter, the daughter of principal Rolf Porter. Their sons are Rolf and Anatole and daughter Eugenie.&lt;ref name="Herald corporate profile"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gibson |first1=Anne |title=The corporate grave's comeback kid |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=10439286 |accessdate=7 September 2016 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=12 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Involvement in rowing==
After having received an invitation to the [[Henley Royal Regatta]], he won the inaugural Prince Phillip Challenge Cup regatta in 1963 in [[Henley-on-Thames]].&lt;ref name="glorious Henley win" /&gt; That year, the Henley regatta was regarded as the event that came closest to a world championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Green |first1=David |title=Rowing - International rowing, 1920s to 1980s |url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/rowing/page-4 |publisher=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]] |accessdate=7 September 2016 |date=7 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Darien Boswell]], [[Dudley Storey]] and [[Alistair Dryden]] made up the other rowers, and [[Robert Page (rower)|Bob Page]] was the [[coxswain (rowing)|cox]].&lt;ref name="glorious Henley win"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Leggat |first1=David |title=Rowing: Crew toast 50th anniversary of glorious win |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=10895045 |accessdate=7 September 2016 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=6 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same coxed four team then went to the [[1964 Summer Olympics]] in [[Tokyo]], where they placed a disappointing [[Rowing at the 1964 Summer Olympics – Men's coxed four|eighth]].&lt;ref name="glorious Henley win" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=New Zealand Rowing at the 1964 Tokyo Summer Games |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/NZL/summer/1964/ROW/ |publisher=[[Sports Reference]] |accessdate=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went to the [[1966 World Rowing Championships]] in Bled, Yugoslavia with the coxed eight,&lt;ref name="Mount Linton" /&gt; where the team came sixth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Alderson |first1=Andrew |title=Rowing: Time for change after eights disappointment |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=10808730 |accessdate=7 September 2016 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=27 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Masfen worked as a rowing coach for some time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Winter |first1=Chloe |title=Rich-lister Peter Masfen honoured for services to business and philanthropy |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/75523849/Rich-lister-Peter-Masfen-honoured-for-services-to-business-and-philanthropy |accessdate=7 September 2016 |work=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |date=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He helped fund both the New Zealand women's and men's eight to attend the [[2015 World Rowing Championships]] in [[Aiguebelette-le-Lac]], France, and the [[Rowing at the 2016 Summer Olympics|2016 Summer Olympics]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil.&lt;ref name="Many a reserve" /&gt;

==Professional life==
Masfen started his professional life as an accountant for the accounting firm Porter Wigglesworth &amp; Grayburn, where he eventually became a partner. He consolidated a number of business interest into Collingwood Holdings, which became Corporate Investments Ltd.&lt;ref name="Herald corporate profile" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Business Hall of Fame"&gt;{{cite web |title=Masfen, Peter Hanbury |url=http://www.businesshalloffame.co.nz/past-laureates/masfen-peter-hanbury/|publisher=New Zealand Business Hall of Fame |accessdate=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He invested in the winemaker [[Montana Wines|Montana Group]] and held 21% of its shares until 2001, when the winemaker was taken over by [[Allied Domecq]].&lt;ref name="Herald corporate profile" /&gt; From 2001 to 2005, Masfen was one of the New Zealand representatives on the APEC Business Advisory Council (ABAC).&lt;ref name="New Year Honours" /&gt; In 2003, he took a 50% shareholding in the {{convert|14000|ha}} Mount Linton Station near [[Ohai]] in [[Southland, New Zealand|Southland]].&lt;ref name="Mount Linton"&gt;{{cite news |title=Ex-Rower Buys into Ohai Station |url=http://www.mountlinton.co.nz/html/ex-rower_buys_into_ohai_statio.html |accessdate=7 September 2016 |work=[[The Southland Times]] |date=30 July 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Masfen is regarded as "one of New Zealand's most shrewd businessmen" and he has often displayed counter-cyclical investment, with a tendency to holding companies longer term.&lt;ref name="Many a reserve" /&gt; The Masfen family is on the rich list published by the ''[[National Business Review]]''. In 2006, the family wealth was estimated at [[New Zealand dollar|NZ$]]330m,&lt;ref name="Herald corporate profile" /&gt; and this had increased to over NZ$400m by 2015.&lt;ref name="Many a reserve" /&gt;

==Awards==
Masfen was inducted into the New Zealand Business Hall of Fame in 2002.&lt;ref name="Business Hall of Fame" /&gt; He was appointed a [[New Zealand Order of Merit|Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit]] in the [[2016 New Year Honours (New Zealand)|2016 New Year Honours]], for services to business and philanthropy.&lt;ref name="New Year Honours"&gt;{{cite web |title=New Year Honours 2016 - Citations for Companions of the New Zealand Order of Merit |url=https://www.dpmc.govt.nz/honours/lists/ny2016-cnzm |publisher=[[Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (New Zealand)|Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet]] |accessdate=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7722">'''Process Validation''' is the analysis of data gathered throughout the design and manufacturing of a product in order to confirm that the process can reliably output products of a determined standard. Regulatory authorities like [[European Medicines Agency|EMA]] and [[FDA]] have published guidelines relating to process validation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guidance for Industry Process Validation: General Principles and Practices|url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/Guidances/UCM070336.pdf|publisher=Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of process validation is to ensure varied inputs lead to consistent and high quality outputs. Process validation is an ongoing process that must be frequently adapted as manufacturing feedback is gathered. End-to-end validation of production processes is essential in determining product quality because quality cannot always be determined by finished-product inspection. Process validation can be broken down into 3 steps: process design, process qualification, and continued process verification.

==Process Design==
In this stage data from the development phase are gathered and analyzed to define the commercial manufacturing process. By understanding the commercial process a framework for quality specifications can be established and used as the foundation of a control strategy. [[Process design]] is the first of three stages of process validation. Data from the development phase is gathered and analyzed to understand end-to-end system processes. These data are used to establish benchmarks for quality and production control.

===Design of Experiment (DOE)===
Design of experiments is used to discover possible relationships and sources of variation as quickly as possible. A cost benefit analysis should be conducted to determine if such an operation is necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Case for Stage 3 Continued Process Verification|url=http://www.pharmamanufacturing.com/articles/2014/stage3-continued-process-verification/|publisher=Pharma Manufacturing|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quality by Design (QBD)===
[[Quality by Design]] is an approach to pharmaceutical manufacturing that stresses quality should be built into products rather than tested into products; that product quality should be considered at the earliest possible stage rather than at the end of the manufacturing process. Input variables are isolated in order to identify the root cause of potential quality issues and the manufacturing process is adapted accordingly.

===Process Analytical Technology (PAT)===
[[Process Analytical Technology]] is used to measure critical process parameters (CPP) and critical quality attributes (CQA).  PAT facilitates measurement of quantitative production variables in real time and allows access to relevant manufacturing feedback. PAT can also be used in the design process to generate a process qualification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PAT - A Framework for Innovative Pharmaceutical Development, Manufacturing, and Quality Assurance|url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/Guidances/ucm070305.pdf|publisher=Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical Process Parameters (CPP)===
[[Critical Process Parameters]] Operating parameters that are considered essential to maintaining product output within specified quality target guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PROCESS VALIDATION (P2V)|url=http://www.validation-online.net/process-validation.html|publisher=Validation Online|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical Quality Attributes (CQA)===
'''Critical Quality Attributes''' (CQA) are chemical, physical, biological and microbiological attributes that can be defined, measured, and continually monitored to ensure final product outputs remain within acceptable quality limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Defining Critical Quality Attributes in the Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Process|url=http://www.gxp-cc.com/news/fda-european-regulations-for-life-sciences/2014/07/15/defining-critical-quality-attributes-in-the-pharmaceutical-manufacturing-process/|publisher=GXP-CC|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; CQA are an essential aspect of a manufacturing control strategy and should be identified in stage 1 of [[Process Validation]]: [[Process design]]. During this stage acceptable limits, baselines, and data collection and measurement protocols should be established. Data from the design process and data collected during production should be kept by the manufacturer and used to evaluated [[product quality]] and [[process control]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Critical Quality Attributes (CQA)|url=http://www.atris-systems.com/cms/index.php?id=228|publisher=Atris Information Systems|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historical data can also help manufacturers better understand operational process and input variables as well as better identify true deviations from quality standards compared to false positives. Should a serious product quality issue arise, historical data would be essential in identifying the sources of errors and implementing corrective measures.

==Process Qualification==
In this stage the process design is assessed to conclude if the process is able to meet determined manufacturing targets. In this stage all production processes and manufacturing equipment is proofed to confirm quality and output capabilities. Critical quality attributes are evaluated and critical process parameters taken into account to confirm product quality. Once the process qualification stage has been successfully accomplished production can begin. [[Process Qualification]] is the second phase of process validation....

==Continued Process Verification==
[[Continued Process Verification]] is the ongoing monitoring of all aspects of the production cycle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atris-systems.com/216.0.html Continued Process Verification]&lt;/ref&gt; It aims to ensure that all levels of production are controlled and regulated. Deviations from prescribed output methods and final product irregularities are flagged by a process analytics database system. The FDA requires production data be recorded (FDA requirements (§ 211.180(e)). Continued process verification is stage 3 of process validation.

The [[European Medicines Agency]] defines a similar process known as Ongoing Process Verification. This alternative method of process validation is recommended by the EMA for validating processes on a continuous basis. Continuous Process Verification analyses [[Critical Process Parameters]] and [[Critical Quality Attributes]] in real time to confirm production remain within acceptable levels and meet standards set by ICH Q8, Pharmaceutical Quality Systems, and [[Good manufacturing practice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Continuous Process Verification|url=http://www.atris-systems.com/219.0.html|publisher=Atris Information Systems|accessdate=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ruth Amos''' (born 1989) is a British entrepreneur and inventor of the StairSteady.

The StairSteady is an aid to enable people with limited mobility to use their stairs confidently and safely. Amos designed it as part of a [[GCSE]] resistant materials project as a response to her teacher’s challenge to design an aid for people with limited mobility to use their stairs. She was prompted to do this as the father of one of her teachers had recently had a stroke.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt;  Her product was launched in April 2008 at Naidex,&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt; a national healthcare show, and StairSteady ltd started trading September 2008.

Amos won the 2006 Young Engineer of the Year award in Britain with her idea.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7375486.stm|title=Young engineer launches stair aid|author=Geoff Adams-Spink|date=1 May 2008|accessdate=16 February 2011|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She was also picked as the youngest ever of Britain's "Heroines For Hard Times" 35 women under 35 by [[Management Today]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/entrepreneur/article6590897.ece|title=Young, gifted and in the hot seat|author=Emma De Vita|date=28 June 2009|publisher=The Sunday Times|accessdate=16 February 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenbelt.org.uk/blog/2010/06/making-it-happen-ruth-amos/|title=Making It Happen: Ruth Amos|date=3 June  2010|author=Tom Davies|publisher=Greenbelt|accessdate=16 February 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318171509/http://www.greenbelt.org.uk/blog/2010/06/making-it-happen-ruth-amos/|archivedate=18 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newatlas.com/stairsteady-mobility-aid/13420/#p105516|title=StairSteady gives a helping hand up stairs|publisher=Gizmag|date=24 November 2009 | first=Jude | last=Garvey |accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Derbyshire Young Achiever 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| date = 18 September 2007| title = Report of the Chief Executive| publisher = Derbyshire County Council| url = http://www.derbyshire.gov.uk/images/2007-09-18%20Young%20Achievers%20Award_tcm9-12288.pdf| format = pdf| accessdate = 16 February 2011| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120320083025/http://www.derbyshire.gov.uk/images/2007-09-18%20Young%20Achievers%20Award_tcm9-12288.pdf| archivedate = 20 March 2012| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; she was the first ever Women of the Future "YoungStar" award winner,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stairsteady.net/about.html|title=Our Story|accessdate=16 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she was listed on the Yorkshire 42 under 42 in May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidermedia.com/event/yorkshire_42_under_42_dinner_2010/the_sponsors_winners/index.html|title=The Sponsors &amp; Winners|publisher=Insider Media|accessdate=16 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Seattle Public Utilities (SPU)''' is a [[public utility]] agency of the city of [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], which provides [[water]], [[sanitary sewer|sewer]], [[drainage]] and [[waste|garbage]] services for 1.3 million people in [[King County, Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattle.gov/util/services/ Services], Seattle Public Utilities. Accessed online 6 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The agency was established in 1997, consolidating the city's Water Department with other city functions.&lt;ref name="Stein" /&gt;

==Seattle's water supply==
SPU owns two water collection facilities: one in the [[Cedar River (Washington)|Cedar River]] watershed, which supplies 70 percent of the drinking water used by 1.3 million people in Seattle and surrounding suburbs (primarily the city south of the [[Lake Washington Ship Canal]]) and the other in the [[Tolt River]] watershed which supplies the other 30 percent (primarily the city north of the canal).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattle.gov/util/About_SPU/Water_System/Water_Sources_&amp;_Treatment/Cedar_River_Watershed/index.asp], Seattle Public Utilities. Accessed online 12 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattle.gov/util/About_SPU/Water_System/Water_Sources_&amp;_Treatment/Tolt_River_Watershed/index.asp], Seattle Public Utilities. Accessed online 12 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.seattle.gov/util/EnvironmentConservation/OurWatersheds/index.htm|title=Watersheds — Seattle Public Utilities|last=|first=|date=|website=www.seattle.gov|language=en-us|archive-url=https://www.seattle.gov/util/EnvironmentConservation/OurWatersheds/index.htm|archive-date=2018-09-11|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the city's founding through the 1880s, Seattle's water was [[Utilities of Seattle#Early water supply|provided by several private companies]]. In a July 8, 1889 election,&lt;ref name=Stein&gt;Alan J. Stein, [http://www.historylink.org/essays/output.cfm?file_id=2123 Seattle voters authorize Cedar River Water Supply system on July 8, 1889.], HistoryLink, January 1, 2000. Accessed online 6 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; barely a month after the [[Great Seattle Fire]] (June 6, 1889) gave a dramatic illustration of the limitations of the city's water supply, Seattle's citizens voted 1,875 to 51 to acquire and operate their own water system. In accordance with this vote, the city Water Department acquired the Lake Union and Spring Hill plants for $400,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fleming|1919|pp=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was understood from the first to be only a temporary expedient, inadequate to the expected growth of the city. Attention soon focused on the [[Cedar River (Washington)|Cedar River]],&lt;ref name="Stein" /&gt; an idea first proposed in the 1870s;&lt;ref name=Peterson-117&gt;{{Harvnb|Peterson|1950|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; the question was how to bring that water to the city. From 1892, the responsibility for doing so fell to newly hired City Engineer [[Reginald H. Thomson]] and his assistant [[George F. Cotterill]]. Besides the technical challenges, they and a series of Seattle mayors had to keep the citizenry on board to move forward with this expensive project through the [[Panic of 1893]].&lt;ref name="Stein" /&gt;

The [[Klondike Gold Rush]] put Seattle on a sound economic footing.&lt;ref name="Stein" /&gt; The 1901 completion of Cedar River Supply System No. 1 (active from February 21, 1901&lt;ref name=Peterson-117 /&gt;) gave the city a steady supply of clean water with an intake 28 miles from the city itself; this was supplemented by Cedar River Supply System No. 2 in 1909. Together, these systems gave the city a supply of more than {{convert|60000000|USgal|kl|0}} of water a day.&lt;ref name=Fleming-21&gt;{{Harvnb|Fleming|1919|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original Cedar River pipeline was made of reinforced wooden pipe "big enough so a small boy could stand upright in it" and carried {{convert|22500000|USgal|kl|0}} of water a day. By 1950, three big mains carried up to {{convert|162000000|USgal|kl|0}} of water a day.&lt;ref name=Peterson-117 /&gt;

To guard against contamination at the source, the city purchased or otherwise gained control of {{convert|142|sqmi|km2}} of land and placed it under the jurisdiction of the Department of Health and Sanitation. The city also established an extensive system of [[reservoir]]s within city limits. By 1919, six reservoirs had a combined capacity of {{convert|270000000|USgal|kl|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fleming|1919|p=21}} says that Seattle "owns or controls" the entire drainage of the Cedar River&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, the city owned "about two-thirds" of the [[drainage basin|watershed]], the federal government "about one-fourth"; the remainder, "around eleven square miles," was owned by private lumber companies.&lt;ref name=Peterson-118&gt;{{Harvnb|Peterson|1950|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seattle has at times contracted to provide water for entities out outside of city limits.&lt;ref name=Peterson-123&gt;{{Harvnb|Peterson|1950|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent decades, the Seattle Regional Water System has significantly improved conservation. 2008 usage was roughly equal to usage in 1960, despite roughly a 35% increase in population over that period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattle.gov/util/stellent/groups/public/@spu/@ssw/documents/webcontent/spu01_005056.pdf Drinking Water Quality Report 2008], Seattle Public Utilities. Accessed online 2009-06-05.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1990 to 2012 total water usage declined 29%, despite a population increase of 17%.&lt;ref&gt;"More than 100 Years of Water Stewardship: Seattle 2012 Drinking Water Quality Report", p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The CW Television Network''' (commonly referred to as just '''The CW''') is an American [[English language|English-language]] [[Terrestrial television|free-to-air]] [[television network]] that is operated by the CW Network, LLC, a [[Limited liability company|limited liability]] joint venture&lt;ref name="CW Bloomberg"/&gt; between [[CBS Corporation]], the former owners of United Paramount Network ([[UPN]]), and [[AT&amp;T]], whose [[WarnerMedia]] subsidiary is the parent company of [[Warner Bros. Entertainment]], former majority owner of [[The WB]]. The network's name is an [[abbreviation]] derived from the first letters of the names of its two parent corporations ('''C'''BS and '''W'''arner Bros.).

The CW Television Network made its debut on September 18, 2006, after its two predecessors, UPN and The WB, respectively ceased independent operations on September 15 and 17 of that year. The CW's first two nights of programming – on September 18 and 19, 2006 – consisted of reruns and launch-related [[television special|specials]]. The CW marked its formal launch date on September 20, 2006, with the two-hour premiere of the [[America's Next Top Model (cycle 7)|seventh cycle]] of ''[[America's Next Top Model]]''.

==History==

{{Use mdy dates|date=February 2018}}

===1993–2006: Origins===
{{main|The WB|UPN}}
[[File:The CW logo.png|225px|thumb|right|The CW's original pre-launch logo. At the network's first upfront presentation on May 18, 2006, the provisional blue-and-white rectangle logo that was used during the network's formation announcement in January was replaced by a green-and-white, curved-letter insignia that drew comparisons to the logo used by [[CNN]], another company with Time Warner ownership interest.]]
The CW Television Network is a successor to [[The WB]] and [[UPN]], both of which launched within one week of each other in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=THE MEDIA BUSINESS; 2 Would-Be Networks Get Set for Prime Time|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/09/business/the-media-business-2-would-be-networks-get-set-for-prime-time.html|author=[[Bill Carter]]|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=January 9, 1995|accessdate=September 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UPN and The WB both began just as the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network had started to secure a foothold with American television audiences. The two networks launched to limited fanfare and generally mediocre to poor results. However, over the subsequent 11{{frac|1|2}} seasons, both were able to air several series that became quite popular (such as ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'', ''[[7th Heaven (TV series)|7th Heaven]]'', ''[[Dawson's Creek]]'', ''[[Charmed]]'', ''[[Smallville]]'' and ''[[America’s Next Top Model]]''). Towards the end of their first decade on the air, The WB and UPN were in decline, unable to reach the audience share or have the effect that Fox had gained within its first decade, much less that of the [[Big Three television networks|Big Three]] networks ([[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]] and [[NBC]]). In the eleven years that UPN and The WB were in operation, the two networks lost a combined $2 billion.&lt;ref name="wsj2008"&gt;{{cite news|title=It's No Gossip, Ratings Slip Threatens CW Network|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121089546043097065 |author=Rebecca Dana|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|publisher=[[Dow Jones and Company]]|date=May 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Incidentally, Chris-Craft Industries, Viacom and Time Warner officials had discussed a possible merger of UPN and The WB as early as September 1995, only eight months after their respective launches; however, discussions ultimately broke down over issues on how to combine Chris-Craft and [[Tribune Broadcasting]]'s station interests in the proposal to merge the networks, since the two companies' station portfolios overlapped with one another in several major markets&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fledgling Networks UPN, WB Already Pondering Merger|url=http://adage.com/article/news/fledgling-networks-upn-wb-pondering-merger/85731/|author=Thomas Tyrer|periodical=[[AdAge]]|publisher=[[Crain Communications]]|date=September 18, 1995|accessdate=February 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; than facing questionable futures as separate networks.

Executives from CBS and Time Warner announced on January 24, 2006,&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia Littleton, [https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/cw-wb-network-upn-merger-announcement-10-years-ago-1201687040/ Birth of the CW: UPN-WB Network Merger Deal Rocked TV Biz 10 Years Ago], ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', January 24, 2016, Retrieved July 27, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; that they would respectively shut down UPN and The WB, and combine resources to form a new broadcast network, to be known as The CW Television Network, that would – at the outset – feature programming from both of its predecessors-to-be as well as new content developed specifically for the new network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Gilmore Girls' meet 'Smackdown'; CW Network to combine WB, UPN in CBS-Warner venture beginning in September|url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/01/24/news/companies/cbs_warner/|author=Jessica Seid|website=[[CNNMoney.com]]|publisher=[[Time Warner]]|date=January 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UPN and WB to Combine, Forming New TV Network|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/24/business/media/24cnd-network.html?bl|author=Bill Carter|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=January 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; CBS chairman [[Leslie Moonves]] explained that the name of the new network was formed from the first letters of CBS and Warner Bros, joking, "We couldn't call it the [[Flush toilet|WC]] for obvious reasons." Although some executives reportedly disliked the new name, Moonves stated in March 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CW Staying CW, Says Moonves|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/news-articles/cw-staying-cw-says-moonves/79264|author=Ben Grossman|periodical=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]|publisher=[[Reed Business Information]]|date=March 15, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070915031033/http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/CA6316450.html|archivedate=September 15, 2007|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; that there was "zero chance" the name would change, citing research claiming 48% of the target demographic were already aware of the CW name.

In May 2006, The CW announced that it would pick up a combined thirteen programs from its two predecessors to air as part of the network's inaugural fall schedule: seven series held over from The WB (''7th Heaven'', ''[[Beauty and the Geek]]'', ''[[Gilmore Girls]]'', ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'', ''[[Reba (TV series)|Reba]]'', ''[[Smallville]]'' and ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]'') and six held over from UPN (''[[America's Next Top Model]]'', ''[[Veronica Mars]]'', ''[[Everybody Hates Chris]]'', ''[[Girlfriends (2000 TV series)|Girlfriends]]'', ''[[All of Us]]'' and ''[[WWE SmackDown]]''). Upon the network's launch, The CW chose to use the scheduling model utilized by The WB due in part to the fact that it had a more extensive base programming schedule than UPN, allowing for a larger total of weekly programming hours for the new network to fill. (The WB carried 30 hours of programming each week because of it having a children's program block and a daytime lineup that UPN did not offer; UPN was primarily a prime time-only network with 12 weekly hours of network programming at the time of the network's shutdown.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Crupi|first1=Anthony|title=UPN, WB to Merge Into CW Network|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising/upn-wb-merge-cw-network-83687|accessdate=November 12, 2015|work=Ad Week|date=January 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2006–2011: Ostroff era===
Like both UPN and The WB, The CW targets its programming towards younger audiences. CBS and Time Warner hoped that combining their networks' schedules and affiliate lineups would strengthen The CW into a fifth "major" broadcast network. One week before the network's official launch, on September 11, 2006, a new, full version of the network website, [http://www.cwtv.com/ www.cwtv.com], was [http://www.thetvaddict.com/2006/09/14/check-out-the-new-cwtvcom/ launched]; the website began to feature more in-depth information about The CW's shows.

The CW launched with a premiere special/launch party from the [[CBS Television Distribution|CBS]]-produced ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'' at [[Warner Bros. Studios]] in [[Burbank, California]] on September 18, 2006, after a repeat of the tenth-season finale of ''7th Heaven'';&lt;ref name="zap2it-1559260"&gt;{{cite news|title=CW Staggers Its Debut – New net will roll out schedule over two weeks|url=http://www.zap2it.com/tv/news/zap-cwpremieredates,0,1559260.story|website=[[Zap2It]]|publisher=[[Tribune Media Services]]|date=August 18, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060818103850/http://www.zap2it.com/tv/news/zap-cwpremieredates,0,1559260.story|archivedate=August 18, 2006|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the same schedule was repeated on September 19, with the sixth-season finale of ''Gilmore Girls'' airing in the second hour of prime time.&lt;ref name="[[TV Guide]]"&gt;''[[TV Guide]]'', September 11, 2006, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; The network continued to air season finales from the previous season through the remainder of the first week, except for ''America's Next Top Model'' and ''WWE SmackDown'', which respectively began their new seasons on September 20 and 22, with two-hour premieres. When ''Top Model'' made its network premiere on September 20, 2006, The CW scored a 3.4 rating/5 share (with hourly ratings of 3.1/5 and 3.6/6; The CW placed fifth overall) in the [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen household ratings]]. It scored a 2.6 rating among Adults 18–49, finishing fourth in that age demographic and beating the 2.2 rating earned by Fox on that night. The network's second week consisted of season and series premieres for all of its other series from September 25 to October 1, with the exception of ''Veronica Mars'', which debuted its third season on October 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=THE CW NETWORK ANNOUNCES ITS INAUGURAL 2006-2007 PREMIERE SCHEDULE|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2006/07/17/the-cw-network-announces-its-inaugural-2006-2007-premiere-schedule-21795/20060717cw01/|publisher=The CW|via=The Futon Critic|date=July 17, 2006|accessdate=September 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite having several of the most popular programs carried over from UPN and The WB as part of its schedule, The CW – even though it experienced some success with newer programs that launched in subsequent seasons which became modest hits – largely struggled to gain an audience foothold throughout its first five years on the air.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} Because of declining viewership for the network during the 2007–08 season and effects from the [[2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike|Writers Guild of America strike]], the network announced on March 4, 2008, that it would eliminate its comedy department (dismissing executive vice president of comedy Kim Fleary, and senior vice president of comedy Steve Veisel), while also combining its drama and current programming departments into a single scripted programming unit. The corporate restructuring – which also included the elimination of certain positions, other newly opened positions being left unfilled, layoffs from the Kids' WB unit (as the block was set to be replaced by [[Toonzai|The CW4Kids]] on May 24), and the elimination and transfer of marketing positions at [[The CW Plus]] to the network's marketing department – resulted in the layoffs of around 25 to 30 employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Strike, ratings slip lead to CW layoffs|url=https://variety.com/2008/scene/markets-festivals/strike-ratings-slip-lead-to-cw-layoffs-1117981768/|author=Michael Schneider|periodical=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Reed Business Information]]|date=March 3, 2008|accessdate=August 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CW downsizes, sheds comedy division|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/cw-downsizes-sheds-comedy-division-106143|author=James Hibberd|agency=[[Associated Press]]|periodical=The Hollywood Reporter|publisher=Nielsen Company|date=March 4, 2008|accessdate=August 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 9, 2008, The CW announced that it would lease its Sunday lineup (then running from 5:00 to 10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern]] and [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific Time]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The CW "Outsources" Its Sunday-Night Block; Two Dramas, Two Comedies Coming|url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/the-cw-outsources-12191/|periodical=[[TV Guide]]|publisher=[[Macrovision]]|date=May 9, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511221532/http://community.tvguide.com/blog-entry/TVGuide-News-Blog/Todays-News/Cw-Puts-Sunday/800039275|archivedate=May 11, 2008|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CW outsources Sunday to MRC|url=https://variety.com/2008/tv/features/cw-outsources-sunday-to-mrc-1117985413/|author=Michael Schneider|periodical=Variety|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=May 9, 2008|accessdate=September 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to production company [[Media Rights Capital]] (MRC). As Sundays have historically been a low-rated night for the network during its first two seasons on the air (due to stiff competition from CBS, ABC and Fox's strong Sunday lineups, and complicated further by NBC's acquisition of ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]]'' in September 2006, shortly before The CW debuted), the move allowed The CW to concentrate on its Monday through Saturday prime time schedule, while giving MRC the right to develop and schedule programs of its own choosing and reap advertising revenue generated by the lineup. The Sunday series that were scheduled – two reality series (''[[4Real]]'' and ''[[In Harm's Way (TV series)|In Harm's Way]]'') and two scripted series (romantic dramedy ''[[Valentine (TV series)|Valentine]]'' and drama ''[[Easy Money (TV series)|Easy Money]]'') – performed poorly in the ratings (averaging only 1.04 million viewers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CW ends time-buy deal with MRC|url=https://variety.com/2008/scene/markets-festivals/cw-ends-time-buy-deal-with-mrc-1117996223/|author=Michael Schneider|periodical=Variety|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=November 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;), prompting The CW to scrap its agreement with MRC and program Sunday nights on its own starting on November 30, 2008. With no first-run programming available to run on Sundays as a backup, the network added reruns of ''[[The Drew Carey Show]]'' and ''[[Jericho (2006 TV series)|Jericho]]'', and movies to replace the MRC-produced programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CW Takes Back Its Sunday Nights, Sets ‘Jericho' Reruns|url=http://www.tvweek.com/in-depth/2008/11/cw-takes-back-its-sunday-night/|website=TVWeek|publisher=Dexter Canfield Media|date=November 20, 2008|accessdate=September 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the shows carried over to the network from UPN, ''[[WWE SmackDown|WWE Friday Night SmackDown]]'', ended its run on The CW after the September 26, 2008, episode due to negotiations ending between the [[WWE]] and The CW on renewing the program. Representatives for The CW later confirmed that it had chosen not to continue carrying ''SmackDown'' because the network had redefined its target audience as exclusively females 18 to 34 years old,&lt;ref name="wsj2008"/&gt; whereas ''Smackdown'' targeted a predominately male audience – although it continued to air some shows that targeted male viewers afterward, such as ''Smallville'' and ''Supernatural''. Following ''Smackdown''{{'}}s move to [[MyNetworkTV]] that same season, the [[Fox Entertainment Group|Fox]]-owned network (which launched the same month as The CW's debut, albeit two weeks earlier, on September 5, 2006) began beating The CW in the Friday ratings every week from that program's debut on the network, though The CW continued to beat MyNetworkTV overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fox Still Likely to Pass CBS in Adults 25–54 to Top All Key Age Demos|url=http://tvbythenumbers.com/2009/03/25/fox-still-likely-to-pass-cbs-in-adults-25-54-to-top-all-key-age-demos/15178#more-15178|website=[[TV by the Numbers]]|date=March 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CW has generally struggled in the Nielsen ratings since its inception, primarily placing fifth in all statistics tabulated by [[Nielsen Holdings|Nielsen]] (total audience viewership and demographic ratings). On several occasions, The CW has even been outrated by Spanish language network [[Univision]]. This had led to speculation within the industry (including a May 16, 2008 article in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''&lt;ref name="wsj2008"/&gt;) that CBS, Time Warner or both companies could abandon the venture if ratings did not improve. However, The CW's fortunes were buoyed in the 2008–09 and 2009–10 television seasons thanks to increased ratings among females in the 18–34 demographic and the buzz that some of its newer series (such as ''[[Gossip Girl]]'', ''[[90210 (TV series)|90210]]'' and ''[[The Vampire Diaries]]'') had generated with audiences. Executives with CBS Corporation and Time Warner also emphasized their commitment to the network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CW Parents Emphasize Support of Network|url=http://adage.com/article/media/cw-parents-emphasize-support-network/130465/|author=Josef Adalian|periodical=AdAge|publisher=Crain Communications|date=August 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 5, 2009, The CW announced that it would give the five hours of network time on Sundays back to its affiliated stations that fall, effectively becoming a weeknight-only network in prime time, in addition to The CW Daytime and The CW4Kids blocks (the latter block, airing on Saturday mornings, would remain the only weekend programming supplied by the network).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tribune Psyched to Take back Sundays on The CW|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/programming/tribune-psyched-take-back-sundays-cws/34685?rssid=20105|author=Michael Malone|periodical=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=May 5, 2009|accessdate=May 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CW Drops Sundays In Another Blow to Broadcast Model|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idUSTRE54514E20090506|author=Nellie Andreeva|agency=[[Reuters]]|date=May 6, 2009|accessdate=May 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, in turn, resulted in the discontinuance of the Sunday late afternoon repeat block that The CW inherited from The WB (formerly branded by that network as "EasyView") through its use of the predecessor network's scheduling model. Subsequently, in mid-May, 65% of The CW's affiliates, including those carrying The CW Plus, signed agreements to continue to air the replacement ''[[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] Showcase'' movie package on Sundays, which was offered as a traditional syndicated film package meant for The CW's former prime time slot on that night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CW Affiliates Booking MGM Movie Pack|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/cw-affiliates-booking-mgm-movie-83903|author=Nellie Andreeva|agency=Associated Press|periodical=The Hollywood Reporter|publisher=[[Guggenheim Partners|Prometheus Global Media]]|date=May 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2011–present: Pedowitz era===
On April 28, 2011, [[Mark Pedowitz]] was appointed by the network to succeed original president of entertainment [[Dawn Ostroff]]; Pedowitz assumed broader responsibilities in The CW's business operations than Ostroff had, as the network's first president.&lt;ref name="thr-pedowitz"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mark Pedowitz Named President of The CW|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/mark-pedowitz-named-president-cw-183298|author=Lacey Rose|periodical=The Hollywood Reporter|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|date=April 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As president of entertainment, Ostroff oversaw entertainment operations while John Maatta, the network's chief operating officer, handled business affairs; both reported to a board composed of CBS and Warner Bros. executives. Maatta began reporting to Pedowitz as a result of the latter's appointment as network president.&lt;ref name="thr-pedowitz"/&gt; Pedowitz revealed that the core target demographic of the network would not change, though The CW would attempt to lure new viewers. Pedowitz began looking to bring comedies back to The CW after former president, Dawn Ostroff, publicly declared that the difficulty of developing comedies for its target demographic as the reason for their removal from the network following the [[2008–09 United States network television schedule|2008–09 season]] (with ''Everybody Hates Chris'', and ''[[The Game (U.S. TV series)|The Game]]'' – a spin-off of ''Girlfriends'' – becoming the last comedies to be cancelled).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CW Chief: Network Is in Search of Close-Ended Series, Comedies and a Superhero Show|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/cw-chief-network-is-search-219442|author=Lacey Rose|periodical=The Hollywood Reporter|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|date=August 4, 2011|accessdate=September 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The network also ordered more episodes of its original series and ran them consecutively through the first week of December, starting on September 12, without repeats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The CW President Mark Pedowitz Talks RINGER, SUPERNATURAL, NIKITA, GOSSIP GIRL, Developing More DC Superheroes, and More|url=http://collider.com/cw-mark-pedowitz-ringer-supernatural-smallville/107697/|author=Christina Radish|website=[[Collider (website)|Collider]]|date=August 5, 2011|accessdate=September 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2012, Pedowitz no longer referred to the target demographic of The CW as women 18-34, but rather that it would now be an "18-34 adult network".&lt;ref name="Molloy" /&gt;

The 2012–13 season saw the introduction of action-superhero series ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' based on [[DC Comics]]' [[Green Arrow]], which received favorable reviews from critics and became a hit with audiences when it premiered. As evidence of the network's refocusing toward a more inclusive audience, ''Arrow'' not only premiered to some of the highest viewership totals in the network's history (the third highest overall {{as of|2015|lc=y}}, behind the series premieres of ''The Vampire Diaries'' and ''The Flash''), it also gave the network its strongest performance in the demographic of males 18-34 since ''Smallville'' ended its run in May 2011. The strength of ''Arrow'', combined with the stability of ''The Vampire Diaries'' and a rejuvenated ''Supernatural'' gave The CW a much needed win for the season. However, the network's other creative swings in ''[[Emily Owens, M.D.]]'' and ''[[Cult (TV series)|Cult]]'' were not successful and were canceled after one season, in addition, fan favorite, ''Gossip Girl'', ended after six seasons and once breakout hit 90210 was cancelled due to declining ratings. The remaining freshman lineup of ''[[Beauty &amp; the Beast (2012 TV series)|Beauty &amp; the Beast]]'' and ''[[The Carrie Diaries (TV series)|The Carrie Diaries]]'' performed adequately enough for renewal. During this season, the network introduced an image campaign under the "TV Now" slogan, in part to emphasize the availability of CW content across television, computer and mobile platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/11/arrow-ratings-series-premiere_n_1958246.html|title='Arrow' Brings In Huge Audience For The CW, 'Nashville' Off To Solid Start|last=Harnick|first=Chris|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=October 11, 2012|accessdate=February 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2013–14 season saw the network continue to build on its newfound stability with the introduction of ''The Vampire Diaries'' spin-off, ''[[The Originals (TV series)|The Originals]]''. Paired with ''Supernatural'', this combo led The CW to success on a new night. ''Arrow'' continued to perform strongly, however its new companion, the highly anticipated ''[[The Tomorrow People (U.S. TV series)|The Tomorrow People]]'' fizzled out and was canceled despite a promising start. Freshman period-piece ''[[Reign (TV series)|Reign]]'' performed adequately enough to earn a renewal. Mid-season entry ''[[The 100 (TV series)|The 100]]'' proved to be a success, however fellow mid-season entry ''[[Star-Crossed (TV series)|Star-Crossed]]'' did not fare as well and was canceled. The network finally found success with its summer programming in 2013, with the revival of the U.S. version of the improv comedy series ''[[Whose Line Is It Anyway? (U.S. TV series)|Whose Line Is It Anyway?]]'', which later became part of the network's fall-to-spring schedule.

The 2014–15 season saw the premieres of three critically acclaimed shows that also earned strong ratings: ''Arrow'' spin-off ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', the freshman comedy-drama ''[[Jane the Virgin]]'' (loosely adapted from the Venezuelan telenovela ''[[Juana la virgen|Juana la Virgen]]''), and freshman offbeat crime dramedy ''[[iZombie (TV series)|iZombie]]'' (a loose adaptation based on DC's [[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo]] comic book series [[iZOMBIE|of the same name]]). ''The Flash'' surpassed ''The Vampire Dairies'' as the highest-rated premiere in the network's history and became the most watched show on the network. ''Jane the Virgin'', meanwhile, earned some of the highest critical praise of any series during the 2014–15 television season, and during its first season, became the first CW series ever to have been nominated for and win a [[Golden Globe Award]] (with lead actress [[Gina Rodriguez (actress)|Gina Rodriguez]] winning the Golden Globe for "Best Actress in a Comedy or Variety Series"). ''iZombie'', which premiered as a [[mid-season replacement]], earned both strong ratings (at one point becoming the third highest-rated show on The CW) and critical acclaim. Overall, the network ended the 2014–15 season posting its highest average total viewership in a single television season since 2007–08 with 2.15 million viewers, a 12% increase in total viewership year-to-year; The CW also posted its highest seasonal demographic ratings among males ages 18–49 with a 0.8 share.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2015/05/13/the-cw-delivers-its-most-watched-season-in-7-years/403500/|title=The CW Delivers its Most Watched Season in 7 Years|last=Bibel|first=Sara|work=[[TV by the Numbers]]|date=May 13, 2015|accessdate=September 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The network's Summer 2015 schedule also saw the debut of ''[[Significant Mother]]'', the first original half-hour sitcom to air on The CW since 2009 (other scripted half-hour comedies have aired on the network since that time, consisting of imported series acquired by The CW through distribution deals with Canadian and British producers).

The 2015–16 season saw two shows that receive similar success: the freshman musical comedy-drama ''[[Crazy Ex-Girlfriend]]'' and the ''Arrow/Flash'' spin-off ''[[Legends of Tomorrow|DC's Legends of Tomorrow]]''. ''Crazy Ex-Girlfriend'' became one of the most critically acclaimed shows of the season and became the second show on the network to be nominated and win a Golden Globe Award (with actress [[Rachel Bloom]] winning a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Comedy or Variety Series); ''DC's Legends of Tomorrow'', meanwhile, earned high ratings for the network and became the most watched show on the network's Thursday night block in two years. On the other hand, ''[[Containment (TV series)|Containment]]'' was cancelled following mixed reviews and falling ratings (although the series had been promoted as being a limited series).&lt;ref name="variety-containmentcancelled"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/containment-cancelled-no-season-2-cw-1201773226/|title='Containment' Canceled at The CW|last=Prudom|first=Laura|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=May 12, 2016|accessdate=February 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2016–17 season saw mixed fortunes with CBS transplant ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'' providing a boost to the lineup, while freshmen series ''[[Frequency (TV series)|Frequency]]'' and ''[[No Tomorrow (TV series)|No Tomorrow]]'' failed to live up to ratings expectations and were canceled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2016/11/the-cw-streak-ends-no-tomorrow-frequency-no-back-orders-1201855990/|title= The CW Streak Ends With ‘No Tomorrow’ &amp; ‘Frequency’ Getting No Back Orders|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|work=Deadline Hollywood|date=November 16, 2016|accessdate=April 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2017/05/frequency-no-tomorrow-canceled-the-cw-once-season-1202087053/|title=‘Frequency’ &amp; ‘No Tomorrow’ Canceled By the CW After One Season|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|work=Deadline Hollywood|date= May 8, 2017|accessdate=May 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critically acclaimed freshman series ''[[Riverdale (2017 TV series)|Riverdale]]'' fared better, securing a renewal despite modest ratings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2017/03/riverdale-renewed-season-2-the-cw-archie-comics-1202038629/|title=‘Riverdale’ Renewed For Season 2 By the CW|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|work=Deadline Hollywood|date=March 7, 2017|accessdate=April 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Long-running ''The Vampire Diaries'' and ''Reign'' concluded their runs.

Soap reboot ''[[Dynasty (2017 TV series)|Dynasty]]'' was met with similarly dismal ratings, but was renewed thanks to lucrative off-network streaming deals struck with the show's producing studio and network co-owner, CBS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/edited-transcript-cbs-earnings-conference-033925537.html|title=Q2 2017 CBS Corp Earnings Call|work=Yahoo!

==Programming==
===Network programming and scheduling===
{{main|List of programs broadcast by The CW}}
The CW airs its prime time programming for only two hours on Sunday through Friday evenings, compared to the three hours on Monday through Saturdays and four hours on Sunday nights programmed by the three longest-established networks, ABC, CBS, and NBC. This "common prime" scheduling (which was originated by Fox when it launched its prime time schedule in April 1987, and later adopted by CW predecessors The WB and UPN when they launched in January 1995) allows the option for affiliates to air either a local newscast, syndicated programming or both during the 10:00–11:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. (Eastern and Pacific Time) time period. As with The WB and UPN, The CW does not run network programming on Saturday nights – even though it maintains a syndicated children's program block on Saturday mornings – allowing affiliates to run syndicated programs, sports, movies or network programs that were preempted from earlier in the week because of special programming carried by the station, in the 8:00–10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. (Eastern and Pacific) time period (MyNetworkTV also does not carry any weekend prime time programming, having turned network time on Saturday evenings over to its affiliates in March 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MyNetworkTV Shakeup Music to Syndicators Ears|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/programming/mynetworktv-shakeup-music-syndicators-ears/34149?rssid=20065|author=Paige Albiniak|periodical=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=February 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

The CW is also tied with NBC (if its morning news program ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]'' is not counted) for the fewest daytime hours programmed by any of the major broadcast networks, running only one hour of programming each weekday afternoon (compared to 4{{frac|1|2}} daytime hours on CBS and three hours on ABC). The CW, unlike the "Big Four" broadcast networks, also does not air any national [[news]]casts, network-supplied sports, or [[Late night television in the United States|late-night programming]].

Because of these factors, The CW's affiliates handle the responsibility of programming non-network time periods, with the majority of its stations filling those slots mainly with syndicated programming. However, some of the network's affiliates broadcast their own local news and/or sports programs (either produced by the station itself or through outsourcing agreements with an affiliate of another network). Many affiliates also carry telecasts of [[college basketball|basketball]], [[college football|football]] and in some cases, other collegiate sporting events (such as [[college baseball|baseball]] or [[College ice hockey|hockey]]) that are produced by syndicators such as [[American Sports Network]] and [[Raycom Sports]], while a few (mainly those owned by Tribune Broadcasting, such as former Chicago affiliate WGN-TV) carry games from local teams of major professional sports leagues such as [[Major League Baseball]] and the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]].

{{As of|October 2018}}, The CW currently provides 20 hours of regularly scheduled network programming each week, over the course of seven days. The network provides twelve hours of prime time programming to its owned-and-operated and affiliated stations on Sunday through Fridays from 8:00 to 10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time. Outside of prime time, an hour of daytime programming is also offered Monday through Fridays from 3:00 to 4:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. in all time zones, in the form of tabloid talk show ''[[The Jerry Springer Show]]'' (though a few affiliates – such as [[WPIX]]  in New York City, [[WPWR-TV]] in Chicago, [[KDAF]] in [[Dallas]]-[[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]], [[KPXJ]] in [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]] and [[WCCB]] in [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]] – carry the show earlier in the afternoon); also, a three-hour [[E/I|educational programming]] block called "[[One Magnificent Morning]]" (which airs as part of the CW schedule through a time-lease agreement with [[Litton Entertainment]]) airs on Saturday mornings from 8:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. to 11:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. in all time zones.

The weekday daytime hour provided by the network and the Litton-produced Saturday morning block (the latter of which is subject to scheduling variances similar to the weekday hour in some markets, such as in [[WUPA|Atlanta]] and [[XETV-TDT|San Diego]]) are designed to be [[broadcast delay|tape delayed]] and are therefore recommended to air in the same time slot in all time zones, though both are broadcast one hour earlier on affiliates of The CW Plus in the [[Central Time Zone|Central]], [[Mountain Time Zone|Mountain]] and [[Alaska Time Zone]]s. In [[Guam]], CW Plus affiliate [[KTKB-LD]] in [[Hagåtña, Guam|Hagåtña]] airs the CW schedule day and date on a one-day tape delay from its initial broadcast because of the time difference between Guam and the [[continental United States]] as the island is on the west side of the [[International Date Line]]. As of 2018, ''Supernatural'' (which originally aired on The WB) is the only CW series carried over from either of the network's respective predecessors that continues to be broadcast on the network.

The CW formerly aired short segments during commercial breaks within certain episodes of its programs known as "Content Wraps" – a play on the network's name – in order to advertise one company's product during part or the entirety of a commercial break. The entertainment magazine series ''[[CW Now]]'' was inspired in part by the success of the Content Wraps as it was intended to be a series with [[product placement]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="CW Now": Content or Commercial?|url=http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2007/09/25/cw-now-content-or-commercial.aspx|author=Steven Mallas|website=[[The Motley Fool]]|date=September 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; the program was cancelled in 2008, after a single 23-episode season. For the 2006–07 season, The CW reached an agreement with [[American Eagle Outfitters]] to incorporate tie-ins with the company's [[Aerie (intimates)|aerie]] clothing line as part of the Content Wrap concept within the network's Tuesday night schedule, which included subjects in the commercials commenting on plot points in each of the shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="aerie girls" – Google Search|url=http://www.google.com/search?client=opera&amp;rls=en&amp;q=%22aerie+girls%22&amp;sourceid=opera&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8|website=[[Google]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement was cut down to regular advertising in February 2007, after a fan backlash by viewers of both shows and general criticism of the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Aerie Girls and Terrible TV Advertising|url=http://www.makemewatchtv.com/2006/10/04/the-aerie-girls-and-terrible-tv-advertising/|website=Make Me Watch TV|date=October 4, 2006|accessdate=December 14, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100918085714/http://www.makemewatchtv.com/2006/10/04/the-aerie-girls-and-terrible-tv-advertising/|archive-date=September 18, 2010|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===News programming===
The CW does not produce any national news content, and the majority of its affiliates do not have their own autonomous news operations. {{As of|September 2018}}, the network currently has only four affiliates that produce their own local news programming, all of which were carry-overs from previous affiliations: WPIX in New York City and KTLA in Los Angeles started their news departments as independent stations and/or during early affiliations with other networks including DuMont; [[WCCB]] in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Channel 18 to be new home of CW network|url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2013/04/18/3990396/channel-18-to-be-new-home-of-cw.html |author=Mark Washburn|agency=McClatchy-Tribune Information Services|newspaper=[[The Charlotte Observer]] |publisher=[[The McClatchy Company]]|date=April 18, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927013236/http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2013/04/18/3990396/channel-18-to-be-new-home-of-cw.html |archivedate=September 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; started its news operation as a Fox affiliate; and [[WISH-TV]] in [[Indianapolis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=WISH-TV Expanding Daily Newscasts by Four Hours|url=http://www.ibj.com/articles/49771-wish-tv-expanding-daily-newscasts-by-four-hours|author=Jeff Newman|author2=Anthony Schoettle|newspaper=[[Indianapolis Business Journal]]|publisher=[[American City Business Journals]]|date=October 1, 2014|accessdate=December 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (which became a CW affiliate on January 1, 2015) started its news operation as an ABC affiliate before affiliating with CBS in 1956. KTLA has the largest number of weekly hours devoted to local news programming of any CW affiliate with 78¾ hours of scheduled news each week.

Eight other CW-affiliated stations maintained in-house news operations, but have since disaffiliated from the network or discontinued in-house production:
* WGN-TV in Chicago has maintained a news department since it launched as a CBS affiliate in 1948; the station – which, along with sister stations KTLA and WPIX, transitioned into a news-intensive outlet during its tenures with The WB and The CW – retains a news-heavy format after disaffiliating from the network in September 2016;
* Under Tribune Broadcasting ownership, [[WLVI]] in [[Boston]] produced an in-house 10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. newscast, which was replaced in December 2006 with one produced by then-NBC affiliate (now independent) [[WHDH (TV)|WHDH]], after Tribune sold WLVI to that station's longtime owner [[Sunbeam Television]];
* [[XETV-TDT]] in [[Tijuana]], [[Baja California]], Mexico (serving the [[San Diego]] market) retained the news department it launched in 1999 as a Fox affiliate when it joined The CW in August 2008; XETV's news department shut down on March 31, 2017, following the earlier announcement that the CW affiliation in San Diego would move to a subchannel of CBS affiliate [[KFMB-TV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=San Diego's CW6 news signs off|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/entertainment/tv/sd-me-test-cw6-story.html|author=Karla Peterson|website=The San Diego Union-Tribune|date=March 12, 2017|accessdate=April 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In April 2012, [[KCWI-TV]] in [[Des Moines, Iowa]] broadcast a morning news and talk program, which transitioned from an in-house production to a brand extension during ''[[Good Morning America]]'' of ABC affiliate [[WOI-DT]]'s morning newscast on April 11, 2016, as a result of Nexstar Broadcasting's acquisition of KCWI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=KCWI-TV has new owner, morning show changes planned|url=http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/2016/03/20/kcwi-tv-changes-hands-loses-morning-show/82017610/|author=Timothy Meinch|newspaper=[[Des Moines Register]]|publisher=Gannett Company|date=March 20, 2016|accessdate=April 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* For several years, [[WDCW]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] used reporters from Tribune's local bureau and anchors based from the studios of sister CBS station [[WTVR-TV|WTVR]] in [[Richmond, Virginia]], and [[KDAF]] in [[Dallas]], [[KIAH]] in [[Houston]] and [[WSFL-TV]] in Miami used non-traditional formats (in the form of a [[newsreel]]-style program known as ''[[NewsFix]]'', along with the morning show ''Morning Dose''; both KDAF and KIAH had previously produced more traditional newscasts, launched during their WB affiliations, earlier in their tenures with The CW). These programs were all canceled in September 2018, a result of budget cuts within Tribune, along with the termination of Tribune's attempted merger with [[Sinclair Broadcast Group]].

News programming on CW affiliates – if the station carries any – is often outsourced to another major network affiliate in the market, especially if they are operated as part of a [[duopoly (broadcasting)|duopoly]] or [[local marketing agreement|management agreement]], such as Tribune's respective CW-Fox duopolies of [[KWGN-TV]]/[[KDVR]] in [[Denver]] and [[KPLR-TV]]/[[KTVI]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] (the Fox stations in both duopolies – KDVR and KTVI – were formerly owned by [[Local TV LLC|Local TV]], with Tribune-owned KWGN and KPLR respectively consolidating with those stations through local marketing agreements formed as part of a wider partnership involving Local TV, which Tribune bought outright in 2013);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Denver, St. Louis To Get Fox-CW Duops|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/25485/denver-st-louis-to-get-foxcw-duops|author=Harry A. Jessell|website=TVNewsCheck|publisher=NewsCheck Media|date=September 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Evansville, Indiana]] affiliate [[WTVW]] (which joined The CW in January 2013) and ABC affiliate [[WEHT]] (a virtual duopoly formed through [[Nexstar Media Group|Nexstar Broadcasting Group]]'s 2011 purchase of WEHT and trade of WTVW to partner group [[Mission Broadcasting]]);&lt;ref name=c&amp;p-wtvwewnagain&gt;{{cite news|title=Big changes coming to News 25 and Local 7|url=http://www.courierpress.com/news/2011/nov/22/no-headline---ev_tv/|author=Jacob Newkirk|newspaper=[[Evansville Courier &amp; Press]]|publisher=[[E. W. Scripps Company]]|date=November 22, 2011|accessdate=November 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the CW-CBS O&amp;O duopoly of [[KMAX-TV]]/[[KOVR]] in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] (the former of which has produced a morning newscast, ''Good Day Sacramento'',  since it was a UPN owned-and-operated station, and – despite the two becoming a duopoly in 2005 – has remained separate from a more traditional morning show on KOVR pre-''[[CBS This Morning]]'', which produces KMAX's evening newscast).

The scheduling of news programming on The CW's affiliates often mirrors that of Fox stations, with morning newscasts (designed to compete with the national morning shows on ABC, CBS and NBC within the 7:00–9:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. timeslot; in duopolies, these are typically an extension of a sister station's morning newscast) and a prime time newscast within the 10:00–11:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. Eastern/Pacific (9:00–10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. Central/Mountain) time slot. Rarely (but more common on the few major-market CW affiliates with in-house news departments), they may also include midday and/or early evening newscasts, including the network newscast slot of 6:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. ET/5:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. CT.

===Children's programming===
{{Main|Kids' WB|Toonzai|Vortexx|One Magnificent Morning}}
On September 23, 2006, the ''[[Kids' WB]]'' children's programming block – which originated on The WB in September 1995 and continued to be produced by [[Warner Bros. Television]] – was carried over to The CW as part of its inaugural programming lineup; although the network on which it originated ceased operations the week before, the "Kids' WB" branding was retained for the block. On October 2, 2007, through a joint decision between corporate parents Warner Bros. Television and CBS Corporation, The CW announced that it would discontinue the ''Kids' WB'' block due to competition from cable channels aimed at the demographic (such as [[Cartoon Network]], which carried many series shared with the block and vice versa, [[Nickelodeon]] and [[Disney Channel]]), as well as the effects of children's advertising limits, and would sell the programming rights to the network's Saturday morning block to [[4Licensing Corporation|4Kids Entertainment]] (which at the time of the announcement, had produced a competing children's programming block, ''[[4Kids TV]]'', for [[Fox (TV channel)|Fox]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CW turns to 4Kids on Saturdays|url=https://variety.com/2007/digital/markets-festivals/cw-turns-to-4kids-on-saturdays-1117973235/|author=Michael Schneider|periodical=Variety|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=October 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kids' WB'' ended its run on May 17, 2008 (though some CW affiliates that delayed the block to Sundays, such as [[Atlanta]] O&amp;O [[WUPA]], aired the block for the last time on May 18).

The following week on May 24, 4Kids took over responsibility for The CW's Saturday morning children's lineup, with the debut of a new block called ''[[Toonzai|The CW4Kids]]''. The block's lineup initially consisted mostly of programs carried over from ''Kids' WB'', before eventually adding 4Kids-produced shows such as ''[[Chaotic (TV series)|Chaotic]]'' as well as new seasons of ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'' and ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003 TV series)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brands Old and New for 4Kids at Licensing Expo 2008|url=http://www.awn.com/news/brands-old-and-new-4kids-licensing-expo-2008|author=Annemarie Moody|website=[[Animation World Network]]|publisher=AWN, Inc.|date=November 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The block was rebranded into ''[[Toonzai]]'' on August 14, 2010 (though The CW4Kids name was retained as a sub-brand to fulfill branding obligations that the network had to comply with per 4Kids Entertainment's contract to lease The CW's Saturday morning timeslots); ''Toonzai'' ended its run on August 18, 2012.

On July 3, 2012, [[Saban Capital Group#Saban Brands|Saban Brands]] and Kidsco Media Ventures, affiliates of [[Saban Capital Group]], entered into an agreement to program the five-hour Saturday morning time slot with a new action-adventure and comedy programming block for The CW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Saban Brands to rebuild CW toon block|url=https://variety.com/2012/tv/news/saban-brands-to-rebuild-cw-toon-block-1118056206/|author=Andrew Wallenstein|periodical=Variety|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|date=July 2, 2012|accessdate=July 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The CW signs Saban Brands for kids block|url=http://rbr.com/the-cw-signs-saban-brands-for-kids-block/|author=C.

On June 5, 2014, The CW announced an agreement with [[Litton Entertainment]] to program a block of live-action series designed to comply with the FCC's [[E/I|educational programming]] guidelines. Vortexx (which was the last remaining non-educational children's block on the major U.S. broadcast networks) was replaced by ''[[One Magnificent Morning]]'' on October 4, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The CW Sets 5-Hour Saturday Morning Block|url=http://www.deadline.com/2014/06/the-cw-saturday-morning-block-litton-entertainment/|website=Deadline Hollywood|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|date=June 5, 2014|accessdate=June 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Saturday morning cartoons are no more|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/09/30/saturday-morning-cartoons-are-no-more/|author=Gail Sullivan|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=[[Jeff Bezos|Nash Holdings LLC]]|date=September 30, 2014|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The block features a mix of wildlife and lifestyle-themed programs, similar in vein to those featured on the Litton-produced blocks aired by [[Litton's Weekend Adventure|ABC]] and CW sister network [[CBS Dream Team|CBS]] (one of its initial programs, ''Expedition Wild'', was moved over to "One Magnificent Morning" from the ABC block; while one of the CW block's early entries, ''Rock the Park'', moved to "Litton's Weekend Adventure" after one season).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CW Joins With Litton For Sat.

&lt;!--- Please update station count in below paragraph whenever the accompanying list referenced is updated. ---&gt;
{{As of|November 2017}}, The CW has eight owned-and-operated stations, and current and pending affiliation agreements with 209 additional television stations encompassing 46 states, the District of Columbia and three U.S. possessions.&lt;ref name=recw&gt;{{cite web|title=Network Search: CW|url=http://www.rabbitears.info/search.php?request=network_search&amp;network=CW|website=[[RabbitEars]]|accessdate=November 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=recwplus&gt;{{cite web|title=Network Search: CW+|url=http://www.rabbitears.info/search.php?request=network_search&amp;network=CW%2B|website=RabbitEars|accessdate=November 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="StationIndex"&gt;{{cite web|title=Network Profile: The CW|url=http://www.stationindex.com/tv/by-net/cw|website=Station Index}}&lt;/ref&gt; Counting only conventional CW affiliates and over-the-air affiliates of The CW Plus, the network has an estimated combined national reach of 100% of all households in the United States (or 323,107,367 Americans with at least one television set); this makes The CW the largest U.S. broadcast network by population reach percentage. As of January 2016, four U.S. states (Delaware, New Hampshire, New Jersey and Vermont) lack a locally licensed CW affiliate, largely due to a lack of a need for a local affiliate as those states are located within the broadcast ranges of stations in nearby states. Delaware is served by Philadelphia O&amp;O WPSG and [[Salisbury, Maryland]] affiliate [[WMDT|WMDT-DT2]], while New Hampshire and Vermont are each served by four CW stations based in surrounding states (including Boston affiliate [[WLVI]]). New Jersey is served by WPSG and New York City affiliate WPIX.

As a newer broadcast network, The CW maintains affiliations with low-power stations (broadcasting either in [[analog television|analog]] or [[digital terrestrial television|digital]]) in a few markets, such as [[Reno, Nevada]] ([[KRNS-CD]]) and [[Boise, Idaho]] ([[KYUU-LD]]). In some markets, including both of those mentioned, these stations also maintain digital simulcasts on a subchannel of a co-owned/co-managed full-power television station. The CW also maintains a sizeable number of subchannel-only affiliations, the majority of which are with stations in cities located outside of the 50 largest Nielsen-designated markets and receive the network's programming via The CW Plus; the largest subchannel-only CW affiliate by market size, as of May 31, 2017, is [[KFMB-TV|KFMB-TV DT2]] in [[San Diego|San Diego, California]].

Currently, the [[Sinclair Broadcast Group]] is the largest operator of CW stations by numerical total, owning or providing services to 24 CW-affiliated stations, nine subchannel-only affiliates and one cable-only affiliate, covering 17% of all U.S. television markets; Tribune Broadcasting is the largest operator of CW stations in terms of overall market reach, owning or providing services to thirteen CW stations (including its three largest affiliates in New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago), covering 28% of the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The CW In Talks With Tribune As Network Faces Affiliate &amp; Streaming Renewals|url=http://deadline.com/2015/09/cw-tribune-deal-renewal-talks-netflix-hulu-1201505947/|author=Nellie Andreeva|website=Deadline.com|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|date=September 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overview===
On the day of the network launch announcement, The CW immediately announced it had reached ten-year affiliation agreements with Tribune Broadcasting and CBS Television Stations. Tribune originally committed 16 stations that were previously affiliated with The WB (including its [[Flagship (television)|flagship]] broadcast stations WGN-TV in Chicago, KTLA in Los Angeles and WPIX in New York City; another committed station, [[KSWB-TV]] in [[San Diego]], joined Fox in August 2008, and two others, [[WLVI|WLVI-TV]] in Boston and [[WCWN]] in [[Albany, New York]] were respectively sold by Tribune to Sunbeam Television and [[Freedom Communications]] shortly after the network launched), while CBS committed 11 of its UPN stations (including [[WKBD]] in Detroit, WPSG in Philadelphia, KBHK-TV (now [[KBCW (TV)|KBCW]]) in San Francisco and WUPA in Atlanta). These stations combined to reach 48% of all television households in the United States. Both companies also owned several UPN and WB-affiliated stations that did not join The CW in overlapping markets (such as [[Seattle]], Philadelphia and [[Dallas]]). As part of its affiliation agreement with the network, the Tribune Company agreed to divest its ownership interest in The WB (a move it made partly to avoid shouldering shutdown costs for The WB)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tribune.com/investors/transcripts/thecw_06.html |title=Conference Call Regarding "The CW" |accessdate=July 20, 2013 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070926231441/http://www.tribune.com/investors/transcripts/thecw_06.html |archivedate=September 26, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and did not acquire an equity stake in The CW.

The network stated that it would eventually reach 95% of all U.S. television households. In markets where separate affiliates of both UPN and The WB operated, only one station became a CW affiliate. Executives were on record as preferring the "strongest" stations among The WB and UPN's existing affiliates. As one example, the new network's first affiliate outside the core group of Tribune and CBS-owned stations, [[WJZY]] in [[Charlotte]] (which was later acquired by Fox Television Stations and converted into a Fox O&amp;O in July 2013), was tied with Atlanta O&amp;O WUPA as UPN's fifth highest-rated station. In most cases, it was obvious where the new network would affiliate; there were only a few markets (such as Philadelphia, Miami–[[Fort Lauderdale]], Boston, Charlotte and Atlanta) where the WB and UPN affiliates were both relatively strong in terms of local overall viewership. For example, one of the earliest affiliates to be announced outside the core group, [[WKCF]] in [[Orlando, Florida]], had not only been The WB's highest-rated affiliate for the virtual entirety of that network's run, but had also been the fourth highest-rated television station in [[Central Florida]].

Nearly all of The CW's affiliates were formerly affiliated with UPN or The WB, with very few having been independent stations or affiliates of other networks prior to joining the network; a notable exception was [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] affiliate [[KVCW]], which had been a fairly successful independent before joining The CW. Although it was generally understood that The CW was a merger of UPN and The WB, the new network's creation was not structured as a merger in the legal sense. Rather, it was one new network launching at the same time that two others shut down, although it did assume certain programming content, operations and management from its predecessors. As such, The CW was not obligated by existing affiliations with The WB and UPN; it had to negotiate from scratch with individual stations. As a result, in several markets, the CW affiliation is on a local station different from either the former WB and UPN stations (for example, the CW affiliation in Las Vegas ended up on KVCW, instead of former WB affiliate [[KSNV|KVMY]] or now-defunct former UPN affiliate [[KTUD-CD|KTUD-CA]]). The network has also affiliated with some [[digital subchannel]]s, usually those launched by a local [[Television network#United States|Big Four]] affiliate as a new service, in several other markets – especially if fewer than six commercial television stations existed at the time of affiliation, requiring The CW to carry its programming on a subchannel by default (for example, The CW opted to affiliate with a subchannel of WKRC-TV in Cincinnati – which has only five commercial full-power stations – instead of former WB affiliate [[WSTR-TV]], which instead became an affiliate of MyNetworkTV).

Because of the availability of "instant duopoly" digital subchannels that will likely be easily available on cable and satellite, and the overall lack of a need to settle for a secondary affiliation with shows aired in problematic timeslots that would subject the timeshifted programs to lower average viewership in certain markets, both The CW and MyNetworkTV launched with far greater national coverage than that enjoyed by UPN and The WB when they both launched in January 1995. UPN, for several years, had affiliation gaps in the top 30 markets, and by 2005 managed to cover only 86% of the country. This resulted in secondary affiliations with other networks and the resulting diluted ratings when programs were shown out of their intended timeslots, or the lack of the program airing at all (a problem experienced by many fans of the ''[[Star Trek]]'' franchise with ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'').

===Launch repercussions===
{{further|2006 United States broadcast TV realignment}}
The announcement of The CW caused the largest single shakeup in U.S. broadcast television since the [[1994 United States broadcast TV realignment|affiliation alliance between Fox and New World Communications]] in 1994 (as well as a separate alliance with Burnham Broadcasting that began a year later) and the subsequent launches of UPN and The WB the following year. While The CW's debut affected more markets, it likely did not cause the same degree of viewer confusion, as no affiliates of the four major networks dropped those affiliations to join The CW (some "Big Four" affiliations did change at this time, but for unrelated reasons). The WB and UPN were the first major television networks to shut down since the collapse of the DuMont Television Network in August 1955, although other small broadcast television networks have also ceased operations over the years.

It became clear that Fox Television Stations, which purchased several UPN-affiliated stations from that network's former co-owner Chris-Craft Industries in 2002, would be affected. Its UPN affiliates in five major markets ([[WWOR-TV|New York City]], [[KCOP|Los Angeles]], [[WPWR-TV|Chicago]], [[WDCA|Washington, D.C.]] and [[KTXH|Houston]]) did not receive affiliations with The CW, due to the agreement with Tribune, and Fox made it clear it would not even seek carriage of the network for its UPN stations in four other markets. All network logos and references were quickly removed from Fox's UPN stations. Shortly thereafter, Fox parent [[News Corporation]] (which spun off its American media and entertainment properties into [[21st Century Fox]] as part of the company's July 2013 corporate separation) announced that it would launch MyNetworkTV, a programming service meant to fill the two nightly prime time hours that UPN would vacate on the network's Fox-owned affiliates after The CW launched. Fox also offered the service to stations owned by other broadcasting groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=News Corp. to launch new mini-network for UPN stations|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2006-02-22-fox-my-network_x.htm|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|date=February 22, 2006|accessdate=January 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=News Corp. Unveils MyNetworkTV|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/news-articles/news-corp-unveils-my-network-tv/78935|author=John Eggerton|periodical=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=February 22, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=News Corporation Announces Intent to Pursue Separation of Businesses to Enhance Strategic Alignment and Increase Operational Flexibility|url=http://newscorp.com/2012/06/28/news-corporation-announces-intent-to-pursue-separation-of-businesses-to-enhance-strategic-alignment-and-increase-operational-flexibility/|publisher=[[News Corporation]]|date=June 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In markets where The WB and UPN were carried on separate stations, one of the two local outlets was left out in the merger; most of the stations that did not join The CW had signed affiliation agreements with MyNetworkTV instead, while others elected to become independent stations. Some stations (mainly digital subchannels, some cable channels that were formerly part of The WB 100+ Station Group, and struggling low-power stations) which did not affiliate with either network opted instead to shut down permanently.

===Affiliate distribution===
Like its predecessors UPN and by technicality, The WB (as none of Tribune Broadcasting's WB stations were considered to be O&amp;Os since Time Warner held majority ownership of that network), The CW does not have [[owned-and-operated station]]s in any of the three largest U.S. television markets – New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago. The network's largest owned-and-operated station is CBS-owned [[WPSG]] in [[Philadelphia]], which also became UPN's largest O&amp;O after Chris-Craft Industries (which sold most of its UPN stations, including its affiliates in [[WWOR-TV|New York City]] and [[KCOP-TV|Los Angeles]], to [[Fox Television Stations]] in 2001&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=News Corp. to Buy Chris-Craft Parent for $5.5 Billion, Outbidding Viacom|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/aug/12/business/fi-3272|author=Sallie Hofmeister|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Tribune Publishing|date=August 12, 2000|accessdate=March 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;) had its ownership stake in that network acquired by Viacom in March 2000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Viacom wins UPN so let the digestion begin|url=http://www.medialifemagazine.com/news2000/mar00/news20321.html|periodical=[[Media Life Magazine]]|date=March 2000|accessdate=May 4, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205150040/http://www.medialifemagazine.com/news2000/mar00/news20321.html|archivedate=February 5, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UPN deal done; Viacom buys out Chris-Craft share|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-62239976.html|author=Melissa Grego|author2=Joe Schlosser|periodical=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|publisher=Reed Business Information|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|date=April 10, 2000|accessdate=June 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (neither UPN nor the [[DuMont Television Network]] had an O&amp;O in Chicago at all; a similar situation arose with DuMont's O&amp;O in Los Angeles, present-day CW affiliate [[KTLA]] – which had disaffiliated from the network in 1948 shortly after the FCC ruled that it and WDTV in [[Pittsburgh]] (now [[KDKA-TV]], a CW corporate cousin through CBS Corporation), to be O&amp;Os through their then-owner [[Paramount Pictures]]' voting stock interest in DuMont).

Because Tribune Broadcasting does not maintain an ownership stake in The CW, its stations in the two respective top markets (WPIX and KTLA) are actually ''[[network affiliate|affiliates]]'' of the network; CBS Corporation owns secondary stations – both [[Independent station (North America)|independents]] – in two of the three markets, [[KCAL-TV]] in Los Angeles and [[WLNY-TV]] in the New York City market (however, while KCAL was owned by CBS at the network's launch, WLNY was not acquired by CBS until 2011; neither station carries CW programming, though, because of the network's affiliation deals with Tribune-owned stations in those markets, and in the latter case, WLNY's over-the-air signal does not serve the entire New York City market – resulting in most residents in the metropolitan area receiving the station mainly through cable or satellite – due to being licensed to the [[Long Island]] community of [[Riverhead, New York|Riverhead]], restricting its transmitter from being located more than {{convert|15|mi|km}} from its [[city of license]] under [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] regulations). Unlike with The WB and UPN (the latter network's founding owners, Chris-Craft and Viacom, both had their own station groups that formed UPN's core stations at its launch), only one of The CW's co-owners – CBS Corporation – maintains ownership of the network's owned-and-operated stations (since the summer 2017 sale of [[WPCH-TV]]/[[Atlanta]], Time Warner holds no over-the-air assets whatsoever).

===Digital multicasting and cable television===
Unlike the other major networks, The CW distributes its programming in small and certain mid-sized markets throughout the United States (generally those ranked among the bottom 110 [[Nielsen Media Research|Nielsen]] [[media market]]s) through [[The CW Plus]], a separate national feed that is carried on a mixture of full-power and [[Low-power broadcasting|low-power station]]s in some markets, and cable-only outlets and [[digital subchannel]] affiliations on major network stations in markets that do not have enough commercial stations to support a standalone CW affiliate (several of The CW Plus's digital subchannel outlets originally operated as cable-only affiliates at the network's launch). The service offers its own master schedule of syndicated and [[brokered programming]] acquired by the network (including some feature films and [[infomercial]]s) during non-network programming hours, although some CW Plus affiliates may also run local newscasts produced by a major network affiliate.

CW predecessor The WB previously had two cable-only affiliate outlets: [[WGN America]], the national [[superstation]] feed of WGN-TV at the time, from January 1995 to October 1999&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WGN Drops WB, Adds Movies, Sitcoms|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-55897252.html|author=Linda Moss|periodical=[[Multichannel News]]|publisher=[[Reed Business Information|Cahners Business Information]]|via=HighBeam Research|date=September 20, 1999|accessdate=June 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Last night Dawson's last ? WGN ceases to air WB programming|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-18522684.html|author=MaryWade Burnside|newspaper=[[The Charleston Gazette]]|publisher=The Daily Gazette Company|via=HighBeam Research|date=October 7, 1999|accessdate=June 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and network-operated [[The WB 100+ Station Group]] (the direct predecessor to The CW Plus), which was formed in September 1998 and had several of its cable-only outlets join The CW Plus at the CW network's launch. Not all of the network's cable-only affiliates were CW Plus outlets, [[WT05]] in [[Toledo, Ohio]] offered its own schedule of syndicated programs during non-network hours that was programmed by its then-owner [[Block Communications]], which also operates that market's major cable provider [[Buckeye CableSystem]] (WT05 now exists as "CW13," having been converted into a digital subchannel of [[Gray Television]]-owned ABC affiliate [[WTVG]] in October 2014). Though The CW is the only network with a station group that includes cable-only outlets, it is actually one of only three networks that have had cable-only stations within its affiliate body (ABC formerly had a cable-only affiliate in [[Winchester, Virginia]]-based [[TV3 Winchester]] until Gray shut the channel down in December 2013).

===Station standardization===
When The CW launched in September 2006, the network began branding most of its affiliates using a combination of "CW" or "The CW", and at the affiliate's choice, either the station's channel number (for example, [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] affiliate [[WNAB]] is branded as "CW58" and Seattle O&amp;O [[KSTW]] brands as "CW11") or the name of the city or region it serves. Examples of the latter include Philadelphia O&amp;O WPSG (known as "The CW Philly 57" as an homage to its prior branding as an independent station), WLVI (known at launch as "Boston's CW", though it rebranded to "CW56" after being sold to Sunbeam Television), WUPA (known as "CW Atlanta" at launch, but is now known as "CW69"), [[Waco, Texas]] subchannel affiliate [[KWTX-TV|KWTX-DT2]] (known as "CW Texas") and KVCW (branded as "CW Las Vegas"). Some stations also use the call sign either within the station logo, in on-air identification or both; examples include [[WNLO]]/[[Buffalo, New York]] and  [[WWHO]]/[[Columbus, Ohio]] ([[WBNX]]/[[Cleveland]] formerly also did so until their affiliation was terminated in July 2018).

In [[Omaha, Nebraska]], [[KXVO]] uses the dual brandings of "CW15" and "Omaha's CW". In [[Honolulu, Hawaii]], [[KHON-TV|KHON-DT2]] was originally branded as "Hawaii's CW 93" (the "93" refers to the subchannel's cable channel position on Oceanic Time Warner Cable), before it was shortened to "Hawaii's CW" in September 2014. The branding once used by WKRC-DT2/Cincinnati, Ohio was "CinCW", a [[portmanteau]] with the common nickname for the city, "Cincy" (it now brands as "The CW Cincinnati"). With the exceptions of [[WXCW]]/Fort Myers and (to a somewhat lesser extent) XETV/San Diego, all CW affiliates not owned by Tribune usually brand themselves using a version of the network logo. [[Mobile, Alabama]] CW affiliate WBPG, then known as "The Gulf Coast's CW" changed its call letters to [[WFNA (TV)|WFNA]] in December 2009 and used a similar approach around their new call letters, before becoming known as "CW 55" in September 2012 and adopting a style reflective of The CW's branding techniques once again. WISH-TV in Indianapolis, as it had during its CBS affiliation, continues to brand solely with its channel number and calls as "WISH-TV 8", with "The CW" appended where appropriate, usually only in print and radio advertising.

===Affiliate issues===

====Problems with Time Warner Cable====
Some [[Time Warner Cable]] subscribers around the country were unable to watch CW programming when the network debuted, as stations in several markets were not able to reach carriage deals with the provider to distribute the local affiliates. In markets like [[Charleston, South Carolina]]; [[El Paso, Texas]]; [[Honolulu]], Hawaii; [[Palm Springs, California]]; [[Beaumont, Texas|Beaumont]]; [[Waco, Texas|Waco]] and [[Corpus Christi, Texas]], where The CW is broadcast on a digital subchannel of one of the market's major network affiliates, there were unsuccessful attempts in getting Time Warner Cable to carry the subchannel affiliates&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Time Warner Cable Squeezes CW Stations|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/news-articles/time-warner-cable-squeezes-cw-stations/81083|author=[[John M. Higgins]]|periodical=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=October 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; (CW co-parent Time Warner had owned Time Warner Cable until it [[Corporate spin-off|spun off]] the provider into a separate company in 2009).

Some affiliates eventually signed carriage deals with Time Warner Cable, but not all of the CW affiliates received carriage on the provider's basic cable tiers (for example, [[Syracuse, New York]] affiliate [[WSTQ-LP]] can only be viewed on [[digital cable]] channel 266 in the [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]] market).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Ithaca Journal – www.theithacajournal.com – Ithaca, NY|url=http://www.theithacajournal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061128/NEWS01/611280340|newspaper=[[The Ithaca Journal]]|publisher=Gannett Company|date=November 28, 2006}} {{Dead link|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the largest market without a known affiliate is the [[Johnstown, Pennsylvania|Johnstown]]–[[Altoona, Pennsylvania|Altoona]] market, whose closest CW station is CBS-owned [[WPCW]]/[[Pittsburgh]], which is carried on TWC's Johnstown and Altoona area systems; WPCW was originally targeted to serve that area before it refocused its programming toward the Pittsburgh market in the late 1990s.

On February 2, 2007, [[Beaumont, Texas]] CBS station [[KFDM]] made its CW-affiliated subchannel available to Time Warner Cable customers in the market on channel 10. On April 20, 2007, ABC affiliate [[KVIA-TV]] in El Paso, Texas began broadcasting its CW-affiliated subchannel on Time Warner Cable channel 13.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The CW Wait Over |url=http://www.kvia.com/Global/story.asp?S=6394674 |website=[[KVIA-TV]] |publisher=[[News-Press &amp; Gazette Company]] |date=April 19, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927022003/http://www.kvia.com/Global/story.asp?S=6394674 |archivedate=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 21, 2007, [[KCWQ-LP]] made its broadcast debut on channel 5 on Time Warner Cable in the Palm Springs area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CW to debut on Time Warner|url=http://www.thedesertsun.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070420/BUSINESS06/704200345|newspaper=[[The Desert Sun]]|publisher=Gannett Company|date=April 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pappas Telecasting bankruptcy====
One of the network's major affiliate groups, [[Pappas Telecasting|Pappas Telecasting Companies]], filed for [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11 bankruptcy]] for thirteen of its television stations on May 10, 2008. Within the petition, Pappas specifically cited the network's low ratings and lackluster performance as one of many complications that had forced it to make the filing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pappastv.com/pressdetail.php?id=108&amp;prYr=2008 |title=PAPPAS TELECASTING ANNOUNCED TODAY THAT CERTAIN AFFILIATES HAVE FILED FOR CHAPTER 11 PROTECTION |accessdate=June 17, 2008 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921223623/http://www.pappastv.com/pressdetail.php?id=108&amp;prYr=2008 |archivedate=September 21, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of the stations have since been sold either in business transactions with representatives involved in Pappas's bankruptcy proceedings or via station auction processes as the company winds down operations.

Although Pappas had originally stated that none of its stations would be affected at all by the closing, two stations owned by the company that were formerly affiliated with The CW have ceased operations. On May 29, 2008, [[Yakima, Washington]] affiliate [[KCWK]] (which served the south-central portion of that state) shut down and the station's offices were closed, leaving that area without locally based CW programming and forcing cable and satellite providers to carry Los Angeles affiliate KTLA in order to provide the network's programming to their subscribers. The situation was resolved in April 2009, when [[Fisher Communications]] announced that its CBS affiliates in the area, [[KIMA-TV]] and satellite station [[KEPR-TV]], would carry the network through digital subchannel affiliations.

Subsequently, [[WLGA]] in [[Columbus, Georgia]] lost its CW affiliation in April 2009 to a subchannel of NBC affiliate [[WLTZ]] because of the network's concerns about Pappas' financial state;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=WLTZ's parent firm to carry CW Network in Columbus|url=http://www.ledger-enquirer.com/2009/04/03/672471/wltzs-parent-firm-to-carry-cw.html|author=Andrea V. Hernandez|newspaper=[[Ledger-Enquirer]]|publisher=[[The McClatchy Company]]|date=April 3, 2009|accessdate=December 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; WLGA ultimately ceased operations in June 2010 as it was unable to compete in the market as an independent station; it later resumed operations in August 2012, as an affiliate of [[WeatherNation TV]] (it is now an [[Antenna TV]] affiliate).

====Marianas Media bankruptcy====
Marianas Media signed on KTKB-LD in [[Hagåtña, Guam]] as a CW affiliate on April 20, 2009, becoming the U.S. territory's fifth commercial television outlet. However, competition from other stations in the island combined with financial problems at Marianas, which was running the station under a local marketing agreement with the troubled [[KM Communications|KM Communications Inc.]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marianas Media closes CW4, PSST|url=http://www.kuam.com/story/14353897/2011/03/30/marianas-media-announces-closure-of-cw4-psst|website=[[KUAM-TV]]|publisher=Pacific Telestations, Inc.|date=March 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; forced the station off the air on March 31, 2011. The station resumed operations the following year.

====Tribune's relations with The CW====
While [[Tribune Media]] has solid affiliation deals with The CW on several of its stations, it also maintains a strong affiliation alliance with Fox. But with new management and ownership taking over Tribune in 2008, it was apparent that the company would switch one of its CW-affiliated stations to Fox (at least those in markets without a Fox owned-and-operated station or a former O&amp;O that was acquired by Local TV, which Tribune later acquired in 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Acquisition to make Tribune Co. largest U.S. TV station operator|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/breaking/chi-tribune-buying-local-tv-20130701,0,3402241.story|author=Robert Channick|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|publisher=Tribune Publishing|date=July 1, 2013|accessdate=July 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;), adding to more questions surrounding The CW's future. In a March 2008 seminar by Tribune's then-chairman and CEO [[Sam Zell]], it was revealed that the company's San Diego outlet KSWB-TV would switch its affiliation from The CW to Fox that August, with KSWB assuming the Fox affiliation from [[XETV-TDT|XETV-TV]], which had been a Fox charter affiliate since that network's October 1986 inception. XETV (which is licensed to [[Tijuana]], [[Baja California]], Mexico under the ownership of [[Grupo Televisa]] but whose U.S. operations are programmed by [[Entravision|Bay City Television]]) was not informed of Zell's deal until it was made public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=XETV, KSWB Battle For Fox Affiliation In San Diego |url=http://radiomatthew.com/posts/xetv-kswb-battle-for-fox-affiliation-in-san-diego/ |website=RadioMatthew.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609113416/http://radiomatthew.com/posts/xetv-kswb-battle-for-fox-affiliation-in-san-diego/ |archivedate=June 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the news broke, XETV planned on suing to prevent the switch on the grounds that it would violate an affiliation contract that XETV had with Fox that was not set to expire until 2010. However, on July 2, 2008, XETV announced that it would join The CW on August 1 (the same day that KSWB became a Fox affiliate) and rebrand as "San Diego 6".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fox6.com/news/local/story.aspx?content_id=7a4bac12-8df5-48e6-8f68-d8e355f50b95 |title=XETV Becomes San Diego 6 – New Home of The CW Television Network |accessdate=October 25, 2014 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080707223418/http://www.fox6.com/news/local/story.aspx?content_id=7a4bac12-8df5-48e6-8f68-d8e355f50b95 |archivedate=July 7, 2008 |df=mdy-all }} (July 2, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Though twelve of Tribune's thirteen other CW-affiliated stations have remained with the network, all of them began to de-emphasize the network from their branding (e.g., "CW 11") in favor of one with a stronger local identity. On-air branding that excised the CW name began being implemented by the stations in July 2008, either on-air (in the case of KWGN-TV) or through their websites (as part of a redesign for all of the Tribune stations' websites).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tribune gives CW the cold shoulder|url=https://variety.com/2008/scene/markets-festivals/tribune-gives-cw-the-cold-shoulder-1117991420/|author=Michael Schneider|periodical=Variety|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=September 1, 2008|accessdate=May 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these stations eventually began reincorporating the CW branding starting in 2011, such as KDAF/Dallas, KIAH/Houston and [[KRCW-TV]]/[[Portland, Oregon]].

Tribune Company president and CEO [[Peter Liguori]] said in a May 2014 discussion at the MoffettNathanson Media &amp; Communications Summit that he was "not pleased with where the CW is [in regards to its ratings performance]," stating that the network "should not program to [young] people who don't watch [conventional] television." Liguori also stated that he would consider collaborating with the network in regards to improving its programming slate, possibly by incorporating programs from the company's Tribune Studios unit (a production division which launched shortly after Liguori was appointed president of Tribune in November 2013) onto the network, as well as having Tribune play a larger role in The CW's management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tribune CEO Says He's "Not Pleased" With CW's Performance|url=http://www.deadline.com/2014/05/tribune-ceo-says-hes-not-pleased-with-cws-performance/|author=David Lieberman|website=Deadline.com|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|date=May 15, 2014|accessdate=May 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking at [[Goldman Sachs]]' 23rd Annual Communacopia Conference in September 2014, Les Moonves acknowledged that Tribune had been looking for more input in how the network is programmed and noted that Liguori is a former programmer (having previously served in executive roles at Fox, [[FX (TV network)|FX]] and [[Discovery Communications]]), saying that "[Liguori] would like to participate. He has some good ideas. He's part of our team. Will there be some change in how the CW is structured going forward? I don't know." Moonves went on to reiterate that Tribune is "a very important part of [CBS'] future" (considering that Tribune had recently acquired the CBS affiliation for its Indianapolis station and then-CW affiliate [[WTTV]], following disagreements between CBS and longtime affiliate WISH-TV, which would eventually take over the CW affiliation in January 2015, over [[reverse compensation]] demands by the network).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Showtime Could Stream in International Markets; Moonves also hints at CW changes|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/currency/showtime-could-stream-international-markets/133869|author=Jon Lafayette|periodical=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=September 10, 2014|accessdate=October 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an October 2014 interview with ''[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]'', Liguori appeared to reverse course on his previous statements and spoke of Tribune's support of the network. Liguori said in a statement, "We are very encouraged by the recent uptick in The CW['s] ratings and the positive critical response to the new primetime lineup. In particular, [CW CEO Mark Pedowitz] has put in place a programming strategy that will help the network appeal to a wider, more inclusive audience, which is important for our stations across the country. We were glad to support the launch of the new shows through editorial and promotional initiatives, and we look forward to more continued collaboration to build upon this momentum."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bet on The CW Paying Off For the Network's Parents|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/currency/bet-cw-paying-network-s-parents/135127|periodical=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|publisher=NewBay Media|date=October 27, 2014|accessdate=March 12, 2015}} {{subscription required|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2016, The CW and Tribune began negotiations on a new affiliation deal, as the original 10-year agreement signed at the network's inception was approaching its end. Complicating matters was the desire by The CW's parent companies, CBS and Warner Bros., to stream the network's programming as a standalone pay [[Over-the-top content|OTT]] service. The impasse in negotiations resulted in a months-long standoff between the two groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/91468/tribune-impasse-is-behind-cw-ott-option|title=Tribune Impasse Is Behind CW OTT Option  –  TVNewsCheck.com|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 23, 2016,  The CW and Tribune announced they had come to a new affiliation agreement. As part of the deal, Tribune's Chicago flagship [[WGN-TV]] would leave the network and revert to being an independent station after nearly 21 years of being affiliated with The CW and its predecessor network, The WB. A major factor in this decision is WGN-TV's large use of local sports programming, which led to many pre-emptions of the CW while WGN-TV has had to move as many as 30 games a year to another local station in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2016/05/the-cw-tribune-new-affiliate-agreement-2-1201761192/|title=The CW &amp; Tribune Reach New 5-Year Agreement, Chicago Affiliation Switches To Fox-Owned Station WPWR|first=Nellie|last=Andreeva|date=May 23, 2016|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CW affiliation moved to [[WPWR-TV]], a [[Fox Television Stations]]-owned [[MyNetworkTV]] station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/cw-tribune-affiliation-wgn-1201780975/|title=CW, Tribune Stations Set Affiliation Deal as WGN-TV Chicago Goes Indie|first=Brian Steinberg, Cynthia|last=Littleton|date=May 23, 2016|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Roberts Broadcasting bankruptcy====
[[Roberts Broadcasting]] filed for Chapter 11 [[bankruptcy protection]] on October 7, 2011; the company cited the loss of the UPN affiliations on its stations in St. Louis ([[WRBU]]), [[Columbia, South Carolina]] ([[WZRB]]) and [[Jackson, Mississippi]] ([[WRBJ-TV]]) when that network shut down in favor of The CW in 2006, as much of UPN's programming consisted of minority-targeted programs that Roberts felt were compatible with their stations' target audiences (though the stations have since recovered from this setback; additionally, its station in [[Evansville, Indiana]], [[WAZE-TV]], had instead affiliated with The WB prior to 2006, as it was owned by [[South Central Communications]] until February 2007). The company had also been hit with lawsuits from Warner Bros. Television, [[Twentieth Television]] and [[CBS Television Distribution]] over its failure to pay fees for syndicated programming; Roberts eventually settled with Twentieth but lost the Warner Bros. and CBS cases.&lt;ref name=b&amp;c-robertsbankruptcy&gt;{{cite news|title=Roberts Broadcasting Files For Bankruptcy|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/475001-Roberts_Broadcasting_Files_For_Bankruptcy.php|author=Michael Malone|periodical=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|publisher=NewBay Media|date=October 10, 2011|accessdate=October 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=c&amp;p-robertsbankruptcy&gt;{{cite news|title=WAZE Owner Roberts Broadcasting files for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy|url=http://www.courierpress.com/news/2011/oct/10/waze-owner-roberts-broadcasting-files-chapter-11-b/|author=Jacob Newkirk|newspaper=Evansville Courier &amp; Press|publisher=E.

On March 24, 2011, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) canceled WAZE's license for Roberts' failure to construct its digital transmitter facilities.&lt;ref name=fcc-wazegone&gt;{{cite web|title=Re: WAZE-TV, Madisonville, Missouri|url=http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/getimportletter_exh.cgi?import_letter_id=25217|author=Kevin Harding|website=CDBS Public Access|publisher=[[Federal Communications Commission]]|date=March 24, 2011|accessdate=March 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the station continued to broadcast via its three-station analog [[broadcast relay station#translator stations|translator]] network.

On February 20, 2012, Roberts Broadcasting announced that it was exploring the possibility of selling one or all four of its television stations in order to raise enough cash to pay off its creditors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roberts Broadcasting Mulls Sale of TV Stations|url=http://www.stltoday.com/business/columns/lisa-brown/roberts-broadcasting-mulls-sale-of-tv-stations/article_cb921586-5bfe-11e1-a475-001a4bcf6878.html|author=Lisa Brown|newspaper=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]|publisher=[[Lee Enterprises]]|date=February 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 22, 2012, Roberts announced that it had sold WRBJ to the [[Trinity Broadcasting Network]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roberts brothers' TV station in new hands|url=http://www.clarionledger.com/article/20121023/BIZ/310230036/Roberts-brothers-TV-station-new-hands?nclick_check=1|author=Jeff Ayres|newspaper=[[The Clarion-Ledger]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|date=October 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the deal was approved by a bankruptcy court on January 17, 2013,&lt;ref name=stlpd-courtapproval&gt;{{cite news|title=Roberts Cos.'

On January 3, 2013, the repeater network of WAZE ceased operations; later that month on January 28, independent station WTVW hurriedly joined The CW, in order to maintain the network in the Evansville area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WAZE-TV translators shut down|url=http://jakesdtvblog.blogspot.com/2013/01/breaking-waze-tv-translators-shut-down.html|author=Jacob Newkirk|website=Jake's DTV Blog|publisher=[[Blogspot]]|date=January 3, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131218140530/http://jakesdtvblog.blogspot.com/2013/01/breaking-waze-tv-translators-shut-down.html|archivedate=December 18, 2013|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Video-on-demand services===
The CW provides [[video on demand]] access for delayed viewing of full episodes of the network's programming through various means, including via its website at CWTV.com and its [[mobile app]] for [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices (with programs streamable over [[3G]] and [[WiFi]] networks), a traditional VOD service – called The CW on Demand – that is available on most traditional cable and IPTV providers, and through content deals with [[Hulu]], [[iTunes]] and [[Netflix]].&lt;ref name="The CW on Hulu"&gt;{{cite news|title=Hulu to Get Current Season of Gossip Girl and Other CW Content|url=http://mashable.com/2011/10/28/hulu-gossip-girl-cw|author=Todd Wasserman|website=[[Mashable]]|publisher=Mashable Inc.|date=October 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CWNetflix"&gt;{{cite news|title=Netflix, CW Sign 4-Year Deal to Stream Shows|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/10/13/idUS77575804120111013|agency=Reuters|date=October 13, 2011|accessdate=October 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 14, 2007, The CW began streaming full-length episodes of several of its programs on the CWTV.com website. The most recent episodes of the network's shows are usually made available on The CW app and The CW on Demand the day after their original broadcast. However, due to restrictions imposed through its deal with the streaming service, streaming of the most recent episode of any CW program on Hulu is restricted until eight days after their initial broadcast, in order to encourage live or same-week (via both [[digital video recorder|DVR]] and cable on demand) viewing, with day-after-air streaming on either service limited to subscribers of Hulu's subscription service. The CW previously imposed a three-day delay after an episode's original airdate before making its programs available on its website and through the Hulu subscription service (then known as Hulu Plus). However, changes implemented by the network on March 15, 2012 in an effort to reduce [[copyright infringement]] of its programming content through illegal streaming and downloading internet platforms resulted in that delay being reduced to eight hours after a program's original airing through both services.&lt;ref name="The CW on Hulu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CWNetflix"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CW shortens Web streaming delay to battle piracy|url=https://variety.com/2012/digital/news/cw-shortens-web-streaming-delay-to-battle-piracy-1118051427/|author=Andrew Wallenstein|website=Variety|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|date=March 13, 2012|accessdate=July 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the video-on-demand television services provided by the other U.S. broadcast networks, The CW on Demand disables [[fast forward]]ing for content provided through the service.

On October 13, 2011, the network entered into digital distribution deals with streaming services Netflix and Hulu. The four-year Netflix agreement allows its customers to instantly watch more than 700 hours of previous seasons of The CW's current scripted series, while Hulu inked a five-year deal, giving the streaming site access to next-day content from four of the five major networks (with the exception of CW sister network CBS).&lt;ref name="The CW on Hulu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CWNetflix"/&gt;

On October 24, 2012, The CW entered into its first video-on-demand distribution deal with a pay television provider through an agreement with [[Comcast]] that allows customers to watch the four most-recent episodes of the network's primetime shows on the [[cable television|cable provider]]'s Xfinity On Demand service, along with next-day episode content. The CW On Demand, which is accessible to subscribers at no additional charge, debuted on [[Comcast Cable|Comcast Xfinity]] systems nationwide on October 25.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The CW Inks First On Demand Deal With Comcast|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/cw-inks-first-demand-deal-382290|author=Michael O'Connell|periodical=The Hollywood Reporter|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|date=October 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The CW HD===
The CW's master feed is transmitted in [[1080i]] [[high-definition television|high definition]], with all transmission of the network's programming moving to the format in June 2012. All of the network's prime time programming has been presented in HD since March 2012 (when ''America's Next Top Model'' became the final CW program to convert to the format), with the exception of certain specials produced prior to that point (such as ''[[Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer (TV special)|Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer]]'', a [[Christmas and holiday season|holiday]] special carried over to the network from The WB) and select movie presentations. The network's Saturday morning E/I block, [[One Magnificent Morning]], is also broadcast in HD, with the final SD program, the two-season daytime talk show ''[[The Robert Irvine Show]]'' converting to the format for its second to last season in September 2017 (and in turn ending American broadcast network television's standard definition age).

The network is available in HD on most of its full-power affiliates, while availability of high definition content on subchannel-only or cable-exclusive affiliates varies by market; in some of these cases, the over-the-air signal is available only in [[standard-definition television|standard definition]] (a [[16:9]] widescreen feed transmitted in [[480i]] SD is presented on some over-the-air affiliates to meet minimum requirements for presentation), with the station offering an exclusive high definition feed to cable and satellite providers. Some affiliates transmit CW programming in [[720p]] HD due to technical considerations if the network is carried on a digital subchannel of a station affiliated with another major network or if a primary feed CW affiliate carries more than one subchannel. Since June 2012, The CW Plus feed is also transmitted in HD, and the network has asked those affiliates to carry it in high definition wherever possible.

With [[CBS]] beginning to use [[16:9]] framing for all of their graphics on September 24, 2018, The CW is currently the last major network that continues to use 4:3 framing for all graphics.

===CW Seed===
CW Seed (originally called CWD or the CW Digital Studio) is a production arm that provides original content created exclusively for digital platforms focused in the areas of animation, game shows, comedy and digital personalities. Included in the service is interactivity, feedback from viewers, and social engagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CW Launches Digital Studio, Unveils Online Projects|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/cw-digital-studio-cwd-326165|author=Philiana Ng|periodical=The Hollywood Reporter|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|date=May 17, 2012|accessdate=May 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously existing as a section on The CW's main website, CW Seed was spun-off to a separate website (cwseed.com) in 2014. Original web series produced by CW Seed includes  ''Stupid Hype'', ''I Ship It'', ''How to Be a Vampire'', ''[[JoJoHead]]'', ''[[Prom Queen (web series)|Prom Queen]]'', ''[[Husbands (TV series)|Husbands]]'', and the [[Arrowverse]] series ''[[Vixen (web series)|Vixen]]'', ''[[Freedom Fighters: The Ray]]'', and ''[[Constantine: City of Demons]]''. In addition, CW Seed hosts archive programming including shows such as ''[[Birds of Prey (TV series)|Birds of Prey]]'', ''[[Hellcats]]'', ''[[Forever (2014 TV series)|Forever]]'', ''[[Everwood]]'', ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]'', ''[[Pushing Daisies]]'', ''[[Everybody Hates Chris]]'', and ''[[Max Headroom (TV series)|Max Headroom]]''.

'''''Ticket to Ride''''' is a [[turn-based strategy]] [[video game]], based upon [[Alan R. Moon]]'s [[German-style board game]] [[Ticket to Ride (board game)|of the same name]], developed by [[Next Level Games]] and published by Playful Entertainment, Inc. The title was released on June 25, 2008.&lt;ref name="release"&gt;[http://gamerscoreblog.com/team/archive/2008/06/23/559646.aspx Happy Tree Friends False Alarm and Ticket to Ride - This Week - XBLA] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626073958/http://gamerscoreblog.com/team/archive/2008/06/23/559646.aspx |date=2008-06-26 }} from GamerScoreBlog.com&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2017 Days of wonder abandoned Linux support.&lt;ref name="Linux"&gt;[https://steamcommunity.com/app/108200/discussions/0/133256959377980187/ Dropped Linux support] from steamcommunity.com&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gameplay ==
[[File:Tickettoride ss.jpg|left|thumb|Gameplay screenshot.]]
Gameplay is identical to the board game: there are two types of cards, colored train cars representing a type of cargo (e.g., black represents [[Tender locomotive|coal cars]]), and destination cards which feature two city destinations (e.g., [[Chicago]] to [[Miami]]). Each player is dealt three destination cards, and must choose at least two of them. They are also dealt six train cards.

Players may draw train cards, a new destination card, or claim a colored route on their turn. To claim a route, a player must pay with a combination of same-colored cards including [[locomotives]] which serve as wild cards. Once a route is claimed, no other player may claim it; some routes feature double routes which allow up to two players to claim it, but only if four or five players are playing. In two or three-player games, the double routes can only be claimed by one person. The players immediately earn points for each successful route they claim. At the end of the game, players earn the points listed on the destination card. If a player decides to pick a new destination card, he draws three cards and may choose any of the cards; however, the player ''must'' pick at least one destination.

The game ends when at least one of the players has expended their trains. Players are given bonuses for completed destinations, and penalized for unrealized destinations. The player with the longest contiguous route earns an additional bonus.

===Multiplayer===
''Ticket to Ride'' supports play with up to five people on [[Xbox Live]] or four people on the same console, and supports the [[Xbox Live Vision|Xbox Live Vision cam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Ticket to Ride Headed to XBLA| url= http://gamerscoreblog.com/team/archive/2008/05/12/559073.aspx | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080517020846/http://gamerscoreblog.com/team/archive/2008/05/12/559073.aspx | archivedate= 2008-05-17| work= GamerScoreBlog| date= May 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Held every two years, the '''Western Coatings Symposium''' and Show serves the people and businesses that formulate and manufacture coatings in Western USA and Canada.  Attendees learn the newest technical trends and advancements in coatings formulating, as well as develop an expanded network of key technical contacts in the industry.

The Western Coatings Symposium and Show is organized by the Los Angeles Society for Coatings Technology (LASCT), the Pacific Northwest Society for Coatings Technology (PNWSCT),  the Golden Gate Society for Coatings Technology (GGSCT) and the Arizona Society for Coatings Technology (ASCT).  The primary mandate of these four organizations is to:

* Provide educational and networking opportunities for the members
* Award scholarships/grants to students and academic institutions predominantly focused on coatings research or related fields of study.

== Western Coatings Societies Mission Statement ==

The primary mission of the Western Coating Societies (WCS) is to promote education activities and the interchange of ideas among its members and the public and to arrange for the collection and dissemination of information pertinent to the industries served by WCS, .including but not limited to paints, coatings, inks, adhesives, varnishes, and other related fields.

== History of the WCS ==

In the early 1950s, three groups known as the Golden Gate Paint and Varnish Production Club, the Los Angeles Paint and Varnish Production Club, and the Pacific Northwest Paint and Varnish Production Club collaborated to bring a national coatings symposium to the west coast, for the purpose of providing technical education and network opportunities to individuals associated with west coast paint companies that were not able to attend the coating’s conferences being held in the Midwest or on the east coast. At that time it was decided that the west coast symposium would be held on a biennial basis, rotating between the cities of Los Angeles and San Francisco with the Los Angeles Club and Golden Gate Club as hosts, respectively, and that a trade show would be included, running concurrent with the symposium.

=== The First Symposium ===

The first symposium and show was held in the spring of 1952 at the [[Millennium Biltmore Hotel|Biltmore Hotel]] in Los Angeles. The event was titled the "Pacific Coast Production Clubs Symposium with Paint Materials and Equipment Show". The second symposium and show was held in the spring of 1954 at the [[Fairmont San Francisco|Fairmont Hotel]] in San Francisco.

After the 1954 symposium and show, the Golden Gate, Los Angeles, and Pacific Northwest Clubs began meeting annually during the summer, in what was termed the "Joint Executive Meeting", to exchange ideas relative to the Clubs and discuss past and future symposiums. In the 1960s the Clubs changed their names to Golden Gate, Los Angeles, and Pacific Northwest Society for Coatings Technology, the annual summer meeting became the West Coast Societies Annual Meeting, and the Western Coatings Society for Coatings Technology (WCS) was born. The Rocky Mountain Society for Coatings Technology joined the WCS group in 1961, but unfortunately had to withdraw in 2006 due to low membership and participation within their society. The Arizona Society for Coatings Technology expressed interest in joining the WCS in 2004 and they were welcomed into the WCS in 2005.

The WCS Symposium and Show continued to be held in even years on a biennial basis, rotating between Southern California and Northern California, until 1976 when the symposium was moved to the spring of 1977 due to the Federation of Societies for Coatings Technology (FSCT) (currently the American Coatings Association, ACA) annual International Coatings Exposition (ICE) convention and paint show that was held in the fall of 1975 in Los Angeles. The WCS Symposium and Show has been held on a biennial basis on odd years ever since.

During the winter of 1999, the Golden Gate Society moved the WCS Symposium from Northern California to [[Sparks, Nevada]] due to the exorbitant expense of holding the symposium in San Francisco. An additional change to the symposium and show was the implementation of table top exhibits instead of full booth exhibit space. The symposium and show was held in Los Angeles in 2001 and this was the last WCS symposium to take place in Los Angeles and in California. The WCS Symposium and show returned to Reno during the winter of 2003.

=== A Bright Future ===

At the 2002 West Coast Societies Annual Meeting it was decided to change the rotating venue format of the symposium to the permanent neutral location of Las Vegas.  In the fall of 2005, the WCS Symposium and Show moved to its new home city of Las Vegas, Nevada.  The WCS incorporated in 2006 and currently consists of the Arizona, Golden Gate, Los Angeles, and Pacific Northwest Societies for Coatings Technology.

The '''World Shipping Council''' ('''WSC''') is the peak [[industry trade group]] representing the international liner shipping industry, which offers regularly scheduled service on fixed schedules. Most liner carriers are  [[containerization|container]] [[shipping line]]s. The WSC is headquartered in [[Washington, D.C.]] and is led by Chief Executive Chief Executive John W. Butler, former general council for the WSC and former President of the Maritime Administrative Bar Association.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldshipping.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, in response to continued problems with containers lost overboard during heavy seas, the WSC and the [[International Chamber of Shipping]] began work on a code of practice for container storage, including crew training on parametric rolling, safer stacking and marking of containers and the securing of above-deck cargo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title =Banana box slip a worry | work =Lloyd's List Daily Commercial News | publisher =Informa Australia | date =2008-02-07 | url =http://www.lloydslistdcn.com.au/informaoz/LLDCN/home.jsp?source=fresh | accessdate =2008-02-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
