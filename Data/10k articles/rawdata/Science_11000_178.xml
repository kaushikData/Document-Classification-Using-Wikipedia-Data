[[File:Tate Modern viewed from Thames Pleasure Boat - geograph.org.uk - 307445.jpg|thumb|300px|One of the world's most successful examples of adaptive reuse of old buildings is the conversion of the [[Bankside Power Station]] in London for use as the [[Tate Gallery]]. Formerly off-limits to the general public, it now receives about five million visitors a year.]]
'''Adaptive reuse''' refers to the process of reusing an old site or building for a purpose other than which it was built or designed for. Along with [[brownfield]] reclamation, adaptive reuse is seen by many as a key factor in land conservation and the reduction of [[urban sprawl]]. However adaptive reuse can become controversial as there is sometimes a blurred line between [[renovation]], [[facadism]] and adaptive reuse. It can be regarded as a compromise between [[historic preservation]] and [[demolition]].

==Definition==
Adaptive reuse deals with the issues of conservation and heritage policies. Whilst old buildings become unsuitable for their programmatic requirements, as progress in technology, politics and economics moves faster than the built environment, adaptive reuse comes in as a sustainable option for the reclamation of sites. In many situations, the types of buildings most likely to become subjects of adaptive reuse include: industrial buildings, as cities become [[gentrified]] and the process of manufacture moves away from city; political buildings, such as palaces and buildings which cannot support current and future visitors of the site; and community buildings such as churches or schools where the use has changed over time.

Adaptive reuse is seen as an effective way of reducing urban sprawl and environmental impact.&lt;ref&gt;Joachim, M. 2002, ''Adaptive reuse'', Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1 Oct. 2011 &lt;http://www.archinode.com/lcaadapt.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  By reusing an existing structure within a site, the energy required to create these spaces is lessened, as is the material waste that comes from destroying old sites and rebuilding using new materials. Through adaptive reuse old, unoccupied buildings can become suitable sites for many different types of use.

==Factors affecting adaptive reuse==

===Criteria for adaptive reuse===
While the process of adaptive reuse is a decision often made purely by companies establishing a particular brand or presence, there are often criteria for deciding whether a building should be conserved and reused or just demolished for the area of land it occupies. Some of these determining criteria include:
* The societal value of a given site; that is, the importance to the community of the use of a site by community members or visitors.
* The potential for the reuse of a particular site; the physical damage sustained to the site and its support of future use, the character of the existing site in terms of the proposed reuse.
* The historical importance of the site; in terms of both the physicality of the street-scape and the area, as well as of the role of the site in the community's understanding of the past.
* The environmental conditions of the site; whether the site is suitable climatically or can support the proposed environmental work needed in the site.

===Economic considerations===
[[File:KelsoHome SE.jpg|thumb|The [[Kelso Home for Girls]] in Baltimore, Maryland was a typical candidate for adaptive reuse, but it was razed to accommodate parking for a new athletic facility when the cost of conversion was found to be too great]]There has been much debate on the economic possibilities and viability of adaptive reuse as different corporations and companies seek to find sustainable ways to approach their corporate or retail sites.&lt;ref&gt;Hyllegard, K., Paff Ogle, J., Dunbar, B. 2003 ‘Sustainability and Historic Preservation in Retail Design: Integrating Design into a Model of the REI Denver Decision-Making Process’ Journal of Interior Design Vol. 29, No.1&amp;2, pp. 32-49&lt;/ref&gt;  There are many outcomes that affect the economic return of adaptive reuse as an avenue to reuse of a given site. Factors such as the reuse of materials and resources as well as a lesser need to involve energy, both in terms of labor and machine powered, can effectively decrease the monetary funds needed for companies to establish sites. However, there can be hidden costs in reusing old buildings such as the unknown contamination of older sites, decay and disuse affecting the usability of a building, and the possible need for modification of an older building to fit current and future [[building codes]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated505"&gt;Shipley, R., Utz, S., Parsons, M. 2006 ‘Does Adaptive reuse Pay? A Study of the Business of Building Renovation in Ontario, Canada’, International Journal of Heritage Studies Vol. 12, No. 6, pp. 505–520&lt;/ref&gt;

The economic costs differ from project to project and some professionals go as far as to assert that new build is always more economical and renovation is universally more expensive,&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn, L. 1983 ‘What Developers Think of Historic Preservation’ Urban Land Vol.42, pp. 8 – 11&lt;/ref&gt; due to their own involvement with adaptive reuse projects. Others claim that the return on investment is enhanced when using an older building because of the savings involved. One Canadian developer claims that reusing buildings generally represents a saving of between 10-12%&lt;ref name="autogenerated505"/&gt; over building new. In terms of profitability, there are also assertions that adaptive reuse projects often have an uncertainty to their profitably that newer developments lack. When looking for funding to build, these considerations must be addressed.

With many heritage sites on the agenda for government agencies, there are a number of financial incentives provided in order to increase the use of older sites in many countries.  In the provinces of Canada, some municipalities offer financial encouragement for heritage development such as, the [[City of Waterloo]] who waived the development charges for the [[Seagram]] Lofts that have been estimated to be around $700,000.&lt;ref name="autogenerated505"/&gt; Governing bodies also benefit from the reuse of once abandoned sites as once occupied, they generate tax revenue and therefore often recover the initial investment.

===Advantages of adaptive reuse===
With the debate of adaptive reuse as a sustainable avenue in the development of key sites, there are many advantages to using certain sites for redevelopment. One of these advantages is the site's location. In many cases, historical sites are often located in the centers of large cities. Due to the spatial development of a given area, these buildings can often be [[heritage-listed]] and therefore sold as an entity, rather than just for the land that they occupy, which the new tenants then have to retrofit the building for their particular purpose. Older buildings also often have a specific period character through the detailing and joinery of their constructed eras that newer or reconstructed developments lack. In certain cases such as the hospitality industry, the grand character of a site can influence the feel of their building and are used for maximum potential to enhance the site's physical attractiveness to a client.

===Barriers to adaptive reuse===
As mentioned above, adaptive reuse sometimes isn’t the most viable option for all historic sites. For some sites that have been left alone to decay by neglect, the physical damage of the site can render the site unusable both in terms of the cost to repair the damage as well as unsafe by government standards. Adaptive reuse of sites contaminated by hazardous materials such as asbestos also require special precautions during construction, although these procedures are well-established.  See, for example, http://www.labor.state.ny.us/workerprotection/safetyhealth/sh56.shtm

==By location==

===Americas===

====Canada====
As a comparatively young country, adaptive reuse is not the norm in Canada, where redevelopment has typically meant demolition and building anew. Calgary and Edmonton are particularly known for their pro-demolition culture, but they are not unique in this regard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.willferguson.ca/articles/sandstonecity.html Will Ferguson – Sandstone City]. Willferguson.ca (2002-10-07). Retrieved on 2013-12-06.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epl.ca/photo-collections?collection=Buildings Photo Collections | Edmonton Public Library] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130702042001/http://www.epl.ca/photo-collections?collection=Buildings |date=2 July 2013 }}. Epl.ca. Retrieved on 2013-12-06.&lt;/ref&gt; However, since the 1990s, adaptive use has gained traction. The conversion of former railway-centred [[warehouse district]]s to residential and commercial uses has occurred in [[Old Canadian National rail yard|Edmonton]], [[Beltline, Calgary|Calgary]], [[Central Business District, Saskatoon|Saskatoon]], [[Regina's historic buildings and precincts|Regina]], and [[Exchange District|Winnipeg]].
[[File:Distillery 3.jpg|thumb|Toronto's Distillery District was a former whiskey distillery]]
In Toronto, the [[Distillery District]], a neighbourhood in the city's southeast side, was entirely adapted from the old [[Gooderham &amp; Worts]] [[distillery]]. Other prominent re-uses include the Candy Factory on Queen Street West and the Toy Factory, in the city's [[Liberty Village]] district, both designed by [[Quadrangle Architects]], a firm specializing in adaptive re-use in Toronto and elsewhere. Vancouver's [[Yaletown]], an upscale neighbourhood established in the 1990s, features warehouses and other small-industrial structures and spaces converted into apartments and offices for the gentrification of the area. Vancouver's [[Granville Island]] also demonstrates a successful mix of adaptive reuse as well as retention of traditional uses in the same district. Montreal's [[Griffintown]], [[Old Port of Montreal|Old Port]], and [[Lachine Canal]] areas all feature ex-industrial areas that have been reused or will do so in the future on current plans.

Other noted adaptive reuse projects in the 2010s have included the [[Laurentian School of Architecture]] in [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], which is incorporating several historic buildings in the city's downtown core into its new campus, similar to the downtown campus of [[NSCAD University]] in Halifax, and Mill Square in [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario|Sault Ste. Marie]], an ongoing project to convert the derelict [[St. Mary's Paper]] mill into a mixed-use cultural and tourism hub.&lt;ref name=designers&gt;[http://www.northernontariobusiness.com/Regional-News/sault-ste-marie/2014/05/Designers-hired-for-Sault-redevelopment-project.aspx "Designers hired for Sault redevelopment project"]. ''[[Northern Ontario Business]]'', 15 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of former military bases in Canada, declared surplus in the 1990s, have also proven to be opportune for adaptive reuse. An example is the former [[CFB Cornwallis]] in rural Nova Scotia which was largely converted, without demolitions, into a [[business park]].

====United States====
[[File:BaltimorePowerPlant.JPG|thumb|[[Pratt Street Power Plant]] in Baltimore, Maryland, United States, converted into retail, restaurants, and offices.]]
[[File:Western Metal Supply Co..jpg|thumb|right|The Western Metal Building as seen during a game.]]
[[Ghirardelli Square]] in San Francisco was the first major adaptive reuse project in the United States, opening in 1964. Urban waterfronts, historically used as points for industrial production and transport, are now selling-points for home buyers and renters. In American city neighborhoods that have seen racial and ethnic demographic changes over the last century, some houses of worship have been converted for other religions, and some others have been converted into residences.

A large number of brick mill buildings in the Northeast United States have undergone [[mill conversion]] projects. In the United States, especially in the [[Northeast United States|Northeast]] and [[Midwest]], [[loft]] housing is one prominent result of adaptive reuse projects. Formerly-[[industry|industrial]] areas such as the [[Meatpacking District, Manhattan|Meatpacking District]] in New York City, [[Callowhill, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Callowhill]] in [[Philadelphia]] and [[South of Market, San Francisco|SoMa]] in San Francisco are being transformed into residential neighborhoods through this process. This transformation is sometimes associated with [[gentrification]]. [[Station Square]] in [[Pittsburgh]] [[Pennsylvania]] is an example of a mile-long former [[Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad]] terminal and headquarters being converted into a retail, office, hotel, and tourist destination. The [[Pratt Street Power Plant]] in Baltimore was converted to offices, retail, and restaurants. An example of adaptive reuse conversion to office space are [[The Hilliard Mills]]. The adaptive reuse of Empire Stores will transform seven abandoned coffee warehouse in [[Brooklyn Bridge Park]] in New York City into office, retail, restaurant and a rooftop public park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mikebloomberg.com/index.cfm?objectid=E99DF405-C29C-7CA2-F6F4E9B623E06B15 |title=Midtown Equities to Redevelop Empire Stores and St. Ann's Warehouse to Develop Tobacco Warehouse at Brooklyn Bridge Park |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=4 September 2013 |website=www.mikebloomberg.com |accessdate=5 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211012140/http://mikebloomberg.com/index.cfm?objectid=E99DF405-C29C-7CA2-F6F4E9B623E06B15 |archivedate=11 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/26/nyregion/brooklyn-takes-another-pass-at-revitalizing-an-abandoned-waterfront-warehouse.html?_r=0 |title= Another Pass at Revitalizing Abandoned Warehouse Space on the Waterfront|last1= Dunlap |first1= David |date= 25 September 2013 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other museums adapted from old factories include "MassMOCA",  the [[Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art]], the [https://web.archive.org/web/20060206090839/http://www.robertwilson.com/watermill/watermill.htm Watermill Center] in Long Island, New York, and The [[Dia Art Foundation]] Museum in upstate New York.

In [[San Diego, California]], the historic brick structure of the Western Metal Supply Co. building at 7th Avenue (between K and L Streets) was preserved and incorporated into the design of [[Petco Park]], the new [[baseball]]-only ballpark of the [[San Diego Padres]], and can be prominently seen in the left-field corner of that ballpark. It now houses the team's flagship gift shop, luxury rental suites, a restaurant and rooftop bleachers, and its southeast corner serves as the ballpark's left field foul pole.

[[File:Malthouse richmond.jpg|thumb|left|The Malthouse apartments in [[Richmond, Victoria|Richmond]], [[Melbourne]], Australia is a conversion of a former grain silo by [[Nonda Katsalidis]].]]

===Australia===
In Australia, there have been a number of adaptive reuse projects as the main cities have turned from industrial areas into areas of high value and business areas. In Sydney, sites such as the old [[Sydney Mint]] have been renovated and adapted into inner-city headquarters for the [[Historic Houses Trust of New South Wales]]. The movement of the city from an industrial, working class area into a gentrified area with high house prices has helped a number of adaptive reuse sites to exist within such an area, the old [[Hyde Park Barracks, Sydney|Hyde Park Barracks]] building has also been transformed from an old jail into a museum which documents and records the history of Australia's first settlers and convicts.

The industrial history of Australia has also been an influencing factor in determining the types of buildings and areas which have gone on to become adaptive reuse sites, especially in the realms of private residences and community based buildings. Some such sites include, [[Nonda Katsalidis]]’ Malthouse apartments in Richmond, a conversion of a former grain silo and the South Australian site of the Balhannah Mines which was adapted into a private residence and has received awards from the [[Housing Industry Association]] and the Design Institute of Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Government Department of the Environment and Heritage 2004, "Adaptive reuse – Preserving our past", DEH, Canberra&lt;/ref&gt;

In Adelaide four prominent, heritage listed 19th Century buildings in poor repair were restored, refurbished and given new roles by the South Australian Government during the [[Rann Government]] (2002 to 2011). The [[Torrens Building]] in Victoria Square, former headquarters of the Registrar-General, was restored and adapted to become the Australian campus for both Carnegie Mellon University and University College London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.australia.cmu.edu Carnegie Mellon University]&lt;/ref&gt; The former Adelaide Stock Exchange building was purchased, restored and adapted to become the Science Exchange for the Royal Institution Australia and the Australian Science Media Centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-06-14/iconic-buildings-of-adelaide-the-stock-exchange/7508792|title=Iconic buildings of Adelaide: Come inside the Stock Exchange |last=Williamson |first=Brett |publisher=891 ABC Adelaide |date=14 June 2016 |accessdate=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Torrens Parade Ground and building were restored for use as a headquarters for veterans' organisations.&lt;ref&gt;Cabinet Documents, Department of Premier and Cabinet, July 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly $50 million was committed to restore and adapt the large Glenside Psychiatric Hospital and precinct as the new Adelaide Studios of the South Australian Film Corporation opened by Premier Rann in October 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.safilm.com.au South Australian Film Corporation ]&lt;/ref&gt; And the 62 hectare former Mitsubishi Motors plant is being adapted to become a clean manufacturing centre and education and training hub for Flinders University and TAFE.&lt;ref&gt;Sydney Morning Herald,28 May 2011. Gary Hitchens, "Rann vision shows the way in economic renewal"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
[[File:Tate modern london 2001 03.jpg|thumb|The [[Bankside Power Station]] in London was converted for use as the [[Tate Gallery]]. Shown is the former [[turbine hall]], used to house exhibits.]]
[[File:5 Lodz 068.jpg|thumb|right|One of the entrances to Manufaktura in [[Łódź]], Poland]]
In Europe, the main forms of adaptive reuse have been around former palaces and unused residences of the different European royal families into publicly accessible galleries and museums. Many of the spaces have been restored with period finishes and display different collections of art, and design. In Paris, France, the most famous example of adaptive reuse is the [[Musée du Louvre]], a former palace built in the late 12th century under Philip II and opened to the public as a museum in 1793. Also, in London, England, the [[Queen's House]], a former royal residence built around 1614, has become part of the [[National Maritime Museum]] and houses the museum's fine art collection.

The [[Tate Modern]], also in London is another example of adaptive reuse in the European continent, unlike other adaptive reuse galleries in Europe, the Tate Modern takes full advantage of the site of the former [[Bankside Power Station]], which involved the refurbishment of the old, abandoned power station. The wide industrial space has proven to be a worthy backdrop to modern art, with the famous turbine hall hosting artists including [[Olafur Eliasson]], [[Rachel Whiteread]] and [[Ai Weiwei]].

Other famous adaptive reuse sites in Europe include the [[Maastricht]] branch of the [[Selexyz]] chain in the Netherlands. This project received 2007 Lensvelt de Architect interior design award for its innovative reuse and is number one on ''[[The Guardian]]'''s worldwide top ten bookstores list.&lt;ref&gt;Dodson, S. 2008, Top shelves, ''The Guardian'', London, UK viewed 1 October 2011&lt; https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jan/11/bestukbookshops&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Łódź]], Poland, the [[Izrael Poznański]] mills have been turned into the {{convert|69|ha|adj=on}} [[Manufaktura]] [[mixed-use development]], including a mall, 3 museums, multi-cinema and restaurants.

'''Alfred John Jukes-Browne''', [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] FGS (16 April 1851 - 14 August 1914) was a [[uK|British]] invertebrate [[palaeontologist]] and [[Stratigraphy|stratigrapher]].

He was born Alfred John Browne near Wolverhampton in 1851 to Alfred Hall and Caroline Amelia (née Jukes) Browne. His uncle was the geologist [[Joseph Beete Jukes]], well known for his work on the English and Irish geological surveys. Browne added his mother's maiden name of Jukes to his own as soon as he came of age. He was educated at [[Highgate School]] (1863–1868) and gained a BA at [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's College]], Cambridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |year=1914 |title=Alfred John Jukes-Browne, F.R.S. |journal=Nature |volume=93 |issue= |pages=667–668 |publisher= |doi=10.1038/093667b0 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v93/n2339/pdf/093667b0.pdf |accessdate=28 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He secured a post in 1874 on the staff of the [[British Geological Survey|Geological Survey]] and was chiefly occupied in mapping parts of Suffolk, Cambridge, Rutland, and Lincoln up to 1883 and then entrusted with the preparation of a monograph on the British Upper Cretaceous rocks. He subsequently wrote a number of books on the subject. He retired from the Geological Survey in 1902 on account of ill-health.

He was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Persons&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27jukes%27%29 |title=Fellow details, Alfred John Jukes-Browne |publisher=The Royal Society |date= |accessdate=28 April 2013 }}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in Devon in 1914. He had married Emma Jessie Smith in 1881, who died giving birth to their second child in 1892.

[[File:Subparhelic circle flickr fdecomite.jpg|thumb|Centred on the antisolar point, this photo features various antisolar/subhorizon [[halo (optical phenomenon)|haloes]], as viewed from a plane flying from [[Brussels]] to [[Madrid]] on 7 August 2006.&lt;br /&gt;(Credit: Francesco De Comité)]]

The '''antisolar point''' is the [[vanishing point|abstract point]] on the [[celestial sphere]] directly opposite of the [[Sun]] from an observer's [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]].&lt;ref name="timherd"&gt;{{cite web |first=Tim |last=Herd |url=http://www.timherd.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/angularmeasurements.pdf |title=Angular Measurements in the sky |work=Kaleidoscope Sky |page=27 |publisher=Abrams |year=2007 |isbn=0-8109-9397-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the antisolar point lies above the [[horizon]] when the Sun is below it, and vice versa. On a [[daytime|sunny day]], the antisolar point can be easily found; it is located within the [[shadow]] of the observer's head. Like the [[zenith]] and [[nadir]], the antisolar point is not fixed in [[three-dimensional space]], but is defined relative to the observer. Each observer has their own antisolar point, which moves along with them as they change position.

The antisolar point forms the [[centre (geometry)|geometric center]] of several [[optical phenomena]], including subhorizon [[halo (optical phenomenon)|haloes]], [[rainbow]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atoptics.co.uk/rainbows/primary.htm |title=Primary rainbows |publisher=atoptics.co.uk |first=Les |last=Cowley |accessdate=13 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[glory (optical phenomenon)|glories]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atoptics.co.uk/droplets/glory.htm |title=The Glory |publisher=atoptics.co.uk |first=Les |last=Cowley}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[heiligenschein]]. Occasionally, around [[sunset]] or [[sunrise]], [[anticrepuscular rays]] appear to converge toward the antisolar point near the horizon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atoptics.co.uk/atoptics/anti1.htm |title=Anticrepuscular rays |publisher=atoptics.co.uk |first=Les |last=Cowley |accessdate=13 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is an [[optical illusion]] caused by perspective; in reality, the "rays" (i.e. bands of shadow) run near-parallel to each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atoptics.co.uk/fz892.htm |title=Antisolar or anticrepuscular rays |publisher=atoptics.co.uk |first=Les |last=Cowley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also around the antisolar point, the [[gegenschein]] is often visible in a moonless [[night sky]] away from [[light pollution|city lights]], arising from the [[backscatter]] of [[sunlight]] by [[interplanetary dust]]. In [[astronomy]], the [[full Moon]] or a [[planet]] in [[opposition (planets)|opposition]] lies around the antisolar point. During a total [[lunar eclipse]], the full Moon enters the [[umbra]] of [[Earth's shadow]], which the planet has been casting onto [[atmosphere of Earth|its atmosphere]], into space, and toward the antisolar point.

== Anthelic point ==
The '''anthelic point''' is often used as a synonym for the antisolar point, but the two should be differentiated.&lt;ref name="timherd" /&gt;
While the antisolar point is directly opposite the sun, always below the horizon when the sun is up, the anthelic point is opposite but at the same elevation as the sun, and is therefore located on the [[parhelic circle]]. There are several [[halo (optical phenomenon)|halo phenomena]] that are centered on or converge on the anthelic point, such as the [[anthelion]], Wegener arcs, Tricker arcs and the parhelic circle itself.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Wünsche; Jim Foster, [http://epod.usra.edu/blog/2006/04/anthelion-and-anthelic-arcs.html Anthelion and anthelic arcs], 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walter Tape, ''Atmospheric Halos'', ISSN 0066-4634, {{ISBN|0875908349}}, American Geophysical Union, 1994, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Les Cowley.

[[Image:Argo submersible.jpg|thumb|250px|''Argo'' is launched from the ''[[RV Knorr|Knorr]]'' during the 1985 ''Titanic'' expedition.]]
'''''Argo''''' is an unmanned deep-towed undersea video camera sled developed by Dr. [[Robert Ballard]] through [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute]]'s Deep Submergence Laboratory.  ''Argo'' is most famous for its role in the discovery of the [[Wreck of the RMS Titanic|wreck of the RMS ''Titanic'']] in 1985. Argo would also play the key role in Ballard's discovery of the wreck of the battleship ''[[German battleship Bismarck|Bismarck]]'' in 1989.

The towed sled, capable of operating depths of 6,000 meters (20,000 feet), meant 98% of the ocean floor was within reach. The original Argo, used to find Titanic, was 15 feet long, 3.5 feet tall, and 3.5 feet wide and weighed about 4,000 pounds in air. It had an array of cameras looking forward and down, as well as [[strobe light|strobes]] and [[incandescent light]]ing to illuminate the ocean floor. It could acquire wide-angle film and television pictures while flying 50 to 100 feet above the sea floor, towed from a surface vessel, and could also zoom in for detailed views.&lt;ref name="Titanic discovery"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.whoi.edu/page.do?pid=83577&amp;tid=3622&amp;cid=130989|title=Ships &amp; Technology used during the Titanic Expeditions|publisher=Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution|accessdate=2014-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aurostibite''' is an [[Cubic (crystal system)|isometric]] [[gold]] [[antimonide]] [[mineral]] which is a member of the [[pyrite]] group. Aurostibite was discovered in 1952 and can be found in [[hydrothermal]] [[gold]]-[[quartz]] veins, in [[sulfur]]-deficient environments that contain other [[antimony]] minerals. The mineral can be found in [[Yellowknife, Northwest Territories|Yellowknife]] in the [[Northwest Territories]] of [[Canada]], and the [[Timiskaming District]] in [[Ontario]], Canada. Antimonides are rare and are normally placed in the sulfide class by [[mineralogist]]s.

'''Calx''' is a substance formed from an ore or mineral that has been heated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/calx|title=calx {{!}} Definition of calx in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2017-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calx, especially of a metal, is now known as an [[oxide]]. According to the obsolete [[phlogiston theory]], the calx was the true elemental substance, having lost its phlogiston in the process of [[combustion]]. {{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

"Calx" is also sometimes used in older texts on artist's techniques to mean [[calcium oxide]]. {{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

==Etymology==
Calx is Latin for [[chalk]] or [[limestone]], from the Greek χάλιξ (''khaliks'', “pebble”).  It is not to be confused with the Latin [[homonym]] meaning [[heel]]bone (or [[calcaneus]] in modern medical Latin), which has an entirely separate derivation.

==In popular culture==
*[[United Kingdom|UK]] [[electronic music]] artist [[Aphex Twin]] named four of his tracks after differently coloured calxes (green, yellow, blue and red).

The '''Classification of Instructional Programs''' ('''CIP''') is a [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] of [[List of academic disciplines|academic disciplines]] at institutions of [[higher education]] in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].

The CIP was originally developed by the [[National Center for Education Statistics]] (NCES) of the [[United States Department of Education]] in 1980 and was revised in 1985, 1990, 2000 and 2010. The 2010 edition (CIP 2010) is the fourth and current revision of the taxonomy. Instructional programs are classified by a six-digit CIP at the most granular level and are classified according to the two-digit and four-digit prefixes of the code. For example, "Forensic Science and Technology" has the six-digit code 43.0106, which places it in "Criminal Justice and Corrections" (43.01) and "Homeland Security, Law Enforcement, Firefighting and Related Protective Services" (two-digit CIP 43).

{{Other uses|Creepy (disambiguation)}}

'''Creepiness''' is the state of being [[wikt:creepy|creepy]], or causing an unpleasant feeling of [[fear]] or [[wikt:unease|unease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2015/12/26/what-is-creepiness/|title=What is “creepiness”? - Sociological Images| |first=The Society|last=Pages|website=thesocietypages.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person who exhibits creepy behaviour is called a '''creep'''. Certain traits or hobbies may make people seem creepy to others. The internet has been described as increasingly creepy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-age-of-creepiness|title=The Age of Creepiness|website=The New Yorker}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adam Kotsko]] has compared the modern conception of creepiness to the [[Freudian]] concept of ''[[unheimlich]]''. The term has also been used to describe [[paranormal]] or [[supernatural]] phenomena.

==History and studies==
[[File:Clown chili peppers.jpg|thumb|140px||Clowns are thought by some as creepy]]
The concept of creepiness has only recently been formally addressed in [[social media marketing]].&lt;ref&gt;Bikramjit Rishi, Subir Bandyopadhyay ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=epcuDwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=snippet&amp;q=creepy%20OR%20creepiness&amp;f=false Contemporary Issues in Social Media Marketing]''
1317193989  2017 "In this chapter, we define creepiness and discuss how privacy and perceived creepiness differ. Then, we explain why creepiness matters and provide recommendations to minimize the negative effect of perceived creepiness on customer ..."&lt;/ref&gt; In the abstract the feeling of "creepiness" is subjective: for example some [[dolls]] have been described as creepy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/69472/what-creepiness|title=What is 'Creepiness'?|date=6 October 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the modern attribute of "creepiness" includes the feeling of social stalking and privacy invasions. For example, the practice of [[Real-time ridesharing|ride share]] service [[Uber (company)|Uber]] monitoring the post-ride activity of its passengers has been described as creepy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2017/08/29/uber-is-getting-rid-creepy-tracking-feature-in-its-app.html|title=Uber is getting rid of a creepy tracking feature in its app|first=Chris|last=Ciaccia|date=29 August 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 the company announced that they would be ending this practice.  An example of purported creepy behavior is that by the purity pledgers of the purity movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rewire.news/article/2010/11/10/daddy-abstinence-worldtough-women/|title=Daddy I Do: "Purity" World is Tough for Women - Rewire.News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Genderization==
A 2016 study by Francis McAndrew and Sara Koehnke from [[Knox College (Illinois)]] surveyed 1,342 people of all ages (1,029 females and 312 male) about what kind of traits the subjects found creepy if a friend was describing meeting someone new to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencealert.com/how-creepy-are-you-scientists-have-published-the-first-definitive-measure-of-creepiness|title=Scientists Have Published The First Definitive Study of Creepiness|first=Fiona|last=MacDonald|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that men were more likely to be seen as creepy than women. Females are more likely than males to perceive sexual threat from a creepy person. Unpredictability is an important component of creepiness. Also hobbies and occupations related to handling the dead, clowns, and [[bird watching]] were commonly thought as creepy. A post on Jezebel has said that there exists a blurriness and ill-defined difference between healthy forms of male sexual expression and being creepy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://jezebel.com/5658193/why-do-we-demonize-men-who-are-honest-about-their-sexual-needs|title=Why Do We Demonize Men Who Are Honest About Their Sexual Needs?|first=Clarisse |last=Thorn|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''creep'' is typically applied to unattractive people, a facet that has resulted in some analysts describing the term as cacophobic.&lt;ref&gt;van der Meer, Job, et al. "[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yanda_Rood/publication/51747607_Prevalence_demographic_and_clinical_characteristics_of_body_dysmorphic_disorder_among_psychiatric_outpatients_with_mood_anxiety_or_somatoform_disorders/links/0c96053c4d469a57a3000000/Prevalence-demographic-and-clinical-characteristics-of-body-dysmorphic-disorder-among-psychiatric-outpatients-with-mood-anxiety-or-somatoform-disorders.pdf Prevalence, demographic and clinical characteristics of body dysmorphic disorder among psychiatric outpatients with mood, anxiety or somatoform disorders]."

Rahm met King [[Hussein of Jordan]] in 1974 at the [[Abbotsford Air Show]] in [[British Columbia]].&lt;ref name="Berriochoa"/&gt; Hussein asked him to come to [[Jordan]] and train the [[Royal Jordanian Falcons]] aerobatics team.

Rahm died performing a combination of a [[Lomcevak]], [[tailslide]] and [[stall turn]] in a [[Pitts Special]]. Rahm's wife, Katy Rahm, and King Hussein were both present. Hussein attempted to pull Rahm from his burning plane, but Rahm had already died. Writer [[Annie Dillard]] wrote an essay about Rahm called "The Stunt Pilot", reprinted as the last chapter of her collection, ''[[Annie Dillard#The Writing Life|The Writing Life]]''.&lt;ref name="Dillard"/&gt; Rahm's widow later wrote a memoir, ''Flying High: Soaring Above the Tragedies of Life''.&lt;ref name="Memoir"/&gt;

'''''Eight Little Piggies''''' (1993) is the sixth volume of collected [[essay]]s by the [[Harvard University|Harvard]] [[paleontology|paleontologist]] [[Stephen Jay Gould]]. The essays were selected from his monthly column "The View of Life" in ''[[Natural History (magazine)|Natural History]]'' magazine, to which Gould contributed for 27 years. The book deals, in typically discursive fashion, with themes familiar to Gould's writing: evolution and its teaching, science biography, probabilities and common sense.

The title essay, "Eight Little Piggies", explores concepts such as [[archetypes]] and [[polydactyly]] via the anatomy of early [[tetrapods]]. Other essays discuss themes such as the scale of extinction, vertebrate anatomy, grand [[evolution|patterns of evolution]], and [[human nature]].

==From ''Publishers Weekly''==
{{cquote|''In his latest collection of essays originally published in Natural History magazine, paleontologist Gould examines diverse and diverting topics. The title piece refers to toes, and we learn that five is not necessarily the optimum number. Gould re-examines the work of astronomer Edmund Halley and 16th-century Irish Archbishop James Ussher, who pinpointed the moment of creation (Oct. 23, 4004 B.C.); Gould finds an "invisible hand" connecting William Paley, Charles Darwin and Adam Smith. His recollection of an incident in his childhood leads to a discussion of selective memory. Other topics are the extinction of land snails on Moorea, development of the tiny bones of the ear, romanticism about the past and Gould's own ecological "Golden Rule" for our planet. He writes about the threatened red squirrel of Arizona and the "evolution" of old tires into sandals. This collection, easily equal to The Panda's Thumb and Bully for Brontosaurus, will not disappoint Gould's fans.''}}

==Concept==
Because the differentiation matrix, &lt;math&gt;D &lt;/math&gt;, in a pseudospectral method is square, higher-order derivatives of any polynomial, &lt;math&gt; y &lt;/math&gt;, can be obtained by powers of &lt;math&gt;D &lt;/math&gt;,
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\dot y &amp;= D Y \\ 
\ddot y &amp; = D^2 Y \\
&amp;{} \  \vdots \\
y^{(\beta)} &amp;= D^\beta Y
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; Y &lt;/math&gt; is the pseudospectral variable and &lt;math&gt; \beta &lt;/math&gt; is a finite positive integer.  
By differential flatness, there exists functions &lt;math&gt; a &lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt; b &lt;/math&gt; such that the state and control variables can be written as,

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
x &amp; = a(y, \dot y, \ldots, y^{(\beta)}) \\ 
u &amp; = b(y, \dot y, \ldots, y^{(\beta + 1)})
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The combination of these concepts generates the flat pseudospectral method; that is, x and u are written as,
:&lt;math&gt; x = a(Y, D Y, \ldots, D^\beta Y) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; u = b(Y, D Y, \ldots, D^{\beta + 1}Y) &lt;/math&gt;
Thus, an optimal control problem can be quickly and easily transformed to a problem with just the Y pseudospectral variable.&lt;ref name = "rf-tac" /&gt;

The model is on almost uniform [[icosahedral-hexagonal grid]]. The GME grid point approach avoids the disadvantages of spectral techniques as well as the pole problem in latitude–longitude grids and provides a data structure well suited to high efficiency on distributed memory parallel computers.

The GME's approach to a global grid would later be utilized by the [[Flow-following, finite-volume Icosahedral Model]] (FIM), an experimental model currently in development in the United States.

{{Quantum field theory}}

In the terminology of [[quantum field theory]], a '''ghost''', '''ghost field''', or '''gauge ghost''' is an unphysical state in a [[gauge theory]]. Ghosts are necessary to keep [[gauge invariance]] in theories where the local fields exceed a number of physical [[degrees of freedom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Faddeev|first=Ludwig D.|author-link=Ludvig Faddeev|date=2009|title=Faddeev-Popov ghosts|url=http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Faddeev-Popov_ghosts|journal=[[Scholarpedia]]|language=en|volume=4|issue=4|pages=7389|doi=10.4249/scholarpedia.7389|issn=1941-6016|via=|bibcode=2009SchpJ...4.7389F}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|For example in [[electrodynamics]], in order to maintain manifest [[Lorentz invariance]], one uses a four component [[Magnetic vector potential|vector potential]] &lt;math&gt;A_\mu(x)&lt;/math&gt; , whereas the [[photon]] has only two polarizations. Thus, one needs a suitable mechanism in order to get rid of the unphysical degrees of freedom. Introducing fictitious fields, the ghosts, is one way of achieving this goal. |[[Ludvig Faddeev]]}}

== Good ghosts ==

===Faddeev–Popov ghosts===
{{main|Faddeev–Popov ghost}}

Faddeev–Popov ghosts are extraneous [[field (physics)|fields]] which are introduced to maintain the consistency of the [[path integral formulation]]. They are named after [[Ludvig Faddeev]] and [[Victor Popov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Faddeev|first=Ludwig D.|author-link=Ludvig Faddeev|last2=Popov|first2=Victor N.|author-link2=Victor Popov|date=1967|title=Feynman diagrams for the Yang-Mills field|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0370269367900676|journal=Physics Letters B|volume=25|issue=1|pages=29–30|doi=10.1016/0370-2693(67)90067-6|issn=0370-2693|via=|bibcode=1967PhLB...25...29F}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Faddeev–Popov ghosts are sometimes referred to as "good ghosts".

=== Goldstone bosons ===

[[Goldstone boson]]s are sometimes referred to as ghosts. Mainly, when speaking about the vanishing [[boson]]s of the [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]] of the [[Electroweak interaction|electroweak symmetry]] through the [[Higgs mechanism]]. These ''good'' ghosts are artefacts of gauge fixing. The longitudinal polarization components of the [[W and Z bosons]] correspond to the Goldstone bosons of the spontaneously broken part of the electroweak symmetry [[Special unitary group|SU(2)]]&amp;otimes;[[Circle group|U(1)]], which, however, are not observable. Because this symmetry is gauged, the three would-be Goldstone bosons, or ghosts, are "eaten" by the three [[gauge boson]]s (''W&lt;sup&gt;±&lt;/sup&gt;'' and ''Z'') corresponding to the three broken generators; this gives these three gauge bosons a mass, and the associated necessary third polarization degree of freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/19468842|title=Introduction to elementary particles|last=Griffiths|first=David J.|date=1987|publisher=Wiley|year=|isbn=0471603864|location=New York|pages=|oclc=19468842|author-link=David J. Griffiths}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bad ghosts ==

"Bad ghosts" represent another, more general meaning of the word "ghost" in theoretical physics: states of negative norm,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hawking|last1=|first=Stephen W.|first1=|author-link=Stephen Hawking|last2=Hertog|first2=Thomas|author-link2=Thomas Hertog|date=|year=2001|title=Living with Ghosts|url=|journal=Physical Review D|volume=65|issue=10|pages=|arxiv=hep-th/0107088|bibcode=2002PhRvD..65j3515H|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.65.103515|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or fields with the wrong sign of the [[kinetic term]], such as [[Pauli–Villars regularization|Pauli–Villars ghosts]], whose existence allows [[Negative probability|the probabilities to be negative]] thus violating [[Unitarity (physics)|unitarity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Extra Dimensions in Space and Time |author=Itzhak Bars, John Terning |page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ghost particles could obtain the symmetry or break it in gauge fields. The "good ghost" particles actually obtain the symmetry by unchanging the "[[gauge fixing]] [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]]" in a gauge transformation, while bad ghost particles break the symmetry by bringing in the [[Non-abelian gauge theories|non-abelian]] G-matrix which does change the symmetry, and this was the main reason to introduce the gauge covariant and contravariant derivatives.

=== Ghost condensate ===

{{multiple issues|
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2017}}
{{expert needed|1=Physics|date=May 2015}}
|section=yes
}}

A '''ghost condensate''' is a speculative proposal in which a ghost, an excitation of a field with a wrong sign of the kinetic term, acquires a [[vacuum expectation value]]. This phenomenon breaks [[Lorentz invariance]] [[spontaneous symmetry breaking|spontaneously]]. Around the new [[vacuum state]], all excitations have a positive norm, and therefore the probabilities are positive definite.

We have a real [[scalar field]] φ with the following action

:&lt;math&gt;S=\int d^4x \left[aX^2-bX\right]&lt;/math&gt;

where ''a'' and ''b'' are positive [[coefficient|constants]] and

:&lt;math&gt;X\ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \frac{1}{2}\eta^{\mu\nu}\partial_\mu \phi \partial_\nu \phi&lt;/math&gt;

using the [[sign convention]] in the (+, −, −, −) [[metric signature]].

The theories of ghost condensate predict specific [[non-Gaussianity|non-Gaussianities]] of the [[cosmic microwave background]]. These theories have been proposed by [[Nima Arkani-Hamed]], [[Markus Luty]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arkani-Hamed|first=Nima|last2=Cheng|first2=Hsin-Chia|last3=Luty|first3=Markus A.|last4=Mukohyama|first4=Shinji|date=2004-05-29|title=Ghost Condensation and a Consistent Infrared Modification of Gravity|journal=Journal of High Energy Physics|volume=2004|issue=05|pages=074–074|doi=10.1088/1126-6708/2004/05/074|issn=1029-8479|arxiv = hep-th/0312099 |bibcode = 2004JHEP...05..074H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately, this theory allows for [[superluminal]] propagation of information in some cases and has no [[lower bound]] on its energy. This model doesn't admit a [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] formulation (the [[Legendre transform]] is multi-valued because the momentum function isn't convex) because it is [[Anticausal system|acausal]]. Quantizing this theory leads to problems.

=== Landau ghost ===
{{main|Landau pole}}

The [[Landau pole]] is sometimes referred as the '''Landau ghost'''. Named after [[Lev Landau]], this ghost is an inconsistency in the [[renormalization]] procedure in which there is no [[asymptotic freedom]] at large energy scales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100049732|title=A Dictionary of Physics|last=|first=|date=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=''Landau Ghost'' entry|year=|isbn=9780199233991|editor-last=Daintith|editor-first=John|edition=6th|location=Oxford|pages=|oclc=244417456}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==B==
* '''binary semaphore''': See ''semaphore''.
* {{Anchor|Booting|booting}} '''[[booting]]''': In [[computing]], '''booting''' (also known as '''booting up''') is the initial set of operations that a [[computer system]] performs after electrical power to the CPU is switched on or when the computer is reset. On modern general purpose computers, this can take tens of seconds and typically involves performing a [[power-on self-test]], locating and initializing peripheral devices, and then finding, loading and starting the [[operating system]].

==C==
* {{Anchor|Cache|Cache|cache}} '''[[Cache (computing)|cache]]''': In [[computer science]], a '''cache''' is a component that transparently stores data so that future requests for that data can be served faster. The data that is stored within a cache might be values that have been computed earlier or duplicates of original values that are stored elsewhere.

Doeppner (2011) mentions them (p.&amp;nbsp;3), but only to prove that operating systems "are not a solved problem" and that even if the day of the dedicated PC is waning, cloud computing has created an entirely new opportunity for o/s development ala sharing, networks, memory, parallelism, etc. Gagne (2012) adds that in addition to numerous traditional o/s's at cloud warehouses, [[Virtual machine]] o/s (VMMs), [[Eucalyptus (software)|Eucalyptus]], Vware, [[vCloud]] Director and others are being developed specifically for cloud management with numerous traditional o/s features (security, threads, file and memory management, guis, etc.) (p.&amp;nbsp;42). Microsoft's investment in cloud aspects of o/s tend to support that argument.&lt;ref&gt;[https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg521165.aspx/ List of Microsoft Cloud Investment Links on Microsoft.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==D==
* {{Anchor|Daemon|daemon}} '''[[Daemon (computing)|daemon]]''': Operating systems often start daemons at [[booting|boot]] time and serve the function of responding to network requests, hardware activity, or other programs by performing some task. Daemons can also configure hardware (like [[udev]]d on some [[Linux]] systems), run scheduled tasks (like [[cron]]), and perform a variety of other tasks.

==K==
* {{Anchor|Kernel|kernel}} '''[[Kernel (computing)|kernel]]''': In [[computing]], the '''kernel''' is a [[computer program]] that manages [[input/output]] requests from [[software]] and translates them into  [[data processing]] instructions for the [[central processing unit]] and other [[electronic component]]s of a [[computer]]. The kernel is a fundamental part of a modern computer's [[operating system]].

==L==
* '''[[Lock (computer science)|lock]]''': In [[computer science]], a '''lock''' or '''mutex''' (from [[mutual exclusion]]) is a [[Synchronization (computer science)|synchronization]] mechanism for enforcing limits on access to a resource in an environment where there are many [[thread (computer science)|threads of execution]]. A lock is designed to enforce a [[mutual exclusion]] [[concurrency control]] policy.

==M==
* '''[[mutual exclusion]]''': Mutual exclusion is to allow only one process at a time to access the same critical section (a part of code which accesses the critical resource). This helps prevent [[Race condition|race conditions]].

* {{Anchor|Semaphore|semaphore}} '''[[Semaphore (computing)|semaphore]]''': In computer science, particularly in operating systems, a '''semaphore''' is a [[variable (programming)|variable]] or [[abstract data type]] that is used for controlling access, by multiple [[process (computing)|processes]], to a common resource in a [[Parallel computing|parallel programming]] or a [[multi user]] environment.

==T==
* {{Anchor|Thread|thread}} '''[[Thread (computing)|thread]]''': In [[computer science]], a '''thread''' of execution is the smallest sequence of  programmed instructions that can be managed independently by an [[operating system]] [[scheduling (computing)|scheduler]]. The scheduler itself is a [[light-weight process]]. The implementation of threads and [[process (computing)|process]]es differs from one [[operating system]] to another, but in most cases, a thread is contained inside a process.

where &lt;math&gt;L^2(0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt; is the set of [[square-integrable]] functions on the positive real number line, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}^+&lt;/math&gt; is the right half of the complex plane.  It is more; it is an [[isomorphism]], in that it is invertible, and it [[isometry|isometric]], in that it satisfies

:&lt;math&gt;\|\mathcal{L}f\|_{H^2} = \sqrt{2\pi} \|f\|_{L^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

The Laplace transform is "half" of a Fourier transform; from the decomposition

:&lt;math&gt;L^2(\mathbb{R})=L^2(-\infty,0) \oplus L^2(0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt;

one then obtains an [[orthogonal decomposition]] of &lt;math&gt;L^2(\mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt; into two Hardy spaces

:&lt;math&gt;L^2(\mathbb{R})=
H^2\left(\mathbb{C}^-\right) \oplus
H^2\left(\mathbb{C}^+\right).&lt;/math&gt;

This is essentially the [[Paley-Wiener theorem]].

'''Human interactions with fungi''' include both beneficial uses, whether practical or symbolic, and harmful interactions such as when fungi damage crops, timber, or food.

[[Yeasts]] have been used since ancient times to leaven bread and to [[fermentation|ferment]] [[beer]] and [[wine]]. More recently, [[mould]] fungi have been exploited to create a wide range of industrial products, including [[enzyme]]s and [[drug]]s. [[Drug|Medicines]] based on fungi include [[antibiotic]]s, [[immunosuppressant]]s, [[statin]]s and many [[anti-cancer drugs]]. The yeast species ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' is an important [[model organism]] in [[cell biology]]. The fruiting bodies of some larger fungi are collected as edible [[mushroom]]s, including delicacies like the [[chanterelle]], [[cep (mushroom)|cep]], and [[truffle]], while [[edible mushroom|a few species are cultivated]]. [[Mould]] fungi provide the [[umami|meaty (umami)]] flavour of fermented [[soybean]] products such as [[tempeh]], [[miso]] and [[soy sauce]], and contribute flavour and colour to [[blue cheese]]s including [[Roquefort]] and [[Stilton]]. Moulds also yield [[vegetarian]] [[meat substitute]]s like [[Quorn]]. Some fungi, especially the [[fly agaric]] and [[psilocybin mushroom]]s are used for the [[psychoactive drug]]s that they contain; these in particular are the focus of academic study in the field of [[ethnomycology]]. Fungi have appeared, too, from time to time, in literature and art.

Fungi create harm by [[food spoilage|spoiling food]], [[wood-decay fungi|destroying timber]], and by causing [[plant pathology#Fungi|diseases of crops]], [[Pathogenic fungus|livestock, and humans]]. Fungi, mainly moulds like ''[[Penicillium]]'' and ''[[Aspergillus]]'', spoil many stored foods. Fungi cause the majority of plant diseases, which in turn cause serious economic losses. Sometimes, as in the [[Great Irish Famine]] of 1845–1849, fungal diseases of plants, in this case potato blight caused by ''[[Phytophthora]]'', result in large-scale human suffering. Fungi are similarly the main cause of economic losses of timber in buildings. Finally, fungi cause many diseases of humans and livestock; [[Aspergillosis]] kills some 600,000 people a year, mainly however those with already weakened [[immune system]]s.

==Context==

[[Culture]] consists of the [[social behaviour]] and [[Norm (social)|norms]] found in [[human]] [[society|societies]] and transmitted through social [[learning]]. [[Cultural universals]] in all human societies include expressive forms like [[art]], [[music]], [[dance]], [[ritual]], [[religion]], and [[technology|technologies]] like [[tool|tool usage]], [[cooking]], [[shelter (building)|shelter]], and [[clothing]]. The concept of [[material culture]] covers physical expressions such as technology, architecture and art, whereas immaterial culture includes principles of [[social organization]], [[mythology]], [[philosophy]], [[literature]], and [[science]].&lt;ref name=MacionisGerber2011&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/sociology/oclc/652430995 |title=Sociology |last=Macionis |first=John J. |last2=Gerber |first2=Linda Marie |date=2011 |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |isbn=978-0137001613 |page=53 |accessdate=29 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170818045455/https://www.worldcat.org/title/sociology/oclc/652430995 |archivedate=18 August 2017 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This article describes the roles played by fungi in human culture.

[[File:Tempeh tempe.jpg|thumb|Mould fungi produce foods like [[tempeh]], savoury Javanese fermented soybean cakes.]]

Mould fungi are the source of the [[umami|meaty (umami)]] flavour of the [[soybean]] products [[tempeh]], [[miso]] and [[soy sauce]].

{{main|Medicinal fungi}}

[[Medicinal fungi|Fungi are the sources]] of many types of medicinal [[drug]] including [[antibiotic]]s, [[immunosuppressant]]s, and [[statin]]s. Major classes of antibiotics, the [[penicillin]]s and the [[cephalosporin]]s, are derived from substances produced by fungi. So also are the immunosuppressant [[macrolide]]s, the [[cyclosporins]].&lt;ref name="Kew"&gt;{{cite web |title=The importance of fungi |url=http://www.kew.org/science-conservation/plants-fungi/fungi/importance |publisher=Royal Botanic Gardens Kew |accessdate=4 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[cholesterol]]-lowering drugs, the statins, were initially produced by fungi including ''[[Penicillium]]''. The first commercial statin, [[lovastatin]], was fermented by the [[mould]] ''[[Aspergillus terreus]]''.&lt;ref name=Tolbert&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Tolbert | first1=Jonathan A. | year=2003 | title=Lovastatin and beyond: the history of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors | url=http://www.nature.com/nrd/journal/v2/n7/full/nrd1112.html | journal=Nature Reviews Drug Discovery | volume=2 | issue=7| pages=517–526 | doi=10.1038/nrd1112 | pmid=12815379 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid23118499"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid=23118499 | doi=10.1155/2012/196264 | pmc=3478940 | year=2012 | last1=Jahromi | first1=M.

===In folk medicine===
{{further|Folk medicine}}

Many fungi have been used as [[folk medicine]]s around the world, including in [[Europe]] and in [[India]] where traditions are well documented. Some have been found to have useful active ingredients, though these do not always correspond with traditional uses of the fungi concerned. Ergot and various cereal smuts, such as ''[[Ustilago tritici]]'' (wheat grain smut) were used for disorders of pregnancy. Yeasts, made into a boiled paste with wheat flour, were used in India to treat fevers and dysentery. Wounds were treated in Europe with moulds, using for example a slice of mouldy bread or mouldy wheat straw, with active ingredients [[patulin]] and other penicillin-like compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vaidya |first1=J.

Fungi have appeared from time to time in literature, both for children and for adults. In [[Lewis Carroll]]'s 1865 ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'', Alice grows larger if she eats one side of the mushroom, and shrinks if she eats from the other side.

===Food spoilage===

{{further|Food spoilage}}

Fungi, especially moulds but also yeasts, are important agents of [[food spoilage]]. 
''[[Penicillium]]'' moulds cause soft rot such as of [[apple]]s, while ''[[Aspergillus]]'' moulds create patches on the surface of old bread, yoghurt and many other foods. Yeasts spoil sugary foods such as [[plums]] and jams, fermenting the sugars to alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pitt |first1=John I. |last2=Hocking |first2=Ailsa D.|title=Fungi and Food Spoilage |date=2009 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-387-92206-5 |pages=169–273 (Penicillium); 275–337 (Aspergillus); 357–382 (Yeasts)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientific understanding of spoilage began in the 19th century with works such as [[Louis Pasteur]]'s 1879 ''Studies on Fermentation'', which investigated the spoilage of beer.&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Pasteur|Pasteur, Louis]] (1879) ''Studies on fermentation: The diseases of beer, their causes, and the means of preventing them''.

Honey fungus is a serious horticultural pest, as it can spread from tree to tree by long strap-shaped [[rhizomorph]]s in the soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Honey fungus |url=https://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/profile?PID=180 |publisher=Royal Horticultural Society |accessdate=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15961">The '''Investment theory of party competition''' is a [[political theory]] developed by [[Thomas Ferguson (academic)|Thomas Ferguson]], Emeritus Professor of Political Science at the [[University of Massachusetts Boston]]. The theory focuses on how business elites, not voters, play the leading part in political systems. The theory offers an alternative to the conventional, voter-focused, [[realignment election#Realignment theory|Voter Realignment theory]] and [[Median voter theorem]], which has been criticized by Ferguson and others.

==History==
The ''Investment Theory of Party Competition'' was first outlined by Thomas Ferguson in his 1983 paper ''Party Realignment and American Industrial Structure: The Investment Theory of Political Parties in Historical Perspective''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ferguson|first1=Thomas|title=Party Realignment and American Industrial Structure: The Investment Theory of Political Parties in Historical Perspective|journal=Research in Political Economy|date=1983|volume=6|pages=1–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory is detailed most extensively in Ferguson's 1995 book ''Golden Rule: The Investment Theory of Party Competition and the Logic of Money-driven Political Systems'', in which his earlier paper is republished as a chapter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ferguson|first1=Thomas|title=Golden Rule : The Investment Theory of Party Competition and the Logic of Money-Driven Political Systems|date=1995|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0226243176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Ferguson frames his theory as being both inspired by and an alternative to the traditional median voter theories of democracy such as that posited by [[Anthony Downs]] in his 1957 work ''An Economic Theory of Democracy''.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson 1995 p.24.&lt;/ref&gt; Quoting Downs, Ferguson accepts that 'the expense of political awareness is so great that no citizen can afford to bear it in every policy area, even if by doing so he could discover places where his intervention would reap large profits'. While Downs largely overlooked the implications of this insight, Ferguson makes it the foundation of the ''Investment Theory of Party Competition'', recognizing that if voters cannot bear the cost of becoming informed about public affairs they have little hope of successfully supervising government.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson 1995 p.24.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{rquote|right|The real market for political parties is defined by major investors, who generally have good and clear reason for investing to control the [[Sovereign state|state]]....Blocs of major investors define the core of political parties and are responsible for most of the [[Political campaign|signals the party sends to the electorate]].|[[Thomas Ferguson (academic)|Thomas Ferguson]]&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson 1995 p.206&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The central claim of the ''Investment Theory'' is that since ordinary citizens cannot afford to acquire the information required to invest in political parties, the political system will be dominated by those who can. As a result, the investment theory holds that rather than being seen as simple vote maximizers, political parties are best analyzed as blocs of investors who coalesce to advance candidates representing their interests.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson 1995 p.27&lt;/ref&gt;

===The role of political parties===
Contrary to the median voter theorem where political parties have traditionally been seen as vote maximizers who will seek out the position of the 'median voter' on any particular issue, the ''Investment Theory'' holds the real area of competition for political parties is major investors who have an interest in investing to control the state.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson 1995 p.22&lt;/ref&gt;

This is because, in situations where money is important, political parties must take positions that enable them to attract the investment required to run successful campaigns. This is the case even if those positions are not supported by the majority of the population, since it is futile for a party to adopt even a popular position if it cannot afford the expense of communicating that position to the electorate in an election campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson 1995 p.382&lt;/ref&gt; In fact the ''Investment theory'' predicts that in many cases political parties are more likely to try and change the position of the public to match those of its investors than vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson 1995 p.36&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead political parties will try to assemble the votes they need through appeals to the electorate on issues that do not conflict with the interests of their investors. Vigorous debate may take place on issues where an opposing bloc of investors is able to mobilize and advertise their position. A further consequence of this theory is that in policy areas where large investors agree on policy, no party competition will take place. This is the case regardless of the views of the general population, unless ordinary citizens are able to become major investors in their own right through expenditure of time and income.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson 1995 p.28&lt;/ref&gt;

===The role of ordinary voters===
The ''Investment Theory of Party Competition'' does not deny the possibility that masses of voters can become major investors in an electoral system, and accepts that in cases where this does happen the effect may resemble classical voter competition models. For this to happen, however, generally requires channels that facilitate mass deliberation and expression, typically 'secondary' organizations capable of spreading the cost of acquiring information and concentrating contributions from many individuals to act politically. Such conditions may enable high information flows to the general population and make political debate and action a part of everyday life. Where these conditions do not exist, however, it is unlikely that ordinary citizens will be able to afford the costs required to control policy.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson 1995 p.29.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{rquote|right|The electorate is not too stupid or too tired to control the political system. It is merely too poor.|[[Thomas Ferguson (academic)|Thomas Ferguson]]&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson 1995 p.384&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A consequence of the ''Investment Theory'' is that it is not necessary to assume that the voting population is stupid or malevolent to explain why it will often vote for parties whose policies are opposed to their own interests.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson 1995 p.26.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Ferguson suggests, the general population is far from ignorant or uninterested in the outcome of elections, and will often make considerable effort to understand the issues under discussion. Voting decisions ultimately, however, must be made on the basis of the information that is available, and if acquiring information is expensive in terms of time or money then most likely those decisions will be made on the basis of information subsidized by wealthy investors.

===The role of wealthy investors===
According to Ferguson, who credits the insight to Downs, one of the reasons that wealthy investors are able to influence politics to their advantage is that much of the politically relevant information that is so expensive for ordinary citizens to acquire comes quite naturally to businesses in the course of their daily operations. An example might include international banks whose business contacts constitute 'a first-rate foreign policy network'.

Similarly, economies of scale give businesses an advantage over ordinary voters. For example, large investors will routinely consult with lawyers, public relations advisors, lobbyists, and political consultants before acting. The cost of this advice is prohibitively expensive for most citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson 1995 p.29-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since investors cannot guarantee the outcome of an election or know exactly what policies a candidate will implement once in power, they must estimate the chances their investment will be successful. In some cases, this may lead to investors supporting more than one candidate, perhaps in more than one party. In other cases, it is expected that an investor will judge that one party will never accept its desired policies and so will become the 'core' of one party. Ferguson cites the support of labor-intensive industries such as textiles and steel supporting the Republican party after the New Deal as an example, owing to their labor policy.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson 1995 p.43&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the ''Investment Theory'' recognizes the importance of financial contributions to political parties, Ferguson notes that direct cash contributions 'are probably not the most important way in which truly top business figures ("major investors") act politically'. Investors are also likely to act as sources of contacts, fundraisers, and as sources of legitimation for candidates, particularly through endorsements in the media.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson 1995 p.41&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the theory does not predict that elections will be won by the party that is able to spend the most money. Instead, it suggests that while parties will likely need to attract significant resources in order to be able to mount a successful campaign, they do not necessarily need to attract the ''most'' money.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson 1995 p.384&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison to other election theories===

The ''Investment Theory'' makes a number of novel predictions compared to other theories of party systems.

==Case Studies==

===The New Deal===
Ferguson uses the Investment Theory as the basis of an analysis of the [[New Deal]] in his 1984 paper "From Normalcy to New Deal: Industrial structure, Party Competition, and American Public Policy in the Great Depression", in which he argues that the New Deal policies became possible due to the changing nature of the American economy and the new coalitions of political investors that emerged as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ferguson|first1=Thomas|title=From Normalcy to New Deal: Industrial structure, Party Competition, and American Public Policy in the Great Depression|journal=International Organization|date=1984|volume=38|issue=1|pages=41–94|url=http://vi.uh.edu/pages/buzzmat/ferguson.pdf|accessdate=15 July 2016|doi=10.1017/s0020818300004276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ferguson argues that in the early years of the twentieth century American politics was dominated by a coalition of labor-intensive industries including steel, coal, and textiles, who opposed labor, and protectionist industries who supported the Republican Party. These industries were also joined by finance, who largely shared the support for trade tariffs and aggressive foreign policy. This coalition first began to split after the first world war as successful capital-intensive firms such as [[Standard Oil]] and [[General Electric]] began to emerge for whom labor issues were less pressing and who favored lower tariffs to stimulate world trade and open new markets. International banks also moved away from protectionist policies, as post-war recovery required European nations to export to America and required US banks to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson 1984 p.63-64&lt;/ref&gt;

These firms went on to form the coalition that backed [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s New Deal policies, as their dominant position in the world economy made them the primary beneficiaries of the New Deal's free trade policies. While these new multinational corporations were better able to tolerate the pro-labour policies of the New Deal, they did not necessarily support it. Instead, Ferguson credits the rise of independent industrial unionism as the result of masses of American voters for the first time in US history successfully pooling their resources to become major investors in their own right.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson 1995 p.82&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaign Finance Reform==
Although the 'Investment Theory' is largely concerned with financial donations to political parties, Ferguson argues that the theory implies reform must look beyond campaign finance alone. While acknowledging a need for reform of campaign finance, 'if only to prevent more and more of society's resources going down a black hole', Ferguson suggests, that no matter how diligent the regulators are, wealthy investors will doubtless find new ways to corrupt the political system.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson 1995 p.352.&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead, since the problem of money influencing politics stems from the cost of information, Ferguson argues the solution might come from finding ways for regular citizens to share these costs.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson 1995 p.353.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since it is inefficient for individuals or even groups of individuals to cope with this problem on an individual basis, Ferguson proposes that the cost must be subsidized by the state.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson 1995 p.354.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the United States (and other nations) already subsidize some of these costs, for example in providing public finance to political parties, franking mail or providing staff to politicians, this rarely takes place on a scale that actually does the public any good. Instead, this funding merely subsidizes parties that the rich control, with the effect that public money merely leverages the contributions of major investors.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson 1995 p.352.&lt;/ref&gt; The solution, then, is to apply the 'Golden Rule' to ordinary citizens by providing enough public support to allow ordinary members of the public to run for office and have a reasonable chance of winning. This would not only allow ordinary citizens and (seemingly) heterodox opinions to be heard but would also have the effect of limiting the harm that private financing can have.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson 1995 p.354-355.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Lewis and Clark Trail–Travois Road''' is a {{convert|5|acre|adj=on}} historic site located {{convert|5|mi|km}} east of [[Pomeroy, Washington]], on [[U.S. Route 12 in Washington|U.S. Route 12]] (US&amp;nbsp;12). It is a surviving stretch of Indian [[travois]] trail followed by [[Lewis and Clark Expedition|Lewis and Clark]] in their 1805–06 expedition and mentioned in their writings. It was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1974.&lt;ref name=nris/&gt;&lt;ref name=nrhpdoc&gt;{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=74001952}} |title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: Lewis and Clark Trail–Travois Road |author= |date= |publisher=National Park Service}} and {{NRHP url|id=74001952|title=accompanying photos|photos=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site is significant for the 1805–06 event, for including "a trail that was very important in aboriginal times", and for its information potential.&lt;ref name=nrhpdoc/&gt; It seems to have been described by [[Meriwether Lewis]], who wrote on May 3, 1806: "...we Continued Still up the Creek bottoms ... to the place at which the roade leaves the [Pataha] Creek and assends the hill up to the high plains: here we Encamped in a Small grove of Cotton trees...".&lt;ref name=expedition&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/lewisandclark/lew.htm |title=Lewis &amp; Clark Trail–Travois Road |work=Lewis and Clark Expedition: A National Register of Historic Places Travel Itinerary |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=October 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Travois were used by [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] to transport possessions by means of two long poles slung with a hammock trailing behind a horse or dog. The deep, parallel tracks caused by the dragging poles are still visible today in a quarter-mile (0.4&amp;nbsp;km) section of the original trail, sometimes called the [[Nez Perce Trail]], followed by the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] and preserved at this site.&lt;ref name=expedition/&gt;

'''Lionel Greenstreet''' (1889–1979) was the [[Chief mate|first officer]] of the ''[[Endurance (1912 ship)|Endurance]]'' and a member of the [[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition]] of 1914–1917, for which he was awarded the [[Polar Medal]].  When he died on 13 January 1979, he was the last survivor of the [[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition#Expedition|Weddell Sea party]] within the expedition.

==Biography==
Greenstreet was born into a family of officers in the [[merchant navy]] of the British Empire; his father Herbert Edward Greenstreet had been granted captain's papers by the [[New Zealand Shipping Company]]. At age 15, Greenstreet became a [[sea cadet]], never returning to school. He gained his [[Master mariner|Master's certificate]] in 1911. As a young ship's officer, he wrote to the Captain of the ''Endurance'', [[Frank Worsley]] in 1914, asking to be considered for a berth. His request arrived just as the ship's named First Officer had thrown up his papers to accept service in [[World War I]], which had just broken out. Greenstreet was told to report to the ''Endurance'' in [[Plymouth Sound]] for an interview; and upon arrival, after brief inspection by Worsley he was abruptly told that the position of First Officer was his and that he had twenty-four hours to prepare for the departure of the vessel to the [[Southern Ocean]]. The fledgling ship's officer recalled that after considerable effort he had settled his affairs and reported aboard the ship, which then sailed 30 minutes after his arrival.&lt;ref name="Coolantarctica"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coolantarctica.com/Antarctica%20fact%20file/History/biography/greenstreet_lionel.htm |title=Lionel Greenstreet (1889–1979) – Biographical notes |work=coolantactica.com |accessdate=19 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The expedition's overall commander was the explorer [[Ernest Shackleton]], and the goal of the ''Endurance'' was [[Vahsel Bay]] on the coast of Antarctica, from which Shackleton and the shore party hoped to cross the icy continent by [[dogsled]]; but on 18 January 1915, a few miles short of this destination, the ship was beset by ice and frozen into heavy pack from which she would not emerge.&lt;ref&gt;Shackleton, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Greenstreet's duties changed with the new status of his ship; he kept deck watches in an attempt to find a lead of open water through which the ship could extricate itself,&lt;ref&gt;Shackleton, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; and joined a crew assigned to work below-decks in a futile attempt to stop the leaks that the ice was beginning to punch through the ship's hull.&lt;ref&gt;Shackleton, pp. 79–80.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the work of Greenstreet and his seamen and fellow ship's officers, Shackleton was forced to issue the order to abandon ship on 27 October.&lt;ref&gt;Shackleton, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; The expedition's 28 members and ship's company had to camp together as castaways on the frozen surface of the [[Weddell Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;Shackleton, pp. 83–84.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Castaway===
After the ''Endurance'' was abandoned, Greenstreet's duties again changed. He was given brief command of a team of [[sled dog]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Shackleton, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; and helped to hunt for fresh meat to supplement the castaways' inadequate supply of food. Shackleton later recalled with gratitude how Greenstreet and his hunting partner, [[Alexander Macklin]], had killed and brought in a [[Weddell seal]] weighing 800 pounds.&lt;ref&gt;Shackleton, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

At a slightly later stage of their self-rescue, after the icy campsite of the men of the ''Endurance'' had drifted northward into warmer water, the change in water temperature caused their refuge to melt and on 9 April 1916 they were forced to climb aboard the open boats that they had salvaged from their former vessel.&lt;ref&gt;Shackleton, pp. 133–34.&lt;/ref&gt; Shackleton and his men had salvaged three lifeboats, and Greenstreet was the fourth-ranking member of the expedition. He accompanied his captain, Frank Worsley, in the ''[[Dudley Docker]]'' during the eight-day ordeal that marked the progress of the open-boat flotilla to a new and more secure campsite on [[Elephant Island]] in the archipelago of the [[South Shetlands]].&lt;ref&gt;Worsley, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Greenstreet, although characterised by Worsley as "a fine seaman",&lt;ref&gt;Worsley, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; was not chosen to accompany the six-man party that set out from Elephant Island to [[South Georgia Island]]. Instead the former first officer was detailed to a two-man party, working with [[William Lincoln Bakewell|William Bakewell]], to alter bits and scraps of salvaged ship's [[canvas]] into a jury-rigged canvas [[deck (ship)|deck]] to enable the sole remaining sail-worthy lifeboat of the ship's company, the ''[[Voyage of the James Caird|James Caird]]'', to navigate in the open sea. Worsley, whose life would depend upon the success of this work,&lt;ref&gt;Worsley, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; describes it as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Frozen like a board and caked with ice, the canvas was sewn, in painful circumstances, by two cheery optimists – Greenstreet, Chief Officer of the ''Endurance'', and Bakewell, a Canadian [sic] AB. The only way they could do it was by holding the frozen canvas in the blubber fire till it thawed, often burning their fingers, while the oily smoke got in their eyes and noses, half-blinding and choking them. Then they sewed, often getting frostbitten and having to use great care that the difficult sewing with cold, brittle sail needles did not break all of our now scanty supply. All the time, while repeating the unpleasant task of thawing a length, and sewing it, 'Horace' [Greenstreet] was irrepressibly cracking his sailor jokes and Bakewell replying.&lt;ref&gt;Worsley, pp. 97–98.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  
The sails hoisted, Shackleton, Worsley and the ''James Caird'' set out into the Southern Ocean. Greenstreet and his 21 fellow castaways remained encamped on Elephant Island, and were rescued on 30 August 1916.

===Later life and character===
[[File:Lieut Lionel Greenstreet, 27 Jan 1917 (16939526984).jpg|thumb|Lt Greenstreet, photographed by [[David Knights-Whittome]] in 1917]]
After the end of the expedition and with World War I continuing, Greenstreet was commissioned as a [[second lieutenant]] in the Inland Water Transport arm of the [[Royal Engineers]] in 1917,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=29965|supp=y| date=27 February 1917|page=2102}}&lt;/ref&gt; serving in supply barges on the [[Tigris]] in British-occupied [[Mesopotamia]].&lt;ref&gt;Shackleton, p. 375.&lt;/ref&gt; He married Millie Baddeley Muir in 1917. After the  war, Greenstreet chose shore life, working in [[marine insurance]].

He saw active service in [[World War II]] as an officer in the [[Royal Naval Reserve]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=29965| date=6 August 1940|page=4808}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greenstreet left command of [[Admiralty tug]] ''Freebooter'' in January 1942 to become [[rescue tug]] equipment officer in charge of the US shipbuilding programme of rescue tugs for the Admiralty under [[lend-lease]].

After the war, he resumed insurance work prior to retirement.&lt;ref name="Coolantarctica"/&gt; His wife Millie died in 1955 and he married Audrey Day.

Worsley, who had chosen Greenstreet on very short notice to join the fateful expedition, repeatedly paid tribute to him in his memoirs. During the first open-boat journey, "Greenstreet was splendid, never losing hope and always ready to crack some appalling sailor-joke."&lt;ref&gt;Worsley, pp. 62–63.&lt;/ref&gt; On Elephant Island Worsley's last sight of Greenstreet prior to the Southern Ocean trip was his former First Officer, "cheerfully profane as ever", helping to bag stones to be loaded onto the ''James Caird'' as ballast.&lt;ref&gt;Worsley, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Lions' Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition, with Source Code''''' by [[John Lions]] (1976) contains [[source code]] of the [[Version 6 Unix|6th Edition]] [[Unix]] [[kernel (computing)|kernel]] plus a commentary. It is commonly referred to as the '''Lions book'''. Despite its age, it is still considered an excellent commentary on simple but high quality code.

For many years, the Lions book was the ''only'' Unix kernel documentation available outside [[Bell Labs]]. Although the license of 6th Edition allowed classroom use of the source code, the license of [[Version 7 Unix|7th Edition]] specifically excluded such use, so the book spread through illegal copy machine reproductions (a kind of [[samizdat]]). It was commonly held to be the most copied book in [[computer science]].

The book was reprinted in 1996 by Peer-To-Peer Communications.

==Synopsis==
[[File:Lions Commentary Unix.jpeg|thumb|Lions's original books with source code and commentary]]

''Unix Operating System Source Code Level Six'' is the kernel source code, lightly edited by Lions to better separate the functionality&amp;nbsp;— system initialization and process management, interrupts and system calls, basic I/O, file systems and pipes and character devices. All procedures and symbols are listed alphabetically with a cross reference.

The code as presented will run on a [[PDP-11]]/40 with RK-05 disk drive, LP-11 line printer interface, PCL-11 paper tape writer and KL-11 terminal interface, or a suitable PDP-11 emulator, such as [[SIMH]].

''A Commentary on the Unix Operating System'' starts with notes on Unix and other useful documentation (the Unix manual pages, [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] hardware manuals and so on), a section on the architecture of the PDP-11 and a chapter on how to read [[C (programming language)|C]] programs. The source commentary follows, divided into the same sections as the code. The book ends with suggested exercises for the student.

As Lions explains, this commentary supplements the comments in the source. It is possible to understand the code without the extra commentary, and the reader is advised to do so and only read the notes as needed. The commentary also remarks on how the code might be improved.

==History==
[[File:Johnlions.jpg|thumb|[[John Lions]] with his students in 1980]]
[[File:Brian Kernighan in 2012 at Bell Labs 2.jpg|thumb|[[Brian Kernighan]] holding a copy of Lions's ''Commentary'']]

The source code and commentary were originally produced in May 1976 as a set of lecture notes for Lions's [[computer science]] courses (6.602B and 6.657G) at the [http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au University of New South Wales Department of Computer Science].

''UNIX News'' March 1977 announced the availability of the book to Unix licensees. Lions had trouble keeping up with its popularity, and by 1978 it was available only from Bell Labs.

When AT&amp;T announced [[Version 7 Unix|Unix Version 7]] at [[USENIX]] in June 1979, the academic/research license no longer automatically permitted classroom use. Thus, licensees were no longer able to use the Lions notes for classes on [[operating system]]s.

However, thousands of computer science students around the world spread photocopies. As they could not study it legally in class, they would sometimes meet after hours to discuss the book. Many pioneers of Unix and [[open-source software|open source]] had a treasured multiple-generation photocopy.&lt;ref name=jargon&gt;[http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/L/Lions-Book.html Lions Book] ([[Jargon File]], references {{ISBN|1-57398-013-7}})&lt;/ref&gt;

Other follow-on effects of the license change included [[Andrew S. Tanenbaum]] creating [[Minix]]. As Tanenbaum wrote in ''Operating Systems'' (1987):

{{quote|When AT&amp;T released Version 7, it began to realize that UNIX was a valuable commercial product, so it issued Version 7 with a license that prohibited the source code from being studied in courses, in order to avoid endangering its status as a trade secret. Many universities complied by simply dropping the study of UNIX, and teaching only theory.}}

Various Unix people, particularly [[Peter H. Salus]], [[Dennis Ritchie]] and Berny Goodheart, lobbied Unix's various owners (AT&amp;T, [[Novell]], the [[Santa Cruz Operation]]) for many years to allow the book to be published officially. In 1996, the Santa Cruz Operation finally authorised the release of the twenty-year-old 6th Edition source code (along with the source code of other versions of "[[Ancient UNIX]]"), and the full code plus the 1977 version of the commentary was published by Peer-To-Peer Communications ({{ISBN|1-57398-013-7}}). The reissue includes commentary from Michael Tilson (SCO), Peter Salus, Dennis Ritchie, [[Ken Thompson (computer programmer)|Ken Thompson]], Peter Collinson, Greg Rose, [[Mike O'Dell]], Berny Goodheart and [[Peter Reintjes]].

=="You are not expected to understand this"==

The infamous program comment "You are not expected to understand this" occurs on line 2238 of the source code (''Lions' Commentary'', p.&amp;nbsp;22) at the end of a comment explaining the process exchange mechanism. It refers to line 325 of the file slp.c.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo/blob/Research-V6/usr/sys/ken/slp.c#L325|title= unix-history-repo/usr/sys/ken/slp.c
|author=Ken Thompson|accessdate=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The source code reads:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orkinos.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/~kosar/odd.html|title=Odd Comments and Strange Doings in Unix|author=Dennis Ritchie|accessdate=2015-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
        /*
         * If the new process paused because it was
         * swapped out, set the stack level to the last call
         * to savu(u_ssav).  This means that the return
         * which is executed immediately after the call to aretu
         * actually returns from the last routine which did
         * the savu.
         *
         * You are not expected to understand this.
         */
        if(rp-&gt;p_flag&amp;SSWAP) {
                rp-&gt;p_flag =&amp; ~SSWAP;
                aretu(u.u_ssav);
        }
&lt;/source&gt;

A major reason why this piece of code was hard to understand was that it depended on a quirk of the way the C-compiler for the [[PDP-11]] saved registers in procedure calls. This code failed when ported to other machines and had to be redesigned in [[Version 7 Unix]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=S. C. |last=Johnson |first2= D. M.|last2= Ritchie|title=Portability of C Programs and the UNIX System|journal= UNIX System Readings and Applications, Bell System Technical Journal special issue on UNIX|volume= 57|issue= 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dennis Ritchie]] later explained the meaning of this remark:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orkinos.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/~kosar/odd.html|title=Odd Comments and Strange Doings in Unix|author=Dennis Ritchie|accessdate=2015-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Intel]] has historically named [[integrated circuit]] (IC) development projects after geographical names of towns, rivers or mountains near the location of the Intel facility responsible for the IC. Many of these are in the American West, particularly in [[Oregon]] (where most of Intel's [[CPU]] projects are designed; see [[Project code name#Famous code names|famous codenames]]). As Intel's development activities have expanded, this nomenclature has expanded to [[Israel]] and [[India]], and some older codenames refer to [[celestial bodies]].

The following table lists known '''Intel codenames''' along with a brief explanation of their meaning and their likely namesake, and the year of their earliest known public appearance. Most processors after a certain date were named after cities that could be found on the map of the United States. This was done for trademark considerations. Banias was the last of the non-US city names. Gesher was renamed to Sandy Bridge to comply with the new rule. Dothan was a city both in Israel and in Alabama.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7573">There are at least '''2340 named [[lake]]s and [[reservoir]]s in [[Arkansas]]'''. The following list contains lists of lakes and reservoirs in Arkansas by county.

A '''lake''' is a [[terrain feature]] (or [[physical feature]]), a body of [[liquid]] on the surface of a world that is localized to the bottom of [[Depression (geology)|basin]] (another type of landform or terrain feature; that is not global). Another definition is a body of fresh or salt water of considerable size that is surrounded by land. On Earth a body of water is considered a lake when it is inland, not part of the [[World Ocean|ocean]], is larger and deeper than a [[pond]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/328083/lake |author= Britannica online |accessdate= 2012-03-21 |title=Lake (physical feature) |quote=[a Lake is] any relatively large body of slowly moving or standing water that occupies an inland basin of appreciable size. Definitions that precisely distinguish lakes, ponds, swamps, and even rivers and other bodies of nonoceanic water are not well established. It may be said, however, that rivers and streams are relatively fast moving; marshes and swamps contain relatively large quantities of grasses, trees or shrubs; and ponds are relatively small in comparison to lakes. Geologically defined, lakes are temporary bodies of water.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dictionary.com definition |accessdate=2012-03-12 |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/lake |quote= a body of fresh or salt water of considerable size, surrounded by land.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A '''reservoir''' (etymology from [[French language|French]] ''réservoir'' a "storehouse &lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web |url= http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=reservoir |publisher= Online Etymology Dictionary |title= Reservoir }}&lt;/ref&gt;) is an artificial [[lake]] used to store [[water]]. Reservoirs may be created in river valleys by the construction of a [[dam]] or may be built by excavation in the ground or by conventional construction techniques such a brickwork or cast concrete.

There are more than 3,000 named [[lake]]s, [[reservoir]]s, and [[dry lake]]s in the [[U.S.]] state of [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://geonames.usgs.gov/pls/gnispublic|title=GNIS Feature Search|accessdate=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Largest lakes==
[[File:Lake Tahoe NV.jpg|Lake Tahoe is the second deepest lake in the United States|thumb]]
In terms of area covered, the largest lake in California is the [[Salton Sea]], a lake formed in 1905 which is now saline.  It occupies {{Convert|376|sqmi}} in the southeast corner of the state, but because it is shallow it only holds about {{Convert|7500000|acre.ft|dam3}} of water.&lt;ref name=Salton /&gt; [[Tulare Lake]] in the [[San Joaquin Valley]] was larger, at approximately 690 square miles (1,780&amp;nbsp;km), until it was drained during the later years of the nineteenth century.

In terms of volume, the largest lake on the list is [[Lake Tahoe]], located on the California&amp;ndash;Nevada border.  It holds roughly {{Convert|36|cumi}} of water.  It is also the largest freshwater lake by area, at {{Convert|191|mi2|abbr=on}}, and the deepest lake, with a maximum depth of {{Convert|1645|ft}}.

Among freshwater lakes entirely contained within the state, the largest by area is [[Clear Lake (California)|Clear Lake]], which covers {{Convert|68|sqmi}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://researcharchive.calacademy.org/calwild/2004spring/stories/clearlake.html|accessdate=October 8, 2012|title=Forgotten Lake|publisher=California Academy of Sciences|first=Juliane Poirier|last=Locke|year=2004|journal=California Wild}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of California's large lakes are actually reservoirs:  artificial bodies of fresh water. In terms of both area and volume, the largest of these is [[Lake Shasta]], which formed behind [[Shasta Dam]] in the 1940s.  The dam can impound {{Convert|4552000|acre.ft|dam3}} of water over {{Convert|29740|acres|ha}}.&lt;ref name=Shasta&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.shastalakechamber.org/SLCOC/Shasta_Dam.html | title=Shasta Dam | accessdate=October 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lake Elsinore]], which covers {{Convert|3000|acres|ha}}, is billed as the largest natural freshwater lake in [[Southern California]].&lt;ref name=Elsinore&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lake-elsinore.org/index.aspx?page=172|accessdate=October 8, 2012|title=City of Lake Elsinore: Lake and Aquatic Resources}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== List ==
The list is alphabetized by the name of the lake, with the words ''lake'', ''of'', and ''the'' ignored.  To sort on a different column, click on the arrows in butt

Geographic coordinates, approximate elevations, alternative names, and other details may be obtained by following the [[Geographic Names Information System]] links in the third column.
 
Note: Lakes grow and shrink due to [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], [[evaporation]], releases, and diversions.
For this reason, many of the surface areas tabulated below are very approximate.  
For reservoirs, the areas at maximum water storage are indicated.  Reservoirs used for flood control are seldom allowed to reach maximum storage.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12251">This is a '''list of solar telescopes''' built in various countries around the world. A [[solar telescope]] is a specialized [[telescope]] that is used to observe the [[Sun]].

This list contains ground-based professional observatory telescopes at optical wavelengths in chronological order. Solar telescopes often have multiple focal lengths, and use a various combination of mirrors such as coelostats, lenses, and tubes for instruments including spectrographs, cameras, or coronagraphs. There are many types of instruments that have been designed to observe Earth's Sun, for example, in the 20th century [[solar towers]] were common.

'''''Lunar Prospector''''' was the third mission selected by [[NASA]] for full development and construction as part of the [[Discovery Program]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1998-001A|title=NASA - NSSDCA - Spacecraft - Details|website=nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov|access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a cost of $62.8 million, the 19-month mission was designed for a low [[polar orbit]] investigation of the [[Moon]], including mapping of surface composition including [[Lunar water|polar ice deposits]], measurements of [[magnetic field|magnetic]] and [[gravity field|gravity]] fields, and study of lunar outgassing events. The mission ended July 31, 1999, when the orbiter was deliberately crashed into a [[Shoemaker (lunar crater)|crater]] near the lunar [[south pole]] after the presence of water ice was successfully detected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://science.ksc.nasa.gov/mirrors/arc/prospector/science/results/lunarice/eureka.html|title=Eureka!

Data from the mission allowed the construction of a detailed map of the surface composition of the Moon, and helped to improve understanding of the origin, evolution, current state, and resources of the Moon. Several articles on the scientific results were published in the journal ''Science''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Improved Gravity Field of the Moon from ''Lunar Prospector'' |journal=Science| url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/281/5382/1476|author1=A.

''Lunar Prospector'' was managed by [[NASA Ames Research Center]] with the prime contractor [[Lockheed Martin]]. The Principal Investigator for the mission was [[Alan Binder]]. His personal account of the mission, ''Lunar Prospector:  Against all Odds'', is highly critical of the bureaucracy of NASA overall, and of its contractors.&lt;ref name = "Binder"&gt;{{Cite book | last=Binder | first = Alan B. | title=Lunar Prospector:  Against all Odds | publisher=Ken Press | date=2005 | location=Tucson | pages=1181 | url=http://google.com/books?id=emuvAAAACAAJ | isbn=978-1-928771-31-9 | oclc=61137782}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spacecraft and subsystems ==
[[File:Lunar Prospector in Clean Room - GPN-2000-001543.jpg|left|thumb|The fully assembled ''Lunar Prospector'' spacecraft is shown mated atop the Star 37 Trans Lunar Injection module]]
The spacecraft was a graphite-epoxy drum, {{convert|1.36|m|abbr=on}} in diameter and {{convert|1.28|m|abbr=on}} high with three radial {{convert|2.5|m|abbr=on}} instrument booms. A {{convert|1.1|m|abbr=on}} extension boom at the end of one of the 2.5 m booms held the magnetometer. Total initial mass (fully fueled) was {{convert|296|kg|abbr=on}}. It was spin-stabilized (nominal spin rate 12 rpm) with its spin axis normal to the ecliptic plane. The spacecraft was controlled by six [[hydrazine]] [[monopropellant]] 22-newton thrusters (two aft, two forward, and two tangential). Three fuel tanks mounted inside the drum held {{convert|138|kg|abbr=on}} of hydrazine pressurized by helium. The power system consisted of body-mounted solar cells which produced an average of 186 W and a 4.8 A'''·'''h rechargeable [[Nickel-cadmium battery|NiCd battery]]. 

Communications were through two [[S band]] transponders, a slotted, phased-array medium-gain antenna for downlink, and an omnidirectional low-gain antenna for downlink and uplink. The on-board computer was a [[Harris Corporation|Harris]] 80C86 with 64 [[kilobyte]]s of [[EEPROM]] and 64 kilobytes of static [[Random access memory|RAM]]. All control was from the ground, the computer echoing each command to the ground for verification there. Once the command was ground-verified, an "execute" command from the ground told the computer to proceed with execution of the command. The computer built telemetry data as a combination of immediate data and also read from a [[circular buffer|circular queue buffer]] which allowed the computer to repeat data it had read 53 minutes earlier. This simple solid-state recorder ensured that all data collected during communications blackout periods would be received, providing the blackout was not longer than 53 minutes.

The probe also carried a small amount of the remains of [[Eugene Shoemaker]] (April 28, 1928&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; July 18, 1997), astronomer and co-discoverer of [[Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9]], to the Moon for a [[space burial]].

Following launch on January 7, 1998 UT (6 January EST) aboard a four-stage [[Athena II]] [[rocket]], ''Lunar Prospector'' had a 105-hour cruise to the Moon. During the cruise, the three instrument booms were deployed. The MAG and APS collected calibration data, while the GRS, NS, and ER outgassed for one day, after which they also collected calibration data in [[cislunar space]]. The craft was inserted into an 11.6-hour period capture orbit about the Moon at the end of the cruise phase. After 24 hours ''Lunar Prospector'' was inserted into a 3.5-hour period intermediate orbit, followed 24 hours later (on January 13, 1998) by transfer into a {{convert|92|x|153|km|abbr=on}} preliminary mapping orbit, and then on 16 January by insertion into the near-circular {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} altitude nominal lunar polar mapping orbit with an inclination of 90 degrees and a period of 118 minutes. Lunar calibration data was collected during the 11.6- and 3.5-hour orbits. Lunar mapping data collection started shortly after the 118 minute orbit was achieved. The data collection was periodically interrupted during the mission as planned for orbital maintenance burns, which took place to recircularize the orbit whenever the [[periselene]] or [[aposelene]] was more than {{convert|20|km|abbr=on}} to {{convert|25|km|abbr=on}} from the 100&amp;nbsp;km nominal orbit; this occurred about once per month. On December 19, 1998, a maneuver lowered the orbit to {{convert|40|km|abbr=on}} to perform higher resolution studies. The orbit was altered again on 28 January to a {{convert|15|x|45|km|abbr=on}} orbit, ending the one year primary mission and beginning the extended mission.

The mission ended on July 31, 1999 at 9:52:02 UT (5:52:02 EDT) when ''Lunar Prospector'' was steered into a deliberate collision in a permanently shadowed area of the [[Shoemaker (lunar crater)|Shoemaker]] crater near the lunar south pole. It was hoped that the impact would liberate water vapor from the suspected ice deposits in the crater and that the plume would be detectable from Earth; however, no such plume was observed.

The ''Lunar Prospector'' mission was the third mission selected by NASA for full development and launch as part of NASA's Discovery Program. Total cost for the mission was $63 million including development ($34 million), launch vehicle (~$25 million) and operations (~$4 million).

== Scientific experiments ==
The spacecraft carried six instruments: a [[Gamma Ray Spectrometer]], a [[Neutron Spectrometer]], a [[Magnetometer]], an [[Electron Reflectometer]], an [[Alpha Particle Spectrometer]], and a Doppler Gravity Experiment. The instruments were omnidirectional and required no sequencing. The normal observation sequence was to record and downlink data continuously.

=== Gamma Ray Spectrometer (GRS) ===
The ''Lunar Prospector'' [[Gamma Ray Spectrometer|GRS]] produced the first global measurements of [[gamma-ray]] spectra from the lunar surface, from which are derived the first "direct" measurements of the chemical composition for the entire lunar surface. This data effectively mapped the distribution of various important elements across the Moon. For example, the ''Lunar Prospector'' GRS identified several regions with high iron concentrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iron Distribution - ''Lunar Prospector''|url=http://lunar.arc.nasa.gov/results/images/ironmap.jpg|publisher=''[[NASA]]''|accessdate=2008-07-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626081909/http://lunar.arc.nasa.gov/results/images/ironmap.jpg|archivedate=2008-06-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Lunar Thorium concentrations.jpg|thumb|[[Thorium]] concentrations on the Moon, as mapped by ''Lunar Prospector'']]
The fundamental purpose of the GRS experiment was to provide global maps of elemental abundances on the lunar surface. The GRS was designed to record the spectrum of gamma rays emitted by:
# the radioactive decay of elements contained in the Moon's crust; and
# elements in the crust bombarded by cosmic rays and solar wind particles.
The most important elements detectable by the GRS were uranium (U), thorium (Th), and potassium (K), radioactive elements which generate gamma rays spontaneously, and iron (Fe), titanium (Ti), oxygen (O), silicon (Si), aluminum (Al), magnesium (Mg), and calcium (Ca), elements which emit gamma rays when hit by cosmic rays or solar wind particles. The uranium, thorium, and potassium in particular were used to map the location of [[KREEP]] (potassium, rare-earth element, and phosphorus containing material, which is thought  to have developed late in the formation of the crust and upper mantle, and is therefore important to understanding lunar evolution). The GRS was also capable of detecting fast (epithermal) neutrons, which complemented the neutron spectrometer in the search for water on the Moon.

The Gamma Ray Spectrometer was a small cylinder which was mounted on the end of one of the three {{convert|2.5|m|abbr=on}} radial booms extending from ''Lunar Prospector''. It consisted of a bismuth germanate crystal surrounded by a shield of borated plastic. Gamma rays striking the bismuth atoms produced a flash of light with an intensity proportional to the energy of the gamma ray which was recorded by detectors. The energy of the gamma ray is associated with the element responsible for its emission. Due to a low signal-to-noise ratio, multiple passes were required to generate statistically significant results. At nine passes per month, it was expected to take about three months to confidently estimate abundances of thorium, potassium, and uranium, and 12 months for the other elements. The precision varies according to element measured. For U, Th, and K, the precision is 7% to 15%, for Fe 45%, for Ti 20%, and for the overall distribution of KREEP 15% to 30%. The borated plastic shield was used in the detection of fast neutrons. The GRS was designed to achieve global coverage from an altitude of approximately {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} and with a surface resolution of {{convert|150|km|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Science | date = 1998 | volume = 281 | issue = 5382 | pages = 1484–1489 | doi = 10.1126/science.281.5382.1484 | title = Global Elemental Maps of the Moon: The ''Lunar Prospector'' Gamma-Ray Spectrometer | author = D.

=== Neutron Spectrometer (NS) ===
Based on the ''Lunar Prospector'' Neutron Spectrometer (NS) data, mission scientists have determined that there is enough evidence for [[Lunar water|lunar water ice]] in the polar craters of the Moon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Neutron Spectrometer Results |url=http://lunar.arc.nasa.gov/results/neures.htm |publisher=NASA |accessdate=2008-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531054648/http://lunar.arc.nasa.gov/results/neures.htm |archivedate=2008-05-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; an estimated 3 billion [[metric ton]]s (800 billion US gallons).

The NS was designed to detect minute amounts of water ice which were believed to exist on the Moon. It was capable of detecting water ice at a level of less than 0.01%. the Moon has a number of permanently shadowed craters near the poles with continuous temperatures of {{convert|-190|C|F}}. These craters may act as cold-traps of water from incoming comets and meteoroids. Any water from these bodies which found its way into these craters could become permanently frozen. The NS was also used to measure the abundance of hydrogen implanted by [[solar wind]].

The neutron spectrometer was a thin cylinder colocated with the Alpha Particle Spectrometer at the end of one of the three radial ''Lunar Prospector'' science booms. The instrument had a surface resolution of {{convert|150|km|abbr=on}}. For the polar ice studies, the NS was slated to examine the poles to 80 degrees latitude, with a sensitivity of at least 10 ppm by volume of hydrogen. For the implanted hydrogen studies, the NS was intended to examine the entire globe with a sensitivity of 50 ppmv. The neutron spectrometer consisted of two canisters each containing helium-3 and an energy counter. Any neutrons colliding with the helium atoms give an energy signature which can be detected and counted. One of the canisters was wrapped in [[cadmium]], and one in [[tin]]. The cadmium screens out thermal (low energy or slow-moving) neutrons, while the tin does not. Thermal neutrons are [[cosmic ray|cosmic-ray]]-generated neutrons which have lost much of their energy in collisions with hydrogen atoms. Differences in the counts between the two canisters indicate the number of thermal neutrons detected, which in turn indicates the amount of hydrogen in the Moon's crust at a given location. Large quantities of hydrogen would likely be due to the presence of water.

=== The Alpha Particle Spectrometer (APS) ===
The Alpha Particle Spectrometer (APS) was damaged during launch, ruining one of the five detecting faces. Additionally, due to [[sunspot]] activity peaking during the mission, the lunar data was obscured by solar interference. The information was eventually recovered by subtracting out the effects of the solar activity.

The APS was designed to detect [[radon]] outgassing events on the surface of the Moon. The APS recorded [[alpha particle]] signatures of radioactive decay of radon gas and its byproduct product, [[polonium]]. These putative outgassing events, in which radon, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide are vented, are hypothesized to be the source of the tenuous lunar atmosphere, and may be the result of the low-level volcanic/tectonic activity on the Moon. Information on the existence, timing, and sources of these events may help in a determination of the style and rate of lunar tectonics.

The APS was a cube approximately {{convert|18|cm|abbr=on}} colocated with the neutron spectrometer on the end of one of the three radial {{convert|2.5|m|abbr=on}} ''Lunar Prospector'' science booms. It contained ten silicon detectors sandwiched between gold and [[aluminum disk]]s arranged on five of six sides of the cube. Alpha particles, produced by the decay of radon and polonium, leave tracks of charge on the silicon wafers when they impact the silicon. A high voltage is applied to the silicon, and the current is amplified by being funneled along the tracks to the aluminum disk and is recorded for identification. The APS was designed to make a global examination of gas release events and polonium distribution with a surface resolution of {{convert|150|km|abbr=on}} and a precision of 10%.

=== Doppler Gravity Experiment (DGE) ===
[[File:LPgravityfield.png|thumb|350px|A visualization of the lunar gravity field based on spherical harmonic coefficients determined from ''Lunar Prospector'' data. The left side of the image shows the far side of the Moon where the increased uncertainty in the gravity field can be seen.]]
The Doppler Gravity Experiment (DGE) was the first polar, low-altitude mapping of the lunar gravity field. The [[Clementine mission|''Clementine'' mission]] had previously produced a relatively low-resolution map, but the ''Prospector'' DGE obtained data approximately five times as detailed: the "first truly operational gravity map of the Moon".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Doppler Gravity Experiment Results|url=http://lunar.arc.nasa.gov/results/dopres.htm|publisher=NASA|accessdate=2008-07-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080712080232/http://lunar.arc.nasa.gov/results/dopres.htm|archivedate=2008-07-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practical benefits of this are more stable long-term orbits and better fuel efficiency. Additionally, the DGE data is hoped to help researchers learn more about lunar origins and the nature of the lunar core. The DGE identified three new near-side [[mass concentration (astronomy)|mass concentration]] regions.

The purpose of the ''Lunar Prospector'' DGE was to learn about the surface and internal mass distribution of the Moon. This is accomplished by measuring the [[Doppler shift]] in the [[S-band]] tracking signal as it reaches Earth, which can be converted to spacecraft accelerations. The accelerations can be processed to provide estimates of the lunar gravity field, from which the location and size of mass anomalies affecting the spacecraft orbit can be modeled. Estimates of the surface and internal mass distribution give information on the crust, lithosphere, and [[Geology of the Moon|internal structure of the Moon]].

This experiment provided the first lunar gravity data from a low polar orbit. Because line-of-sight tracking was required for this experiment, only the near-side gravity field could be estimated using this Doppler method. The experiment was a byproduct of the spacecraft [[S band]] tracking, and so has no listed weight or power requirements. The experiment was designed to give the near-side gravity field with a surface resolution of {{convert|200|km|abbr=on}} and precision of 5 [[Galileo (unit)|mGal]] (0.05&amp;nbsp;mm/s²) in the form of [[spherical harmonic]] coefficients to degree and order 60. In the extended mission, in which the spacecraft descended to an orbit with an altitude of {{convert|50|km|abbr=on}} and then to {{convert|10|km|abbr=on}}, this resolution was expected to improve by a factor of 100 or more.

The downlink telemetry signal was transmitted at 2273&amp;nbsp;MHz, over a ±1&amp;nbsp;MHz bandwidth as a right-hand circularly [[Polarization (waves)|polarized]] signal at a nominal power of 5 W and peak power of 7 W. Command uplinks were sent at 2093.0542&amp;nbsp;MHz over a ±1&amp;nbsp;MHz bandwidth. The transponder was a standard Loral/Conic S-Band transponder. An omnidirectional antenna can be used for uplink and downlink, or a medium gain helix antenna can be used (downlink only). Since the spacecraft was spin-stabilized, the spin resulted in a bias in the Doppler signal due to the spacecraft antenna pattern spinning with respect to the Earth station of 0.417&amp;nbsp;Hz (27.3&amp;nbsp;mm/s) for the omnidirectional antenna, and −0.0172&amp;nbsp;Hz (−1.12&amp;nbsp;mm/s) for the medium gain antenna. LOS data was sampled at 5 seconds to account for the approximately 5 second spin rate of the spacecraft, leaving a residual of less than 0.1&amp;nbsp;mm/s.

=== Electron Reflectometer and Magnetometer (MAG/ER) ===
The Magnetometer and Electron Reflectometer (collectively, MAG/ER) detected anomalous surface magnetic fields on the Moon, which are in stark contrast to a global [[magnetosphere]] (which the Moon lacks). the Moon's overall magnetic field is too weak to deflect the [[solar wind]], but MAG/ER discovered a small surface anomaly that can do so. This anomaly, about {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} in diameter, has therefore been referred to as "the smallest known magnetosphere, [[magnetosheath]] and [[bow shock]] system in the Solar System."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Magnetometer / Electron Reflectometer results |url=http://lunar.arc.nasa.gov/results/magelres.htm |publisher=NASA |accessdate=2008-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527121330/http://lunar.arc.nasa.gov/results/magelres.htm |archivedate=2010-05-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this and other magnetic features of the Moon's surface, hydrogen deposited by [[solar wind]] is non-uniformly distributed, being denser at the periphery of the magnetic features. Since hydrogen density is a desirable characteristic for hypothetical lunar bases, this information may be useful in choosing optimal sites for possible long-term Moon missions.

The electron reflectometer (ER) and [[magnetometer]] (MAG) were designed to collect information on the lunar [[magnetic field]]s. the Moon has no global magnetic field, but it does have weak localized magnetic fields at its surface. These may be paleomagnetic remnants of a former global magnetic field, or may be due to [[meteor]] impacts or other local phenomena. This experiment was to help map these fields and provide information on their origins, allow possible examination of distribution of [[mineral]]s on the lunar surface, aid in a determination of the size and composition of the lunar core, and provide information on the lunar induced magnetic [[dipole]].

The ER determined the location and strength of magnetic fields from the [[energy spectrum]] and direction of [[electron]]s. The instrument measured the pitch [[angle]]s of [[solar wind]] electrons reflected from the Moon by lunar magnetic fields. Stronger local magnetic fields can reflect electrons with larger pitch angles.  [[Field strength]]s as small as 0.01 [[nanotesla|nT]] could be measured with a spatial accuracy of about {{convert|3|km|abbr=on}} at the lunar surface. The MAG was a triaxial fluxgate magnetometer similar in design to the instrument used on [[Mars Global Surveyor]]. It could measure the magnetic field [[amplitude]] and direction at spacecraft altitude with a spatial resolution of about {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} when ambient [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] disturbances are minimal.

The ER and the electronics package were located at the end of one of the three radial science booms on ''Lunar Prospector''. The MAG was in turn extended further on a {{convert|0.8|m|abbr=on}} boom&amp;mdash;a combined {{convert|2.6|m|abbr=on}} from ''Lunar Prospector'' in order to isolate it from spacecraft generated magnetic fields. The ER and MAG instruments had a combined mass of {{convert|5|kg|abbr=on}} and used 4.5 [[watt]]s of power.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2414">'''Masreliez theorem''' describes a [[Recursion (computer science)|recursive algorithm]] within the technology of extended [[Kalman filter]], named after the Swedish-American [[physicist]] [[C. Johan Masreliez|John Masreliez]], who is its author.  The algorithm estimates the state of a [[Dynamical system|dynamic system]] with the help of often incomplete measurements marred by [[distortion]].&lt;ref&gt;T. Cipra &amp; A. Rubio; [http://www.springerlink.com/content/k638271765473144/ ''Kalman filter with a non-linear non-Gaussian observation relation''], Springer (1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

Masreliez's theorem produces estimates that are quite good approximations to the exact [[Conditional expectation|conditional mean]] in [[Non-Gaussianity|non-Gaussian]] additive outlier (AO) situations.  Some evidence for this can be had by [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo simulation]]s.&lt;ref name=jasa87&gt;{{Citation|author=R. Douglas Martin and Adrian E. Raftery |accessdate=2016-03-27 |date=December 1987 |publication-date=2003-10-15 |title=Robustness, Computation, and Non-Euclidean Models |trans-title= |pages=1044–1050 |publisher=[[Journal of the American Statistical Association]] |language= |url=https://www.stat.washington.edu/raftery/Research/PDF/martin1987.pdf |quote= }} (PDF 1465 kB)&lt;!--Journal of the American Statistical Association December 1987. Vol. 82. No. 400, Theory and Methods--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The key approximation property used to construct these filters is that the [[Density (disambiguation)#Mathematics|state prediction density]] is approximately [[Gaussian function|Gaussian]]. Masreliez discovered in 1975 that this approximation yields an intuitively appealing [[Non-Gaussianity|non-Gaussian]] filter recursions, with [[Data dependency|data dependent]] [[covariance]] (unlike the Gaussian case) this derivation also provides one of the nicest ways of establishing the standard Kalman filter recursions.  Some theoretical justification for use of the Masreliez approximation is provided by the "continuity of state prediction densities" theorem in Martin (1979).&lt;ref name=jasa87/&gt;

'''Molly Woods''' is a fictional character from the science fiction drama series ''[[Extant (TV series)|Extant]]'', played by [[Halle Berry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Bill Keveney|title=Halle Berry to star in CBS summer series, 'Extant'|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2013/10/04/halle-berry-to-star-in-cbs-summer-series-extant/2924037/|accessdate=2014-07-27|work=USA Today|date=2013-10-04|ref=1|quote=Berry, who won an Oscar for Monster's Ball, will play an astronaut.}}&lt;/ref&gt; She made her first screen appearance in the show's pilot episode "Re-Entry", which first aired on July 9, 2014 on the [[CBS]] network in the United States.

Molly is an [[astronaut]]. She is married to John Woods and is the mother of Ethan Woods, a "humanich" [[android (robot)|android]]. While aboard a spaceflight to ''ISEA'' (the fictional space agency that replaced [[NASA]]) spacestation, she inexplicably becomes pregnant during the 13-month solo voyage. She returns to Earth amid chaotic happenings with her family life while in the space program and unexplained events of the early pregnancy. She goes through medical and psychological tests after returning to ''ISEA''.

==Present time==
The ''believed dead'' Harmon Kryger makes an attempt to contact Molly after she has an eventful day with her husband John and son Ethan. From hurried and missed breakfast with John, to the trip to the museum with Ethan which features Ethan with more questions than answers from Molly. Also, the revelation from Sam Barton that her brain scans are just like Krygers, (but he died) and she is 14 weeks pregnant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Leslie Bohem|title=Season 1 - Episode 2 - Extinct|url=http://www.cbs.com|website=CBS|accessdate=2014-07-26|ref=2|archiveurl=http://extant-cbs.com/episode-guide/season-1-episode-2-extinct/|archivedate=2014-07-16|location=Los Angeles|format=Text|date=2014-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The night is just as mysterious as the Woods prepare for the next day's events.

Later we see Ethan prepared for interaction with children at school, as Molly defends his place in a school setting to the worried parents. Molly reveals to John, she just signed up for another rotation on the ''Seraphim,'' while John was ready to add Ethan to the family. Molly objects saying, "you just can't plug and play a family." Molly's boss interrupts her morning jog to let her in on the '''Covert''' program that allowed her to become pregnant by timed release [[Nano-technology]]. He mentions her brain scans that matched ''Kryger's'' and that's what led to his suicide.

Unbeknownst to Molly ''Director Sparks'' is planning to covertly bring her in for further study with a medical team. Her doctor ''Dr. Barton,'' arrives that night to draw a blood sample to determine the [[DNA]] of Molly's unborn fetus. Later, Molly reveals to John she is pregnant and that she is afraid he wouldn't believe her.

==Flashbacks to the past==
In the opening, we see Molly in a darkened room reminiscing about earlier times with Marcus. She goes to the bookcase and removes an old photo album, and we see a picture of her with Marcus in his ''ISEA'' mission uniform with Molly and it's a moving scene. They begin to look at each other and tighten their embrace. She is interrupted when John appears after putting Ethan in rest mode for the night. Next we see her aboard the ''Seraphim'' initiating bio-sample tests on plants and worms, when ''Ben,'' her onboard computer (a disembodied voice) tells her of an incoming  ''v-com,'' or video communication from John and Ethan. The ''v-com'' is interrupted by what ''Ben'' says is a [[solar flare]]. ''Ben'' then goes offline while Molly frantically tries to reboot.

That's when we first see ''Marcus'' appear to Molly's shock and surprise. She and Marcus interact briefly after she tries to burn her hand to attempt to see if the person she sees is real. Next we see Molly explaining away 13 lost hours of video from the space station. ''Gordon Kern,'' (the deputy director of ''ISEA'') mentions the backup cameras on board the ''Seraphim,'' and questions Molly about the lost footage which she explains away (not convincingly to Director Sparks) as a glitch.

We see Molly wake up in the lab and in a frantic scene we see her playback the security video footage to see if Marcus is there, and he's not, but she realizes she has to hide the footage from ''ISEA'' since ''Marcus'' died years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Zap2It (KTLA)|title=Extant: Re-entry Review|url=http://www.zap2it.com/videos/extant-reentry-455604|website=www.zap2it.com|accessdate=2014-07-27|ref=7|location=Hollywood, California|format=Video|quote=Of course, Molly is torn with that reality.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next night John has the birthday party for Molly and they invite friends and close ''ISEA'' associates. Dr. Barton arrives to take the blood sample from Molly, after she leaves Molly has sharp pains in her stomach and then flashes back to the event on the ''Seraphim'' with Marcus saying "it's ok." Then Molly returns to the party and the doorbell rings and it's ''Tim Dawkins,'' Marcus' brother. Molly hasn't seen ''Tim'' for a while. He tells her he's on furlough and decided to drop by. We learn she actually hasn't seen ''Tim'' in eight years since she lost the baby and Marcus. He curiously asks Molly if she has seen Marcus and tries to reassure Molly that it will be all right. Next we see Molly call Tim over when John wants a group party picture. She mingles in the party for a while. Then after revealing her secret to John they return and Molly asks John if he has seen Tim.

Molly suddenly realizes she is the only one who has seen ''Tim'' and something is happening to her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Henry A.

Dr. '''Morley Richard Kare''' (1922–1990) was a [[physiologist]] and [[biologist]].

Morley Richard Kare was born in 1922 in [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]]. He received his bachelor's degree in [[agriculture]] from the [[University of Manitoba]] in 1943, his master’s in [[nutrition]] from the [[University of British Columbia]] in 1948 and his Ph.D. in [[physiology]] from [[Cornell University]] in 1952.

Dr. Kare taught physiology at Cornell University, [[North Carolina State University]] and the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. Although his early research focused on [[muscle]] [[biochemistry]] and [[metabolism]], he became increasingly interested in the senses of taste and smell and how these senses contribute to nutrition and food choice across species.  Kare is best remembered for founding the [[Monell Chemical Senses Center]], a multidisciplinary basic research institute devoted to the science of taste and smell, located in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]. He served as the Center’s first Director from 1968 until his death in 1990, at which point Dr. [[Gary Beauchamp]] took over.

In his memory, the Monell Center created the Morley R. Kare Fellows Fund in 1990. The Fund helps support scientists beginning careers in the chemical senses.

'''Nikolai Grigoryevich Cholodny''' ({{lang-ru|Никола́й Григо́рьевич Холо́дный }}; 22 June 1882 – 4 May 1953) was an influential microbiologist who worked at the [[University of Kiev]], [[Ukrainian SSR|Ukraine]] in the [[USSR]] during the 1930s.

He is known for the [[Cholodny–Went model]], which he developed independently with [[Frits Warmolt Went]] of the [[California Institute of Technology]].
Despite being associated with the same theory, the two men never actually met.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In 1927 Cholodny proposed that the cells of the [[coleoptile]] are first polarized under the influence of uneven exposure to light, so growth hormone can diffuse more rapidly towards the side in the shade than in any other direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Orra White Hitchcock''' (March 8, 1796 – May 26, 1863) was one of America's earliest women botanical and scientific illustrators and artists, best known for illustrating the scientific works of her husband, geologist [[Edward Hitchcock]] (1793–1864), but also notable for her own artistic and scientific work.

== Life ==

Hitchcock was born to a prosperous farming family (Jarib and Ruth Sherman White) in [[South Amherst, Massachusetts]].  She was educated by a tutor and at two “ladies” schools, proved herself a child prodigy in numerous scientific and classical subjects, and showed early promise in drawing and painting.  From 1813 to 1818 she taught young girls natural sciences, and the fine and decorative arts at [[Deerfield Academy]].  Her early training grounded her in both science and art. Hitchcock has been called the [[Connecticut River]] Valley's “earliest and most often published woman artist.”&lt;ref&gt;Eugene C. Worman Jr., “The Watercolors and Prints of Orra White Hitchcock,” ''AB Bookman’s Weekly'' 83:7 (February 13, 1989), p. 646.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitchcock's art was integral to the work of her husband, geologist [[Edward Hitchcock]], Principal of Deerfield Academy, minister, professor and third president of [[Amherst College]] (1845–1854). She made hundreds of illustrations for Edward Hitchcock's scientific publications, including detailed landscapes of the [[Connecticut River]] Valley for his Massachusetts geological survey volumes, and custom designed charts that illustrated his local discoveries and his classroom lectures.  In addition, she made detailed drawings of native flowers and grasses and small precise watercolors of small local mushrooms.  Her work is a time-focused chronicle of the scenic, botanically and geologically diverse Connecticut River Valley in western Massachusetts. Orra White Hitchocock, a scientist in her own right, had the contemporary reputation as one of the valley's “most distinguished naturalists.”&lt;ref&gt;Stephen W. Williams, M.D., “Report on the Indigenous Medical Botany of Massachusetts,” ''Transactions of the American Medical Association'' 2 (1849); accessed online at: [http://www.herbaltherapeutics.net/Mass.doc.pdf www.herbaltherapeutics.net/Mass.doc.pdf] on p. [2] of the PDF file; accessed February 12, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Painted herbarium ==

Between 1817 and 1821 the Hitchcock and her husband collected native plants for a conventional herbarium. At the same time, she created a 64-page album of watercolors of about 175 local flower and grass specimens for her Herbarium parvum, pictum.  This painted herbarium is in the Deerfield Academy Archives.&lt;ref&gt;http://deerfield.edu/about/archives/gallery/orra-white-hitchcock-herbarium/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mushroom album ==

Orra White married Edward Hitchcock on May 31, 1821.  In the summer and fall, she created a small watercolor album of native mushrooms and lichens, Fungi selecti picti.  Edward Hitchcock labeled and catalogued the specimens.  This painted album is in the Smith College Archives; a facsimile has been published by the Mortimer Rare Book Room, Smith College.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smith.edu/libraries/libs/rarebook/publications&lt;/ref&gt;

== Landscapes and geological illustrations ==

Orra White Hitchcock made drawings for more than 200 plates and 1,000 wood-engraved or woodcut illustrations for Edward Hitchcock's professional publications.  The subjects included landscapes, geologic strata, specimens, and more. The most well known appear in her husband's seminal works, the 1833 ''Report on the Geology, Mineralogy, Botany, and Zoology of Massachusetts'' and its successor, the 1841 ''Final Report'' produced when he was State Geologist.  For the 1833 edition, [[Pendleton's Lithography|Pendleton's Lithography]] (Boston) [[Lithography|lithographed]] nine of Orra White Hitchcock's [[Connecticut River]] Valley drawings and printed them as plates for the work.  In 1841, [[B.W. Thayer &amp; Co.|B. W. Thayer and Co.]], Lithographers (Boston) printed revised lithographs and an additional plate.  The hand-colored plate "Autumnal Scenery. View in Amherst" is Orra White Hitchcock's most frequently seen work.

== Classroom drawings ==

Between 1828 and the 1840s, Hitchcock made hundreds of large and dramatic classroom charts of geologic cross-sections, prehistoric beasts (like the Megatherium), fossils and ichnological (later called dinosaur) footprints.  She copied scientific illustrations from contemporary works and made original illustrations of Edward Hitchcock's new ideas or discoveries, like “Ornithichnites, Hitch.”  He considered them “indispensable aids” for his lectures.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Hitchcock, ''Reminiscences of Amherst College'', Northampton, Mass.: Bridgman and Childs, 1863, p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Amherst College Archives and Special Collections holds an extensive collection of classroom charts.

== Other works ==

Hitchcock's first documented published drawing is from an 1818 article by Edward_Hitchcock in the periodical ''[[Port Folio (magazine)|Port Folio]]''.  On rare occasions, she created illustrations for other scientists. Hitchcock's last documented work was her symbolic illustrations for her husband's ''Religious Lectures on Peculiar Phenomena in the Four Seasons'',&lt;ref&gt;Edward Hitchcock. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ntoTAAAAYAAJ Religious Lectures on Peculiar Phenomena in the Four Seasons]'' (Amherst, Mass.:  J.S. &amp; C. Adams, 1850).&lt;/ref&gt; including an emblematic representation of spring and a stylized rainbow.

Orra White Hitchcock raised 6 surviving children, taught them art and science and was Edward Hitchcock's partner in his scientific undertakings. She travelled with her husband in the United States and to England and Europe (in 1850).  She is the mother of geologist [[Charles Henry Hitchcock]] (1836–1919) and physical education and hygiene pioneer [[Edward Hitchcock Jr.|Edward Hitchcock, Jr.]] (1828–1911).

Edward_Hitchcock acknowledged his wife's essential contributions to his work in the dedication of ''The Religion of Geology'',&lt;ref&gt;Edward Hitchcock. [https://books.google.com/books?id=UBgHAAAAQAAJ The Religion of Geology and its Connected Sciences] (Boston: Phillips, Sampson &amp; Co., 1851).&lt;/ref&gt; citing her drawings as more powerful than his pen.

Orra White Hitchcock died at 67 on May 26, 1863 from [[Consumption (disease)|consumption]].

Though she was not a trained professional, Hitchcock's scientific intellect and the artistic ability to visually transcribe key scientific principles and natural phenomena, flora and fauna, enabled her to make substantial contributions to the understanding of geology and botany in the first half of the nineteenth century in the United States.
   
While published illustrations exist, only a small number of Hitchcock's original works survives.  The Amherst College Archives and Special Collections has the most extensive documentation of her life and work, in the ''Edward and Orra White Hitchcock Papers''&lt;ref&gt;[http://asteria.fivecolleges.edu/findaids/amherst/ma27_main.html Edward and Orra White Hitchcock Papers, Amherst College Archives and Special Collections.]&lt;/ref&gt; and copies of all of Edward Hitchcock's scientific publications.  The [[Mead Art Museum]] at Amherst College held the first major retrospective exhibition of her work in 2011, "Orra White Hitchcock (1796-1863): An Amherst Woman of Art and Science," with a catalogue.&lt;ref&gt;Robert L. Herbert and Daria D’Arienzo, ''Orra White Hitchcock (1796-1863):  An Amherst Woman of Art and Science'' (Amherst, Mass.: [[Mead Art Museum]] and [[University Press of New England]], 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|List of psychological research methods}}

Psychologists use many research methods, and categorical distinctions of these methods have emerged. Methods can be categorized by the kind of data they produce: [[Qualitative psychological research|qualitative]] or [[Quantitative psychological research|quantitative]]—and both these are used for [[Pure research|pure]] or [[applied research]].

[[Psychology]] tends to be [[eclecticism|eclectic]], applying knowledge from other fields. Some of its methods are used within other areas of research, especially in the [[social sciences|social]] and [[behavioural sciences]].

=== Experimental methods ===
{{main article|Experiment|Experimental psychology}}

The field of psychology commonly uses experimental methods in what is known as [[experimental psychology]]. Researchers design experiments to test specific [[Hypothesis|hypotheses]] (the [[deductive reasoning|deductive approach]]), or to evaluate functional relationships (the [[inductive reasoning|inductive approach]]).

The method of experimentation involves an experimenter changing some influence—the ''[[independent variable]](IV)''— on the research subjects, and studying the effects it produces on an expected aspect—the ''[[dependent variable]] (DV)''— of the subjects behaviour or experience.&lt;ref name="randomHouse"&gt;''Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary.'' Random House, Inc. 2001. Page 534, 971. {{ISBN|0-375-42566-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other variables researchers consider in experimentation are known as the ''[[extraneous variables]]'', and are either ''[[Control variable|controllable]]'' or ''[[confounding]]'' (more than one variable at play).

Confounding variables are external variables that are not taken into account when conducting an experiment. Because they are not controlled for, they can skew experiments results and provide a false or unreliable conclusion. For example, the psychologist Seymour Feshbach conducted an experiment to see how [[violence]] on [[television]] (the independent variable), affected [[aggression]] in [[adolescent]] [[boy]]s (the dependent variable). He published his results in a paper called ''Television and Aggression'' in 1971. The paper showed that, in some cases, the lack of violence on television made the boys ''more'' aggressive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED062791&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED062791|title=Television and Aggression.|first1=Seymour|last1=Feshbach|first2=Robert D.|last2=Singer|publisher=|via=eric.ed.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was due to a confounding variable, which in this case was [[frustration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.amsciepub.com/doi/abs/10.2466/pr0.1986.58.1.111|title=AGGRESSIVE RESPONSES OF ADOLESCENTS TO AN HYPOTHETICAL FRUSTRATIVE SITUATION|journal=Psychological Reports|first1=YOSHIHARU|last1=TACHIBANA|first2=ETSUSHI|last2=HASEGAWA|publisher=|volume=58|issue=1|pages=111–118|doi=10.2466/pr0.1986.58.1.111|pmid=3961055|year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that extraneous variables are important to consider when [[Design of experiments|designing experiments]], and many methods have emerged to [[Scientific control|scientifically control them]]. For this reason, many experiments in [[psychology]] are conducted in [[laboratory]] conditions where they can be more strictly regulated.

Alternatively, some experiments are less controlled. [[Quasi-experiment]]'s are those that a researcher sets up in a controlled environment, but does not control the independent variable. For example, Michael R. Cunningham used a quasi-experiment to "...measure the physical in physical attractiveness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;id=1986-21934-001|title=PsycNET - Option to Buy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, in [[field experiment]]s the experimenter controls an independent variable (making it the control variable), but does not control the environment where the experiment takes place. Experimenters sometimes apply fewer controls, as a way to lessen potential biases. In a ''[[true experiment]]'', participants are randomly chosen to remove the chance of [[experimenter's bias]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://changingminds.org/explanations/research/design/experiment_types.htm|title=Types of experiment|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/SommerB/sommerdemo/experiment/types.htm|title=Experiments: Types|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Observational methods ===
{{Main article|Observational study}}

''Observational research,'' (a type of non-experimental, [[Correlational research|correlational]] research), involves the researcher observing the ongoing behaviour of their subjects. &lt;ref name="psych.csufresno.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://psych.csufresno.edu/psy144/Content/Design/Nonexperimental/observation.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121214185456/http://psych.csufresno.edu/psy144/Content/Design/Nonexperimental/observation.html |archivedate=2012-12-14 |df= }}

&lt;/ref&gt; There are multiple methods of observational research such as ''participant observations'', ''non-participant observations'' and ''naturalistic observations''.&lt;ref name="psych.csufresno.edu" /&gt;



Participant observations are methods that involve a researcher joining the particular social group they are studying. For example, the [[Social psychology|social psychologist]], [[Leon Festinger]] and his associates, joined a group called ''The Seekers'' in order to observe them. The Seekers believed they were in touch with aliens, and that the aliens had told them the world was about to end.&lt;ref name="Leon Festinger 1956" /&gt; When the foretasted event didn't happen, Festinger and his associates observed how the attitudes of the group members changed. They published their results in a 1956 book called ''[[When Prophecy Fails]]''. [[David Rosenhan]] in 1973 published a journal that involved research by participant observations.&lt;ref name="psych.csufresno.edu" /&gt;'' see: [[:Rosenhan experiment|on being sane in insane places]]''.

The other method of observational research is non-participant observation. In particular  [[Naturalistic observation|naturalistic methods]] are methods that simply study behaviours that occur naturally in natural environments—with no manipulation by the observer.&lt;ref name=KCherry&gt;{{cite web |last=Cherry |first=Kendra |title=What Is Naturalistic Observation? |url=http://psychology.about.com/od/nindex/g/naturalistic.htm |publisher=About.com |accessdate=15 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Psychology 202Q Lab: Naturalistic Observation |url=http://www.sp.uconn.edu/~ps202vc/PDF/NaturalisticObservation.pdf |publisher=University of Connecticut |accessdate=15 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The events studied ''must'' be natural and not staged. This fact gives naturalistic observational research a high [[ecological validity]].&lt;ref name="psych.csufresno.edu" /&gt; During naturalistic observations, researchers can avoid interfering with the behavior they are observing by using [[Unobtrusive research|unobtrusive]] methods,&lt;ref name=NatObs&gt;{{cite web |title=Naturalistic Observation |publisher=radford.edu |url=http://www.radford.edu/~tpierce/201%20files/201%20handouts/Naturalistic%20Observationl%20ecture%20notes.pdf |accessdate=15 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; if needed.

Both types of observational methods are designed to be as [[wikt:reliability|reliable]] as possible. Reliability can be estimated using ''inter-observer reliability'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialresearchmethods.net/kb/reltypes.php|title=Types of Reliability|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is, by comparing observations conducted by different researchers. ''Intra-observer reliability'' means estimating the reliability of an observation using a comparison of observations conducted by the same researcher. The reliability of conducted studies is important in any field of [[science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridge.org/gb/knowledge/isbn/item2711519/?site_locale=en_GB|title=Reliability in Scientific Research|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''For a [[statistics|statistical]] perspective of reliability, see also'' [[Reliability (statistics)]].

=== Descriptive methods ===
{{Main article|Descriptive research}}

All [[Science|scientific]] processes begin with a description based on observation. Theories may develop later to explain these observations&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cliffsnotes.com/study_guide/Descriptive-Correlational-Research.topicArticleId-25438,articleId-25309.html&lt;/ref&gt; or classify associated phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Babbie, Earl.1989. The Practice of Social Research. 5th edition. Belmont CA: Wadsworth&lt;/ref&gt; In [[scientific methodology]], the conceptualizing of descriptive research precedes the [[Hypothesis|hypotheses]] of "explanatory research".&lt;ref&gt;Shields, Patricia and HassanTajalli. 2006. Intermediate Theory: The Missing Link in Successful Student Scholarship. Journal of Public Affairs Education. Vol. 12, No. 3. Pp. 313-334. http://ecommons.txstate.edu/polsfacp/39/&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a descriptive device used in psychological research is the ''[[diary]]'', which is used to record observations. There is a history of use of diaries within [[clinical psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpp.302/abstract|title=Diaries in clinical psychology and psychotherapy: a selective review|first1=Claudia|last1=Thiele|first2=Anton-Rupert|last2=Laireiter|first3=Urs|last3=Baumann|date=1 January 2002|publisher=|journal=Clin. Psychol. Psychother.|volume=9|issue=1|pages=1–37|via=Wiley Online Library|doi=10.1002/cpp.302}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of psychologists that used them include [[B.F. Skinner]] (1904–1990) and [[Virginia Axline]] (1911–1988). A special case of a diary in this context, that has particular importance in [[Developmental psychology|development psychology]], is known as the ''baby biography'',&lt;ref&gt;Springer 1995, The Role of Emotions in Social and Personality Development: History, Theory, and Research
Volume 1 of Emotions, Personality, and Psychotherapy&lt;/ref&gt; and was used by psychologists such as [[Jean Piaget]].

Other recording methods can include video or audio. For example, [[Forensic psychology|forensic psychologists]] record custodial interrogations to aid law enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:0eHdREE3gzwJ:web.me.com/gregdeclue/Site/Volume_1__2009_files/2009-excerpt-Lassiter.pdf+&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESiOhJrHmEKPcD4h6aEo6zKLgzNXzhzE0tqZxd2JiXITdH_sb1ja0HJ7U0HK0LRHe8mHJYaAt0xZBJ3UJoOzC0_pzfWdyrgSrheazYmyOAyGaJUnwHT_-bMMlBpisle6_YLdEefq&amp;sig=AHIEtbQnwQmhrPIDjv9H9wd2_4LUqHj-Qw&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Case studies ===
{{Main article|Case study in psychology}}

A ''case study''—or ''case report''—is an intensive analysis of a person, group, or event that stresses developmental factors related to the context. Case studies may be descriptive or explanatory. Explanatory case studies explore causation to identify underlying principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Shepard| first = Jon| authorlink = Jon M. Shepard| author2 = Robert W.

Yin]]. ''Case Study Research: Design and Methods''. Fourth Edition. SAGE Publications. California, 2009. {{ISBN|978-1-4129-6099-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is a debate to whether case studies count as a [[Scientific method|scientific]] research method. [[Clinical psychology|Clinical psychologists]] use case studies most often, especially to describe [[Abnormal psychology|abnormal]] events and conditions, which are particularly important in [[clinical research]].&lt;ref name="Christensen"&gt;Christensen, L. B. (1994).“Experimental methodology"( 6th ed)., Simon &amp; Schuster: Needham Heights, MA. {{ISBN|978-0-205-15506-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sigmund Freud]] made extensive use of case studies to formulate his theory of [[psychoanalysis]].

Famous case studies include: [[Anna O.]] and [[Rat Man]] of Freud's [[Genie (feral child)|Genie]], who is one of the most severe cases of [[social isolation]] ever recorded,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Concise Encyclopedia of Special Education | editor1=Reynolds, Cecil R. |editor2=Fletcher-Janzen, Elaine | publisher=John Wiley and Sons | year=2004 | isbn=978-0-471-65251-9 | page=428 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V6CG5RzC2nkC&amp;pg=PA428}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Washoe (chimpanzee)|Washoe]], a [[chimpanzee]] who was the first non-human that had learned to communicate using [[American Sign Language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Livingston, John A.|chapter=other selves|editor1=Vitek, William |editor2=Jackson, Wes|title=Rooted in the land: essays on community and place|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1996|isbn=978-0-300-06961-7|page=133|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NZ3UfrZkSDsC&amp;pg=PA133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Surveys ===
{{Main article|Statistical survey}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;Interviews and questionnaires intrude as a foreign element into the
social setting they would describe, they create as well as measure atti-
tudes, they elicit atypical role and response, they are limited to those
who are accessible and who will cooperate, and the responses obtained
are produced in part by dimensions of individual differences irrelevant
to the topic at hand.&lt;small&gt; Webb ''et al''—Unobtrusive methods: Nonreactive research in the social science (1966).&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bradburn et al. (1979) found a tendency for survey respondents to over-
report socially desirable behaviours when interviewed using less anonymous methods.&lt;ref&gt;Norman M Bradburn et al ''Improving interview method and questionnaire design''. The University of California: Jossey-Bass, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychometric methods ===
Psychometrics is a field of study concerned with the theory and technique of psychological measurement. One part of the field is concerned with the objective measurement of skills and knowledge, abilities, attitudes, personality traits, and educational achievement.

=== Archival methods ===
Archival research can be defined as the study of existing data. The existing data is collected to answer research questions. Existing data sources may include statistical records, survey archives, and written records.

=== Cross-sectional methods ===
Cross-sectional research is a research method often used in developmental psychology, but also utilized in many other areas including social science and education. This type of study utilizes different groups of people who differ in the variable of interest, but share other characteristics such as socioeconomic status, educational background, and ethnicity.

For example, researchers studying developmental psychology might select groups of people who are remarkably similar in most areas, but differ only in age.

=== Longitudinal methods ===
Longitudinal research is a type of research method used to discover relationships between variables that are not related to various background variables. This observational research technique involves studying the same group of individuals over an extended period of time.

Data is first collected at the outset of the study, and may then be gathered repeatedly throughout the length of the study. In some cases, longitudinal studies can last several decades.

=== Cross-cultural methods ===
Cross-cultural psychology is a branch of psychology that looks at how cultural factors influence human behavior.

=== Cohort methods ===
Essentially, cohort refers to people who are approximately the same age. When researchers conduct different types of studies (for example, developmental/cross sectional studies), they use cohorts to see how people of different ages compare on some topic at one point in time. For example, a researcher may compare the effects of a new study aid in three different cohorts: 10th graders, 11th graders, and 12th graders. In this way, you can examine the study aid across three different grade levels.

=== Computational methods ===
A discipline lying on the border between artificial intelligence and psychology. It is concerned with building computer models of human cognitive processes and is based on an analogy between the human mind and computer programs. The brain and computer are viewed as general-purpose symbol-manipulation systems, capable of supporting software processes, but no analogy is drawn at a hardware level.

=== Unobtrusive methods ===
{{Main article|Unobtrusive research}}

The term ''unobtrusive measures'' was first coined by Eugene Webb, Campbell, Schwartz, and Sechrest in a 1966 book, ''Unobtrusive methods: Nonreactive research in the social science'',&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Webb, Eugene J. et al. ''Unobtrusive Measures: nonreactive research in the social sciences''. Chicago: Rand McNally, 1966&lt;/ref&gt; in which they described methods that don't involve direct induction of data from research subjects. For example, the evidence people leave behind as they traverse their physical environment is unobtrusive. Unobtrusive methods get around biases, such as the [[selection bias]] and the [[experimenter's bias#Social sciences|experimenter's bias]], that result from the researcher and his intrusion. Consequently, however, these methods reduce the researcher's control over the type of data collected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialresearchmethods.net/kb/unobtrus.php|title=Unobtrusive Measures|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Web and others regard these methods as an additional tools to use with the more common ''reactive'' and ''intrusive methods''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

'''SciVee''' &lt;ref&gt;http://www.scivee.tv scivee.tv&lt;/ref&gt; was a science [[video sharing website]] where [[researchers]] could upload, view and share science [[video clips]] and connect them to [[scientific literature]], posters and slides from 2007-2015. The SciVee website is partnered with three groups: The [[Public Library of Science]] (PLoS), a publisher of a series of [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] (OA) journals who have added content to the website, the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF), who provided seed funding to start the website, and the [[San Diego Supercomputer Center]] (SDSC), who houses SciVee's video servers and data for the website. The [[University of California, San Diego]]-based service uses [[Adobe Flash]] technology to display video combined with documents and imagery via SciVee's patent pending [[rich internet applications]] (RIA) or "virtual studio" [[WYSIWYG]] to combine, or “[[synchronize]]” them with a published scientific article from a scientific journal or poster from a scientific conference [[poster session]].  Any video synchronized with a published [[scientific article]] is called a “[[pubcast]],” while a video that is synchronized with a scientific conference session poster is called a “postercast.” Science videos that are not synchronized with a scientific article or poster can be uploaded and linked with supplementary files.

[[Research]] [[scientists]] are the primary audience for the website, but students of all levels, educators and the general public also use the site. Video content ranges from dense and highly technical explanations of [[scientific publications]] to elementary school level science. Unregistered users can watch the videos and use the provided embed code to [[vlog]] to videos into external websites, while registered users are permitted to upload an unlimited number of videos, synchronize scientific documents, add commentary to the site, create public profiles, and join or create communities. Registration is free and provides access to a full [[social networking service]] that allows registered members to interact with other members through private messaging, [[blogging]], and open community discussions.

==History==
With seed funding from [[National Science Foundation|NSF]], two professors from the University of California, Phil Bourne and Leo Chalupa, founded the website.  In early 2007, Phil and Leo put together a small team of people to create the [[Web 2.0]] website allowing [[Participatory culture|participation]] membership to a social science network with video and article upload.  SciVee was named by combining the words "science" and "video". After initial development, the website began accepting its first video uploads August 1, 2007. Nineteen days after going online in a pre-alpha test state, [[Slashdot]] dubbed SciVee the “YouTube for Science.”&lt;ref name="Malda"&gt;Malda, Rob (August 2007) YouTube for Science?, Available at http://science.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/08/19/1328253&lt;/ref&gt; The official alpha site launch took place September 1, 2007. Based on the feedback received from the initial boom of new members from being [[Slashdotted]], the SciVee team made updates to the website to accommodate customer demands and launched its beta release December 3, 2007. That day, [[CNN]]&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;CNN (December 2007) Scientists make videos for the Web. Available at: http://edition.cnn.com/2007/TECH/12/03/science.youtube.ap/&lt;/ref&gt; and [[USA Today]] featured articles about a video created by four UC San Diego science and film students showing "a typical recrystallization experiment straight out of Chemistry 101."&lt;ref name="USA Today"&gt;USA Today (December 2007) Niche sites spread science on the Web. Available at:https://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/2007-12-03-science-nice-sites_N.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, SciVee has added more features to the site including discussions, blogging, extended profiles and other community options.  On August 26, 2008, SciVee launched a new postercast capability.&lt;ref name="Zverina"&gt;Zverina, Jan. (August 26, 2008) "UC San Diego News Release: ‘SciVee’ Science Site Launches the Research Community’s First ‘Postercast’ Capability." Available at: http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/newsrel/supercomputer/08-08SciVee.asp&lt;/ref&gt; The same day, Paul Glazowski at [[Mashable]] referred to the release as "a new option for users to upload feature material in the form of “postercasts” that enable users to complement their traditional video presentations with an interactive documentation component. The synchronous delivery of these is remarkably user-friendly.".&lt;ref name="Glazowski"&gt;Glazowski, Paul. (August 26, 2008) "SciVee’s Science Videos Get More Interactive With Virtual Posters." Available at: http://mashable.com/2008/08/28/scivee-postercasts/&lt;/ref&gt; The site abruptly disappeared around the end of 2015.

==Beliefs &amp; Objectives==
[[Philip Bourne]] stated in his article in CTWatch Quarterly, Volume 3, Number 3, August 2007:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"We believe that the research community is ripe for a revolution in scientific communication and that the current generation of scientists will be the one to push it forward. These scientists, generally graduate students and new post-docs, have grown up with [[cyberinfrastructure]] as a part of their daily lives, not just a specialized aspect of their profession. They have a natural ability to do science in an electronic environment without the need for printed publications or static documents and, in fact, can feel quite limited by the traditional format of a publication. Perhaps most importantly, they appreciate that the sheer amount of data and the number of publications is prohibitive to the traditional methods of keeping current with the literature....To this end, we have developed SciVee, which allows authors to upload an article they have already published (open access, naturally) with a video or [[podcast]] presentation (about 10 minutes long) that they have made that describes the highlights of the paper. The author can then [[synchronize]] the video with the content of the article (text, figures, etc.) such that the relevant parts of the article appear as the author discusses them during the video presentation. We call the result a pubcast." &lt;ref name="Bourne"&gt;Bourne, P., Fink, L. "Reinventing Scholarly Communication for the Electronic Age," CTWatch Quarterly, Volume 3, Number 3, August 2007. Available at: http://www.ctwatch.org/quarterly/articles/2007/08/reinventing-scholarly-communication-for-the-electronic-age/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lynn Fink, SciVee's scientific developer, stated in her article submitted to [http://www.festrieste.it/eng_chisiamo.html FEST, the International Science Media Fair in Trieste]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Keeping current with the literature is a crucial part of doing science. It is, however, getting increasingly more difficult due to the growing number of articles that are published. SciVee aims to make this task easier and faster by delivering the key points of articles in an accessible and enjoyable medium – the pubcast: a short video of the author speaking about their published paper while the text of their paper is displayed next to the video. Prior to the open access movement, the creation of pubcasts would have been prohibitively difficult and readers would be forced to face a growing stack of articles to read. Fortunately, with pubcasts, readers can interact with several articles in the time it would take to read a single full article in the traditional way... We believe that the emergence of [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] literature is the spur that will drive innovation in scientific communication. In contrast to closed access literature, where publishers require a subscription to access content, articles that are published as open access are available for immediate viewing, download, and distribution. Furthermore, the author retains the copyright, rather than the publisher, under a [[Creative Commons license]] (usually CCAL 2.5 or 3.0) which grants the author much more freedom in the use of their own work. This license also grants considerable freedom to a consumer of this article. Specifically, the CCAL licenses under which most open access articles are published allow a consumer to "make and distribute derivative works, in any digital medium". SciVee takes full advantage of this by integrating the full text of the articles with web-based video... The traditional article format no longer effectively supports the research in the current age. We believe that taking advantage of open access articles in this way will have a significant impact on the scientific community. SciVee modernizes scientific publishing and communication by taking advantage of the possibilities the [[information age]] has to offer, namely widespread use of [[cyberinfrastructure]]. SciVee makes the process of creating and consuming scientific literature more enjoyable and accessible. We hope that scientific community will embrace these efforts and help make scientific communication."
more effective.&lt;ref name="Fink"&gt;Fink, L. &amp; Bailey, A. "SciVee: Making Your Research Known Through Web 2.0 Video" FEST Le Idee: MEDIA E SCIENZA, (April 2008) As of October 28, 2008 available at: http://www.festrieste.it/mediaescienza.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2707">In [[optimal control]], problems of '''singular control''' are problems that are difficult to solve because a straightforward application of [[Pontryagin's minimum principle]] fails to yield a complete solution.  Only a few such problems have been solved, such as [[Merton's portfolio problem]] in [[financial economics]] or [[trajectory optimization]] in aeronautics. A more technical explanation follows.

The most common difficulty in applying Pontryagin's principle arises when the Hamiltonian depends linearly on the control &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., is of the form: &lt;math&gt;H(u)=\phi(x,\lambda,t)u+\cdots&lt;/math&gt; and the control is restricted to being between an upper and a lower bound: &lt;math&gt;a\le u(t)\le b&lt;/math&gt;.  To minimize &lt;math&gt;H(u)&lt;/math&gt;, we need to make &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; as big or as small as possible, depending on the sign of &lt;math&gt;\phi(x,\lambda,t)&lt;/math&gt;, specifically:

: &lt;math&gt;u(t) = \begin{cases} b, &amp; \phi(x,\lambda,t)&lt;0 \\ ?, &amp; \phi(x,\lambda,t)=0 \\ a, &amp; \phi(x,\lambda,t)&gt;0.\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is positive at some times, negative at others and is only zero instantaneously, then the solution is straightforward and is a [[bang-bang control]] that switches from &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; at times when &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; switches from negative to positive.  

The case when &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; remains at zero for a finite length of time &lt;math&gt;t_1\le t\le t_2&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''singular control''' case.  Between &lt;math&gt;t_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t_2&lt;/math&gt; the maximization of the Hamiltonian with respect to &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; gives us no useful information and the solution in that time interval is going to have to be found from other considerations.  (One approach would be to repeatedly differentiate &lt;math&gt;\partial H/\partial u&lt;/math&gt; with respect to time until the control u again explicitly appears, which is guaranteed to happen eventually.  One can then set that expression to zero and solve for u.  This amounts to saying that between &lt;math&gt;t_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t_2&lt;/math&gt; the control &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is determined by the requirement that the singularity condition continues to hold.  The resulting so-called singular arc will be optimal if it satisfies the '''Kelley condition''':

:&lt;math&gt;(-1)^k \frac{\partial}{\partial u} \left[ {\left( \frac{d}{dt} \right)}^{2k} H_u  \right] \ge 0 ,\,  k=0,1,\cdots&lt;/math&gt;

.&lt;ref&gt;Bryson, Ho: Applied Optimal Control, Page 246&lt;/ref&gt;  This condition is also called the generalized [[Legendre-Clebsch condition]]).

The term '''bang-singular control''' refers to a control that has a bang-bang portion as well as a singular portion.

'''Spatial network analysis software''' packages are computer tools used to prepare various [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]-based analysis of [[spatial network]]s.  They stem from various research fields in transportation, architecture and urban planning. The earliest examples of spatial network analysis using computers include the work of Garrison (1962), Kansky (1963), Levin (1964), Harary (1969), Rittel (1967), Tabor (1970) and others in the 1960s and 70s. Various fields of study have later developed specific spatial analysis software to suit their needs, including TransCAD among transportation researchers, GIS among planners and geographers, Axman among Space Syntax researchers, and various plugins for other software platforms. The list below gives and overview of some of the available software. Many of these were developed in academia and are freely available or freely available for academic research.

In historical order:

* '''[http://www.spacesyntax.org/software/macbundle.asp Axman]''' The (near) original developed by Nick Sheep Dalton of [[University College London|UCL]] to perform axial line analysis on computers running [[Mac OS]], currently used in more than 50 countries.  This spawned many offshoots such as '''Pesh''' (for the analysis of convex space networks) and '''SpaceBox''' (for the analysis of 'all-line' axial maps).
* '''[http://undertow.arch.gatech.edu/homepages/jpeponis/Cities.htm Spatialist]'''  Developed at [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] to implement theoretical innovations principally introduced by John Peponis, this software is plugs into the [[MicroStation]] [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] package to analyse networks of automatically generated 'e-spaces' and 's-spaces'.
* '''[http://arcscripts.esri.com/details.asp?dbid=-2057687617 Axwoman 1.0]''', written by Bin Jiang while at UCL, is a tool to perform axial analysis as a plug-in to [[Environmental Systems Research Institute|ESRI]] products.
* '''[http://fromto.hig.se/~bjg/axwoman/ Axwoman 6.2]''', evolved from Axwoman 1.0 and many years of research by Bin Jiang and his team.

The software integrates CAD drawings with a diagram of flow between points.  The thickness and color of the flow lines indicate the intensity of flow in each line, so users can visually see high priority point to point relationships.  As the user moves locations in the diagram, the software dynamically calculates the impact on travel distance and users can immediately see the impact of the change on operations.  The software also allows for the creation of improved aisles and paths using the aisle effectiveness measurement and actual path diagramming.
* '''[http://cityform.mit.edu/projects/urban-network-analysis.html Urban Network Analysis Toolbox for ArcGIS]''' (free, open-source) Developed by the [http://cityform.mit.edu City Form Lab] at [http://sutd.edu.sg SUTD] and [http://web.mit.edu MIT]. The UNA Toolbox can be used to compute five types of graph centrality measures on spatial networks: Reach; Gravity; Betweenness; Closeness; and Straightness. The tools incorporate three important features that make them particularly suited for spatial analysis on urban street networks. First, they can account for both geometry and topology in the input networks, using either metric distance (e.g. Meters) or topological distance (e.g. Turns) as impedance factors in the analysis. Second, unlike previous software tools that operate with two network elements (nodes and edges), the UNA tools include a third network element – buildings – which are used as the spatial units of analysis for all measures. Two neighboring buildings on the same street segments can therefore obtain different accessibility results. And third, the UNA tools optionally allow buildings to be weighted according to their particular characteristics – more voluminous, more populated, or otherwise more important buildings can be specified to have a proportionately stronger effect on the analysis outcomes, yielding more accurate and reliable results to any of the specified measures. The toolbox is built for easy scaling – it is equally suited for small-scale, detailed network analysis of dense urban areas as it is for sparser large-scale regional networks.  The toolbox requires [http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/arcgis10/ ArcGIS 10] software with an [http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/extensions/networkanalyst/ ArcGIS Network Analyst Extension].
* '''[http://cityform.mit.edu/projects/una-rhino-toolbox Urban Network Analysis Plugin for Rhinoceros3D]''' (free for both academic and commercial use) Developed by the [http://cityform.mit.edu City Form Lab] at [http://sutd.edu.sg SUTD] and [http://web.mit.edu MIT]. The Rhino UNA Toolbox can be used to compute five types of graph centrality measures on spatial networks: Reach; Gravity; Betweenness; Closeness; and Straightness. The toolbox also include a series of other spatial analysis tools, such as Closest Facility, Alternative Routes finding, pedestrian flow modeling along shortest or redundant paths, facility patronage estimation, spatial distribution of origins weights along routes etc. The tool gives users full control to specify which origins and destinations to use in the analysis and allows the users to weight the analysis with specific attributes of each origin and destination. The UNA Rhino toolbox was developed in order to make spatial network analysis tools available to architects, designers and planners who do not have access to GIS and typically work on designs in Rhino. Having UNA metrics in Rhino, not only allows one to analyze how a specific spatial network performs, but to also incorporate the analysis into a fast and iterative design process, where networks can be designed, evaluated and redesigned in seamless cycles to rapidly improve the outcome.The UNA Rhino toolbox is significantly faster that its GIS counterpart, which has been available as a plugin for ArcGIS since 2012. Users also have an ability to rapidly create and edit networks from any Rhino curve objects, making network design and redesign simple and intuitive. The analytic options available to the user have expanded, giving you more precise control to analyze exactly what you need for every unique spatial network problem.The toolbox requires [https://www.rhino3d.com/download/rhino/5/latest Rhinoceros version 5] software with the latest updates (SR 10 or later). Help documentation for the UNA Rhino plugin is also available from the City Form Lab [https://www.dropbox.com/s/wqd2nfln87ghri5/20150301_UNA_Rhino3D_HELP.pdf?dl=0 website].
* '''[http://mekandizim.mersin.edu.tr/ SSA Plugin]''' by Burak Beyhan at the Mersin University, Turkey. Space Syntax Analysis (SSA) Plugin is operational on a series of Free and Open Source Software for GIS (FOSS4GIS) including OpenJUMP, gvSIG, OrbisGIS, [[QGIS]], OpenEV, Thuban, MapWindow GIS, SAGA, and also R Project. SSA Plugin calculates the standard space syntax measures including connectivity, total depth, mean depth, global integration, local depth, local integration and control values for each feature involved in a spatial configuration, and intelligibility value for the whole of the configuration. In addition to these parameters, users are also allowed to export adjusted graph created by the plugin to an external file in a Social Network Analysis (SNA) file format for further analysis of the spatial configuration concerned in the respective software environment.

It can generate [[isovist]]s and perform [[visibility graph analysis]] of building systems on computers running [[Mac OS X]], [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[Linux]], it includes automatic generation of axial line networks and analysis of axial line networks and road segment line networks. depthmapX is based on [[Qt framework]].
* '''[http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/sdna Spatial Design Network Analysis (sDNA 3D)]''' Since 2011, developed by Alain Chiaradia, Crispin Cooper and Chris Webster at Cardiff University and University of Hong Kong, (free) a tool aiming to unify the use of spatial network analysis in the disparate fields of design and research.  To this end, plugins are provided for '''Autocad''' (for designers), '''ArcGIS''', open source '''QGIS''' (for analysts &amp; designers) and a standalone Python version that works on 2D or 3D shapefiles enabling use in other GIS software and custom projects.  sDNA standardizes on the network link as a unit of analysis, and computes a wide variety of closeness, betweenness, severance and efficiency measures. sDNA works with '''3D topography''' and '''3D multilevel environment'''. Analyses and Radius can use Euclidean, angular, topological or custom distance metrics, and link, length or custom weightings. In Angular analysis mode sDNA computes cumulative angular change along the link and angular change at junction resulting in angular geodesic.

'''Timothy 'Tim' McCarthy''' (15 July 1888 – 16 March 1917) was an Irish [[able seaman]] (AB). He is best known for his service in the [[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition]] of 1914–1916, for which he was awarded the Bronze [[Polar Medal]].&lt;ref name="Obituary"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.enduranceobituaries.co.uk/mccarthy.htm |title=The Endurance Obituaries: Timothy F.

==Biography==
McCarthy was born on 15 July 1888 in [[Kinsale]], Ireland. He signed on the ''Endurance'' as an able seaman, and participated fully in the dangers and privations of the [[Weddell Sea]], particularly after the ''Endurance'' sank and the ship's company and shore party were marooned on a nearby [[Drift ice|ice floe]]. Later, the ship's company and shore party were forced to take to [[lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]]s, and the seamanship of the ABs became a decisive element in the survival of the entire company.&lt;ref name="Obituary"/&gt;

Expedition commander [[Ernest Shackleton]] was impressed by McCarthy's skill during the survival journey from the northern Weddell Sea to [[Elephant Island]], and so when the expedition leader decided to relaunch the best lifeboat into the open [[Southern Ocean]], with the goal of contacting potential rescuers in [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]], McCarthy was one of the five men he chose to accompany him. The sixteen-day [[voyage of the James Caird|voyage of the ''James Caird'']] in April–May 1916 became a classic story of human endurance, and the boat's navigator, [[Frank Worsley]], offered fervent and repeated praise to McCarthy for his services in keeping the boat afloat and helping to ensure the survival of the party.&lt;ref name="Obituary"/&gt;

When the ''James Caird'', in a sinking condition, made landfall on [[King Haakon Bay|South Georgia's uncharted southern coast]], two of the six men of the company were physically unfit for further service. Shackleton and his men turned over the boat and made it into a primitive shore shelter, which they called ''[[Peggotty Bluff|Peggotty Camp]]''. Three of the men—[[Tom Crean (explorer)|Tom Crean]], Worsley, and Shackleton himself—crossed the icy island to finalise the rescue, while the other three, the ageing carpenter [[Henry McNish]] and incapacitated seaman [[John Vincent (sailor)|John Vincent]], briefly remained at the camp under McCarthy's informal leadership. The island crossing was successful and the party was reunited after less than forty-eight hours. Soon McCarthy found himself heading northward. Having successfully participated in his own rescue, his part in the expedition was over.&lt;ref name="Obituary"/&gt;

Upon making landfall in the British Isles, McCarthy (who was not an [[Irish Nationalist]] and identified himself with the [[British Empire]]) found his country fighting [[World War I]]. He joined the [[Royal Navy Reserve]] as a [[leading seaman]]. In these duties he was assigned to man a deck gun on the [[SS Narragansett (oil tanker)|S.S. ''Narragansett'']], an [[oil tanker]]. On 16 March 1917, this vessel was [[torpedoed]] and sunk with all hands in the [[Western Approaches]]. McCarthy, aged 28, was the first member of the Weddell Sea party of the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition to die.&lt;ref name="Obituary"/&gt;

==Legacy==
In 1916–17, McCarthy was awarded the Polar Medal in bronze. [[McCarthy Island (South Georgia)|McCarthy Island]], a rocky island just off [[King Haakon Bay]] where the ''James Caird'' made landfall, was named in McCarthy's honour by the [[South Georgia Survey]] in the period 1951–1957. A joint bust of Tim McCarthy and his brother Morty McCarthy, also an Antarctic explorer, was unveiled in Kinsale in September 2000.&lt;ref name="Obituary"/&gt;

'''Zeppelin Observatory'''  (''Zeppelinobservatoriet'') is a [[research station]] in [[Svalbard]], [[Norway]]. It is located near the top of  [[Zeppelinfjellet]] above  [[Ny-Ålesund]] on the peninsula of [[Brøggerhalvøya]].   It is operated by the [[Norwegian Polar Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=    http://placenames.npolar.no/stadnamn/Zeppelinfjellet|title=  Zeppelinfjellet (Svalbard) |publisher =    Norsk Polarinstitutt |accessdate= October 1,  2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=    https://snl.no/Br%C3%B8ggerhalv%C3%B8ya|title=  Brøggerhalvøya|publisher =    Store norske leksikon |author=  Susan Barr

The  research station  at Zeppelinfjellet  was built between 1988-1989 and officially opened in 1990. After 10 years of use, it was determined that the building no longer covered the needs that were required to operate advanced instrumentation. In the second half of 1999, the old building was demolished and a new and improved station was built at the same site. The new station building was officially opened on 2 May 2000.
