[[File:Age of Consent - Central America.svg|thumb|300px|Age of consent laws in Central America]]
[[File:Age of Consent - Caribbean.svg|thumb|300px|Age of consent laws in the Caribbean]]

In North America, the legal age of consent relating to [[human sexual behavior|sexual activity]] varies by jurisdiction.

The [[age of consent]] in [[Canada]] is 16. As of August 2018, each [[U.S. state]] has set its age of consent at either age 16, age 17, or age 18.

The age of consent in [[Mexico]] is complex. Typically, Mexican states have a "primary" age of consent (which may be as low as&amp;nbsp;12), and sexual conduct with persons below that age is always illegal. Sexual relations which occur between adults and teenagers under 18 are left in a legal gray area: laws against [[corruption of minors]] as well as [[Ages of consent in North America#.22Estupro.22|estupro]] laws can be applied to such acts, at the discretion of the prosecution. These laws are situational and are subject to interpretation.

The ages of consent in the countries of [[Central America]] range from 14 to&amp;nbsp;18.

The below is a list of all jurisdictions in North America as listed in [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in North America]].

==Overview==
The age of consent is the age at or above which a person is considered to have the legal capacity to consent to sexual activity. Both partners must be of legal age to give consent, although exceptions to the age of consent law exist in some jurisdictions when the minor and his or her partner are within a certain number of years in age or when a minor is married to his/her partner. Persons below the age of consent may not, by law, give consent, and sexual relations involving such persons may be punished by criminal sanctions similar to those for rape or sexual assault. Non-violent sexual contact with persons under the age of consent may be punished with varying degrees of severity, ranging from a misdemeanor with a simple fine, to a felony with a punishment equivalent to rape.

Different ages may apply if one partner is in a position of power or authority over the other, such as a teacher, manager, coach, parent or stepparent. For example, in Indiana the age of consent is 16 but it is illegal for a person over 18 to have sex with anyone under 18 if they work at their school, are their parent or a stepparent, or are a person recruiting them to join the military.

Historically, the age of consent applied to male-female relationships; [[homosexuality|same-sex]] relationships were often illegal regardless of the ages of participants. Modern laws vary, and there may be multiple ages that apply in any jurisdiction. For instance, different ages may apply if the relationship is between partners of the same sex, or if the sexual contact is not strictly [[sexual intercourse|vaginal intercourse]].

==Antigua and Barbuda==
In [[Antigua and Barbuda]], the age of consent is 16.&lt;ref name="Murdoch"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.stlucianewsonline.com/caribbean-magistrate-says-do-not-tolerate-pre-consent-aged-teens-having-sex/ |title=CARIBBEAN: Magistrate says do not tolerate pre-consent aged teens having sex |last=Murdoch |first=Kieron |date=March 13, 2017 |work=St. Lucia News Online |access-date=2018-08-22 |language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Sexual Offences Act of 1995'' raised the age of consent from 14 to 16 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webapps01.un.org/vawdatabase/uploads/Antigua%20and%20Barbuda%20-%20Sexual%20Offences%20Act%201995.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=11 February 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303100737/http://webapps01.un.org/vawdatabase/uploads/Antigua%20and%20Barbuda%20-%20Sexual%20Offences%20Act%201995.pdf |archivedate=3 March 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/48c8ca0120.html |title=Refworld &amp;#124; 2003 Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor - Antigua and Barbuda |publisher=UNHCR |accessdate=16 February 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010174851/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/48c8ca0120.html |archivedate=10 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There exist two [[Age of consent#Close-in-age exemptions|close-in-age exemptions]], depending on the age of the younger partner. A youth of twelve or thirteen can consent to sexual activity with an individual less than two years older than they. A fourteen- or fifteen-year-old can consent to sexual activity with a partner who is less than five years older than they.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=SACC Website Team |url=http://www.sacc.to/sya/crime/law.htm |title=Sexual Assault Care Centre: Since You Asked: The Law - SACC provides emergency nurse, medical care, information thoughts feelings collect physical evidence help legal |publisher=Sacc.to |date= |accessdate=16 February 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110414194126/http://www.sacc.to/sya/crime/law.htm |archivedate=14 April 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Criminal law of Canada|Criminal law]] (including the definition of the age of consent) is in the exclusive jurisdiction of the [[Government of Canada|federal government]], so the age of consent is uniform throughout Canada. Section 151 of the Criminal Code of Canada makes it a crime to touch, for a sexual purpose, any person under the age of 16 years. Section 153 then goes on to prohibit the sexual touching of a person under 18 by a person in three circumstances: if he or she is in a "position of trust or authority" towards the youth, if the youth is in a "relationship of dependency" with him or her, or if the relationship is "exploitative". The term "position of trust or authority" is not defined in the Code but the courts have ruled that parents, teachers, and medical professionals hold a position of trust or authority towards youth they care for or teach. Section 153 (1.2) of the Code provides that a judge can infer whether or not a relationship is "exploitative" by considering its nature and circumstances including how old the youth is, the difference in ages between the partners, how the relationship evolved, and the degree of control or influence that the older partner has over the youth.

The "position of trust under 18" anti-exploitation rules were expanded in 2005 by [[Bill C-2]] where a judge may choose to term a situation to be sexual exploitation based on the nature and circumstances of the relationship including the age of the younger party, age difference, evolution of the relationship (how it developed, e.g. quickly and secretly over the Internet), the control or influence over the young person (degree of control or influence the other person had over the young person). This passed before the 2008 amendments, and they were not repealed so they are still in effect and can apply towards adults in these situations with young persons over the age of consent and under 18 (16-17).

Where an accused is charged with an offence under s. 151 (Sexual Interference), s. 152 (Invitation to sexual touching), s. 153(1) (Sexual exploitation), s. 160(3) (Bestiality in presence of or by child), or s. 173(2) (Indecent acts), or is charged with an offence under s. 271 (Sexual assault), s. 272 (Sexual assault with a weapon, threats to a third party, or causing bodily harm), or s. 273 (Aggravated sexual assault) in respect of a complainant under the age of sixteen years, it is not a defense that the complainant consented to the activity that forms the subject-matter of the charge.

===Anal intercourse in Canada===

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The punishment for anyone who had sexual intercourse with someone younger than 14 was [[life imprisonment]] and [[flagellation|whipping]], while the punishment for anyone who attempted to seduce an underage girl was two years' imprisonment and whipping.&lt;ref&gt;Social Laws of Canada and Ontario summarised for the use of Children's Aid Societies and Social Workers, 1914&lt;/ref&gt; Canada had also laws against "seducing" minor girls who were over the age of consent. In 1886, a law was enacted that made the "seduction" of a girl over 12 and under 16 "of previously chaste character" a criminal offence; the "seduction" of a female under 18 "under promise of marriage" was also made illegal in 1886, and amended in 1887 to apply to females under 21.&lt;ref name="dsp-psd.tpsgc.gc.ca"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dsp-psd.tpsgc.gc.ca/Collection-R/LoPBdP/BP/prb993-e.htm |title=Canada's legal age of consent to sexual activity (PRB 99-3E) |publisher=Dsp-psd.tpsgc.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=16 February 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706181827/http://dsp-psd.tpsgc.gc.ca/Collection-R/LoPBdP/BP/prb993-e.htm |archivedate=6 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the raising of the age of consent to 14, the laws against "seducing" minor girls were amended to apply to those older than 14, and various laws of this kind have remained in force through the 20th century.&lt;ref name="dsp-psd.tpsgc.gc.ca"/&gt; The age of consent was raised from 14 to 16 in the spring of 2008, when the ''Tackling Violent Crime Act'' became effective. The new measures still allow for close-in-age exceptions between 12 and 16: if there is no more than a two-year gap for those 12 and 13, or a five-year gap for those 14 and 15. Anal sex remains illegal with exceptions for those over 18, if they comply with the restrictions set out under section 159.

Female homosexuality was never illegal in the former British colonies; oral sex was legalized in 1969 with the same age of consent as vaginal sex. Also introduced in 1969 were the exceptions regarding criminal anal sex (effectively legalizing it), but with a higher age barrier set at 21, under section 159; in 1988, the age barrier for these exceptions was lowered to 18. As of 2008 there are no plans to repeal section 159, even though it has been ruled unconstitutional in some Canadian provinces.

Art. 169.- El que promoviere, facilitare, administrare, financiare, instigare u organizare de cualquier forma la utilización de personas menores de dieciocho años en actos sexuales o eróticos, de manera individual u organizada, de forma pública o privada, será sancionado con pena de tres a ocho años de prisión.

In [[Mexico]], criminal legislation is shared between the federal and state governments. The federal law establishes the age of 12 as the minimum age of consent, while the age at which there are no restrictions for consensual sexual activities is 18 (sex with someone 12-18 is not illegal ''per se'', but can still be open to prosecution under certain circumstances). Local state laws may override the federal law. In practice, the decision as to whether or not to prosecute is left to state authorities regardless of the younger person's age.
At state level, the minimum ages of consent vary between 12 (and puberty in a few states) and 15, while the age at which there are no restrictions for consensual sexual activities vary from 16 to 18 (most common 18).

==="Estupro"===
{{em|Estupro}} is a crime existing across Mexico, as well as in other Latin American jurisdictions. Although the definitions vary by state, it is usually defined as sexual conduct with a child who has reached the minimum age of consent but is under 18 (16 or 17 in some states) when the consent of the child is obtained by [[seduction]] and/or [[deceit]]. For instance the law of [[Aguascalientes]] reads: "''El estupro consiste en realizar cópula con persona mayor de doce y menor de dieciséis años de edad, obteniendo su consentimiento por medio de seducción o engaño''." (translation: Estupro consists in copulating with a person over twelve and under sixteen years old, obtaining his/her consent through seduction or deceit). Traditionally, estupro applied only to acts committed with a girl, and required "chastity" or "honesty" of the girl. The vast majority of Mexican states have modernized their laws by removing the requirement of "chastity" or "honesty" and by making the laws gender neutral. However, traditional laws still exist in some states: for instance, the law of [[Baja California]] reads: ''Al que realice cópula con mujer de catorce años de edad y menor de dieciocho, casta y honesta, obteniendo su consentimiento por medio de la seducción o el engaño'' (translation: "Whoever copulates with a chaste and honest female over fourteen and under eighteen years old, obtaining her consent through seduction or deceit"). Some states have removed the requirement of "chastity" or "honesty", but continue to define estupro as applicable only to girls. For instance, in [[Campeche]] the law states: ''Al que tenga cópula con mujer mayor de doce años pero menor de dieciocho, obteniendo su consentimiento por medio de la seducción o el engaño'' (translation: "Whoever copulates with a female over twelve and under eighteen years old, obtaining her consent through seduction or deceit"). The exact type of coercion that must be used varies by state, for example the Federal Law only makes reference to "deceit", omitting "seduction" (it reads: ''Al que tenga cópula con persona mayor de doce años y menor de dieciocho, obteniendo su consentimiento por medio de engaño'', translation: "Whoever copulates with a person over twelve and under eighteen years old, obtaining his/her consent through deceit").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vidasinviolencia.inmujeres.gob.mx/sites/default/files/pdfs/cuadros_delitos/ESTUPRO.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=10 November 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304035420/http://vidasinviolencia.inmujeres.gob.mx/sites/default/files/pdfs/cuadros_delitos/ESTUPRO.pdf |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.juridicas.unam.mx/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=10 November 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201082418/https://www.juridicas.unam.mx/ |archivedate=1 December 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Federal Law===
Article 261 of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20071122211538/http://www.diputados.gob.mx/LeyesBiblio/pdf/9.pdf Federal Criminal Code (PDF)] states that: ''"Whoever, without the purpose of reaching copulation, performs a sexual act in a person under 12 or in a person that has no capacity of understanding the meaning of the act or that for any reason cannot resist, or demands that the act is performed, will be punished with a term of 2 to 5 years in prison"''. If the offender uses moral or physical violence, an extra half term is added to the initial time.

Article 266 refers to the previous article 265, which covers the [[rape]] of adults in general and establishes a term of 8 to 14 years in prison for sex obtained through physical or moral violence. Article 266 then states that: ''"It is equivalent to rape and will be punished with the same penalty: (1st Clause) – who without violence performs a copulation with a person under 12"''. The 3rd Clause of this article punishes with the same penalties also "the vaginal or anal introduction of objects, without violence and with lascivious goals", in a person under 12 or in a person that has no capacity of understanding the meaning of the fact, or for any reason cannot resist. If any of the aforementioned acts is performed with physical or moral violence, the sentence is raised in up to a half.

A further article, 266 Bis, determines an extra penalty of up to a half under certain circumstances – (a) when there are multiple offenders; (b) when the offense is committed by a parent, legal guardian, stepfather or "companion" (''amasio'') of the mother; (c) when there is an abuse of [[authority]] of someone as a [[civil service|civil servant]]; (d) when the crime is committed by a person who has the minor under his or her [[child custody|custody]], guard or education, or yet through the abuse of trust.

There is another crime in Article 262 for consented sex with adolescents aged 12 to 18, when consent is obtained through [[deception|deceit]]. The penalty is 3 months to 4 years in prison. This crime, however, is prosecuted only through a [[complaint]] of the minor or his/her parents or legal guardians, as determined in Article 263.

Artículo 262 del Código Penal: " Al que tenga cópula con persona ''mayor de doce años y menor de
''dieciocho'', obteniendo su consentimiento por medio de ''engaño'', se le aplicará de tres meses a cuatro
años de prisión."&lt;ref name="interpol.int"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.interpol.int/Public/Children/SexualAbuse/NationalLaws/csaMexico.pdf |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20080229152211/http://www.interpol.int/Public/Children/SexualAbuse/NationalLaws/csaMexico.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=29 February 2008 |title=Microsoft Word - MEXICO TEMPLATE START.doc |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=16 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Translation'': Article 262: "Whoever copulates with a person over twelve and under eighteen years old, obtaining his/her consent through deceit"

Article 201 prohibits the "corruption" of a minor under 16.&lt;ref name="interpol.int"/&gt;

All Mexican states (as well as Mexico City) have [[corruption of minors]] statutes that can, upon complaint of the family (or minor), be used to punish sexual relations with persons under eighteen. Although actual prosecutions for violations of Corruption of Minors statutes (and age of consent statutes in general) tend to be sporadic, regional, and very situation dependent, many Mexican states nonetheless classify Corruption of Minors as a "Delito Grave" (Major Crime) in their penal codes.

Additionally, all the states have "Estupro" laws that can, upon complaint of the family (or minor), be used to prosecute adults who engage in sexual intercourse with minors by seduction or deceit (the exact definitions of this crime vary by state, see section [[Ages of consent in North America#.22Estupro.22|estupro]], above).

In some Mexican jurisdictions prosecutors have chosen to prosecute consensual sexual activity involving adults and underage minors only upon complaint by the minor, or a custodial complaint.

====Federal District====
The age of consent in the Federal District ([[Mexico City]]) is 12, one of the lowest in the world, and the overall criminal legislation of Mexico's capital is close to that of the federal law regarding this subject, although tougher in some aspects – higher penalties and broader definitions.

According to the ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20071122200502/http://www.diputados.gob.mx/LeyesBiblio/pdf/10.pdf Estatuto del Gobierno del Distrito Federal (PDF)(in Spanish)]'' (Government Statute of the Federal District), Article 42, Clause XII, the District's Legislative Assembly has powers to legislate in [[criminal law]].

Article 175 of the [http://www.unifr.ch/derechopenal/legislacion/mx/cp_mexicoNew4.pdf Federal District Criminal Code] refers to the previous Article 174, which stipulates a term of 6 to 17 years of prison for the [[rape]] of adults, while defining copulation as "the introduction of the penis in the human body through the vagina, anus or mouth". Article 175 (''violación'') then states that: "It is equivalent to rape and will be punished with the same penalty:" (first clause) – "who performs a copulation with a person under 12 years of age or with a person that has no [[Capacity (law)|capacity]] of understanding the meaning of the act or that for any reason cannot resist"; the second clause defines whosoever "introduces in the vagina or anus any element, instrument or any part of the human body different from the penis" as having committed the same crime, in relation to these same persons.

Article 177 covers "[[sexual abuse]]" and punishes other acts referred as "unintentional" acts –"who without purpose of reaching copulation, performs a sexual act with a person under 12 or a person that has no capacity of understanding the meaning of the act or that for any reason cannot resist it, or that demands that such act is observed or performed, will be punished with 2 to 7 years in prison".

In both Articles (175 and 177), there is an extra half term in case of physical or moral violence. And according to Article 178, there is also a punishment of an extra two thirds of the term under the same circumstances foreseen in Article 266 Bis of the Federal Law (see above), added by two new circumstances – (clause V) when the victim is inside a private vehicle or a [[public transport|public service vehicle]]; and (clause VI) when the crime is committed in a desert or isolated place.

There is a crime called ''estupro'' stipulated in Article 180, which refers to consented sex with adolescents aged 12 to 18, when consent is obtained through ''any means'' of [[deception|deceit]]. The penalty is 6 months to 4 years of prison. This crime needs a complaint (''querella'') to be prosecuted.

There is a Corruption of Minors statute (Article 184) that can be used to punish by imprisonment, for seven to twelve years, adults who engage in sexual relations with persons under eighteen. This situation exists all over Mexico, and can be prosecuted upon complaint of victim or the victim's family.

Unlawful sexual intercourse with girl under age of sixteen

121.(1) Subject to the provisions of the section, a man who has unlawful
sexual intercourse with a girl above the age of thirteen and under the age of
sixteen shall be guilty of an offence and liable to imprisonment for two

(2) It is immaterial in the case of a charge for an offence under this
section that the intercourse was had with the consent of the girl concerned.

122.(1) Subject to the provisions of this section, any man who makes an
indecent assault on a woman shall be guilty of an offence and liable— (...)

(2) A girl under the age of sixteen years cannot in law give consent
which would prevent an act being an assault for the purposes of this

==Nicaragua==
In [[Nicaragua]], the age of consent is 18, although, in regard to young people 16-17, the law (Article 175) is not clear cut.

Article 170. Statutory rape&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/crc/docs/CRC.C.OPSC.NIC.1.doc |title=1040903 |work=googleusercontent.com |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402081146/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/crc/docs/CRC.C.OPSC.NIC.1.doc |archivedate=2 April 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anyone who is married or in a stable de facto union ''or who is of age'' and who, ''without violence or intimidation'', has or allows carnal access with a person aged between 14 and 16 shall be sentenced to imprisonment for a period of two to four years.

Article 175. Sexual exploitation, pornography and paid sexual acts with adolescents

Anyone who ''induces, provides, promotes or uses persons aged under 16'' or a disabled person ''for sexual or erotic purposes'', forcing them to witness or participate in an act or show in public or in private, ''even if the victim consents'' to witness or participate in such an act, shall be sentenced to imprisonment for a period of five to seven years, or four to six years if the victim is aged ''between 16 and 18''.

(...)

Article 168. Rape of children under the age of 14

Article 172. Sexual abuse

Anyone who engages in lewd acts with or improper touching of another person, without their consent, (...)

==Panama==
In [[Panama]], the age of consent is in general 18, although sexual conduct with children aged 14 to 18 is not always illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ministeriopublico.gob.pa/minpub/Portals/0/Pdfs/Prensa/CODIGO%20PENAL%20-%20AJUSTADO.pdf |accessdate=22 March 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509065526/http://www.ministeriopublico.gob.pa/minpub/Portals/0/Pdfs/Prensa/CODIGO%20PENAL%20-%20AJUSTADO.pdf |archivedate=9 May 2016 |df=dmy |title=Texto Único del Código Penal de la República de Panamá }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sint Maarten (Netherlands)==
The age of consent in [[Sint Maarten]] is 15, as specified by the Criminal Code of the [[Netherlands Antilles]] (which Sint Maarten did not change after the [[dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles]]), Articles 251, which reads:

Art 251: 1. "A person who, out of wedlock, with a person who has reached {{em|the age of twelve but has not reached fifteen}}, performs indecent acts comprising or including sexual penetration of the body is liable to a term of imprisonment of not more than sixteen years".&lt;ref name="decentrale.regelgeving.overheid.nl"/&gt;

The ''Children Act, 2012'' defines a "child" as "a person under the age of eighteen years".

18. Subject to section 20, a person who sexually penetrates a child commits an offence and is liable on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for life.

19. (1) Subject to section 20, where a person touches a child and–
(a) the touching is sexual; and
(b) the child is under sixteen years of age,
the person commits an offence.

(2) A person who commits an offence under subsection (1) is liable–
(a) on summary conviction, to a fine of fifty thousand dollars and to imprisonment for ten years; or
(b) on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for twenty years.
(3) Where a person commits an offence under subsection (1), and the touching involves the placing of any body part or of an object onto the penis or bodily orifice of a child, that person is liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for life.

Three close-in-age exemptions exist, as per section 20:

20. (1) A person sixteen years of age or over but under twenty-one years of age is not liable under section 18 if–
(a) he is less than three years older than the child against whom he is purported to have perpetrated the offence;
(b) he is not in a familial relationship with the child nor in a position of trust in relation to the child;
(c) he is not of the same sex as the child; and
(d) the circumstances do not reveal any element of exploitation, coercion, threat, deception, grooming or manipulation in the relationship.

(2) A person fourteen years of age or over but under sixteen years of age is not liable under section 18 or 19 if–
(a) he is less than two years older than the child against whom he is purported to have perpetrated the offence;
(b) he is not in a familial relationship with the
child nor in a position of trust in relation to
the child;
(c) he is not of the same sex as the child; and
(d) the circumstances do not reveal any
element of exploitation, coercion, threat,
deception, grooming or manipulation in the
relationship.

(3) A person twelve years of age or over but under fourteen years of age is not liable under section 18 or 19 if–
(a) he is less than two years older than the child against whom he is purported to have perpetrated the offence;
(b) he is not in a familial relationship with the child nor in a position of trust in relation to the child;
(c) he is not of the same sex as the child; and

==United States==
[[File:Ages of Consent - United States.svg|thumb|General ages of consent in the 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and the inhabited U.S. territories]]
{{main article|Ages of consent in the United States}}
In the [[United States]], the age of consent laws are made at the state, [[Territories of the United States#Classification of current U.S. territories|territorial]], and [[Washington D.C.|federal district]] levels. There exist several [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] statutes related to protecting minors from sexual predators, but none of them imposes an age limit on sexual acts. On 26 June 2003, both heterosexual and homosexual sodomy became legal in all U.S. states, territories, and the District of Columbia under the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] decision ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/pdf/02-102P.ZO |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2 November 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161115013016/https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/pdf/02-102P.ZO |archivedate=15 November 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; (between non-commercial, consenting adults in a private bedroom). In ''[[State v. Limon]]'' (2005), the [[Kansas Supreme Court]] used ''Lawrence'' as a precedent to overturn the state's "Romeo and Juliet" law, which proscribed lesser penalties for heterosexuals than homosexuals convicted of similar age of consent related offenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kscourts.org/cases-and-opinions/opinions/supct/2005/20051021/85898.htm |title=85898 - State v.

Each U.S. state has its own age of consent, as does the District of Columbia. As of August 1, 2018, the age of consent in each state in the United States was either 16 years of age, 17 years of age, or 18 years of age. The most common age of consent is 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Age of Consent across the United States |url = https://www.ageofconsent.net/states|work = AgeOfConsent.net|access-date = 2018-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Virgin Islands (United States)==
{{see also|Ages of consent in the United States}}
The age of consent is 18. There is however a close-in-age exemption that allows minors 16 and 17 years old to consent with someone no more than five years older than themselves and minors 13 to 15 years old to consent with one another, but not with anyone 16 or over.

Article § 1700. ''Aggravated rape in the first degree'' bans sexual intercourse or sodomy with a child under 13. Sexual acts with minors are aggravated by the use of force, intimidation, or the perpetrator's position of authority, and by the fact that the minor, being under 16 and not the perpetrator's spouse, is residing in the same household as the perpetrator.(see Article § 1700, Article § 1702,  Article § 1708).

Other relevant articles of the criminal code are:

*§ 1702. Rape in the second degree
(a)  Any person over 18 years of age who perpetrates under circumstances not amounting to rape in the first degree, an act of sexual intercourse or sodomy with a person not the perpetrator's spouse who is at least 16 years but less than 18 years of age, and the perpetrator is 5 years or older than the victim, is guilty of rape in the second degree and shall be imprisoned not more than 10 years.

*§ 1703. Rape in the third degree
Any person under 18 years of age but over 16 years of age who perpetrates an act of sexual intercourse or sodomy with a person not the perpetrator's spouse who is under 16 years of age but over 13 years of age, under circumstances not amounting to rape in the first degree, is guilty of rape in the third degree and shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Family Division of the Superior Court

"Sexual contact", that is, non-penetrative sex, defined as "the intentional touching of a person's intimate parts, whether directly or through clothing, to arouse or to gratify the sexual desires of any person" is not permitted with children under 16, but a close-in-age exemption allows those aged at least 13 to engage in such acts with partners under 18.

*§ 1708. Unlawful sexual contact in the first degree
A person who engages in sexual contact with a person not the perpetrator's spouse—
(..)(2) when the other person is under thirteen years of age;

*§ 1709. Unlawful sexual contact in the second degree
A person over eighteen years of age who engages in sexual contact with a person not the perpetrator's spouse who is over thirteen but under sixteen years of age is guilty of unlawful sexual contact in the second degree and shall be imprisoned not more than 1 year

The '''Aizi''' (Aïzi, Ahizi, Ezibo) speak three languages around [[Ébrié Lagoon]] in Ivory Coast.

Two of the languages are [[Kru languages|Kru]]. They are divergent enough for intelligibility to be difficult:
*[[Tiagba language|Lélé]] ''(Lélémrin),'' also known as Tiagba ''(Tiagbamrin)'' after its principal town
*[[Mobu language|Mobu]] ''(Mobumrin)''

It was long assumed that the third ethnically Aizi language, [[Apro language|Apro]] ("Aproumu"), was Kru as well. However, now that it has been documented, Apro is classified as a [[Kwa languages|Kwa]] language.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Boone, Silué Lamine, MaryAnne Augustin.

The '''Beboid languages''' constitute a branch, or branches, of [[Southern Bantoid]] and are spoken principally in southwest [[Cameroon]], although two languages (Bukwen and Mashi) are spoken over the border in [[Nigeria]]. The Eastern Beboid languages may be most closely related to the [[Tivoid languages|Tivoid]] and [[Momo languages|Momo]] groups, though Western Beboid, if it's a group at all, may be closer to [[Ekoid]] and [[Bantu languages|Bantu]].

Previous research includes a study of [[noun classes]] in Beboid languages by [[Jean-Marie Hombert]] (1980), [[Larry Hyman]] (1980, 1981), a dissertation by Richards (1991) concerning the [[phonology]] of three eastern Beboid languages (Noni, Ncane and Nsari), Lux (2003) a Noni lexicon and Cox (2005) a phonology of [[Kemezung]].

==Languages==
[[SIL International]] survey reports have provided more detail on Eastern and Western Beboid (Brye &amp; Brye 2002, 2004; Hamm et al. 2002) and Hamm (2002) is a brief overview of the group as a whole.

Eastern Beboid is clearly valid; speakers recognise the relationship between their languages, their distribution is the result of recent population movements and linguistically they are similar. Western Beboid, on the other hand, is dubious; they appear to have more to do with [[Grassfields languages]], and there does not appear to be much to link them together, though it remains a working hypothesis (Good, 2009).

Blench (2011) classifies Eastern and Western Beboid as separate branches of Southern Bantoid.

;Eastern: [[Cung language|Cung]], [[Bebe language|Bebe]]–[[Kemezung language|Kemezung]], [[Naki language|Naki]], [[Saari language|Saari]]–[[Noni language|Noni]] (Ncane-Mungong-Noone)

;Western ?:
:[[Abar language|Abar]]
:[[Fang language (Cameroon)|Fang]]
:[[Koshin language|Koshin]]
:[[Mundabli language|Mundabli]]: Mundabli, Bu
:[[Mbu’ language|Mbu’]] (the least similar)

They were the group that first introduced [[Islam in South Africa|Islam to South Africa]]. By the 19th century, the term was used to describe anyone at the Cape who was a practicing Muslim, irrespective of ethnic background. As such, most Cape Malays were actually from Madagascar and East Africa, shipped to the Cape as slaves from the end of the 18th century, who converted upon arrival.&lt;ref name="Shell1994"&gt;{{cite book|last=Shell|first=Robert Carl-Heinz |title=Children of Bondage: A Social History of the Slave Society at the Cape of Good Hope, 1652-1838|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hjsiAAAACAAJ|year=1994|publisher=University Press of New England|isbn=978-1-86814-275-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
The Cape Malay identity can be considered the product of a set of histories and communities as much as it is a definition of an ethnic group. Since many Cape Malay people have found their Muslim identity to be more salient than their "Malay" ancestry, people in one situation have been described as "Cape Malay", or "Malays" and in another as '''Cape Muslim''' by people both inside and outside of the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://v1.sahistory.org.za/pages/artsmediaculture/culture%20&amp;%20heritage/cultural-groups/cape_malay.htm |title=Cape Malay &amp;#124; South African History Online |publisher=V1.sahistory.org.za |date= |accessdate=2013-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004013814/http://v1.sahistory.org.za/pages/artsmediaculture/culture%20%26%20heritage/cultural-groups/cape_malay.htm |archivedate=4 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, over time, the original Indonesian slaves intermarried with various other groups, including other slaves from [[South Asia|South]]&lt;ref name = "IndianSlavesANC"/&gt; and [[Southeast Asia]], [[Madagascar]], and native [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]] groups.

The "Cape Malay" identity was also a subcategory of the "[[Coloured]]" category, in the terms of the [[apartheid]]-era government's classifications of ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heritage.thetimes.co.za/memorials/wc/RaceClassificationBoard/article.aspx?id=591128|title=Race Classification Board: An appalling 'science'|publisher=Heritage.thetimes.co.za|date=2007|accessdate=12 May 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120423220247/http://heritage.thetimes.co.za/memorials/wc/RaceClassificationBoard/article.aspx?id=591128|archivedate=23 April 2012|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leach1987"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leach|first=Graham|title=South Africa: no easy path to peace|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-RkOAQAAMAAJ|year=1987|publisher=Methuen paperback|isbn=978-0-413-15330-2|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term ''Malay'' may have originated from the [[Kristang language|Malayo-Portuguese language]] that was a [[lingua franca]] in many Asian ports.&lt;ref name = "IndianSlavesANC"/&gt;

==Culture==
[[File:Cape Malay samosas.jpg|thumb|Cape Malay samosas, a Cape Malay traditional dish that witnessed a South Asian influence. The Indian influence in the Cape Malay culture is essential due to generations of widespread intermarriage and union between the two communities.]]
The founders of this community were the first to bring Islam to South Africa. The community's culture and traditions have also left an impact that is felt to this day. The Muslim community in Cape Town remains large and vibrant. It has expanded greatly beyond those exiles who started the first mosques in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/archive/history-muslims-south-africa-1652-1699-ebrahim-mahomed-mahida|title=History of Muslims in South Africa: 1652 - 1699 by Ebrahim Mahomed Mahida|last=tinashe|date=2012-01-13|work=South African History Online|access-date=2017-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.maraisburg.co.za/2010/10/23/history-of-muslims-in-south-africa/|title=History of Muslims in South Africa|website=www.maraisburg.co.za|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Malay Choir Competition.jpg|thumb|left|Malay Choir Competition.]]
People in the Cape Malay community generally speak mostly [[Afrikaans]] but also English, or local dialects of the two. They no longer speak the [[Malay language]]s and other languages which their ancestors used, although various Malay words and phrases are still employed in daily usage.

Adaptations of traditional foods such as ''[[Tomato bredie|bredie]]'', ''[[bobotie]]'', ''[[sosatie]]s'' and ''[[koeksister]]s''  are staples in many South African homes. [[Faldela Williams]] wrote three cookbooks, including ''The Cape Malay Cookbook'', which became instrumental in preserving the cultural traditions of Cape Malay cuisine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jackman|first1=Rebecca|title=Cape Malay Cooking Guru Faldela Williams Dies at 62|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-369408457.html|accessdate=13 November 2016|publisher=''[[Cape Times]]''|date=28 May 2014|location=Cape Town, South Africa|subscription=yes|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lewis|first1=Esther|title=Faldela Williams lives on in cookbook|url=http://www.iol.co.za/lifestyle/food-drink/food/faldela-williams-lives-on-in-cookbook-1694676|publisher=[[Independent Online (South Africa)|IOL]]|location=Johannesburg, South Africa|date=27 May 2014|accessdate=13 November 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161113191344/http://www.iol.co.za/lifestyle/food-drink/food/faldela-williams-lives-on-in-cookbook-1694676|archivedate=13 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This cultural group developed a characteristic 'Cape Malay' music. An interesting secular folk song type, of Dutch origin, is termed the ''nederlandslied''. The language and musical style of this genre reflects the history of South African slavery; it is often described and perceived as 'sad' and 'emotional' in content and context. The ''nederlandslied'' shows the influence of the Arabesque (ornamented) style of singing. This style is unique in South Africa, Africa and probably in the world.{{Citation needed|reason=Apr 2009|date=March 2009}}

Cape Malay music has been of great interest to academics, historians, musicologists, writers and even politicians. The well-known annual [[Cape Town Minstrel]] or Carnival street festival is a deep-rooted Cape Malay cultural event; it incorporates the Cape Malay comic song or ''moppie'' (often also referred to as ''ghoema'' songs). The barrel-shaped drum, called the 'ghoema', is also closely associated with Cape Malay music.

==Demographics==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}

[[File:Bo Kaaps colorful houses.JPG|thumb|240px|Bo-Kaap, Cape Town's Malay Quarter.]]

It is estimated that there are about 166,000 people in Cape Town who could be described as Cape Malay, and about 10,000 in [[Johannesburg]]. The picturesque Malay Quarter of Cape Town is found on [[Signal Hill (Cape Town)|Signal Hill]], and is called the ''[[Bo-Kaap]]''.

Many Cape Malay people also lived in [[District Six]] before they, among many other South African people of diverse ethnicity, were forcefully removed from their homes by the apartheid government and redistributed into [[township (South Africa)|townships]] on the [[Cape Flats]].

==International relationship==
Connections between Malaysians and South Africans took up when South Africa rejoined the international community. The latter's re-entry was welcomed by Malaysian government and many others in the Southeast Asian region. Non-governmental organisations, such as the Federation of Malaysia Writers' Associations, have since set on linking up with the diasporic Cape Malay
community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haron|first=Muhammed|format=PDF|url=http://www.ukm.my/penerbit/sari/SARI23-05/sari23%5B04%5D.pdf|title=Gapena and the Cape Malays: Initiating Connections, Constructing Images|journal=SARI: Jurnal Alam dan Tamadun Melayu|publisher=Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia|volume=23|year=2005|pages=47–66|accessdate=28 November 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161129144103/http://www.ukm.my/penerbit/sari/SARI23-05/sari23%5B04%5D.pdf|archivedate=29 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also an increase in the interest of the food, culture and heritage of Cape Malay descendants around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cape Malay Samosas with Mint-Cilantro Dipping Sauce|url=http://www.meyerfoodblog.com/2017/01/03/cape-malay-samoosas-mint-cilantro-dipping/|website=MeyerFoodBlog|accessdate=2 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[political ecology]] and [[environmental policy]], '''climate governance''' is the diplomacy, mechanisms and response measures "aimed at steering social systems towards preventing, mitigating or adapting to the risks posed by [[climate change]]".&lt;ref name=Jagers2003&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jagers|first=S.C.|author2=Stripple, J.|title=Climate Governance beyond the State|journal=Global Governance|year=2003|volume=9|issue=3|pages=385–400}}&lt;/ref&gt; A definitive interpretation is complicated by the wide range of political and social science traditions (including [[comparative politics]], [[political economy]] and [[multilevel governance]]) that are engaged in conceiving and analysing climate governance at different levels and across different arenas. In academia, climate governance has become the concern of [[geographers]], [[anthropologists]], [[economists]] and [[business studies]] scholars.&lt;ref name=Bulkeley2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bulkeley|first=H.|title=Climate Policy and Governance: an editorial essay|journal=Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Climate Change|year=2010|volume=1|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past two decades a paradox has arisen between rising awareness about the causes and consequences of [[climate change]] and an increasing concern that the issues that surround it represent an intractable problem.&lt;ref name=Bulkeley2009&gt;{{cite book|last=Bulkeley,H.|first=Newell, P.|title=Governing Climate Change|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Initially, climate change was approached as a [[global issue]], and climate governance sought to address it on the international stage. This took the form of [[Multilateral Environmental Agreement]]s (MEAs), beginning with the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) in 1992. With the exception of the [[Kyoto Protocol]], [[international agreements]] between nations have been largely ineffective in achieving legally binding emissions cuts&lt;ref name="Andonova, L. B., Betsill, M. M. &amp; Bulkeley, H 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Andonova, L. B., Betsill, M. M. &amp; Bulkeley, H|title=Transnational climate governance|journal=Global Environmental Politics|year=2009|volume=9|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with the end of the Kyoto Protocol's first commitment period in 2012, starting from 2013 there is no legally binding [[Global climate regime]]. This inertia on the international political stage contributed to alternative political narratives that called for more flexible, cost effective and participatory approaches to addressing the multifarious problems of climate change.&lt;ref name=Backstrand2007&gt;{{cite book|last=Bäckstrand, K. &amp; Lövbrand, E. in Pettenger, M.

==Background==

The development of climate governance can be traced firstly to climate diplomacy between inter-state actors and secondly to the development of transnational networks and non-state actors. The timeline above highlights key points throughout this process.  The point of ‘creation’ is difficult to determine exactly, however a definitive point in its history is the 1992 [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) in Rio. This has been termed “the first major milestone in the history of climate diplomacy”.&lt;ref name="Bulkeley, H. &amp; Newell, P. 2009 22"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bulkeley, H.  |author2=Newell, P.|title=Governing climate change|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conference addressed nations from across the globe and sought to emulate the diplomatic success of the Montreal Protocol in phasing out ozone-depleting chemicals.&lt;ref name="Bulkeley, H. &amp; Newell, P. 2009 22"/&gt;

As climate governance has continued to develop on the international stage, a string of transnational public and public-private actor networks have sought to implement its aims within their own arena, for example the [[Large Cities Climate Leadership Group|C40]], the [http://www.wmsc2010.org/list-of-cities/ Global Cities Covenant on Climate] (also known as the 'Mexico City Pact'), and the [[Cities for Climate Protection Programme]] (CCPP). The [[United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]] (UNFCED) in 1992 was a 'trigger' for this process. Existing regional and local networks adopted its emissions reduction targets and began to consider how they could be achieved at a local level. An example is [[ICLEI|ICLEI ‘Local Governments for Sustainability’]] that adopted the convention's [[Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) as part of its commitment to link local action to internationally agreed-upon goals.&lt;ref name=ICLEI2011&gt;{{cite web|last=ICLEI ‘Local Governments for Sustainability’|title=AboutICLEI|url=http://www.iclei.org/index.php?id=about|accessdate=15 May}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the umbrella of internationally agreed climate targets, innovative climate governance methods have also developed that seek to reduce emissions using market based mechanisms, for example the [[emissions trading|'cap and trade']] mechanism.

Thus, while the interstate process of treaty making continues to play a key part in mitigating anthropogenic climate change, it now exists as part of a wider tapestry of private and public climate governance initiatives that operate at multiple scales.&lt;ref name=Bernstein2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bernstein, S., Betsill, M., Hoffmann, M. &amp; Paterson, M.|title=A tale of two Copenhagens: Carbon markets and climate governance|journal=Millennium-Journal of International Studies|year=2010|volume=39|issue=1|pages=161–173|doi=10.1177/0305829810372480}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==North-South divide==

The [[North-South divide]] is a [[socio-economic]] and [[political]] division. Applied to climate governance, the divide separates 'developed' northern countries that have historically emitted disproportionately high emissions from 'undeveloped' southern countries that have emitted considerably less emissions.&lt;ref name="Bulkeley, H. &amp; Newell, P. 2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bulkeley, H.  |author2=Newell, P.|title=Governing climate change|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; The divide has also been used to highlight differences in vulnerability to climate change (the global south is considered more vulnerable due to a higher incident of natural disasters, less developed infrastructure and less wealth).&lt;ref name="Bulkeley, H. &amp; Newell, P. 2009"/&gt; These divides have fed into all issues of international climate governance, bringing with them questions of [[social justice]] and equity that remain current today.&lt;ref name="Bulkeley, H. &amp; Newell, P. 2009"/&gt; A criticism of the divide is that it simplifies an increasingly complex landscape. In recent years, international trade, free capital flows and the development of some southern nations (for example [[China]] and [[India]]) have redefined global socio-economic and political relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jean-Philippe Therien|title=Beyond the North-South divide: The two tales of world poverty|journal=Third World Quarterly|year=2009|volume=20|issue=4|doi=10.1080/01436599913523 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate Governance ‘in perspective'==

Climate governance has been identified as multi-scale, multi-actor and deeply embedded in our social and physical infrastructure:&lt;ref name="Bulkeley, H. &amp; Newell, P. 2009"/&gt;

*'''Multiple scale:''' Climate governance takes place and has policies enacted across diverse levels and spaces at each scale of governance. This includes [[supranational]], [[nation]]al, [[regional]] and [[local government|local]] scales. The interaction between these arenas raises important questions about where the power and authority for governing climate change lie.&lt;ref name="Bulkeley, H. &amp; Newell, P. 2009"/&gt; Traditional interpretations of ‘top down’ authority do not necessarily apply in the realm of climate governance which exhibits a far more complex landscape. Local initiatives can be networked horizontally, for example the [[Large Cities Climate Leadership Group|C40]], while some national interests feed back into international agreements.&lt;ref name="Bulkeley2010"/&gt;
*'''Multi actor:''' The fragmented and blurred roles of state and non-state actors raises ambiguities concerning their relative roles in the realm of climate governance.&lt;ref name="Bulkeley2010"/&gt; Non-state actors play critical roles in shaping the positions adopted by national governments in relation to international climate agreements, for example the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol.&lt;ref name="Bulkeley2010"/&gt; These actors include scientific, business, lobbyists and community actors. Until the late 1990s, their influence was considered to be ‘latent’, existing outside common governance arenas. More recently, that role has been reassessed as private actors offer new sites and mechanisms that seek to address climate change.&lt;ref name="Bulkeley2010"/&gt;
*'''Embedded''': The involvement of non-state actors in climate governance is partly a reflection upon the deeply embedded social and economic nature of many of the processes that lead to [[Greenhouse gas emissions|Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions]].&lt;ref name="Bulkeley, H. &amp; Newell, P. 2009"/&gt; The difficulties in addressing climate change are compounded by the complex range of processes that involve GHG emissions across the planet at all scales.&lt;ref name="Bulkeley2010"/&gt; Furthermore, decisions reached in other domains, including trade, energy security and employment inevitably impact on the efforts of climate governance to address anthropogenic climate change.&lt;ref name="Bulkeley2010"/&gt;

==Role of science==

Particular scientific and technical practices shape and inform our understanding of climate change and in doing so define how environmental problems are defined as objects of governance. For example, recent advances in [[carbon cycle]] research, [[remote sensing]] and [[carbon accounting]] techniques have revealed that [[tropical deforestation]] accounts for 15% of global [[carbon dioxide emissions]].&lt;ref name="Boyd, W. 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boyd, W.|title=Ways of seeing in environmental law: how deforestation became an object of climate governance|journal=Ecology Law Quarterly|year=2010|volume=37|pages=843–857}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, it has become a viable concern of climate governance. Previous to its quantification, tropical deforestation had been expressly excluded from the Kyoto Protocol.&lt;ref name="Boyd, W. 2010"/&gt; However, the translation of scientific or policy research findings into governance through the political process remains difficult as science and politics have very different ways of dealing with the issue of uncertainty that is naturally a component of research&lt;ref&gt;Hammer, M.; Peet, J.; Vincken, M. (2009): Coping with uncertainty. Accountability challenges in global climate governance, One World Trust Briefing paper number 123, December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Community engagement in climate governance==

[[Community engagement]] plays an important role in the implementation of climate governance policy. There are two main reasons for this. First, where climate governance necessitates change at a behavioural level, there is a need to educate the public in order to achieve this (for example reducing car travel). Where successful, this offers the possibility that communities can become [[self governing]], for example choosing to drive less.&lt;ref name="Bulkeley2010"/&gt;
Second, effective community engagement ensures that climate governance policies are relevant to the communities in which they are intended to be applied. This necessitates a process of ‘bottom up learning’, as ideas are passed up from a local to national level. This approach has been identified as the normative framework of  ‘learning organisations’ &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Power, G., Maury, M. &amp; Maury, S.|title=Operationalising bottom-up learning in international NGOs: Barriers and alternatives|journal=Development in Practice|year=2002|volume=12|issue=3|pages=272–284|doi=10.1080/0961450220149663}}&lt;/ref&gt; and popular within environmental organisations that seek to encourage grassroots development &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Roper, L.  |author2=J. Pettit|title=Development and the Learning Organisation: An Introduction|journal=Development in Practice|year=2002|volume=12|issue=3/4|pages=258–271|doi=10.1080/0961450220149654}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Market Based Climate Governance==

The history of climate governance has seen increasing emphasis placed on market based solutions, or “flexibility mechanisms”.&lt;ref name="Bulkeley2010"/&gt; This is a development that complements, rather than replaces traditional ‘command and control’ regulation. The decision to favour market mechanisms has been identified as inevitable given the growth in popularity of [[neoliberalism]] over the past two decades.&lt;ref name="Bulkeley, H. &amp; Newell, P. 2009"/&gt; Thus, targets set at international climate governance conventions have been achieved through the application of markets (for example the [[European ETS|EU-ETS]]), [[public-private partnerships]] (for example “type II partnerships”) and the self-regulation of industry (for example the [http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTOGMC/EXTGGFR/0,,menuPK:578075~pagePK:64168427~piPK:64168435~theSitePK:578069,00.html Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership]).

Significantly, the Kyoto Protocol offers participating countries three market based mechanisms as means to meeting their binding emissions reduction targets. These are '[[emissions trading]]' (known as “the carbon market"), 'the [[clean development mechanism]]' (CDM) and '[[joint implementation]]' (JI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=UNFCCC|title=The  Kyoto Protocol|url=http://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol/items/2830.php|publisher=United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three Kyoto market mechanisms have been identified as forms of carbon market governance, a market based form of climate governance. Carbon market governance allows carbon emissions in one place to be exchanged with emissions reductions in another.&lt;ref name="Biermann, F., Pattberg, P. &amp; Zelli, F. 2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Biermann, F., Pattberg, P. &amp; Zelli, F.|title=Global climate governance beyond 2012: architecture, agency and adaptation|year=2010|publisher=Cambridge Univ Pr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It relies on measuring, monitoring and verification techniques to commensurate carbon, allowing seemingly disparate activities to appear on the same balance sheet.&lt;ref name="Biermann, F., Pattberg, P. &amp; Zelli, F. 2010"/&gt;

The largest working example of carbon market governance to date is the [[European Union Emission Trading Scheme|EU-ETS]]. It is a multinational [[emissions trading]] scheme. Advocates of this mechanism cite its focus on improving efficiency, reducing carbon where it is most cost efficient to do so. Its critics identify that it has so far allowed participating industries to profit from excess carbon credits while having little or no effect on their carbon emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sandbag|title=Sandbag ETS S.O.S: Why the flagship 'EU Emissions Trading Policy' needs rescuing|url=http://www.sandbag.org.uk/site_media/pdfs/reports/Sandbag_ETS_SOS_Report.pdf|accessdate=15 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The view of climate governance stakeholders that climate action was a costly burden has somehow changed in recent years: According to the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate, up to 90% of the actions required to get onto a 2°C pathway would be compatible with the goals of boosting national development, equitable growth and broadly shared improvements in living standards.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tänzler et. al|first=Dennis|year=2015|title=Catalyzing the Climate Economy|url=https://library.ecc-platform.org/file/2162/download?token=90f6h_Bj|journal=Climate Diplomacy Brief|volume=|pages=7|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three phenomena are behind this cost-benefit analysis: First, "negative [[Marginal abatement cost|cost abatement]]" means that curbing emissions reduces overall costs (e.g. energy savings). Second, economies of scale and learning-by-doing innovation potentially lead to falling costs over time. Third, so-called "co-benefits"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/146590200|title=Climate Diplomacy - Co-Benefits of Climate Change Policy - Sample1|website=Vimeo|access-date=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as health benefits through less air pollution or livelihood security through land restoration can be beneficial for individual countries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;   

==Transnational networks of climate governance==

In addition to the efforts of nation-states to coordinate internationally on matters of climate governance, nation-states, non-state actors and private actors are becoming increasingly involved in multiple parallel climate governance partnerships on a global scale.&lt;ref name="Bulkeley2010"/&gt; These actors include [[cities]], [[regions]], [[NGOs]] and [[corporations]]. Their increasingly prominent involvement has led scholars to reassess the nature of power in climate governance as well as the relationship between public and private authority &lt;ref name="Bulkeley2010"/&gt;

To distinguish between types of climate governance networks currently in existence, it is useful to separate components into sub-categories. Studies into climate governance have distinguished between modes of governance&lt;ref name="Bailey, I 2007 431–442"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bailey, I|title=Neoliberalism, climate governance and the scalar politics of EU emissions trading|journal=Area|year=2007|volume=39|issue=4|pages=431–442|doi=10.1111/j.1475-4762.2007.00770.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; (self-governing, governing through enabling, governing by provision and governing by authority), types of actors and political scale of governance.&lt;ref name="Bailey, I 2007 431–442"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Betsill, M. M.  |author2=H. Bulkeley|title=Cities and the multilevel governance of global climate change|journal=lobal Governance: A Review of Multilateralism and International Organizations|year=2006|volume=12|issue=2|pages=141–159}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the purpose of this section they are separated according to the type of actors involved – ‘public climate governance partnerships’, ‘public-private climate governance’ partnerships and ‘private climate governance partnerships’. 'Modes of governance' and ‘scale’ (e.g. [[supranational]], [[Central government|national]], [[regional]], and [[local government|local]]) represent equally viable alternatives to this categorisation. While none of these approaches are definitive (each approach exhibits overlaps), defining partnerships according to participating actor is here considered to draw the clearer distinction.

==='Public' climate governance partnerships===

*'''[[Multilateral Environmental Agreement]]s (MEA's):''' MEA's can take the form of non-legally binding declarations, or legally binding treaties. Treaties between nations include framework conventions like the [[Rio Declaration]] on Environment and Development, signed at the 1992 [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC). There are four main criticisms of MEAs.  First, their policies have been weakened by successive compromises between bargaining nations.&lt;ref name="James Evans 2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=James Evans|title=Environmental Governance|year=2011|publisher=Routledge|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, where one nation refuses to participate (as occurred with the United States withdrawal from [[Kyoto Protocol|Kyoto]]), they can still benefit from measures taken by participating nations  (for example measures to reduce their [[GHG emissions]]), even though they have not had to take action themselves &lt;ref name="James Evans 2011"/&gt; Third, developing country governments lack the capacity to shape and influence negotiating processes, giving developed countries disproportionate power to influence proceedings .&lt;ref name="Bulkeley2010"/&gt; Fourth, the number of countries involved in international meetings inevitably leads to conflicts of interest between nations that can make it difficult to reach legally binding agreements.&lt;ref name="James Evans 2011"/&gt;
* '''Global city and regional partnerships''': Beyond the local scale, the success of urban climate governance depends on horizontal and vertical collaboration between regions and cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Alber, G.  |author2=K. Kern|title=Governing climate change in cities: modes of urban climate governance in multi-level systems|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/54/63/42545036.pdf|accessdate=15 May}}&lt;/ref&gt; Global city and regional partnerships have been identified as showing particular promise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Pattberg, P.  |author2=J. Stripple|title=Beyond the public and private divide: remapping transnatio  nal climate governance in the 21st century|journal=International Environmental Agreements: Politics, Law and Economics|year=2008|volume=8|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; These can be built into public non-state networks, for example the [[Large Cities Climate Leadership Group|C40]] network, the [http://www.wmsc2010.org/list-of-cities/ Global Cities Covenant on Climate], the [[Cities for Climate Protection Programme]] (CCPP) and the [[International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives]]. Through these  networks, [[mitigation of global warming|mitigation]] measures and [[adaptation]] strategies can be adopted by participating cities worldwide. A criticism of global city and regional partnerships is that their exclusive nature limits influence to participating cities and regions which risks drawing resources away from less powerful city and regional actors.

===‘Public-private’ climate governance partnerships===

* '''Type II Partnerships''': Type II Partnerships are public-private initiatives between public, private and civic organisations that are the outcome of international treaties. The ‘type II’ label serves to contrast them against ‘type I’ partnerships which are the multilateral agreements that more traditionally arise from international treaties. An example of a Type II partnership is the (approximately) 300 partnerships upon which the [[World Summit on Sustainable Development]] in 2002 was based.
* '''Vertical ‘[[supply chain]]’ public-private partnerships''': These are partnerships that seek to implement internationally agreed outcomes such as the [[Millennium Development Goals]] through supply chain partnerships. This is achieved firstly by facilitating and coordinating interaction between private stakeholders and secondly through constructive engagement between public and private stakeholders  regarding the development and delivery of government [[policies]], [[regulations]], programmes and schemes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Energy Efficiency Partnership for Homes|title=What We Do|url=http://www.eeph.org.uk/what-we-do/|accessdate=14 May}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the [http://www.eeph.org.uk/what-we-do/ Energy Efficiency Partnership for Homes] in the UK.

===='Private' climate governance partnerships====

* '''Self regulating private networks''': In recent years, transnational corporations have established partnerships through private networks in a variety of schemes that encourage self-regulation of industry.&lt;ref name="Pattberg, P. and O. Enechi 2009 76–98"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Pattberg, P.  |author2=O. Enechi|title=The business of transnational climate governance: legitimate, accountable, and transparent|journal=St Antony's International Review|year=2009|volume=5|issue=1|pages=76–98}}&lt;/ref&gt; These partnerships are often coordinated by [[NGOs]] and funded by government.&lt;ref name="James Evans 2011"/&gt; Existing networks include the [http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTOGMC/EXTGGFR/0,,menuPK:578075~pagePK:64168427~piPK:64168435~theSitePK:578069,00.html Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership] and the [[Carbon Disclosure Project]]. Both of these evidence the importance of NGOs in bringing market actors into the realm of environmental climate governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Pattberg, P.  |author2=J. Stripple|title=Beyond the public and  private divide: remapping transnational climate governance in the 21st century|journal=International Environmental Agreements: Politics, Law and Economics|year=2008|volume=8|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-regulating private networks have been identified as having the potential to lead to behavioural change that could lead to successful global climate governance.&lt;ref name="Pattberg, P. and O. Enechi 2009 76–98"/&gt; At present however, the networks themselves remain largely unregulated and have been criticised for lacking legitimacy, accountability and transparency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Pattberg, P.  |author2=J. Stripple|title=Beyond the public and private divide: remapping transnational climate governance in the 21st century|journal=International Environmental Agreements: Politics, Law and Economics|year=2008|volume=8|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The use of adaptive governance in climate governance ==
A relatively new approach to governing climate impacts upon social systems is to use the flexible technique of adaptive governance, introduced by [[C. S. Holling|Holling]] in 1978 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Holling|first=CS|title=Adaptive environmental assessment and management|year=1978|publisher=Chichester|pages=377}}&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to the more mitigation-focused approaches which have generally dominated efforts thus far. Adaptive governance “refers to the ways in which institutional arrangements evolve to satisfy the needs and desires of the community in a changing environment”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hatfield-Dodds|first=Steve |author2=Nelson, Rohan |author3=Cook, David C|title=Adaptive Governance: An introduction, and implications for public policy|journal=Anzsee conference paper|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Several theorists believe that it is within a society’s capacity to adapt to the gradual climate changes we are experiencing currently, and those felt in the future.&lt;ref name="Young and Lipton"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Young|first=Kenneth. R|author2=Lipton, Jennifer. K|title=Adaptive governance and climate change in the tropical highlands of Western South America|journal=Climate Change|year=2006|volume=78|issue=1|pages=63–102|doi=10.1007/s10584-006-9091-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, utilizing adaptive governance is perhaps the ideal solution as its experimental approach allows newly created institutions to “experiment with different solutions and learn from them in order to adapt and transform".&lt;ref name="James Evans"&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=James|title=Environmental Governance|year=2011|publisher=Unpublished}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The role of these institutions is to then formulate policies to strengthen the resilience between complex climate and social systems, and therefore the system’s ability to adapt and remain stable in the face of climate changes in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tompkins|first=Emma. L|author2=Adger, Neil|title=Does adaptive governance of natural resources enhance resilience to climate change?|journal=Ecology and Society|year=2004|volume=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, institutions encourage communication between different levels of power (local, regional, national and international) to govern resources, whilst also engaging a broad set of stakeholders e.g. [[Non-governmental organization|NGO’s]] and the public.&lt;ref name="James Evans" /&gt;  Therefore, the approach takes a predominantly ‘bottom up’ strategy, focusing on community-based actions.&lt;ref name="Brunner and Lynch"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Brunner, Ronald  |author2=Lynch, Amanda|title=Adaptive governance and climate change|year=2010|publisher=American Meteorological Society|pages=424}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of climate change this provides an alternative to the ‘top down’ [[IPCC]] proceedings and world negotiations, which many perceive as having no effect in addressing climate issues.&lt;ref name="Brunner and Lynch" /&gt;

Adaptive governance has been successfully implemented in a number of local society’s around the world in building their ability to adapt to climate change associated impacts such as extreme weather&lt;ref name="Brunner and Lynch" /&gt; and altering plant biodiversities.&lt;ref name="Young and Lipton" /&gt;  Success has mainly been attributed to the fact that through adaptive governance, the social impact is dealt with locally to achieve a more effective result&lt;ref name="Brunner and Lynch" /&gt;  whilst still allowing communication to flow between low to high levels of command. For example, Brunner &amp; Lynch in 2010 studied how the Barrow community in Alaska successfully communicated with local and regional governments to develop adaptive strategies for minimizing extreme weather impacts.&lt;ref name="Brunner and Lynch" /&gt;

===Critique===
Several limitations have arisen when applying the adaptive governance strategy to climate governance. Firstly, when applied at local level, adaptive governance is evidently successful; however, Evans (2011) found problems when applying such techniques over a large scale.&lt;ref name="James Evans" /&gt; For example, the technique could have limited success when adapting to a national or international problem as the system may become too complex. A further weakness highlighted by [[Elinor Ostrom|Ostrom]] in 2007 is that many adaptive governance systems have been implemented to build resilience to gradual changes but anthropogenic climate change could cause rapid alterations and so challenge the robustness of the whole governance system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ostrom|first=Elinor|title=Sustainable social-ecological systems:an impossibility?|journal=Social Science Research Network|year=2007|volume=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Folke|first=Carl |author2=Hahn T |author3=Olsson P |author4=Norberg J |title=Adaptive governance of social-ecological systems|journal=Annual Review of Environment and Resources|year=2005|volume=9|issue=2|pages=441–473}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, using this experimental approach for such a precarious and influential system as our climate has been considered too risky, especially as Earth is potentially nearing the 2 degree global warming [[Tipping point (climatology)|tipping point]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=IPCC AR4 WG2|first=Parry, M.L.; Canziani, O.F.; Palutikof, J.P.; van der Linden, P.J.; and Hanson, C.E., ed|title=Climate Change 2007: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability, Contribution of Working Group II to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK and New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even with these limitations, adaptive governance is evidently a successful strategy at local scale in addressing unique climate change impacts on social systems. Therefore, the idea of focusing on and monitoring localized problems to achieve a global goal may well be highly influential as the impacts of climate change become increasingly widespread and complex.

==Future climate governance==
It is said with some imprecision by some popular observers that the core commitments of the [[Kyoto Protocol]] expire in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=UNFCCC|title=The Kyoto Protocol|url=http://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol/items/2830.php|accessdate=19 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; More precisely, the first commitment period for Annex B Parties (commonly known as Annex 1 Parties) to the Kyoto Protocol run from 2008 to 2012 inclusive, with a carbon accounting truing up period that may run for some time after 2012. The other obligations of parties to the Kyoto Protocol are not time limited in the way that the First Commitment Period QELEROs of Annex B Parties are. While the more recent [[Copenhagen Accord]] endorses these commitments, it does not commit signatory countries to agree on a binding successor. Future global consensus will require the respective roles of developed and developing countries to be determined according to their relative responsibilities and capabilities. Furthermore, all participating countries will need to agree that resultant legal architecture is fair and therefore acceptable.&lt;ref name="Biermann, F.Pattberg, P.Zelli, F"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Biermann, F.Pattberg |author2=P.Zelli, F. |title=Global climate governance beyond 2012: architecture, agency and adaptation|publisher=Cambridge Univ Pr|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; A key limitation in achieving this is the refusal of the United States to commit to legally binding negotiations. The re-engagement of the United States in this field has been cited as a potential future "trigger" that could lead to multilateral legally binding emissions reductions in GHG emissions.&lt;ref name="Biermann, F.Pattberg, P.Zelli, F"/&gt;

Movement at a national level could also stimulate multilateral negotiations as some countries look set to press ahead with legally binding emissions cuts. On 17 May 2011, the UK Government introduced the Fourth Carbon Budget which aims to "set an ambitious target in law to reduce greenhouse gas emissions . . . and build momentum toward a legally global climate change deal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fourth Carbon Budget: Oral Ministerial Statement (Chris Huhne).|url=http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/news/cb_oms/cb_oms.aspx|accessdate=19 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the absence of a [[Global Climate Regime|multilateral emissions reduction agreement]], the future direction of climate governance remains uncertain.&lt;ref name="Bernstein2010"/&gt; Supranational and national legislation could legislate the continuation of market based emissions reduction mechanisms, for example the [[European Union Emission Trading Scheme|EU-ETS]]. The increased agency of non-state actors in the realm of global governance and the growth of public and public-private networks offer the potential for the global climate arena to develop at a sub-national level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Pattberg, P.  |author2=Enechi, O.|title=The business of transnational climate governance: legitimate, accountable, and transparent?|journal=St Antony's International Review|year=2009|volume=5|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent attempts to 'territorialise' the carbon cycle seek to frame climate change as a local rather than global problem by rearticulating the global carbon cycle as a combination of national 'sinks'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stripple, Johannes|title=The climate as political space: On territorialisation of the global carbon cycle|journal=Review of International Studies|year=2006|volume=32|pages=217–235|doi=10.1017/s0260210506006991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [http://www.oneworldtrust.org/climategovernance emerging research direction is focusing on the institutional accountabilities and capability for change involved in effective global climate governance], from a perspective of individual organisations involved, as well as systemic responsiveness to people most affected by climate change&lt;ref&gt;Hammer, M.; Mayhew, S.; Cumming, L.; van Belle, S.

{{Political corruption sidebar|image=[[File:Flag of Tajikistan.svg|150 px]]}}'''Corruption in Tajikistan''' is a widespread phenomenon that is found in all spheres of [[Tajikistan|Tajik]] society. The situation is essentially similar to that in the other former [[Soviet republics]] of [[Central Asia]]. Reliable specifics about [[corruption]] can be difficult to come by, however, as can hard information about the effectiveness of supposed anti-corruption initiatives.&lt;ref name=transp&gt;{{cite web| title =Overview of corruption and anti-corruption in Tajikistan | work =Transparency International| url =http://www.transparency.org/files/content/corruptionqas/356_Overview_of_Corruption_in_Tajikistan.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corruption, according to a 2015 article in ''[[The Diplomat]]'', is present in every aspect of Tajikistan's culture. Examples include students paying bribes for better grades, bribes for the release of prisoners, and “smugglers tipping border guards to look the other way” as well as many others.&lt;ref name=transp/&gt;&lt;ref name=diplo&gt;{{cite web| last =Putz| first =Catherine| title =Nepotism: Not the Kind of Corruption Tajikistan is Looking For| work =The Diplomat| date =15 Jun 2015| url =http://thediplomat.com/2015/06/nepotism-not-the-kind-of-corruption-tajikistan-is-looking-for/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Freedom House]] said much the same thing in 2016, calling corruption a problem affecting every aspect of Tajik society.&lt;ref name=free&gt;{{cite web| title =Tajikistan| work =Freedom House| url =https://freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/NIT2016_Tajikistan.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Transparency International]], citizens of Tajikistan consider government bureaucrats and services to be the most corrupt institutions, with police, customs, and tax-collection authorities at the top of the list, followed by college and hospital administrators.&lt;ref name=transp/&gt; In a 2010 survey, Tajikistanis said they were most likely to be confronted with bribery during dealings with the traffic police (53.6%), followed closely by land purchases (53.3%) and dealings with universities (45.4%). Almost two-thirds believed that the level of corruption in the country was high and unlikely to change soon; about half thought that most officials take bribes; and about half viewed corruption negatively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Corruption in Tajikistan: Public Opinion. 2010.| work =United Nations Development Programme | url =http://www.tj.undp.org/content/tajikistan/en/home/library/democratic_governance/Corruption_in_Tajikistan.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transparency International's 2017 Corruption Perception Index ranks the country 161st place out of 180 countries&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2017|title=Corruption Perception Index 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Tajikistan gained independence in 1991, when the [[Soviet Union]] collapsed, and the ensuing [[Tajikistani Civil War|civil war]], waged from 1992 to 1997, left the people largely apathetic and passive in the face of government authority. Landlocked and poor in [[natural resources]], Tajikistan remains the poorest and least developed of the former Soviet republics, with half of the [[Extreme poverty|inhabitants living on less than 2 USD a day]]. Many Tajiks have emigrated to [[Russia]] or [[Kazakhstan]], and the large amounts of money they send back home make Tajikistan one of the more [[remittance]]-dependent countries on earth. There are, moreover, major problems with [[organized crime]], [[drug trafficking]], [[religious extremism]], and [[drug abuse]].&lt;ref name=transp/&gt;

==Scale of corruption==
The 2012 [[Corruption Perception Index]], published by Transparency International, gave Tajikistan a  score of 22 out of 100, placing it in 157th place out of 176. Several of its neighbors received similar scores: [[Pakistan]] (27), [[Uzbekistan]] (17), [[Turkmenistan]] (17), and [[Kyrgyzstan]] (24). [[Afghanistan]] did considerably worse, scoring only 8 points.&lt;ref name=transp/&gt;

Tajikistan received a score of 9 out of 100, for control of corruption on the [[World Bank]]’s 2009 [[Worldwide Governance Indicators]] (WGI). This score represented a drop from 18 in 2007.&lt;ref name=transp/&gt;

===Perceptions===
In a 2010 survey by the [[United Nations Development Programme]], almost 80% of respondents said their country was corrupt.&lt;ref name=transp/&gt;

==Government corruption==
[[File:Emomali Rahmon with Obamas.jpg|225 px|right|thumb|President Emomali Rakhmon with President Barack Obama and wife Michelle Obama]]
Tajikistan is not considered a free country; [[Freedom House]] has called the country's multi-party system a "democratic façade."&lt;ref name=transp/&gt; Government employees and officials often extort money from citizens, especially from civil servants. For instance, some public employees were required to buy shares in the [[Rogun Dam]] in order to keep their jobs.&lt;ref name=transp/&gt;

Owing to corruption, incompetence, and a lack of public resources and facilities, the country's government administration is highly inefficient, and bribery is common. Farmers and entrepreneurs in particular have to deal with corrupt officials on a regular basis.&lt;ref name=transp/&gt;

The current regime is awash in [[patronage]], [[cronyism]], and self-enrichment. Political and economic power is concentrated the hands of the family of [[Emomali Rakhmon]], president since 1992. The government has ties to organized crime and accountability is rarely present.&lt;ref name=transp/&gt;

[[United States diplomatic cables leak|U.S. diplomatic cables leaked in 2010]] noted that members of Rakhmon's family and inner circle are widely viewed as being the most corrupt people in the country. An example of the problem of nepotism at the highest level is Rakhmon's son [[Rustam Emomali]], who by his mid-20s had already been a member the [[Dushanbe]] city council, head of the [[Tajikistan Football Federation]], owner of a major football club, head of the Customs Service, and head of the country's anti-corruption agency.&lt;ref name=diplo/&gt; In January 2017, Rustam Emomali was appointed Mayor of Dushanbe, a key position, which is seen by some analysts as the next step to the top of the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thepoliticon.net/analytics/275-tajikistan-regime-eternalization-completed.html|title=Tajikistan: regime eternalization completed?|last=|first=|date=26 January 2017|website=The Politicon|publisher=The Politicon|access-date=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the president made his daughter [[Ozoda Rahmon|Ozoda Emomali]] as the deputy minister of foreign affairs in 2009, and five years later appointed her as first deputy minister. Her husband, Jamoliddin Nuraliyev, became first deputy finance minister in 2008 and a deputy chairman of the [[National Bank of Tajikistan|National Bank]] in 2015.&lt;ref name=free/&gt;

Generally speaking, details of government budgets are not made available to the public. Government officials and high-level employees are required by law to disclose their assets, but their declarations are never audited.&lt;ref name=transp/&gt;

Corrupt Tajik officials have siphoned billions of dollars from state-owned banks and enterprises into offshore accounts. According to the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], about $3.5 billion, or more than a third of the country's annual [[GDP]], has ended up in such accounts. The state-run [[Tajik Aluminum Company|Talco aluminum smelter]] is owned by [[British Virgin Islands]]-based firms, and its revenue, instead of being returned to the state budget, has been used as a slush fund for Tajik officials.&lt;ref name=free/&gt;

===Elections===
Elections are characterized by massive fraud, and members of [[List of political parties in Tajikistan|opposition parties]] are routinely bought off, threatened, exiled, or imprisoned.&lt;ref name=transp/&gt; While the law limits donations allowed to be made to political parties from a person and candidates, the financial accounts of parties and politicians are not audited.&lt;ref name=transp/&gt;

===Judiciary===
Although the judiciary is nominally [[Independence of the judiciary|independent]], in practice it is under the control of the president, who has the power to hire and fire judges at will. President Rakhmon's power over the courts has intensified over time. Judges are widely viewed as incompetent, and many of them solicit illegal payments in order to settle cases or release inmates from prison. Conflicts of interests in legal cases are common, with no safeguards readily available.&lt;ref name=transp/&gt;

===Impunity===
The degree to which corrupt leaders in Tajikistan enjoy [[impunity]] is reflected in the case of Muradali Alimardon. Despite being found in 2009 to have made $550 million in illicit loans to family-related projects, Alimardon was promoted from National Bank chairman to deputy prime minister, after which, according to ''[[The Economist]]'', he took a $120 million more in unauthorized loans from state-owned [[Agroinvestbank]].&lt;ref name=free/&gt;

==Police==
Police officers, especially traffic police, are viewed as being highly corrupt. In particular, they are seen as catering to elites, who are virtually immune from arrest and prosecution, rather than serving citizens. Police salaries, moreover, are low, and officers routinely solicit bribes to supplement their incomes. Many members of the police force also collaborate with organized criminals, notably drug smugglers.&lt;ref name=transp/&gt; As of 2012, about a third of Tajikistan’s GDP came from [[heroin]] trafficking, which, according to the [[U.S. State Department]], occurs with the aid of law enforcement and government officials.&lt;ref name=free/&gt;

==Business==
Business executives in Tajikistan, according to the [[World Economic Forum]]’s 2013 [[Global Competitiveness Report]], view corruption as the fourth largest obstacle to business in Tajikistan, behind tax rates, government regulations, and poor access to financing.&lt;ref name=transp/&gt; In 2015, Tajikistan ranked at 166th out of 189 countries on the World Bank’s [[Ease of doing business index|Ease of Doing Business]] ranking place, placing it at the bottom of the Europe and Central Asia region.&lt;ref name=diplo/&gt; According to a 2008 World Bank survey, over 44% of business people say they were expected to present civil servants with “gifts,” and over a third had  experienced bribery demands during the previous year.&lt;ref name=transp/&gt;

==Healthcare==
Health workers are generally not well paid, and rely on gifts and bribes to supplement their income. Many citizens must pay bribes in order to receive supposedly free medical care or to secure a hospital bed.&lt;ref name=transp/&gt;

==Universities==
As a rule, young people must pay sizeable bribes to get into universities and receive better grades.&lt;ref name=transp/&gt;

==Anti-corruption activities==
U.S. diplomatic cables written in 2006 and 2007 and leaked in 2010 called “anti-corruption” a new buzzword in Tajikistan, but suggested that there was little substance to the government's purported efforts on this front.&lt;ref name=diplo/&gt; A law passed in 2008 professes to set in place strong safeguards and to protect [[whistleblowers]], but in practice corruption continues to flourish.&lt;ref name=transp/&gt; Similarly, another law professes to guarantee access to government information, but in practice it is difficult for most citizens to gain such access. The Office of the Human Rights Ombudsman was established in 2008, but the government and judiciary pay little heed to complaints submitted to it. Although the Ombudsman is nominally independent, he is personally appointed by the president and can be replaced by him.&lt;ref name=transp/&gt;

There are laws supposedly requiring transparency in political party financing, but they tend to be ineffective. Other laws require that announcements and tenders be published and that public procurement officials declare their assets, but they are not properly enforced.&lt;ref name=transp/&gt;

The Anti-Corruption Network (ACN) for Eastern Europe and Central Asia was founded by the [[OECD]], [[European Union]], and several banking and business organizations in 1998 to support anti-corruption efforts in the region. In 2003, the ACN launched an initiative which involves producing country reviews for Tajikistan and seven other countries. Tajikistan has been a member of the [[United Nations Convention against Corruption]] (UNCAC) since 2006. Since 2012, the OSCE's Tajikistan office has contained a Good Governance Unit, which seeks to work with the government to fight corruption. Also, Tajikistan is one of four countries in the region chosen by the World Bank to test its Country Governance and Anti-Corruption process.&lt;ref name=transp/&gt;

The ineffectiveness of purported anti-corruption efforts is reflected in the fact that the nation's agency for the state's control of its budget and opposing corruption is generally viewed as one of the country's most corrupt institutions. Most of those who are prosecuted for corruption by the agency are employed in the lower rungs of the civil service, with the bulk of prosecutions occurring in the health, education, and agriculture sectors.&lt;ref name=transp/&gt; This agency, formed in 2007, is under Rakhmon's control, not parliament's, guaranteeing that no one will be prosecuted for corruption without his personal approval. In an example of the high-level [[nepotism]] that is well-nigh ubiquitous in Tajikistan, the agency has been headed since March 2015 by Rakhmon's son Rustam.&lt;ref name=transp/&gt;

A June 2015 report noted that Rustam had just arrested Hasan Rajabov (sometimes [[Tajik alphabet#Transliteration standards|transliterated]] as Khasan Radzhabov), an adviser to the president, on corruption charges.&lt;ref name=diplo/&gt; Rajabov was accused of massive embezzlement and soliciting bribes. Also arrested was Izzattullo Azizov, a member of the state religious affairs committee, who was accused of soliciting $2,000 bribes from [[Islam in Tajikistan|Muslims]] wanting to travel to [[Mecca]] for the [[hajj]]. In addition, Rustam has arrested several other senior officials for corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Tajikistan: Is Anti-Corruption Campaign About Corruption?| work =Eurasianet| date =15 Jun 2015| url =http://www.eurasianet.org/node/73861}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One problem with anti-corruption efforts is that persons in power routinely use corruption allegations to try to bring down their political opponents. In June 2016, a government newspaper accused Muhiddin Kabiri, the exiled leader of the opposition, of illicit property purchases, and he has avoided prosecution only by staying abroad. Zaid Saidov, a former industry minister who had attempted to establish an opposition party, was targeted with corruption charges in 2013, and was arrested and sentenced to 51 years in prison.&lt;ref name=free/&gt;

A May 2014 OECD report called on Tajikistan to step up its fight against corruption. While praising the country for passing anti-corruption laws, the OECD urged the regime to enforce those laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Tajikistan should step up its fight against corruption| work =Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development| date =27 May 2014| url =http://www.oecd.org/corruption/tajikistan-should-step-up-its-fight-against-corruption.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''crown agency''' was an administrative body of the [[British Empire]], distinct from the [[Civil Service Commission]] of Great Britain or the government administration of the national entity in which it operated.  These enterprises were overseen from 1833 to 1974 by the '''Office of the Crown Agents''' in London, thereafter named the '''Crown Agents for Oversea Governments and Administration'''.  [[Crown Agents for Oversea Governments and Administrations Ltd]] became a private Limited company providing [[land development|development]] services in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crownagents.co.uk/|title=Crown Agents - Home|website=www.crownagents.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today the term is also used to refer to [[state-controlled company|state-controlled companies]] in some states of the [[British Commonwealth]].

==Office of the Crown Agencies==

===Operation===
Crown agencies nominally reported directly to (and were wholly owned by) the Crown, but in practice, reported to the  '''Crown Agency Office''' in London, thus independent of the [[Colonial Office]]. This office became, in the late 19th century, the sole official British commercial and financial agent of all British protectorates and [[Crown colonies]].  The Colonial Office enforced a policy of sole usage of crown agencies for all purchases of goods for government use, creating a virtual monopoly over government retail supply within the colonies of the [[British Empire]]. The Crown Agencies also became financial institutions, supplying capital, routes for investment, and pensions to all public works and government in British dependent colonies (excluding such Dominions as Canada or Australia).  Crown Agencies were the bodies responsible for all large projects such as railway or harbour construction throughout British Africa, India, and the West Indies.&lt;ref&gt;David Sunderland. Principals and Agents: The Activities of the Crown Agents for the Colonies, 1880–1914. The Economic History Review, New Series, Vol. 52, No. 2 (May, 1999), pp. 284–306&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
Crown Agencies trace their founding to the time of the [[British Empire]] and in 1833 the British government, hived off from the [[Colonial Office]] as a financing, stores, transport, and development (to use a modern term) office.  Historians have argued that crown agencies, whose organisations operated across the British Empire in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, were the de facto administrators of British colonies.  Crown Agencies welded governmental powers through the maze of British, territories, protectorates, dependencies, Mandates, and Crown Colonies which [[de jure]] made up the British Empire of the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;David Sunderland (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1833 to 1880, they also operated in areas with [[Dominion]] status.  After this, their mandate was reduced to "dependent" colonies (most of British Africa, India, and the West Indies), but they were given near monopoly rights over finance and supply of non-local manufactures for any public or government use.&lt;ref&gt;David Sunderland. 'Objectionable Parasites': The Crown Agents and the Purchase of Crown Colony Government Stores, 1880–1914. Business History, Volume 41, Issue 4 October 1999 , pages 21 – 47&lt;/ref&gt;

With the dissolution of the British Empire, many of these agencies reverted to control by their respective governments, became parts of the British government, or became [[Non-governmental organisations]].  The central Crown Agency Office became involved in the [[secondary banking]] sector, but the [[Secondary banking crisis of 1973–1975]] drove the Agency into a debt of over two million British pounds and the agency filed for bankruptcy in 1974. The British government at the time found the Agency useful for overseas development and, argues one writer, enabled aid to be channeled to British goods, while providing cover for unsavory expenditures such as arms sales.&lt;ref&gt;Sunderland (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;  This last function was carried out by what was originally a wholly owned subsidiary of the crown agency, [[Millbank Technical Services]] (1967–79, when it was transferred to the Ministry of Defence and renamed),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jun/08/bae50 Profile: Millbank Technical Services]. David Leigh and Rob Evans, guardian.co.uk, Friday June 08 2007&lt;/ref&gt; which has since been accused of [[Neocolonial]] involvement in former British colonies and covert arms sales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caat.org.uk/publications/government/QuadCommFeb06.pdf Submission from the Campaign Against Arms Trade to the Quadripartite Committee on Strategic Export Controls] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070129141212/http://www.caat.org.uk/publications/government/QuadCommFeb06.pdf |date=2007-01-29 }} February 2006. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;The DSO arranged for the use of a nationalised company, Millbank Technical Services (MTS), then a wholly owned subsidiary of the Crown Agents, to pay bribes on a proposed Government-to-Government arms deal. A senior DSO official Harold Hubert wrote in 1972 about a proposed sale to the Saudi Arabian National Guard: "MTS will have little hope of business unless we [UK government] invite them to sell on our behalf. ... Since, when the Ambassador sees the King, he will indicate our willingness to do business on a G-to-G (government-to-government) basis there might be advantages to MTS co-ordinating any British equipment business to provide the quasi- government oversight as well as passing on the douceurs" (FCO 8/1914).&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  The British government incorporated the Crown Agency as a government mandated corporation tied to the [[Minister of Overseas Development]], called the ''Crown Agents for Overseas Governments and Administration''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euforic.org/gb/advis_gb.htm?&amp;username=guest@euforic.org&amp;password=9999&amp;groups=EUFORIC&amp;workgroup= Advisory Structures for Development Cooperation Policy in the United Kingdom]: survey (1993–1994) carried out by ECDPM on behalf of the National Advisory Council for Development Cooperation (NAR) of the Netherlands.

==Contemporary usage==
The legal category of crown agencies still exist in some  nations of the former British Empire.  In most places, these have been replaced by government agencies, [[state-controlled company|state-controlled companies]], and (in parts of the Commonwealth) [[Crown Corporations]].  Canada and New Zealand maintain the category of government managed or owned entities called Crown Agencies.

===Canada===
Where existing today, as in Canada&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_90m59_e.htm Municipal Tax Assistance Act. R.S.O. 1990, CHAPTER M.59]: "''"Crown agency" means an agency of the Crown in right of Ontario, but does not include Ontario Hydro Financial Corporation; ("organisme de la Couronne")''"&lt;/ref&gt;  they report to the sovereign governments in the states where they operate.  In Canada, the term may refer to any government agency, created by statute, which does not report to a government Ministry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.llbc.leg.bc.ca/public/PubDocs/bcdocs/364074/establishing_crown_agency.pdf Establishing a Crown Agency], Government of British Columbia, 26 August 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[CN Rail]] and the [[Ontario Heritage Foundation]], for instance, are under Canadian Law "Crown Agencies".

===New Zealand===
The term is also used under New Zealand law&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courts.govt.nz/lac/pubs/1992/report_7/chapter_4.html Public Finance Act 1989: Crown Agencies]: Legislation Advisory Committee Report No.7, LEGISLATION ADVISORY COMMITTEE, Parliament of New Zealand (1989).&lt;/ref&gt; to designate state owned enterprises which do not report directly to a single Ministry.

===Crown bodies===
In the United Kingdom, the term is sometimes used to refer to [[Crown bodies]]: public bodies which have Crown status, meaning that material which they produce is subject to Crown copyright protection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/advice/crown-copyright/uk-crown-bodies.htm UK Crown Bodies], Office of Public Sector Information (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/information-management/re-using-public-sector-information/uk-government-licensing-framework/crown-copyright/uk-crown-bodies/|title=UK Crown bodies - Re-using PSI|first=The National|last=Archives|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Daats'iin''' is a [[Gumuz language]] of western [[Ethiopia]]. It was first reported in 2013 and described by Colleen Ahland in 2014. She has described it further in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;Colleen Ahland. 2016. Daatsʼíin, a newly identified undocumented language of western Ethiopia: A preliminary examination. In Doris L. Payne, Sara Pacchiarotti &amp; Mokaya Bosire (eds.), ''Diversity in African languages'', 417–449. Berlin: Language
Science Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the other Gumuz languages, Daats'íin has the greatest lexical similarity to Southern Gumuz, but the two groups communicate in [[Arabic]] or [[Amharic]].&lt;ref name=Ahland&gt;[http://www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/cr_files/2015-054.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

The community of speakers is in western Ethiopia, very near the [[Sudan]] border, just north of where the [[Blue Nile River]] crosses from Ethiopia into Sudan.&lt;ref&gt;map on p. 419.

Payne, Sara Pacchiarotti &amp; Mokaya Bosire (eds.), ''Diversity in African languages'', 417–449. Berlin: Language Science Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammar==
Daats'íin has several grammatical differences from other Gumuz languages. Verbs inflect for [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]] ([[Perfective and imperfective|perfective&amp;ndash;imperfective]]) rather than for tense (future&amp;ndash;non-future). Verbs are [[Polysynthetic language|polysynthetic]] in all languages, but the order of the morphemes differs in Daats'iin, and some morphemes that occur in one language do not occur in the other(s).&lt;ref name=Ahland/&gt; "The major constituent order in Daats'íin clauses tend to be AVO/SV."&lt;ref&gt;p. 440.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3403">The death of '''René Steegmans''' (January 1, 1980 – October 24, 2002) was a [[violent crime]] which occurred in [[Venlo]], [[Netherlands]], on October 22, 2002, which drew national attention for being an act of [[senseless violence]].

Steegmans addressed two youths for driving recklessly past an old lady on their [[Scooter (motorcycle)|scooter]]. According to witnesses he asked for some respect for the elderly. Eighteen-year-old Khalid Lakhlifi and Sylvio Richters then attacked Steegmans, kicking and beating him several times. Witnesses did not intervene. Steegmans was hospitalised with brain damage at the [[Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre|Radboud Medical Centre]] in [[Nijmegen]], where he died a day later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.limburger.nl/article/20121019/REGIONIEUWS02/121018484/1002] ''Interview ouders René Steegmans'', [[Dagblad de Limburger]], October 19, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://zembla.vara.nl/Afleveringen.1973.0.html?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=6581&amp;cHash=c3fea2a38f6e7d1d0a202510b87c1a25], ''De stille getuigen van Venlo'', [[Zembla (TV series)|Zembla]], January 9, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eo.nl/archief/tv/hoeishettochmet/aflevering-detail/hoe-is-het-toch-met-5/], ''Hoe is het toch met: Joan Haanappel, ouders Rene Steegmans, Frank en Mirella'', [[Evangelische Omroep]], April 7, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

A silent march was organised to commemorate his death. Khalid was later sentenced to eight years in prison and [[involuntary commitment]]. Sylvio, who did not fight but only encouraged Khalid, was sentenced to twelve months of youth detention, of which 6 months on probation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.volkskrant.nl/binnenland/article164814.ece/Acht_jaar_cel_en_tbs_voor_Venlose_Khalid_L.] ''Acht jaar cel en tbs voor Venlose Khalid L.'', [[de Volkskrant]], April 26, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The violent death of René Steegmans, combined with the Moroccan, Muslim background of the perpetrators, caused a national discussion on integration,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/5009/Archief/archief/article/detail/2580544/2002/10/26/Woede-richt-zich-op-jonge-Marokkanen.dhtml] ''Woede richt zich op jonge Marokkanen'', [[Trouw]], October 26, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.standaard.be/cnt/DST28102002_037] ''Ouders van Marokkaanse verdachte schokken Venlo'', [[De Standaard]], October 28, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reframing Dutch Culture"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=PG53jNVPMFQC&amp;pg=PA170] ''Reframing Dutch Culture: Between Otherness and Authenticity'', Peter J.

'''Demalagattara''' are a [[social group]] or [[caste]] amongst the [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] of [[Sri Lanka]]. Demalagattara are  Theravada Buddhists by religion. They are ethnically Sinhalese but proclaim their [[Tamil people|Tamil]] ethnic origins, whereas all other [[South India]]-derived castes such as [[Karave]], [[Salagama]], [[Durave]], [[Berava (people)|Berava]] and even [[Govigama]] do not emphasise their Tamil links as part of their assimilation into Sinhalese society.

==Origins==
As the mainstream Sinhalese speakers claim [[North Indian]] ethnic origins the presence of many South Indian type [[Jatis]] like the Demalagatara indicate a complex migration history from India to Sri Lanka. Demalagatara do not indicate any tribal origins like the other, formerly untouchable, caste of [[Rodiyas]]. Their place in the caste structure is related to a primary function associated with formerly martial origins.  They were classed as a sub-caste of the [[Govigama]] during the [[British East India Company|British]] period. Many are agriculturalists and workers throughout the country.

==South Indian roots==
Some [[anthropologists]] believe that the early society of Sri Lanka has looked to neighboring South India for manpower to fulfill functional needs as land was cleared and many new villages found. Demalagatara are believed to be descended from [[Maravar]] or [[Kallar(caste)|Kallar]] like martial castes of South India who also play an important role as mercenaries medieval Sinhalese kingdoms.

==Etymology of Demalagattara==
‘Demala’ is the [[Sinhalese language|Sinhala]] word for [[Tamil people|Tamil]] and ‘Gattara’ is the word used in ancient Sri Lankan rock inscriptions and literature to refer to [[serfs]]. Thus Demalagattara translates into English as ‘Tamil serfs’. ‘Agricultural serfs’ were part of the feudal [[land tenure]] system of Sri Lanka. There were also ‘domestic serfs’.

==Origin myths==
The community says that they descended from soldiers who accompanied a 2nd-century BCE Tamil [[Chola]] King named as [[Ellara]]. But in reality the story is partly true, they are South Indian soldiers who got to settle down due royal grants but the actual time and the king(s) who granted them these privileges happened much later than indicated by their origin myth. Research on origins was carried out during the [[British Empire|British]] [[Colonialism|Colonial]] period and is dated.  (See [[Caste in Sri Lanka]])

After registering a steady increase during Soviet period, the [[Censuses of Armenia|population of Armenia]] declined from peak value 3.633 mln in 1992 to 2.986 mln in 2017.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.armstat.am/file/article/demog_2017_1.pdf|title=The Demographic Handbook of Armenia, 2017 - Summary|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The country's population has declined due to increased [[emigration]] since the break-up of the Soviet Union. The rates of emigration and population decline, however, have decreased in recent years, and there has been a moderate influx of Armenians returning to Armenia.

== Human development ==
According to 2016 human development report &lt;ref&gt;http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/2016_human_development_report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Armenia has the highest [[List_of_countries_by_inequality-adjusted_HDI|inequality-adjusted HDI]] and the lowest coefficient of human inequality compared to all of its neighbouring countries.

== Vital statistics ==

=== Life expectancy ===
During soviet period life expectancy was traditionally high in Armenia and topped all other republics of [[Soviet Union|USSR]] and most of countries in Eastern Europe in 1978-1980&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;ctype=c&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=s&amp;met_y=sp_dyn_le00_in&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;idim=country:AZE:GEO:EST:KAZ:LVA:MDA:RUS:TJK:TKM:UKR:LTU:KGZ:BLR:ARM&amp;ifdim=country:region:ECS&amp;tunit=Y&amp;pit=277934400000&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false&amp;icfg|title=World Development Indicators - Google Public Data Explorer|last=|first=|date=|website=www.google.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://d-zykin.livejournal.com/275731.html|title=Продолжительность жизни  по республикам СССР|last=d_zykin|date=2016-01-02|website=Журнал Летучего Мыша: каждому свое и подобное к подобному|access-date=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

After setback during 1986-1996 mostly due to [[1988 Armenian earthquake|Spitak Earthquake]] and [[Nagorno-Karabakh War|Nagorno-Karabakh]] conflict Armenia regained its positions and was consistently among three best former soviet republics during 1997-2016 and topped the list in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;ctype=c&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=s&amp;met_y=sp_dyn_le00_in&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;idim=country:AZE:GEO:EST:KAZ:LVA:MDA:RUS:TJK:TKM:UKR:LTU:KGZ:BLR:ARM:XKX&amp;ifdim=country:region:ECS&amp;tunit=Y&amp;pit=1193079600000&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false&amp;icfg|title=World Development Indicators - Google Public Data Explorer|last=|first=|date=|website=www.google.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 natural increase of population comprised 12 366 persons and the crude rate of natural increase made 4.1‰, per 1000 population, decreasing by 0.4 pro mile points compared to the previous year. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

After double-digit (in pro mile) crude natural increase rates during 1982-1992 these did not exceed 5.5 after 1998. At regional level slightly better situation is in Yerevan city, where the value of 5.5 is consistently being surpassed since 2009. Particularly weak is natural increase in [[Tavush Province|Tavush]] and [[Syunik Province|Syunik]] provinces, not much better off are [[Lori Province|Lori]] and [[Vayots Dzor Province|Vayots Dzo]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;r provinces.  &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The largest communities of the ethnic [[Armenian diaspora]] are fluent in [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[English language|English]].

== Religions ==
{{Main|Religion in Armenia}}
Most Armenians are Christian, primarily of [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Apostolic Church]] rite. Armenia is considered the first nation to adopt Christianity, which was first preached in Armenia by two Apostles of [[Jesus]], [[St. Bartholomew]] and [[St. Thaddeus]] in the 1st century.  The [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] can  trace its roots back to the 3rd and 4th centuries.  The country formally adopted the Christian faith in 301 A.D. Over 90% of Armenians belong to the Armenian Apostolic Church. It is a very ritualistic, conservative church, roughly comparable to the Coptic and Syrian churches. Armenia also has a population of [[Armenian Catholic Church|Catholics]] and evangelical Protestants.

According to the Census of 2011 the religion in Armenia is the following: Christianity 2,862,366 (94.8%) of whom 2,797,187 Armenian Apostolic (92.5%), 29,280 Evangelical, 13,996 Armenian and Roman (Latin) Catholic, 8,695 Jehovah's Witness, 8,587 Eastern Orthodox (Russian, Ukrainian, Georgian, Greek), 2,874 Molokan (non-Orthodox Russians), 1,733 Assyrian Church of the East (Nestorian), 733 Protestant, 241 Mormon, Yazidism (0.8%), Paganism (0.2%), 812 Islam, 5,299 Other Religion (0.2%), 121,587 No Response (4%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://armstat.am/file/article/sv_03_13a_520.pdf|title=ՀՀ մշտական բնակչության սեռատարիքային կազմն ըստ քաղաքային եւ գյուղական բաշխվածության|last=|first=|date=2011|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Migration ==
The estimated number of population net migration is -24.8 thousand persons, according to the Integrated living conditions survey of households of 2016; for urban population -13.8 thousand and for rural population -11.0 thousand persons.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

24.9 % of households were involved in external and internal migration processes over the period of 2013- 2016. Migration directions were distributed as follows: 12% - internal , 10.5% - [[Republic of Artsakh]], rest (76.4%) - international (of which 89.8% - [[Russia]]). Among household members of age 15 and above, who left the place of their permanent residence in 2013-2016 for 3 months and longer and had not returned as of 2016, 11.9% were in Armenia, 13.0% in Artsakh, and 75.1% in other countries, predominantly in the Russian Federation. More than 54% of migrant household members of the age 15 years and above sent money and/ or goods to their families/relatives/friends within the 12 months preceding the survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.armstat.am/file/article/demog_2017_7.pdf|title=The Demographic Handbook of Armenia, 2017 - Migration|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wealth and poverty ==
According to official data 29.4 % of population was below poverty line in year 2016. The poverty indicators in [[Shirak Province|Shirak]], [[Lori Province|Lori]], [[Kotayk Province|Kotayk]], [[Tavush Province|Tavush]] and [[Armavir Province|Armavir]] provinces are higher than the country average. The highest poverty rate in the country has been recorded in [[Shirak Province|Shirak]] province, where 46% of the population is below the poverty line. To overcome poverty, Armenia would need AMD 63.2 billion, or an amount equal to 1.2% of GDP, in addition to the resources already allocated for social assistance, assuming that such assistance would be efficiently targeted to the poor only.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In terms of international poverty line corresponding to US$1.25 at 2005 PPP poverty in Armenia went down from 19.3% in year 2001 to 1.5% in year 2008 and remained nearly unchanged until year 2015 moving in range 1.5% - 2.7%.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

According to Global Wealth report prepared by Credit Suisse [[List of countries by wealth per adult|mean wealth per adult]] in Armenia in 2018 is estimated at $7,583 rising 3.96 times from estimated $1,913 in year 2000.  Mean wealth per adult in Armenia surpasses corresponding values for neighboring countries Iran and Azerbaijan, as well as for Ukraine and Belarus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://publications.credit-suisse.com/tasks/render/file/index.cfm?fileid=777FDF0E-E060-F608-52DAF97E062CC35B|title=Global Wealth Databook 2018|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://howmuch.net/articles/world-wealth-map-2018|title=Visualizing the Huge Disparities Between People's Wealth Around the World|work=HowMuch|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This article is about the [[demographics|demographic]] features of the [[population]] of [[Mauritius]], including [[population density]], [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.

Mauritian society includes people from many different ethnic groups. A majority of the republic's residents are the descendants of people from the [[Indian subcontinent]]. Mauritius also contains substantial populations from continental [[Africa]], [[People's Republic of China|China]], [[France]], [[Great Britain]] and the East African island nation of [[Madagascar]] among other places.

==Ethnic groups==
The majority of the population are [[Mauritian of Indian origin|Indo-Mauritians]] (people of Indian descent) who make up 68% of the population.&lt;ref name="cia.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/mp.html#People|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|website=Cia.gov|accessdate=2017-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mauritian Creole people|Creoles]] (of African descent or mixed-race) are about a quarter of the population.&lt;ref name="cia.gov"/&gt;  There are approximately 30,000 [[Sino-Mauritian]]s from the [[Hakka people|Hakka]] and other Chinese sub-ethnic/linguistic groups.&lt;ref name="Eriksen 1998 82"&gt;{{harvnb|Eriksen|1998|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Franco-Mauritian]]s (Mauritian of [[French people|French]] ancestry) are numbered about 13,000. The Franco-Mauritian group, mostly are the descendants of former slave-owners,  comprises the largest group of people of European origin on the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eriksen|2004|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a smaller population of people of British descent living in Mauritius, most of whom have Mauritian nationality. The term Anglo-Mauritian, which may also include [[Mauritian British|Mauritians living in the UK]], is used unofficially.
There's also a substantial new arrivals of white South Africans, numbering about 20,000, and is a growing community.

While within the Mauritian social context, the main ethnic groups are refer to as the following: Hindus or Indians (North Indian Hindus) 40% (520,000), residing all over the Island, with higher concentration in the North. Creoles (Afro or Afro-Indian) 22% (286,000), mostly central plateau area, the suburbs of Port Louis and coastal villages such as Baie du Tombeau and the black river region. Muslims (Indo-Muslims) 16%(208,000), most living in the central plateau towns and Plaine Verte in the capital city. Tamils or South Indians (Tamils or Christian-Tamils) 14.5%(188,500), concentrated in the central plateau towns. Gens de Couleur or coloured creoles 3%(39,000) mostly Rose-Hill-Beau Basin, coastal villages of Albion and Tamarin and also Montagne Blanche. Chinese or Sino-Mauritian 2%(26,000), mostly in Port Louis. white/Franco-Mauritians 1%(13,000), reside in three main towns, Tamarin in the South west coast, Curepipe in the centre of the Island and in the North mostly in and around pointe aux canonniers. [[White South Africans]] 1.5% (22,000), live exclusively in coastal town of Tamarin and black river region.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

While the government officially groups Mauritians in four ethnic groups: Hindus, Muslims, Chinese and General population. The general population gathers all that don't practice the Hindu or Muslim religion, or are not Chinese by race. Hence general population is the Christian community, which includes whites, coloureds, blacks, and a good amount of those of Indian ancestry especially Tamils who have converted to Christianity. The exception to the rule is that the general population does not include the Christian-Chinese, although 90% are Christians.

Note since independence nearly 60% of the Coloured community (51,000), 60% of the whites (17,000), 50% of the Chinese (26,000), and further 26,000 Afro-creoles and Christian-Tamils have departed; coloureds mostly to Australia, whites or near white coloureds (pass as whites) to South Africa, Chinese to Canada and Afro-Creoles and Christian Tamils mostly Europe/U.K. There is 200,000 Mauritians living outside of Mauritius of which 120,000 people are Christians, representing the majority in the diaspora at 60%.

Small groups of foreign students from Europe or the Indian Ocean region are also present.  Recent years have seen a steady flow of foreign workers into the textile industry (primarily Chinese women), the construction industry (primarily Indian workers), and harbour-related activities (primarily Taiwanese men). Immigration policy does not provoke much debate in Mauritius, and the relative economic stability of the island serves to attract foreign workers.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

==Language==
{{Further|Languages of Mauritius}}
[[Image:Port Louis vegetables.jpg|thumb|150px|Picture from the 1950s of the Central Market, Port Louis, Mauritius.]]

The main languages spoken in Mauritius are [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]] and [[Mauritian Creole]]. There is no official language. English is the [[official language]] of the parliament, though French is also permitted. However, the [[lingua franca]] is Mauritian Creole and the newspapers and television programs are usually in French.&lt;ref name="brandeis.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brandeis.edu/coexistence/linked%20documents/Nigel%20-%20Mauritius%20FINAL.pdf |title=Coexistence International at Brandeis University |format=PDF|website=Brandeis.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mauritian Créole, which is spoken by 90 percent of the population, is considered to be the native language of the country and is used most often in informal settings.&lt;ref name="chass.utoronto.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/~cpercy/courses/6362-chiba.htm|title=English Usage in Mauritius|website=Chass.utoronto.ca|accessdate=2017-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed in the 18th century by slaves who used a [[pidgin language]] to communicate with each other as well as with their French masters, who did not understand the various African languages. The pidgin evolved with later generations to become a casual language.&lt;ref name="m2002.thecgf.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m2002.thecgf.com/Nations/Africa/Mauritius/default.asp|title=Mauritius|website=M2002.thecgf.com|accessdate=2017-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mauritian Creole is a [[French-based creole]] due to its close ties with French pronunciation and vocabulary. Bhojpuri is also spoken by a large percentage of Mauritian people at home and in informal scenarios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Holm |first=J. |authorlink= |title=Pidgins and Creoles |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=1989 |location=New York |pages=476 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PcD7p9y3EIcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}, p.353.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 10,000 people can speak the Tamil language and many of their children have started to learn the language.

The '''Deng Yujiao incident''' ({{zh|c=邓玉娇事件|p=Dèng Yùjiāo Shìjiàn}}) occurred on 10 May 2009 at a hotel in [[Badong County]], [[Hubei province]], in the People's Republic of China.&lt;ref name=asar&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.economist.com/world/asia/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13788686|work=[[The Economist]]|date=6 June 2009|title=A stab at reform}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deng Yujiao, a 21-year-old [[pedicure]] worker, tried to rebuff the advances of Deng Guida ({{lang|zh|邓贵大}}; no relation), director of the local township business promotions office, who had come to the hotel seeking sexual services.&lt;ref name=guar090527&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/may/27/china-bails-deng-yujiao |first=Tania |last=Branigan |work=The Guardian |title=Chinese woman who killed official bailed after online outcry |date=27 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; She allegedly stabbed her assailant several times trying to fight him off, resulting in his death. Badong County police subsequently arrested Deng Yujiao, charged her with [[homicide]], and refused to grant her bail.

This case came to national prominence through internet forums and chatrooms, where netizens were enraged by her treatment. The case resonated with the public anger over the corruption and immorality of officials, and garnered over four million forum posts across the country.&lt;ref name="nyt090616"/&gt; Chinese authorities attempted to downplay the incident by limiting its presence on Chinese web portals, and a large number of discussion threads were censored.&lt;ref name="scmp090610"&gt;{{cite news |title=Web of support |last=Li |first=Raymond |work=[[South China Morning Post]] |date=10 June 2009 |page=A11, 'Behind the News'}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following groundswell of public protests and online petitions, prosecutors dropped murder charges, granted her bail,&lt;ref name=guar090527/&gt; and charged her with a lesser offense of "intentional assault".&lt;ref name="heroic killer"/&gt; She was found guilty but did not receive a sentence due to her mental state. The two surviving officials involved in the incident were sacked, also ostensibly in response to public pressure.&lt;ref name="slap"/&gt;

==The incident==
Deng Yujiao, a native of Mulongya village, [[Badong County]], was a 21-year-old [[pedicure]] worker at the Dream Fantasy City ({{lang|zh|梦幻城}}) bath center at Xiongfeng Hotel ({{lang|zh|雄风宾馆}}), when the incident occurred.&lt;ref name="slap"/&gt;

Deng Guida was the director of the local township's business promotions office. He, his deputy, Huang Dezhi ({{lang|zh|黄德智}}), and one other official arrived at the hotel where Deng Yujiao worked on 10 May 2009 and allegedly requested "special services" (a euphemism commonly taken to mean sexual services in China) from Deng Yujiao. She did not submit to the requests.&lt;ref name="slap"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=6&amp;art_id=82873&amp;sid=24064059&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20090602&amp;sear_year=2009 |title=Cops take slap at heroine |first=Jerran |last=Lin |work=The Standard |date= 2 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deng Guida had allegedly pulled out a stack of [[banknotes]] worth [[Renminbi|¥]]&amp;nbsp;4000 and slapped her in the face with it to show off his wealth. He then pushed Deng Yujiao onto a sofa and proceeded to lay on top of her. At this moment, in self-defense, Deng Yujiao used a small 3&amp;nbsp;inch knife and stabbed her assailant four times. One of the stabs landed in her assailant's neck, causing him to bleed to death at the scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article6369665.ece|title=Chinese outraged over pedicurist who stabbed lecherous official |last=Jane Macartney|date=27 May 2009|publisher=Times online|accessdate=28 May 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; His deputy was also stabbed. Police, who apparently found pills in her purse,&lt;ref name="nyt090616"/&gt; said Deng Yujiao may have been suffering from acute depression, and took her to a psychiatric hospital on 12 May for examination.&lt;ref name="slap"/&gt; During Deng's days in the hospital her arms and ankles were tied to the bed, which was referred to by the police as "a procedure of protection."

Two lawyers from Beijing, Xia Lin ({{lang|zh|夏霖}}) and Xia Nan ({{lang|zh|夏楠}}), took on her case ''[[pro bono publico|pro bono]]''. On 25 May 2009, they lodged an official complaint against one of the attackers, Huang Dezhi at the Badong police station. Details of the complaint:

* Huang Dezhi tried to remove her jeans and underwear by force (namely attempted rape) while she was doing laundry.
* Deng Guida then used a wad of [[Renminbi|¥]]4000 cash to hit her face while yelling, "Didn't you want money? I bet you have not seen any money before. How much money you want, just say it, believe me or not, I shall smack you to death with money." Deng Yujiao retorted, "Yes, I have never seen any money before, if you have the guts, today you smack me to death." Deng Guida then replied, "I am going to smack you to death with money. I'm going to get a truck load of money to squash you to death."
* After stabbing the two men (Deng Guida and Huang Dezhi), Deng Yujiao put down the knife and called local police and her mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/05/17/china-netizens-stand-with-the-waitress-who-killed-an-official/|title=China: Netizens stand with the waitress who killed an official|last=Bob Chan|date=17 May 2009|publisher=Global Voices|accessdate=30 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://chinadigitaltimes.net/2009/05/deng-yujiao-tells-her-story/|title= Deng Yujiao Tells Her Story; Protesters Express Support  ESWN translates a Southern Metropolis Daily article in which Deng Yujiao tells what took place on the night she stabbed a local official who attempted to rape her|date=25 May 2009 |publisher=ESWN|accessdate=30 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Police chief's interview==
On 22 May 2009, Yang Liyong (楊立勇) was interviewed by ''[[Southern Metropolis Daily]]'', during which he presented the official police version of the incident.

#Deng is a service worker at the KTV.
#She was requested of a "bathing service between opposite sex." To one reporter's question, "Why was the Deng Guida's demand of ''special service'' being changed into ''bathing service''?" Yang replied: (on special service) "may be a lot of people understand it as a sexual service, a sex trade, but on this case, the trade had not gone through, we have no choice, we can only call it a bathing service between opposite sex."
#Quoted: "The public security bureau thinks that she is suspected of committing intentional murder based upon two direct pieces of evidence.  First, death was caused.  Secondly, Deng Guida suffered two fatal stab wounds which we determined to be quite powerful.  Two fatal stab wounds." Unquoted.
#Quoted: "During our investigation of this case, the whole matter is really a very ordinary case involving death. But the public and the media insist on turning into a tragedy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://zonaeuropa.com/200905c.brief.htm#011 |title=(Southern Metropolis Daily) Interview with Yang Liyong, Badong public security bureau director. |date=22 May 2009 |publisher=ESWN |accessdate=28 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Deng turned herself in to the police, she was initially charged with murder. Deng claimed she acted in self-defense after the official attempted to rape her. Blogger Wu Gan, wrote about her case in his blog. A Berkeley professor remarked to the ''New York Times'' that instead of garnering hundreds of thousands of mentions on Internet blogs and other forums, Deng’s case accumulated in excess of four million posts across websites.&lt;ref name="nyt090616"/&gt; Deng's plight struck a note with millions of Chinese fed up with low-level corruption and "rampant social injustice and the lack of fundamental respect in society," in the words of a Beijing lawyer.&lt;ref name="scmp090610"/&gt; Deng was hailed as a national hero for resisting official abuse of power. Her supporters, who demanded a fair trial, took their protest to Beijing. Their visual stunt was a woman wearing a mask and wrapped in white cloth; a sign saying "Anyone could be Deng Yujiao" was laid on the ground around her. The photos immediately appeared on the Internet.&lt;ref name="nyt090616"/&gt;

Chinese bloggers showed their solidarity with Deng Yujiao by distributing free T-shirts on the net with popular slogans like:

*江山如此多娇！ Translation: The rivers and mountains are so charming and gorgeous. This is a poem by Mao Tsetung, the last Chinese character is 嬌, which is also Deng Yujiao's name.
*巴东玉娇龙，华夏女英雄！ Translation: Badong Yu Jiao-long, Huaxia heroine. Yu Jiao-long is a famous movie character,  where Yu Jiao is also Deng Yujiao's name.
*中国烈女，公民楷模！ Translation: Heroic woman, citizen role model.

As a result of the national outcry, police released her on bail&lt;ref name=guar090527/&gt; and put her under house arrest;&lt;ref name="scmp090610"/&gt; prosecutors charged her with a lesser offense of "intentional assault" instead of murder.&lt;ref name="heroic killer"/&gt; The two surviving officials were sacked on 31 May. ''[[Xinhua]]'' reported that Badong County Communist Party Discipline Inspection Committee removed Huang Dezhi from the post of vice director of the office of business delegations of Yesanguan Township, and stripped of his CPC membership, as he had "pushed and shoved and verbally insulted a waitress who refused to accompany them to take a bath" in a bathhouse on 10 May in Badong, the authorities said. Huang has been "detained in connection with public order offences." Deng Zhongjia, 45, another vice director of the same office who was present at the time of the incident, was also fired, ostensibly because the incident had caused a "bad social effect" although he had not broken any laws or regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-05/31/content_11464359.htm |title=Chinese officials sacked in probe into "self-defense" killing by waitress |date=31 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Censorship and alleged official meddling==
The Badong county police said that an official had been killed whilst in a quarrel with Deng Yujiao. Their statement issued on 13 May said that Deng Guida twice pushed the girl onto a sofa and was killed by a pedicure knife. Police said that the murder weapon was a fruit knife five days later.&lt;ref name="scmp090610"/&gt;

[[Meng Jianzhu]], minister of the [[Ministry of Public Security of the People's Republic of China]], allegedly gave instruction to his deputy:
{{cquote|When dealing with these matters, I hope our police colleagues will have a faster response next time. Those internet bloggers don't talk sense, so we will not be talking sense back to them. The suspect and the evidence are both in our hands. There is no need to watch public opinion so closely and treat the case according to the wishes of netizens. We should arrest those that need to be arrested, and execute those that need to be executed. The Shanghai authorities executed [[Yang Jia]]; has there been any problems?

If they didn't execute Yang Jia, who would dare to work as police in the future?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://club.china.com/data/thread/1011/2672/14/30/8_1.html|title=夏霖律师 痛哭的照片|date=21 May 2009|publisher=中华网论坛|accessdate=26 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.peacehall.com/news/gb/china/2009/05/200905192252.shtml|title=公安部领导拍板，邓玉娇被正式逮捕 (original: 这样的事，希望我们公安部门今后反应快一点，网民不讲理，我们就不和他们讲理，人在我们手里，证据在我们手里，大家不用看互联网民意办案。该抓就抓，该杀就杀。上海杀了杨佳，有什么问题？中央很支持，不杀，今后谁还敢当公安？)|date=19 May 2009日|publisher= [[Boxun.com]]|accessdate=26 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Deng Yujiao's mother received a call, purportedly from the police, after which she washed most of her daughter's clothes thereby removing potential physical evidence. The police also announced on 23 May that she had hired two [[Hubei]] lawyers to replace the initial lawyers who, it was alleged, had breached Deng Yujiao's privacy.&lt;ref name="scmp090610"/&gt;

On approximately&lt;!-- sources contradict, some saying 22, some 24, some 26 May --&gt; 22 May, Beijing censors ordered websites to stop reporting the case. The [[State Council Information Office]] issued directives to all Chinese websites to remove all the recommended news stories  and commentaries on Deng Yujiao. No posts about Deng Yujiao must be placed at the top of the page.  Later on, the Beijing Information Office telephoned portals instructing them to use only official government statements and not report or comment on Deng Yujiao. The State Information Office ordered media and web portals to 'dilute the Deng Yujiao case with other news', delete any 'open letters and pleadings', and bar any web based opinion poll or petition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://zonaeuropa.com/200905c.brief.htm#011|title=Chinese Media Bans (Where They Exist) |date=25 May 2009 |publisher=ESWN |accessdate=28 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.ntdtv.com/ntdtv_en/ns_china/2009-05-27/539000197906.html |script-title=zh:大陸媒體齊挺鄧玉嬌 國務院下禁令 |language=Chinese |date=25 May 2009|publisher=NTDTV|accessdate=28 May 2009}}{{Verify credibility |date=June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Television and the Internet were cut off in Yesanguan, officially as a precaution against lightning strikes. The Internet attention drew Chinese journalists to Badong County. But after censorship was imposed, local officials began screening outsiders, and some journalists seeking to report there were beaten. The blog of Wu Gan, which had publicised Deng's case, was shut down by censors.&lt;ref name="nyt090616"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/17/world/asia/17china.html?hp |title=Civic-Minded Chinese Find a Voice Online |first=Michael |last=Wines |work=The New York Times |date=16 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial==
According to the media, Deng Yujiao's murder charge was changed to intentional assault, most likely following massive public pressure from internet users who hailed her as a heroine.&lt;ref name="heroic killer"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=30&amp;art_id=83595&amp;sid=24248616&amp;con_type=3&amp;d_str=20090617&amp;sear_year=2009 |title=Heroic killer walks free |first=Jerran |last=Lin |author2=Moy, Patsy |author3=AFP  |work=The Standard |date=17 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; At her trial on 16 June, a judge said the court had found her guilty because Deng had used excessive force even though she was acting in self-defense. The lenient sentence was on account of diminished responsibility, and because she had surrendered to police and the officials involved had made a major mistake. One Beijing human rights lawyer said the court would not have freed Deng if there was not so much pressure from so much national attention. ''The Standard'' reported that mainland websites were euphoric after the trial.&lt;ref name="heroic killer"/&gt;

The '''Domba''' or '''Dom''' ([[Sanskrit]] ''ḍoma'', dialectally also ''Domaki, Dombo, Domra, Domaka, Dombar, Dombari'' and variants) are an [[ethnic group]], or groups, scattered across India. In [[North India]], the preferred self-designation is Dom.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

The form ''ḍomba'' is [[Prakrit]], while  ''ḍoma'' and ''ḍumba'' are encountered in Kashmiri Sanskrit texts{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}. Derived from ''ḍoma'' is ''[[Domaki language|ḍomaki]]'', the name of a language spoken in a small enclave in [[Gilgit-Baltistan]], Pakistan. It is also believed that the [[Dom people|Dom or Domi people]] of the Middle East, in addition to the [[Roma people|Roma]] of Europe,&lt;ref name="Matras1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Matras|first=Yaron|title=Romani in Contact|date=1 June 1995|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|isbn=978-9-02727-648-3|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=February 2017}} are descendants of Domba, who were taken, or travelled, to [[Sassanid Persia]] as servants and musicians.

==Etymology==
Its presumed root, ''ḍom'', which is connected with drumming, is linked to ''damara'' and ''[[damaru]]'', Sanskrit terms for "drum" and the Sanskrit verbal root डम् ''ḍam-'' 'to sound (as a drum)', perhaps a loan from [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]], e.g. [[Kannada language|Kannada]] ''ḍamāra'' 'a pair of kettle-drums', and [[Telugu language|Telugu]] ''ṭamaṭama'' 'a drum, [[tomtom drum|tomtom]]'.&lt;ref&gt;T. Burrow and M.B. Emeneau, ''A Dravidian Etymological Dictionary'' 2nd ed. (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1984), p. 257, entry #2949.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pakistan==
In 1989, 500 people were counted as speaking Domaki in the Shina valley of [[Gilgit Baltistan]] region. The people are called Bericho, Dom, or Doma. They are musicians and blacksmiths. The Dom identity developed out of their work as musicians and blacksmiths. They are a heterogeneous group, descended from a number of families that took up service with the various local rulers. The Dom belong to the [[Nizari Ismaili]] sect in [[Hunza Valley|Hunza]], and the Athna Ashri Shia sect in Nagar. After land reforms carried out by Pakistan government in the 1970s, the Dom were given ownership of land. However, the majority of the Dom are still landless, and are still employed as blacksmiths.&lt;ref&gt;The Dom of Hunza (northern areas of Pakistan) / Anna Schmid in Disappearing peoples? : indigenous groups and ethnic minorities in South and Central Asia / edited by Barbara A. Brower, Barbara Rose Johnston. {{ISBN|1598741209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==North India==
Dom in [[Himachal Pradesh]] exhibit the archetypal characteristics of an [[indigenous peoples of Asia|indigenous]] [[hunter gatherer]] tribe that has been incorporated as part of the caste system. Doms are agricultural workers, basket weavers and small scale agriculturalists. They are not known for their nomadic existence. They are also recognised by their neighbours as the original inhabitants of the forests lands.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

The Dom community in [[Odisha]] speak both the [[Odia language]]. They live as neighbours with the [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]]-speaking [[Khonds]] tribals. Doms speak Dravidian Kondhi as well as Indo-Aryan [[Odia language]].{{cn|date=February 2017}}

In [[Varanasi]], the Hindu holy city in [[Uttar Pradesh]], the Dom perform the most important task of [[cremation]] of dead bodies. Many are nomadic and peripatetic groups in Uttar Pradesh are said to be of Dom origin such as the Bangali, [[Bhantu]], [[Bazigar]], [[Habura (caste)|Habura]], [[Kanjar]], and [[Sansi (nomadic)|Sansi]]. It could also be that term Dom is generically used to describe any peripatetic nomad, as all these groups mentioned are distinct and strictly [[endogamy|endogamous]]. Some speak a dialect or [[argot]] of their own, while others speak the prevailing dialect or language.&lt;ref&gt;Nomads in India : proceedings of the National Seminar / edited by P.K. Misra, K.C. Malhotra&lt;/ref&gt; The [[2011 Census of India]] for Uttar Pradesh showed the Dom as a Scheduled Caste with a population of 110,353.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/PCA/SC_ST/PCA-A10/SC-0900-PCA-A-10-ddw.xlsx |title= A-10 Individual Scheduled Caste Primary Census Abstract Data and its Appendix – Uttar Pradesh |publisher=Registrar General &amp; Census Commissioner, India |accessdate=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Free public transport''', often called '''fare-free public transit''' or '''zero-fare public transport''', refers to [[public transport]] funded in full by means other than by collecting [[fare]]s from passengers. It may be funded by national, regional or local [[government]] through [[taxation]], or by commercial [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsorship]] by businesses.  Alternatively, the concept of "free-ness" may take other forms, such as [[Free travel pass|no-fare access via a card]] which may or may not be paid for in its entirety by the user.

==Types==

===City-wide systems===
[[Tallinn]], capital city of [[Estonia]] with more than 420,000 inhabitants, and several mid-size European cities and many smaller towns around the world have converted their [[public transportation]] networks to zero-fare. The city of [[Hasselt]] in [[Belgium]] is a notable example: fares were abolished in 1997 and [[ridership]] was as much as "13 times higher" by 2006.&lt;ref name="stad"&gt;[http://www.hasselt.be/content/content/record.php?ID=4418 '10 jaar gratis openbaar vervoer'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081020214003/http://www.hasselt.be/content/content/record.php?ID=4418 |date=2008-10-20 }} (in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]) on the city's official website&lt;/ref&gt;

:''See [[#List of towns and cities with area-wide zero-fare transport|list]] below.''

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Local services===
{{unreferenced section|date= March 2016}}
Local zero-fare shuttles or inner-city loops are far more common than citywide systems. They often use [[buses]] or [[trams]]. These may be set up by a city government to ease [[traffic bottleneck|bottlenecks]] or fill short gaps in the transport network.

: ''See [[List of free public transport routes]] for a list of zero-fare routes within wider (fare-paying) networks''

Zero-fare transport is often operated as part of the services offered within a public facility, such as a hospital or university [[campus]] shuttle or an [[airport]] inter-terminal shuttle.

Some zero-fare services may be built to avoid the need for large transport construction. [[port city|Port cities]] where shipping would require very high [[bridge]]s might provide zero-fare [[ferries]] instead. These are free at the point of use, just as the use of a bridge might have been.
Machinery installed within a building or shopping centre can be seen as 'zero-fare transport': [[elevator]]s, [[escalators]] and [[moving sidewalk]]s are often provided by property owners and funded through the sales of goods and services. [[Community bicycle program]]s, providing free [[bicycles]] for short-term public use could be thought of as zero-fare transport.

A common example of zero-fare transport is [[student transport]], where students travelling to or from school do not need to pay. A notable example is the [[University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point]], which provides much of the funding to operate the [[Stevens Point Transit]] system. All students at the university can use any of the four citywide campus routes and the other four bus routes throughout the city free of charge. The university also funds two late night bus routes to serve the downtown free of charge with a goal of cutting down drunk driving.

In some regions transport is free because the revenues are lower that expenses from fare collection is already partially paid by government or company or service (for example BMO railway road in Moscow, most part of is used to as service transport and officially pick up passengers).{{clarify|reason=this sentence is very confusing, where did you learn English? :-)|date=May 2018}}

Many large [[amusement park]]s will have trams servicing large parking lots or distant areas. [[Disneyland]] in [[Anaheim, California]], runs a tram from its entrance, across the parking lot, and across the street to its hotel as well as the bus stop for [[Orange County Transportation Authority|Orange County]] and [[Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority|Los Angeles]] local transit buses. [[Six Flags Magic Mountain]] in [[Valencia, California]], provides tram service throughout its parking lot.

In July 2017, [[Dubai]] announced it would offer free bus services for a short period of time on selected days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.khaleejtimes.com/news/transport/dubai-rta-launches-free-bus-service-to-cover-partial-metro-closure|title=Dubai RTA launches free bus service to cover partial metro closure|first=Staff|last=Report|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==

===Operational benefits===
Transport operators can benefit from faster boarding and shorter dwell times, allowing faster [[Public transport timetable|timetabling]] of services. Although some of these benefits can be achieved in other ways, such as off-vehicle ticket sales and modern types of electronic [[fare]] collection, zero-fare transport avoids equipment and personnel costs.

Passenger aggression may be reduced. In 2008 bus drivers of Société des Transports Automobiles (STA) in [[Essonne]] held strikes demanding zero-fare transport for this reason. They claim that 90% of the aggression is related to refusal to pay the fare.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.volkskrant.nl/economie/article546941.ece/Franse_chauffeurs_voor_gratis_buskaartje Volkskrant.nl - Franse chauffeurs voor gratis buskaartje] (in Dutch)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commercial benefits===
Some zero-fare transport services are funded by private businesses, such as the merchants in a [[shopping mall]], in the hope that doing so will increase sales or other revenue from increased foot traffic or ease of travel. Employers often operate free shuttles as a benefit to their employees, or as part of a [[traffic congestion|congestion]] mitigation agreement with a local government.

===Community benefits===
Zero-fare transport can make the system more accessible and fair for low-income residents. Other benefits are the same as those attributed to public transport generally:
* [[Road]] traffic can benefit from decreased [[Traffic congestion|congestion]] and faster average road speeds, fewer traffic accidents, easier [[parking]], savings from reduced wear and tear on roads
* Increased public access, especially for the poor and low waged, which can in turn benefit [[social integration]], businesses and those looking for work
*[[Environment (biophysical)|Environmental]] and [[public health]] benefits including decreased [[air pollution]] and [[noise pollution]] from road traffic

===Global benefits===
Global benefits of zero-fare transport are also the same as those attributed to public transport generally. If use of personal [[cars]] is discouraged, zero-fare public transport could mitigate the problems of [[global warming]] and [[oil depletion]].

==Disadvantages==
Several large U.S. municipalities have attempted zero-fare systems, but many of these implementations have been judged unsuccessful by policy makers. A 2002 National Center for Transportation Research report suggests that, while transit ridership does tend to increase, there are also some disadvantages:&lt;ref name=nctr/&gt;
* An increase in vandalism, resulting in increased costs for security and vehicle-maintenance   
* In large transit systems, significant revenue shortfalls unless additional funding was provided
* An increase in driver complaints and staff turnover, although farebox-related arguments were eliminated
* Slower service overall (not collecting fares has the effect of speeding boarding, but increased crowding tends to swamp out this effect unless additional vehicles are added)
* Declines in schedule adherence

This U.S. report suggests that, while ridership does increase overall, the goal of enticing drivers to take transit instead of driving is not necessarily met: because fare-free systems tend to attract a certain number of "problem riders", zero-fare systems may have the unintended effect of convincing some 'premium' riders to go back to driving their cars. It should be kept in mind that this was a study that only looked at U.S. cities, and the author's conclusions may be less applicable in other countries that have better social safety nets and less crime than the large U.S. cities studied.&lt;ref name=nctr&gt;{{cite journal | last = Perone | first = Jennifer S. | title = Advantages and Disadvantages of Fare-Free Transit Policy | journal = NCTR Report Number: NCTR-473-133, BC137-38 | date = October 2002 | url = http://www.dot.state.fl.us/research-center/Completed_Proj/Summary_PTO/FDOT_BC137_38_FF_rpt.pdf | accessdate = 01/11/2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perception and analysis==
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2018}}
Free public transport creates the perception of a no-cost service, just as car drivers commonly perceive no cost to deciding to take their car somewhere. The catch of the car-based system is that the car trip is not in fact free, but it is generally perceived as such.

Likewise, this ''perception'' of freeness is important for public transport, which is far more environmentally and resource efficient than own-car travel – which means in this case that full access to the system need not be altogether “free” for its users but that from a financial perspective it becomes front-loaded and affordable. The invariable fact of life of delivering any public service is that the money to do so must come from somewhere – and of “free” public transport that once the user has entered into some kind of “contract” with her or his city – for example a monthly or annual transit pass that opens up the public system to unlimited use for those who pay for it. Now, how they pay and how much will be part of the overall political/economic package (“contract”) of their community.  In cities that offer such passes – as is the case to take but one example in most cities in France that since the mid-seventies have had their own [[Carte Orange]] – the remainder of the funds needed to pay for these services comes from other sources (mainly in this case from employers, [[local government]]).

Social-justice advocacy groups, such as the [[Sweden|Swedish]] network [[Planka.nu]], see zero-fare public transport as an effort in the [[redistribution of wealth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planka.nu/eng|title=Free public transport - Planka.nu|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also argued that transportation to and from [[Employment|work]] is a necessary part of the work day, and is essential to the [[employer]] in the managing of work hours. It is thus argued that financing of public transportation should fall to employers rather than private citizens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://planka.nu/vad-tycker-vi/kollektivtrafik-ska-vara-avgiftsfri Planka.nu: Kollektivtrafik ska vara avgiftsfri] (Swedish)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and studies==
Dewolfe Barss was born in at the [[CBM Christian Medical Centre]], [[Pithapuram]]&lt;ref name="Dignity"/&gt; in 1939 and later schooled at the [[Kodaikanal International School]] in [[Tamil Nadu]].  For graduate studies in theology, Dewolfe moved to [[Canada]] where he took a [[B.A.]] in [[theology]] from the [[Acadia University]] in 1936.&lt;ref name="Dignity"/&gt;  In 1938, Dewolfe was ordained as a [[Baptist]] [[Pastor]] by the [[Canadian Baptist Ministries]] following which he returned to [[India]] to serve as a missionary in [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Odisha]].&lt;ref name="Dignity"/&gt;  After a decade of missionary service in [[India]], Dewolfe Barss upgraded his academics by enrolling in a [[Bachelor of Divinity]] programme at the [[Andover Newton Theological School]], [[Andover, Massachusetts|Andover]] during 1949&lt;ref name="Xiaoxin"/&gt;-1951&lt;ref name="Catalogue"/&gt; and again returned to [[India]] to resume his ecclesiastical responsibilities with the [[Canadian Baptist Ministries]].

==Ecclesiastical career==
When the [[Baptist Theological Seminary]], [[Kakinada]] was revived in 1975, Dewolfe Barss took up the Principalship of the Seminary and led the administration for two successive academic years following which the Seminary Council of the Baptist Theological Seminary appointed [[S. E. Krupa Rao]] in 1977 to take over the Principalship from Dewolfe Barss.  After serving in [[India]] until 1980, Barss settled down in [[Canada]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3580">'''Helen Barrett Tenney''' worked for the [[Comintern]] apparatus in the 1930s and funnelled information to the Soviet Union on behalf of the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Communists]] where she learned espionage tradecraft.

In 1942, Tenney worked for the [[New York City]]-based Short Wave Research, a company contracted to the [[Office of War Information]] to recruit persons knowledgeable in foreign languages.

In late summer of 1943, Tenney moved from New York to [[Washington, D.C.]] at the suggestion of [[Jacob Golos]] to obtain employment with the Spanish section of the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS). She moved into [[Mary Price]]'s former apartment which was used as a meeting point for government employees engaged in espionage and their Soviet case handlers and couriers.

Tenny began supplying reports and memoranda from OSS.  This information included a considerable quantity of data on activities of OSS personnel in virtually all sections and all countries around the world.  Tenney also supplied information concerning a monitoring station on [[Long Island]].

Beginning in 1944, Tenney was being paid a regular stipend of $50 per month — considerable for the times — which had been arranged through [[Joseph Katz]].  In December 1944, [[Joseph Gregg]] became Tenney's handler, however Tenney complained about his technique and Gregg was replaced by [[Inez Munoz]].

Tenney resigned from the OSS in June 1946 and transferred to the United States [[Department of State]].  By then the [[FBI]] had Tenney under surveillance. The State Department eased her out of her position and revoked her passport.  In January 1947, Tenney had a nervous breakdown.  She was confined to a psychiatric hospital for observation after a deadly combination of alcohol and [[phenobarbital]] which was regarded as a suicide attempt.  Tenney remained unconscious for five days and upon regaining consciousness, was in a delirium and regarded as in a severe hallucinatory psychotic state.  Her observers overheard Tenney mumbling about being followed, having her telephone tapped, having her friends under surveillance, and being a Russian spy.  She then appeared to have a violent phobia against everything Russian, even the mention of the word "Russian", and was watched closely for another suicide attempt.  Doctors, citing patient confidentiality, refused to discuss the case with FBI investigators.

By February 1946, unbeknownst to Tenney, her contact with Soviet intelligence [[Elizabeth Bentley]], had defected and was cooperating with the counterintelligence investigation. Bentley visited with Tenney and concluded that her suicide attempt was genuine; Tenney felt alone and isolated not knowing the larger Soviet espionage operation had been compromised and that the Soviet controllers had broken off contact with their American agents.  Tenney was unremorseful and appeared to wish to reestablish contact with Soviet handlers, dashing the FBI's hopes to gain her cooperation.

In June 1947, the FBI interviewed Tenney and determined she was in frail mental and physical health.

In 1998, Tenney was identified in the [[Venona project]] transcripts as code name "Muse", based on her transfer from the dismantled OSS to the Department of State.

{{Anthropology of kinship |concepts}}

An '''incest taboo ''' is any [[Convention (norm)|cultural rule]] or [[Norm (social)|norm]] that prohibits [[Human sexual activity|sexual relations]] between closely related persons. [[Cultural universal|All human cultures]] have norms that exclude certain close relatives from those considered suitable or permissible [[Sexual partner|sexual]] or [[marriage]] partners, making such relationships [[taboo]]. However, different norms exist among cultures as to which blood relations are permissible as sexual partners and which are not. The sexual relations between related persons which are subject to the taboo are called [[Incest|incestuous relationship]]s.

Some cultures proscribed sexual relations between [[clan]]-members, even when no traceable biological relationship exists, while members of other clans are permissible irrespective of the existence of a biological relationship. In many cultures, certain types of cousin relations are preferred as sexual and marital partners, whereas in others these are taboo. Some cultures permit sexual and marital relations between aunts/uncles and nephews/nieces. In some instances, brother–sister marriages have been practiced by the elites with some regularity. Parent–child and sibling–sibling unions are almost universally taboo.&lt;ref&gt;''The Tapestry of Culture An Introduction to Cultural Anthropology'', Ninth Edition, Abraham Rosman, Paula G. Rubel, Maxine Weisgrau, 2009, AltaMira Press. {{ISBN|9780759111394}}. p.101&lt;/ref&gt;

==Source of the taboo==
Debate about the origin of the incest taboo has often been framed as a question of whether it is based in [[nature or nurture]].

One explanation sees the incest taboo as a cultural implementation of a biologically evolved preference for sexual partners with whom one is unlikely to share genes, since [[inbreeding]] may have detrimental outcomes. The most widely held hypothesis proposes that the so-called [[Westermarck effect]] discourages adults from engaging in sexual relations with individuals with whom they grew up. The existence of the Westermarck effect has achieved some empirical support.&lt;ref name=WolfDurham2005&gt;''Inbreeding, Incest, and the Incest Taboo: The State of Knowledge at the Turn of the Century'', Arthur P. Wolf and William H. Durham (Editors),  Stanford University Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0804751414}}. Introduction&lt;/ref&gt;

Another school argues that the incest prohibition is a cultural construct which arises as a side effect of a general human preference for group [[exogamy]], which arises because intermarriage between groups construct valuable [[Alliance theory|alliances]] that improve the ability for both groups to thrive. According to this view, the incest taboo is not necessarily universal, but is likely to arise and become more strict under cultural circumstances that favour exogamy over [[endogamy]], and likely to become more lax under circumstances that favor endogamy. This hypothesis has also achieved some empirical support.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

===Limits to biological evolution of taboo===
While it is theoretically possible that [[natural selection]] may, under certain [[genetics|genetic]] circumstances, select for individuals that [[instinct]]ively avoid mating with (close) relatives, biological evolution cannot select for punishing others for incest, since even genetically weakened, [[inbreeding|inbred]] individuals are better watchposts against [[predator]]s than none at all, and weak individuals are useful for the stronger individuals in the group as looking out for predators without being able to seriously compete with the stronger individuals.&lt;ref&gt;E. O.

==Research on the taboo==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2016}}

Modern [[anthropology]] developed at a time when a great many human societies were illiterate, and much of the research on incest taboos has taken place in societies without legal codes, and, therefore, without written laws concerning marriage and incest. Nevertheless, anthropologists have found that the institution of marriage, and rules concerning appropriate and inappropriate sexual behavior, exist in every society.&lt;ref&gt;Marvin Harris 1997 ''Culture, People and Nature: An Introduction to General Anthropology'' 7th edition Longman pp. 250, 253&lt;/ref&gt; The following excerpt from ''Notes and Queries on Anthropology'' (1951), a well-established field manual for [[ethnographic]] research, illustrates the scope of ethnographic investigation into the matter:

{{quote|''Incest is sexual intercourse between individuals related in certain prohibited degrees of [[kinship]].'' In every society there are rules prohibiting incestuous unions, both as to sexual intercourse and recognized marriage. The two prohibitions do not necessarily coincide. There is no uniformity as to which degrees are involved in the prohibitions. The rules regulating incest must be investigated in every society by means of the [[Genealogical Method]]. The prohibition may be so narrow as to include only one type of parent–child relationship (though this is very rare), or those within the elementary family; or so wide as to include all with whom genealogical or classificatory kinship can be traced. The more usual practice is that unions with certain relatives only are considered incestuous, the relationships being regulated by the type of descent emphasized. In some societies unions with certain persons related by [[affinity (law)|affinity]] are also considered incestuous.

What penalties fall on (a) the individuals concerned; (b) the community as a whole? Are such penalties enforced by authority, or are they believed to ensure automatically by all action of supernatural force?  Is there any correlation between the severity of the penalty and the nearness of the blood-tie of the partners in guilt? Should children be born as the result of incestuous unions, how are they treated? Are there any methods, ritual or legal, by which persons who fall within the prohibited degrees and wish to marry can break the relationship and become free to marry?&lt;ref&gt;A Committee of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland, 1951. ''Notes and Queries on Anthropology'', 6th edition. London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, Ltd. p. 113–114&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As this excerpt suggests, anthropologists distinguish between social norms and actual social behavior; much social theory explores the difference and relationship between the two. For example, what is the purpose of prohibitions that are routinely violated (as for example when people claim that incest is taboo yet engage in incestuous behavior)?

It should be further noted that in these theories anthropologists are generally concerned solely with brother–sister incest, and are not claiming that all sexual relations among family members are taboo or even necessarily considered incestuous by that society. These theories are further complicated by the fact that in many societies people related to one another in different ways, and sometimes distantly, are classified together as siblings, and others who are just as closely related genetically are not considered family members.

Moreover, the definition restricts itself to sexual intercourse; this does not mean that other forms of sexual contact do not occur, or are proscribed, or prescribed. For example, in some Inuit societies in the Arctic, and traditionally in [[Bali]], mothers would routinely stroke the penises of their infant sons; such behavior was considered no more sexual than breast-feeding.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, Jean Louise ''Never in anger: portrait of an Eskimo family'' 1970 Harvard University Press, Cambridge (Mass.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Bateson, ''Steps to an ecology of mind: collected essays in anthropology, psychiatry, evolution, and epistemology'' preface by Mark Engel 1972 Chandler, San Francisco 112–115&lt;/ref&gt;

It should also be noted that, in these theories, anthropologists are primarily concerned with marriage rules and not actual sexual behavior. In short, anthropologists were not studying "incest" per se; they were asking informants what they meant by "incest", and what the consequences of "incest" were, in order to map out social relationships within the community.

This excerpt also suggests that the relationship between sexual and marriage practices is complex, and that societies distinguish between different sorts of prohibitions. In other words, although an individual may be prohibited from marrying or having sexual relations with many people, different sexual relations may be prohibited for different reasons, and with different penalties.

For example, [[Trobriand Islanders]] prohibit both sexual relations between a woman and her brother,&lt;ref&gt;Bronislow Malinowski 1929 ''The Sexual Life of Savages in North-West Melanesia: An Ethnographic Account of Courtship, Marriage and Family Life Among the Natives of the Trobriand Highlands, British New Guinea'' Boston: Beacon Press 389, 392&lt;/ref&gt; and between a woman and her father,&lt;ref name=Malinowski29&gt;Bronislaw Malinowski 1929 ''The Sexual Life of Savages in North-West Melanesia: An Ethnographic Account of Courtship, Marriage and Family Life Among the Natives of the Trobriand Highlands, British New Guinea'' Boston: Beacon Press 384&lt;/ref&gt; but they describe these prohibitions in very different ways: relations between a woman and her brother fall within the category of forbidden relations among members of the same clan; relations between a woman and her father do not.&lt;ref name=Malinowski29/&gt; This is because the Trobrianders are matrilineal; children belong to the clan of their mother and not of their father. Thus, sexual relations between a man and his mother's sister (and mother's sister's daughter) are also considered incestuous, but relations between a man and his father's sister are not.&lt;ref&gt;Bronislaw Malinowski 1929 ''The Sexual Life of Savages in North-West Melanesia: An Ethnographic Account of Courtship, Marriage and Family Life Among the Natives of the Trobriand Highlands, British New Guinea'' Boston: Beacon Press 450–451&lt;/ref&gt;  A man and his father's sister will often have a flirtatious relationship, and, far from being taboo, Trobriand society encourages a man and his father's sister or the daughter of his father's sister to have sexual relations or marry.&lt;ref&gt;Bronislaw Malinowski 1929 ''The Sexual Life of Savages in North-West Melanesia: An Ethnographic Account of Courtship, Marriage and Family Life Among the Natives of the Trobriand Highlands, British New Guinea'' Boston: Beacon Press 449–450&lt;/ref&gt;

===Instinctual and genetic explanations===
{{technical|section|date=August 2015}}
An explanation for the taboo is that it is due to an instinctual, inborn aversion that would lower the adverse [[Heredity|genetic effects]] of [[inbreeding]] such as a higher incidence of congenital [[birth defect]]s (see article [[Inbreeding depression]]). Since the rise of modern genetics, belief in this theory has grown.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, Richard 1977 "Natural Selection and the Analyusis of Human Sociology" in ''The Changing Scenes in the Natural Sciences, 1776–1976'' pp. 283–337 Academy of Natural Science Special Publication 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bittles | display-authors = etal  | year = 1991 | title = Reproductive Behavior and Health in Consangueneous Marriages | url = | journal = Science | volume = 2 | issue = 52| pages = 789–794 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="doi10.1038/ng1094-117"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bittles | first1 = A.

The increase in frequency of birth defects often attributed to inbreeding results directly from an increase in the frequency of homozygous alleles inherited by the offspring of inbred couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Livingstone | first1 = Frank B | year = 1969 | title = Genetics, Ecology, and the Origins of Incest and Exogamy | url = | journal = Current Anthropology | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 45–62 | doi=10.1086/201009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to an increase in homozygous allele frequency within a population, and results in diverging effects. Should a child inherit the version of homozygous alleles responsible for a birth defect from its parents, the birth defect will be expressed; on the other hand, should the child inherit the version of homozygous alleles not responsible for a birth defect, it would actually decrease the ratio of the allele version responsible for the birth defect in that population. The overall consequences of these diverging effects depends in part on the size of the population. In small populations, as long as children born with inheritable birth defects die (or are killed) before they reproduce, the ultimate effect of inbreeding will be to ''decrease'' the frequency of defective genes in the population; over time, the gene pool will be healthier. However, in larger populations, it is more likely that large numbers of carriers will survive and mate, leading to more constant rates of birth defects.&lt;ref&gt;Thornhill, Nancy, ed. 1993 ''The Natural History of Inbreeding and Outbreeding''. Chicago: UNiversity of Chicago Press&lt;/ref&gt; Besides recessive genes, there are also other reasons why inbreeding may be harmful, such as a narrow range of certain [[immune system]]s genes in a population increasing vulnerability to infectious diseases (see [[Major histocompatibility complex and sexual selection]]). The biological costs of incest also depend largely on the degree of genetic proximity between the two relatives engaging in incest. This fact may explain why the cultural taboo generally includes prohibitions against sex between close relatives but less often includes prohibitions against sex between more distal relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Antfolk|first1=Jan|last2=Lieberman|first2=Debra|last3=Santtila|first3=Pekka|title=Fitness Costs Predict Inbreeding Aversion Irrespective of Self-Involvement: Support for Hypotheses Derived from Evolutionary Theory|journal=PLoS ONE|date=2012|volume=7|issue=11|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0050613|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0050613|pages=e50613|pmid=23209792|pmc=3509093}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children born of close relatives have decreased survival.&lt;ref name="doi10.1038/ng1094-117"/&gt;&lt;ref name="moral"/&gt; Many mammal species, including humanity's closest [[primate]] relatives, avoid incest.&lt;ref name="WolfDurham2005"/&gt;

The [[Westermarck effect]], first proposed by [[Edvard Westermarck]] in 1891, is the theory that children reared together, regardless of biological relationship, form a sentimental attachment that is by its nature non-erotic.&lt;ref&gt;Westermarck, Edvard A. (1921). ''The history of human marriage'', 5th edn. London: Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt; [[Melford Spiro]] argued that his observations that unrelated children reared together on Israeli Kibbutzim nevertheless avoided one another as sexual partners confirmed the Westermarck effect.&lt;ref&gt;Spiro, M. (1965). Children of the Kibbutz. New York: Schocken.&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph Shepher in a study examined the second generation in a kibbutz and found no marriages and no sexual activity between the adolescents in the same peer group. This was not enforced but voluntary. Looking at the second generation adults in all kibbutzim, out of a total of 2769 marriages, none were between those of the same peer group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Shepher | first1 = J. | title = Mate selection among second generation kibbutz adolescents and adults: Incest avoidance and negative imprinting | doi = 10.1007/BF01638058 | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 1 | issue = 4 | pages = 293–307 | year = 1971 | pmid =  24179077| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to a book review by John Hartung of a book by Shepher, out of 2516 marriages documented in Israel, 200 were between couples reared in the same kibbutz. These marriages occurred after young adults reared on kibbutzim had served in the military and encountered tens of thousands of other potential mates, and 200 marriages is higher than what would be expected by chance. Of these 200 marriages, five were between men and women who had been reared together for the first six years of their lives, which would argue against the Westermarck effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hartung | first1 = John | year = 1985 | title = Review of ''Incest: A Biological View'' by J.

''Sexual attraction and childhood association: a Chinese
brief for Edward Westermarck''. Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another approach is looking at moral objections to third-party incest. This increases the longer a child has grown up together with another child of the opposite sex. This occurs even if the other child is genetically unrelated.&lt;ref name=moral/&gt; Humans have been argued to have a special kin detection system that besides the incest taboo also regulates a tendency towards [[altruism]] towards kin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lieberman | first1 = D. | last2 = Tooby | first2 = J. | last3 = Cosmides | first3 = L. | doi = 10.1038/nature05510 | title = The architecture of human kin detection | journal = Nature | volume = 445 | issue = 7129 | pages = 727–731 | year = 2007 | pmid =  17301784| pmc = 3581061}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One objection against an instinctive and genetic basis for the incest taboo is that incest does occur.&lt;ref&gt;Claude Lévi-Strauss, 1969 ''The Elementary Structures of Kinship'' revised edition, translated from the French by James Harle Bell and John Richard von Sturmer. Boston: Beacon Press. 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cicchetti and Carlson eds. 1989 ''Child Maltreatment: Theory and Research on the Causes and Consequences of Child Abuse and Neglect. New York, Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Glaser and Frosh 1988 ''Child and Sexual Abuse'' Chicago: Dorsey Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropologists have also argued that the social construct "incest" (and the incest taboo) is not the same thing as the biological phenomenon of "inbreeding". For example, there is equal genetic relation between a man and the daughter of his father's sister and between a man and the daughter of his mother's sister, such that biologists would consider mating incestuous in both instances, but Trobrianders consider mating incestuous in one case and not in the other. Anthropologists have documented a great number of societies where marriages between some first cousins are prohibited as incestuous, while marriages between other first cousins are encouraged. Therefore, it is argued that the prohibition against incestuous relations in most societies is not based on or motivated by concerns over biological closeness.&lt;ref&gt;Claude Lévi-Strauss, 1969 ''The Elementary Structures of Kinship'' revised edition, translated from the French by James Harle Bell and John Richard von Sturmer. Boston: Beacon Press. 13–14&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies on cousin marriages have found support for a biological basis for the taboo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kushnick | first1 = G. | last2 = Fessler | first2 = D.

===Sociological explanations===
[[Psychoanalytic theory]]—in particular, the claimed existence of an [[Oedipus complex]], which is not an instinctual aversion against incest but an instinctual desire—has influenced many theorists seeking to explain the incest taboo using sociological theories.&lt;ref name=WolfDurham2005/&gt;

====Exogamy====
The anthropologist [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] developed a general argument for the universality of the incest taboo in human societies. His argument begins with the claim that the incest taboo is in effect a prohibition against [[endogamy]], and the effect is to encourage [[exogamy]]. Through exogamy, otherwise unrelated households or lineages will form relationships through marriage, thus strengthening social solidarity. That is, Lévi-Strauss views marriage as an exchange of women between two social groups. This theory is based in part on [[Marcel Mauss]]'s theory of ''[[The Gift (book)|The Gift]]'', which (in Lévi-Strauss' words) argued:

{{quote|that exchange in primitive societies consists not so much in economic transactions as in reciprocal gifts, that these reciprocal gifts have a far more important function than in our own, and that this primitive form of exchange is not merely nor essentially of an economic nature but is what he aptly calls "a total social fact", that is, an event which has a significance that is at once social and religious, magic and economic, utilitarian and sentimental, jural and moral.&lt;ref&gt;Claude Lévi-Strauss, 1969 ''The Elementary Structures of Kinship'' revised edition, translated from the French by James Harle Bell and John Richard von Sturmer. Boston: Beacon Press. 52&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It is also based on Lévi-Strauss's analysis of data on different kinship systems and marriage practices documented by anthropologists and historians. Lévi-Strauss called attention specifically to data collected by [[Margaret Mead]] during her research among the [[Arapesh]]. When she asked if a man ever sleeps with his sister, Arapesh replied: "No we don't sleep with our sisters. We give our sisters to other men, and other men give us their sisters." Mead pressed the question repeatedly, asking what would happen if a brother and sister did have sex with one another. Lévi-Strauss quotes the Arapesh response:

{{quote|What, you would like to marry your sister? What is the matter with you anyway? Don't you want a brother-in-law? Don't you realize that if you marry another man's sister and another man marries your sister, you will have at least two brothers-in-law, while if you marry your own sister you will have none? With whom will you hunt, with whom will you garden, who will you visit?&lt;ref&gt;Claude Lévi-Strauss, 1969  ''The Elementary Structures of Kinship'' revised edition, translated from the French by James Harle Bell and John Richard von Sturmer. Boston: Beacon Press. 485&lt;/ref&gt;}}

By applying Mauss's theory to data such as Mead's, Lévi-Strauss proposed what he called [[alliance theory]]. He argued that, in "primitive" societies, marriage is not fundamentally a relationship between a man and a woman, but a transaction involving a woman that forges a relationship—an alliance—between two men.&lt;ref&gt;Claude Lévi-Strauss, 1969 ''The Elementary Structures of Kinship'' revised edition, translated from the French by James Harle Bell and John Richard von Sturmer. Boston: Beacon Press. 492-496&lt;/ref&gt; His ''Elementary Structures of Kinship'' takes this as a starting point and uses it to analyze kinship systems of increasing complexity found in so-called primitive societies (that is, those not based on agriculture, class inequalities, and centralized government).{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

This theory was debated intensely by anthropologists in the 1950s. It appealed to many because it used the study of incest taboos and marriage to answer more fundamental research interests of anthropologists at the time: how can an anthropologist map out the social relationships within a given community, and how do these relationships promote or endanger social solidarity?&lt;ref&gt;H. Befu "Social Exchange" in ''Annual Review of Anthropology'', Volume 6, Page 255–281, Oct 1977&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M.G. Peletz "Kinship Studies in Late Twentieth-Century Anthropology" in ''Annual Review of Anthropology.'' Volume 24, Page 343–372, Oct 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, anthropologists never reached a consensus, and with the [[Vietnam War]] and the process of [[decolonization]] in Africa, Asia, and Oceania, anthropological interests shifted away from mapping local social relationships.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Some anthropologists argue that nuclear family incest avoidance can be explained in terms of the ecological, demographic, and economic benefits of exogamy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Leavitt | first1 = Gregory | year = 1989 | title = Disappearance of the Incest Taboo | url = | journal = American Anthropologist | volume = 91 | issue = | pages = 116–131 | doi=10.1525/aa.1989.91.1.02a00070}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Lévi-Strauss generally discounted the relevance of alliance theory in Africa, a particularly strong concern for incest is a fundamental issue among the age systems of East Africa. Here, the avoidance between men of an age-set and their daughters is altogether more intense than in any other sexual avoidance. Paraphrasing Lévi-Strauss's argument, without this avoidance, the rivalries for power between age-sets, coupled with the close bonds of sharing between age-mates, could lead to a sharing of daughters as spouses. Young men entering the age system would then find a dire shortage of marriageable girls, and extended families would be in danger of dying out. Thus, by parading this avoidance of their daughters, senior men make these girls available for younger age-sets and their marriages form alliances that mitigate the rivalries for power.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, Paul. 1988. ''The Maasai of Matapato: a Study of Rituals of Rebellion'', Manchester University Press, Manchester.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Endogamy====
Exogamy between households or descent groups is typically prescribed in [[Classless society|classless societies]]. Societies that are stratified—that is, divided into unequal classes—often prescribe different degrees of endogamy. Endogamy is the opposite of exogamy; it refers to the practice of marriage between members of the same social group. A classic example is [[India]]'s [[caste system]], in which unequal castes are endogamous.&lt;ref&gt;Marvin Harris 1997 ''Culture, People and Nature: An Introduction to General Anthropology'' 7th edition Longman pp. 250, 311&lt;/ref&gt; Inequality between [[ethnic group]]s and [[Race (classification of humans)|races]] also correlates with endogamy.&lt;ref&gt;Marvin Harris 1997 ''Culture, People and Nature: An Introduction to General Anthropology'' 7th edition Longman pp. 317–318&lt;/ref&gt; Class, caste, ethnic, and racial endogamy typically coexists with family exogamy and prohibitions against incest.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

An extreme example of this principle, and an exception to the incest taboo, is found among members of the ruling class in certain ancient states, such as the Inca, Egypt, China, and Hawaii; brother–sister marriage (usually between half-siblings) was a means of maintaining wealth and political power within one family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bixler | first1 = Ray | year = 1982 | title = Comment on the Incidence and Purpose of Royal Sibling Incest | url = | journal = American Ethnologist | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = 580–582 | doi=10.1525/ae.1982.9.3.02a00100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars have argued that in Roman-governed Egypt this practice was also found among commoners,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Ashley | last = Jones | title = Incest in Ancient Egypt | url = http://cnersundergraduatejournal.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/incest_in_ancient_egypt_revised_.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Strong | first = Anise | title = Incest Laws and Absent Taboos in Roman Egypt | journal = Ancient History Bulletin | volume = 20 | year = 2006 | url = https://www.academia.edu/205164/Incest_Laws_and_Absent_Taboos_in_Roman_Egypt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lewis | first = N. | title = Life in Egypt under Roman Rule | isbn = 0-19-814848-8 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press|Clarendon Press]] | year = 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Frier |first=Bruce W. |last2=Bagnall |first2=Roger S. |author2-link=Roger S.

[[File:Japoneses no brasil.jpg|thumb|right|The first Japanese immigrants arrived in Brazil aboard the ''Kassato Maru''in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jornalorebate.com.br/59/pov.htm], ''Jornal Orebate''&lt;/ref&gt; They referred to themselves as ''Issei'' and became known as ''[[Nipo-Brasilieros]]''.]]
{{nihongo3|"first generation"|一世|'''Issei'''}} is a [[Japanese-language]] term used by ethnic Japanese in countries in [[North America]] and [[South America]] to specify the [[Japanese people]] who were the first generation to [[immigration|immigrate]] there. Issei are born in Japan; their children born in the new country are ''[[Nisei]]'' (''ni'' '2' + ''sei'' 'generation'); and their grandchildren are ''[[Sansei]]'' (''san'' '3').

The character and uniqueness of the ''Issei'' is recognized in its social history.&lt;ref&gt;Numrich, Paul David. (2008). North [https://books.google.com/books?id=sAy1s626lE0C&amp;pg=PA127&amp;lpg=PA110&amp;dq=  ''American Buddhists in Social Context'', p. 110].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The earliest organized group of Japanese emigrants settled in [[Mexico]] in 1897.&lt;ref name="mofa-Mexico"&gt;Ministry of Foreign Affairs: [http://www.mofa.go.jp/region/latin/mexico/index.html  ''Japan-Mexico Foreign Relations'']&lt;/ref&gt; In the 21st century, the four largest populations of diaspora Japanese and descendants of Japanese immigrants in the Western Hemisphere live in [[Brazil]], the [[United States]], [[Canada]], and [[Peru]].

===Brazilian ''Issei''===
{{main|Japanese Brazilians}}
Brazil is home to the largest ethnic Japanese population outside [[Japan]], numbering an estimated more than 1.5 million (including those of mixed-race or mixed-ethnicity).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mofa.go.jp/region/latin/brazil/index.html Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs - Japan-Brazil Relations]&lt;/ref&gt; more than that of the 1.2 million in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/IPTable?_bm=y&amp;-geo_id=01000US&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2005_EST_G00_S0201&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2005_EST_G00_S0201PR&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2005_EST_G00_S0201T&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2005_EST_G00_S0201TPR&amp;-reg=ACS_2005_EST_G00_S0201:041;ACS_2005_EST_G00_S0201PR:041;ACS_2005_EST_G00_S0201T:041;ACS_2005_EST_G00_S0201TPR:041&amp;-ds_name=ACS_2005_EST_G00_&amp;-_lang=en US Census data 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Issei'' Japanese Brazilians are an important part of that ethnic minority in that [[South America]]n nation.

===American ''Issei''===
{{main|Japanese Americans}}
The first members of the ''Issei'' did not emigrate directly to the mainland United States, but to [[Hawaii]] (when it was American-controlled but not yet one of the United States). These emigrants—the first of whom arrived on board the [[steamship]] ''[[City of Tokio]]'' in February 1885—were common laborers escaping hard times in Japan to work in Hawai'i. Their immigration was subsidized by the Hawaiian government, as cheap labor was needed for important commodity crops, especially its [[sugar plantation]]s. Numerous Japanese eventually settled in Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;Tate, E. Mowbray. (1986). [https://books.google.com/books?id=OuUvlfcIGRQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Transpacific+Steam&amp;source=gbs_summary_r&amp;cad=0#PPA8,M1 ''Transpacific Steam: The Story of Steam Navigation from the Pacific Coast of North America to the Far East and the Antipodes, 1867-1941''], p. 231&lt;/ref&gt;

Emigration of Japanese directly to the [[United States]] began in 1885, when "student-laborers" landed on the West Coast of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Sakata, Yasuo. (1992). ''Fading Footsteps of the Issei,'' p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest of these emigrated to [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]. Their numbers continually increased in the late 1880s and early 1890s. Their purpose in moving to America was to gain advanced knowledge and experience in order to develop the modern society at home. Both students and laborers were attracted by the image of the United States as a country that welcomed foreigners. When they first arrived in the U.S., they had not intended to live there permanently, but rather to learn from Americans and to take that knowledge back home. While they encountered discrimination, they also made opportunities, and many settled in California, and later in Washington and Oregon as well. 

===Canadian ''Issei''===
{{main|Japanese Canadians}}
Within Japanese-Canadian communities across Canada, three distinct subgroups developed, each with different socio-cultural referents, generational identity, and wartime experiences.&lt;ref name="mclellan36"&gt;McLellan, Janet. (1999).

New Series, Vol. 65, No. 1 (Feb., 1963), pp. 152-156.&lt;/ref&gt;  The narrative of ''Issei'' Japanese-Canadians include post-Pearl Harbor experiences of uprooting, incarceration, and dispersal of the pre-war Japanese-Canadian communities.&lt;ref&gt;Oiwa, Keibo and Joy Kogawa.

===Peruvian ''Issei''===
{{main|Japanese Peruvians}}
Among the approximately 80,000 Peruvians of Japanese descent, the ''Issei'' Japanese Peruvians comprise a small number. Former Peruvian President [[Alberto Fujimori]] was the ''Nisei'' son of ''Issei'' immigrants from [[Kumamoto, Kumamoto|Kumamoto]], [[Japan]].  Fujimori's political opponents tried unsuccessfully to prove that he was born in Japan. Persons must be native-born Peruvian citizens to qualify for the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/1065667.stm "Fujimori Secures Japanese Haven,"] BBC News. December 12, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural profile ==

=== Generations ===
Japanese-Americans and Japanese-Canadians have special names for each of their generations in North America. These are formed by combining one of the [[Japanese numbers]] corresponding to the [[generation]] with the Japanese word for generation (''sei'' 世). The Japanese-American and Japanese-Canadian communities have themselves distinguished their members with terms like ''Issei'', ''Nisei,'' and ''Sansei'' which describe the first, second and third generation of immigrants.&lt;ref name="IkawaFumiko" /&gt; The fourth generation is called ''Yonsei'' (四世) and the fifth is called  ''Gosei'' (五世).  

The ''Issei,'' ''Nisei'' and ''Sansei'' generations reflect distinctly different attitudes to authority, gender, involvement with non-Japanese, religious belief and practice, and other matters.&lt;ref&gt;McLellan, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NMm024458s4C&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=sansei+japanese+canadians&amp;lr=&amp;sig=ACfU3U19eRSR_W-IdoJTjJaAuhIOi6ihOA#PPA59,M1  p. 59.]&lt;/ref&gt;  The age when individuals faced the wartime evacuation and internment during World War II has been found to be the most significant factor that explains such variations in attitudes and behaviour patterns.&lt;ref name="mclellan36"/&gt;

The term ''[[Japanese diaspora|Nikkei]]'' (日系) was coined by a multinational group of sociologists. It encompasses all of the world's Japanese immigrants across generations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discovernikkei.org/en/what/ "What is Nikkei?"] Japanese American National Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;  The collective memory of the ''Issei'' and older ''Nisei'' was an image of [[Meiji Japan]] from 1870 through 1911. Newer immigrants carry much different memories of more recent Japan. These differing attitudes, social values and associations with Japan were often incompatible with each other.&lt;ref name="mclellan37"&gt;McLellan, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NMm024458s4C&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=sansei+japanese+canadians&amp;lr=&amp;sig=ACfU3U19eRSR_W-IdoJTjJaAuhIOi6ihOA#PPA37,M1  p. 37.]&lt;/ref&gt; The significant differences in post-war experiences and opportunities did nothing to mitigate the gaps which separated generational perspectives.

|}

In North America, since the redress victory in 1988, a significant evolutionary change has occurred.  The Nisei, their parents and their children are changing the way they look at themselves and their pattern of accommodation to the non-Japanese majority.&lt;ref&gt;McLellan, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NMm024458s4C&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=sansei+japanese+canadians&amp;lr=&amp;sig=ACfU3U19eRSR_W-IdoJTjJaAuhIOi6ihOA#PPA68,M1  p. 68.]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are just over one hundred thousand [[Japanese community in the United Kingdom|British Japanese]], mostly in [[London]]. Unlike other ''[[Japanese diaspora|Nikkei]]'' communities in the world, these Britons do not identify themselves in such generational terms as ''Issei,'' ''Nisei,'' or ''Sansei.''&lt;ref&gt;Itoh, [https://books.google.com/books?id=VBijCPLvWyUC&amp;pg=PA187&amp;dq=keiko+itoh++united+kingdom&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA7,M1  p. 7.]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Issei====
The first generation of immigrants, born in Japan before moving to Canada or the United States, is called ''Issei'' (一世).  In the 1930s, the term ''Issei'' came into common use, replacing the term "immigrant" (''ijusha'').  This new term illustrated a changed way of looking at themselves.  The term ''Issei'' represented the idea of beginning, a psychological transformation relating to being settled, having a distinctive community, and the idea of belonging to the new country.&lt;ref name="mclellan36"/&gt;

''Issei'' settled in close ethnic communities, and therefore did not learn English.  They endured great economic and social losses during the early years of World War II, and they were not able to rebuild their lost businesses and savings.  The external circumstances tended to reinforce the pattern of ''Issei'' being predominantly friends with other ''Issei.''&lt;ref name="mclellan36"/&gt;

Unlike their children, they tend to rely primarily on Japanese-language media (newspapers, television, movies), and in some senses, they tend to think of themselves as more Japanese than Canadian or American.&lt;ref name="mclellan36"/&gt;

=====''Issei'' women=====
''Issei'' women's lives were somewhat similar, despite differences in context, because they were structured within interlocking webs of patriarchal relationships, and that consistent subordination was experienced both as oppressive and as a source of happiness.&lt;ref&gt;Kobayashi, Audrey Lynn. [https://books.google.com/books?id=NzwjB4j0iZQC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=issei+japanese+canadians&amp;lr=&amp;sig=ACfU3U12E1f-Weid_02p0XlAWdutI6eGEg#PPR33,M1  ''Women, Work and Place,'' p. xxxiii.]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Issei'' women lived lives of transition which were affected by three common factors: the dominant ideology of late ''Meiji'' Japan, which advanced the economic objectives of the Japanese state; the patriarchal traditions of the agricultural village, which arose partly as a form of adjustment to national objectives and the adjustment to changes imposed by modernization; and the constraints which arose within a Canadian or American society dominated by racist ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Kobayashi, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NzwjB4j0iZQC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=issei+japanese+canadians&amp;lr=&amp;sig=ACfU3U12E1f-Weid_02p0XlAWdutI6eGEg#PPA45,M1  p. 45.]&lt;/ref&gt; Substantive evidence of the working lives of ''Issei'' women is very difficult to find, partly for lack of data and partly because the data that do exist are influenced by their implicit ideological definition of women.&lt;ref&gt;Kobayashi, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NzwjB4j0iZQC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=issei+japanese+canadians&amp;lr=&amp;sig=ACfU3U12E1f-Weid_02p0XlAWdutI6eGEg#PPA58,M1  p. 58.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the framework of environmental contradictions, the narratives of these women revealed a surprisingly shared sense of inevitability, a perception that the events of life are beyond the control of the individual, which accounts for the consistency in the way in which Issei women, different and individual in many ways, seem to have structured their emotions&lt;ref&gt;Kobayashi, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NzwjB4j0iZQC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=issei+japanese+canadians&amp;lr=&amp;sig=ACfU3U12E1f-Weid_02p0XlAWdutI6eGEg#PPA56,M1  p. 56.]&lt;/ref&gt;—and this quality of emotional control was passed to their ''Nisei'' children.

=====Aging=====
The ''[[kanreki]]'' (還暦), a traditional, pre-modern Japanese [[rite of passage]] to old age at 60, was sometimes celebrated by the ''Issei'' and is now being celebrated by increasing numbers of ''Nisei.'' Rituals are enactments of shared meanings, norms, and values; and this  Japanese rite of passage highlights a collective response among the Nisei to the conventional dilemmas of growing older.&lt;ref&gt;Doi, Mary L. [http://www.springerlink.com/content/mm006n8332478691/  "A Transformation of Ritual: The Nisei 60th Birthday."] ''Journal Journal of Cross-Cultural Gerontology.'' Vol. 6, No. 2 (April, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese American [[photographer]] and former [[social worker]] [[Mary Koga]] documented members of her parents' generation in their twilight years. Her ''Portrait of the Issei in [[Illinois]]'' series shows Koga at ease with these people in a relaxed atmosphere.

==History==
The experience of emigrants is inevitably affected by a range of factors directly related to the Japanese society they left behind.  As immigrants, the conflicts between the old country and the new played out in unique ways for each individual, and yet common elements do begin to appear in the history of the Japanese Canadian and Japanese American communities.

===Emigrants from Japan===
Japan was a closed country for more than two centuries, 1636 to 1853, since military rulers from the [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa]] family wanted to keep foreigners away from Japanese society.&lt;ref&gt;Spickard, Paul R. (1997). ''Japanese Americans: The Formation and Transformations of an Ethnic Group,'' p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The only exceptions were [[Chinese people|Chinese]] and some [[Dutch (ethnic group)|Dutch]], but even they were discouraged from associating with Japanese [[Citizenship|citizens]]. Also, it was strictly prohibited by law for ordinary Japanese citizens to go abroad. Change came around the early 19th century when the visit of an American fleet commanded by [[Matthew C. Perry|Commodore Perry]] caused the new Japanese government to replace the Tokugawa system of economics and politics during the [[Meiji era]] in order to open its door to trade and contact with the outside world.

After 1866, the new Japanese government decided to send students and laborers to the U.S. in order to bring back the knowledge and experience necessary for the nation to grow strong.&lt;ref name="tamuraxxxvii"&gt;Tamura, Linda. (1998). [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ju-xQV-gGIMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=issei&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;source=gbs_summary_r&amp;cad=0#PPR37,M1  ''The Hood River Issei: An Oral History of Japanese Settlers in Oregon's Hood River Valley,'' p. xxxvii.]&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1884, emigration of working classes was permitted; and the first issei began to arrive in North and South America soon after.  For example, in 1890, only 25 Issei lived in Oregon.  By 1891, 1,000 Japanese lived in Oregon. In 1900, 2,051 Japanese had come to live in Oregon.&lt;ref name="tamuraxxxvii"/&gt;  By 1915, Japanese men with savings of $800 were considered eligible to summon wives from Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Tamura, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ju-xQV-gGIMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=issei&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;source=gbs_summary_r&amp;cad=0#PPR38,M1  p. xxxviii.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immigrants in America===
{{main|History of Japanese Americans|Japanese-American life before World War II|Japanese-American life after World War II}}
Few Japanese workers came to North America intending to become immigrants. Initially, most of them came with vague plans for gaining new experiences and for making some money before returning to homes in Japan.  This group of workers was overwhelmingly male. Many ''Issei'' arrived as laborers.  They worked in employment sectors such as agriculture, mining, and railroad construction.

The Issei were born in Japan, and their cultural perspective was primarily Japanese; but they were in America by choice.  Despite a certain nostalgia for the old country, they had created homes in a country far from Japan.  If they had not been prohibited from becoming citizens, many would have become citizens of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Yenne, Bill. (2007). [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ok3JZw28xhEC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=issei&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=ACfU3U2JXjxtiwBCtH0UYVFMwH-8lWGkFA#PPP23,M1  ''Rising Sons: The Japanese American GIs Who Fought for the United States in World War II,'' p. xv.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1913, California's Alien Land Law prohibited non-citizens from owning land in the state, and several other states soon after passed their own restrictive [[alien land laws]].  This included the ''Issei'', Japanese residents born in Japan, but not their children, the Nisei, who were born in United States or Hawaii, and who therefore were American citizens by birth.  Many of the Issei responded to the law by transferring title to their land to their ''Nisei'' children.&lt;ref&gt;Yenne, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ok3JZw28xhEC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=issei&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=ACfU3U2JXjxtiwBCtH0UYVFMwH-8lWGkFA#PPA12,M1  p. 12.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Americans' first impression of Issei===
Americans generally viewed the ''Issei'' as a crude, ill-educated lot.&lt;ref&gt;Spickard, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Possible reasons for this may be the fact that most Japanese were forced to work in menial jobs in the U.S., such as farming. Many Issei were in fact better educated than either the Japanese or American public. Sixty percent had completed middle school, and 21 percent were high school graduates. {{citation needed|reason=No citation is given for Issei being well-educated, the numbers on their education.|date=August 2018}}

Whether Christian, Buddhists, or nonbelievers, the ''Issei'' almost never caused trouble in the civil authority. The arrest rate for the ''Issei'' from 1902 to the 1960s was relatively lower than for any other major ethnic group in California.&lt;ref&gt;Spickard, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; The only exceptions were that some young ''Issei'' committed crimes relating to gambling and prostitution{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}, which stemmed from different cultural morals in Japan.

===Racial segregation and immigration law===
{{main|Anti-Japanese sentiment in the United States}}
The post-1900 cause to renew the [[Chinese Exclusion Act (United States)|Chinese Exclusion Act]] became generalized protests against all [[Asian people|Asian]] immigrants, including the Issei.&lt;ref&gt;Mercier, Laurie ''et al.'' [http://www.vancouver.wsu.edu/crbeha/ja/ja.htm "Historical overview,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513165141/http://www.vancouver.wsu.edu/crbeha/ja/ja.htm |date=2008-05-13 }} ''Japanese Americans In the Columbia River Basin,'' Washington State University web project.&lt;/ref&gt; Since many Chinese immigrants left the U.S., hostility fell on the ''Issei.'' American labor organizations took an initiative in spreading [[Anti-Japanese sentiment]]. [[White American]]s wanted to exclude them since they did not want any Asians to take their jobs away. As a result, they formed the [[Asiatic Exclusion League]] that viewed Japanese and Chinese as a threat of American workers. The protest of the league involved picketing and beatings of the Issei. In October 1906, amid this anti-Japanese milieu, the San Francisco School Board, carrying out a campaign promise of the mayor, ordered all Japanese and [[Koreans|Korean]] pupils to join the Chinese students at a [[Racial segregation|segregated]] school.&lt;ref name=densho&gt;{{citation| last=Densho and The Board of Trustees of The Leland Stanford Junior University| title=Reading: The Issei immigrants and Civil Rights| url=http://www.densho.org/learning/spice/lesson2/2reading2.asp| accessdate=2008-04-25| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080417110939/http://www.densho.org/learning/spice/lesson2/2reading2.asp| archivedate=2008-04-17| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Issei'' were displeased with the situation and some reported to Japanese newspapers. This caused the Japanese government to protest against the former [[President of the United States|President]], [[Theodore Roosevelt]], and as a result, they signed the [[Gentlemen's Agreement of 1907]]. This agreement led the period of settling and family building to come.

By 1911, almost half of the Japanese immigrants were women who landed in the U.S. to reunite with their husbands. After the Gentleman's agreement, a number of ''Nisei'', the second-generation Japanese, were born in California. Yet, it did not stop some white Americans from segregating Japanese immigrants. The ''Issei'' were a role model of American citizens by being hardworking, law-abiding, devoted to family and the community. However, some Americans did not want to admit the virtues of the ''Issei.''

The [[Immigration Act of 1924]] represented the Issei's failed struggle against the segregation. The experiences of the Issei extend from well before the period before July 1, 1924, when the Japanese Exclusion Act came into effect.&lt;ref&gt;Kirmura, Yukiko. (1988). [http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED344810&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED344810  ''Issei: Japanese Immigrants in Hawaii,'' (abstract).]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Issei,'' however, were very good at enhancing rice farming on "unusable" land. Japanese Californian farmers made rice a major crop of the state. The largest ''Issei'' community settled around [[Vacaville, California]], near [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]].

===Internment===
{{main|Japanese Canadian internment|Internment of Japanese Americans|Japanese Peruvian#World War II}}
When the Canadian and American governments interned West Coast Japanese in 1942, neither distinguished between those who were citizens (''Nisei'') and their non-citizen parents (''Issei'').&lt;ref&gt;Dinnerstein, Leonard ''et al.'' (1999). [https://books.google.com/books?id=cOFDhehJ68gC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Ethnic+Americans&amp;sig=ACfU3U1Pi3leXPmhmGdRB8CMOZjaZWxCGQ#PPA181,M1  ''Ethnic Americans: A History of Immigration,'' p. 181.]&lt;/ref&gt;  When the apology and redress for injustices were enacted by the American Congress and the Canadian Parliament in 1988, most of the ''Issei'' were dead, or too old for it to make any significant difference in lives that had been disrupted.

The number of ''issei'' who have earned some degree of public recognition has continued to increase over time; but the quiet lives of those whose names are known only to family and friends are no less important in understanding the broader narrative of the ''nikkei.''  Although the names highlighted here are over-represented by ''issei'' from North America, the Latin American member countries of the [[Pan American Nikkei Association]] (PANA) include [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[Mexico]], [[Paraguay]], [[Peru]] and [[Uruguay]], in addition to the English-speaking  [[United States]] and [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;National Association of Japanese Canadians: [http://www.najc.ca/thenandnow/relations_pana.php PANA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218195725/http://www.najc.ca/thenandnow/relations_pana.php |date=2009-02-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Koningsdag''''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈkoːnɪŋzdɑx|-|Nl-Koningsdag.ogg}}) or '''King's Day''' is a [[public holiday|national holiday]] in the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]]. Celebrated on 27 April (26 April if the 27th is a Sunday), the date marks the birth of [[King Willem-Alexander]].&lt;ref name="BWBR0032908"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0032908/geldigheidsdatum_01-01-2014|title=Besluit vaststelling en aanduiding zevenentwintigste april als Koningsdag|id=BWBR0032908|language=nl|date=30 April 2013|authorlink=Ministry of General Affairs|author=AZ}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Until the [[abdication]] of [[Queen Beatrix]] in 2013, the holiday was known as '''''Koninginnedag''''' ({{IPA-nl|ˌkoːnɪŋˈɪnədɑx|-|Nl-koninginnedag.ogg}}) or '''Queen's Day''' and was celebrated on 30 April.

The holiday was initially observed on 31 August 1885 as ''Prinsessedag'' or Princess's Day, the fifth birthday of [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Princess Wilhelmina]], then [[heir presumptive]] to the Dutch throne. On her accession in November 1890 the holiday acquired the name ''Koninginnedag'', first celebrated on 31 August 1891. In September 1948, Wilhelmina's daughter [[Juliana of the Netherlands|Juliana]] ascended to the throne and the holiday was moved to her birthday, 30 April. The holiday was celebrated on this date from 1949.

Juliana's daughter, Beatrix, retained the celebration on 30 April after she ascended the throne in 1980, though her birthday was on 31 January.&lt;ref name="BWBR0031338"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0031338/geldigheidsdatum_01-05-2002|title=Besluit aanduiding van de dertigste april als Koninginnedag|id=BWBR0031338|language=nl|date=24 April 1980|authorlink=Ministry of General Affairs|author=AZ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beatrix altered her mother's custom of receiving a floral parade at [[Soestdijk Palace]], instead choosing to visit different Dutch towns each year and join in the festivities with her children. In 2009, the Queen was celebrating Queen's Day in the city of [[Apeldoorn]] when [[2009 attack on the Dutch royal family|a man attempted to attack her]] by trying to ram the Royal family's bus with his car; instead he drove into a crowd of people and crashed into a monument: seven people in the crowd were killed, as was the driver.   Queen Beatrix abdicated on ''Koninginnedag'' 2013, and her son, Willem-Alexander, ascended the throne (the first king since the observance of the national holiday). As a result, the holiday became known as ''Koningsdag'' from 2014 on, and the celebration was shifted three days back to 27 April, the King's birthday.

''Koningsdag'' is known for its nationwide ''vrijmarkt'' ("free market"), at which the Dutch sell their used items. It is also an opportunity for "orange madness" or ''[[oranjegekte]]'', a kind of frenzy named for the national colour.

[[File:Oranjefeestvreugde in Amsterdam.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=3|right|''Koninginnedag'' on 31 August 1932 in Amsterdam]]

Faced with an unpopular monarchy, in the 1880s the [[Liberal Union (Netherlands)|liberals]] in Dutch government sought a means of promoting national unity.&lt;ref name="nu" /&gt; King [[William III of the Netherlands|William III]] was disliked, but his four-year-old daughter [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Princess Wilhelmina]] was not.&lt;ref name="mag" /&gt; A holiday honouring King William had been intermittently held on his birthday, and  J. W. R. Gerlach, editor of the newspaper ''Utrechts Provinciaal en Stedelijk Dagblad'', proposed that the princess's birthday be observed as an opportunity for patriotic celebration and national reconciliation.&lt;ref name="dag"&gt;{{Cite book

The young princess was paraded through the streets, waving to the crowds.&lt;ref name="mag" /&gt; The first observance occurred only in [[Utrecht]], but other municipalities quickly began to observe it, organizing activities for children.&lt;ref name="dag" /&gt; Further processions were held in the following years, and when Wilhelmina inherited the throne in 1890, ''Prinsessedag'' was renamed ''Koninginnedag'', or Queen's Day.&lt;ref name="mag" /&gt; By then almost every Dutch town and city was marking the holiday.&lt;ref name="dag" /&gt;

The celebration proved popular, and when the Queen came of age in 1898, her inauguration was postponed a week to 6 September so as not to interfere with ''Koninginnedag''.&lt;ref name="plan"&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[German occupation of the Netherlands]] during World War II, ''Koninginnedag'' celebrations were banned, and members of the Orange Committees, which organize the holiday events, destroyed their records for fear of German reprisals.&lt;ref name="plan" /&gt;

===Juliana (1948–1980)===
[[File:Arnhem Parade 30 april B.jpg|thumb|thumbtime=3|thumb|right|Military parade in [[Arnhem]], ''Koninginnedag'' 1958]]
Another summertime birthday celebration in the Netherlands was that of Wilhelmina's mother, [[Emma of the Netherlands|Queen-Regent Emma]], who after Wilhelmina attained adulthood generally spent her own birthday, 2 August, at [[Soestdijk Palace]] in [[Baarn]].  Until her death in 1934, Emma received [[Bloemencorso|an annual floral tribute]] from the townsfolk on her birthday.  In 1937 Wilhelmina's daughter and heiress, [[Juliana of the Netherlands|Princess Juliana]], took up residence at Soestdijk Palace following her marriage, and the townsfolk made their floral presentation to her, moving the date to Juliana's birthday, 30 April.&lt;ref name="old" /&gt; In September 1948 Juliana ascended to the Dutch throne and from 1949 onwards ''Koninginnedag'' was on her birthday.&lt;ref name="man"&gt;{{cite news

The first observance of the holiday on the new date included a huge circus at the [[Olympic Stadium (Amsterdam)|Amsterdam Olympic Stadium]]—one not attended by the royal family, who remained at Soestdijk Palace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schorr|first=Danel L.

The parade became televised in the 1950s, and ''Koninginnedag'' increasingly became a national holiday, with workers given the day off.&lt;ref name="nu" /&gt; Juliana had a reputation as a "queen of the people", and according to Peek, "it felt as if she invited her subjects to the royal home".&lt;ref name="mag" /&gt;

In early 1966 Juliana's eldest daughter, Princess Beatrix, married [[Prince Claus of the Netherlands|Klaus-Georg von Amsberg]]. The marriage was controversial because the new Prince Claus (as he was dubbed) was a German, and Claus himself had served in the [[Wehrmacht|German Army]] during the war.  Anti-German riots in Amsterdam marred the wedding day and the following observances of ''Koninginnedag''.  Fearing further demonstrations on the holiday, government officials decided to open Amsterdam city centre to the ''vrijmarkt'' ("free market") that had long been held on ''Koninginnedag'' in the outskirts of town, principally for children. The ''vrijmarkt'' occupied the space where demonstrations might have been held, and began a new custom.&lt;ref name="mag" /&gt;

===Beatrix (1980–2013)===
[[File:Beatrixscheveningen2005.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Beatrix of the Netherlands|Queen Beatrix]] speaks with the mayor of [[The Hague]], [[Wim Deetman]] in [[Scheveningen]], ''Koninginnedag'' 2005.]]
When [[Beatrix of the Netherlands|Queen Beatrix]] succeeded her mother Juliana on the latter's abdication on 30 April 1980, the new queen decided to keep the holiday on 30 April as a tribute to her mother.&lt;ref name="BWBR0031338"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nu"/&gt; (If 30 April fell on a Sunday, ''Koninginnedag'' was observed the previous day—this occurred most recently in 2006.&lt;ref name="joel"&gt;{{Cite news

''Koninginnedag'' celebrations have sometimes been affected or disrupted.  In 1988 three British servicemen stationed in Germany who were in the Netherlands for ''Koninginnedag'' were killed in [[Irish Republican Army]] attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Raines|first=Howell

On 30 April 2009, Beatrix and other members of the royal family were at the town of [[Apeldoorn]] when a 38-year-old man, Karst Tates, [[2009 attack on the Dutch royal family|drove his Suzuki Swift automobile into the crowd]], narrowly missing the open-top bus the royal family members were riding on.&lt;ref name="mag" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCreport"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8026807.stm | title = Car crash into Dutch Queen parade | publisher = BBC | date = 30 April 2009|accessdate = 1 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Seven people were killed and further celebrations were cancelled.&lt;ref name="BBCreport" /&gt; Tates died of injuries sustained in the attack soon afterwards and his exact motives remain unclear, though it appears his target was the royal family.&lt;ref name="mag" /&gt; The incident provoked questions about whether the royal family should continue to participate in the celebrations.  However, Beatrix indicated that the tragedy would not stop her from meeting her people.&lt;ref name="nick" /&gt; In 2010, Beatrix and her family visited  [[Wemeldinge]] and [[Middelburg]], in [[Zeeland]] province.  There were no incidents, and afterwards, the Queen thanked Zeeland for giving ''Koninginnedag'' back to her family, and to her country.&lt;ref name="mag"/&gt;

On 30 April 2013, Queen's Day, [[Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands|Willem-Alexander]] succeeded his mother [[Beatrix of the Netherlands|Beatrix]] and became the first King of the Netherlands in 123 years. Consequently, from 2014 onwards the name has been changed from Queen's Day to King's Day. The date has also changed from 30 to 27 April, which is the birthday of Willem-Alexander.&lt;ref name="BWBR0032908"/&gt; On the first King's Day – held on 26 April 2014 because 27 April 2014 was a Sunday – the king visited [[De Rijp]] and [[Amstelveen]] (originally planned to be visited by Queen Beatrix in 2013, but postponed due to her abdication).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2013/01/28/koninginnedag-wordt-koiningsdag-en-is-voortaan-op-27-april/ |author=Anouk Eigenraam |title=Koninginnedag wordt Koningsdag en is voortaan op 27 april |language=Dutch |newspaper=NRC Handelsblad |date=28 January 2013 |access-date=29 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
The festivities on ''Koningsdag'' are often organised by Orange Committees (Dutch:  ''Oranjecomité''), local associations&lt;ref name="nu" /&gt; that seek sponsorship and donations for their activities.  In recent years some committees have had difficulty in recruiting new members from among the younger Dutch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Flea market===
[[File:Koninginnedag 2011 Deventer.jpg|thumb|''Vrijmarkt'', ''Koninginnedag'' 2011, [[Deventer]]]]
The ''vrijmarkt'' (literally 'free market') is a nationwide [[flea market]], at which many people sell their [[used good]]s. ''Koningsdag'' is the one day of the year that the Dutch government permits sales on the street without a permit and without the payment of [[value added tax]].&lt;ref name="tnt"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chack|first=Erin

Among the most popular areas for the ''vrijmarkt'' in Amsterdam is the [[Jordaan]] quarter, but the wide Apollolaan in front of the Hilton hotel in southern Amsterdam is gaining in popularity.  Children sell their cast-off toys or garments at the [[Vondelpark]], also in southern Amsterdam, and in a spirit of fun passers-by often offer the young sellers more than they are asking for the goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

===Festivities===
''Koningsdag'' now sees large-scale celebrations, with many concerts and special events in public spaces, particularly in Amsterdam. An outdoor concert is held on Amsterdam's [[Museumplein]], where as many as 800,000&amp;nbsp;people may gather. To aid visitors in returning home by train after the festivities outdoor events must end by 20:00, and the Museumplein show by 21:00.&lt;ref name="dutchnews" /&gt; The city centre is closed to cars, and no trams ride in the heart of the city; people are urged to avoid [[Amsterdam Centraal railway station]] and use other stations if possible from their direction. International trains that normally begin or terminate at Amsterdam Centraal are instead directed to a suburban stop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

While King's Day celebrations take place throughout the Netherlands, Amsterdam is a popular destination for many revellers.  Often the city's 750.000 residents are joined by up to 1 million visitors.  In recent years Amsterdam authorities have taken some measures to try to stem the flow of visitors as the city became too crowded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Those taking part in ''Koningsdag'' commonly dye their hair orange or wear orange clothing in honour of the [[House of Orange-Nassau]], which rules over the Netherlands.  Orange-coloured drinks are also popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

  | accessdate = 1 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;   This colour choice is sometimes dubbed "orange madness", or in Dutch, ''[[oranjegekte]]''.&lt;ref name="nick" /&gt; A local Orange Committee member said of ''Koninginnedag'' in 2011:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Friendships—and community—will be formed.  For me that’s really what Queen’s Day is all about. It’s not an outburst of patriotism, it’s not even about the popularity of the royal family. It’s about a sense of belonging. For one day, everybody is the same in Holland. Bright orange and barmy.&lt;ref name="plan" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Children celebrate with a variety of games including ''koekhappen'' (in which they catch spice cake dangling from a string in their mouths) and ''spijker poepen'' (in which they tie string around their waist a nail dangling at one end, which they attempt to lower into a glass bottle).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/europe/04/22/netherlands.queens.day/|title=Queen's Day: Go Dutch for an alternative royal celebration - CNN.com|last=Thompson|first=Nick|date=25 April 2011|work=[[CNN]]|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Honours===
''Koningsdag'' is an opportunity for the monarch to honour citizens for their service to the Netherlands. In 2011, Queen Beatrix issued an honours list noting the work of 3,357&amp;nbsp;people, most of whom became members of the [[Order of Orange-Nassau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

  | accessdate = 1 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Observance in Netherlands territories outside Europe==
''Koningsdag'' is also celebrated in [[Aruba]], [[Curaçao]], and [[Sint Maarten]], constituent countries of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]].&lt;ref name="nick" /&gt; It is less widely celebrated on the Caribbean island of [[Bonaire]], also a part of the Kingdom, where the local celebration of Dia di Rincon (held on 30 April) is more popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Former French President [[Francois Hollande]] has been quoted by an article on a French [[Mediapart]], an online investigative and opinion journal as stating that the Indian government had asked the French government to nominate Anil Ambani's Reliance Defence Ltd. as its India partner in the Rafale deal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/indian-government-wanted-anil-ambani-as-rafale-partner-francois-hollande-1920227 India Government Chose Anil Ambani For Rafale, Says Francois Hollande: 10 Facts&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ex-french-president-hollande-makes-stunning-claim-on-rafale-deal-mod-says-govt-had-no-role-in-commercial-decision/articleshow/65903020.cms Ex-French President Hollande reportedly makes new claim on Rafale deal, MoD says 'govt had no role in commercial decision' | India News - Times of India&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Contradicting Hollande's claim, French government issued a statement mentioning that  French companies have the full freedom to select Indian firms for the Rafale contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=ibn |title=ibn |url=https://www.news18.com/news/india/after-hollandes-bombshell-french-govt-says-not-involved-in-choice-of-indian-partners-for-rafale-deal-1885361.html?ref=hp_top_pos_2 |accessdate=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dassault also clarified that Anil Ambani was Dassault Aviation’s choice&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=indiatimes |title=rafael |url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/rafale-controversy-france-dassault-aviation-denies-involvement-in-choosing-indian-partners/articleshow/65908715.cms |accessdate=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Dassault's CEO Eric Trappier also said in an interview with z-news that the selection of Reliance Defense Ltd was done by  [[Dassault Aviation]] and it was not forced by Indan government. He also added that  this new deal was 9% cheaper (per fighter) compared to the previous (unsuccessful) deal in 2012 (UPA government).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuhFUXwIMhw|title=YouTube|website=www.youtube.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Murui Huitoto''' - (or simply '''Murui''' also known as '''Bue''', '''Witoto Murui''' or '''Witoto''') is an indigenous American Huitoto language of the [[Witotoan languages|Witotoan family]]. Murui is spoken by about 1,100 Murui people along the banks of the [[Putumayo River|Putumayo]], Cara-Paraná and Igara-Paraná rivers in Colombia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://observatorioetnicocecoin.org.co/cecoin/files/Uitoto%20%28Murui%29%20-%20PLAN%20DE%20VIDA%20-%20OIMA.pdf Plan de vida del Pueblo Murui: Jurisdicción OIMA]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Peru]] it spoken in the North alongside the Ampiyacu and [[Napo River|Napo]] rivers by some 1,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=huu Ethnologue report for language code:huu&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Some Murui speakers live also outside their territories, for instance the vicinity of [[Leticia, Amazonas]], Colombia.

Approximately 1,000 [[Peruvians]] use Murui in both its written and oral forms. The language is accorded official status and is used in schools. It is also used in [[church (building)|churches]]. There are no Murui-an monolinguals in [[Peru]]: speakers of the language who do not also use another language. The language has 1,900 speakers in southwestern [[Colombia]] where it has higher social utility and standing. It was formerly spoken in [[Brazil]], but is now extinct in that country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/language/huu Ethnologue Murui]&lt;/ref&gt;

Murui uses the Roman Script. There is a dictionary of the Murui language (Murui-Spanish and Spanish-Murui) compiled by an SIL linguist, Shirley Burtch (1983), and number of works concerning its grammar (Petersen de Piñeros 1994, Petersen de Piñeros &amp; Patiño: 2000, Wojtylak 2012).

Currently, a PhD student at [[James Cook University]], [[Katarzyna Wojtylak]] is working on a comprehensive grammar of Murui to be published in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.als.asn.au/newsletters/alsnews201302.html Australian Linguistic Society Newsletter Feb 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonology==
Murui has a relatively small inventory of 16 contrastive consonantal phonemes some of which have restricted phonotactics. Murui consonant inventory is similar to two other dialects of Witoto, Mɨka and Mɨnɨka.The vowel inventory of the language is based on a six vowel system that consist of, among other sounds, the high central vowel ɨ. This trait is typical for languages from Northwest  Amazonia, such as Tucanoan and Carib languages (Aikhenvald, 2012).

==Morphosyntax==

Murui is highly synthetic, predominantly suffixing and nominative-accusative. The language is predominantly verb-final; the organization of the constituents in the clause is usually SV/AOV. Grammatical relations are expressed through pronouns cross-referencing on the verb (with one cross-referencing position: the subject S/A). Syntactic functions can be expressed through case markers. Marking of core arguments (S, A, O = non S/A focus) is generally optional and is related to focus; marking of peripheral arguments on an NP (i.e. [[locative]], [[ablative]], commitative-instrumental, [[benefactive]], privative) is usually mandatory. 	

Murui has three open lexical classes ([[nouns]], [[verbs]] and derived adjectives (that can also be referred to as 'descriptive verbs'). Closed classes of words are underived adjectives and quantifiers, adverbs, pronouns, demonstratives, anaphoric forms, interrogative words, low (1 and 2) and lexicalized (3 &lt; 20) number words, connectives, adpositions, interjections and onomatopoeic forms.

The majority of the word classes can occupy the predicate slot but there are restrictions as to what kind of sets of suffixes can be attached to non-verbs. Quantifiers, connectives, adpositions, interjections and onomatopoeic forms cannot function predicatively.

One of the most salient characteristics of the nominal morphology of Murui is a large multiple [[classifier (linguistics)|classifier]] system that consists of at least 80 classifiers.  The same (or almost the same) classifier form can be used in a variety of morphosyntactic contexts (hence the label 'multiple classifier system'). The system is semi-open due to the occurrence of repeaters (partially repeated nouns that occur in classifier slots). All types of classifiers are bound suffixes that can be either mono- or disyllabic.

==Orthography==
Throughout the years, the existing phonological analyses of the language have come to reflect different spelling variations with various graphemes used to describe the Witoto sounds. The first to analyze and describe the sound system of Witoto Mɨnɨka was Minor Eugene (Minor 1956). This description was fundamental to the development of the language orthography. Nowadays, there is a tendency to use graphemes introduced by Petersen de Piñeros (1994). Wojtylak (2012, 2014) uses slightly modified spellings.

(a) '''A person who Currently holds citizenship of Nepal''', who may or may not have acquired a citizenship of another country(s), who currently does not reside in Nepal for various reason.

(b) '''A Former Nepalese Citizen''' ('''भुतपूर्व''' '''नेपाली नागरिक'''/"Bhutpurba Nepali Nāgarik") means a person who once held a Nepalese citizenship (By birth, ancestry blood rights or by other means) and has denounced (legally) his/her Nepalese Citizenship.

(c) '''Foreign citizen of Nepalese origin''' ('''नेपाली मूलको विदेशी नागरिक'''/"Nepali Mulko Bideshi Nāgarik") means a person who him/herself or whose father, mother, grandfather or grandmother was/were a citizen of Nepal at any time and has subsequently acquired the citizenship of any other foreign country other than a member country of the South Asian Association of Regional Co-operation (SAARC).

(d) '''Nepali citizen residing abroad''' ('''आप्रवासी नेपाली'''/"Aaprabashi Nepali") means a Nepali citizen who has been residing in any foreign country for at least two years by doing any profession, occupation, business and employment except a Nepalese citizen residing in a member country of SAARC or serving in a diplomatic mission or consulate situated in a foreign country under the assignment of the Government of Nepal.

(e) '''Person of Nepali origin''' is a person of Nepali origin or ancestry who was or whose ancestors were born in Nepal or  other nations with Nepalese ancestry but is not a citizen of Nepal and is the citizen of another country.

Other terms with vaguely the same meaning are '''Overseas Nepali''', '''Nepali origin''' and '''Expatriate Nepali'''. In common usage, this often includes Nepali-born individuals (and also people of other nations with Nepalese ancestry) who have taken the citizenship of other countries. The majority of Non Resident Nepalese reside in India.

The [[Non Resident Nepali Association]] was established by the conference held by 11–14 October 2003 in Kathmandu, Nepal. The seventh NRNA global conference was held in 14–17 October 2017 in Kathmandu.

The mother tongue languages of Non Resident Nepalese are [[Nepali language|Nepali]], [[Newar language|Newari]] or Nepal bhasa, [[Kirat language|Kirat]] and [[Limbu language|Limbuwan]] bhasa, [[Tamuwan language|Tamuwan]] (Gurung) and [[Magar language|Magar]] bhasa, [[Maithili language|Maithili]] and [[Tharu language|Tharu]] bhasa, Sudurpaschimeli Khas bhasa.
A foreign Citizen of Nepalese Origin may choose to speak in another language other than Nepalese.

'''Palestinian Nicaraguans''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: palestino-nicaragüense) ({{lang-ar|فلسطينيو نيكاراغوا}}) are [[Nicaragua]]ns of [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] ancestry who were born in or have immigrated to Nicaragua. They are part of the ethnic [[Arab diaspora]].

==History==
At different points during the 1890s to the 1940s Nicaragua, and many other [[Latin America]]n countries, established laws or issued ordinances that restricted the entry of [[Arabs]], forbade the stay of Arabs already present in the country and curtailed the expansion of their [[commerce|commercial]] activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Christina | last=Civantos | coauthors= | title=Between Argentines and Arabs: Argentine orientalism, Arab immigrants, and the writing of identity | date=2005 | publisher=SUNY Press | url = | work = | pages =224 | isbn = 0-7914-6601-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the exact number of Palestinians is not available, Guzmán writes ''"it is possible that from the end of the nineteenth century until 1917, when the [[Ottoman Empire]] entered its final decline, during [[World War I]], 40 Palestinian families arrived in Nicaragua"''.&lt;ref name=Guzman&gt;{{cite book | first=Roberto | last=Marín Guzmán | coauthors= | title=A Century of Palestinian Immigration Into Central America: A Study of Their Economic and Cultural Contributions | date=2000 | publisher=Editorial Universidad de C.R. | url = | work = | pages =49–59 | language = |isbn = 9977-67-587-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2000 it was estimated that there were 500 families of Palestine Arabs and Palestinian descendants in Nicaragua. The Palestinians that arrived in Nicaragua were mostly Christians and a small number of Muslims, the majority of which came from rural villages near [[Ramallah]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Beit Jala]] and [[Bethlehem]].

==Culture and lifestyle==
[[File:Palestinian March in Nicaragua.jpg|thumb|right|Palestinians celebrating the 10th anniversary of the Nicaraguan revolution in Managua waving Palestine and [[Sandinista]] flags.]]

When the Palestinians arrived in Nicaragua, many came from [[rural area]]s and had experience with [[agricultural]] work which most continued doing, however, not many were able to buy land. The few Palestinians that managed to buy land for agriculture managed to do so mainly in the Sabana Grande area of the department of [[Nueva Segovia (department)|Nueva Segovia]] in northern Nicaragua. Despite the few people who managed to buy land many Palestinians immersed themselves in [[commerce]]. They received great [[profit (economics)|profit]]s after founding [[Retailing|stores]] in cities such as [[Managua]], [[Granada, Nicaragua|Granada]] and [[Masaya]], where the majority of which decided to settle.&lt;ref name=Guzman/&gt; The stores founded by Palestinian immigrants varied from clothing to food stores, some of the more successful stores they founded were ''Tienda París Loundres'', ''Almacén Dajer'', ''La Media Luna'' among others.

The Palestinians in Nicaragua tried to attract non-Palestinian Arabs by founding the Club Árabe (Arab Club) in 1958, and although they managed to get [[Demographics of Syria|Syrian]]s and [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] to join, 80% of the members were Palestinian.&lt;ref name=Guzman/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2358">{{about|the collective term for a group of castes|the ancient Indian kingdom|Panchala}}

'''Panchal''' is a collective term for a variable range of [[artisan]]al [[India]]n caste groups.

According to [[Louis Dumont]], it is derived from the word ''panch'', meaning ''five'', and refers to communities that have traditionally worked as blacksmiths, carpenters, goldsmiths, stonemasons and coalmen. These groups include the [[Lohar]]s and [[Suthar]]s  of [[South India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Kings and Untouchables: A Study of the Caste System in Western India |first=Rosa Maria |last=Perez |publisher=Orient Blackswan |year=2004 |isbn=9788180280146 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GDRWAglUumEC&amp;pg=PA80 |page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David G. Mandelbaum|David Mandelbaum]] noted that the name had been assumed by the blacksmiths, carpenters, coppersmiths, goldsmiths and stonemasons of South India as a means towards achieving social upliftment, calling themselves ''Panchala'' and claiming that they are [[Brahmin]]s who descend from [[Vishwakarma]]. They do not, however, believe that they are equal among themselves: they perceive distinctions between their various occupational groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Industrial Transition in Rural India: Artisans, Traders, and Tribals in South Gujarat |first=Hein |last=Streefkerk |publisher=Popular Prakashan |year=1985 |isbn=9780861320677 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_L3edKpCmm4C&amp;pg=PA103 |page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Krishnaji Nageshrao Chitnis]] describes the Panchala as a "composite caste" in his study of the [[Maratha]]s and prefers the occupation of brass-smiths to that of workers with coal. He notes that it is also used to describe a wider range of occupations that includes barbers, carpenters, shoemakers, weavers and washermen but excludes the smiths. Further, he notes that although the term may have its origin in the number "five", there are usages that extend to a greater number, including the [[Kumbhar]] potters and [[Kasar]] makers of glass bangles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Glimpses of Maratha Socio-economic History |first=Krishnaji Nageshrao |last=Chitnis |publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Dist |year=1994 |isbn=9788171563470 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k--C9xHsSnEC&amp;pg=PA115 |page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It gained widespread popularity among the [[Pashtun people]] in 2018 during the rise to prominence of [[Manzoor Pashteen|Manzoor Ahmad Pashteen]], the leader of the [[Pashtun Tahafuz Movement]] (Pashtun Protection Movement), who usually wears it at public rallies. It has traditionally been called a "Mazari cap" due to its origins in [[Mazar-i-Sharif]], but since 2018 is more commony referred to as a "Pashteen cap". The hat has become the most iconic symbol of the Pashtun Protection Movement and [[Pashtun nationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Alikozai|first1=Hasib Danish|title=Hats Proliferate as Symbol of Pashtun Protest Movement|url=https://www.voanews.com/a/hats-symbol-pashtun-protest-movement/4335923.html|accessdate=16 May 2018|work=[[Voice of America]]|date=6 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34932">'''Polygamy '''is the practice of taking more than one spouse. [[Polygyny]] is the specific practice of one man taking more than one wife: it is a common marriage pattern in some parts of the world. In North America polygamy has not been a culturally normative or legally recognized institution since the continent's colonization by Europeans.

Polygamy became a significant social and political issue in the United States in 1852, when [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) made it known that a form of the practice, called [[plural marriage]], was part of its doctrine. Opposition to the practice by the [[United States]] government resulted in an intense legal conflict, and culminated in LDS Church [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|president]] [[Wilford Woodruff]] announcing [[1890 Manifesto|the church's official abandonment]] of the practice on September 25, 1890.&lt;ref&gt;Woodruff's declaration was formally [[Common consent (Latter Day Saints)|accepted]] in a church general conference on October 6, 1890.&lt;/ref&gt; However, breakaway [[Mormon fundamentalism|Mormon fundamentalist]] groups living mostly in the western [[United States]], [[Canada]], and [[Mexico]] still practice plural marriage.

Some other Americans practice polygamy including  Muslims communities.

==Polygamy defined==
Polygamy is defined as the practice or condition of having more than one spouse at the same time, conventionally referring to a situation where all spouses know about each other, in contrast to [[bigamy]], where two or more spouses are usually unaware of each other.&lt;ref name="MarriageCustoms"&gt;{{cite book | author= George Monger | title= Marriage customs of the world: from henna to honeymoons | publisher = A BC-CLIO | location = Santa Barbara, Calif | year = 2004 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=o8JlWxBYs40C&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=Bigamy+vs.+Polygamy | page = 31 | isbn = 1-57607-987-2| accessdate = September 1, 2010 |quote=Bigamy has come to mean the state of being married to two partners at the same time, generally with both partners unaware of the existence of the other.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legality of polygamy in North America==
===United States===
Polygamy is the act or condition of a person marrying another person while still being lawfully married to another spouse. As this is the very definition of [[bigamy]], it is illegal in the United States. The crime is punishable by a fine, imprisonment, or both, according to the law of the individual state and the circumstances of the offense.&lt;ref&gt;[http://find.galegroup.com/gvrl/infomark.do?&amp;contentSet=EBKS&amp;type=retrieve&amp;tabID=T001&amp;prodId=GVRL&amp;docId=CX3437703411&amp;source=gale&amp;userGroupName=byu_main&amp;version=1.0 West's Encyclopedia of American Law].

Brigham Young University – Utah. 11 Dec. 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Polygamy was outlawed federally by the [[Edmunds Act]], and there are laws against the practice in all 50 states, as well as the District of Columbia, Guam,&lt;ref&gt;9 GCA §31.10&lt;/ref&gt; and Puerto Rico.&lt;ref&gt;33 L.P.R.A. § 4754&lt;/ref&gt; Because state laws exist, polygamy is not actively prosecuted at the federal level,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/polylaw.htm|title=U.S. laws and Senate hearings on polygamy}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the practice is considered "against public policy" and, accordingly, the U.S. government won't recognize bigamous marriages for immigration purposes (that is, would not allow one of the spouses to petition for immigration benefits for the other), even if they are legal in the country where bigamous marriage was celebrated.&lt;ref&gt;Matter of Mujahid, 15 I. &amp; N. Dec. 546 (BIA 1976)&lt;/ref&gt; Any immigrant who is coming to the United States to practice polygamy is inadmissible.&lt;ref&gt;8 USC §1182 (a)(10)(A)&lt;/ref&gt;

Many US courts (e.g. Turner v. S., 212 Miss. 590, 55 So.2d 228) treat bigamy as a strict liability crime: in some jurisdictions, a person can be convicted of a felony even if he reasonably believed he had only one legal spouse. For example, if a person has the mistaken belief that their previous spouse is dead or that their divorce is final, they can still be convicted of bigamy if they marry a new person.&lt;ref name=Loewy1975&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Criminal Law in a nutshell 2nd Ed | year = 1975 | page = 131 | author = Loewy, Arnold H. | publisher = West Publishing Co. | postscript = . }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
In Canada the federal [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]] applies throughout the country.  It extends the normal definition of polygamy to having any kind of conjugal union with more than one person at the same time. Also anyone who assists, celebrates, or is a part to a rite, ceremony, or contract that sanctions a polygamist relationship is guilty of polygamy. Polygamy is an offence punishable by up to five years in prison.

==History of polygamy==

Scots-Irish settlers, and some Welsh emigrants, carried long-standing multiple partner traditions to the Americas from Europe.&lt;ref name="Tracy2002"&gt;{{citation|last=Tracy|first=Kathleen|title=The Secret Story of Polygamy|year=2002|origyear=2001|place=Naperville, Illinois|publisher=[[Sourcebooks]]|isbn=1-57071-723-0|oclc=46858494}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2014}}  Utopian and communal groups established during the mid-19th century had varying marriage systems, including group marriage and polygyny.&lt;ref&gt;Loue, pp.&amp;nbsp;27–30&lt;/ref&gt; There is also some evidence in the American South for multiple marriage partners, particularly after the Civil War.&lt;ref name=Tracy2002/&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2014}}

Polygamy has also been practiced, discreetly, by some [[Muslims]] living in America.&lt;ref name=Phil&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=90886407 Philly's Black Muslims Increasingly turn to polygamy]&lt;/ref&gt; However, these polygamous marriages are not recognized by American law.

Because polygamy has been illegal throughout the United States since the mid-19th century, and in many individual states before that, sources on alternative marriage practices are limited. Consequently, it is difficult to get a clear picture of the extent of the practice in the past and at the present time.

===Early Latter Day Saint practice===
{{LDSpolygamy}}
Mormon practice of plural marriage was officially introduced by [[Joseph Smith, Jr.|Joseph Smith]], the founder of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], on July 12, 1843. As polygamy was illegal in the state of [[Illinois]],&lt;ref&gt;Greiner &amp; Sherman, Revised Laws of Illinois, 1833, pg. 198–199&lt;/ref&gt; it was practiced secretly during Smith's lifetime. During the 1839–44 [[Nauvoo, Illinois|Nauvoo]] era, several Mormon leaders (including Smith, [[Brigham Young]] and [[Heber C. Kimball]]) took plural wives, any Mormon leaders that publicly taught polygamous doctrine were disciplined. For example, Hyram Brown was [[excommunication|excommunicated]] on February 1, 1844.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centerplace.org/history/ts/v5n03.htm Times and Seasons, vol. 5, pg. 423], February 1, 1844&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1844 Smith declared, "What a thing it is for a man to be accused of committing adultery, and having seven wives, when I can only find one."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boap.org/LDS/History/History_of_the_Church/Vol_VI History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Volume VI], edited by [[B. H. Roberts]], 1902.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of Joseph Smith, the practice of polygamy continued with [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), then led by [[Brigham Young]]. In the territory that became Utah, and some surrounding areas, plural marriage was openly practiced by LDS Church adherents. In 1852, Young felt the LDS Church in Utah was secure enough to publicly announce their practice of polygamy. However opposition from the U.S. government threatened the legal standing of the LDS Church. [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|President]] [[Wilford Woodruff]] announced [[1890 Manifesto|the LDS Church's official abandonment]] of the practice on September 25, 1890. Woodruff's declaration was formally [[Common consent (Latter Day Saints)|accepted]] in an LDS Church general conference on October 6, 1890. The LDS Church's position on the practice of polygamy was reinforced by another formal statement in 1904 called the [[Second Manifesto]], which again renounced polygamy.&lt;ref&gt;Scriptures of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, for the Sunday Schools, Salt Lake City: Deseret Sunday School Union, 1968, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Second Manifesto ended the official practice of new plural marriages, existing plural marriages were not automatically dissolved. Many Mormons, including prominent LDS Church leaders, maintained existing plural marriages well into the 20th century. A small percentage of adherents rejected the change, identifying as [[Mormon fundamentalism|Mormon fundamentalists]] and leaving the mainstream LDS Church to continue practicing plural marriage.

==Latter Day Saint fundamentalism==
{{main|Mormon fundamentalism}}
{{see|Current state of polygamy in the Latter Day Saint movement|List of denominations in the Latter Day Saint movement}}
Some sects that practice or at least sanction polygamy are the [[Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints]] (FLDS), the [[Latter-day Church of Christ]] and the [[Apostolic United Brethren]]. Polygamy among these groups persists today in [[Utah]], [[Arizona]], [[Colorado]], [[Canada]], and some neighboring states, as well as up to 15,000 isolated individuals with no organized church affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;Brooke Adams, [http://www.principlevoices.org/article.php?story=20050828124239994 Fundamentalists: Most espouse polygamy as a tenet, but fewer actually practice it as their lifestyle] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022022041/http://www.principlevoices.org/article.php?story=20050828124239994 |date=2014-10-22 }}, Salt Lake Tribune, 11 August 2005, as quoted at principlevoices.org, Accessed 8 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Polygamist churches of Latter Day Saint origin are often referred to as "[[Mormon fundamentalism|Mormon fundamentalist]]"; however, the main LDS Church has rejected polygamy since the early 20th century. Mormon fundamentalists often use an ambiguous September 27, 1886 revelation to [[John Taylor (1808-1887)|John Taylor]] as the basis for continuing the practice of plural marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mormonfundamentalism.com/NEWFILES/1886RevelationNew.htm "An 1886 Revelation to John Taylor"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110921072222/http://www.mormonfundamentalism.com/NEWFILES/1886RevelationNew.htm |date=2011-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=June 2009}}

The ''[[Salt Lake Tribune]]'' estimates there may be as many as 37,000 Mormon fundamentalists, with less than half living in polygamous households.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.principlevoices.org/article.php?story=20050828124239994 "LDS splinter groups growing"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022022041/http://www.principlevoices.org/article.php?story=20050828124239994 |date=2014-10-22 }} by Brooke Adams, August 9, 2005 – SLT Article ID: 10BF07C805DE5990&lt;!-- Note: this is a [[Wikipedia:Convenience_links|convenience link, as the original article is currently only viewable by subscription to the SLT archives, but article number provided for verifiability--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Most polygamous groups are composed of about a dozen extended Mormon fundamentalist organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Dougherty | first = John | url = http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/2005-12-29/news/forbidden-fruit/ | title = Forbidden Fruit | publisher = ''[[Phoenix New Times]]'' | date = 2005-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Hollenhorst | first = John | url = http://deseretnews.com/dn/view/0,1249,635182923,00.html | title = Birth defect is plaguing children in FLDS towns | publisher = ''[[Deseret Morning News]]'' | date = 2006-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldextra.com/content/view/165069/ |title=Doctor: Birth defects increase in inbred polygamy community |publisher=''[[Provo Daily Herald|Daily Herald]]'' |date=2006-02-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603020858/http://www.heraldextra.com/content/view/165069/ |archivedate=2008-06-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last= Szep | first= Jason | url= https://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idUSN0727298120070614 | title = Polygamist community faces rare genetic disorder | publisher = Reuters | date = 2007-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LDS Church asserts it is improper to call any of these splinter polygamous groups "Mormon."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/ldsnewsroom/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=21525e876b68f010VgnVCM100000176f620aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=9ae411154963d010VgnVCM1000004e94610aRCRD "Mormon Fundamentalists"], 6 March 2006 press release by the LDS Church&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/ldsnewsroom/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=0ebf22526078f010VgnVCM100000176f620aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=9ae411154963d010VgnVCM1000004e94610aRCRD "Polygamist Sects Are Not 'Mormons,' Church Says"], 25 October 2006 press release by the LDS Church&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current polygamist groups===
Members of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS) practice polygamy in [[arranged marriages]] that often, but not always, place young girls with older men. Most FLDS members live in [[Hildale, Utah]] and [[Colorado City, Arizona]], about 350 miles southwest of Salt Lake City, with other communities in Canada, Texas and other areas of the North American west. The FLDS leader is currently [[Warren Jeffs]].&lt;ref&gt;The Associated Press. "National Briefs." Telegraph – Herald [Dubuque, Iowa] 21 Nov. 2007, C3. ProQuest Newsstand. [[ProQuest]]. Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah. 11 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, about 40,000 people living in Utah were part of a polygamist family, or about 1.4 percent of the population.&lt;ref name=NYT-23Aug1998&gt;James Brooke. "Utah Struggles With a Revival of Polygamy. " New York Times [New York, N.Y.] 23 August 1998, Late Edition (East Coast): 12. ProQuest Newsstand. ProQuest. Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah. 11 Dec. 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Polygamists have been difficult to prosecute because many only seek [[marriage licenses]] for their first marriage, while the other marriages are secretly conducted in private ceremonies. Thereafter, secondary wives attempt to be seen in public as single women with children.&lt;ref name=NYT-23Aug1998/&gt;

===Multiple divorce and marriage for polygamy===
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2013}}
Some polygamous families use a system of multiple divorce and legal marriage as a [[loophole]] in order to avoid committing a criminal act. In such cases the husband marries the first wife, she takes his last name, he divorces her and then marries the next wife, who takes his name. This is repeated until he has married and divorced all his wives, except possibly the last one. This way the wives feel justified in calling themselves Mrs [husband's last name] and, while legally they are divorced from the husband, they still act as if married to him and expect those around them to acknowledge and respect this.

Since only one wife is officially married to the husband at any one time, no law is being broken and so this type of polygamous family unit can be overt about their relationship. The conviction of [[Thomas Arthur Green]] in 2001 may have made the legal status of such relationships more precarious in Utah, although Green's bigamy convictions were made possible only by his own public statements.

===Polygamy today===

Mormon fundamentalist sects tend to aggregate in individual communities of their own specific sect and basis for polygamy. These small groups range from a few hundred up to 10,000, and are located across Western North America,&lt;ref name=Primer2011 /&gt; including:

==Recent polygamy cases==
The practice of informal polygamy among fundamentalist groups presents interesting legal issues. It has been considered difficult to prosecute polygamists for [[bigamy]], in large part because they are rarely formally married under state laws. Without evidence that suspected offenders have multiple formal or [[common-law marriage]]s, these groups are merely subject to the laws against [[adultery]] or unlawful [[cohabitation]] — laws which are not commonly enforced because they also criminalize other behavior that is otherwise socially sanctioned. However, some "Fundamentalist" polygamists marry women prior to the [[age of consent]], or commit fraud to obtain [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] and other public assistance.

In 1953, the state of [[Short Creek raid|Arizona investigated and raided]] a group of 385 people in the polygamist-practicing colony of Hildale and Colorado City, straddling the Utah-Arizona border. All the men were arrested and the children were placed with foster families. A judge eventually ruled this action illegal, and everyone returned to the community, which now contains about 10,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Riccardi. "The Nation; Jeffs may be put away for life, but polygamy's at large in Utah :[HOME EDITION]. " Los Angeles Times  [Los Angeles, Calif.] 27  September 2007, A.13. Los Angeles Times. ProQuest.  Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah.  11 Dec. 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, in the state of [[Utah]] in the [[United States]], Juab County Attorney [[David O. Leavitt]] successfully prosecuted [[Thomas Arthur Green|Thomas Green]], who was convicted of [[Child support in the United States|criminal non-support]] and four counts of bigamy for having five serially monogamous marriages, while living with previous legally divorced wives. His cohabitation was considered evidence of a common-law marriage to the wives he had divorced while still living with them. That premise was subsequently affirmed by the Utah Supreme Court in State v. Green, as applicable only in the ''State of Utah. Green'' was also convicted of [[child rape]] and criminal non-support.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utcourts.gov/opinions/supopin/greeni090304.htm State v. Green]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, starting on April 4, Texas State officials took 436 women and children into temporary legal custody after Rozita Swinton, a 33-year-old woman living in Colorado Springs, Colorado, called both Texas Social Services and a local shelter claiming to be a 16-year-old girl. She made a series of phone calls to authorities in late March, claiming she had been beaten and forced to become a "spiritual" wife to an adult man.  Acting on her calls, authorities raided the ranch in Eldorado, about 40 miles south of San Angelo. The [[YFZ Ranch]] is owned by the [[Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]] (FLDS), a Mormon offshoot that practices polygamy. Two men were arrested for obstructing the raid but were later released.

== Canada ==

In Canada, polygamy is a criminal offence under section 293 of the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]], which provides for a penalty of up to five years imprisonment,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution-url= http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-46/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-46.html#sec293 |contribution= Section 293 |title= [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]], [[Revised Statutes of Canada|RSC]] 1985, c C-46 |series= [[Law of Canada|Statutes and Regulations of Canada (Federal)]] |publisher= [[Canadian Legal Information Institute]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; but prosecutions are rare.

=== Alberta ===
A 2005 report by the Alberta Civil Liberties Research Centre recommended that Canada decriminalize polygamy, stating: "Criminalization is not the most effective way of dealing with gender inequality in polygamous and plural union relationships. Furthermore, it may violate the constitutional rights of the parties involved."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swc-cfc.gc.ca/pubs/pubspr/0662420683/200511_0662420683-3_8_e.html#2 Polygamy in Canada: Legal and Social Implications for Women and Children – A Collection of Policy Research Reports]''.  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080331153208/http://www.swc-cfc.gc.ca/pubs/pubspr/0662420683/200511_0662420683-3_8_e.html#2 |date=March 31, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the Attorney General of [[British Columbia]] expressed concerns over whether this prohibition is constitutional, and an independent prosecutor in British Columbia recommended that Canadian courts be asked to rule on the constitutionality of laws against polygamy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSN3127523520070801 |publisher= Reuters |title= Canada urged to review legality of polygamy ban |first= Allan |last= Dowd |date= August 1, 2007 |accessdate= 2011-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Supreme Court of British Columbia]] upheld Canada's anti-polygamy section 293 of the Criminal Code and other ancillary legislation in a 2011 [[reference question|reference case]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Canada's polygamy laws upheld by B.C.

'''Prince Agha Abdul Karim Khan Ahmedzai''' was the younger brother of Khan of [[Kalat (princely state)|Kalat]], [[Mir Ahmedyar Khan]], the last ruler of [[Baluchistan (Chief Commissioners Province)|Balochistan]]. After the [[United Kingdom|British]] left Balochistan on 13 August 1947. It's alleged that the Khan was forced to join [[Pakistan]]. 

On the night of May 16, 1948 Prince Abdul Karim Khan, in defiance of his brother, decided to lead a [[separatism|separatist]] movement against the Pakistan government, so as to preserve his life of privilege as the Khan's governor in Makran.

The Prince invited the leading members of [[Baloch nationalist]] political parties—the [[Kalat State National Party]], the [[Baloch League]], and the [[Baloch National Workers Party]] — to join him in the struggle for the creation of an independent "[[Greater Balochistan]]". Apart from his political motives, the Prince was a member of the royal family and the former governor of the Makran province; he was upset by Pakistan's recognition of [[Sardar Bay Khan Gichki]] as Makran's ruler.

==Origins and allies of the movement==
Prince Karim decided to migrate to [[Afghanistan]] in order to get help and to organise his movement. He wrote to the Khan on June 28, 1948 explaining the causes of his migration.

Some of the prominent political leaders who joined him were [[Mohammed Hussein Anka]] (the secretary of the Baloch League and the editor of [[Weekly Bolan Mastung]]), [[Malik Saeed Dehwar]] (the secretary of the Kalat State National Party), [[Qadir Bakhsh Nizamami]] (a member of the Baloch League), [[Maulwi Mohd Afzal]] (a member of [[Jamiat-Ulm-e-Balochistan]]), and prominent members of the Sind-Balochistan branch of the Communist Party.

== Plan of action ==
The [[Baloch Mujahedeen]] (Baloch Holy Warriors), as they called themselves, entered Afghanistan and encamped at ''Sarlath'' in the province of [[Kandahar]]. During their stay, the Baloch freedom fighters adopted the following measures to achieve their goal:

*Sending messages to the Baloch chiefs of Eastern and [[Western Balochistan]], asking them to join in the armed struggle;

Messages were sent to [[Mir Ghulam Faruq]] of the [[Rudini]] tribe, [[Sardar Mehrab Khan]], [[Sardar Mir Jumma]] and [[Mir Wazir Khan Sanjrani]] of Chagai, and several other chiefs. The propaganda campaign was to be carried out on two fronts:

(A) The national cultural front

(B) The religious front

== Armed struggle ==

The Prince issued an appeal to individuals to help with the recruitment. A person recruiting 100 men was offered the rank of major, and a person recruiting 50 men was entitled to the rank of captain. The [[Baloch liberation army]] had a secret agency called Jannisar (devotee), whose duty was to provide information, destroy the communication system, and watch the activities of traitors. There was also a secret unit called Janbaz (darer), whose job was to kill all traitors. The Janbaz were subordinate to the Jannisar. The headquarters of the agency was known as Bab-i-Aali (secret war office) and was headed by Prince Karim. The total strength of the Jannisar was recorded as 30; nothing is known about the strength of the Janbaz.

== Soviets and Afghans ==
The Prince did not start a war because of Afghanistan's refusal and the [[Soviet Union]]'s unwillingness to offer assistance. During his stay in Sarlath, Prince Karim appointed [[Malik Saeed]] and [[Qadir Bakhsh Nizamani]] as his emissaries to contact the Afghan government and approach other embassies in order to get moral and material support. According to Nizamani, the Afghan authorities refused to provide any sort of help and told them either to remain in [[Kandahar]] as political refugees or to return to Balochistan. The Afghan authorities also refused to permit the rebel group to operate on Afghan soil. Nizamani informed the [[Iran]]ian Embassy of the Baloch demands as well. Iranian diplomats showed their concern but did not offer any assistance, though they were willing to provide asylum to the rebel group in Iran. The last hope of the Prince's representative was the Soviet Embassy. The Soviet diplomats listened to Nizamami carefully. Though they did not give any assurances, they did promise to inform [[Moscow]].

In the 19th century, Afghan rulers like [[Shuja Shah]] and [[Abdur Rahman Khan]] wanted to occupy Balochistan. In 1947, the Afghan government demanded the creation of [[Pashtunistan]], a region stretching from [[Chitral]] and [[Gilgit]] to the [[Baloch coast]] in the [[Arabian Sea]]. The Afghan government called Balochistan "South Pashtunistan" in statements and publications. The Afghan expansionist policy reflected the economic considerations of a landlocked state. At the same time, it was impossible for the Afghan government to neglect its own national interests and to support the movement of an independent [[Greater Balochistan]], which claimed the Baloch region in Afghanistan.

[[Joseph Stalin]] did not pursue [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s policy in the East. Moreover, the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] government was unwilling to annoy the Afghans or the British, both of whom opposed the creation of an independent Balochistan.

== Delegitimisation==
Meanwhile, a ''Farman Royal Order'' issued by the Khan on May 24, 1948 stated that the Prince and his party were to be regarded as a rebel group; no connection of any sort with the Prince and his party should be maintained, nor should they be given rations; further, if any member of the rebel group committed an offence, he would be punished. The Government of Pakistan moved the army to the military posts of [[West Punjab|Punjab]], [[Chaman Chashme]], and [[Rastri]] near the Afghan border, attempting to control the rebels' rations which were being sent by pro-separatist elements, and to control their activities or stop any attempt at invasion. The Pakistani authorities confirmed two clashes between the army and the rebels.

To avoid popular unrest in Balochistan, the Khan sent his maternal uncles [[Hajji Ibrahim Khan]] and [[Hajji Taj Mohammed]] from [[Sarlath]] to bring Prince Karim back to [[Kalat (Pakistan)|Kalat]]. Khan made his return conditional.

The Prince and the separatist movement failed to achieve internal and external support. Moreover, the Baloch nationalists were divided into two groups. Anqa and [[Malik]] Saeed favoured armed struggle in the form of guerilla war, while [[Mir Ghous Bux Bizenjo]] and other prominent leaders wished to resolve all issues by negotiation.

== Return and capture==
The Prince was forced to return to the Khanate and negotiate for his demands peacefully. On July 8, 1948, when the news of the Prince's arrival reached Kalat, the Prime Minister and a Kalat State Force went to meet the Prince at [[Earboi]] to deliver the Khan's message.

With Afghan aid, Abdul Karim entered Balochistan and organised a rebellion against Pakistan in the [[Jhalawan]] area. He received assistance from [[Mir Gohar Khan Zehri]], an influential tribal leader of the [[Zarkzai]] clan. [[Major General Akbar Khan]], who was in charge of the Pakistani army's Seventh Regiment, was ordered to attack the insurgents and force them to surrender. Prince Karim and his 142 followers were arrested and imprisoned in the [[Machh]] and [[Quetta]] jails.

A detailed and interesting statement comes from [[General Akbar Khan]], in his article published in the daily Dawn, dated August 14, 1960, under the title "Early reminiscences of a soldier." In this article, General Akbar confirms that there was a plan to invade the Khanate and describes the clash between the Pakistani army and the separatist force headed by Prince Karim. Akbar claims that [[Jinnah]] had issued instructions that this news should not be published in the Pakistani press.Jinnah was dead by then.

== Trial and sentencing ==
After the arrest of the Prince and his party, the Attorney Governor General gave an order for an inquiry, to be conducted by [[Khan Sahib Abdullah Khan]], the Additional District Magistrate of Quetta. He submitted his report on September 12, 1948. His report was based on the Prince's activities and upon the letters and documents published by the separatist force. After the inquiry, [[R. K. Saker]], the District Magistrate of Quetta, appointed a special [[Jirga]] (official council of elders) consisting of the following persons:

1. [[Khan Bahador Malik Sahibzada]], [[M.Ayub Khan Isakhel]], [[Pashtoon]] from [[Pishin, Pakistan|Pishin]];
2. [[K.B. Baz Mohd Khan]]. [[Jogezai]], Pashtoon from [[Loralai]];
3. [[Abdul Ghaffar Khan Achakzai]], Pashtoon from [[Pishin, Pakistan|Pishin]];
4. [[S.B. Wadera Noor Muhammad Khan]], a [[Baloch people|Baloch]] Chief from [[Kalat (princely state)|Kalat]];
5. [[Syed Aurang Shah]] from [[Kalat (princely state)|Kalat]];
6. [[Sheikh Baz Gul Khan Mandokhail]]. Pashtoon from [[Zhob]];
7. [[Wahab Khan Panezai]], Pashtoon from [[Sibi]];
8. [[Sardar Doda Khan Marri]], [[Baloch people|Baloch]] from [[Sibi]].

This Jirga was instructed to study the circumstances and events which led to the revolt and was asked to give its recommendations to the District Magistrate. On November 10, 1948, the Jirga heard the testimony of the accused and gave its recommendations to the D.M. on November 17, 1948, suggesting the delivery of the Prince to [[Loralai]] at the pleasure of the Government of Pakistan and various other penalties. The D.M., in his order dated November 27, 1948, differed with the opinion of the Jirga and sentenced the Prince to ten years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of 5000 rupees. Other members of his party were given various sentences and fines.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6408">'''Poosapati / Pusapati''' was the ruling clan of the [[Kalinga (historical kingdom)|Kalinga]] [[Vizianagaram]] (founded in late 16th century AD). They were [[Raju|Kshatriya]]s of the [[Pericchedi]] ruling clan of Andhra.

==History==
[[File:West Entrance of the Vizianagaram fort in Andhra Pradesh.jpg|thumb|West Entrance of the Vizianagaram fort in [[Andhra Pradesh]]]]
[[File:Viznm kota.jpg|thumb|Main Entrance of Vizianagaram Fort]]
The Pericchedi kings were ancestors of the Pusapati royal family who built Bezawada (Modern [[Vijayawada]]) off the river Krishna by 626&amp;nbsp;AD and another capital in Kollipaka establishing themselves for nine centuries there.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4ZUOAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=&amp;pgis=1 ''A History of Telugu Literature''] p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;  They were staunch patrons of Hindu Dharma in contrast to the [[Chalukyas]], who initially were patrons of [[Jainism]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=D71KAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=paricchedi&amp;dq=paricchedi&amp;lr=&amp;pgis=1 ''Mediaeval Jainism: With Special Reference to the Vijayanagara Empire''] by Bhasker Anand Saletore&lt;/ref&gt;
The family name was changed to Pusapati after moving to the coastal region. They founded the city of Vizianagaram, and named it after Pusapati  Vijay Rama Raju, spelled with a Z to differentiate it from the Vijayanagar Dynasty in Hampi. They obtained the title of Gajapathi in the 16th century, after vanquishing the [[Gajapatis]] (of Orissa) in the battle of Nandapur (modern [[Jeypore]]), in the Northern Circars, and have used since then. In 1484 Pusapati Rachi Raju wrote Vasistha Gotra Kshatriya Sisa Malika.

The Rajas allied themselves with the Gajapathi Emperor of Orissa against the Vijayanagar Empire initially but after being conquered by [[Krishnadevaraya]] they became their feudal allies. They, along with the other allies of Vijayanagar were conquered by Sultan Quli, the founder of the Qutub Shahi dynasty of Golkonda but by 1652 the 5th king of the subsequent Pusapati line was made Subahdar of the [[Northern Circars]] and they re-established themselves in the Vizagapatnam country. Emperor Aurangzeb has given them a two-edged sword 'pattaa kaththi' ([[Telugu language|Telugu]]:పట్టాకత్తి) (Zulfiqar), which is still used in the coat-of-arms of the family. By 1713 they erected the fort at Vizianagaram where they have since resided. In 1827 Maharajah Vijay Rama Gajapati Raju III. had several honors conferred on him by the British Government. Lord Northbrook obtained for him the title of His Highness, and had his name enrolled among those of chiefs entitled to return visits from the Viceroy with a 13 gun salute.

[[Egypt]], which does not border [[Syria]], became a major destination '''for Syrian refugees''' since 2012 following the election of Egyptian President [[Mohamed Morsi]], who is a critic of [[Bashar al-Assad]] in the [[Syrian Civil War]]. As of 2016, there are 114,911 registered Syrian refugees living in Egypt.&lt;ref name="UNHCR"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://data.unhcr.org/syrianrefugees/country.php?id=8|title=UNHCR Syria Regional Refugee Response|last=(UNHCR)|first=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|newspaper=UNHCR Syria Regional Refugee Response|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The country is also under the Regional Refugee and Resilience Plan (3RP), a coordination effort between countries neighboring Syria ([[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]], [[Turkey]], [[Iraq]]), [[Egypt]], and [[United Nations|UN]] agencies with [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] including [[UNHCR]] and 240 partners.&lt;ref name="3RPKey"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.3rpsyriacrisis.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/3RP-Interagency-Key-Messages.pdf |title=3RP Key Messages| date=March 2017| accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Refugee Conditions in Egypt ==

=== Employment ===
Egypt has a large black market and most Syrian work in it. There are cafés on this black market where a majority of unregistered Syrians work. The majority of Syrian registered with [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UNHCR]] have a higher chance of receiving a job because they are in Egypt legally.&lt;ref name="thenation.com"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/why-syrian-refugees-risk-journey-death-europe/|title=Why Syrian Refugees Risk the ‘Journey of Death’ to Europe|newspaper=The Nation|issn=0027-8378|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not a simple task to gain employment because of Egypt's reservation on refugee access to the labor market in the [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees|1951 refugee convention]].&lt;ref name="thenation.com"/&gt;

=== Housing ===
In Egypt, refugees are allowed to live in the cities unlike some of their neighboring countries. The majority of Syrians that registered with UNHCR have housing in Egypt because of their resettlement program.&lt;ref name="dailynewsegypt.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2015/04/07/employment-detention-and-registration-on-syrian-refugees-in-egypt/|title=Employment, detention, and registration: On Syrian refugees in Egypt|date=2015-04-07|website=Daily News Egypt|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are more barriers to entry in Egypt. There has been more detention as a means of housing and a holding ground before deportation.&lt;ref name="dailynewsegypt.com"/&gt;

== Education ==

=== Public Schools ===
In 2012, the president of Egypt granted Syrians access to the public school system and aid in registration. Education is free to Syrian Refugees but it does exclude post-graduate education.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Citation|title=Refugee-run schools in Egypt helping Syrian children get an education|date=2016-04-07|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-35947086|language=en-GB|accessdate=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students are required to have their passports and a copy of their transcript from Syria. If a student does not have their transcript they can take a placement exam to determine their level of education. Upon application for school Syrian students receive a document that gives them access to a one-year residency permit.

=== Refugee Schools ===
There are Syrian learning centers in Egypt that differ from the public school system because they are accredited.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These educational institutions are a source of jobs or Syrian teachers because they are not allowed to legally teach in the Egyptian public school system. These schools offer assistance with the Egyptian curriculum.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Healthcare ==
Egypt with the help UNHCR and other NGOs mainstreamed healthcare for Syrian refugees and made their healthcare free. Mainstreaming effect refugees in urban areas like [[Cairo]]. There was standardization of the healthcare system and more transparency of the costs.&lt;ref name="UNHCR"/&gt;

=== Services Provided ===
* Birth Registration and certificate issuing
* Issuing of health cards
* Premarital care
* Antenatal care
* routine immunization
* Early detection of thyroxine hormone deficiency
* Infant feeding counseling and growth monitoring
* Management of childhood illness
* Adolescent care
* Medical Examinations
* Medicine Provisions
* Chronic illness treatment
* Dental Services

== Egypt's Legal Reaction to Syrian Immigration ==
In order to gain refugee status in Egypt it must be proved that the applicant has a well founded fear of persecution. After gaining refugee status you are given a UNHCR yellow card which gives you three year [[temporary residency]] permit.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/help/refugee-law/egypt.php|title=Refugee Law and Policy: Egypt|date=2016-11-28|website=www.loc.gov|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Egypt is having refugees renew their permits every six months.

=== Restrictions ===
In July 2013, the Egyptian government required Syrian refugees to have entry visas, residency documents, and work permit before they could enter the country.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Since the implementation of this law, 3,058 refugees have been detained for attempting to depart illegally by sea. 75 female refugees from multiple countries, including Syria, are being detained in prison for allegedly having fake passports, being undocumented, and attempting to depart. There is a high unemployment rate among refugees, due to the 1982 Article 11 of the Ministry of Labor's Ministerial Resolution that required employers to prove that no Egyptian national was available for a job before a work permit was issued to a refugee.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Savoyard''' is a [[dialect]] of the [[Franco-Provençal language]]. It is spoken in some territories of the historical [[Duchy of Savoy]], nowadays a geographic area spanning [[Savoie]] and [[Haute-Savoie]], [[France]] and the [[Canton of Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]. The varieties are commonly known as ''patois''. It has around 35,000 speakers today.

==Some words ==
Several subdialects of Savoyard exist that exhibit unique features in terms of phonetics and vocabulary. This includes many words that have to do with the weather: ''bacan'' (French: ''temps mauvais''); ''coussie'' (French: ''tempête''); ''royé'' (French: ''averse''); ''ni[v]ole'' (French: ''nuage''); ...and, the environment: ''clapia, perrier'' (French: ''éboulis''); ''égra'' (French: ''sorte d'escalier de pierre''); ''balme'' (French: ''grotte''); ''tova'' (French: ''tourbière''); and ''lanche'' (French: ''champ en pente'').

==Linguistic studies==
Savoyard has been the subject of detailed study at the ''Centre de dialectologie'' of the [[Stendhal University]], [[Grenoble]], currently under the direction of Michel Contini.

'''Small Castes''' are not [[Caste]]s, they are [[Profession]]s. After the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], the British occupied the whole [[Indian subcontinent]]. They introduced a new policy of [[divide and rule]] to sustain their occupation in this region{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}. According to this policy, society was divided into two parts, i.e. agricultural and non-agricultural castes. The skilled and educated persons of the community were designated as small castes, or non-agricultural castes. Their real castes were removed from the records and the profession was avowed as their caste.

==Feudal system==
This was a [[feudal system]] made to keep the youth of society away from learning such skills. According to this system the skilled persons became slaves to the feudal landlords and the agricultural castes, who were rewarded with lands and territories as they were loyal to Britain rather than their own people.  The assets of these skilled persons were seized or awarded to feudal Chiefs and their relatives. The people belonging to these castes were deprived of some rights like government jobs, sale and purchase of property (exceeding a particular limit), education, etc. Due to this act the respectable became the most reviled in the society. Their profession became their caste for more than two centuries. So the title of small caste was given by the British to the skilled persons of the society belonging to the major castes of the society.

==After independence==
Although the British left after 1947, this plant is rooted so deep that it has had bitter effects till now. It is supposed to be the major cause of division in Pakistani society. But after Independence from the British and [[Dogra]] Rules the [[Azad Kashmir|AJK]] Government has changed this policy by announcing [[equality before the law|equal rights]]. Members of these Castes were also allowed to enlist with their real caste.

==List of small castes==
The following Castes were included in Small Castes:
*Tarhan: [[Carpenter]]s
*Qamyar: [[Pottery|Potters]]
*Lowar: Will forge
*Kassaï: Butchers
*Mirassi: Travelling musicians, [[troubadours]]
*Mautchi: [[Shoemaker]]s
**Tobi: [[Laundry|Launderers]]
*Darzi: [[Dressmaker]]s
*Jalaye: Tisserands
*Lahari: [[Dyeing|Dyers]]
*Mashqi: Water carriers
*Teli: Oil Tycoons
*Balwalai: [[Courier|Messengers]]
*Naï: Hairdressers; they are also able to make small operations, they circumscise the newborn ones and are cooks during the festivals and the marriages

'''Social Security Organization''' ('''SSO''') is a [[social insurance|social insurer organization]] in [[Iran]] which provides coverage of wage-earners and salaried workers as well as voluntary coverage of self-employed persons. In 1975, the [https://web.archive.org/web/20110903224522/http://www2.tamin.org.ir/web/sso-en/laws Social Security Law] was approved and the SSO was established.&lt;ref name="www2.tamin.org.ir"&gt;http://www2.tamin.org.ir/web/sso-en/gi/history&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Iran]] did not legislate in favor of a universal social protection, but in 1996, the [http://amar.sci.org.ir/index_e.aspx Center of the Statistics of Iran] estimated that more than 73% of the Iranian population was covered by [[social security]].&lt;ref name='Irandev'&gt;{{Cite journal| first= | last=| coauthors=| contribution=Iran: Country Brief| title=Development Progress| editor-first=| editor-last=| publisher=[[World Bank]]| place=| pages=| date=June 2009| year=| id= | contribution-url=http://go.worldbank.org/KQD2RP3RX0| format=| accessdate=2009-07-12|

The '''Swiss''' ({{lang-de|die Schweizer}}, {{lang-fr|les Suisses}}, {{lang-it|gli Svizzeri}}, {{lang-rm|ils Svizzers}}) are the citizens of [[Switzerland]],{{efn|The term is sometimes extended to include the descendants of Swiss emigrant, see e.g. {{cite encyclopedia |year= |title =Swiss |encyclopedia=[[New Oxford American Dictionary]] |publisher= |location= |id= }} Conversely, being born in Switzerland does not give an individual Swiss citizenship automatically (there are three levels of ''alien citizens'' status in Switzerland), so that there are numerous second generation legal aliens who are technically "natives of Switzerland" without being considered Swiss.}} or people of [[Swiss diaspora|Swiss ancestry]].

The number of [[Swiss nationality law|Swiss nationals]] has grown from 1.7 million in 1815 to 7 million in 2016. More than 1.5 million Swiss citizens hold [[multiple citizenship]].&lt;ref&gt;
916k out of 5,293k of permanent residents of Switzerland aged 15 and over ({{cite web|title=Ständige Wohnbevölkerung ab 15 Jahren nach doppelter Staatszugehörigkeit (2016)|language=German|url=https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/de/home/statistiken/bevoelkerung/migration-integration/erwerb-schweizer-buergerrecht-doppelbuerger.assetdetail.4242679.html|accessdate=20 April 2018}}) plus 570k out of 775k [[Swiss abroad]] ({{cite web|title=Auslandschweizerstatistik 2016|language=German|url=https://www.eda.admin.ch/dam/eda/de/documents/publications/AuslandschweizerinnenundAuslandschweizer/Auslandschweizerstatistik/2016-Auslandschweizerstatistik_de.pdf|format=pdf|accessdate=20 April 2018}}).&lt;/ref&gt; 
About 11% of citizens [[Swiss abroad|live abroad]] (0.8 million, of whom 0.6 million hold multiple citizenship).
About 60% of those living abroad reside in the [[European Union]] (0.46 million). 
The largest groups of Swiss descendants and nationals outside Europe are found in the [[Swiss Americans|United States]] and [[Swiss Canadian|Canada]].

Although the  [[Switzerland as a federal state|modern state of Switzerland]]  originated in 1848, the period of [[romantic nationalism]], it is not a [[nation-state]], and the Swiss are not usually considered to form a single [[ethnic group]], but a [[Confederation|confederacy]] (''{{lang|de|[[Eidgenossenschaft]]}}'') or ''{{lang|de|[[:de:Willensnation|Willensnation]]}}'' ("nation of will", "nation by choice", that is, a [[consociational state]]), a term coined in conscious contrast to "[[nation]]" in the conventionally linguistic or ethnic sense of the term.

The demonym ''Swiss'' (formerly in English also ''Switzer'') and the [[name of Switzerland]], ultimately derive from the toponym ''[[Schwyz]]'', have been in widespread use to refer to the [[Old Swiss Confederacy]] since the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year= |title=Schwyz |encyclopedia=[[New Oxford American Dictionary]] |publisher= |location= |id= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethno-linguistic composition==
{{Main|Linguistic geography of Switzerland}}

[[File:Bundesrat der Schweiz 2008 Teil 1.JPG|thumb|Official photo of the [[Swiss Federal Council|Federal Council]] (2008),  idealized depiction of multi-ethnic Swiss society.]]
The ethno-linguistic composition of the territories of modern Switzerland includes the following components:
*The '''German-speaking Swiss''' (''Deutschschweizer''), i.e. [[Alemannic German]], historically amalgamated from the [[Gallo-Roman]] population and the [[Alemanni]]. Closely related German-speaking peoples are the [[Alsace|Alsatians]], the [[Swabians]] and the [[Vorarlberg]]ians. German speakers (including [[Germans in Switzerland|German immigrants]]) accounted for 63% of population as of 2015.
**Speakers of [[High Alemannic German|High Alemannic]], roughly [[Brünig-Napf-Reuss line|divided]] into an Eastern ([[Zürich German|Zürich]], [[Lake Lucerne]], [[Eastern Switzerland]]) and a Western ([[Bernese German|Bernese]], [[Solothurn]], Western Aargau, [[Basel-Land]] and [[Fricktal]]) subgroup, with most dialects of [[Aargau]] and [[canton of Lucerne|Lucerne]] transitional between the groups. 
**Speakers of [[Low Alemannic]] in [[Basel]] and the [[Lake Constance]] area
**Speakers of [[Highest Alemannic]] in the [[Bernese Oberland]], [[Upper Valais]] and the [[Walser]] settlements in [[Central Switzerland]], [[Grisons]] and [[Ticino]]
*The '''French-speaking Swiss''' (''Romands''), traditionally speaking [[Franco-Provençal language|Franco-Provençal]] dialects, today largely assimilated to the standard [[French language]] ([[Swiss French]]), amalgamated from the Gallo-Roman population and [[Burgundians]] (the historical [[Upper Burgundy]]). Romands are considered a distinct [[Italic peoples|Romance people]].&lt;ref name="Minahan"&gt;{{cite book |last=Minahan |first=James |author-link= |title=One Europe, Many Nations: A Historical Dictionary of European National Groups |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NwvoM-ZFoAgC |date=2000 |publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]] |location= |page=545 |isbn=0313309841 |quote=The Romands are a distinct Romance people}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are closely related to the [[French people|French]] (especially those of [[Franche-Comté]]). They are referred to as ''[[Walha|Welsche]]'' (singlar ''Welscher'') in Swiss German. French speakers (including [[French diaspora|French immigrants]]) accounted for 23% of population as of 2015.
*The '''Italian-speaking Swiss''' (''Svizzeri italiani''), traditionally speakers of [[Lombard language]] ([[Ticinese dialect|Ticinese]] variety) today partly assimilated to the standard [[Italian language]], amalgamated from Raetians and [[Lombardy|Lombards]]. They are closely related to the [[Italians]] (especially [[Lombardy|Lombards]] and [[Piedmont]]ese). Italian-speakers (including [[Italians in Switzerland|Italian immigrants]]) accounted for 8.4% of population as of 2015.
*The '''[[Romansh people|Romansh]]''', speakers of the [[Romansh language]], settling in parts of the [[Grisons]], historically of [[Raetia|Raetic]] stock. Romansh speakers accounted for 0.6% of population as of 2015.

The core [[Eight Cantons]] of the Swiss Confederacy were entirely Alemannic-speaking, and German speakers remain the majority. However, from as early as the 15th century, parts of French-speaking [[Vaud]] and Italian-speaking [[Ticino]] were acquired as subject territories by Berne and Uri, respectively. The Swiss ''[[Romandie]]'' was formed by the accession of French-speaking [[canton of Geneva|Geneva]] and [[canton of Neuchatel|Neuchâtel]] and the partly francophone [[Valais]] and [[Bernese Jura]] (formerly part of the [[Prince-Bishopric of Basel]]) to the [[Restored Swiss Confederacy]] in 1815.
Romansh was [[Questione Ladina|formerly considered]] a group of [[Regional Italian|Italian dialects]], but Switzerland declared Romansh a national language in 1938 in reaction to the [[Kingdom of Italy under Fascism (1922–1943)|fascist Italian]]  [[Italian irredentism|irredentism]] at the time. 

As elsewhere in Western Europe,  [[immigration to Switzerland]] has increased dramatically since the 1960s, 
so that a large proportion of the resident population of Switzerland are now not descended or only partially descended from the core ethno-linguistic groups listed above. 
As of 2011, 37% of total resident population of Switzerland had immigrant background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Population résidante permanente de 15 ans et plus, ventilée selon le statut migratoire et le canton|url=http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/fr/index/news/04/01.Document.169377.xls|publisher=Office fédéral de la statistique|accessdate=14 August 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131116104721/http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/fr/index/news/04/01.Document.169377.xls|archivedate=16 November 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As of 2016, the most widely used foreign languages were English, [[Portuguese in Switzerland|Portuguese]], [[Albanians in Switzerland|Albanian]], [[Immigration from the former Yugoslavia to Switzerland|Serbo-Croat]] and Spanish, all named as a "main language" by more than 2% of total population (respondents could name more than one "main language").&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/de/home/statistiken/bevoelkerung/sprachen-religionen/sprachen.assetdetail.4542467.html 	Ständige Wohnbevölkerung nach Hauptsprachen 2016], BFS, 28 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural history and national identity==
{{Main|Swiss culture|Swiss folklore|History of the Alps|Historiography of Switzerland}}
The Swiss populace historically derives from an amalgamation of [[Gauls|Gallic]] or [[Gallo-Roman]], [[Alamanni]]c and [[Rhaetian people|Rhaetic]] stock. Their cultural history is dominated by the [[Alps]], and the alpine environment is often cited as an important factor in the formation of the Swiss national character.&lt;ref&gt;"Some landscapes were highlighted because they were considered essential in the building of the nation and the shaping of its culture. This was most obvious in Switzerland where the Swiss character was forged by the daily confrontation with the difficult mountainous environment of the Alps. Lunn (1963) suggests that the wonderful scenery gave those who inhabited it an opportunity to develop a sense of dignity and grandeur." Niamh Moore, Yvonne Whelan, ''Heritage, memory and the politics of identity: new perspectives on the cultural landscape'', Ashgate Publishing, 2007,  {{ISBN|978-0-7546-4008-0}}[javascript:]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the "Swiss illness", the condition of [[Swiss mercenaries]] pining for their mountainous native home, became prototypical of the medical condition of ''[[nostalgia]]'' ("homesickness") described in the 17th century.

In [[early modern Switzerland]], the [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Swiss Confederacy]] was a pact between independent states within the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The populations of the states of [[Central Switzerland]] considered themselves ethnically or even racially separate: [[Martin Zeiller]] in ''[[Topographia Germaniae]]'' (1642) reports a racial division even within the canton of [[Unterwalden]], the population of [[Obwalden]] being identified as "[[Gallo-Roman culture|Romans]]", and that of [[Nidwalden]] as "[[Cimbri]]" (viz. [[Germanic people|Germanic]]), while the people of [[canton of Schwyz|Schwyz]] were identified as of [[Swiss Swedish origin legend|Swedish ancestry]], and the people of [[canton of Uri|Uri]] were identified as "[[Huns]] or [[Goths]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ferdinand Vetter]], ''[https://archive.org/details/ueberdiesagevond00vett Ueber die Sage von der Herkunft der Schwyzer und Oberhasler aus Schweden und Friesland]'', Bern 1877, 10f.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern Switzerland is atypical in its successful political integration of a multiethnic and multilingual populace, and is often cited as a model for new efforts at creating unification, as in the European Union's frequent invocation of the Swiss Confederate model.&lt;ref&gt;Hartley-Moore (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;
Because the various populations of Switzerland share language, ethnicity, and religion not with each other but with the major European powers between whom Switzerland during the modern [[history of Europe]] found itself  positioned, a policy of domestic plurality in conjunction with international neutrality became a matter of self-preservation.&lt;ref&gt;Kohn 1956:15–20&lt;/ref&gt;
Consequently, the Swiss elites during the period of the formation of [[nation state]]s throughout Europe did not attempt to impose a national language or a nationalism based on ethnicity, instead  pushing for the creation of a civic nation grounded in democratic ideology, common political institutions, and shared political ritual. Political allegiance and patriotism was directed towards the [[cantons of Switzerland|cantons]], not the federal level, where a spirit of rivalry and competition rather than unity prevailed. [[C. G. Jung]] advanced the view that this system of social order was one of a "chronic state of mitigated civil war" which put Switzerland ahead of the world in a civilizatory process of "introverting" warlike aggression.&lt;ref&gt;
Frank McLynn, ''Carl Gustav Jung'' (1997), {{ISBN|978-0-312-15491-2}}[javascript:]&lt;/ref&gt;
A similar view is attributed to [[Gottfried Keller]], who is cited to the effect that the Swiss Confederacy could not exist without the endemic rivalry between cantons.&lt;ref&gt;Hartley-Moore (2007:213f.): "Localized equivalents of nationalist symbols were also essential to the creation of Swiss civil society. Rather than allowing a centralized federal government to force assimilation to a national ideal, Swiss policy nourished  individual characteristics of different regional and language groups" throughout the country. In the Swiss model, pride in local identity is to some degree synonymous with loyalty to the larger state; national identity is nurtured through local 'patriotism.' As Gottfried Keller argued in the nineteenth century, 'Without cantons and without their differences and competition, no Swiss federation could exist'."&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 19th century there were conscious attempts to foster a federal "Pan-Swiss" [[national identity]] that would replace or alleviate the cantonal patriotisms. Among the traditions enlisted to this end were federal [[Schützenfest|sharpshooting competitions]] or ''tirs'',  because they were one of the few recognized symbols of pan-Swiss identity prior to the creation of the [[Restauration (Switzerland)|1815 Confederation]] and because they traditionally involved men from all levels of society, including the peasants, who in [[Romantic nationalism]] had become ideologically synonymous with liberty and nationhood.&lt;ref&gt;Hartley-Moore (2007), citing Kohn 1956:78.&lt;/ref&gt; An additional symbol of federal national identity at the federal level was introduced with the [[Swiss national holiday]] in 1889.   The bonfires associated with the national holiday have become so customary since then that they have displaced the ''[[Funken]]'' traditions of greater antiquity. 

Identification with the national symbolism relating to the Old Swiss Confederacy was especially difficult for the cantons which had been joined to the [[Helvetic Republic]] in 1798 without any prior membership in the Swiss Confederacy, and which were given the status of Swiss cantons only after the end of the Napoleonic era. 
These specifically include [[Grisons]], [[Valais]], [[Ticino]], [[Vaud]] and [[canton of Geneva|Geneva]]. 
[[Canton of St. Gallen|St. Gallen]] is a special case in a different sense, being a conglomerate of various historical regions created in 1803; in this case, patriotism may attach itself even to sub-cantonal entities, such as the [[Toggenburg]]. Similarly, due to the historical imperialism of the [[canton of Berne]], there is considerable irredentism within the Bernese lands, most visibly [[Jurassic separatism|in the Bernese Jura]] but to a lesser extent also in parts of the [[Bernese Oberland]] such as [[Haslital|Hasli]].

==Citizenship and naturalization==
{{see|Swiss nationality law|Swiss passport|Swiss Federal Constitution}}
Swiss citizenship is still primarily citizenship in one of the [[Swiss cantons]], and the naturalization of foreign citizens is the privilege of the cantons.
No [[Swiss passport]]s were issued prior to 1915, more than 60 years after the establishment of the modern Swiss Confederation. Prior to 1915, citizens held passports issued by their cantons,  the Confederation being considered as a federation of the cantons, not a state composed of [[natural person]]s as its citizens.

The [[Swiss Constitution]] of 1848 regulated certain rights that the cantons were required to grant to citizens of other cantons, such as the right of residence (in the case of naturalized citizens after a period of five years).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.verfassungen.de/ch/verf48-i.htm Constitution of 1848] Art. 43. The requirement of adherence to a  [[Christianity in Switzerland|Christian confession]] in the 1848 version was dropped in 1866.&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Swiss Constitution]] of 1874, which remained in force (with revisions) until 1999, 
defined Swiss citizenship as inherited from cantonal citizenship: '' Jeder Kantonsbürger ist Schweizer Bürger'' ("every citizen of a canton is a Swiss citizen").&lt;ref&gt;[www.verfassungen.de/ch/verf74-i.htm Constitution of 1874], Art. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the preamble to the current [[Swiss Constitution]] of 1999, a "Swiss People" (''Schweizervolk'') is invoked alongsides "the Cantons" as sovereign entity, and article 1 reads "The People and the Cantons [...] form the Swiss Confederation."
Article 37 still defines Swiss citizenship as inherited from communal and cantonal citizenship: "Any person who is a citizen of a commune and of the Canton to which that commune belongs is a Swiss citizen."&lt;ref&gt; Authoritative [http://www.admin.ch/ch/d/sr/c101.html German], [http://www.admin.ch/ch/f/rs/c101.html French] and [http://www.admin.ch/ch/i/rs/c101.html Italian] as well as non-authoritative [https://www.admin.ch/opc/rm/classified-compilation/19995395/index.html Romansh] and [https://www.admin.ch/opc/en/classified-compilation/19995395/index.html English] texts of Federal Constitution of the Swiss Confederation of 18 April 1999 (SR 101)
&lt;/ref&gt;

As Swiss citizenship is entirely based on ''[[jus sanguinis]]'', the [[place of origin]] rather than the [[place of birth]] is  recorded in identity documents. As Swiss citizenship is tied to the cantonal citizenship associated with the "place of origin" (''Heimatort'' or ''Bürgerort'' "home commune, commune of citizenship"),  a citizen's place of origin is inherited from his or her father (from the mother if born out of wedlock or if the father holds no citizenship). 
The significance of the place of origin outside of the naturalization procedure has been gradually abolished in the early 21st century. Since 2012, the municipality or canton of a citizen's place of origin is no longer responsible for providing [[social welfare]] to that citizen.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Friedli, [https://www.nzz.ch/der_heimatort_wird_irrelevant-1.14190191 Der Heimatort wird irrelevant], [[NZZ]] 8 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2013, a woman no longer acquires the place of origin of her husband upon marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Swiss nationality law, Art. 161 ZGB.&lt;/ref&gt; 

While the cantons are responsible for naturalization, federal [[Swiss nationality law]] regulates minimal requirements necessary for naturalization. 
These requirements were significantly reduced in a 2018 revision of the law,  allowing naturalization after a minimal period of residence of ten years, and in certain cases as little as five years (naturalization of spouses and children of Swiss citizens; years of residence at ages 8 to 18 count double).
A further requirement is that the applicant be "well integrated" and "familiar with life in Switzerland", and must have

The federal law just specifies minimal requirements for naturalization, and cantons are free to introduce more stringent requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archives.24heures.ch/vaud-regions/actu/naturalisation-ne-devient-suisse-facon-2011-03-22 |title=Naturalisation: on ne devient pas Suisse partout de la même façon &amp;#124; 24 heures |publisher=Archives.24heures.ch |date=2011-03-22 |accessdate=2013-09-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130628063825/http://archives.24heures.ch/vaud-regions/actu/naturalisation-ne-devient-suisse-facon-2011-03-22 |archivedate=2013-06-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, the cantons delegate the actual procedure of naturalization to the [[Municipalities of Switzerland|communes]].

With 25% of the population resident aliens, Switzerland has one of the highest ratios of non-naturalized inhabitants in Europe (comparable to [[Demographics of the Netherlands|the Netherlands]]; roughly twice the ratio of [[Demographics of Germany|Germany]]). In 2003, 35,424 residents were naturalized, a number exceeding net population growth. Over the 25-year period of  1983 to 2007, 479,264 resident foreigners were naturalized, yearly numbers rising gradually from below 10,000 (0.1%) in the 1980s to above 40,000 (0.6%) in the 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bfm.admin.ch/etc/medialib/data/migration/statistik/auslaenderstatistik/einbuergerungen.Par.0001.File.tmp/ts24_dez07_d.pdf Bundesamt für Migration]&lt;/ref&gt; Compare the figure of 0.2% (140,795) in the United Kingdom (2004).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs05/hosb0805.pdf Persons Granted British Citizenship, 2004 (pdf)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326135650/http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs05/hosb0805.pdf |date=2009-03-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetics==
{{Further|Genetic history of Europe|Y-DNA haplogroups in populations of Europe}}
The genetic composition of the Swiss population is similar to that of [[Central Europe]] in general. Switzerland is on one hand at the crossroads of several prehistoric migrations, while on the other hand the [[Alps]] acted as a refuge in some cases. Genetic studies found the following [[haplogroup]]s to be prevalent:

The '''Tar Sands Healing Walk''' began in 2010. It was founded by Jesse Cardinal, in collaboration with the indigenous women of Keepers of the Athabasca.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.healingwalk.org/blog|title = Tar Sands Healing walk|date = November 2014|accessdate = November 2014|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Eriel Tchekwie Deranger, a Dene women, is the main organizer. One of Eriel’s co-organizers for the Healing Walk is Melina Laboucan-Massimo, a Lubicon Cree environmental activist.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://thefeministwire.com/2013/06/indigenous-feminisms-walia/|title = Feminist Wire|date = 2013|accessdate = December 2014|website = Indigenous Women: Never Idle|publisher = Feminist Wire|last = Walia|first = Harsha}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over four consecutive years the Tar Sands Healing Walk brings together hundreds of people to walk in a spiritual gathering to protect culture, environment and climate from the expansion of the tar sands. This women's initiative aims to unite the peoples of the Athabasca River and Lake Watershed to secure and protect water and watershed lands for ecological, social, cultural and community health and well being.

== Background ==
The walk is a demonstration to bring awareness to the impact of the tar sands development.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; "Protests, rallies, marches are all good and necessary, but we felt like people needed something more spiritual, something to strengthen a connection to the land", said organizer Jesse Cardinal (Keepers of the Athabasca). It is called the healing walk to pray for the land and the people that have been exploited by [[tar sands]]' development.  It is a reaction to the alleged legislative abuses of [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] treaty rights.

{{quotation|Tar Sands Healing Walk: Just start where you are, start today, small steps, let’s move forward to Pray for this land that is our home — Jesse Cardinal }}

Over 500 people travelled from all over North America to participate in this healing ceremony. The walk takes place on the territories of the Cree, Dene and Métis peoples of northern Alberta, where the impacts of the tar sands on the land and its inhabitants is devastating.
[[File:Athabasca Oil Sands map.png|thumb|Athabasca Oil Sands|150px|right]]

Many people gather and camp at the Indian Beach Campsite in Anzac, just outside [[Fort McMurray]] near the [[Athabasca Oil Sands]], to participate in the walk. Native elders from all over North America lead people past lakes of tailings wastewater and infrastructure of the tar sands industry along the Athabasca River covering a walking route ranging from 14 to 16 kilometers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.idlenomore.ca/_bill_mckibben_and_naomi_klein_to_join_canada_s_tar_sands_healing_walk|title = Idle No More|date = July 2013|accessdate = December 2014|website = Idel No more|publisher = |last = Leahy|first = Stephan}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2014 walk was the last official walk. "This is the last healing walk in the Athabasca region because it's time to shed light on other communities impacted by tar sands," said Jesse Cardinal, coordinator of Keepers of the Athabasca. "In order to stop the destruction, the healing has to start everywhere."

== Main issues ==
The walk brings awareness to Canadian human rights violations and the devastating impacts of the Athabasca Oil Sands on  First Nations people. The right to clean air and clean water were outlined in [[Treaty 6]] protected by the Canadian Constitution. Under [[Treaty 6]], the Beaver Lake Cree are guaranteed the right to hunt, trap and fish on their traditional lands in perpetuity. The oil sands developments threaten the indigenous peoples' traditional way of life by destroying the very habitat upon which the animals and fish depend.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite book|title = The No-Nonsense Guide to Indigenous Peoples|last = Hughes|first = Lotte|publisher = New Internationalist Publications|year = 2012|isbn = |location = Ontario|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadian oil sands, also known as the tar sands, is the largest industrial project on earth, yet few Canadians are aware of the rapid pace of growth and its impacts on the environment, economy, and society. Alberta tar sands produced approximately 1.9 million barrels of oil per day in 2012. If industry and government’s expansion plans are approved this number could reach 5 million barrels per day by the end of 2030. In 2013, First Nations people witnessed the oil spill in Cold Lake, which still continues to pose problems for people in the area.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Eight experts in environmental science, policy and risk from [[Simon Fraser University]] called for a moratorium on all new tar sands development until there is a comprehensive policy-making process for more sustainable energy development for North America.

== Health of indigenous people ==

Since 2007 higher than normal incidences of rare and deadly cancers and brain tumours have been documented by the Alberta Health Department in First Nations communities that live downstream of the oil sands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Cancer Incidence in Fort Chipewyan, Alberta 1995-2006.|last = Chen|first = Y.|publisher = Alberta Cancer Board, Division of Population Health and Information Surveillance, Alberta Health Services|year = 2009|isbn = |location = Edmonton, AB, Canada|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arsenic]], cancer causing carcinogens, are created by bitumen production. Arsenic deposits are detected in water, soil, and even in the remnants of fallen snow that have been tested in the area.

Toxins are inescapable and cancer rates are skyrocketing, especially among women and children, due to the industrial chemical exposure in the water and the air.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.vancouverobserver.com/environment/healing-walk-brings-focus-albertas-oil-development-costs-photos|title = Vancouver Observer|date = July 2013|accessdate = November 22, 2014|website = Highlighting human and environmental cost of Canada's energy policy with Healing Walk through oil sands|publisher = |last = Uechi|first = Jenni}}&lt;/ref&gt; These chemicals are now inextricable from the landscape. This health issue for indigenous people is considered a form of industrial genocide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXQTyHkJkW4|title = In Solidarity with the Healing Walk: Women's voices on the oilsands, pipelines, and climate change|date = 2013|accessdate = 2014|website = you tube|publisher = Nobel Women's Initiative|last = Walia|first = Harsha}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cancers and asthma rates for people of Northern Alberta are higher than most places in Canada and higher than non-indigenous people.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXQTyHkJkW4|title = Solidarity with the Healing walk|date = 2014|accessdate = November 2014|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Life expectancy for indigenous people is on average five years less than non-indigenous people.

Under the current oil sands development, woodland caribou populations are expected to disappear. This poses a problem for the hunting traditions of Canada's indigenous peoples. This threatens their food security and adds to overall health issues for the people and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The No-Nonsense Guide to Indigenous Peoples.|last = Hughes|first = Lotte|publisher = New Internationalist Publications|year = 2012|isbn = |location = Ontario|pages = }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Women ===
''In Solidarity with the Healing Walk: Women's voices on the oil sands, pipelines, and climate change'', discusses issues on climate change and health for indigenous women and children. Very few sources discuss these issues from the perspective of women. Women's voices are silenced in politics especially in indigenous politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Politics of Race In Canada: Readings in Historical Perspectives Contemporary Realities, and Future Possibilities.|last = Wallis &amp; Fleras|first = M. &amp; A.|publisher = Oxford Press.|year = 2009|isbn = |location = Ontario|pages = Conceptualizing the Politics of Race: Taking Race Seriously.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their families are more impacted by rare cancers and their children are suffering higher rates of asthma than non-indigenous children who live outside the path of environmental impact.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Organizer Eriel Tchekwie Deranger is explicit that what is happening in her community is industrial genocide, and that her community and its traditional way of life are dying along with her people. indigenous women are very impacted, not just by tar sands, but through this representation of continued [[colonization]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Human rights ==
In a human rights report on Canada, [[Amnesty International]] suggested that the government should have respect for indigenous rights when issuing licences for mining, logging, petroleum and other resource extraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://tarsandssolutions.org|title = Tar Sands Solutions|date = 2014|accessdate = November 2014|website = Tar Sand Solution|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tar sands boom is an attack on First Nations rights, by displacing indigenous populations and dismantling crucial environmental protections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.idlenomore.ca/_bill_mckibben_and_naomi_klein_to_join_canada_s_tar_sands_healing_walk|title = Idle No More|date = July 2013|accessdate = December 2014|website = Idle No More|publisher = |last = Leahy|first = Stephan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Beaver Lake Cree nation has documented 20,000 treaty rights violations linked to tar sands expansion. 80% of the traditional territories of the Athabasca Chipewyan, First Nation and the Cree First Nation are rendered inaccessible for periods of the year due to oil sands development. The land that is accessible is devastated by development.

== Health of the environment ==

Climate activist [[Bill McKibben]] notes that if development in Canada's oil sands continue, it will cause irreversible damage to the planet. Despite the economic advantages that developing oil could have on Canada, McKibben suggested that it's time to develop green energy jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.vancouverobserver.com/environment/healing-walk-brings-focus-albertas-oil-development-costs-photos|title = Vancouver Observer|date = 2013|accessdate = November 2014|website = Vancouver Observer|publisher = |last = Ueichi|first = Jesse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oil sands underlie approximately 140,000 square kilometers of Alberta&amp;nbsp;– an area about the size of Florida.&lt;ref name="TSS"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://tarsandssolutions.org/tar-sands/human-right|title = TSS Tar Sands Solutions|date = 2014|accessdate = November 2014|website = TSS Tar Sands Solutions|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Oil sands leases cover about 20% of the province’s land area. In 46 years of development, only 0.15% of the environment disturbed is certified as "reclaimed." There is no way to return the [[boreal forest]] to its natural state. Over 30 million birds will be lost over the next 20 years due to tar sands development.

=== Climate ===

Dangerous [[greenhouse gas]] emissions are produced by Canada's [[Tar sands|tar sand]] that impact the Global climate.&lt;ref name="TSS" /&gt; The exploitation of the oil sands is the primary reason Canada will fail to meet its own greenhouse gas reduction targets. Canada’s climate performance is the worst in the entire Western world. More than 600 million cubic feet of natural gas are used every day to extract oil from the tar sands. That amount of gas is enough to heat more than 3 million Canadian homes every day.  The International Energy Agency reports that increasing oil production from 1.9 million barrels to 5 million a day will lead to a catastrophic increase in the global temperature. [[Carbon emissions]] from the production and processing of the oil sands have more than doubled in the last decade and are on track to double again. The Canadian government has mounted an intensive lobbying campaign to weaken clean fuel standards that the [[European Commission]] has proposed to achieve its climate change targets.

=== Air and water ===

In northern Alberta, local Aboriginal communities are forced to endure highly degraded air and water quality. Oil sands industry used approximately 170 million cubic metres of water in 2011 to extract bitumen.&lt;ref name="TSS"/&gt;  That is the equivalent to the residential water use of 1.7 million Canadians. 95% of the water used in tar sands surface mining is so polluted it has to be stored in toxic sludge pits. That is 206,000 litres of toxic waste discharged every day.

{{quotation| "The river used to be blue. Now it’s brown. Nobody can fish or drink from it. The air is bad. This has all happened so fast," says Elsie Fabian, 63, an elder in a Native Indian community along the Athabasca River.}}

Canada is home to two of the three largest dams in the world. They are used to hold back toxic sludge from the oil sands.&lt;ref name="TSS"/&gt; 11 million litres of toxic wastewater seep out of the tailing pits into the boreal forest and Athabasca river every day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.cbc.ca/player/Shows/Shows/The+Nature+of+Things/ID/2341297455/|title = Tipping Point: The Age of The Oil Sands|date = March 2013|accessdate = November 2014|website = CBC: The Nature of Things|publisher = CBC|last = Suzuki|first = David}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is 4 billion litres a year. Air pollutant guidelines in Alberta are less stringent than international standards. Despite that, air quality objectives were exceeded 1,556 times in 2009, up from 47 times in 2004.

[[David Schindler]], environmental scientist, conducted research to assess the way water pollution was investigated in the oil sands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.cbc.ca/player/Shows/Shows/The+Nature+of+Things/ID/2341297455/|title = Tipping Point: The Age Of The Oil Sands|date = March 2013|accessdate = November 2013|website = CBC The Nature Of Things|publisher = CBC|last = Suzuki|first = David}}&lt;/ref&gt; His research indicated that water monitoring was only regulated by the industry, not outside environmental consultants. This led to inaccurate levels of carcinogens reported over time. Chief Allan Adams of the Athabasca area is consulting with Schindler to provide evidence of water pollution linked to the seepage from the tailings ponds.

Eighty per cent of the traditional territory of the Mikisew Cree and Athabasca Chipewyan First Nations has been rendered inaccessible for most of the year by tar sands development, which is a direct treaty rights violations. This directly impacts fishing and hunting access.

{{quotation| If we don’t have land and we don’t have anywhere to carry out our traditional lifestyles, we lose who we are as a people. So, if there’s no land, then it’s equivalent in our estimation to [[genocide]] of a people," says George Poitras of the Mikisew Cree First Nation.}}

Hunting is a traditional way of life for Canada's indigenous people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://tarsandssolutions.org/tar-sands/human-rights|title = TSS Tar Sands Solutions|date = 2014|accessdate = November 2014|website = TSS Tar Sands Solutions|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of habitat has prevented hunting on their own land. The pollutants from the production of the oil sands iskilling animals and fish that First Nations communities relied on at one time for food. In 2007, it was suggested that wildlife has been negatively affected by the oil sands; for instance, moose were found in a 2006 study to have as high as 453 times the acceptable levels of [[arsenic]] in their systems, though later studies lowered this to 17 to 33 times the acceptable level (although below international thresholds for consumption).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/story/2007/04/03/game-alberta.html?ref=rss | work=CBC News | title=Mixed reports on safety of eating northern Alberta game | date=3 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* May 2013. ''[[Vancouver Observer]]'' prints academics' letter to Joe Oliver warns against promoting oil sands development.
* July, 2013. ''Vancouver Observer'' reports that the walk highlights human and environmental cost of Canada's energy policy with Healing Walk through oil sands. The topic was trending nationally on Twitter and was covered by the U.K.-based ''Guardian'' as well as Al-Jazeera and ''The Wall Street Journal''.
* ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' -  Any new pipeline would facilitate tar sands expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://canadians.org/content/tar-sands-stopping-destruction-and-starting-healing|title = Tar Sands Stop destruction and start healing|date = 2014|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This means more cancer causing toxins in the Athabasca River watershed and more carbon emissions coming from the Boreal Forest (which would naturally produce carbon pollution). This is the reason for fights against pipeline proposals such as the [[Keystone Pipeline|Keystone XL]] pipeline, Enbridge’s Line 9, TransCanada’s Energy East, and the B.C. pipelines — Kinder Morgan’s Trans Mountain pipeline and the Enbridge Northern Gateway — even exist is because government and industry want to expand the tar sands. They want to profit off of this dirty oil, and they don’t want anyone to get in their way.

"It was unlike anything Lori Nicotine had ever seen. On the Poundmaker First Nation, words like mining, tailings and steam-assisted gravity drilling are non-existent. But on Saturday, Nicotine left the North Battleford reserve for the fifth and final Healing Walk, a 16-kilometre spiritual walk around a former tailings pond. Aboriginal chiefs and elders lead [sic] the procession, stopping intermittently to pray for the land's healing with song and tobacco offerings. As a crowd of 700 walked up Highway 63 and approached Syncrude's main plant, Nicotine looked out towards the upgraders and work trucks, and wept."

This '''timeline of the American Old West''' is a chronology ordered list of events significant to the development of the [[American frontier|American West]] as a region of the [[United States]] prior to 1912. The term "American Old West" refers to a vast geographical area and lengthy time period of imprecise boundaries, and historians' definitions vary. The events in this timeline occurred primarily in the portion of the modern United States west of the [[Mississippi River]], and mostly in the period between the [[Louisiana Purchase]] in 1803 and the admission of the last states into the Union in 1912. A small section summarizing early exploration and settlement prior to 1803 is included to provide a foundation for later developments. Rarely, events significant to the history of the West but which occurred within the modern boundaries of Canada and Mexico are included as well.

Western North America was inhabited for millennia by various groups of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], and later served as a [[frontier]] to European powers, beginning with [[Spain|Spanish]] colonization in the 16th century. [[United Kingdom|British]], [[France|French]], and [[Russia]]n claims followed in the 18th and 19th centuries. After the [[American Revolution]], the newly independent United States began securing its own frontier from the [[Appalachian Mountains]] westward for settlement and economic investment by American citizens. The long [[territorial evolution of the United States|history of American expansion]] into these lands has played a central role in shaping American culture, iconography, and the modern national identity, and remains a popular topic for study by scholars and historians.

Events listed below are notable developments for the region as a whole, not just for a particular state or smaller subdivision of the region; as historians Hine and Faragher put it, they "tell the story of the creation and defense of communities, the use of the lands, the development of markets, and the formation of states.... It is a tale of conquest, but also one of survival, persistence, and the merging of peoples and cultures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hine|first1=Robert V.|last2=Faragher|first2=John Mack|title=The American West : a new interpretive history|date=2000|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, Conn.|isbn=0300078358|page=10.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For almost three centuries after Columbus' voyages to the New World, much of western North America remained unsettled by European colonists, despite various territorial claims made by imperialist nations. Europeans interest in the vast territory was motivated by the search for precious metals, especially gold, and the fur trade, with miners, trappers, and hunters among the first people of European descent to permanently settle in the West.&lt;ref name=RMUtley/&gt;{{rp|150}} The early years were also a period of scientific exploration and survey, such that by 1830 the rough outline of the western half of the continent had been mapped to the [[Pacific Ocean]].&lt;ref name=RMUtley&gt;Robert M.

'''Venda''' or '''Tshivenda''', also known as ''Tshivenḓa'' or ''Luvenḓa'', is a [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] language and an official language of [[South Africa]]. It is mainly spoken by the [[Venda people]] in the northern part of South Africa's [[Limpopo Province]], as well as by some [[Lemba people]] in [[Zimbabwe]]. The Venda language is related to [[Kalanga language|Kalanga]] (Western Shona, different from [[Shona language|Shona]], official language of Zimbabwe) which is spoken in Botswana and Zimbabwe. During the [[Apartheid]] era of South Africa, the [[bantustan]] of [[Venda]] was set up to cover the Venda speakers of South Africa.

According to the 2011 census, Venda speakers are concentrated in the following areas: [[Makhado Local Municipality]], with 350,000 people; [[Thulamela Local Municipality]], with 370,000 people; [[Musina Local Municipality]], with 35,000 people; and [[Mutale Local Municipality]], with 89,000 people. The total number of speakers in Vhembe district currently stands at 844,000. In Gauteng province, there are 275,000 Venda speakers. Fewer or less than 10,000 people are spread across South Africa and that makes total number of Venda speakers in South Africa at 1.2&amp;nbsp;million people or just 2.2% of South Africa's population, making Venda speakers the second smallest minority language in South Africa, after the [[Southern Ndebele language|Ndebele language]], which number 1.1&amp;nbsp;million speakers.

==Writing system==
The Venda language uses the [[Latin alphabet]] with five additional accented letters. There are four dental consonants with a [[circumflex accent]] below the letter (''ḓ, ḽ, ṋ, ṱ'') and an [[overdot]] for velar ''ṅ''. Five vowel letters are used to write seven vowels. The letters C, J and Q are used only for foreign words and names.

The ''sintu'' writing system ''Isibheqe Sohlamvu/[[Ditema tsa Dinoko]]'', known technically in Venda as ''Luṱhofunḓeraru lwa Mibvumo'', is also used for the Venda language.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

==Phonology==
Venda distinguishes [[dental consonant|dental]] ''ṱ, ṱh, ḓ, ṋ, ḽ'' from [[alveolar consonant|alveolar]] ''t, th, d, n, l'' as well as (like in [[Ewe language|Ewe]]) [[labiodental]] ''f, v'' from [[bilabial]] ''fh, vh'' (the last two are slightly [[labialization|rounded]]). There are five vowel sounds: {{IPA|/i ɛ a ɔ u/}}. There are no clicks; ''x'' has the sound of ''ch'' in ''loch'' or ''Bach''. As in other South African languages like the [[Zulu language|Zulu]], ''ph, ṱh, th, kh'' are aspirated and [[ejective]]: ''p, ṱ, t, k''.

===Tones===
Venda has a specified tone, {{sc|high}}, with unmarked syllables having a low tone. Phonetic falling tone occurs only in sequences of more than one vowel or on the penultimate syllable if the vowel is long. Tone patterns exist independently of the consonants and vowels of a word and so they are [[word tone]]s. Venda tone also follows [[Meeussen's rule]]: when a word beginning with a high tone is preceded by that high tone, the initial high tone is lost. (That is, there cannot be two adjacent marked high tones in a word, but high tone spreads allophonically to a following non-tonic ("low"-tone) syllable.) There are only a few tone patterns in Venda words (no tone, a single high tone on some syllable, two non-adjacent high tones), which behave as follows:

{|class=wikitable

|-
!thamana

|thàmà:nà||thámâ:nà
|Unmarked (low) tone is raised after a high tone. That is, the preceding tone spreads.
|-

'''Vicente Carrillo Fuentes''' (born October 16, 1962), commonly referred to by his alias '''El Viceroy''', is a [[Mexican people|Mexican]] suspected [[drug lord]] and former leader of the [[Juárez Cartel]], a drug trafficking organization. The cartel is based in Chihuahua, one of the primary transportation routes for billions of dollars' worth of illegal drug shipments entering the [[United States]] from Mexico annually. He was one of Mexico's [[List of Mexico's 37 most-wanted drug lords|most-wanted drug lords]].&lt;ref name=wanted&gt;{{cite web|title=DEA FUGITIVE: CARRILLO-FUENTES, Vicente|url=http://www.justice.gov/dea/fugitives/internl/carrillo.htm|publisher=[[Drug Enforcement Administration]]|accessdate=4 October 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429095902/http://www.justice.gov/dea/fugitives/internl/carrillo.htm|archivedate=29 April 2011|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Vicente Carrillo Fuentes was born in Guamuchilito, Navolato, Sinaloa, Mexico on 16 October 1962 to Vicente Carrillo and Aurora Fuentes. He had seven siblings: Angélica, [[Amado Carrillo Fuentes|Amado]], Cipriano, Guadalupe, Alberto, Rodolfo and José Cruz Carrillo Fuentes (Vicente being the fourth one).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=¿Quién es Vicente Carrillo Fuentes? |url= http://www.milenio.com/policia/Vicente_Carrillo_Fuente-cartel_de_Juarez-capturan_a_El_Viceroy-Senor_de_los_Cielos_0_387561535.html |accessdate=10 October 2014|publisher=[[Milenio]]|date=9 October 2014|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; All are nephews of [[Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo]], a former drug lord.

== Family relations and alliances ==
The [[Juárez Cartel]] was founded by his brother [[Amado Carrillo Fuentes]] following the death of [[Pablo Acosta Villarreal]].

Cipriano Carrillo Fuentes died in the mid-1980s by gunshot under mysterious circumstances. Amado began in the drug business under the tutelage of his uncle and eventually formed the Juárez Cartel by 1993. Amado brought in his brothers and eventually his son [[Vicente Carrillo Leyva]], who was arrested on April 1, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Castillo|first=Eduardo E.|title=Vicente Carrillo Leyva, Wanted Mexican Drug Suspect, Detained|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/04/02/vicente-carrillo-leyva-wa_n_182367.html|accessdate=4 October 2012|newspaper=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=2 April 2009|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BAZZhGhP?url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/04/02/vicente-carrillo-leyva-wa_n_182367.html|archivedate=4 October 2012|deadurl=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ellingwood|first=Ken|title=Mexico arrests suspected No. 2 in Juarez drug cartel|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/latinamerica/la-fg-mexico-capture3-2009apr03,0,7149086.story|accessdate=4 October 2012|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=3 April 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110304072003/http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/latinamerica/la-fg-mexico-capture3-2009apr03,0,7149086.story |archivedate=4 March 2011|deadurl=no|location=[[Mexico City]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Amado died on July 3, 1997 following complications from plastic surgery, a brief turf war began in Juarez over the leadership of the cartel. Vicente would emerge as the victor after defeating the Muňoz Talavera brothers for control of the cartel. Vicente formed a partnership with [[Juan José Esparragoza Moreno]], his brother Rodolfo Carrillo Fuentes, his nephew Vicente Carrillo Leyva, Ricardo Garcia Urquiza and the [[Beltrán-Leyva Cartel|Beltrán Leyva brothers]]. He kept in service several lieutenants formally under his brother, such as "El Chacky" Hernandez.

The organization was in flux by the time Vicente took control of the cartel and the death of Amado created a large power vacuum in the Mexican underworld. The [[Arellano Félix]] brothers became the most powerful organization during the 1990s while Vicente was able to avoid direct conflict and increase the strength of the Juárez Cartel. The relationship between the Carrillo Fuentes clan and the other members of the organization grew unstable towards the end of the 1990s and into the 2000s. In 2001 after the escape from prison by [[Joaquín Guzmán Loera]], many of the Juárez Cartel members defected to Guzmán's [[Sinaloa cartel]].

In 2004 Rodolfo Carrillo was killed outside of a movie theatre allegedly at the behest of Guzmán Loera. Vicente Carrillo responded by having Guzmán Loera's brother "El Pollo" assassinated in prison. This sparked off a turf war; however, it seemed that the war between the two was on hold during 2005 and 2006 because the [[Sinaloa Cartel]] was engaged in a vicious war with their rival, the [[Gulf Cartel]]. During this time, the leadership of the cartel was between Vicente Carrillo and Ricardo García Urquiza, who was arrested in November 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Marshall|first=Claire|title=Mexico arrests drug cartel head|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4458426.stm|accessdate=4 October 2012|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|date=22 November 2005|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BAZs9tTt?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4458426.stm|archivedate=4 October 2012|deadurl=no|location=[[Mexico City]]|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cartel had become factionalized between the groups loyal to the Carrillo family and the groups loyal to Juan José Esparragoza Moreno and Guzmán Loera's [[Sinaloa Cartel]].

The Juárez Cartel, under the control of Vicente Carrillo Fuentes and his nephew Vicente Carrillo Leyva, was placed under a large degree of pressure following the "[[House of Death]]" case, in which the organization was penetrated by law enforcement, but was corrupted by the fact that the informant participated in murders. In 2008, 200 murders occurred in the first three months and it appeared that the war between the Sinaloa Federation and the remnants of the Juárez Cartel was back on. President [[Felipe Calderón|Calderón]] sent thousands of troops to [[Ciudad Juárez]]. The Juárez Cartel, at one time the most powerful in Mexico, is a shadow of its former self.

==Charges==
Carrillo Fuentes was charged in a forty-six count indictment in the Western District of [[Texas]] with continuing criminal enterprise, importation and possession with intent to distribute [[cocaine]] and [[marijuana]], conspiracy to import and possess with intent to distribute cocaine and marijuana, as well as with [[money laundering]], tampering with a witness, ordering the intentional killing of individuals to prevent communication of information by them to U.S. law enforcement, and murder in furtherance of a continuing criminal enterprise. The U.S. Departments of State offered a reward of up to $5 million [[USD]] for information leading to the arrest and/or conviction of Vicente Carrillo Fuentes.&lt;ref name=reward&gt;{{cite web|title=FBI – Vicente Carrillo Fuentes|url=https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/cei/vicente-carrillo-fuentes|publisher=[[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]|accessdate=4 October 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BAZ1PHlm?url=http://www.fbi.gov/wanted/cei/vicente-carrillo-fuentes|archivedate=4 October 2012|deadurl=no|location=[[El Paso, Texas]]|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kingpin Act sanction===
On 1 June 2000, the [[United States Department of the Treasury]] sanctioned Carrillo Fuentes under the [[Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act]] (sometimes referred to simply as the "Kingpin Act"), for his involvement in drug trafficking along with eleven other international criminals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DESIGNATIONS PURSUANT TO THE FOREIGN NARCOTICS KINGPIN DESIGNATION ACT|url=http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/narco_designations_kingpin.pdf|publisher=[[United States Department of the Treasury]]|accessdate=28 May 2014|page=1|date=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act prohibited U.S. citizens and companies from doing any kind of business activity with him, and virtually froze all his assets in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An overview of the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act|url=http://www.assetsearchblog.com/uploads/file/drugs.pdf|publisher=[[United States Department of the Treasury]]|accessdate=28 May 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140528053616/http://www.assetsearchblog.com/uploads/file/drugs.pdf|archivedate=28 May 2014|page=1|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest==
Carrillo Fuentes was arrested in a joint operation by the [[Mexican Army]] and [[Federal Police (Mexico)|Federal Police]] in [[Torreón, Coahuila]] on 9 October 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Capturan a ‘El Viceroy’|url=http://www.milenio.com/policia/Amado_Carrillo-Vicente_Carrillo_Fuentes-capturan_a_El_Viceroy-cartel_de_Juarez_0_387561456.html|accessdate=9 October 2014|publisher=[[Milenio]]|date=9 October 2014|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=El Viceroy fue rastreado por su vehículo, confirman PGR y CNS|url=http://www.animalpolitico.com/2014/10/policia-federal-captura-vicente-carrillo-fuentes-lider-del-cartel-de-uarez/|accessdate=15 October 2014|publisher=AnimalPolítico|date=9 October 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015162611/http://www.animalpolitico.com/2014/10/policia-federal-captura-vicente-carrillo-fuentes-lider-del-cartel-de-uarez/|archivedate=15 October 2014|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was then sent to Mexico City and transferred to the federal installations of [[SEIDO]], Mexico's anti-organized crime investigatory agency, where he gave a formal declaration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hernández|first1=Hugo|title=Sigue declarando en la SEIDO Vicente Carrillo|url=http://www.oem.com.mx/laprensa/notas/n3568292.htm|accessdate=14 October 2014|agency=[[Organización Editorial Mexicana]]|publisher=El Sol de México|date=12 October 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014173249/http://www.oem.com.mx/laprensa/notas/n3568292.htm|archivedate=14 October 2014|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, he was formally charged with drug trafficking and organized crime offenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dictan formal prisión a Vicente Carrillo Fuentes|url=http://diario.mx/Nacional/2014-10-14_3887befd/dictan-formal-prision-a-vicente-carrillo-fuentes/|accessdate=15 October 2014|publisher=El Diario de Juárez|date=14 October 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015162226/http://diario.mx/Nacional/2014-10-14_3887befd/dictan-formal-prision-a-vicente-carrillo-fuentes/|archivedate=15 October 2014|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 October 2014, Carrillo Fuentes was transferred to the [[Federal Social Readaptation Center No. 2]], a federal maximum-security prison (commonly referred to as "Puente Grande"), in [[Jalisco]] state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Martínez|first1=Jorge|title=Encarcelan a Vicente Carrillo en penal de Puente Grande|url=http://www.milenio.com/policia/Traslada-Vicente-Carrillo-Puente-Jalisco_0_390561043.html|accessdate=14 October 2014|publisher=[[Milenio]]|date=14 October 2014|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6TK525X2r?url=http://www.milenio.com/policia/Traslada-Vicente-Carrillo-Puente-Jalisco_0_390561043.html|archivedate=14 October 2014|location=Guadalajara, Jalisco|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same day, he was formally charged by a federal court in Jalisco for violating Mexico's [[Federal Law of Firearms and Explosives]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ramírez de Aguilar|first1=Fernando|title=Dictan tres órdenes de formal prisión en contra de Carrillo Fuentes|url=http://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/sociedad/dictan-tres-ordenes-de-formal-prision-en-contra-de-carrillo-fuentes.html|accessdate=15 October 2014|agency=Grupo Multimedia Lauman|publisher=El Financiero|date=14 October 2014|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6TLWaYDn9?url=http://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/sociedad/dictan-tres-ordenes-de-formal-prision-en-contra-de-carrillo-fuentes.html|archivedate=15 October 2014|language=Spanish|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yemaek''' or '''Yamaek''' ({{IPA-ko|jemɛk}}) were an ancient tribal group regarded by many scholars as being one of the several ancestors of the modern [[Koreans|Korean]] ethnic group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Pai|first= Hyung Il|date= 2000|title= Constructing "Korean" Origins: A Critical Review of Archaeology, Historiography, and Racial Myth in Korean State-formation Theories|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=QxztLeLoVkQC&amp;dq=yemaek+korean+ancestor&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|publisher= Harvard University Asia Center|page= 86|isbn=9780674002449|quote= "As the first "Koreans", the Yemaek are considered responsible for the formation of Tan'gun's kingdom of Kochoson"}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Xu|first= Stella Yingzi|date= 2007|title= That Glorious Ancient History of Our Nation: The Contested Re-readings of "Korea" in Early Chinese Historical Records and Their Legacy on the Formation of Korean-ness|url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/304872860|location= Ann Arbor|publisher= Proquest|page= 220|isbn=9780549440369|quote= "The majority of the Kija Choson and Wiman Choson people were Yemaek, the ancestors of the Korean people"}}&lt;/ref&gt; These people most commonly dwelt in [[Manchuria]] and the [[Korean Peninsula]]. They had ancestral ties to various [[Korea]]n kingdoms including [[Gojoseon]], [[Buyeo Kingdom|Buyeo]], [[Goguryeo]], and tribes including [[Okjeo]], [[Dongye]], and Yangmaek (양맥; 梁貊) and Sosumaek (소수맥; 小水貊).

==Origin==
Yemaek is believed to be a combination of Ye (濊·穢·薉) and Maek (貊·貉) people of two neighboring cultures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.readannals.com/forum/attachments/day_070424/20070425_0a55720a0021f13d79fasdtHv3bNuXuT.pdf 关于东北古代史研究的几个问题]&lt;/ref&gt; The main culture is the Xitunshan culture (西团山文化). He Qiutao (何秋涛) said Ye is the short name of [[Buyeo kingdom|Buyeo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zzsck.com/Article/?875.html 民族探幽：夫余与秽貊]&lt;/ref&gt; Dongye first appears in history as a vassal state of [[Gojoseon]] until its fall to China in 108 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;[http://enc.daum.net/dic100/viewContents.do?&amp;m=all&amp;articleID=b05d1565a]&lt;/ref&gt; It was known as the '''Huiyetou''' (穢邪頭) state in [[Shuowen Jiezi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://222.216.4.165:8088/periodical/periodical.articles/hljmzck/hljm2004/0401pdf/040112.pdf the Investigation about the Hui Country]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://kanji-database.sourceforge.net/dict/swjz/v22.html 說文解字第十一篇下]&lt;/ref&gt; It later became a vassal of the increasingly powerful [[Goguryeo]]. According to the Chinese [[Records of Three Kingdoms]], Ye worshiped tigers,&lt;ref&gt;[[Chen Shou]],''[[Records of Three Kingdoms]]'', Volume 30, ''Weizhi'', Chapter 30, ''Dongyizhuan'', "常用十月節祭天，晝夜飲酒歌舞，名之爲舞天，又祭虎以爲神"&lt;/ref&gt; whereas according to ''[[Erya]]'', Maek means bears. [[Gomnaru]], the capital of [[Baekje]], also means the "bear port". Historians suggest tigers and bears may have been [[totems]] worshiped by Ye and Maek tribes.

Several history books suggest [[Gojoseon]], the first Korean kingdom in history, was established by Yemaek.
:*In [[Dangun]]'s ancestry legend of [[Gojoseon]] recorded in [[Samguk Yusa]], a tiger and a bear prayed to [[Hwanung]] that they may become human but had to stay in a cave eating only garlic and mugwort, and while the tiger shortly gave up and left the cave, the bear remained and after 21 days was transformed into a woman who later married Hwanung and then gave birth to [[Dangun Wanggeom]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Il-yeon]], ''[[Samguk Yusa]]'', Vol.1, ''Giyi Chapter I'', [http://www.history.go.kr/url.jsp?ID=NIKH.DB-sy_001r_0020_0020_0020]&lt;/ref&gt; which is believed to symbolize combination of Ye and Maek tribes into one Yemaek tribe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/society/schooling/328862.html Hankyore, 'Why are Korean more familiar with tigers than with bears?'], Dec 21, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
:*Tombstone of Yeon Namsan (연남산) found in [[Luoyang]] says Yeon, son of [[Goguryeo]]'s leader [[Yeon Gaesomun]], is a [[Gojoseon|Joseon]] person.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.go.kr/url.jsp?ID=NIKH.DB-gs_kr_006_0010_0040_0020]&lt;/ref&gt;
:*[[Gojoseon]] is called "Yemaek Joseon" in the Chinese [[Records of the Grand Historian]], which says Yemaek Joseon bordered on [[Xiongnu]] around 200 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sima Qian]],''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'', Vol.110, ''[[Xiongnu]] Liezhuan'',"諸左方王將居東方，直上穀以往者，東接穢貉朝鮮"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==
{{Main|Ye-Maek language|Buyeo languages}}

There have been some academic attempts to recover Yemaek words based on the fragments of [[toponyms]] recorded in the [[Samguk Sagi]] for the areas once possessed by Goguryeo and Buyeo-Baekje.

==Legacy==
According to [[Samguk Sagi]], [[Silla]] was established as a confederacy of six clans composed of [[Gojoseon|Joseon]] refugees,&lt;ref&gt;[[Kim Bu-sik]], ''[[Samguk Sagi]]'', ''Silla Bongi'', Vol.1, "先是朝鮮遺民分居山谷之間爲六村"[http://www.history.go.kr/url.jsp?ID=NIKH.DB-sg_001r_0020_0010]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Royal Seal of Ye (예왕지인; 濊王之印), previously used by [[Buyeo Kingdom|Buyeo]]'s kings, was found in [[Silla]] in 19 AD and presented for King [[Namhae of Silla]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Kim Bu-sik]], ''[[Samguk Sagi]]'', ''Silla Bongi'', Vol.1, "春二月 北溟人耕田 得濊王印獻之"[http://www.history.go.kr/url.jsp?ID=NIKH.DB-sg_001r_0030_0130]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Yukaghir''', or '''Yukagir''' ({{lang-ru|юкаги&amp;#769;ры}}; self-designation: одул (''odul''), деткиль (''detkil'')) are a people in [[Russian Far East]], living in the [[drainage basin|basin]] of the [[Kolyma River]].

==Geographic distribution==
The Tundra Yukaghirs live in the Lower Kolyma region in the [[Sakha Republic]]; the Taiga Yukaghirs in the Upper Kolyma region in the Sakha Republic and in [[Srednekansky District]] of [[Magadan Oblast]]. By the time of Russian [[colonization]] in the 17th century, the Yukaghir tribal groups occupied territories from the [[Lena River]] to the mouth of the [[Anadyr River]]. The number of the Yukaghirs decreased between the 17th and 19th centuries due to [[epidemics]], internecine wars and [[Tsarist]] colonial policy which may have included genocide against the sedentary hunter-fisher Anaouls. Some of the Yukaghirs have assimilated with the [[Yakuts]], [[Evens]], and [[Russians]].

Currently, Yukaghirs live in the [[Sakha Republic]] and the [[Chukotka Autonomous Okrug]] of the Russian Federation. According to the 2002 Census, their total number was 1,509 people, up from 1,112 recorded in the [[Soviet Census (1989)|1989 Census]].

According to the latest 2001 all Ukrainian census, 12 Yukaghirs are living in [[Ukraine]]. Only 2 of them indicated [[Yukaghir languages|Yukaghir]] as their native language. For the remaining others (6) it is [[Russian language|Russian]] and for 1 it is some other tongue.&lt;ref name="2001.ukrcensus.gov.ua"/&gt;

==Subethnic groups==
[[File:Yukaghir shaman.jpg|thumb|400px|Yukaghir [[shaman]], 1902]]
The 13 tribes that once constituted the Yukaghir group are: Vadul-Alais, Odul, Chuvan, Anaoul, Lavren, Olyuben, Omok, Penjin, Khodynts, Khoromoy, Shoromboy, Yandin, and Yandyr. Genetically, Yukaghirs exhibit roughly equal frequencies of the Y-DNA haplogroups [[Haplogroup N-M231|N1c]], [[Haplogroup Q-M242|Q1]], and [[Haplogroup C-M217|C2]] (formerly C3).&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0083570 Investigating the Prehistory of Tungusic Peoples of Siberia and the Amur-Ussuri Region with Complete mtDNA Genome Sequences and Y-chromosomal Markers]&lt;/ref&gt;

The surviving three tribes are the Odul of Nelemnoe, the Vadul of Andryushkino and the Chuvan of the Anadyr river area. Of the extinct groups, the most important were the Khodynts, the Anaoul (both of the Anadyr River area), and the Omok (north of the Chuvan). Sometimes the Chuvan are considered a separate tribe. The Chuvantsy language has been extinct since the early 20th century. In 2002, 1,087 identified themselves as Chuvan compared to more than 1,300 in 1989. The Vadul are mainly involved in reindeer herding while the Odul (Kogime) are mostly hunter-gatherers. The Vadul are also known as Tundra Yukaghir. The Odul are also known as Taiga Yukaghir or Kolyma Yukaghir. The Vadul and Odul languages are as different as [[German language|German]] is from [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. Both are nearing extinction, and Odul is in a much weaker state compared to Vadul. In the 1989 census, more than 700 of the Yukaghirs identified as Vadul while fewer than 400 were Odul.

The Yukaghir are one of the oldest peoples in North-Eastern Asia. Originally they lived over a huge territory from Lake Baikal to the Arctic Ocean. By the time of the first encounter with Russians, Yukaghir were divided into twelve tribes with around 9,000 people. The Yukagir ethnonym is ''Odul'' or ''Vadul'', which means “mighty”.

Tribal divisions among the Yukaghir are fading now, although in every census from 1926, significant number of tribesmen identified themselves with tribal divisions like Anaoul, Odul and Vadul rather than describing themselves as Yukaghir. The Soviet government actively discouraged this tendency and now only the most elderly identify this way. In the 2002 census, out of the 1,509 Yukaghirs, 51 identified themselves as Omok, 40 as Alais, 21 as Odul, 17 as Vadul, 6 as Khangait and 4 as Detkil.

===Clan system===
The head of every clan was an elder called a ''Ligey Shomorokh''. His was the final word in all aspects of life. Hunting leaders were ''Khangitche'', and war leaders were ''Tonbaia Shomorokh'' ("the mighty man"). Women and teenagers had equal voices with men. The internal life of the community was under the control of the older women. Their decisions in those matters were indisputable.

In the beginning of every summer all clans gathered for the ''Sakhadzibe'' festival, where mutual Yukaghir questions were discussed.

In the Yakut-Sakha Republic there are three nomadic extended family communities. These are Tchaila in [[Nizhnekolymsky District]], Teki Odulok in [[Verkhnekolymsky District]] and Ianugail in [[Ust-Yansky District]]. The head of Ianugail is I. I. Tomsky. The community’s main activities are deer hunting and fishing.Tchaila is the biggest of the three. Its head is S. I. Kurilov. They have 4000 domesticated reindeer, 200 horses, and 20 cows. The community also hunts deer and polar foxes. There is also a shop where traditional skin and fur garments are made. The head of Teki Odulok is N. I. Shalugin. Their base is the village of Nelemnoe. This community is in the most difficult situation. Due to the “creative interpretation” of various Perestroika and privatization laws by the local and district administration and so-called businessmen, the community has lost all their reindeer, cows and even part of its land. All they have left are about 50 horses. They have no money for supplies for hunting and fishing. 80% of all adult population is ''de facto'' unemployed.

The highest forum for Yukagir is the all-people gathering ''Suktuul''.

==Culture==
The main traditional activity is nomadic and semi-nomadic hunting of deer, moose, wild sheep, and sable, as well as fishing. Reindeer are bred mostly for transportation. [[Horse]]s are known among the Yukaghir as "domestic reindeer of [[Yakuts]]" (''Yoqod ile'' in [[Tundra Yukaghir language|Tundra Yukaghir]] or ''Yaqad āçə'' in [[Southern Yukaghir language|Kolyma Yukaghir]]). A Yukaghir house is called a ''chum''.

The decline of traditional economic activities, the unfavorable environmental situation of the Yukaghir’s traditional lands and waters, and the absence of local and federal laws and executive mechanisms protecting indigenous peoples in Russia, have not aided the welfare and continuation of traditional Yukaghir communities. The average life span for men is 45 years, and 54 years for women. Child mortality is the highest in the Yakut-Sakha Republic. In addition, one expedition made to the Yukaghir found that most had no knowledge of traditional Yukaghir culture.

===Language===
The [[Yukaghir languages]] are a small language family of two closely related languages, Tundra Yukaghir and Kolyma Yukaghir, although there used to be more. They are unclassified languages: their origin and relation to other languages are unknown; some scholars consider them distantly related to the [[Uralic languages]],&lt;ref name=UralicYukaghir&gt;{{harvnb|Nikolaeva|Mayer|2004|loc=ch. “[http://www.sgr.fi/yukaghir/start1.html About the Yukaghirs]”}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this classification is not accepted by the majority of specialists in Uralic linguistics. The languages are regarded as moribund, since less than 370 people can speak either Yukaghir language. Most Yukaghirs today speak [[Yakut language|Yakut]] and [[Russian language|Russian]].

===Religion===
Alongside Russian Orthodox beliefs, Yukaghirs still practice shamanism. The dominant cults are ancestral spirits, the spirits of Fire, [[Pugu (deity)|Sun (Pugu)]], Hunting, Earth, and Water, which can act as protectors or as enemies of people. The most important is the cult of ''Pugu'', the Sun, who is the highest judge in all disputes. The spirits of the dead go to a place called ''Aibidzi''. Every clan had a shaman called an ''alma''. After death every ''alma'' was treated as a deity, and the body of the dead ''alma'' was dismembered and kept by the clan as relics. The Yukaghir still continue traditions stemming from their origins as nomadic reindeer-hunters: they practice dog sacrifice and have an epic poem based around crows.
