{{History of Kosovo}}
The worst ethnic violence in [[Kosovo]] since the end of the 1999 conflict erupted in the partitioned town of [[Mitrovica, Kosovo|Mitrovica]], leaving hundreds wounded and at least 14 people dead. [[UN]] peacekeepers and [[Nato]] troops scrambled to contain a raging gun battle between Serbs and ethnic Albanians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fourteen dead as ethnic violence sweeps Kosovo|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/mar/18/balkans|website=theguardian.com|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Serbia the events were also called the March Pogrom.

International courts in Pristina have prosecuted several people who attacked several Serbian Orthodox churches, handing down jail sentences ranging from 21 months to 16 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bitter Memories of Kosovo’s Deadly March Riots|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/bitter-memories-of-kosovo-s-deadly-march-riots|website=balkaninsight.com|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{TOC limit|2}}

==Background==
The [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] (KLA) was an ethnic-Albanian [[paramilitary]] organisation which had as its founding goal unification of Albanian inhabited lands in the Balkans, stressing [[Albanian culture]], ethnicity and nation.&lt;ref name="Yoshihara71"&gt;{{harvnb|Yoshihara|2006|p=68}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Perritt29"&gt;{{harvnb|Perritt|2008|p=29}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KoktsidisDam165166"&gt;{{harvnb|Koktsidis|Dam|2008|pp=165–166}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Conflict escalated from 1997 onward due to the Yugoslavian army retaliating with a crackdown in the region resulting in violence and population displacements.&lt;ref name="Yoshihara71"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldman308373"&gt;{{harvnb|Goldman|1997|pp=308, 373}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Allan178"&gt;{{harvnb|Allan|Zelizer|2004|p=178}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The bloodshed, ethnic cleansing of thousands of Albanians driving them into neighbouring countries and the potential of it to destabilize the region provoked intervention by international organizations and agencies, such as the United Nations, NATO and [[International non-governmental organization|INGO]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jordan|first=Robert S.|title=International organizations: A comparative approach to the management of cooperation|p=129|year=2001|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780275965495}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Yoshihara|first=Susan Fink|chapter=Kosovo|pp=67–68|editor1-last=Reveron|editor1-first=Derek S.|editor2-last=Murer|editor2-first=Jeffrey Stevenson|title=Flashpoints in the War on Terrorism|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135449315}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people from non-Albanian communities such as the Serbs and Romani fled Kosovo fearing revenge attacks by armed people and returning refugees while others were pressured by the KLA and armed gangs to leave.&lt;ref name="Herring232234"&gt;{{harvnb|Herring|2000|pp=232–234}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Post conflict Kosovo was placed under an international United Nations framework with the ''[[United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo|UN Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo]]'' (UNMIK) overseeing administrative affairs and the ''[[Kosovo Force|UN Kosovo Force]]'' (KFOR) dealing with defence.&lt;ref name="Herring232"&gt;{{harvnb|Herring|2000|p=232}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Within post-conflict Kosovo Albanian society, calls for retaliation for previous violence done by Serb forces during the war circulated through public culture.&lt;ref name="Herscher14"&gt;{{harvnb|Herscher|2010|p=14}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, prolonged negotiations over Kosovo's future status, sociopolitical problems and nationalist sentiments resulted in the Kosovo unrest.&lt;ref name="RauschBanar246"&gt;{{harvnb|Rausch|Banar|2006|p=246}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Egleder79"&gt;{{harvnb|Egleder|2013|p=79}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prelude==
===Shooting of Serbian teen===
On 15 March 2004 an 18-year-old Serb, Jovica Ivić, was murdered in a drive-by shooting in the village of [[Čaglavica]] in the central region of Kosovo.&lt;ref name="15march-B92"&gt;{{cite news|title=U Čaglavici pucano na srpskog mladića iz automobila u pokretu|url=http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2004&amp;mm=03&amp;dd=15&amp;nav_category=12&amp;nav_id=135320|accessdate=21 December 2014|agency=Beta|publisher=B92|date=15 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===16 March pro-KLA protests===
On 16 March, three KLA war veterans associations organized widespread demonstrations in ethnic Albanian cities and towns, protesting the arrests of former KLA leaders on war crime charges, including the February arrests of four commanders.{{sfn|Bouckaert|2004|p=17}} The pro-KLA, anti-UNMIK protests, with 18,000 protesters, lay the basis for the following demonstrations sparked by the sensational reports of drowning of three Albanian children.{{sfn|Bouckaert|2004|p=18}}

===Drowning of Albanian children===
On 16 March, three Albanian children drowned in the Ibar River in the village of Čabar, near the Serb community of [[Zubin Potok]]. A fourth boy survived. It was speculated that he and his friends had been chased into the river by Serbs in revenge for the shooting of Ivić the previous day, but this claim has not been proven.&lt;ref name="bbc-no-evidence"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3667839.stm | publisher = BBC | title = No evidence over Kosovo drownings  | date=2004-04-28 | accessdate=2010-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UN police spokesman Neeraj Singh said the surviving boy had been under intense pressure from ethnic Albanian journalists who had suggested what he should say. His version of events differed from that of two other children who had also been in the river, Singh told a news conference in Pristina. The spokesperson said there were "very significant" inconsistencies in the accounts given by the child during two separate interviews, and a lack of corroboration of his story. "In fact, it is logically at odds in several respects with other evidence," Mr. Singh said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reliefweb.int/node/146375|title=Lack of evidence stalls probe into drowning of 3 Kosovo children, UN Mission says|work=ReliefWeb|accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="setimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/bs/features/setimes/features/2004/04/040429-SVETLA-001|title=UN Investigation Clears Serbs of Kosovo Drownings|date=29 April 2004|publisher=|accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UN found no evidence that Serbs were responsible for drowning the three Albanian children.&lt;ref name="setimes.com"/&gt;

==Violence==
{{moresources|section|date=July 2018}}
[[File:Facade of Serb House Destroyed in 2004 Pogrom - Prizren - Kosovo - 02.jpg|thumb|250px|Ruins of a Kosovo Serb house in [[Prizren]] that was destroyed by rioters.]]

On 17 and 18 March 2004, a wave of violent riots swept through Kosovo, triggered by two incidents perceived as ethnically-motivated acts. Demonstrations, although seemingly spontaneous at the outset, quickly focused on Serbs throughout Kosovo.
27 people were killed (11 Kosovo Albanians, 16 Kosovo Serbs), more than 900 persons were injured (including 65 international police officers and 58 Kosovo Police Service officers), and more than 800 buildings destroyed or damaged (including 29 churches or monasteries). 

By one estimate, more than 50,000 people participated in the riots. The Legal System Monitoring Section of the OSCE Mission in Kosovo (“the OSCE”) has closely monitored the investigations and trials from March 2004 until present. With its monitoring of 73 cases (Municipal, District and Minor Offences Courts) pending between December 2005 and March 2008, the OSCE now follows up on a first report of December 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Organization for Security an d Co-operation in Europe MISSION IN KOSOVO Monitoring Department, Legal System Monitoring Section|url=https://www.osce.org/kosovo/32700?download=true|website=osce.org|publisher=OSCE|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thousands of Albanians gathered at the south end of the bridge across the Ibar at [[Kosovska Mitrovica]], which divides the Serb and Albanian districts of the town. A large crowd of Serbs gathered at the north end to prevent the Albanians from crossing. Peacekeepers from the NATO-led Kosovo Force (KFOR) blockaded the bridge, using tear gas, rubber bullets and stun grenades to keep the crowds apart. However, gunmen on both sides opened fire with sub-machine guns and grenades, killing at least eight people (two Albanians and six Serbs) and wounding over 300. Eleven peacekeepers were also injured, of which two seriously.

The violence quickly spread to other parts of Kosovo, with Kosovo Serb communities and Serbian cultural heritage (churches and monasteries) attacked by crowds of Albanians. Serb returnees were attacked.{{sfn|B92 Specijal|2004}} Some of the locations were ostensibly under the protection of KFOR at the time. During the riots and violence, eight Serbs were killed. Among damaged property were at least 35 churches, including 18 [[Cultural Heritage of Serbia|monuments of culture]], demolished, burnt or severely damaged.&lt;ref name="B92-1"/&gt; The casualty toll at the end of the day was 28 and 600 people were injured, including 61 peacekeepers and 55 police officers.

===Čaglavica===
In [[Čaglavica]], 12,000 Kosovo Albanian rioters tried to storm the Serb-populated areas. Norwegian [[Kosovo Force|KFOR]] peacekeepers created a blockade by using tear gas, rubber bullets, and stun grenades, in order to keep the two groups apart. A truck was driven by a Kosovo Albanian at full speed towards the barricade in an attempt to penetrate the line. After firing warning shots at the truck, the Norwegians had to use deadly force to avoid friendly casualties, and shot the driver. 16 Norwegian peacekeepers were injured, and 13 had to be evacuated.&lt;ref name="forsvaret-video"&gt;{{cite AV media|people=Kjell-Olav Myhre|year=2014|title=Kosovo 2004: 12000 kosovoalbanerne angriper den kosovoserbiske landsbyen Caglavica|trans-title=Kosovo 2004: 12,000 Kosovo Albanians assault the Kosovo Serb village of Caglavica|language=Norwegian|url=http://forsvaret.no/sites/video/PublishingImages/veterandagen-2014-kjellolav/veteran-2014-kjellolavmyhre.mp4|accessdate=9 May 2014|publisher=Forsvaret (Norwegian Armed Forces)|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714072330/http://forsvaret.no/sites/video/PublishingImages/veterandagen-2014-kjellolav/veteran-2014-kjellolavmyhre.mp4|archivedate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another KFOR unit consisting of mostly Swedish soldiers also participated in defending Čaglavica that day, supported by people from the barracks who normally worked with non-military tasks. Lieutenant Colonel Hans Håkansson, who commanded 700 people during the unrest, reported that the fighting went on for 11 hours, and that many collapsed due to dehydration and injuries while struggling to fend off waves of rioters.&lt;ref name=Zaremba&gt;{{cite news|last=Zaremba|first=Maciej|title=Mandom, mod och landstingstossor|url=http://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/kulturdebatt/mandom-mod-och-landstingstossor|accessdate=9 May 2014|newspaper=Dagens Nyheter|date=15 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total, 35 people were injured while defending the town.&lt;ref name=Zaremba/&gt; Hans Håkansson was awarded with a medal for his actions by the [[Royal Swedish Academy of War Sciences]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gotländsk militär får belöningsmedalj|url=http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=94&amp;artikel=729267|accessdate=11 January 2015|agency=Sveriges Radio|publisher=P4 Gotland|date=8 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Priština===
Following the attacks in [[Čaglavica]], the mob of Albanians turned their attention on the few remaining Serbs living in [[Priština]] in the YU Program apartments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/report/2004/07/25/failure-protect/anti-minority-violence-kosovo-march-2004 |title=Failure to Protect,Anti-Minority Violence in Kosovo, March 2004|publisher=Human Rights Watch |accessdate=2018-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The apartments came under attack after the mob of Albanians blocked all of the entrances and set fire to the ground floors. Serbs who tried to flee the apartments were shot at by firearms or stabbed by members of the crowd. The mob began to loot apartments and were chanting pro [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] chants and calling for the killing of Serbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/report/2004/07/25/failure-protect/anti-minority-violence-kosovo-march-2004 |title=Failure to Protect,Anti-Minority Violence in Kosovo, March 2004|publisher=Human Rights Watch |accessdate=2018-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It took [[Kosovo Force|KFOR]] and [[UNMIK]] police over 6 hours to evacuate the Serbs who were under constant fire from armed Albanians. Following the evacuation the crowd began to converge on the [[Church of Christ the Saviour, Pristina| Church of the Christ Savour]] burning and damaging the facade and inside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/report/2004/07/25/failure-protect/anti-minority-violence-kosovo-march-2004 |title=Failure to Protect,Anti-Minority Violence in Kosovo, March 2004|publisher=Human Rights Watch |accessdate=2018-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peć===
Albanians rioted in the city of [[Peć]], attacking [[UN]] offices. One Albanian was killed by UN police.{{sfn|B92 Specijal|2004}} Serb returnees were attacked at [[:sh:Belo Polje (Pe%C4%87)|Belo Polje]].{{sfn|B92 Specijal|2004}}

===Lipljan===
Albanians and KFOR were engaged in gunfights in the town of [[Lipljan]]. Four Serbs were murdered, while Serbs taking refuge in the local Orthodox church were attacked.{{sfn|B92 Specijal|2004}}

===Vučitrn===
All Serb houses in the Serb-inhabited village of [[Svinjare]] in Vučitrn, near Kosovska Mitrovica, were burnt down.&lt;ref name=Zaremba/&gt;

===Prizren===
On 17 March, ethnic Albanians started attacking the Serb settlement in Prizren, including the Seminary, and reportedly there was no UNMIK, [[Kosovo Police]] and KFOR present there at the time.{{sfn|Bouckaert|2004|p=54}} The mob set the Seminary on fire, with people inside, and beat several elder people, with one man dying in the burning.{{sfn|Bouckaert|2004|pp=54-55}} 

The German KFOR's refusal to mobilize to protect the local Serbs are one of the main security failures of the 2004 unrest.{{sfn|Bouckaert|2004|p=55}} UNMIK in Prizren said that the terror, 56 Serb houses and 5 historical churches that were burnt down, could have been prevented by the KFOR.{{sfn|Bouckaert|2004|p=55}}

==Destroyed churches==

==Reactions in Kosovo==
Kosovo Albanian politicians such as President [[Ibrahim Rugova]] and Prime Minister [[Bajram Rexhepi]] joined UN governor Harri Holkeri, NATO southern commander Gregory Johnson, and other KFOR officials in condemning the violence and appealing for peace in Kosovo.{{sfn|Bouckaert|2004|p=59}}

Kosovo Police established a special investigation team to handle cases related to the 2004 unrest and according to Kosovo Judicial Council by the end of 2006 the 326 charges filed by municipal and district prosecutors for criminal offenses in connection with the unrest had resulted in 200 indictments: convictions in 134 cases, and courts acquitted eight and dismissed 28; 30 cases were pending.

==Reactions in Serbia==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2018}}
The events in Kosovo brought an immediate angry reaction on the streets of Serbia. On the evening of 17 March, crowds gathered in [[Belgrade]], [[Novi Sad]] and [[Niš]] to demonstrate against the treatment of the Kosovo Serbs. Despite appeals for calm by [[Amfilohije Radović|Metropolitan Amfilohije]], the 17th-century [[Bajrakli Mosque, Belgrade|Bajrakli Mosque]] was set on fire. Islam Aga mosque in the southern city of Niš was also set on fire, while demonstrators chanted "Kill, kill Albanians!" When police arrived the mosque was already burning and some media reported that the police didn't move the crowd, so they blocked the fire fighters access to the mosque, leaving them unable to extinguish the fire.&lt;ref name="hrw.org"&gt;[http://hrw.org/reports/2005/serbia1005/4.htm#_Toc115505925 Dangerous Indifference: Violence against Minorities in Serbia: March 2004 Violence Against Albanians and Muslims&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Both buildings were extensively damaged but were saved from complete destruction by the intervention of police and firefighters.&lt;ref name="f18"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.forum18.org/Archive.php?article_id=280 | publisher = [[F18 News]] | work = KOSOVO &amp; SERBIA | title = Churches &amp; mosques destroyed amid inter-ethnic violence | accessdate= 23 May 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also properties of Muslim minorities, such as Goranis, Turks or Albanians were vandalized in Novi Sad and other cities throughout Serbia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/reports/2005/serbia1005/4.htm|title=Dangerous Indifference: Violence against Minorities in Serbia: March 2004 Violence Against Albanians and Muslims|publisher=|accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human Rights Watch has concluded that the Serbian state failed to prosecute violence in Novi Sad.&lt;ref name="hrw.org"/&gt;

The Serbian government publicly denounced the violence in Kosovo. Prime Minister [[Vojislav Koštunica]] strongly criticized the failure of NATO and the UN to prevent the violence, and called for a state of emergency to be imposed on Kosovo. He gave a speech blaming organized Albanian separatists: "The events in northern Kosovo-Metohija reveal the true nature of Albanian separatism, its violent and terrorist nature ...  [The government will] do all it can to stop the terror in Kosovo".&lt;ref name="bbc-media"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3523916.stm | publisher = BBC | title = Media fan Kosovo flames  | date=2004-03-18 | accessdate=2009-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Minister of Minority Rights of [[Serbia and Montenegro]], Rasim Ljajić, himself a Muslim, said "What is now happening in Kosovo confirms two things: that this is a collapse of the international mission, and a total defeat of the international community." Nebojsa Čović, the Serbian government's chief negotiator on matters relating to Kosovo, was sent to Kosovska Mitrovica on March 18 in a bid to calm the situation there. Serbian security forces also guarded the border between Serbia and Kosovo in a bid to prevent demonstrators and paramilitaries from entering the province to foment further unrest. The events were compared by Prime Minister Koštunica to [[ethnic cleansing]].&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3551571.stm | work=BBC News | title=Kosovo clashes 'ethnic cleansing' | date=20 March 2004 | accessdate=22 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Serbs, represented by the "Union of Serbs in Kosovo and Metohija", described the ordeal as "genocide" in a letter sent to the Serbian and Russian patriarchs, to Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] and the Serbian government, where, besides that, they quote the burning of seven villages during the World War II-German occupation to the "several hundreds" burnt "under the rule of the troops of Christian Europe and America" and according to which the "occupation of Kosovo surpasses all we had to sustain under fascism." The spared Serb villages are compared to "concentration camps" because of the missing [[freedom of movement]], electricity and heating. According to the letter, after 1999 there were 8,500 homicides or disappearances of non-Albanian people with no single accomplice tried.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pravoslavie.ru/news/060415154741 Full text of the letter] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120910124959/http://www.pravoslavie.ru/news/060415154741 |date=2012-09-10 }} in Russian, in the name of 120 000 Serbs in Kosovo and Metohija&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, seven years after the incident, Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremić spoke at the Wheaton College in Chicago:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In less than 72 hours, 35 churches and monasteries were set on fire, many of which date back to the 14th century or even further away in history, which represents an irretrievable loss for the mankind. Dozens of people were killed. Several thousand were wounded. Thousands of houses and shops were leveled to the ground. More than 4,000 Kosovo Serbs were expelled from their homes.&lt;ref name="B92-1"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Serbia the events were also called the March Pogrom.&lt;ref name="WashingtonTimes"&gt;[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2005/apr/9/20050409-102733-9741r/ Anti-Serb programs in Kosovo], By The Washington Times&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="B92-1"&gt;B92.net, ''[http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics.php?yyyy=2011&amp;mm=03&amp;dd=18&amp;nav_id=73300 FM talks Kosovo at U.S. college]'', 18 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rts.rs/page/stories/ci/story/1/%D0%A1%D1%80%D0%B1%D0%B8%D1%98%D0%B0/570011/%D0%A8%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82+%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B0+%D0%BE%D0%B4+%D0%BC%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B3+%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B0+.html Шест година од мартовског погрома] RTS.rs&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/naslovna/teme/teme.97.html:tema-167-Martovski-pogrom Martovski pogrom] Večernje novosti&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pravoslavie.ru/news/51111.htm|title=ЕПИСКОП ФЕОДОСИЙ ПРОТИВ ПЕРЕДАЧИ МОНАСТЫРЯ ПОД ОХРАНУ КОСОВСКОЙ ПОЛИЦЕЙСКОЙ СЛУЖБЫ|publisher=|accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International reaction==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2018}}

The international community was taken by surprise by the sudden upsurge in violence. Kosovo had been fairly quiet since the end of 1999, although there had been occasional small-scale ethnic clashes throughout the past five years and an ongoing tension between Serbs and Albanians. This had, however, largely gone unnoticed by the Western media since 1999.

KFOR troops closed Kosovo's borders with the remainder of Serbia and Montenegro and the UN suspended flights in and out of the province. NATO announced on 18 March that it would send another 1,000 troops – 750 of them from the [[United Kingdom]] – to reinforce the 18,500 troops already there.&lt;ref name="nato"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nato.int/shape/news/2004/03/i040318a.htm |title=NATO deploys "prudent reinforcements" to Kosovo in response to violence |publisher=[[NATO]] |accessdate=23 May 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060529195314/http://www.nato.int/shape/news/2004/03/i040318a.htm |archivedate=29 May 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UN and [[European Union]] both appealed for calm, calling on local leaders to restrain their supporters. [[UN Secretary General]] [[Kofi Annan]] urged both sides to cooperate with the peacekeeping forces but pointedly reminded the Kosovo Albanians that they had a responsibility "to protect and promote the rights of all people within Kosovo, particularly its minorities".

An Austrian [[OSCE]] official called the events an orchestrated plan to drive out the remaining Serbs, while one anonymous UNMIK official reportedly referred to the event as ''Kosovo's [[Kristallnacht]]''. The commander of NATO's South Flank, Admiral [[Gregory G. Johnson]], said on 19 March that the violence verged on ethnic cleansing of Serbs by Albanians. On 20 March, Kosovo's UN administrator, [[Harri Holkeri]], told journalists that "Maybe the very beginning was spontaneous but after the beginning certain extremist groups had an opportunity to orchestrate the situation and that is why we urgently are working to get those perpetrators into justice."&lt;ref name="bbc-blame"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3553837.stm | publisher = BBC | title = Kosovo clashes 'orchestrated'  | date=2004-03-20 | accessdate=2009-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Amnesty International]], at least 19 people died—11 Albanians and eight Serbs—and over 1,000 were injured while some 730 houses belonging to minorities, mostly Kosovo Serbs, as well as 36 Orthodox churches, monasteries and other religious and cultural sites were damaged or destroyed. In less than 48 hours, 4,100 minority community members were newly displaced (more than the total of 3,664 that had returned throughout 2003), of whom 82% were Serbs and the remaining 18% included Romani (and Ashkali) as well as an estimated 350 Albanians from the Serb-majority areas of [[Kosovska Mitrovica]] and [[Leposavić]].

*{{flagicon|France}} [[France]] pledged to send about 400 more troops immediately to the region after the violence began.&lt;ref name="kosovo clashes" /&gt;

*{{flagicon|Serbia}} Serbian Prime Minister [[Vojislav Koštunica]] described the attacks as "planned in advance and co-ordinated... this was an attempted pogrom and ethnic cleansing" against Kosovo's Serbs.&lt;ref name="kosovo clashes" /&gt;

'''24th Ruler''' was an ''[[ajaw]]'' of the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] city of [[Tikal]]. He ruled c.645. Information about this ''ajaw'' and his predecessor [[23rd Ruler]] are next to nothing. K'inich Muwaan Jol II is the best candidate to be 23rd or 24th Ruler because he could be a father of 25th ''ajaw'' [[Nuun Ujol Chaak]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin &amp; Grube 2008, p.42.&lt;/ref&gt;

The film stars [[Sigourney Weaver]], [[Felicity Jones]], [[Toby Kebbell]], [[Lewis MacDougall]], and [[Liam Neeson]], and tells the story of Conor (MacDougall), a child whose mother (Jones) is [[Terminal illness|terminally ill]]; one night, he is visited by a monster in the form of a giant anthropomorphic yew tree (Neeson), who states that he will come back and tell Conor three stories. The film is an [[international co-production]] between Spain, United Kingdom and the United States.&lt;ref name=tiff/&gt;

''A Monster Calls'' premiered at the [[2016 Toronto International Film Festival]] on 10 September 2016. It was then released in Spain on 7 October 2016, and in the United Kingdom on 1 January 2017. In the United States, the film began a limited release in on 23 December 2016, followed by a wide release on 6 January 2017. It received positive reviews, being praised for its themes, directing, performances and visual effects, but underperformed at the box office, grossing $47 million worldwide on a budget of $43 million.&lt;ref name=BOM/&gt;

==Plot==
&lt;!--PLEASE READ: Per WP: FILM PLOT, plots are 400-700 words only--&gt;
Twelve-year-old Conor O'Malley must face his mother's terminal cancer, his strict grandmother, his estranged father and the school bully, Harry. One night at 12:07&amp;nbsp;a.m., Conor is visited by the tree-like Monster, who tells Conor it has to come to tell him three true stories, after which Conor must tell the Monster his own story: the truth behind his nightmare, which Conor refuses to do.

; First story
An old king who has lost his entire family (with his sons killed in fierce battles and his wife committing suicide in her grief) save a young grandson, remarries a beautiful young woman. He dies before the prince comes of age, and many believe the queen poisoned the king. Not wanting to hand the kingdom over to the prince in a year, she plots to marry the prince and remain queen. The prince runs away with a farm girl he loves. They stop and sleep under a yew tree (the Monster), but in the morning he finds the young woman murdered. The prince tells the villagers that the queen, a witch, must have done it, and they rally to overthrow her. Before the commoners can reach the queen, the Monster carries her away to a far-off land where she lives out the rest of her life in peace. Though she was indeed a witch, she did not kill the farm girl or the king, who actually died of old age. The prince had murdered the farm girl himself in order to inspire his people to back him into overthrowing the queen. After the queen was taken to safety by the Monster, the prince continued to rule the kingdom in the grandfather's place.

; Second story
An [[apothecary]] follows old traditions and beliefs, using herbs and brews to cure ailments. His business becomes less popular as a local [[parson]] tells his congregation not to accept the apothecary's old ways and denying the apothecary use of an old Yew tree. When the parson's two daughters become sick, the parson asks the apothecary to save their lives after all other resources are exhausted. When the apothecary asks why he should help a man who has turned people away from his skills and denied him the yew tree, his best source of healing ingredients, the parson promises to give him the tree and deliver the parishioners to him as customers. Yet the apothecary says that he cannot help, and the girls die. The Monster awakens from the yew tree to destroy the parson's house and raze it to the ground as punishment.

While the apothecary was a greedy man, he was a healer and would have saved lives, including the girls', if the parson had allowed him his way of life. The parson was a man of belief but was willing to discard his beliefs when they were in the way. The healing traditions followed by the apothecary require belief in order to work; without the parson's, the apothecary was unable to treat the two girls. Belief is half the cure.

; Third story
A man was invisible because no one ever saw him. Tired of this, he summoned the Monster to ensure people would notice him. Though people now notice him, the man finds himself more alone than before.

; Fourth story
Conor must confront his nightmare to tell the fourth story. His mother has been pulled to the edge of a cliff by a sudden collapse of the ground, and Conor must hold her hand to save her from falling. Eventually, his grip fails and his mother falls. The Monster forces Conor to confess the truth: Conor loosened his grip on purpose. While he could have held on longer, he let go in order to stop the pain of having to hold on.

Through the Monster, Conor ultimately understands that although he does not want his mother to die, it is something he must accept, and he must not feel guilty for wanting it to be over so he does not have to feel pain anymore. After this, Conor returns, with the Monster by his side, to comfort his mother one last time, and she dies at 12:07. He returns home with his grandmother, with whom he has reached an understanding, and she gives Conor the room that used to be his mother's. In the room, he finds his mother's old art book, which depicts the stories that were told to him by the Monster, and a drawing of his mother as a child with the Monster.

'''Abbo of Auxerre''' was a [[Benedictine]] abbot and [[bishop of Auxerre]].

He had been a monk, and later abbot, of the [[Abbey of Saint-Germain d'Auxerre]], and succeeded his brother [[Heribald of Auxerre]] as bishop of Auxerre. He resigned from the see in 859. He assisted in the synod of Poncy in 860, and died on 3 December that year. He is not listed in the [[Roman Martyrology]], the official but incomplete list of saints recognized by the [[Roman Catholic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;''Martyrologium Romanum'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2001, {{ISBN|88-209-7210-7}})&lt;/ref&gt; His biography is included in ''[[Les Petits Bollandistes]]''.

'''Agüeybaná II''' (c. 1470{{spaced ndash}}1511), born '''Güeybaná''' and also known as '''Agüeybaná El Bravo''' (English: ''Agüeybaná The Brave''), was one of the two principal and most powerful ''[[cacique]]s'' of the [[Taíno people]] in "[[Puerto Rico|Borikén]]" when the [[Spanish people|Spaniards]] first arrived in [[Puerto Rico]] on November 19, 1493. Agüeybaná II led the Taínos of Puerto Rico in the Battle of Yagüecas, also known as the "[[Taíno rebellion of 1511]]" against [[Juan Ponce de León]] and the Spanish [[Conquistador]]s.&lt;ref name="c"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120206012148/http://www.pcmle.org/EM/article.php3?id_article=258 ''La Rebelión del Cacique Agüeybaná II.''] En Marcha: Organo del Comite Central del Partido Comunista Maxista Leninista de Ecuador.

==Etimology==
''Agüeybana'', which has been interpreted by 19th and 20th-century authors as meaning "The Great Sun", was the hereditary title shared by the family that ruled the theocratic monarchy of Borikén, governing the hierarchy over the rest of the regional chiefs or caciques. Like other nobiliary recognitions within Taíno culture, it was passed down through the maternal bloodline. The Spanish Hispanicized the title to be the equivalent of the European concept of [[king]]s, with contemporary writers such as [[Juan de Castellanos]] employing the title of ''Rey Agüeybana'' (literally meaning "King Agüeybana") when referring to him after inheriting it from his brother and becoming the second monarch to lead the Taíno during the 1510s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-5lSAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA125 ''Elegias de Varones illustres de Indias.''] Juan de Castellanos. Biblioteca de Autores Españoles: Desde la Formacion del Lenguaje Hasta Nuestros Dias. (Commissioned by D. Buenaventura Carlos Aribau.) Second Edition. Madrid: M. Rivadeneyra. p. 125. 1857.

== Arrival of the Conquistadors ==
[[Agüeybaná I|Agüeybaná]], the older, received Spanish [[conquistador]] [[Juan Ponce de León]] upon Ponce de León's arrival to Puerto Rico in 1508. According to an old Taíno tradition, Agüeybaná practiced the "guaytiao", a Taíno ritual in which he and Juan Ponce de León became friends and exchanged names.&lt;ref name="d"&gt;[http://www.periodicolaperla.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4540:del-mito-al-hito-conozca-la-brava-defensa-de-los-tainos&amp;catid=119:articulos&amp;Itemid=342 ''Del mito al hito: la defensa de los taínos.''] Héctor L. Sánchez. La Perla del Sur. Ponce, Puerto Rico. 26 December 2012. (Title in printed version: "Del mito al hito: Conozca la brave defensa de los tainos." Year 31. Issue 1517. Page 28.) Retrieved 26 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The hospitality and friendly treatment that the Spaniards received from Agüeybaná made it easy for the Spaniards to betray and conquer the island later.&lt;ref name="a" /&gt; Agüeybaná's actions helped to maintain the peace between the Taíno and the Spaniards, a peace which was to be short-lived.&lt;ref name="a" /&gt;

== Taíno rebellion of 1511==
{{Main|Taíno rebellion of 1511}}
Upon the senior Agüeybaná's death in 1510, his brother &lt;ref name="c" /&gt;&lt;ref name="a" /&gt; Güeybaná (better known as Agüeybaná II) became the most powerful Cacique in the entire island. Agüeybaná II had his doubts about the "godly" status of the Spaniards. He came up with a plan to test the perceived godly nature of the Spanish: he and [[Urayoán]] (cacique of [[Añasco, Puerto Rico|Añasco]]) sent some of their tribe members to lure a Spaniard by the name of [[Diego Salcedo (soldier)|Diego Salcedo]] into a river and drown him. They watched over Salcedo's body to make sure that he would not resuscitate. Salcedo's death was enough to convince him and the rest of the Taíno people that the Spaniards were not gods.&lt;ref name="c" /&gt;&lt;ref name="a" /&gt;

Agüeybaná II, held ''Areytos'' (war dances) or secret meetings with others caciques where he organized a revolt against the Spaniards. Cristobal de Sotomayor sent a spy, Juan González, to one of the ''Areitos'' where  he learned of Agüeybaná's plans.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7mhDAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq=agueybana+#PPA180,M1 ''Puerto Rico y su historia: Investigaciones críticas.''] Salvador Brau. Valencia, España: Imprenta Francisco Vives Mora. 1894. Pages 64 and 180. Retrieved 14 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of the warning, Agüeybana II killed Sotomayor and his men, and gravely wounded González. Juan González escaped making his way to [[Caparra Archaeological Site|Caparra]] where he reported the killings to Ponce de León.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=c2ESAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA39 ''Annual Report of the Bureau of American Ethnology to the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.''] W.

Retrieved 14 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, [[Guarionex]], cacique of Utuado, attacked the village of Sotomayor (present day [[Aguada, Puerto Rico|Aguada]]) and killed eighty of its inhabitants.

'''Goodwife "Goody" Ann Glover''' (died November 16, 1688) was the last person to be hanged in [[Boston]] as a [[witch]], although the [[Salem witch trials]] in nearby [[Salem, Massachusetts]], occurred mainly in 1692.

==Early life==
[[File:Witch in the Salem Witch Trials.jpg|thumb|467x467px|An accused "witch" during the witch trials in the late 1600s]]

Hogan has listed the four primary contemporary sources for Glover's life: 

*1 - [[Cotton Mather]]’s ''Memorable Providences'' (1689), with further information in ''Magnalia Christi Americana'' (1702).
*2 - Joshua Moody’s account in his letter to [[Increase Mather]], dated the 4 October 1688.
*3 - ''More Wonders of the Invisible World'', written by Boston merchant [[Robert Calef]] (1700). 
*4 - The diary of Judge [[Samuel Sewall]], which mentions Glover in passing, yet is important as it is the only one that dates her execution.

All other sources considerably post-date events. Starting with Fr. [[James Fitton (priest)|James Fitton]]'s account in 1872, Rev. Sherwood Healy (1876), Bernard Corr (1891), and Harold Dijon (1905), George Francis O’Dwyer (1921), Michael O’Brien (1937), John Henry Cutler (1962),  Rev. Vincent A. Lapomarda (1989-90), Margaret E. Fitzgerald and Joseph A. King (1990), ''White Cargo'' (2008), Alan Titley (2011-14), Prof. Robert Allison of Suffolk University, Boston (2014), all added various fictions to her biography [https://medium.com/@Limerick1914/the-murder-of-goodwife-glover-in-boston-and-the-politicisation-of-her-death-two-centuries-later-via-90ab171fe576].

All that can be said of her early life is that she was born in [[Ireland]], apparently transported to [[Barbados]] after the [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland|Cromwell's invasion of Ireland]].

==Life in Boston==
By 1680, Ann and her daughter Mary were living in Boston — at the time, part of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] — where they worked as housekeepers for [[John Goodwin (mason)|John Goodwin]]. In the summer of 1688, Martha Goodwin (age 13) accused Ann Glover's daughter of stealing laundry. This caused Ann to have a fierce argument with Martha and the Goodwin children, which then supposedly caused them to become ill and to start acting strangely.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unamsanctamcatholicam.com/component/content/article/79-history/279-anti-catholicism-in-the-salem-witch-trials.html|title=Unam Sanctam Catholicam|last=Boniface|website=www.unamsanctamcatholicam.com|access-date=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The doctor who was called suggested it was caused by [[witchcraft]], because he could not offer another diagnosis or heal the children. Martha and the other children seemed to be "bewitched" &lt;ref&gt;''The Genealogical Dictionary of New England'' (ed. James Savage).&lt;/ref&gt;

Glover was arrested and tried for [[witchcraft]]. Her answers could not be understood, and for a time her accusers thought she was speaking a language of the devil, but it became clear that this was not the case. In the words of her leading accuser, the Reverend [[Cotton Mather]], “the court could have no answer from her but in the [[Irish language|Irish]] which was her native language…” (''Memorable Providence'', 1689). By that time she had apparently lost the ability to speak English, though she could still understand it. An interpreter was found for her and the trial proceeded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mac Aonghusa |first=Proinsias | contribution=An Ghaeilge i Meiriceá|journal=Go Meiriceá Siar |editor=Stiofán Ó hAnnracháin|year=1979 |publisher=An Clóchomhar Tta |pages=14–15|isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cotton Mather wrote that Glover was "a scandalous old Irishwoman, very poor, a Roman Catholic and obstinate in idolatry."&lt;ref&gt;[[Magnalia Christi Americana]], Cotton Mather, 1702.&lt;/ref&gt; At her trial it was demanded of her to say the Lord's Prayer. She recited it in Irish and broken Latin, but was unable to say it in English.&lt;ref name="historical"&gt;''Historical Records and Studies, Volume 17'', pp. 70-78.&lt;/ref&gt; There was a belief that an inability to recite the Lord's prayer was the mark of a witch. Her house was searched and "small images" or doll-like figures were found. When Mather was interrogating her she supposedly said that she prayed to a host of spirits and Mather took this to mean that these spirits were demons.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Many of the accusations against Ann used [[spectral evidence]], which cannot be proven. Cotton Mather visited Glover in prison where he said that she supposedly engaged in night-time trysts with the devil and other evil spirits. It was considered that Ann might not be of sound mind and could possibly be mentally ill. Five of the six physicians who examined her found her to be competent. She was therefore pronounced guilty and put to death by hanging.

On November 16, 1688, Glover was hanged in Boston amid mocking shouts from the crowd.&lt;ref&gt;''History of the United States, Volume II'', Bancroft, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; When she was taken out to be hanged she said that her death would not relieve the children of their malady. There are several testaments as to her final words. According to some she said that the children would keep suffering because she was not the only witch to have afflicted them, but when asked to name the other witches, she refused. Another account says that Glover said that killing her would be useless because it was someone else who had bewitched the children.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.irishcentral.com/roots/goody-ann-glover-irish-native-was-the-last-witch-hanged-in-boston-video-150184495-237445461.html|title="Goody" Ann Glover, Irish native was the last witch hanged in Boston (VIDEO)|date=2015-10-15|website=IrishCentral.com|access-date=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Either way, Ann Glover did believe in witches. A Boston merchant who knew her, [[Robert Calef]], said that "Goody Glover was a despised, crazy, poor old woman, an Irish Catholic who was tried for afflicting the Goodwin children. Her behavior at her trial was like that of one distracted. They did her cruel. The proof against her was wholly deficient. The jury brought her guilty. She was hung. She died a Catholic."&lt;ref&gt;''More Wonders of the Invisible World'', London, 1700.&lt;/ref&gt;

The evidence adduced against her is open to question. When Glover told Mather that she prayed to a host of spirits she may have been talking about Catholic saints. The dolls she had in her possession and which were believed to have been used for witchcraft might actually have been crude representations of Catholic saints. The majority of the population at that time and place was [[Puritan]], and there was Puritan prejudice against [[Catholics]].

One contemporary writer recorded that, "There was a great concourse of people to see if the Papist would relent, her one cat was there, fearsome to see. They would to destroy the cat, but Mr. Calef would not permit it. Before her executioners she was bold and impudent, making to forgive her accusers and those who put her off. She predicted that her death would not relieve the children saying that it was not she that afflicted them."&lt;ref name="historical" /&gt;

Ann's daughter Mary reportedly suffered a mental break from the strain of her mother's trial: "her mind gave way under the strain," and she ended her days "a raving maniac."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=O'Dwyer|first1=George Francis|title=Historical Records and Studies|date=1921|publisher=United States Catholic Historical Society|location=New York|page=77|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PcI8AAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover|accessdate=15 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was likely the same “Mary Glover the Irish Catholic Witch” who was imprisoned in Boston alongside convicted pirates [[Thomas Hawkins (pirate)|Thomas Hawkins]], [[Thomas Pound]], and [[William Coward (pirate)|William Coward]] (whose trial shared some of the same judges as Ann Glover's, and who were also ministered to by Cotton Mather) in late 1689.&lt;ref name="Records of the Court of Assistants"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Assistants|first1=Massachusetts Court of|title=Records of the Court of Assistants of the Colony of the Massachusetts Bay, 1630-1692 ...|date=1901|publisher=county of Suffolk|location=Boston MA|pages=319–321|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c70VAQAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=14 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Three hundred years later in 1988, the Boston City Council proclaimed November 16 as ''Goody Glover Day''. She is the only victim of the witchcraft hysteria in the Massachusetts Bay Colony to receive such a tribute. Glover's accusations and death occurred before the better known Salem Witch Trials in Massachusetts and her trial would become the basis for many of the cases in the 1692 [[Salem witch trials]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wildeyedsoutherncelt.com/tag/goodwife-glover/|title=Goodwife Glover Archives - Wild Eyed Southern Celt|website=Wild Eyed Southern Celt|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has sometimes been asserted that Glover was an Irish slave (see [[Irish slaves myth]]). However, after reviewing the evidence, Liam Hogan has stated that 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
while this “Irish slave” narrative has been presented to thousands of contemporary readers as historical fact, it was only added to Glover’s story centuries after her death, first as speculation and later as absolute certainty. My research also shows that the tendency towards certainty around the “slavery” aspect of the narrative is apocryphal and primarily based on a pseudo-historical article written by Harold Dijon for ''The Ave Maria'' Catholic magazine in 1905. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

while contemporary accounts of her trial and death 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
not only upends the “slavery” assertion, but they also clearly show that Glover was scapegoated and murdered by Puritans on a charge of witchcraft because they fanatically believed that she was a witch in league with the devil and not because she was (a) Irish (b) a Catholic or (c) an Irish speaker.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4263">'''Assaulting a constable in the execution of his duty''' is a statutory offence of aggravated [[assault]] in [[England and Wales]], [[Scotland]], [[Northern Ireland]], and  [[Hong Kong]].

==England and Wales==
Section 89(1) of the [[Police Act 1996]] provides:

{{Blockquote|Any person who assaults a constable in the execution of his duty, or a person assisting a constable in the execution of his duty, shall be guilty of an offence and liable on [[summary conviction]] to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or to a fine not exceeding level 5 on the [[standard scale]], or to both.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/16/section/89 Digitised copy of s 89] from Legislation.gov.uk.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It is a [[summary offence]]. The "starting sentence" is a short custodial sentence, and it is considered a more serious offence than common assault.

The constable must be acting "in the execution of his duty" for this offence to be made out. If he exceeds the remit of his duty (e.g. acts unlawfully in assaulting the Defendant), the offence will not be made out.

The Defendant does not actually have to be aware that the person he is assaulting is a constable.&lt;ref&gt;''R v Forbes'' (1865) 10 [[Cox's Criminal Cases|Cox CC]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=lGY0AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA362#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 362]&lt;/ref&gt;

The fact that the victim is a police officer is not, in itself, an aggravating factor which would justify more serious charge. The criteria for a charge under section 47 of the [[Offences Against the Person Act 1861]] do not distinguish between members of the public and police officers as the victim.

According to ''R (Fullard) v Woking Magistrates' Court'' (2005) EWHC 2922 (Admin) a constable cannot be acting in the execution of their duty when unlawfully on private property. Thus, if the officer is not acting under the authority of a warrant, acting under a statutory or common law power of entry, or in hot pursuit, the person lawfully in possession of land is entitled to withdraw permission for the officer to remain. Should the officer refuse to leave, the officer will cease to be "acting in the execution of their duty". To make an effective withdrawal of permission, clear words must be used. Merely directing offensive remarks at the officer which amount to 'go away' will not necessarily withdraw any implied permission to enter or remain. Further, when properly required to leave, the officer must be allowed a reasonable opportunity to leave. However, once the opportunity to leave voluntarily has passed, it will not be an assault for the land owner to use reasonable force to cause the officer to leave.

For the purposes of section 89 of the Police Act 1996, any person who is carrying out surveillance in England and Wales under section 76A of the [[Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000]] is to be treated as if he were acting as a constable in the execution of his duty.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Crime (International Co-operation) Act 2003]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/32/section/84 section 84(1)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scotland==
Section 90 of the [[Police and Fire Reform (Scotland) Act 2012]] provides that it is an offence for a person to, amongst other things, assault a constable in the execution of his duty or a person assisting a constable in the execution of his duty.

==Northern Ireland==
Section 66(1) of the [[Police (Northern Ireland) Act 1998]] (c.32) now provides that it is an offence for a person to, amongst other things, assault a constable in the execution of his duty, or a person assisting a constable in the execution of his duty.

;History

The offence of 'assault on a constable in the execution of his duty' was formerly created section 7(1)(a) of the [[Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act (Northern Ireland) 1968]].
== Hong Kong ==
In Hong Kong this can be a [[summary offence]], and also prosecutable under the [[Police Act|Police Force Act]] or the [[Offences Against the Person Act]]. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/212/s36.html http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/232/s63.html http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/228/s23.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Athanasiy Velyki''', O.S.B.M. ({{lang-uk|Атанасій Григорій Великий}}; November 5, 1918 – December 24, 1982) was a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] [[Order of Saint Basil the Great|Basilian]] [[priest]], [[historian]], member of the [[Shevchenko Scientific Society]] from 1953.

== Biography ==
Athanasiy Velyki, O.S.B.M., was born on November 5, 1918 in [[Turynka]], Zhovkva county, Galicia. He joined the [[Order of Saint Basil the Great|Basilian monastic order]] on August 31, 1933. He studied philosophy and theology in [[Chervonohrad|Krystynopil]] (1938–40) and at the [[Ukrainian Free University]] in [[Prague]] (PH D, 1944) and the [[Pontifical Gregorian University|Gregorian University]] in Rome (TH D, 1948). He also studied the history of the Eastern church at the [[Pontifical Oriental Institute]] (1946–8) and [[palaeography]] at the Vatican.

He was ordained on December 8, 1946. He was vice-rector (1948–53 and 1955–60) and prorector (1961–3) of [[Ukrainian Pontifical College of Saint Josaphat|Saint Josaphat's Ukrainian Pontifical College]] in Rome. From 1960 to 1965 Velyki served as president of the Ukrainian Theological Scholarly Society and secretary of the Vatican's Preconciliar and Conciliar Commission on the Eastern Churches. Thanks to his efforts the commission adopted a resolution on the need for establishing a Kyiv patriarchate. He was superior general (1963–76) and then consultant general of the Basilian monastic order. He was also a consultant to the [[Congregation for the Oriental Churches]] and the Commission for the Revision of the Canon Law of the Roman and Eastern Churches. He headed the Bible Commission of the Basilian monastic order that prepared the first Ukrainian translation of the Bible from the original languages.

==Writings==
In 1949 Velyki revived and expanded ''Analecta Ordinis S. Basilii Magni''. He published a number of important documentary collections: 
* ''Actae S. Congregationis de Propaganda Fide'', 1622–1862 (5 vols, 1953–5), 
* ''Documenta Pontificum Romanorum Historiam Ucrainae Illustrantia'', 1075–1953 (2 vols, 1953–4), 
* ''Litterae S. Congregationis de Propaganda Fide'', 1622–1862 (7 vols, 1954–7), 
* ''Epistolae Metropolitarum Kioviensium Catholicorum'', 1613–1839 (9 vols, 1956–80), 
* ''Litterae Nuntiorum Apostolicorum'', 1550–1900 (14 vols, 1959–77), 
* ''Documenta Unionis Berestensis eiusque Auctorum'', 1590–1600 (1970), 
* ''Litterae Episcoporum'', 1600–1900 (5 vols, 1972–81),
* ''Litterae Basilianorum'', 1601–1760 (2 vols, 1979).

He established the series ''Ukrainska dukhovna biblioteka'' (The Ukrainian Spiritual Library), which published over 70 titles, 17 of which he wrote. His book on religious persecution in Ukraine, ''Bila knyha'' (The White Book, 1952), was translated into German, English, and Spanish. He also wrote a history of the Sisters Servants of Mary Immaculate (1968), ''Svitla i tini'' (Lights and Shadows, 1969), ''Ukraïns'ke khrystyianstvo'' (Ukrainian Christianity, 1969), and ''Z litopysu khrystyians'koï Ukraïny'' (From the Chronicle of Christian Ukraine, 9 vols, 1968–77). He contributed many entries to ''Entsyklopediia ukraïnoznavstva'' and ''[[Encyclopedia of Ukraine]]'' and drafted the missive from the Ukrainian Catholic church hierarchy on the anniversary of [[Olga of Kiev|Saint Olha]] and the official statement issued by the Ukrainian bishops regarding the release from Siberia of Metropolitan [[Josyf Slipyj]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9171">The “'''Body''' '''in the Cylinder”''' refers to a male decedent discovered within a partially sealed steel cylinder on a derelict [[World War II|WWII]] bomb site in [[Liverpool]], [[England]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The discovery was made in 1945 and it is believed that the body had lain undiscovered for 60 years. Inquiries named a strong (but unconfirmed) candidate for the identity of the decedent; however, the cause of death and the reason for their presence in the cylinder remain a mystery.

==Discovery of the cylinder==

In the summer of 1943 American soldiers were clearing a blitzed site at the back of the [[Methodist Church]] on Boundary Street East in Liverpool. An American [[bulldozer]] uncovered the cylinder while it was clearing building debris. One end of the cylinder was capped with a steel plate and the other was open. The bulldozer moved the cylinder and during the operation it unintentionally crushed the open end. Building contractors then extracted the cylinder from the building rubble and laid it level.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Skeleton riddle stays unsolved|last=|first=|date=31 August 1945|work=Evening Express|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the summer of 1943 the cylinder went largely unnoticed. A local witness, Norman Garner of 278 Great Homer Street, stated that he had seen people use the cylinder as a seat and children often played with it.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Body in Cylinder mystery|last=|first=|date=13 July 1945|work=Evening Express|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; About two weeks prior to the discovery of the body witnesses saw children rolling the cylinder across from some waste land in Great Homer Street to Claudia Street.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Description of the cylinder ===
The cylinder had a length of {{convert|6|ft|9|in|m|sigfig=2}} a diameter of {{convert|19|in|mm|sigfig=2}} and was made of gauge 9 steel which has a thickness of {{convert|0.156|in|mm|sigfig=1}}.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Skeleton riddle may date to 1885|last=|first=|date=19 July 1945|work=Evening Express|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The metal cap to the closed end of the cylinder was bolted in place.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The open end of the cylinder had been compressed, and almost crimped shut, by the bulldozer&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; leaving an aperture of about {{convert|4|in|mm|sigfig=2}}.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; No traces of paint were found inside the cylinder and the opinion in 1945 was that it had been part of a ventilation shaft.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Discovery of the body ==
On 13 July 1945 three small boys were playing with the cylinder. They were rolling it through the streets when one tried to see what was inside.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; At first they saw what appeared to be a shoe, however, on closer inspection it appeared to be part of an human skeleton.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The police were called to the scene and they used an [[Oxy-fuel welding and cutting|Oxy acetylene]] burner to cut the cylinder open.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The contents were revealed to be a complete human skeleton accompanied by a number of items. The police removed the remains and took them to the mortuary.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Description of the victim ==
The remains were found to be those of an adult male who would have been about {{convert|6|ft|m|sigfig=2}} tall in life. It was thought, in 1945, that the man was aged between 25 and 50 at the time of his death.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The body appeared to have been [[in situ]] for a long time.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  

The left base of the skeletons skull was missing.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The [[cranium]] was broken near to the left middle-ear but this did not appear to be due to violence.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The head and torso had become detached at some point through movement.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A small amount of hair was found still adhered to the skull.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

It appeared that the man had crawled into the cylinder.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The position of the skeleton suggested that the man was lying down and using a brick wrapped in sacking as a pillow when he died.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Skeleton in Cylinder|last=|first=|date=20 August 1944|work=Liverpool Daily Post|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The body was found fully clothed and lying full length&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; on some sacking but not within it.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; He was dressed in clothes typical of the later [[Victorian era|Victorian]] period and they appeared to be of good quality.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Items found with body ===
Numerous items were found with the body.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These items included two diaries, seven keys (heavily corroded), and some miscellaneous papers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  No money or other valuables were found in the decedents pockets.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The list of items found in the cylinder, as reported in 1945, is as follows:
{{bulleted list |Two diaries dated 1884 and 1885.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The diaries were largely illegible to the coroner in 1945 but one diary entry dated June 1885 noted an ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'appointment for 1 pm with F C Gredy at Cons'''.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;|A [[postcard]] (decayed but reconstructed by coroner), postmarked Birmingham, date stamped July 3rd 1885.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The postcard was addressed to T C Williams from Mr A E Harris.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;|A [[handkerchief]], however, there was nothing identifiable on it.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;|A [[brooch]] in the cylinder.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;|A gold [[signet ring]] of a green stone flecked with red.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The signet ring was very much worn and carried the hallmark 'London 1859'.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;|A [[London and North Western Railway|London North Western Railway]] advice note dated 27 June 1885.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;|Five account sheets, (four unused) from T C Williams and Co.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;|A [[billhead]] receipt from T C Williams and Co, Leeds St, Liverpool.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;}}

== Investigation ==

The inquest was opened on 19 July 1945 and adjourned for a month by the Liverpool [[Coroner]] Mr G C Mort.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

There was no evidence that the man had been killed in the [[Blitzkrieg|blitz]] as had been suspected initially.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The [[pathologist]] noted a large amount of moisture in the cylinder which indicated three possible scenarios. 1. The victim could had been in the unsealed cylinder for about 10 years. 2. The cylinder could have been sealed airtight.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 3. There could have been moisture ingress and it had not dried out. The last two scenarios indicated that it was possible that the body had been in the cylinder since 1885 or 1890.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Conditions in the cylinder indicated that the body had undergone normal [[decomposition]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

On 31 August 1945 the coroner closed the inquest by recording an [[open verdict]] stating that it was impossible to establish cause of death due to insufficient information.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The date of death was believed to have been 1885.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Thomas Creegan Williams==
In August 1945 the inquest named T C Williams, a paint and brush manufacturer of 5 Leeds Street, Liverpool, as a potential identity for the decedent.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; T C Williams and Co. were a paint, varnish and colour merchants in Tithebarn Street&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; with works in Smithfield Street around 1885.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Thomas Cregeen Williams, lived at 29 Cambridge Road in [[Seaforth, Merseyside|Seaforth]], then Woodville House, Abbotsford Road in  [[Blundellsands]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=The Bankruptcy Act, 1869|last=|first=|date=14 March 1884|work=The London Gazette|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Williams was declared [[Bankruptcy|bankrupt]] on 10 March 1884.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The inquest hypothesised that Williams had left his family home due to financial difficulties and was sleeping in the cylinder at what were assumed to be his business premisses. Somehow the cylinder became sealed and he [[Asphyxia|asphyxiated]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It was thought that his disappearance may been interpreted in 1885 as deliberate absconding in order to avoid his creditors as working ones passage on ship to another country was not an unknown method of escaping debt at the time.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

According to records obtained by the inquiry Williams’s wife was buried alone in Liverpool but no records of the death of Williams or his burial in Liverpool could be found.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Indeed, there were no records in England and Wales of a T C Williams being buried.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; T C Williams had one son born 1859.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The inquiry sought relatives of Williams but had no success at the time.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3278">'''Camille Archibald Baquet''' (1842 &amp;ndash; November 28, 1924) was an [[American Civil War]] [[Union Army]] officer who served in the [[1st New Jersey Volunteer Infantry]] [[regiment]] and was the author of the first history of the unit's [[brigade]], the famed [[First New Jersey Brigade]].

==Biography==
Baquet was born in [[Paterson, New Jersey]], one of eight children born to Camille Baquet (or Baquett), a law professor and translator from Paris,&lt;ref&gt;''New York, Marriage Newspaper Extracts, 1801-1880 (Barber Collection)''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Erasmus Peshine|title=Manuel d'économie politique|date=1854|publisher=Guillaumin|page=11|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4j1HAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PP11|accessdate=17 July 2017|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Harriet Stuart Lord, the daughter of English immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;''New Jersey, Deaths and Burials Index, 1798-1971''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''1860 United States Census''&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in [[Burlington, New Jersey]]. He was mustered in as a private in Company I, [[16th Pennsylvania Cavalry|16th Pennsylvania Volunteer Cavalry]] on September 13, 1862. He served with the Pennsylvanians until April 1, 1863, when he was commissioned as a [[Second Lieutenant#United States|second lieutenant]] in Company A, [[1st New Jersey Volunteer Infantry]], filling an officer vacancy within the Company that had existed for over a month. He then served until June 23, 1864, when his enlistment expired by law, and he was honorably mustered out of Federal service. During his 14-month tenure with the 1st New Jersey, his regiment saw combat at the Battles of [[Battle of Chancellorsville|Chancellorsville]], [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]], the [[Battle of the Wilderness|Wilderness]], [[Battle of Spotsylvania Court House|Spotsylvania]], and [[Battle of Cold Harbor|Cold Harbor]].

He later worked as a bookkeeper.&lt;ref&gt;''1920 United States Census''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1910, he published the work ''History of the First Brigade, New Jersey Volunteers (Kearny's First New Jersey Brigade) from 1861 to 1865'', which chronicled the military history of his brigade. Until the year 2005, it was the only full-length work on that famed [[VI Corps (Union Army)|VI Corps]] unit.

He died in [[New Brunswick, New Jersey]] and was buried in the Saint Peter's Church Cemetery in [[Spotswood, New Jersey]].

A '''caul''' or '''cowl''' ({{lang-la|Caput galeatum}}, literally, "helmeted head") is a piece of [[biological membrane|membrane]] that can cover a newborn's head and face.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/caul caul]. Thefreedictionary.com. Retrieved on 2011-10-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Birth with a caul is rare, occurring in fewer than 1 in 80,000 births.{{Citation needed|reason=the statistic needs a good source|date=December 2017}} The caul is harmless and is immediately removed by the physician or [[midwife]] upon delivery of the child.

The "en-caul" birth, not to be confused with the "caul" birth, occurs when the infant is born inside the entire [[amniotic sac]].  The sac balloons out at birth, with the amniotic fluid and child remaining inside the unbroken or partially broken membrane.

==Types==
A child "born with the caul" has a portion of a birth membrane remaining on the head. There are two types of caul membranes, and there are four ways such cauls can appear.

The most common caul type is a piece of the thin, translucent inner lining of the [[amnion]] which breaks away and forms tightly against the head during the birthing process.&lt;ref name="Earliest"&gt;http://caulbearersunited.webs.com/-%20New%20Folder/EarliestCaulBearer.pdf{{full citation needed|date=February 2015}}{{self-published inline|date=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such a caul typically clings to the head and face, but on rarer occasions drapes over the head and partly down the torso.  In Germany, this would be called a "helmet" (''{{lang|de|Galea}}'') for boys; in the Netherlands it is also called a "helmet", both for boys and girls (''{{lang|nl|Helm}}'') and in Italy a "fillet" (''{{lang|it|vitta}}'') or "shirt" (''{{lang|it|camicia}}'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caulbearersunited.webs.com/whatisacaulbearer.htm What is a Caulbearer?]&lt;/ref&gt; In Poland, it is called a "bonnet" (''{{lang|pl|czepek}}''), for both sexes.

==Removal==
The caul is harmless and is immediately removed by the [[physician]] or [[midwife]] upon delivery of the child. If the membrane is of the amniotic tissue, it is removed by easily slipping it away from the child's skin. The removal of the thicker membrane is more complex. If done correctly, the attending practitioner will place a small incision in the membrane across the nostrils so that the child can breathe.  The loops are then carefully un-looped from behind the ears.  Then, the remainder of the caul can be either peeled back very carefully from the skin, or gently rubbed with a sheet of paper, which is then peeled away.  If removed too quickly, the caul can leave wounds on the infant's flesh at the attachment points, which may leave permanent scars.&lt;ref name="Earliest"/&gt;

==Epidemiology==
Birth with a caul is rare, occurring in fewer than 1 in 80,000 births. This statistic includes caul births, which occur more frequently than authentic en-caul births; therefore authentic en-caul births are rarer than the statistic indicates.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080521142203/http://healthlink.mcw.edu/article/901311432.html Caul, or Face Veil, Occasionally Present at Birth].

Retrieved 22 August 2015{{Failed verification|date=December 2017}}{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most "en-caul" births are premature.

==History==
According to [[Aelius Lampridius]], the boy-emperor [[Diadumenian]] (208–218) was so named because he was born with a [[diadem]] formed by a rolled caul.&lt;ref&gt;[http://caulbearersunited.webs.com/208ADReference.pdf PDF file]. caulbearersunited.webs.com{{full citation needed|date=February 2015}}{{self-published inline|date=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In medieval times the appearance of a caul on a newborn baby was seen as a sign of good luck.&lt;ref&gt;Vikki Campion. (2008-12-31) [http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,24857363-5001021,00.html Dolores Pancaldi's birth in protective membrane]. The Daily Telegraph via News.com.au. Retrieved on 2011-10-15.&lt;/ref&gt; It was considered an [[omen]] that the child was destined for greatness.  Gathering the caul onto paper was considered an important tradition of childbirth: the midwife would rub a sheet of paper across the baby's head and face, pressing the material of the caul onto the paper.  The caul would then be presented to the mother, to be kept as an [[heirloom]]. Some Early Modern European traditions linked caul birth to the ability to defend fertility and the harvest against the forces of evil, particularly witches and sorcerers.&lt;ref&gt;The story of these so-called [[benandanti]] is recounted in [[Carlo Ginzburg]]'s study ''The Night Battles: Witchcraft and Agrarian Cults in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries'', Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

Folklore developed suggesting that possession of a baby's caul would give its bearer good luck and protect that person from death by drowning. Cauls were therefore highly prized by [[sailor]]s. Medieval women often sold these cauls to sailors for large sums of money; a caul was regarded as a valuable [[Amulet|talisman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Oliver|first=Harry|title=Black Cats &amp; Four-Leaf Clovers|year=2006|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-399-53609-0|chapter=12}}{{page needed|date=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Polish language, the idiom ''{{lang|pl|w czepku urodzony/a}}'' ('born in a bonnet'), and, in Italian, ''{{lang|it|nato/a con la camicia/a}}'' ('born with a shirt'), they both mean a person who is always very lucky.

The Russian phrase {{lang|ru|родился в рубашке}} (''rodilsya v rubashke'', literally, "born in a shirt") refers to caul birth and figuratively means "born lucky". It is often applied to someone who is oblivious to a pending disaster that is avoided only through luck as if the birth caul persists as supernatural armor, and in this sense commonly appears in titles or descriptions of Russian [[dashcam]] videos.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Not all cultural beliefs about cauls are positive.  In [[Folklore of Romania|Romanian folklore]], babies born with a caul are said to become [[vampire]]s upon death.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

==In literature==
[[Charles Dickens]], ''[[David Copperfield]]'', published London 1850:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I was born with a caul, which was advertised for sale, in the newspapers, at the low price of fifteen [[Guinea (British coin)|guinea]]s. Whether sea-going people were short of money about that time, or were short of faith and preferred [[cork jacket]]s, I don't know; all I know is, that there was but one solitary bidding, and that was from an attorney connected with the bill-broking business, who offered two [[Pound (currency)|pound]]s in cash, and the balance in [[sherry]], but declined to be guaranteed from drowning on any higher bargain. Consequently the advertisement was withdrawn at a dead loss ... and ten years afterwards, the caul was put up in a [[raffle]] down in our part of the country, to fifty members at half-a-[[Crown (British coin)|crown]] a head, the winner to spend five [[Shilling (British coin)|shilling]]s. I was present myself, and I remember to have felt quite uncomfortable and confused, at a part of myself being disposed of in that way. The caul was won, I recollect, by an old lady with a hand-basket.... It is a fact which will be long remembered as remarkable down there, that she was never drowned, but died triumphantly in bed, at ninety-two. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''[[The Legend of Thyl Ulenspiegel and Lamme Goedzak]]'' by [[Charles De Coster]] (published 1867), Thyl was born with a caul.

In Betty Smith's novel ''[[A Tree Grows in Brooklyn (novel)|A Tree Grows in Brooklyn]]'', Francie Nolan is born with a caul. The midwife who officiated the birth stole the caul and later sold it for $2 to a sailor from the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]]. It was believed that whoever wore a caul could not drown.

A prophecy given to an infant born with the caul is the basis of the [[Brothers Grimm|Grimm]] fairy tale ''[[The Devil with the Three Golden Hairs]]''.

In ''[[The Shipping News]]'', the Pulitzer Prize winning book by Annie Proulx, Quoyle's friend Partridge had been born with a caul and "was sure of his own good fortune."

In the film ''[[Oscar and Lucinda]]'', Oscar's father gives him the caul that was upon his head at birth.  Oscar has a phobia of the ocean and of water in general, linked to the death of his mother when he was a child.  He carries this caul with him until he dies by drowning.

In the play ''[[Gypsy: A Musical Fable]]'', Mama Rose tells Louise ([[Gypsy Rose Lee]]): "You were born with a caul. That means you got powers to read palms and tell fortunes – and wonderful things are gonna happen to you."

In the sequel ''[[Doctor Sleep (novel)|Doctor Sleep]]'', the character Abra is also born with a caul and has paranormal abilities.

In [[Majgull Axelsson]]'s ''April Witch'', both of the central characters Hubertsson and Desirée are "born to the caul".

In [[Guillermo del Toro]]'s and [[Chuck Hogan]]'s ''The Fall'', the second installment of ''[[The Strain]]'' trilogy, Dr. Ephraim Goodweather's son, Zack, is described as being "born in the caul".

In [[Ami McKay]]'s ''The Birth House'', the main character, Dora Rare, is born with a caul over her eyes.  Because the character is born in a sailing town, the caul is considered valuable, and the mother gives it to the [[midwifery|midwife]] for safe keeping.  When the caul is presented to Dora as an adult, she does not allow her husband to take it and he drowns that very night.

[[Dean Koontz]] talks about cauls in his novel ''Whispers''. Twins were born, both with a caul. "She was fascinated. You know, some people think that a child born with a caul has the gift of second sight."  However, the mother believes it's the mark of a demon.

Tina McElroy Ansa's novel ''Baby of the Family'' features a lead character born with the caul and her struggles to deal with the ability to see spirits due to her family's inability to believe in the phenomenon and properly prepare her to deal with her gift.

In [[Orson Scott Card]]'s novel ''[[Seventh Son (novel)|Seventh Son]]'', the first part of the series ''[[The Tales of Alvin Maker]]'', Alvin Miller (the [[seventh son of a seventh son]]) is born with a caul, a sign of his extraordinarily strong magical gifts.

In [[Ole Edvart Rølvaag]]'s ''[[Giants in the Earth (novel)|Giants in the Earth]]'', Beret and Per Hansa's son, Peder Seier (or Peder Victorious), is born with the caul. Per Hansa was a fisherman in Norway before coming to the plains of South Dakota, and the symbolism of the caul is important to these particular immigrants. In an attempt to stay true to the original Norwegian text, the translation refers to the caul as "the helmet."

In Brian McGreevy's [[Hemlock Grove]], Roman and Shelley Godfrey are both born with a caul, indicating their "supernatural" nature to their mother.

In [[Guy Gavriel Kay]]'s historical fantasy novel ''[[Tigana]]'', those born with the caul are marked as Night Walkers, men and women capable of entering a dream world to fight an unknown struggle for the land known as the Ember War. Possibly based on a 16th-century Italian fertility cult, the [[Benandanti]].

In [[Deborah Harkness]]' historical fiction novel ''[[A Discovery of Witches (book series)|A Discovery of Witches]]'', Diana Bishop is born with a caul. Her parents believe that is a sign that Diana's destiny is to "remain between worlds."

In Truman Capote's ''[[Jug of Silver]]'', Appleseed, a main character who correctly guesses the amount of change in a jar, is said to have been born with a caul on his head.

In the strange underground work (a mix of avant-garde black militancy and pornography) by [[Steven Cannon]], ''[[Groove, Bang and Jive Around]]'' (1969, rptd. Therion,1998), protagonist Annette "was born with a caul over her face" (p. 111). Though it remains open to interpretation in the story, there is a suggestion that this birth may have ties to her privileged status in a New Orleans voodoo lineage (she's a blood relation of Doctor John and Marie Laveau): "...you were born with a caul over your face. But lots of 'um is born that way, don't make 'um any better than the rest. But you been blessed. I saw to that myself... Blessed you are with the power to see behind the mask, the invisibles, into the future..." (215).

In Amazon's Sneaky Pete Season 2 Episode 3 at about 30:00  the true Pete tells Marjorie in the bar that his mother was "born with a caul," implying that she had she had psychic abilities  "She knew what I was going to do before I did. ...  It was spooky how much she knew."

A '''complex quadratic polynomial''' is a [[quadratic polynomial]] whose [[coefficient]]s and variable are [[complex number]]s.

==Forms==
When the quadratic polynomial has only one variable ([[univariate]]),  one can distinguish its four main forms:
* The general form:  &lt;math&gt; f(x) =  a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0 \qquad \, &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; \qquad a_2  \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;
* The factored form used for [[logistic map]] &lt;math&gt;f_r(x) = r x ( 1-x ) \,&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; f_{\theta}(x) = x^2 +\lambda x  \,&lt;/math&gt;  which has  an indifferent [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]] with [[Periodic points of complex quadratic mappings#Stability of periodic points .28orbit.29 - multiplier|multiplier]] &lt;math&gt;\lambda = e^{2 \pi \theta i} \,&lt;/math&gt; at the [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/jams/2001-14-01/S0894-0347-00-00348-9/S0894-0347-00-00348-9.pdf Michael Yampolsky, Saeed Zakeri : Mating Siegel quadratic polynomials. ]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The monic and centered form, &lt;math&gt;f_c(x) = x^2 +c\,&lt;/math&gt;

The '''[[Monic polynomial|monic]] and centered  form''' has the following properties:

* It is the simplest form of a [[Nonlinearity (disambiguation)|nonlinear]] [[Function (mathematics)|function]] with one [[coefficient]] ([[parameter]]),
* It is [[Polynomial#Definition|an unicritical polynomial]], i.e. it has one [[Critical point (mathematics)|critical point]],
* It is a centered polynomial (the sum of its critical points is zero),&lt;ref&gt;[[Bodil Branner]]: Holomorphic dynamical systems in the complex plane. Mat-Report No 1996-42. Technical University of Denmark&lt;/ref&gt;
* It can be '''postcritically finite''', i.e. the orbit of the critical point can be finite, because the critical point is periodic or preperiodic.&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/math/9305207 Alfredo Poirier : On Post Critically Finite Polynomials Part One: Critical Portraits ]&lt;/ref&gt;
* It is a [[unimodal]] [[Function (mathematics)|function]],
* It is a [[rational function]],
* It is an [[entire function]].

The lambda form &lt;math&gt; f_{\lambda}(z) = z^2 +\lambda z  \,&lt;/math&gt; is:
* the simplest non-trival perturbation of unperturbated system &lt;math&gt; z \mapsto \lambda z&lt;/math&gt;
* "the first family of dynamical systems in which explicit necessary and sufficient conditions are known for when a small divisor problem is stable"&lt;ref&gt;Dynamical Systems and Small Divisors, Editors: Stefano Marmi, Jean-Christophe Yoccoz, page 46 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Conjugation==

===Between forms===
Since &lt;math&gt;f_c(x) \,&lt;/math&gt; is [[Affine transformation|affine]] [[Topological conjugation|conjugate]] to the general form of the quadratic polynomial it is often used to study [[complex dynamics]] and to create images of [[Mandelbrot set|Mandelbrot]], [[Julia set|Julia]] and [[Fatou set]]s.

When one wants change from &lt;math&gt;\theta\,&lt;/math&gt;  to &lt;math&gt;c \,&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/jams/2001-14-01/S0894-0347-00-00348-9/S0894-0347-00-00348-9.pdf Michael Yampolsky, Saeed Zakeri : Mating Siegel quadratic polynomials. ]&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;c = c(\theta) = \frac {e^{2 \pi \theta i}}{2} \left(1 - \frac {e^{2 \pi \theta i}}{2}\right). &lt;/math&gt;

When one wants change from &lt;math&gt;r\,&lt;/math&gt;  to &lt;math&gt;c , \,&lt;/math&gt; the parameter transformation is&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/290564/show-that-the-familiar-logistic-map-x-n1-sx-n1-x-n-can-be-recoded-in stackexchange questions : Show that the familiar logistic map ...]&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
c = c(r)\,=\,\frac{1- (r-1)^2}{4}=-\frac{r}{2}\left(\frac{r-2}{2}\right)
&lt;/math&gt; 

and the transformation between the variables in &lt;math&gt;z_{t+1}=z_t^2+c&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_{t+1}=rx_t(1-x_t)&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;z=r\left(\frac{1}{2}-x\right).&lt;/math&gt;

===With doubling map===
There is semi-conjugacy between the [[dyadic transformation]] (the doubling map) and the quadratic polynomial case of ''c'' = –2.

==Map==
The monic and centered form, sometimes called the '''Douady-Hubbard family of quadratic polynomials''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://qcpages.qc.cuny.edu/~yjiang/HomePageYJ/Download/2004MandLocConn.pdf Yunping Jing : Local connectivity of the Mandelbrot set at certain infinitely renormalizable points ] Complex Dynamics and Related Topics, New Studies in Advanced Mathematics, 2004, The International Press, 236-264&lt;/ref&gt;  is typically used with  [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]]  &lt;math&gt;z\,&lt;/math&gt; and [[parameter]] &lt;math&gt;c\,&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;f_c(z) = z^2 +c.\,&lt;/math&gt;

When it is used as an  [[Dynamical system (definition)|evolution function]] of [[Dynamical system|the discrete nonlinear dynamical system]]

: &lt;math&gt;z_{n+1} = f_c(z_n)  \,&lt;/math&gt;

it is named the '''[[Quadratic polynomial|quadratic]] [[Map (mathematics)|map]]''':&lt;ref&gt;[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/QuadraticMap.html Weisstein, Eric W. "Quadratic Map." From MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource]&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;f_c : z \to z^2 + c. \,&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Mandelbrot set]] is the set of values of the parameter ''c'' for which the initial condition ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 does not cause the iterates to diverge to infinity.

==Notation==
Here &lt;math&gt; f^n \,&lt;/math&gt; denotes the ''n''-th [[iterated function|iteration]] of the function &lt;math&gt; f \,&lt;/math&gt; (and not [[exponentiation]] of the function):

:&lt;math&gt;f_c^n(z) = f_c^1(f_c^{n-1}(z)) \,&lt;/math&gt;

so

:&lt;math&gt;z_n = f_c^n(z_0). \,&lt;/math&gt;

Because of the possible confusion with exponentiation, some authors write  &lt;math&gt;f^{\circ n}\,&lt;/math&gt;  for the ''n''th iterate  of the function &lt;math&gt;f.\,&lt;/math&gt;

==Critical items==

===Critical point===
A '''[[Critical point (mathematics)|critical point]]''' of &lt;math&gt;f_c\,&lt;/math&gt; is a point &lt;math&gt; z_{cr} \,&lt;/math&gt; in the dynamical plane such that the [[derivative]] vanishes:

: &lt;math&gt;f_c'(z_{cr}) = 0. \,&lt;/math&gt;

Since

: &lt;math&gt;f_c'(z) = \frac{d}{dz}f_c(z) = 2z &lt;/math&gt;

implies

: &lt;math&gt; z_{cr} = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;

we see that the only (finite) critical point of &lt;math&gt;f_c \,&lt;/math&gt; is the point &lt;math&gt; z_{cr} = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt; is an initial point for [[Mandelbrot set]] iteration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mathesim.degruyter.de/jws_en/show_simulation.php?id=1052&amp;type=RoessMa&amp;lang=en Java program by Dieter Röß showing result of changing initial point of Mandelbrot iterations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426002245/http://mathesim.degruyter.de/jws_en/show_simulation.php?id=1052&amp;type=RoessMa&amp;lang=en |date=26 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical value===
A '''[[critical value]]''' &lt;math&gt;z_{cv} \ &lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;f_c\,&lt;/math&gt; is the image of a critical point:

: &lt;math&gt;z_{cv} =  f_c(z_{cr})   \,&lt;/math&gt;

Since

: &lt;math&gt; z_{cr} = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;

we have

: &lt;math&gt;z_{cv} =  c.   \,&lt;/math&gt;

So the parameter &lt;math&gt;  c   \,&lt;/math&gt; is the critical value of &lt;math&gt;f_c(z). \,&lt;/math&gt;

===Critical orbit===

The [[orbit (dynamics)|forward orbit]] of a critical point is called a '''critical orbit'''. Critical orbits are very important because every attracting [[Periodic points of complex quadratic mappings|periodic orbit]] attracts a critical point, so studying the critical orbits helps us understand the dynamics in the [[Fatou set]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iec.csic.es/~miguel/miguel.html M.

:&lt;math&gt;z_0 = z_{cr} = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;z_1 = f_c(z_0) = c\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;z_2 = f_c(z_1) = c^2 +c\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;z_3 = f_c(z_2) = (c^2 + c)^2 + c\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;... \,&lt;/math&gt;

This orbit falls into an [[Periodic points of complex quadratic mappings|attracting periodic cycle]] if one exists.
{{commons|Category:Critical orbits}}

===Critical sector===
The [[Orbit portrait#Sectors|critical sector]] is a sector of the dynamical plane containing the critical point.

===Critical polynomial===
:&lt;math&gt;P_n(c) = f_c^n(z_{cr}) = f_c^n(0) \,&lt;/math&gt;

so

:&lt;math&gt;P_0(c)= 0 \,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;P_1(c) = c \,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;P_2(c) = c^2 + c \,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;P_3(c) = (c^2 + c)^2 + c \,&lt;/math&gt;

These polynomials are used for:
* finding centers of  these Mandelbrot set components of period n. Centers are roots of n-th critical polynomials

:&lt;math&gt;centers = \{ c : P_n(c) = 0 \}\,&lt;/math&gt;

* finding roots of Mandelbrot set components of period n ([[local minimum]] of &lt;math&gt;P_n(c) \,&lt;/math&gt;)
* [[Misiurewicz point]]s

:&lt;math&gt;M_{n,k} = \{ c : P_k(c) = P_{k+n}(c) \}\,&lt;/math&gt;

===Critical curves===
Diagrams of critical polynomials are called '''critical curves'''.&lt;ref&gt;The Road to Chaos is Filled with Polynomial Curves
by Richard D. Neidinger and R. John Annen III. American Mathematical Monthly, Vol. 103, No. 8, October 1996, pp. 640-653&lt;/ref&gt;

These curves create the skeleton (the dark lines) of a [[bifurcation diagram]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

==Planes==
[[File:Iray.png|right|thumb|w-plane and c-plane]]
One can use the Julia-Mandelbrot 4-dimensional space for a global analysis of this dynamical system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mrob.com/pub/muency/juliamandelbrotspace.html  Julia-Mandelbrot Space at Mu-ency by Robert Munafo ]&lt;/ref&gt;

In this space there are 2 basic types of 2-D planes:
* the dynamical (dynamic)  plane, &lt;math&gt;f_c\,&lt;/math&gt;-plane or  '''c-plane'''
* the parameter plane or '''z-plane'''

There is also another plane used to analyze such dynamical systems  '''w-plane''': 
* the conjugation plane&lt;ref&gt;Carleson, Lennart, Gamelin, Theodore W.: Complex Dynamics Series: Universitext, Subseries: Universitext: Tracts in Mathematics, 1st ed. 1993. Corr. 2nd printing, 1996, IX, 192 p. 28 illus., {{ISBN|978-0-387-97942-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* model plane&lt;ref&gt;Holomorphic motions and puzzels by P Roesch&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parameter plane===
[[File:MandelbrotLambda.jpg|right|thumb|Gamma parameter plane for complex logistic map &lt;math&gt;z_{n+1} = \gamma z_n \left(1 - z_n\right),&lt;/math&gt;]]
[[File:Mandelbrot set - multiplier map.png|thumb|right|Multiplier map]]
The [[phase space]] of a quadratic map is called its '''parameter plane'''. Here:

&lt;math&gt;z_0 = z_{cr} \,&lt;/math&gt; is [[Coefficient|constant]] and &lt;math&gt;c\,&lt;/math&gt; is variable.

There is no dynamics here. It is only a set of parameter values. There are no orbits on the parameter plane.

The parameter plane consists of:
* The [[Mandelbrot set]]
** The [[bifurcation locus]] = boundary of [[Mandelbrot set]] with 
*** root points
** Bounded hyperbolic components of the Mandelbrot set = interior of Mandelbrot set&lt;ref&gt;[http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/0805.1658 [[Lasse Rempe]], Dierk Schleicher : Bifurcation Loci of Exponential Maps and Quadratic Polynomials: Local Connectivity, Triviality of Fibers, and Density of Hyperbolicity]&lt;/ref&gt; with internal rays 
* exterior of Mandelbrot set with 
** [[External ray|external rays]] 
** equipotential lines 

There are many different subtypes of the parameter plane.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/julia/altplane.html Alternate Parameter Planes by David E. Joyce ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mrob.com/pub/muency/exponentialmap.html exponentialmap by Robert Munafo]&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[External_ray#Uniformization_2|Boettcher map]] which maps exterior of mandelbrot set to the exterior of unit disc
* multiplier map which maps interior of hyperbolic component of Mandelbrot set to the interior of unit disc

===Dynamical plane===
  "The polynomial Pc maps each dynamical ray to another ray doubling the angle (which we measure in full turns, i.e. 0 = 1 = 2π rad = 360◦), and the dynamical rays of any polynomial “look like straight rays” near infinity. This allows us to study the Mandelbrot and Julia sets combinatorially, replacing the dynamical plane by the unit circle, rays by angles, and the quadratic polynomial by the doubling modulo one map." Virpi K a u k o&lt;ref&gt;[http://matwbn.icm.edu.pl/ksiazki/fm/fm164/fm16413.pdf Trees of visible components in the Mandelbrot set by Virpi K a u k o , FUNDAM E N TA MATHEMATICAE 164 (2000)]&lt;/ref&gt;


On the dynamical plane one can find:
* The [[Julia set]]
* The [[Filled Julia set]]
* The [[Fatou set]]
* Orbits

The dynamical plane consists of:
* [[Fatou set]]
* [[Julia set]]

Here, &lt;math&gt;c\,&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Coefficient|constant]] and  &lt;math&gt;z\,&lt;/math&gt; is a variable.

The two-dimensional dynamical plane can be treated as a [[Poincaré map|Poincaré cross-section]] of three-dimensional space of continuous dynamical system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sgtnd.narod.ru/science/complex/eng/main.htm Mandelbrot set by Saratov group of theoretical nonlinear dynamics]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Periodic_orbit#Stability_of_a_Periodic_Orbit|Jeff Moehlis, Kresimir Josic, Eric T. Shea-Brown (2006) Periodic orbit. Scholarpedia,]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dynamical z-planes can be divided in two groups :
* &lt;math&gt;f_0&lt;/math&gt; plane for &lt;math&gt;c = 0&lt;/math&gt; ( see [[complex squaring map]] )
*  &lt;math&gt;f_c&lt;/math&gt; planes ( all other planes for &lt;math&gt;c \ne 0&lt;/math&gt; )

==Derivatives==

===First derivative with respect to ''c''===
On the parameter plane:
* &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is a variable
* &lt;math&gt;z_0 = 0 &lt;/math&gt; is constant

The first [[derivative]] of &lt;math&gt;f_c^n(z_0)&lt;/math&gt; with respect to ''c'' is

: &lt;math&gt;z_n' = \frac{d}{dc} f_c^n(z_0).&lt;/math&gt;

This [[derivative]] can be found by [[Iterated function|iteration]] starting with

: &lt;math&gt;z_0' = \frac{d}{dc} f_c^0(z_0) = 1&lt;/math&gt;

and then replacing at every consecutive step

: &lt;math&gt;z_{n+1}' = \frac{d}{dc} f_c^{n+1}(z_0) = 2\cdot{}f_c^n(z)\cdot\frac{d}{dc} f_c^n(z_0) + 1 = 2 \cdot z_n \cdot z_n' +1.&lt;/math&gt;

This can easily be verified by using the [[chain rule]] for the derivative.

This derivative is used in the [[Mandelbrot set#Distance estimates|distance estimation method for drawing a Mandelbrot set]].

===First derivative with respect to ''z''===
On the dynamical plane:
* &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; is a variable;
* &lt;math&gt;c &lt;/math&gt; is a constant.

At a '''fixed point''' &lt;math&gt;z_0\, ,&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;f_c'(z_0) = \frac{d}{dz}f_c(z_0) = 2z_0 .&lt;/math&gt;

At a''' [[Periodic points of complex quadratic mappings|periodic point]]''' ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; of period ''p'' the first derivative of a function 

: &lt;math&gt;(f_c^p)'(z_0) = \frac{d}{dz}f_c^p(z_0) =  \prod_{i=0}^{p-1} f_c'(z_i) = 2^p \prod_{i=0}^{p-1} z_i = \lambda &lt;/math&gt;

is often represented by &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; and referred to as the multiplier or the Lyapunov characteristic number. Its logarithm is known as the Lyapunov exponent. It used to check the [[Stability theory|stability]] of [[Periodic points of complex quadratic mappings|periodic (also fixed) points]].

At a '''nonperiodic point''', the derivative, denoted by &lt;math&gt;z'_n, \,&lt;/math&gt; can be found by [[Iterated function|iteration]] starting with

: &lt;math&gt;z'_0 = 1, \,&lt;/math&gt;

and then using

:&lt;math&gt;z'_n= 2*z_{n-1}*z'_{n-1}. \,&lt;/math&gt;

This derivative is used for computing the external distance to the Julia set.

===Schwarzian derivative===
The [[Schwarzian derivative]] (SD for short) of f is:&lt;ref&gt;[http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-091-mathematical-exposition-spring-2005/lecture-notes/lecture09.pdf The Schwarzian Derivative &amp; the Critical Orbit by Wes McKinney  18.091  20 April 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; (Sf)(z) = \frac{f'''(z)}{f'(z)} - \frac{3}{2} \left ( \frac{f''(z)}{f'(z)}\right ) ^2  &lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21591">'''Computational biology''' involves the development and application of data-analytical and theoretical methods, mathematical modeling and computational simulation techniques to the study of biological, ecological, behavioral, and social systems.&lt;ref name="nih" /&gt; The field is broadly defined and includes foundations in [[biology]], [[applied mathematics]], [[statistics]], [[biochemistry]], [[chemistry]], [[biophysics]], [[molecular biology]], [[genetics]], [[genomics]], [[computer science]] and [[evolution]].&lt;ref name="brown" /&gt;

Computational biology is different from [[biological computing]], which is a subfield of [[computer science]] and [[computer engineering]] using [[bioengineering]] and [[biology]] to build [[computer]]s, but is similar to [[bioinformatics]], which is an interdisciplinary science using computers to store and process biological data.

==Introduction==
Computational Biology, which includes many aspects of [[bioinformatics]], is the science of using biological data to develop [[algorithms]] or [[Computational modeling|models]] to understand biological systems and relationships. 
Until recently, biologists did not have access to very large amounts of data. This data has now become commonplace, particularly in [[molecular biology]] and [[genomics]]. Researchers were able to develop analytical methods for interpreting biological information, but were unable to share them quickly among colleagues.&lt;ref name="Hogeweg 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hogeweg|first=Paulien|title=The Roots of Bioinformatics in Theoretical Biology|journal=PLOS Computational Biology|date=7 March 2011|volume=7|issue=3|series=3|doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002021|pages=e1002021|pmid=21483479|pmc=3068925}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
  
Bioinformatics began to develop in the early 1970s. It was considered the science of analyzing informatics processes of various biological systems. At this time, research in [[artificial intelligence]] was using network models of the human brain in order to generate new [[algorithms]]. This use of biological data to develop other fields pushed biological researchers to revisit the idea of using computers to evaluate and compare large data sets. By 1982, information was being shared among researchers through the use of punch cards. The amount of data being shared began to grow exponentially by the end of the 1980s. This required the development of new computational methods in order to quickly analyze and interpret relevant information.&lt;ref name="Hogeweg 2011"/&gt;
      
Since the late 1990s, computational biology has become an important part of developing emerging technologies for the field of biology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bourne|first=Philip|title=Rise and Demise of Bioinformatics? Promise and Progress|doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002487|volume=8|issue=4|journal=PLoS Computational Biology|pages=e1002487|pmid=22570600|pmc=3343106|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The terms computational biology and [[evolutionary computation]] have a similar name, but are not to be confused. Unlike computational biology, evolutionary computation is not concerned with modeling and analyzing biological data. It instead creates algorithms based on the ideas of evolution across species. Sometimes referred to as [[genetic algorithm]]s, the research of this field can be applied to computational biology. While evolutionary computation is not inherently a part of computational biology, Computational evolutionary biology is a subfield of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Foster|first=James|title=Evolutionary Computation|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|volume=2|issue=6|pages=428–436|date=June 2001|doi=10.1038/35076523|pmid=11389459}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Computational biology has been used to help sequence the human genome, create accurate models of the human brain, and assist in modeling biological systems.&lt;ref name="Hogeweg 2011"/&gt;

==Subfields==

===Computational anatomy===
{{main|Computational anatomy}}
Computational anatomy is a discipline focusing on the study of anatomical shape and form at the visible or [[Gross anatomy|gross anatomical]] &lt;math&gt; 50-100 \mu &lt;/math&gt; 
scale of [[morphology (biology)|morphology]]. It involves the development and application of computational, mathematical and data-analytical methods for modeling and simulation of biological structures. It focuses on the anatomical structures being imaged, rather than the medical imaging devices. Due to the availability of dense 3D measurements via technologies such as [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI), computational anatomy has emerged as a subfield of [[medical imaging]] and [[bioengineering]] for extracting anatomical coordinate systems at the morphome scale in 3D.

The original formulation of computational anatomy is as a generative model of shape and form from exemplars acted upon via transformations.&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Computational Anatomy: An Emerging Discipline|url = http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=309082.309089|journal = Q. Appl. Math. |volume=56 |issue=4 |pages=617–694 |date = 1998-12-01 |first = Ulf|last = Grenander|first2 = Michael I.|last2 = Miller}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[diffeomorphism]] group is used to study different coordinate systems via [[change of basis|coordinate transformations]] as generated via the [[Lagrangian and Eulerian specification of the flow field|Lagrangian and Eulerian velocities of flow]] from one anatomical configuration in &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb R}^3&lt;/math&gt; to another. It relates with [[shape statistics]] and [[morphometrics]], with the distinction that [[diffeomorphism]]s are used to map coordinate systems, whose study is known as diffeomorphometry.

===Computational biomodeling===
{{main|Modelling biological systems}}
Computational biomodeling is a field concerned with building [[computer model]]s of biological systems. Computational biomodeling aims to develop and use visual simulations in order to assess the complexity of biological systems. This is accomplished through the use of specialized algorithms, and visualization software. These models allow for prediction of how systems will react under different environments. This is useful for determining if a system is robust. A robust biological system is one that “maintain their state and functions against external and internal perturbations”,&lt;ref name="Kitano 2002 206–10"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kitano|first=Hiroaki|title=Computational systems biology|journal=Nature|date=14 November 2002|volume=420|issue=6912|pages=206–10|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/204483859/abstract?accountid=6167|doi=10.1038/nature01254|pmid=12432404}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is essential for a biological system to survive. Computational biomodeling generates a large archive of such data, allowing for analysis from multiple users. While current techniques focus on small biological systems, researchers are working on approaches that will allow for larger networks to be analyzed and modeled. A majority of researchers believe that this will be essential in developing modern medical approaches to creating new drugs and gene therapy.&lt;ref name="Kitano 2002 206–10"/&gt;
A useful modelling approach is to use [[Petri nets]] via tools such as esyN &lt;ref name="Bean 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Favrin|first=Bean|title=esyN: Network Building, Sharing and Publishing.|journal=PLOS ONE|date=2 September 2014|pmid=25181461|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0106035|volume=9|issue=9|pmc=4152123|pages=e106035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computational genomics (Computational genetics)===
[[File:Genome viewer screenshot small.png|thumbnail|right|A partially sequenced genome.]]
{{main|Computational genomics}}
Computational genomics is a field within [[genomics]] which studies the [[genome]]s of cells and organisms. It is sometimes referred to as [[Computational and Statistical Genetics]] and encompasses much of [[Bioinformatics]]. The [[Human Genome Project]] is one example of computational genomics. This project looks to sequence the entire human genome into a set of data. Once fully implemented, this could allow for doctors to analyze the genome of an individual patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Genome Sequencing to the Rest of Us|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=personal-genome-sequencing|publisher=Scientific American}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This opens the possibility of personalized medicine, prescribing treatments based on an individual’s pre-existing genetic patterns. This project has created many similar programs. Researchers are looking to sequence the genomes of animals, plants, bacteria, and all other types of life.&lt;ref name="Koonin 2001 155–158"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koonin|first=Eugene|title=Computational Genomics|date=6 March 2001|volume=11|issue=5|pages=155–158|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982201000811|doi=10.1016/S0960-9822(01)00081-1|pmid=11267880|journal=Curr. Biol.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the main ways that genomes are compared is by [[sequence homology]]. Homology is the study of biological structures and nucleotide sequences in different organisms that come from a common ancestor. Research suggests that between 80 and 90% of genes in newly sequenced prokaryotic genomes can be identified this way.&lt;ref name="Koonin 2001 155–158"/&gt;

This field is still in development. An untouched project in the development of computational genomics is the analysis of intergenic regions. Studies show that roughly 97% of the human genome consists of these regions.&lt;ref name="Koonin 2001 155–158" /&gt; Researchers in computational genomics are working on understanding the functions of non-coding regions of the human genome through the development of computational and statistical methods and via large consortia projects such as [[ENCODE]] (The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) and the Roadmap Epigenomics Project.

===Computational neuroscience===
{{main|Computational neuroscience}}
Computational neuroscience is the study of brain function in terms of the information processing properties of the structures that make up the nervous system. It is a subset of the field of neuroscience, and looks to analyze brain data to create practical applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BU Neuroscience|url=http://www.bu.edu/neuro/graduate/computational-neuroscience/}}&lt;/ref&gt; It looks to model the brain in order to examine specific types aspects of the neurological system. Various types of models of the brain include:
* Realistic Brain Models: These models look to represent every aspect of the brain, including as much detail at the cellular level as possible. Realistic models provide the most information about the brain, but also have the largest margin for error. More variables in a brain model create the possibility for more error to occur. These models do not account for parts of the cellular structure that scientists do not know about. Realistic brain models are the most computationally heavy and the most expensive to implement.&lt;ref name="Sejnowski 1988"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sejnowski|first=Terrence |author2=Christof Koch |author3=Patricia S. Churchland|title=Computational Neuroscience|date=9 September 1988|volume=241|series=4871}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Simplifying Brain Models:  These models look to limit the scope of a model in order to assess a specific physical property of the neurological system. This allows for the intensive computational problems to be solved, and reduces the amount of potential error from a realistic brain model.&lt;ref name="Sejnowski 1988"/&gt;
It is the work of computational neuroscientists to improve the [[algorithms]] and data structures currently used to increase the speed of such calculations.

===Computational pharmacology===
Computational pharmacology (from a computational biology perspective) is “the study of the effects of genomic data to find links between specific genotypes and diseases and then [[drug discovery|screening drug data]]”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Price|first=Michael|title=Computational Biologists: The Next Pharma Scientists?|url=http://sciencecareers.sciencemag.org/career_magazine/previous_issues/articles/2012_04_13/caredit.a1200041|date=2012-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[pharmaceutical industry]] requires a shift in methods to analyze drug data. Pharmacologists were able to use Microsoft Excel to compare chemical and genomic data related to the effectiveness of drugs. However, the industry has reached what is referred to as the Excel barricade. This arises from the limited number of cells accessible on a spreadsheet. This development led to the need for computational pharmacology. Scientists and researchers develop computational methods to analyze these massive data sets. This allows for an efficient comparison between the notable data points and allows for more accurate drugs to be developed.&lt;ref name="Walter"&gt;{{cite web|last=Jessen|first=Walter|title=Pharma's shifting strategy means more jobs for computational biologists|url=http://medcitynews.com/2012/04/pharmas-shifting-strategy-means-more-jobs-for-computational-biologists/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analysts project that if major medications fail due to patents, that computational biology will be necessary to replace current drugs on the market. Doctoral students in computational biology are being encouraged to pursue careers in industry rather than take Post-Doctoral positions. This is a direct result of major pharmaceutical companies needing more qualified analysts of the large data sets required for producing new drugs.&lt;ref name="Walter"/&gt;

===Computational evolutionary biology===
Computational biology has assisted the field of evolutionary biology in many capacities. This includes:
* Using DNA data to reconstruct the tree of life with [[computational phylogenetics]]
* Fitting [[population genetics]] models (either forward time&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Simulation of Genes and Genomes Forward in Time|journal=Current Genomics|author = Antonio Carvajal-Rodríguez|year = 2012|pmc=2851118|volume=11|issue=1|pages=58–61|doi=10.2174/138920210790218007|pmid=20808525}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[coalescent theory|backward time]]) to DNA data to make inferences about [[population growth|demographic]] or [[natural selection|selective]] history
* Building [[population genetics]] models of evolutionary systems from first principles in order to predict what is likely to evolve.

===Cancer computational biology===
Cancer computational biology is a field that aims to determine the future mutations in cancer through an algorithmic approach to analyzing data. Research in this field has led to the use of high-throughput measurement. High throughput measurement allows for the gathering of millions of data points using robotics and other sensing devices. This data is collected from DNA, RNA, and other biological structures. Areas of focus include determining the characteristics of tumors, analyzing molecules that are deterministic in causing cancer, and understanding how the human genome relates to the causation of tumors and cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yakhini|first=Zohar|title=Cancer Computational Biology|journal=BMC Bioinformatics|volume=12|pages=120|url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/12/120|doi=10.1186/1471-2105-12-120|pmid=21521513|pmc=3111371|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computational neuropsychiatry===
Computational neuropsychiatry is the emerging field that uses mathematical and computer-assisted modeling of brain mechanisms involved in mental disorders. It was already demonstrated by several initiatives that computational modeling is an important contribution to understand neuronal circuits that could generate mental functions and dysfunctions.&lt;ref&gt;Dauvermann, Maria R., Heather C. Whalley, André Schmidt, Graham L. Lee, Liana Romaniuk, Neil Roberts, Eve C. Johnstone, Stephen M. Lawrie, and Thomas WJ Moorhead. "Computational neuropsychiatry–schizophrenia as a cognitive brain network disorder." Frontiers in psychiatry 5 (2014).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tretter, Felix, and M. Albus. "“Computational Neuropsychiatry” of Working Memory Disorders in Schizophrenia: The Network Connectivity in Prefrontal Cortex-Data and Models." Pharmacopsychiatry 40, no. S 1 (2007): S2-S16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marin-Sanguino, A., and E. R. Mendoza. "Hybrid modeling in computational neuropsychiatry." Pharmacopsychiatry 41, no. S 01 (2008): S85-S88.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Software and tools==
Computational Biologists use a wide range of software. These range from command line programs to graphical and web-based programs.

===Open source software===
[[Open source software]] provides a platform to develop computational biological methods. Specifically, open source means that every person and/or entity can access and benefit from software developed in research. [[PLOS]] cites four main reasons for the use of open source software including:
*[[Reproducibility]]: This allows for researchers to use the exact methods used to calculate the relations between biological data.
*Faster Development: developers and researchers do not have to reinvent existing code for minor tasks. Instead they can use pre-existing programs to save time on the development and implementation of larger projects.
* Increased quality: Having input from multiple researchers studying the same topic provides a layer of assurance that errors will not be in the code.
*Long-term availability: Open source programs are not tied to any businesses or patents. This allows for them to be posted to multiple web pages and ensure that they are available in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=PLOS Computational Biology| doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002799 | volume=8| issue=11 |title=The PLOS Computational Biology Software Section|pages=e1002799|year=2012|last1=Prlić|first1=Andreas| last2=Lapp | first2=Hilmar }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conferences==
There are several large conferences that are concerned with computational biology. Some notable examples are [[Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology]] (ISMB), [[European Conference on Computational Biology]] (ECCB) and [[Research in Computational Molecular Biology]] (RECOMB).

==Journals==

There are numerous journals dedicated to computational biology. Some notable examples include [[Journal of Computational Biology]] and [[PLOS Computational Biology]]. The PLOS computational biology journal is a peer-reviewed journal that has many notable research projects in the field of computational biology. They provide reviews on software, tutorials for open source software, and display information on upcoming computational biology conferences. [[PLOS Computational Biology]] is an [[open access journal]]. The publication may be openly used provided the author is cited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PLOS Computational Biology|url=http://www.ploscompbiol.org/static/information}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently a new open access journal [http://biopublisher.ca/index.php/cmb Computational Molecular Biology] was launched.

==Related fields==

Computational biology, [[bioinformatics]] and [[mathematical and theoretical biology|mathematical biology]] are all interdisciplinary approaches to the life sciences that draw from quantitative disciplines such as mathematics and [[information science]]. The [[National Institutes of Health|NIH]] describes computational/mathematical biology as the use of computational/mathematical approaches to address theoretical and experimental questions in biology and, by contrast, bioinformatics as the application of information science to understand complex life-sciences data.&lt;ref name="nih"/&gt;

Specifically, the NIH defines

{{quote|Computational biology: The development and application of data-analytical and theoretical methods, mathematical modeling and computational simulation techniques to the study of biological, behavioral, and social systems.&lt;ref name="nih"/&gt;}}

{{quote|Bioinformatics: Research, development, or application of computational tools and approaches for expanding the use of biological, medical, behavioral or health data, including those to acquire, store, organize, archive, analyze, or visualize such data.&lt;ref name="nih"/&gt;}}

While each field is distinct, there may be significant overlap at their interface.&lt;ref name="nih"/&gt;

'''Death's Head''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] character appearing in [[British comics]] and [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is depicted as a robotic bounty hunter (or rather, as he calls himself, a "freelance peace-keeping agent"). The character was created by writer [[Simon Furman]] and artist [[Geoff Senior]] for the company's [[Marvel UK]] imprint. Furman decided to use Death's Head in his [[List of Transformers comic book series|Transformers]] stories, but believed that characters appearing in Transformers "were prone to be absorbed into that title's catchall copyright"&lt;ref name="vol1intro" /&gt; (allowing [[Hasbro]] to contest their ownership) and led to a one-page strip titled "High Noon Tex" (which was subsequently published in various Marvel UK titles) being hastily created to establish Marvel's ownership of the character.&lt;ref name="vol1intro" /&gt;  Furman has stated that he chose the name Death's Head for the character while unaware of the "Nazi-connotations of the name", referring to the [[Waffen-SS]] [[Totenkopf Division]], whose name translates to "death's head".&lt;ref name="vol1intro"/&gt;

The character was later redesigned and relaunched as '''Death's Head II''', acting as one of the flagship characters for Marvel UK's 1990s expansion. This version of Death's Head also inspired two spin-off characters, '''[[Death Wreck]]''' and '''[[Death Metal (comics)|Death Metal]]''', each of which starred in its own [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]].

Later, in 2005, fans used a poll on Marvel's website to vote for the character's return. This led to a third version of Death's Head, '''Death's Head 3.0''', created by original Death's Head writer Simon Furman. Simon Furman said in 2011 that the character was still popular because “he'll never change or compromise or grow or repent or agonise like most comic book characters. He's this unchanging, uncompromising rock that other characters bounce off. But you still kind of love him. Weird.”&lt;ref name="starburstmagazine.com"&gt;[http://www.starburstmagazine.com/features/feature-articles/1340-simon-furman-interview-deaths-head ''Death's Head'' retrospective for ''Starbust'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication history==

===Death's Head===
Death's Head was originally created as a "throwaway character" for use in the UK ''[[Transformers (Marvel Comics)|Transformers]]'' comic, a bounty hunter who would feature in a single story-arc and then, according to writer Simon Furman, would "be discarded down the line (probably at the end of the first story arc)".&lt;ref name="vol1intro"&gt;Furman, Simon (2006). "Freelance Peacekeeping Agent Open For Business (or how Death's Head came to be)", ''Death's Head Volume 1'', Panini Publishing, {{ISBN|1-905239-34-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geoff Senior then showed Furman the initial character designs, at which point they decided that the character had potential beyond his planned appearance as a "generic, stock mech-with-an-attitude". As a result of this, Simon Furman also rewrote the Transformers scripts to change Death's Head's dialogue in line with the revised character concept.&lt;ref name="vol1intro"/&gt;

To avoid [[Hasbro]] claiming ownership of the character as a consequence of the ''Transformers'' copyright terms they had agreed with Marvel, Death's Head had to make his debut in another Marvel comic before appearing in ''Transformers'' (this situation had also applied to another Marvel character created for use in ''Transformers'', [[Circuit Breaker (Transformers)|Circuit Breaker]]).&lt;ref name="vol1intro"/&gt; Accordingly, Furman wrote a single-page strip ("High Noon Tex", illustrated by [[Bryan Hitch]]) that was published in a number of Marvel UK titles.

After the initial ''Transformers'' storylines, the character appeared in ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' #135 (Apr. 1988), in a story which saw him reduced from a giant robot to a more human stature, by means of "one of [[Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]]'s Tissue Compression Eliminators." He then made a guest appearance in Marvel UK's ''[[Dragon's Claws]]'' #5 (Nov. 1988), which led into an ongoing series of his own. The first issue prompted a letter from [[Stan Lee]], praising the character and creative team, but a variety of factors, such as distribution and ''Death's Head'''s smaller size ('US format') causing it to be obscured by larger comics, meant the comic was cancelled at #10.&lt;ref name="starburstmagazine.com"/&gt;

After the cancellation of the series, Marvel UK published an origin story for the character, "The Body in Question", initially serialised in the Marvel UK anthology ''Strip #13-20'',{{Issue|date=November 2009}} and later collected in a single [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]].

Death's Head returned to the main Marvel Universe in ''[[S.W.O.R.D. (comics)|S.W.O.R.D.]]'' #1 (November 2009), written by [[Kieron Gillen]]. Gillen has confirmed that the character will feature in the first story arc, spanning issues 1-5.&lt;ref name="Kieron Gillen's blog"&gt;[http://gillen.cream.org/wordpress_html/?p=1744 Kieron Gillen's blog]&lt;/ref&gt; Gillen has said "if you can't bring back a time-traveling dimension-skipper, who ''can'' you bring back?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Marc |last=Strom |url=http://marvel.com/news/comicstories.9122.Chicago_Con_~apos~09~colon~_S~dot~W~dot~O~dot~R~dot~D~dot~_ |title=Chicago Con '09: S.W.O.R.D. Ongoing |publisher=[[Marvel.com]] |date=August 10, 2009 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He asked Furman before using the character.&lt;ref name="starburstmagazine.com"/&gt; It was implied that this was Death's Head ''before'' he meets the Transformers (see Fictional Biography).

Death's Head appeared in the [[Panini Comics]] title ''[[Marvel Heroes (comics)|Marvel Heroes]]'' #33 (March 2011). He appears in the last frame of "The Hero Inside" written by [[Ferg Handley]], with art by [[John Ross (comics)|John Ross]].

In 2013, Death's Head started to show up in "Marvel NOW!". He appeared in both Kieron Gillen's ''Iron Man'', as part of the start of ''The Secret Origin of Tony Stark'' and in ''Avenging Spider-Man'' #17. In the latter, he's human-sized and still working for the [[Time Variance Authority|TVA]].

===Death's Head II===
After the initial Death's Head stories ceased publication, the character was revamped for inclusion in Marvel UK's next wave of titles, where it became the company's biggest ever exported seller.

There were plans in 1991 to bring back the original Death's Head, which would have featured the character on trial and facing the death penalty, and flashing back to how he'd got there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://downthetubes.net/?p=34552 Down the Tubes: "To The Death: Simon Furman And Geoff Senior talk world building and roads not taken on Death's Head"]&lt;/ref&gt; Early into production the new editor [[Paul Neary]] scrapped it and commissioned ''Death's Head II'' instead:&lt;ref name="starburstmagazine.com"/&gt; replacing the character with a new version, created by [[Dan Abnett]], [[Andy Lanning]], and [[Liam Sharp]]. In an autumn 1992 interview with ''Comic World'', Neary was dismissive about the original character and the aborted : "I didn't like the pages that had been produced - I didn't think there was much future in Transformers-style robots and I thought we could do an awful lot better." He produced some sample sketches of how he wanted the character to look,and Liam Sharp's take gave the project "a kickstart".&lt;ref&gt;[http://starlogged.blogspot.co.uk/2013/11/1992-deaths-head-ii-interview-in-comic.html scans of Comic World #8 at "Starlogged: 1992: DEATH'S HEAD II INTERVIEW In COMIC WORLD MAGAZINE"] (13th November 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically, the success of Death's Head II meant Neary was ordered to create more titles and the easiest way was to reprint the original series ("The Incomplete Death's Head"); editor John Freeman had to talk him into it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://starlogged.blogspot.co.uk/2013/11/1992-deaths-head-ii-interview-in-comic.html?showComment=1396026038197#c7543124516161125598 John Freeman's comment at Starlogged, 28th March 2014]: "Actually, Paul was ordered to come up with more Death's Head titles because of the success of Death's Head II and the easiest way to do that was to reprint the original series. That didn't mean he liked it... I suggested the 'wraparound story' featuring DHII to help convince him to do it, written by Dan Abnett and drawn by Simon Coleby. Other voices helped assure him the original Death's Head was much loved!"&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally launched as a four-issue limited series, ''Death's Head II'' then became an ongoing series - and also featured in a number of team-up limited series designed to showcase new Marvel UK characters. One of these was ''Death&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'', teaming up Death's Head II with newly created "brothers", Death Metal and his prototype Death Wreck. The recurring character throughout this was Dr [[Evelyn Necker]], the scientist who creates the Minion series (Death's Head II and his "brothers"). Death's Head II became the flagship character for Marvel UK - a costume was even made for promotional appearances and was part of the 1993 [[Lord Mayor's Show]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVsTYvesev0 YouTube: Marvel UK Lord Mayor's Show](October 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; - and there were concerns at Marvel UK in early 1993 that they could be overestimating his popularity and over-exposing the character.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/217618955/Marvel-UK-Comics-Pending-01-1993 Marvel UK Comics Pending 01 1993 (documents by John Freeman)]&lt;/ref&gt; When Marvel UK was cancelled, a Death's Head II/Punisher crossover was in production&lt;ref&gt;[http://starlogged.blogspot.co.uk/2013/06/1994-unpublished-deaths-head-ii-vs.html Starlogged: "1994: The unpublished DEATH'S HEAD II Vs. THE PUNISHER (Marvel UK)"]&lt;/ref&gt; and he was playing a key role in the completed, but never published, ''Loose Cannons'' (released online).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.2000ad.org/markus/loosecannons/ Loose Cannons]&lt;/ref&gt;

Furman has said he felt Death's Head II "lost his [DH's] most important aspect; the dark-edged gallows humour. So in and of itself I think it's a very tight, proficient and action-packed comic that really tapped into that early 90s anti-hero vibe. But to me it was never Death's Head. It was another character.” &lt;ref name="starburstmagazine.com"/&gt;

Aside from a cameo in the ''[[Avengers Forever]]'' limited series,&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Forever'' #11 (October 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Death's Head II was not featured in a Marvel comic again until 2009. A planned ''Punisher-Death's Head II'' series never saw the light of day, and Liam Sharp pitched a revival on which Marvel passed.&lt;ref name=ultimatedh&gt;[http://liamsharp.deviantart.com/art/Ultimate-Death-s-Head-46243797 Ultimate Death's Head] and [http://liamsharp.deviantart.com/art/Death-s-Head-reboot-pic-53360263 Death's Head revival] artwork on Liam Sharp's DeviantArt page&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Abnett and Lanning (collectively referred to as "DnA") used Doctor Necker as a member of [[Project Pegasus]], while writing the ongoing ''[[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]]'' series during that comic's involvement with Marvel's "[[Secret Invasion]]" storyline.&lt;ref name="Nova #17 2008"&gt;''Nova'' #17 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;  In the story, it was mentioned that Necker was working on a project to develop a cyborg called "Minion". DnA said "This is us just having fun - the Death's Head thread has recently been worked back into the [[Marvel Universe]] via ''[[Hulk (comics)#Planet Hulk and World War Hulk|Planet Hulk]]'', and we thought we would tie a few loose ends together."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=18215 Quantum Leap: DnA Talk "Nova"], [[Comic Book Resources]], September 25, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Writer [[Paul Cornell]] featured Death's Head in a cameo appearance in the final issue of ''[[Captain Britain and MI13]]'',&lt;ref name="MI13' 2009"&gt;''Captain Britain and MI13'' #15 (September 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; appearing alongside a number of other Marvel UK characters who had not appeared for several years. Paul Cornell mentioned in an interview that he wrote the splash page due to #15 being the final issue and had no plans before to use Death's Head "because the character isn't actually British".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comicsbulletin.com/features/124893198333150.htm Paul Cornell: A Close to Captain Britain and a Beginning for New Heroes: Interviews &amp; Features Archive - Comics Bulletin] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805020121/http://www.comicsbulletin.com/features/124893198333150.htm |date=2009-08-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===="Death's Head Quorum"====

[[David Leach (comics)|David Leach]], then a Marvel UK editor on the Death's Head titles, was greenlit to write a new reboot on Death's Head II in the mid-90s, which would feature only that character and no other ties to the previous title: Leach's title for the series was ''Death's Head Quorum'', and [[Simon Coleby]] would be artist. It was part of a wider reboot of Marvel UK, involving four titles. Leach got the job after telling Paul Neary that the character was boring and joking "we should completely overhaul him, reduce his power, lose the time travel aspect and set it in present day England", only to find Neary liked the idea.

The series would have a powerful entity called the Time Keeper, meant to be watching timelines but had started creating hunting tournaments out of boredom, viciously beating DHII, depowering him, and stranding him in 90s Earth: the remaining personalities in Death's Head II's databanks form a quorum and force Death's Head to follow their dictats or they'll shut down his body. Death's Head would join a secret community underneath London, preyed upon by the hunts organised by the Time Keeper, and finally getting revenge on the Time Keeper but deciding to stay in London; the first issue would also end with Death's Head's "mask" being broken and showing his "true human face" (Leach apparently believed Death's Head II's face was a mask). However, the comic was wound up before more than #1 could be written, and the details are only known because of a November 2010 interview with Leach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://itcamefromdarkmoor.blogspot.com/2010/11/deaths-head-which-almost-was-interview.html It Came From Darkmoor: The Death's Head that Almost Was]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death's Head 3.0===
A third version of Death's Head was introduced in 2005, the result of an online poll on the Marvel Comics website.&lt;ref name="paniccia"&gt;[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?threadid=50003 Pniccia on Death's Head 3.0 &amp; Amfan Things to Come] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929134408/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?threadid=50003 |date=2007-09-29 }}, [[Newsarama]], November 21, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Fans were given the chance to choose between four existing Marvel characters - Death's Head, [[Woodgod]], [[Wundarr the Aquarian|The Aquarian]] and [[Texas Twister]]. The winning character was to be revamped and would then receive their own storyline in Marvel's ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'' title. Death's Head won, receiving 49% of the vote.&lt;ref name="paniccia"/&gt;

Death's Head creator Simon Furman stated that he contacted Marvel as soon as he became aware of the poll.&lt;ref name="furmandh3"&gt;[http://www.comixfan.com/xfan/forums/showthread.php?t=37077 Simon Furman: Transforming Death's Head Into Annihilation], Comixfan, December 21, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; ''Amazing Fantasy'' editor Mark Paniccia had already intended to contact Furman to ask him some questions about the character,&lt;ref name="paniccia"/&gt; and their conversation also led to Furman writing the initial ''Death's Head 3.0'' story. The character's look was one of the Reaver cyborgs from the [[Hulk (comics)|Incredible Hulk]] storyline ''Planet Hulk''.&lt;ref name="starburstmagazine.com"/&gt;

The initial ''Death's Head 3.0'' story also included a number of elements which tied it into previous ''Amazing Fantasy'' stories - Death's Head's sentience and power source comes from AIM's attempts to first capture and then replicate the power that created [[Captain Universe]]. Issue #16 revealed the scientist that began the project was [[Monica Rappaccini]], mother of the new [[Scorpion (Carmilla Black)|Scorpion]], on the back of her attempts to capture the Uni-Power in other titles. Varina Goddard is revealed via AIM records to be Monica's granddaughter.&lt;ref&gt;Amazing Fantasy vol. 2 #18&lt;/ref&gt; Furman says he has "mixed feelings" about the story, as he likes it but feels that this isn't Death's Head; “I always thought it strange that poll was to bring back one character and what readers got was another entirely... I'd have much rather done the original.” &lt;ref name="starburstmagazine.com"/&gt;

While the Minion project is mentioned as the reason for Death's Head being given his name, no other ties to the previous Death's Heads were included. However, Simon Furman has stated that he would "work in a little retroactive back story to create a kind of unified Death's Head-verse" if the character was revived in the future at some point &lt;ref name="furmandh3"/&gt; and it has come out that he had originally intended to imply Death's Head 3.0 was the ''original'' in an early form.,&lt;ref name="Simon Williams on Death's Head"&gt;[http://soulmaninc.blogspot.com/2010/08/deaths-head.html Simon Williams on Death's Head]&lt;/ref&gt; which the warlock Lupex would abduct and turn into Death's Head's body. Marvel rejected the idea though.&lt;ref name="starburstmagazine.com"/&gt; In ''Nova'' #17, Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning did their own version, showing the Minion project was originally based on a Death's Head "3.0" cyborg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_QqxEzkl_lrA/SPzAi0bpT_I/AAAAAAAAAes/fbCplGoZS6w/s1600-h/minion1.jpg]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ultimate Marvel===
In 2006, Liam Sharp and Bryan Hitch pitched a Death's Head revival mini-series, originally for Marvel's [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate]] line, which was not greenlit. The details of the pitch are unknown, though the design for "Ultimate Death's Head" (based mainly on DHII) is available online, as is a poster image marked "Death's Head reboot pic" that showed a recoloured Minion marked with the [[Saint George]] Cross and holding a tattered [[flag of England|English flag]]. Sharp's comments on the latter were that the revival was "on the surface a real gung-ho macho nationalistic piece of work - but anybody who knows me would know it wouldn't have stayed that way for long...".&lt;ref name=ultimatedh /&gt;

===Revolutionary War===
On February 12, 2014, Marvel's [[Marvel Universe]] imprint released #1 of a new series featuring both the original incarnation of Death's Head, and Death's Head II: 'The long-awaited return of DEATH'S HEAD—one of the biggest hits of the original Marvel UK! Death's Head! Death's Head II! On an adventure together for the first time EVER! What threat could be grave enough to bring these two heroes together from across time?

==Fictional character biography==

===Death's Head===
Death's Head's first appearance after ''High Noon Tex'' was in the ''[[Transformers (Marvel Comics)|Transformers]]'', seeing him attempt to claim the bounty that [[Rodimus Prime]] had placed on [[Galvatron]]'s head, travelling back in time to the 1980s in pursuit of his quarry. Realising the error he had made in placing the bounty, Rodimus followed him back, and stopped him from destroying Galvatron, forcibly returning him to the future.&lt;ref&gt;''Transformers'' vol.1 Issue 120&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Death's Head was contracted by the [[Decepticons]] to take out Rodimus Prime, a piece of business that Death's Head considered a pleasure. However, Rodimus outsmarted him, and instead paid him to terminate [[Cyclonus]] and [[Scourge (Transformers)|Scourge]].&lt;ref&gt;''Transformers'' vol.1 Issue 134)&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of the next year, Death's Head pursued them, eventually confronting them on the [[Planet of Junk]], where they all fell under the mental control of [[Unicron]].

Death's Head tried to resist the control, but was manipulated into killing [[Shockwave (Transformers)|Shockwave]], only to eventually help Rodimus Prime seal Unicron within the [[Creation Matrix|Matrix]]. Finally, prevented from escaping the scene by the explosions wracking the area, Death's Head forced himself, Cyclonus and Scourge through Unicron's time portal, vowing to kill them "another time".&lt;ref&gt;''Transformers'' vol. 1 Issue 152&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the course of the time travel they became separated, and while Cyclonus and Scourge wound up on Cybertron in the past, eventually joining with [[Scorponok]] and becoming [[Targetmasters]], Death's Head instead encountered the [[Time Lord]] known as [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]].&lt;ref name="dwm135"&gt;{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Simon Furman]] | Artist = [[Geoff Senior]] | Story = The Crossroads of Time | Title = [[Doctor Who Magazine]] | Issue = 135 | Date = April 1988| Publisher = [[Marvel UK]] | }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a matter of self-defense, The Doctor shrank him to human size and shot him off through time. He arrived on Earth in the year 8162, leading to an encounter with the future government's troubleshooting team, [[Dragon's Claws]], where he was heavily damaged in an explosion and buried under a collapsing building.&lt;ref name="claws5"&gt;{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Simon Furman]] | Artist = [[Geoff Senior]] | Story = Death's Head! | Title = [[Dragon's Claws]] | Issue = 5 | Date =  November 1988| Publisher = [[Marvel UK]] | }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Death's Head was recovered by the Chain Gang and rebuilt (with a redesigned body) by one of their members, Spratt.&lt;ref name="dh1"&gt;{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Simon Furman]] | Penciller = [[Bryan Hitch]] | Inker = [[Mark Farmer]] | Story = Death's Head Revisited | Title = Death's Head | Issue = 1 | Date =  December 1988| Publisher = [[Marvel UK]] | }}&lt;/ref&gt; In exchange for this rescue, he confronted Dragon's Claws again on the Chain Gang's behalf, defeating and capturing Scavenger. When the Claws came to recover their missing member, Death's Head defeated Dragon - but opted not to kill him, instead walking away and stating that his chronometer was "a minute slow" and his contract had therefore expired. The Chain Gang were arrested and Spratt, who had escaped arrest, opted to join Death's Head.&lt;ref name="dh2"&gt;{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Simon Furman]] | Penciller = [[Bryan Hitch]] | Inker = [[Dave Hine]] | Story = Contractual Obligations | Title = Death's Head | Issue = 2 | Date =  January 1989| Publisher = [[Marvel UK]] | }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Death's Head and Spratt then relocated to the Los Angeles Resettlement, where Death's Head once again went into business as a Freelance Peacekeeping Agent.&lt;ref name="dh3"&gt;{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Simon Furman]] | Penciller = [[Bryan Hitch]] | Inker = [[Dave Hine]] | Story = High Stakes | Title = Death's Head | Issue = 3 | Date =  February 1989| Publisher = [[Marvel UK]] | }}&lt;/ref&gt; Death's Head was later hired to capture the Doctor and his [[TARDIS]], which led him to being stuck in the present day (where he confronted the ''[[Fantastic Four]]'')&lt;ref&gt;''Death's Head'' vol.1 Issue 9&lt;/ref&gt; and then sent by Reed Richards to the year 2020 (where he met the [[Iron Man 2020|Iron Man of that era]] and gave him friendly advice on mercenary work).&lt;ref&gt;''Death's Head'' vol.1 Issue 10&lt;/ref&gt; The series was ended abruptly with a cliffhanger at issue 10 due to the closure of [[Marvel UK]]'s own creative team.&lt;ref&gt;''Death's Head'' vol 1 Issue 10&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, the ongoing storyline was resolved in the [[Marvel UK]] ''Death's Head: The Body in Question'' story, which was serialized in the magazine ''Strip'' before being reprinted in the [[Marvel Graphic Novel]] format. In this story, Death's Head was becoming worried that he was starting to enjoy killing and was prolonging missions for fun rather than simply doing it for money. In addition, Death's Head's origins were revealed to him for the first time. His mechanoid body had originally been constructed to host the life energy of the techno-mage Lupex, a psychotic who hunted beings for sport and stole their bodies upon killing them. However, a woman named Pyra, who wished to steal Lupex' secrets, ultimately decided to use the mechanoid body against him. She gave it a cold and calculating business-like mind, but before it could be used against Lupex, the body was stolen by an unknown party, enlarged to the size of the [[Cybertron]]ians, and catapulted through time. Death's Head was used as a pawn by Pyra, who wished to get him to a point where he could kill Lupex, while Lupex had begun to hunt Death's Head with the intention of gaining his body. Driven to his mental limits and nearly killed, he eventually was able to kill Lupex and, refusing to be anything like his "father", killed him quickly while declaring he "kill[s] ''only'' for profit or survival!".

Around this time, Death's Head's also made a few appearances in some US Marvel comics, most notably the ''[[Fantastic Four]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''Fantastic Four'' #338&lt;/ref&gt; (where he was hired by the Time Variance Authority) ''[[She-Hulk]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Sensational She-Hulk'' #24&lt;/ref&gt; (where he resigned from the TVA), and ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Comics Presents'' #76&lt;/ref&gt;

In the final issue (#12) of ''The Incomplete Death's Head'', the Doctor claims to have been responsible for sending Death's Head to the Transformers Universe. Despite being a manipulative being, especially in his seventh incarnation, it could be that this claim is false. There is nothing else within Death's Head's history to substantiate this claim.

====2010's Death's Head====

Death's Head appears in the first five issues of the ''[[S.W.O.R.D. (comics)|S.W.O.R.D.]]'' ongoing series,&lt;ref name="Kieron Gillen's blog"/&gt; hunting down [[Abigail Brand]]'s brother. He was given a partial redesign, with his head having some elements from the Minion version, and is his original giant size. He is not using the term "freelance peacekeeper" until the [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] suggests it to him and Death's Head notes that he likes it, and he doesn't appear to be a time/dimensional traveler. This seems to indicate this is Death's Head ''before'' he met the Transformers&lt;ref&gt;[http://itcamefromdarkmoor.blogspot.com/2009/12/deaths-head-is-back-yes-and-possibly.html Death's Head is BACK, yes? And possibly... for the FIRST time?!?]&lt;/ref&gt; and the human-sized, Bryan Hitch model Death's Head would appear separately in other comics.

In an ''Iron Man'' run by the same writer, he was hired by the alien race Voldi to face Tony Stark in a gladiator-like trial by combat; afterwards, Stark hired him to help track down the Voldi's killer, Unit 451. (Death's Head asked if he was one of "those guys who has a code against killing "except for robots"? I ''hate'' those krypto-fascists.") Unfortunately for Stark, 451 had hired the peacekeeper first and he led him into a trap (and returned Stark's fee). He passed up Stark's offer to double 451's fee as "a mech has to have ethics, yes?"&lt;ref&gt;Iron Man #11: "The Secret Origin of Tony Stark Part 1" (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Doctor Octopus]] was masquerading as the [[Superior Spider-Man]], he had to battle Death's Head; the Time Variance Authority had sent the mercenary to kill the [[Future Foundation]]. Octavius found a way around this.&lt;ref&gt;''Avenging Spider-Man'' #17&lt;/ref&gt;

====Enemies and associates====

*'''Spratt''' - an enthusiastic and barely-tolerated young sidekick, who rebuilt Death's Head for the Chain Gang then assumed the role of his partner. Following Death's Head's assimilation by Minion, Spratt recovered the body and tried to rebuild Death's Head once again. He was aided in this by Baron Strucker IV, but was betrayed and killed by the Strucker-Charnel amalgam.&lt;ref name="DHII3"&gt;{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Dan Abnett]] | Penciller = [[Liam Sharp]] | Inker = [[Andy Lanning]] | Story = The Wild Hunt #3: Outlaws! | Title = Death’s Head II Limited Series | Issue = 3 | Date =  May 1992| Publisher = [[Marvel UK]] | }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Dragon's Claws]]''' - a team of government-sponsored enforcers who twice clashed with Death's Head. The first instance, interceding when he was battling one of their targets, The Jones Boys, resulted in Death's Head being heavily defeated. On the second occasion, a newly-rebuilt Death's Head captured one of the Claws, Scavenger, and defeated the others who came to rescue him, but chose to spare them on a technicality.&lt;ref name="deathshead2"&gt;{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Simon Furman]] | Penciller = [[Bryan Hitch]] | Inker = [[David Hine]] | Story = Contractual Obligations | Title = Death's Head | Issue = 2 | Date =  January 1989| Publisher = [[Marvel UK]] | }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[The Seventh Doctor]]''' - the TARDIS collided with Death's Head as he was being expelled from the [[The Transformers (Marvel Comics)|Transformers']] Universe. The Doctor shrunk the Transformer-scale Death's Head to human size using a [[List of Doctor Who items#Tissue Compression Eliminator|Tissue Compression Eliminator]], then sent him to 8162. Death's Head was subsequently hired to kill The Doctor, but was betrayed by his employer and did not complete the contract.&lt;ref name="deathshead8"&gt;{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Steve Parkhouse]] | Penciller = [[Art Wetherell]] | Inker = [[Steve Parkhouse]] | Story = Time Bomb! | Title = Death's Head | Issue = 8 | Date =  July 1989| Publisher = [[Marvel UK]] | }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Doctor later claimed to be the 'unknown party' that originally stole Death's Head from his creators, Lupex and Pyra, and sent him into the Transformers Universe, hoping to shape his adventures for good.&lt;ref name="incompletedeathshead12"&gt;{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Dan Abnett]] | Penciller = [[Simon Coleby]] | Inker = [[Neil Bushnell]] | Story = The Final Chapter | Title = The Incomplete Death's Head | Issue = 12 | Date =  December 1993| Publisher = [[Marvel UK]] | }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Big Shot''' - a rival bounty hunter from 8162. Tall, muscular and with a cannon replacing his right arm, Big Shot was originally hired by a gangland boss, The Undertaker, to avenge the death of his Plague Dog creature. After a bitter defeat, Big Shot's enmity became personal.&lt;ref name="deathshead7"&gt;{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Simon Furman]] | Penciller = [[Bryan Hitch]] | Inker = [[Jeff Anderson]] | Story = Shot By Both Sides | Title = Death's Head | Issue = 7 | Date =  June 1989| Publisher = [[Marvel UK]] | }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was manipulated by Pyra and sent to 2020 to confront the mechanoid, where he almost succeeded in killing Death's Head.

===Death's Head II===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Death Wreck]]. See [[WP:MOS#Section management]] --&gt;
[[Image:Revolutionary War Death's Head II Vol 1 1 Sharp Variant Textless.jpg|right|thumb|Cover to ''Revolutionary War: Death's Head II'' (vol. 1) #1, featuring Death's Head II. Art by [[Mark Brooks (comics)|Mark Brooks]].]]

Eventually, after many undocumented adventures, Death's Head was beheaded and his personality "assimilated" into the mind of the [[cyborg]] Minion. Minion was a [[cyborg]] created by Dr. [[Evelyn Necker]], a long-term pet project created after years of research which included the [[Xandar]]ian Worldmind being temporarily uploaded into the Minion program's gestalt matrix.&lt;ref name="Nova #17 2008"/&gt; By the year 2020, she was an employee of [[AIM (comics)|AIM]] and the final Minion (as well as its prototype [[Death Wreck]]) was designed to protect the organisation from a psychically predicted threat; it killed and assimilated the minds of multiple targets as preparation for this!".{{Issue|date=November 2009}}

Death's Head's personality overwhelmed Minion's programming before it could take out its final target (Reed Richards of the Fantastic Four), and they became the [[wikt:gestalt|gestalt]] lifeform that called itself Death's Head II. Death's Head II was partnered with [[Tuck (comics)|Tuck]], an [[Android (robot)|artificial human]] from the pseudo-[[medieval]] planet of Lionheart, where humans had outlawed advanced technology and waged war against androids and cyborgs. Neo-Nazi black mage [[Baron Strucker]] IV would magically combine himself with the original Death's Head's corpse to become the supervillain Charnel,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/charneld.htm Charnel (Death's Head (Minion) foe)] at the Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe&lt;/ref&gt; a recurring enemy for Death's Head II and the threat AIM had predicted.

With other assimilated personalities mingling with that of the "freelance peacekeeper", Death's Head changed as a character, becoming a more heroic and far less amoral figure than the original, as well as losing his unique mannerisms. He hopped across time and realities in many adventures, often fighting for the greater good; in one adventure, he volunteered for a heroic sacrifice&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.2000ad.org/markus/loosecannons/book3.php ''Loose Cannons'' #3], page 16&lt;/ref&gt; whereas before he'd have required payment. He encountered many Marvel characters, including the Fantastic Four, [[X-Men]], [[Spider-Man]], the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], and [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], and crossed over with almost every Marvel UK character who was published at the time.

The original Death's Head was only ever seen again in flashbacks or within Death's Head II's gestalt mind, as well as the twelve-issue ''The Incomplete Death's Head'' limited series (which reprinted various Death's Head stories from the past with a new framing sequence), in which Death's Head and Death's Head II join forces to defeat a servant of an enemy of the original Death's Head.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}

Death's Head appeared briefly in the final issue of the ''[[Captain Britain and MI13]]'' ongoing series, as one of the MI13 reserves battling against an army of vampires on the moon. Whereas the other Marvel UK characters reintroduced in the issue were accompanied with captions explaining their long absences from the Marvel Universe (e.g. "Back from space"), Death's Head was captioned as "Just... back!", and given the line "Surprise appearance, yes?!".&lt;ref name="MI13' 2009"/&gt;

In 2010, Death's Head II was shown as a resident of a possible future in ''Avengers'' #2; this appearance also featured as one of the issue's alternative covers.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers'' #2 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Days of Future Past]]'' timeline, Death's Head II was part of Britain's Resistance Coordination Executive. Seen as indestructible, he became a symbol of their resolve until he was murdered in battle.&lt;ref&gt;''Excalibur'' #66, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

Death's Head II's design was created by artist [[Liam Sharp]], and he was primarily scripted by [[Dan Abnett]].

Death's Head II titles included the four-issue introductory [[Limited series (comics)|mini-series]], a sixteen-issue [[ongoing series]], and ''Death's Head II Gold'', a second mini-series (written by Liam Sharp), that was cancelled after the first issue.

===="What If Death's Head I Had Lived?"====
In issue #54 of the ''[[What If (comics)|What If]]'' (vol. 2) series, Simon Furman and Geoff Senior wrote and drew a tale showing Death's Head surviving Minion's attack and later killing the cyborg; something Furman has said was "deeply satisfying and cathartic".&lt;ref name=vol2intro&gt;Furman, Simon (2007). ''Death's Head Volume 2'', Panini Publishing, {{ISBN|1-905239-69-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Death's Head rebuilt his injured body into a larger, more heavily armed form; meanwhile the Minion cyborg went on to kill Reed Richards, only to be possessed by Strucker and became Charnel itself. Evelyn Necker had to hire Death's Head to stop this threat.

Using a time machine, Death's Head went back in time to gather the surviving Fantastic Four and several other superheroes, offering them a shot at avenging Reed by ending Charnel - and then let them all get killed softening up Charnel for him. Using his firepower on Charnel and goading him at not using the full potential of his gestalt mind, he got the cyborg to access these scientific minds - knowing this would allow Reed Richards' mind (still fighting within Charnel) to take control of the cyborg's motor functions, allowing him to kill it. His mission complete, Death's Head thought about the selfless, non-profit nature of heroes: "I just hope it's not catching, yes?"

===Death's Head 3.0===
[[Image:AMFAN016.jpg|right|thumb|Cover to ''Amazing Fantasy'' (vol. 2) #16, featuring Death's Head 3.0. Art by [[Lucio Parillo]].]]

The third version of Death's Head was introduced in a five-part storyline within the pages of Marvel's [[anthology]] series ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'', beginning in #16 (December 2005). Written by Death's Head creator Simon Furman and drawn by [[James Raiz]], the story is set 100 years in the future and does not appear to be directly linked to the previous Death's Head stories.

[[Advanced Idea Mechanics]] are set to make peace with the UN and become a legitimate non-terrorist organisation. Hardliner AIM Senior Scientist Patricia Goddard has decided to stop the peace treaty and force AIM back underground by assassinating the UN Secretary General, using a mysterious alien cyborg in AIM's possession codenamed Death's Head. Powered and given intelligence by an artificial variant on the [[Captain Universe|Uni-Power]], the cyborg is sent out into the field with preprogrammed objectives, but the clash between its murderous inclinations and an instinctive desire to help people leave it unsure what side it wants to be on.

The final panel of the Death's Head 3.0 story concludes with an image of the cyborg with mouth horns, alluding to the original Death's Head.{{Issue|date=November 2009}} It is mentioned as now operating as a deniable troubleshooter for the GEIST organisation (Global Enforcement/Intelligence Symposium Taskforce), carrying out operations they cannot be officially involved in for political reasons. 
(Comic artist [[Simon Williams (artist)|Simon Williams]] has said that Furman was going to end the story by having the character say "I'm Death's Head, yes?", to set up that Death's Head 3.0 was an early version of the original, but the "yes?" was cut off by the editor by mistake.&lt;ref name="Simon Williams on Death's Head"/&gt;)

This incarnation of Death's Head went on to appear on Sakaar, during the ''[[Hulk (comics)|Planet Hulk]]'' series.{{Issue|date=November 2009}} Similar models are used by the Hulk as soldiers during the ''[[World War Hulk]]'' event{{Issue|date=November 2009}} and one is used as an AIM courier in the ''[[MODOK]]'s 11'' limited series by Monica Rappaccini.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}

It is shown during Nova's Secret Invasion Issues that the Hulk's Death's Head units have been handed over to Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S. for study by a Dr Necker under her "Minion" Project. After Norman Osborn's H.A.M.M.E.R. forces come in to shut the facility down, it is revealed that Dr Necker is an A.I.M. double agent, setting up how Death's Head was in A.I.M. possession during the Death's Head 3.0 miniseries.

More recently, during the Enigma Force tie-in miniseries of the Incredible Hulks Dark Son arc, it was revealed that this model of Death's Head were built in the Microverse during a war with K'ai thousands of years ago. Sometime after the war some of the warships they were aboard were sucked through the Great Portal of Sakaar, which is said to breach time and space.

===Revolutionary War and all Death's Heads===
In 2014's ''Revolutionary War'', Death's Head II took a contract from Psycho-Wraith Prime to capture [[Captain Britain]] so that he could track where the villain's base was and find out if [[Mys-Tech]] were returning (and so he could have the money). When he was himself double-crossed and captured and handed to an earlier Evelyn Necker to be dissected, he sent a failsafe signal to Tuck to hire the earlier Death's Head—this one human-sized, rather than the Transformer-sized version in contemporary settings - and come to his rescue. ("Hrm. That's me? Bio-organic? Droopy horns? ''No cape?!'' You're right -- I really ''do'' need saving!") After a brief fight, the two of them tore through an army of Death's Head 3.0's but were defeated and the original Death's Head was captured &lt;ref name="Revolutionary War 2014"&gt;''Revolutionary War: Death's Head'' by Andy Lanning, Alan Cowsill and Nick Roche (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; to be used to create a portal to Hell. Both Death's Heads and Tuck fought against Mephisto's armies, gunning down the demonic [[Killpower]]. Afterwards, they departed to discuss the future.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The ''Death's Head'' one-shot had multiple references to the character's history and fan views: Necker controlled Death's Head II and sicced him on the original as in ''Death's Head II'' #1, only for the original to stab him through the head and remark "the past always catches up with you, yes?"; Necker decided on the name "Minion" after getting DH2 under control and told him she'd see him again in 2020; and both characters are dismissive of the Death's Head 3.0's sharing their name, remarking "you can't beat the ''real thing''".

In Iron Man's "Godkiller" story arc, an all new, all different Death's Head makes an appearance. It is similar to the original Death's Head in appearance except 30 feet tall.

'''Dr. Paxton Page''' was a scientist who perfected the cobalt bomb. He later went mad and faked his own kidnapping and death so that he could assume the guise of the villain '''Death's Head.''' He dressed in a glowing radioactive costume, riding a horse whose flesh was made transparent, and wielding fireballs and scimitars of radioactive cobalt. Page's daughter [[Karen Page|Karen]] returned to her parents' home to investigate her father's disappearance, and [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] followed her.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3390">[[Dinosaur]] and [[bird]] [[fossil]]s are frequently found in a characteristic posture consisting of head thrown back, tail extended, and mouth wide open.  The cause of this posture—sometimes called a "'''death pose'''"—has been a matter of scientific debate.  Traditional explanations ranged from strong [[ligament]]s in the animal's neck [[wikt:desiccating|desiccating]] and contracting to draw the body into the pose,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/dinosaurs/sauropod/deathpose.php&lt;/ref&gt; to [[water current]]s randomly arranging the remains in the position.&lt;ref&gt;http://sciencereview.berkeley.edu/articles.php?issue=14&amp;article=features03_fossils&lt;/ref&gt;  

Faux and Padian suggested in 2007 that the live animal was suffering [[opisthotonus]] during its [[wikt:death throes|death throes]], and that the pose is not the result of any post-mortem process at all. They also reject the idea of water as responsible for randomly arranging the bodies in a "death pose", as different parts of the body and the limbs can be in different directions, which they found unlikely to be the result of moving water.&lt;ref name="Faux2007"&gt;Padian K &amp; Faux M (2007), [http://paleobiol.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/33/2/201 "The opisthotonic posture of vertebrate skeletons: post-mortem contraction or death throes?"], ''Paleobiology'' '''33'''(2): p. 201-226.&lt;/ref&gt; They also found that the claim that drying out of ligaments would make the position does not seem believable either. 

Alicia Cutler and colleagues from Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, think it is related to water.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Switek. [https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn21207-watery-secret-of-the-dinosaur-death-pose.html Watery secret of the dinosaur death pose]. 23 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, paleontologists Achim G. Reisdorf and Michael Wuttke published a study regarding death poses. According to the conclusions of this study, the so-called "opisthotonic posture" is not the result of a cerebral illness creating muscle spasms, and also not of a rapid burial. Rather, [[peri-mortem]] [[wikt:submersion|submersion]] resulted in [[buoyancy]] that enabled the [[Ligamentum elasticum]] to pull the head and tail back. &lt;ref&gt;Reisdorf, A.G. &amp; Wuttke, M. (2012).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2764">{{Cambrian graphical timeline}} 
The '''Dresbachian''' is a [[Maentwrogian]] regional stage of North America, lasting from 501 to 497 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;https://engineering.purdue.edu/Stratigraphy/resources/geowhen/stages/Maentwrogian.html&lt;/ref&gt; It is part of the [[Upper Cambrian]] and is defined by four [[trilobite zone]]s. It overlaps with the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy|ICS]]-stages [[Guzhangian]], [[Paibian]] and the lowest [[Jiangshanian]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The '''Dresbachian''' overlies the Middle Cambrian [[Albertan]] series, and is the lowest stage of the Upper Cambrian [[Croixian]] series, followed by the [[Franconian (stage)|Franconian]] stage.  The '''Dresbachian extinction event''', about 502 million years ago, was followed by the [[Cambrian–Ordovician extinction event]] about {{Period start|Ordovician}} million years ago.

==Naming==
The term is derived from the town of [[Dresbach]] which is located in southeastern [[Minnesota]] on the [[Mississippi River]].

==Definition==
The Dresbachian is defined by four trilobite zones: ''[[Cedaria]]''-, ''[[Crepicephalus]]''-, ''[[Aphelaspis]]''- and ''[[Dunderbergia]]'' [[trilobite zone]]s.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

[[Image:Extinction Intensity.svg|thumb|450px|left|Intensity of Dresbachian extinction event (right side of graph)]]

==Events==
The Dresbachian extinction event during the [[Late Cambrian]] was the second of two severe [[extinction]]s during the first period of the [[Paleozoic era]]; the first being the [[End-Botomian extinction event]] during the [[Middle Cambrian]]. According to data on extinction intensity (see below), both [[extinction event]]s slashed approximately 40 percent of [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] [[genera]]. However, the two are poorly documented due to a paucity of [[fossil]] evidence so early in the [[evolution of life]].

'''Fernando Díaz de Mendoza y Guerrero''' (5 March 1897 – 27 September 1942) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] actor.&lt;ref name="GaldósGuerrero1984"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Benito Pérez Galdós|author2=María Guerrero|author3=Carmen Menéndez Onrubia|title=El dramaturgo y los actores: epistolario de Benito Pérez Galdós, María Guerrero y Fernando Díaz de Mendoza|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3mcO4u-vQrMC&amp;pg=PA303|year=1984|publisher=Editorial CSIC - CSIC Press|isbn=978-84-00-05860-9|page=303}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FDMsegunFAG&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/41321428|title=Luis Fernando Díaz de Mendoza Guerrero|author=José L Bernabé Tronchoni (compiler)|publisher="Find A Grave"|accessdate=23 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died when the ship on which he was travelling was sunk by a submarine.&lt;ref name=MonGorTor&gt;{{cite web|url= http://vidamaritima.com/2009/08/un-clamoroso-error-el-torpedeamiento-del-monte-gorbea/|title=Un Clamoroso Error: El torpedeamiento del Monte Gorbea|work=Vida Maritima|author=Manuel Rodriguez Aguilar|date=17 August 2009|accessdate=23 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Fernando Díaz de Mendoza y Guerrero was born on a Friday in [[Madrid]], into one of Spain's leading theatre families.&lt;ref name="GaldósGuerrero1984"/&gt;   His father was the actor-impresario [[Fernando Díaz de Mendoza y Aguado]] (1862-1930):  his mother, [[María Guerrero]], was a prominent actress and theatre director.   He was therefore steeped in theatrical interpretation, making his stage debut as a child, as did his younger brother, [[:es:Carlos Díaz de Mendoza|Carlos]].&lt;ref name=FDMsegunFAG/&gt;

Until his parents died, he was part of their company.   He was in the cast in works such as [[:es:Campo de armiño|"Campo de armiño" (''"Field of Ermine"'')]] (1916)&lt;ref name=ABC16021916&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1916/02/15/017.html|title=Notas Teatrales|publisher=[[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]], Madrid|date=15 February 1916|accessdate=23 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Los cachorros" (''"The Puppies"'') (1918), both by [[Jacinto Benavente]], [[:es:El último pecado|"El último pecado" (''"The Final Sin"'')]] (1918) by [[Pedro Muñoz Seca]], "[[Lady Windermere's Fan]]" (1920) by [[Oscar Wilde]], "El padre Juanico" (''"Father Juanico"'') (1922) by [[Àngel Guimerà]], "Don Luis Mejía" (1925) by [[Eduardo Marquina]], [[:es:El doncel romántico|"El doncel romántico" (''"The Romantic Gift"'')]] (1922), [[:es:La vidriera milagrosa|"La vidriera milagrosa" (''"The Miraculous Window"'')]] (1924) and [[:es:Doña Diabla|"Doña Diabla" (''"The She-Devil"'')]] (1925), the last three all by {{Interlanguage link multi|Luis Fernández Ardavín|es}}, along with [[:es:Desdichas de la fortuna o Julianillo Valcárcel|"Desdichas de la fortuna o Julianillo Valcárcel" (''"The Misfortunes of Julianillo Valcárcel"'')]] (1926) by [[Manuel Machado (poet and playwright)|the brothers]] [[Antonio Machado|Machado]].

He also worked with other theatre companies, for instance when he appeared in "El llanto" (''"The Crying"'') (1924) by [[Pedro Muñoz Seca]], with [[Emilio Thuillier]].

After his parents died, in 1928 and 1930, he continued to run the family theatre company with his (second) wife.

==Personal==
His first marriage took place in [[Bilbao]] on 27 August 1917&lt;ref name=ABC25081917&gt;{{cite web||url=http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1917/08/25/008.html|title=De Sociedad|date=25 August 1917||publisher=[[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]], Madrid||accessdate=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and was to María O'Donell y Díaz de Mendoza.&lt;ref name=MenGen/&gt;   She died two years later.

He later became involved with the actress Carola Fernán Gómez who gave birth to [[Fernando Fernán Gómez]], one of the most notable Spanish actors of the twentieth century.  Díaz de Mendoza y Guerrero never acknowledged his paternity in public, however.&lt;ref name=FFGsegunElPa&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elpais.com/diario/2007/11/23/cultura/1195772404_850215.html|title=La feroz María Guerrero y la saga familiar del cómico:  Fernán-Gómez fue el nieto no reconocido de la actriz|date=23 November 2007| author=Rosana Torres|publisher=El País| accessdate=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His second marriage took place in 1927 and was to his first cousin, the actress [[María Guerrero López]],&lt;ref name="García1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Manuel Gómez García|title=Diccionario Akal de Teatro|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gyvrmz5K2toC&amp;pg=PA385|date=2 January 1998|publisher=[[Ediciones Akal]]|isbn=978-84-460-0827-9|page=385}}&lt;/ref&gt; with whom he had two or three more children.&lt;ref name=MenGen&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.abcgenealogia.com/Font12.html|title=La descendencia de Mosén Juan Fontes y de doña Isabel de Albornoz y Roca Rocafull ...

Fernando Díaz de Mendoza y Guerrero died in the [[Atlantic Ocean]], roughly 60 km to the southwest of [[Martinique]].   The "Monte Gorbea" (as the "Arantza Mendi" was renamed in 1939) was a 20 year old multi-use cargo ship, with approximately 30 passenger cabins.   On 19 September 1942, travelling from [[Buenos Aires]] to [[Bilbao]] with a stopover for provisioning at [[Curaçao]], she was torpedoed by a German Submarine, identified as [[German submarine U-512|U-512]]. The boat was painted in neutral colours, but the German submarine captain became convinced that she was a British vessel disguised as a Spanish one.   After the attrocity the submarine was ordered back to German occupied France where the captain was to face a court martial, but it was sunk by an American air attack without ever getting back to Europe.   The "Monte Gorbea" carried a crew of 47, of whom 23 died when the ship was sunk.   There were also 23 passengers of whom 19 died.   Díaz de Mendoza was one of these.&lt;ref name=MonGorTor/&gt;

'''Horace Riverside Buck''' (September 18, 1853–December 6, 1897) was a Justice of the [[Montana Supreme Court]] in 1897, having died in office the same year that he joined the court.

==Early life and education==

In the ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' [[fantasy]] [[roleplaying game]], the '''invisible stalker''' is an [[Elemental (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|elemental]] creature from the [[Elemental Plane]] of Air.

==Publication history==
The invisible stalkers first appeared in the [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons (1974)|original ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' set]] (1974),&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Gygax|Gygax, Gary]], and [[Dave Arneson]]. ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons (1974)|Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' (3-Volume Set) (TSR, 1974)&lt;/ref&gt; and the supplement ''[[Eldritch Wizardry]]'' (1976).

The invisible stalker appeared in the ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons Expert Set|D&amp;D Expert Set]]'' (1981, 1983). The invisible stalker (sshai) appeared in the ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons Companion Set|Companion Rules]]'' (1984) and the ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons Rules Cyclopedia]]'' (1991).&lt;ref&gt;[[Aaron Allston|Allston, Aaron]], [[Steven Schend|Steven E. Schend]], [[Jon Pickens]], and [[Dori Watry]]. ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons Rules Cyclopedia]]'' (TSR, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

The invisible stalker appeared in first edition ''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' in the original ''[[Monster Manual]]'' (1977).&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Gygax|Gygax, Gary]]. ''[[Monster Manual]]'' (TSR, 1977)&lt;/ref&gt;

The invisible stalker appeared in second edition in ''[[Monstrous Compendium|Monstrous Compendium Volume One]]'' (1989),&lt;ref&gt;[[David "Zeb" Cook|Cook, David]], et al. ''[[Monstrous Compendium|Monstrous Compendium Volume One]]'' ([[TSR, Inc.|TSR]], 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; and reprinted in the ''[[Monstrous Manual]]'' (1993).&lt;ref&gt;[[Doug Stewart (game designer)|Stewart, Doug]], ed. ''[[Monstrous Manual]]'' (TSR, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

The invisible stalker appeared in the third edition ''[[Monster Manual]]'' (2000),&lt;ref&gt;[[Skip Williams|Williams, Skip]], [[Jonathan Tweet]], and [[Monte Cook]]. ''[[Monster Manual]]''. [[Wizards of the Coast]], 2000&lt;/ref&gt; and in the 3.5 revised ''Monster Manual'' (2003).

The invisible stalker appeared in the fifth edition ''[[Monster Manual]]'' (2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wizards RPG Team|title=Monster Manual|publisher=Wizards of the Coast|isbn=978-0786965618}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical description==
As its name obviously implies, an invisible stalker is invisible, resembling a completely see-through, completely silent, and highly undetectable and stealthy humanoid made of a wispy, shimmering essence.

Invisible stalkers have an amorphous form. A ''see invisibility'' spell only reveals a dim outline of a vaguely humanoid cloud, while a ''true seeing'' spell reveals a roiling cloud of vapor.

==Society==
Invisible stalkers live predominantly on the Elemental Plane of Air, but are sometimes summoned by mages to perform various tasks. A summoned invisible stalker does whatever task its master, the summoner, commands, even if the task sends it hundreds or thousands of miles away. It makes an ideal spy or assassin. The creature follows a command until it is completed and obeys only its summoner. It, however, resents protracted missions or complex tasks and seeks to pervert the instructions accordingly. 

While invisible stalkers can only speak Auran, they do understand Common. 

Invisible stalkers are usually [[Alignment (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)#Neutral|neutral]] in alignment, and could be regarded as good or evil if given a task or summoned by a master of such an alignment.

==Combat==
An invisible stalker uses stealth to attack. It sneaks up to the enemy and then creates a single blast of wind which pounds the enemy, intended to weaken it. Then it starts pummeling the opponent with its own strength. As the creature can remain invisible even in combat, fighting back against it is difficult. Invisible stalkers can only be killed on the Elemental Plane of Air; if they take enough damage to kill them elsewhere, they teleport back.

==Trivia==
*When it comes to a miniature of the invisible stalker, the developers of the ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons Miniatures'' game have often joked about using just the base with nothing on it, because the creature itself is invisible.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}
*Furthermore, the 2nd Edition picture of an invisible stalker was, in fact, a blank picture. This "picture" was credited as a joke to Doug Stewart and Tim Beach in the 2nd Edition ''Monstrous Manual'' book.
*An issue of the TSR ''[[Endless Quest]]'' book series, ''[[Return to Brookmere]]'', features an early depiction of an invisible stalker named Mazahs (art by Timothy Truman), who could turn himself visible at will. In his visible form, Mazahs was shown as a solid-bodied humanoid creature with two arms, four spindly legs (with an arrangement resembling an ant's rather than a centaur's), pointed ears and a large nose, wearing earrings and a curly-pointed cap.
*While it does not appear in [[Editions of Dungeons &amp; Dragons#Dungeons &amp; Dragons 4th edition|fourth edition]], the invisible stalker serves as the namesake for a level 22 utility power for the rogue's thief archetype.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mearls|first1=Mike|last2=Slavicsek|first2=Bill|last3=Thompson|first3=Rodney|title=Heroes of the Fallen Lands|date=September 21, 2010|publisher=Wizards of the Coast|isbn=978-0786956203|page=190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Joseph Parle''' (May 26, 1920 &amp;ndash; July 10, 1943) was a [[United States Naval Reserve]] officer and a recipient of the United States military's highest decoration—the [[Medal of Honor]]—for his actions in [[World War II]]. Parle was a 1942 ROTC graduate of [[Creighton University]] in Omaha, Nebraska.

On July 9, 1943, Parle was serving as an [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]] and was involved in the preparations for the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]]. On that day, he noticed a fire aboard a small boat loaded with explosives and ammunition. Knowing that an explosion would alert the defenders on Sicily of the impending invasion, he rushed to put out the fire. Although successful in dousing the flames, he later died of smoke inhalation.

Parle, aged 23 at his death, was buried at the Holy Sepulchre Cemetery in his birth city of [[Omaha, Nebraska]].

==Medal of Honor citation==
Ensign Parle's official Medal of Honor citation reads:
&lt;blockquote&gt;For valor and courage above and beyond the call of duty as Officer-in-Charge of Small Boats in the {{USS|LST-375}} during the amphibious assault on the island of Sicily, 9–10 July 1943. Realizing that a detonation of explosives would prematurely disclose to the enemy the assault about to be carried out, and with full knowledge of the peril involved, Ens. Parle unhesitatingly risked his life to extinguish a smoke pot accidentally ignited in a boat carrying charges of high explosives, detonating fuses and ammunition. Undaunted by fire and blinding smoke, he entered the craft, quickly snuffed out a burning fuse, and after failing in his desperate efforts to extinguish the fire pot, finally seized it with both hands and threw it over the side. Although he succumbed a week later from smoke and fumes inhaled, Ens. Parle's heroic self-sacrifice prevented grave damage to the ship and personnel and insured the security of a vital mission. He gallantly gave his life in the service of his country.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On May 28, 2016, a three-year-old boy climbed into a gorilla enclosure at the [[Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden]] and was grabbed and dragged by [[#Background|Harambe]], a 17-year-old [[Western lowland gorilla]]. Fearing for the boy's life, a zoo worker shot and killed Harambe. The incident was recorded on video and received broad international coverage and commentary, including controversy over the choice to kill Harambe. A number of [[primatologist]]s and conservationists wrote later that the zoo had no other choice under the circumstances, and that it highlighted the danger of zoo animals in close proximity to humans and the need for better standards of care.

On May 28, 2016, a three-year-old boy visiting the Cincinnati Zoo fell into the moat at the Gorilla World habitat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/06/us/harambe-gorilla-death-investigation/ |title=Gorilla killing: 3-year-old boy's mother won't be charged |date=June 6, 2016 |publisher=CNN |accessdate=August 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="howboygotin" /&gt; Witnesses said they heard the child say he wanted to go into the gorilla enclosure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/mum-boy-who-fell-gorilla-8080846 |title=Mum of boy who fell into gorilla zoo enclosure blasts critics saying 'accidents happen' |work=Mirror |author=John Shammas |date=May 30, 2016 |accessdate=June 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boy then climbed a {{convert|3|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} fence, crawled through {{convert|4|ft}} of bushes, and then fell {{convert|15|ft}} into a moat of shallow water. Zoo officials immediately signaled for the three gorillas in the habitat to return inside, and two females did so. However, the third gorilla, the inquisitive 440 pound male [[Gorilla#Social structure|silverback]], Harambe, climbed down into the moat to investigate the child splashing in the water.&lt;ref name="howboygotin" /&gt;

Over the next 10 minutes, Harambe became increasingly "agitated and disoriented" by the screams of onlookers.&lt;ref name="hall"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/opinion/opinion-la/la-ol-gorilla-killing-20160531-snap-story.html |title=Lesson of the Cincinnati gorilla killing: The zoo is not a playground |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |first=Carla |last=Hall |date=May 31, 2016 |accessdate=June 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="angier" /&gt; He dragged the child through the water, occasionally propping him up when he sat, or pushing him down when he stood.&lt;ref name="hall" /&gt; Harambe exhibited "strutting" behavior—walking around with legs and arms stiffly extended to appear bigger—a bluffing move, though one with inherent danger should he throw or drag the boy around too roughly.&lt;ref name="angier" /&gt; Harambe then carried the boy up a ladder out of the moat onto dry land. Afraid for the boy's life, zoo officials made the decision to kill the gorilla, doing so with a single rifle shot. Cincinnati firefighters said the boy was between Harambe's legs when the shot was fired.&lt;ref name="howboygotin"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2016/05/29/boy-who-fell-into-zoo-gorilla-exhibit-out-hospital/85131108/ |title=How boy got into gorilla enclosure |work=USA Today |publisher=Cincinnati.com |first=Cameron |last=Knight |date=June 1, 2016 |accessdate=June 20, 2016 |quote=a 3-year-old boy dropped into the Gorilla World exhibit}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harambe was killed one day after his 17th birthday.&lt;ref name="hall" /&gt;

This section of the [[list of rampage killers]] contains mass murders, committed by [[Lone wolf (terrorism)|lone wolf perpetrators]], that have a foremost [[fundamentalism|religious]], [[racism|racial]] or political background.

A rampage killer has been defined as follows:
{{quote|A rampage involves the (attempted) killing of multiple persons least partly in public space by a single physically present perpetrator using (potentially) deadly weapons in a single event without any cooling-off period.&lt;ref&gt;Seeger, Thorsten (ed.) School Shootings: International Research, Case Studies, and Concepts for Prevention; Springer, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
This list should contain every case with at least one of the following features:
* Rampage killings with 6 or more dead 
* Rampage killings with at least 4 people killed and least ten victims overall (dead plus injured)
* Rampage killings with at least 2 people killed and least 12 victims overall (dead plus injured)
* An incidence of rampage killing shall not be included in this list if it does not include at least two people killed.
* In all cases the perpetrator(s) are not counted among those killed or injured.

All abbreviations used in the table are explained [[#Abbreviations and footnotes|below]]. &lt;!--Additions should be made 1) in order of # of fatalities, and 2) # injured--&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''Megaguirus'''|メガギラス|Megagirasu|lead=yes}} is a [[kaiju]] who first appeared in [[Toho]]'s 2000 film ''[[Godzilla vs. Megaguirus]]''. A mutated version of the fictional [[Meganulon]], Megaguirus is regarded as the queen of the species; according to [[Toho]], she is 50 meters (164 feet) long, has a wingspan of 80 meters (262 feet) and weighs 12,000 metric tons (13,227 short tons). The first and only major appearance of the creature was in the 2000 film ''[[Godzilla vs. Megaguirus]]'', she also had a brief cameo appearance in ''[[Godzilla: Final Wars]]'' from 2004.

==Overview==
Although the species of Meganulon, the origin of Megaguirus, were first depicted in the 1956 movie ''[[Rodan (film)|Rodan]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Toho Kingdom|year=2010|accessdate=November 1, 2010|title=Rodan|url=http://www.tohokingdom.com/movies/rodan.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; the monster itself did not appear until its debut in 2000.&lt;ref name="TohoKingdom"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Toho Kingdom|year=2010|accessdate=November 1, 2010|title=Megaguirus|url=http://www.tohokingdom.com/kaiju/megaguirus.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Megaguirus was first mentioned in the movie ''Godzilla vs. Megaguirus'' after a swarm of Meganulon absorbed energy from [[Godzilla]] and quickly fled to a flooded section of [[Tokyo]].&lt;ref name="GodzillavMegaguirus"/&gt; After diving into the flood waters, the entire swarm latched on to an enormous, mutated version of Meganulon. This mutated creature, regarded as the queen, begins to [[Moulting|molt]] once enough energy had been obtained. After leaving behind her [[exoskeleton]], Megaguirus rose above the water's surface and entered the skies of Tokyo.&lt;ref name="GodzillavMegaguirus"/&gt;

Immediately after getting above water, Megaguirus began her rampage across Tokyo, destroying numerous buildings by creating supersonic shock waves with her wings. The Japanese military, already deployed to the city to assist in evacuating residents caught in the flood, was helpless to stop Megaguirus. In addition to being practically immune to bullets, her wings emitted a piercing buzz which forced people to stop what they were doing and cover their ears in pain. Before leaving the city, the creature leveled a skyscraper and caused a chain reaction of explosions in several other buildings near where she was born.&lt;ref name="GodzillavMegaguirus"/&gt; Several days later, Megaguirus returned to Tokyo in pursuit of Godzilla.&lt;ref name="TohoKingdom"/&gt;

Moments before Megaguirus's second arrival in Tokyo, the G-Graspers, a legion of anti-Godzilla soldiers in the Japan Self Defense Unit, attempts to take down Godzilla "once and for all." However, Megaguirus interrupts this and begins a lengthy duel with Godzilla. Initially, Megaguirus takes Godzilla by surprise, using her speed to avoid Godzilla's attacks, including his atomic breath, as well as knock him over multiple times. Eventually, Megaguirus grabs onto Godzilla's neck with her vice-like claws. Although Godzilla breaks free of the grasp and begins to charge up his atomic breath, Megaguirus jabs Godzilla with her stinger and begins absorbing energy, preventing Godzilla from using his atomic breath while giving more power to Megaguirus.&lt;ref name="GodzillavMegaguirus"/&gt;

Megaguirus uses her newly obtained energy to pick Godzilla up and throw him into a building. Once Godzilla recovers, Megaguirus again stabs him with her stinger, but this time, Godzilla grabs Megaguirus's tail and slams it into the ground and follows through by tackling her. Shortly thereafter, Megaguirus uses the absorbed energy to launch an "atomic blast" which causes Godzilla to collapse. Seemingly having defeated Godzilla, Megaguirus goes in for the kill, but just as she makes her move, Godzilla quickly gets up and bites off Megaguirus's stinger. Stunned, Megaguirus floats backwards from Godzilla, only to be set aflame by his atomic breath. To ensure his victory, Godzilla hits Megaguirus again, causing her to explode into a ball of fire before the burning remains fell to the ground and exploded for a final time.&lt;ref name="GodzillavMegaguirus"/&gt;

===Abilities===
Similar to nearly every monster in the Godzilla series, Megaguirus was at one point exposed to radioactive materials, resulting in a substantial increase in strength, speed and size. After obtaining energy from the minor Meganulon, Megaguirus is able to fly at incredibly fast speeds, up to [[Mach number|mach 4]]. It is able to flap its dragonfly-like wings at super-sonic speeds,&lt;ref name="TohoKingdom"/&gt; creating shock waves that can destroy buildings.&lt;ref name="GodzillavMegaguirus"&gt;{{cite video | people=Masaaki Tezuka (Director) | date=December 16, 2000 | accessdate=November 1, 2010 | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0255198/ | title=Gojira tai Megagirasu: Jî shômetsu sakusen | language=Japanese | medium=Motion picture | location=Japan | publisher=Hiroshi Kashiwabara and Wataru Mimura}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its enlarged tail works similar to the stinger of a [[scorpion]], it jabs its foe and latches on to it. Once the stinger is in Megaguirus's opponent, it can either absorb energy for itself or release a blast of energy composed of its opponent's beam weapon. Additionally, while flying, its wings cause electronic disturbances.&lt;ref name="TohoKingdom"/&gt;

In 2017, the [[Ringo Award]] was created and it was named after Wieringo to honor people in the comic book industry; it is presented at the [[Baltimore Comic-Con]].

==Early life==
Mike Wieringo became interested in comics through his father, who was an avid reader. Wieringo began drawing comics when he was 11. He studied [[fashion illustration]] at [[Virginia Commonwealth University]], though he began to consider drawing comics as a profession, and showed his artwork at comics convention during his college years. Soon after graduating, he determined that that field was "dying out". Realizing that he did not possess the fortitude for commercial illustration, he decided to draw comic books.&lt;ref name=Wizard&gt;''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' #41 (January 1995). pp 123-124.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Early work===
Wieringo's first professionally published work was ''[[Doc Savage]]: Doom Dynasty #1'', published by [[Millennium Publications]] in 1991. Editor [[Mark Ellis (American author)|Mark Ellis]] had to overrule his partner to give the fledgling artist his first assignment.

Wieringo took his samples to the 1992 [[San Diego Comic Con]], where he met [[DC Comics]] group editor of creative services [[Neil Pozner]], who showed Wieringo's art to other DC editors. He was eventually given his first work, a story in ''[[Justice League Quarterly]]'' #11. That was followed by a second ''JLQ'' in issue #12.&lt;ref name=Wizard/&gt;

===The Flash===
[[File:Flash97.jpg|left|thumb|''[[Flash (comics)|The Flash]]'' vol. 2 #97 (Jan. 1995), with Bart Allen (Impulse) second from left. Cover by Wieringo.]]
''[[The Flash (comic book)|The Flash]]'' editor [[Brian Augustyn]] asked Wieringo to try out for ''The Flash''. After submitting some sample pages of the Flash running, Wieringo was offered the penciling duties on Volume 2 of that series, on which he was paired with writer [[Mark Waid]], and on which he rose to prominence in the industry, drawing all but two issues from #80–92 (Early Sept. 1993–July 1994), plus #0 (Oct. 1994).&lt;ref name=Wizard/&gt; He additionally penciled covers through #100, #118–124, and 128–129, and for ''The Flash 80-Page Giant'' #2 (April 1999).&lt;ref name="GCD"&gt;{{gcdb|type=credit|search=Mike+Wieringo|title=Mike Wieringo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wieringo and Waid co-created the young speedster [[Bart Allen]], a.k.a. Impulse, in ''The Flash'' vol. 2 #91 (cameo) and #92 (first full appearance).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Manning|first= Matthew K.|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1990s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|year=2010|location= London, United Kingdom|isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9|page= 265|quote = The brainchild of writer Mark Waid and artist Mike Wieringo, Impulse burst onto the scene at quite a pace.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wieringo followed this with a short run on ''[[Robin (comics)|Robin]]'', another DC title, with writer [[Chuck Dixon]], while concurrently penciling [[Marvel Comics]]' ''[[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]]'' #1–4 (Jan.–April 1995),&lt;ref name=Wizard/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Manning|first = Matthew K.|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1990s|title = Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year= 2008|location= London, United Kingdom|page = 272|isbn =978-0756641238|quote= Rogue finally starred in her own four-issue miniseries, beginning in January [1995]. Written by Howard Mackie with art by Mike Wieringo.}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[miniseries]] starring that [[X-Men]] superheroine.&lt;ref name="GCD" /&gt; During this period, he also penciled occasional covers and small miscellaneous jobs for Marvel Comics.

Other work around this time included penciling the cover and co-penciling (with [[Rob Haynes]]) the lead story of ''[[Firearm (comics)|Firearm]]'' #0 (Nov. 1993) and penciling the back cover and one story in ''[[Godwheel]]'' #2 (Feb. 1995) for [[Malibu Comics]]. He penciled the cover of ''Explorers'' #2 (1995) for [[Explorer Press]].&lt;ref name="GCD" /&gt;

===Marvel and ''Tellos''===
[[File:Tellos2.jpg|thumb|Promotional art for ''[[Tellos]]'' #1 (May 1999), by Wieringo.]]
After having penciled the ''[[Spider-Boy]]'' #1 (April 1996) one-shot, which combined [[Spider-Man]] and [[Superboy]] as part of the [[Marvel Comics]]–[[DC Comics]] [[intercompany crossover]] series of [[one-shot (comics)|one-shots]] [[Amalgam Comics]],&lt;ref&gt;Manning "1990s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 279&lt;/ref&gt; Wieringo became the regular artist on Marvel's ''[[The Sensational Spider-Man]]'', beginning with issue #8 (September 1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Cowsill|first = Alan|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1990s|title = Spider-Man Chronicle Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2012|location= London, United Kingdom|page = 228|isbn = 978-0756692360|quote= It seemed that a whole host of bad guys were on a crime spree in this adventure, written by Todd Dezago and illustrated by the series' new regular artist Mike Wieringo.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teaming with writer [[Todd Dezago]], Wieringo penciled all but eight issues from #8–31 (September 1996&amp;nbsp;– October 1998), and some covers on issues he did not pencil. Additionally, Wieringo co-plotted several issues and penciled the quirkily numbered [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] issue, #&amp;nbsp;−1 (July 1997). During his run he signed a two–year contract with Marvel, beginning December 1997.

After ''Spider-Man'', Wieringo's next major project was at [[Image Comics]], where he reteamed with Dezago on their [[creator ownership|creator-owned]] fantasy series ''[[Tellos]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lambiek.net/artists/w/wieringo_mike.htm|title= Mike Wieringo|year= 2013|publisher= [[Lambiek|Lambiek Comiclopedia]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120910035939/http://www.lambiek.net/artists/w/wieringo_mike.htm|archivedate= September 10, 2012|deadurl= no|accessdate= December 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The comic, a coming-of-age adventure set in a magical, [[pirate|piratical]] world, ran 10 issues (May 1999–November 2000). The last three issues were released by [[Gorilla Comics]], a short-lived Image imprint co-founded by Wieringo and several other creators in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sequentialtart.com/archive/may00/dezago.shtml |title=Tell Us About ''Tellos'' |first=Jennifer M. |last=Contino |date=May 2000 |publisher=Sequentialtart.com |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6MF730BTr?url=http://www.sequentialtart.com/archive/may00/dezago.shtml |archivedate=December 30, 2013 |deadurl=no |accessdate=April 25, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archives.tcj.com/234/n_gorilla.html |title=The Case of the Disappearing Gorilla: The Banana Trust Explains How Not to Start a Comics Line |first=Michael |last=Dean |date=June 8, 2001 |location=Seattle, Washington |work=[[The Comics Journal]] ''#234'' |publisher=[[Fantagraphics Books]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65v9TM63v?url=http://archives.tcj.com/234/n_gorilla.html |archivedate=March 4, 2012 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=March 4, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the demise of the series, Wieringo also penciled one 13–page story in a post-series [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]], ''Tellos: Maiden Voyage'' #1 (March 2001).

Wieringo returned to DC Comics for all but one issue of ''[[Superman (comic book)|The Adventures of Superman]]'' #592–600 (July 2001&amp;nbsp;– March 2002), with writer [[Joe Casey]].&lt;ref&gt;Cowsill, Alan "2000s" in Dolan, p. 305: "To celebrate the 600th issue of ''The Adventures of Superman'', the Man of Steel had a super-sized anniversary issue pitting him against Lex Luthor...With a script by Joe Casey and art by Mike Wieringo."&lt;/ref&gt; He then returned to Marvel and reunited with writer [[Mark Waid]] on ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four]]''. Beginning with #60 (October 2002), Wieringo eventually drew 27 issues of Waid's 36 issues, wrapping up their run with #524, by which time the previously relaunched series had returned to its original numbering. The comics-hobbyist [[webzine]] [[Newsarama]] commented that the Waid–Wieringo run "was perhaps best known for fan outcry when Marvel announced that [it was] going to replace the team. Marvel quickly reversed [its] decision, and the two completed their run on the series".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.newsarama.com/Chicago_07/Ringo.html|title= Mike Wieringo Passes Away|first= Matt|last= Brady|date= n.d.|publisher= [[Newsarama]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070820232546/http://www.newsarama.com/Chicago_07/Ringo.html|archivedate= August 20, 2007|deadurl= yes|accessdate= August 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wieringo penciled the interior art on issues #1–5 and #8–10 of ''[[Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man]]''&lt;ref&gt;Cowsill "2000s" in Gilbert (2012), p. 295: "In December [2005], a new regular Spidey series began...Written by Peter David and illustrated by Mike Wieringo."&lt;/ref&gt; and was the cover artist of #1–19 (December 2005&amp;nbsp;– June 2007). He and writer [[Jeff Parker (cartoonist)|Jeff Parker]] began work on the [[miniseries]] ''Spider-Man and the Fantastic Four'' in April 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Cowsill "2000s" in Gilbert (2012), p. 305: "Spider-Man teamed up with the Fantastic Four...in this four-part series by writer Jeff Parker and artist Mike Wieringo."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==
Wieringo explained the philosophy behind his drawing style thus: "I just try to keep things fun. I like to do fun comics. It doesn't have to be realistic to be believable. In fact, I sometimes think that funny [material] might actually add something to certain books." When he began illustrating the ''Rogue'' miniseries, he was intimidated by the dark tone of that book's story, but once he finished the first issue, the editors decided to light up the "grim and gritty" tone of the story.&lt;ref name=Wizard/&gt;

==Death and legacy==
On August 12, 2007, Wieringo died of an [[aortic dissection]] at his home in [[Durham, North Carolina]], at age 44.&lt;ref name="death" /&gt; He was survived by his parents, Cecil and Shirley Dean Wieringo, and his brother Matt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.heraldsun.com/obituaries/obit08162007.cfml#49089|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070927000151/http://www.heraldsun.com/obituaries/obit08162007.cfml|dead-url= yes|archive-date= 2007-09-27|title= Obituaries|date= n.d.|location= Durham, North Carolina|publisher= ''[[The Herald-Sun (Durham, North Carolina)|The Herald-Sun]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--if/when this link goes out, the newspaper cite is ''The Herald-Sun'', although the paper's online site did not give a date for when obit was published in the print edition. An obit that confirmed Durham but did not list his family was published August 15, 2007, in ''The News &amp; Observer'' (Raleigh-Durham) at http://www.legacy.com/newsobserver/Obituaries.asp?Page=Lifestory&amp;PersonId=92666980 --&gt;

[[Mirage Comics]]' ''Tales Of TMNT'' #40, [[Image Comics]]' ''[[Elephantmen]]'' #11 and ''[[The Walking Dead (comics)|The Walking Dead]]'' #42, and [[Marvel Comics]]' ''Spider-Man: Family'' #7 were dedicated to his memory.

At the time of his death, Wieringo had completed seven pages of a ''[[What If (comics)|What If?]]'' story featuring the temporary [[List of Fantastic Four members#New Fantastic Four|"replacement" Fantastic Four]] of [[Spider-Man]], [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], and [[Ghost Rider]] that had originally been assembled in a 1990 three-part ''Fantastic Four'' storyline. Marvel Comics donated the script and Wieringo's art to The Hero Initiative, a charity dedicated to assisting [[Golden Age of Comics|Golden Age]] and [[Silver Age of Comics|Silver Age]] comics creators who retired without pensions or benefits and require financial assistance. Wieringo's colleagues stepped in to complete the story. The completed 48-page book, ''What If?—The Fantastic Four Tribute to Mike Wieringo'', features, in addition to Wieringo's art, artwork by [[Art Adams|Arthur Adams]], [[Paul Renaud]], [[Stuart Immonen]], [[Cully Hamner]], [[Alan Davis]], David Williams, Sanford Greene, [[Humberto Ramos]], [[Skottie Young]], [[Mike Allred]], and [[Barry Kitson]], and was released in June 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Biggers, Cliff; Rogers, Vaneta; Batty, Ward; ''[[Comic Shop News]]'' #1086; April 2008; Page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cowsill "2000s" in Gilbert (2012), p. 313: "Talented artist Mike Wieringo's sudden death in August 2007 had stunned the comic community. A total of 12 top artists...joined forces to finish Wieringo's last work, a ''What If?'' story written by Jeff Parker."&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017, the [[Baltimore Comic-Con]] announced the creation of the [[Mike Wieringo Comic Book Industry Awards]] (the "Ringo Awards"), to be held annually at Baltimore Comic-Con beginning in September 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.bleedingcool.com/2017/06/16/ringo-awards-named-mike-wieringo-replace-harvey-awards-baltimore-comic-con/|title= he Ringo Awards – Named After Mike Wieringo – To Replace Harvey Awards At Baltimore Comic Con|first= Rich|last= Johnston|authorlink= Rich Johnston|date= June 16, 2017|publisher= [[Bleeding Cool]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20171203153818/https://www.bleedingcool.com/2017/06/16/ringo-awards-named-mike-wieringo-replace-harvey-awards-baltimore-comic-con/|archivedate= December 3, 2017|deadurl= no|df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mozambique tilapia''' (''Oreochromis mossambicus'') is a [[tilapiine]] [[cichlid]] fish native to southern Africa. It is a popular fish for [[aquaculture]].  Dull colored, the Mozambique tilapia often lives up to a decade in its native habitats.  Due to human [[Introduced species|introductions]], it is now found in many tropical and subtropical habitats around the globe, where it can become an [[invasive species]] because of its robust nature. These same features make it a good species for aquaculture because it readily adapts to new situations.  It is known as '''black tilapia''' in [[Colombia]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parquesnacionales.gov.co/portal/especies-exoticas-con-potencial-invasor/listado-oficial-de-especies-invasoras-para-colombia/&lt;/ref&gt; and as '''blue kurper''' in [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bigbass.0catch.com/id8a.htm Big Bass]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

The native Mozambique tilapia is laterally compressed, and has a deep body with long dorsal fins, the front part of which have spines. Native coloration is a dull greenish or yellowish, and weak banding may be seen. Adults reach approximately {{convert|35|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length and up to {{convert|1.13|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. Size and coloration may vary in captive and naturalized populations due to environmental and breeding pressures. It lives  up to 11 years.

It is a remarkably robust and fecund fish, readily adapting to available food sources and breeding under suboptimal conditions. It also tolerates brackish water and survives temperatures below {{convert|50|F|C}} and above {{convert|100|F|C}}, but sustained water temperatures of 55°F are lethal to Mozambique tilapia.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

==Distribution==
[[File:Mozambique tilapia preserved for lab purposes.jpg|thumbnail|left|preserved for lab purposes.]]
The Mozambique tilapia is native to coastal regions and the lower reaches of rivers in southern Africa, from the [[Zambezi River]] delta to [[Bushman River]] in the eastern Cape.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.issg.org/database/species/ecology.asp?si=131&lt;/ref&gt;  It is threatened in its home range by competition with the invasive [[Nile tilapia]].&lt;ref&gt;Waal 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diet==
Mozambique tilapia are omnivorous.  They can consume detrital material, diatoms, invertebrates, small fry and vegetation ranging from macroalgae to rooted plants.&lt;ref&gt;Mook 1983&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trewevas 1983&lt;/ref&gt; This broad diet helps the species thrive in diverse locations.

==Invasiveness==
The Mozambique tilapia is an [[invasive species]] in many parts of the world, having escaped from aquaculture or been deliberately introduced to control mosquitoes.&lt;ref&gt;Moyle 1976&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been nominated by the Invasive Species Specialist Group  as one of the 100 worst invasive species in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Courtenay 1989&lt;/ref&gt;  It can harm native fish populations through competition for food and nesting space, as well as by directly consuming small fish.&lt;ref&gt;Courtenay et al. 1974&lt;/ref&gt;  In Hawaii, striped mullet ''[[Mugil cephalus]]'' are threatened because of the introduction of this species. Mozambique tilapia may also be responsible for the decline of the desert pupfish, ''[[Cyprinodon macularius]]'', in California's [[Salton Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;Courtenay and Robins 1989&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Swift et al. 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hybridization==
As with most species of tilapia, Mozambique tilapia have a high potential for [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]].  They are often crossbred with other tilapia species in aquaculture because purebred Mozambique tilapia grow slowly and have a body shape poorly suited to cutting large [[fillet (cut)|fillet]]s.  Also, hybrids between certain parent combinations (such as between Mozambique and [[Wami tilapia]]) result in offspring that are all or predominantly male. Male tilapia are preferred in aquaculture as they grow faster and have a more uniform adult size than females. The "Florida Red" tilapia is a popular commercial hybrid of Mozambique and [[blue tilapia]].&lt;ref&gt;http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/FA012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feeding behavior and environment==
Although Mozambique tilapias generally live in [[rivers]] and [[lagoons]], they can also colonize fast-flowing areas of water such as creeks and [[streams]].  Due to their robust nature, Mozambique tilapias often over-colonize the habitat around them, eventually becoming the most abundant species in a particular area.  When over-crowding happens and resources get scarce, adults will sometimes [[cannibalize]] the young for more nutrients.  Mozambique tilapia, like other fish such as [[Nile tilapia]] and [[trout]], are opportunistic [[omnivores]] and will feed on [[algae]], plant matter, organic particles, small invertebrates and other fish.&lt;ref name=Factsheet&gt;{{cite web|title=Biology and ecology of Mozambique tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus)|url=http://www.feral.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/TILFS3_web.pdf|publisher=feral.org.au|accessdate=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Feeding patterns vary depending on which food source is the most abundant and the most accessible at the time.  In captivity, Mozambique tilapias have been known to learn how to feed themselves using demand feeders.  During commercial feeding, the fish may energetically jump out of the water for food.&lt;ref name="Online Guide"&gt;{{cite web|last=De Peaza|first=Mia|title=Oreochromis mossambicus (Mozambique Tilapia)|url=http://sta.uwi.edu/fst/lifesciences/documents/Oreochromis_mossambicus.pdf|publisher=UWI|accessdate=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social structure==
Mozambique tilapias often travel in groups where a strict [[dominance hierarchy]] is maintained.  Positions within the hierarchy correlate with territoriality, courtship rate, nest size, aggression, and hormone production.&lt;ref name="Social Modulation"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oliveira|first=Rui F.|author2=Vitor C. Almada |author3=Adelino V. M. Canario |title=Social Modulation of Sex Steroid Concentrations in the Urine of Male Cichlid Fish Oreochromis mossambicus|journal=Hormones and Behavior|year=1996|volume=30|pages=2–12|doi=10.1006/hbeh.1996.0002|pmid=8724173}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In terms of social structure, Mozambique tilapias engage in a system known as [[lek mating|lek-breeding]], where males establish territories with dominance hierarchies while females travel between them.  Social hierarchies typically develop because of competition for limited resources including food, territories, or mates.  During the breeding season, males cluster around certain territory, forming a dense aggregation in shallow water.&lt;ref name=Outcome&gt;{{cite journal|last=Amorim|first=M. Clara P.|author2=Almada, Vitor C.|title=The outcome of male–male encounters affects subsequent sound production during courtship in the cichlid fish Oreochromis mossambicus|journal=Animal Behaviour|date=1 March 2005|volume=69|issue=3|pages=595–601|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2004.06.016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This aggregation forms the basis of the [[lek mating|lek]] through which the females preferentially choose their mates.  Reproductive success by males within the lek is highly correlated to social status and dominance.&lt;ref name=Sterol&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barata|first=Eduardo N.|author2=Fine, Jared M. |author3=Hubbard, Peter C. |author4=Almeida, Olinda G. |author5=Frade, Pedro |author6=Sorensen, Peter W. |author7= Canário, Adelino V. M. |title=A Sterol-Like Odorant in the Urine of Mozambique Tilapia Males Likely Signals Social Dominance to Females|journal=Journal of Chemical Ecology|date=1 April 2008|volume=34|issue=4|pages=438–449|doi=10.1007/s10886-008-9458-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
In experiments with captive tilapias, evidence demonstrates the formation of linear hierarchies where the alpha male participates in significantly more agonistic interactions.  Thus, males that are higher ranked initiate much more aggressive acts than subordinate males.  However, contrary to popular belief, Mozambique tilapias display more [[agonistic behaviour|agonistic interactions]] towards fish that are farther apart in the hierarchy scale than they do towards individuals closer in rank.  One hypothesis behind this action rests with the fact that aggressive actions are costly.  In this context, members of this social system tend to avoid confrontations with neighboring ranks in order to conserve resources rather than engage in an unclear and risky fight.  Instead, dominant individuals seek to bully subordinate tilapias both for an easy fight and to keep their rank.&lt;ref name=Dominance&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oliveira|first=R.F.|author2=V.C. Almada|title=Dominance hierarchies and social structure in captive groups of the Mozambique tilapia Oreochromis mossambicus (Teleostei Cichlidae)|journal=Ethology Ecology &amp; Evolution|year=1996|volume=8|pages=39–55|doi=10.1080/08927014.1996.9522934}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Communication and aggression==
Urine in Mozambique tilapias, like many freshwater fish species, acts as a vector for communication amongst individuals.  Hormones and [[pheromones]] released with urine by the fish often affect the behavior and physiology of the opposite sex.  Dominant males signal females through the use of a urinary odorant.  Further studies have suggested that females respond to the ratio of chemicals within the urine, as opposed to the odor itself.  Nevertheless, females are known to be able to distinguish between hierarchical rank and dominant vs. subordinate males through chemicals in urine.

Urinary pheromones also play a part in male – male interaction for Mozambique tilapias.  Studies have shown that male aggression is highly correlated with increased urination.  Symmetrical aggression between males resulted in an increase in the release of urination frequency.  Dominant males both store and release more potent urine during [[agonistic behaviour|agonistic interactions]].  Thus, both the initial stage of lek formation and the maintenance of social hierarchy may highly depend on the males’ varying urinary output.&lt;ref name="Male urine"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barata|first=Eduardo N|author2=Hubbard, Peter C |author3=Almeida, Olinda G |author4=Miranda, António |author5= Canário, Adelino VM |title=Male urine signals social rank in the Mozambique tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus)|journal=BMC Biology|date=1 January 2007|volume=5|issue=1|pages=54|doi=10.1186/1741-7007-5-54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aggression amongst males usually involve a typical sequence of visual, acoustic, and tactile signals that eventually escalates to physical confrontation if no resolution is reached.  Usually, conflict ends before physical aggression as fights are both costly and risky.  Bodily damage may impede an individual’s ability to find a mate in the future.  In order to prevent cheating, in which individual may fake his own fitness, these aggressive rituals incur significant energetic costs.  Thus, cheating is prevented by the sheer fact that the costs of initiating a ritual often outweigh the benefits of cheating.  In this regard, differences between individuals in endurance plays a critical role in resolving the winner and the loser.&lt;ref name=Aggressive&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ros|first=Albert F.H.|author2=Klaus Becker |author3=Rui F. Oliveira |title=Aggressive behaviour and energy metabolism in a cichlid fish, Oreochromis mossambicus|journal=Physiology &amp; Behavior|date=30 May 2006|pages=164–70|doi=10.1016/j.physbeh.2006.05.043 |volume=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reproduction==
In the first step in the reproductive cycle for Mozambique tilapia, males excavate a nest into which a female can lay her eggs. After the eggs are laid, the male [[external fertilization|fertilizes]] them. Then the female stores the eggs in her mouth until the fry hatch; this act is called [[mouthbrooding]].&lt;ref name="Popma, 1999"&gt;Popma, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the main reasons behind the aggressive actions of Mozambique tilapias is access to reproductive mates.  The designation of Mozambique tilapias as an invasive species rests on their life-history traits:  Tilapias exhibit high levels of parental care as well as the capacity to spawn multiple [[offspring|broods]] through an extended reproductive season, both contributing to their success in varying environments.&lt;ref name=Reproductive&gt;{{cite journal|last=Russell|first=D. J.|author2=Thuesen, P. A. |author3=Thomson, F. E. |title=Reproductive strategies of two invasive tilapia species Oreochromis mossambicus and Tilapia mariae in northern Australia|journal=Journal of Fish Biology|date=1 May 2012|volume=80|issue=6|pages=2176–2197|doi=10.1111/j.1095-8649.2012.03267.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[Lek mating|lek system]], males congregate and display themselves to attract females for matings.  Thus, mating success is highly skewed towards dominant males, who tend to be larger, more aggressive, and more effective at defending territories.  Dominant males also build larger nests for the [[spawn (biology)|spawn]].&lt;ref name="Outcome"/&gt;  During courtship rituals, acoustic communication is widely used by the males to attract females.  Studies have shown that females are attracted to dominant males who produce lower peak frequencies as well as higher pulse rates.  At the end of mating, males guard the nest while females take both the eggs and the sperm into their mouth.  Due to this, Mozambique tilapias can occupy many niches during spawning since the young can be transported in the mouth.&lt;ref name=Sound&gt;{{cite journal|last=Amorim|first=M. C. P.|author2=Fonseca, P. J. |author3=Almada, V. C. |title=Sound production during courtship and spawning of Oreochromis mossambicus: male-female and male-male interactions|journal=Journal of Fish Biology|date=1 March 2003|volume=62|issue=3|pages=658–672|doi=10.1046/j.1095-8649.2003.00054.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;   These proficient reproductive strategies may be the cause behind their invasive tendencies.

Male Mozambique tilapias synchronize breeding behavior in terms of [[Courtship display|courtship]] activity and territoriality in order to take advantage of female spawning synchrony.  One of the costs associated with this synchronization is the increase in competition among males, which are already high on the [[dominance hierarchy]].  As a result, different mating tactics have evolved in these species.  Males may [[mimic]] females and sneak reproduction attempts when the dominant male is occupied.  Likewise, another strategy for males is to exist as a floater, travelling between territories in an attempt to find a mate.  Nevertheless, it is the dominant males who have the greatest reproductive advantage.&lt;ref name="Mating tactics"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oliveira|first=R. F.|author2=Almada, V. C.|title=Mating tactics and male-male courtship in the lek-breeding cichlid Oreochromis mossambicus|journal=Journal of Fish Biology|date=1 June 1998|volume=52|issue=6|pages=1115–1129|doi=10.1111/j.1095-8649.1998.tb00959.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parental care==

Typically, Mozambique tilapias, like all species belonging to the ''[[Oreochromis]]'' genus and species like ''[[Astatotilapia burtoni]]'', are maternal mouthbrooders, meaning that spawn is incubated and raised in the mouth of the mother.  [[Parental care]] is, therefore, almost exclusive to the female.  Males do contribute by providing nests for the spawn before incubation, but the energy costs associated with nest production is low relative to mouthbrooding.  Compared to nonmouthbrooders,  both mouthbrooding and growing a new clutch of eggs is not energetically feasible.  Thus, Mozambique tilapias arrest [[oocyte]] growth during [[mouthbrooder|mouthbrooding]] to conserve energy.&lt;ref name=Steroid&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Carol Johnson|author2=Haley, Samuel R.|title=Steroid profiles of the female tilapia, Oreochromis mossambicus, and correlation with oocyte growth and mouthbrooding behavior|journal=General and Comparative Endocrinology|date=1 January 1988|volume=69|issue=1|pages=88–98|doi=10.1016/0016-6480(88)90056-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Even with oocyte arrest, females that mouthbrood take significant costs in body weight, energy, and low fitness.  Hence, parental-offspring conflict is visible through the costs and benefits to the parents and the young.  A mother caring for her offspring carries the cost of reducing her own individual fitness.  Unlike most fish, Mozambique tilapias exhibit an extended maternal care period believed to allow social bonds to be formed.&lt;ref name=Preferential&gt;{{cite journal|last=Russock|first=Howard I.|title=Preferential Behaviour of Sarotherodon (Oreochromis) mossambicus (Pisces: Cichlidae) Fry to Maternal Models and Its Relevance to the Concept of Imprinting|journal=Behaviour|date=March 1986|volume=96|issue=3/4|pages=304–321|doi=10.1163/156853986x00531}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in aquaculture==
[[File:Tilapia mossambica Pune.JPG|thumb|right|250px|A Mozambique tilapia caught in a man-made lake, where it naturally occurs along with species introduced for aquaculture in [[Pune]], India]]
Mozambique tilapia are hardy individuals that are easy to raise and harvest, making them a good aquacultural species. They have a mild, white flesh that is appealing to consumers. This species constitutes about 4% of the total tilapia aquaculture production worldwide, but is more commonly hybridized with other tilapia species.&lt;ref&gt;Gupta and Acosta 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Tilapia are very susceptible to diseases such as [[whirling disease]] and [[Ichthyophthirius multifiliis|ich]].&lt;ref name="Popma, 1999"/&gt; Mozambique tilapia are resistant to wide varieties of water quality issues and pollution levels. Because of these abilities they have been used as bioassay organisms to generate metal toxicity data for risk assessments of local freshwater species in [[South Africa]] rivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mashifane|first1=TB|last2=Moyo|first2=NAG|title=Acute toxicity of selected heavy metals to                            ''Oreochromis mossambicus'' fry and fingerlings|journal=African Journal of Aquatic Science|date=29 October 2014|volume=39|issue=3|pages=279–285|doi=10.2989/16085914.2014.960358|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.2989/16085914.2014.960358#.VJpqQCGDQA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other names==
The species is known by a number of other names including:

* [http://sains.me/281/mbah-moedjair-penemu-ikan-mujair-yang-mendunia.html/ ''Mujair''] in Indonesia 
* ''Oreochromis andersonii

The ''''Neopets TCG'''' is a [[collectible card game]] and a spin-off of the popular [[virtual pet]] website, [[Neopets]]. Launched in 2003, this game is produced by [[Wizards of the Coast]], a large [[Trading card game|trading card]] company that produces a variety of other trading card games.  Neopets is aimed at a slightly younger audience than other Wizards of the Coast offerings such as ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]''.&lt;ref name="DUMMIES"&gt;{{cite book|title=Trading Card Games For Dummies|series=For Dummies|last1=Kaufeld|first1=John|last2=Smith|first2=Jeremy|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|year=2006|isbn=0470044071|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As with many other trading card games, there are two purposes to the trading cards; the first to collect the cards, and the second to play a devised game using the cards.

The card game was discontinued in 2006.

==Gameplay overview==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Neopets Red Bori.jpg|right|Neopets card front]] --&gt;
''Neopets TCG'' is a two player game, where each player has a play deck of at least 40 cards and a separate deck of at least 10 Basic Neopets.  Most deck-building articles suggest a limit of 2-3 species for the Basic Neopets, along with a minimum of 20 Item and/or Equipment cards (essentially half of the deck).{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} Each card may have only 3 copies included. Players start with a single Neopet on the first turn, moving up to three by the third turn.  These Neopets compete against opposing Neopets in four different arenas: Strength, [[Agility]], [[Intelligence]], and [[Witchcraft|Magic]].  Winning a competition during a player's own turn allows the player to bank or draw a card; banking enough cards of sufficient value eventually leads to victory.

==Types of cards==
The various Neopets cards are divided into categories that affect gameplay in different ways. The different card types are as follows:

* Basic Neopet
* Experienced Neopet
* Item
* Equipment
* Hero
* Villain
* Something Has Happened!
* Location
* Fate (Curse and Quest)
* Constellation

===Basic Neopet (Yellow)===
The Basic Neopet cards are the foundation of the game, and are based upon fictional Neopets taken from the [http://www.neopets.com Neopets website], including the species and color of the Neopet.  The cards list four abilities or attributes, which are: strength, agility, intelligence, and magic.  Each of these is given a value, with a higher number denoting a greater power or skill in a given category.  Basic Neopets never have a printed score higher than 10, or lower than 1.

===Experienced Neopet (Grey)===
The Experienced Neopet is much like an evolved [[Pokémon]] in the ''[[Pokémon Trading Card Game]]''.  An Experienced Neopet has higher attributes, and often has helpful side effects that influence various part of the game. The Experienced Neopet cards consists of a Neopet species, and an adjective describing that Neopet's advanced occupation, e.g. Jubjub Engineer.  However, only Neopets of the matching base species can transform into the Experienced Neopet role, so, for example, only a Jubjub could turn into a Jubjub Engineer, while a Mynci could not.

===Item &amp; Equipment (Red and Blue)===
Item and Equipment cards both increase a Neopet's abilities, by adding points onto the printed base number in one or more categories, and frequently have certain side effects that affect game play.  Whereas Items can only be used once before being discarded, Equipment is attached to the Neopet and remains there until removed by another card.  The advantage to Items is that can be sprung upon an opponent unexpectedly.

Item and Equipment cards are also the only cards worth points, ranging from 0 to 8.  A player needs to "bank" 21 points worth of Items and Equipment cards to win the game.

===Hero &amp; Villain (White and Black)===
Villain cards and Hero cards both have extremely high ability numbers, and are designed to oppose one another.  If a villain is played, the arena in which the villain is located is effectively sealed off until the villain is confronted and beaten, until which point the players cannot start contests against their opponent in that arena, only the villain. A Hero card can be used to fight a difficult battle (often against a villain), but can be used only once before being discarded.

===Something Has Happened! (Purple)===
Something Has Happened! cards usually cause a one-time, instantaneous event or effect to occur.  These cards often are used to influence the outcome of a battle, and are then discarded.  Because one can discover that "Something has Happened!" at virtually any time, such cards can introduce a heavy element of surprise.

===Location (Green)===
Location cards can be played in one area to affect all future battles taking place there (until replaced by another Location).  The Location can give an advantage to a certain kind of Neopet, or can cause some side effect to any battles occurring there.  Location cards are typically based upon fantasy locations on the Neopets website.

===Fate (orange)===
Fate cards are divided into two sub-categories: Curse and Quest. Curses are usually played on a Neopet belonging to the opponent, and have a negative or detrimental effect on that Neopet.  Because Curse cards typically remain in play, they can cripple a given Neopet's ability to perform effectively.  Quest cards affect all parts of the game, and are (usually) neutral.

===Constellation===
Constellation cards represent star constellations in the sky which impact play in some way.  For example, a given Constellation might confer an additional power to the Neopets in play, or otherwise might change the game in some fashion. Wizards of the Coast has not given any official ruling as to the rules regarding constellations, but popular rule sets online (most notably in player-created "guilds" on the Neopets web site) considered them similar to Magic's enchantments.

==Expansions==
The ''Neopets Trading Card Game'' has seen a series of expansions, with each release including new cards and in many cases, new categories of cards. Only three Neopets species did not make it into the TCG, as produced by Wizards of the Coast: Gnorbu, Ogrin, and Xweetok. Checklists can be accessed if you have a Neopets user account.

=== [[Base set]] ===
The first ''Neopets'' card set was simply an introductory 234-card set, with no prevailing theme whatsoever.  This set introduced the card types Basic Neopet, Experienced Neopet, Hero, Villain, Item, Equipment, and "Something Has Happened!". The Basic Neopet types that were introduced were Aishas, Korbats, Myncis, Scorchios, Shoyrus, [[Kacheeks]], Acaras, Lupes, Wockies, Poogles, Eyries, and Grarrls.

===''Battle For Meridell''===
This expansion's release was coordinated with an online plot/war, which was set in the virtual [[Feudalism|feudal]]-themed land of Meridell. Thus, the 140 cards in this set were designed with a [[Middle Ages]]-like style.  This expansion introduced ten new species of Neopets, (Basic Type: Blumaroo, Draik, Gelert, Ixi, Meerca, Quiggle, Skeith, Uni, Usul, and Zafara) in addition to the Location card type.

===''The Return of Sloth''===
Intending to be tied into an online plot, this set was released in 2004 &amp; the online tie-in was delayed until early 2008 due to workload.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Neopian Museum: The Return of Dr. Sloth|url=http://www.jellyneo.net/?go=plotsummary_trods|website=Jellyneo|publisher=Dreamhost|accessdate=9 July 2014|ref=TRODS|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714174434/http://www.jellyneo.net/?go=plotsummary_trods|archivedate=14 July 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This set totaled 100 cards. This expansion's theme was space, providing players with futuristic and robotic items and equipment.  Six new Neopet species made their debut in this expansion. (Basic Type: Cybunny, Grundo, Jetsam, Jubjub, and Kougra)

===''Mystery Island''===
Based upon a tropical island locale, this 100-card expansion provided no new card types, but did introduce four new Neopet species, including the Pteri and Techo. (other Basic Type: Krawk and Peophin) The related plot was the Secret of the Volcano mystery plot in Fall 2003, but the plot and the expansion were not released together.

===''Hannah and the Ice Caves''===
Revolving around a central popular game character known as Hannah the Usul, a substantial plot was released on the Neopets website along with this 150-card set; it was also the first set to have "secret" cards (5 Jelly cards 151/150-Jelly Poogle, 152/150-Jelly Shoyru, 153/150-Jelly World, 154/150-Jelly Puppyblew, and 155/150-Orange Jelly). The locale for this expansion, released in October 2004, was a wintry, icy environment.  A game is also based upon the plot of this expansion of the same name, and is currently online at the Neopets website. This expansion introduced the Basic Neopets known as the Bori, and the Bruce. (other Basic Type: Elephante, Flotsam, Kyrii, and Moehog) One new card type was released: Fates.

===''Curse of Maraqua''===
This 120-card expansion revolved around the underwater city of Maraqua, which was rebuilt during the plot of the same name on the Neopets website. Four new Neopet species were released with this set, including the Yurble. (other Basic Type: Chomby, Lenny, and Tuskaninny)

===''Lost Desert''===
This 100-card expansion took players to the shifting sands of the Lost Desert. Basic Neopets released in this expansion are the Ruki, the Kau, and the Tonu. Site-wise, there was a plot and war revolving around this expansion.

=== ''[[The Darkest Faerie]]'' ===
This 150-card expansion (with 5 secret cards)featured several cards relating to the [[PlayStation 2]] game, including several familiar characters from previous sets.  The most notable of these were the Darkest Faerie, the Dark Faerie Sisters, and the Werelupe King.  This expansion also introduced another new type of card, the Constellation. (Basic Type: Buzz, Koi, Nimmo) Oddly, this expansion was absent of any Fates.

Secret cards: 151- Amulet fo Thilg, 152- Bewitched Ring, 153- Fyora, Tower Guardian, 154- The Hidden Tower, 155- Wand of Ultanova,

===''Travels in Neopia''===
This ''Neopets'' card "expansion" is actually a re-packaging of 200 cards from previous card sets.  This includes favorite cards, as well as Neopets from each and every known Neopet species; 3 exceptions from the list of 54- Gnorbu, Ogrin, and Xweetok. (introduced Basic Type: Hissi, Kiko, and Lutari) Only one color for each Basic species was included. The general theme of this set is about encouraging fans to re-live past plots, or, for those new to ''Neopets'', catch them up with some of the more well known aspects of the series. There was barely any publicity at all related to this expansion.

===''The Haunted Woods''===
The newest expansion, featuring 100 cards with a spooky theme.  Cards are related to [[ghost]]s, [[Werewolf|werewolves]], and [[zombie]]s, among others.  This deck is associated with the plot, Tale of Woe; where a village has fallen under a curse, and only the Neopets can determine what happened to the townsfolk.  There are no new Basic Type cards, although they did fill out the basic 4 colors for the Lenny and Tonu. Special color versions are included for Acara, Aisha, Cybunny, and Korbat. As with previous recent releases, this release appears to be being done with a minimum of publicity. This is the last expansion produced by Wizards of the Coast.

==''Hubrid's Hero Heist''==
A game was created to tie in with the TCG, the game was named ''Hubrid's Hero Heist''. It features several Neopian heroes being captured by Hubrid Nox and the player, as the Poogle Apprentice, is to save these heroes. The heroes which the player saves are, in order of saving, Magnus the Torch, Jeran, Master Vex, Illusen, Jerdana, and finally, Fyora the Faerie Queen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=371386&amp;week=316 | title=Your Friendly Walkthrough to Hubrid's Hero Heist | publisher=Neopian Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Health sciences knowledge bases are currently diverse, with intellectual foundations which are sometimes mutually-inconsistent.

A '''polyphenic trait''' is a trait for which multiple, discrete [[phenotype]]s can arise from a single [[genotype]] as a result of differing environmental conditions. It is therefore a special case of [[phenotypic plasticity]].

There are several types of polyphenism in animals, from having sex determined by the environment to the castes of honey bees and other social insects. Some polyphenisms are seasonal, as in some butterflies which have different patterns during the year, and some Arctic animals like the [[snowshoe hare]] and [[Arctic fox]], which are white in winter. Other animals have predator-induced or resource polyphenisms, allowing them to exploit variations in their environment. Some nematode worms can develop either into adults or into resting [[dauer larva]]e according to resource availability.

==Definition==
[[file:Termites polymorphism.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Polyphenism in [[termite]]s&lt;br /&gt;
    A : Primary king &lt;br /&gt;
    B : Primary queen &lt;br /&gt;
    C : Secondary queen &lt;br /&gt;
    D : Tertiary queen &lt;br /&gt;
    E : Soldiers &lt;br /&gt;
    F : Worker]]

A '''polyphenism''' is a biological mechanism that causes a trait to be polyphenic. For example, [[crocodile]]s possess a sex-determining polyphenism, and therefore their gender is a polyphenic trait.&lt;ref name="Woodward"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rspb.1993.0059 |title=On the Effect of Temperature-Dependent Sex Determination on Sex Ratio and Survivorship in Crocodilians |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=252 |issue=1334 |pages=149–155 |year=1993 |last1=Woodward |first1=D. E |last2=Murray |first2=J. D. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When polyphenic forms exist at the same time in the same [[panmictic]] (interbreeding) population they can be compared to [[polymorphism (biology)|genetic polymorphism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ford,  E. B. |authorlink=E. B. Ford |date=1975 |title=Ecological genetics |edition=4th |publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall |pages= }}{{page needed|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; With polyphenism the switch between morphs is environmental, but with genetic polymorphism the determination of morph is genetic. These two cases have in common that more than one morph is part of the population at any one time. This is rather different from cases where one morph predictably follows another during, for instance, the course of a year. In essence the latter is normal [[ontogeny]] where young forms can and do have different forms, colours and habits to adults.

The discrete nature of polyphenic traits differentiates them from traits like weight and height, which are also dependent on environmental conditions but vary continuously across a spectrum. When a polyphenism is present, an environmental cue causes the organism to develop along a separate pathway, resulting in distinct morphologies; thus, the response to the environmental cue is “all or nothing.” The nature of these environmental conditions varies greatly, and includes seasonal cues like temperature and moisture, [[pheromone|pheromonal]] cues, [[kairomone|kairomonal]] cues (signals released from one species that can be recognized by another), and nutritional cues.

==Types==

===Sex determination===
Sex-determining polyphenisms allow a species to benefit from [[sexual reproduction]] while permitting an unequal [[gender]] ratio. This can be beneficial to a species because a large female-to-male ratio maximizes reproductive capacity. However, temperature-dependent sex determination (as seen in crocodiles) limits the range in which a species can exist, and makes the species susceptible to endangerment by changes in weather pattern.&lt;ref name="Woodward" /&gt; Temperature-dependent sex determination has been proposed as an explanation for the extinction of the dinosaurs.&lt;ref name=Gilbert2003&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gilbert |first1=S.F. |year=2003 |title=Developmental Biology |edition=7th |location=Sunderland, Massachusetts |publisher=Sinauer Associates |pages=727–737}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Population-dependent and reversible sex determination, found in animals such as the [[blue wrasse]] fish, have less potential for failure. In the blue wrasse, only one male is found in a given territory: [[larva]]e within the territory develop into females, and adult males will not enter the same territory. If a male dies, one of the females in his territory becomes male, replacing him.&lt;ref name=Gilbert2003/&gt; While this system ensures that there will always be a mating couple when two animals of the same species are present, it could potentially decrease genetic variance in a population, for example if the females remain in a single male's territory.

===Insect castes===
[[File:Closeup on honeypot ants (Myrmecocystus mimicus) at Oakland Zoo.jpg|thumb|Insect castes: Replete and worker honeypot ants ''[[Myrmecocystus mimicus]]'']]

The caste system of insects enables [[eusociality]], the division of labor between non-breeding and breeding individuals. A series of polyphenisms determines whether larvae develop into queens, workers, and, in some cases soldiers. In the case of the [[ant]], ''P. morrisi'', an embryo must develop under certain temperature and photoperiod conditions in order to become a reproductively-active queen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1071468 |pmid=12114626 |title=Evolution of the Gene Network Underlying Wing Polyphenism in Ants |journal=Science |volume=297 |issue=5579 |pages=249–52 |year=2002 |last1=Abouheif |first1=E. |last2=Wray |first2=G. A. }}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows for control of the mating season but, like sex determination, limits the spread of the species into certain [[climate]]s.
In bees, [[royal jelly]] provided by [[worker bee]]s causes a developing larva to become a [[queen bee|queen]]. Royal jelly is only produced when the queen is aging or has died. This system is less subject to influence by environmental conditions, yet prevents unnecessary production of queens.

===Seasonal===&lt;!-- [[Seasonal polyphenism]] redirects here --&gt;
{{further|Snow camouflage}}

Polyphenic [[biological pigment|pigmentation]] is adaptive for insect species that undergo multiple mating seasons each year. Different pigmentation patterns provide appropriate [[camouflage]] throughout the seasons, as well as alter heat retention as temperatures change.&lt;ref name="Braendle2006"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/bies.20456 |pmid=16937342 |title=A role for genetic accommodation in evolution? |journal=BioEssays |volume=28 |issue=9 |pages=868–73 |year=2006 |last1=Braendle |first1=Christian |last2=Flatt |first2=Thomas }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because insects cease growth and development after [[eclosion]], their pigment pattern is invariable in adulthood: thus, a polyphenic pigment adaptation would be less valuable for species whose adult form survives longer than one year.&lt;ref name=Gilbert2003/&gt;

Birds and mammals are capable of continued physiological changes in adulthood, and some display reversible seasonal polyphenisms, such as in the [[Arctic fox]], which becomes all white in winter as [[snow camouflage]].&lt;ref name=Gilbert2003/&gt;

===Predator-induced===
Predator-induced polyphenisms allow the species to develop in a more reproductively-successful way in a [[predator]]'s absence, but to otherwise assume a more defensible morphology. However, this can fail if the predator evolves to stop producing the [[kairomone]] to which the prey responds. For example, the fly larvae that feed on ''Daphnia cucullata'' (a [[water flea]]) release a kairomone that ''Daphnia'' can detect. When the fly larvae are present, ''Daphnia'' grow large helmets that protect them from being eaten. However, when the predator is absent, ''Daphnia'' have smaller heads and are therefore more agile swimmers.&lt;ref name=Gilbert2003/&gt;

===Resource===
Organisms with resource polyphenisms show alternative phenotypes that allow differential use of food or other resources. One example is the [[Spea|western spadefoot toad]], which maximizes its reproductive capacity in temporary [[desert]] ponds. While the water is at a safe level, the tadpoles develop slowly on a diet of other opportunistic pond inhabitants. However, when the water level is low and desiccation is imminent, the tadpoles develop a morphology (wide mouth, strong jaw) that permits them to cannibalize. Cannibalistic tadpoles receive better nutrition and thus metamorphose more quickly, avoiding death as the pond dries up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00442-004-1672-6 |pmid=15300488 |title=Reassessment of the environmental mechanisms controlling developmental polyphenism in spadefoot toad tadpoles |journal=Oecologia |volume=141 |issue=3 |pages=402–10 |year=2004 |last1=Storz |first1=Brian L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among [[invertebrates]], the nematode ''[[Pristionchus pacificus]]'' has one morph that primarily feeds on bacteria and a second morph that produces large teeth, enabling it to feed on other nematodes, including competitors for bacterial food. In this species, cues of starvation and crowding by other nematodes, as sensed by pheromones, trigger a [[hormone|hormonal]] signal that ultimately activates a developmental switch gene that specifies formation of the predatory morph.&lt;ref name="Ragsdale2013"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2013.09.054 |pmid=24209628 |title=A Developmental Switch Coupled to the Evolution of Plasticity Acts through a Sulfatase |journal=Cell |volume=155 |issue=4 |pages=922–33 |year=2013 |last1=Ragsdale |first1=Erik J. |last2=Müller |first2=Manuela R. |last3=Rödelsperger |first3=Christian |last4=Sommer |first4=Ralf J. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Density-dependent ===
Density-dependent polyphenism allows species to show a different phenotype based on the population density in which it was reared. In [[Lepidoptera]], [[African armyworm]] larvae exhibit one of two appearances: the gregarious or solitary phase. Under crowded or "gregarious" conditions, the larvae have black bodies and yellow stripes along their bodies. However, under solitary conditions, they have green bodies with a brown stripe down their backs. The different phenotypes emerge during the third instar and remain until the last instar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1570-7458.1998.00273.x |title=The determination of larval phase coloration in the African armyworm, Spodoptera exempta and its consequences for thermoregulation and protection from UV light |journal=Entomologia Experimentalis et Applicata |volume=86 |issue=2 |pages=125–33 |year=1998 |last1=Gunn |first1=A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dauer diapause in nematodes===
[[File:Third stage Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita.png|thumb|Third stage [[dauer larva]] (resting stage) of ''[[Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita]]'']]

Under conditions of stress such as crowding and high temperature, L2 larvae of some free living nematodes such as ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'' can switch development to the so-called [[dauer larva]] state, instead of going the normal molts into a reproductive adult. These dauer larvae are a stress-resistant, non-feeding, long-lived stage, enabling the animals to survive harsh conditions. On return to favorable conditions, the animal resumes reproductive development from L3 stage onwards.

==Evolution==
A mechanism has been proposed for the [[evolution]]ary development of polyphenisms:&lt;ref name="Braendle2006" /&gt;

#A mutation results in a novel, heritable trait.
#The trait’s frequency expands in the population, creating a population on which selection can act.
#Pre-existing (background) genetic variation in other genes results in phenotypic differences in expression of the new trait.
#These phenotypic differences undergo selection; as genotypic differences narrow, the trait becomes:
##Genetically fixed (non-responsive to environmental conditions)
##Polyphenic (responsive to environmental conditions)

Evolution of novel polyphenisms through this mechanism has been demonstrated in the laboratory. Suzuki and Nijhout used an existing mutation (''black'') in a monophenic green hornworm (''[[Manduca sexta]]'') that causes a black phenotype. They found that if larvae from an existing population of ''black'' mutants were raised at 20˚C, then all the final [[instar]] larvae were black; but if the larvae were instead raised at 28˚C, the final instar larvae ranged in color from black to green. By selecting for larvae that were black if raised at 20˚C but green if raised at 28˚C, they produced a polyphenic strain after thirteen generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1118888 |pmid=16456077 |title=Evolution of a Polyphenism by Genetic Accommodation |journal=Science |volume=311 |issue=5761 |pages=650–2 |year=2006 |last1=Suzuki |first1=Y |last2=Nijhout |first2=H. F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This fits the model described above because a new mutation (black) was required to reveal pre-existing genetic variation and to permit selection. Furthermore, the production of a polyphenic strain was only possible because of background variation within the species: two alleles, one temperature-sensitive and one stable, were present for a single gene upstream of ''black'' (in the pigment production pathway) before selection occurred. The temperature-sensitive allele was not observable because at high temperatures, it caused an increase in green pigment in hornworms that were already bright green. However, introduction of the black mutant caused the temperature-dependent changes in pigment production to become obvious. The researchers could then select for larvae with the temperature-sensitive [[allele]], resulting in a polyphenism.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

'''Siah Albison''' (born about 1840) was a professional [[Great Britain|British]] [[running|runner]] who set a  [[World record progression for the mile run|world record in the mile]] in the 1860s.

A weaver from Bow Lee near [[Manchester]], Albison earned the mile championship belt of England in 1859. The belt was a creation of Copenhagen Grounds proprietor [[Tommy Hayes (promoter)|Tommy Hayes]] who had earlier declared [[Thomas Horspool]] "English champion" in the era before [[athletics (sport)|athletics]] organizations standardised events and championships. When Horspool retired from running shortly after setting a world record in the mile in 1858, Hayes sought out new talent to fill the stands.

On 27 October 1860, he arranged a race between Albison and [[William Lang (British athlete)|William Lang]]. Held at the Copenhagen Grounds in [[Manchester]], Albison prevailed by a little more than a yard in 4:22{{frac|1|4}}, a new world record.

From 1860 to about 1865, Albison raced at the Copenhagen Grounds and at other Manchester race venues, such as the City Grounds and the Royal Oak Grounds, drawing thousands. He was regularly challenged by Lang, their first rematch coming in March 1861, a race won by Albison. He won four more challenge races in 1861 and 1862, and over-all won seven of eight championship races.

His mile record was surpassed by Lang in 1863, and he finished in sixth place when Lang and [[William Richards (runner)|William Richards]] set a joint world record of 4:17{{frac|1|4}} on 19 August 1865, a record which would stand for nearly 16 years.

In [[geometry]], the '''order-3 snub heptagonal tiling''' is a semiregular tiling of the hyperbolic plane. There are four [[triangle]]s, one [[heptagon]] on each [[vertex (geometry)|vertex]]. It has [[Schläfli symbol]] of ''sr{7,3}''.  The [[snub tetraheptagonal tiling]] is another related hyperbolic tiling with Schläfli symbol ''sr{7,4}''.

== Dual tiling ==

The dual tiling is called an ''order-7-3 floret pentagonal tiling'', and is related to the [[floret pentagonal tiling]].
:[[Image:Ord7 3 floret penta til.png|250px]]

== Related polyhedra and tilings ==
This semiregular tiling is a member of a sequence of [[Snub (geometry)|snubbed]] polyhedra and tilings with vertex figure (3.3.3.3.''n'') and [[Coxeter–Dynkin diagram]] {{CDD|node_h|n|node_h|3|node_h}}. These figures and their duals have (n32) rotational [[Orbifold notation|symmetry]], being in the Euclidean plane for n=6, and hyperbolic plane for any higher n. The series can be considered to begin with n=2, with one set of faces degenerated into [[digon]]s.
{{Snub table}}

From a [[Wythoff construction]] there are eight hyperbolic [[Uniform tilings in hyperbolic plane|uniform tilings]] that can be based from the regular heptagonal tiling. 

Drawing the tiles colored as red on the original faces, yellow at the original vertices, and blue along the original edges, there are 8 forms.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3606">A '''spome ''' is any [[hypothesis|hypothetical]] system closed with respect to matter and open with respect to energy capable of sustaining human life indefinitely.  The term was coined in 1966 by [[Isaac Asimov]] in a paper entitled "There’s No Place Like Spome", published in Atmosphere in Space Cabins and Closed Environments&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.locusmag.com/index/yr2000/s3.htm Atmosphere in Space Cabins and Closed Environments]&lt;/ref&gt; and originally presented as a paper to the American Chemical Society on September 13, 1965. Asimov himself declared his coined word to be ''uneuphonious'' (not pleasant to the ear), and defined it as being a [[portmanteau]] of the two words "space home".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Asimov|first=Isaac|title=Is Anyone There?|year=1967|publisher=Ace Books|location=N.Y., N.Y.|isbn=9780441374168|pages=261 &amp; 280}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Definition==
Asimov described how energy flows through a life-support system from a low [[entropy|entropic]] state from which it moves all material resources, such as air, water, and food with the rejection of low-grade heat as the final energy output.  The concept reflects the dynamics of [[ecosystem ecology]] as described by [[Howard T. Odum]].

The term applies to any life-support system from submarines to spaceships, and includes the operation of the Earth's own biosphere.

The word "spome" was also referenced in a reprint of Asimov's original article in "Is anyone there?", 1967 by Doubleday, Ash.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ff-asimov.ifrance.com/ess-t.html Isaac Asimov bibliography]&lt;/ref&gt; He surmised that an asteroid could be "spomified" by being hollowed out and equipped suitably for long term, sustainable flight.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.att.net/~m.standridge/anobib.htm M. Standridge, annotated bibliography]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buckminster Fuller===
[[Buckminster Fuller]] called the concept of a spome "an astronaut's black box", meaning that the necessities of life were supplied through the absorption of energy to cycle material resources and eject heat from the system. Fuller's institute is furthering this concept through understanding of the Earth's comprehensive life support system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.panacea-bocaf.org/buckminsterfuller.htm PANACEA - Building our children a future]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gerard O'Neill===
[[Gerard K. O'Neill]] does not acknowledge the term "spome", but writes about the concept in ''[[The High Frontier: Human Colonies in Space]]''.  Asimov's concept predates and exceeds O’Neill’s by using a propulsion system with a Spome to allow  development of the solar system, and then leaving to populate the galaxy over eons.

===Dandridge Cole===
Engineer [[Dandridge MacFarlan Cole|Dandridge Cole]] in the 1960s called these settlements, "Macro-Life".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfsite.com/fsf/2000/ben0002.htm "A Scientist's Notebook", by Gregory Benford and George Zebrowski]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The World Without Us''''' is a [[non-fiction]] book about what would happen to the [[natural environment|natural]] and [[built environment]] if humans suddenly disappeared, written by American journalist [[Alan Weisman]] and published by [[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Thomas Dunne Books]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Weisman |first=Alan |authorlink=Alan Weisman |title=The World Without Us |date=2007-07-10 |publisher=Thomas Dunne Books/St. Martin's Press |location=New York |isbn=0-312-34729-4 |oclc=122261590}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a book-length expansion of Weisman's own February 2005 ''[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]]'' article "Earth Without People".&lt;ref name=EWP&gt;{{Citation |last=Weisman |first=Alan |author-link=Alan Weisman |publication-date=February 2005 |title=Earth Without People |periodical=Discover Magazine |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=60–65 |url=http://discovermagazine.com/2005/feb/earth-without-people/ |accessdate=2007-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Written largely as a [[thought experiment]], it outlines, for example, how cities and houses would deteriorate, how long man-made artifacts would last, and how remaining lifeforms would evolve. Weisman concludes that residential neighborhoods would become forests within 500 years, and that radioactive waste, [[bronze]] statues, [[plastics]], and [[Mount Rushmore]] would be among the longest-lasting evidence of human presence on Earth.

The author of four previous books and numerous articles for magazines, Weisman traveled to interview academics, scientists and other authorities. He used quotations from these interviews to explain the effects of the natural environment and to substantiate predictions. The book has been translated and published in many countries. It was successful in the U.S., reaching #6 on the [[New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Seller list]]&lt;ref name=NYTBSsept9&gt;{{Citation|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/09/books/bestseller/0909besthardnonfiction.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090423212726/http://www.nytimes.com/glogin?URI=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/09/books/bestseller/0909besthardnonfiction.html&amp;OQ=_rQ3D2Q26orefQ3Dslogin&amp;OP=6d9c2618Q2FQ23(Q2B,Q23Q51i8!_iihNQ23NQ3CQ3CQ5EQ23Q3CQ26Q23Q3CQ26Q23,ii0!Q23,Q2B!h!Q2BvvQ2B_Q23Q3CQ26Q3CQ26,Q2B!hYM_Q514i4Q5Dm8hmi4DYhjv |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-04-23 |title=Best Sellers: Hardcover Nonfiction |accessdate=2007-11-02 |date=2007-09-09 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and #1 on the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' Best-Sellers list in September 2007.&lt;ref name=SFC&gt;{{Citation |url= http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/09/23/RV0SS7TK4.DTL&amp;hw=world+without+us&amp;sn=004&amp;sc=995 |title=San Francisco Chronicle Best-Sellers: Nonfiction Bay Area |accessdate=2007-11-02 |date=2007-09-23 |newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It ranked #1 on ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/top10/article/0,30583,1686204_1686244_1691412,00.html Poniewozik, James; Top 10 New TV Series; time.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'s'' {{nowrap|top 10 non-fiction books}} of 2007.

==Background==
The idea of exploring the effects of the depopulating of the Earth is an old one, having been a regular trope in [[science fiction]] novels for decades. Post-apocalyptic literature in general had often tried to imagine the fate of civilization and its artifacts after the end of humanity. Indeed, an extremely popular 1949 novel, ''[[Earth Abides]],'' portrayed the breakdown of urban systems and structures after a pandemic, through the eyes of a survivor, who muses at the end of the first chapter: "What would happen to the world and its creatures without man? That he was left to see."

''The World Without Us'' applies a more ecological view to ''Earth Abides''. Before writing it, the author, [[Alan Weisman]], had written four books, including, ''Gaviotas: A Village to Reinvent the World,'' in 1998, about the [[eco-village]] of [[Gaviotas]] in Colombia; and ''An Echo In My Blood,'' in 1999, about his family's history immigrating from [[Ukraine]] to the United States. He has worked as an international journalist for American magazines and newspapers, and at the time of writing the book was an Associate Professor of Journalism and Latin American Studies at the [[University of Arizona]]. The position required him to teach only one class in the spring semester, and he was free to travel and conduct research the rest of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Williams |first=Wilda |date=2007-05-15 |title=The Lonely Planet |periodical=[[Library Journal]] |publisher=[[Reed Business Information]] |volume=132 |issue=9 |page=112 |issn=0363-0277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea for ''The World Without Us'' was suggested to Weisman in 2004 by Josie Glausiusz, an editor at ''[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]]''.&lt;ref name=pg277&gt;Weisman (2007), 277.&lt;/ref&gt; She had pondered the idea for several years and asked Weisman to write a feature on the subject after she re-read "Journey through a Doomed Land", an article he published in 1994 in ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' about the state of [[Chernobyl]] eight years after abandonment.&lt;ref name=pg277/&gt; His ''Discover'' article, "Earth Without People", published in the February 2005 issue and re-printed in ''The Best American Science Writing 2006'' anthology,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Weisman |first=Alan |author-link=Alan Weisman |date=February 2005 |publication-date=September 5, 2006 |contribution=Earth Without People |editor-last=Gawande |editor-first=Atul |editor-link=Atul Gawande |editor2-last=Cohen |editor2-first=Jesse |title=The Best American Science Writing |edition=2006 |publication-place=New York |publisher=Harper Perennial |pages=28–36 |isbn=978-0-06-072644-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes how nature has thrived in the abandoned [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]] and how nature would overwhelm the [[built environment]] of [[New York City]].&lt;ref name=EWP/&gt; Using interviews with [[Paleoecology|paleoecologists]], the article speculates that [[megafauna]] would return and that forest cover, like the [[Białowieża Forest]], would spread over Europe and the [[eastern United States]]. The article raises the prospect of failing power plants, chemical plants, dams, and petroleum tanks.

To expand this into a book, Weisman's agent found an editor and publisher at [[St. Martin's Press]]. Among the 23-page bibliography are two articles he wrote for the [[Los Angeles Times Magazine]] ("Naked Planet" on persistent organic pollutants, and "The Real Indiana Jones" on the [[Mayan civilization]]) and one published in the ''[[Condé Nast Traveler]]'' ("Diamond in the Wild" on diamond mining), as well as ''Discover'''s "Earth Without People".&lt;ref&gt;Weisman (2007), 289–311.&lt;/ref&gt; Additional research saw Weisman travel to England, Cyprus, Turkey, Panama, and Kenya. Interviews with academics quoted in the book include biologist [[E. O. Wilson]] on the Korean Demilitarized Zone,&lt;ref&gt;Weisman (2007), 129, 189–190.&lt;/ref&gt; archaeologist [[William Rathje]] on plastics in garbage,&lt;ref&gt;Weisman (2007), 119–120.&lt;/ref&gt; forest botanist [[Oliver Rackham]] on vegetative cover across Britain,&lt;ref&gt;Weisman (2007), 150–151.&lt;/ref&gt; anthropologist [[Arthur Demarest]] on the crash of [[Maya civilization|Mayan civilization]],&lt;ref&gt;Weisman (2007), 224–229.&lt;/ref&gt; paleobiologist [[Douglas Erwin]] on evolution,&lt;ref&gt;Weisman (2007), 229–232.&lt;/ref&gt; and philosopher [[Nick Bostrom]] on [[Transhumanism]].&lt;ref&gt;Weisman (2007), 240–244.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The book is divided into 27 chapters, with a [[Prologue|prelude]], [[epilogue|coda]], [[bibliography]] and [[Index (publishing)|index]]. Each chapter deals with a new topic, such as the potential fates of plastics, petroleum infrastructure, nuclear facilities, and artworks. It is written from the point of view of a [[science journalist]] with explanations and testimonies backing his predictions. There is no unifying narrative, cohesive single-chapter overview, or thesis.&lt;ref name=Weiler&gt;{{Citation |last=Weiler |first=Derek |publication-date=August 12, 2007 |title=And the wild things shall inherit the Earth |newspaper=[[Toronto Star]] |url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/article/245456 |accessdate=2007-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Appleton&gt;{{Citation |last=Appleton |first=Josie |date=July 2007 |title=Unleashing nature's terror |work=[[Spiked (magazine)|Spiked]]|issue=3 |url=http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php?/site/reviewofbooks_article/3628/ |accessdate=2007-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weisman's thought experiment pursues two themes: how nature would react to the disappearance of humans and what legacy humans would leave behind. To foresee how other life could continue without humans, Weisman reports from areas where the natural environment exists with little human intervention, like the [[Białowieża Forest]], the [[Kingman Reef]], and the [[Palmyra Atoll]]. He interviews biologist [[E. O. Wilson]] and visits with members of the [[Korean Federation for Environmental Movement]] at the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]] where few humans have penetrated since 1953.&lt;ref&gt;Weisman (2007), 183&amp;ndash;188.&lt;/ref&gt; He tries to conceive how life may evolve by describing the past evolution of pre-historic plants and animals, but notes Douglas Erwin's warning that "we can't predict what the world will be 5 million years later by looking at the survivors".&lt;ref&gt;Weisman (2007), 232.&lt;/ref&gt; Several chapters are dedicated to [[megafauna]], which Weisman predicts would proliferate. He profiles soil samples from the past 200 years and extrapolates concentrations of heavy metals and foreign substances into a future without industrial inputs. Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere and implications for climatic change are likewise examined.

[[File:Pripjat Panorama.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The abandoned city of [[Pripyat]], near [[Chernobyl]]]]With material from previous articles, Weisman uses the fate of the [[Mayan civilization]] to illustrate the possibility of an entrenched society vanishing and how the natural environment quickly conceals evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Weisman (2007), 223&amp;ndash;8.&lt;/ref&gt; To demonstrate how vegetation could compromise human built infrastructure, Weisman interviewed hydrologists and employees at the [[Panama Canal]], where constant maintenance is required to keep the jungle vegetation and silt away from the dams.&lt;ref&gt;Weisman (2007), 173&amp;ndash;178.&lt;/ref&gt; To illustrate abandoned cities succumbing to nature, Weisman reports from [[Chernobyl|Chernobyl, Ukraine]] (abandoned in 1986) and [[Varosha (Famagusta)|Varosha, Cyprus]] (abandoned in 1974). Weisman finds that their structures crumble as weather does unrepaired damage and other life forms create new habitats. In Turkey, Weisman contrasts the construction practices of the rapidly growing [[Istanbul]], as typical for large cities in less developed countries, with the [[underground cities]] in [[Cappadocia]]. Due to a large demand for housing in Istanbul much of it was developed quickly with whatever material was available and could collapse in a major earthquake or other natural disaster.&lt;ref&gt;Weisman (2007), 103&amp;ndash;105.&lt;/ref&gt; Cappadocian underground cities were built thousands of years ago out of volcanic [[tuff]], and are likely to survive for centuries to come.&lt;ref&gt;Weisman (2007), 106&amp;ndash;111.&lt;/ref&gt;

Weisman uses [[New York City]] as a model to outline how an unmaintained urban area would deconstruct. He explains that sewers would clog, underground streams would flood subway corridors, and soils under roads would erode and cave in. From interviews with members of the [[Wildlife Conservation Society]]&lt;ref&gt;Weisman (2007), 22&amp;ndash;24.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[New York Botanical Gardens]]&lt;ref&gt;Weisman (2007), 28&amp;ndash;32.&lt;/ref&gt; Weisman predicts that native vegetation would return, spreading from parks and out-surviving invasive species. Without humans to provide food and warmth, rats and cockroaches would die off.
[[File:Dunn County-old farm.jpg|right|thumb|200px|An abandoned house in a state of collapse]]
Weisman explains that a common house would begin to fall apart as water eventually leaks into the roof around the flashings, erodes the wood and rusts the nails, leading to sagging walls and eventual collapse. After 500 years, all that would be left would be aluminum dishwasher parts, stainless steel cookware, and plastic handles.&lt;ref&gt;Weisman (2007), 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The longest-lasting evidence on Earth of a human presence would be radioactive materials, ceramics, bronze statues, and Mount Rushmore. In space, the [[Pioneer plaque]]s, the [[Voyager Golden Record]], and radio waves would outlast the Earth itself.&lt;ref&gt;Weisman (2007), 249&amp;ndash;254.&lt;/ref&gt;

Breaking from the theme of the natural environment after humans, Weisman considers what could lead to the sudden, complete [[human extinction|demise of humans]] without serious damage to the built and natural environment. That scenario, he concludes, is extremely unlikely. He also considers [[transhumanism]], the [[Voluntary Human Extinction Movement]], the [[Church of Euthanasia]] and [[John A. Leslie]]'s ''The End of the World: the Science and Ethics of Human Extinction''.&lt;ref&gt;Weisman (2007), 239&amp;ndash;244.&lt;/ref&gt; Weisman concludes the book considering a new version of the [[one-child policy]]. While he admits it is a "draconian measure",&lt;ref&gt;Weisman (2007), 272.&lt;/ref&gt; he states, "The bottom line is that any species that overstretches its resource base suffers a population crash. Limiting our reproduction would be damn hard, but limiting our consumptive instincts may be even harder."&lt;ref name=WaPo&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2007/07/27/DI2007072701908.html |title=Book World |accessdate=2007-11-11
|author=Alan Weisman |author2=Callum Roberts  |date=July 31, 2007 |format=Interview |publisher=The Washington Post Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; He responded to criticism of this saying "I knew in advance that I would touch some people's sensitive spots by bringing up the population issue, but I did so because it's been missing too long from the discussion of how we must deal with the situation our economic and demographic growth have driven us too (sic)".&lt;ref name=WaPo/&gt;

Pete Garceau designed the cover art for the American release, which one critic said was "a thick layer of sugar-coated sweetness in an effort to not alarm potential readers. 'Yes, I am a book about the environment. But I'm harmless!

The writing style was positively received as being vivid and well-written, sometimes grim, but with appropriate language.&lt;ref name=Kamiya&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/books/review/2007/07/23/weisman/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170505145955/http://www.salon.com/2007/07/23/weisman/ |archivedate=2017-05-05 |df= |title=The World Without Us |accessdate=2007-11-01 |author=Gary Kamiya |date=2007-07-23 |publisher=[[Salon.com]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even an overall negative review by Michael Grunwald in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' remarked the writing was "always lucid, sometimes elegant".&lt;ref name=Grunwald&gt;{{Citation | last=Grunwald | first=Michael | publication-date= July 29, 2007 | title=What would Earth be like if all the humans died out? | newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/27/AR2007072701593.html |accessdate=2007-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' Jennifer Schuessler said Weisman has a "flirtation with religious language, his occasionally portentous impassivity giving way to the familiar rhetoric of eco-hellfire".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Schuessler | first=Jennifer | publication-date= September 2, 2007 | title=Starting Over | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/02/books/review/Schuessler-t.html?_r=3&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin |accessdate=2007-10-31 |page=G12}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' found the writing had "an arid, plain, what-if style" while being "strangely uniform in tone".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Maslin| first=Janet |author-link =Janet Maslin |date= 2007-08-13 | title=A World Without Humans?

Several critics found the lack of an anthropomorphic point of view hurt the book's relevance.&lt;ref name=Long/&gt; Robert Braile in ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' wrote that it has "no real context ... no rationale for probing this fantasy other than [Weisman's] unsubstantiated premise that people find it fascinating".&lt;ref name=Braile&gt;{{Citation | last=Braile | first=Robert | publication-date= August 18, 2007 | title=He imagines a world without people.

She writes the "book [is] designed to help us find the how of survival by shaking us out of our passive dance with death".&lt;ref name=Michell&gt;{{Citation | last=Michell| first=Alanna| publication-date= July 21, 2007 | title=Good riddance to us and our bad rubbish | newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]] |publisher=[[CTVglobemedia]] |pages=D6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book's environmental focus was also criticized by some. Christopher Orlet of ''[[The American Spectator]]'' wrote that it is "a prime example of the wrongheaded, extremist views of the Greens".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Orlet | first=Christopher| date= 2007-08-01 | title=Better Off Dead |publisher= ''[[The American Spectator]]'' |url= http://www.spectator.org/dsp_article.asp?art_id=11813 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120609112946/http://spectator.org/archives/2007/08/01/better-off-dead |archivedate= 2012-06-09| accessdate=2007-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Braile agrees that the book could be "an environmentalist's nightmare, possibly fueling the cheap shots taken at the green movement ... by critics who say environmentalists care more about nature than people".&lt;ref name=Braile/&gt; Environmentalist [[Alex Steffen]] found the book presents nothing new, but that using the sudden and clean disappearance of humans provides a unique framework, although extremely unlikely and insensitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/007046.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070902084233/http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/007046.html |archivedate=2007-09-02 |title=The World With Us |accessdate=2007-12-20 |author=[[Alex Steffen]] |date=2007-07-23 |work=[[Worldchanging]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two critics who call the book a "[[Jeremiad]]" ultimately gave it a positive review.&lt;ref name=Kamiya/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Heinegg |first=Peter |date= 2007-09-15 |title=The World Without Us |periodical=[[America (Jesuit magazine)|America]] |publisher=America Press |volume=197 |issue=16 |page=23 |issn=0002-7049}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' says "we learn during the course of this book, to feel good about the disappearance of humanity from the Earth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,,2277614,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Goodbye to all this | first=Nicholas | last=Lezard | authorlink = Nicholas Lezard | date=2008-05-03 | accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critics hailed the environmental perspective. Chauncey Mabe of the ''[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel]]'' calls the book "one of the most satisfying environmental books of recent memory, one devoid of self-righteousness, alarmism or tiresome doomsaying".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Mabe | first=Chauncey |date= 2007-08-12 | title='The World Without Us' by Alan Weisman: Don't think about us when we're gone | newspaper=South Florida Sun-Sentinel |url= http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/07224/808312-148.stm |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071103092625/http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/07224/808312-148.stm |archivedate= 2007-11-03 |accessdate=2007-11-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tom Spears of the [[CanWest News Service]] concludes "it's more a portrait of ourselves, taken through an odd lens" and "[s]ometimes an obituary is the best biography".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Spears| first=Tom | date= 2007-09-02 | title=World would go on without us: New book looks at what would happen without people | publisher=[[CanWest News Service]]| newspaper=[[The Province]] |url= http://www.canada.com/theprovince/news/story.html?id=0146ef3d-9418-4bca-9922-7d211095aecd |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071105162323/http://www.canada.com/theprovince/news/story.html?id=0146ef3d-9418-4bca-9922-7d211095aecd |archivedate= 2007-11-05 |accessdate=2007-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genre==
The book is categorized as [[Science book|non-fiction science]] but some commentators emphasize it may be better described as [[speculative fiction]].&lt;ref name=Stott&gt;{{Citation | last=Stott| first=Philip |author-link=Philip Stott |year= 2008 |volume=1 |issue=2| title=Book review: The World Without Us By Alan Weisman |publisher =[[Electronic Journal of Sustainable Development]] |url= http://www.ejsd.org/docs/REVIEW_OF_THE_WORLD_WITHOUT_US.pdf |format=PDF|accessdate=2008-06-17 |pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The World Without Us'' is grounded in [[Environmental journalism|environmental]] and [[science journalism]]. Like other environmental books, it discusses the impact that the human race has had on the planet.&lt;ref name=Lynas&gt;{{Citation | last=Lynas| first=Mark| author-link=Mark Lynas |date= 2007-09-27 | title=Back to the future |publisher =[[New Statesman]]|url= http://www.newstatesman.com/200709270042|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071222080246/http://www.newstatesman.com/200709270042|archivedate= 2007-12-22 |accessdate=2007-12-04 |pages=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weisman's thought experiment removes the judgments and sufferings of humans by focusing on a hypothetical post-human world. This approach to the genre, which "throw[s] the spotlight on the earth itself",&lt;ref name=Kamiya/&gt; was found to be creative and objective.&lt;ref name=Weiler /&gt; There have been other books that address similar topics, such as [[Gregory Benford]]'s 1999 book ''Deep Time: How Humanity Communicates Across Millennia''. [[Science fiction]] writers such as [[H. G. Wells]] (''[[The War of the Worlds]]'', 1898) and [[John Wyndham]] (''[[The Day of the Triffids]]'', 1951) had earlier touched upon the possible fate of cities and other man-made structures after the sudden removal of their creators. Similar parallels in the decay of civilization are detailed in 1949 post-apocalyptic [[science fiction]] [[novel]] by Berkeley English professor [[George R. Stewart]], ''[[Earth Abides]].''

Addressing his approach, Weisman said that eliminating the human element eliminated the "fear factor" that people are doing something wrong or that they will die; it is meant to be read as a fantasy, according to the author.&lt;ref name=powell/&gt; Josie Appleton of ''[[Spiked (magazine)|Spiked]]'' related the book to "today's romanticisation of nature" in that it linked "the decadence and detachment of a modern consumerist society" with an ignorance of the efforts required to produce products so easily disposed.&lt;ref name=Appleton /&gt; Appleton also felt the book countered the "Nature knows best" notion by highlighting the randomness of natural forces.&lt;ref name=Appleton/&gt;

Weisman's science journalism style uses interviews with academic and professional authorities to substantiate conclusions, while maintaining the "cool and dispassionate [tone]...of a scientific observer rather than an activist".&lt;ref name=Weiler/&gt; Weisman said he purposely avoided the [[activist]] label: "Some of our finest science and nature writers only get read by people who already agree with them. It's nice to get some affirmation for whatever it is you believe is true, even if it's quite sobering, but I wanted to write something that people would read ... without minimizing the significance of what's going on, nor trivializing it, nor oversimplifying it."&lt;ref name=powell&gt;{{cite interview | subject=Alan Weisman | subjectlink =Alan Weisman |interviewer= Dave Weich| title = With People out of the Picture, Alan Weisman Gets Creative |url= http://www.powells.com/authors/alanweisman.html |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071228054006/http://www.powells.com/authors/alanweisman.html |archivedate= 2007-12-28 | work = [[Powell's Books|Powells.com]] |location= Portland |date= 2007-07-19 | accessdate = 2007-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Fortey]] compares the book to the works of [[Jared Diamond]], [[Tim Flannery]] and [[E.O. Wilson]], and writes that ''The World Without Us'' "narrowly avoids engendering the gloom-and-doom ennui that tends to engulf the poor reader after reading a catalogue of human rapacity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Fortey | first=Richard |author-link=Richard Fortey| publication-date= August 16, 2007 |title= How would Nature clean up our mess? | newspaper= [[The Daily Telegraph]]| publication-place =London |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2007/08/16/boweis112.xml |accessdate=2007-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Lynas]] in the ''[[New Statesman]]'' noted that "whereas most environmental books sag under the weight of their accumulated bad news, ''The World Without Us'' seems refreshingly positive".&lt;ref name=Lynas/&gt; Demonstrating the optimism on the grim subject matter Appleton quotes an ecologist from the book saying "if the planet can recover from the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event|Permian]], it can recover from the human".&lt;ref name=Appleton/&gt;

==In popular culture==
* ''[[The Earth After Us]]'' explores the geological legacy of the human species.
* ''[[There Will Come Soft Rains]]'', a 1920 poem by [[Sara Teasdale]].
* ''[[After Man: A Zoology of the Future]]'' considers the evolution of life on Earth 50&amp;nbsp;million years after the extinction of human beings.
* The plot of ''[[Foundation and Earth]]'' by [[Isaac Asimov]] (a continuation of his [[Foundation Trilogy]]), includes Aurora, a habitable planet which was abandoned by people for thousands of years. That planet, however, was settled by people, and its limited ecology was maintained by them, leading to its deterioration in the absence of human beings.

There have been several TV specials relating to the same topic:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Tucker | first=Neely | publication-date= March 8, 2008 | title=Depopulation Boom | newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/07/AR2008030703256.html |accessdate=2008-06-14 |pages=C01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Life After People]]'' shows what would happen if humans disappeared instantly.
* ''[[Aftermath: Population Zero]]'' is the same as the above, but gives more detail into certain things.
* ''[[The Future Is Wild]]'', while not seeking to explain our disappearance, shows how life on Earth (without humans) would evolve 5, 100 and 200&amp;nbsp;million years in the future.

The 2009 hip-hop song "The High Line" by [[Kinetics &amp; One Love]], inspired by ''The World Without Us'', is a pro-green, anti-deforestation song that paints the picture of trees and plants reclaiming the buildings of New York City long after the presence of humans. Like author Alan Weisman, rapper Kinetics uses the [[High Line]] railway in Manhattan as an example of nature’s potential for reclamation of manmade structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rapgenius.com/1751928|title=Rap Genius: Lyrics and Explanations for the Kinetics &amp; One Love song "The High Line"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2013 video game ''[[The Last of Us]]'', which takes place twenty years after an apocalyptic event, uses ''The World Without Us'' as inspiration for the look of the city settings.&lt;ref&gt;''Grounded: The Making Of The Last of Us''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 [[20th Century Fox]] purchased the rights to the book with the intent of creating a motion picture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE53110320090402 | work=Reuters | title="World Without Us" to be adapted as sci-fi film | date=2009-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vaughn Bodē''' ({{IPAc-en|b|oʊ|ˈ|d|eI}}; July 22, 1941 – July 18, 1975) was an American  [[underground comics|underground cartoonist]] and [[illustrator]] known for his character [[Cheech Wizard]] and his artwork depicting voluptuous women. A contemporary of [[Ralph Bakshi]], Bodē has been credited as an influence on Bakshi's animated films ''[[Wizards (film)|Wizards]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''. Bodē has a huge following among [[graffiti]] artists, with his characters remaining a popular subject.&lt;ref name=Harmanci&gt;Harmanci, Reyhan, [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/02/us/02bcculture.html?_r=0 "The Bay Citizen: In Finishing Comics, a Son Completes a Legacy,"] ''New York Times'' (July 1, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

Bodē was inducted into the [[List of Eisner Award winners#The Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame|Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame]] for comics artists in 2006.&lt;ref name="comiccon"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.comic-con.org/cci/cci_eisners_06rcv.shtml | title=The 2006 Eisner Award Winners | work=San Diego Comic-Con | accessdate=2008-04-22 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411173530/http://www.comic-con.org/cci/cci_eisners_06rcv.shtml | archivedate=2008-04-11 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
{{more citations needed|section|date = September 2017}}
In 1963, at age 21, and while living in [[Utica, New York]],&lt;ref name=Fox /&gt; Bodē self-published ''Das Kämpf'', considered one of the first underground comic books.&lt;ref name="various2014"&gt;{{cite book|title=witzend|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZrkhDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA293|date=8 July 2014|publisher=Fantagraphics Books|isbn=978-1-60699-744-4|pages=293–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Created after Bodē's stint in the [[U.S. Army]], ''Das Kampf'' has been called "a war-themed spoof on [[Charles Schulz]]'s 1962 book ''Happiness is a Warm Puppy''."&lt;ref name=Fox&gt;Fox, M. Steven. [http://comixjoint.com/daskampf-2nd.html "Das Kampf,"] ComixJoint. Accessed Dec. 29, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; With money borrowed from his brother Vincent, Bodē photocopied about 100 copies of the 52-page book and (mostly unsuccessfully) attempted to sell it around the Utica area.&lt;ref name=Fox /&gt;
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Looking - Cheech Wizard - Bodé.jpg|thumbnail|400px|right| Bodē's [[Cheech Wizard]]]] --&gt;
In the mid 1960s Bodē was living in [[Syracuse, New York]], attending classes at [[Syracuse University]] and contributing to ''The Sword of Damocles'', a student-run, though not university-sanctioned, humor magazine similar to ''[[Harvard Lampoon|The Harvard Lampoon]]''. It was here that Bodē's most famous comic creation, [[Cheech Wizard]], first saw publication. Cheech Wizard (sometimes characterized as a "cartoon messiah") is a [[Wizard (fantasy)|wizard]] whose large yellow hat (decorated with black and red stars) covers his entire body except his legs and his big red feet. Cheech Wizard is constantly in search of a good party, cold beer, and attractive women. Usually depicted without arms, it is never actually revealed what Cheech Wizard looks like under the hat, or exactly what kind of creature he is, although in the episode entitled "The Unmasking of Cheech Wizard", when he "doffs the hat", it is evident that underneath was a low-rent Oz man all along (in an interview, reference is made to the frontal lump in the hat caused by crossed arms). Characters pressing the issue generally are rewarded with a swift kick to the groin by Cheech. After an initial run in ''The Sword of Damocles'', the strip continued for a few more years in ''[[The Daily Orange]]'', the student-written newspaper at Syracuse University.

In 1968, Bodē illustrated the cover &amp; interior art for [[R. A. Lafferty]]'s [[science fiction]] novel ''Space Chantey'', published by [[Ace Double]]. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, he illustrated covers and interior art for the science fiction digests ''[[Amazing Stories]]'', ''[[Fantastic (magazine)|Fantastic]]'', ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction]]'', ''[[Witzend]]'' and ''[[Worlds of If]]''.

Discovered by fellow cartoonist [[Trina Robbins]], Bodē moved to [[Manhattan]] in 1969 and joined the staff of the underground newspaper the ''[[East Village Other]]''.&lt;ref name="Harmanci" /&gt; It was here that Bodē met [[Spain Rodriguez]], [[Robert Crumb]] and other founders of the quickly expanding [[underground comics]] world.&lt;ref name="nytimeswiz" /&gt; At the ''East Village Other'', he helped found ''[[Gothic Blimp Works]]'', an underground comics supplement to the magazine, which ran for eight issues, the first two edited by Bodē.

Bodē's [[post-apocalyptic]] [[science fiction]] action series ''[[Cobalt 60 (comics)|Cobalt 60]]'' featured an [[antihero]] wandering a devastated [[post-nuclear]] land, seeking to avenge the murder of his parents. ''Cobalt-60'' debuted as a ten-page black-and-white story in the [[science fiction]] [[fanzine]] ''[[Los Angeles Science Fantasy Society|Shangri L'Affaires]]'' (a.k.a. ''Shaggy'') #73, published in 1968. Bodē won the 1969 [[Hugo Award]] for Best Fanzine Artist largely on the strength of ''Cobalt 60'', but he never did anything else with the character. (''Cobalt-60'' was later "completed" in the early 1980s by Bodē's's son [[Mark Bodé]], with stories by [[Larry Todd]], who was Vaughn's friend and collaborator in the 1960s on projects for ''[[Eerie (Avon)|Eerie]]'', ''[[Creepy (magazine)|Creepy]]'', and ''[[Vampirella]]'' magazines.)

Beginning in 1968 and continuing until his untimely death, Bodē entered a prolific period of creativity, introducing a number of strips and ongoing series, most of which ran in underground newspapers or erotic magazines:
* Bodē's strip ''War Lizards'', a look at the [[Vietnam War]] from the hostile stance of the period's [[counterculture]], was told with [[anthropomorphic]] reptiles instead of people. It ran sporadically in the ''[[East Village Other]]'', ''[[Witzend]]'', ''Pig Society'', and Bodē's own ''Junkwaffel'' from 1969–1972.
* Bodē's comic strip ''Deadbone'', about the adventures of the inhabitants of a solitary mountain a billion years in the past, ran in the men's magazine ''[[Cavalier (magazine)|Cavalier]]'' from 1969–1975. Originally in black-and-white, when colored the strip changed its title to ''Deadbone Erotica'' and later simply to ''Erotica''. 
* Episodes of ''Cheech Wizard'' ran in the "Funny Pages" of [[National Lampoon (magazine)|''National Lampoon'']] magazine in almost every issue from 1971 to 1975. 
* Bodē's black-and-white science fiction parody ''Sunpot'' appeared in ''Galaxy Science Fiction'' in the early 1970s. (It was later republished, in color, in ''[[Heavy Metal (magazine)|Heavy Metal]]''.)
* Bodē's monthly comic strip feature ''Purple Pictography'' ran in ''[[Swank (magazine)|Swank]]'' magazine in 1971–1972. ([[Bernie Wrightson]] did the painted art for five of ''Purple Pictography'' episodes based on Bodé's scripts and rough layouts.)

[[Print Mint]] published four issues of Bodē's solo series ''Junkwaffel'' from 1971–1974. Bodē's graphic novel ''The Man'', published by Print Mint in 1972, is about a [[caveman]] who accidentally makes important observations about life.

=== Cartoon Concert tour===
Beginning in 1972, Bodē toured with a show called the "Cartoon Concert," that featured him vocalizing his characters while their depictions were presented on a screen behind him via a [[slide projector]].&lt;ref name="nytimeswiz" /&gt; The first of these was presented in October 1972 at the [[Detroit Triple Fan Fair]] in front of 80 people. He next did the "Concert" at [[Bowling Green State University]],&lt;ref name="Harmanci" /&gt;  and eventually performed it at several [[comic book conventions]], including the November 1972 [[Creation Con]] in New York City. Observing the crowd reaction, The [[Bantam Lecture Bureau]] immediately signed him on, and the show became very popular on the college lecture circuit. Bodē even performed it at [[The Louvre]], in [[Paris]].&lt;ref name=Levin&gt;Bob Levin. "I See My Light Come Shining," ''The Comics Journal'' vol. 5, (March 2005). [http://www.markbode.com/site/article_2.html Archived at The Official Bodē website]. Accessed Feb. 18, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==

=== Early life ===
Bodē was born in [[Utica, New York]], the son of Kenneth and Elsie Bodé.&lt;ref name=Levin /&gt; His [[surname]] suggests German heritage. Vaughn was one of four children, including his older brother Victor and younger siblings Vincent and Valerie.&lt;ref name=Levin /&gt; Vaughn's father was an alcoholic;&lt;ref name=Levin /&gt; he started drawing as a way of escaping a less-than-happy childhood.&lt;ref name= nytimeswiz /&gt; Bodē's parents divorced when he was around ten years old, and he was sent to live with an uncle near [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref name=Levin /&gt;

After joining the [[United States Army|Army]] at age 19, Bodē went [[AWOL]] but later received an [[honorable discharge]] due to a psychiatric diagnosis.&lt;ref name=Zagria&gt;Zagria. [http://zagria.blogspot.com/2009/06/vaughn-bode-1941-1975-artist.html "Vaughn Bodé (1941 - 1975),"] ''A Gender Variance Who's Who'' (15 June 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

Bodē married Barbara Hawkins at age 20 in 1961.&lt;ref name="Levin" /&gt; Their son [[Mark Bodé|Mark]] was born in 1963. Barbara divorced Bodē in 1972,&lt;ref name="Levin" /&gt; and he moved to [[San Francisco]]  in 1973 (with some of his underground contemporaries, including Robbins and Spain).&lt;ref name="nytimeswiz" /&gt;

=== Sexuality ===
Around 1970–1971, conversations with the [[guru]] [[Prem Rawat]] and fellow cartoonist [[Jeff Jones (artist)|Jeffrey Catherine Jones]] (with whom Bodē shared a studio in [[Woodstock, New York]])&lt;ref name=Zagria /&gt; led Bodē to [[cross-dressing]], [[transvestism]],&lt;ref name=Harmanci /&gt; and even a short-lived experiment with female hormones.&lt;ref name=Zagria /&gt; Bodē described his sexuality as "auto-sexual, heterosexual, homosexual, mano-sexual, sado-sexual, trans-sexual, uni-sexual, omni-sexual."&lt;ref name="nytimeswiz" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Zagria /&gt;

=== Death ===
Bodē's death was due to [[autoerotic asphyxiation]]. His last words were to his son: "Mark, I've seen God four times, and I'm going to see him again soon. That's No. 1 to me, and you're No. 2."&lt;ref name="nytimeswiz"&gt;{{cite news | work=The New York Times | date=2004-05-31 | last=Frucci | first=Angela | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F02E3DB1F3EF932A05756C0A9629C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all | title=Following a Wiz to a Far-Out Oz; A Son Completes the Legacy Of an Underground Cartoonist | accessdate=2008-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty-three years old at the time of his death, Bodē's ashes were dropped from a [[Cessna]] airplane over the waters off the coast of [[Point Reyes]].&lt;ref name="nytimeswiz" /&gt;

He left behind a library of sketchbooks, journals, finished and unfinished works, paintings, and comic strips. Most of his art has since been published in a variety of collections, mostly from [[Fantagraphics]].

== Influence ==
Bodē was a friend of animator [[Ralph Bakshi]], and warned him against working with [[Robert Crumb]] on the [[Fritz the Cat (film)|animated film adaptation]] of Crumb's strip ''[[Fritz the Cat]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gibson |first1=Jon M. |last2=McDonnell |first2=Chris |title=Unfiltered: The Complete Ralph Bakshi |year=2008 |publisher=Universe Publishing |isbn=0-7893-1684-6 |pages=63 |chapter=''Fritz the Cat'' }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bodē has been credited as an influence on Bakshi's films ''[[Wizards (film)|Wizards]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beck |first=Jerry |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The Animated Movie Guide |year=2005 |publisher=Chicago Review Press |location= |chapter=''Wizards'' |page=317 |isbn=978-1-55652-591-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lenburg |first=Jeff |title=Who's who in Animated Cartoons |year=2006 |publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation |isbn=1-55783-671-X |chapter=Bakshi, Ralph |page=15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The above statement is very unclear. It is far more likely that Robert Crumb warned Bode against working with Ralph Bakshi. It was Bakshi's film, inspired by Crumb's Fritz the Cat creation. Crumb states that he did not want the film made, but that the production "steamrollered" right over him.

Bodē has a huge following among [[graffiti]] artists and his work can often be seen replicated in the world of street art.&lt;ref name= nytimeswiz /&gt; As the original New York graffiti train writers (such as [[DONDI]]) chose to replicate his characters, images from his work have remained popular throughout the history of graffiti.&lt;ref name=Harmanci /&gt;

His son [[Mark Bodé]] is also an artist, producing works similar to the elder Bodē's style, and further cementing his father's legacy.&lt;ref name=Harmanci /&gt; In 2004, Mark completed one of his father's unfinished works, ''The Lizard of Oz'', a send-up of ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', starring Cheech Wizard one more time.&lt;ref name= nytimeswiz /&gt;

==Awards==
The [[Hugo Award for Best Fan Artist]] was bestowed upon him in 1969, and he was nominated for [[Hugo Award for Best Professional Artist|Best Professional Artist]] the following year. He also won the {{Interlanguage link multi|Yellow Kid Award|de|3=Yellow Kid (Preis)|lt=Yellow Kid Award}}, awarded by the International Congress of Cartoonists and Animators at the Italian [[Lucca Comics &amp; Games|Lucca comics festival]], in 1974. He was a finalist for induction into the [[Eisner Awards|Eisner Hall of Fame]] in 1998 and 2002, before finally being inducted in 2006.

{{Euthanasia}}

'''Voluntary euthanasia''' is the practice of ending a life in a painless manner. Voluntary [[euthanasia]] ('''VE''') and [[physician-assisted suicide]] (PAS) have been the focus of great controversy in recent years.

As of 2009, some forms of voluntary euthanasia are legal in [[Belgium]],&lt;ref name=law&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/2600923.stm |title=Euthanasia and the law |publisher=BBC News |date=23 December 2002 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929211243/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/2600923.stm |archivedate=29 September 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Colombia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pri.org/stories/2015-04-29/colombia-just-legalized-euthanasia-heres-why-thats-big-deal |title=Colombia just legalized euthanasia.

Voluntary [[Terminal dehydration|refusal of food and fluids]] (VRFF) or [[Terminal illness#Refusal of nutrition and hydration|Patient Refusal of Nutrition and Hydration]] (PRNH) is bordering on euthanasia. Some authors classify it as a form of passive euthanasia,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amsa.org/dd/prnh.cfm Patient Refusal of Nutrition and Hydration: Walking the Ever-Finer Line] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013033540/http://www.amsa.org/dd/prnh.cfm |date=13 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while others treat it separately because it is treated differently from legal point of view and often perceived as a more ethical option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harvath | first1 = TA.  |date=May 2004 | title = Voluntary refusal of food and fluids: attitudes of Oregon hospice nurses and social workers | url = | journal = Int J Palliat Nurs. | volume = 10 | issue = 5| pages = 236–41 | pmid = 15215708 }}&lt;/ref&gt; VRFF is sometimes suggested as a legal alternative to euthanasia in jurisdictions disallowing euthanasia.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

=== Assisted Suicide ===
{{Main article|Assisted suicide}}
Assisted suicide is a practice in which a person receives assistance in bringing about their death, typically people suffering from a severe physical illness,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/assisted%20suicide |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029202006/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/assisted%20suicide |archivedate=29 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the final step in the process is actively performed by the person concerned. In [[physician-assisted suicide]] (also called physician aid-in-dying or PAD) a [[physician]] knowingly provides a [[Competence (law)|competent]] but suffering patient, upon the patient's request, with the means by which the patient intends to end his or her own life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://depts.washington.edu/bioethx/topics/pad.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217070301/http://depts.washington.edu/bioethx/topics/pad.html |archivedate=17 December 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Assisted suicide is contrasted with "active euthanasia" when the difference between providing the means and actively administering lethal medicine is considered important.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/n0a66j00l1mnnlju/ | doi=10.1007/s00414-002-0346-3|title=Assisted suicide bordering on active euthanasia|journal=International Journal of Legal Medicine | date = April 2003| volume =117|pages= 106–108 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Euthanasia in Switzerland|Swiss law]] allows assisted suicide while all forms of active euthanasia (like [[lethal injection]]) remain prohibited.&lt;ref name="CB1" /&gt;

== History ==
{{Globalize|section|Europe|date=December 2009}}
The term euthanasia comes from the Greek words "eu"-meaning good and "thanatos"-meaning death, which combined means “well-death” or "dying well". [[Hippocrates]] mentions euthanasia in the [[Hippocratic Oath]], which was written between 400 and 300 BC The original Oath states: “To please no one will I prescribe a deadly drug nor give advice which may cause his death.”&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.euthanasia.com/historyeuthanasia.html |title=History of Euthanasia |publisher=euthanasia.com |accessdate=2009-09-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090825100419/http://www.euthanasia.com/historyeuthanasia.html |archivedate=25 August 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the ancient Greeks and Romans generally did not believe that life needed to be preserved at any cost and were, in consequence, tolerant of suicide in cases where no relief could be offered to the dying or, in the case of the [[Stoics]] and [[Epicureans]], where a person no longer cared for his life.&lt;ref name="plato"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See [[Senicide]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[English Common Law]] from the 14th century until the middle of the last century made suicide a criminal act in England and Wales. Assisting others to kill themselves remains illegal in that jurisdiction. However, in the 16th century, [[Thomas More]], considered a [[Saint#Catholic Church|saint]] by Roman Catholics, described a [[Utopia (book)|utopian community]] and envisaged such a community as one that would facilitate the death of those whose lives had become burdensome as a result of "torturing and lingering pain", see [[Utopia (book)#The meaning of the work|The meaning of the work]].&lt;ref name="plato"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Humphry and Wickett (1986:8–10) on More, Montaigne, Donne, and Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern ===
Since the 19th century, euthanasia has sparked intermittent debates and activism in Europe and the Americas. According to medical historian Ezekiel Emanuel, it was the availability of anesthesia that ushered in the modern era of euthanasia. In 1828, the first known anti-euthanasia law in the United States was passed in the state of New York, with many other localities and states following suit over a period of several years.&lt;ref name="euth-ppt"&gt;''"The earliest American statute explicitly to outlaw assisting suicide was enacted in New York in 1828, Act of 10 December 1828, ch. 20, §4, 1828 N. Y. Laws 19 (codified at 2 N. Y. Rev. Stat. pt. 4, ch. 1, tit. 2, art. 1, §7, p. 661 (1829)), and many of the new States and Territories followed New York's example."'' Thomas J. Marzen, ''Origins'', Volume 27. p73-74.&lt;/ref&gt; After the Civil War, voluntary euthanasia was promoted by advocates, including some doctors.&lt;ref&gt;Humphry and Wickett 1986:11–12, Emanuel 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Support peaked around the start of the 20th century in the US and then grew again in the 1930s.

In an article in the ''[[Bulletin of the History of Medicine]]'', Brown University historian Jacob M. Appel documented extensive political debate over legislation to legalize physician-assisted suicide in both Iowa and Ohio in 1906.&lt;ref name = "mleahm"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Appel | first1 = Jacob M. | year = 2004 | title = A Duty to Kill? A Duty to Die | url = | journal = Bulletin of the History of Medicine | volume = 78 | issue = | pages = 3610–634 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Appel indicates social activist [[Anna S. Hall]] was the driving force behind this movement.&lt;ref name = "mleahm"/&gt; According to historian [[Ian Dowbiggin]], leading public figures, including [[Clarence Darrow]] and [[Jack London]], advocated for the legalization of euthanasia.&lt;ref name="Dowbiggin"&gt;{{Cite book| title=A Merciful End: The Euthanasia Movement in Modern America| author=[[Ian Dowbiggin]] | publisher=OUP| isbn=0-19-515443-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937, doctor-assisted euthanasia was declared legal in Switzerland as long as the doctor ending the life had nothing to gain.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bartleby"/&gt; During this same era, US courts tackled cases involving critically ill people who requested physician assistance in dying as well as "mercy killings," such as by parents of their severely disabled children.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

====Post-war====
During the post-war period, prominent proponents of euthanasia included [[Glanville Williams]] (''The Sanctity of Life and the Criminal Law'') and clergyman [[Joseph Fletcher]] ("Morals and medicine"). By the 1960s, advocacy for a right-to-die approach to voluntary euthanasia increased.

{{See also|Euthanasia in Australia}}
In 1996, the world's first euthanasia legislation, the [[Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1996]], was passed in the [[Northern Territory]] of Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Australia passes first euthanasia law | journal=[[BMJ]] |date=June 1995  | doi=10.1136/bmj.310.6992.1427a |last1=Zinn |first1=C. |volume=310 |issue=6992 |pages=1427–8 | pmid=7613271 | pmc=2549853}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four patients died through assisted suicide under the Act, using a [[euthanasia device|device]] designed by Dr [[Philip Nitschke]]. The legislation was overturned by Australia’s Federal Parliament in 1997.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;&lt;ref name="plato"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bartleby"/&gt; In response to the overturning of the Act, Nitschke founded [[EXIT (Australia)|EXIT International]]. In 2009, an Australian [[quadriplegic]] was granted the right to refuse sustenance and be allowed to die.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Brice|first=Arthur|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/asiapcf/08/14/australia.right.to.die/index.html|title=Australian quadriplegic granted right to starve to death|date=14 August 2009|publisher=[[CNN]]|accessdate=14 August 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090817063759/http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/asiapcf/08/14/australia.right.to.die/index.html|archivedate=17 August 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Supreme Court of Western Australia]] ruled that it was up to Christian Rossiter, aged 49, to decide if he was to continue to receive medical care (tube feeding) and that his carers had to abide by his wishes.  Chief Justice [[Wayne Martin (judge)|Wayne Martin]] also stipulated that his carers, Brightwater Care, would not be held criminally responsible for following his instructions.  Rossiter died on 21 September 2009 following a chest infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,,25928536-23289,00.html| work=[[The Australian]] | title=Stroke drug left in limbo by delay in benefits approval}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.news.com.au/adelaidenow/story/0,,26102527-911,00.html |publisher=[[News Limited]] |  work= | title=Quadriplegic Christian Rossiter dies from chest infection | date=21 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Colombia ===
On 20 May 1997, the [[Constitutional Court of Colombia]] decriminalised piety homicide, for terminally ill patients, stating that "the medical author cannot be held responsible for the assisted suicide of a terminally ill patient" and urged [[Congress of Colombia|Congress]] to regulate [[euthanasia]] "in the shortest time possible".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dmd.org.co/pdf/sentencia-c-239.pdf|title=REPÚBLICA DE COLOMBIA Corte Constitucional Sentencia No. C-239/97|author=[[Constitutional Court of Colombia]]|date=20 May 1997|access-date=24 November 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161124160354/http://www.dmd.org.co/pdf/sentencia-c-239.pdf|archivedate=24 November 2016|df=dmy-all}} (in Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 December 2014, the Constitutional Court had given the [[Ministry of Health and Social Protection (Colombia)|Ministry of Health and Social Protection]] 30 days to publish guidelines for the healthcare sector to use in order to guarantee terminated ill patients, with the wish to undergo euthanasia, their right to a dignified death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elespectador.com/vivir/los-principios-regular-eutanasia-articulo-544675|title=Los principios para regular la eutanasia|publisher=ElEspectador.com|date=19 February 2015|author=Redacción Salud|language=es|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161124160920/http://www.elespectador.com/vivir/los-principios-regular-eutanasia-articulo-544675|archivedate=24 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957 in Britain, [[Patrick Devlin, Baron Devlin|Judge Devlin]] ruled in the trial of [[John Bodkin Adams|Dr John Bodkin Adams]] that causing death through the administration of lethal drugs to a patient, if the intention is solely to alleviate pain, is not considered murder even if death is a potential or even likely outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=mDvBJ5J4tusC&amp;pg=PA177&amp;lpg=PA177&amp;dq=%22Thomas+Lodwig%22+dr#PPA177,M1 |author=Margaret Otlowski |title=Voluntary Euthanasia and the Common Law |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1997 |pages=175–177|isbn=9780198259961 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, the Netherlands decriminalized doctor-[[assisted suicide]], and in 2002, restrictions were loosened.  During that year, physician-assisted suicide was approved in [[Belgium]]. Belgium's at the time most famous author [[Hugo Claus]], suffering from [[Alzheimer's disease]], was among those that asked for euthanasia. He died in March 2008, assisted by an [[Antwerp]] doctor.

=== United States ===
{{See also|Euthanasia in the United States|Assisted suicide in the United States}}
A key turning point in the debate over voluntary euthanasia (and physician assisted dying), at least in the United States, was the public furor over the [[Karen Ann Quinlan case]]. The Quinlan case paved the way for legal protection of voluntary passive euthanasia.&lt;ref&gt;For the UK see the Bland case.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, California legalized living wills and other states soon followed suit.

In 1980 the [[Hemlock Society USA]] was founded in Santa Monica by [[Derek Humphry]]. It was the first group in the [[United States]] to provide information to the terminally ill in case they wanted a hastened death.  Hemlock also campaigned and partially financed drives to reform the law.  In 2003 Hemlock was merged with End of Life Choices, which changed its name to Compassion and Choices.

In 1990, Dr. [[Jack Kevorkian]], a Michigan physician, became famous for educating and assisting people in committing physician-assisted suicide, which resulted in a Michigan law against the practice in 1992.  Kevorkian was tried and convicted in 1999 for a murder displayed on television.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bartleby"/&gt; Also in 1990, the Supreme Court approved the use of non-active euthanasia.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Department of Health]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Oregon voters approved the [[Oregon Death with Dignity Act|Death with Dignity Act]], permitting doctors to assist terminal patients with six months or less to live to end their lives. The U.S. Supreme Court allowed such laws in 1997.&lt;ref name="plato"/&gt; The Bush administration failed in its attempt to use drug law to stop Oregon in 2001, in the case ''[[Gonzales v. Oregon]]''.&lt;ref name="bartleby"/&gt;

In 2005, amid U.S. government roadblocks and controversy, [[Terri Schiavo case|Terri Schiavo]], a Floridian who had been in a vegetative state since 1990, had her feeding tube removed. Her husband had won the right to take her off life support, which he claimed she would want but was difficult to confirm as she had no [[living will]] and the rest of her family claimed otherwise.&lt;ref name="bartleby"&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/65/eu/euthanas.html "euthanasia"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326052537/http://www.bartleby.com/65/eu/euthanas.html |date=26 March 2009 }}. ''The Columbia Encyclopedia'', Sixth Edition. 2001–07&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2008, [[Washington Initiative 1000]] made Washington the second U.S. state to legalize physician-assisted suicide.

=== China and Hong Kong ===

Euthanasia is a criminal offense in China.  For example, in [[Shanghai]] a 67-year-old man was sentenced to 5 years in prison when he euthanized his 92-year-old mother when she emerged from a hospital procedure only able to move one finger and one toe.  The sentence was considered lenient because he had displayed filial piety toward his mother.&lt;ref&gt;Annals of Bioethics: Regional Perspectives in Bioethics; by Mark J. Cherry and John F. Peppin; Taylor &amp; Francis, Aug 10, 2005, [https://books.google.com/books?id=CUB5AgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA253&amp;dq=china%20euthanasia&amp;pg=PA253#v=onepage&amp;q=china%20euthanasia&amp;f=false page 253] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112165704/https://books.google.com/books?id=CUB5AgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA253&amp;dq=china%20euthanasia&amp;pg=PA253 |date=12 January 2016 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

While active euthanasia remains illegal in China, it is gaining increasing acceptance among doctors and the general populace.&lt;ref name="pmid2061698"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Pu SD |title=Euthanasia in China: a report |journal=J Med Philos |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=131–8 |date=April 1991 |pmid=2061698 |url=|doi=10.1093/jmp/16.2.131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hong Kong, support for euthanasia among the general public is higher among those who put less importance on religious belief, those who are non-Christian, those who have higher family incomes, those who have more experience in taking care of terminally ill family members, and those who are older.&lt;ref name="pmid19197770"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1080/07481180590519769|vauthors=Chong AM, Fok SY |title=Attitudes toward Euthanasia in Hong Kong&amp;nbsp;– A Comparison Between Physicians and the General Public |journal=Death Studies |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=29–54 |date=December 2004 |url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a725279585|pmid=15726742}}

== Arguments for and against ==

Since [[World War II]], the debate over euthanasia in Western countries has centered on voluntary euthanasia within regulated health care systems. In some cases, judicial decisions, legislation, and regulations have made voluntary euthanasia an explicit option for patients and their guardians.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Euthanasia#Governmental, religious, and other non-governmental policymaking|Government policies]] below for specific examples&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents and critics of such voluntary euthanasia policies offer the following reasons for and against official voluntary euthanasia policies:

=== For ===

Proponents of voluntary euthanasia emphasize that choice is a fundamental principle for liberal democracies and free market systems.&lt;ref name="plato"/&gt;

The pain and suffering a person feels during a disease, even with pain relievers, can be incomprehensible to a person who has not gone through it. Even without considering the physical pain, it is often difficult for patients to overcome the emotional pain of losing their independence.&lt;ref name="plato"/&gt;

Those who witness others die are "particularly convinced" that the law should be changed to allow assisted death.&lt;ref name="Chapple-2006"&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Chapple | first1 = A. | last2 = Ziebland | first2 = S. | last3 = McPherson | first3 = A. | last4 = Herxheimer | first4 = A. | title = What people close to death say about euthanasia and assisted suicide: a qualitative study | journal = J Med Ethics | volume = 32 | issue = 12 | pages = 706–10 |date=Dec 2006 | doi = 10.1136/jme.2006.015883| pmc = 2563356 | pmid = 17145910 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today in many countries there is a shortage of hospital space.  Medical personnel and hospital beds could be used for people whose lives could be saved instead of continuing the lives of those who want to die, thus increasing the general quality of care and shortening hospital waiting lists. It is a burden to keep people alive past the point they can contribute to society, especially if the resources used could be spent on a curable ailment.&lt;ref&gt;See also [[Utilitarianism]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Against ===
Critics argue that voluntary euthanasia could unduly compromise the professional roles of health care employees, especially doctors. They point out that European physicians of previous centuries traditionally swore some variation of the [[Hippocratic Oath]], which in its [[Hippocratic oath#The Hippocratic Oath|ancient form]] excluded euthanasia:  "To please no one will I prescribe a deadly drug nor give advice which may cause his death.."  However, since the 1970s, this oath has largely [[Hippocratic oath#Modern versions and alternatives|fallen out of use]].

Some people, including many Christians, consider euthanasia of some or all types to be morally unacceptable.&lt;ref name="plato"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/euthanasia-voluntary/ |title=Voluntary Euthanasia |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |accessdate=2009-09-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This view usually treats euthanasia to be a type of murder and voluntary euthanasia as a type of suicide, the morality of which is the subject of active debate.

If there is some reason to believe the cause of a patient's illness or suffering is or will soon be curable, the correct action is sometimes considered to attempt to bring about a cure or engage in palliative care.&lt;ref name="plato"/&gt;

Feasibility of implementation: Euthanasia can only be considered "voluntary" if a patient is mentally competent to make the decision, i.e., has a rational understanding of options and consequences.  [[Competence (law)|Competence]] can be difficult to determine or even define.&lt;ref name="plato"/&gt;

Consent under pressure: Given the economic grounds for voluntary euthanasia, critics of voluntary euthanasia are concerned that patients may experience psychological pressure to consent to voluntary euthanasia rather than be a financial burden on their families.&lt;ref&gt;"Terminally ill patients often fear being a burden to others and may feel they ought to request euthanasia to relieve their relatives from distress." letter to the editor of the ''Financial Times'' by Dr David Jeffrey, published 11 January 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Even where health costs are mostly covered by public money, as in most developed  countries, voluntary euthanasia critics are concerned that hospital personnel would have an economic incentive to advise or pressure people toward euthanasia consent.&lt;ref&gt;Prowse, Michael (4 January 2003). "THE FRONT LINE: Don't take liberties with the right to die" ''Financial Times'': "If euthanasia became socially acceptable, the sick would no longer be able to trust either doctors or their relatives: many of those earnestly counselling a painless, 'dignified' death would be doing so mainly on financial grounds. Euthanasia would become a euphemism for assisted murder."&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-voluntary euthanasia is sometimes cited as one of the possible outcomes of the [[euthanasia and the slippery slope|slippery slope]] argument, in which it is claimed that permitting voluntary euthanasia to occur will lead to the support and legalization of non-voluntary and [[involuntary euthanasia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Voluntary Euthanasia|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/euthanasia-voluntary/#Six|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=13 June 2010|date=29 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[right to life]] movement opposes voluntary euthanasia.

== Medical ethics  ==

Euthanasia brings about many ethical issues regarding a patient’s death. Some physicians say euthanasia is a rational choice for competent patients who wish to die to escape unbearable suffering.&lt;ref name="ass-sui"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://depts.washington.edu/bioethx/topics/pas.html#ques2 |title=Physician-Assisted Suicide: Ethical Topic in Medicine |publisher=depts.washington.edu |accessdate=2009-10-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170413165103/http://depts.washington.edu/bioethx/topics/pas.html#ques2 |archivedate=13 April 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physicians who are in favor of euthanasia state that to keep euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide (PAS) illegal is a violation of patient freedoms.  They believe that any competent terminally-ill patient should have the right to choose death or refuse life-saving treatment.&lt;ref name="ass-sui"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Royal Alexandra Hospital v Joseph and Ors [2005] NSWSC 422 (27 April 2005)"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/2005/422.html |title=Royal Alexandra Hospital v Joseph and Ors [2005] NSWSC 422) |publisher=austlii.edu.au |accessdate=2005-04-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Suicide and assistance from their physician is seen as the only option those patients have.&lt;ref name="ass-sui"/&gt; With the suffering and the knowledge from the doctor, this may also suggest that PAS is a humane answer to the excruciating pain.&lt;ref name="ass-sui"/&gt;

An argument against PAS is the violation of the [[Hippocratic oath]] that some doctors take.  The Hippocratic oath states "I will not give a lethal drug to anyone if I am asked, nor will I advise such a plan".&lt;ref name="ass-sui"/&gt;

Another reason for prohibiting PAS and euthanasia is the option of abusing PAS if it were to become legal.  Poor or uninsured patients may not have the money or no access to proper care will have limited options, and they could be pressured towards assisted death.&lt;ref name="ass-sui"/&gt;

== Legality ==
{{Main article|Legality of euthanasia}}
During the 20th century, efforts to change government policies on euthanasia have met limited success in Western countries. Euthanasia policies have also been developed by a variety of NGOs, most notably medical associations and advocacy organizations.

== Religion ==
{{Main article|Religious views on euthanasia}}
There are many different religious views on the issue of voluntary euthanasia, although many moral theologians are critical of the procedure.

== Protocols ==
{{See also|Lethal injection#Euthanasia protocol}}
Euthanasia can be accomplished either through an oral, intravenous, or intramuscular administration of drugs, or by oxygen deprivation ([[Hypoxia (medical)|anoxia]]), as in some [[euthanasia machine]]s. In individuals who are incapable of swallowing lethal doses of medication, an intravenous route is preferred. The following is a Dutch protocol for parenteral (intravenous) administration to obtain euthanasia:

Intravenous administration is the most reliable and rapid way to accomplish euthanasia. A coma is first induced by intravenous administration of 20&amp;nbsp;mg/kg [[sodium thiopental]] (Nesdonal) in a small volume (10 ml physiological saline). Then a triple intravenous dose of a non-depolarizing neuromuscular [[muscle relaxant]] is given, such as 20&amp;nbsp;mg [[pancuronium bromide]] (Pavulon) or 20&amp;nbsp;mg [[vecuronium bromide]] (Norcuron). The muscle relaxant should preferably be given intravenously, in order to ensure optimal availability. Only for pancuronium bromide (Pavulon) are there substantial indications that the agent may also be given intramuscularly in a dosage of 40&amp;nbsp;mg.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web | url = http://www.wweek.com/___ALL_OLD_HTML/euthanasics.html | title = Administration and Compounding Of Euthanasic Agents | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080607061147/http://wweek.com/___ALL_OLD_HTML/euthanasics.html | archivedate = 7 June 2008 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With regards to voluntary euthanasia, many people argue that 'equal access' should apply to access to suicide as well, so therefore disabled people who cannot kill themselves should have access to voluntary euthanasia.

== In the arts ==

Apart from ''[[The Old Law]]'', a 17th-century [[tragicomedy]] written by [[Thomas Middleton]], [[William Rowley]], and [[Philip Massinger]], one of the early books to deal with euthanasia in a fictional context is [[Anthony Trollope]]'s 1882 [[dystopia]]n novel, ''[[The Fixed Period]]''. [[Ricarda Huch]]'s novel ''[[The Deruga Case]]'' (1917) is about a physician who is acquitted after performing euthanasia on his dying ex-wife.

"Quality of Mercy" in ''The Prosecution Rests'' is a fable exploring the facets of aging, [[Alzheimer's disease]], and euthanasia.&lt;ref name="LL"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lundin|first=Leigh|title=The Prosecution Rests|editor=Fairstein, Linda|publisher=Little, Brown &amp; Company|location=New York|date=April 2009|series=MWA Anthologies|work=Quality of Mercy|pages=221–233|isbn=978-0-316-01252-2|url=http://www.hachettebookgroup.com/books_9780316012522_Description.htm|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091125111038/http://www.hachettebookgroup.com/books_9780316012522_Description.htm|archivedate=25 November 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story line makes no judgement but frees the reader to decide.

The plot of [[Christopher Buckley (novelist)|Christopher Buckley]]'s 2007 novel ''[[Boomsday (novel)|Boomsday]]'' involves the use of 'Voluntary euthanasia' of seniors as a political ploy to stave off the insolvency of [[Social Security (United States)|social security]] as more and more of the aging US population reaches retirement age.

The films ''[[Children of Men]]'' and ''[[Soylent Green]]'' depict instances of government-sponsored euthanasia in order to strengthen their dystopian themes. The protagonist of the film ''[[Johnny Got His Gun]]'' is a brutally mutilated war veteran whose request for euthanasia furthers the work's anti-war message. The recent films ''[[Mar Adentro]]'' and ''[[Million Dollar Baby]]'' argue more directly in favor of euthanasia by illustrating the suffering of their protagonists. These films have provoked debate and controversy in their home countries of Spain and the United States respectively.

In March 2010, the PBS ''[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]'' TV program in the United States showed a documentary called "The Suicide Tourist" which told the story of Professor Craig Ewert, his family, and the Swiss group [[Dignitas (euthanasia group)|Dignitas]], and their decision to help him commit assisted suicide in Switzerland after he was diagnosed and suffering with [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|ALS]] (Lou Gehrig's Disease).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/suicidetourist/ "The Suicide Tourist"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170916231103/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/suicidetourist/ |date=16 September 2017 }}, PBS FRONTLINE, 2 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thrash metal band [[Megadeth]]'s 1994 album ''[[Youthanasia]]'' (the title is a pun on euthanasia) implies that society is euthanizing its youth.

The documentary film ''[[How to Die in Oregon]]'' follows the lives of select terminally ill individuals who weigh the options of continuing to live and euthanasia.  This film employs emotional appeal to the audience on the controversial topic of voluntary euthanasia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.howtodieinoregon.com "How to Die in Oregon"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160207054053/http://www.howtodieinoregon.com/ |date=7 February 2016 }}.

{{Chinese name|[[Zeng (surname)|Zeng]]}}

'''Zeng Guofan, Marquis Yiyong''' ({{zh|t=曾國藩}} {{zh|p=Zēng Guófān}}; 26 November 1811 &amp;ndash; 12 March 1872), birth name '''Zeng Zicheng''', [[courtesy name]] '''Bohan''', was a Chinese statesman, military general, and [[Confucianism|Confucian]] scholar of the late [[Qing dynasty]]. He is best known for raising and organizing the [[Xiang Army]] to aid the Qing military in suppressing the [[Taiping Rebellion]] and restoring the stability of the Qing Empire. Along with other prominent figures such as [[Zuo Zongtang]] and [[Li Hongzhang]], Zeng set the scene for the [[Tongzhi Restoration]], an attempt to arrest the decline of the Qing dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Asian American encyclopedia, Volume 5|author=Franklin Ng|year=1995|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|edition=|location=|page=1457|isbn=1-85435-684-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zeng was known for his strategic perception, administrative skill and noble personality on Confucianist practice, but also for the ruthlessness of his repression of the rebellion. He exemplified loyalty in an era of chaos, but is also regarded as a precursor to the rise of warlordism. [[William T. Rowe]] describes him as the "de facto representative of Qing control in most of central and south China" during the 1850's and 60's.

==Early life==
[[File:Tseng Kuo-fan's Former Residence 020.JPG|thumb|Zeng's [[Zeng Guofan's Former Residence|former residence]] in [[Hunan]]]]
Born Zeng Zicheng in [[Xiangxiang]], [[Hunan|Hunan Province]] in 1811, Zeng was the grandson of [[Zeng Yuping]], a farmer with social and political ambitions. He was also a descendant of the philosopher [[Zengzi]], a student of [[Confucius]]. He studied in [[Yuelu Academy]] in [[Changsha|Changsha Prefecture]], where he passed the prefectural examination in 1833, only a year after his father, Zeng Linshu. He passed the provincial examination a year later, and by 1838, at age 27, he had successfully passed the [[imperial examination]], a prestigious achievement in China. He had earned the ''[[Jinshi (imperial examination)|jinshi]]'' degree, the highest level in the civil service examinations, which led to his appointment to the [[Hanlin Academy]], a body of outstanding Chinese literary scholars who performed literary tasks for the imperial court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=China voyager: Gist Gee's life in Science|author=William Joseph Haas|year=1996|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|location=|page=59|isbn=1-56324-675-9|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was at the Hanlin Academy where Zeng changed his [[Chinese given name|given name]] to "Guofan", which sounded more prestigious. Zeng served in [[Beijing]] for more than 13 years, and remained devoted to the interpretation of the [[Confucian classics]]. He moved relatively quickly up the ranks with the aid of his teacher, [[Mujangga]]; within five years, he had become a second-grade official.

==Entry into imperial politics==
In 1843, Zeng was appointed as the chief literary examiner in [[Sichuan|Sichuan Province]]. Six years later, he was made Senior Deputy Secretary of the [[Three Departments and Six Ministries|Board of Rites]]. When holding the office of Military Examiner (1851), he was compelled by the death of his mother to return to Hunan Province to carry out [[filial mourning]], which is supposed to last three years. Around the time, the [[Taiping Rebellion|Taiping rebels]] had overrun Hunan Province and captured the cities and strongholds on both shores of the [[Yangtze River]]. By a special decree, Zeng was ordered to assist the [[Xunfu|provincial governor]] in raising a volunteer force, and, on his own initiative, he built a fleet of war junks and multiple arsenals, with which he attacked the rebels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=China: a new history|author=John King Fairbank, Merle Goldman|year=2006|publisher=Harvard University Press|edition=2nd|location=|page=212|isbn=0-674-01828-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This force eventually became known as the [[Xiang Army]] (a.k.a. Hunan Army or Chu Army). In training and commanding the Xiang Army, Zeng emphasized "family ties, individual responsibility, flexible yet responsible disciple, enhanced military pay, respect for intellectuals serving in the army, and a strong bond between officers and soldiers."&lt;ref&gt;Maochun Yu, The Taiping Rebellion: A Military Assessment of Revolution and Counterrevolution, in A Military History of China 149 (David A. Graff &amp; Robin Higham eds., 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;  In his first engagement with the rebels, Zeng was defeated, but his lieutenants were more successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cast Chinese Coins|author=David Hartill|year=2005|publisher=Trafford Publishing|edition=|location=|page=425|isbn=1-4120-5466-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; They recovered the provincial capital, [[Changsha]], and destroyed the rebel fleet. Following up these victories of his subordinates, Zeng recaptured [[Wuchang, Hubei|Wuchang]] and [[Hanyang District|Hanyang]], near [[Hankou District|Hankou]], and was rewarded for his success by being appointed vice-president of the [[Three Departments and Six Ministries|Board of War]]. The Xiang Army under Zeng contained some integrated [[Hangzhou]] drill groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Orphan warriors: three Manchu generations and the end of the Qing world|author=Pamela Kyle Crossley|year=1991|publisher=Princeton University Press|edition=reprint, illustrated|location=|page=125|isbn=0-691-00877-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fame and military campaigns==
In 1853, other triumphs led to Zeng being made a ''[[baturu]]'', and to his being decorated with a [[Royal and noble ranks of the Qing dynasty#Other honours and privileges|yellow riding-jacket]]. Meanwhile, in his absence, the rebels retook [[Wuchang District|Wuchang]] and burnt the protecting fleet. The tide quickly turned, however, on May 1, 1854 Zeng defeated the Taiping at [[Xiangtan]] and in July at [[Yue Prefecture (Hunan)|Yuezhou]].&lt;ref&gt; Dillon, Michael. ''China: A Modern History''&lt;/ref&gt; Zeng succeeded in clearing the country round [[Poyang Lake]], and subsequently in ridding [[Jiangsu Province]] of the rebels. In January–February 1855 the Xiang Army sufferers a disastrous defeat at [[Jiujiang]], [[Jiangxi]], leading to Zeng attempting suicide. His father died in 1857, and after a brief mourning he was ordered to take supreme command in [[Zhejiang|Zhejiang Province]], and to cooperate with the governor of [[Fujian|Fujian Province]] in defence.

Subsequently, the rebels were driven westwards, and Zeng would have started in pursuit had he not been called on to clear [[Anhui|Anhui Province]] of rebel forces. In June 1860, he was appointed [[Viceroy of Liangjiang]] (covering [[Jiangxi]], [[Anhui]] and [[Jiangsu]] provinces) and [[Imperial Commissioner (China)|Imperial Commissioner]], overseeing military affairs. At this time, and for some time previously, he had been fortunate in having the active support of [[Zuo Zongtang]], who at a later period recovered [[Kashgar]] for the Qing Empire, and of [[Li Hongzhang]]. Like all true leaders of men, Zeng knew how to reward good service,{{cn|date=August 2018}} and when occasion offered he appointed the former to the governorship of Zhejiang and the latter to that of Jiangsu. In 1862, he was appointed [[Assistant Grand Secretary of State]]. At this time, the Qing imperial forces, assisted by the [[Ever Victorious Army]], had checked the progress of the Taiping Rebellion, and Zeng was able to carry out a scheme which he had long formulated of [[Third Battle of Nanking|besieging]] [[Nanjing|Tianjing]], the rebel capital. While [[Charles George Gordon]] of the Ever Victorious Army was clearing the cities on the lower waters of the Yangtze River with support from Li Hongzhang, Zeng drew closer his besieging lines around the city.

In July 1864, Tianjing fell into Zeng's hands, and he was rewarded with the [[Royal and noble ranks of the Qing dynasty#Non-imperial nobility|noble peerage]] "First Class Marquis Yiyong" (一等毅勇侯) and the right to wear the [[Royal and noble ranks of the Qing dynasty#Other honours and privileges|double-eyed peacock's feather]]. He, [[Zuo Zongtang]] and [[Li Hongzhang]] were collectively called "Zeng, Zuo, Li" – the military leaders who suppressed the Taiping Rebellion. After the suppression of the rebellion, the [[Nian Rebellion]], closely related{{dubious|date=July 2018}} to the former Taiping movement, broke out in [[Shandong|Shandong Province]], and Zeng was sent to quell it.

Success did not, however, always attend him on this campaign, and by imperial order he was relieved of his command by Li Hongzhang, who in the same way succeeded him as the [[Viceroy of Zhili]], where, after the [[Tianjin Massacre]] (1870), Zeng failed to carry out the wishes of the imperial court. Instead of the desired policy towards foreigners, Zeng took on a more diplomatic stance. After this rebuff, he retired to his viceroyalty at Nanjing, where he died in 1872 mysteriously in [[Hong Xiuquan]]'s former mansion.

==Personal life==
Zeng was a voluminous writer. His papers addressed to the throne and his literary disquisitions are held in high esteem by Chinese scholars, who treasure as the edition of his collected works in 156 books, which was edited by [[Li Hongzhang]] in 1876, as a memorial of a great and incorruptible statesman. Zeng enjoyed reading and held a special interest in the ''[[Twenty-Four Histories]]'' and other [[Chinese classics]]. He was also a dedicated poet and a diary author.

Zeng called [[Hakka people|Hakka]] females "big foot hillbilly witch(es)" during the [[Taiping Rebellion]] after his encountering with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=New China's long march from servility to freedom|author=Wei-Bin Zhang|year=2007|publisher=Nova Science Publishers|location=|page=44|isbn=1-60021-791-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike his contemporaries, who had multiple wives or kept [[concubine]]s, Zeng was officially married only once, to a woman of the [[Ouyang]] family when he was in his late teens. His wife was known to be a capable woman. He had three sons and five daughters with her, and two of his eldest children died young. His eldest son, [[Zeng Jize]], who inherited his [[Royal and noble ranks of the Qing dynasty#Non-imperial nobility|noble peerage]] "First Class Marquis Yiyong", went on to become a famous diplomat in the late Qing dynasty.

Zeng's ninth brother, [[Zeng Guoquan]], was an ambitious general in the [[Xiang Army]]. He was later appointed [[Viceroy of Liangjiang]] in 1884. Zeng's great-granddaughter, [[Zeng Baosun]], was a feminist, historian, and Christian educator.

Zeng is said to be a descendant of [[Zengzi]], which in turn is a descendant of King [[Shao Kang]] of the [[Xia Dynasty]].

==Legacy==
Zeng's legacy in history is twofold. On one hand he is criticised as a staunchly conservative traitor, but on another he is seen as a hero in preserving order and stability. Many in China and abroad admire his ability to successfully survive in the ruthless bureaucracy of the late Qing dynasty. Many have blamed Zeng for all the civilian losses and damages done during the [[Taiping Rebellion]], while others criticise him for being too friendly with certain foreign ideas.

Since the [[Cultural Revolution]], criticism of Zeng gradually began to disappear. [[Tang Haoming]] published in 1992 his three-book trilogy ''Zeng Guofan'', a novelisation of Zeng's life during and after the Taiping Rebellion. This trilogy characterised Zeng as a common person, but had adopted a much more positive view of Zeng. [[Mao Zedong]] and [[Chiang Kai-shek]] also praised Zeng's ability in military and political affairs.

In recent years, Zeng's life and his works have been widely celebrated, especially as an example of local pride in [[Hunan|Hunan Province]]. Zeng's leadership and military skills had been used by many as a new field of thought aiding in business or bureaucratic dealings, as in the "self-help" ''99 Strategems from Zeng Guofan''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Platt|first=Stephen R.|year=2007|title=Provincial Patriots: The Hunanese and Modern China|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=9780674026650|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
