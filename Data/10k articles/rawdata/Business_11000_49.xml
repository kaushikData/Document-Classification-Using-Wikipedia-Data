The '''''American School Board Journal''''' is a monthly [[trade magazine]] on school administration established in 1891 by the United States [[National School Boards Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Delpit shines a light on education in the inner-city |url=http://www.subr.edu/index.cfm/newsroom/detail/408 |accessdate=7 April 2013 |newspaper=Southern University |date=1 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Scope ==
[[File:Heaton School Board Journal April 1922 Cover.png|thumb|Illustration of how placement of school pupils into classes changed after widespread use of [[IQ test]]s, from cover of April 1922, '''American School Board Journal'''.]]

The focus of the ''American School Board Journal'' is on the challenges of [[K–12 (education)|K-12]] [[State school|public schools]] and topics related to school leadership, governance, management, policy making, and student achievement.

== Magna Awards ==
The ''American School Board Journal'' organizes the "Magna Awards" which is an annual program to showcase [[school district]]s and projects in the United States which are examples of innovation and excellence in school governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Magna Awards |url=http://www.asbj.com/magna |publisher=National School Boards Association |accessdate=6 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program was started in 1995 by the magazine with an objective to highlight [[Board of education|school boards]] that improve educational programs by taking remarkable steps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Cullotta |first=Karen Ann |title=1st Year Results In National Award For Choice School |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2000-04-19/news/0004190244_1_new-school-pupil-magna-awards |accessdate=7 April 2013 |newspaper=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the Magna Awards program is co-sponsored by the National School Boards Association and [[Sodexo]]. 

Nominees are separated into three categories based on the size of their school districts: enrollment under 5,000, from 5,000-20,000, and over 20,000. In each category, there is one grand prize winner, five additional awards and five honorable mentions. The criteria of judging include the involvement of the school board, the success of the projects, the ability to replicate in other school districts, and the advancement of student learning.&lt;ref name="whatis"&gt;{{cite web |title=What is Magna? |url=http://www.asbj.com/MainMenuCategory/Supplements/MagnaAwards/WhatisMagna.aspx |publisher=National School Boards Association |accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards and recognition ==
The ''American School Board Journal'' received the following awards:
* Two articles from the magazine were finalists of the ''[[National Magazine Awards]]'' in 1980 and 1984 in the categories of "Specialized Journalism" and "Public Service" respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=National Magazine Awards: Winners and Finalists |url=http://www.magazine.org/asme/national-magazine-awards/winners-finalists |publisher=American Society of Magazine Editors |accessdate=6 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''André Thierstein Heinz''' (born December 9, 1969) is an [[United States|American]] environmentalist.

Heinz is a son of Senator [[H. John Heinz III|Henry John Heinz III]] and businesswoman/philanthropist [[Teresa Heinz|Maria Teresa Thierstein Simões-Ferreira]]. He has a younger brother named [[Christopher Heinz|Christopher]] and an elder brother Henry IV. André is a stepson of former [[U.S. Secretary of State]] and former presidential candidate [[John Kerry]], and stepbrother of [[Alexandra Kerry]] and [[Vanessa Kerry]].

André Heinz has been active in the field of [[sustainable development]] since 1993, when he began working for William McDonough, the noted green architect and designer, on sustainable design issues and projects. At the same time, Heinz joined the board of The Heinz Endowments, where he oversaw the creation of an environmental grant-making program through a series of 14 topical environmental colloquia that convened leaders from around the world. He continues to serve on the Endowments board and on its Joint Investment Committee, which oversees the management of the $1.5 billion endowment.

Following a six-month urban redevelopment project for the City of [[Pittsburgh]], where he applied his knowledge together with colleagues at [[Carnegie Mellon University]], Heinz began research for [[Paul Hawken]] on his latest book titled "Natural Capitalism." It chronicles examples of 75 percent or greater [[resource productivity]] at zero-to-negative cost, and suggests principles to help replicate those successes. Simultaneously, Heinz co-founded in 1995 the first U.S. office of [[The Natural Step]], a Sweden-based nonprofit organization specialized in education and consulting around sustainable development.

In 1999, after receiving a masters in environmental management at the [[Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies]], where he specialized in industrial environmental management and industrial ecology, Heinz accepted a job offer to run the international office of The Natural Step in Stockholm. In 2004, Heinz left [[The Natural Step]] to focus on U.S. presidential politics as a surrogate spokesperson specializing in environmental policy and issues. Since then, he has turned his attention yet again to Scandinavia as the founder of Sustainable Technology Capital, a growth-stage, private equity management firm focused on Nordic Cleantech.

André is married to Maria.

[[File:Architecture of Interoperable Information Systems.gif|thumb|right|Architecture of Interoperable Information Systems]]
The '''Architecture of Interoperable Information Systems (AIOS)''' is a reference architecture for the development of interoperable [[enterprise information systems]]. If enterprises or public administrations want to engage in automated business processes with other organizations, their IT systems must be able to work together, i.e. they need to be [[interoperability|interoperable]]. The AIOS represents a generic building plan for these organizations to develop interoperable information systems by systematically adjusting and extending their internal information systems.
The AIOS was described in a doctoral thesis and is based on the results of various research projects on interoperability.&lt;ref&gt;Ziemann (2010): [http://www.logos-verlag.de/cgi-bin/buch/isbn/2414 Architecture of Interoperable Information Systems - An enterprise Model-based Approach for Describing and Enacting Collaborative Business Processes.] Logos, 2010. A summary can be found here: Ziemann (2012): Architecture of Interoperable Information Systems - Reference Architecture for Collaborations between Public Administrations. In: Krallmann, H., Zapp, A. (Eds.): Bausteine einer vernetzten Verwaltung. Berlin, Erich Schmidt Verlag, 2012, pp. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; It is independent from specific products or vendors but describes generically the different layers, views, relationships and technical means needed to efficiently establish interoperable information systems. To this aim it combines concepts from [[service-oriented architecture]], Collaborative Business and [[Business Process Modelling]]. It can be seen as complementary to [[Architecture of Integrated Information Systems|ARIS]], a well-known architecture for internal information systems and business processes.

== Definition ==
Similar to the automation of processes inside organizations, the automation of cross-organizational [[business process]]es is an important trend. In this endeavor, collaborating organizations rather strive for a loose coupling of their information systems instead of a tight [[system integration|integration]]: the collaborating information systems should be able to work together but retain as much independency as possible. This characteristic is also called '''[[interoperability]]''', or in the context of collaborating organizations, [[Business Interoperability Interface#Business interoperability|Business Interoperability]], i.e. the capability of autonomous organizations to execute a collaborative business process among them.

'''[[Information system]]s''' are systems that process information, i.e. they capture, transport, transform, store and offer information. Following the conception prevailing in information systems research, an information system comprises not only the hardware and software of an enterprise, but also the related human actors, business functions and processes as well as organization structures.&lt;ref&gt;Compare for example Becker &amp; Schütte (2004, p. 33): Handelsinformationssysteme – Domänenorientierte Einführung in die Wirtschaftsinformatik 2nd Edition, Redline Wirtschaft, Frankfurt or Gabriel(2008): Informationssystem. Enzyklopädie der Wirtschaftsinformatik, Online Lexikon. Oldenbourg Wissenschaftsverlag, Germany.&lt;/ref&gt; This broad understanding is for example also embodied by the [[Zachman Framework]].

'''[[Architecture]]''' is defined as the “fundamental organization of a system, embodied in its components, their relationships to each other and the environment, and the principles governing its design and evolution”.&lt;ref&gt;IEEE (2007): IEEE 1471 Website, IEEE Std. 1471 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) - Version 5.0, 19 July 2007. http://www.iso-architecture.org/ieee-1471/ieee-1471-faq.html, ac-cessed: May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Sinz defines an information system architecture as the building plan of an information system in the sense of a specification and documentation of its components and their relationships covering all relevant viewpoints as well as the constructions rules for the creation of the building plan.&lt;ref&gt;Sinz (2002): Architektur von Informationssystemen. In: Rechenberg, P., Pomberger, G. (eds.): Informatik-Handbuch. 3rd Edition, Hanser, München, pp. 1055-1068&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordingly, an '''Architecture of Interoperable Information Systems''' can be defined as the building plan of a cross-organizational information system, which enables organizations to execute a collaborative business process among them.

== Background and Application ==
Following the work on interoperable information systems conducted in European Research Projects&lt;ref&gt;Interop NOE (2004 to 2007, project number IST-2004-508011), ATHENA (2004 to 2007, “Advanced Technologies for Interoperability of Heterogeneous Enterprise Networks and their Application”, project number IST-2004-507849) or R4eGov (2006 to 2009, project number IST-2004-026650)&lt;/ref&gt; in 2010 the Architecture of Interoperable Information Systems (AIOS) was published as a reference for the construction of loosely coupled, interoperating information systems and for the systematic, model-based enactment of collaborative business processes.

The AIOS aims primarily at large organizations that want to interoperate with each other. To this aim it describes how internal information system elements can be systematically connected with the information systems of collaboration partners. The main elements of the AIOS are:
# Description of the different data types comprised in interoperable information system as well as their relationships. This is also called the '''static''' part, or the ''structure'' of the architecture. It tells organizations which information elements (e.g. descriptions of messages, exchange sequences, roles and services) they have to provide to collaboration partners and how they can optimally correlate these to internal elements.
# Description of different building paths for implementing or adjusting interoperable information systems. This is also called the '''dynamic''' part of the architecture. It tells organization, how to iteratively develop the elements mentioned above.
# Concept for the technical '''components needed to implemenent''' the architecture, for example design tools, internal and externally visible repositories.
One element comprised in the third category is a '''"BII-repository"''', in which each organization publishes the content of its [[Business Interoperability Interface]] (BII) to collaboration partners. Since it comprises external views on information system elements, it provides publishing and discovery functionalities as needed in [[service-oriented architecture]]: In the BII, the externally relevant processes, services, organization structures etc. are described on various levels of technical granularity, enabling other organizations to search also for business-level elements and not only for technical artifacts. Here, different from the traditional SOA approach, instead of one central service directory, various partner-specific repositories are implemented.

== Structure ==
The static part of the architecture builds on three orthogonal axes: Enterprise Dimensions, Levels of technical Granularity and Colloborative Views.

=== Collaborative views ===
Similar to private, public and global views as known from business process and workflow modeling, in the AIOS, corresponding private, public and global views on information system elements are provided.
# The '''private view''' comprises the only internally visible information system elements.
# The '''public view''' acts as an interface to the internal, private system elements; it protects internal systems and enables interoperability without the need for a significant change to the internal systems. This public view describes the information system boundaries of an organization to its collaboration partners and connects internal and external information systems, thereby also providing the content of the [[Business Interoperability Interface]] of an organization.
# The '''global view''' can be used to correlate and connect the public views of different systems.

=== Enterprise dimensions ===
[[File:AIOS Enterprise Dimensions.JPG|thumb|Illustration of the Architecture of Interoperable Information Systems / Enterprise Dimensions]]
To describe business processes comprehensively this axis provides distinct views on processes, functions, data, and organizational elements. 
# In the '''organizational dimension''', roles, units and other organization elements relevant for the collaboration are described and related to internal elements. This ensures for example, that the collaboration partners have a common understanding of the interacting roles.
# In the '''data dimension''', document types used in the collaboration are defined and related to internally used document types. 
# In the '''function dimension''', business functions and services offered in the collaboration are described. 
# In the '''process dimension''', the processes that each organization offers are described as well as how these public processes are related to adjacent processes of partner organizations.
Thus, in combination with the axis "collaborative views",  '''private, public and global views on processes, functions, data, and organizational roles''' are provided.

=== Levels of technical granularity ===
[[File:AIOS Levels of technical detail.JPG|thumb|AIOS Levels of technical detail]]
The description of system elements on different levels of technical granularity supports a systematic development of collaborative information systems, starting with the business requirements definition and going all the way down to the code level. Apart from the construction aspect, thereby also a multi-dimensional interoperability description is provided, facilitating the synchronization of collaborating systems on each level. Similar to for example [[Architecture of Integrated Information Systems|ARIS]] and OMG's [[Model-driven architecture|MDA]] three levels are used:
# '''Business Level''': Here the processes to be automated are described from a technique independent level. In MDA this level is referred to as CIM level.
# '''Technical Level''': Here the IT concept is described. Therefore, the models from the first level are technically enriched, for example, instead of business functions now components are described, but still on a coarse-grained, conceptual level. Since the models on the second level represent the basis for an automated generation of executable code, they might have to be further adapted to fit implementation level constraints.
# '''Execution Level''': Here the models are machine interpretable and can be used during runtime in the execution of processes.

A '''benefit shortfall''' results from the actual benefits of a venture being lower than the projected, or estimated, benefits of that venture. If, for instance, a company is launching a new product or service and projected sales are 40 million dollars per year, whereas actual annual sales turn out to be only 30 million dollars, then the benefit shortfall is said to be 25 percent. Sometimes the terms "'''demand shortfall'''" or "'''revenue shortfall'''" are used instead of benefit shortfall.

Public and private enterprises alike fall victim to benefit shortfalls. Prudent planning of new ventures will include the risk of benefit shortfalls in [[risk assessment]] and [[risk management]].

The discipline of [[benefits realisation management]] seeks to identify any benefits shortfall as early as possible in a project or programmes delivery in order to allow corrective action to be taken, costs to be controlled and benefits realised.

'''''Bonsai Barber''''' is a [[video game]] developed by [[Zoonami]] for [[Wii]]. It was released in North America on March 30, 2009, in Europe on August 7, 2009 and in Japan on April 6, 2010.

==Overview==

The game places players in the role of a [[barber]] who must groom and style the foliage of their plant, fruit and vegetable customers in similar manner to the art of [[bonsai]] pruning. Using the [[Wii Remote]], the player uses tools such as scissors, hair clippers, combs and hairspray to work on the requests of up to five customers per day and try to achieve a professional five star rated cut for each.

The game also features unlockable modes and rewards as well as an achievement system, and players will be able to send photos of their stylings to friends via [[WiiConnect24]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://wii.ign.com/articles/967/967075p1.html IGN First Look: Bonsai Barber]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
Three prototypes of the game were developed on and off by a team of two people before the game moved into full development. In total, development for ''Bonsai Barber'' stretched over a period of two and a quarter years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/4107/from_me_to_wii_martin_hollis_.php?page=4 From Me to Wii: Martin Hollis' Journey]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[IGN]] commended the tight, responsive controls and the quirky nature of the game, but also called it a pricey one trick pony.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wii.ign.com/articles/968/968200p1.html IGN review]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Official Nintendo Magazine]]'' loved the concept and the humor and called it "an enjoyable, idiosyncratic experience".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/article.php?id=10501 ONM review]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Johan Carl Kempe''' (8 December 1884 – 8 July 1967) was leader of the [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[pulp and paper industry]] [[Mo och Domsjö AB]] and involved in several other companies in the large economic sphere of the Kempe family. He was also a silver medalist in tennis at the [[1912 Summer Olympics]] in [[Stockholm]].&lt;ref name="sports-reference"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/ke/carl-kempe-1.html |title=Carl Kempe |work=sports-reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sok&gt;[http://sok.se/idrottare/idrottare/c/carl-kempe.html Carl Kempe]. Swedish Olympic Committee&lt;/ref&gt;

Carl Kempe was born in Stockholm, son of [[Frans Kempe]]. He finished secondary school at [[Norra latinläroverket]] in Stockholm, studied at [[Uppsala University]] 1903–1905 and started to work for [[Mo och Domsjö]] in 1906. He succeeded his father as CEO of Mo och Domsjö in 1917. While the company he took over from his father had retained many traits of a traditional [[lumber]] producer, Carl Kempe was, through large investments in research and development, chiefly responsible for its transformation into a modern [[chemical industry]].&lt;ref name=sok/&gt;

Kempe himself claimed that he spent his time at university in Uppsala mostly with playing tennis, attending dancing lessons and playing cards; the first of these pastimes, at least, led to his winning a [[tennis]] silver medal at the [[1912 Summer Olympics]] in [[Stockholm]] in the men's indoor doubles event (with [[Gunnar Setterwall]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1261">A ''''concert party'''' is a group of people acting in concert in a [[takeover bid]]. In the UK, there are rules for such bids, regulated by regulators such as the [[Panel on Takeovers and Mergers|Takeover Panel]].

There is a 30% threshold at which a [[Mandatory Offer]] must be made. This is considered to be reached when a concert party jointly hold 30% of the shares in a company, not when one of them does. The same applies to other financial instrument holdings such as derivatives.
Some entities are presumed to be acting in concert unless shown otherwise. These include the directors, subsidiaries, associate companies and the parent company of the bidder.

Even entities that are not part of a concert party may find that rules applying to them: they are required to disclose dealings in the share of the bidder or the target. These "associates" are people who have an interest in the outcome of the bid (other than simply as shareholders) but who are not deliberately acting in concert with the bidder, An example of associates are the directors the target company even when they are not acting in concert with either the bidder or a potential counter-bidder.

Louis DeSalvio served as [[New York State Assembly|Second District New York State Assemblyman]]. The [[City of New York]] acquired the property in 1954 and turned it over to the Parks department. The playground opened on December 15, 1955 as "John DeSalvio Park".&lt;ref name="nycgovparks1"/&gt;

'''Downtown New Haven''' is the neighborhood located in the heart of the city of [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], [[Connecticut]]. It is made up of the original nine squares laid out in 1638 to form New Haven, including the [[New Haven Green]], and the immediate surrounding central business district, as well as a significant portion of the [[Yale University]] campus.  The area includes many restaurants, cafes, theaters and stores.  Downtown is bordered by [[Wooster Square]] to the east, [[Long Wharf (New Haven)|Long Wharf]] to the southeast, the [[Hill (New Haven)|Hill]] neighborhood to the south, the [[Dwight (neighborhood)|Dwight]] neighborhood to the west, the [[Dixwell (New Haven)|Dixwell]] neighborhood to the northwest, the [[Prospect Hill (New Haven)|Prospect Hill]] area to the north, and [[East Rock (neighborhood)|East Rock]] to the northeast.

Downtown New Haven is one of the most residential downtown areas in the United States, with nearly 7,000 inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityofnewhaven.com New Haven Comprehensive Plan]&lt;/ref&gt; The expansion of housing options in recent years has helped support downtown businesses and has brought about a surge in economic activity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/03/realestate/an-infusion-of-energy-in-yales-backyard.html Living In: Downtown New Haven; An Infusion of Energy in Yale's Backyard], Eleanor Charles, ''The New York Times'', April 3, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Secondary streets and areas at the periphery of the neighborhood that once contained vacant storefronts are now almost entirely leased to restaurants and retailers, and the office vacancy rate has dramatically fallen as well.

==Geography==
Downtown New Haven is divided into several independent sections centered on the [[New Haven Green]]. This basic structure is a remnant of the 1638 New Haven Plan. The main campus of [[Yale University]], which is located to the north and east of the Green, is sometimes considered distinct from but intermingled with Downtown.

===Chapel Street===
[[File:Chapel Street, New Haven.png|thumb|right|Shops along Chapel Street]]
The area bounded by Chapel and Crown Streets is a popular stretch of restaurants, boutiques and bars located across from the Old Campus of Yale University. Includes such historic establishments as Union League Cafe and the c. 1934 Owl Shop cigar lounge. The [[Anchor Bar (New Haven)|Anchor Bar]], notable for its [[Art Moderne]] style and popularity with playwright [[Thornton Wilder]], operated on College Street from the 1940s until 2015.

The area is largely coterminous with the [[Chapel Street Historic District]]. Notable buildings include the [[Hotel Taft (New Haven)|Hotel Taft]] and the [[Chapel Square Mall]]. The [[Yale University Art Gallery]] and [[Yale Center for British Art]] are also located here.

===Broadway===
[[File:Broadway Triangle, New Haven.jpg|thumb|right|Broadway Triangle, at the center of the Broadway area]]
The Broadway area is a commercial center that has since the 1990s been bought piece-by-piece by Yale University and redeveloped into ''The Shops at Yale'' shopping district. This section was previously notable as home of the [[Yankee Doodle Coffee Shop]] and Cutlers Records.

===Ninth Square===
The Ninth Square district, which contains the blocks southeast of the New Haven Green, has experienced a resurgence as a nightlife and arts district since the first decade of the 21st century.

The majority of buildings within these blocks are preserved as the [[Ninth Square Historic District]].

===Whitney Avenue===
[[File:Whitney Ave, New Haven.jpg|thumb|right|Whitney Avenue]]
The Whitney Avenue corridor, north of the New Haven Green, contains shops and eateries that are primarily owned by [[Yale University]] and cater to its student population. This area serves as a center for New Haven's [[East Asia|East Asian]] community, with several restaurants and grocery stores catering to this population and an annual [[Chinese New Year]] festival parading up Whitney Avenue.

==Notable sites==
* Center Church on the Green Crypt, the best-preserved burial ground in the country (because it lies underneath a church), with gravestones dating back to the mid-17th century that include numerous colonial luminaries.
* [[Chapel Street Historic District]], an area southwest of the Green containing many shops, restaurants, night clubs, bars, art museums, theaters, and book stores. The district is listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and includes areas along Crown Street.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14044">[[Image:Eamcilhenny.jpg|thumb|right|Edward Avery McIlhenny, circa 1930.]]
'''Edward Avery "Ned" McIlhenny''' (29 March 1872 &amp;ndash; 8 August 1949), son of [[Tabasco sauce|Tabasco brand pepper sauce]] tycoon [[Edmund McIlhenny]], was an American [[businessman]], [[explorer]], [[Bird ringing|bird bander]] and [[conservation movement|conservationist]]. He established a private wildlife refuge around his family estate on [[Avery Island]] and helped in preserving a large coastal marshland in Louisiana as a bird refuge. He also introduced several exotic plants into [[Jungle Gardens]], his private wildlife garden. McIlhenny is sometimes blamed for the introduction of exotic [[coypu]] into Louisiana where they are a major ecological problem although it is now known that he was neither the first to introduce their farming in the area or to release them into the wild.

==Biography ==
Born in 1872 at [[Avery Island]], [[Louisiana]], where the families of his father Edmund McIlhenny and his mother Mary Eliza Avery had lived since 1813,  McIlhenny was educated privately before attending Wyman's Military Academy in Illinois and [[Dr. Holbrook's Military School]] in Sing Sing (now [[Ossining (village), New York|Ossining]]), [[New York (state)|New York]]. In 1892, McIlhenny enrolled at [[Lehigh University]], where he joined the [[Phi Delta Theta]] fraternity, but he dropped out of school to join [[Frederick Cook]]'s 1894 Arctic expedition as an [[ornithologist]]. The expedition ended when their ship ''Miranda'' was wrecked off Greenland. In 1897, he financed his own Arctic expedition to [[Point Barrow]], [[Alaska]],&lt;ref name="copeia"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Cagle, Fred R.|year=1950|title=Edward Avery McIlhenny|journal=Copeia|issue=3|pages=245–246|jstor=1438530}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he leased an old government station, built to accommodate 100 men in an emergency and now owned by the Pacific Steam Whaling Company. During the famous rescue of a stranded Japanese [[whaling]] fleet, McIlhenny refused to house any of the rescued sailors except a few officers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal= Harper's New Monthly Magazine| title=The Rescue Of The Whalers. A Sled Journey Of 1600 Miles In The Arctic Regions.|author=Bertholf, Lt. Ellsworth P.| date=June 1899|url=http://www.arcticwebsite.com/WhalerRescue.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[adventurer]] and [[entrepreneur]] [[Jujiro Wada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=John |last=Bockstoce|title=The Arctic Whaling Disaster of 1897|year=1978|place=New York|publisher=Explorers Club|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shane K. Bernard, ''Tabasco: An Illustrated History'' (Avery Island, La.: McIlhenny Company, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; He did provide cotton intended for taxidermic purposes for bedding.&lt;ref name="auk"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lowery, George H., Jr.|year=1951|title=Edward Avery McIlhenny|url=https://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/auk/v068n01/p0135-p0137.pdf|journal=The Auk|volume=68|issue=1|page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On his return from the second Arctic expedition, he married Mary Givens Matthews, daughter of William Henry Matthews and Mary Campbell Given, on June 6, 1900, in New Orleans, Louisiana.&lt;ref name="copeia" /&gt;

==Businessman==
[[Image:Tabad(ca1905).jpg|thumb|left|150px|An advertisement for [[Tabasco sauce|Tabasco]] pepper sauce from circa 1905, during Edward Avery McIlhenny's tenure as president of McIlhenny Company.]]
In 1898, Edward's elder brother John enlisted in the U.S. Army, eventually joining the [[Rough Riders]]. Edward took over the family business, McIlhenny's Son Corporation, which produced Tobasco, the hot-pepper sauce invented by his father some 30 years previously. Edward renamed the firm [[McIlhenny Company]] and began to expand, modernize, and standardized sauce production. He also experimented with new ways of promoting the world-famous product, such as advertising on [[radio]].

In 1927, McIlhenny replaced the cork-topped Tabasco bottles used for nearly six decades with the now-ubiquitous screw-top bottle. He also redesigned the iconic Tabasco diamond logo trademark, largely creating the version known today.

In 1939, McIlhenny and the governor of Louisiana [[Richard W. Leche|Richard Leche]] were sued for transgressions in the issue of a contract to McIlhenny for the landscaping of Louisiana State University campus. An amount of $27,351.01 was claimed but nobody was convicted after the Supreme Court held that special skills did not require competitive bidding and that services worth that amount had been delivered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://casetext.com/case/louisiana-v-mcilhenny|title=Louisiana v. McIlhenny, 201 La. 78 (La. 1942)|last=|first=|date=|website=CaseText|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nutria farming and release==
In a venture unrelated to Tabasco sauce, McIlhenny also operated a [[Coypu|nutria]] (''Myocastor coypus'') farm on Avery Island from 1938 until his death. The nutria introduction began in collaboration with Armand P. Daspit, director of the Louisiana Department of Conservation's Fur and Wild Life Division who approached McIlhenny after reading a bulletin on them from Buenos Aires. Another couple, Susan and Captain H. Conrad Brote began a nutria farm at St. Tammany Parish from around 1933. The captain served on merchant ships running between New Orleans and Buenos Aires. Their farm did well but there were no sales and they let out their nutria even before McIlhenny had begun his operations from locally acquired stock. Another nutria farm was also begun around the same time in St. Bernard Parish from where McIlhenny's first nutria were obtained in 1938. McIlhenny's nutria farm quickly grew too large for their one-acre pen and he was surprised both by their prolific breeding and the difficulties in confining them to their pens. On June 1, 1940 he freed about twenty nutria. In 1945 he released all his nutria claiming that it would help establish a fur industry in Louisiana.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor=233862|first=Shane K. |last=Bernard|title=M'sieu Ned's Rat? Reconsidering the Origin of Nutria in Louisiana: The E. A. McIlhenny Collection, Avery Island, Louisiana|journal=Louisiana History|volume= 43 |year=2002|pages= 281–293}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, state and federal agencies advocated these releases. They believed nutria would provide a profitable new [[fur]] resource and help manage the spread of overly abundant plants such as [[water hyacinth]] and [[alligator weed]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

After these releases, the [[feral]] population became unmanageable, and its overwhelmingly harmful impact on Louisiana's wetlands became apparent. Nutria feed on vegetation that is crucial to sustaining Louisiana's [[coastline]] and protecting the state's [[sugarcane]] and [[rice]] fields. By 1960, the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries estimated the nutria population along coastal regions to exceed 20 million. The latest report from the [[U.S. Department of the Interior]] estimates that {{convert|100000|acre|km2}} of Louisiana's coastal wetlands are currently being occupied by nutria.

[[File:E_A_McIlhenny.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait from ''Bird Lore'' (1916)]]
After the first Arctic expedition, he noticed on returning to Avery Island, a great decline in the number of egrets. This led him to conduct experiments in captive breeding. McIlhenny founded the [[Bird City (wildfowl refuge)|Bird City]] [[wildlife refuge|wildfowl refuge]] on Avery Island around 1895, which helped to save the [[snowy egret]] from extinction. In 1910, McIlhenny and [[Charles Willis Ward]] bought {{convert|57000|acre|km2}} of marshland and later an additional {{convert|13000| acre|km2}}; on November 4, 1911, they dedicated the marsh to the state of Louisiana as a wildlife refuge. McIlhenny persuaded Mrs [[Russell Sage Foundation|Russell Sage]] to purchase {{convert|75000|acre|km2}} of Marsh Island on July 22, 1912, and the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] to acquire an additional {{convert|86000| acre|km2}} nearby. This created a bird reserve of about {{convert|174663| acre|km2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= The Great McIlhenny Project|pages=65–66 |url= https://archive.org/stream/audubonnati18nati#page/65/mode/1up| journal=Bird Lore| volume=18| issue=1| year=1916}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McIlhenny was keen to study the birds on his estate and began bird ringing in 1912, initially using his own bands made of tin and lead on ducks, but he received few recoveries. In February 1916, he began to use bands issued by the American Bird Banding Association. Over 22 years,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.2307/4077660 |jstor=4077660 |title=Twenty-Two Years of Banding Migratory Wild Fowl at Avery Island, Louisiana |journal=The Auk |volume=51 |issue=3 |pages=328 |year=1934 |last1=McIlhenny |first1=E. A }}&lt;/ref&gt; he [[bird banding|banded]] more than 189,298 birds.&lt;ref name="auk" /&gt; Based on his ringing studies he camed to the conclusion that sex-ratios in ducks were skewed in the wild with males surviving to a greater age than females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=McIlhenny, E.A.|year=1940|title=Sex Ratio in Wild Birds|url=https://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/auk/v057n01/p0085-p0093.pdf|journal=The Auk|volume=57|issue=1|pages=85–93|doi=10.2307/4078851}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later studies based on McIlhenny's ringing data have yielded considerable information on the movements of [[black vulture]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Parmalee, P.W.|author2=Parmalee, B.G.|year=1967|title=Results of banding studies of the black vulture in eastern North America|url=https://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/condor/v069n02/p0146-p0155.pdf|journal=Condor|volume=69|issue=2|pages=146–155|doi=10.2307/1366604}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, he wrote on the potential extinction of the [[ivory-billed woodpecker]], noting its presence in his estate on Avery Island and suggesting that the destruction of old growth forests was key to its demise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/4078664|jstor=4078664|title=The Passing of the Ivory-Billed Woodpecker|journal=The Auk|volume=58|issue=4|pages=582|year=1941|last1=McIlhenny|first1=E. A}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subspecies of [[white-tailed deer]] on Avery Island was named after McIlhenny as ''Odocoileus virginianus mcilhennyi'' by Frederic W. Miller in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=Frederic W.|date=1928|title=A New White-Tailed Deer from Louisiana|jstor=1373358|journal=Journal of Mammalogy|volume=9|issue=1|pages=57–59|doi=10.2307/1373358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McIlhenny used his {{convert|170|acre|km2|adj=on}} personal estate, known as [[Jungle Gardens]], to propagate both Louisiana-native and imported plant varieties, including [[azaleas]], [[iris (plant)|irises]], [[camellias]], [[papyrus]], and [[bamboo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=McIlhenny, E.A.|year=1945|title=Bamboo Growing for the South.|journal=The National Horticultural Magazine|volume=24|pages=1–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=McIlhenny, E.A.|year=1945|title=Bamboo: A Must for the South.|journal=The National Horticultural Magazine|volume=24|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote numerous academic articles, mainly about [[birds]] and [[reptiles]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McIlhenny|first=E. A.|date=1934|title=Notes on Incubation and Growth of Alligators|jstor=1435797|journal=Copeia|volume=1934|issue=2|pages=80–88|doi=10.2307/1435797}}&lt;/ref&gt; oversaw the publication in English of two European botanical treatises, and edited Charles L. Jordan's unfinished manuscript ''The Wild Turkey and Its Hunting'' (a book often mistakenly attributed to McIlhenny). He supported the equality of women but suggested that there were evolutionary handicaps standing in the way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.jhered.a103852|title=A Brief for the Y-Chromosome|journal=Journal of Heredity|volume=25|issue=10|pages=406|year=1934|last1=McIlhenny|first1=E.A}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote books about [[alligators]] (in which he claimed to have shot the longest American alligator 19 feet long), [[egrets]], and [[African-American]] [[gospel music]], including:

==Death and legacy==

McIlhenny died in 1949, three years after suffering a debilitating [[stroke]]; he is buried on Avery Island. Today, Jungle Gardens and Bird City continue to serve as havens for bird and plant species; they are also popular tourist destinations.  Furthermore, the nearly {{convert|175000|acre|km2}} of coastal marshland he helped to set aside as wildfowl refuges continue to exist as state wildlife areas.  McIlhenny's illustrated and written documentation of plant and animal life on Avery Island was donated as a collection to [[Louisiana State University]]. The E. A. McIlhenny Collection of natural history books at [[Louisiana State University]] is named in his honor.

When her family moved back to Herat after the Taliban fell, she brought two carloads of equipment to start gyms for women in Herat.

| quote=Female representation was the only area in which SNTV actually proved to have a positive effect. The quota mechanism, which ensured that a total of 68 women were elected (on average two per province), remained largely unchallenged.  The fragmenting effect of SNTV helped 19 women -- 8 percent of all MPs -- get elected in their own right without the aid of the affirmative-action mechanisms.  In the large Western province of Herat, for example, female candidate Fauzia Gailani out-polled all male candidates, including those backed by local warlords.

Fauzia has spoken out against violence against women, and has spoken out forced marriages for girls. She herself was forced to marry, at thirteen years of age. She was widely quoted following the murder of [[Nadia Anjuman]], a young Afghan poet whose husband was arrested for her death after admitting hitting her following an argument.

Others in this camp include Ms. Fauzia Gailani (Herat Province); Ms. Shukria Barekzai, editor of Woman Mirror magazine; and Mr. Ramazan Bashardost, a former Karzai minister who champions parliamentary powers. U.S.-based International Republican Institute (IRI) has helped train the independents; the National Democratic Institute (NDI) has assisted the more established factions.

'''Friends of Traditional Banking''' (FOTB) is an [[independent expenditure]] only committee, or Super PAC, with the aim of improving the political and regulatory environment for   the  [[banking industry]] in the [[United States]] by decreasing federal regulation, particularly by repealing the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] . As a non-partisan [[trade organization|trade group]], it selects a small number of Congressional races in each election cycle (typically two) and encourages their members to donate directly to these campaigns.

The organization is headquartered in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]] and has over 15,000 members. They are led by an executive committee including bank executives and bank association executives,   advised by a Board   of bank executivess from each state, and an Advisory Council  of bank association leaders.&lt;ref&gt;https://friendsoftraditionalbanking.com/about.html&lt;/ref&gt; Their membership and leadership includes execs affiliated with the [[American Bankers Association]], [[Independent Community Bankers of America]], and other industry groups.

==Campaigns==
During the [[2012 senate elections]], the group came out in support of [[Dean Heller]], a former banker in [[Nevada]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.americanbanker.com/issues/177_178/friends-banking-superpac-will-focus-on-brown-heller-races-1052640-1.html&lt;/ref&gt; They also supported [[Scott Brown (politician)|Scott Brown]] in the Senate race in [[Massachusetts]] against [[CFPB]] creator [[Elizabeth Warren]].&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/2012/oct/25/business/la-fi-brown-warren-senate-race-20121025&lt;/ref&gt; Although Warren won in Massachusetts, F Heller won a narrow victory over Congresswoman [[Shelley Berkley]] in Nevada.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oba.com/bankers/oba_update.php?action=story&amp;id=2942#3&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[2014 senate elections]], the group helped direct over 1,000 donations totaling over $500,000 to [[Cory Gardner]] in [[Colorado]] and another $500,000 plus to [[Joni Ernst]] in [[Iowa]]. Both Gardner's opponent Sen. [[Mark Udall]] and Ernst's opponent Rep. [[Bruce Braley]] were defenders of the [[Dodd-Frank Act]] and advocated for increased expansion of [[credit unions]]. Ernst and Gardner both won on Election Day.&lt;ref&gt;https://friendsoftraditionalbanking.com/news/FEC_numbers_reveal_impressive_contributions.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction==
When first announced in 2012, Friends of Traditional Banking was described by [[Salon (website)|''Salon'']] as a "smokescreen of a sobriquet," and that it was primarily an effort to revoke "a key provision of [[Dodd-Frank]] known as the [[Volcker Rule]]" &lt;ref&gt;http://www.salon.com/2012/04/06/the_wall_street_backlash/&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[Huffington Post]] said it was part of the banks' "plan for world domination."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/blair-bowie/disempowered-bankers-star_b_1406977.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[National Journal]] commented that "the bankers' non-super PAC super PAC" was "taking a novel approach" that promised to be both effective and transparent.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationaljournal.com/blogs/influencealley/2012/04/bankers-non-super-pac-super-pac-taking-novel-approach-16&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 2014 elections, [[Politico]] commented that "The industry went to bat in a big way for [[ Cory Gardner|Gardner]], routing him money through Friends of Traditional Banking,".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.politico.com/story/2014/11/wall-street-2014-midterm-elections-112588.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concept ==
[[File:HabitRPG gameplay screenshot as of December 2013.png|300px|thumb|alt=Four sections on a screen, with items below each: Habits, Dailies, To-Dos, and Rewards. There is a health bar above.|A screenshot of the gameplay of Habitica as of December 16, 2013.]]
Habitica is a self-improvement web application with [[game mechanics]] overlaid to help the player keep track of and remain motivated to achieve their goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lifehacker.com/5976476/habitrpg-turns-better-behavior-into-a-game-of-survival|title=HabitRPG Turns Better Behavior into a Game of Survival|publisher=Lifehacker|date=January 16, 2013|author=Dachis, Adam|accessdate=November 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Behrens|first=Andre|title=Gamification Done Right|url=https://open.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/11/gamification-done-right/|accessdate=30 January 2014|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=11 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game is laid out in the form of an [[Role-playing video game|RPG]], in which the player collects items such as gold and armor to become more powerful. Rewards are achieved through maintaining real-life goals, in the form of ''Habits'', ''Dailies'' and ''To-Dos''.

=== Habits ===
In Habitica, ''Habits'' are long-term goals which are utilized to change a person's [[habit]]s.&lt;ref name="makeuseof" /&gt;&lt;ref name="g33kpron"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.g33kpron.com/habitrpg-gamify-your-life-because-irl-is-boring/#.UplgdWTwJ0Q|title=HabitRPG: Gamify Your Life – Because IRL Is Boring.|author=Iaccino, Laura|accessdate=November 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="idealog"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.idealog.co.nz/blog/2013/10/review-habitrpg | title=App review: HabitRPG rewards your good habits | publisher=Idealog.co.nz | date=9 October 2013 | accessdate=17 December 2013 | author=Sachtleben, Amanda}}&lt;/ref&gt; These "Habits" can be set to either 'positive' or 'negative', or both. For example:
* a predefined Habit is "1h productive work". This is a positive Habit: if a user has an hour of productive work, they will gain [[experience point|experience]] and gold.
* a predefined Habit is "Eat junk food". This is a negative Habit: if a user eats junk food, they will lose [[health (gaming)|health]].
* a predefined Habit is "Take the stairs". This is a positive ''and'' a negative Habit: if a user ''does'' take the stairs, they will gain experience and gold. If they ''don't'' take the stairs, they will lose health.

If a user completes a positive Habit often, it will turn green. This signifies that they are doing a good job following their Habit. On the other hand, if a user performs a negative Habit often, it will start to turn red and do increasing damage to their health.  When players accrue enough experience points, they gain a level, which restores their health.

=== Dailies ===
Habitica uses ''Dailies'' to track habits that the user wants to complete in a known, scheduled, and repeatable fashion.&lt;ref name="makeuseof" /&gt;&lt;ref name="g33kpron" /&gt; Dailies are completed by ticking a check box: the user sets their Dailies in advance, and checks off what they have completed during their day. Completed Dailies give the user experience and gold; Dailies that fail to be completed by the end of the day result in a loss of health.

=== To-Dos ===
''To-Dos'' are one-time tasks that can be added or deleted.&lt;ref name="makeuseof" /&gt;&lt;ref name="g33kpron" /&gt;&lt;ref name="idealog" /&gt; When a user completes a To-Do, they gain experience. The To-Do then disappears (it can later be found under the 'Complete' To-Dos tab). Unlike Habits and Dailies, To-Dos will never cause the user to lose health: the To-Do just becomes more valuable over time (it gives more experience and gold once completed).

== Role-playing aspect ==
A major part of Habitica is the role-playing aspect. A role-playing game is one in which a player takes on the role of another person or character. In Habitica, the user takes control of a character that they design themselves. The user can level up and unlock new features. However, upon death, various items and a level are lost.

=== Character ===
The player can customize their own character (also known as an avatar) using various customization options such as hair, skin color and shirts. The armor and swords that a player buys when equipped also provide an attribute bonus. Some of the art in Habitica is sourced from [[BrowserQuest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.habitrpg.com/post/55019151292/browserquest-hangout-thurs-7-11-7p-est |title=HabitRPG - BrowserQuest Hangout Thurs 7/11 @7p EST |first=Tyler |last=Renelle |publisher=Blog.habitrpg.com |date=2013-07-09 |accessdate=2014-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Character class|class system]] is another feature adding complexity to the role-playing aspect of Habitica. Players can choose from one of four classes, each of which have different armor available, as well as different primary and secondary character attributes that affect gameplay.

=== Levels ===
Depending on how well a player completes their Habits, Dailies, and To-Dos, they either gain ''experience'' or lose "health". When a player obtains enough experience, they gain a level, but losing all their health will cause their character to die, and be set back a level. The higher the level the player is, the more features they have access to.

=== Currency ===
When a player completes a Habit, Daily, or To-Do, they gain Gold with the amount depending on the difficulty of the task. Gold can be used to buy ''rewards'' - which can either be user-defined, [[real life]] rewards, or equipment that can give boosts in-game.&lt;ref name="CustomRewards"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.habitrpg.com/post/61637853952/dont-forget-custom-rewards |title=HabitRPG - Don’t Forget Custom Rewards |first=Tyler |last=Renelle |publisher=Blog.habitrpg.com |date=2013-09-18 |accessdate=2014-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gold used to be split into Gold and Silver, with hundred Silver making up one Gold

=== Pets and mounts ===
When checking off items, sometimes the player will receive an item.  The items that can be found are eggs, color potions, and food.  The player can combine these to collect a set of 90 pets, which they can display beside their avatar, and 90 mounts, which their avatar can ride.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Tyler |last=Renelle |url=http://vimeo.com/79172253 |title=HabitRPG Tutorial #2: Pets &amp; Mounts on Vimeo |publisher=Vimeo.com |date=2013-11-12 |accessdate=2014-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additional pets and mounts can be obtained during special events and by completing [[Quest (video gaming)|quests]].

=== Social accountability ===
Players can band together in [[Party (role-playing games)|parties]] to complete quests.  Players can also join [[Clan (video gaming)|guilds]] and participate in challenges made by other players, where the person with the most consistency in performing a task wins an [[Achievement (video gaming)|achievement]].  Players can compete with friends and strangers, as well as collaborate and focus on accountability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://topmobiletrends.com/habitrpg-app-turn-tasks-game/|title=HabitRPG: Turn your tasks into a game!|author=Top Mobile Trends | publisher=Top Mobile  Trends|date=18 November 2014| access-date=4 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In parties and guilds, as well as in the community-wide Tavern, players can communicate with one another via chat.

=== Seasonal events ===
There are four seasonal events called Grand Galas that happen each year in Habitica. Past Galas have involved new quests, special items such as limited edition equipment and avatar customization options, and [[Boss (video gaming)|bosses]] for the whole community to fight together. Other [[holiday]]s, such as Valentine's Day and April Fools’ Day, are also celebrated.

== Mobile application ==

An official [[mobile app]]lication named Habitica is available for the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] operating systems. These mobile applications are replacements for the deprecated mobile apps named HabitRPG, which were released as promised after the $25,000 [[Kickstarter]] fund goal was reached.&lt;ref name="phandroid" /&gt;

== Reception ==
In reviewing the site, Alan Henry wrote for [[Lifehacker]] that "while it doesn’t offer the advanced features that many other to-do apps have, it’s certainly a blast to use, and really addictive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Henry|first=Alan|title=Five Best To-Do List Managers|url=http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2014/03/five-best-to-do-list-managers-3/|publisher=[[Lifehacker]]|accessdate=4 April 2014|date=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kelsey Adams wrote for [[CNET]] that Habitica (then known as HabitRPG) 'had [her] at RPG', and describes 'how much more compelling a game can be than reality to those of us whose brains are bent that way'.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Kelsey (16 July 2014).  [http://www.cnet.com/au/news/habitrpg-helps-you-win-at-life-and-zombie-cactuses/ "HabitRPG Helps You Win at Life and Zombie Cactuses."]  ''CNET.com''.  Retrieved 31 May 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Tyler Renelle originally created HabitRPG to help with his own habits, having been inspired by the self-help books ''[[The Power of Habit]]'' and ''The Now Habit''.&lt;ref name="CustomRewards"/&gt;  The earliest version of HabitRPG was a [[Google Docs, Sheets, Slides and Forms|Google Docs]] spreadsheet with color-coded cell formulae.&lt;ref&gt;Orin, Andy (29 January 2015).  [http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2015/01/behind-the-app-the-story-of-habitrpg/ "Behind the App:  The Story of HabitRPG."]  ''LifeHacker.com''.  Retrieved 31 May 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the community of HabitRPG users grew, Renelle reached out to Siena Leslie and Vicky Hsu. Leslie and Hsu became cofounders of HabitRPG, Inc., which was formally incorporated as a company in 2014.

On July 31, 2015, the website and apps were renamed to Habitica, after the land where players’ adventures take place. The change was made because some users found the name HabitRPG confusing or difficult to remember. The company name remained HabitRPG, Inc.

== Community ==
In addition to participating in the website and apps’ social aspects, the community has been involved in helping with and improving Habitica.

=== Contributors ===
Community volunteers contribute to Habitica in various ways, such as by creating pixel art, translating text, creating music and sound effects, writing blog posts to promote Habitica, editing the wiki, resolving bugs, implementing new features, and answering new users’ questions.

=== Kickstarter ===
Starting on January 11, 2013, Renelle  started a campaign on fund-raising site [[Kickstarter]] to improve development of the application with a goal of $25,000. The goal was surpassed: $41,191 was raised by a total of 2,817 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Tyler |last=Renelle |url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lefnire/habitrpg-mobile |title=HabitRPG by Tyler Renelle — Kickstarter |publisher=Kickstarter.com |date=|accessdate=2014-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Henry Grady Weaver''' (December 24, 1889 – January 3, 1949) was the director of Customer Research Staff for [[General Motors Corporation]], and shown on the cover of the November 14, 1938 issue of [[Time Magazine]]. He is credited with developing the use of the survey questionnaire to investigate customer preferences for design features in cars.

==Early life and education==
He was named after, but not related to, [[Henry Woodfin Grady]] who died the year before Weaver was born. He was nicknamed Buck Weaver after the baseball player of the same name who later was part of the 1919 [[Black Sox scandal]].&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,772072,00.html|title=Thought-Starter|date=1938-11-14|publisher=[[Time Magazine]]|accessdate=2011-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was born in [[Eatonton, Georgia]] and obtained his Bachelor of Science from [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]] in 1911.&lt;ref name="time"/&gt;

==Career==
Blind in his right eye since birth, he worked as a mechanic, salesman and draftsman before becoming director of Customer Research Staff of [[General Motors Corporation]]. It was for that work that he was placed on the cover of the November 14, 1938 issue of ''[[Time magazine|Time]]''.

He is best known for his work, ''[[The Mainspring of Human Progress]]''.

'''The International Centre for Financial Regulation (ICFR)''' (2009–12) was a UK-based [[non-partisan]] organisation focused entirely on [[financial regulation]] that operated between 2009 and 2012.&lt;ref name=launch&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icffr.org/getattachment/03ba1c5d-b37d-4ff1-b9f6-00286fabe5e6/ICFR-Launch-Press-Pack.aspx |title=ICFR launched |author= |date=13 January 2009 |accessdate=6 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317205008/http://www.icffr.org/getattachment/03ba1c5d-b37d-4ff1-b9f6-00286fabe5e6/ICFR-Launch-Press-Pack.aspx |archivedate=17 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
IFCR was the product of a collaboration between a number if international financial services institutions and the UK Government. The ICFR wanted to provide research, events and training on financial regulation whilst also acting as a catalyst for dialogue, thought leadership and scholarship in this critical area.&lt;ref name=launch/&gt;{{dead link|date=February 2014}} The ICFR’s stated focus was to "shape regulatory thinking that not only addresses – but also anticipates – the evolution of [[financial markets]] at a global level, to bring consistency and cooperation between global regulators and policy makers through pro-active discussions, working groups and long-term research."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icffr.org/Research.aspx ICFR research]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100121200419/http://www.icffr.org/Research.aspx |date=21 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre also meant to support practical training initiatives on best practice and the latest regulatory changes both in developed and emerging markets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icffr.org/Training/Training-Catalogue.aspx ICFR training catalogue]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100906180043/http://www.icffr.org/Training/Training-Catalogue.aspx |date=6 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was put into administration in late 2012, as a member of the management had been suspended after a "substantial" sum of money "appeared to have been removed from the organisation’s bank accounts" without the permission of the centre's board.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/dc67ec98-5fe8-11e2-b128-00144feab49a.html#axzz2UNhGBgwi&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/police-probe-into-financial-watchdog-after-money-goes-missing-8347670.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 January 2014, the ICFR's Chief Operating Officer Charles Taylor appeared at City of London Magistrates' Court charged with fraud by abuse of position in relation to the internal theft of almost £600,000 and false accounting.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.accountancylive.com/croner/jsp/Editorial.do?contentId=2910760&amp;BV_UseBVCookie=yes&amp;channelId=-601070&lt;/ref&gt;  Taylor committed suicide in September 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/sep/24/accountant-state-funded-thinktank-killed-himself-before-trial-inquest-hears |title=Accountant at state-funded thinktank killed himself before trial |publisher=The Guardian |date=September 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Organisation of Securities Commissions''' ('''IOSCO''') is an association of organisations that regulate the world’s [[securities]] and [[Futures contract|futures]] markets. Members are typically primary securities and/or futures regulators in a national jurisdiction or the main financial regulator from each country. Its mandate is to:&lt;ref name="eiu"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Road to Action: Financial regulation addressing climate change|date=2017|publisher=Economist Intelligence Unit|location=London|url=http://www.eiuperspectives.economist.com/sites/default/files/LON%20-%20RF%20-%20report%20on%20climate%20change%20WEB_0.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Develop, implement, and promote high standards of regulation to enhance investor protection and reduce systemic risk
* Share information with exchanges and assist them with technical and operational issues
* Establish standards toward monitoring global investment transactions across borders and markets

IOSCO has members from over 100 different countries, who regulate more than 95% of the world's securities markets. It has a permanent secretariat in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]].&lt;ref name="about"/&gt;

==History==
IOSCO was born in 1983 from the transformation of its ancestor the "Inter-American Regional Association" (created in 1974) into a truly global cooperative. This decision to expand the organisation beyond the Americas was made at the annual gathered in [[Quito]], [[Ecuador]], in April 1983.  At the same time, the organisation was renamed to IOSCO to reflect the expanded membership beyond North and South America. Securities regulators from [[France]], [[Indonesia]], [[Korea]], and the [[United Kingdom]] were the first agencies to join from outside the Americas. The IOSCO July 1986 Paris Annual Conference was the first to take place outside of the American continents and on that occasion a decision was made to create a permanent General Secretariat for the Organisation.&lt;ref name="about"/&gt; One remnant of its early inter-American roots is that IOSCO's "official" languages are English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese.

In 1998 IOSCO started work on a number of important policies that led to broader set of guidelines. However it was the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] as well as a series of large global financial scandals that started with [[Enron]] and including [[Worldcom]], [[Parmalat]], and [[Vivendi]] that brought urgency to this work and heralded IOSCO's evolution from an international “talk shop”, where little of substance was accomplished, to a serious international organisation with a real impact on the securities regulation. At the 1999 conference in [[Lisbon]], it was decided to have a permanent headquarters for the administrative General Secretariat and that it should be based in Madrid.&lt;ref name="about"/&gt;

In 2002 IOSCO adopted a multilateral memorandum of understanding (IOSCO MMoU) designed to facilitate crossborder enforcement and exchange of information among the international community of securities regulators. Then in 2005 IOSCO MMoU become the benchmark for international cooperation among securities regulators.&lt;ref name="about"/&gt;

==Membership==
As of February 2018, IOSCO had 218 members.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|title=About IOSCO|url=https://www.iosco.org/about/?subsection=about_iosco|website=IOSCO|accessdate=9 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; IOSCO members are divided into three main categories:

*Ordinary members: primary securities and/or [[Futures contract|futures]] markets regulators in a jurisdiction. A [[stock exchange]] or [[self-regulatory organization]] may be an ordinary member, but only if it is the jurisdiction’s primary securities regulator. Each ordinary member has one vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iosco.org/about/index.cfm?section=categories |title= IOSCO Categories &amp; Contributions of Members |author=IOSCO }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Associate members: other securities and/or futures regulators in cases where there's more than one per jurisdiction. For example, the [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission]] (CFTC) and the [[North American Securities Administrators Association]] in the United States are associate members of IOSCO given that the U.S. [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] is the ordinary member from the United States. Associate members have no vote and are not eligible for the Executive Committee; they are, however, members of the Presidents' Committee.
*Affiliate members: include stock exchanges, self-regulatory organisations, and various stock market industry associations. Affiliate members have no vote, are not eligible for the Executive Committee, and are not members of the Presidents' Committee. Affiliate members that are self-regulatory organizations (SROs), are, however, members of the SRO Consultative Committee.

== Structure ==
The organisation is made up of a number of committees that meet several times a year at different locations around the world supported by a permanent administrative General Secretariat.

===Leadership===
Administratively, IOSCO is run by a General Secretariat based in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]]. IOSCO’s current Secretary General is Paul P. Andrews, who started his renewable three-year term in March 2016. Previously, he served as the Vice President and Managing Director of [[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority]] (FINRA) a [[self-regulatory organization]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Paul P. Andrews of FINRA Named IOSCO Secretary General|url=https://www.iosco.org/news/pdf/IOSCONEWS409.pdf|accessdate=9 February 2018|work=IOSCO|date=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IOSCO Board is IOSCO's governing and standard-setting body. It is composed of 33 securities regulators; [[Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission]] CEO Ashley Ian Alder is the IOSCO Board Chair (he also chairs the Asia-Pacific Regional Committee). He is supported by two Vice Chairs, Ranjit Ajit Singh, Chair of the [[Securities Commission Malaysia]] (who chairs the Growth and Emerging Markets Committee, IOSCO's largest sub-committee) and Jean-Paul Servais, Chair of [[Belgium]]'s [[Financial Services and Markets Authority (Belgium)|Financial Services and Markets Authority]] (who chairs the European Regional Committee as well).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iosco.org/about/index.cfm?section=structure |title=About IOSCO – Structure |author=IOSCO }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regional committees===
IOSCO has four regional committees:
* African-Middle East Regional Committee: chaired by Mounir Gwarzo of the [[Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission]]
* Asia-Pacific Regional Committee: chaired by Ashley Ian Alder of the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission
* European Regional Committee: chaired by Jean-Paul Servais of the Belgium Financial Services and Markets Authority
* Inter-American Regional Committee: chaired by Jaime González Aguadé of the [[Mexico]]'s [[Comisión Nacional Bancaria y de Valores]]

===Technical Committee===
The Technical Committee has been described as the one involving the most "grunt work". In short, it is made up of 16 of the larger securities agencies that regulate more developed markets. It is "self-constituting" in the sense that it determines which countries will be a member and it also determines procedures and agendas.&lt;ref name="law"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=A. A. Sommer, Jr.|title=IOSCO: Its Mission and Achievement|journal=Northwestern Journal of International Law &amp; Business|date=1996|volume=17|issue=1|pages=15–29|url=https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://scholar.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1441&amp;context=njilb}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, former [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] Chairman [[Richard C. Breeden]] was elected Chair of the technical committee and implemented reforms that gave it a "new vigor and a new resolution" that "bespoke an organization confident of its footing and its mission".&lt;ref name="law"/&gt;

== External cooperation ==
IOSCO is a member of, participates as an observer in, or coordinates with a number of other organisations. One of its most important relationships is with the [[Joint Forum]] of international financial regulators. IOSCO, along with the [[Basel Committee on Banking Supervision]] and the [[International Association of Insurance Supervisors]], make up the Joint Forum.

The IOSCO MOUs are considered the primary instruments to facilitate crossborder cooperation, reduce global systemic risk, protect investors, and ensure fair and efficient securities markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD126.pdf |title=Multilateral Memorandum of Understanding Concerning Consultation and Co-operation and the Exchange of Information | date= May 2002 |author=IOSCO }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iosco.org/library/index.cfm?section=mou_siglist |title=List of Signatories to the IOSCO Multilateral Memorandum of Understanding | author=IOSCO }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, IOSCO is a member of, participates as an observer in, or coordinates with a number of other international organisations, including the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]], [[Financial Stability Board|FSB]], [[Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering]], [[International Accounting Standards Board|IASB]], [[Public Interest Oversight Board|PIOB]], [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], [[World Bank]], and [[European Commission]].

== Policies ==
IOSCO adopted in 1998 a comprehensive set of ''Objectives and Principles of Securities Regulation'' (IOSCO Principles).  These continue to be developed and expanded. IOSCO recommends all its members to adopt these and helps its members assess the level of compliance with the principles.  These include;

*Regulatory principles designed to improve auditor independence and auditor oversight&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD134.pdf |title=Principles for Auditor Oversight |publisher = IOSCO Technical Committee | date= Oct 2002 |author=IOSCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''MIT $100K Entrepreneurship Competition''' is one of the largest and most famous [[business plan]] competitions in the world. Entirely student-managed, students from all programs and levels at [[MIT]] organize and enter the $100K.  Teams must include at least 1 full-time MIT student, but membership is not restricted to the MIT community.  The Competition is supported by the [[MIT Entrepreneurship Center]] at the [[MIT Sloan School of Management]].
Every year - a total of $300,000 is distributed as non-dilutive grant money. Since 1990 the MIT $100K has given birth to over 160 companies, generating 4,600 jobs, receiving over $1.3 billion dollars in venture capital funding and have a cumulative market value of over $15 billion
Throughout the academic year, the teams take part in a process that includes:
* Industry &amp; legal mentorship
* Multiple live judging rounds
* Prototyping &amp; pitch workshops
* Expense accounts for venture development
* Networking events with sponsors &amp; alumni
* Non-dilutive prize money (~300K annually)

The competition started in 1990 as the $10K competition, and continued to grow throughout the 1990s.  In 1996 the $10K evolved into the $50K with $30K going to the winner and $10K to each of two runners-up.  In 2006, the $50K added another competition focused on business plans for low-income communities to complement the traditional business venture competition.  Subsequently, the competition has rebranded as the MIT $100K.


==MIT $100K PITCH Contest==
The '''MIT $100K Pitch Contest''' is put on every year by the MIT $100K organizing committee. It is held in the fall of each year and is intended to provide a way for entrepreneurs with ideas to form teams. It is considered a warm-up event for the Executive Summary Contest held in the winter and the Business Plan Contest held in the spring. In the Elevator Pitch Contest, each contestant is given 60 seconds in front of a crowd to give their "elevator pitch," with the winner receiving a cash prize. This contest is open to the public.

==MIT $100K ACCELERATE Contest==
The '''MIT $100K''' '''''ACCELERATE''''' '''Contest''' has replaced the '''MIT $100K Executive Summary Contest''' in 2011. It is held in the winter of academic year and is intended to help teams build a robust prototype for their start-up idea. Teams will work on creating a demo of their idea over December and January, and the best demos will be presented in the ACCELERATE Finale Show to a crowd of hundreds. MIT $100K will be providing resources and mentorship to help teams build their demos which will be reviewed by a panel of judges with the winner receiving a cash prize.&lt;sup&gt;[http://mit100k.org/accelerate/]&lt;/sup&gt;

==MIT $100K LAUNCH - Business Plan Contest==
The '''MIT $100K Launch Contest''' is the flagship of the MIT $100K Entrepreneurship Competition. In the spring, semi-finalists are selected from all business plan submissions. LAUNCH is the final contest in the $100K cycle. Participants present full-scale business plans for the chance to win a $100,000 Grand Prize.

==History: MIT $10K/$50K/$100K Entrepreneurial Competition==
The competition was founded in the 1989-1990 academic year and was initially intended as a promotional vehicle for the MIT Entrepreneurs Club (now the MIT E-Club.) Club members Richard Durling-Shyduroff and Douglas Ling along with club Founder Peter Mui envisioned a cross-campus event that brought MIT's varied schools together to identify and support innovative ideas on campus. The goal was to create a safe, nurturing, (relatively controlled) sandbox environment where fledging entrepreneurs could try their wings. The lead alumni donor was George Hatsopoulos of Thermo Electron. with additional generous support from other alumni, the Sloan School (Dean Lester Thurow) and Engineering School (Acting Dean Jack Kerrebrock.)

==Entrepreneurship for Development Competition==
The Entrepreneurship for Development Competition is a competition for business plans that are judged on the following criteria: uniqueness of business idea, management strength, path to sustainability and social impact.  The competition was added in 2006 as a complement to the Business Venture Competition due to increasing demand and interest in socially conscious ideas.  In the spring, semi-finalists are selected from all business plan submissions.  Semi-finalists submit more detailed business plans and 5-6 finalists are then chosen.  At the awards ceremony, the top team is awarded the Entrepreneurship for Development grand prize.

===Winners - Entrepreneurship for Development Competition===
In 1998, a dual award within the Venture Competition was awarded to a pair of finalists including Volunteer Community Connection.  At the time, VCC was a non-traditional entry into the competition and 
has since served as a motivating example for the genesis of the MIT $100K Developmental Entrepreneurship Competition.  As a result, they are listed as a winner and implicitly as an innovator within the Entrepreneurship for Development Competition.

Today, ''Machine Design'' is owned by [[Penton Media Inc.]], and has editorial offices based in Cleveland, Ohio, USA. The chief editor is Leland Teschler.

==History==
The inaugural issue of ''Machine Design'' coincided almost exactly with the 1929 stock-market crash and the beginning of the [[Great Depression]]. Although the nation was in the economic doldrums, there was significant design development taking place in almost all industrial segments including automotive, aircraft, farm equipment, home appliances, and industrial machinery.
 
The onset of World War II came and brought almost frenetic activity to design engineering at large. After the war, civilian industries thrived. But in the years following the war and into the 1950s the role of design engineer languished, stigmatized by the war effort as the creator of new means of destruction.

Engineering colleges began to feel slighted because doctors, lawyers, and business executives were viewed as having more prestige and professional status than their engineering graduates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=cache:hrUmJB0P_hwJ:citeseer.ist.psu.edu/391232.html Teaching and assessing engineering design: a review of the research (1998)]&lt;/ref&gt; Intellectual elites viewed engineering colleges as trade schools, and graduate engineers were said to be nothing more than mechanics or glorified shop hands. In response, engineering schools began to drop courses that lacked academic rigor or had the slightest blue-collar aura.
 
The launch of [[Sputnik]] in 1957 again changed the perception of design engineering. The perceived loss of world leadership in air and space technology by the people of the United States set the stage for a considerable renewal of prestige to the engineering discipline. After more than a decade into the Cold War, the public realized science and engineering could play a key role in keeping the Communists at bay. The government unloaded almost limitless supplies of money on high-tech defense industries, and engineering became the career of choice. High salaries and generous perks were lavished on engineers and scientists.
 
Unfortunately, Sputnik also accelerated the movement to delete courses on manufacturing and shop practice from the curricula of top schools. The idea was to portray engineers as being more scientist than mechanic. The rocket scientist working on the space program became the image to which most engineers aspired.

This attitude had a lot to do with framing the editorial policies of ''Machine Design'' through the 1960s. The policies were in tune with what was happening in the largest and most-sophisticated corporations, especially the aircraft and automotive industries, where design engineering and manufacturing engineering were increasingly treated as separate entities having no common interest. Reflecting this, articles selected for ''Machine Design'' were carefully tailored not to have too much of a manufacturing orientation.

Starting in the late 1960s, another shift in American perception was brought about by the growing awareness of overseas manufacturing facilities returning a lower cost product with higher quality. While lower labor rates played a key role in the lower costs, they could not justify the higher reliability of offshore products over those domestically produced. It was soon discovered that those shops with higher quality production realized design and manufacturing engineering were closely intertwined. ''Machine Design'' articles started to reflect this trend. For example, it's believed to be the first industrial trade magazine to run a comprehensive article explaining numerical control machining and how it relates to design engineering.

''Machine Design'''s coverage of manufacturing positioned it well when concurrent engineering became the trendy idea in industry. Major corporations suddenly discovered that design and manufacturing were interrelated, and it became vogue to tear down the walls between design and manufacturing engineers.

In the 1970s, [[Finite element method|finite-element analysis]] broke on the industrial scene. [[Computer-aided design]] was evolving, and by the 1980s, it was also having a profound impact on design procedures. [[Computer-aided manufacturing]] evolved separately, but by 1990 CAD and CAM had merged. In the field of electrical and electronic technology, relay controls were giving way to digital electronics and the [[microprocessor]] that led to combining a number of design disciplines into the technologies of [[mechatronics]] and [[motion control]].

For over 80 years, ''Machine Design'' had predicted and led the industrial community spotting trends and fundamental changes in manufacturing operations. Providing an ongoing series of technological overviews interspersed with in-depth tutorials, it kept readers abreast of technologies that were transforming product design. It does this with an editorial staff of degreed engineers possessing industrial experience and obligated to create lucid and interesting articles supported by the intelligent use of graphics.

'''Blanche Marie Louise Oelrichs''' (October 1, 1890 – November 5, 1950) was an American [[poet]], [[playwright]] and [[theatre]] [[actress]].  Oelrichs first used the masculine ''[[nom de plume]]''  '''Michael Strange'''  to publish her poetry in order to distance her [[High society (social class)|Society]] reputation from its sometimes erotic content, but it soon became the name under which she presented herself for the remainder of her life.

==Early life==
Born to [[Charles May Oelrichs]] and Blanche de Loosey, Blanche Oelrichs was the youngest of four children.&lt;ref name="Notable American Women, 1607–1950"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rVLOhGt1BX0C&amp;pg=RA2-PA490 |title=Notable American Women, 1607–1950: A Biographical Dictionary, Volume 2 |page=490 |author1=Edward T. James |author2=Janet Wilson James |author3=Paul S. |publisher=Boyer, Radcliffe College}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her [[Austrians|Austrian]] mother was the sister of Emilie de Loosey, wife of [[Theodore Havemeyer]]. The family spent summers in [[Newport, Rhode Island]], amidst [[Astor family|the Astors]], [[Vanderbilt family|the Vanderbilts]], and numerous other wealthy elites of American society during the [[Gilded Age]].

Her sister Natalie, always known as Lily, married and divorced Heinrich Borwin, [[Duke of Mecklenburg]] (son of [[Duke Paul Frederick of Mecklenburg]]), after the premature death of her first husband Peter Martin of San Francisco. Her brother, Charles de Loosey was the father of [[Marjorie Oelrichs]] who was married to band leader [[Eddy Duchin]].

==Life and career==
[[File:Blanche Oelrichs, between 1910 and 1915.jpg|thumb|left|Blanche Oelrichs, between 1910 and 1915]]

Oelrichs was an involved activist for [[women's suffrage]] and a writer. French portrait artist [[Paul César Helleu|Paul Helleu]] described Strange as the "most beautiful woman in America."&lt;ref&gt;[NY Times Nov. 6, 1950]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1910, Oelrichs married her first husband Leonard Moorhead Thomas, the son of a prominent [[Philadelphia]] banker, with whom she had two children, Leonard Jr. (1911–68)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pennock.ws/surnames/fam/fam65005.html Leonard Moorhead Thomas, Jr. RASH'S SURNAME INDEX]&lt;/ref&gt; and Robin May Thomas (1915–44). Leonard Moorhead Thomas was a [[Yale University]] graduate who had worked in the [[diplomatic service]] in [[Rome]] and [[Madrid]] and served with the [[United States Army]] in [[Europe]] during [[World War I]], earning the [[Croix de guerre 1914–1918 (France)|Croix de Guerre]]. Blanche Oelrichs developed a "literary urge" in 1914 when she began creating works of poetry and theatrical plays. Her first collection of poems was published in 1916 under the [[pen name]] Michael Strange. Her interests caused a rift with her husband and they divorced in 1919.&lt;ref name="Notable American Women, 1607–1950" /&gt;

Through her social activities, Strange met renowned actor [[John Barrymore]]. They were introduced by actress [[Cathleen Nesbitt]], Barrymore's leading woman in the 1916 production of the play ''[[Justice (play)|Justice]]''. She continued seeing him for four years; and, after divorcing Thomas, she married Barrymore on August 5, 1920.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E03E0DD1E31E433A25755C0A96E9C946195D6CF JOHN BARRY MORE WEDS MRS.

New York Times, 9.&lt;/ref&gt; She was already pregnant with their only child, [[Diana Barrymore|Diana Blanche Barrymore]], who was born on March 3, 1921.

With drawings provided by [[John Barrymore]], Strange published a book in 1921 titled ''Resurrecting Life''. Her pseudonym was intended to separate her Society family from the erotic content of the volume and its connection to her affair from Barrymore, but instead the vast popularity of the volume led to greater fame and notoriety, and her adaptation of the Strange name permanently.&lt;ref name="MWB" /&gt; She then turned her writing skills to the creation of [[theatre|theatrical]] plays including a 1921 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production titled ''Clair de lune''. Based on ''[[The Man Who Laughs|L'Homme qui rit]]'' by [[Victor Hugo]], her play starred her husband and his sister [[Ethel Barrymore]]. It was made into a 1932 movie of the same name in [[France]] by director [[Henri Diamant-Berger]].

In 1921, Strange was among the first to join the [[Lucy Stone League]], an organization that fought for women to preserve their maiden names after marriage.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A05E2DF1F3FEE3ABC4052DFB366838A639EDE WIVES DEBATE RIGHT TO MAIDEN NAMES: Elsie Ferguson Learns From Ruth Hale That She May Have Her Own Checking Account.

New York Times, 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Strange spent a great deal of time in [[Paris]], [[France]] during the next few years while her husband performed abroad. After returning to live in New York, she began acting in live theatre. Her marriage to [[John Barrymore]] ended in May 1925. She then joined a summer stock company in [[Salem, Massachusetts]] and appeared in two Broadway plays in 1926 and 1927.

Another book of Strange's poetry was published in 1928 under the title "''Selected poems, by Michael Strange''" and  the following year she married a third time to the prominent New York attorney [[Harrison Tweed]] who later became Chairman of [[Sarah Lawrence College]].&lt;ref&gt;"[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9F02E7D91330E33ABC4C51DFB3668382639EDE MICHAEL STRANGE MARRIES IN LONDON: John Barrymore's Former Wife Weds Harrison Tweed, New New York Lawyer.

New York Times, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; During the second half of the 1930s Strange hosted a poetry and music program on New York radio station [[WOR (AM)|WOR]] that gained a strong audience. In 1940, Strange published her autobiography, ''Who Tells Me True''. In 1942, she and Harrison Tweed divorced, and in 1944 her son Robin died at the age of 29.

Starting in the summer of 1940 until her death, Strange was in a long-term relationship with [[Margaret Wise Brown]], the author of many children's books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Wild Things! Acts of Mischief in Children’s Literature |pages=57–58 |author1=Betsy Bird |author2=Julie Danielson |author3=Peter Sieruta |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PC74AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA57 |date=2014 |publisher=Candlewick Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship began as something of a mentoring one, but became a romantic relationship and they lived together at 10 Gracie Square beginning in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus, Leonard S. ''Margaret Wise Brown: Awakened by the Moon''.  Boston: Beacon Press, 1992.  167–178, 251. {{ISBN|978-0688171889}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strange was a registered communist and part of the [[America First Committee]]'s weekly radio show.&lt;ref name="MWB" /&gt;

Her final professional tour was ''Great Works with Great Music'', a recreation of a radio program she had done previously, in which she read great literature and classical works of music were played.&lt;ref name="MWB" /&gt;

Michael Strange died from [[leukemia]] in 1950 in [[Boston]]. She was interred with her son Robin, who had died in 1944, in the Oelrichs' family plot in the [[Woodlawn Cemetery, Bronx|Woodlawn Cemetery]] in [[The Bronx, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Scott.

Kindle Edition&lt;/ref&gt; Robin had been buried in Indiana with his predeceased lover,{{fact|date=April 2018}} but Strange's will asked for his body to be moved to the rest of the family.&lt;ref name="MWB" /&gt;

Margaret Wise Brown was made her [[literary executor]]. Upon her death two years later, Strange's papers were delivered to Brown's sister Roberta who contacted Diana Barrymore who instructed her to burn them.&lt;ref name="MWB"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gary |first=Amy |date=2016 |title=The Great Green Room: The Brilliant Bold Life of Margaret Wise Brown |publisher=Flatiron Books |pages=104, 167, 196, 234 |isbn=978-1-25006536-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
In 1960 her daughter [[Diana Barrymore]] died at age 38 after several years of drug and alcohol addiction. Her older son Leonard was married to painter [[Yvonne Thomas]] and they had two daughters together, the only grandchildren of Michael Strange.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aspentimes.com/article/20090904/OBITUARIES/909049988 Obituary of Blanche's daughter-in-law, Yvonne Thomas (1913–2009); AspenTimes.com September 4, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mint Street''' is one of the prime streets of the commercial centre of [[George Town, Chennai|George Town]] in [[Chennai]], [[India]]. The street is one of the oldest streets in Chennai and is believed to be the longest street in the city.&lt;ref name="PrintWeekIndia_WalkthroughHistory"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TOI_MadrasWeek_MemoriesDownTheStreet"/&gt; Running north–south, the street connects [[Poonamallee High Road, Chennai|Poonamallee High Road]] at [[Park Town, Chennai|Park Town]] in the south with North Wall Road–[[Old Jail Road, Chennai|Old Jail Road]] Junction at [[Washermanpet]] in the north. Running parallel to the [[Wall Tax Road, Chennai|Wall Tax Road]], another historical thoroughfare in the city, the street passes through thickly populated residential and commercial areas of the historical neighbourhood.

==History==
In the 17th century, a Jewish cemetery was established on the street by a [[Portuguese Jews|Portuguese Jewish]] trader,  Jacques de Paivia. It was later moved to Lloyd's Road and became the [[Lloyd's Road Jewish Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Muthiah S.|title=The Portuguese Jews of Madras|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-portuguese-jews-of-madras/article2252700.ece|publisher=The Hindu|date=3 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 18th century, washers and bleachers employed by the [[British East India Company]] for its cloth business settled around the street, given it the name 'Washers' Street'. Several of them were Telugu speaking, followed by the middlemen or dubashes (men who knew two languages), chiefly Telugu-speaking Komutti and Beri Chetties. By the 1740s, Gujarathis and people from the Saurashtra region closely associated with the cloth trade settled down in the area to the west of the street. Soon, the area also became home to [[Marwari people|Marwari]]s, who were chiefly pawn brokers and money lenders. Mint Street thus became a confluence of various language speakers, which has remained so till date.&lt;ref name="PrintWeekIndia_WalkthroughHistory"&gt;{{Cite web

In 1841–1842, the East India Company moved its coin-making facility to this street, and since then the street became known as Mint Street.&lt;ref name="PrintWeekIndia_WalkthroughHistory"/&gt; Later the mint was converted as the Government Press, which still functions. Next to the Press stood Crown Talkies, one of the city's earliest cinema theatres built by a photographer named Ragupathy Venkaiah, who also built other theatres such as Gaiety and Globe in various parts of the city. The street also housed Muragan Theatre, where ''Kalidasa'', the first Tamil talkie, was released.&lt;ref name="TOI_MadrasWeek_MemoriesDownTheStreet"&gt;{{cite news

The city's first ticketed Carnatic concert was conducted in this street in the 1880s for a concert by Maha Vaidyanatha Sivan at the Thondaimandalam Thruva Vellalar School, which is now in a dilapidated condition. The concept, however, did not succeed.&lt;ref name="TOI_MadrasWeek_MemoriesDownTheStreet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hindu_MintStreetMusicMemories"&gt;{{cite news

In 1889, the Hindu Theological School was established, where the legendary C. Saraswathi Bai gave her first harikatha performance in 1909, becoming the first woman to do so.&lt;ref name="Hindu_MintStreetMusicMemories"/&gt; The school was visited by [[Mahatma Gandhi]] in 1896.&lt;ref name="TOI_MadrasWeek_MemoriesDownTheStreet"/&gt;

The memorial house of savant Ramalinga Swamigal is located near the northern end of the street, in Veerasami Street, a lane off Barracks Street.&lt;ref name="Hindu_MintStreetMusicMemories"/&gt;

The street houses two historic schools, namely the Tondaimandalam Tuluva Vellalar (TTV) School, founded in 1854, and the Hindu Theological School, founded in 1889. The TTV School was home to one of the earliest music sabhas—the Tondaimandalam Sabha. It was at a meeting of this Sabha at the school in 1905 that the decision to celebrate the Aradhana of Tyagaraja in a grand manner at Thiruvaiyaru was taken by a large group of musicians.&lt;ref name="Hindu_MintStreetMusicMemories"/&gt;

Mint Street housed several bhajan centres (''bhajanai mandirams''), to nurture the bhajan tradition of Carnatic music, of which at least two still survive. One of these centres has transformed into a temple. Known as the 'Sumai tangi' (load-bearing) Rama temple, it has two exquisite Thanjavur paintings of Rama and Narasimha, which were the original objects of worship before the erection of stone idols. In a talk that Tiger Varadachariar gave over the All India Radio, composers and music publishers Tachur Singaracharlu Brothers organised bhajan sessions at this temple in the 1890s.&lt;ref name="Hindu_MintStreetMusicMemories"/&gt;
Mint Street has several temples dedicated to Lord Ganesha.&lt;ref name="Hindu_MintStreetMusicMemories"/&gt; [[Kandaswami Temple, Georgetown|Kandaswami Temple]], dedicated to Lord Murugan, is located on Rasappa Chetty Street, off Mint Street.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7181">The '''Multi Fibre Arrangement''' (MFA) governed the world trade in [[textiles]] and garments from 1974 through 2004, imposing [[wiktionary:quota|quota]]s on the amount [[developing country|developing countries]] could [[export]] to [[developed country|developed countries]]. It expired on 1 January 2005.

==History==
{{see also|History of cotton}}

Since the (re)emergence of developing countries as a source of cotton textile production, after the [[industrial revolution|Textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution]], such as [[India]]'s [[Khadi]] production in the [[Swadeshi movement]] initiated by [[Mahatma Gandhi]], cotton production from these countries steadily increased after [[Decolonization|colonial independence]].  A number of treaties concerning '''Short-Term Arrangements regarding International Trade in Cotton Textiles''' ([[Geneva]], 21 July 1961); '''Long-Term Arrangement regarding International Trade in Cotton Textiles'''  (Geneva, 9 February 1962 and 15 June 1970), and '''Arrangement regarding International Trade in Textiles''' (Geneva, 20 December 1973) attempted to address the issue of what seemed a natural dominance of developing world in cotton textile production at the time.  Eventually, the Multi Fibre Agreement was established in 1974.

==Impact==
The MFA was introduced in 1974 as a short-term measure intended to allow developed countries to adjust to imports from the developing world. Developing countries and countries without a welfare state&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ethical Fashion Forum: alternative trade page |url=http://planb4fashion.blogspot.com/2015/12/ethical-fashion-forum-alternative-trade.html|website=PlanB4fashion|accessdate=17 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; have a [[comparative advantage]] in textile production because it is labor-intensive and their poor social insurance systems allow them low labor costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trade, Tariffs and Barriers |url=http://www.ethicalfashionforum.com/the-issues/trade-tariffs-and-barriers|website=Ethical Fashion Forum|accessdate=13 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a [[World Bank]]/[[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) study, the system has cost the developing world 27 million jobs and $40 billion a year in lost exports.&lt;ref&gt;Presentation by H.E. K.M. Chandrasekhar, Chairman [[ITCB]], EC Conference on the Future of Textiles and Clothing after 2004, Brussels, 5 – 6 May 2003. [http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/html/123176.htm http://www.itcb.org/Documents/ITCB-MI35.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Developing countries have resisted moves such as a social clause in tariff agreements, to link them to improvements in working conditions.

The Arrangement was not negative for all developing countries. For example, the [[European Union]] (EU) imposed no restrictions or duties on imports from the emerging countries, such as [[Bangladesh]], leading to a massive expansion of the industry.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

At the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) [[Uruguay Round]], it was decided to bring the textile trade under the jurisdiction of the [[World Trade Organization]]. The Agreement on Textiles and Clothing provided for the gradual dismantling of the quotas that existed under the MFA. This process was completed on 1 January 2005. However, large tariffs remained in place on many textile products.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Bangladesh was expected to suffer the most from the ending of the MFA, as it was expected to face more competition, particularly from [[China]]. However, this was not the case. It turns out that even in the face of other economic giants, Bangladesh’s labor is "cheaper than anywhere else in the world." While some smaller factories were documented making pay cuts and layoffs, most downsizing was essentially speculative – the orders for goods kept coming even after the MFA expired. In fact, Bangladesh's exports increased in value by about $500 million in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Haider, Mahtab. "Defying predictions, Bangladesh’s garment factories thrive." The Christian Science Monitor. 7 Feb 2006. 11 Feb 2007. http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0207/p04s02-wosc.html&lt;/ref&gt;

However, poorer countries within the developed world, such as [[Greece]] and [[Portugal]], are expected to lose out.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

During early 2005, textile and clothing exports from China to the West grew by 100% or more in many items, leading the US and EU to cite China's WTO accession agreement allowing them to restrict the rate of growth to 7.5% per year until 2008. In June, China agreed with the EU to limit the rate to 10% for 3 years. No such agreement was reached with the US, which imposed its own import growth quotas of 7.5% instead.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

When the EU announced their new quotas to replace the lapsed MFA, Chinese manufacturers accelerated their shipping of the goods intended for the European market. This used up a full year's quota almost immediately. {{citation needed|date=November 2014}} As a result, 75 million items of imported Chinese garments were held in European ports in August 2005. A diplomatic resolution was reached at the beginning of September 2005 during [[Tony Blair]]'s visit to China, putting an end to a situation the UK press had dubbed "Bra Wars".

According to the [[World Trade Organization]]'s statistics, [[Pakistan]]'s exports of wooden furniture amounted to $51 million in 2011.&lt;ref name=Tribune&gt;http://tribune.com.pk/story/523400/furniture-industry-enjoys-boom-despite-energy-security-woes/, The Express Tribune newspaper, Published 20 March 2013, Retrieved 17 July 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The furniture industry in Pakistan has been expanding. Many new furniture companies are now joining the furniture industry.&lt;ref name=Tribune/&gt; Our handmade furniture is in high demand by high-end customers. Pakistani furniture manufacturers have expertise in this area, due to the type of wood used namely 'sheesham' (rosewood) which adds to this furniture's demand.&lt;ref name=Tribune2/&gt; The leading wood-furniture-making areas of Pakistan are [[Chiniot]], [[Gujrat City|Gujrat]], [[Peshawar]], [[Lahore]] and [[Karachi]].&lt;ref name=Tribune3/&gt;

==Impact of increased consumer spending==
Consumer spending increased by an average of 26% - per the Bloomberg’s report, which was published on November 21, 2013. It’s not only that the [[Fast-moving consumer goods]] (FMCGs) companies get benefits from increased consumer spending; the furniture manufacturers also benefit from it.

==Pakistan’s furniture exports==
As per [[World Trade Organization]]’s statistics, the wooden furniture exports of Pakistan reportedly amounted to almost $51 million in the calendar year (CY) 2011.&lt;ref name=Tribune2&gt;http://tribune.com.pk/story/520366/pakistans-furniture-makers-in-need-of-international-attention/, The Express Tribune newspaper, Published 14 March 2013, Retrieved 17 July 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas, in 2009-2010 the furniture exports of Pakistan ranged between $25 million to $30 million (excluding undocumented exports of an approximate amount of $10 million). However, according to the [http://www.fiedmc.com.pk/ All Pakistan Furniture Exporters Association (APFEA)] founder Mr. Turhan Baig Muhammad, these exports represent a very small portion of the total furniture business of the country. According to him, the local furniture market is almost 50 times stronger than that of the exports. Keeping this in view, the approximate total furniture sale of the country is more than $2.5 billion.&lt;ref name=Tribune2/&gt; 

==Fears for the furniture industry of Pakistan==

Total world trade of furniture is estimated to be $23.2 billion. Wood furniture accounts for 77 percent, metal furniture 17 percent, and plastic furniture 6 percent of the total.&lt;ref name=Tribune3/&gt; In 2010, the share of Pakistan in the international furniture market is trivial. Even though the country takes pride in having a history of craftsmanship, it does not share a significant position in the international wood furniture market.&lt;ref name=Tribune3&gt;http://tribune.com.pk/story/19304/prospects-and-fears-for-pakistans-furniture-industry/ 'Fears for Pakistan's furniture industry', The Express Tribune newspaper, Published 7 June 2010, Retrieved 17 July 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Domestic furniture industry is suffering because furniture exports to Pakistan from some other countries have increased, whereas, the high cost of furniture-making business is increasing problems for the local furniture manufacturers. The prices of raw materials which includes timber, colour paints, chipboard, polish materials, and foams have increased manifold. Due to unchecked deforestation, timber production of the country is also suffering.
 
Wood furniture industry of Pakistan is categorised as being small because old obsolete machinery is used in this industry, which is the reason for higher cost and low output. Traditional wood furniture in Pakistan is heavy and bulky. Pakistani furniture industry needs to go to light-weight and moveable furniture to be exported to the world market where demand is high to meet the needs of offices, shopping malls, buildings and shopping plazas.&lt;ref name=Tribune4/&gt;

Pakistan furniture council urges the government to bar furniture imports.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessplustv.pk/2016/09/pakistan-furniture-council-urges-government-to-impose-ban-on-import-of-furniture/|title=Business Plus|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mostly, office furniture, bar stools, visitor chairs are imported from other countries and there is a huge demand for these products in Pakistan. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.apnafurniture.pk/general/exclusive-market-report-office-chairs-remain-moderately-demand-october-2018/|title=Demand for imported office chairs in Pakistan|last=|first=|date=|website=Apnafurniture|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chinioti Furniture==
A large amount of the Pakistan’s furniture demand is met by Chinioti furniture. [[Chiniot]], a city in Pakistan, is acknowledged for producing ''beautifully carved wood furniture and handicrafts''.&lt;ref&gt;https://vimeo.com/110446781, [[Chiniot]] city famous for its wood furniture on vimeo.com website, Retrieved 17 July 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Furniture City in Faisalabad==
The ''Faisalabad Industrial Estate Development and Management Company'' (FIEDMC) has plans, in 2014, to set up a furniture city in the industrial area of [[Faisalabad]], Pakistan. According to a news source, wood seasoning plants will be established to manufacture international standard furniture.&lt;ref name=Tribune4/&gt;

In this regard, FIEDMC has joined hands with the European-based [[IKEA]] company, the world's largest furniture retailer that designs and sells ready-to-assemble furniture, for the development of the furniture city in Faisalabad. The same report tells that by this initiative about 200,000 job opportunities will be created.&lt;ref name=Tribune4&gt;http://tribune.com.pk/story/724213/furniture-city-on-the-cards-to-promote-industry-exports/ 'Furniture City on the cards', Published 20 June 2014, Retrieved 17 July 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of IT in the furniture industry of Pakistan==
Local furniture manufacturers are using internet to market their products. They also have started to use social media channels to market their business activities.

==Improvements in furniture industry==
"Pakistan needs to bring improvements to its furniture industry to increase the total revenue generated from this industry", said the Pakistani Federal Minister for Commerce, ''Khurram Dastagir''.&lt;ref name=Dawn/&gt; The country does not lack resources and skills when it comes to manufacturing quality furniture. However, there is a need to exploit these resources in order to expand the furniture industry of Pakistan and increase international trade and foreign exchange income from it. The market beyond Pakistani borders is substantially larger tha the local market.&lt;ref name=Dawn&gt;http://www.dawn.com/news/1218048, 'Furniture producers urged to explore foreign markets', [[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]] newspaper, Published 7 Nov 2015, Retrieved 17 July 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, a '''permanent fund''' is one of the five [[Fund Accounting|governmental fund]] types established by [[U.S. generally accepted accounting principles|GAAP]]. It is classified as a restricted true endowment fund for governments and non-profit organizations. Put simply, a permanent fund may be used to generate and disburse money to those entitled to receive payments by qualification or agreement, as in the case of Alaska citizens or residents that satisfy the rules for payment from their permanent fund from State oil revenues. It was first introduced through [[List of GASB Statements|GASB Statement 34]]. The name of the fund comes from the purpose of the fund: a sum of equity used to permanently generate payments to maintain some financial obligation. Also, a fund can only be classified as a permanent fund if the money is used to report the status of a restricted financial resource. The resource is restricted in the sense that '''only earnings from the resource are used and not the principal'''. For example, a fund can be classified as a permanent fund if it is being used to pay for accounting services for a perpetual endowment of a government-run cemetery or [[financial endowment]]s towards a government-run library.

A common misconception is that permanent funds are required for special-purpose government entities that solely engage in business-type activities. However, this is not the case. According to Statement 34, that special-purpose government entity needs only to report the net balance of the restricted resources.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7722">{{Main|Pre-conception counseling}}
'''Pre-conception counseling in the United States''' allows for optimization of [[prenatal care in the United States|US prenatal care]]. ''Pre-conception counseling'' is a meeting with a health-care professional (generally a [[physician]] or [[midwife]]) by a woman ''before'' attempting to become [[pregnant]]. It generally includes a ''pre-conception risk assessment'' for any potential [[complications of pregnancy]].

==Obstacles to pre-conception counseling in the United States==
Obstacles to pre-conception counseling in the United States include:
*It is too late in unintended pregnancies. The rate of [[Unintended pregnancy#United States of America|Unintended pregnancy in the United States]] is approximately 49%.&lt;ref name="Hatcher20th"&gt;{{cite book

*Women not knowing, realizing, or understanding the benefits of visiting their physician or [[midwife]] before trying to become pregnant.
*Another common obstacle to pre-conception counseling and assessment may be the lack of [[health insurance]]. However, most insurances will cover this as a screening visit. Also, many physicians will do the pre-conception screening during a regular office visit or gynecological visit if the woman just informs the doctor of her desire to become pregnant. Most gynecologists will inquire about child-bearing intentions anyway.

==Screening and monitoring in the United States==
[[Screening (medicine)|Screening]] and [[Monitoring (medicine)|monitoring]] of women prior to conception is recommended to include the following:&lt;ref name=icsi2010/&gt;
* Height and weight to calculate [[body mass index|BMI]]
* [[Blood pressure]]
* [[Medical history]]
* [[Abdominal examination|Abdominal]] and [[pelvic examination]]
* [[Pre-conception counseling in the United States#rubella|Rubella]]
* [[Pre-conception counseling in the United States#varicella|Varicella]]
* [[Pre-conception counseling in the United States#Domestic violence|Domestic violence]]
* Depression
* [[Blood lipids]] (cholesterol and HDL)
* [[Cervical screening]]

However, the overall lack of evidence precludes a recommendation for universal screening for [[thyroid disease in pregnancy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Vissenberg | first1 = R. | last2 = Van Den Boogaard | first2 = E. | last3 = Van Wely | first3 = M. | last4 = Van Der Post | first4 = J.

===Rubella screening===
{{anchor|rubella}}
Screening for rubella susceptibility by history of vaccination or by [[serology]] is recommended in the US for all women of childbearing age at their first [[preconception counseling]] visit to reduce incidence of [[congenital rubella syndrome]] (CRS).&lt;ref name=icsi2010&gt;[http://www.icsi.org/prenatal_care_4/prenatal_care__routine__full_version__2.html Health Care Guideline: Routine Prenatal Care. Fourteenth Edition.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705032759/http://www.icsi.org/prenatal_care_4/prenatal_care__routine__full_version__2.html |date=2008-07-05 }} By the Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; It is recommended that all susceptible non-pregnant women of childbearing age should be offered [[rubella vaccination]].&lt;ref name=icsi2010/&gt;

===Varicella screening===
{{anchor|varicella}}
Immunity status of varicella should be performed at the pre-conception counseling session, in order to prevent the occurrence of [[congenital varicella syndrome]] and other adverse effects of [[varicella#pregnancy|varicella in pregnancy]].&lt;ref name=icsi2010/&gt; Generally, a person with a positive [[medical history]] of varicella infection can be considered immune.&lt;ref name=icsi2010/&gt; Among adults in the United States having a negative or uncertain history of varicella, approximately 85%-90% will be immune.&lt;ref name=icsi2010/&gt; Therefore, an effective method is that people with a negative or uncertain history of varicella infection have a [[serology]] to check antibody production before receiving the vaccine.&lt;ref name=icsi2010/&gt; The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] recommends that all adults be immunized if seronegative.&lt;ref name=icsi2010/&gt;

===Domestic violence===
It is recommended to screen for [[domestic violence]] at a preconception visit, because [[domestic violence during pregnancy]] a risk factor for [[miscarriage]], late entry into prenatal care, [[stillbirth]], [[premature labor]] and [[premature birth|birth]], fetal injury and [[low birth weight]], and detection can avail for specific counseling and intervention.&lt;ref name=icsi2010/&gt;

There is evidence that direct interview screening result in a higher rate of reporting prenatal domestic abuse than a written, self-report questionnaire method.&lt;ref name=icsi2010/&gt;

==Education ==
Education of women intending to be pregnant is recommended to include:&lt;ref name=icsi2010/&gt;
*[[Preterm labor]] education and prevention
*Substance use
*Weight and [[nutrition and pregnancy]]
*[[Domestic violence and pregnancy]]
*List of medications, [[dietary supplement]]s, [[herbal supplement]]s
*Accurate recording of menstrual dates
*Counseling in case of potential [[vaginal birth after Caesarean]]

==Vaccination and prophylaxis==
[[Vaccination]] and other prophylaxis of women intending to become pregnant is recommended to include:&lt;ref name=icsi2010/&gt; 
*[[Tdap]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

[[File:Production Possibilities Frontier Curve.svg|thumb|250px|right|An example PPF: points B, C and D are all productively efficient, but an economy at A would not be, because D involves more production of both goods. Point X cannot be achieved.]]
[[File:Productive efficiency.svg|thumb|250px|right|Productive efficiency occurs under competitive equilibrium at the minimum of average total cost for each good, such as the one shown here.]]

'''Productive efficiency''' is a situation in which the [[economy]] could not produce any more of one good without sacrificing production of another good. In other words, productive efficiency occurs when a good or a service is produced at the lowest possible cost. The concept is illustrated on a [[production possibility frontier]] (PPF), where all points on the curve are points of productive efficiency.&lt;ref name="standish"&gt;{{Cite book |first= Barry|last=Standish | title = Economics: Principles and Practice | date =  | publisher = Pearson Education| location =South Africa  | isbn = 978-1-86891-069-4 | pages = 13–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; An equilibrium may be productively efficient without being [[allocative efficiency|allocatively efficient]]&amp;mdash; i.e. it may result in a distribution of goods where [[social welfare]] is not maximized. It is one type of [[economic efficiency]].

Productive efficiency requires that all firms operate using best-practice technological and managerial processes. By improving these processes, an [[economy]] or business can extend its [[production possibility frontier]] outward, so that efficient production yields more output than previously.

Productive inefficiency, with the economy operating below its production possibilities frontier, can occur because the productive inputs [[physical capital]] and labor are underutilized—that is, some capital or labor is left sitting idle—or because these inputs are allocated in inappropriate combinations to the different industries that use them.

In [[long-run equilibrium]] for perfectly competitive markets, productive efficiency occurs at [[perfect competition#Results|the base]] of the [[Average cost|average total cost curve]]&amp;mdash;i.e. where marginal cost equals average total cost&amp;mdash;for each good.

Due to the nature and culture of monopolistic companies, they may not be productively efficient because of [[X-inefficiency]], whereby companies operating in a monopoly have less of an incentive to maximize output due to lack of competition. However, due to economies of scale it can be possible for the profit-maximizing level of output of monopolistic companies to occur with a lower price to the consumer than perfectly competitive companies.

'''Reminders''' is a component of [[iOS]], [[macOS]] and [[watchOS]] that allows users to set notifications for themselves and create lists.&lt;ref name=CNet1&gt;{{cite web|last=Cipriani|first=Jason|title=How to use the iOS 5 Reminders app|url=http://howto.cnet.com/8301-11310_39-20105442-285/how-to-use-the-ios-5-reminders-app/|publisher=CNet|accessdate=January 28, 2013|date=September 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a new feature in [[iOS 5]] and [[OS X Mountain Lion|OS X 10.8 "Mountain Lion"]]. It can sync data between iOS and macOS through [[iCloud]].&lt;ref name=MacWorld1&gt;{{cite web|last=Snell|first=Jason|title=Mountain Lion: Hands on with Notes and Reminders|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/1165410/mountain_lion_hands_on_with_notes_and_reminders.html|publisher=MacWorld|accessdate=January 28, 2013|date=February 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
The Reminders app can have multiple user-created lists of reminders. Reminders appear in the [[Notification Center]] 24 hours before the time a reminder is set for. Each reminder has a title and can be marked as completed (checked), and is automatically hidden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.imore.com/reminders#complete|title=Reminders App: The Ultimate Guide {{!}} iMore|website=www.imore.com|access-date=2017-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, each reminder can optionally have the following:

* A note about the reminder&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* An alarm at a certain date and time. If a time-based alert is set, it can repeat every day, week, two weeks, month, or year.
* An alarm when a [[geofence]] around an area is crossed ("when I leave the conference" or "when I get home")

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2089">[[Count]] '''René Boël''' (1899-1990) was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] industrialist and Director of the ''[[Usines Gustave Boël]]''. He was married with [[Yvonne Solvay]] (1896-1930), granddaughter of [[Ernest Solvay]]. They have two sons [[Yves Boël]] and [[Pol Boël]] and one daughter [[Antoinette Boël]] (1925 - 1982).

==Career==

[[File:Roman Scharf JAJAH.jpg|thumb|Roman Scharf]]'''Roman Scharf''' is a businessman, investor and one of the [[co-founder]]s of [[VoIP]] company [[Jajah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/mobility/voip/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=203103122|title=Jajah Launches Its Direct 'VoIP Without A PC' Service|last=Gardner|first=W. David|date=November 19, 2007|publisher=InformationWeek|accessdate=2 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

[[Austrians|Austrian]] Roman Scharf graduated from [[Vienna University of Economics and Business Administration]], receiving an excellency award from the [[European Commission]] for his thesis on "Environmental Management and Eco-Auditing"{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}.  This marked the completion of an international academic career touching down in Austria, [[Russia]], the [[UK]] and [[Denmark]].

After one year of working for the European Commission GD XXIII in [[Brussels]], Roman eventually started his career as a management consultant.  Soon after, he became a managing partner in [[Vienna]]-based consulting firm ECOS Consulting, where he developed expertise in executing large, complex projects on a pan-European basis.

In 1999 Roman was named senior consultant for Central and Eastern Europe. His position and competence opened opportunities for future responsibilities in strategic consulting around Europe, namely advisory positions for a variety of enterprises, mostly in the IT industry.

In 2001 Roman became an original [[angel investor]] in Ecotech Software GmbH{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}, a provider of software solutions for architects and engineers, whose management team he later joined.  He was responsible for Business Development and Marketing for the Ecotech Group, as well as Executive Manager of Ecotech Software Germany - the group's main branch.  In 2004 Ecotech was acquired by Rockwool international{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}.

== Jajah ==
In late 2004, Roman teamed up with [[Daniel Mattes]] to form Jajah. At the company, Roman focuses on strategic product development, marketing and public relations. Roman successfully invited Yair Goldfinger to join the board and [[Guy Kawasaki]] to become an advisor at Jajah. In 2007, Scharf announced that Jajah had secured $15m investment from [[Intel]]. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/technology/article1773335.ece|title=Skype competitor wins Intel backing|last=Richards|first=Jonathan|date=May 10, 2007|work=[[The Times]]|accessdate=2 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
JAJAH has been acquired by O2/Telefónica in December 2009 for US $207 million in an all-cash transaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://gigaom.com/2009/12/23/o2-jajah/|title=SO2/Telefónica Buys Jajah for $207M|last=Malik|first=Om|date=Dec 23, 2009|work=[[GigaOm]]|accessdate=2 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2437">'''Rudolf Vanmoerkerke''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈrydɔlf fɑˈmuːrkɛrkə}};&lt;ref&gt;In isolation, ''Vanmoerkerke'' is pronounced {{IPA-nl|vɑˈmuːrkɛrkə|}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 7 October 1924  – 4 December 2014) was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] businessman and a pioneer of the Belgian [[travel industry]]. He was the former president of the [[basketball]] club [[BC Oostende|Sunair (later Telindus, now Base) Oostende]].

==Career==
In 1953 he founded the ''West Belgian Coach Company'', with which he organised bus tours on the European continent especially for [[United Kingdom|British]] customers. In 1968, he bought the ailing tour operator Sunair, and started to offer air travel vacations.

Six years later he merged all his business in Sun International, which became the dominant travel group in Belgium and in 1984, was registered on the Belgian stock market. In 1976, he started his own airline company [[Air Belgium (1979–2000)|Air Belgium]], as a counterpart of [[Trans European Airways]] (TEA) of his competitor Sunsnacks. He bought several tour operators in the [[Netherlands]], [[France]] and the [[United Kingdom]], but only on the British market Vanmoerkerke got a foothold. In 1987, he built the first Sun Parks resort in [[Oostduinkerke]].

Financial problems and the departure of the German group ITS/[[Kaufhof]] from the company capital led to the [[disinvestment]] of Air Belgium and later also Sunair. After the sale, his son [[Mark Vanmoerkerke]] became the owner of Sun Parks.

Vanmoerkerke later occupied himself with the insurance company Sun Assistance and the venture capital company Sofidev, in which also [[Sofina]] participates.

Vanmoerkerke died on 4 December 2014, aged 90.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.standaard.be/cnt/dmf20141209_01420179 Zakenman Rudolf Vanmoerkerke overleden op 90-jarige leeftijd]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11981">A '''secured loan''' is a [[loan]] in which the borrower pledges some asset (e.g. a car or property) as [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] for the loan, which then becomes a '''secured debt''' owed to the creditor who gives the loan. The debt is thus secured against the collateral, and if the borrower [[default (finance)|defaults]], the creditor takes possession of the asset used as collateral and may sell it to regain some or all of the amount originally loaned to the borrower. An example is the [[foreclosure]] of a home. From the creditor's perspective, that is a category of [[debt]] in which a lender has been granted a portion of the [[bundle of rights]] to specified property. If the sale of the collateral does not raise enough money to pay off the debt, the creditor can often obtain a [[deficiency judgment]] against the borrower for the remaining amount.

The opposite of secured debt/loan is [[unsecured debt]], which is not connected to any specific piece of property. Instead, the creditor may satisfy the debt only against the borrower, rather than the borrower's collateral and the borrower. Generally speaking, secured debt may attract lower interest rates than unsecured debt because of the added security for the lender; however, credit risk (e.g. credit history, and ability to repay) and expected returns for the lender are also factors affecting rates.&lt;ref name="McCormack2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gerard McCormack|title=Secured credit under English and American law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=csTgg-F1EpsC&amp;pg=PA16|accessdate=13 December 2011|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-82670-9|pages=16–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''secured loan'' is used in the United Kingdom, but the United States more commonly uses ''secured debt''.

==Purpose==
There are two purposes for a loan secured by debt. In the first purpose, by extending the loan through securing the debt, the creditor is relieved of most of the financial risks involved because it allows the [[creditor]] to take ownership of the property in the event that the debt is not properly repaid. In exchange, this permits the second purpose where the [[debtor]]s may receive [[loan]]s on more favorable terms than that available for [[unsecured debt]], or to be extended [[Credit (finance)|credit]] under circumstances when [[Credit (finance)|credit]] under terms of [[unsecured debt]] would not be extended at all. The creditor may offer a loan with attractive interest rates and repayment periods for the secured debt.

==Types==
*A [[mortgage loan]] is a secured loan in which the collateral is property, such as a home.
*A [[nonrecourse debt|nonrecourse loan]] is a secured loan where the collateral is the only security or claim the creditor has against the borrower, and the creditor has no further recourse against the borrower for any deficiency remaining after foreclosure against the property.
*A [[foreclosure]] is a legal process in which mortgaged property is sold to pay the debt of the defaulting borrower.
*A [[repossession]] is a process in which property, such as a car, is taken back by the creditor when the borrower does not make payments due on the property. Depending on the jurisdiction, it may or may not require a court order.

==UK secured loan market==
Before the global economic crisis of 2006, the [[Financial Services Authority]] (FSA) estimated that the UK secured loan market had a net worth of £7,000,000,000. However, following the close of [[Lehman Brothers]]' sub-prime lender BNC Mortgage in August 2007, the UK's most prominent secured loan providers were forced to withdraw from the market.

Previous to this, secured loans fell under the remit of the Office of Fair Trading and firms issuing and brokering secured loans required no authorisation from the FCA. The FCA's involvement dramatically changed the secured loan landscape by putting into place more protection for the consumer.
* '''21st March 2016''': the FCA introduced The Mortgage Credit Directive&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/mortgage-credit-directive|title=Mortgage Credit Directive|last=|first=|date=22 August 2017|website=FCA|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which meant all regulated first-charge and second-charge mortgage contracts are treated in exactly the same way. The MCD was set up to protect consumers by governing first- and second-charge mortgage markets (as well as consumer buy-to-lets) under the same regulation, and to provide a harmonised approach to mortgage regulation across the EU. Following the introduction of the MCD mortgage brokers and advisers were required to inform their clients that a second-charge mortgage could be a better alternative to a remortgage or further advance.

==United States law==
The United States is the global leader in [[security interest]] law with respect to personal property; in the 1940s, it was the first country to develop and enact the notion of a "unified" security interest. That concept has since spread to many countries around the world after it became evident that it is one of the reasons for why the United States has the strongest economy in the world.{{dubious|reason=pinning this as "one of the reasons" requires a strong support in reliable sources|date=November 2018}}{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} For example, to raise money, American ranchers could pledge personal property like cattle in certain ways that historically were impossible or very difficult in Uruguay or most other developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;Heywood Fleisig, [http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/1996/06/pdf/fleisig.pdf "Secured Transactions: The Power of Collateral,"] ''Finance and Development'', 44–46.&lt;/ref&gt; However, US law with respect to security interests in real property is still{{When|date=November 2018}} extremely chaotic and non-uniform. The [[Uniform Law Commission]] in the 1970s and 1980s worked hard to develop [[uniform act]]s to clean it up but the project was a catastrophic failure.&lt;ref&gt;Marion W. Benfield, Jr., ''Wasted Days and Wasted Nights: Why the Land Acts Failed'', 20 Nova L. Rev. 1037, 1037–41 (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Benton Brown, ''Whatever Happened to the Uniform Land Transactions Act?'' 20 Nova L. Rev. 1017 (1996);&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter B. Maggs, ''The Uniform Simplification of Land Transfers Act and the Politics and Economics of Law Reform,'' 20 Nova L. Rev. 1091, 1091–92 (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of [[real estate]], the most common form of '''secured debt''' is the [[lien]]. Liens may either be voluntarily created, as with a [[mortgage law|mortgage]], or involuntarily created, such as a [[mechanics lien]]. A mortgage may only be created with the express consent of the [[title owner]], without regard to other facts of the situation. In contrast, the primary condition required to create a [[mechanics lien]] is that [[real estate]] is somehow improved through the [[manual labour|work]] or materials provided by the person filing a [[mechanics lien]]. Although the rules are complex, consent of the [[title owner]] to the [[mechanics lien]] itself is not required.

In the case of [[personal property]], the most common procedure for securing the [[debt]] is regulated under Article 9 of the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] (UCC). This uniform act provides a relatively uniform interstate system of forms and public filing of documents by which the [[creditor]] establishes the priority of their security interest in the [[property]] of the debtor. 

In the event that the underlying [[debt]] is not properly paid, the [[creditor]] may decide to [[foreclose]] the interest in order to take the [[property]]. Generally, the law that allows the '''secured debt''' to be made also provides a procedure whereby the property will be sold at [[public auction]], or through some other means of sale. The law commonly also provides a [[right of redemption]], whereby a debtor may arrange for late payment of the [[debt]] but keep the property.

===How secured debt is created===
Debt can become secured by a [[contractual agreement]], [[Lien#Statutory liens|statutory lien]], or [[judgment lien]]. Contractual agreements can be secured by either a [[security interest|purchase money security interest]] (PMSI) loan, where the creditor takes a security interest in the items purchased (i.e. vehicle, furniture, electronics); or, a [[non-purchase money security interest]] (NPMSI) loan, where the creditor takes a security interest in items that the debtor already owns.

'''The Fund for American Studies''' is a [[non-profit organization]] based in [[Washington, D.C.]] Founded in 1967, the organization's stated goal is "to change the world by developing leaders for a free society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.tfas.org/Page.aspx?pid=1912|publisher=The Fund For American Studies|accessdate=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; TFAS is a conservative organization specializing in the free market.

==History==
[[File:Fund for American Studies headquarters.JPG|thumb|The Fund for American Studies headquarters located in the [[Dupont Circle]] neighborhood of [[Washington, D.C.]]]]
In 1967, [[Charles Edison]] took the first steps toward establishing the institution that is known today as The Fund for American Studies. Edison was a former governor of New Jersey, Secretary of the Navy and son of inventor [[Thomas Alva Edison]].

Concerned about an eroding confidence in the American system of government, Edison recruited [[Walter H. Judd]], David R. Jones, [[Marvin Liebman]], and [[William F. Buckley,&amp;nbsp;Jr.]], to build a program that would educate college students about American government, politics, and economics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frohnen|first1=Bruce|last2=Beer|first2=Jeremy|last3=Jeffrey|first3=Nelson|title=American Conservatism: An Encyclopedia|date=2014|publisher=Open Road Media|isbn=9781497651579}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 6, 1967, the group incorporated the Charles Edison Youth Fund. In 1969 Governor Edison died suddenly. To honor him and carry on his mission, the organization was renamed the Charles Edison Memorial Youth Fund. In 1985 the organization was renamed again to its present-day title, The Fund for American Studies. In the summer of 1970, the Edison Fund organized the inaugural Institute on Comparative Political and Economic Systems. Fifty-seven students attended the first Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Messer-Davidow|first1=Ellen|title=Disciplining Feminism: From Social Activism to Academic Discourse|date=2002|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=9780822383581|page=239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{finance sidebar}}
'''Trade finance''' signifies financing for trade, and it concerns both domestic and international trade transactions. A trade transaction requires a seller of goods and services as well as a buyer. Various intermediaries such as [[bank]]s and [[financial institutions]] can facilitate these transactions by financing the trade.

==Description==
While a seller (or [[exporter]]) can require the purchaser (an [[importer]]) to prepay for goods [[shipping|shipped]], the purchaser (importer) may wish to reduce risk by requiring the seller to document the goods that have been shipped. [[Bank]]s may assist by providing various forms of support. For example, the importer's bank may provide a [[letter of credit]] to the exporter (or the exporter's bank) providing for payment upon presentation of certain documents, such as a [[bill of lading]]. The exporter's bank may make a loan (by advancing funds) to the exporter on the basis of the export contract.

Other forms of trade finance can include [[Documentary Collection]], Trade Credit Insurance, Finetrading, [[Factoring (finance)|Factoring]] or [[Forfaiting]]. Some forms are specifically designed to supplement traditional financing.

Secure trade finance depends on verifiable and secure tracking of physical risks and events in the chain between exporter and importer. The advent of new information and communication technologies allows the development of risk mitigation models which have developed into advance finance models. This allows very low risk of advance payment given to the Exporter, while preserving the Importer's normal payment credit terms and without burdening the importer's [[balance sheet]]. As trade transactions become more flexible and increase in volume, demand for these technologies has grown.

==Products and services==
Banks and financial institutions offer the following products and services in their trade finance branches.

* [[Letter of credit]]: It is an undertaking/promise given by a Bank/Financial Institute on behalf of the Buyer/Importer to the Seller/Exporter, that, if the Seller/Exporter presents the complying documents to the Buyer's designated Bank/Financial Institute as specified by the Buyer/Importer in the Purchase Agreement then the Buyer's Bank/Financial Institute will make payment to the Seller/Exporter.
* [[Bank guarantee]]: It is an undertaking/promise given by a Bank on behalf of the Applicant and in favour of the Beneficiary. Whereas, the Bank has agreed and undertakes that, if the Applicant failed to fulfill his obligations either Financial or Performance as per the Agreement made between the Applicant and the Beneficiary, then the Guarantor Bank on behalf of the Applicant will make payment of the guarantee amount to the Beneficiary upon receipt of a demand or claim from the Beneficiary.'''
Bank guarantee has various types like
1. Tender Bond
2. Advance Payment
3. Performance Bond
4. Financial
5. Retention
6. Labour
7. ready for basic analysis
* [[Export]]
* [[Import]]
* Collection and discounting of bills: It is a major trade service offered by the Banks. The Seller's Bank collects the payment proceeds on behalf of the Seller, from the Buyer or Buyer's Bank, for the goods sold by the Seller to the Buyer as per the agreement made between the Seller and the Buyer.

Supply Chain intermediaries have expanded in recent years to offer importers a funded transaction of individual trades from foreign supplier to importers warehouse or customers designated point of receipt. The Supply Chain products offer importers a funded transaction based on customer order book.

==Methods of payment==
Popular methods of [[payment]] used in [[international trade]] include:

'''cash with order(CWO)'''-the buyers pay [[cash]] when he places an order.

'''cash on delivery(COD)'''-the buyer pays cash when the goods are delivered.

'''documentary credit(L/C)'''-a [[Letter of credit]] (L/C) is used; gives the seller two guarantees that the payment will be made by the buyer:one guarantee from the buyer's [[bank]] and another from the seller's bank.

'''bills for collection(B/E or D/C)''' -here a [[Bill of exchange|Bill of Exchange]] (B/E)is used; or documentary collection (D/C) is a transaction whereby the exporter entrusts the collection of the payment for a sale to its bank (remitting bank), which sends the documents that its buyer needs to the importer’s bank (collecting bank), with instructions to release the documents to the buyer for payment.

'''open account'''-this method can be used by [[business partner]]s who trust each other; the two partners need to have their accounts with the banks that are [[correspondent bank]]s.

==History==
[[Wiredset]], a digital marketing agency, created the first version of Trendrr called Infofilter in 2006. Infofilter pulled time-series data and pushed it into graphs and charts, without the interactive features such as mash-ups and scratch pad. The reporting function was manual, and access to the platform was deemed private.

As the demand for the platform expanded beyond specific client needs, Infofilter evolved into Trendrr in April 2007.

June 2009 saw the launch of Trendrr Pro, marking Trendrr's shift from a free service to a [[freemium]] model.&lt;ref name="Mashable2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2009/06/29/trendrr-freemium/|title=Trend Spotting Service Trendrr Switches to Freemium Model|last=Schroeder|first=Stan|publisher=Mashable|date=June 29, 2009|accessdate=2009-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to  the features included in the free version, Trendrr Pro allows users to track a greater number of data sets, receive unlimited alerts, and create custom reports.&lt;ref name=RWW/&gt; Users can also import their own data via Trendrr's [[API]].

Trendrr announced Curatorr as the latest addition to the Trendrr suite in February 2010.  Curatorr is a real time dashboard that enables users to identify conversation around a topic. Users can search real-time Twitter conversation, filter the relevant conversation, and then publish the curated stream to television, phone, and internet.&lt;ref name="RWW2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/curatorr_a_twitter_tool_for_media_companies.php |title=Curatorr: A Twitter Tool for Media Companies |publisher=Readwriteweb.com |accessdate=2015-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 22, 2010, Curatorr was used by MTV to filter and publish tweets during a live broadcast of the [[Hope for Haiti]] concert.&lt;ref name=RWW2/&gt;

A '''vacuum fryer''' is a [[deep-frying]] device housed inside a [[vacuum]] chamber.

Vacuum fryers are fit to process low-quality [[potato]]es that contain higher sugar levels than normal, as they frequently have to be processed in spring and early summer before the potatoes from the new [[harvest]] become available. With vacuum frying it is easier to maintain natural colors and flavours of the finished product. Due to the lower [[temperature]]s applied (approx. {{convert|130|°C|°F}}), the formation of suspected [[carcinogen]] [[acrylamide]] is significantly lower than in standard atmospheric fryers, where the frying temperature is approx. {{convert|170|°C|°F}}. The [[fat]] absorption of the products is also reported to be lower than in atmospheric fryers. In South East Asia (mainly [[Philippines]], [[Thailand]], [[China]] and [[Indonesia]]) batch type vacuum fryers are mainly used for the production of fruit chips. However, these machines are only appropriate for relatively small production companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Granda|first=C.|last2=Moreira|first2=R.g.|last3=Tichy|first3=S.e.|date=2004-10-01|title=Reduction of Acrylamide Formation in Potato Chips by Low-temperature Vacuum Frying|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2621.2004.tb09903.x/abstract|journal=Journal of Food Science|language=en|volume=69|issue=8|pages=E405–E411|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2621.2004.tb09903.x|issn=1750-3841}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Continuous vacuum fryers==
For larger production quantities, continuous vacuum fryers are available. In these installations, the [[vacuum]] [[frying pan]] is installed in a [[stainless steel]] vacuum tube. The infeed of the raw product is carried out through a rotary [[airlock]].
Depending on the application, the frying pan itself is designed to meet the different product specifications. A transport belt takes the finished product out of the fryer and towards the outfeed system. A lock chamber at the exit of the vacuum tube prevents air from entering the vacuum zone, and a belt system takes the product from one zone to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ift.confex.com/ift/2002/techprogram/paper_10613.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311024700/http://ift.confex.com/ift/2002/techprogram/paper_10613.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-03-11|title=91C-19 Vacuum frying of potato chips|date=2012-03-11|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.airfryervergelijken.nl/|title=Airfryer, gezonder frituren - alle informatie op airfryervergelijken.nl|website=Airfryervergelijken.nl|language=nl-NL|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vacuum is created by [[vacuum pump]]s, and the whole system is controlled by a [[programmable logic controller]].

In batch fryers, the frying oil has to be replaced quite often as it is sensitive to temperature changes. Continuous vacuum fryers lead to a longer lifetime of the frying oil and therefore lower the production costs. Vacuum fryers can also reduce oil content in fried foods. The amount of reduced oil content, usually 1–3%, depends on the type of vacuum fryer.&lt;ref&gt; Journal of Food Engineering

'''Walter Goodall''' (1706? – 1766) was a Scottish historical writer, born in [[Banffshire]], and educated at [[King's College, Aberdeen|King's College]], [[University of Aberdeen]].  Later he became assistant librarian to the [[Advocates' Library]] in [[Edinburgh]].

In 1754 Goodall published an ''Examination of the Letters said to have been written by Mary Queen of Scots'' on [[Casket letters]]. Printing the letters, he contested their authenticity. He also edited [[John of Fordun]]'s ''[[Scotichronicon]]'' (1759).

==Life==
He was the eldest son of John Goodall, a farmer in Banffshire. He was educated at King's College, Old Aberdeen, which he entered in 1723, but left without taking a degree. In 1730 he obtained employment in the Advocates' Library, Edinburgh, and in 1735 became sub-librarian.&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Goodall, Walter (1706?-1766)|volume=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goodall died in poverty 28 July 1766.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

==Works==
Walter Goodall aided the principal librarian [[Thomas Ruddiman]] in the compilation of the catalogue of the Advocates' Library, printed in 1742.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

In 1753 Goodall edited a new issue of the garbled ''Memoirs of the Affairs of Scotland'', originally published by [[David Crawford (historian)|David Crawford]]. His interest in the partisan ''Memoirs'' was connected with the favourable representation they contained of the career of Queen Mary. He planned to write her life, and published in 1754, in two volumes, an ''Examination of the Letters said to be written by Mary Queen of Scots to James, Earl of Bothwell''. This work presaged the apologist period of the literature relating to the queen.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

In 1754 also, Goodall published an edition, with emendations, of [[Scot of Scotstarvet]]'s ''Staggering State of Scots Statesmen'', and an edition of [[James Balfour, Lord Pittendreich]]'s ''Practicks'', with preface and life. He assisted [[Robert Keith (historian)|Robert Keith]] in the preparation of his ''New Catalogue of Scottish Bishops'', for which he supplied the preliminary account of the [[Culdees]]. He denied that the [[Scotia]] of the early writers was Ireland (not Scotland), and that those first termed [[Scoti]] were really emigrants from Ireland; he affirmed that Ireland's other ancient name [[Ierne (disambiguation)|Ierne]] belonged also to Scotland. The ''glacialis Ierne'', which, according to [[Claudian]], wept for her slain Scots, was in his opinion the valley of [[Strathearn]], the seat of an ancient Celtic earldom.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

Goodall published in 1759 an edition of Fordun's ''Scotichronicon'', with a Latin introduction on the antiquities of Scotland, and a dissertation on the marriage of [[Robert III of Scotland|Robert III]]. An English translation of the introduction appeared separately in 1769.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;
