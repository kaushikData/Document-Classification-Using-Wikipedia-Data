[[File:Coryphaenoides armatus.jpg|thumb|Abyssal grenadier, ''Coryphaenoides armatus'']]
The '''abyssal grenadier''', ''Coryphaenoides armatus'', is an [[abyssal zone|abyssal]] fish of the genus ''[[Coryphaenoides]]'', found in all the world's oceans, at depths between 800 and 4,000 m.  Its adult length is 20 to 40&amp;nbsp;cm, although Fishbase&lt;ref name = FB/&gt; gives lengths up to 1 m. The abyssal grenadier's body is unique in that it contains two dorsal spines and about 124 dorsal soft rays, which are the flexible jointed rays supporting a fin nearest to the back in the spinal column. It has no anal spines, but has 115 anal soft rays along its body. The head and eyes of this fish are very large, while the mouth is very small. The color of the abyssal grenadier is brown apart from the abdomen, which is bluish.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, D.M., T. Inada, T. Iwamoto and N. Scialabba. 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MICHAEL ALLABY. "spiny fin ray." A Dictionary of Zoology. 1999. Encyclopedia.com. 23 Jun. 2010 &lt;http://www.encyclopedia.com&gt;{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Coryphaenoides armatus'' occurs at the deep-slope, on the upper [[continental slope|continental rise]] between 2,000 m and 4,700 m. Its diet changes as it matures, from benthic invertebrates such as crustaceans and [[Holothuroidea|holothuroid]]s when young to [[mesopelagic]] and [[bathypelagic]] fish, [[sea urchin]]s and [[cephalopod]]s when adult. Examination of the stomach contents of specimens collected by trawling below 2,600 m deep in the [[Hudson Canyon]] showed that an important proportion of the diet of ''C. armatus'' is caught in the deep mesopelagic and bathypelagic regions. Very few ripe females, and no spent individuals have been collected, and this is suggestive of this species being [[semelparous]].&lt;ref name = IUCN/&gt;

[[File:Bochum Musikforum with tower.jpg|thumb|The music hall. Foyer in the former church of St. Mary.]]
The '''Anneliese Brost Musikforum Ruhr''' is a [[music hall]] for classical music. It is located in [[Bochum]], Germany. It was opened on 28 October 2016. The building consists of three parts: an auditorium holding up to 1026 people, the entrance area in the middle (which is in the [[desacralized]] church of St. Marien), and a second hall which holds an audience of up to 250 people. The big hall is designed for [[symphony|symphonic]] concerts, the smaller one for [[chamber music]]. 

[[File:Bochum Musikforum interior west.jpg|thumb|Foyer at opening]]
The hall is the home location of the ''[[Bochumer Symphoniker]]'' orchestra. The decision to build the Anneliese Brost Musikforum Ruhr was made with considerable backing from the American composer, [[Steven Sloane]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2877">The '''Anti-War Coalition''' (AWC) is a coalition of South African anti-war activists. It could have links to the international [[Stop the War Coalition]] but has instead chosen to involve itself with local politics, in particular the [[Workers International Vanguard League]]. AWC helped organise [[protests against the 2003 Iraq war]] in Cape Town and Johannesburg.

==Formation==
The AWC came about shortly after the formation of the international [[Stop the War Campaign]] and the involvement by the governing [[African National Congress]] (ANC), [[Communist Party of South Africa]], [[Congress of South African Trade Unions]], and [[South African Council of Churches]]. It claims to be a more radical alternative coalition of independent community and solidarity groups endorsed by around 300 organisations.

==Activities==
The Anti-War Coalition is most widely known for its role in the protests that spanned from 20-24 of September, 2006. These protests took place in two parts at the Air Force Base in Ysterplaat, Cape Town. This was to oppose the International Weapons Fair.

==Key messages==
Slogans such as Stop the War, War is no Solution, and Stop United States Imperialism have been used at rallies.

==Internal conflicts, ANC &amp; WIVL criticism==
An attempt to bring together AWC and ANC at a meeting on February 2003 failed. ANC policy director [[Michael Sachs]] told the meeting that the ANC leaders were uncomfortable with the more vigorously [[anti-imperialist]] language of the AWC. The rift grew bigger when Sachs falsely claimed that the Stop the War Campaign, rather than the AWC, had organized the [[February 15, 2003 anti-war protest#South Africa|February 15th protests]].  Because of this, the AWC refused to have ANC speakers on the stage of its Johannesburg anti-war rally.{{Ref|bond}}

The AWC has also been criticised for being too closely allied to the [[Workers International Vanguard League]] WIVL at the expense of broader issues that affect international peace and justice. In effect, AWC is WIVL, and the organisation continues to operate without consulting of its membership or affiliates.

==Allied groups==
===War is a Drag and Laugh not War===
Two small, independent anti-militarist outfits that participated in the February 15th campaign and loosely associated with the AWC. Their aim was to introduce a more pacifist style to the revolutionary rhetoric of the AWC and power-mongering of the supposed Stop the War Campaign.

'''BMIR''' 94.5 [[FM broadcasting|FM]] ('''Burning Man Information Radio''') is the unlicensed [[community radio]] station for [[Burning Man]], an event held annually in [[Black Rock Desert]], [[Nevada]]. BMIR begins broadcasting on 94.5 FM on the [[Black Rock Desert|playa]] in the week leading up to Burning Man and [[internet radio|broadcasts over the internet]] year-round. Currently, the station hosts more than 40 [[Radio personality|DJs]] that produce the programming played over the course of the event.

==History==
BMIR was founded by Carmen Mauk in 2000. Although the station violates federal regulations related to [[pirate radio]] and licensing radio stations id not in jurisdiction of the [[Bureau of Land Management]], BMIR is a required aspect of the event special use permit (SRP).  Other licensed radio stations do exist that are within broadcast range of the Burning Man event however the event depends upon its self operated pirate radio station.  During the period of the Burning Man Festival appears to remain operational and no enforcement action has been successful by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) to shut the station down. The station is currently managed by two project managers, Bobzilla and Kanizzle.

Prior to 2010, BMIR only broadcast live during the day, with automated nighttime programming. Starting in 2010, BMIR began broadcasting 24-hours a day with live radio personalities and interviews. This change allowed for the radio station to move into a prominent position at the event, moving away from its purely informational roots into a form of full-time entertainment for participants and staff at the event.

==Current Status==
BMIR usually broadcasts from the event from the Wednesday before to the Tuesday after, with a full-time staff present during that time. When not at the event, the stream broadcasts primarily from the [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]]. BMIR is utilized during the event to broadcast important information regarding traffic, weather, and other BLM/LEO notices. The station has played a prominent part in dealing with issues happening in the "default world" including [[Hurricane Katrina]] and [[earthquake]]s in the Bay Area.

The station's primary operating crew is composed of a wide variety of skill sets, including and [[Broadcast engineering|RF/FM engineer]], a [[Audio engineer|sound engineer]], and [[Computer network|IT engineer]], and a full-time [[Volunteering|volunteer]] coordinator. The station accepts new volunteers every year, with on-air slots becoming available in the second year of service to the station.

==Future Development==
BMIR is currently in the process of developing itself into a year-round radio station. Already doing live talks as well as broadcasting from regional events, the station has a plan to produce interviews, musical sets, and live performances in the other 50 weeks when not at the Burning Man festival.

The '''Bathurst Trade Union''' was the first [[trade union]] organization in [[Banjul|Bathurst]], today Banjul, the capital of [[The Gambia]]. It was founded by [[Edward Francis Small]] in 1929, out of the  Carpenters' and Shipwrights' Society. Small became the chairman of BTU. In October the same year the BTU was joined by other craftsmen associations. BTU received support from the British [[Labour Research Department]] and the British section of the [[League against Imperialism]]. In the fall of 1929, BTU led a 3-week strike. Its membership grew rapidly. By April 1930 it claimed a membership of around 1000.

However, the BTU was torn apart by internal divisions. In 1932 Small was challenged over the BTU leadership by J. L. Njie. The conflict had both political and ethnic aspects (Njie was a [[Wolof people|Wolof]]). Njie had the support of the conservative elites of the city, who were uncomfortable with Small's activism. In March 1933, Njie registered the BTU with himself as its chairman. Small tried to regain power of the BTU for two years, but in May 1935 he broke away and formed the [[Gambia Labour Union]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Arnold ; Perfect, Davi.

In the 1961 groundnut trade season, [[Alieu Ebrima Cham Joof]]—a member of the Select Committee and an old protegế of Edward Francis Small together with his associates at the [[Gambia Workers' Union]] organised  a national strikes against the British colonial authorities and the Chambers of Commerce. The purpose of that strike was to demand proper remuneration for the daily paid workers who were poorly paid. The strike went on for five days. In that strike, Joof jumped on the stage and proclaimed to his followers that he is going to set the country on fire if needs be but "nobody is going to work for them" [the British].&lt;ref&gt;[[Foroyaa]] : [https://web.archive.org/web/20111003130110/http://www.foroyaa.gm/modules/news/article.php?storyid=6832 Exclusive interview with Foroyaa Panorama (TRIBUTE TO ALHAJI A.E.

In the [[Dove Book]] and other medieval Russian books, '''Buyan''' ({{lang-ru|Буя́н}}, sometimes transliterated as '''Bujan'''&lt;ref&gt;[[Anton Dietrich]], ''Russian Popular Tales'', 1857 (Google eBook) [https://books.google.com/books?id=3EozAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA23 p.23]&lt;/ref&gt;) is described as a mysterious [[island]] in the [[ocean]] with the ability to appear and disappear using tides. Three brothers—Northern, Western, and Eastern Winds—live there, and also the [[Zorya]]s, solar goddesses who are servants or daughters of the solar god [[Dazhbog]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Dixon-Kennedy  | first = Mike   | title = Encyclopedia of Russian and Slavic myth and legend  | publisher = ABC-CLIO  | year = 1998  | page =48   | isbn = 978-1-57607-130-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It figures prominently in many famous myths; [[Koschei]] the Deathless keeps his soul or immortality hidden there, secreted inside a needle placed inside an egg in the mystical [[World Tree|oak-tree]]; other legends call the island the source of all weather, created there and sent forth into the world by the god [[Perun]]. It is also mentioned in ''[[The Tale of Tsar Saltan (Rimsky-Korsakov)|The Tale of Tsar Saltan, of His Son the Renowned and Mighty Bogatyr Prince Gvidon Saltanovich, and of the Beautiful Princess-Swan]]'' (an opera by [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]], set partially in [[Tmutarakan]] and Buyan's magical city of Ledenets ({{lang-ru|Леденец}}, "sugary")) and many other Slavic folktales. Furthermore, it also has the mythical stone with healing and magic powers, known as the alatyr' ({{lang-ru|Алатырь}}), which is guarded by the bird [[Gagana]] and Garafena the serpent.

Some scholars interpret Buyan as a sort of [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Proto-Indo-European]] [[Other World|Otherworld]] (see [[Fortunate Islands]]). Others assert that Buyan is actually a [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] name for some real island, most likely [[Rügen]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.google.com/search?tbs=bks%3A1&amp;tbo=1&amp;q=buyan+island+rugen&amp;btnG=Search+Books&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also mentioned in another work by Catherine M.

'''"Der K und K Kalypso aus Wien"''' (The K and K Calypso from Vienna) was the [[Austria in the Eurovision Song Contest|Austrian]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1959]], performed in [[German language|German]] by [[Ferry Graf]].

The song was performed ninth on the night, following [[Switzerland]]'s [[Christa Williams]] with "[[Irgendwoher]]" and preceding the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Pearl Carr &amp; Teddy Johnson]] with "[[Sing Little Birdie]]". At the close of voting, the song had received 4 points, placing it ninth in a field of 11.

The song is somewhat unusual, in that it represents one of the first attempts to fuse an ethnic musical style (in this case, [[Calypso music|Calypso]]) with the ''chanson''-style songs popular in the Contest at the time. Graf attempts to describe a specifically [[Vienna|Viennese]] style of calypso, one which appears to be connected to "the melodies of [[Johann Strauss II|Strauss]]" and have "a bit of red pepper" in it. The sound is likened to "the [[polka]] from [[Brno]]". There is also some [[yodelling]] in the song.

The title, too, is unusual. "K und K" refers to "Kaiserlich und Königlich" ("Imperial and Royal"), the common description of the army of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]].

The song was succeeded as [[Austria in the Eurovision Song Contest|Austrian representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1960]] by [[Harry Winter]] singing "[[Du hast mich so fasziniert]]".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18325">The '''Earth Charter''' is an international declaration of fundamental values and principles considered useful by its supporters for building a just, sustainable, and peaceful global society in the 21st century. Created by a global consultation process, and endorsed by organizations representing millions of people, the Charter "seeks to inspire in all peoples a sense of global interdependence and shared responsibility for the well-being of the human family, the greater community of life, and future generations."&lt;ref&gt;Earth Charter Initiative: [http://www.earthcharterinaction.org/content/pages/What-is-the-Earth-Charter%3F.html "What is the Earth Charter?"].&lt;/ref&gt; It calls upon humanity to help create a global partnership at a critical juncture in history. The Earth Charter's ethical vision proposes that [[environmental protection]], [[human rights]], equitable [[Human development (humanity)|human development]], and [[world peace|peace]] are interdependent and indivisible. The Charter attempts to provide a new framework for thinking about and addressing these issues. The [[Earth Charter Initiative]] organization exists to promote the Charter.

==History==
The idea of the Earth Charter originated in 1987, by [[Maurice Strong]] and [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] as members of The [[Club of Rome]], when the [[United Nations]] [[World Commission on Environment and Development]] called for a new charter to guide the transition to [[sustainable development]]. In 1992, the need for a charter was urged by then-[[Secretary General of the United Nations|Secretary General]] [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]] at the [[Rio de Janeiro]] [[Earth Summit]], but the time for such a declaration was not believed to be right. The [[Rio Declaration]] became the statement of the achievable consensus at that time. In 1994, [[Maurice Strong]] (Chairman of the Earth Summit) and [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], working through organizations they each founded (the [[Earth Council]] and [[Green Cross International]] respectively), restarted the Earth Charter as a [[civil society]] initiative, with the help of the government of the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref name="mstrong"&gt;Maurice Strong: [http://www.mauricestrong.net/2009013070/earth-charter.html "History of the Earth Charter"].&lt;/ref&gt;

Strong died in November 2015.&lt;ref name="mstrong" /&gt;

"The Ark of Hope was created for a celebration of the Earth Charter held at Shelburne Farms, Vermont on September 9, 2001."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arkofhope.org|title=Welcome|author=|date=|website=www.arkofhope.org|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drafting==
The drafting of the text was done during a six-year worldwide consultation process (1994–2000), overseen by the independent Earth Charter Commission, which was convened by Strong and Gorbachev with the purpose of developing a global consensus on values and principles for a sustainable future. The Commission continues to serve as the steward of the Earth Charter text.

One of the members of the Earth Charter Commission and Steering Committee was [[Steven Clark Rockefeller]], who, among other things is professor emeritus of Religion at [[Middlebury College]] and an advisory trustee of the [[Rockefeller Brothers Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Steven C. Rockefeller |url=http://earthcharter.org/about/steven-c-rockefeller/ |website=earthcharter.org |accessdate=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2001 interview with Rockefeller,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abroadview.org/stories/interviews/rockefeller.htm|title=Charting a New Course: An Interview with Steven Rockefeller|last=Schwarz|first=Sherry|date=2001|website=abroadview.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502055548/http://www.abroadview.org/stories/interviews/rockefeller.htm|archivedate=2 May 2008|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; he "chaired the Earth Charter international drafting committee". Other members included [[Amadou Toumani Touré]] (Mali), [[Princess Basma bint Talal]] (Jordan), [[Mohamed Sahnoun]] (Algeria), [[A. T. Ariyaratne]] (Sri Lanka), [[Wakako Hironaka]] (Japan), [[Erna Witoelar]] (Indonesia), [[Ruud Lubbers]] (The Netherlands), [[Federico Mayor]] (Spain), [[Mercedes Sosa]] (Argentina), [[Leonardo Boff]] (Brazil), [[Yolanda Kakabadse]] (Ecuador), [[Shridath Ramphal]] (Guyana), [[Elizabeth May]] (Canada), [[Severn Cullis-Suzuki]] (Canada), and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Commission |url=http://earthcharter.org/about-eci/commission/ |website=earthcharter.org |accessdate=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final text of the Earth Charter was approved at a meeting of the Earth Charter Commission at the [[UNESCO]] headquarters in Paris in March 2000. The official launch was on 29 June 2000 in a ceremony at The [[Peace Palace]] in [[The Hague]], Netherlands. [[Queen Beatrix]] of the Netherlands attended the ceremony.

===Preamble===
{{cquote|We stand at a critical moment in Earth's history, a time when humanity must choose its future. As the world becomes increasingly interdependent and fragile, the future at once holds great peril and great promise. To move forward we must recognize that in the midst of a magnificent diversity of cultures and life forms we are one human family and one Earth community with a common destiny. We must join together to bring forth a sustainable global society founded on respect for nature, universal human rights, economic justice, and a culture of peace. Towards this end, it is imperative that we, the peoples of Earth, declare our responsibility to one another, to the greater community of life, and to future generations.&lt;ref name="ECdoc"&gt;Earth Charter Initiative: [http://www.earthcharterinaction.org/content/pages/Read-the-Charter.html "Text of the Earth Charter"].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Principles ===
The four pillars and sixteen principles of the Earth Charter are:&lt;ref name="ECdoc" /&gt;

'''I. Respect and Care for the Community of Life'''
:1. Respect Earth and life in all its diversity.
:2. Care for the community of life with understanding, compassion and love.
:3. Build democratic societies that are just, participatory, sustainable and peaceful.
:4. Secure Earth's bounty and beauty for present and future generations.

'''II. Ecological Integrity'''
:5. Protect and restore the integrity of Earth's ecological systems, with special concern for biological diversity and the natural processes that sustain life.
:6. Prevent harm as the best method of environmental protection and, when knowledge is limited, apply a precautionary approach.
:7. Adopt patterns of production, consumption and reproduction that safeguard Earth's regenerative capacities, human rights and community well-being.
:8. Advance the study of ecological sustainability and promote the open exchange and wide application of the knowledge acquired.

'''III. Social and Economic Justice'''
:9. Eradicate poverty as an ethical, social and environmental imperative.
:10. Ensure that economic activities and institutions at all levels promote human development in an equitable and sustainable manner.
:11. Affirm gender equality and equity as prerequisites to sustainable development and ensure universal access to education, health care and economic opportunity.
:12. Uphold the right of all, without discrimination, to a natural and social environment supportive of human dignity, bodily health and spiritual well-being, with special attention to the rights of indigenous peoples and minorities.

'''IV. Democracy, Nonviolence, and Peace'''
:13. Strengthen democratic institutions at all levels, and provide transparency and accountability in governance, inclusive participation in decision-making, and access to justice.
:14. Integrate into formal education and lifelong learning the knowledge, values and skills needed for a sustainable way of life.
:15. Treat all living beings with respect and consideration.
:16. Promote a culture of tolerance, nonviolence and peace.

Various religious groups from a wide range of religions support the Earth Charter. The [[Soka Gakkai International]], representing more than 12 million Buddhists worldwide, has supported the Earth Charter since its inception.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sgi.org/resources/ngo-resources/education-for-sustainable-development/sgi-and-the-earth-charter.html "SGI and the Earth Charter"], ''SGI Resources'', May 3, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Unitarian Universalist Association|Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations]] representing over 1000 Unitarian Universalist congregations in the United States supports the measure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uua.org/socialjustice/socialjustice/statements/13992.shtml "Endorse the Earth Charter, 2002 Action of Immediate Witness"], Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations&lt;/ref&gt;  The official body of the [[Baha'i Faith]] religion reacted by saying "While not officially endorsing the Earth Charter, the Baha'i International Community considers the effort toward drafting it and activities in support of its essential objectives to be highly commendable, and it will continue to participate in related activities, such as conferences, forums and the like."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bahai.org/story/139 "Baha'is participate in interreligious dialogue on faith and ecology"], Baha'i World News Service, September 6, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[World Pantheist Movement]], which supports a naturalistic view of religion, endorses the plan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pantheism.net/help/?file=2003083005 "World Pantheist Movement’s Help Centre"], World Pantheist Movement website, retrieved March 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Leadership Conference of Women Religious]], a Catholic organization in the United States approved the measure in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Leadership Conference of Women Religious (August 24, 2004): [http://www.lcwr.org/lcwrannualassembly/2004assembly/resolutions2004.html "2004 Resolutions"] (press release)&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Episcopal Diocese of Newark]] (New Jersey), an Episcopalian Christian organization, endorsed the Earth Charter in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Diocese of Newark |url=http://www.dioceseofnewark.org/convention/resolutions09.pdf |title=135th Annual Convention Resolutions |page=7 |date=January 31, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101021050516/http://www.dioceseofnewark.org/convention/resolutions09.pdf |archivedate=2010-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1992, more than 650 representatives of [[indigenous peoples]] adopted their own 109-point Indigenous Peoples Earth Charter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Brechin |editor-first=Steven R. |date=2003 |title=Contested nature: promoting international biodiversity with social justice in the twenty-first century |location=Albany |publisher=[[State University of New York Press]] |page=[https://books.google.com/books?lr=&amp;id=4i8uAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA29 29] |isbn=0791457753 |oclc=51330533}}&lt;/ref&gt; Representatives of indigenous peoples also participated in the Earth Charter consultations in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Schulthess |first=Beatriz |title=Participation of Indigenous Peoples in the Earth Charter Consultations |url=http://earthcharter.org/virtual-library2/participation-of-indigenous-peoples-in-the-earth-charter-consultations-1996/ |website=earthcharter.org |date=1996 |accessdate=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the Russian Association of the Indigenous Peoples of the North (RAIPON), representing 31 indigenous peoples living in Siberia and far eastern Russia, formally endorsed the Earth Charter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=RAIPON |title=Endorsement of the Russian Association of the Indigenous Peoples of the North (RAIPON) |url=http://earthcharter.org/virtual-library2/the-russian-association-of-the-indigenous-peoples-of-the-north-raipon/ |website=earthcharter.org |date=2015 |accessdate=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mayor Hsu of [[Tainan City|Tainan]], a city of 750,000 in [[Taiwan]], endorsed the charter in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tncg.gov.tw/news.asp?id=%7BC1D4D953-5234-4FA9-B447-E5DAA9192D1C%7D&amp;Lang=E "Mayor Hsu endorsed the Earth Charter with 15 Miss Globalcities"], Tainan City Government news bulltetin, January 19, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The cities of [[Corvallis, Oregon|Corvallis]] (Oregon), Berkeley (California), Pickering (Canada) and 21 towns in Vermont have endorsed the measure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gazettetimes.com/articles/2006/04/18/news/community/tues02.txt "Council passes Earth Charter"], Rebecca Barrett, ''Corvallis Gazette-Times'', April 17, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earthcharterinaction.org/resources/files/berkeley.pdf "Resolution 61,007-NS"], Berkeley City Council, March 27, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityofpickering.com/standard/cityhall/council_meetings/2002/cowm07292002.html "Committee of the Whole Meeting Minutes"], City of Pickering, Canada, July 22, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Nine other towns in Vermont rejected measures endorsing the Earth Charter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.www.middleburycampus.com/media/storage/paper446/news/2002/03/13/LocalNews/Earth.Charter.Supported.In.Middlebury.Meeting-216420.shtml "Earth Charter Supported in Middlebury Meeting"], ''middleburycampus.com'', March 13, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Engineers Without Borders]], an international association whose mission is to help its member groups assist poor communities in their respective countries and around the world, also endorses the Earth Charter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewb-international.org/pdf/1pagerEWBI.pdf one page organization summary], Engineers Without Borders — International, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  The Green Party of [[Botswana]] supports the plan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://greenpartyofbotswana.com greenpartyofbotswanna.com].

Retrieved February 25, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, Bournemouth Borough Council endorsed the Charter in 2008.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The Charter has received opposition from several groups. For example, in the [[United States]], members of religious groups, such as the [[Christian right|Religious Right]] have objected to the document on the grounds that it is [[secularism|secular]], and espouses [[socialism]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009| reason=Please, provide a reliable source for this assertion. Nowhere on the Internet, I could find the mentioned objections.}} In addition, some conservatives{{Who|date=November 2009}} cite an informal comment by Mikhail Gorbachev that the document is "a kind of [[Ten Commandments]]" and point to the fact that at the 2002 [[World Summit on Sustainable Development]] in [[Johannesburg]], [[South Africa]], a copy of the document was placed symbolically in an "Ark of Hope" — an independent project by the American artist Sally Linder.

Earth Charter International, the organization responsible for promoting the Charter, states in its literature that the Earth Charter is respectful and inclusive of all religious traditions. They say that the Charter itself makes no statements to support claims of intent to supplant any of the world's religions or to create a world government. ECI asserts that the Charter is a statement of common ethical values towards sustainability, that recognizes humanity's shared responsibility to the Earth and to each other.&lt;ref&gt;Earth Charter Initiative.

A '''Fischbrötchen''' ({{Audio|GT Fischbrötchen.ogg|listen}}) (lit. ''fish bun'') is a [[sandwich]] made with [[fish]] and other components such as fresh white or dried [[onion]]s, [[Pickled cucumber|pickles]], [[remoulade]], creamy [[Horseradish#Horseradish sauce|horseradish sauce]], [[ketchup]], or [[cocktail sauce]]. It is commonly eaten in [[Northern Germany]], due to the region's proximity to the [[North Sea]] and [[Baltic Sea]].

A common preparation is made with [[pickled herring|bismarck herring]] or [[soused herring]]. Other varieties use [[Brathering]], [[rollmops]], [[European sprat]], [[salmon]], smoked [[Atlantic mackerel]], other fried fish varieties (e.g., [[Tuna fish sandwich|fish burgers]]). [[Crangon crangon|Prawns]] are sometimes used, as are various other species of food fish.  Fischbrötchen are commonly served at [[fast food]] stands or [[take-out]] restaurants.

The [[Hanover Fair]] was initially colloquially known as the ''Fischbrötchen fair'' due to the fish buns served there as a snack.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.welt.de/print-welt/article644387/Am_Anfang_war_das_Fischbroetchen.html ''Am Anfang war das Fischbrötchen'']: ''[[Die Welt]]'', 4 April 2005 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Little is known about him, but from around 1807 he looked to increase the size of his chiefdom in the area that is now Butawa Territory.

In [[development cooperation]] jargon, "'''hardware'''" and "software" refer to the different aspects of [[technology transfer]]. Whilst the hardware refers to the technology itself, software refers to the skills, knowledge and capacity that need to be built up in order to make the transfer of the technology successful.

A third term, "orgware", is emerging to refer to the capacity building of the different institutional actors involved in the adaptation process of a new technology.

"'''Kad zaspu anđeli'''" ("When angels fall asleep"), also known as '''"Ostani"''' ("Stay"), was the [[Croatia]]n entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2000]], performed in [[Croatian language|Croatian]] by [[Goran Karan]].  Karan wanted to perform the song in English on the Eurovision night but he was not allowed due to the public voting.  A similar vote was in place the year before where the public voted that Doris sang her song "Marija Magdalena" in [[Croatian language|Croatian]] as opposed to [[English language|English]] .

The song was performed seventeenth on the night, following [[Switzerland]]'s [[Jane Bogaert]] with "[[La vita cos'è?]]" and preceding [[Sweden]]'s [[Roger Pontare]] with "[[När vindarna viskar mitt namn|When Spirits Are Calling My Name]]". At the close of voting, it had received 70 points, placing 9th in a field of 24.

The song is a love ballad, with Karan pleading with his lover to stay with him, even "when angels fall asleep".

Goran appeared dressed in a black suit.  He was accompanied by a male guitarist, two female backing singers in grey dresses, and a woman entirely hidden by a black veil.  During the first verse and chorus, she simply stood near the back of the stage, but during the second chorus, she performed a dance, still hidden by the veil.  At the end of the song, she removed her veil, to reveal a in a floor-length, pale blue gown.

It was succeeded as [[Croatia in the Eurovision Song Contest|Croatian representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2001|2001 contest]] by [[Vanna (singer)|Vanna]] with "[[Strings of My Heart]]".

The song was conducted by [[Ossi Runne]], who retired after this Contest (conducting 22 Finnish entries).

The song was performed 14th on the night, following [[Austria]]'s [[Thomas Forstner]] with "[[Nur ein Lied]]" and preceding [[France]]'s [[Nathalie Pâque]] with "[[J'ai volé la vie]]".

Next, he moved to London's [[Capital London|Capital Radio]], first presenting a Sunday night specialist show for the station, before moving to prominence on the latenight show (10{{nbsp}}pm{{snd}}1{{nbsp}}am) in 1986{{ndash}}1989.

At the beginning of 2004, Collins went 'freelance', heard on various stations across the UK such as [[Virgin Radio]], [[Magic 105.4]] and [[Capital Gold]]. In July 2004, Martin joined [[Virgin Radio]] on a permanent basis, with stints on drivetime and the late show, leaving the station in December 2006. He replaced [[Russell Pockett]] on drivetime when [[102.2 Smooth Radio]] relaunched in early 2007, and remained in the slot until December 2008.

In late 2009, he took on the weekend breakfast show (6{{snd}}10{{nbsp}}am) on Magic 105.4, then he presented various shows like Early Breakfast, Weekday Mellow Magic and just before he left the station he presented Magic Weekend Afternoons (Saturday and Sunday 3{{snd}}6{{nbsp}}pm) until late September 2016. Since October Tom Price took over presenting Magic Weekend Afternoons (Saturday 3{{snd}}6{{nbsp}}pm and Sunday 1{{snd}}4{{nbsp}}pm) until August 2017. From September 2017, Tom Price started hosting Weekend Breakfast on Magic. Matt Brown can now be heard every weekend afternoons on Magic Radio.

'''Muzeul Memoriei Neamului''' ([[Romanian language|Romanian]]; ''Museum of National Memory'') is a museum in [[Chişinău]], [[Moldova]], dedicated to the victims of the [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina]], and commemorating anti-[[communist]] resistance in the region.

== Overview ==

Founded by the former political prisoner and dissident [[Vadim Pirogan]], the museum is located on ''str. Costache Negruzzi no 4'' and is supported by the [[Association of the Victims of the Communist Regime and of the War Veterans of the Romanian Army]], a Moldovan [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]. 

In the 1990s, [[Mihai Ursache]], a former member of the resistance in occupied [[Bessarabia]] in 1940 "[[Arcaşii lui Ştefan]]",{{Clarify|date=January 2010}} founded a small museum in two rooms at 52 Kogalniceanu. The association was disbanded and exhibits delivered in the National History museum basement. After 3–4 years, Vadim Pirogan, a former political prisoner condemned by the Soviets in 1941 to five years of forced labor at camps in the Irkutsk region, decided to rebuild the museum together with Nicholas Caireac that keeps rent a room 70 sqm.{{Clarify|date=January 2010}}

On June 30, 2010 the [[First Filat Cabinet|First Vlad Filat Cabinet]], decided to create a separate ''Museum of Victims of Communism'';&lt;ref&gt;[http://gov.gov.md/md/comunicate/?nid=9673819&amp;y=2010&amp;m=06 Prim-ministrul Vlad FILAT a prezidat astăzi şedinţa ordinară a Guvernului]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, {{asof|2015|lc=y}}, such a museum has not been inaugurated.

'''Florence Lowe "Pancho" Barnes''' (July 22, 1901 – March 30, 1975) was a pioneer [[aviator]], the founder of the first movie stunt pilots' union.

==Early years==
She was born as '''Florence Leontine Lowe''' on July 22, 1901, to Thaddeus Lowe II (1870–1955) and his first wife, Florence May Dobbins, in [[Pasadena, California]]. She was born to a wealthy family, growing up in a huge mansion in [[San Marino, California]]. During her formative years, she attended the area's finest private schools. Her father, an avid sportsman, encouraged her to appreciate the great outdoors and Florence became an accomplished equestrian.&lt;ref name=cent/&gt; Her grandfather was [[Thaddeus S. C. Lowe]], who had pioneered American aviation with the establishment of the nation's first military air unit, [[Union Army Balloon Corps|the Army of the Potomac's balloon corps]] during the [[American Civil War]]. He took his granddaughter to an air show when she was 10 years old.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson 2013, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919, Florence married Reverend C. Rankin Barnes of [[South Pasadena, California]], and they had a son, William E. Barnes.&lt;ref name=cent&gt;[http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Explorers_Record_Setters_and_Daredevils/Barnes/EX17.htm "Florence Lowe "Pancho" Barnes."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050905002804/http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Explorers_Record_Setters_and_Daredevils/Barnes/EX17.htm |date=2005-09-05 }} ''Centennial of Flight Commission'', 2003.

==Aviation career==
Having spent four months abroad in Mexico, getting caught up with revolutionaries and escaping the attention of authorities, disguised as a man, she began to use the nickname "Pancho" about this time.&lt;ref name= "p.138"&gt;Gibson 2013, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;  Barnes returned to [[San Marino, California]], with an inheritance bequeathed her on her parents' death. In 1928, while driving her cousin Dean Banks to flying lessons, she decided to learn to fly, and convinced her cousin's flight instructor, Ben Caitlin, a [[World War I]] veteran, of her desire that same day.&lt;ref name= "p.138"/&gt; She soloed after six hours of formal instruction.&lt;ref name=cent/&gt;

Barnes ran an ad-hoc [[barnstorming]] show and competed in air races. Despite a crash in the 1929 [[Women's Air Derby]], she returned in 1930 under the sponsorship of the [[Union Oil Company]] to win the race &amp;ndash; and break Amelia Earhart's world women's speed record with a speed of 196.19&amp;nbsp;mph (315.7&amp;nbsp;km/h). Barnes broke this record in a [[Travel Air Type R Mystery Ship]].&lt;ref name=cent/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pelletier 2012, pp. 177, 178, 183–185.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Pancho and Travel Air Mystery Ship.jpg|thumb|Pancho Barnes with [[Travel Air Type R Mystery Ship]] R613K, c. 1930s]]

After her contract with Union Oil expired, Barnes moved to [[Hollywood]] to work as a stunt pilot for movies. In 1931, she started the [[Associated Motion Picture Pilots]], a union of film industry stunt fliers which promoted flying safety and standardized pay for aerial stunt work. She flew in several air-adventure movies of the 1930s, including Howard Hughes' ''[[Hell's Angels (film)|Hell's Angels]]'' (1930).&lt;ref&gt;Gibson 2013, pp. 136–137.&lt;/ref&gt;

Barnes had extensive connections in Hollywood. Her early close friend [[George Hurrell]] (1904–1992), then eking out a living as a painter and photographer in Laguna Beach, California, would later become the legendary head of the portrait department of [[MGM Studios]]. Barnes is credited with helping Hurrell start his career in Hollywood after he took the photo she was to use on her pilot's license, introducing him to her Hollywood friends.{{#tag:ref|Barnes encouraged Hurrell’s photography and often posed for him.

Barnes lost most of her money in the [[Great Depression]]. By 1935, she had only her apartment in Hollywood left. She sold it, and in March 1935 bought {{convert|180|acre|ha|lk=on}} of land in the Mojave Desert, near the Rogers dry lake bed and the nascent [[Muroc Field]], then called March Field because it was an adjunct property of [[March Air Reserve Base|March Army Air Base]] at that time.&lt;ref name=cent/&gt;

==The Happy Bottom Riding Club==
{{Main|Happy Bottom Riding Club}}
On her land, Pancho Barnes built the [[Happy Bottom Riding Club]], also known as the Rancho Oro Verde Fly-Inn Dude Ranch, a [[dude ranch]] and restaurant which catered to airmen at the nearby airfield and her friends from Hollywood. Barnes became very close friends with many of the early test pilots, including [[Chuck Yeager]], [[Bob Hoover|Robert Anderson "Bob" Hoover]], Walt Williams, Jack Ridley, General [[Jimmy Doolittle]],  [[Buzz Aldrin]], [[North American Aviation]] flight test mechanic Bob Cadick, and flight test supervisor Roy Ferren.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chuckyeager.org/news/mach-match-history-air-space-magazine/|title=Mach Match {{!}} Air &amp; Space Magazine {{!}} CHUCKYEAGER.ORG|website=www.chuckyeager.org|language=en|access-date=2018-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barnes' ranch became famous for the parties and high-flying lifestyle of all the guests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://happybottomridingclub.com/docs/happy_bottom_riding_club.pdf "Happy Bottom Riding Club."] ''Happybottomridingclub.com'', November 24, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

After successful flight trials, the Muroc and Edwards [[test pilot]]s often enjoyed some good times at the Happy Bottom Riding Club. As proprietor, Barnes would offer them a customary free [[steak]]&lt;ref name="Edwards.af.mil"&gt;[https://archive.is/20130803004012/http://www.edwards.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123144418 "Lassie Visits Pancho."] ''Edwards.af.mil.''

Retrieved: 2 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

A change of command in 1952, however, contributed to Barnes getting into a conflict with the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF).  The USAF was planning for the future of aviation, and decided it needed to build a new, super-long runway to accommodate new aircraft that were being planned to run on atomic power.  That new runway would run directly across her ranch. The USAF originally offered her a price for her ranch, land, and facilities that was very close to the cost of undeveloped desert land. She requested a fair appraisal to better reflect the actual cost of replacement of her land and business, but in the midst of getting a re-appraisal, the base leadership accused her of running a house of ill-repute on her ranch. The effect of even the hint of impropriety resulted in her ranch and business being put off-limits to military personnel, and the value of her business plummeted.&lt;ref name="background"/&gt;

Barnes then filed a lawsuit against the USAF to, as she put it, "Roust out the scoundrels in the government who would perpetrate such an injustice."  She knew that if she filed a lawsuit, she would have the opportunity to depose under oath the various leaders and personnel on base, and the truth would come out and clear her name. During the height of the intense court battle, in 1953, her ranch burned in a fire of mysterious origin.  After the fire, the value of her ranch and business further plummeted to a level more closely reflecting the original buy-out offer from the USAF.  Nonetheless, the court battle continued. Barnes was determined to receive fair value for her land and business, and to clear her name. A main contention of her defense was: "My grandfather founded the United States Air Force." On that argument, the court found in her favor and she was awarded $375,000 remuneration for her property and business. Also, her name was cleared. As it turned out, the proposed runway was never built.&lt;ref name="background"/&gt;
[[File:Happy Bottom Riding Club.JPG|thumb|The remains of the Happy Bottom Riding Club, c. 1990s showing the extent of the fire that consumed the main buildings.]]
After the government bought her out, she moved to [[Cantil, California]], in hopes of restarting a similar dude ranch business there. It never happened. It was not until the late 1960s that Barnes once again became a commonplace figure at the base and began to be referred to as the "Mother of Edwards AFB." The wounds began to heal as Barnes reconnected with many old-timers. The officer's mess at Edwards was renamed the Pancho Barnes Room.&lt;ref name="background"/&gt;

==Death==
Barnes suffered from breast cancer, likely the ultimate cause of her death. She was scheduled to be the keynote speaker at the Antelope Valley Aero Museum's annual "Barnstormers Reunion" on April 5, 1975. However, when a friend called on March 30, 1975; she could not reach her. Her son Bill found her dead in her home and the coroner determined that she had died several days earlier.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |author= |title=Florence Barnes, 20's Aviator, Dies |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1975/03/31/archives/florence-barnes-20s-aviator-dies-set-records-did-film-stunts-and.html |quote= |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=March 31, 1975 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=death/&gt;&lt;ref name=cent/&gt;  Bill obtained special permission which was granted from the United States Air Force to spread her ashes over the site of the Happy Bottom Riding Club. He then flew an aircraft over the site, but a crosswind came up sweeping the ashes back into the small Cessna aircraft, to be carried aloft again. "Even in death Barnes still loved a good joy ride."&lt;ref name="background"/&gt;

==Legacy==
Her fourth husband, Eugene "Mac" McKendry, continued to live in Cantil and survived Barnes for many years.

Son Bill Barnes died piloting a [[North American P-51 Mustang]] flying near Fox Field in Lancaster in October 1980.  In 1940, she had founded Barnes Aviation of [[Lancaster, California|Lancaster]] which Bill operated in his adult years. It remains in the general aviation business today.&lt;ref name="Spark"&gt;Spark, Nick.

Her life and personality were portrayed in the 1983 epic film ''[[The Right Stuff (film)|The Right Stuff]]'' adapted from [[Tom Wolfe]]'s bestselling book of the same name. [[Kim Stanley]] played her.  She was also the subject of a heavily fictionalized 1988 TV film, ''[[Pancho Barnes (1988 film)|Pancho Barnes]]'', written by [[John Michael Hayes]], directed by [[Richard Heffron]], and starring [[Valerie Bertinelli]]. The first biography about Barnes was published in 1986, ''The Lady Who Tamed Pegasus: The Story of Pancho Barnes'', written by Grover Ted Tate, who relied heavily upon the copyrighted autobiographical materials of Pancho Barnes.  In 1996, a second biography appeared, ''Pancho: The Biography of Florence Lowe Barnes'', written by Barbara Schultz.  A third biography appeared in 2000, written by Lauren Kessler, ''The Happy Bottom Riding Club: The Life and Times of Pancho Barnes''.

[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] sponsored a documentary film, ''[[The Legend of Pancho Barnes and the Happy Bottom Riding Club]]'',  completed in 2009. In it, [[Kathy Bates]] provides the voice of  Barnes. The documentary was made independently of the estate of Barnes. However, the estate gave the film makers full access to her personal papers and photographs as well as her copyrighted autobiography that are owned by the estate. The film, which chronicles Barnes' life story, was produced and written by [[Nick T. Spark]] and directed by Amanda Pope in affiliation with [[KOCE-TV]], a PBS station in Orange County, California.  The documentary won an Emmy for best arts and history documentary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legendofpanchobarnes.com/ "The Legend of Pancho Barnes and the Happy Bottom Riding Club."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523111947/http://www.legendofpanchobarnes.com/ |date=2013-05-23 }} ''[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]''.

The Happy Bottom Riding Club historical site is the location for the annual USAF Test Pilot School/Edwards Air Force Base Pancho Barnes Day celebration (established in 1980).  A barbecue is held and drinks are served, along with dancing and live music in remembrance of this aviation pioneer and friend.  Family hour extends until approximately 9 pm, after which it is an adults only party, perhaps in remembrance of the raucous old days of Happy Bottom Riding Club.&lt;ref name="Edwards.af.mil/news"&gt;[http://www.edwards.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123288094 "Test Pilots Celebrate Pancho."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140422232007/http://www.edwards.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123288094 |date=2014-04-22 }} ''Edwards.af.mil.''

==Etymology==&lt;!-- linked --&gt;
{{Main|Rus' people|Rus' (name)}}
{{See also|Russian (disambiguation)}}
The name ''Russia'' is derived from [[Rus' (name)|Rus']], a medieval state populated mostly by the [[East Slavs]]. However, this proper name became more prominent in the later history, and the country typically was called by its inhabitants "Русская Земля" (russkaja zemlja), which can be translated as "Russian Land" or "Land of Rus'". In order to distinguish this state from other states derived from it, it is denoted as ''[[Kievan Rus']]'' by modern historiography. The [[Rus (name)|name ''Rus'']] itself comes from the early medieval [[Rus' people]], [[Swedes (Germanic tribe)|Swedish]] merchants and warriors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Russia |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |accessdate=November 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/rus |title=Rus – definition of Rus by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |accessdate=November 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; who relocated from across the Baltic Sea and founded a state centered on [[Novgorod]] that later became [[Kievan Rus]].

An old Latin version of the name Rus' was [[Ruthenia]], mostly applied to the western and southern regions of Rus' that were adjacent to Catholic Europe. The current name of the country, Россия (Rossija), comes from the [[Byzantine Greek]] designation of the [[Rus' (name)|Rus']], Ρωσσία ''Rossía''—spelled Ρωσία (''Rosía'' {{IPA-el|roˈsia|pron}}) in [[Modern Greek]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Russians: The People of Europe |last=Milner-Gulland |first=R.

The standard way to refer to citizens of Russia is "[[citizens of Russia|Russians]]" in English&lt;ref name=merriamwebster&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Russian|title=Definition of Russian|publisher=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=September 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''rossiyane'' ({{lang-rus|россияне}}) in Russian. There are two [[Russian language|Russian]] words which are commonly translated into English as "Russians". One is "русские" (''russkiye''), which most often means "ethnic [[Russians]]". Another is "россияне" (''rossiyane''), which means "[[citizens of Russia]], regardless of ethnicity". Translations into other languages often do not distinguish these two groups.

In [[classical antiquity]], the Pontic Steppe was known as [[Scythia]]. Beginning in the 8th century BC, [[Ancient Greek]] traders brought their civilization to the trade emporiums in [[Tanais]] and [[Phanagoria]].

{{Main|Rus' Khaganate|Kievan Rus'|List of early East Slavic states}}
[[File:Kievan Rus en.jpg|thumb|Kievan Rus' in the 11th century]]
The establishment of the first East Slavic states in the 9th century coincided with the arrival of [[Varangians]], the traders, warriors and settlers from the Baltic Sea region. Primarily they were [[Vikings]] of [[Scandinavia]]n origin, who ventured along the waterways extending from the eastern Baltic [[From the Varangians to the Greeks|to the Black]] [[Volga trade route|and Caspian]] Seas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Obolensky, D.|title=Byzantium and the Slavs|publisher=St Vladimir's Seminary Press|year=1994|page=42|isbn=978-0-88141-008-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'', a Varangian from [[Rus' people]], named [[Rurik]], was elected ruler of [[Novgorod]] in 862. In 882, his successor [[Oleg of Novgorod|Oleg]] ventured south and conquered [[Kiev]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Thompson, J.W. |author2=Johnson, E.N. |title=An Introduction to Medieval Europe, 300–1500|publisher=W.

Oleg, Rurik's son [[Igor of Kiev|Igor]] and Igor's son [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev|Sviatoslav]] subsequently subdued all local [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] tribes to Kievan rule, destroyed the [[Khazar khaganate]] and launched several military expeditions to [[Paphlagonian expedition of the Rus'|Byzantium]] and [[Caspian expeditions of the Rus'|Persia]].

In the 10th to 11th centuries Kievan Rus' became one of the largest and most prosperous states in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ukraine: Security Assistance|publisher=U.S. Department of State|url=https://www.state.gov/t/pm/64851.htm|accessdate=December 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reigns of [[Vladimir the Great]] (980–1015) and his son [[Yaroslav the Wise]] (1019–1054) constitute the [[Golden Age]] of Kiev, which saw [[Christianization of Kievan Rus'|the acceptance of]] [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]] from [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]] and the creation of the first East Slavic written [[legal code]], the ''[[Russkaya Pravda]]''.

In the 11th and 12th centuries, constant incursions by nomadic Turkic tribes, such as the [[Kipchaks]] and the [[Pechenegs]], caused a massive migration of Slavic populations to the safer, heavily forested regions of the north, particularly to the area known as [[Zalesye]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Klyuchevsky, V.|title=The course of the Russian history|volume=1|url=http://www.kulichki.com/inkwell/text/special/history/kluch/kluch16.htm|isbn=978-5-244-00072-6|year=1987|publisher=Myslʹ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Galicia-Volhynia was eventually assimilated by the [[Kingdom of Poland (1025–1385)|Kingdom of Poland]], while the Mongol-dominated Vladimir-Suzdal and Novgorod Republic, two regions on the periphery of Kiev, established the basis for the modern Russian nation.&lt;ref name=Curtis /&gt; The Novgorod together with [[Pskov]] retained some degree of autonomy during the time of the [[Mongol yoke]] and were largely spared the atrocities that affected the rest of the country.

The most powerful state to eventually arise after the destruction of Kievan Rus' was the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] ("Muscovy" in the Western chronicles), initially a part of [[Vladimir-Suzdal]]. While still under the domain of the [[Mongol]]-[[Tatars]] and with their connivance, Moscow began to assert its influence in the Central Rus' in the early 14th century, gradually becoming the leading force in the process of the Rus' lands' reunification and expansion of Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Davies B.

Led by Prince [[Dmitry Donskoy]] of Moscow and helped by the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], the united army of Russian principalities inflicted a milestone defeat on the Mongol-Tatars in the [[Battle of Kulikovo]] in 1380. Moscow gradually absorbed the surrounding principalities, including formerly strong rivals such as [[Principality of Tver|Tver]] and [[Novgorod Republic|Novgorod]].

[[Ivan&amp;nbsp;III]] ("the Great") finally threw off the control of the [[Golden Horde]] and consolidated the whole of Central and Northern Rus' under Moscow's dominion. He was also the first to take the title "Grand Duke of all the Russias".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Ivan grozny frame.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Tsar [[Ivan the Terrible]], illustration in Tsarsky Titulyarnik, 17th century]]

During his long reign, Ivan the Terrible nearly doubled the already large Russian territory by annexing the three Tatar khanates (parts of the disintegrated [[Golden Horde]]): [[Khanate of Kazan|Kazan]] and [[Astrakhan Khanate|Astrakhan]] along the [[Volga River]], and the [[Siberian Khanate]] in southwestern Siberia. Thus, by the end of the 16th century Russia was transformed into a [[multiethnic]], [[Religious denomination|multidenominational]] and [[transcontinental state]].

However, the Tsardom was weakened by the long and unsuccessful [[Livonian War]] against the coalition of Poland, Lithuania, and Sweden for access to the Baltic coast and sea trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Solovyov, S.|title=History of Russia from the Earliest Times|publisher=AST|year=2001|volume=6|pages=751–908|isbn=978-5-17-002142-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the Tatars of the [[Crimean Khanate]], the only remaining successor to the Golden Horde, continued to raid Southern Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Eizo Matsuki|url=http://www.econ.hit-u.ac.jp/~areastd/mediterranean/mw/pdf/18/10.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501041101/http://www.econ.hit-u.ac.jp/~areastd/mediterranean/mw/pdf/18/10.pdf|archivedate=May 1, 2011|title=The Crimean Tatars and their Russian-Captive Slaves|publisher=Mediterranean Studies Group at Hitotsubashi University|format=PDF|date= |accessdate=May 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an effort to restore the Volga khanates, Crimeans and their [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] allies [[Russo-Crimean Wars|invaded central Russia]] and were even able to [[Fire of Moscow (1571)|burn down parts of Moscow]] in 1571.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Solovyov, S.|title=History of Russia from the Earliest Times|publisher=AST|year=2001|volume=6|pages=751–809|isbn=978-5-17-002142-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; But in the next year the large invading army was thoroughly defeated by Russians in the [[Battle of Molodi]], forever eliminating the threat of an Ottoman–Crimean expansion into Russia.

[[File:Kivchenko Election of Mikhail Romanov.jpg|thumb|left|Election of 16-year-old [[Michael I of Russia|Mikhail Romanov]], the first Tsar of the [[Romanov dynasty]]]]

In 1612, the Poles were forced to retreat by the Russian volunteer corps, led by two national heroes, merchant [[Kuzma Minin]] and Prince [[Dmitry Pozharsky]]. The [[Romanov Dynasty]] acceded to the throne in 1613 by the decision of Zemsky Sobor, and the country started its gradual recovery from the crisis.

Russia continued its territorial growth through the 17th century, which was the age of [[Cossacks]]. Cossacks were warriors organized into military communities, resembling [[pirates]] and [[pioneers of the New World]]. In 1648, the peasants of Ukraine joined the [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]] in rebellion against Poland-Lithuania during the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]] in reaction to the social and religious oppression they had been suffering under Polish rule. In 1654, the Ukrainian leader, [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]], offered to place Ukraine under the protection of the Russian Tsar, [[Aleksey&amp;nbsp;I]]. Aleksey's acceptance of this offer led to another [[Russo-Polish War (1654–1667)|Russo-Polish War]]. Finally, Ukraine was split along the [[Dnieper River]], leaving the western part, [[right-bank Ukraine]], under Polish rule and the eastern part ([[Left-bank Ukraine]] and [[Kiev]]) under Russian rule. Later, in 1670–71, the [[Don Cossacks]] led by [[Stenka Razin]] initiated a major uprising in the [[Volga Region]], but the Tsar's troops were successful in defeating the rebels.

In the east, the rapid Russian exploration and colonisation of the huge territories of Siberia was led mostly by Cossacks hunting for valuable furs and ivory. [[Russian explorers]] pushed eastward primarily along the [[Siberian River Routes]], and by the mid-17th century there were Russian settlements in Eastern Siberia, on the [[Chukchi Peninsula]], along the [[Amur River]], and on the Pacific coast. In 1648, the [[Bering Strait]] between Asia and North America was passed for the first time by [[Fedot Popov]] and [[Semyon Dezhnyov]].

Under [[Peter the Great]], Russia was proclaimed an Empire in 1721 and became recognized as a world power.

[[Peter the Great's reforms]] brought considerable Western European cultural influences to Russia.

The reign of Peter&amp;nbsp;I's daughter [[Elizabeth of Russia|Elizabeth]] in 1741–62 saw Russia's participation in the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756–63). During this conflict Russia annexed [[East Prussia]] for a while and even took Berlin. However, upon Elisabeth's death, all these conquests were returned to the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] by pro-Prussian [[Peter&amp;nbsp;III of Russia]].

[[Catherine the Great|Catherine&amp;nbsp;II]] ("the Great"), who ruled in 1762–96, presided over the Age of [[Russian Enlightenment]]. She extended Russian political control over the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and incorporated most of its territories into Russia during the [[Partitions of Poland]], pushing the Russian frontier westward into Central Europe. In the south, after successful [[Russo-Turkish Wars]] against [[Ottoman Turkey]], Catherine advanced Russia's boundary to the Black Sea, defeating the [[Crimean Khanate]]. As a result of victories over [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar Iran]] through the [[Russo-Persian Wars]], by the first half of the 19th century Russia also made significant territorial gains in [[Transcaucasia]] and the [[North Caucasus]], forcing the former to irrevocably cede what is nowadays [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Dagestan]], [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Armenia]] to Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy C. Dowling [https://books.google.com/books?id=KTq2BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA728 ''Russia at War: From the Mongol Conquest to Afghanistan, Chechnya, and Beyond''] pp 728–730 ABC-CLIO, December 2, 2014 {{ISBN|1598849484}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John F.

At the same time, Russians [[Russian America|colonized Alaska]] and even founded settlements in California, such as [[Fort Ross]].
[[File:Russia 1533-1896.gif|thumb|left|Russian expansion in Eurasia between 1533–1894]]

In 1803–1806, the [[first Russian circumnavigation]] was made, later followed by other notable Russian sea exploration voyages. In 1820, [[Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen#First Russian Antarctic expedition|a Russian expedition]] discovered the continent of [[Antarctica]].

In alliances with various European countries, Russia fought against [[Napoleon]]'s France. The [[French invasion of Russia]] at the height of Napoleon's power in 1812 reached Moscow, but eventually failed miserably as the obstinate resistance in combination with the bitterly cold [[Russian winter]] led to a disastrous defeat of invaders, in which more than 95% of the pan-European [[Grande Armée]] perished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ruling the Empire|publisher=Library of Congress|url=http://countrystudies.us/russia/5.htm|accessdate=December 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Led by [[Mikhail Kutuzov]] and [[Barclay de Tolly]], the Russian army ousted Napoleon from the country and drove through Europe in the [[war of the Sixth Coalition]], finally entering Paris. Alexander&amp;nbsp;I headed Russia's delegation at the [[Congress of Vienna]] that defined the map of post-Napoleonic Europe.

The officers of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] brought ideas of liberalism back to Russia with them and attempted to curtail the tsar's powers during the abortive [[Decembrist revolt]] of 1825. At the end of the conservative reign of [[Nicolas&amp;nbsp;I]] (1825–55), a zenith period of Russia's power and influence in Europe was disrupted by defeat in the [[Crimean War]]. Between 1847 and 1851, about one million people died of Asiatic [[cholera]].&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey A. Hosking (2001).

[[File:Koetoezov kazan.jpg|thumb|180px|Monument to [[Mikhail Kutuzov]] in front of the [[Kazan Cathedral, St. Petersburg|Kazan Cathedral]] in Saint Petersburg. The Kazan Cathedral and the [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]] in Moscow were built to commemorate the victory against Napoleon]]

Nicholas's successor [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander&amp;nbsp;II]] (1855–81) enacted significant changes in the country, including the [[emancipation reform of 1861]]. These ''Great Reforms'' spurred industrialization and modernized the Russian army, which had successfully liberated Bulgaria from Ottoman rule in the [[1877–78 Russo-Turkish War]].

The late 19th century saw the rise of various socialist movements in Russia. Alexander&amp;nbsp;II was killed in 1881 by revolutionary terrorists, and the reign of his son
[[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander&amp;nbsp;III]] (1881–94) was less liberal but more peaceful. The last Russian Emperor, [[Nicholas&amp;nbsp;II]] (1894–1917), was unable to prevent the events of the Russian [[Revolution of 1905]], triggered by the unsuccessful [[Russo-Japanese War]] and the demonstration incident known as [[Bloody Sunday (1905)|Bloody Sunday]]. The uprising was put down, but the government was forced to concede major reforms ([[Russian Constitution of 1906]]), including granting the [[freedom of speech|freedoms of speech]] and [[freedom of assembly|assembly]], the legalization of political parties, and the creation of an elected legislative body, the [[State Duma of the Russian Empire]]. The [[Stolypin reform|Stolypin agrarian reform]] led to a massive peasant migration and settlement into [[Siberia]].

In 1914, Russia entered [[World War&amp;nbsp;I]] in response to Austria-Hungary's declaration of war on Russia's ally Serbia, and fought across multiple fronts while isolated from its [[Triple Entente]] allies. In 1916, the [[Brusilov Offensive]] of the Russian Army almost completely destroyed the military of [[Austria-Hungary]]. However, the already-existing public distrust of the regime was deepened by the rising costs of war, [[World War I casualties|high casualties]], and rumors of corruption and treason. All this formed the climate for the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917, carried out in two major acts.

The [[February Revolution]] forced [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] to abdicate; he and his family were imprisoned and [[Shooting of the Romanov family|later executed in Yekaterinburg]] during the [[Russian Civil War]]. The monarchy was replaced by a shaky coalition of political parties that declared itself the [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]]. On September 1 (14), 1917, upon a decree of the Provisional Government, the Russian Republic was proclaimed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.prlib.ru/history/619540|title=Провозглашена Российская республика|date=February 7, 2017|website=Президентская библиотека имени Б.Н.

The next day the Constituent Assembly was dissolved by the [[All-Russian Central Executive Committee]].

An alternative socialist establishment co-existed, the [[Petrograd Soviet]], wielding power through the democratically elected councils of workers and peasants, called ''[[Soviet (council)|Soviets]]''. The rule of the new authorities only aggravated the crisis in the country, instead of resolving it. Eventually, the [[October Revolution]], led by [[Bolshevik]] leader [[Vladimir Lenin]], overthrew the Provisional Government and gave full governing power to the Soviets, leading to the creation of the world's first [[socialist state]].

Following the October Revolution, a [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] broke out between the [[anti-Communist]] [[White movement]] and the new [[Workers' council|Soviet]] regime with its [[Red Army]]. Bolshevist Russia lost its Ukrainian, Polish, Baltic, and Finnish territories by signing the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (Russia–Central Powers)|Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] that concluded hostilities with the [[Central Powers]] of World War&amp;nbsp;I. The [[Allies of World War I|Allied powers]] launched an unsuccessful [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|military intervention]] in support of anti-Communist forces. In the meantime both the Bolsheviks and White movement carried out campaigns of deportations and executions against each other, known respectively as the [[Red Terror]] and [[White Terror (Russia)|White Terror]]. By the end of the civil war, Russia's economy and infrastructure were heavily damaged. Millions became [[White émigré]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=uUsLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA3 Transactions of the American Philosophical Society]. James E.

Out of the 15 [[republics of the USSR|republics that would make up the USSR]], the largest in size and over half of the total USSR population was the Russian SFSR, which came to dominate the union for its entire 69-year history.

Following [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin's]] death in 1924, a [[List of leaders of the Soviet Union#List of troikas|troika]] was designated to govern the Soviet Union. However, [[Joseph Stalin]], an elected [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary of the Communist Party]], managed to suppress all opposition groups within the party and consolidate power in his hands. [[Leon Trotsky]], the main proponent of [[world revolution]], was exiled from the Soviet Union in 1929, and Stalin's idea of [[Socialism in One Country]] became the primary line. The continued internal struggle in the Bolshevik party culminated in the [[Great Purge]], a period of mass repressions in 1937–38, during which hundreds of thousands of people were executed, including [[Old Bolshevik|original party members]] and military leaders accused of [[coup d'état]] plots.&lt;ref&gt;Abbott Gleason (2009).

Under Stalin's leadership, the government launched a [[planned economy]], industrialisation of the largely rural country, and [[Collectivization in the USSR|collectivization]] of its agriculture. During this period of rapid economic and social change, millions of people were sent to [[Gulag|penal labor camps]],&lt;ref name="Getty"&gt;Getty, Rittersporn, Zemskov.

As for the Russian Orthodox Church, Soviet authorities sought to control it and, in times of national crisis, to exploit it for the regime's own purposes; but their ultimate goal was to eliminate it. During the first five years of Soviet power, the Bolsheviks executed 28 Russian Orthodox bishops and over 1,200 Russian Orthodox priests. Many others were imprisoned or exiled. Believers were harassed and persecuted. Most seminaries were closed, and the publication of most religious material was prohibited. By 1941 only 500 churches remained open out of about 54,000 in existence prior to World War I.

====World War II====
The [[Appeasement]] policy of Great [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[France]] towards [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Anschluss|annexation of Austria]] and [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia]] did not stem an increase in the power of [[Nazi Germany]]. Around the same time, the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] allied with the [[Empire of Japan]], a rival of the USSR in the Far East and an open enemy of the USSR in the [[Soviet–Japanese Border Wars]] in 1938–39.

While Hitler conquered Poland and France and other countries acted on a single front at the start of [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]], the USSR was able to build up its military and occupy the Western Ukraine, [[Hertza region]] and Northern [[Bukovina]] as a result of the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]], the [[Winter War]], [[Soviet occupation of the Baltic states (1940)|the occupation of the Baltic states]] and [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina]].

On June 22, 1941, Nazi Germany broke the non-aggression treaty and invaded the Soviet Union with the largest and most powerful invasion force in human history,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=World War&amp;nbsp;II|website=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=March 9, 2008 |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/648813/World-War-II}}&lt;/ref&gt; opening the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|largest theater of World War&amp;nbsp;II]]. Although the [[Wehrmacht|German army]] had considerable early success, their attack was halted in the [[Battle of Moscow]]. Subsequently, the Germans were dealt major defeats first at the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] in the winter of 1942–43,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/648813/World-War-II |website=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=March 12, 2008|title=The Allies' first decisive successes: Stalingrad and the German retreat, summer 1942 – February 1943}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then in the [[Battle of Kursk]] in the summer of 1943. Another German failure was the [[Siege of Leningrad]], in which the city was fully blockaded on land between 1941 and 1944 by German and Finnish forces, and suffered starvation and more than a million deaths, but never surrendered.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110629173955/http://www.cambridge.org/gb/knowledge/isbn/item1173696/?site_locale=en_GB The Legacy of the Siege of Leningrad, 1941–1995]. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Under Stalin's administration and the leadership of such commanders as [[Georgy Zhukov]] and [[Konstantin Rokossovsky]], Soviet forces took Eastern Europe in 1944–45 and [[Battle of Berlin|captured Berlin]] in May 1945. In August 1945 the [[Soviet Army]] [[Soviet–Japanese War|ousted the Japanese]] from China's [[Manchukuo]] and North Korea, contributing to the allied victory over Japan.

The 1941–45 period of World War&amp;nbsp;II is known in Russia as the "[[Great Patriotic War (term)|Great Patriotic War]]".

====Cold War====
[[File:Soviet Union - Russian SFSR.svg|thumb|The RSFSR in 1956–1991, mostly after territorial acquisitions according to WWII treaties, the accession of [[Tuvan People's Republic|Tuva]] in 1944, the [[1954 transfer of Crimea|transfer of the Crimean Oblast in 1954]] and the incorporation of the [[Karelo-Finnish SSR]] in 1956. In 1991, the borders of the Russian SFSR became the Russian Federation's international borders with sovereign states]]

After the war, Eastern and Central Europe including [[East Germany]] and part of [[Austria]] was occupied by [[Red Army]] according to the [[Potsdam Conference]]. Dependent socialist governments were installed in the [[Eastern Bloc]] satellite states. Becoming the world's second [[Russia and weapons of mass destruction|nuclear weapons power]], the USSR established the [[Warsaw Pact]] alliance and entered into a struggle for global dominance, known as the [[Cold War]], with the United States and [[NATO]]. The Soviet Union supported revolutionary movements across the world, including the newly formed People's Republic of China, the [[Democratic People's Republic of Korea]] and, later on, the [[Republic of Cuba]]. Significant amounts of Soviet resources were [[International relations within the Comecon|allocated in aid]] to the other socialist states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rs6.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+su0391%29 Foreign trade] from ''A Country Study: Soviet Union (Former)''. [[Library of Congress Country Studies]] project.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Stalin's death and a short period of [[Collective leadership|collective rule]], the new leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]] denounced the [[cult of personality]] of Stalin and launched the policy of [[de-Stalinization]]. The penal labor system was reformed and many prisoners were released and rehabilitated (many of them posthumously).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,916205-2,00.html|work=TIME|accessdate=August 1, 2008|title=Great Escapes from the Gulag|date=June 5, 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; The general easement of repressive policies became known later as the [[Khrushchev Thaw]]. At the same time, tensions with the United States heightened when the two rivals clashed over the deployment of the United States [[PGM-19 Jupiter|Jupiter missiles]] in Turkey and Soviet [[Cuban Missile Crisis|missiles in Cuba]].

In 1957, the [[Soviet Union]] launched the world's first artificial [[satellite]], ''[[Sputnik&amp;nbsp;1]]'', thus starting the [[Space Age]]. Russia's [[cosmonaut]] [[Yuri Gagarin]] became the first human to orbit the Earth, aboard the ''[[Vostok&amp;nbsp;1]]'' manned spacecraft on [[Cosmonautics Day|April 12, 1961]].

Following the ousting of Khrushchev in 1964, another period of [[Collectivity of leadership|collective rule]] ensued, until [[Leonid Brezhnev]] became the leader. The era of the 1970s and the early 1980s was later designated as the [[Era of Stagnation]], a period when economic growth slowed and social policies became static. The 1965 [[Kosygin reform]] aimed for partial [[decentralization]] of the [[Soviet economy]] and shifted the emphasis from [[heavy industry]] and weapons to [[light industry]] and [[consumer goods]] but was stifled by the conservative Communist leadership.

In 1979, after a Communist-led revolution in Afghanistan, [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan|Soviet forces entered]] that country. The occupation drained economic resources and dragged on without achieving meaningful political results. Ultimately, the Soviet Army was withdrawn from Afghanistan in 1989 due to international opposition, persistent anti-Soviet guerrilla warfare, and a lack of support by Soviet citizens.

From 1985 onwards, the last Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], who sought to enact liberal reforms in the Soviet system, introduced the policies of ''[[glasnost]]'' (openness) and ''[[perestroika]]'' (restructuring) in an attempt to end the [[Era of Stagnation|period of economic stagnation]] and to democratise the government. This, however, led to the rise of strong nationalist and separatist movements. Prior to 1991, the Soviet economy was the second largest in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umsl.edu/services/govdocs/wofact90/world12.txt|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]|accessdate=March 9, 2008|title=1990 CIA World Factbook}}&lt;/ref&gt; but during its last years it was afflicted by shortages of goods in grocery stores, huge budget deficits, and explosive growth in the money supply leading to inflation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.photius.com/countries/russia/economy/russia_economy_unforeseen_results_o~1315.html|title=Russia Unforeseen Results of Reform|publisher=The Library of Congress Country Studies; CIA World Factbook|accessdate=March 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1991, economic and political turmoil began to boil over, as the Baltic republics chose to secede from the Soviet Union. On March 17, a [[Soviet Union referendum, 1991|referendum]] was held, in which the vast majority of participating citizens voted in favour of changing the Soviet Union into a [[Union of Sovereign States|renewed federation]]. In August 1991, [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|a coup d'état attempt]] by members of Gorbachev's government, directed against Gorbachev and aimed at preserving the Soviet Union, instead led to the end of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. On December 25, 1991, the USSR [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|was dissolved]] into 15 [[post-Soviet states]].

In June 1991, [[Boris Yeltsin]] became the first directly elected President in Russian history when he was elected President of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, which became the independent Russian Federation in December of that year. During and after the disintegration of the Soviet Union, wide-ranging reforms including [[Privatization in Russia|privatization]] and [[free trade|market and trade liberalization]] were undertaken,&lt;ref name=OECD /&gt; including radical changes along the lines of "[[shock therapy (economics)|shock therapy]]" as recommended by the United States and the [[International Monetary Fund]].&lt;ref name="Sciolino, E"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/21/world/us-is-abandoning-shock-therapy-for-therussians.html|title= U.S. is abandoning 'shock therapy' for the Russians|author=Sciolino, E.|work=New York Times|accessdate=January 20, 2008|date=December 21, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; All this resulted in a major [[economic crisis]], characterized by a 50% decline in both GDP and industrial output between 1990 and 1995.&lt;ref name=OECD /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Russia: Economic Conditions in Mid-1996|publisher=Library of Congress|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+ru0119)|accessdate=March 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The privatization largely shifted control of enterprises from state agencies to individuals with inside connections in the government. Many of the newly rich moved billions in cash and assets outside of the country in an enormous [[capital flight]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Russia: Clawing Its Way Back to Life (int'l edition) |website=BusinessWeek |url=http://www.businessweek.com/1999/99_48/b3657252.htm |accessdate=December 27, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071122013031/http://www.businessweek.com/1999/99_48/b3657252.htm |archivedate=November 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The depression of the economy led to the collapse of social services; the [[birth rate]] plummeted while the [[death rate]] skyrocketed.&lt;ref name="TBTCTES106"&gt;{{cite book

The 1990s were plagued by armed conflicts in the [[North Caucasus]], both local ethnic skirmishes and separatist [[Islamist]] insurrections. From the time [[Chechnya|Chechen]] separatists declared independence in the early 1990s, an [[First Chechen War|intermittent guerrilla war]] has been fought between the rebel groups and the Russian military. [[Terrorism in Russia|Terrorist attacks against civilians]] carried out by separatists, most notably the [[Moscow theater hostage crisis]] and [[Beslan school siege]], caused hundreds of deaths and drew worldwide attention.

The Russian Federation is fundamentally structured as a [[Multi-party system|multi-party]] [[representative democracy]], with the federal government composed of three branches:
* Legislative: The [[bicameral]] [[Federal Assembly of Russia]], made up of the 450-member [[State Duma]] and the 170-member [[Federation Council]], adopts [[federal law]], [[declaration of war|declares war]], approves treaties, has the [[power of the purse]] and the power of [[impeachment]] of the President.
* Executive: The [[President of Russia|President]] is the [[Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation|Commander-in-Chief]] of the [[Russian Armed Forces|Armed Forces]], can veto [[legislative bill]]s before they become law, and appoints the [[Government of Russia]] (Cabinet) and other officers, who administer and enforce federal laws and policies.
* [[Judiciary of Russia|Judiciary]]: The [[Constitutional Court of Russia|Constitutional Court]], [[Supreme Court of Russia|Supreme Court]] and lower federal courts, whose judges are appointed by the Federation Council on the recommendation of the President, interpret laws and can overturn laws they deem [[unconstitutional]].

Russia is one of five permanent members of the UN Security Council.  The country participates in the [[Quartet on the Middle East]] and the [[Six-party talks]] with North Korea. Russia is a member of the [[Council of Europe]], [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]], and [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation|APEC]]. Russia usually takes a leading role in regional organisations such as the [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]], [[Eurasian Economic Community|EurAsEC]], [[Collective Security Treaty Organisation|CSTO]], and the [[Shanghai Cooperation Organisation|SCO]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/int/sco.htm The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation] at Globalsecurity.org April 27, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Russia became the 39th member state of the Council of Europe in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/russian-federation;jsessionid=72C03060D9E7D3EB3C05D542C3E3E1E8|title=Russian Federation – Member state|publisher=Council of Europe|accessdate=April 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, Russia ratified the [[European Convention on Human Rights]].

An important aspect of Russia's relations with the West is the criticism of Russia's political system and [[human rights in Russia|human rights]] management (including [[LGBT rights in Russia|LGBT rights]], [[media freedom in Russia|media freedom]], and reports about [[List of journalists killed in Russia|killed journalists]]) by Western governments, the mass media and the leading democracy and human rights [[wikt:watchdog|watchdogs]]. In particular, such organisations as [[Amnesty International]] and [[Human Rights Watch]] consider Russia to have not enough democratic attributes and to allow few political rights and civil liberties to its citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/region/russia/report-2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100713010532/http://www.amnesty.org/en/region/russia/report-2009|archivedate=July 13, 2010|title=Amnesty International report on Russia|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=July 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch on Russia and Chechnya [https://www.hrw.org/en/video/2008/04/06/russia-trial HTW.org]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Freedom House]], an international organisation funded by the United States, ranks Russia as "not free", citing "carefully engineered elections" and "absence" of debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2009/russia?page=22&amp;year=2009&amp;country=7689#.VT7KCuH9ycw|title=Annual report Russia|publisher=Freedom House|date=May 10, 2004|accessdate=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian authorities dismiss these claims and especially criticise Freedom House. The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has called the 2006 ''[[Freedom in the World]]'' report "prefabricated", stating that the human rights issues have been turned into a political weapon in particular by the United States. The ministry also claims that such organisations as Freedom House and Human Rights Watch use the same scheme of voluntary extrapolation of "isolated facts that of course can be found in any country" into "dominant tendencies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsru.com/russia/21jun2006/fh.html|title=In Russian: МИД России назвал доклад Freedom House "дубиной" в руках Вашингтона|publisher=Newsru.com|accessdate=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Federal subjects
According to the [[Constitution of Russia|Constitution]], the country comprises eighty-five [[federal subjects of Russia|federal subjects]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Constitution of the Russian Federation |website=[[:ru:Официальный интернет-портал правовой информации|pravo.gov.ru]] |url=http://pravo.gov.ru:8080/page.aspx?94685 |pages=19, 21 |language=Russian |date=April 11, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413142716/http://pravo.gov.ru:8080/page.aspx?94685 |archivedate=April 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the disputed [[Republic of Crimea]] and [[federal cities of Russia|federal city]] of [[Sevastopol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kremlin.ru/events/president/news/20605|title=Treaty Between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Crimea on Ascension to the Russian Federation of the Republic of Crimea and on Establishment of New Subjects Within the Russian Federation|publisher=Kremlin.ru|date=March 18, 2014|accessdate=April 10, 2014|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, when the Constitution was adopted, there were eighty-nine federal subjects listed, but later some of them were merged. These subjects have equal representation—two delegates each—in the [[Federation Council (Russia)|Federation Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Constitution of the Russian Federation|website=(Article 95, §&amp;nbsp;2)|url=http://www.constitution.ru/en/10003000-06.htm|accessdate=December 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they differ in the degree of autonomy they enjoy.
* 46 [[oblasts of Russia|oblasts]] (provinces): most common type of federal subjects, with locally elected governor and legislature.&lt;ref name="FZ_gub_elect" /&gt;
* 22 [[republics of Russia|republics]]: nominally autonomous; each is tasked with drafting its own constitution, direct-elected&lt;ref name="FZ_gub_elect"&gt;Direct elections of heads of republics (and other federal subjects) are mandated by Article 18 of the [http://constitution.garant.ru/act/federative/12117177/chapter/3/#300 Federal Law of 6 October 1999 No. 184-FZ] as amended by [http://base.garant.ru/70169404/#131 Federal Law of 2 May 2012 No. 40-FZ]&lt;/ref&gt; head of republic&lt;ref&gt;Designation of republican heads as presidents is forbidden by [http://graph.document.kremlin.ru/page.aspx?1;1538006 Federal Law of 28 December 2010 No. 406-FZ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116214932/https://graph.document.kremlin.ru/page.aspx?1%3B1538006 |date=January 16, 2013}}, but transitional period lasts until January 1, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; or a similar post, and parliament. Republics are allowed to establish their own official language alongside Russian but are represented by the federal government in international affairs. Republics are meant to be home to specific ethnic minorities.
* 9 [[krais of Russia|krais]] (territories): essentially the same as oblasts. The "territory" designation is historic, originally given to frontier regions and later also to the administrative divisions that comprised autonomous okrugs or autonomous oblasts.
* 4 [[autonomous okrugs of Russia|autonomous okrugs]] (autonomous districts): originally autonomous entities within oblasts and krais created for ethnic minorities, their status was elevated to that of federal subjects in the 1990s. With the exception of [[Chukotka Autonomous Okrug]], all autonomous okrugs are still administratively subordinated to a krai or an oblast of which they are a part.
* 1 [[Autonomous oblasts of Russia|autonomous oblast]] (the [[Jewish Autonomous Oblast]]): historically, autonomous oblasts were administrative units subordinated to krais. In 1990, all of them except for the Jewish AO were elevated in status to that of a republic.
* 3 [[federal cities]] (Moscow, [[Saint Petersburg]], and [[Sevastopol]]): major cities that function as separate regions.

;Federal districts
Federal subjects are grouped into eight [[federal districts of Russia|federal districts]], each administered by an envoy appointed by the President of Russia.&lt;ref&gt;''Russian Classification of Economic Regions'' (OK&amp;nbsp;024–95) of January 1, 1997 as amended by the Amendments #1/1998 through #5/2001. (Section&amp;nbsp;I. Federal Districts)&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the federal subjects, the federal districts are not a subnational level of government, but are a level of administration of the federal government. Federal districts' envoys serve as liaisons between the federal subjects and the federal government and are primarily responsible for overseeing the compliance of the federal subjects with the federal laws.

[[File:Russia Köppen.svg|upright=1.35|thumb|[[Köppen climate classification|Köppen climate types]] of Russia]]
Russia is the [[largest country in the world]]; its total area is {{convert|17075200|km2|sqmi}}.&lt;ref name="General Information"&gt;{{cite web|title=General Information|url=http://www.russianembassy.org/page/general-information|publisher=Russian 6Embassy|accessdate=February 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="area"&gt;[http://www.gks.ru/free_doc/doc_2015/region/reg-pok15.pdf Regions of Russia. Social and economic indicators 2015] Russian Federal State Statistics Service&lt;/ref&gt; It lies between latitudes [[41st parallel north|41°]] and [[82nd parallel north|82° N]], and longitudes [[19th meridian east|19° E]] and [[169th meridian west|169° W]].

Russia's territorial expansion was achieved largely in the late 16th century under the Cossack [[Yermak Timofeyevich]] during the reign of [[Ivan the Terrible]], at a time when competing city-states in the western regions of Russia had banded together to form one country. Yermak mustered an army and pushed eastward where he conquered nearly all the lands once belonging to the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]], defeating their ruler, [[Kuchum|Khan Kuchum]].&lt;ref&gt;Alton S Donnelly, ''The Russian Conquest of Bashkiria'', 1968, pages 23 and 127; Lincoln, W. Bruce. ''The Conquest of a Continent: Siberia and the Russians''. New York: Random House, 1994, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

Russia has a wide natural resource base, including major deposits of timber, petroleum, natural gas, coal, ores and other mineral resources.

=== Topography ===
The two most widely separated points in Russia are about {{convert|8000|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} apart along a [[geodesic]] line. These points are: a {{convert|60|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} long [[Vistula Spit]] the boundary with Poland separating the [[Gdańsk Bay]] from the [[Vistula Lagoon]] and the most southeastern point of the [[Kuril Islands]]. The points which are farthest separated in [[longitude]] are {{convert|6600|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} apart along a geodesic line. These points are: in the west, the same spit on the boundary with Poland, and in the east, the [[Big Diomede Island]]. The Russian Federation spans 11 [[time zone]]s.

[[File:Эльбрус с перевала Гумбаши.JPG|thumb|right|[[Mount Elbrus]], a dormant volcano, is the highest point of the [[Caucasus]] and Russia and the tenth most prominent peak in the world]]
Most of Russia consists of vast stretches of plains that are predominantly [[steppe]] to the south and heavily forested to the north, with [[tundra]] along the northern coast. Russia possesses 10% of the world's [[arable land]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oil prices drive the cost of food|publisher=RIA Novosti|url=http://sputniknews.com/analysis/20080222/99853566.html|accessdate=February 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mountain ranges are found along the southern borders, such as the [[Caucasus Mountains|Caucasus]] (containing [[Mount Elbrus]], which at {{convert|5642|m|0|abbr=on}} is the highest point in both Russia and Europe) and the [[Altai Mountains|Altai]] (containing [[Mount Belukha]], which at the {{convert|4506|m|0|abbr=on}} is the highest point of Siberia outside of the [[Russian Far East]]); and in the eastern parts, such as the [[Verkhoyansk Range]] or the volcanoes of [[Kamchatka Peninsula]] (containing [[Klyuchevskaya Sopka]], which at the {{convert|4750|m|0|abbr=on}} is the highest [[active volcano]] in Eurasia as well as the highest point of [[Asian Russia]]). The [[Ural Mountains]], rich in mineral resources, form a north-south range that divides Europe and Asia.

Russia has an extensive coastline of over {{convert|37000|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} along the Arctic and Pacific Oceans, as well as along the [[Baltic Sea]], [[Sea of Azov]], [[Black Sea]] and [[Caspian Sea]].&lt;ref name=cia&gt;{{cite web|last=The World Factbook|title=CIA|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/rs.html|accessdate=December 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Barents Sea]], [[White Sea]], [[Kara Sea]], [[Laptev Sea]], [[East Siberian Sea]], [[Chukchi Sea]], [[Bering Sea]], [[Sea of Okhotsk]], and the [[Sea of Japan]] are linked to Russia via the Arctic and Pacific. Russia's major islands and archipelagos include [[Novaya Zemlya]], the [[Franz Josef Land]], the [[Severnaya Zemlya]], the [[New Siberian Islands]], [[Wrangel Island]], the [[Kuril Islands]], and [[Sakhalin]]. The [[Diomede Islands]] (one controlled by Russia, the other by the United States) are just {{convert|3|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} apart, and [[Kunashir Island]] is about {{convert|20|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} from [[Hokkaido]], Japan.

[[File:Вид на Кинешемский мост из села Воздвиженье.JPG|thumb|right|[[Volga River]] at [[Ulyanovsk]]. The Volga is the longest river in Europe]]
Russia has thousands of [[Rivers in Russia|rivers]] and inland bodies of water, providing it with one of the world's largest surface water resources. Its lakes contain approximately one-quarter of the world's liquid [[fresh water]].&lt;ref name=loc&gt;{{cite web|last=Library of Congress|title=Topography and drainage|url=http://countrystudies.us/russia/23.htm|accessdate=December 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest and most prominent of Russia's bodies of fresh water is [[Lake Baikal]], the world's deepest, purest, oldest and most capacious fresh water lake.&lt;ref name=baikal&gt;{{cite web|title=Lake Baikal—A Touchstone for Global Change and Rift Studies|publisher=United States Geological Survey|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/baikal/|accessdate=December 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baikal alone contains over one-fifth of the world's fresh surface water.&lt;ref name=loc /&gt; Other major lakes include [[Lake Ladoga|Ladoga]] and [[Lake Onega|Onega]], two of the [[largest lakes in Europe]].

[[File:Морской порт Сочи и прилегающая территория 04.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sochi]], [[Black Sea]] coast]]
The enormous size of Russia and the remoteness of many areas from the sea result in the dominance of the [[humid continental climate]], which is prevalent in all parts of the country except for the tundra and the extreme southwest. Mountains in the south obstruct the flow of warm air masses from the Indian Ocean, while the plain of the west and north makes the country open to Arctic and Atlantic influences.&lt;ref name=congress&gt;{{cite web|title=Climate|publisher=Library of Congress|url=http://countrystudies.us/russia/24.htm|accessdate=December 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of Northern European Russia and Siberia has a [[subarctic climate]], with extremely severe winters in the inner regions of Northeast Siberia (mostly the [[Sakha Republic]], where the Northern [[Pole of Cold]] is located with the record low temperature of {{convert|−71.2|°C|°F|1|disp=or}}), and more moderate winters elsewhere. Both the strip of land along the shore of the Arctic Ocean and the [[Russian Arctic islands]] have a [[polar climate]].

The coastal part of [[Krasnodar Krai]] on the Black Sea, most notably in [[Sochi]], possesses a [[humid subtropical climate]] with mild and wet winters. In many regions of East Siberia and the Far East, winter is dry compared to summer; other parts of the country experience more even precipitation across seasons. Winter precipitation in most parts of the country usually falls as snow. The region along the Lower Volga and Caspian Sea coast, as well as some areas of southernmost Siberia, possesses a [[semi-arid climate]].

From north to south the [[East European Plain]], also known as Russian Plain, is clad sequentially in Arctic [[tundra]], coniferous forest ([[taiga]]), [[mixed and broad-leaf forests]], grassland ([[steppe]]), and semi-desert (fringing the Caspian Sea), as the changes in vegetation reflect the changes in climate.

The Russian central bank announced plans in 2013 to free float the Russian ruble in 2015. According to a stress test conducted by the central bank Russian financial system would be able to handle a currency decline of 25%–30% without major central bank interference. However, the Russian economy began stagnating in late 2013 and in combination with the [[War in Donbass]] is in danger of entering stagflation, slow growth and high inflation. The recent decline in the Russian ruble has increased the costs for Russian companies to make interest payments on debt issued in U.S. dollar or other foreign currencies that have strengthened against the ruble; thus it costs Russian companies more of their ruble-denominated revenue to repay their debt holders in dollars or other foreign currencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/11/10/russia-rouble-debt-idUSL6N0T02OR20141110|title=Falling rouble creates debt payment headache for Russian companies|author=Sujata Rao|date=10 November 2014|website=Reuters|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2016|March}}, the ruble was devalued more than 50 percent since July 2014.&lt;ref name="Nasdaq Mar2016"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasdaq.com/article/bank-of-russia-keeps-rates-on-hold-20160318-00172|title=Today's Stock Market News and Analysis from Nasdaq.com|website=NASDAQ.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, after bringing inflation down to 3.6% in 2012, the lowest rate since gaining independence from the Soviet Union, inflation in Russia jumped to nearly 7.5% in 2014, causing the central bank to increase its lending rate to 8% from 5.5% in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304419104579326441407494108|title=Russia Ready to Float Ruble Next Year Regardless of Rate|last=Ostroukh|first=Andrey|date=January 17, 2014|publisher=Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/russian-central-bank-raises-key-interest-rate-to-8-from-7-5-1406284743|title=Russian Central Bank Raises Key Interest Rate to 8% From 7.5%|last=Razumovskaya|first=Olga|date=July 25, 2014|publisher=Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/USDRUB:CUR|title=USD/RUB exchange rate|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an October 2014 article in ''Bloomberg Business Week'', it was reported that Russia had significantly started shifting its economy towards China in response to increasing financial tensions following its annexation of Crimea and subsequent Western economic sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;"China Embraces Russia", Bloomberg Business Week, October 9, 2014, pp 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

In comparison, some independent experts maintain that corruption consumes as much of 25% of Russia's GDP.&lt;ref&gt;Source: Milov, Nemtsov, Ryzhkov, Shorina (2011). "Putin. Corruption.

In the 1990s, businessmen had to pay different criminal groups to provide a "''krysha''" (literally, a "roof", i.e., protection). Nowadays, this "protective" function is performed by officials. Corrupt hierarchies characterize different sectors of the economy,&lt;ref name="ararat.osipian" /&gt;{{better citation needed|date=October 2018}} including education.&lt;ref name="ararat.osipian" /&gt;{{better citation needed|date=October 2018}}

In the end, the Russian population pays for this corruption.&lt;ref name="ararat.osipian" /&gt;{{better citation needed|date=October 2018}} For example, some experts believe that the rapid increases in tariffs for housing, water, gas and electricity, which significantly outpace the rate of inflation, are a direct result of high volumes of corruption at the highest levels.&lt;ref&gt;Milov et al., Op. cit., 2011, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; In the recent years the reaction to corruption has changed: starting from Putin's second term, very few corruption cases have been the subject of outrage. Putin's system is remarkable for its ubiquitous and open merging of the civil service and business, as well as its use of relatives, friends, and acquaintances to benefit from budgetary expenditures and take over state property. Corporate, property, and land raiding is commonplace.&lt;ref name="ararat.osipian" /&gt;{{better citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Much of Russia's inland waterways, which [[List of countries by waterways length|total {{convert|102000|km|0|abbr=on}}]], are made up of natural rivers or lakes. In the European part of the country the network of channels connects the basins of major rivers. Russia's capital, Moscow, is sometimes called "the port of the five seas", because of its waterway connections to the Baltic, [[White Sea|White]], Caspian, [[Azov Sea|Azov]] and [[Black Sea]]s.

Major sea ports of Russia include [[Rostov-on-Don]] on the Azov Sea, [[Novorossiysk]] on the Black Sea, [[Astrakhan]] and [[Makhachkala]] on the Caspian, [[Kaliningrad]] and St Petersburg on the Baltic, [[Arkhangelsk]] on the White Sea, [[Murmansk]] on the Barents Sea, [[Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky]] and [[Vladivostok]] on the Pacific Ocean. In 2008 the country owned 1,448 [[Merchant marine by country|merchant marine]] ships. The world's only fleet of [[nuclear-powered icebreaker]]s advances the economic exploitation of the Arctic [[continental shelf of Russia]] and the development of sea trade through the [[Northern Sea Route]] between Europe and East Asia.

By [[total length of pipelines]] Russia is second only to the United States. Currently many new pipeline projects are being realized, including [[Nord Stream]] and [[South Stream]] natural gas pipelines to Europe, and the [[Eastern Siberia – Pacific Ocean oil pipeline]] (ESPO) to the Russian Far East and China.

Typically, major Russian cities have well-developed systems of public transport, with the most common varieties of exploited vehicles being bus, [[trolleybus]] and tram. Seven Russian cities, namely [[Moscow Metro|Moscow]], [[Saint Petersburg Metro|Saint Petersburg]], [[Nizhny Novgorod Metro|Nizhny Novgorod]], [[Novosibirsk Metro|Novosibirsk]], [[Samara Metro|Samara]], [[Yekaterinburg Metro|Yekaterinburg]], and [[Kazan Metro|Kazan]], have underground metros, while [[Volgograd]] features a [[Volgograd Metrotram|metrotram]]. The total length of metros in Russia is {{Convert|465.4|km|mi}}. [[Moscow Metro]] and [[Saint Petersburg Metro]] are the oldest in Russia, opened in 1935 and 1955 respectively. These two are among the fastest and [[busiest metro systems]] in the world, and some of them are famous for rich decorations and unique designs of their stations, which is a common tradition in Russian metros and railways.

&lt;!--tag for image of Mikhail Lomonosov is located at end of previous section, raising image to relieve clutter below--&gt;
Science and technology in Russia blossomed since the [[Age of Enlightenment]], when [[Peter the Great]] founded the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] and [[Saint Petersburg State University]], and [[polymath]] [[Mikhail Lomonosov]] established the [[Moscow State University]], paving the way for a strong native tradition in learning and innovation. In the 19th and 20th centuries the country produced a large number of notable scientists and inventors.

The [[Russian physics school]] began with Lomonosov who proposed the law of conservation of matter preceding the [[energy conservation law]]. Russian discoveries and inventions in physics include the [[electric arc]], electrodynamical [[Lenz's law]], [[space groups]] of [[crystal]]s, [[photoelectric cell]], [[superfluidity]], [[Cherenkov radiation]], [[electron paramagnetic resonance]], [[heterotransistor]]s and [[3D holography]]. [[Laser]]s and [[maser]]s were co-invented by [[Nikolai Basov]] and [[Alexander Prokhorov]], while the idea of [[tokamak]] for controlled [[nuclear fusion]] was introduced by [[Igor Tamm]], [[Andrei Sakharov]] and [[Lev Artsimovich]], leading eventually the modern international [[ITER]] project, where Russia is a party.

Since the time of [[Nikolay Lobachevsky]] (the "[[Copernicus]] of [[Geometry]]" who pioneered the [[non-Euclidean geometry]]) and a prominent tutor [[Pafnuty Chebyshev]], the [[Russian mathematical school]] became one of the most influential in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Russian Mathematicians in the 20th Century|year=2003|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=978-981-02-4390-6|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Russian_Mathematicians_in_the_20th_Centu.html?id=BFsnWXkqZaMC|editor=Yakov Sinai}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chebyshev's students included [[Aleksandr Lyapunov]], who founded the modern [[stability theory]], and [[Andrey Markov]] who invented the [[Markov chain]]s. In the 20th century Soviet mathematicians, such as [[Andrey Kolmogorov]], [[Israel Gelfand]], and [[Sergey Sobolev]], made major contributions to various areas of mathematics. Nine Soviet/Russian mathematicians were awarded with the [[Fields Medal]], a most prestigious award in mathematics. Recently [[Grigori Perelman]] was offered the first ever Clay [[Millennium Prize Problems]] Award for his final proof of the [[Poincaré conjecture]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.claymath.org/poincare/index.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130428112451/http://www.claymath.org/poincare/index.html|archivedate=April 28, 2013 |title=The Poincaré Conjecture |publisher=Claymath.org |date= |accessdate=May 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Russian chemist]] [[Dmitry Mendeleev]] invented the [[Periodic table]], the main framework of modern [[chemistry]]. [[Aleksandr Butlerov]] was one of the creators of the theory of [[chemical structure]], playing a central role in [[organic chemistry]]. [[Russian biologists]] include [[Dmitry Ivanovsky]] who discovered viruses, [[Ivan Pavlov]] who was the first to experiment with the [[classical conditioning]], and [[Ilya Mechnikov]] who was a pioneer researcher of the [[immune system]] and [[probiotics]].

Many Russian scientists and inventors were [[émigrés]], like [[Igor Sikorsky]], who built the first [[airliner]]s and modern-type helicopters; [[Vladimir Zworykin]], often called the father of TV; chemist [[Ilya Prigogine]], noted for his work on [[dissipative structures]] and [[complex systems]]; Nobel Prize-winning economists [[Simon Kuznets]] and [[Wassily Leontief]]; physicist [[Georgiy Gamov]] (an author of the [[Big Bang]] theory) and social scientist [[Pitirim Sorokin]]. Many foreigners worked in Russia for a long time, like [[Leonard Euler]] and [[Alfred Nobel]].

[[Russian inventions]] include [[arc welding]] by [[Nikolay Benardos]], further developed by [[Nikolay Slavyanov]], [[Konstantin Khrenov]] and other Russian engineers. [[Gleb Kotelnikov]] invented the [[knapsack parachute]], while [[Evgeniy Chertovsky]] introduced the [[pressure suit]]. [[Alexander Lodygin]] and [[Pavel Yablochkov]] were pioneers of [[electric lighting]], and [[Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky]] introduced the first [[three-phase electric power]] systems, widely used today. [[Sergei Vasiljevich Lebedev|Sergei Lebedev]] invented the first commercially viable and mass-produced type of [[synthetic rubber]]. The first [[ternary computer]], ''[[Setun]]'', was developed by [[Nikolay Brusentsov]].

In the 20th century a number of prominent [[Soviet aerospace engineers]], inspired by the fundamental works of [[Nikolay Yegorovich Zhukovsky|Nikolai Zhukovsky]], [[Sergei Chaplygin]] and others, designed many hundreds of models of military and civilian aircraft and founded a number of ''KBs'' (''Construction Bureaus'') that now constitute the bulk of Russian [[United Aircraft Corporation]]. Famous Russian aircraft include the civilian [[Tupolev|Tu]]-series, [[Sukhoi|Su]] and [[MiG]] fighter aircraft, [[Kamov|Ka]] and [[Mil Moscow Helicopter Plant|Mi]]-series helicopters; many Russian aircraft models are on the [[list of most produced aircraft]] in history.

Famous Russian battle tanks include [[T-34|T34]], the most heavily produced tank design of World War&amp;nbsp;II,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.achtungpanzer.com/panzerkampfwagen-t-34r-soviet-t-34-in-german-service.htm Panzerkampfwagen T-34(r)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110222215401/http://www.achtungpanzer.com/panzerkampfwagen-t-34r-soviet-t-34-in-german-service.htm |date=February 22, 2011 }} by George Parada (n.d.)

With all these achievements, however, since the late Soviet era Russia was lagging behind the West in a number of technologies, mostly those related to [[energy conservation]] and [[consumer goods]] production. The crisis of the 1990s led to the drastic reduction of the state support for science and a [[brain drain]] migration from Russia.

In the 2000s, on the wave of a new economic boom, the situation in the Russian science and technology has improved, and the government [[Medvedev modernisation programme|launched a campaign]] aimed into modernisation and [[innovation]]. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev formulated top priorities for the country's technological development:
* [[Efficient energy use]]
* Information technology, including both common products and the products combined with [[space technology]]
* [[Nuclear power|Nuclear energy]]
* [[Pharmaceuticals]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://sputniknews.com/russia/20091011/156428675.html Medvedev outlines priorities for Russian economy's modernization] RIA Novosti&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently Russia has completed the [[GLONASS]] [[satellite navigation system]]. The country is developing its own [[Sukhoi PAK FA|fifth-generation jet fighter]] and constructing the first serial [[mobile nuclear plant]] in the world.

=== Space exploration ===
Russian achievements in the field of [[space technology]] and [[space exploration]] are traced back to [[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]], the father of theoretical [[astronautics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aiaa.org/index.cfm|title=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics|publisher=Aiaa.org|accessdate=January 2, 2010}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt; His works had inspired leading Soviet rocket engineers, such as [[Sergey Korolyov]], [[Valentin Glushko]], and many others who contributed to the success of the [[Soviet space program]] in the early stages of the [[Space Race]] and beyond.

In 1957 the first Earth-orbiting artificial [[satellite]], ''[[Sputnik&amp;nbsp;1]]'', was launched; in 1961 the first human trip into space was successfully made by [[Yuri Gagarin]]. Many other Soviet and Russian [[space exploration records]] ensued, including the first [[spacewalk]] performed by [[Alexey Leonov]], [[Luna&amp;nbsp;9]] was the first spacecraft to land on the [[Moon]], [[Venera&amp;nbsp;7]] was the first to land on another planet ([[Venus]]), [[Mars&amp;nbsp;3]] then the first to land on [[Mars]], the first [[space exploration rover]] ''[[Lunokhod-1|Lunokhod 1]]'', and the first [[space station]] ''[[Salyut&amp;nbsp;1]]'' and ''[[Mir]]''.

After the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], some government-funded space exploration programs, including the [[Buran programme|Buran]] space shuttle program, were cancelled or delayed, while participation of the Russian space industry in commercial activities and international cooperation intensified.

{{Main|Water supply and sanitation in Russia}}
In Russia, approximately 70 per cent of drinking water comes from surface water and 30 per cent from groundwater. In 2004, water supply systems had a total capacity of 90 million cubic metres a day. The average residential water use was 248 litres per capita per day.&lt;ref name="UN"&gt;United Nations:[https://www.un.org/esa/agenda21/natlinfo/countr/russia/RussiaSanitation04f.pdf Sanitation Country Profile Russian Federation], 2004&lt;/ref&gt; One fourth of the world's fresh surface and [[groundwater]] is located in Russia.

Russians have practised [[Orthodox Christianity]] since the 10th century. According to the historical traditions of the Orthodox Church, [[Christianity]] was first brought to the territory of modern [[Belarus]], Russia and [[Ukraine]] by [[Saint Andrew]], the first [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostle]] of [[Jesus Christ]].&lt;ref name=encarta&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2007 |title=Russia |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761569000_6/Russia.html |accessdate=December 27, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080109010927/https://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761569000_6/Russia.html |archivedate=January 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the ''Primary Chronicle'', the definitive [[Christianization]] of [[Kievan Rus']] dates from the year 988 (the year is disputed&lt;ref&gt;Oleg Rapov, ''Russkaya tserkov v IX–pervoy treti XII veka'' (''The Russian Church from the 9th to the First 3rd of the 12th Century''). Moscow, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;), when [[Vladimir the Great]] was baptized in [[Chersonesus]] and proceeded to baptize his family and people in [[Kiev]]. The latter events are traditionally referred to as the "baptism of Rus'" ({{lang-ru|Крещение Руси}}, {{lang-ua|Хрещення Русі}}) in Russian and Ukrainian literature. Much of the Russian population, like other Slavic peoples, preserved for centuries a double belief (''dvoeverie'') in both indigenous religion and Orthodox Christianity.

At the time of the [[Russian revolution|1917 Revolution]], the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] was deeply integrated into the [[autocracy|autocratic state]], enjoying official status. This was a significant factor that contributed to the Bolshevik attitude to religion and the steps they took to control it. Bolsheviks consisted of many people with non-Russian, Communist Russians and influential Jewish backgrounds such as [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Leon Trotsky]], [[Grigory Zinoviev]], [[Lev Kamenev]], [[Grigori Sokolnikov]] who were indifferent towards Christianity and based on the writings of German philosopher [[Karl Marx]] with [[Marxism–Leninism]] as an ideology went on to form the [[Communist party]].&lt;ref name =PoU&gt;{{Citation |publisher = Studia Historica 48 |isbn = 978-951-710-008-3 |publication-place = Helsinki |title = The Party of Unbelief |url = https://openlibrary.org/books/OL25433417M/The_Party_of_Unbelief |author = [[Arto Luukkanen]] |publication-date = 1994 |oclc = 832629341 |id =|year = 1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

State atheism in the Soviet Union was known in Russian as ''gosateizm'',&lt;ref name=Kowalewski /&gt; and was based on the ideology of [[Marxism–Leninism]]. [[Marxist–Leninist atheism|Marxist–Leninist Atheism]] has consistently advocated the control, suppression, and elimination of religion. Within about a year of the revolution, the state [[expropriated]] all church property, including the churches themselves, and in the period from 1922 to 1926, 28 Russian Orthodox [[bishop]]s and more than 1,200 [[priest]]s were killed. Many more were persecuted.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/russia/38.htm Country Studies: Russia-The Russian Orthodox Church] U.S. Library of Congress, Accessed April 3, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; After the collapse of the Soviet Union there has been a renewal of religions in Russia, and among Slavs various movements have emerged besides Christianity, including [[Rodnovery]] (Slavic Native Faith), [[Ringing Cedars' Anastasianism]], [[Hinduism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tkatcheva|first=Anna|title=Neo-Hindu Movements and Orthodox Christianity in Post-Communist Russia|journal=India International Centre Quarterly|volume=21|number=2/3|pages=151–162|date=1994|jstor=23003642}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Siberian shamanism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kharitonova|first=Valentina|title=Revived Shamanism in the Social Life of Russia|journal=Folklore|volume=62|pages=37–54|date=2015|issn=1406-0949|doi=10.7592/FEJF2015.62}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other religions.

Currently, there is no official census of religion in Russia, and estimates are based on surveys only. In 2012 the research organization Sreda published Arena Atlas, a detailed enumeration of religious populations and nationalities in Russia, based on a large-sample country-wide survey. They found that 46.8% of Russians declared themselves Christians (including 41% Russian Orthodox, 1.5% simply Orthodox or members of non-Russian Orthodox churches, 4.1% unaffiliated Christians, and less than 1% for both Catholic and Protestant), while 25% were [[spiritual but not religious]], 13% were atheists, 6.5% were [[Muslims]], 1.2% were followers of "traditional religions honoring gods and ancestors" (including Rodnovery, [[Tengrism]] and other [[ethnic religions]]), and 0.5% were [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhists]]. However, later that year, the [[Levada Center]] estimated that 76% of Russians were Christians,&lt;ref name="levada.ru"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.levada.ru/2012/12/17/v-rossii-74-pravoslavnyh-i-7-musulman|script-title=ru:Пресс выпуски – В России 74% православных и 7% мусульман|trans-title=Press releases – In Russia 74% are Orthodox and 7% are Muslims|language=ru|website=levada.ru|date=December 17, 2012|accessdate=April 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in June 2013, the Public Opinion Foundation&lt;ref name="fom.ru"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fom.ru/obshchestvo/10953|script-title=ru:Ценности: религиозность|trans-title=Values: Religious|language=ru|website=fom.ru|date=June 14, 2013|accessdate=April 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; estimated that 65% of the population was Christian.

The most recent [[Pew Research Center]] finding was that in 2015 71% of the population of Russia declared itself Eastern Orthodox, 15% [[Irreligion|religiously unaffiliated]]—a category which includes [[atheists]], [[agnostics]] and those who describe their religion as “[[Nothing in Particular|nothing in particular]]”, 10% Muslim, and 2% other Christians, while 1% belonged to other faiths.&lt;ref name="Religious Belief in Central and Eastern Europe"&gt;{{cite web|author=ANALYSIS |url=http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/05/10104119/CEUP-FULL-REPORT.pdf |title=Religious Belief and National Belonging in Central and Eastern Europe |date=May 10, 2017 |accessdate=May 12, 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170513130508/http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/05/10104119/CEUP-FULL-REPORT.pdf |archivedate=May 13, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Irreligion|religiously unaffiliated]] divided between 4% as atheists, 1% as [[agnostics]] and 10% as [[Nothing in Particular|nothing in particular]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pewforum.org/2017/05/10/religious-affiliation/ Religious Belief and National Belonging in Central and Eastern Europe: 1.

Orthodox Christianity, [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], [[Buddhism]], and ethnic religions are recognised as Russia's traditional religions, marking the country's "historical heritage".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rev.

Traced back to the [[Christianization of Kievan Rus']] in the 10th century, Russian Orthodoxy is the dominant religion in the country; smaller Christian denominations such as Catholics, [[Armenian Gregorians]] and various Protestant churches also exist. The Russian Orthodox Church was the country's state religion prior to the Revolution and remains the largest religious body in the country. An estimated 95% of the registered Orthodox parishes belong to the Russian Orthodox Church while there are a number of smaller Orthodox churches.&lt;ref name="religare.ru"&gt;{{cite web |script-title=ru:Сведения о религиозных организациях, зарегистрированных в Российской Федерации по данным Федеральной регистрационной службы|trans-title=Data about religious organizations registered in Russian Federation according to Federal Migration Service records|url=http://www.religare.ru/2_36302.html|language=Russian |date=December 19, 2006|accessdate=December 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the vast majority of Orthodox believers do not attend church on a regular basis. Easter is the most popular religious holiday in Russia, celebrated by a large segment of the Russian population, including large numbers of those who are non-religious. More than three-quarters of the Russian population celebrate Easter by making traditional Easter cakes, coloured eggs and [[paskha (dish)|paskha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interfax-religion.com/?act=news&amp;div=8400|title=Over 90 percent of Russians are going to celebrate Easter anyway – poll|publisher=Interfax Religion|date=April 22, 2011|accessdate=November 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In cultural and social affairs Vladimir Putin has collaborated closely with the Russian Orthodox Church. [[Patriarch Kirill of Moscow]], head of the Church, endorsed his election in 2012. Steven Myers reports, "The church, once heavily repressed, had emerged from the Soviet collapse as one of the most respected institutions... Now Kiril led the faithful directly into an alliance with the state."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Myers|title=The New Tsar|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1PO4DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA404|year=2016|page=404|isbn=978-0-345-80279-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Woods provides specific examples of how the Church under [[Patriarch Kirill of Moscow]] has backed the expansion of Russian power into Crimea and eastern Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.christiantoday.com/article/how.the.russian.orthodox.church.is.backing.vladimir.putins.new.world.order/81108.htm|title=How the Russian Orthodox Church is backing Vladimir Putin's new world order|last=Woods|first=Mark|date=|website=[[Christian Today]]|language=en|access-date=March 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; More broadly the ''New York Times'' reports in September 2016 how that Church's policy prescriptions support the Kremlin's appeal to social conservatives:
: A fervent foe of homosexuality and any attempt to put individual rights above those of family, community or nation, the Russian Orthodox Church helps project Russia as the natural ally of all those who pine for a more secure, illiberal world free from the tradition-crushing rush of globalization, multiculturalism and women's and gay rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/14/world/europe/russia-orthodox-church.html|title=In Expanding Russian Influence, Faith Combines With Firepower|last=Higgins|first=Andrew|date=September 13, 2016|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=March 12, 2017|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 26, 2017, for the first time, The [[U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom]] classified Russia as one of the world's worst violators of religious liberty, recommending in its 2017 annual report that the U.S. government deem Russia a "country of particular concern" under the International Religious Freedom Act and negotiate for religious liberty. The report states, "—it is the sole state to have not only continually intensified its repression of religious freedom since USCIRF commenced monitoring it, but also to have expanded its repressive policies....ranging from administrative harassment to arbitrary imprisonment to extrajudicial killing, are implemented in a fashion that is systematic, ongoing, and egregious."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uscirf.gov/sites/default/files/Russia.2017.pdf|title=Russia Tier1 USCIRF recommended countries of particular concern (CPC)|date=April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 4, 2017 [[UN Special Rapporteur]] on Freedom of Opinion and Expression [[David Kaye (law professor)|David Kaye]], UN Special Rapporteur on Freedoms of Peaceful Assembly and Association [[Maina Kiai]], and UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion and Belief [[Ahmed Shaheed]] condemned Russia's treatment of Jehovah's Witnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.forum18.org/archive.php?article_id=2274|title= RUSSIA:Jehovah's Witnesses banned, property confiscated}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many other countries and international organizations have spoken out on Russia's religious abuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www2.stetson.edu/~psteeves/relnews/170421c.html|title=Russia Religion News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/04/20/russia-court-bans-jehovahs-witnesses|title=Russia: Court Bans Jehovah's Witnesses}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1990, the 11-year school education has been introduced. Education in state-owned secondary schools is free. University level education is free, with exceptions. A substantial share of students is enrolled for full pay (many state institutions started to open commercial positions in the last years).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Higher Education Institutions|url=http://www.gks.ru/free_doc/2007/b07_12/08-10.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303145808/http://www.gks.ru/free_doc/2007/b07_12/08-10.htm|archivedate=March 3, 2012|publisher=[[Rosstat]]|accessdate=January 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest and largest [[Russian universities]] are [[Moscow State University]] and [[Saint Petersburg State University]]. In the 2000s, in order to create higher education and research institutions of comparable scale in Russian regions, the government launched a program of establishing "federal universities", mostly by merging existing large regional universities and research institutes and providing them with a special funding. These new institutions include the [[Southern Federal University]], [[Siberian Federal University]], [[Kazan Volga Federal University]], [[North-Eastern Federal University]], and [[Far Eastern Federal University]].

There are over 160 different ethnic groups and indigenous peoples in Russia.&lt;ref name=ethnicgroups /&gt; The country's vast cultural diversity spans ethnic [[Russians]] with their [[Slavs|Slavic]] [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] traditions, [[Tatars]] and [[Bashkirs]] with their Turkic Muslim culture, [[Buddhist]] [[nomad]]ic [[Buryats]] and [[Kalmyks]], [[Shamanistic]] peoples of the [[Extreme North]] and Siberia, highlanders of the [[Northern Caucasus]], and [[Finno-Ugric peoples]] of the [[Russian North West]] and [[Volga Region]].

[[Handicraft]], like [[Dymkovo toy]], [[khokhloma]], [[gzhel]] and [[palekh miniature]] represent an important aspect of Russian [[folk culture]]. Ethnic Russian clothes include [[kaftan]], [[kosovorotka]] and [[ushanka]] for men, [[sarafan]] and [[kokoshnik]] for women, with [[lapti]] and [[valenki]] as common shoes. The clothes of [[Cossack]]s from Southern Russia include [[Burka (Caucasus)|burka]] and [[papaha]], which they share with the peoples of the Northern Caucasus.

[[Russian cuisine]] widely uses fish, caviar, poultry, mushrooms, berries, and honey. Crops of [[rye]], wheat, [[barley]], and [[millet]] provide the ingredients for various breads, [[pancake]]s and cereals, as well as for [[kvass]], beer and vodka drinks. [[Black bread]] is rather popular in Russia, compared to the rest of the world. Flavourful soups and stews include [[shchi]], [[borsch]], [[ukha]], [[solyanka]] and [[okroshka]]. [[Smetana (dairy product)|Smetana]] (a heavy [[sour cream]]) is often added to soups and salads. [[Pirozhki]], [[blini]] and [[syrniki]] are native types of pancakes. [[Chicken Kiev]], [[pelmeni]] and [[shashlyk]] are popular meat dishes, the last two being of Tatar and Caucasus origin respectively. Other meat dishes include stuffed cabbage rolls ''([[golubtsy]])'' usually filled with meat.&lt;ref name="mrig-golubtsy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moscow-russia-insiders-guide.com/how-to-cook-golubtzy.html |title=How to Cook Golubtzy |publisher=Moscow-russia-insiders-guide.com |date=August 6, 2011 |accessdate=May 4, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501190658/http://www.moscow-russia-insiders-guide.com/how-to-cook-golubtzy.html |archivedate=May 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salads include [[Olivier salad]], [[vinegret]] and [[dressed herring]].

Russia's large number of ethnic groups have distinctive traditions regarding [[Music of Russia#Ethnic roots music|folk music]]. Typical ethnic Russian musical instruments are [[gusli]], [[balalaika]], [[zhaleika]], and [[garmoshka]]. Folk music had a significant influence on Russian classical composers, and in modern times it is a source of inspiration for a number of popular [[folk band]]s, like [[Melnitsa]]. [[Russian folk songs]], as well as patriotic [[Soviet songs]], constitute the bulk of the repertoire of the world-renowned [[Alexandrov Ensemble|Red Army choir]] and other popular ensembles.

Russians have [[Russian traditions|many traditions]], including the washing in [[banya (sauna)|banya]], a hot steam bath somewhat similar to [[sauna]].&lt;ref name="banya" /&gt; Old [[Russian folklore]] takes its roots in the pagan [[Slavic mythology|Slavic religion]]. Many [[Russian fairy tale]]s and epic [[bylina]]s were adapted for animation films, or for feature movies by the prominent directors like [[Aleksandr Ptushko]] (''[[Ilya Muromets (film)|Ilya Muromets]]'', ''[[Sadko (film)|Sadko]]'') and [[Aleksandr Rou]] (''[[Morozko]]'', ''[[Vasilisa the Beautiful (1939 film)|Vasilisa the Beautiful]]''). Russian poets, including [[Pyotr Pavlovich Yershov|Pyotr Yershov]] and [[Leonid Filatov]], made a number of well-known poetical interpretations of the classical fairy tales, and in some cases, like that of [[Alexander Pushkin]], also created fully original fairy tale poems of great popularity.

=== Architecture ===
{{Main|Russian architecture|List of Russian architects}}
[[File:Saint Basil Cathedral, Moscow.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Saint Basil's Cathedral]] in [[Red Square]], [[Moscow]], one of the most popular symbols of the country]]
[[File:Saint Isaac's Cathedral in SPB.jpeg|thumb|right|The neoclassical [[Saint Isaac's Cathedral]] in [[Saint Petersburg]]]]

Since the [[Christianization of Kievan Rus']] for several ages Russian architecture was influenced predominantly by the [[Byzantine architecture]]. Apart from fortifications ([[kremlin]]s), the main stone buildings of ancient Rus' were [[Orthodox church (building)|Orthodox churches]] with their many [[dome]]s, often gilded or brightly painted.

[[Aristotle Fioravanti]] and other Italian architects brought [[Renaissance]] trends into Russia since the late 15th century, while the 16th century saw the development of unique [[tent-like church]]es culminating in [[Saint Basil's Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130116214934/http://www.rusarch.ru/zagraevsky19.htm The first stone tented roof church and the origins of the tented roof architecture] by [[Sergey Zagraevsky]] at RusArch.ru {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; By that time the [[onion dome]] design was also fully developed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130116215900/http://www.rusarch.ru/zagraevsky1.htm The shapes of domes of ancient Russian churches] by [[Sergey Zagraevsky]] at the site of RusArch.ru {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 17th century, the "fiery style" of ornamentation flourished in Moscow and [[Yaroslavl]], gradually paving the way for the [[Naryshkin baroque]] of the 1690s. After the [[reforms of Peter the Great]] the change of architectural styles in Russia generally followed that in the Western Europe.

The 18th-century taste for [[rococo]] architecture led to the ornate works of [[Bartolomeo Rastrelli]] and his followers. The reigns of [[Catherine the Great]] and her grandson [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander&amp;nbsp;I]] saw the flourishing of [[Neoclassical architecture]], most notably in the capital city of [[Saint Petersburg]]. The second half of the 19th century was dominated by the [[Neo-Byzantine architecture in the Russian Empire|Neo-Byzantine]] and [[Russian Revival]] styles. Prevalent styles of the 20th century were the [[Art Nouveau]], [[Constructivist architecture|Constructivism]], and the [[Stalin Empire style]].

[[Russian cultural heritage register#Denial of heritage (1917–1941)|With the change in values imposed by communist ideology]], the tradition of preservation was broken. Independent preservation societies, even those that defended only secular landmarks such as Moscow-based OIRU were disbanded by the end of the 1920s. A new anti-religious campaign, launched in 1929, coincided with collectivization of peasants; destruction of churches in the cities peaked around 1932. A number of churches were demolished, including the [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]] in Moscow. [[Russian cultural heritage register#Post-Soviet Russia (1991–present)|In Moscow alone losses of 1917–2006]] are estimated at over 640 notable buildings (including 150 to 200 listed buildings, out of a total inventory of 3,500) – some disappeared completely, others were replaced with concrete replicas.

In 1955, a new Soviet leader, [[Nikita Khrushchev]], condemned the "excesses" of the former academic architecture,&lt;ref&gt;Russian: Постановление ЦК КПСС и СМ СССР "Об устранении излишеств в проектировании и строительстве", November 4, 1955 (Khrushchev's decree ''On liquidation of excesses&amp;nbsp;...'') {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the late Soviet era was dominated by plain [[functionalism in architecture]]. This helped somewhat to resolve the housing problem, but created a large quantity of buildings of low architectural quality, much in contrast with the previous bright styles. [[Russian cultural heritage register#Khrushchev's offensive (1959–1964)|In 1959 Nikita Khrushchev launched his anti-religious campaign]]. By 1964 over 10 thousand churches out of 20 thousand were shut down (mostly in rural areas) and many were demolished. Of 58 monasteries and convents operating in 1959, only sixteen remained by 1964; of Moscow's fifty churches operating in 1959, thirty were closed and six demolished.

Early Russian painting is represented in [[Russian icons|icons]] and vibrant [[fresco]]s, the two genres inherited from [[Byzantium]]. As Moscow rose to power, [[Theophanes the Greek]], [[Dionisius]] and [[Andrei Rublev]] became vital names associated with a distinctly Russian art.

The [[Russian Academy of Arts]] was created in 1757&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.rah.ru/content/en/section-academy-en.html Russian Academy of Arts] official site.&lt;/ref&gt; and gave Russian artists an international role and status. [[Ivan Argunov]], [[Dmitry Levitzky]], [[Vladimir Borovikovsky]] and other 18th-century academicians mostly focused on [[portrait painting]]. In the early 19th century, when [[neoclassicism]] and [[romantism]] flourished, mythological and Biblical themes inspired many prominent paintings, notably by [[Karl Briullov]] and [[Alexander Andreyevich Ivanov|Alexander Ivanov]].

In the mid-19th century the ''[[Peredvizhniki]]'' (''Wanderers'') group of artists broke with the Academy and initiated a school of art liberated from academic restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gray|first=Camilla|title=Russian Experiment in Art|publisher=Thames and Hudson|location=London|year=2002|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were mostly [[Realism (visual arts)|realist]] painters who captured Russian identity in landscapes of wide rivers, forests, and birch clearings, as well as vigorous genre scenes and robust portraits of their contemporaries. Some artists focused on depicting dramatic moments in Russian history, while others turned to [[social criticism]], showing the conditions of the poor and caricaturing authority; [[Critical realism (philosophy of the social sciences)|critical realism]] flourished under the reign of [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]]. Leading realists include [[Ivan Shishkin]], [[Arkhip Kuindzhi]], [[Ivan Kramskoi]], [[Vasily Polenov]], [[Isaac Levitan]], [[Vasily Surikov]], [[Viktor Vasnetsov]], [[Ilya Repin]], and [[Boris Kustodiev]].

The turn of the 20th century saw the rise of [[symbolism (art)|symbolist]] painting, represented by [[Mikhail Vrubel]], [[Kuzma Petrov-Vodkin]], and [[Nicholas Roerich]].

The [[Russian avant-garde]] was a large, influential wave of [[modernist art]] that flourished in Russia from approximately 1890 to 1930. The term covers many separate, but inextricably related art movements that occurred at the time, namely [[neo-primitivism]], [[suprematism]], [[constructivism (art)|constructivism]], [[rayonism]], and [[Russian Futurism]]. Notable artists from this era include [[El Lissitzky]], [[Kazimir Malevich]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], and [[Marc Chagall]]. Since the 1930s the revolutionary ideas of the [[avant-garde]] clashed with the newly emerged conservative direction of [[socialist realism]].

Soviet art produced works that were furiously patriotic and [[anti-fascist]] during and after the [[Great Patriotic War]]. Multiple war memorials, marked by a great restrained solemnity, were built throughout the country. Soviet artists often combined innovation with socialist realism, notably the sculptors [[Vera Mukhina]], [[Yevgeny Vuchetich]] and [[Ernst Neizvestny]].

[[File:Snowdance.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The ''Snowdance'' scene from ''[[The Nutcracker]]'' ballet, composed by [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]]]

Music in 19th-century Russia was defined by the tension between classical composer [[Mikhail Glinka]] along with other members of [[The Mighty Handful]], who embraced Russian national identity and added religious and folk elements to their compositions, and the [[Russian Musical Society]] led by composers [[Anton Rubinstein|Anton]] and [[Nikolay Rubinstein]]s, which was musically conservative. The later tradition of [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]], one of the greatest composers of the [[Romantic music|Romantic era]], was continued into the 20th century by [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Norris, Gregory; ed.

Modern [[Russian rock]] music takes its roots both in the Western [[rock and roll]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], and in traditions of the [[Russian bards]] of the Soviet era, such as [[Vladimir Vysotsky]] and [[Bulat Okudzhava]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.russia-ic.com/culture_art/music/380/#r1 History of Rock Music in Russia] at Russia-InfoCentre&lt;/ref&gt; Popular Russian rock groups include [[Mashina Vremeni]], [[DDT (band)|DDT]], [[Aquarium (group)|Aquarium]], [[Alisa (Russian band)|Alisa]], [[Kino (band)|Kino]], [[Kipelov]], [[Nautilus Pompilius (band)|Nautilus Pompilius]], [[Aria (band)|Aria]], [[Grazhdanskaya Oborona]], [[Splean]], and [[Korol i Shut]].

=== Literature and philosophy ===

In the 18th century, during the era of [[Russian Enlightenment]], the development of [[Russian literature]] was boosted by the works of [[Mikhail Lomonosov]] and [[Denis Fonvizin]]. By the early 19th century a modern national tradition had emerged, producing some of the greatest writers in Russian history. This period, known also as the [[Golden Age of Russian Poetry]], began with [[Alexander Pushkin]], who is considered the founder of the modern Russian literary language and often described as the "Russian Shakespeare".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Kelly, C|title=Russian Literature: A Very Short Introduction (Paperback)|publisher=Oxford Paperbacks|isbn=978-0-19-280144-9|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; It continued with the poetry of [[Mikhail Lermontov]] and [[Nikolay Nekrasov]], dramas of [[Alexander Ostrovsky]] and [[Anton Chekhov]], and the prose of [[Nikolai Gogol]] and [[Ivan Turgenev]]. [[Leo Tolstoy]] and [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] have been described by literary critics as the greatest novelists of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/513793/Russian-literature|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=April 11, 2008|title=Russian literature; Leo Tolstoy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=Time Magazine |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,943893,00.html|accessdate=April 10, 2008|title=Freaking-Out with Fyodor|author=Otto Friedrich|date=September 6, 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1880s, the age of the great novelists was over, and short fiction and poetry became the dominant genres. The next several decades became known as the [[Silver Age of Russian Poetry]], when the previously dominant [[literary realism]] was replaced by [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]]. Leading authors of this era include such poets as [[Valery Bryusov]], [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (poet)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]], [[Alexander Blok]], [[Nikolay Gumilev]] and [[Anna Akhmatova]], and novelists [[Leonid Andreyev]], [[Ivan Bunin]], and [[Maxim Gorky]].

[[Russian philosophy]] blossomed in the 19th century, when it was defined initially by the opposition of [[Westernizers]], who advocated Western political and economical models, and [[Slavophiles]], who insisted on developing Russia as a unique civilization. The latter group includes [[Nikolai Danilevsky]] and [[Konstantin Leontiev]], the founders of [[eurasianism]]. In its further development Russian philosophy was always marked by a deep connection to literature and interest in creativity, society, politics and nationalism; [[Russian cosmism]] and religious philosophy were other major areas. Notable philosophers of the late 19th and the early 20th centuries include [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyev]], [[Sergei Bulgakov]], and [[Vladimir Vernadsky]].

[[File:AleksandrPushkin.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Alexander Pushkin]] (portrait by [[Vasily Tropinin]])]]

Following the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 many prominent writers and philosophers left the country, including Bunin, [[Vladimir Nabokov]] and [[Nikolay Berdyayev]], while a new generation of talented authors joined together in an effort to create a distinctive [[working-class culture]] appropriate for the new Soviet state. In the 1930s censorship over literature was tightened in line with the policy of [[socialist realism]]. In the late 1950s restrictions on literature were eased, and by the 1970s and 1980s, writers were increasingly ignoring official guidelines. Leading authors of the Soviet era include novelists [[Yevgeny Zamyatin]] (emigrated), [[Ilf and Petrov]], [[Mikhail Bulgakov]] (censored) and [[Mikhail Sholokhov]], and poets [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]], [[Yevgeny Yevtushenko]], and [[Andrey Voznesensky]].

The Soviet Union was also a major producer of science fiction, written by authors like [[Arkady and Boris Strugatsky]], [[Kir Bulychov]], [[Alexander Belayev]] and [[Ivan Yefremov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=McGuire, Patrick L.|title=Red stars: political aspects of Soviet science fiction.

Russian and later [[Soviet cinema]] was a hotbed of invention in the period immediately following 1917, resulting in world-renowned films such as ''[[The Battleship Potemkin]]'' by [[Sergei Eisenstein]].&lt;ref name=film&gt;{{cite web|title=Russia:Motion pictures|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|year=2007|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/513251/Russia|accessdate=December 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eisenstein was a student of filmmaker and theorist [[Lev Kuleshov]], who developed the [[Soviet montage theory]] of film editing at the world's first film school, the [[All-Union Institute of Cinematography]]. [[Dziga Vertov]], whose ''kino-glaz'' ("film-eye") theory—that the camera, like the human eye, is best used to explore real life—had a huge impact on the development of documentary film making and cinema realism. The subsequent state policy of socialist realism somewhat limited creativity; however, many Soviet films in this style were artistically successful, including ''[[Chapaev (film)|Chapaev]]'', ''[[The Cranes Are Flying]]'', and ''[[Ballad of a Soldier]]''.&lt;ref name=film /&gt;

The 1960s and 1970s saw a greater variety of artistic styles in Soviet cinema. [[Eldar Ryazanov]]'s and [[Leonid Gaidai]]'s comedies of that time were immensely popular, with many of the catch phrases still in use today. In 1961–68 [[Sergey Bondarchuk]] directed an [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-winning [[War and Peace (film series)|film adaptation]] of Leo Tolstoy's epic ''[[War and Peace]]'', which was [[the most expensive film]] made in the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;Birgit Beumers.

[[Russian animation]] dates back to late [[Russian Empire]] times. During the Soviet era, [[Soyuzmultfilm]] studio was the largest animation producer. Soviet animators developed a great variety of pioneering techniques and aesthetic styles, with prominent directors including [[Ivan Ivanov-Vano]], [[Fyodor Khitruk]] and [[Aleksandr Tatarsky]]. Many Soviet cartoon heroes such as the Russian-style [[Winnie-the-Pooh]], cute little [[Cheburashka]], Wolf and Hare from ''[[Nu, Pogodi!]]'', are iconic images in Russia and many surrounding countries.

The late 1980s and 1990s were a period of crisis in Russian cinema and animation. Although Russian filmmakers became free to express themselves, state subsidies were drastically reduced, resulting in fewer films produced. The early years of the 21st century have brought increased viewership and subsequent prosperity to the industry on the back of the economic revival. Production levels are already higher than in Britain and Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dzieciolowski, Z|title=Kinoeye: Russia's reviving film industry|url=https://www.opendemocracy.net/globalization-Film/russian_film_3726.jsp|accessdate=December 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia's total box-office revenue in 2007 was $565&amp;nbsp;million, up 37% from the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Russian Entertainment &amp; Media Industry worth $27.9 bn by 2011|publisher=joomag magazine|url=http://www.joomag.com/magazine/Russia/4228/p44|accessdate=October 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 the ''[[Russian Ark]]'' became the first feature film ever to be shot in a single take. The traditions of Soviet animation were developed recently by such directors as [[Aleksandr Petrov (animator)|Aleksandr Petrov]] and studios like [[Melnitsa Animation]].

While there were few stations or channels in the Soviet time, in the past two decades many new state and privately owned [[Russian language radio stations|radio stations]] and [[TV in Russia|TV channels]] have appeared. In 2005 a state-run English language [[Russia Today TV]] started broadcasting, and its Arabic version [[Rusiya Al-Yaum]] was launched in 2007. Censorship and [[Media freedom in Russia]] has always been a main theme of Russian media.

Soviet and later [[Russia at the Olympics|Russian athletes]] have always been in the top four for the number of gold medals collected at the Summer Olympics. Soviet gymnasts, track-and-field athletes, weightlifters, wrestlers, boxers, fencers, shooters, cross country skiers, biathletes, speed skaters and figure skaters were consistently among the best in the world, along with Soviet basketball, handball, volleyball and ice hockey players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.la84foundation.org/OlympicInformationCenter/OlympicReview/1974/ore84/ore84k.pdf|title=The USSR and Olympism|journal=[[Olympic Review]]|issue=84|pages=530–557|date=October 1974|format=PDF |accessdate=March 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[1980 Summer Olympics]] were held in Moscow while the [[2014 Winter Olympics]] were hosted in [[Sochi]].

[[Association football]] is one of the most popular sports in modern Russia. The Soviet national team became the first European Champions by winning [[Euro 1960]]. Appearing in four [[FIFA World Cup]]s from 1958 to 1970, [[Lev Yashin]] is regarded as one of the greatest goalkeepers in the history of football, and was chosen on the [[FIFA World Cup Dream Team]].&lt;ref name="FIFA"&gt;[https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/players/player=174638/ "Yashin, the impregnable Spider"]. FIFA. Retrieved November 28, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet national team reached the finals of [[Euro 1988]]. In 1956 and 1988, the Soviet Union won gold at the [[Football at the Summer Olympics#Men's results|Olympic football tournament]]. Russian clubs [[PFC CSKA Moscow|CSKA Moscow]] and [[Zenit St Petersburg]] won the [[UEFA Cup]] in 2005 and 2008. The [[Russian national football team]] reached the semi-finals of [[Euro 2008]], losing only to the eventual champions Spain. Russia had hosted the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], with 11 host cities located in the European part of the country and in the Ural region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Russia announce the 11 host cities to stage matches for 2018 World Cup|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/29/russia-host-cities-2018-world-cup|publisher=The Guardian|date=April 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the [[Russian national basketball team]] won the [[EuroBasket 2007|European Basketball Championship]]. The Russian basketball club [[PBC CSKA Moscow]] is one of the top teams in Europe, winning the [[Euroleague]] in [[2005–06 Euroleague|2006]] and [[2007–08 Euroleague|2008]].

[[Larisa Latynina]], who currently holds the record for the most gold Olympic medals won by a woman, established the USSR as the dominant force in gymnastics for many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/SPORT/07/07/oly.olympians/index.html|publisher=CNN| title=Legendary Olympians|date=August 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Russia is the leading nation in [[rhythmic gymnastics]] with [[Yevgeniya Kanayeva]].

[[Figure skating]] is another popular sport in Russia, especially [[pair skating]] and [[ice dancing]]. With the exception of [[Figure skating at the 2010 Winter Olympics|2010]] a Soviet or Russian pair has won gold at every Winter Olympics since 1964.

Since the end of the Soviet era, tennis has grown in popularity and Russia has produced a number of famous players, including [[Maria Sharapova]]. In martial arts, Russia produced the sport [[Sambo (martial art)|Sambo]] and renowned fighters, like [[Fedor Emelianenko]]. [[Chess]] is a widely popular pastime in Russia; from 1927, Russian grandmasters have held the [[world chess championship]] almost continuously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chessgames.com/wcc.html|title=Chessgames guide to the World Championship|publisher=Chessgames.com|accessdate=October 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[2014 Winter Olympics]] were held in Sochi in the south of Russia. In 2016 the [[McLaren Report]] found evidence of widespread [[Doping in Russia|state-sponsored doping]] and an institutional conspiracy to cover up Russian competitors' positive drug tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WADA Statement regarding conclusion of McLaren Investigation|url=https://www.wada-ama.org/en/media/news/2016-12/wada-statement-regarding-conclusion-of-mclaren-investigation|publisher=World Anti-Doping Agency|date=December 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2017|December|1}} 25 athletes are disqualified, 11 medals are stripped.

Formula One is also becoming increasingly popular in Russia. In 2010 [[Vitaly Petrov]] of [[Vyborg]] became the first Russian to drive in Formula One, and was soon followed by a second – [[Daniil Kvyat]], from [[Ufa]] – in 2014. There had only been two Russian Grands Prix (in 1913 and 1914), but the [[Russian Grand Prix]] returned as part of the [[Formula One]] season in [[2014 Formula One season|2014]], as part of a six-year deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Russia secures 2014 grand prix deal|url=http://en.espn.co.uk/f1/motorsport/story/31127.html|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=October 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== National holidays and symbols ===
{{Main|Public holidays in Russia|Cultural icons of Russia}}
[[File:Alyye parusa.jpg|thumb|left|[[Scarlet Sails (tradition)|Scarlet Sails]] celebration on the [[Neva]] river in [[Saint Petersburg]]]]
There are seven [[public holidays in Russia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sras.org/russian_holidays|title=Official days off for public holidays in Russia|publisher=Sras.org|accessdate=October 29, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130020221/http://sras.org/russian_holidays#|archive-date=November 30, 2010|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; except those always celebrated on Sunday. Russian New Year traditions resemble those of the Western Christmas, with [[New Year Tree]]s and gifts, and [[Ded Moroz]] ([[Father Frost]]) playing the same role as [[Santa Claus]]. [[Orthodox Christmas]] falls on January 7, because the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] still follows the [[Julian calendar]], and all Orthodox holidays are 13 days after Western ones. Two other major Christian holidays are Easter and [[Trinity Sunday]]. [[Kurban Bayram]] and [[Uraza Bayram]] are celebrated by Russian Muslims.

Further Russian public holidays include [[Defender of the Fatherland Day]] (February 23), which honors Russian men, especially those serving in the army; [[International Women's Day]] (March 8), which combines the traditions of [[Mother's Day]] and [[Valentine's Day]]; [[Spring and Labor Day]] (May 1); [[Victory Day (May 9)|Victory Day]] (May 9); [[Russia Day]] (June 12); and [[Unity Day (Russia)|Unity Day]] (November 4), commemorating the popular uprising which expelled the Polish occupation force from Moscow in 1612.

[[Victory Day (May 9)|Victory Day]] is the second most popular holiday in Russia; it commemorates the victory over [[Nazi Germany]] and its allies in the [[Great Patriotic War]]. A huge [[military parade]], hosted by the [[President of Russia]], is annually organised in Moscow on [[Red Square]]. Similar parades take place in all major Russian cities and cities with the status ''[[Hero city]]'' or ''City of Military Glory''.

Popular non-public holidays include [[Old New Year]] (the New Year according to the Julian Calendar on January 14), [[Tatiana Day]] (students holiday on January 25), [[Maslenitsa]] (a pre-Christian spring holiday a week before the [[Great Lent]]), [[Cosmonautics Day]] (in tribute to the first human trip into space), [[Ivan Kupala Day]] (another pre-Christian holiday on July 7) and [[Peter and Fevronia Day]] (which takes place on July 8 and is the Russian analogue of Valentine's Day, focusing, however, on family love and fidelity).

[[File:Russian-Matroshka2.jpg|thumb|[[Matryoshka doll]] taken apart]]
State symbols of Russia include the [[Byzantine]] [[double-headed eagle]], combined with [[St. George of Moscow]] in the [[Russian coat of arms]]. The [[Russian flag]] dates from the late [[Tsardom of Russia]] period and has been widely used since the time of the [[Russian Empire]]. The [[Russian anthem]] shares its music with the [[Soviet Anthem]], though not the lyrics. The imperial [[motto]] ''God is with us'' and the Soviet motto ''Proletarians of all countries, unite!'' are now obsolete and no new motto has replaced them. The [[hammer and sickle]] and the full [[Soviet coat of arms]] are still widely seen in Russian cities as a part of old architectural decorations. The Soviet [[Red Star]]s are also encountered, often on military equipment and war memorials. The [[Red Banner]] continues to be honored, especially the [[Banner of Victory]] of 1945.

The [[Matryoshka doll]] is a recognizable symbol of Russia, and the towers of [[Moscow Kremlin]] and [[Saint Basil's Cathedral]] in Moscow are Russia's main architectural icons. [[Cheburashka]] is a mascot of the [[Russian national Olympic team]]. [[St. Mary]], [[St. Nicholas]], [[St. Andrew]], [[St. George]], [[St. Alexander Nevsky]], [[St. Sergius of Radonezh]] and [[St. Seraphim of Sarov]] are Russia's [[patron saint]]s. [[Chamomile]] is the [[national flower]], while [[birch]] is the [[national tree]]. The [[Russian bear]] is an animal symbol and a [[national personification]] of Russia, though this image has a Western origin and Russians themselves have accepted it only fairly recently. The native Russian national personification is [[Mother Russia]].

[[File:Grand Cascade of Peterhof 01.jpg|thumb|left|[[Peterhof Palace#The Grand Cascade and Samson Fountain|Grand Cascade]] in [[Peterhof Palace|Peterhof]], a popular tourist destination in Saint Petersburg]]

Tourism in Russia has seen rapid growth since the late Soviet period, first domestic tourism and then international tourism, fueled by the rich cultural heritage and great natural variety of the country. Major tourist routes in Russia include a journey around the [[Golden Ring]] of ancient cities, cruises on the big rivers like the [[Volga]], and long journeys on the famous [[Trans-Siberian Railway]]. In 2013, Russia was visited by 28.4 million [[tourist]]s; it is the ninth most visited country in the world and the seventh most visited in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-unwto.org/content/r13521/fulltext.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150112082549/http://www.e-unwto.org/content/r13521/fulltext.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2015-01-12|title=Tourism Highlights 2014|publisher=UNWTO (World Tourism Organization)|format=PDF|date=2014|accessdate=January 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of Western visitors dropped in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rbth.com/business/2014/07/03/concern_in_russia_as_foreign_tourist_numbers_slump_37899.html|title=Concern in Russia as foreign tourist numbers slump|first=Viktor|last=Kuzmin|date=July 3, 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mamaev kurgan (ОКН).JPG|thumb|''[[The Motherland Calls]]'' in [[Volgograd]] is the tallest statue of a woman in the world (not including pedestals)]]
The most visited destinations in Russia are Moscow and Saint Petersburg, the current and former capitals of the country. Recognized as [[World Cities]], they feature such world-renowned museums as the [[Tretyakov Gallery]] and the [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]], famous theaters like [[Bolshoi Theater|Bolshoi]] and [[Mariinsky Theater|Mariinsky]], ornate churches like Saint Basil's Cathedral, [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]], [[Saint Isaac's Cathedral]] and [[Church of the Savior on Blood]], impressive fortifications like the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]] and [[Peter and Paul Fortress]], beautiful squares and streets like [[Red Square]], [[Palace Square]], [[Tverskaya Street]], [[Nevsky Prospect]], and [[Arbat Street]]. Rich palaces and parks are found in the former imperial residences in suburbs of [[Moscow]] ([[Kolomenskoye]], [[Tsaritsyno Park|Tsaritsyno]]) and St Petersburg ([[Peterhof Palace|Peterhof]], [[Strelna]], [[Oranienbaum, Russia|Oranienbaum]], [[Gatchina Palace|Gatchina]], [[Pavlovsk Palace|Pavlovsk]] and [[Tsarskoye Selo]]). Moscow displays [[Stalinist architecture|Soviet architecture]] at its best, along with [[Moscow International Business Center|modern skyscrapers]], while St Petersburg, nicknamed ''Venice of the North'', boasts of its classical architecture, many rivers, canals and [[Bridges in Saint Petersburg|bridges]].

[[Kazan]], the capital of [[Tatarstan]], shows a mix of Christian Russian and Muslim Tatar cultures. The city has registered a brand ''The Third Capital of Russia'', though a number of other major cities compete for this status, including [[Novosibirsk]], [[Yekaterinburg]] and [[Nizhny Novgorod]].

The warm subtropical Black Sea coast of Russia is the site for a number of popular sea resorts, like [[Sochi]], the follow-up host of the [[2014 Winter Olympics]]. The mountains of the [[Northern Caucasus]] contain popular ski resorts such as [[Dombay, Russia|Dombay]]. The most famous natural destination in Russia is [[Lake Baikal]], ''the Blue Eye of Siberia''. This unique lake, the oldest and deepest in the world, has crystal-clear waters and is surrounded by [[taiga]]-covered mountains. Other popular natural destinations include [[Kamchatka]] with its volcanoes and geysers, [[Karelia]] with its lakes and [[granite]] rocks, the snowy [[Altai Mountains]], and the wild steppes of [[Tuva]].

The '''Senate''' (''Sénat'') is the upper house of the [[Parliament of Gabon]]. It has 102 members, elected for a six-year term in single-seat [[constituency|constituencies]] by local and départemental councillors. Beginning with the 2009 election, some constituencies elect two senators.

The 1991 Constitution provided for the establishment of the Senate; previously the legislature had consisted of a unicameral [[National Assembly of Gabon|National Assembly]]. The Senate was not created until 1997, when an election was held to fill the seats in the upper house.&lt;ref&gt;David E. Gardinier and Douglas A. Yates, ''Historical Dictionary of Gabon'' (third edition, 2006), Scarecrow Press, page 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Senate president was [[Georges Rawiri]] (1932-2006), a long-time national political figure and close ally of [[Omar Bongo]]. He served in this position until his death in 2006.

He was replaced by [[René Radembino Coniquet]], also a member of the [[Myéné]] ethnic group.

A [[Gabonese Senate election, 2009|Senate election]] was held on 18 January 2009. The ruling [[Gabonese Democratic Party]] won a large majority of seats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gabonews.ga/actualite/actualites_2007.php?Article=6143 "Gabon: Elections sénatoriales 2009: le PDG en tête des résultats"]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Gabonews, 19 January 2009 {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On this occasion, the number of senators was increased from 91 to 102. Following the election, [[Rose Francine Rogombé]] was elected as President of the Senate.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1754">The '''UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee''' (or '''UK-APC''') is a [[United Kingdom]] government committee, part of the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]], responsible for recommending names of geographical locations within the [[British Antarctic Territory]] (BAT) and the [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]] (SGSSI). Such names are formally approved by the Commissioners of the BAT and SGSSI respectively, and published in the BAT Gazetteer and the SGSSI Gazetteer maintained by the Committee. The BAT names are published in the international [[Composite Gazetteer of Antarctica]] maintained by [[Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research|SCAR]], too.

The Committee may also consider proposals for new place names for geographical features in areas of Antarctica outside BAT and SGSSI, which are referred to other Antarctic place-naming authorities, or decided by the Committee itself if situated in the unclaimed sector of Antarctica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apc.antarctica.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/sites/9/2013/03/APC0501_minutes.pdf |title=UK-APC Meeting |date=2005-05-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170106012611/http://apc.antarctica.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/sites/9/2013/03/APC0501_minutes.pdf |archivedate=2017-01-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wardija Tower''' ({{lang-mt|Torri tal-Wardija}}), originally known as '''''Torre della Guardia di Giorno'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ġrajjet Malta - It-Tielet Ktieb|date=2006|publisher=Department of Education|location=[[Sliema]]|page=81|edition=4|language=mt}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also known as '''Bubaqra Tower''' ({{lang-mt|Torri ta' Bubaqra}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zammit|first1=Vincent|title=Il-Gran Mastri - Ġabra ta' Tagħrif dwar l-Istorja ta' Malta fi Żmienhom - L-Ewwel Volum 1530-1680|date=1992|publisher=Valletta Publishing &amp; Promotion Co. Ltd.|location=[[Valletta]]|page=236|language=mt}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a small [[watchtower]] in the limits of [[Żurrieq]], [[Malta]]. It was completed in June 1659 as the thirteenth of the [[De Redin towers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Palace &amp; Towers|url=http://zurrieqlocalcouncil.com/palace-towers/|website=Żurrieq Local Council|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wardija Tower was the last coastal watchtower to be built on the [[Malta (island)|main island of Malta]]. It is situated between [[Żurrieq]] and [[Ħal Far]], with the nearest tower to it being [[Sciuta Tower]] to the west. 

The tower follows the standard design of the De Redin towers, having a square plan with two floors and a turret on the roof, but it is slightly smaller. It was originally armed with 2 cannons and 2 mortars.
