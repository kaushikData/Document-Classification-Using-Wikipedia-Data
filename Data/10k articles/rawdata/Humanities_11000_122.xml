{{US Constitution article series}}
The '''Admission to the Union''' Clause of the [[United States Constitution]], often called the '''New States Clause''', found at Article IV, Section 3, [[Article Four of the United States Constitution#Clause 1: New states|Clause 1]], authorizes the [[United States Congress|Congress]] to admit new [[U.S. state|states]] into the [[United States]] beyond the [[Thirteen Colonies|thirteen]] already in existence at the time the Constitution went [[Coming into force|into effect]].

The Constitution went into effect on June 21, 1788, after ratification by 9 of the 13 states, and the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] began operations under it on March 4, 1789.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=March 4: A forgotten huge day in American history|url=https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/march-4-a-forgotten-huge-day-in-american-politics/|work=Constitution Daily|publisher=[[National Constitution Center]]|accessdate=October 21, 2015|location=Philadelphia|date=March 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, 37 additional states have been admitted into the Union. Each new state has been admitted on an [[equal footing]] with those already in existence.&lt;ref name=DEoS&gt;{{cite web|title=Doctrine of the Equality of States|url=https://law.justia.com/constitution/us/article-4/15-doctrine-of-the-equality-of-states.html|website=Justia.com|location=Mountain View, California|accessdate=April 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the 37 states admitted to the Union by Congress, all but six have been established within an existing U.S. [[Organized incorporated territories of the United States|organized incorporated territory]]. A state so created might encompass all or a portion of a territory. When the people of a territory or a region thereof would make their desire for statehood known to the federal government, in most cases Congress passed an [[enabling act]] authorizing the people of that territory or region to frame a proposed [[State constitution (United States)|state constitution]] as a step toward admission to the Union. Although the use of an enabling act was a common historic practice, a number of states were admitted to the Union without one.

In many instances, an enabling act would detail the mechanism by which the territory would be admitted as a state following ratification of their constitution and election of state officers. Although the use of such an act is a traditional historic practice, a number of territories have drafted constitutions for submission to Congress absent an enabling act and were subsequently admitted. The broad outline for this process was established by the [[Land Ordinance of 1784]] and the 1787 [[Northwest Ordinance]], both of which predate the present U.S. Constitution.

The Admission to the Union Clause also forbids the creation of new states from parts of existing states without the consent of both the affected states and Congress. The primary intent of this caveat was to give Eastern states that still had [[State cessions|western land claims]] (there were four at that time) a [[veto]] over whether their western counties could become states.&lt;ref name=4.3.1&gt;{{cite web|last1=Forte|first1=David F.|title=Essays on Article IV: New States Clause|url=https://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/4/essays/125/new-states-clause|work=The Heritage Guide to the Constitution|publisher=The Heritage Foundation|location=Washington, D.C.|accessdate=April 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This clause has served the same function since, each time a [[List of U.S. state partition proposals|proposal to partition]] an existing state or states has arisen.

Article IV, Section 3, Clause 1:
{{quote|New States may be admitted by the Congress into this Union; but no new State shall be formed or erected within the Jurisdiction of any other State; nor any State be formed by the Junction of two or more States, or Parts of States, without the Consent of the Legislatures of the States concerned as well as of the Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Constitution of the United States of America: Analysis and Interpretation, Centennial Edition, Interim Edition: Analysis of Cases Decided by the Supreme Court of the United States to June 26, 2013|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-CONAN-2013/pdf/GPO-CONAN-2013.pdf|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|accessdate=April 5, 2016|location=Washington, DC|pages=16–17|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Background==

===Articles of Confederation===
Between 1781 and 1789 the United States was governed by a [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] Congress, the [[Congress of the Confederation]], which operated under authority granted to it by the [[Articles of Confederation]], the nation's first constitution. The 11th Article authorized Congress to admit new states to the Union provided nine states consented. Under the Articles, each state cast one vote on each proposed measure in Congress.

During this period, the Confederation Congress enacted two ordinances governing the admission of new states into the Union. The first such ordinance was the [[Land Ordinance of 1784]], enacted April 23, 1784.&lt;ref name=breakthrough&gt;{{cite book |author1=Grupo de Investigadores Puertorriqueños |title=Breakthrough From Colonialism: An Interdisciplinary Study of Statehood |date=1984 |publisher=University of Puerto Rico |volume=1 |isbn=9780847724895 |oclc=836947912 |pages=20–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Jefferson]] was its principal author. The Ordinance called for the land (recently confirmed as part of the United States by the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]]) west of the [[Appalachian Mountains]], north of the [[Ohio River]] and east of the [[Mississippi River]] to eventually be divided into ten separate states. Once a given area reached 20,000 inhabitants, it could call a constitutional convention and form a [[provisional government]]. Then, upon enacting a state constitution which affirmed that the new state would forever be part of the Confederation, would be subject to the Articles of Confederation and acts of Congress, would be subject to payment for federal debts and would not tax federal properties within the state border or tax non-residents at a rate higher than residents, and would have a [[republican form of government]],&lt;ref name=breakthrough/&gt;  and also after reaching a population equal to that of the least-populated of the established states, it would be admitted, on an equal footing with all other states, based on a majority vote in Congress.&lt;ref name=breakthrough/&gt; Jefferson's original draft of the ordinance gave names to the proposed states, and also contained a provision that "After the year 1800 there shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude in any of them."&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://jeffersonswest.unl.edu/archive/view_doc.php?id=jef.00155 | title = Report from the Committee for the Western Territory to the United States Congress | work = Envisaging the West: Thomas Jefferson and the Roots of Lewis and Clark | publisher = [[University of Nebraska–Lincoln]] and [[University of Virginia]] | date = March 1, 1784 | accessdate = April 7, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1784 ordinance was superseded three years later by the [[Northwest Ordinance of 1787]]. Enacted by the Confederation Congress on July 13, 1787, it created the [[Northwest Territory]], the first [[Organized incorporated territories of the United States|organized incorporated territory]] of the United States. The Northwest Ordinance (Article V) provided for the admission of several new states from within its bounds:
{{quote| There shall be formed in the said territory, not less than three nor more than five States [...] And, whenever any of the said States shall have sixty thousand free inhabitants therein, such State shall be admitted, by its delegates, into the Congress of the United States, on an equal footing with the original States in all respects whatever, and shall be at liberty to form a permanent constitution and State government: Provided, the constitution and government so to be formed, shall be republican, and in conformity to the principles contained in these articles; and, so far as it can be consistent with the general interest of the confederacy, such admission shall be allowed at an earlier period, and when there may be a less number of free inhabitants in the State than sixty thousand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Northwest Ordinance; July 13, 1787|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/nworder.asp|work=Avalon Project|publisher=Lillian Goldman Law Library, Yale Law School|accessdate=February 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Considered one of the most important legislative acts of the Confederation Congress,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Northwest Ordinance|url=http://loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/northwest.html|website=loc.gov|publisher=Library of Congress|location=Washington, D.C.|accessdate=April 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; it established the precedent by which the Federal government would be sovereign and expand westward with the admission of new states, rather than with the expansion of existing states and their established sovereignty under the Articles of Confederation.

No new states were formed in the Northwest Territory under either ordinance. In August, 1789, the ordinance was replaced by the Northwest Ordinance of 1789, in which the new Congress (under the present Constitution) reaffirmed the Ordinance with slight modifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Horsman|first1=Reginald|title=The Northwest Ordinance and the Shaping of an Expanding Republic|journal=The Wisconsin Magazine of History|date=Autumn 1989|volume=73|issue=1|pages=21–32|jstor=4636235|publisher=[[Wisconsin Historical Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The territory itself remained in existence until 1803, when the southeastern portion of it was admitted to the Union as the State of [[Ohio]], and the remainder was reorganized.

While the articles of Confederation were in effect, the Congress considered various ordinances admitting particular new states into the Union, none of which were approved:

* On August 20, 1781, Congress passed a resolution stating conditions under which the [[Vermont Republic]] (at the time a ''[[de facto]]'' but unrecognized [[sovereign state]]) could enter the Union. It needed only to give up its claims to territory west of [[Lake Champlain]] and east of the [[Connecticut River]].&lt;ref name="Mello"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mello|first=Robert A.|title=Moses Robinson and the Founding of Vermont|publisher=Vermont Historical Society|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The following February, the legislature of Vermont agreed to those terms.  However, Vermont's admission would be delayed for nearly a decade, due largely to opposition from New York, which asserted a disputed claim to the region.

* On May 16, 1785, a resolution to admit [[State of Franklin|Frankland]] (later modified to Franklin) to the Union was introduced in Congress. Eventually, seven states voted to admit what would have been the 14th state. This was, however, less than the nine states required by the Articles of Confederation. The would-be state was located in what is today [[Eastern Tennessee]], and within the territory west of the [[Appalachian Mountains]] that had been offered by [[North Carolina]] as a cession to Congress to help pay off debts related to the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]]. It continued to exist as an ''extra-legal'' state through mid-1788, when North Carolina reassumed full sovereignty over the area. In 1790, when North Carolina again ceded the region, the area that comprised Franklin became part of the [[Southwest Territory]], the precursor to the state of Tennessee.

* In July, 1788, Congress began deliberations on whether to admit [[Kentucky]] to the Union.&lt;ref name="Kesavan"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vasan|first=Kesavan|title=When did the Articles of Confederation Cease to Be Law?|journal=[[Notre Dame Law Review]]|volume=78|issue=1|date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kentucky was then a part of [[Virginia]].  The legislature of Virginia had consented to the creation of the new state from its western district. However, when Congress began to discuss the matter, they received notification that [[New Hampshire]] had ratified the Constitution, becoming the ninth state to do so, causing it to go into effect in the ratifying states. Congress instead passed a resolution stating that it was "unadvisable" to admit a new state under those circumstances and the matter should wait until the federal government under the Constitution came into existence.

===1787 Constitutional Convention===
At the 1787 [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]], a proposal to include the phrase, "new States shall be admitted on the same terms with the original States",  in the ''new states'' clause was defeated. That proposal would have taken the policy articulated in the Ordinance of 1784 and made it a constitutional imperative. Many delegates objected to including the phrase however, fearing that the political power of future new western states would ultimately overwhelm that of the established eastern states.

Delegates, understanding that the number of states would inevitably increase,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Madison Debates, July 23, 1787|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/debates_723.asp|publisher=Lillian Goldman Law Library, Yale Law School|location=New Haven, Connecticut|accessdate=August 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; did agree to include wording into this clause to preclude formation of a new state out of an established one without the consent of the established state as well as the Congress.&lt;ref name=4.3.1/&gt; It was anticipated that Kentucky (which was a part of Virginia), Franklin (which was a part of North Carolina, and later became part of the [[Southwest Territory]]), Vermont (to which New York asserted a disputed claim), and Maine (which was a part of Massachusetts), would become states. As a result of this compromise, new breakaway states are permitted to join the Union, but only with the proper consents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Kesavan| first1=Vasan| last2=Paulsen| first2=Michael Stokes| date=March 2002| title=Is West Virginia Unconstitutional?| url=https://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1423&amp;context=californialawreview| journal=[[California Law Review]]| publisher=[[University of California, Berkeley, School of Law]]| volume=90| issue=2| page=395| accessdate=March 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equal footing doctrine==
Shortly after the new Constitution went into effect Congress admitted [[Vermont]] and Kentucky on equal terms with the existing 13 states, and thereafter formalized the condition in its [[Act of Congress|acts]] of admission for subsequent states. Thus the Congress, utilizing the discretion allowed by the framers, adopted a policy of equal status for all newly admitted states.&lt;ref name=4.3.1/&gt; The constitutional principle derived from these actions is known as the [[equal footing]] doctrine. With the growth of [[states' rights]] advocacy during the [[antebellum period]], the Supreme Court asserted, in ''Lessee of Pollard v. Hagan'' (1845), that the Constitution mandated admission of new states on the basis of equality.&lt;ref name=DEoS/&gt;

==Admission process==
[[File:US states by date of statehood3.gif|thumb|350px|The order in which the original 13 states ratified the constitution, then the order in which the others were admitted to the union.]]
Historically, most new states brought into being by Congress have been established from an organized incorporated U.S. territory, created and governed by Congress in accord with its [[plenary power]] under Article IV, Section 3, [[Article Four of the United States Constitution#Clause 2: Property Clause|Clause 2]] of the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Property and Territory: Powers of Congress|url=https://law.justia.com/constitution/us/article-4/18-methods-of-disposing-of-property.html|website=Justia.com|location=Mountain View, California|accessdate=April 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, an entire territory became a state; in others some part of a territory became a state. In most cases, the organized government of a territory made known the sentiment of its population in favor of statehood, usually by referendum. Congress then directed that government to organize a [[constitutional convention (political meeting)|constitutional convention]] to write a [[State constitution (United States)|state constitution]]. Upon acceptance of that constitution, by the people of the territory and then by Congress, Congress would adopt a [[joint resolution]] granting statehood and the President would issue a proclamation announcing that a new state has been added to the Union. While Congress, which has ultimate authority over the admission of new states, has usually followed this procedure, there have been occasions (due to unique case-specific circumstances) where it did not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Huddle| first=F. P.| date=1946| title=Admission of new states| work=Editorial research reports| publisher=[[CQ Press]]| url=http://library.cqpress.com/cqresearcher/document.php?id=cqresrre1946032000| accessdate=May 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Congress is under no obligation to admit states, even in those areas whose population expresses a desire for statehood. In one instance, [[Mormon pioneers]] in [[Salt Lake City]] sought to establish the state of [[State of Deseret|Deseret]] in 1849. It existed for slightly over two years and was never approved by the [[United States Congress]]. In another, leaders of the [[Five Civilized Tribes]] (Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek, and Seminole) in [[Indian Territory]] proposed to establish the state of [[State of Sequoyah|Sequoyah]] in 1905, as a means to retain control of their lands.&lt;ref name="museum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumoftheredriver.org/choctaw.html |title=Museum of the Red River – The Choctaw |year=2005 |accessdate=4 August 2009 |publisher=Museum of the Red River |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615223442/http://www.museumoftheredriver.org/choctaw.html |archivedate=15 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed constitution ultimately failed in the U.S. Congress. Instead, the Indian Territory was incorporated into the new state of [[Oklahoma]] in 1907.

Some U.S. territories existed only a short time before becoming states, while others remained territories for decades. The shortest-lived was [[Alabama Territory]] at 2 years, while [[New Mexico Territory|New Mexico]] and [[Hawaii Territory|Hawaii]] territories both were in existence for more than 50 years. The entry of several states into the Union has been delayed due to complicating factors. Among them, [[Michigan Territory]], which petitioned Congress for statehood in 1835, was not admitted to the Union until 1837, due to [[Toledo War|a boundary dispute]] with the adjoining state of Ohio. The [[Republic of Texas]] requested annexation to the United States in 1837, but fears about potential conflict with Mexico delayed the admission of Texas for nine years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Richard Bruce |last= Winders |title= Crisis in the Southwest: the United States, Mexico, and the Struggle over Texas |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=mcc9EciebFYC |year= 2002 |publisher= Rowman &amp; Littlefield |isbn= 978-0-8420-2801-1 |pages= [https://books.google.com/books?id=mcc9EciebFYC&amp;pg=PA82 82], [https://books.google.com/books?id=mcc9EciebFYC&amp;pg=PA92 92] |via= [[Google Books]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, statehood for [[Kansas Territory]] was held up for several years (1854–61) due to a series of internal [[Bleeding Kansas|violent conflicts]] involving [[Free-Stater (Kansas)|anti-slavery]] and [[Border Ruffian|pro-slavery]] factions.

Once established, most state borders have, with few exceptions, been generally stable. Notable exceptions include: the various portions (the Western land claims) of several original states ceded over a period of several years to the federal government, which in turn became the Northwest Territory, [[Southwest Territory]], and [[Mississippi Territory]]; the 1791 cession by Maryland and Virginia of land to create the [[District of Columbia]] (Virginia's portion was [[District of Columbia retrocession|returned]] in 1847); and the creation, on at least three separate occasions, of a new state ([[Kentucky]], [[Maine]] and [[West Virginia]]) from a region of an existing state (Vermont was created from what was disputedly claimed to be a part of New York and was not admitted until New York consented); two large additions to [[Nevada]], which became a state in 1864, were made in 1866 and 1867. However, there have been numerous minor adjustments to state boundaries over the years due to improved surveys, resolution of ambiguous or disputed boundary definitions, or minor mutually agreed boundary adjustments for administrative convenience or other purposes.&lt;ref name=StatesShapes&gt;{{cite book |last= Stein |first= Mark |title= How the States Got Their Shapes |year= 2008 |publisher= HarperCollins |location= New York |isbn= 9780061431395 |pages= xvi, 334}}&lt;/ref&gt; One notable example is the case ''[[New Jersey v. New York]]'', in which [[New Jersey]] won roughly 90% of [[Ellis Island]] from [[New York (state)|New York]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Linda |last=  Greenhouse |date= May 27, 1998 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/27/nyregion/ellis-island-verdict-ruling-high-court-gives-new-jersey-most-ellis-island.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm |title=The Ellis Island Verdict: The Ruling; High Court Gives New Jersey Most of Ellis Island |work= [[The New York Times]] |accessdate= August 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==States that were never part of an organized U.S. territory==
[[File:USA states never territories.svg|thumb|350px|U.S. states that were never part of an organized territory.]]
In addition to the original 13, six subsequent states were never part of an organized incorporated U.S. territory.

California was set off from [[unorganized territory|unorganized]] land [[Mexican Cession|ceded]] to the United States by [[Mexico]] in 1848 at the end of the [[Mexican–American War]].

'''Asian Hispanic and Latino Americans''' are [[Hispanic and Latino Americans]] having [[Asian people|Asian]] ancestry and for those Hispanics who consider themselves or were officially classified by the [[United States Census Bureau]], [[Office of Management and Budget]], and other U.S. government agencies as [[Asian Americans]].

[[Hispanicity]], which is independent of race, is the only ethnic category, as opposed to racial category, which is officially unified by the U.S. Census Bureau. The distinction made by government agencies for those within the population of any official race category, including "Asian American", is between those who report Hispanic or Latino ethnic backgrounds and all others who do not. In the case of Asian Americans, these two groups are respectively termed '''Asian Hispanics''' and '''non-Hispanic Asian Americans''', the former being those who say Asian ancestry from [[Hispanic America|Spanish-speaking Latin America]], and the latter consisting of an ethnically diverse collection of all others who are classified as Asian Americans that do not report Hispanic ethnic backgrounds.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13522">[[Image:Hamlet Q1 Frontispiece 1603.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Hamlet Q1]] (1603), the first published text of ''Hamlet'', is often described as a "bad quarto".]]
A '''bad quarto''', in Shakespearean scholarship, is a [[book size|quarto-sized]] publication of one of [[Shakespeare]]'s plays that is considered spurious, [[pirated]] from a theatre without permission by someone in the audience writing it down as it was spoken or written down later by an actor or group of actors, which, according to a theory, has been termed "[[memorial reconstruction]]". Since the quarto derives from performance and lacks a direct link to the author's original manuscript, the text would be expected to contain corruptions, abridgements and paraphrasings.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, Harold. "Introduction". Shakespeare, William.  ''Hamlet''. Arden Shakespeare (1982) {{ISBN|1-903436-67-2}}. p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Duthie 1-4"&gt;Duthie, George Ian. "Introduction; the good and bad quartos". ''The Bad Quarto of Hamlet''. CUP Archive (1941). pp. 1-4&lt;/ref&gt;

That is in contrast to a "good quarto", which is considered to be a text that is authorised, one that may have been printed from the author's manuscript, or a scribal copy or prompt copy that is based on the author's manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;Duthie, George Ian. "Introduction; the good and bad quartos". ''The Bad Quarto of Hamlet''. CUP Archive (1941). pp. 5-9&lt;/ref&gt; "Bad quartos" are considered to include the first quartos of ''Romeo and Juliet'', ''Henry V'', ''The Merry Wives of Windsor'', and ''Hamlet''.&lt;ref name="Duthie 1-4"/&gt;

The concept has expanded to include quartos of plays by other Elizabethan authors, including Peele's ''[[The Battle of Alcazar (play)|The Battle of Alcazar]]'', [[Robert Greene (dramatist)|Greene's]] ''Orlando Furioso'', and the collaborative script, ''[[Sir Thomas More (play)|Sir Thomas More]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Erne, Lukas.  ''Shakespeare as Literary Dramatist''. Cambridge University Press. (2013) {{ISBN|9781107029651}} p. 223&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maguire, Laurie E.  ''Shakespearean Suspect Texts: The 'Bad' Quartos and Their Contexts.'' Cambridge University Press (1996), {{ISBN|9780521473644}}, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

Jonathan Bate states that "late twentieth- and early twenty-first century scholars have begun to question the whole edifice".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.playshakespeare.com/library/misc-documents/33-case-for-the-folio-jonathan-bate Bate, Jonathan. "The Case for the Folio"]. (2007) Playshakespeare.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of bad quarto theory==
The concept of the "bad quarto" as a category of text was created by bibliographer [[Alfred W. Pollard]] in his book ''Shakespeare Folios and Quartos'' (1909).  The idea came to him in his reading of the address by the editors, [[John Heminges]] and [[Henry Condell]], which appears at the beginning of Shakespeare's First Folio and is titled, "To the Great Variety of Readers". Heminges and Condell refer to "diuerse stolne, and surreptitious copies" of the plays. It had been thought that that reference was generally to quarto editions of the plays.

Pollard, however, claims that Heminges and Condell meant to refer only to "bad" quartos, and Pollard lists as "bad" the first quartos of ''Romeo and Juliet'' (1597), ''Henry V'' (1600), ''The Merry Wives of Windsor'' (1602), ''Hamlet'' (1603), and ''Pericles'' (1609). Pollard pointed out that not only the texts contained "badness" but also there was badness in those who pirated the plays.&lt;ref&gt;De Grazia, Margreta. "The essential Shakespeare and the material book." Orgel, Stephe and others, editors. ''Shakespeare and the Literary Tradition''. Courier Corporation (1999) {{ISBN|9780815329671}}, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholar [[W. W. Greg]] worked closely with Pollard and published the bad quarto of ''The Merry Wives of Windsor'',&lt;ref&gt;Greg, W. W. editor. [http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001373658 ''Shakespeare's Merry Wives of Windsor''], 1602. Oxford; At the Clarendon Press (1910)&lt;/ref&gt; which is a work that is significant in the history of the "bad quarto" theory. Greg described how the text may have been copied, and he identified the actor who played the role of "Host" as the culprit. Greg called the process that the actor may have used "[[memorial reconstruction]]", a phrase later used by other scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Pollard, Alfred W. ''Shakespeare folios and quartos: a study in the bibliography of Shakespeare's plays'', 1594–1685. University of Michigan Library (1909).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erne, Lukas. ''Shakespeare as Literary Dramatist''. Cambridge University Press (2013) {{ISBN|9781107029651}}. p. 221&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Bad quarto, good quarto, first folio.png|thumb|320px|Comparison of the "To be, or not to be" soliloquy in the first three editions of Hamlet]]

For Shakespeare, the [[First Folio]] of 1623 is the crucial document; of the 36 plays contained in that collection, 18 have no other source. The other 18 plays had been printed in [[Quarto (text)|quarto]] form at least once between 1594 and 1623, but since the prefatory matter in the First Folio itself warns against earlier texts, which are termed "stol'n and surreptitious copies, maimed and deformed by frauds and stealths of injurious impostors", 18th- and 19th-century editors of Shakespeare tended to ignore the quarto texts and preferred the Folio.

It was at first suspected that the bad quarto texts represented [[shorthand]] reporting, a practice mentioned by [[Thomas Heywood]] in the Prologue to his 1605 play ''If You Know Not Me, You Know Nobody''; reporters would surreptitiously take down a play's text in shorthand during a performance and pirate a popular play for a competing interest. Greg and R. C. Rhodes argued instead for an alternative theory: since some of the minor speeches varied less than those of major characters, their hypothesis was that the actors who played the minor roles had [[memorial reconstruction|reconstructed the play texts from memory]] and gave an accurate report of the parts that they themselves had memorized and played but a less correct report of the other actors' parts.

The idea caught on among Shakespeare scholars. Peter Alexander added ''The First Part of the Contention Betwixt the Two Famous Houses of York and Lancaster'' (1594) and ''The True Tragedy of Richard Duke of York'' (1595), the earliest versions of ''[[Henry VI, Part 2]]'' and ''[[Henry VI, Part 3]],'' to the roster of bad quartos; they had been previously thought to be source plays for Shakespeare's later versions of the same stories. The concept of the bad quarto was extended to play texts by authors other than Shakespeare, and by the second half of the 20th century, the idea was widely being used.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, ''Shakespeare Companion'', p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the end of the century, dissenting views had been published, such as the work of Laurie Maguire, then at the [[University of Ottawa]].

==Criticism and alternative hypotheses==
Some problems exist with the bad quarto hypothesis. The first quarto of [[Richard III (play)|''Richard III'']] is considered a bad quarto "even though it is an unusually 'good' bad quarto".&lt;ref&gt;Evans, ''Riverside Shakespeare,'' p. 754.&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander himself recognised that the idea of memorial reconstruction did not apply perfectly to the two plays that he studied, which possessed problematical features that could not be explained. He maintained that the quartos of the two early histories were "partial" memorial reconstructions.

Some critics, including [[Eric Sams]] and [[Hardin Craig]], dispute the entire concept of memorial reconstruction by pointing out that unlike shorthand reporting, no reliable historical evidence exists that actors reconstructed plays from memory. They believe that memorial reconstruction is a modern fiction. Individual scholars have sometimes preferred alternative explanations for variant texts such as revision. Steven Urkowitz has argued the hypothesis that ''[[King Lear]]'' is a revised work in ''Shakespeare's Revision of "King Lear"''. Some scholars have argued that the more challenging plays of the Shakespearean canon, like ''[[All's Well That Ends Well]]'' and ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]'', make sense as works that Shakespeare wrote at one time and later revised.

Steven Roy Miller considers a revision hypothesis in preference to a bad-quarto hypothesis for ''The Taming of a Shrew'', the alternative version of Shakespeare's ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]].''&lt;ref&gt;Miller, pp. 6–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Burkhart's 1975 study ''Shakespeare's Bad Quartos: Deliberate Abridgements Designed for Performance by a Reduced Cast'' provides another alternative to the hypothesis of bad quartos as memorial reconstruction. Other studies have questioned the "orthodox view" on bad quartos, as in David Farley-Hills's work on ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''.

==Maguire study==
In 1996, Laurie Maguire of the Department of English at the University of Ottawa published a study&lt;ref&gt;Maguire, L. ''Shakespeare's Suspect Texts: the 'Bad' Quartos and their context'' Cambridge Univ Press (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; of the concept of memorial reconstruction, based on the analysis of errors made by actors taking part in the [[BBC TV]] Shakespeare series, broadcast in the early 1980s. She found that actors typically add, drop or invert single words. However, the larger-scale errors that would be expected if actors were attempting to piece together the plays some time after their performance failed to appear in all but a few of the bad quartos. The study, however, uncovered some circumstantial evidence for memorial reconstruction in the bad quartos of ''[[Hamlet]]'', ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]'' and ''[[Pericles, Prince of Tyre|Pericles]]''. According to Maguire, virtually all the bad quartos appear to be accurate renditions of original texts that "merit our attention as valid texts in their own right".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in ''The Sunday Telegraph'', 17 March 1996, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Of other playwrights==
Though the bad quarto concept originated in reference to Shakespearean texts, scholars have also applied it to non-Shakespearean play texts of the [[English Renaissance]] era. In 1938, Leo Kirschbaum published "A Census of Bad Quartos" and included 20 play texts.&lt;ref&gt;Maguire, pp. 85–6.&lt;/ref&gt; Maguire's 1996 study examined 41 Shakespearean and non-Shakespearean editions that have been categorised as bad quartos, including the first editions of ''[[Arden of Feversham]]'', ''[[The Merry Devil of Edmonton]]'', and ''[[Fair Em]]'', plays of the [[Shakespeare Apocrypha]], plus [[George Chapman]]'s ''[[The Blind Beggar of Alexandria]]'', [[Christopher Marlowe]]'s ''[[Doctor Faustus (play)|Doctor Faustus]]'' and ''[[The Massacre at Paris]]'', ''Part 1'' of Heywood's ''[[If You Know Not Me, You Know Nobody]]'' and [[Beaumont and Fletcher]]'s ''[[The Maid's Tragedy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Maguire, pp. 227–321.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West''''' is a 1970 book by American writer [[Dee Brown (writer)|Dee Brown]] that covers the history of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] in the [[American West]] in the late nineteenth century. The book expresses details of the history of American expansionism from a point of view that is critical of its effects on the Native Americans. Brown describes Native Americans' displacement through forced relocations and years of [[American Indian Wars|warfare]] waged by the [[United States federal government]]. The government's dealings are portrayed as a continuing effort to destroy the culture, religion, and way of life of Native American peoples.&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite book|title=Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee|last=Brown|first=Dee|authorlink=Dee Brown (writer)|publisher=[[Henry Holt and Company|Henry Holt and Company, LLC]]|location=New York City|year=2007|isbn=0-03-085322-2|oclc=110210}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Helen Hunt Jackson]]'s ''[[A Century of Dishonor]]'' is often considered a nineteenth-century precursor to Dee Brown's writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[A Century of Dishonor|A Century of Dishonor: A Sketch of the United States Government's Dealings with Some of the Indian Tribes]]|last=Jackson|first=Helen Hunt|authorlink=Helen Hunt Jackson|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|location=Cambridge|year=1985|isbn=978-1-4209-4438-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the publication of ''Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee,'' Dee Brown had become well versed in the history of the [[American frontier]]. Having grown up in [[Arkansas]], he developed a keen interest in the American West, and during his graduate education at [[George Washington University]] and his career as a librarian for both the [[US Department of Agriculture]] and the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]], he wrote numerous books on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview|url=http://www.stgsigma.org/images/A%20TALK%20WITH%20DEE%20BROWN.doc|title=A Talk with Dee Brown|last=Brown|first=Dee|subjectlink=Dee Brown (writer)|interviewer=Dale L. Walker|work=Louis L'Amour Western Magazine|format=DOC|date=Jan 1995|via=www.stgsigma.org}} (Interview conducted in Fall 1994.)&lt;/ref&gt; Brown's works maintained a focus on the American West, but ranged anywhere from western fiction to histories to even children's books. Many of Brown's books revolved around similar Native American topics, including his ''Showdown at Little Bighorn'' (1964) and ''The Fetterman Massacre'' (1974).&lt;ref name="arkansas"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=1086|title=Dee Brown (1908–2002)|work=[[Encyclopedia of Arkansas History &amp; Culture]]|date=5 Oct 2015|accessdate=9 Apr 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee'' was first published in 1970 to generally strong reviews. Published at a time of increasing [[American Indian Movement|American Indian activism]], the book has never gone out of print and has been translated into 17 languages.&lt;ref name="Momaday"&gt;{{cite news|title=A History of the Indians of the United States|last=Momaday|first=N. Scott|authorlink=N. Scott Momaday|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|location=New York City|page=BR46|date=7 Mar 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title is taken from the final phrase of a twentieth-century poem titled "American Names" by [[Stephen Vincent Benet]]. The full quotation – "I shall not be there. I shall rise and pass. Bury my heart at Wounded Knee." – appears at the beginning of Brown's book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/american-names|title=American Names|last=Benét|first=Stephen Vincent|authorlink=Stephen Vincent Benét|website=poets.org|date=1927|accessdate=6 Jan 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Benet's poem is not about the plight of Native Americans, [[Wounded Knee Battlefield|Wounded Knee]] was the location of the last major confrontation between the [[US Army]] and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]]. It is also the vicinity of where [[Crazy Horse]]'s parents buried his heart and some of his bones after his murder in 1877.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Synopsis==
In the first chapter, Brown presents a brief history of the discovery and settlement of America, from 1492 to the Indian turmoil that began in 1860. He stresses the initially gentle and peaceable behavior of Indians toward Europeans, especially given their apparent lack of resistance to early colonial efforts at [[Europeanisation|Europeanization]]. It was not until the further influx of European settlers, gradual encroachment, and eventual seizure of American lands by the "white man" that the Native people were shown to exhibit forms of major resistance.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;{{rp|1–12}}

Brown completes his initial overview by briefly describing incidents up to 1860 that involve American encroachment and [[Indian removal]], beginning with the defeat of the [[Wampanoags]] and [[Narragansetts]], [[Iroquois]], and [[Cherokee]] Nations, as well as the establishment of the West as the "permanent Indian frontier" and the ultimate breaches of the frontier as a means to achieve [[Manifest Destiny]].&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;{{rp|3–12}}

In each of the following chapters, Brown provides an in-depth description of a significant post-1860 event in American Western expansion or Native American eradication, focusing in turn on the specific tribe or tribes involved in the event. In his narrative, Brown primarily discusses such tribes as the [[Navajo Nation]], [[Santee Dakota]], [[Hunkpapa Lakota]], [[Oglala Lakota]], [[Cheyenne people|Cheyenne]], and [[Apache]] people. He touches more lightly upon the subjects of the [[Arapaho people|Arapaho]], [[Modoc people|Modoc]], [[Kiowa people|Kiowa]], [[Comanche]], [[Nez Perce people|Nez Perce]], [[Ponca tribe|Ponca]], [[Ute people|Ute]], and [[Minneconjou Lakota]] tribes.

===Navajo===
Brown discusses the plights of [[Manuelito]] and the [[Navajo people|Navajo]] people in [[New Mexico]], who make treaties and other efforts to maintain peace with Euro-Americans despite their encroachment upon Navajo land, stealing livestock and burning entire villages as punishment for perceived misbehavior. The second, third and fourth generation European immigrants occupy land in Navajo country not only to build their own forts, the first of which was [[Fort Defiance, Arizona|Fort Defiance]], but also claim rights to the surrounding prized Navajo lands as pasture for their livestock. Various disputes occur between the Navajo and the Euro-Americans, culminating in a horse race between Manuelito and a US Army lieutenant who wins as a result of dishonesty and trickery. The consequence is a massacre of Navajo bystanders.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;{{rp|14–20}}

The US Army General [[James Carleton]] orders the Navajos to relocate to a reservation at [[Bosque Redondo]], where the Apaches had recently been moved, but is met with resistance. Employing a [[Scorched earth policy|scorched-earth campaign]], [[Kit Carson]] and Carleton force a large majority of resistant Navajos and Apaches to surrender and flee to the reservation. Manuelito and a few other Navajo leaders refuse to surrender but finally agree to [[Long Walk of the Navajo|relocate to the Bosque]] in 1866 "for the sake of the women and children", signing a peace treaty on June 1, 1868.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;{{rp|23–36}}

===Sioux===

====Santee Dakota====
The narrative of the Sioux begins with Brown's discussion of the [[Santee Dakota]] tribe.  Following a poor harvest and lack of promised support from the US government in the early 1860s, members of the tribe became angry at white people. After the murder of several white men and women by young Dakota, the frustrated Santee tribe, led by [[Chief Little Crow]], attacked [[Fort Ridgely]] and a nearby town. When the Santees refuse to surrender their white hostages to Colonel [[Henry Hastings Sibley|Sibley]], they are forced into battle again at [[Yellow Medicine River]]. The Santees lose and over three dozen Santee warriors are executed in December 1862. Santee chiefs, including Chief Little Crow, were killed during the following six months, and the remaining Santees are removed to a Missouri River and Crow Creek reservation.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;{{rp|37–65}}

====Oglala Lakota====
Brown's discussion of the [[Oglala Lakota]] begins with the US Army's 1865 invasion of the [[Powder River country]] in Montana. The army is confronted with opposition from the local Lakota and [[Cheyenne people|Cheyenne tribes]]. This and other skirmishes result in heated conflict between the US Army and the Oglala Lakotas led by Chiefs [[Red Cloud]] and [[Roman Nose]], forcing the US Army to retreat for the winter. The high death toll among US troops fostered great confidence in the Native Americans who began a journey to the [[Black Hills]].&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;{{rp|101–119}}

By the US Army's request, the Sioux chiefs and approximately 2000 other warriors arrived at [[Fort Laramie]] in May 1866 for treaty talks. The tribes quickly learned of the army's intent to build roads and railroads through Sioux land. As construction progresses, the Sioux plan an attack on the white men and harass white traffic through the Powder River country. Red Cloud unknowingly leads approximately 3,000 Lakota into an ambush, later called the [[Fetterman Massacre]], at Peno Creek where 81 white men and 200 Lakotas are killed. Conflict continues between the US Army and the Lakota for years despite peace commissioners being sent to Powder River to address differences. In 1868 the US Army retreats upon the signing of the [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868)|peace treaty]] with Red Cloud.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;{{rp|120–146}}

In 1869 Red Cloud is invited to Washington D.C. to speak with [[Donehogawa]], a member of the Iroquois tribe who is serving as the Commissioner of Indian Affairs in the US government. Chief Red Cloud and his tribe members express their discontent with the 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie which defined their reservation land as bordered by the [[Missouri River]] rather than the Powder River. Commissioner Donehogawa corrected this mistake by declaring the Powder River country as reserved for Lakota hunting grounds. Donehogawa's agency was later accused of being like a "savage Indian" and the agency was unable to purchase supplies for the reservations.  Donehogawa was subsequently forced to resign his commission.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;{{rp|175–190}}

In 1874, when rumors of gold in the Black Hills were delivered by [[Custer]] and his men to the white settlers on the plains, miners and panhandlers flooded the Black Hills, angering the Lakota and Dakota living there. A peace council in 1875 tried to arrange for the US government to either purchase the mineral rights or outright ownership of the Black Hills, but both proposals were rejected by the Sioux. In 1876, a [[Black Hills War|series of battles]] occur between the Sioux and US troops which initially ends when the Sioux defeat General Custer and his troops at the [[Battle of Little Bighorn]] on June 25. The humiliated US Army sends a peace council to sign a treaty that forces the Sioux out of the Black Hills to the Missouri River. The troops follow this treaty with numerous attacks on Lakota villages.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;{{rp|273–313}}

====Hunkpapa and Minneconjou Lakota====
Following the removal of the Lakota from the Black Hills to the Missouri River Reservation, [[Sitting Bull]], in exile in Canada and participating in unsuccessful peace talks, returns to American soil and surrenders at [[Fort Buford]]. He is removed to the [[Hunkpapa]] reservation at [[Standing Rock]]; he subsequently joins [[Buffalo Bill]]'s [[Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show|Wild West Show]]. The Lakota were ultimately forced to sign a treaty in 1890 that further divided and limited their reservation.

Sitting Bull is later arrested in an attempt by US authorities to suppress Sitting Bull's endorsement of the Ghost Dance which they considered a religious disturbance. The two Native American policemen sent to arrest Sitting Bull killed him.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;{{rp|415–438}} Following the death of Sitting Bull, a conflict arose that resulted in the Hunkpapas and Minneconjous tribes fleeing Standing Rock. Deciding against further resistance, the tribes join Red Cloud at [[Pine Ridge Indian Reservation|Pine Ridge]] where they encounter [[Samuel Whitside|Major Whitside]] in late December 1890. The tribes are subsequently directed to [[Wounded Knee Battlefield|Wounded Knee]], where a member of the Minneconjou tribe called [[Black Coyote]] refuses to surrender his rifle. The US Army reacts with violence which results in the deaths of 150–350 Native Americans and 25–31 US Army soldiers. The Lakota that survived the assault fled to Pine Ridge, and returned to Wounded Knee the next day only to bury their families and comrades.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;{{rp|439–445}}

===Cheyenne and Arapaho===
The 1858 [[Pikes Peak]] [[Pikes Peak Gold Rush|gold rush]] in Colorado creates a swarm of white settlers onto Cheyenne and Arapaho lands and instigates treaty talks that result in removal of Cheyenne and Arapaho territory to any area between [[Big Sandy Creek (Colorado)|Sand Creek]] and the [[Arkansas River]]. When the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] brings the US Army into Cheyenne and Arapaho territory, the resulting conflict endorses the murder of "hostile Indians". The Cheyenne tribe responds with numerous strikes on the army outposts.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;{{rp|67–102}}

In early 1866, the Southern Cheyenne [[Dog Soldiers]] are asked to sign the treaty that would relocate them to the south with Black Kettle and his tribe. When they refuse, Roman Nose organizes an attack which is thwarted by the coming of winter. In the following year a peace council is held between the [[General Hancock]]'s army and the Cheyenne which ends when Hancock's army burns the Cheyenne camp to force their cooperation. After a series of retaliatory assaults, a treaty is signed by the Cheyenne, Arapaho, [[Kiowa]], and [[Comanche]] tribes which relocates them to the reservation south of Arkansas River. Roman Nose doesn't sign the treaty. Instead he leads his Dog Soldiers on more war parties and is eventually killed. Generals Custer and [[General Sheridan|Sheridan]] burn Black Kettle's village and the remaining band of Dog Soldiers are killed.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;{{rp|147–174}}

After the surrender and removal, the Northern Cheyenne tribe led by [[Little Wolf]] and [[Dull Knife]] are unable to sustain themselves on the poor land at [[Fort Reno (Oklahoma)|Fort Reno]], and they form a hunting party to hunt buffalo north of their reservation. Their hunt was unsuccessful, and the tribe continues to suffer severe losses due to health problems from malnutrition and a measles epidemic. Chiefs [[Little Wolf]] and [[Dull Knife]] decide to move north but this leads to more violent encounters with the US Army. The tribes are reduced to nearly 10% of their earlier population. Dull Knife and his tribe try to join Red Cloud, and they defy orders to return to their southern, buffalo-depleted reservation. Battles ensue, and Dull Knife's tribe is pursued north until the majority of the tribe are killed. The survivors take refuge at Red Cloud's reservation.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;{{rp|331–349}}

===Apache===
The friendly relations between the Apaches and Euro-Americans, that were once signified by the Apaches allowing white travelers to pass through their land unmolested, began to diminish when Apache Chief [[Cochise]] was imprisoned for allegedly stealing cattle and kidnapping a white boy from a settler's farm. When Cochise escaped, he and his warriors killed three white men, and the army responded by hanging male members of Cochise's family.  Cochise spent the next two years leading attacks on the Euro-Americans. In 1865, after Cochise refuses a treaty designed to relocate his Chiricahua tribe to a reservation, the Apaches successfully avoid contact with white men for a number of years.  But in 1871, a group of settlers, Mexicans, and warriors from competing tribes massacre an Apache village, and Cochise and his followers retreat into the mountains. They stay there until the chief agrees to move the Apache to a reservation in the Chiricahua Mountains in Arizona.  He dies soon thereafter in 1874.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;{{rp|191–217}}

The Apache nation was divided after Cochise's death, and they soon become infamous for raiding white villages. The Chiricahua Apaches, avoiding attempts to relocate to a reservation, flee into Mexico. Victorio and his Warm Springs Apaches are removed to the [[San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation|San Carlos agency]] in southeastern Arizona in 1877. The entire tribe is eventually killed, to stop their raids on white settlers. [[Geronimo]] and his tribe leave their reservation only to return heavily armed and determined to free their fellow Apaches. This results in the stationing of Apache guerillas in Mexico. Negotiations with Geronimo and the guerillas continue over the next few years as alleged stories of the guerillas’ brutalities and atrocities circulate. In 1886, Geronimo flees once again before being incarcerated and transported to a reservation in Florida with the remaining Chiricahua Apaches.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;{{rp|391–413}}

===Modoc===
[[Captain Jack (Native American)|Captain Jack]], the Chief of the [[Modoc people|Modoc]] tribe located in Northern California, is described as a Native American friendly to the "white people" who settled in his country. As larger numbers of settlers trespass onto Modoc land and small disputes arise between the Modocs and white settlers, the US government coerces a treaty, over Captain Jack's reluctance, that will relocate the Modocs to a reservation in [[Oregon]] and shared with the [[Klamath Tribes|Klamaths]]. Conflicts between the two tribes quickly begin, and the Modocs return south to California. Their return is halted by a skirmish between the tribe and an army battalion in 1872, and the Modocs divert to the California lava beds. Another group of Modocs, led by [[Hooker Jim]], murdered 12 white settlers and forced Captain Jack to lead his tribe into a battle against the US Army. A peace commission led by [[Edward Canby|General Canby]], conducts peace talks with Captain Jack who eventually, under pressure from Hooker Jim's Modocs, agrees to kill Canby should the original Modoc land not be returned to the tribe. As feared, Canby refuses to return the land to the Modocs, and he is killed by Captain Jack. Hooker Jim betrays Captain Jack to the army, and he is hanged on October 3, 1873.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;{{rp|224–240}}

===Kiowa and Comanche===
After the [[Battle of Washita]] in 1868, [[General Sheridan]] ordered all tribes involved to surrender at [[Fort Cobb]]; the [[Kiowa]] tribe refused. The Kiowa chiefs are arrested and both the Kiowa and [[Comanche]] people are forced onto the Fort Cobb reservation. The Kiowas and Comanches, led by [[Satanta (White Bear)|Satanta]] and Big Tree, decide to attack the white men, and they kill 7 teamsters. This results in the arrest and imprisonment of both chiefs. Lone Wolf, another Kiowa Chief, arranges for the release of White Bear and Big Tree so they can attend the peace talks at [[Fort Sill]]. In early 1874, while on parole, White Bear and Big Tree lead the Kiowa and Comanche tribes on an attack against white settlers in order to preserve the buffalo. When both tribes flee their reservations, they are hunted down by the US Army. Upon their surrender in early 1875, they are exiled in Florida.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;{{rp|241–271}}

===Nez Percé===
Despite maintaining peaceful relations with whites, the [[Nez Perces]] are forced to sign a treaty in 1863 which removes them to a small reservation in [[Idaho]]. [[Chief Joseph]] and his tribe designated this agreement as the "thief treaty". Being highly offended by the treaty terms, and the sudden influx of gold miners and cattle farmers onto Nez Perce land, the tribe refused to move to the [[Lapwai]] Reservation, choosing instead to fight the US Army at White Bird Canyon in June 1877. After winning that battle, the tribe fled to Montana, trying to join Sitting Bull in Canada, but then they lost the battle at the Bear Paw Mountains in August and were forced to surrender. Some members of the tribe managed to find refuge in Canada, but those that surrendered were split between the Lapwai reservation and the Colville reservation in Washington.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;{{rp|315–3360}}

===Ponca===
Despite having previously signed treaties guaranteeing their ownership of the land on the [[Niobrara River]], the [[Ponca]] land was taken from via a subsequent US treaty and given to the Lakota, Dakota, and Nakota tribes just before they were added to a list of tribes to be exiled to [[Indian Territory]] following Custer's defeat. Ponca [[Chief Standing Bear]] was arrested along with other chiefs for refusing to leave voluntarily. The Ponca tribe was forced onto the [[Quapaw|Quapaw reservation]], where over one quarter of their population died.  Standing Bear returned to the Niobrara and takes his case to a white man's court in 1879 arguing that he is a person protected by the US Constitution. Standing Bear won his case but is informed by General Sherman that the case is specific to him and does not maintain validity for the other Poncas, who were forced to remain in Indian Territory.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;{{rp|351–366}}

===Utes===
The [[Ute people|Utes]] are a Colorado tribe whose land was gradually overrun by mineral and gold miners. [[Chief Ouray]] signed a treaty in 1863 allowing settlers to mine Ute land and relinquishing all mineral rights. He signed another treaty in 1868 that allotted 16 million acres of forests and meadows in the [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]] as a personal reservation that prohibited white trespass. When disputes arose, [[Nathan Meeker]] attempted to [[Cultural assimilation of Native Americans|assimilate]] the Utes into Euro-American culture, but [[William Vickers]] opposed the idea and started "The Utes Must Go!" campaign in 1879. Vickers called on the US cavalry to prevent an uprising by the Utes. The Utes responded by killing all the white men at the [[White River (Green River)|White River]] Indian agency. In 1881, as a result of outrage over the [[White River War|White River Massacre]], the Utes were removed to a marginal reservation in [[Utah]].&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;{{rp|367–389}}

==Historical context==

===American Indian Movement===
''Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee'' was published less than three years following the establishment of AIM, the [[American Indian Movement]], formed in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]] in 1968. AIM moved to promote modern Native American issues and to unite America's dividing Native American population, similar to the [[Civil rights movement|Civil Rights]] and [[Environmental movement|Environmental]] Movements that gained support at that time. The publication of Brown's book came at the height of the American Indian Movement's activism. In 1969, in AIM [[Occupation of Alcatraz|occupied Alcatraz Island]] for 19 months in hopes of reclaiming Native American land after the San Francisco Indian Center burned down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://migizi.org/tasks/sites/default/assets/File/resources/AIM%20History.pdf|title=A Brief History of the American Indian Movement|last1=Wittstock|first1=Laura Waterman|last2=Salinas|first2=Elaine J.|website=migizi.org|publisher=MIGIZI Communications, Inc.|location=Minneapolis|format=PDF|accessdate=9 Apr 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, less than three years after the book's release, AIM and local Oglala and neighboring [[Sicangu Lakota]] took part in a 71-day [[Wounded Knee Incident|occupation at Wounded Knee]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dee Brown, 94, Author Who Revised Image of West|last=Martin|first=Douglas|newspaper=The New York Times|location=New York City|date=14 Dec 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; in protest of the government of Richard Wilson, the chairman of the [[Pine Ridge Indian Reservation]], which resulted in the death of two Indians and injury of the [[US Marshal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usmarshals.gov/history/wounded-knee/|title=History –  Incident at Wounded Knee|website=usmarshals.gov|publisher=[[United States Marshals Service]]|accessdate=6 Jan 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting 1974 trial ended in the dismissal of all charges due to the uncovering of various incidents of government misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=At Wounded Knee, Is It War or PR?|last=Conderacci|first=Greg|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|publisher=[[Dow Jones &amp; Company]]|location=New York City|date=20 Mar 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vietnam War===
At the time of the publication of Brown's book, the United States was engaged in the [[Vietnam War]]. The actions of the United States Army in Vietnam were frequently criticized in the media and critics of Brown's narrative often drew comparisons between its contents and what was seen in the media. The primary comparison made was the similarity between the massacre and [[Native American genocide|atrocities]] against Native Americans in the late nineteenth century as portrayed by Dee Brown's book and the 1968 [[My Lai Massacre|massacre]] of hundreds of civilians in [[Southern Vietnam]] at [[My Lai]] for which twenty-five US Army members were indicted. Native American author [[N. Scott Momaday]], in his review of the narrative, agreed with the viability of the comparison, stating "Having read Mr. Brown, one has a better understanding of what it is that nags at the American conscience at times (to our everlasting credit) and of that morality which informs and fuses events so far apart in time and space as the massacres at Wounded Knee and My Lai."&lt;ref name="Momaday"/&gt; Thirty years later, in the foreword of a modern printing of the book by [[Hampton Sides]], it is argued that My Lai had a powerful impact on the success of Brown's narrative, as "''Bury My Heart'' landed on America's doorstep in the anguished midst of the Vietnam War, shortly after revelations of the My Lai massacre had plunged the nation into gnawing self-doubt. Here was a book filled with a hundred My Lais, a book that explored the dark roots of American arrogance while dealing a near-deathblow to our fondest folk myth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee|last=Sides|first=Hampton|publisher=[[Henry Holt and Company|Henry Holt and Company, LLC]]|location=New York City|pages=391–413|year=2007|isbn=0-03-085322-2|oclc=110210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception of the book==
''Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee'' received ultimately positive reviews upon its publication. ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' magazine reviewed the book saying: "In the last decade or so, after almost a century of saloon art and horse operas that romanticized Indian fighters and white settlers, Americans have been developing a reasonably acute sense of the injustices and humiliations suffered by the Indians. But the details of how the West was won are not really part of the American consciousness ... Dee Brown, Western historian and head librarian at the [[University of Illinois]], now attempts to balance the account. With the zeal of an IRS investigator, he audits US history's forgotten set of books. Compiled from old but rarely exploited sources plus a fresh look at dusty Government documents, ''Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee'' tallies the broken promises and treaties, the provocations, massacres, discriminatory policies and condescending diplomacy."&lt;ref name=time-review&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,909793,00.html|title=The Forked-Tongue Syndrome|last=Sheppard|first=R.Z.|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|location=New York City|date=1 Feb 1971|accessdate=1 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pulitzer-Prize winning Native American author [[N. Scott Momaday]] noted the book contains strong documentation of original sources, such as council records and firsthand descriptions. Stating that "it is, in fact, extraordinary on several accounts," he further compliments Brown's writing by saying that "the book is a story, whole narrative of singular integrity and precise continuity; that is what makes the book so hard to put aside, even when one has come to the end."&lt;ref name="Momaday"/&gt;

[[Peter Farb]] reviewed the book in 1971, in the ''[[New York Review of Books]]'', writing "The Indian wars were shown to be the dirty murders they were."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Indian Corn|first=Peter|last=Farb|authorlink=Peter Farb|work=[[The New York Review of Books]]|location=New York City|date=16 Dec 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other critics could not believe that the book was not written by a Native American and that Dee Brown was a white man, as the book's Native perspective felt so real.&lt;ref name="arkansas"/&gt; Remaining on bestseller lists for over a year following its release in hardback, the book remains in print 40 years later. Translated into at least 17 languages, it has sold nearly four million copies and remains popular today.

Despite the book's widespread acceptance by journalists and the general public, scholars such as [[Francis Paul Prucha]] criticized it for lacking sources for much of the material, except for direct quotations; he said that content was selected to present a particular point of view, rather than to be balanced, and that the narrative of government-Indian relations suffered from not being placed within the perspective of what else was occurring within the government and the country at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Prucha|first=Francis Paul|title=''Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee'', Review|journal=The American Historical Review|publisher=[[American Historical Association]]|location=Washington, D.C.|volume=77|number=2|pages= 589–590|date=Apr 1972|doi=10.2307/1868839}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brown was candid about his intention to present the history of the settlement of the West from the point of view of the Indians - "its victims," as he wrote. He noted, "Americans who have always looked westward when reading about this period should read this book facing eastward."&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;{{rp|xvi}}

==Adaptations==

===Film===
[[HBO Films]] produced a made-for-television [[Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee (film)|film adaptation]] by the same title of the Brown's book for the [[HBO]] television network. The film stars [[Adam Beach]], [[Aidan Quinn]], [[Anna Paquin]], and [[August Schellenberg]] with a cameo appearance by actor and former US Senator [[Fred Thompson]] as [[Ulysses S. Grant|President Grant]]. It debuted on the HBO television network Sunday, May 27, 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0821638/|title=Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee|website=imdb.com|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]''|accessdate=9 Apr 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and covers roughly the last two chapters of Brown's book, focusing on the narrative of the Lakota tribes leading up to the death of Sitting Bull and the Massacre at Wounded Knee.&lt;ref&gt;Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee, directed by Yves Simoneau (2007; Calgary, Alberta, Canada: HBO Films, 2007.), DVD.&lt;/ref&gt; The film received 17 [[Primetime Emmy]] nominations and went on to win six awards, including the category of [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Made for Television Movie|Outstanding Made For Television Movie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/shows/bury-my-heart-wounded-knee|title=Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee|website=emmys.com|accessdate=6 Jan 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also garnered nominations for three [[Golden Globe Awards]], two [[Satellite Awards]], and one [[Screen Actors Guild Award]].

===Children's literature===
Bestselling author of ''Lincoln's Last Days,'' Dwight Jon Zimmerman adapted Brown's book for children in his work entitled ''[https://www.amazon.com/Saga-Sioux-Adaptation-Browns-Wounded/dp/0805093648 The Saga of the Sioux.]'' The narrative deals solely with the Sioux tribe as the representatives of the story told in ''Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee,'' written from the perspective of the Sioux chiefs and warriors from 1860 to the events at the Massacre at Wounded Knee. The book includes copious photographs, illustrations, and maps in support of the narrative and to appeal to its middle school demographic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Saga of the Sioux: An Adaptation from Dee Brown's Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee|last=Zimmerman|first=Dwight J.|publisher=[[Henry Holt and Company|Henry Holt and Company, LLC]]|location=New York City|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Camera obscura''' (plural ''camera obscura'' or ''camera obscuras'';&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/spelling/plurals-of-nouns Oxford English Dictionary. Plurals of foreign nouns]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/249903/plural-of-camera-obscura Stack Exchange: Plural of ''camera obscura'']&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Latin]], meaning "dark room": ''camera'' "(vaulted) chamber or room," and ''obscura'' "darkened, dark"), also referred to as '''pinhole image''', is the natural optical phenomenon that occurs when an image of a scene at the other side of a screen (or for instance a wall) is projected through a small hole in that screen as a reversed and inverted image (left to right and upside down) on a surface opposite to the opening. The surroundings of the projected image have to be relatively dark for the image to be clear, so many historical camera obscura experiments were performed in dark rooms.

The term "camera obscura" also refers to constructions or devices that make use of the principle within a box, tent or room. Camerae obscurae with a lens in the opening have been used since the second half of the 16th century and became popular as an aid for drawing and painting. The camera obscura box was developed further into the [[Camera|photographic camera]] in the first half of the 19th century when camera obscura boxes were used to expose light-sensitive materials to the projected image.

The camera obscura was used as a means to study eclipses, without the risk of damaging the eyes by looking into the sun directly. As a drawing aid, the camera obscura allowed tracing the projected image to produce a highly accurate representation, especially appreciated as an easy way to achieve a proper [[graphical perspective]].

Before the term "camera obscura" was first used in 1604, many other expressions were used including "cubiculum obscurum", "cubiculum tenebricosum", "conclave obscurum" and "locus obscurus".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Optic projection, principles, installation, and use of the magic lantern, projection microscope, reflecting lantern, moving picture machine|year=1914|last=Phelps Gage|first=Henry|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vtFUAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22obscurum+cubiculum%22&amp;dq=%22obscurum+cubiculum%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A camera obscura device without a lens but with a very small hole is sometimes referred to as a "[[pinhole camera]]", although this more often refers to simple (home-made) lens-less cameras in which photographic film or photographic paper is used.

==Physical explanation==
Rays of light travel in straight lines and change when they are reflected and partly absorbed by an object, retaining information about the color and brightness of the surface of that object. Lit objects reflect rays of light in all directions. A small enough opening in a screen only lets through rays that travel directly from different points in the scene on the other side and these rays form an image of that scene when they are collected on a surface opposite the opening. In simple, the way your retina sees a specific image through your eye is vertically switched to the object you see and how pieces in your brain are shown to switch that object right-side up to the way you see normally

The [[human eye]] (as well as those of other animals including birds, fish reptiles  etc.) works much like a camera obscura with an opening ([[pupil]]), a biconvex [[lens (anatomy)|lens]] and a surface where the image is formed ([[retina]]).

==Technology==
[[Image:Camera obscura box.jpg|left|thumb|A diagram of a camera obscura with an upright projected image at the top.]]
A camera obscura device consists of a box, tent or room with a small hole in one side. Light from an external scene passes through the hole and strikes a surface inside, where the scene is reproduced, inverted (thus upside-down) and reversed (left to right), but with color and [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] preserved.  

In order to produce a reasonably clear projected image, the aperture has to be about 1/100th the distance to the screen, or less.

As the pinhole is made smaller, the image gets sharper, but the projected image becomes dimmer. With too small a pinhole, however, the sharpness worsens, due to [[diffraction]].

Many camerae obscurae use a [[Lens (optics)|lens]] rather than a pinhole (as in a [[pinhole camera]]) because it allows a larger [[F-number|aperture]], giving a usable brightness while maintaining focus.

If the image is caught on a semi-transparent screen, it can be viewed from the back so that it is no longer reversed (but still upside-down).

Using mirrors it is possible to project a right-side-up image. The projection can also be diverted onto a horizontal surface (e.g. a table). The 18th-century overhead version in tents used mirrors inside a kind of periscope on the top of the tent . 

The box-type camera obscura often has an angled mirror projecting an upright image onto [[tracing paper]] placed on the glass top. Although the image is viewed from the back, it is now reversed by the mirror.

==History==

===30,000 BCE to 500 BCE: Possible inspiration for prehistoric art and possible use in religious ceremonies, gnomon===
There are theories that occurrences of camera obscura effects (through tiny holes in tents or in screens of animal hide) inspired [[paleolithic]] [[cave painting]]s. Distortions in the shapes of animals in many paleolithic cave artworks might be inspired by distortions seen when the surface on which an image was projected was not straight or not in the right angle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paleo-camera.com/paleolithic/ |title=Paleolithic |publisher=paleo-camera |date= |accessdate=2017-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is also suggested that camera obscura projections could have played a role in [[Neolithic]] structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paleo-camera.com/neolithic/ |title=Neolithic |publisher=paleo-camera |accessdate=2017-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jennifer Ouellette |url=https://gizmodo.com/did-prehistoric-people-watch-the-stars-through-this-6-0-1782759791 |title=deadspin-quote-carrot-aligned-w-bgr-2 |publisher=Gizmodo |date=2016-06-29 |accessdate=2017-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Osservazione del solstizio 21.06.12, fi, 20.JPG|thumb|The gnomon projection on the floor of [[Florence Cathedral]] during the solstice on 21.06.2012]]
Perforated [[gnomon]]s projecting a pinhole image of the sun were described in the Chinese [[Zhoubi Suanjing]] writings (1046 BCE—256 BCE with material added until circa 220 CE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite publication|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CyssAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22pierced+gnomon%22&amp;dq=%22pierced+gnomon%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi87Y3Ex4fSAhXPFsAKHRNaDZEQ6AEIOzAG|title=The Asiatic Review|year=1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; The location of the bright circle can be measured to tell the time of day and year. In Arab and European cultures its invention was much later attributed to Egyptian astronomer and mathematician [[Ibn Yunus]] around 1000 CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=msaqctAH8OkC&amp;lpg=PA6&amp;dq=%22pierced%20gnomon%22&amp;pg=PA6#v=onepage&amp;q=perforated&amp;f=false|title=Sundials: History, Theory, and Practice|last=Rohr|first=René R.J.|year=2012|isbn=9780486151700}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some ancient sightings of gods and spirits, especially in temple worship, are thought to possibly have been conjured up by means of camera obscura projections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paleo-camera.com/ancient-greece/ |title=Ancient Greece |publisher=paleo-camera |date=2010-03-09 |accessdate=2017-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |date= 2004 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=BIL2BgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA15#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title= Ghost Images: Cinema of the Afterlife |last= Ruffles |first=Tom |pages= 15–17|isbn= 9780786420056 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=needham4&gt;{{cite book|last=Needham|first=Joseph|title=Science and Civilization in China, vol.

===500 BCE to 500 CE: Earliest written observations===
[[Image:IMG 1650 zonsverduistering Malta.JPG|thumb|Holes in the leaf canopy project images of a [[solar eclipse]] on the ground.]]
The earliest known written record of the camera obscura is to be found in Chinese writings called [[Mozi (book)|Mozi]] and dated to the 4th century BCE, traditionally ascribed to and named for [[Mozi]] (circa 470 BCE-circa 391 BCE), a [[History of Science and Technology in China|Han Chinese]] philosopher and the founder of [[Mohism|Mohist School of Logic]]. In these writings it is explained how the inverted image in a "collecting-point" or "treasure house"&lt;ref group="note"&gt;In the ''Mozi'' passage, a camera obscura is described as a "collecting-point" or "treasure house" ([[wikt:庫|庫]]); the 18th century scholar Bi Yuan ([[:zh:畢沅|畢沅]]) suggested this was a misprint for "screen" ([[wikt:㢓|㢓]]).&lt;/ref&gt; is inverted by an intersecting point (a pinhole) that collected the (rays of) light. Light coming from the foot of an illuminated person would partly be hidden below (strike below the pinhole) and partly form the top part of the image. Rays from the head would partly be hidden above (strike above the pinhole) and partly form the lower part of the image. This is a remarkably early correct description of the camera obscura; there are no other examples known that are dated before the 11th century.&lt;ref name=needham4/&gt;

The Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]] (384-322 BCE), or possibly a follower of his ideas, touched upon the subject in the work ''[[Problems (Aristotle)|Problems]] - Book XV'', asking: {{quote|"Why is it that when the sun passes through quadri-laterals, as for instance in wickerwork, it does not produce a figure rectangular in shape but circular?”}} and further on: {{quote|“Why is it that an eclipse of the sun, if one looks at it through a sieve or through leaves, such as a plane-tree or other broadleaved tree, or if one joins the fingers of one hand over the fingers of the other, the rays are crescent-shaped where they reach the earth? Is it for the same reason as that when light shines through a rectangular peep-hole, it appears circular in the form of a cone?"}}

Many philosophers and scientists of the Western world would ponder this question before it became accepted that the circular and crescent-shapes described in this "problem" were actually pinhole image projections of the sun. Although a projected image will have the shape of the aperture when the light source, aperture and projection plane are close together, the projected image will have the shape of the light source when they are further apart.

[[Euclid]] is sometimes reported to have mentioned the camera obscura phenomenon as a demonstration that light travels in straight lines in his very influential ''[[Euclid's Optics|Optics]]'' (circa 300 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Historical Encyclopedia of Natural and Mathematical Sciences, Volume 1|page=465|last=Ben-Menahem|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9tUrarQYhKMC&amp;lpg=PA965&amp;dq=euclid%20inverted%20image&amp;pg=PA965#v=onepage&amp;q=euclid%20inverted%20image&amp;f=false|isbn=9783540688310|date=2009-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in common translations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://philomatica.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Optics-of-Euclid.pdf|title=Optics of Euclid}}&lt;/ref&gt; no remarks of anything that resembles camera obscura can be found.

In the 4th century, [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] scholar [[Theon of Alexandria]] observed that "candlelight passing through a pinhole will create an illuminated spot on a screen that is directly in line with the aperture and the center of the candle."&lt;ref&gt;''Inside the Box: A Proven System of Creativity for Breakthrough Results'' {{ISBN|978-1-451-65930-6}} p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arab]] [[physicist]] [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (known in the West by the Latinised Alhazen) (965–1039) explained in his [[Book of Optics]] (circa 1027) that rays of light travel in straight lines and are distinguished by the body that reflected the rays and then wrote:
{{quote|"Evidence that light and color do not mingle in air or (other) transparent bodies is (found in) the fact that, when several candles are at various distinct locations in the same area, and when they all face a window that opens into a dark recess, and when there is a white wall or (other white) opaque body in the dark recess facing that window, the (individual) lights of those candles appear individually upon that body or wall according to the number of those candles; and each of those lights (spots of light) appears directly opposite one (particular) candle along a straight line passing through that window.

Al-Haytham also analyzed the rays of sunlight and concluded that they make a conic shape where they meet at the hole, forming another conic shape reverse to the first one from the hole to the opposite wall in the dark room.

In his 1088 book ''[[Dream Pool Essays]]'' the [[Song Dynasty]] Chinese scientist [[Shen Kuo]] (1031–1095) compared the focal point of a concave burning-mirror and the "collecting" hole of  camera obscura phenomena to an oar in a rowlock to explain how the images were inverted:
{{quote|"When a bird flies in the air, its shadow moves along the ground in the same direction. But if its image is collected (''shu'')(like a belt being tightened) through a small hole in a window, then the shadow moves in the direction opposite of that of the bird.[...] This is the same principle as the burning-mirror. Such a mirror has a concave surface, and reflects a finger to give an upright image if the object is very near, but if the finger moves farther and farther away it reaches a point where the image disappears and after that the image appears inverted. Thus the point where the image disappears is like the pinhole of the window. So also the oar is fixed at the rowlock somewhere at its middle part, constituting, when it is moved, a sort of 'waist' and the handle of the oar is always in the position inverse to the end (which is in the water)."}}

Shen Kuo also responded to a statement of [[Duan Chengshi]] in ''[[Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang]]'' written in about 840 that the inverted image of a [[Chinese pagoda]] tower beside a seashore, was inverted because it was reflected by the sea: "This is nonsense. It is a normal principle that the image is inverted after passing through the small hole."&lt;ref name=needham4/&gt;

English statesman and [[scholasticism|scholastic philosopher]] [[Robert Grosseteste]] (c. 1175 – 9 October 1253) commented on the camera obscura.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/index/R2717G210K21R7R2.pdf A reconsideration of Roger Bacon's theory of pinhole images]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1292(or earlier) roger bacon - image006.jpg|thumb|Three-tiered camera obscura, 13th century? (attributed to Roger Bacon)]]
English philosopher and Franciscan friar [[Roger Bacon]] (c. 1219/20 – c. 1292) falsely stated in his ''De Multiplicatione Specerium'' (1267) that an image projected through a square aperture was round because light would travel in spherical waves and therefore assumed its natural shape after passing through a hole. He is also credited with a manuscript that advised to study solar eclipses safely by observing the rays passing through some round hole and studying the spot of light they form on a surface.&lt;ref name=Mannoni1&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_great_art_of_light_and_shadow.html?id=t_cSAQAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|last=Mannoni|first=Laurent|title=The great art of light and shadow|year=2000|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A very similar picture is found in [[Athanasius Kircher]]'s ''[[Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae]]'' (1646).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae|last=Kircher|first=Athanasius|year=1646|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=Xggfro5KeRoC&amp;pg=PA130#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polish friar, theologian, physicist, mathematician and natural philosopher [[Vitello|Erazmus Ciołek Witelo]] (also known as Vitello Thuringopolonis and by many different spellings of the name "Witelo") wrote about the camera obscura in his very influential treatise ''Perspectiva'' (circa 1270-1278), which was largely based on Ibn al-Haytham's work.

English archbishop and scholar [[John Peckham]] (circa 1230 – 1292) wrote about the camera obscura in his ''Tractatus de Perspectiva'' (circa 1269-1277) and ''Perspectiva communis'' (circa 1277-79), falsely arguing that light gradually forms the circular shape after passing through the aperture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tractatus de perspectiva|last1=Lindberg|first1=David C.|last2=Pecham|first2=John|year=1972|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UytDAAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PP7&amp;dq=inauthor%3A%22John%20Peckham%22&amp;pg=PA15#v=onepage&amp;q=camera&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; His writings were influenced by Roger Bacon.

French astronomer Guillaume de Saint-Cloud suggested in his 1292 work ''Almanach Planetarum'' that the eccentricity of the sun could be determined with the camera obscura from the inverse proportion between the distances and the apparent solar diameters at apogee and perigee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=J.L.|last=Mancha|title=Studies in Medieval Astronomy and Optics|pages=275–297|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=02KQgQNL-P4C&amp;lpg=PA39&amp;ots=gKQwDqRa6M&amp;dq=%22william%20of%20saint-cloud%22%20camera&amp;pg=PA37#v=onepage&amp;q=%22william%20of%20saint-cloud%22%20camera&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kamāl al-Dīn al-Fārisī]] (1267–1319) described in his 1309 work ''Kitab Tanqih al-Manazir'' (''The Revision of the Optics'') how he experimented with a glass sphere filled with water in a camera obscura with a controlled aperture and found that the colors of the rainbow are phenomena of the decomposition of light.&lt;ref&gt;Nader El-Bizri, "Optics", in ''Medieval Islamic Civilization: An Encyclopedia'', ed.

French Jewish philosopher, mathematician, physicist and astronomer/astrologer [[Gersonides|Levi ben Gershon]] (1288–1344) (also known as Gersonides or Leo de Balneolis) made several astronomical observations using a camera obscura with a [[Jacob's staff]], describing methods to measure the angular diameters of the sun, the moon and the bright planets Venus and Jupiter. He determined the eccentricity of the sun based on his observations of the summer and winter solstices in 1334. Levi also noted how the size of the aperture determined the size of the projected image. He wrote about his findings in Hebrew in his treatise ''Sefer Milhamot Ha-Shem'' (''The Wars of the Lord'') Book V Chapters 5 and 9.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Astronomy of Levi ben Gerson|pages=140–143|last=Goldstein|first=Bernard R.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ETOtBgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA79&amp;ots=kijNtMR0LE&amp;dq=%22Levi%20Ben%20Gerson%22%20camera&amp;pg=PA79#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Levi%20Ben%20Gerson%22%20camera&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian polymath [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1452–1519), familiar with the work of Alhazen in Latin translation{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} and after an extensive study of optics and human vision, wrote the oldest known clear description of the camera obscura in mirror writing in a notebook in 1502, later published in the collection ''[[Codex Atlanticus]]'' (translated from Latin):

{{quote|If the facade of a building, or a place, or a landscape is illuminated by the sun and a small hole is drilled in the wall of a room in a building facing this, which is not directly lighted by the sun, then all objects illuminated by the sun will send their images through this aperture and will appear, upside down, on the wall facing the hole.
You will catch these pictures on a piece of white paper, which placed vertically in the room not far from that opening, and you will see all the above-mentioned objects on this paper in their natural shapes or colors, but they will appear smaller and upside down, on account of crossing of the rays at that aperture. If these pictures originate from a place which is illuminated by the sun, they will appear colored on the paper exactly as they are. The paper should be very thin and must be viewed from the back.&lt;ref&gt;Josef Maria Eder ''History of Photography'' translated by Edward Epstean Hon. F.R.P.S Copyright Columbia University Press&lt;/ref&gt;}}

These descriptions, however, would remain unknown until Venturi deciphered and published them in 1797.&lt;ref name=Repstad&gt;{{cite web|url=https://jongrepstad.com/pinhole-photography/pinhole-photography-history-images-cameras-formulas/|title=Pinhole Photography – History, Images, Cameras, Formulas|first=Jon|last=Grepstad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Da Vinci was clearly very interested in the camera obscura: over the years he drew circa 270 diagrams of the camera obscura in his notebooks . He systematically experimented with various shapes and sizes of apertures and with multiple apertures (1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 16, 24, 28 and 32). He compared the working of the eye to that of the camera obscura and seemed especially interested in its capability of demonstrating basic principles of optics: the inversion of images through the pinhole or pupil, the non-interference of images and the fact that images are "all in all and all in every part".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sumscorp.com/leonardo_studies/news_98.html |title=Leonardo and the Camera Obscura / Kim Veltman |publisher=Sumscorp.com |date=1986-12-02 |accessdate=2017-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest known published drawing of a camera obscura is found in Dutch physician, mathematician and instrument maker [[Gemma Frisius]]’ 1545 book ''De Radio Astronomica et Geometrica'', in which he described and illustrated how he used the camera obscura to study the solar eclipse of January 24, 1544&lt;ref name=Repstad/&gt;

Italian polymath [[Gerolamo Cardano]] described using a glass disc - probably a [[biconvex lens]] - in a camera obscura in his 1550 book ''De subtilitate, vol. I, Libri IV''. He suggested to use it to view "what takes place in the street when the sun shines" and advised to use a very white sheet of paper as a projection screen so the colours wouldn't be dull.&lt;ref name=Ilardi /&gt;

Sicilian mathematician and astronomer [[Francesco Maurolico]] (1494-1575) answered Aristotle's problem how sunlight that shines through rectangular holes can form round spots of light or crescent-shaped spots during an eclipse in his treatise ''Photismi de lumine et umbra'' (1521-1554). However this wasn't published before 1611,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Photismi de lumine et umbra|year=1611|last=Maurolico|first=Francesco|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ug6ywn-D9BgC&amp;pg=PP9#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; after Johannes Kepler had published similar findings of his own.

Italian polymath [[Giambattista della Porta]] described the camera obscura, which he called "obscurum cubiculum", in the 1558 first edition of his book series ''[[Magia Naturalis]]''. He suggested to use a convex mirror to project the image onto paper and to use this as a drawing aid. Della Porta compared the human eye to the camera obscura: "For the image is let into the eye through the eyeball just as here through the window". The popularity of Della Porta's books helped spread knowledge of the camera obscura.&lt;ref name=Larsen&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.williamshakespeare-sonnets.com/sonnet-24|last=Larsen|first=Kenneth|title=Sonnet 24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Durbin|first=P.T.|year=2012|title=Philosophy of Technology|page=74|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R2OSBgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;ots=UmoBlPH0x3&amp;dq=Robert%20Fludd%20camera%20obscura&amp;pg=PA74#v=onepage&amp;q=Robert%20Fludd%20camera%20obscura&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his influential and meticulously annotated Latin edition of the works of Al-Haytam and Witelo ''Opticae thesauru'' (1572) German mathematician [[Friedrich Risner]] proposed a portable camera obscura drawing aid; a lightweight wooden hut with lenses in each of its four walls that would project images of the surroundings on a paper cube in the middle.

Around 1575 Italian Dominican priest, mathematician, astronomer, and cosmographer [[Ignazio Danti]] designed a camera obscura gnomom and a meridian line for the [[Basilica of Santa Maria Novella]], Florence and he later had a massive gnomon built in the [[San Petronio Basilica]] in Bologna. The gnomon was used to study the movements of the sun during the year and helped in determining the new Gregorian calendar for which Danti took place in the commission appointed by [[Pope Gregory XIII|Pope Gregorius XIII]] and instituted in 1582.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cassini|title=1655-2005: 350 Years of the Great Meridian Line|url=http://stelle.bo.astro.it/archivio/2005-anno-cassiniano/meridian_ing.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This leaves the image reversed, but would become common practice in later camera obscura boxes.&lt;ref name=Ilardi /&gt;

Giambattista della Porta added a “lenticular crystal” or biconvex lens to the camera obscura description in the 1589 second edition of ''Magia Naturalis''. He also described use of the camera obscura to project hunting scenes, banquets, battles, plays or anything desired on white sheets. Trees, forests, rivers, mountains "that are really so, or made by Art, of Wood, or some other matter" could be arranged on a plain in the sunshine on the other side of the camera obscura wall. Little children and animals (for instance handmade deer, wild boars, rhinos, elephants and lions) could perform in this set. "Then by degrees they must appear, as coming out of their dens, upon the Plain: The Hunter he must come with his hunting Pole, Nets, Arrows, and other necessaries, that may represent hunting: Let there be Horns, Cornets, Trumpets sounded: those that are in the Chamber shall see Trees, Animals, Hunters Faces, and all the rest so plainly, that they cannot tell whether they be true or delusions: Swords drawn will glister in at the hole, that they will make people almost afraid." 
Della Porta claimed to have shown such spectacles often to his friends. They admired it very much and could hardly be convinced by Della Porta's explanations that what they had seen was really an optical trick. &lt;ref name=Larsen /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A55484.0001.001/1:20?rgn=div1;view=fulltext |title=Natural Magick (Book XVII, Chap.

[[File:1619 Scheiner - Oculus hoc est (frontispiece).jpg|thumb|Detail of Scheiner's ''Oculus hoc est'' (1619) frontispiece with a camera obscura's projected image reverted by a lens.]]
The earliest use of the term "camera obscura" is found in the 1604 book ''Ad Vitellionem Paralipomena'' by German mathematician, astronomer, and astrologer [[Johannes Kepler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dupre |first1=Sven |title=Inside the "Camera Obscura": Kepler's Experiment and Theory of Optical Imagery |journal=Early Science and Medicin |date=2008 |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=219–244 |jstor=20617729}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kepler discovered the working of the camera obscura by recreating its principle with a book replacing a shining body and sending threads from its edges through a many-cornered aperture in a table onto the floor where the threads recreated the shape of the book. He also realized that images are "painted" inverted and reversed on the retina of the eye and figured that this is somehow corrected by the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Theories of Vision from Al-kindi to Kepler|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-8A_auBvyFoC&amp;lpg=PA164&amp;dq=kepler%20camera%20obscura%20eye&amp;pg=PA186#v=onepage&amp;q=kepler%20camera%20obscura%20eye&amp;f=false|last=Lindberg|first=David C.|year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1607 Kepler studied the sun in his camera obscura and noticed a [[sunspot]], but he thought it was Mercury transiting the sun.&lt;ref name =aps&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/201503/physicshistory.cfm|title=March 9, 1611: Dutch astronomer Johannes Fabricius observes sunspots}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In his 1611 book ''Dioptrice'' Kepler described how the projected image of the camera obscura can be improved and reverted with a lens. It is believed he later used a telescope with three lenses to revert the image in the camera obscura.&lt;ref name=Ilardi /&gt;

In 1611 Frisian/German astronomers [[David Fabricius|David]] and [[Johannes Fabricius]] (father and son) studied sunspots with a camera obscura, after realizing looking at the sun directly with the telescope could damage their eyes.&lt;ref name =aps/&gt; They are thought to have combined the telescope and the camera obscura into camera obscura telescopy.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

In 1612 Italian mathematician [[Benedetto Castelli]] wrote to his mentor, the Italian astronomer, physicist, engineer, philosopher and mathematician [[Galileo Galilei]] about projecting images of the sun through a [[telescope]] (invented in 1608) to study the recently discovered sunspots. Galilei wrote about Castelli's technique to the German Jesuit priest, physicist and astronomer Christoph Scheiner.&lt;ref name=Whitehouse/&gt;

[[File:Sheiner Viewing Sunspots 1625.jpg|left|thumb|Scheiner's helioscope as illustrated in his book ''Rosa Ursina sive Sol'' (1626-30)]]
From 1612 to at least 1630 [[Christoph Scheiner]] would keep on studying sunspots and constructing new telescopic solar projection systems. He called these "Heliotropii Telioscopici", later contracted to [[helioscope]].&lt;ref name=Whitehouse&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4eHgCgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT82&amp;ots=-EVwXlh4Hi&amp;dq=heliotropii%20telioscopici&amp;pg=PT82#v=onepage&amp;q=castelli&amp;f=false|title=The Sun: A Biography|last=Whitehouse|first=David|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his helioscope studies Scheiner built a box around the viewing/projecting end of the telescope, which can be seen as the oldest known version of a box-type camera obscura. Scheiner also made a portable camera obscura.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Christoph Scheiner und die Camera obscura|last=Daxecker|bibcode=2006AcHA...28...37D|first=Franz|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1613 book ''Opticorum Libri Sex''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/opticorumlibrise00agui|title=Opticorum Libri Sex philosophis juxta ac mathematicis utiles|year=1613|last=d'Aguilon|first=François}}&lt;/ref&gt; Belgian Jesuit mathematician, physicist and architect [[François d'Aguilon]] described how some charlatans cheated people out of their money by claiming they knew [[necromancy]] and would raise the specters of the devil from hell to show them to the audience inside a dark room. The image of an assistant with a devil's mask was projected through a lens into the dark room, scaring the uneducated spectators.&lt;ref name=Mannoni1/&gt;

[[File:1858 - Gagniet (d) Quarteley (g) - Cours de Physique (A. Ganot).jpg|thumb|A camera obscura drawing aid tent in an illustration for an 1858 book on physics]]
By 1620 Kepler used a portable camera obscura tent with a modified telescope to draw landscapes. It could be turned around to capture the surroundings in parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/wcpa/servlet/DCARead?standardNo=0192159674&amp;standardNoType=1&amp;excerpt=true|title=Vermeer's camera|last=Steadman|first=Philip|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dutch inventor [[Cornelis Drebbel]] is thought to have constructed a box-type camera obscura which corrected the inversion of the projected image. In 1622 he sold one to the Dutch poet, composer and diplomat [[Constantijn Huygens]] who used it to paint and recommended it to his artist friends.&lt;ref name=Snyder/&gt; Huygens wrote to his parents (translated from French):{{quote|I have at home Drebbel's other instrument, which certainly makes admirable effects in painting from reflection in a dark room; it is not possible for me to reveal the beauty to you in words; all painting is dead by comparison, for here is life itself or something more elevated if one could articulate it. The figure and the contour and the movements come together naturally therein and in a grandly pleasing fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Constantijn huygens and early attitudes towards the camera obscura|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03087298.1977.10442893|last=Wheelock, Jr|first=Arthur K.|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

German [[oriental studies|Orientalist]], mathematician, inventor, poet, and librarian [[Daniel Schwenter]] wrote in his 1636 book ''Deliciae Physico-Mathematicae'' about an instrument that a man from [[Pappenheim]] had shown him, which enabled movement of a lens to project more from a scene through the camera obscura. It consisted of a ball as big as a fist, through which a hole (AB) was made with a lens attached on one side (B). This ball was placed inside two halves of part of a hollow ball that were then glued together (CD), in which it could be turned around. This device was attached to a wall of the camera obscura (EF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Daniel|last=Schwenter|year=1636|page=255|language=German|url=https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=EWM_AAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;output=reader&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;pg=GBS.PA255|title=Deliciae Physico-Mathematicae}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[universal joint]] mechanism was later called a [[scioptric ball]].

In his 1637 book ''Dioptrique'' French philosopher, mathematician and scientist [[René Descartes]] suggested placing an eye of a recently dead man (or if a dead man was unavailable, the eye of an ox) into an opening in a darkened room and scraping away the flesh at the back until one could see the inverted image formed on the retina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YSUUONfamiEC&amp;lpg=PA36&amp;ots=c6yoVajBPR&amp;dq=%E2%80%9Ctaking%20the%20dead%20eye%20of%20a%20newly%20dead%20person%20(or%20failing%20that%2C%20the%20eye%20of%20an%20ox%20or%20some%20other%20large%20animal)%E2%80%9D&amp;pg=PA36#v=onepage&amp;q=%E2%80%9Ctaking%20the%20dead%20eye%20of%20a%20newly%20dead%20person%20(or%20failing%20that,%20the%20eye%20of%20an%20ox%20or%20some%20other%20large%20animal)%E2%80%9D&amp;f=false/|title=Theatre and Performance Design: A Reader in Scenographyy|last=Collins|first=Jane|year=2012|first2=Andrew|last2=Nisbet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1642 Mario Bettini - Apiaria universae philosophiae mathematica.jpg|thumb|Illustration of a twelve-hole camera obscura from Bettini's ''Apiaria universae philosophiae mathematicae" (1642)]]
Italian Jesuit philosopher, mathematician and astronomer [[Mario Bettinus|Mario Bettini]] wrote about making a camera obscura with twelve holes in his ''Apiaria universae philosophiae mathematicae'' (1642). When a foot soldier would stand in front of the camera, a twelve person army of soldiers making the same movements would be projected.

French mathematician, [[Minim (religious order)|Minim friar]], and painter of [[Anamorphosis|anamorphic art]] [[Jean François Niceron|Jean-François Nicéron]] (1613-1646) wrote about the camera obscura with convex lenses. He explained how the camera obscura could be used by painters to achieve perfect perspective in their work. He also complained how charlatans abused the camera obscura to fool witless spectators and make them believe that the projections were magic or occult science. These writings were published in a posthumous version of ''La Perspective Curieuse'' (1652).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vRf37hPYOYUC|title=La Perspective curieuse|year=1652|last=Nicéron|first=Jean François|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1650 to 1800: Introduction of the magic lantern, popular portable box-type drawing aid, painting aid===
The use of the camera obscura to project special shows to entertain an audience seems to have remained very rare. A description of what was most likely such a show in 1656 in France, was penned by the poet [[Jean Loret]]. The Parisian society were presented with upside-down images of palaces, ballet dancing and battling with swords. The performance was silent and Loret was surprised that all the movements made no sound. Loret felt somewhat frustrated that he did not know the secret that made this spectacle possible. There are several clues that this was a camera obscura show, rather than a very early magic lantern show, especially in the upside-down image and the energetic movements.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.magiclantern.org.uk/new-magic-lantern-journal/pdfs/4008787a.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

German Jesuit scientist [[Gaspar Schott]] heard from a traveler about a small camera obscura device he had seen in Spain, which one could carry under one arm and could be hidden under a coat. He then constructed his own sliding box camera obscura, which could focus by sliding a wooden box part fitted inside another wooden box part. He wrote about this in his 1657 ''Magia universalis naturæ et artis'' (volume 1 - book 4 "Magia Optica" pages 199-201).

By 1659 the [[magic lantern]] was introduced and partly replaced the camera obscura as a projection device, while the camera obscura mostly remained popular as a drawing aid. The magic lantern can be seen as a development of the (box-type) camera obscura device.

The 17th century [[Dutch Masters]], such as [[Johannes Vermeer]], were known for their magnificent attention to detail. It has been widely speculated that they made use of camerae obscurae, but the extent of their use by artists at this period remains a matter of considerable controversy, recently revived by the [[Hockney–Falco thesis]].&lt;ref name=Snyder/&gt;

[[File:1676 Johann Sturm - Camerae Obscurae Portatilis.jpg|thumb|Illustration of a portable camera obscura device from Johann Sturm's ''Collegium experimentale, sive curiosum'' (1676)]]
German philosopher [[Johann Sturm]] published an illustrated article about the construction of a portable camera obscura box with a 45° mirror and an oiled paper screen in his book ''Collegium experimentale: sive curiosum'' (1676).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nbMWAAAAQAAJ|title=Collegium experimentale, sive curiosum|first=Johann|last=Sturm|year=1676|language=Latin|pages=161–163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Johann Zahn]]'s ''Oculus Artificialis Teledioptricus Sive Telescopium'', published in 1685, contains many descriptions, diagrams, illustrations and sketches of both the camera obscura and the [[magic lantern]]. A hand-held device with a mirror reflex mechanism was first proposed by [[Johann Zahn]] in 1685, a design that would later be used in photographic cameras.&lt;ref&gt;Gernsheim, pp. 5-6&lt;/ref&gt;

The scientist Robert Hooke presented a paper in 1694 to the Royal Society, in which he described a portable camera obscura. It was a cone-shaped box which fit onto the head and shoulders of its user.&lt;ref&gt;Wenczel, pg. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

From the beginning of the 18th century craftsmen and opticians would make camera obscura devices in the shape of books, which were much appreciated by lovers of optical devices.&lt;ref name=Mannoni1 /&gt;

One chapter in the Conte [[Francesco Algarotti|Algarotti's]] ''Saggio sopra Pittura'' (1764) is dedicated to the use of a camera ottica ("optic chamber") in painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first= Francesco| last= Algarotti | year=1764 | title= ''Saggio sopra la pittura'' | chapter= | editor= Presso Marco Coltellini, Livorno| others= | pages= 59–63 | id= | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=SNY9AAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | authorlink= | publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 18th century, following developments by [[Robert Boyle]] and [[Robert Hooke]], more easily portable models in boxes became available. These were extensively used by amateur artists while on their travels, but they were also employed by professionals, including [[Paul Sandby]] and [[Joshua Reynolds]], whose camera (disguised as a book) is now in the [[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum in London]]. Such cameras were later adapted by [[Joseph Nicephore Niepce]], [[Louis Daguerre]] and [[William Fox Talbot]] for creating the first photographs.

While the technical principles of the camera obscura have been known since antiquity, the broad use of the technical concept in producing images with a [[linear perspective]] in paintings, maps, theatre setups and architectural and later photographic images and movies started in the Western Renaissance and the scientific revolution. While e.g. [[Alhazen]] (Ibn al-Haytham) had already observed an optical effect and developed a state of the art theory of the refraction of light, he was less interested to produce images with it (compare [[Hans Belting]] 2005); the society he lived in was even hostile (compare [[Aniconism in Islam]]) towards personal images.&lt;ref name=belt&gt;Hans Belting Das echte Bild.

{{Israelis}}
'''Canaanism''' was a cultural and ideological movement founded in 1939 that reached its peak in the 1940s among the [[Jews]] of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. It has had significant effect on the course of Israeli art, [[Israeli literature|literature]] and spiritual and political thought. Its adherents were called '''Canaanites''' ({{lang-he-n|כנענים}}). The movement's original name was the ''Council for the Coalition of Hebrew Youth'' ({{Hebrew|הוועד לגיבוש הנוער העברי}}); "Canaanism" was originally a pejorative term. It grew out of [[Revisionist Zionism]] and according to Ron Kuzar had "its early roots in [[Far-right politics|European extreme right-wing]] movements, notably [[Italian Fascism|Italian fascism]]"&lt;ref&gt;Kuzar 107, 12-13&lt;/ref&gt; which was not anti-Semitic like [[Nazism|German national socialism]]. Most of its members were part of the [[Irgun]] or [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]].&lt;ref name="Kuzar 13"&gt;Kuzar 13&lt;/ref&gt; Canaanism never had more than around two dozen registered members, but because most of these were influential intellectuals and artists, the movement had an influence far beyond its size,&lt;ref name="kuzar107"&gt;Kuzar 197&lt;/ref&gt; Its members believed that much of the Middle East had been a Hebrew-speaking civilization in antiquity.&lt;ref name="Kuzar 12"&gt;Kuzar 12&lt;/ref&gt; Kuzar also says they hoped to revive this civilization, creating a "Hebrew" nation, disconnected from the Jewish past, which would embrace the Middle East's Arab population as well.&lt;ref name="Kuzar 12"/&gt;  They saw both "world Jewry and world Islam" as backward and medieval; Ron Kuzar writes that the movement "exhibited an interesting blend of militarism and power politics toward the Arabs as an organized community on the one hand and a welcoming acceptance of them as individuals to be redeemed from medieval darkness on the other."&lt;ref name="Kuzar 13"/&gt;

==The Canaanites and Judaism==
The movement was founded in 1939. In 1943 the Jewish-Palestinian poet [[Yonatan Ratosh]] published an "Epistle to the Hebrew Youth", the first manifesto of the Canaanites. In this tract, Ratosh called upon Hebrew youth to disaffiliate themselves from [[Judaism]], and declared that no meaningful bond united Hebrew youth residing in Palestine and Judaism. Ratosh argued that Judaism was not a [[nation]] but a [[religion]], and as such it was universal, without territorial claims; one could be Jewish anywhere. For a nation to genuinely arise in Palestine, he maintained, the youth must uncouple from Judaism and form a [[Hebrew]] nation with its own unique identity. (The term "Hebrew" had been associated with the Zionist aspiration to create a strong, self-confident "new Jew" since the late nineteenth century).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Segev|first=Tom|author2=Haim Watzman|title=Elvis in Jerusalem: Post-Zionism and the Americanization of Israel  |publisher=Macmillan|year=2003|pages=26|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rCAk-6zJIC8C&amp;pg=PA26 | isbn=978-0-8050-7288-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shavit xiv&lt;/ref&gt;  The birthplace and geographical coordinates of this nation is the [[Fertile Crescent]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Council for the Coalition of Hebrew Youth calls upon you as a Hebrew, as one for whom the Hebrew homeland is a homeland in actuality: not as vision, nor as desire; and not as solution for the Jewish question, nor as solution to cosmic questions, and not as solution to the variegated neuroses of those stricken by the diaspora. As one for whom the Hebrew language is a language in actuality and practicality, a mother tongue, a language of culture and of the soul; the one and only language for emotion and thought. As one whose character and intellect were determined in the Hebrew reality, whose internal landscape is the landscape of the nation and whose past is the past of the nation alone. As one who, despite the best efforts of rootless parents, teachers, statesmen and religious leaders, could not be made to like and affiliate with the [[Shtetl]] and the history of the [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora]], the pogroms and expulsions and martyrs, and whose natural estrangement from all prophets of Zionism, the fathers of Jewish Literature in the Hebrew tongue, and the diaspora mentality and the diaspora problem, cannot be expunged. Whereas all these were conferred upon you by force, like a borrowed cloth, faded and tattered and too-tight.&lt;ref name="epistle"&gt;{{cite journal
  | last = Ratosh
  | first = Yonatan
  | title = Ktav el hanoar haivri
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Out of their estrangement from Judaism the Canaanites were also estranged from [[Zionism]]. The [[Israel|State of Israel]] ought to be, they argued, a [[Jewish state|Hebrew state]], not a solution to the [[Jewish Question]]. Following the first [[Aliyah|Aliyot]], a generation arose in Palestine that spoke Hebrew as a native language and did not always identify with Judaism. Designating the Israeli People as a "Jewish People", the Canaanites argued, was misleading. If it was possible to be a Jew anywhere, then the State of Israel was merely an anecdote in the [[history of Judaism]]. A nation must be rooted in a territory and a language—things which Judaism, in its very nature, could not provide.

==Canaanites and history==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2013}}

The movement promoted the idea that the [[Land of Israel]] was that of ancient [[Canaan]] (or, according to others, the whole of the [[Fertile Crescent]]) in which ancient peoples and cultures had lived, and that the historical occasion of the reemergence of an Israeli people constituted a veritable revival of these selfsame ancient Hebrews and their civilization, and consequently a rejection of religious Judaism in favor of a native and rooted Hebrew identity.

Because the Canaanites sought to create in Israel a new people, they mandated the dissociation of [[Israelis]] from Judaism and the history of Judaism. In their stead they placed the culture and history of the [[Ancient Near East]], which they considered the true historical reference. They argued that the people of the Land of Israel in the days of the biblical monarchs had not been [[Jews|Jewish]] but [[Hebrews|Hebrew]], and had shared a cultural context with other peoples of the region. Citing contemporary [[biblical criticism]], the Canaanites argued that the [[Hebrew Bible|Tanakh]] reflected this ancient history, but only partly, since it had been compiled in the period of the [[Second Temple]] by Jewish [[Scribe|scribes]] who had rewritten the history of the region to suit their world-view.

Much of the Canaanite effort was dedicated to researching the history of the [[Middle East]] and its peoples. The Canaanites cited approvingly the work of [[Umberto Cassuto]], who translated [[Ugaritic language|Ugaritic]] poetry into Hebrew. ([[Ugarit]] was an ancient city located in modern-day northern [[Syria]], where in the early 20th century many important ancient texts, written in the [[Ugaritic language]], were discovered.) Ugaritic verse bore an uncanny resemblance to the language of the [[Tanakh]]. The Canaanites argued that these texts proved that the people of the [[Land of Israel]] had been much closer socially and culturally to other peoples of the region than they had been to Judaism.

==Canaanites and literature==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2013}}
In his book, ''Sifrut Yehudit ba-lashon ha-ʻIvrit'' (Jewish Literature in the Hebrew Tongue), Yonatan Ratosh sought to differentiate between [[Hebrew literature]] and [[Jewish literature]] written in the [[Hebrew language]]. Jewish literature, Ratosh claimed, could be and was written in any number of languages. The ideas and writing style that characterize Jewish literature in Hebrew were not substantially different from those of Jewish literature in other languages. Ratosh and his fellow Canaanites (especially [[Aharon Amir]]) thought that Hebrew literature should be rooted to its historical origins in the [[Land of Israel]] and the [[Hebrew language]]. As an example they noted American literature, which in their mind was newly created for the new American people.

Canaanite verse is often obscure to those unfamiliar with ancient Ugaritic and [[Canaanite mythology]]. One of the principal techniques used by the Canaanites to produce Hebrew literature was to adopt words and phrases (especially [[hapax legomenon|hapax legomena]], which the Canaanites regarded as traces of the original unedited Hebraic Tanakh) from the Tanakh, and use them in a poetic that approximated [[Biblical poetry|biblical]] and Ugaritic verse, especially in their use of repetitive structures and [[Parallelism (rhetoric)|parallelism]]. The Canaanites did not rule out the use of new Hebrew words, but many of them did avoid [[Mishnah|Mishnaic]] Hebrew. However, these characteristics represent only the core of the Canaanite movement, and not its full breadth.

The late literary scholar [[Baruch Kurzweil]] argued that the Canaanites were not ''[[sui generis]]'', but a direct continuation (albeit a radical one) of the literature of [[Micha Josef Berdyczewski]] and [[Shaul Tchernichovsky]].

==Canaanites and language==
Ratosh and his brother, [[Uzzi Ornan]], also sought for the [[Romanization of Hebrew]] in order to further divorce the language from the older [[Hebrew alphabet]]. Writing articles in the Hebrew-language press in the 1960s and 1970s, they criticized the Hebrew alphabet for its graphical shortcomings and relationship with Judaism, and proposed for official Romanization of the language in order to further free secular Hebrew Israelis from the hold of religion and integrate them into the larger [[Levant|Levantine region]].&lt;ref&gt;J. S. Diamond, Homeland or Holy Land? The ‘Canaanite’ Critique of Israel (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1986)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yaakov Shavit, The New Hebrew Nation (London: Frank Cass, 1987).&lt;/ref&gt; Their proposals for wholesale Romanization met condemnation from various public figures due to the perception that Romanization was a means of assimilation and Levantinization.&lt;ref&gt;Esther Raizen, “Romanization of the Hebrew Script,” 1987. (University of Texas Press) pp. 41–61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aytürk later compared the Canaanite proposal for Romanization to the more successful reform of the [[Turkish alphabet]] [[Atatürk's Reforms|as undertaken by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] in [[Turkey]]; the reform of Turkish spelling, which had previously been written in the [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]]-based [[Ottoman Turkish alphabet]] for over 1,000 years until the [[dissolution of the Ottoman Empire]], was similarly motivated by Atatürk's attempts to secularize and modernize post-Ottoman Turkish society.&lt;ref&gt;İlker Aytürk, "Script Charisma in Hebrew and Turkish: A Comparative Framework for Explaining Success and Failure of Romanization," Journal of World History, Volume 21, Number 1, March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==

{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2013}}

The Coalition published a journal, ''[[Aleph]]'', which ran from 1948-1953, featuring the works of several luminaries of the movement including Ratosh, [[Adia Horon]], [[Uzzi Ornan]], [[Amos Kenan]] and [[Benjamin Tammuz]]. It was edited by [[Aharon Amir]], and the journal circulated erratically throughout its existence.

The history of the Coalition and the movement was fraught with controversy and opposition. In 1951, leaflets were distributed by self-identified Canaanites in opposition to Zionism during the [[World Zionist Congress]] in Jerusalem that year. Later that year, the Coalition was formally organized at a conference of ideologues, but the permit to formally register as an NGO was deliberately delayed by the Interior Ministry; the ministry's representative explained that the approval has been delayed because "the group did not complete the standard inquiry of the granting of approvals for political societies". The group claimed as many as 500 members at its height, although outside commentators only assessed the membership at around 100.

After the arrest of Amos Kenan in June 1952 on suspicion of throwing a bomb onto the doorstep of [[David-Zvi Pinkas]], newspaper editorials were lodged against the Canaanite movement and its members. The Coalition claimed to have no connection to Kenan or his act, and both Amir and Ratosh filed a [[defamation|libel suit]] against [[Isaiah Bernstein]] of ''[[HaTzofe]]'' and [[Ezriel Carlebach]] from ''[[Maariv (newspaper)|Maariv]]'' on behalf of the Coalition, but the suit was rejected for technical reasons.

In the 1960s, the movement's members participated in group discussions called "Hebrew Thought Clubs" and issued a booklet of their discussions as "the first claw." Among participants in the discussions were also identified individuals who were Canaanites, as [[Rostam Bastuni]], an Israeli Arab who was a member of the second Knesset for Mapam, and [[Yehoshua Palmon]].

==Scope and influence==
[[File:Danziger, Itzhak, Nimrod, 1939.jpg|thumb|200px|''Nimrod'' (1939) by [[Yitzhak Danziger]], a visual emblem of the Canaanite idea.]]
The political influence of the Canaanites was limited, but their influence on literary and intellectual life in Israel was great. Among the avowed Canaanites were the poet [[Yonatan Ratosh]] and thinkers such as [[Edya Horon]]. A series of articles which Horon published in the journal "Keshet" in 1965 were compiled after his death into a book and published in 2000. These articles constituted political and cultural manifestos that sought to create a direct connection between [[Semitic culture]] from the second millennium BCE and contemporary Israeli culture, relying on advancements in the fields of [[archeology]] and research of [[Semitic languages]] in [[linguistics]].

Some of the artists who took after the movement were the sculptor [[Yitzhak Danziger]] (whose ''Nimrod'' became a visual emblem of the Canaanite idea), novelist [[Benjamin Tammuz]], writer [[Amos Kenan]], novelist and translator [[Aharon Amir]], thinker and linguist [[Uzzi Ornan]] and many others.

The journalist [[Uri Avnery]] praised Horon's journal ''[[Shem]]'' in 1942 but did not subscribe to Ratosh's orthodoxy; in 1947 he derided the Canaanites as [[Romanticism|romantic]], anachronistic, and divorced from reality.&lt;ref&gt;Shavit 135-37, 139&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the influence of Canaanism is still evident in some of his political thought, such as his 1947 proposal for a pan-Semitic union of Middle Eastern states.&lt;ref&gt;Shavit 141&lt;/ref&gt;  Avnery, along with several former Canaanites (notably Kenan and [[Boaz Evron]]) later changed positions drastically, becoming advocates for a Palestinian state.&lt;ref&gt;Shavit 151-153&lt;/ref&gt;  Israeli leftists and secularists are sometimes accused of Canaanism or Canaanite influence by their opponents.&lt;ref&gt;Shavit 20: "Some observers, very ironically, still find strong echoes of Canaanite ideology in what they consider anti-religious and leftist political opinions".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://journalterraincognita.blogspot.nl/2008/03/terra-incognita-26-jewish-tourism.html "Jewish tourism, mexican racism and canaanism,"] Terra Incognita, Issue 26, A Publication of Seth J.

The idea of creating a new people in Palestine different from the Jewish life in the diaspora which preceded it never materialized in purist Canaanite conception, but nevertheless had a lasting effect on the self-understanding of many spheres of Israeli public life.

==Criticism==
The Canaanite movement, since soon after its inception, has met with heavy criticism. In 1945 [[Nathan Alterman]] published the poem "Merivat Kayitz" (later included in the collection ''Yr HaYona'', published in 1958), which took issue with the central tenets of the Canaanite movement. Alterman and others claimed that so many years in the diaspora cannot be simply expunged. Alterman argued that no one should coerce the Jewish settlement to adopt an identity; its identity will be determined through its experience in time.

Ratosh responded with an article in 1950 in which he claimed that Alterman was dodging important questions about Israeli identity. He argued that a return to ancient Hebrew traditions is not only feasible but necessary.

Alterman was not the only person to speak out against the Canaanites. Among the important critics of the movement was [[Baruch Kurzweil]], who published ''The Roots and Quintessence of the 'Young Hebrews' Movement'' in 1953, which analyzed and sharply criticized Canaanite ideas. Kurzweil argued that the Canaanite ambition to motivate the variegated ethnography of the region in a single direction was not as easy as the Canaanites believed. Kurzweil believed the Canaanites replaced [[logos]] with [[Mythology|mythos]], producing a religious delusion:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Since it itself neglects the historical continuity of its people, introduces obscure concepts into their political vision in its declarations of a 'Hebrew Land on the Euphrates', and relies on increasingly irrational argumentation, the movement is liable to find itself an escape into the realm of myth.

The Young Hebrews are not the first to launch themselves into the task of mythic renewal. Their original contribution is rather stale. For over a hundred years, the world has pined for a return to the lap of myth.  The escapes into various myths have hitherto inflicted disasters upon humanity. In the spirit of good faith, it is best to assume that the whole chapter of mythic renewal in European thought is unclear to them. For the moment, we shall content ourselves with this quotation from [[Johan Huizinga|Huizinga]]: "Barbarization sets in when, in an old culture… the vapors of the magic and fantastic rise up again from the seething brew of passions to cloud the understanding: when the mythos supplants the logos."&lt;ref name="huizinga"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the same article Kurzweil argues that, if no viable alternative was found, the Canaanite movement might become the leading political ideology in Israel.

'''Catachresis''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|κατάχρησις}}, "abuse"), originally meaning a semantic misuse or error—e.g., using "militate" for "mitigate", "chronic" for "severe", "anachronism" for "anomaly", "alibi" for "excuse", etc.—is also the name given to many different types of figures of speech in which a word or phrase is being applied in a way that significantly departs from conventional (or traditional) usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Anshuman Sharma|title=The Impact - The Art of Communicating Eloquently|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vsro-gP1spMC&amp;pg=PA78|publisher=Anshuman Sharma|isbn=978-1-105-99521-7|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dead people in a graveyard being referred to as '''inhabitants''' is an example of catachresis.&lt;ref name="Arac2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonathan Arac|title=Impure Worlds: The Institution of Literature in the Age of the Novel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1ldJNr0k--4C&amp;pg=PA143|year=2011|publisher=Fordham Univ Press|isbn=978-0-8232-3178-2|page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Classification in literature ===
Catachresis is often used to convey extreme emotion or alienation. It is prominent in [[baroque]] literature and, more recently, in [[dada]]ist and [[surrealism|surrealist]] literature.

Example from [[Alexander Pope]]'s ''[[Peri Bathous, Or the Art of Sinking in Poetry]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;Masters of this [Catachresis] will say,
:'''Mow''' the beard,
:'''Shave''' the grass,
:'''Pin''' the plank,
:'''Nail''' my sleeve.&lt;ref&gt;Pope, ''Peri Bathous, Or the Art of Sinking in Poetry'', x&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Derrida, Spivak==
In [[Jacques Derrida]]'s ideas of [[deconstruction]], catachresis refers to the original incompleteness that is a part of all systems of meaning. He proposes that metaphor and catachresis are tropes that ground philosophical discourse. [[Postcolonial]] theorist [[Gayatri Spivak]] applies this word to "master words" that claim to represent a group, ''e.g.'', women or the [[proletariat]], when there are no "true" examples of "woman" or "proletarian". In a similar way, words that are imposed upon people and are deemed improper&lt;!--in what way?--&gt; thus denote a catachresis, a word with an arbitrary connection to its meaning.

The '''Cathedral Quarter''' in [[Belfast]], [[Northern Ireland]], is a developing area of the city, roughly situated between Royal Avenue near where the Belfast Central Library building is, and the Dunbar Link in the [[Belfast City Centre|city centre]]. From one of its corners, the junction of [[Royal Avenue, Belfast|Royal Avenue]], Donegall Street and York Street, the Cathedral Quarter lies south and east. Part of the area, centred on Talbot Street behind the cathedral, was formerly called the Half Bap.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/slums-brothels-and-seedy-divesjourney-into-the-dark-side-of-belfast-14499697.html Belfast Telegraph 18 September 2009 accessed 22 December 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; The "Little Italy" area,was on the opposite side of Great Patrick Street centred on Little Patrick Street and Nelson Street &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/legacies/immig_emig/northern_ireland/ni_4/article_2.shtml BBC Legacies]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cathedral Quarter extends out to the edge of what can be referred as the old merchant quarter of the city. Past where the merchant area meets the Cathedral Quarter is still mostly merchant trade and services orientated and undeveloped for visitor services.

The Cathedral Quarter is so called because [[St Anne’s Cathedral, Belfast|St Anne's Cathedral]] lies at its heart. St. Anne's or Belfast Cathedral is a [[Church of Ireland]] cathedral.

&lt;ref name=Davenport2006 &gt;{{citation |last1=Davenport |first1=Fionn |year=2006 |title=Ireland |first2=Charlotte |last2=Beech |first3=Tom |last3=Downs |first4=Des |last4=Hannigan |edition=7 |publisher=Lonely Planet |isbn=978-1-74059-968-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OKDE6knNUSQC |page=580}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Traditionally, the Cathedral Quarter was the centre of Belfast's trade and warehousing district, which sprung up directly from the prosperous linen and shipbuilding industries. The quarter still retains some of Belfast's oldest buildings and thoroughfares, including Waring Street and Hill Street.

The area fell into decline in the last century, but more recently it has re-emerged as a dedicated 'cultural quarter' of Belfast. Areas such as North Street are still in a state of dilapidation, but are likely to be redeveloped along with the rest of the quarter.

==Cultural quarter==
[[File:Commercial Court, Belfast.jpg|thumb|250px|Commercial Court]]
[[File:Statue, Custom House Square, Belfast (2) - geograph.org.uk - 412529.jpg|thumb|250px|Custom House Square]]

The definition of the area as a cultural quarter mostly came about because of the recent significant growth in arts- and culture-based organisations that are located there. As is the case with London's [[Covent Garden]] and Dublin's [[Temple Bar, Dublin|Temple Bar]] in the years before they became as renowned as they are, low rent and a central city location attracted to the area a wide variety of tenants. Some examples include Northern Visions TV (a.k.a. Belfast Community Television), The Safehouse Arts Gallery (and its parent organisation Community Visual Images), Belfast Print Workshop and Belfast's small Zen Meditation community, which has its headquarters at Black Mountain Zen Centre (a.k.a. Belfast Meditation Centre) in rooms in Cathedral Buildings, opposite St. Anne's. Dilapidated infrastructure, however, prevented any sort of mass repopulation of the area until recently. Development and repopulation may further have been hindered from a time since the [[North Street Arcade]], a listed building from the 1930s in the traditional [[Art Deco]] style, burned down in what many people believe were suspicious circumstances in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/3636381.stm BBC News reportage on the North Street Arcade Fire]&lt;/ref&gt;

A rich literary heritage is evident in the area. ''[[The Northern Whig]]'' was a popular satirical newspaper in the 19th century (very much in the same vein as [[Punch (magazine)|''Punch'']]), with its headquarters on the corner of Waring Street and Bridge Street, opposite the Assembly Rooms. Today, ''The Northern Whig'' building is a pub and restaurant, but the tradition of satirical writing still has a home in Cathedral Quarter through ''[[The Vacuum]]'', which has its offices in the area. Cathedral Quarter is very close to both the [[Belfast Central Library]] building and the headquarters of local newspaper publication the ''[[Belfast Telegraph]]''. ([https://www.flickr.com/photos/gerryward/1863364591/in/set-72157600469678047 Central Library photo link.]) The ''[[Sunday World]]'' has its Belfast offices in Commercial Court in the Cathedral Quarter. Another newspaper, the ''[[Belfast News Letter]]'', formerly had its headquarters on Donegall Street. ''[[The Irish News]]'', another well-known newspaper, still has its head office on Donegall Street.

As if to connect with this literary flavour, a popular pub in the area is named after Belfast poet [[John Harold Hewitt|John Hewitt]]. The John Hewitt houses noteworthy and interesting artwork and photographs in changing exhibitions, sometimes of political subjects, often with the art being for sale. As well there is a particular small-but-significant political display installation, and some cuttings about the poet John Hewitt.

Belfast's Custom House, situated on the very edge of Cathedral Quarter by the city's central Laganside bank, was a popular site for public speakers during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In those times, in the vein of London's [[Speakers' Corner]], the city's citizens often participated in the art of lively and spontaneous debate on any given subject. Today, in the site's reincarnation as Custom House Square, activities can be widely varied, from more pedestrian and family-orientated performances and activities to large-scale music concerts, D.J. performances and circus-style performance events for both adults and children. In autumn 2008, a showcase style afternoon with a succession of performers of roots, modern folk and country music from all over the world was hosted in tents. This is a characteristic type of occasion in Custom House Square which happens quite a number of times each year. This occasion was the closing day of the internationally highly acclaimed annual Open House Festival of the city. The festival takes place in many venues, including others within Cathedral Quarter, and its presence within marquees in Custom House Square in 2008 included an international festival of chilli peppers and chilli dishes.&lt;ref&gt;Open House Festival 2008 review. {{cite web |url=http://www.culturenorthernireland.org/article.aspx?art_id=2272 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213233749/http://www.culturenorthernireland.org/article.aspx?art_id=2272 |archivedate=2012-02-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The annual Cathedral Quarter Arts Festival in late Spring is one of the larger of the city's many cultural festivals.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} This festival has become internationally recognised and attracts a good number of international performers.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Though the CQAF is a notably smaller affair than the Belfast Festival at Queen's which has been known at times as the second largest international European arts Festival (second in size to the Edinburgh Festival).{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} An offshoot of this festival which is organised by the same Cathedral Quarter festival company is a smaller annual cultural festival, which however has a duration of most of the month: The Out to Lunch Arts Festival happens in The Cathedral Quarter in January.

Also central to the area is the Belfast campus of the [[University of Ulster]], incorporating the Art College. Nearby North Street is home to many of Belfast's most notorious bars and venues, particularly renowned during the [[Punk subculture|punk]] movement of the 1970s. These include The Front Page and Giro's (closed 2004). [[Derry]] rockers [[The Undertones]] were regular visitors to the University of Ulster's student union building, the Conor Hall, as well as The Assembly Rooms (a building which currently houses a Central Belfast gallery of The Emer Gallery, and has been known as The Northern Bank theatre). Local punk producer [[Terri Hooley]] ran a record store called Cathedral Records in the North Street Arcade before 2004's fire.

The area hosts a good number of various kinds of artists' spaces, though these are generally not open to the public. There are meetings in and around the area of various cultural and community organisations which members of the public can attend; for example the [https://web.archive.org/web/20080929021402/http://www.humanists.net/belfast/home.htm Belfast Humanist Group] meet a couple of times a month at the Community Arts Forum opposite the cathedral.

The cathedral itself remains a venue for cultural events, including evening and sometimes lunchtime music concerts. Concerts can be given by the musical performers associated with the cathedral and, more often, by independent musicians. The services of the cathedral frequently include sung services by the cathedral choir, and organ playing by the cathedral organist or sometimes a visiting organist. Evensong is also sung here. The Sunday sung service is at 11 am. There is also a youth choir of the cathedral which performs, of persons in their late teens and early twenties who are thought to be of a high standard of music making. Their aim is to perform and produce marketed recordings and radio recordings. Persons of any religion or none are welcome to attend services, musical or otherwise. Concerts given by independent musicians are given in a lovely venue and are not connected with the spiritual affairs of the Church of Ireland cathedral.

[http://www.niwarmemorial.org The Northern Ireland War Memorial] is a quite recently established commemorative museum and exhibition space in Talbot Street (along one side of the cathedral). Prince Michael of Kent was Guest of Honour at [https://web.archive.org/web/20081231114545/http://www.nio.gov.uk/prince-michael-of-kent-opens-new-northern-ireland-war-memorial-in-belfast/media-detail.htm?newsID=15528 a commemorative service in re-dedication of the War Memorial] on November 4, 2008.

On the corner of Donegall Street and Waring Street, a former bank building had become known as the Northern Bank Theatre, having housed irregular dramatic performances, mostly limited to festival times. This fine city building had been known in a former incarnation as the Exchange and Assembly Rooms. In 2008's Cathedral Quarter Arts Festival, a monologue production about the Burmese opposition leader [[Aung San Suu Kyi]], ''The Lady of Burma'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cqaf.com/theatre_06.htm|title=The Lady of Burma|access-date=2008-11-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705015118/http://www.cqaf.com/theatre_06.htm#|archive-date=2008-07-05|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a popular play, it also proving a good use of this building. There has been much comment about the desire for this building to have a cultural use, given its excellent location and spatial quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/yourplaceandmine/belfast/assembly_rooms.shtml|title=The Exchange and Assembly Rooms|publisher=BBC|accessdate=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A future permanent function of the building is not known publicly.

Late in 2008, the former Northern Bank building has become a city centre location for [http://www.emergallery.com/ The Emer Gallery], an established Belfast gallery which is based near the northern edge of Belfast in the Cavehill vicinity. A large retrospective of the work of [[Armagh]] artist J. B. Vallely was programmed here until early 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/7734490.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; Northern Ireland &amp;#124; Artist's 50-year career honoured |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-11-18 |accessdate=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This exhibition also demonstrated the suitability of the building as a gallery space. The Emer Gallery is named after a female Irish mythological character.

==Laganside Corporation revitalisation==
In recent years, Belfast based public-private body [[Laganside Corporation]] has announced plans to revitalise the area. Their sponsored initiatives have included a 'Managed Workspace' scheme, in which artists are invited to inhabit workshop space owned and refurbished by Laganside. The first such scheme was the refurbishment in 2002 of an old cotton warehouse, named Cotton Court. Other Managed Workspaces are at 23-25 Donegall Street and 9-13 Royal Avenue. It was at this time that Cathedral Quarter was given its name. Such was the popularity of the scheme that many other quarters have subsequently emerged in Belfast, both spontaneously and by design, such as the [[Gaeltacht Quarter]], [[Titanic Quarter]] and [[Queen's Quarter]].

The new-found enthusiasm for the Cathedral Quarter has seen the commitment of a number of private investors, resulting in a number of hotel and bar developments appearing in recent years. Three competing commercial developments are currently in progress in the area. Public investment, mostly on the part of [[Belfast City Council]], has also been apparent. In 2003, the council began a programme of street landscaping that began with laying new paving stones in Hill Street and Talbot Street, and which culminated in the opening in 2004 of Custom House Square, a council-managed public square in front of Belfast's old Custom House building.

==Future plans==
[[Image:Graffiti on North Street Arcade, Donegall Street, Belfast, July 2004.jpg|thumb|250px|[[North Street Arcade]], with graffiti alleging that the 2004 fire was deliberate]]
The extent of private development in the Cathedral Quarter has led to criticism from the area's residents as to the intentions of [[Laganside Corporation]] in the area. A mixture of public and private developments initiatives has resulted in a general groundswell of support for the area, but critics have noted that Cathedral Quarter suffers from a lack of general leadership and accountability. The majority of the land in the area is owned by private developers, and the area fronting Royal Avenue and Donegall Street, which has been earmarked for a development due to open in 2010, was recently center of a controversy between the planners Dunloe-Ewart and coalition of the residents fronted by the Community Arts Forum{{Clarify|date=March 2011}}&lt;!-- ROYAL AVE AND DONEGALL STREET FORM A CORNER, SO WHAT AREA IS BEING REFERRED TO? WHAT WAS THE CONTROVERSY OVER?--&gt;. Eventually, the argument had to be mediated by the [[Northern Ireland Office]], though the N.I.O. have no more of a say in the future of the area as any other party.

Some of these problems may be ironed out when Laganside closes its offices in 2009, when it has promised to split responsibility for its development briefs, including Cathedral Quarter, between the [[Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure]] for Northern Ireland (D.C.A.L., usually pronounced as 'Dee-Kal') and [[Belfast City Council]]. The future of the area in the favour of public ownership over private development is hoped to become clear by a reasonable time after the planned transfer.

Disappointingly, a once touted planned development of ''The Four Corners'' site into a new major arts and entertainment space with cafe and bar provision did not materialise and it seems much of the great potential of such a significant site has not been heeded. Many will have been or are disappointed; the proposed arts development was advertised with illustrations outside the building. This historic Belfast building has been redeveloped as the second hotel in Belfast of the lower mid-price hotel chain, Premier Inn, and includes a large restaurant and bar, as also at Premier Inn, Alfred Street.

In the meantime, it can be seen that Cathedral Quarter has been developing, neither very quickly nor very slowly, into a quite diverse and in part, and at times, lively area, with an attractive variety of eateries and drinking hostelries. The close vicinity to The Merchant Hotel, extending to include the area from Malmaison Hotel, past McHughs Bar, to Mynt Bar and Club, can be one of the liveliest city districts on a weekend night.

The Cathedral Quarter is clearly a developing area of the city. While it has considerable good attractions presently, it is also true that its designation as a cultural quarter may easily lead to an apprehension of a usually busy and significantly developed cultural area of Belfast presently, which may bring some disappointment to visitors.

The good number of established attractions and their collection in this area of spirit and good interest are to any visitor likely to be found as well appreciated, rewarding establishments. The collection here makes the area attractive to residents and visitors certainly, and also assures great potential of the area for sensitive, hopefully unrestricted cultural development. However, presently, the area can also be reasonably quiet, and can seem a fractionally developed, half alive and half neglected world, weekend nights near The Merchant Hotel and the few main city arts festivals times aside.

Many properties in this prime area lie dormant and neglected. The increasing popularity of the quarter is apparent, while there is some development: at this time (mid-Autumn '08) at the junction of Waring Street and Donegall Street, Belfast's second, new Premier Inn hotel has opened, which has connected the public bar ''The Four Corners'' and restaurant attached at street level. It seems that this area is ripe for rapid, sensitive cultural redevelopment.

The Future Belfast web site provides information about developments, completed, in progress and planned, within The Cathedral Quarter. ([http://www.futurebelfast.co.uk/CathedralQuarter.htm Link to Future Belfast Cathedral Quarter web page.])

== The architectural competition ==
In 2006, Belfast's Old Museum Arts Centre arts company and the Northern Ireland Arts Council announced plans to develop a dedicated arts venue for the city on the site of the Talbot Street car park. N.I.A.C. and Belfast City Council provided funds for a temporary arts venue on Hill Street, named 'The Black Box', until the Talbot Street development was finished. Currently referred to as [https://web.archive.org/web/20091003085034/http://www.oldmuseumartscentre.org/about/news.php?news=1 The Metropolitan Arts Centre, or The M.A.C.], the building opened in 2012 following an [[architectural design competition]] managed by [[RIBA Competitions]] where [http://www.hallmcknight.com/projects/1/the-mac Hackett Hall McKnight Architects] were appointed.

The building was nominated for the European Union Prize for Contemporary Architecture – Mies van der Rohe Award and the Design Museum Designs of the Year.

[[File:Chris Mason Artist.jpg|thumb|Australian artist Chris Mason. ]]
'''Chris Mason''' (born 1976) is an Australian artist. Mason resides in [[Melbourne]]. His work is held in several public collections, including those of the [[National Gallery of Australia]] and the [[State Library of Victoria]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thenorthsider.com.au/a-thousand-words-arts-project-australia/|title=A Thousand Words: Arts Project Australia|last=Harper|first=Alli|date=16 December 2015|work=Northsider|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career, themes and style ==
Both Mason's lack of formal training and autism have identified him as one of the key figures within the [[Outsider art|Outsider Art]] category in Australia.  This categorisation is confirmed by his repeated inclusion in Outsider Art exhibitions and fairs, both in Australia and in the USA. However, in recent years his work has also achieved success in more conventional art institutions and has been acquired for major collections at the [[National Gallery of Australia]] and the [[State Library of Victoria]].

Mason cites as a major influence the artist [[Ron mueck|Ron Mueck]],&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=So Far… Eight Artists / Eight Stories|last=Stonehouse|first=Anne|publisher=Arts Project Australia|year=2014|isbn=9780958665971|location=Melbourne, Australia|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with whom his work shares the [[Hyperrealism (visual arts)|Hyperrealist]] style that emerged from [[photorealism]], and whose subject matter is derived from reinterpretations of photographic imagery. His signature depictions of voluptuous women are sourced from images collected from the Internet and various publications; in his search for reference material he aims for women whose dimensions result in the figures being "almost as tall as they are wide," dimensions which he views as "perfect" and "archetypal."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In recent years Mason has developed a tendency towards smaller-scale ceramic pieces and has expressed a strong interest in pursuing taxidermy in his work, which APA Studio Manager James McDonald describes as "a logical next step."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Mason has exhibited at [[Gertrude Contemporary Art Spaces|Gertrude Contemporary]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gertrude.org.au/exhibitions/gallery-11/past-14/the-agents.phps|title=NATHAN GRAY, CHRISTINA HAYES, CHRIS MASON, CHRIS O'BRIEN: THE AGENTS|last=|first=|date=2002|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; c3 Contemporary Art Space&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.c3artspace.com.au/world-in-my-eyes/|title=World In My Eyes|last=|first=|date=2016|website=c3 Contemporary Art Spaces|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Linden New Art.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="102138">The '''Costa–Hawkins Rental Housing Act''' ("Costa–Hawkins") is a [[Law of California|California state law]], enacted in 1995, which places limits on municipal [[rent control]] ordinances. Costa–Hawkins preempts the field in two major ways.&lt;ref&gt;The Act's complexities are abridged and simplified here.&lt;/ref&gt; First, it prohibits cities from establishing rent control over certain kinds of residential units, e.g., [[single family detached homes|single family dwelling]]s and [[condominium]]s, and newly constructed&lt;ref&gt;The 'newly constructed' designation may be more complicated than it appears. Any rental units built after the 1995 Costa-Hawkins Act would be exempt. But also, with regard to cities with existing rent control ordinances, the Act counts as "new construction' any built after that ordinance was enacted. See below the section "Exemptions to rent control".&lt;/ref&gt; [[multi-family residential|apartment units]]; these are deemed exempt. Second, it prohibits "vacancy control", also called "strict" rent control.

If an apartment is under "vacancy control", the city's ordinance works to deny or limit an owner's ability to increase its rent to new [[leasehold estate|tenant]](s). It works this way even in cases where the prior tenant voluntarily vacated the apartment or was evicted for a 'just cause' (such as failure to pay rent). In other words Costa–Hawkins, by now prohibiting "vacancy control" in the above voluntary or 'just cause' circumstances, mandates that cities allow an apartment owner the right to [[renting|rent]] the vacancy at any price (i.e., usually the market price).&lt;ref&gt;The "decontrol" of such "vacancy controlled" rents was phased-in over a three year period starting at the end of 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Act also addresses incidental technical issues, such as, when such rents may be increased on a remaining [[Lease#Sublease|subtenant]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Rent control in California is largely the creation of its [[municipalities]]. This ability of city governments is limited by the federal and state constitutions, as well as federal and state laws.&lt;ref&gt;Here the issue is State of California limits put on its cities. [[United States Constitution|Federal]] and [[Constitution of the State of California|State]] constitutions both establish and limit government power. Cf., the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment]]. Cf., [[John Forrest Dillon#Dillon's Rule|Dillon's Rule]].&lt;/ref&gt; Costa–Hawkins is a key state statute enacted to manage the power of California cities to regulate their rental markets.&lt;ref&gt;The Act also repeals or reforms various California state programs that [[subsidized housing|subsidized]] qualified renters of residential dwellings. These provisions are mentioned below, but are not the focus here. The Act's 3-year phase-in for vacancy decontrol, and these reforms, complicate the language of the [[statute]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See text below for source citations.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Factors causing 1970s rent control==
The late 1970s saw the second wave of [[Rent control in the United States|rent control]] ordinances in California, and nationwide.&lt;ref&gt; The first wave was in the late 1940s, during the economic surge following World War II. Alisa Belinkoff Katz, [http://luskincenter.history.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/66/2018/09/People-Are-Simply-Unable-to-Pay-the-Rent.pdf ''"People are simply unable to pay the rent" What History tells us about Rent Control in Los Angeles''], at ''UCLA Luskin Center for History and Policy'', October 2018. Introduction by [[Zev Yaroslavsky]]. Accessed 2018-11-1. This study covers three rental housing crises and related rent control enactments in Los Angeles: the above post-war, the post-[[California Proposition 13 (1978)|Prop 13]] in 1979, and the current, on-going situation.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The California experience is representative of the range of public responses... ." Keating in Niebanck (1983), p.57.&lt;/ref&gt; Rising [[real estate market|real estate values]] and surging [[Federal funds rate|interest rates]] made single family homes in California less affordable. Disappointed buyers often moved into apartments. A rental housing [[supply and demand|shortage]] appeared, rents went up. For chiefly non-housing reasons (e.g., [[land use]]), cities began restricting the [[Real estate development|building]] of new dwelling units. As prices rose for rental housing properties, [[return on investment]] and [[cash flow]] motivated new landlords with mortgages to raise rents. State and [[Affordable housing|federal low-income housing assistance]] fell. [[Inflation]] was economy-wide, yet [[wages and salaries]] also fell. The [[consumer movement]] and [[California Proposition 13 (1978)|Proposition 13]] effects then stimulated [[Tenement (law)|tenant]] activism in [[Urban politics in the United States|municipal politics]].&lt;ref&gt;Lenvin and Moskovitz [2017], ∮7.8 on factors causing rent control in the 1970s: rising real estate prices for homes and for apartment houses; economy-wide inflation; tight housing markets from short supply and high demand; the consumer movement).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sternlieb and Hughes, in Niebanck (1985), pp. 11–28: rent control by cities "dependent on national market factors" at p.11; own versus rent, and housing supply, at pp. 11–20; private investment in rental housing property, at pp. 25–28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keating, in Niebanck (1985), pp. 57–73, at 57–59 (fall of tenant incomes, rise in rents; the housing shortage: vacancy rates, not enough new construction; low income households and percent spent on rent; housing subsidy cut-backs: fed policy &amp; state budgets; Proposition 13; rent control in California), and at pp. 70–73 (growth and land use restrictions, increased fees and requirements for new housing construction; Proposition 13; very high mortgage interest rates; state budget problems limit its housing remedies; Proposition 13; policy trade-offs).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Niebanck, in Niebanck (1985), pp. 105–122. After analysis of multiple issues in a city's rental economy, including [[market failure|market malfunction]] and two benchmarks (the [[rental vacancy rate|vacancy rate]], and income percentage spent on rent), the [[University of California, Santa Cruz|UCSC]] professor suggests: "A locality's interest in rent control has at least as much to do with underlying cultural, socioeconomic, political, and ideological factors as it has to do with market conditions" at pp. 110–111 (quote).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keating (1983), pp. 3–4. Sponsors of Proposition 13 claimed that tenants would share in the benefits of reduced property taxes. But after it passed, most landlords declined to do so. The legislature refused to heed the tenant protests.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heskin (1983): 1960s rental glut, 1970s fall in housing construction and rise in rents (pp. 32–33, 40–41); Prop. 13 and 'tenant revolt' (pp. xiv, 41, 47–49). Civil rights, [[War on Poverty|anti-poverty]], [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|anti-war]] movements were followed by tenants who organized, first in college towns (p.32). Kerner Commission, p.102.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dreier (1997), Part I, "The Battle for Rent Control" at ¶¶ 8–10. Earlier tenant movements of the 1960s were "spillovers" from the [[civil rights movement|civil rights]], the [[Poor People's Campaign|poor peoples]], and the [[student movement|student]] movements (¶8). He notes (at ¶10) that the [[Kerner Commission]] found that "housing problems among low-income tenants was the primary grievance behind the mid-1960s ghetto rebellions." The National Tenants' Organization, founded in 1969, was for a time widespread across America (¶8).&lt;/ref&gt; 

The issues involved in rent control are complex and compelling, with multiple dimensions: personal, social, economic, political, legal. Often debates and discussions are at risk of provoking a competition between overstatements. Some proponents may call every raise "rent gouging" while some opponents say rent control leads to [[slums]]. "The range of assertions by rent control combatants [can be] astonishing." In the worse case, the "debate becomes a hollow clash of extremes, and the results are an uninformed electorate, rash policy, and a divided community." In 'second generation rent control' the issues have become more articulated, yet still contested.&lt;ref&gt;Niebanck, in Niebanck (1985), pp. 106–107, quotes at 106.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heskin (1983) concludes that the vast majority of tenants remain committed to mainstream views of property ownership (pp. 34, 244, 247). He relied on results from two extensive tenant surveys taken in southern California (pp. xv–xvi, pp. 66–249). UCLA Prof. Heskin in his Preface had declared for the tenant movement, disclosing his work as a [[Legal Services Corporation|Legal Services]] lawyer and pro-tenant law reformer (pp. ix–x, 291). The author here explored the possibility that tenants in the movement, inspired by radical activists, might eventually 'fracture' the ideological norm and favor [[socialism|socializing]] a community's rental housing stock (pp. xii–xiv, 28–34, 239–243; "fracture" at pp. xiv, xviii, xxiii; "polarization" at p.xxiii, cf. 68–76).&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Costa–Hawkins legislation of 1995==

===Political events leading to the Act===
[[File:JerryBrown.png|thumb|right|150px|Jerry Brown, 1976.]]
In 1972 Berkeley became the first California city to adopt a second-wave rent control ordinance. In 1976 Governor [[Jerry Brown]], a Democrat, vetoed state legislation (AB 3788) that would have preempted local rent control laws. It had been supported by a mainstream real estate group, the California Housing Council (CHC). In response to the veto, the real estate industry managed to get an [[initiative]], Proposition 10, on the state ballot for 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Heskin (1083), p.61: "a coalition of [[real estate developers]], [[List of construction trades|building trade]] unions, and [[landlords]]" formed to promote Proposition 10.&lt;/ref&gt; It was soundly defeated, however, 65% to 35%.&lt;ref&gt;Keating (1983), pp. 5–6: Although somewhat similar to Costa–Hawkins, in its details Prop. 10 would have been substantially different, e.g., Prop. 10 mandated that a city could not enact a ''just cause'' requirement for evictions. Re Berkeley 1972 (pp. 3, 4).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heskin (1983): Berkeley, CHC and AB 3788: Brown's veto (pp. 41–43); Prop.10 (pp. 61–63).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the meantime, in June 1978 [[California Proposition 13 (1978)|Proposition 13]] had been approved two to one by California voters. Before the election [[Howard Jarvis]], the leader of the Prop. 13 'taxpayer revolt', as well as of the California Apartment Association, had suggested that landlords would lower rents if Prop. 13 passed. Many voters were said to have thought that Prop. 13, by lowering landlord property taxes, meant lower rents. The CHC, fearful of a tenant backlash if landlords failed to follow through, decided to oppose Prop. 13. Despite post-election efforts by Gov. Brown and the CHC, few landlords lowered their rents.&lt;ref&gt;Dreier (1997), Part II, at section "Rent Control in California", Jarvis at ¶5, CHC and Prop. 13 at ¶¶ 5 and 6b, Proposition 10 at ¶15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keating (1983), pp. 3–4. Proposition 13 proponents: their unfullfilled promise to lower rents inspires tenants to mount a fight for rent control.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heskin (1983), p.47: Jarvis announced agreement between two landlord associations to lower rent if Prop.13 passed; p.48: statewide tenant revolt following Prop. 13 vote and few landlords pass on tax savings to tenants; p.49: landlord costs go up.&lt;/ref&gt;

Across California urban tenants suddenly felt their numbers, formed local groups, which quickly grew in intensity and strength. Tenant activists organized political agitation directed at state and city government. Gov. Brown's new 'tenant hot line' was getting 12,000 calls a day. "In response to tenant pressure, rent strikes, and steady news coverage about rent increases and angry tenants, especially seniors, the [[Los Angeles City Council]] passed a six month rent freeze in August 1978." By 1988, fourteen cities had adopted full rent control, and sixty-four cities rent control for mobile home parks.&lt;ref&gt;Dreier (1997), Part II, at section "Rent Control in California", Governor's 'hot line' at ¶7, fourteen cities at ¶8, Los Angeles quote at ¶9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keating, in Niebanck (1985). After Prop. 13, Los Angeles Mayor [[Tom Bradley (American politician)|Tom Bradley]] moved from opposition into support for rent control. "Tenants then turned to local government for relief via rent control." Fourteen cities. A poll taken in May 1979 had Californians in favor of rent control 56% to 21%, tenants in favor 73% to 20%. At that time 55% of Californians were renters.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heskin (1983), pp. 39, 43–47, 48–49: 1970s growth of tenant movement; p.48: Governor's 'hot line';  pp. 50–55: tenant groups active in Los Angeles, rent freeze becomes rent control; pp.55–61, 63–65: in Santa Monica, Prop. A rent control, tenant majority on city council.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[image:Jim Costa official photo.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Jim Costa, circa 2013, a sponsor of the 1995 Act.]]
The strength of the tenants groups, however, eventually began to dissipate. Yet CHC attempts to partially 'preempt' rent control were thwarted by Democrats, led by State Senator [[David Roberti]], until [[term limit]]s forced his retirement in 1995. On the other hand, Democrat [[Jim Costa]] in the Assembly had unsuccessfully carried 'preemption' bills for the real estate industry since 1983. He was now in the Senate, where his 1995 bill passed the Judiciary Committee; absent Roberti, it drew Democratic votes. The bill then passed the Senate with one vote "more than the majority required."&lt;ref&gt;Dreier (1997), Part II, at section "The Politics of Deregulation in California", Roberti anti-Costa at ¶¶ 2–3, Roberti term limits at ¶¶ 5–7, Costa in Assembly at ¶¶ 1–2, Costa in Senate at ¶¶ 6–9, tenant advocacy weak at ¶3, 9; at section "Rent Control in California", Roberti rent control at ¶3, tenant groups weaken at ¶16; at section "Comparative Analysis," subsection "Weakness and Fragmentation of Tenancy Constituency".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Max Vanzi, [http://articles.latimes.com/1995-07-25/news/mn-27574_1_rent-control-feature "Legislature deals blow to rent control"], in ''The Los Angeles Times'', July 25, 1995. Sen. Jim Costa said the Act represented "an 11-year effort to try to end extreme forms of rent control in California."&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Act: sponsors, and opposition===

[[image:Pete Wilson meeting with Les Aspin, Feb 3, 1993 - cropped to Wilson.JPEG|thumb|125px|Pete Wilson, 1993.]]
The Costa–Hawkins Rental Housing Act became law in 1995. The statute became codified as [[California Civil Code|Civil Code]], §§ 1954.50 to 1954.535.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=CIV&amp;division=3.&amp;title=5.&amp;part=4.&amp;chapter=2.7.&amp;article|title=California Civil Code, 1954.50–1954.535.|publisher=Leginfo.legislature.ca.gov|accessdate=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation's sponsors were Democratic [[California Senate|Senator]] [[Jim Costa]] ([[Fresno, CA|Fresno]]) and Republican [[California Assembly|Assemblymember]] Phil Hawkins ([[Bellflower, CA|Bellflower]]).&lt;ref&gt;Dreier (1997), Part II, section "The Politics of Deregulation in California" at ¶1 &amp; ¶8 re Costa.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Phil Hawkins served one term in the Assembly, 1994–1996, where he "carved out a solidly conservative record on most issues". [http://articles.latimes.com/1998/oct/09/local/me-30727 "Sally Havice (D) v. Phil Hawkins (R)"], in ''The Los Angeles Times'', Oct. 9, 1998. Accessed 2017-11-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Introduced first in the Senate, the text of the legislation later became [[Assembly Bill]] 1164. After enduring several negotiated changes, it had passed in both chambers. The Republican [[Governors of California|Governor]] [[Pete Wilson]] then signed AB 1164 into law.&lt;ref&gt;Cf., [http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/95-96/bill/asm/ab_1151-1200/ab_1164_cfa_950725_172019_asm_floor.html Analyses: AB 1164, Assembly Floor 7/25/95 – DIGEST]. California Legislative Information website.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although understood as limiting rent control, an agenda more favored by Republicans, some Democrats supported the Act. The pro-tenant Western Center on Law and Poverty (WCLP) had endorsed several features of the Bill that served tenant interests: the prohibition of rent increases "if serious health, safety, fire, or building code violations were discovered and not corrected for six months," and some claims by subtenants to lower rent under an existing tenancy.&lt;ref&gt;Max Vanzi, [http://articles.latimes.com/1995-07-25/news/mn-27574_1_rent-control-feature "Legislature deals blow to rent control"], in ''The Los Angeles Times'', July 25, 1995: bill sponsors Phil Hawkins and Jim Costa; legislation quote per WCLP. Accessed 2017-08-28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heskin (1983). On the Los Angeles City Council, black leaders voiced a different view of housing shortages. Earlier [[Robert C. Farrell]] had spoken of the "thousands of vacant and substandard housing units in South Central. ... My constituents want decent housing and a decent rent" (p.51, quoting the ''[[Los Angeles Sentinel|Sentinel]]'', Aug. 10, 1978; also p.75 code violations, pp. 132–133 poor condition of rentals). Nationwide, some owners had abandoned urban rental properties that needed substantial repairs (cf. p.32).&lt;/ref&gt;

The WCLP especially sought to organize the opposition, to "piece together a coalition" of scattered local groups (tenants, senior citizens, religion affiliated), together with California cities with rent control. Accordingly Santa Monica, Berkeley, and West Hollywood contributed funds to hire a lobbyist. A concession obtained was the 3-year phase-in of vacancy decontrol. Yet the [[California State Capitol|capitol]] consensus was that Costa–Hawkins was a "done deal" and the opposition a "last gasp". With defeat and what they viewed as a rollback of some tenant advantages, rent control advocates became uneasy at the challenge to their victories of the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Dreier (1997), Part II, at section "The Politics of Deregulation in California". WCLP in opposition at ¶9 (coalition quote, two phrases quoted). WCLP was "an arm of legal services" (apparently [[Legal Services Corporation|LSC]]).

The Costa–Hawkins legislation is found in the California Civil Code, sections 1954.50 to 1954.535.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=CIV&amp;division=3.&amp;title=5.&amp;part=4.&amp;chapter=2.7.&amp;article|title=California Civil Code, 1954.50–1954.535.|publisher=Leginfo.legislature.ca.gov|accessdate=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://caanet.org/app/uploads/2015/01/Costa-Hawkins-Rental-Housing-Act.pdf "A General Overview of California's Costa–Hawkins Rental Housing Act"], at California Apartment Association website. Accessed 2017-11-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

====In general====
The Act exempts from rent control: single family dwellings, condos, and new construction.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. §1954.52(a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3)(A).&lt;/ref&gt; It prohibits local government regulations re "vacancy control"&lt;ref&gt;For vacancy control issues, see below under section "Effect of the Costa-Hawkins Act".&lt;/ref&gt; in most situations.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. 1954.52(a) and 1954.53(a).&lt;/ref&gt; For the five cities with "vacancy control" in 1995 the Act is phased-in.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. 1954.52(a)(3)(C) and 1954.53(a)(1) &amp; 1954.53(b) &amp; (c).&lt;/ref&gt; It situates government contracts with owners about rent charged (e.g., provisions for low income housing), and the effects of a notice of violation, e.g., about health or safety.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. 1954.52(b), 1954.53(a)(1)(B); &amp; 1954.535, and 1954.53(f).&lt;/ref&gt; Costa–Hawkins also addresses subtenancies,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. 1954.53(b) &amp; (d).&lt;/ref&gt; and other issues.&lt;ref&gt;Cf., [http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/95-96/bill/asm/ab_1151-1200/ab_1164_cfa_950725_172019_asm_floor.html Analyses: AB 1164, Assembly Floor 7/25/95 – DIGEST]. California Legislative Information website. Note: 3-year phase-in (p.3,#2); housing programs repeal (p.2,#5, p.4,#7, p.6,#4).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Exemptions from rent control====
The Act prohibits rent control on single family homes, on [[condominium]]s, and on newly built rental units.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Civil Code, §1954.52.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, 'new' means any building constructed after February 1, 1995 (per the 1995 Costa-Hawkins Act).&lt;ref&gt;Civil Code, §1954.52(a)(1).&lt;/ref&gt; But for cities with existing rent control, 'new' is back-dated per the local rent control ordinance.&lt;ref&gt;Civil Code, §1954.52(a)(2).&lt;/ref&gt;

In those cities the enactment date of rent control determines what is 'new'. Only rental units constructed before then will remain subject to the city's rent control. Those built after will remain exempt under Costa-Hawkins. Hence, in [[San Francisco]] only construction older than 1979 can be rent controlled, and older than 1980 in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] and [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], the years those cities passed their rent control laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | last=Cutler | first=Kim-Mai | title=How Burrowing Owls Lead To Vomiting Anarchists (Or SF's Housing Crisis Explained) | url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/14/sf-housing/ | accessdate=2017-12-11 | publisher=TechCrunch | date=Apr 14, 2014 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140430181957/https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/14/sf-housing/ | archive-date=2014-04-30 | dead-url=no | quote=San Francisco’s version of rent control also does not apply to buildings constructed after 1979,... }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/01/11/california-considers-repealing-rent-control-restrictions/ | title=Rent control in California: Proposal to lift restrictions blocked in committee  | last=Murphy | first=Katy | publisher=San Jose Mercury News | date=2018-01-11 | accessdate=2018-01-28 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180123095807/https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/01/11/california-considers-repealing-rent-control-restrictions/ | archive-date=2018-01-23 | dead-url=no | pages= | quote=Single family homes and condominiums are exempt from rent control under this state law. So is any apartment built after 1995, when Costa Hawkins was passed, or in some cases much earlier.

Accessed 2018-4-30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;So that an apartment building in Los Angeles built in the 1980s and hence exempt as newly built under the City's 1978 rent control ordinance, would not lose its exemption because it was built before the 1995 Costa-Hawkins Act.&lt;/ref&gt;

These exemptions, however, may leave most of a city's total rental stock under rent control. For example, in San Francisco, as of 2014, about 75% of all rental units were rent controlled.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | last=Cutler | first=Kim-Mai | title=How Burrowing Owls Lead To Vomiting Anarchists (Or SF’s Housing Crisis Explained) | url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/14/sf-housing/ | accessdate=2017-12-11 | publisher=TechCrunch | date=Apr 14, 2014 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140430181957/https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/14/sf-housing/ | archive-date=2014-04-30 | dead-url=no | quote=1) First off, understand the math of the region. San Francisco has a roughly thirty-five percent homeownership rate. Then 172,000 units of the city’s 376,940 housing units are under rent control. (That’s about 75 percent of the city’s rental stock.) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2002 Amendment to the Act====
The Act was amended in 2002 to close a loophole related to [[condominium]] conversions after the 1995 Act. Owners of an apartment building may obtain a new certificate of occupancy due to a condo conversion even without then selling any converted units. In such case, the rental units do not become exempt from rent control under the Act.&lt;ref&gt;Civil Code, § 1954.52 (exemptions).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;2002 Amendment discussed in ''Burien'' case, pp. 5–9 &amp; fns. 2 &amp; 3, legislative history at pp. 7-8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.justia.com/cases/california/court-of-appeal/2014/b250182.html ''Burien LCC v. Wiley'' (2009)], at ''JUSTIA US Law''. Accessed 2017-08-22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf., section below "Certificates of Occupancy: ''Burien LLC v. Wiley''".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rent control in California==
Costa-Hawkins is the key state legislation which serves to guide the operative provisions and practice of rent control in California.&lt;ref&gt;Various other state laws impact rental housing, e.g., warranties of habitability, the building codes, rental agreements, unlawful detainer, et cetera.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet it is the local governments, for the most part the cities, which actually write and adopt the specific rent control laws.  

===Legal context===
====Declared purposes====
A local rent control ordinance may explicitly declare its purpose. Stated or implied is the finding, or assumption, that the rent control being enacted will in fact improve the community's well-being. 
  
Usually [[rent control]] is a city-made law (a [[municipal ordinance]]) aimed at mitigating the disruptive effect, on neighborhoods and on individual renters, of escalating or fluctuating prices in the residential rental market. It may also seek to promote the maintenance of safe and habitable dwelling units during housing shortages.&lt;ref&gt;Dreier (1997), Part II, at section "Appendix: Arguments For and Against Rent Control". Discussion of the benefits of rent control as advanced by proponents and the author, and rejoinders to opposition arguments.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keating (1983), esp. at pp. 2–3 and 15–18, for additional proponent views. Keating centers on the preservation of affordable housing during a severe supply shortage, among other issues.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heskin (1983), for additional proponent views, and ideological perspectives. ""Tenancy excludes no group although certainly tenants are more likely to be young, female, minority, and low income in larger proportions than the population taken as a whole" (pp. 93–94).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jake Blumgart, [https://psmag.com/economics/in-defense-of-rent-control "In Defense of Rent Control"], at ''Pacific Standard'', April 1, 2015.

An example of such city intent is [[San Francisco]]'s ''Residential Rent Stabilization and Arbitration Ordinance'' (SFRO), enacted in 1979 as an emergency ordinance amending the San Francisco Administrative Code. It found that, in the face of tight markets and significant rental increases prior to rent control, "some tenants attempt to pay requested rent increases, but as a consequence must expend less on other necessities of life. This situation has had a detrimental effect on substantial numbers of renters in the City, especially creating hardships on senior citizens, persons on fixed incomes and low and moderate income households".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfrb.org/index.aspx?page=1250 "Title and Findings"], quote at ∮ 37.1(b)(2) of The Rent Ordinance, at San Francisco Rent Board website.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cityofberkeley.info/Rent_Stabilization_Board/Home/Ordinance__Rent_Stabilization_and_Eviction_for_Good_Cause.aspx#1376030 "Purpose"], ∮13.76.030 of the Rent Stabilization and Eviction for Good Cause Ordinance, at Rent Stabilization Board, City of Berkeley website.

====Constitutional limits====
[[File:Ronaldreaganstatebuilding.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A site of the [[California Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] on S. Spring St. in Los Angeles.]]
For the [[California State Assembly]] its analyst Stephen Holloway commented on the constitutional and legal context of rent control, specifically between the state and local governments (e.g., cities). When Costa–Hawkins was enacted, existing California law made "no statutory provision for, but does not prohibit, the adoption of local rent control ordinances. Case law, ''Birkenfeld v. City of Berkeley'' (1976) 17 Cal. 3d 129, held that rent control is a proper exercise of a local government's [[Police power (United States constitutional law)|police power]] if it is reasonably calculated to eliminate excessive rents and at the same time provide landlords with just and reasonable returns on their properties."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/95-96/bill/asm/ab_1151-1200/ab_1164_cfa_950725_172019_asm_floor.html Analyses: AB 1164, Assembly Floor 7/25/95 – DIGEST], California Legislative Information website, quote at p.1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://scocal.stanford.edu/opinion/birkenfeld-v-city-berkeley-30384 ''Birkenfeld v.

Here, while elements were found to be unconstitutional, the California Supreme Court held generally that "an emergency is no more necessary for rent control than for other forms of economic regulation which are constitutionally valid". ''Birkenfeld'', opening paragraph.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keating in Niebanck (1985), pp. 66–67 (''Birkenfeld'' case).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lenvin and Moskovitz [2017], ∮7.10 (''Birkenfeld'' case).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf., [http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=GOV&amp;division=1.&amp;title=7.&amp;part=&amp;chapter=3.&amp;article=10.6.

In the 1997 ''Kavanau'' case,&lt;ref&gt;[https://scocal.stanford.edu/opinion/kavanau-v-santa-monica-rent-control-bd-31814 ''Kavanau v. City of Santa Monica Rent Control Bd'' (1997)], at Stanford Law School SCOCAL website. Accessed 2017-11-3.&lt;/ref&gt; a rental property owner challenged the [[City of Santa Monica]]'s rent control law as a form of "taking" or [[inverse condemnation]] prohibited by the federal Constitution.

Accessed 2017-11-3.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[California Court of Appeal]] upheld an ordinance which provided that the city council sitting as a rent board would determine what was fair, just, and reasonable regarding an owner's comparable return on investment. The ordinance did not establish a specific formula or procedure to apply when faced with a requested rent increase, but instead stated eleven factors to consider. Here the board had then relied on an expert's opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Cf., Lenvin and Moskovitz [2017], ∮∮ 7.10 (''Birkenfeld'' case and ''Fisher v. City of Berkeley''), 7.13 (fair return: two ''Fisher'' cases), 7.14 (taking: ''Kavanau'' and ''Berger Foundation'' cases).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Usual provisions===
====Rental amount====
Its chief provisions regulate the dollar amount charged the tenant each month. The political intent of most rent control ordinances, usually the [[sine qua non]], directs the city's attention at the ownership, and limits its ability to raise the rent.

'''Percentage.''' A maximum permitted price increase may be expressed as a percentage of the existing rent. For example, Alameda 5%, Hayward 5%, Los Angeles 3%, Los Gatos 5%.&lt;ref&gt;See ordinances linked below, at "List of California Cities".&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 San Jose lowered the allowable annual rent increase from 8% to 5% of existing rent.&lt;ref&gt;[https://caanet.org/san-jose-approves-stricter-rent-control/ "San Jose approves stricter rent control"], at California Apartment Association website.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 in Beverly Hills by an emergency ordinance, the rent raise maximum plunged from 10% to 3%.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Cornfield, [http://beverlypress.com/2017/02/beverly-hills-extends-emergency-rent-controls/ "Beverly Hills extends emergency rent controls"], in ''Park Labrea News/Beverly Press'', Feb. 22, 2017. 2017-08-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:US Consumer Price Index Graph.svg|thumb|200px|right|[[United States Consumer Price Index|US CPI]] from 1913 (in blue), its percentage annual change (in red)]]
'''CPI.''' Alternatively, rent raise limits may be directly keyed to changes in the [[cost of living]], as measured by the [[Consumer Price Index]] (CPI). Since 1980 in California the CPI has generally been lower than 5%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dir.ca.gov/OPRL/CPI/EntireCCPI.PDF California Consumer Price Index (1955–2017)]. Accessed 2017-10-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of rent control ordinances using CPI as an index: Oakland, Mountain View, Richmond.&lt;ref&gt;See below re such city ordinances linked to websites, at "List of California Cities". ''Au contraire'', East Palo Alto, Palm Springs, Santa Monica, and West Hollywood use only a fraction of CPI.&lt;/ref&gt;  In San Francisco the SFRO limits annual increases to the lesser of 60% of the CPI or 7% of existing rent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfrb.org/index.aspx?page=1252 "Rent limitations"], San Francisco Rent Board.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the Berkeley Rent Board allows an annual increase of 65% of CPI.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityofberkeley.info/Rent_Stabilization_Board/Home/2015_ANNUAL_GENERAL_ADJUSTMENT.aspx "2014 adjustment"], City of Berkeley Rent Stabilization Board.&lt;/ref&gt;

*relocation allowance,

'''Just cause terminations'''. A no-cause (or no-fault) rental termination by the owner is one that '''does not state a "just cause"''' (such as non-payment of rent, or a tenant-created nuisance). A city may require some form of "just cause" be noticed by an owner in order to terminate.&lt;ref&gt;Marcia Stewart, "Rent Control: Evictions in Rent Control Areas", at Nolo Press website.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ramona Giwargis, [http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/04/18/san-jose-city-council-hears-emotional-testimony-ahead-of-rent-protection-vote/ "San Jose City Council approves policy against no-cause evictions"], ''The Mercury News'', April 18, 22017. 2017-08-24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Costa–Hawkins leaves the cities free to regulate tenant evictions.

'''Relocation allowance'''. A city ordinance ''may'' require the owner to pay the departing tenant an allowance for moving and similar expenses, e.g., in event of no-fault termination. Each city has its own specifics. The tenant will not receive such an allowance in the event of "just cause" terminations, where the tenant is at fault (such as non-payment of rent, or creating a nuisance). But an owner's decision to end an existing tenancy (by written notice, by a court's eviction order) without the tenant being at fault, ''might'' trigger an owner's duty to pay the allowance.&lt;ref&gt;Lenvin &amp; Moskovitz (2017), ∮7.76A, payments to tenants, re relocation, e.g., San Francisco Residential Rent Stabilization and Arbitration Ordinance, ∮37.9C.

Pro-rent control arguments are usually adopted by cities when enacting ordinances establishing rent control (see above).&lt;ref&gt;For arguments taken by proponents of rent control, see section "Declared purposes".&lt;/ref&gt;

Original rent control efforts sought to provide the public with affordable housing, but caused a fall in the number of new units being built, thus aggravating the housing shortage. Subsequent rent control laws exempted new construction. Yet such regulation also removes incentives to improve, or even maintain, older housing stock.&lt;ref&gt;Jay Fitzgerald, [https://www.nber.org/digest/oct12/w18125.html "End of Rent Control in Cambridge"], National Bureau of Economic Research.

"[E]vidence indicates that ownership investments in rent-controlled units, including maintenance, upkeep and capital improvements, were lower than investments in non-controlled units" (¶5).&lt;/ref&gt; It encourages owners to convert rentals to condos for sale or to other uses. Rent control laws provide short-term benefits without distinction: what is relief to low-income citizens, is windfall to wealthy renters. In dwelling units where municipal controls have set the rent below market, tenants stay longer, reducing the number of rentals available. Then market rents charged to new tenants go higher: (a) as owners counterbalance their rent-control losses, or (b) as builders of new units price the market demand versus supply.&lt;ref&gt;Beacon Economics, [https://caanet.org/app/uploads/2016/02/Jan2016_Rent_Control_Study.pdf "An Analysis of Rent Control in California"] (Los Angeles 1916), for California Apartment Association.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keating (1983), pp. 14–15: Often the clear alternative to rent control, and best long-range cure for rents that are too-high, is more residential housing being built and coming on the market. Yet in a housing crisis when supply by free enterprise is failing to meet demand, government programs may not be sufficient either, e.g., [[Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008|Federal home finance]], and rental programs such as [[Section 8 (housing)|section 8]], and [[California Department of Housing and Community Development|state mandates]] and [[housing subsidies|subsidies]] for [[affordable housing]]. Keating (1983), p.1: [[San Francisco housing shortage|Housing shortages]] are often due to surges in demand or insufficient supply. Low supply can be caused not only by a local government suppressing the business of rental housing providers, but also by laws restricting the [[real estate development]] of new rental units and/or underfunding of [[public housing in the United States|public housing]].&lt;/ref&gt; In brief, rent control reduces housing supply.&lt;ref&gt;Gilderbloom in Niebanck (1985), pp. 76 &amp; 137,n5. Housing supply is the heart of the tenant's problem. "Nationally known tenants' rights lawyers have spoken forcefully on the matter." Gilderbloom than quotes from Moskovitz, Warner, &amp; Sherman, ''California Tenant's Handbook'' (1972), p.10: "The heart of the tenant's problem is not the laws and regulations (imperfect thought they may be), nor the goodness or badness of landlords (for they, like you, are but human)—no, the heart of the problem is with the supply of housing. It is drastically short."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keating (1985), p.70: "Even the most ardent advocates for rent control generally acknowledge that controls do not constitute a lasting or comprehensive solution to the rental housing problem. They agree on the need for substantial increases in the supply of affordable housing... ."&lt;/ref&gt;

Economic conclusions are subject to interpretation by the public. Rent control that lowers rents for some can work to raise rents for others. Is it to be deemed 'good for society' if the total benefit amount to those favored with lower rents via rent control is cancelled by the program's unintended affect of raising the rent to others? What if its primary effect is merely to redistribute the cost of rent unequally rather than to reduce it overall. Is there an alternative?

The best use of scarce resources would apparently be to "directly subsidize renters with a dramatic expansion of Section 8 vouchers" thus making sure assistance flows only to residents who most need it.

==Effect of the Costa–Hawkins Act==
The ''major'' purposes of the Act were: to eliminate ''vacancy control'' and thereby reestablish an intermittent role for market forces ([[supply and demand]]) in setting the rental price; and, to exempt certain categories of rental units from rent control, e.g., new construction, and single family dwellings and condominiums. The exemption for new units sought to encourage housing supply.&lt;ref&gt;Cf., Lenvin and Moskovitz [2017], ∮∮ 7.4, 7.25 to 7.28A.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dreier (1997), Part II, at section "Consequences of Deregulation".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vacancy control prior to the Act===
[[File:IMAG4098-berkeley-2217-and-2221-dwight.jpg|thumb|250px|Berkeley: Dwight Way rental.]]
Most rent control ordinances (deemed ''moderate'') limit an owner's ability to increase the rent to ''an existing tenant''. Yet some ''strict'' rent control regimes also limited the rent a landlord could charge on the open market, that is, after the apartment became vacant by the voluntary exit of the prior tenant, or vacant by a just-cause eviction. Hence, ''strict'' was also called ''vacancy control''. The controlled rental amount thus became specific not only to a particular tenancy, but also to a specific rental unit.&lt;ref&gt;Cf., Marcia Stewart, "Rent Control: Limits on Rent Control", at ''Nolo Press'' website.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under such a "strict" regime, [[market forces]] are excluded from [[price]] determination (except for exempt categories, such as newly built units). Prior to the enactment of Costa–Hawkins, such strict ''vacancy control'' had existed in five cities: [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]], [[Cotati, California|Cotati]], [[East Palo Alto, California|East Palo Alto]] and [[West Hollywood, California|West Hollywood]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/95-96/bill/asm/ab_1151-1200/ab_1164_cfa_950725_172019_asm_floor.html Analyses: AB 1164, Assembly Floor 7/25/95 – DIGEST], five cities with 'vacancy control' at p.2 and p.4. California Legislative Information website.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rent control elements denied to cities===
Costa–Hawkins preempted local laws to allow 'vacancy decontrol', i.e., it abolished "vacancy control". Accordingly, the Act permits landlords to "establish the initial rental rate for a dwelling or unit" following voluntary departure by the prior tenants or following ''for cause'' evictions.&lt;ref&gt;Civil Code, section 1954.53(a): quote. ''Vacancy decontrol'' also applies to rental units where prior tenants are evicted for cause, e.g., for non-payment of rent, or for nuisance.&lt;/ref&gt; For cities then with vacancy control, this preemption started the process of "vacancy decontrol" which was phased-in over three years. Accordingly, on January 1, 1999, it went into full effect.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cityofberkeley.info/Rent_Stabilization_Board/Home/FAQs_Vacancy_Decontrol.aspx "Vacancy Decontrol"], Rent Stabilization Board, City of Berkeley.

Accessed 2017-10-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act additionally exempted from municipal rent control certain kinds of dwelling units, namely, "separately alienable" units, i.e., [[Single-family detached home|single family houses]] and [[condominium]]s. The Act also exempted new construction, i.e., dwelling units with a [[certificate of occupancy]] issued after February 1, 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=CIV&amp;division=3.&amp;title=5.&amp;part=4.&amp;chapter=2.7.&amp;article|title=California Civil Code, 1954.50–1954.535.|publisher=Leginfo.legislature.ca.gov|accessdate=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See above, "The Act's provisions as codified".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rent control elements retained by cities===
The power to determine most of the elements of rent control (mentioned above) were left to the cities by the Act. Cities remain in control of changes to the rental amount of a tenancy, under constitutional limits.&lt;ref&gt;For the "just and reasonable returns" standard, see above section "Constitutional limits".&lt;/ref&gt; Cities possess a substantive jurisdiction to regulate evictions, and an owner's ability to otherwise end a tenancy.&lt;ref&gt;Levrin &amp; Moskovitz (2017), ∮7.25: the Act per Civil Code ∮1954.53(e) "allows public entities to control the grounds for evictions from rent controlled properties."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''West's Cal Jur 3d'', v.42, p.276: Costa Hawkins does not impair the authority of local government to monitor and regulate  the grounds for an eviction.

==Court interpretations of Costa–Hawkins==
In the two decades the Act has been on the books, a number of lawsuits have been filed citing it. Of those appealed, some became written case law. The 2009 ''Palmer'' case 'unexpectedly' upset local laws for inclusionary zoning per rental units. A few other cases are also discussed here. There remain questions about how to apply the Costa–Hawkins statute within the larger legal framework, e.g., its possible interaction with various, adjacent state statutes, and with varieties of municipal rent control and other ordinances.

===''Palmer'' (2009): rentals in inclusionary housing===
===='New construction' exemption applies====
In ''Palmer/Sixth Street Properties LP v. City of Los Angeles'' (2009),&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13698126938858893450&amp;q=Palmer/sixth+street+properties+LP+v.+City+of+Los+Angeles&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2006&amp;as_vis=1 ''Palmer/Sixth Street Properties LP v. City of Los Angeles''], at Google Scholar. Accessed 2017-10-25.&lt;/ref&gt; the issue involved how to apply Costa–Hawkins to an inclusionary housing ordinance of the City of Los Angeles. [[Inclusionary housing]] laws (also called inclusionary zoning) apply to the construction of new multi-unit developments and seek to mandate the inclusion of some [[affordable housing|affordable units]] with [[price controls]], along with a larger number of units to be sold on the [[free market]]. About one-third of California cities and counties have inclusionary zoning ordinances. Such laws might require, beside affordable units for sale, units for rent. In this case, a Los Angeles housing ordinance in effect mandated that sixty ''rentals'' for low-income tenants be included in [[Geoffrey Palmer (real estate developer)|Geoff Palmer]]'s 350-unit development west of downtown.&lt;ref&gt;Called ''Piero II'', on Wilshire Blvd. adjacent to the 110 Fwy., cf. [https://www.thepiero.com ''The Piero''], at its commercial website. Accessed 2011-10-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[California Courts of Appeal|appellate court]] held, however, that the exemption from rent control of new construction under Costa–Hawkins applied to the particular facts of this case. Thus the city could not enforce its housing mandate against the [[real estate developer]].&lt;ref&gt;Lenvin &amp; Moskovitz (2017), ''Palmer'' case at ∮7.25, p.7-45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barclay &amp; Gray (2014), ''Palmer'' case, pp. 434–435.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cp-dr.com/articles/node-2401 "Court rules LA inclusionary housing mandate violates state law"], in ''California Planning and Development Report'' [C P &amp; D R], Aug. 20, 2009. 2017-08-28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf.

====2013 bill to restore inclusionary rentals====
The ''Palmer'' case thus removed rentals from the usual formula of inclusionary housing. Critics claimed, however, that the appellate court's opinion was "widely viewed as a misapplication of the Costa–Hawkins Act to a situation it was never meant to address." It sparked a political response in 2013 that aimed to adjust the Act. Accordingly, Assembly Bill 1229 was passed by the California legislature "to re-establish the legitimacy of affordable housing requirements for rentals."&lt;ref&gt;Andrew L. Faber, Berliner Cohen, [https://www.cacities.org/Resources-Documents/Member-Engagement/Professional-Departments/City-Attorneys/Library/2014/2014-Annual/9-2015-Annual-Andrew-Faber-Inclusionary-Housing-Re.aspx "Inclusionary Housing Requirements: Still Possible?"] (California League of Cities 2014), at p.7: two quotes (misapplication, AB 1229).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;HansonBridgett, [http://www.cacities.org/getattachment/56eaeb68-eae4-4eda-bde4-f7d84da1236d/Palmer-v-City-of-Los-Angeles-Letter-in-Support-of.aspx "Letter Brief" per ''Palmer'' case], pp. 5–6, 7–9, 10–12 (Sept. 9, 2009).

====Governor Brown's 2013 veto message====
In October 2013 [[Governors of California|Governor]] [[Jerry Brown]] vetoed the bill. He said, "As [[Mayor of Oakland]] I saw how difficult it can be to attract developments to low and middle income communities. Requirements to developers to include below-market units in their projects can exacerbate these challenges, even while not meaningfully increasing the amount of affordable housing in a given community."

Advocates of [[affordable housing]] felt stymied. Yet there were alternatives that avoided the exemption for new construction under Costa–Hawkins: "the builder receives either financial assistance" or other valuable consideration such as a density bonus, and "agrees by contract with the city to restrict rents."&lt;ref&gt;Andrew L. Faber, Berliner Cohen, [https://www.cacities.org/Resources-Documents/Member-Engagement/Professional-Departments/City-Attorneys/Library/2014/2014-Annual/9-2015-Annual-Andrew-Faber-Inclusionary-Housing-Re.aspx "Inclusionary Housing Requirements: Still Possible?"] (California League of Cities 2014), at p.7: two quotes (Brown's veto, the builder); at p. 9: The authors comment about Bay Area cities using money from "a straight fee to support affordable housing construction, instead of an in lieu fee... [T]he city can presumably work around the ''Palmer'' case by using the money for either for-sale or rental units, since ''Palmer'' would not apply to a city- subsidized project (or where the city is a lender and negotiates terms of the loan to include affordability)."

The legislature in 2017 approved a bill (AB 1505) that modified the court's ruling in ''Palmer''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB1505 AB 1505 [text].

This letter describes AB 1505 in favorable terms as the fix for the 2009 ''Palmer'' case, in that the bill restores to cities their prior discretion re inclusionary ''rental'' housing in new developments. In addition to the California Housing Consortium, supporters included California Rural Legal Assistance Foundation, Housing California, Non-Profit Housing Association of Northern California, and Western Center on Law and Poverty.&lt;/ref&gt; This bill restores to local governments the ability to require inclusionary ''rental'' housing for low income households, hence in effect setting their rent amount.

===Certificate of occupancy: ''Burien LLC v. Wiley''===
In 2014 the California Court of Appeals clarified the Act's provision concerning a rent-control exemption based on a "certificate of occupancy issued after February 1, 1995."&lt;ref&gt;Civil Code, §1954.52(a)(1).&lt;/ref&gt; The provision was held to apply only to certificates of occupancy that preceded the residential use of the unit.&lt;ref&gt;http://costa-hawkins.com/surreal-estate/burien-llc-v-wiley-cal-court-of-appeal-2nd-appellate-dist-5th-div-2014/&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Burien, LCC v. James A. Wiley'' the Landlord contended that this Costa–Hawkins exemption applies to buildings converted from apartments to condominiums (both residential uses), when a new certificate is issued for the latter. The court reasoned that the purpose of the statute's exemption is to promote construction and development that increase the supply of rental housing, not to promote token reclassification without such a result. "We conclude that section 1954.52, subdivision (a)(1), refers to certificates of occupancy issued prior to residential use of the unit."&lt;ref&gt;''Burien'' case, at p.2 (quote), cf. pp. 7 &amp; 8, and p.10.

===''Mosser'' rule: children per 'vacancy control'===
[[File:3 Cable Car on Hyde St with Alcatraz, SF, CA, jjron 25.03.2012.jpg|thumb|right|150px|upright|San Francisco.]]
In January 2015, the First District Court of Appeals decided that, while Costa–Hawkins allows a landlord to establish a new rental rate where the "original occupants" on the lease no longer permanently reside at the premises, this decontrol was '''not''' available to the landlord where a minor child, who moved in with his parents at the commencement of the lease, remained there after they had vacated. In ''Mosser Companies v. San Francisco Rent Stabilization and Arbitration Board'',&lt;ref&gt;http://costa-hawkins.com/uncategorized/will-mosser-companies-v-city-and-county-of-san-francisco-prompt-another-amendment-to-costa-hawkins/&lt;/ref&gt; the appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment. Commentary on the case states that Costa–Hawkins, "as written, does not permit vacancy decontrol until all lawful occupants vacate the premises." This, despite the landlord's argument that this constituted an intergenerational tenancy of a rent-controlled premises.&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.justia.com/cases/california/court-of-appeal/2015/a141134.html ''Mosser Co. v. San Francisco Rent Stabilization and Arbitration Bd.''] (quote), at ''JUSTIA US Law''. Accessed 2017-08-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Mosser'' rule was then expanded in July 2015 by the First District Court of Appeals, in ''T &amp; A Drolapas v. San Francisco Residential Rent Stabilization and Arb. Bd.''.&lt;ref&gt;http://costa-hawkins.com/surreal-estate/first-district-court-of-appeals-highly-committed-to-mosser-companies-opinion-in-t-a-drolapas-sons-l-p-v-ccsf/&lt;/ref&gt; This decision dealt with similar facts (a landlord attempting to raise the rent of the son of original lessees who had moved out). The court first found that, as the family had moved in prior to the enactment of Costa–Hawkins, even if the son was merely a subtenant, he would have been ''grandfathered in''. Such a "subtenant" could be an "original occupant". The court, however, went on to find that he was also an original occupant under the ''Mosser'' rule, even though, unlike in ''Mosser'', there was no evidence that the landlord knew about the son when the tenancy commenced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.justia.com/cases/california/court-of-appeal/2015/a139432.html ''T &amp; A Drolapas, and Sons, LP v.

===''Mak'': "Just cause" notice &amp; 'vacancy control'===
In the September 2015 case ''Jason Mak v. City of Berkeley Rent Stabilization Board'',&lt;ref&gt;http://costa-hawkins.com/bay-area/evidentiary-presumption-in-berkeley-rent-ordinance-punishes-landlords-who-fake-owner-move-ins/&lt;/ref&gt; the First District Court of Appeals interpreted Costa–Hawkins in the context of an evidentiary [[presumption]] in Berkeley's rent ordinance that presumes that, where a tenant has moved out after a termination notice, the tenant moved out ''because'' of the notice. One accepted way for a landlord to take possession of a rental unit is to use an "owner move-in" eviction, which is recognized as "just cause" to terminate a rent-controlled tenancy. Of course, the landlords are then required to move in and make the rental unit their residence for some minimum period (e.g., 36 continuous months). In such event, the Costa–Hawkins Act will thereafter decontrol the unit, i.e., allow it to be rented at market rate. Such decontrol is limited to "just cause" terminations, or where the prior tenant freely decides to moves out. The owner cannot, therefore, without "just cause" initiate the termination of a rent-controlled tenancy, then rent it at market rate to a new tenant.&lt;ref&gt;Marcia Stewart, "Rent Control: Evictions in Rent Control Areas", at Nolo Press website.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Civil Code, sections 1954.52(a), and 1954.53(a).&lt;/ref&gt;

The landlord in ''Mak'' served the tenant a notice of termination for an 'owner move-in'. But the landlord [[rescind]]ed the notice, then entered into an move-out agreement with the tenant, in which the tenant recited that he was not moving out because of the prior notice. The landlord, however, did not move-in, but instead rented the premises to a new tenant. The Berkeley ordinance in question, when applied to these facts, raised the presumption that the prior tenant moved out because of the owner move-in notice. The landlords were not able to [[rebuttable presumption|rebut this presumption]] when their new tenants challenged the validity of their market-rate rent. Accordingly, the vacant unit was still linked to the amount of the previous controlled rent, a situation to which the new tenants were entitled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.justia.com/cases/california/court-of-appeal/2015/a143671.html ''Mak v.

==Recent events in California==
===Shortage of affordable housing, &amp; HAA===
The housing cycle that began with the crisis of the 1970s and 1980s has apparently come full circle. A housing shortage has recurred and apparently reached the crisis stage (See: [[California housing shortage]]).  In a 2014 California treatise on [[real estate development]], the authors opined that "[C]ommunities across California continue to confront the challenge posed by a scarcity of housing, particularly of affordable housing. In the last several decades, housing production in the state has lagged behind population and job growth, resulting in a housing deficit. ... While all citizens feel the impact of this housing shortage at some level, those with incomes at the lowest end of the economic spectrum of often bear the brunt of the shortage."&lt;ref&gt;Barclay &amp; Gray (2014), p.409 (quote).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hcd.ca.gov/policy-research/plans-reports/docs/California's-Housing-Future-Main-Document-Draft.pdf "California's Housing Future.

====By initiative: Prop 10==== 
On October 23, 2017, the Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment (ACCE) filed papers with the state Attorney General for a [[Initiatives and referendums in the United States|ballot measure]] which would repeal wholesale the 1995 Costa–Hawkins Act. ACCE calls the current rents across California too high, and out of control. To qualify for a November 2018 vote by the public, 365,880 signatures are said to be required.&lt;ref&gt;[https://oag.ca.gov/system/files/initiatives/pdfs/17-0041%20%28Affordable%20Housing%29_0.pdf "Initiative proposal ''Affordable Housing Act''"], at Initiative coordinator, Attorney General's Office, Oct. 23, 2017.

According to Brinklow, ACCE suggested that “median rents are higher in California than any other state in the country.” Brinklow agrees that it’s true by many measures, but writes that Hawaii's is highest, where "the median price on a single bedroom home is $1,500/month, to California’s $1,410."&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents announced in late April that they have enough signatures to qualify an initiative to repeal Costa Hawkins.&lt;ref&gt;Elijah Chiland, [https://la.curbed.com/2018/4/23/17270880/costa-hawkins-repeal-california-rent-control-garcetti "Tenant groups say they have enough signatures for repeal of Costa Hawkins repeal measure"], in ''Curbed Los Angeles'', April 23, 2018.

Accessed 2018-4-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Its supporters named it the "Affordable Housing Act". The initiative was Proposition 10 on the General Election ballot of November 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/ballot-measures/qualified-ballot-measures/ |title=Qualified Statewide Ballot Measures |year=2018 |publisher=[[Secretary of State of California]] |access-date=August 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See above "Rent Control in California" for views of proponents of rent control in section "Declared purposes", and for views of its opponents in "Opposition".&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 6, Prop 10 was decisively defeated, reported the ''Los Angeles Times''; it endorsed the measure. The preliminary results with 100% of precincts reporting: 38% or 2,675,378 voted for, and 62% or 4,310,298 voted against.&lt;ref&gt;Liam Dillon, [http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-midterm-election-day-updates-hold-proposition-10-rent-control-1541029296-htmlstory.html "California voters reject Prop. 10"], ''Los Angeles Times'', November 6, 2018. Accessed 2018-11-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carol Galante, a professor of urban policy at UC Berkeley’s Terner Center for Housing Innovation postulated that Prop 10 may have been defeated because it would have opened the door for government regulation of rents on single-family homes; because 40% of the rental housing stock nationwide consists of single-family homes (predominantly owned by private individuals), this resulted in a large number of owners with the ability to vote against this proposition.&lt;ref name=SJMN_RC_failed &gt; {{ cite news | url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/11/06/californias-rent-control-measure-defeated/ | doi= | title=California’s rent-control measure defeated | last=Murphy | first=Katy | publisher=''[[San Jose Mercury News]]'' | date=2018-11-06 | accessdate=2018-11-25 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181117055416/https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/11/06/californias-rent-control-measure-defeated/ | archive-date=2018-11-17 | dead-url=no | pages= | quote=&lt;blockquote&gt;One factor that likely weighed heavily against Prop. 10 is the sheer number of property owners who rent out — or might one day consider renting — their single-family homes, which are currently exempt from rent caps, said Carol Galante, a former Obama administration housing official who now is professor of affordable housing and urban policy at UC Berkeley’s Terner Center for Housing Innovation. Nationally, Galante noted, 37 percent of the rental housing stock consists of single-family homes. “That puts lots of pressure on the situation,” she said. “You’ve got a large number of owners of that rental stock, and you have more people who would be concerned about price controls.” &lt;/blockquote&gt; }} &lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Cupid''''' was a sculpture created by Renaissance artist
[[Michelangelo]], which he artificially aged to make it look like an antique on the advice of Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco. It was this sculpture which first brought him to the attention of patrons in [[Rome]]. The work is now lost.&lt;ref&gt;Entry on "Cupid," ''The Classical Tradition'' (Harvard University Press, 2010), p. 245; Stefania Macioe, "Caravaggio and the Role of Classical Models," in ''The Rediscovery of Antiquity: The Role of the Artist'' (Collegium Hyperboreum, 2003), pp. 437–438.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Sleeping Cupid''==
In 1496, Michelangelo made a sleeping [[cupid]] figure and treated it with acidic earth to make it seem ancient. He then sold it to a dealer, Baldassare del Milanese, who in turn sold it to [[Raffaele Riario|Cardinal Riario of San Giorgio]] who later learned of the fraud and demanded his money back. However, Michelangelo was permitted to keep his share of the money.&lt;ref name="aaa"&gt;{{cite web|author=Sheila Gibson Stoodley |url=http://www.artsandantique.net/Articles/Miscellaneous/Featured-Misadventures-in-Collecting.asp |title=Misadventures in Collecting |publisher=''Arts and Antiques'' |date=August 2008 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/hoax/archive/permalink/michelangelos_cupid/ |title= Michelangelo's Cupid |publisher= Museum of Hoaxes |accessdate= 2010-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Michelangelo offered to take the sculpture back from Baldassarre, the latter refused, saying he would rather destroy it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Rona Goffen |title= Renaissance rivals:  Michelangelo, Leonardo, Rafael, Titian |publisher= Yale University Press |year= 2004 |page= 409, note 83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Cupid'' was a significant work in establishing the reputation of the young Michelangelo, who was about 20 years old at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Parker, ''Michelangelo and the Art of Letter Writing'' (Cambridge University Press, 2010), p. 11; Rona Goffen, ''Renaissance Rivals: Michelangelo, Leonardo, Raphael, Titian'' ([[Yale University Press]], 2002, 2004), p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; The sculpture was later donated by [[Cesare Borgia]] to [[Isabella d'Este]], and was probably collected by [[Charles I of England]] when all the [[House of Gonzaga|Gonzaga]] collections were bought and taken to [[London]] in the seventeenth century.&lt;ref name="aaa" /&gt;

In 1698, the ''Cupid'' was probably destroyed in the great fire in the [[Palace of Whitehall]], [[London]].&lt;ref name="aaa" /&gt;

==''Standing Cupid''==
Another sculpture of Cupid, in a standing position, was created for Riario's banker, Jacopo Galli.&lt;ref&gt;Umberto Baldini, ''Michelangelo scultore'', Rizzoli, Milano 1973, pp. 90-91.&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Descent'''" is an episode of ''[[The Outer Limits (1995 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'' television show. It first aired on 25 June 1999, during the fifth season.

==Opening narration==
{{cquote|''What makes us human? Is it our basic instincts or our noble aspirations? Are we slaves to our genetics or masters of our fate?''}}

==Plot==
Shy, unassertive researcher Dr. Arthur Zeller ([[Leland Orser]]) routinely admires a [[Homo erectus]] display in the [[Life Sciences]] department of his university and daydreams about what it would be like if he could only unlock the animal within him. It turns out his real life is that of a pushover, a "doormat" for his co-workers. Even a bum shakes him down regularly for "lunch money". All his brilliance and scientific accomplishments take a backseat to his meek personality and no one seems to take him seriously. One of his only solaces is his love of the classical works of a favored composer. He begins to try to make his dreams a reality by developing a kind of [[gene therapy]] which involves injecting himself with the genes for dominance extracted from primitive [[primate]]s. This starts changing his entire personality. Zeller suffers from occasional lapses in which he reverts to the mind of a [[caveman]] and attacks his boss ([[John Novak]]), and kills and eats a dog.

Unfortunately, the changes may improve his life on many levels but they are doing nothing for his love life. His affection towards his co-worker Dr. Laura White ([[Jenny Levine]]) remains unrequited and so he decides to tip the scales. During a routine flu shot session, he surreptitiously injects Laura with the genes for submissiveness. The injection has severe side effects for Laura because her basic personality is not submissive at all, so she starts to pass out. Arthur takes her to his place and attempts to attack her, but regains control of his senses and begs her for help.

He tells her what he has been up to and the shocked Laura decides to help him develop a way of reversing the process. Together they come up with an experimental antidote, but things go really bad when he reveals to Laura that he had injected her with the submissiveness genes.

Seeing that he has blown his chance with her forever, Arthur escapes into the night with a batch of his syringes. Laura has a change of heart and follows him to offer her help, but it's too late for Arthur who had already injected himself with a megadose of the ape genes. She desperately tries to appeal to his humanity with his favorite classical music, but he smashes the tape player; he rejects his thinking, brilliant mind and only wants to feel the senses of his primitive self.

Arthur has now permanently become a caveman in both mind and physical form, finding some food out in the wilderness. However, his primitive mind is unable to comprehend that he is not in fact outdoors, but now living inside the very Homo erectus display he so admired. In her work clothes, Laura watches him in silence on the other side of the glass, then sadly turns and walks away.

'''Dušan T. Bataković''' ({{lang-sr-Cyrl|Душан Т. Батаковић}}; 23 April 1957 – 27 June 2017) was a Serbian [[historian]] and [[diplomat]]. His specialty was modern and contemporary Serbian and [[Balkan]] history. The last post he held was that of Director of the [[Institute for Balkan Studies (Serbia)|Institute for Balkan Studies]] at the [[Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]].

==Biography==
Bataković graduated with a degree in [[history]] from the  [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Philosophy]] in 1982. He holds an M.A. in history from the same institution (1988). He received his Ph.D. in history from the [[University of Paris IV: Paris-Sorbonne]] in 1997 with the thesis ''La France et la formation de la démocratie parlementaire en Serbie 1830-1914'' (France and the Formation of Parliamentary Democracy in Serbia, 1830-1914).

Bataković is a specialist for nineteenth- and twentieth-century Balkan history, as well as for the [[French-Serbian relations]]. He has written and published extensively on the modern and contemporary history of Serbia, in particular [[Kosovo–Serbia relations|Kosovo]] and [[Albania–Serbia relations]], focusing on [[nationalism]], and the origins of religious and ethnic strife. Another area of his research is the impact of [[communism]] on the contemporary history of [[Serbia]], [[Yugoslavia]] and the [[Balkans]]. Bataković writes in Serbian, English and French and his bibliography includes dozens of historical monographs, edited volumes and more than a hundred articles published in various languages.

Bataković is also the author of the historical TV [[Documentary film|documentary]] ''Crveno doba'' (The Red Epoch), which aired on Serbia's public broadcaster, [[Radio Television of Serbia|RTS]], in 2004. Combining testimonies of witnesses with historic narrative the film was the first to open the question of the crimes of the communist Yugoslav authorities (the "[[red terror]]") against their political and class enemies in post-[[World War II]]  [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]] (1944-1947).

In October 2005 Bataković became Director of the [[Institute for Balkan Studies (Serbia)|Institute for Balkan Studies]] of the [[Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]] and editor-in-chief of the Institute’s annual ''Balcanica'' journal as well as of its ''Special editions''. In October 2008 he was elected president of the Serbian Committee of AIESEE (''Association Internationale d'Etudes du Sud-Est Europeen'').

In 2010 Bataković was elected fellow of the [[World Academy of Art and Science]](WAAS).

Parallel to his academic life, Dušan T. Bataković has also pursued a career in politics and diplomacy. As the president of the Council for Democratic Changes in Serbia (a pro-democracy [[NGO]]), he campaigned against [[Slobodan Milošević]] 
in the late 1990s. From 2001 to 2005 he served as Ambassador of the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] (later [[Serbia and Montenegro]]) to the [[Hellenic Republic]]. In July 2005 he became Advisor for political issues to the [[President of Serbia]] [[Boris Tadić]]. In that capacity he became a member, in November 2005, of the Serbian negotiating team at the [[UN]]-sponsored talks on the future status of the province of [[Kosovo]] in [[Vienna]]. He was a head of the Serbian Delegation at the [[International Court of Justice]], regarding the advisory opinion on Kosovo status (2009-2011).

Bataković was appointed [[List of Ambassadors from Serbia|Ambassador of Serbia]] to [[Canada]] in July 2007 and [[Serbian Embassy, Paris|Ambassador of Serbia in Paris]], [[France]] in January 2009, where he took office in March 2009 and has completed his mandate in December 2012.

Bataković was reelected Director of the Institute for Balkan Studies of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts in February 2013.

== Criticism ==
In 2006, a study by Frederick Anscombe looked at issues surrounding scholarship on Kosovo which noted that in the 1980s and 1990s Dušan Bataković from a nationalistic perspective published nationalist works on Kosovo that gained generous support.&lt;ref name="Anscombe761"/&gt; Of those were works such as ''The Kosovo Chronicles'' (1992) and ''Kosovo, la spirals de la haine'' (1993) and in all several of those works have been translated into other languages.&lt;ref name="Anscombe761"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anscombe|first=Frederick|title=The Ottoman Empire in Recent International Politics - II: The Case of Kosovo|jstor=40109813|journal=The International History Review|volume=28|issue=4|year=2006|pages=761|ref=harv}} "Even if some Serbian historians have not promoted a consciously nationalistic view, history as practised in Serbia has observed the constraints imposed by state-sponsored nationalism. As suggested in Part I, nation-building states in former Ottoman territories have used their influence over education, support for and dissemination of research, and the media to draw implicit, and sometimes explicit, boundaries for acceptable historical interpretation. Minor variations on the established narrative may be allowed, but even less overtly ideological historians remain chroniclers of the nation. As in most other post-Ottoman states, few historians in Serbia are able to read Ottoman texts: the focus of their research is confined to Serbs and Serbian lands under 'the Turks'. In the 1980s and 1990s, overtly nationalist Serbian scholars such as Dušan Bataković received the most generous support for the publication of their work. [2] The focus of much of such nationalist history was Kosovo. Footnote: [2] Bataković wrote a series of nationalist works on Kosovo, of which several (''The Kosovo Chronicles'' [Belgrade, 1992] and ''Kosovo, la spirals de la haine'' [Paris, 1993]) have been translated into other languages."&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anthropology}}
'''Ecological anthropology''' is a sub-field of [[anthropology]] and is defined as the "study of [[cultural adaptation]]s to environments".&lt;ref name="Kottak"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kottak|first=Conrad Phillip|title=Anthropology : appreciating human diversity|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-811699-5|pages=579–584|edition=14th}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sub-field is also defined as, "the study of relationships between a population of humans and their [[biophysical environment]]".&lt;ref name="Townsend"&gt;{{cite book|last=Townsend|first=Patricia K.|title=Environmental anthropology : from pigs to policies|year=2009|publisher=Waveland Press|location=Prospect Heights, Ill.|isbn=978-1-57766-581-6|pages=104|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The focus of its research concerns "how cultural [[beliefs]] and practices helped human populations adapt to their environments, and how people used elements of their [[culture]] to maintain their [[ecosystems]]".&lt;ref name="Kottak"/&gt; Ecological anthropology developed from the approach of [[cultural ecology]], and it provided a [[conceptual framework]] more suitable for [[scientific inquiry]] than the cultural ecology approach.&lt;ref name="Moran"&gt;{{cite book|last=Moran|first=Emilio F.|title=People and nature : an introduction to human ecological relations|year=2006|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Malden, MA|isbn=978-1-4051-0572-9|pages=31–32|edition=3. [repr.].}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research pursued under this approach aims to study a wide range of human responses to [[environmental problems]].&lt;ref name="Moran"/&gt;

== History of the domain and leading researchers ==

In the 1960s, ecological anthropology first appeared as a response to cultural ecology, a sub-field of anthropology led by [[Julian Steward]].  Steward focused on studying different modes of subsistence as methods of [[energy transfer]] and then analyzed how they determine other aspects of culture.  Culture became the [[unit of analysis]].  The first ecological anthropologists explored the idea that humans as ecological [[population]]s should be the unit of analysis, and culture became the means by which that population alters and adapts to the environment.  It was characterised by [[systems theory]], [[Structural functionalism|functionalism]] and [[negative feedback]] analysis.&lt;ref name="Conrad"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kottak|first=Conrad P.|title=The New Ecological Anthropology|journal=American Anthropologist|date=March 1999|volume=101|issue=1|pages=23–35|jstor=683339|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|doi=10.1525/aa.1999.101.1.23|url=https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/66329/1/aa.1999.101.1.23.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[http://www.des.ucdavis.edu/faculty/orlove/orlove.htm Benjamin S. Orlove] has noted that the development of ecological anthropology has occurred in stages. "Each stage is a reaction to the previous one rather than merely an addition to it".&lt;ref name="Orlove"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Orlove|first=Benjamin S.|title=Ecological Anthropology|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|year=1980|volume=9|pages=235–273|jstor=2155736|doi=10.1146/annurev.an.09.100180.001315}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first stage concerns the work of Julian Steward and [[Leslie White]], the second stage is titled '[[neofunctionalism]]' and/or '[[neoevolutionism]]', and the third stage is termed 'processual ecological anthropology'.&lt;ref name="Orlove"/&gt; During the first stage, two different models were developed by both White and Steward.  "The distinction is not as rigid as some critics have made it out to be, White's models of [[cultural evolution]] were [[unilinear]] and monocausal, whereas Steward admitted a number of different lines of [[cultural development]] and a number of different causal factors.&lt;ref name="Orlove"/&gt; During the second stage, it was noted that the later group agreed with Steward and White, while the other disagreed. 'Neoevolutionists' borrowed from the work of [[Charles Darwin]]. The general approach suggested that "evolution is progressive and leads towards new and better forms in succeeding periods".&lt;ref name="Orlove"/&gt; 'Neofunctionalists' "see the social organization and culture of specific populations as functional adaptations which permit the populations to exploit their environments successfully without exceeding their carrying capacity".&lt;ref name="Orlove"/&gt; 'Processual ecological anthropology' is noted to be new. Studies based on this approach "seek to overcome the split in the second stage of ecological anthropology between excessively short and long time scales".&lt;ref name="Orlove"/&gt; The approach more specifically, examines "shifts and changes in individual and group activities, and they focus on the mechanism by which behavior and external constraints influence each other".&lt;ref name="Orlove"/&gt;

One of the leading practitioners within this sub-field of anthropology was [[Roy Rappaport]]. He delivered many outstanding works on the relationship between culture and the natural environment in which it grows, especially concerning the role of [[ritual]] in the processual relationship between the two. He conducted the majority, if not all, of his fieldwork amongst a group known as the [[Maring (Papua New Guinea)|Maring]], who inhabit an area in the highlands of [[Papua New Guinea]].&lt;ref name="Townsend"/&gt;

[[Patricia K. Townsend]]'s work highlights the difference between ecological anthropology and [[environmental anthropology]]. In her view, some anthropologists use both terms in an interchangeable fashion.  She states that, "Ecological anthropology will refer to one particular type of research in environmental anthropology – field studies that describe a single ecosystem including a human population".&lt;ref name="Townsend"/&gt;  Studies conducted under this sub-field "frequently deal with a small population of only a few hundred people such as a [[village]] or [[neighbourhood]]".&lt;ref name="Townsend"/&gt;

==Globalization effects on the discipline==

Studies under the discipline are concerned with the [[ethnoecology|ethnoecologies]] of [[indigenous populations]].&lt;ref name="Kottak"/&gt; Due to various factors associated with [[globalization]], [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] ethnoecologies are facing increasing challenges such as, "migration, media, and commerce spread people, institutions, information, and technology".&lt;ref name="Kottak"/&gt; "In the face of national and international incentives to exploit and degrade, ethnological systems that once preserved local and regional environments increasingly are ineffective or irrelevant".&lt;ref name="Kottak"/&gt; Threats also exist of "commercial logging, industrial pollution, and the imposition of external management systems" on their local ecosystems.&lt;ref name="Kottak"/&gt;  These threats to indigenous ways of life are a familiar occurrence in the field of anthropology.  Conrad Phillip Kottak states that, "Today's ecological anthropology , aka environmental anthropology, attempts not only to understand but also to find solutions to environmental problems".&lt;ref name="Kottak"/&gt; The discipline's one of the approaches for finding such solutions is contemplating which aspects of human nature lead to environmental degradations. Such features of human nature can include a desire for technological innovations, aspiration for higher social status, and preoccupied or biased inclination to social justice.&lt;ref name="Kopnina2013"/&gt; Another approach to deal with contemporary climate issue is applying a norm of traditional ecological knowledge. Long-term ecological knowledge of an indigenous group can provide valuable insight into adaptation strategies, community-based monitoring, and dynamics between culturally important species and human.&lt;ref name="Vinyeta&amp;Lynn2013"/&gt;

== Criticisms ==

From the beginning various scholars criticised the discipline, saying it inherently was too focused on [[Static equilibrium|static equilibrii]] which ignored change, that it used [[circular reasoning]], and that it oversimplified systems.&lt;ref name=Vayda&amp;McCay1975/&gt;{{attribution needed|date=June 2013}} One of the current criticisms{{by whom|date=June 2013}} is that, in its original form, ecological anthropology relies upon [[cultural relativism]] as the [[norm (social)|norm]].&lt;ref name="Conrad"/&gt; However, in today's world, there are few cultures that are isolated enough to live in a true [[Cultural relativity|culturally relative]] state. Instead, cultures are being influenced and changed by [[Mass media|media]], [[government]]s, [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]], businesses, etc.&lt;ref name="Kottak"/&gt; In response, the discipline has seen a shift towards applied ecological anthropology, [[political ecology]] and [[environmental anthropology]].&lt;ref name="Kottak"/&gt;

'''El Zotz''' ({{IPA-es|el sots}}) is a [[Mesoamerica]]n [[archaeological site]] of the [[pre-Columbian]] [[Maya civilization]], located in the [[Petén Basin]] region around {{convert|20|km|mi}} west of the major center of [[Tikal]] and approximately {{convert|26|km|mi}} west of [[Uaxactun]].&lt;ref&gt;Hammond 2000, p.222. Laporte 2006, p.949. Houston, p.7.&lt;/ref&gt; It is so called because of the large number of bats living in caves in the nearby cliffs (the original Mayan name was Pa'Chan). The site is located within the San Miguel la Palotada National Park bordering the [[Tikal|Tikal National Park]] in the present-day department of [[Petén Department|Petén]], [[Guatemala]]. It is a large [[Mesoamerican chronology|Classic Period]] site and contains many unexcavated [[tumulus|mound]]s and ruins.

El Zotz shared its [[Maya script#Emblem glyphs|Emblem Glyph]] with the powerful city of [[Yaxchilan]] in [[Chiapas]], [[Mexico]], and it is likely that the Yaxchilan royal dynasty had its origin in El Zotz.

The tallest temple structure is approximately 45&amp;nbsp;m (148&amp;nbsp;ft) high and is known as "El Diablo" (the devil), allegedly because the sides of the temple are dangerously steep. Conservation work has been carried out here by the [[University of San Carlos of Guatemala]], including the construction of a rudimentary campsite for tourists. The area has caves and swamps and is a protected [[biotope]].&lt;ref name="parkswatch."&gt;ParksWatch.&lt;/ref&gt; It is known for the hundreds of thousands of bats that fly out from under the cliffs at sunset.

==Name==
The name ''El Zotz'' may have been chosen by Marco Antonio Bailey when he visited the site in 1977, with the name appearing on the map he produced. The site had previously been named ''Dos Aguadas'' (Two Springs) and Bailey may have changed the name to distinguish the site from other places in the region bearing the same name.&lt;ref&gt;Laporte 2006, pp.950-951.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Zotz'' and its variations mean ''[[bat]]'' in a variety of [[Mayan languages]], for example ''sotz' '' in [[K'iche' language|K'iche' Maya]],&lt;ref&gt;Christenson&lt;/ref&gt; ''zodz'' in [[Yucatec Maya language|Yucatec Maya]] and ''suts' '' in [[Ch'ol language|Ch'ol Maya]].&lt;ref&gt;Bolles 2001. Aulie &amp; Aulie 1978, p.86.&lt;/ref&gt; The new name derives from the fact that the El Diablo complex possesses a cave that is the habitat of an enormous quantity of the animals.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Laport 2006, p.955.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location and environment==
[[Image:Guatemala-Peten-around-Flores.png|thumb|right|400px|Map of Lake Petén Itzá, showing the location of El Zotz to the north.]]
The site is located within the [[Municipalities of Guatemala|municipality]] of [[San José, El Petén|San José]] in the [[Departments of Guatemala|department]] of [[Petén Department|Petén]]. El Zotz falls within the San Miguel La Palotada [[biotope]], a part of the [[Maya Biosphere Reserve]] that is bordered on the east by the [[Tikal|Tikal National Park]] and surrounded on all other sides by designated multiple-use zones of the Reserve.&lt;ref&gt;Laporte 2006, pp.949-950.&lt;/ref&gt;

The site is {{convert|7|km|mi}} southwest of [[Bejucal (Mesoamerican site)|Bejucal]], another Maya site that was subsidiary to El Zotz.&lt;ref&gt;Houston et al. 2007 p.415. Houston, p.7.&lt;/ref&gt;

El Zotz is a medium-sized site covering an area of perhaps {{convert|0.75|by|0.75|km|mi}} that includes a variety of large and small [[Maya architecture|architectural]] remains in a style typical of the Early Classic.&lt;ref&gt;Houston et al. 2007 p.396.&lt;/ref&gt; The site is crossed by low ridges that run from southwest to northeast. The maximum height of the ridges is approximately {{convert|400|m|ft}} [[above mean sea level]], with the troughs between them having an elevation of about {{convert|150|m|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;Laporte 2006, p.949.&lt;/ref&gt; The local bedrock is [[limestone]].&lt;ref&gt;Houston et al. 2007 p.401.&lt;/ref&gt; The site overlooks a valley occupied by seasonal swampland.&lt;ref&gt;Houston, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The site is covered with [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical moist forest]] and includes areas of seasonal [[Freshwater swamp forest|inundated forest]]. The average annual temperature is {{convert|27|°C|°F}} with the actual temperature varying between {{convert|20|°C|°F}} and {{convert|32|°C|°F}}. Average annual rainfall varies between {{convert|1200|and|1400|mm|in}} with a [[dry season]] lasting from January to April.&lt;ref name="parkswatch."/&gt;

Local wildlife includes the following [[species]], some of which are highly endangered: [[jaguar]] (''Panthera onca''), [[cougar|puma]] (''Felis concolor''), [[ocelot]] (''Leopardus wiedii''), [[Baird's tapir]] (''Tapirus bairdii''), [[red brocket deer]] (''Mazama americana''), [[howler monkey]] (''Alouatta pigra''), [[Petenia|red snook]] (''Petenia splendida''), [[Morelet's Crocodile]] (''Crocodylus moreletii'') and the [[ocellated turkey]] (''Agriocharis ocellata'').&lt;ref name="parkswatch."/&gt;

==History==
Although [[Mesoamerican chronology|Preclassic]] [[Maya ceramics|ceramic]] fragments are abundant at El Zotz, the site appears to have undergone significant expansion during the 6th century AD, in the Early Classic, the location of the site together with its architectural style suggest that this may have been due to the influence of the important city of Tikal.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Laporte 2006, p.968.&lt;/ref&gt; The apogee of El Zotz appears to have been brief, spanning about one hundred years during the later Early Classic and the early part of the Late Classic, experiencing an intense burst of construction activity including the building of palaces and pyramids, followed by a rapid decline.&lt;ref&gt;Houston, p.7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ruling dynasty of El Zotz appears to have originated at Bejucal and to later have relocated its capital to El Zotz.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Houston, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt; The reading of [[Maya script|hieroglyphic texts]] associated with the site suggest that El Zotz was founded by enemies of Tikal in order to exploit a period of weakness of the latter city.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Houston, p.2.&lt;/ref&gt; The city possessed the same [[Maya script#Emblem glyphs|Emblem Glyph]] as [[Yaxchilan]] on the [[Mexico|Mexican]] side of the [[Usumacinta River]] and it is supposed that the royal dynasty of that city had its origin in El Zotz.&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;Houston et al 2007 p.395.&lt;/ref&gt;

A stela from Bejucal indicates that the [[Teotihuacan]]-linked general [[Siyaj K'ak']] ("Fire is Born") was the overlord (yajaw) of the king of El Zotz.&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;Houston, p.8.&lt;/ref&gt; This general was implicated in a major Teotihuacan-backed military intervention in the central Petén during the 4th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Coe 1999, pp.90-1.&lt;/ref&gt; A bowl found in [[Bagaces]] in [[Costa Rica]] bears a hieroglyphic text indicating that it was a gift from the king of El Zotz to the king of [[El Perú (Maya site)|El Perú]], a city {{convert|56|km|mi}} west of El Zotz.&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt; This, in combination with other texts, indicates that El Zotz was subordinate to El Perú.&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt; El Perú was in turn a vassal of the great city of [[Calakmul]], the sworn enemy of Tikal, and a [[jade use in Mesoamerica|jade]] plaque from a royal tomb at Calakmul refers to an event at El Zotz.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

El Zotz appears to have passed through a period of renewed prosperity during the Late Classic and the city would have had close interactions with its near neighbours, such as Tikal, Uaxactun, [[Motul de San José]] and [[El Tintal]]. El Zotz appears to have been particularly densely inhabited during the Terminal Classic.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Although El Zotz appears to have received strong influences from Tikal, it appears to have taken its place in the larger political rivalry between Tikal and Calakmul and to have aligned itself with Tikal's great enemy in order to gain local advantage.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; When Tikal recovered from its misfortunes it appears that El Zotz was unable to survive its attentions.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

Hostile relations between El Zotz and its huge neighbour Tikal are evidenced on the ground by an earthwork of unknown date that served to mark the territorial division between the two polities.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; In the 8th century AD, according to a text at Tikal, El Zotz and [[Naranjo]] were jointly engaged in battle against Tikal. This battle took place on 4 February 744. The last known hieroglyphic inscription to refer to El Zotz describes the city as being the target of an attack by Tikal.&lt;ref&gt;Houston, pp.8-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern history==
The earliest visits to the site were carried out in response to reports of archaeological looting. Archaeologist Marco Antonio Bailey visited the site in 1977 on behalf of the recently founded Departamento de Monumentos Prehispánicos (DEMOPRE - Department of Prehispanic Monuments) of the [[Instituto de Antropología e Historia]] (Institute of Anthropology and History), this was the first official visit to the site on behalf of the Guatemalan government. Bailey did not produce any written report but he did map the site. Although he George F. Andrews briefly visited the site in 1978, with his written report appearing in the magazine ''Mexicon'' in 1986. This was the first mention of the site in print. The Proyecto Nacional Tikal briefly investigated the site in May 1983, although its report was not published until 20 years later, in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Laport 2006, pp.949-953.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Departamento de Monumentos Prehispánicos remapped the site in 1995, with the new map being published in 2001. The Tikal Project's Programa de Arqueología Regional (Regional Archaeology Programme) sunk some test pits at the site in 2000 but the results had still not been published as of 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Laport 2006, p.951.&lt;/ref&gt; A further survey was undertaken during two weeks of January 2006 by the Departamento de Monumentos Prehispanicos in conjunction with Archaeologist [[Stephen D. Houston]] and [[Brown University]].&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;

The [[Denver Art Museum]] has returned a carved wooden [[lintel (architecture)|lintel]] stolen from the site, one of the few such artifacts in existence. It dates to 550&amp;ndash;650 A.D. and was taken from Temple I, the northern [[Mesoamerican pyramids|pyramid]] in the main plaza, in the 1960s. It shows a son of a ruler from [[Tikal]].&lt;ref&gt;Schuster 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; It is now in National Archeology Museum in [[Guatemala City]].

A three-year investigation was begun at El Zotz in May 2008.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;  Later studies in the late-2010's using [[LIDAR]], have revealed a far larger site than previously envisaged.  The studies revealed houses, palaces, elevated highways, and defensive fortifications.  Ithaca College archaeologist, Thomas Garrison, says he believes the scale and population density has been "grossly underestimated and could in fact be three or four times greater than previously thought".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-42916261|title=Sprawling Mayan network discovered under Guatemala jungle|accessdate=2 Feb 2018|publisher=BBC|date=2 Feb 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Global Heritage Fund]] and [[World Monuments Fund]], El Zotz is endangered by insufficient management, looting, deforestation, and natural disaster, as well as general threats (agriculture, poaching, forest-fires, and illegal extraction) to the [[Maya Biosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ghn.globalheritagefund.org/explore.php?id%3D1361 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221222930/http://www.ghn.globalheritagefund.org/explore.php?id=1361 |archivedate=2014-02-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wmf.org/project/el-zotz|title=El Zotz - World Monuments Fund|website=Ghn.globalheritagefund.org|accessdate=16 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Site description==
{{Maya civilization}}
El Zotz has at least two principal ceremonial centres. The main ceremonial centre lies within the site core while the second of these is in an area known as '''El Diablo'''.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The [[Maya architecture|architecture]] at the site is massive and the stonework of excellent quality, which has undoubtedly helped in the preservation of the structures at the site. The structures were packed with rubble and mortar together with layers of clay, this last element likely brought from the lowland troughs near the site. The superstructures of the buildings at the site were built with large well-finished limestone blocks sealed with mortar, these were then covered with [[stucco]] and painted in a variety of colours, some traces of pigment still remain. Rooms within the superstructures were narrow and supported vaulted ceilings.&lt;ref&gt;Houston et al. 2007 pp.401-402.&lt;/ref&gt;

Four ''[[chultun]]ob'' were found cut into the limestone bedrock of the plazas at the site. These are artificial subterranean chambers that were probably used to store water.&lt;ref&gt;Houston et al. 2007 p.403.&lt;/ref&gt;

The site core is set out around a Central Plaza bordered by structures on the north and west sides. The [[Acropolis]] lies to the north of the Central Plaza with the East Plaza lying directly east of the Acropolis. The Plaza of the Five Temples lies to the west of the Central Plaza and the South Plaza lies to the south of both. The site core lies upon flatter terrain at the site, close to the two springs. The Proyecto Nacional Tikal carried out rescue works in the site core in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;Laport 2006, pp.954-955.&lt;/ref&gt;

The site core of El Zotz contains 49 buildings divided between four main groups.&lt;ref name="auto6"&gt;Houston et al 2007, p.404.&lt;/ref&gt;

===East Group (Group 1)===
The '''East Group''' or '''Group 1''' has various structures laid out around a wide plaza, including two mortuary pyramids on the north side.&lt;ref&gt;Laport 2006, p.957. Houston et al. 2007, p.404.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''East Causeway''' is a [[sacbe]] that begins near Temple 1 in the Central Group and runs eastwards to the East Group.&lt;ref&gt;Laport 2006, pp.956-957.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Structure M7-1''' is a {{convert|22.5|m|ft|adj=on}} high temple pyramid with a base measuring {{convert|36|by|41|m|ft}}. The temple shrine is fashioned from well-finished stones and is of a similar style to that of [[Tikal Temple I]]. The pyramid has two smaller mounds attached to it at the base, forming a [[Triadic pyramid|triadic temple]] group. Both of the smaller mounds have been damaged by looters' trenches.&lt;ref name="auto6"/&gt;  A wooden lintel was illegally removed from the temple in the late 1960s and sold to the [[Denver Art Museum]] in the United States, provoking the first official visits and explorations of the site. The looted lintel was returned to Guatemala in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Laport 2006, p.957. Houston, p.6.&lt;/ref&gt; The lintel was carved from five planks of [[sapodilla]] wood, forming a panel {{convert|180|cm|in}} long and {{convert|74|cm|in}} wide. The lintel is incomplete but depicts a standing human figure holding a ceremonial staff. The figure is surrounded by hieroglyphic writing on both sides and above it. The style of dress of the figure has been used to date the lintel to the late 6th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Laport 2006, pp.957-958.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Structure M7-2''' is located across the plaza from Structure M7-1. Its base measures {convert|21|by|33|m|ft)) and it is {{convert|12|m|ft}} high. The pyramid was probably accessed from the south, plaza, side. No clear evidence remains of any superstructure and the east side of the temple is damaged by two looters' trenches.&lt;ref&gt;Houston et al. 2007, p.407.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Central Group (Group 2)===
The '''Central Plaza''' is bordered on the north by the acropolis, on the south by the [[Mesoamerican ballcourt|ballcourt]] and on the west by a variety of low platforms and pyramids.&lt;ref name="auto7"&gt;Laport 2006, p.957.&lt;/ref&gt; Six [[Maya stelae|stelae]] and an altar were placed in the Central Plaza, the stelae are mostly plain monuments arranged in two north-south rows, the westernmost containing four monuments and the parallel eastern row containing only two.&lt;ref name="auto8"&gt;Laport 2006, p.960.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Acropolis''' is an elite residence, probably a palace, laid out around three patios and encompassing '''Structures L7-1''' through to '''L7-10''' and including some large buildings among them. Eighteen looters' pits have been counted within the Acropolis.&lt;ref&gt;Houston et al. 2007 pp.407-408.&lt;/ref&gt;
:'''Structure L7-2''' was damaged by a looters' trench. Archaeological investigations of the trench uncovered a quantity of Early Classic ceramics.&lt;ref&gt;Houston et al. 2007 pp.408, 410.&lt;/ref&gt;
:'''Structure L7-6''' has two wide access stairways, on the north and south sides.&lt;ref name="auto9"&gt;Houston et al 2007 p.408.&lt;/ref&gt;
:'''Structure L7-7''' divides two of the patios. It was probably built later than the rest of the palace, splitting one larger courtyard into two.&lt;ref name="auto9"/&gt;

'''Stela 1''' is a carved [[limestone]] monument immediately south of Temple 1, it is the northernmost of the two stelae in the eastern row of monuments in the Central Plaza. It is the only sculpted stela currently known from the site and is carved on all four sides. The front of the monument has a human figure facing to the left, the back of the stela has a [[Maya script|hieroglyphic panel]] consisting of 39 glyphic blocks. Ceramic fragments dating to the Late Classic were found near the stela, they have been interpreted as the result of ritual activity.&lt;ref&gt;Laport 2006, pp.960-961.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Temple 1''' (or '''Structure L7-11''') is a large [[Mesoamerican pyramids|pyramid]] with a [[Corbel arch|corbel-vaulted]] superstructure situated on the northeast side of the Central Plaza. It is the principal structure at the site and has been heavily looted.&lt;ref name="auto7"/&gt; The structure is a {{convert|25|m|ft|adj=on}} high funerary temple measuring {{convert|40|by|40|m|ft}} at the base.&lt;ref&gt;Houston et al. 2007 p.407.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989 the Proyecto Nacional Tikal undertook rescue works at the temple, installing replacement lintels, sealing some of the chambers and closing the more dangerous looters' tunnels.&lt;ref name="auto7"/&gt;

The '''Ballcourt''' is located on the south side of the Central Plaza.&lt;ref name="auto7"/&gt; Considering the massive architecture at El Zotz, the ballcourt is unusually small and appears to have been more symbolic than practical.&lt;ref&gt;Houston et al. 2007 p.400.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Five Temples Group (Group 3)===
The '''Plaza of the Five Temples''' is a wide plaza flanked on the north and south sides by two pyramids of similar height,&lt;ref name="auto10"&gt;Laport 2006, pp.955-956.&lt;/ref&gt; while a long triadic temple complex occupies the east side of the plaza.&lt;ref&gt;Houston et al. 2007 p.410.&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the plaza derives from the temples that line the plaza and the complex resembles the [[Plaza of the Seven Temples]] at Tikal and is also similar to architecture at [[Yaxha]].&lt;ref name="auto10"/&gt; Two plain [[stele|stelae]] occupy the centre of the plaza, three more are placed in front of the temples on the east side of the plaza, together with an altar.&lt;ref name="auto10"/&gt;

'''Structure L7-18''' is a small pyramid on the west side of the Central Plaza.&lt;ref name="auto11"&gt;Laporte 2006, p.954. Houston et al. 2007, p.399.&lt;/ref&gt; It has a base measuring {{convert|13|by|13|m|ft}} and with a height of {{convert|7|m|ft}}. It has been damaged by two looters' pits, one of which was sunk into the summit resulting in serious structural damage and exposing a vaulted chamber with an intact doorjamb on its north side. The corbel vault and parts of the walls still retain their original stucco covering, the remains of which have revealed that the chamber was originally painted red, possibly together with other colours. Structure L7-18 has been dated to the Early Classic based on its architectural style.&lt;ref&gt;Houston et al. 2007 pp.410-411.&lt;/ref&gt; A looted tomb was found under the temple, it was roughly rectangular in shape with a curved roof, similar to tombs at the site of [[Río Azul]].&lt;ref&gt;Houston et al. 2007 p.402.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Structure L8-13''' is the north pyramid on the Plaza of the Five Temples.&lt;ref name="auto11"/&gt; The pyramid stands {{convert|13|m|ft}} high and measures {{convert|22|by|26|m|ft}} at the base. It still has traces of a wooden [[lintel]] supported on thick  [[door jambs]]. One of the jambs is marked with [[prehispanic]] graffiti. The pyramid once contained a royal tomb but it has been completely looted. The tomb was carved directly from the limestone bedrock under the pyramid, it is thought to have been the source of various fine quality ceramic vessels painted with images of ''[[wayob]]'' (spirit companions).&lt;ref&gt;Houston et al. 2007 pp.402, 411-412.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''South Causeway''' begins at the southeastern extreme of the Plaza of the Five Temples and runs south to the South Group.&lt;ref name="auto12"&gt;Laport 2006, p.956.&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Group (Group 4)===
The '''South Group''' consists of a large acropolis-type complex laid out around an internal patio.&lt;ref name="auto12"/&gt; The group consists of ten or more structures built on a raised platform and covered by dense vegetation.&lt;ref&gt;Houston et al. 2007 p.413.&lt;/ref&gt;

A further complex was identified by Bailey when he mapped the site. It consisted of a rectangular platform measuring {{convert|56|by|22|m|ft}} located to the southeast of the site core. The platform supports a tall pyramid in its centre. Although appearing on Bailey's plan, in 2006 the complex had not yet been investigated on the ground.&lt;ref name="auto8"/&gt;

===El Diablo===
El Diablo is located about {{convert|1|km|mi}} west of the site core, it is the smaller of the two known main ceremonial centres at El Zotz.&lt;ref&gt;Houston et al. 2007, p.403. Houston, p.6.&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''El Diablo'' means "the Devil" in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. It is situated in a defensive position on the highest outcrop at El Zotz and is visible from Temple IV at Tikal. The El Diablo complex contains the cave containing the large quantity of bats that gave rise to the name of the site. The El Diablo complex is believed to date to the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Late Classic]].&lt;ref&gt;Laport 2006, p.955. Houston et al. 2007, p.403.&lt;/ref&gt;

The El Diablo hill was artificially reshaped with the addition of terraces, upon which an acropolis was built that consisted of large platforms laid out around at least two plazas. Looters' tunnels have exposed decorated substructures within the El Diablo acropolis, which have been tentatively dated to the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Early Classic]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The main plaza of El Diablo is small when compared to the plazas of the site core and the architecture is less impressive.&lt;ref&gt;Houston et al. 2007, p.403.&lt;/ref&gt;

The discovery of a royal tomb in the El Diablo complex was announced in July 2010. The tomb is believed to contain the remains of a king named as Chak who ruled in the late 4th century AD. The ruler was aged in his fifties or sixties at the time of his death and was interred with the remains of six [[Child sacrifice in pre-Columbian cultures|sacrificed children]] aged between 1 and 5 years old.&lt;ref&gt;Prensa Libre, 15 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sexy-Legs-With-High-Heels.jpg|thumb|250px|High-heel shoes worn in an overt sexual context.]]
'''Fuck-me shoes''', alternatively '''fuck-me boots''', is a slang term for women's [[high-heeled shoes]] that exaggerate a sexual image. The term can be applied to any women's shoes that are worn with the intention of arousing others. It is sometimes used to imply condemnation against the women who choose to wear them or in a [[misogyny|misogynistic]] fashion toward the women who wear them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Egan|first=Danielle|year=2012|title=Sexuality, youth and the perils of endangered innocence: how history can help us get past the panic|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09540253.2012.666232?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true|journal=Gender and Education|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is similar in meaning to ''[[kinky boots]]'', although typically ''kinky boots'' refer more specifically to boots suited to a particular fetish.

== Term and usage ==
The phrase possibly originated in the United States, where two similar terms are used: {{" '}}fuck-you shoes' implying a disregard for convention or propriety, or 'fuck-off shoes' where 'fuck-off' means both outsize and aggressive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thorne|first=Tony|title=Dictionary of Contemporary Slang|year=2009|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=978-1-4081-0220-6|page=N.p.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tight trousers were called "come fuck-me's" as listed in a 1972 British dictionary of slang, while a 1974 book is cited as making a reference to a person wearing "a pair of fabulous 1940s-[[Joan Crawford]]-fuck-me's".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sheidlower|first=Jesse|title=The F-Word|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-539311-8|page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song "We are the Dead" from [[David Bowie]]'s 1974 ''[[Diamond Dogs]]'' album mentions "fuck-me pumps."

Prominent feminist [[Germaine Greer]] brought what had been an "obscure" term to more mainstream notoriety when she used it in 1995. Greer used the term in referring to British journalist [[Suzanne Moore]]'s alleged "hair bird's-nested all over the place, fuck-me shoes and three fat inches of cleavage". Greer made the remark in response to a column Moore had written about Greer in ''[[The Guardian]]'', where Moore had mistakenly repeated an incorrect rumor that Greer had a hysterectomy as a voluntary decision to have herself sterilized.&lt;ref name="Greer"&gt;{{cite news|last=Thackray|first=Rachelle|title=Germaine Greer smacks her sisters|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/germaine-smacks-her-sisters-1072156.html|newspaper=The Independent|date=February 21, 1999|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120719005038/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/germaine-smacks-her-sisters-1072156.html|archivedate=July 19, 2012|deadurl=no|accessdate=2014-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greer was also quoted during the 1990s as criticizing a number of women writers that she termed "lifestyle feminists"&lt;ref name="Greer" /&gt; who were, in her view, espousing feminism at nothing more than a superficial level. Moore's response was that her fashion choices were dictated by her own tastes and not to please men: "as someone who grew up with [[punk rock|punk]] and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], I take it for granted that women dress to please themselves and not men..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Caudwell|first=Jayne|title=Sport, Sexualities And Queer/theory|year=2006|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-36761-5|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Moore has said her footwear is "not worn just for the benefit of men", implying that the intention is twofold, to please both her and observers, although she also says "Most of the pleasure [of buying shoes] involves a private fantasy that begins with me and ends at my feet. Men don't get a look in".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Benstock, Sheri |author2=Ferriss, Suzanne |title=Footnotes: On Shoes|year=2001|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=978-0-8135-2871-7|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The incident, and the term, received coverage in British media and beyond, and the term has become associated with Greer in popular culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Calcutt|first=Andrew|title=Brit Cult: An A to Z of British Pop Culture|year=2001|publisher=Contemporary Books|isbn=978-0-8092-9324-7|page=223}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greer had been denouncing [[stiletto heel|stiletto shoes]] as symbols of women's subordination as early as 1971.&lt;ref name="Edwards 2009 82"&gt;{{cite book|last=Edwards|first=Tim|title=Fashion in Focus: Concepts, Practices and Politics|year=2009|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-44793-5|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; She continues to use the phrase "fuck me shoes" in public speaking when discussing gender and clothing styles society deems appropriate.

The expression was further popularized when British jazz singer [[Amy Winehouse]] released the single "Pumps" (originally titled "[[Fuck Me Pumps]]"{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} on her 2003 album ''[[Frank (Amy Winehouse album)|Frank]]''), a song about gold diggers.

In January 2011, in a forum with teenaged students in [[Cartagena, Colombia]], Greer noticed the popularity of silicone [[breast implants]] in the audience. She asked students why they thought women tennis players wore skirts, and asked why a young woman would choose to wear stiletto shoes: "So you think the shoes are her fetish?&amp;nbsp;... I call them fuck-me shoes", she said, "because you can't walk in them but you can wear them in bed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wood|first=Gaby|title=Hay Festival Cartagena: Passionate Germaine Greer's still a class act|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/hay-festival/8290650/Hay-Festival-Cartagena-passionate-Germaine-Greers-still-a-class-act.html|newspaper=The Telegraph (UK)|date=January 29, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702232609/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/hay-festival/8290650/Hay-Festival-Cartagena-passionate-Germaine-Greers-still-a-class-act.html|archivedate=July 2, 2012|deadurl=no|accessdate=2014-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cultural debate ===

The underlying conflict arises from the question of what is considered an appropriate way for women to present their bodies in public spaces. Some feminists have come to view criticisms of fashion choices to be what they term "[[slut-shaming]]", an action they view as misogynist, even when coming from other women. The development of the [[SlutWalk]] protest demonstrations against [[dress codes]] is influenced by this position. 

When [[punk fashion]] was on the rise during the late 1970s, young women consciously played with the symbolism inherent in their accessorizing, mixing choices that created a jarring visual clash; leather was combined with lace, steel spikes with velvet, stiletto heels with heavy ankle chains. The result was to exaggerate a look of sexual aggression, turning {{" '}}fuck me' shoes into signifiers of 'fuck you{{' "}}.&lt;ref name="Edwards 2009 82"/&gt; The punk influenced youth counterculture continues with this trend, part of the wider trend of [[fetish fashion]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1135">'''Functional generative description''' (FGD) is a linguistic framework developed at [[Charles University in Prague]] since the 1960s by a team led by [[Petr Sgall]]. Based on the [[dependency grammar]] formalism, it is a stratificational grammar formalism that treats the sentence as a system of interlinked layers: phonological, morphematical, morphonological, analytical (surface syntax) and tectogrammatical (deep syntax). Continuing the tradition of [[Prague School]], special attention is paid to the phenomenon of [[topic–focus articulation]].

The Prague Dependency Treebank (PDT) is a [[treebank]] consisting of a subset of the Czech National Corpus annotated along the lines of FGD.

== Biography ==
Abel was born in [[Saint-Uze]], in the [[Drôme]] department, on December 29, 1878. He was ordained on February 1, 1897 at [[St. Maximin's Abbey, Trier|Saint-Maximin]].&lt;ref name=dictionnaire/&gt; In 1897 he arrived in Jerusalem to study in the École Biblique founded by [[Marie-Joseph Lagrange]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l0QI4AhFatUC&amp;pg=PA31|title=The Story of Father Marie-Joseph Lagrange: Founder of Modern Catholic Bible Study|last=Montagnes|first=Bernard|date=2006|publisher=Paulist Press|isbn=9780809143337|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lagrange had recruited him (and [[:fr:Raphaël Savignac]]) to help him get "a clear grasp of physical environment and the cultural framework of the Bible".

== Work ==
He published a number of studies in various disciplines—linguistics, geography, and history. His ''Grammaire du Grec Biblique'' is a grammar of [[Koine Greek|Biblical Greek]] (1927).&lt;ref name="murphy" /&gt; Preceded by a volume on Palestine in the [[Guide Bleu]] series of travel guides,&lt;ref name="murphy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RD"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Le R.

With [[Louis-Hugues Vincent]] he published a number of works, the most famous of which are the three volumes of topographic-archaeological-historical studies on the city of Jerusalem. They worked together also at the excavations of [[Emmaus Nicopolis|Emmaus]], on research on the [[Cave of the Patriarchs]] in Hebron, and at the [[Church of the Nativity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=בן-אריה|first=יהושע|last2=Ben-Arieh|first2=Yehoshua|date=1999|title=Non-Jewish Institutions and the Research of Palestine during the British Mandate Period: Part Two / המוסדות הזרים לארכאולוגיה ולחקירת ארץ-ישראל בתקופת המנדט: חלק ב|jstor=23404547|journal=Cathedra: For the History of Eretz Israel and Its Yishuv / קתדרה: לתולדות ארץ ישראל ויישובה|issue=93|pages=111–142}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Savignac he argued that archeological remains beneath the [[St. Stephen's Basilica, Jerusalem]], which houses the École Biblique, were those of the basilica built by [[Aelia Eudocia|Empress Eudocia]] in the 5th century CE, but not that this was also the site of the stoning of [[Saint Stephen|Saint Stephen the Protomartyr]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Dossier on Stephen, the First Martyr|first=François|last=Bovon|journal=[[The Harvard Theological Review]]|volume=96|issue=3|year=2003|pages=279–315|jstor=4151873}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''God's Own Drunk'''"  is a monologue by [[Lord Buckley]] that musicians have since adapted into different types of songs; most notably, [[Jimmy Buffett]], who first recorded his rendition for ''[[Living and Dying in 3/4 Time|Living and Dying in ¾ Time]]'' and has since released a single of a live performance in 2011.  Buffett's version was a concert staple&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buffettworld.com/sued-for-gods-own-drunk/ |title=CG: Buffett Sued for "God’s Own Drunk" |publisher=Jimmy Buffett World |date= |accessdate=2016-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even regarded as his [[signature song|theme]] before "[[Margaritaville]]"'s popularity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rockwell |first=John |date=March 16, 1978 |title=Jimmy Buffet Rises From The Islands |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1734&amp;dat=19780316&amp;id=oekbAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=mVEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4546,1482970&amp;hl=en |newspaper=[[New York Weekly|The Dispatch]] |location=New York |access-date=2016-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; until he was forced to stop playing it after being sued by Buckley's son, Dick Buckley Jr., for [[copyright infringement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buffettworld.com/sued-for-gods-own-drunk/ |title=CG: Buffett Sued for "God’s Own Drunk" |publisher=Names and Faces |date=August 30, 1983 |accessdate=2016-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
Buckley's monologue and Buffett's rendition both tell a story in the [[First-person narrative|first-person]] of a [[recovering alcoholic]] who finds himself taking care of his brother-in-law's [[still]], eventually giving into his temptation and drinking its [[whiskey]].  In the midst of his bender, he crosses paths with a bear; who, from the narrator's [[Unreliable narrator|drunken perspective]], is a male [[Kodiak bear|Kodiak]] about 16 feet (Buckley) or 19 feet (Buffett) tall.  The narrator's fearlessness interests the bear, and out of mutual curiosity, the narrator gives the bear some whiskey and names him "Buddy".  The two drink the night away, and the narrator awakens to find that both Buddy and the still are gone; implying that the bear liked the whiskey so much that he stole the still.

==Buffett's cover==
Although Buffett did not officially record his rendition until 1974, he had been performing it since 1966 after two friends played him Buckley's 1959 [[Hollywood, CA|Hollywood]] recording of ''Lord Buckley in Concert''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2USQuKSOhg |title=God's Own Drunk |publisher=[[MCA Records]] |date=1978 |accessdate=2016-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''You Had to Be There'' (1978), disc 2 track 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Buffett and his friends were living in [[New Orleans]] at the time and were playing at a bar where the performers were required to do a rendition of Buckley's "God's Own Drunk".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apeculture.com/music/buffettbenefit.htm |title=Acoustic Harvest Moon Benefit Concert |publisher=Ape Culture |date=November 20, 1999 |accessdate=2016-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawsuit==
In the ''Names and Faces'' section in newspapers all over the country on August 30, 1983, the following story ran: {{quote|Singer Jimmy Buffett, known for hits like "Margaritaville" and "[[Havana Daydreamin'|Havana Daydreaming]]," has been named in an $11-million suit alleging that one of his songs was taken from a dramatic monologue by the late Richard (Lord) Buckley, an entertainer during the 1930s and 1950s. Buckley's son, Dick Buckley Jr., charged in a suit filed last Thursday in [[United States District Court for the Central District of California|US District Court in Los Angeles]] that Buffett infringed on his father's copyright. Buckley charged that Buffett took parts of his father's monologue from ''A Tribute to Buckley'' and claimed it as his work in "God's Own Drunk."}}

===The Lawyer and the Asshole===
Though few details of the lawsuit are known, it inspired a song titled "The Lawyer and the Asshole".  Because "God's Own Drunk" was a concert staple before the lawsuit, the song's sudden absence from the [[setlist]] was a disappointment to fans, so Buffett played "The Lawyer and the Asshole" instead, to explain why "God's Own Drunk" couldn't and wouldn't be performed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Meade |first=Pam |date=July 18, 1983 |title=Buffett, fans on same wave |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1298&amp;dat=19830718&amp;id=o99LAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=NIsDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6082,2516273&amp;hl=en |newspaper=[[The Free Lance–Star]] |location=[[Fredericksburg, Virginia]] |access-date=2016-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Live performances==
Buffett had been performing "God's Own Drunk" on an occasional basis since learning it in 1966, but the song became a concert staple after its recording in 1974 and remained a standard until 1978, to which he only performed it on a frequent basis because it did not mesh well with the softer sound he was promoting with ''[[Son of a Son of a Sailor]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rockwell |first=John |date=March 17, 1978 |title=Jimmy Buffet Makes Comfortable "Mellow" Rock |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1873&amp;dat=19780317&amp;id=wIgfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=FtMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2686,938223&amp;hl=en |newspaper=[[Daytona Beach Morning Journal]] |location=[[Daytona Beach]] |access-date=2016-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; A live version was released on ''[[You Had to Be There]]'', capturing the crowd's demand for its performance and its acclaim when Buffett finally played it after teasing some fans before the preceding song "[[Grapefruit—Juicy Fruit]]".    By 1983, when Dick Buckley Jr. sued Buffett for copyright infringement, the song was dropped completely.

When Buffett was obligated to stop performing it during the lawsuit, he instead occasionally played "The Lawyer and the Asshole" as a substitute, with the earliest known performance being in [[Telluride, Colorado]] on August 27, 1983 and the last being November 16, 1986 in [[Gainesville, Florida]].  Sometimes, in lieu of playing "God's Own Drunk" due to the litigation, he would heave a boxful of little "Buddy Bears" to the audience&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Young |first=Glen |date=April 12, 1983 |title=Buffet's musical smorgasbord |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2706&amp;dat=19830412&amp;id=IQxKAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=8h0NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1576,4461529&amp;hl=en |newspaper=[[The Michigan Daily]] |location=[[Ann Arbor, Michigan]] |access-date=2016-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; or did trivia about the song, where he would ask the questions and the crowd would shout the answer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Stead |first=Terry L. |date=June 26, 1986 |title=Buffett warms crowd on chilly night |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2519&amp;dat=19860626&amp;id=RG9eAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=n2ENAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5148,3183947&amp;hl=en |newspaper=[[Observer–Reporter]] |location=[[Washington, Pennsylvania]] |access-date=2016-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The outcome of the court case is unknown, but Buffett had brought "God's Own Drunk" back to the setlist in 1988 and since then has only played it rarely.  Aside from the ''You Had to Be There'' performance, other notable live versions are: at the [[Palladium (New York City)|Palladium]] on March 14, 1980 (captured on ''Ringling Ringling''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Ringling-Radio-Broadcast-1981/dp/B01BSTZKWO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1471120447&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=ringling+ringling+jimmy+buffett |title=Ringling Ringling: Radio Broadcast 1981 |publisher=Import |date=May 6, 2016 |accessdate=2016-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;); in [[George, Washington|George, WA]] on August 22, 1992, with several references to [[the Gorge Amphitheatre]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.setlist.fm/setlist/jimmy-buffett/1992/the-gorge-amphitheatre-george-wa-43d297c7.html |title=Jimmy Buffett 1992 The Gorge Amphitheatre|publisher=Setlist.fm |date=August 22, 1992 |accessdate=2016-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Toyota Park]] in [[Bridgeview, Illinois]] on July 23, 2011, using the [[Chicago Bears]] as a plot device for the Kodiak bear in the song, going on to release this performance as a single; and its most recent performance at the [[Riverbend Music Center|Riverbend Music Theater]] on June 21, 2016.

==Pop-culture references==
In Buffett's studio take, one of the types of drunks listed off is "Reggie Younging", a reference to [[Reggie Young]].

In the song "Semi-True Story" from ''[[Beach House on the Moon]]'', Buffett sings about the day in 1974 when he recorded "God's Own Drunk".

[[Mike Harding]] does a faithful rendition of Lord Buckley's monologue, using it as the title track of his [[Mike Harding#Albums|1989 album]].

'''Guaytán''' is an archaeological site of the [[Maya civilization]] in the [[municipalities of Guatemala|municipality]] of [[San Agustín Acasaguastlán]], in the [[departments of Guatemala|department]] of [[El Progreso Department|El Progreso]], in [[Guatemala]].&lt;ref&gt;Arroyave Prera 2012, p. 602.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the most important [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] archaeological site of the middle drainage of the [[Motagua River]].&lt;ref name="Romer2016p15"&gt;Romero 2016, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The site is located south of San Agustín Acasaguastlán, and to the north of the Motagua River, built on both banks of the [[Lato River (Guatemala)|Lato River]].&lt;ref name="Romer2016p15"/&gt; The site was inhabited from the [[Mesoamerican chronology#Preclassic Era|Late Preclassic Period]] (c. 250 BC – 250 AD) to the [[Mesoamerican chronology#Classic Era|Late Classic Period]] (c. 300 – 900 AD).&lt;ref name="ArroyavePrera2012p603"&gt;Arroyave Prera 2012, p. 603.&lt;/ref&gt; The city controlled an important source of [[Jade use in Mesoamerica|jadeite]].&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 703.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The site is distributed in a number of groups on both sides of the Lato River, but hasn't been completely mapped.&lt;ref name="Romer2016p15"/&gt; The principal groups include the Acropolis,&lt;ref name="ArroyavePrera2012p601"&gt;Arroyave Prera 2012, p. 601.&lt;/ref&gt; El Castillo,&lt;ref name="Romer2016p15"/&gt; Carrillo,&lt;ref name="Romer2016p16"&gt;Romero 2016, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; La Escuela,&lt;ref name="Romer2016p17"&gt;Romero 2016, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; and La Estela.&lt;ref name="Romer2016p17"/&gt;

Guaytán features an unusual Late to Terminal Classic [[Mesoamerican ballcourt|ballcourt]] with an attached temple.&lt;ref&gt;Fox 1991, p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt; Fragments of Classic period [[Maya codex|codices]] have been recovered from tombs at the site.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sculptures===
A number of zoomorphic sculptures have been recovered from Guaytán; five of these are believed to represent the heads of snakes and have been labelled as Monuments 1 through to 5.&lt;ref&gt;López Garzona 2015, pp. 760-761.&lt;/ref&gt; Although they have been described as ballcourt markers, they may have been set into the corners of buildings.&lt;ref&gt;López Garzona 2015, p. 760.&lt;/ref&gt; Monument 6 represents a seated monkey with its arms curving around its front, with its left leg behind them. Only the right eye has been carved into the monument.&lt;ref&gt;López Garzona 2015, pp. 761, 763.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Burials===
Guaytán features a number of large [[cist]]s and extensive crypts containing multiple burials.&lt;ref name="Romero2000p659"/&gt; Most were found under the remains of large structures that formed closed plazas.&lt;ref name="Romero2000p660"/&gt; The crypts were built with large slabs of stone to form chambers that measured approximately {{convert|2|m|ft}} high.&lt;ref name="Romero2000p659"&gt;Romero 2000, p. 659.&lt;/ref&gt; The largest slabs were set to form vaulted roofs to the chambers. A tomb under Structure 24 features small niches that contained vessels left as funerary offerings. Some of the crypts contained an antechamber used for additional burials.&lt;ref name="Romero2000p660"&gt;Romero 2000, p. 660.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tomb 3''' has a chamber that measures {{convert|1.7|m|ft}} wide by {{convert|2.4|m|ft}} long,&lt;ref&gt;Romero 2000, pp. 660, 666.&lt;/ref&gt; accessed by a {{convert|1.3|m|ft|adj=on}} long passage with a width of {{convert|0.9|m|ft}} and a height of {{convert|1.25|m|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;Romero 2000, pp. 659–660.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Site history==
During the Late Preclassic, Guaytán was densely populated, although buildings were generally of perishable materials. At the time, the site had contacts with the [[Guatemalan Highlands]] and with the [[Southern Maya area|Pacific coastal lowlands]]. Guaytán was one of two sites (the other being [[La Vega de Cobán]], in [[Zacapa Department|Zacapa]]) that controlled most of the [[Trade in Maya civilization|trade]] passing along the Motagua River. In the Early Classic, the city underwent a population explosion and there was contact with the great metropolis of [[Teotihuacan]], in the distant [[Valley of Mexico]]. By the Late Classic, contacts extended to the [[Petén Basin|Petén lowlands]], the [[Yucatán Peninsula]], and the western portions of [[Honduras]] and [[El Salvador]].&lt;ref name="ArroyavePrera2012p603"/&gt;

===Modern history===
The site was first reported in 1926 by archaeologist Gustavo Espinoza,&lt;ref name="Romer2016p15"/&gt; although no serious investigations were undertaken until 1943. Projects to partially map the site were undertaken in 2001 and 2013.&lt;ref name="Romer2016p15"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3162">An '''imprint''' of a [[publisher]] is a [[trade name]] under which it publishes a work. A single [[publishing company]] may have multiple imprints, often using the different names as [[brand]]s to [[marketing|market]] works to various [[demographic]] [[market segment|consumer segments]].&lt;ref&gt;

== Description ==
An imprint of a publisher is a  [[trade name]]—a name that a business uses for trading commercial products or services—under which a work is [[publish]]ed. Imprints typically have a defining character or [[goal|mission]]. In some cases, the diversity results from the [[corporate takeover|takeover]] of smaller publishers (or parts of their business) by a larger company. In the case of [[Barnes &amp; Noble]], imprints have been used to facilitate the venture of a bookseller into publishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wetfeet.com/articles/industry-overview-journalism-and-publishing|title=Industry Overview: Journalism and Publishing|publisher=Wet Feet|accessdate=2016-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the video game industry, some game companies operate various publishing labels with [[Take-Two Interactive]] credited as "the father of label" in their case the labels are wholly owned incorporated entities with their own publishing and distributing, sales and marketing infrastructure and management teams and their own respective subsidiaries also incorporated (Rockstar North Limited, 2K Vegas, Inc.). This model have influenced rivals including [[Activision Blizzard]], [[Zenimax]], [[Electronic Arts]] from 2008-2018, [[Warner Bros. Interactive]], and [[Koei Tecmo]]. Take-Two have had such model in place since 1997-1998, and is seen as a "a game holding company with autonomous game publishing and development subsidiaries"&lt;ref&gt;https://venturebeat.com/2018/06/18/take-two-ceo-strauss-zelnick-im-charged-with-making-hard-decisions/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mercurynews.com/2008/03/02/ea-ceo-pledges-freedom-to-take-two-interactives-developers/&lt;/ref&gt;
Independently-owned game publishers like [[Devolver Digital]] also use the word label to describe itself.

== Use ==
A single publishing company may have multiple imprints, with the different imprints often used by the publisher to [[marketing|market]] works to different [[demographic]] [[market segment|consumer segments]]. For example, the objective of [[Viking Press|Viking]]—an imprint of the [[Penguin Group]]—is "[t]o publish a strictly limited list of good nonfiction, such as biography, history and works on contemporary affairs, and distinguished fiction with some claim to permanent importance rather than [[ephemeral]] popular interest."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yodiwan.wordpress.com/2009/07/14/what-is-an-imprint |title=What is an imprint? |work=The Book Publicity Blog }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[phonetics]], '''ingressive sounds''' are sounds by which the [[airstream mechanism|airstream]] flows inward through the mouth or nose. The three types of ingressive sounds are '''lingual ingressive''' or '''velaric ingressive''' (from the [[tongue]] and the [[soft palate|velum]]), '''glottalic ingressive''' (from the [[glottis]]), and '''pulmonic ingressive''' (from the [[lung]]s).

The opposite of an ingressive sound is an [[egressive sound]], by which the air stream is created by pushing air out through the mouth or nose. The majority of sounds in most languages, such as vowels, are both pulmonic and egressive.

==Lingual ingressive==
Lingual ingressive, or velaric ingressive, describes an [[airstream mechanism]] in which a sound is produced by closing the vocal tract at two places of articulation in the mouth, rarifying the air in the enclosed space by lowering the tongue and then releasing both closures. Such sounds are called "[[click consonant|clicks]]".

==Glottalic ingressive==
{{Further|Implosive consonant}}
Glottal ingressive is the term generally applied to the implosive consonants, which actually use a mixed glottalic ingressive–pulmonic egressive airstream. True glottalic ingressives are quite rare and are called "voiceless implosives" or "reverse ejectives."

==Pulmonic ingressive==
Pulmonic ingressive describes ingressive sounds in which the airstream is created by the [[lung]]s and are generally [[paralanguage|paralinguistic]]. They may be found as phonemes, words, and entire phrases on all continents and in genetically-unrelated languages, most frequently in sounds for agreement and [[backchannel (linguistics)|backchanneling]].

Pulmonic ingressive sounds are extremely rare outside paralinguistics. A pulmonic ingressive phoneme was found in the ritual language [[Damin]]; its last speaker died in the 1990s. [[ǃXóõ]] has a series of nasalized [[click consonant]]s in which the nasal airstream is pulmonic ingressive. Ladefoged &amp; Maddieson (1996:268) state, "This ǃXóõ click is probably unique among the sounds of the world's languages that, even in the middle of a sentence, it may have ingressive pulmonic airflow."

In the [[extensions to the International Phonetic Alphabet]], ingressive sounds are indicated with {{angle bracket|{{IPA|↓}}}} so the [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] backchanneling particles ''ja'' and ''nei'' would be transcribed {{angle bracket|{{IPA|jɑː↓}}}} and {{angle bracket|{{IPA|næɪ↓}}}}.

Laver&lt;ref&gt;Laver (1994) ''Principles of Phonetics'', p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; uses {{angle bracket|{{IPA|˒}}}} instead for {{angle bracket|{{IPA|j˒ɑː˒}}}} and {{angle bracket|{{IPA|n˒æɪ˒}}}}.&lt;ref&gt;The diacritic is acually centered on the ''x''-height, rather than resting on the baseline.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ingressive speech==
Ingressive speech sounds are produced while the speaker breathes in, in contrast to most speech sounds, which are produced as the speaker breathes out. The air that is used to voice the speech is drawn in rather than pushed out. Ingressive speech can be glottalic, velaric, or pulmonic.

===Occurrence===
Ingressive sounds occur in many languages, being frequently associated with [[Scandinavian languages]] despite being a common phenomenon. Most words that are subject to ingressive speech are feedback words ("yes, no") or very short or primal (a cry of pain or sobbing). It sometimes occurs in rapid counting to maintain a steady air flow throughout a long series of unbroken sounds. It is also very common in animals, frogs, dogs, and cats (purring).

In [[English language|English]], ingressive sounds include when one says "Huh!" (a gasping sound) to express surprise or "Sss" (an inward hiss) to express empathy when another is hurt.

[[Tsou language|Tsou]] and Damin have both been claimed to possess an ingressive phoneme, but neither claim has been validated to date, and the Tsou claim has been nearly disproved.
There are claims of [[Tohono O'odham]] women speaking entirely ingressively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eklund|first1=R|title=Pulmonic ingressive speech: a neglected universal?|journal=Fonetik 2007, 30 May–1 June 2007, Stockholm, Sweden|pages= 21–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are examples of ingressive sounds that belong to paralanguage. [[Japanese language|Japanese]] has what has been described an apicoprepalatal fricative approximant, similar to an inbreathed [s], as a response to statements that are upsetting or as a sign of deference. Japanese-speakers also use an ingressive bilateral bidental friction as a "pre-turn opening in conversation" or to begin a prayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ling.upenn.edu/phonetics/archive/docs/Airstreams.pdf | title=Airstream Mechanisms | publisher=Department of Linguistics | accessdate=July 19, 2016 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620202816/http://www.ling.upenn.edu/phonetics/archive/docs/Airstreams.pdf | archivedate=June 20, 2010 | deadurl=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=9W49AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA162&amp;dq=apicoprepalatal+fricative+approximant#v=onepage&amp;q=apicoprepalatal%20fricative%20approximant&amp;f=false | title=Nonverbal Communication across Disciplines: Volume 2: Paralanguage, kinesics, silence, personal and environmental interaction | publisher=John Benjamins Publishing | author=Poyatos, Fernando | year=2002 | pages=162 | isbn=9789027297112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distribution===
Speech technologist Robert Eklund has found reports of ingressive speech in around 50 languages worldwide, dating as far back as Cranz's (1765) "Historie von Grönland, enthaltend…," which mentions it in female affirmations among the [[Eskimo]].
{{Listen|filename=Ja ingressive.ogg|title=Norwegian "Ja"|description=[[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] spoken ''ja'' juxtaposed with ingressive|format=[[Ogg]]}}

===Inhaled affirmative 'yeah'===
Several languages include an affirmative "yeah," "yah," "yuh," or "yes" that is made with inhaled breath, which sounds something like a gasp. That is an example of a pulmonic ingressive and is found as follows:

* Dialects of English spoken in [[Ireland]] ([[Hiberno-English]]) and the [[Scottish Highlands]] ([[Highland English]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract;jsessionid=506B7CE59AFF28EF5181B532DE5075D5.tomcat1?fromPage=online&amp;aid=3117564 Robert Eklund (2008)]: Pulmonic ingressive phonation: Diachronic and synchronic characteristics, distribution and function in animal and human sound production and in human speech, ''Journal of the International Phonetic Association'', vol. 38, no. 3, pp. 235–324.&lt;/ref&gt; typically used to express agreement and show attentiveness.
* Dialects of [[English language|English]] spoken in [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] and [[the Maritimes]] in [[Canada]].&lt;ref name="CBCBird"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bird|first1=Lindsay|title=An Atlantic Canadian speech pattern, explained 'Ingressive pulmonic speech' used only in a few parts of the world|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/atlantic-canadian-speech-pattern-explained-1.3801351|publisher=[[CBC News]]|accessdate=17 October 2016|date=Oct 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Dialects of English spoken in the state of [[Maine]]. The word is often transcribed as "ayup," and people attempting to imitate [[Maine accent]] rarely use the ingressive form. It is missing in most Maine-dialect television and Hollywood productions.
* Casual [[French language|French]] ([http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ouais ''ouais'']).
* In [[Faroese language|Faroese]] and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], entire phrases are sometimes produced ingressively.
* In [[Danish language|Danish]], Norwegian, and [[Swedish language|Swedish]], words like "ja", "jo" (yes), "nei/nej" (no) are often pronounced with inhaled breath, which can be confusing to foreigners. The main function of inhaled speech can be paralinguistic, showing agreement with a statement and encouraging a speaker to continue, but in northern [[Sweden]], "Yes" can be replaced with an inhalation alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gee|first1=Oliver|title=Is this the strangest sound in Swedish?|url=http://www.thelocal.se/20150108/is-this-the-strangest-sound-in-the-swedish-language|website=TheLocal.se|accessdate=25 January 2015|date=8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is consequently also typical of dialogue.
* In [[Low German|Northern German dialects]], an affirmative "ja" (yes) is often pronounced ingressively, especially in dialogue.
* In [[Finnish language|Finnish]], ''niin''.&lt;ref&gt;Cfr. http://www.suomienglantisanakirja.fi/niin third and fourth acceptions&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=May 2017}}
* In [[Estonian language|Estonian]] "jah" (yes).
* In [[Mongolian language|Khalkha Mongolian]], the words '''тийм''' {{IPA-mn|tʰiːm|}} ("that/[yes]"), '''үгүй''' {{IPA|[ʊɡʊi]}} ("no"), and '''мэдэхгүй''' {{IPA|[mɛdɛx-ɡʊi]}} know.{{sc|inf-neg}} ("[I] don't know") are often pronounced in daily conversation with pulmonic ingressive airflow.
* In [[Ewe language|Ewe]] and other [[Togolese languages]], as well as in parts of [[Mali]] and [[Cameroon]] and in the [[Hausa language]] of southern [[Niger]] and northern [[Nigeria]].
* In [[Austronesian languages]] such as [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] {{IPA|[opo]}} and more forcefully in [[Waray language|Waray]] and softer in [[Borongan]] ([[Samar (province)|Samar Province]]) {{IPA|[uhuh]}} or {{IPA|[ohoh]}} usually spelled in these countries ''oo'' and possibly stronger in [[Oras, Eastern Samar|Oras]], [[Arteche, Eastern Samar|Arteche]], [[Dolores, Eastern Samar|Dolores]] (all in Samar). The sound is almost guttural and the aspirant is inhaled, not exhaled, air. Thus, for an English-speaker exhaling the response, the exhaled sound is not understood by native Samar-speakers. The [[American English]] trouble expression "[[uh-oh (expression)|uh-oh]]" does not approximate it. Eastern, Western, and Northern Samar have different accents in the same dialect.

'''Janet Evanovich''' (born '''Janet Schneider'''; April 22, 1943) is an American writer. She began her career writing short contemporary [[romance novels]] under the pen name '''Steffie Hall''', but gained fame authoring a series of contemporary mysteries featuring [[Stephanie Plum]], a former lingerie buyer from [[Trenton, New Jersey]], who becomes a [[bounty hunter]] to make ends meet after losing her job. The novels in this series have been on ''The New York Times'', [[USA Today]], ''[[The Wall Street Journal|Wall Street Journal]]'' and [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] bestseller lists. Evanovich has had her last seventeen Plums debut at #1 on the ''NY Times'' Best Sellers list and eleven of them have hit #1 on ''USA Today'' Best-Selling Books list. She has over two hundred million books in print worldwide and is translated into over 40 languages.

== Early years ==
Evanovich is a second-generation American born in [[South River, New Jersey]] to a [[machinist]] and a housewife.&lt;ref name="cochran"/&gt; After attending [[South River High School (New Jersey)|South River High School]],&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, Debra. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9802E3DA113FF930A35752C1A9649C8B63 "IN PERSON; Imagine Trenton. One Author Did."], ''The New York Times'', November 3, 2002. Accessed March 20, 2011. "She graduated from South River High School, married her high school sweetheart and attended Douglass College.... If there is a typical career path for novelists, Mrs. Evanovich is certain that she has not followed it. After growing up in South River, she followed her husband, who was in the Navy, as he moved around the country, stayed at home and raised their two children and then, when she was in her 30s, decided that she wanted to write."&lt;/ref&gt; she became the first in her family to attend college when she enrolled at [[Douglass College]], part of [[Rutgers University]], to study art.&lt;ref name="macdonald"&gt;{{cite web|last=MacDonald|first=Jay|title=Fame and Fortune: Author Janet Evanovich|publisher=Bankrate.com|date=October 24, 2006|accessdate=2007-08-14|url=http://www.bankrate.com/cbsmw/news/investing/Oct06_fame_fortune_Janet_Evanovich_a3.asp}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=white/&gt;

When Evanovich had children, she chose to become a housewife like her mother. In her thirties, she began writing novels.&lt;ref name="cochran"/&gt; To learn the art of writing dialog, Evanovich took lessons in [[Improvisational theatre|improv acting]].&lt;ref name=white/&gt; For ten years, she attempted to write the [[Great American Novel]], finishing three manuscripts that she was unable to sell. After someone suggested she try writing [[romance novels]], Evanovich read several romances and discovered that she enjoyed the genre. She wrote two romances and submitted them for publishing.&lt;ref name="jean"&gt;{{cite web|last=Jean|first=Lorna|publisher=All About Romance|title=Quickie with Janet Evanovich on her Stephanie Plum Series|date=September 18, 1998|url=http://www.likesbooks.com/quick20.html|accessdate=2007-08-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070906013522/http://www.likesbooks.com/quick20.html|archivedate=September 6, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still unable to find a publisher, Evanovich stopped writing and signed with a temporary employment agency. Several months after beginning work for them, she received an offer to buy her second romance manuscript for $2,000, which she considered an "astounding sum."&lt;ref name=white&gt;{{cite web|last=White|first=Claire E.|title=A Conversation with Janet Evanovich|publisher=The Internet Writing Journal|accessdate=2007-08-13|url=http://www.writerswrite.com/journal/jan99/evanovch.htm|date=January 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Romance novels==
That novel, ''Hero at Large'', was published in 1987 in the Second Chance Love category line under the pseudonym Steffie Hall.&lt;ref name="cochran"/&gt; The following year she began writing for Bantam Loveswept under her own name.&lt;ref name="jean"/&gt; For the next five years she continued to write category romances for Loveswept.&lt;ref name=white/&gt; Her work within the romance novel genre helped her learn to create likable characters and attractive leading men.&lt;ref name="ward"/&gt; In this time, Evanovich also became known for the humor that filled her novels. She believes that "it's very important to take a comic approach. If we can laugh at something, we can face it."&lt;ref name="jakeman"/&gt;

After finishing her twelfth romance, however, Evanovich realized that she was more interested in writing the action sequences in her novels than the sex scenes. Her editors were not interested in her change of heart, so Evanovich took the next eighteen months to formulate a plan for what she actually wanted to write.&lt;ref name="cochran"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Cochran |first=Tracy |title=Jersey Janet Takes on the World |newspaper=[[Publishers Weekly]] |date=June 30, 2003 |accessdate=2007-08-13 |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA308240.html?display=current&amp;industry=Features&amp;verticalid=792&amp;q=romance+writers+of+america |postscript= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203145352/http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA308240.html?display=current&amp;industry=Features&amp;verticalid=792&amp;q=romance%2Bwriters%2Bof%2Bamerica |archivedate=February 3, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stephanie Plum Series===
She quickly decided that she wanted to write romantic adventure novels.&lt;ref name="tierney"/&gt; Unlike the style of romance novels, her books would be told in [[first person narrative]].&lt;ref name="white"/&gt; Her new type of writing should contain heroes and heroines, as well as "a sense of family and community."&lt;ref name="cochran"/&gt; In that vein, she intended her new style of writing to be based on the TV sitcom model. Like [[Seinfeld]], her new books would have a central character that the rest of the cast of characters revolve around.&lt;ref name="tierney"&gt;{{cite web|last=Tierney|first=Bruce|title=Janet Evanovich: Mystery maven keeps readers coming back for more|publisher=BookPage|date=July 2000|accessdate=2007-08-14|url=http://www.bookpage.com/0007bp/janet_evanovich.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703015540/http://www.bookpage.com/0007bp/janet_evanovich.html|archivedate=July 3, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspired by the [[Robert De Niro]] movie ''[[Midnight Run]]'', Evanovich decided that her heroine would be a [[bounty hunter]].&lt;ref name="cochran"/&gt; This occupation provided more freedom for Evanovich as a writer, as bounty hunters do not have a set work schedule and are not forced to wear a uniform. The profession is also "romanticised to some extent."&lt;ref name="jakeman"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Jakeman |first=Jane |title=The Books Interview:Janet Evanovich – Plum jobs for a woman of parts |newspaper=The (London) Independent |date=October 21, 2000 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20001021/ai_n14357679 |accessdate=2007-08-14 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080211192718/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20001021/ai_n14357679 |archivedate=February 11, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; To become acquainted with the demands of the career, Evanovich spent a great deal of time shadowing bond enforcement agents. She also researched more about the city of [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]], where she wanted her books to be set.&lt;ref name="cochran"/&gt;

In 1994, her initial romantic adventure, ''[[One for the Money (novel)|One for the Money]]'', was published to good reviews.&lt;ref name="cochran"/&gt; This was the first of a light-hearted series of mysteries starring barely competent bounty hunter [[Stephanie Plum]]. ''One for the Money'' was named a ''New York Times'' notable book, a ''Publishers Weekly'' Best Book of 1994 and a ''USA Today'' Best Bet.&lt;ref name="hayward"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Hayward|first=Mike|title=Interview: Janet Evanovich discusses Twelve Sharp and much else, with Mike Hayward |publisher=BookBrowse|url=http://www.bookbrowse.com/author_interviews/full/index.cfm?author_number=232|year=2006|accessdate=2007-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evanovich has continued to write romantic adventures starring Stephanie Plum. The sixth book in the series, ''Hot Six'', was the first of her novels to reach number one on the [[New York Times Best Seller List]].&lt;ref name="macdonald"/&gt; Her subsequent Plum novels have each debuted at number one.&lt;ref name="cruz"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Cruz|first=Gilbert|title=How Janet Evanovich broke through|newspaper=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=June 2, 2006|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1199996,00.html|accessdate=2007-08-14|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''All About Romance'' has described her as the "rare breed of romance author who has left the genre and yet not alienated her many romance fans."&lt;ref name="jean"/&gt;

The Plum novels have taken many attributes from Evanovich's own life. Evanovich shares many commonalities with her character Stephanie Plum. Both are from New Jersey, both devour Cheetos, both had owned a hamster, and both have shared "similar embarrassing experiences."&lt;ref name=white/&gt; The character Grandma Mazur is loosely based on Evanovich's "Grandma Fanny" and "Aunt Lena."

Shortly before ''[[One for the Money (novel)|One for the Money]]'' was released, Evanovich sold the movie rights to [[Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group|Columbia TriStar]] for $1 million.&lt;ref name="macdonald"/&gt; [[Lions Gate Entertainment]] released ''[[One for the Money (film)|One for the Money]]'' on January 27, 2012. The film stars [[Katherine Heigl]] as Stephanie Plum, [[Sherri Shepherd]] from ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]'' as Lula, [[Debbie Reynolds]] as Grandma Mazur, [[Jason O'Mara]] as Joe Morelli, and [[Daniel Sunjata]] as Ranger.

===Knight &amp; Moon  Series===
In 2016 Evanovich released the first book, ''Curious Minds'', in her new Knight &amp; Moon mystery series.  Co-authored with Phoef Sutton, the book introduces two new characters, Emerson Knight and Riley Moon.  Emerson Knight is a rich, eccentric introvert with little-to-no sense of social etiquette.  He is also brilliant and handsome.  Riley Moon is a recent Harvard Law and Harvard Business graduate.  Her aggressive Texas spitfire attitude helped her land her dream job as a junior analyst at Blane-Grunwald where Emerson is a client.  Together this unlikely duo finds themselves thrust into solving the most difficult of mysteries.

''Dangerous Minds'', the second book in the series, was written by Evanovich and released in June 2017.

===Wicked Series===
In 2010 Evanovich published ''Wicked Appetite'', spinning off the character Diesel from the between-the-numbers Plum books.  The heroine of ''Wicked Appetite'' is sweet cupcake baker Lizzie Tucker, who, unlike Stephanie Plum, can cook.  The "Wicked" series is set in Salem, Massachusetts.  In the series, Diesel &amp; Lizzie search for the seven stones of power, each representing a different deadly sin.  Lizzie &amp; Diesel are "Unmentionables", humans with additional powers. Their rivals for the stones are Diesel's dark cousin, Gerwulf "Wulf" Grimoire, introduced in ''Plum Spooky'' and his medieval-esque minion Hatchet.  Lizzie's animal companions are one-eyed Cat 7143 and Carl the Monkey, from ''Fearless Fourteen'' and ''Plum Spooky''.   Her friends include Glo, a "Questionable," and Clara Dazzle, an "Unmentionable" who lost her powers after congress with another "Unmentionable."  In ''Wicked Appetite'', the stone sought is that incarnating the sin of gluttony.

In 2012 Evanovich published ''Wicked Business'', the second in the series.  In ''Wicked Business'', the stone embodies the sin of lust.  A new villain is introduced, deranged candy heiress Deirdre Early, or Anarchy.  Lizzie, through a selfless act and exchange of body fluids with Wulf, converts the lust stone into the "icky true love stone", implying that in the right circumstances, the stones of sin can be converted into stones of virtue.

In 2015 Evanovich teamed up with [[Phoef Sutton]] for the third novel in the series, ''Wicked Charms''. The Stone of Avarice (Greed) is the focus of this installment.&lt;ref name="charms"/&gt;

===Fox and O'Hare Series===
In June 2013, Evanovich published the novella "Pros &amp; Cons" and the novel ''The Heist'', the first two works in a new series co-written with [[Lee Goldberg]]. Since then the series has grown to five novels (The Heist, The Chase, The Job, The Scam, and The Pursuit), two novellas (Pros &amp; Cons and The Shell Game) and one online short-story, The Caper.

The protagonist is FBI special agent Kate O’Hare who has devoted her career to taking down one of the FBI’s most wanted con men and master thieves, Nick Fox. That is until the FBI pairs Kate with the most unlikely person, Nick Fox, to take down criminals. Together they travel the globe skirting on the edge of what is legal and illegal. Kate’s father, Jake O’Hare, a retired Special Forces operative, often aids in their quest.  In June 2016, the fifth novel in the series, The Pursuit, was released.

===Other novels===
Evanovich began a collaborative effort with Charlotte Hughes because she wanted to see some of her other ideas on paper but did not have the time to write them. This resulted in the "Full" series.  The "Full" series is set in Beaumont, South Carolina and features Jamie Swift and Maximillian Holt, who meet in the second "Full" book, ''Full Tilt''.&lt;ref name="ward"/&gt;

The ''Elsie Hawkins'' novels are stand alone romances with a supporting character Elsie Hawkins, who is a gun totin' retiree, with tight grey curls, who "doesn't take sass from no one."  Elsie drives a 1957 powder blue Cadillac that never seems to sustain damage.  In the Stephanie Plum series, Grandma Mazur and Stephanie drive Uncle Sandor's 1953 powder blue Buick,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Evanovich|first=Janet|title=Three To Get Deadly|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has similar indestructibility.

In 2004, Evanovich launched another series with ''Metro Girl.'' This book debuted at Number 2 on the New York Times Best Seller List.&lt;ref name="cruz"/&gt; The heroine is Alexandra Barnaby, an auto mechanic.  Her love interest is Sam Hooker, a hedonistic NASCAR driver.  The "Motor" series is set in the southern U.S. states.  Further books in the series include ''Motor Mouth'' and ''Troublemaker 1 &amp; 2'' (graphic novels).

Evanovich collaborated with [[Stephen J. Cannell]], noted T.V. writer and producer (''A Team, Rockford Files, Baretta, 21 Jump Street''), on a book entitled ''No Chance'', which was to be the first book in a new series. It was supposed to be released in October 2007. However, in July 2007, the book was canceled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediabistro.com/galleycat/authors/no_chance_of_evanovichcannell_collaboration_63020.asp No Chance of Evanovich/Cannell Collaboration] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070826102131/http://www.mediabistro.com/galleycat/authors/no_chance_of_evanovichcannell_collaboration_63020.asp |date=August 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen J. Cannell died in 2010 of melanoma.

==Personal life==
During the week, Evanovich works eight or more hours per day. On weekends she generally works for an additional four hours each day.&lt;ref name=white/&gt; She generally creates a brief outline before beginning a new book, with one or two sentences about what will happen in each chapter.&lt;ref name="ward"/&gt; Upon the release of a new book, Evanovich regularly goes on book tours. Her book signings attracted thousands of people. Beginning with her third Stephanie Plum book, ''Three to Get Deadly,'' and ending with ''Smokin' Seventeen'', all of the titles have been chosen from fan submissions.&lt;ref name="cruz"/&gt;

Evanovich lives in Florida with her husband, Pete, whom she married in 1964. Pete is of [[Serbs|Serbian]] ancestry. Members of Evanovich's family are employed by her company, Evanovich Inc., including her husband, Pete, son, Peter, and daughter Alexandra.

Evanovich's niece (by marriage) is author Stephanie Evanovich. (Stephanie's father is the brother of Janet's husband, Pete.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.likesbooks.com/blog/?p=10266 A Tale of Two Evanoviches]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Kazuyo Sejima'''|妹島 和世|Sejima Kazuyo|born 29 October 1956}} is a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[architect]]. She is known for designs with clean [[Modern architecture|modernist]] elements such as slick, clean, and shiny surfaces made of glass, marble, and metals. She also uses squares and cubes, which can be found in her designs in various degrees. Large windows allow natural light to enter a space and create a fluid transition between interior and exterior. It is this connection of two spaces from which she draws her inspiration.

Kazuyo Sejima, along with and [[Ryue Nishizawa]], has worked on several projects in Germany, Switzerland, France, England, the Netherlands, United States, and Spain. Many of their designs like the [[Rolex Learning Center]] at [[EPFL]] the [[New Museum]] in the Bowery District in New York City as well as the [[Toledo Museum of Art#Glass Pavilion|Glass Pavilion]] for the Toledo Museum of Art involve glass and public open space to interact with the world around the architecture. Such design elements can be found abundantly in their designs.

In 2010, Sejima was the second woman to receive the [[Pritzker Prize]], which was awarded jointly with [[Ryue Nishizawa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dsdha.co.uk/gridfs/5756b92400dd7c0003000024|publisher=[[Architectural Digest]]|author=Nonie Niesewand|date=March 2015|title=Through the Glass Ceiling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Sejima was born on 29 October 1956 at [[Mito, Ibaraki]], Japan. She graduated from [[Japan Women's University]] in 1979. She then went on to complete the Master's Degree course in architecture in 1981. In the same year, she began working with the architecture firm Toyo Ito and Associates until 1987.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yoshida|first=Nobuyuki|date=Fall 1999|title=Kazuyo Seijima: Profile|url=|journal=The Japan Architect|volume=35|pages=126-127|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After apprenticing with [[Toyo Ito]], Sejima established Kazuyo Sejima &amp; Associates in 1987. One of her first hires was [[Ryue Nishizawa]], a student who had worked with Sejima at Toyo Ito and Associates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Kazuyo Sejima and Ryue Nishizawa {{!}} biography - Japanese architects|url = http://www.britannica.com/biography/Kazuyo-Sejima-and-Ryue-Nishizawa|website = Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate = 2015-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; After working for Sejima for several years, Sejima asked him to form a partnership. In 1995, the two founded the [[Tokyo]]-based firm [[sanaa (firm)|SANAA]] (Sejima and Nishizawa and Associates).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Kazuyo Sejima &amp; Ryue Nishizawa Successes stack up for Tokyo design duo: Sanaa interviewed by Japan Times|url = http://architecturalinterviews.blogspot.com/2009/12/kazuyo-sejima-ryue-nishizawa-successes.html|website = architectural interviews|date = 2009-12-28|accessdate = 2015-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Sejima was appointed director of architecture sector for the [[Venice Biennale]], which she curated for the 12th Annual International Architecture Exhibition. She was the first woman ever selected for this position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.artnet.com/art-world/female-designers-breaking-the-mold-671504|title=10 Female Designers Breaking the Mold|date=4 October 2016|publisher=ArtNet|author=Rain Embuscado}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, she was awarded the [[Pritzker Prize]], together with Ryue Nishizawa.&lt;ref name="Pritzker"&gt;[http://www.pritzkerprize.com/laureates/2010/textmediakit.html Pritzker Prize 2010 Media Kit], retrieved 29 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Approach ==
When describing Sejima's work, a viewer would notice that she mostly uses glass in all of her work. She likes slick surfaces such as marble, and her buildings mainly display an arrange of curves within the architecture of the building as well as on the surface. Kazuyo successfully combines the building with the surrounding areas. The use of a lot of sheer glasses and clear glass is used, allowing for a person to look at the outdoors, while also looking at themselves and the reflections the outside world creates on the inside of the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.pritzkerprize.com/2010/essay|title = Essay: Kazuyo Sejima and Ryue Nishizawa {{!}} The Pritzker Architecture Prize|website = www.pritzkerprize.com|access-date = 2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.bloomberg.com/ss/10/03/0301_most_anticipated_architecture/10.htm|title = The World's Most Anticipated Architecture: Rolex Learning Center - BusinessWeek|website = Businessweek.com|access-date = 2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.pritzkerprize.com/2010/essay|title = Essay: Kazuyo Sejima and Ryue Nishizawa {{!}} The Pritzker Architecture Prize|website = www.pritzkerprize.com|access-date = 2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.bloomberg.com/ss/10/03/0301_most_anticipated_architecture/10.htm|title = The World's Most Anticipated Architecture: Rolex Learning Center - BusinessWeek|website = Businessweek.com|access-date = 2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sejima intentionally overturns outmoded stereotypical housing models as they are based on assumptions instead of reality. These assumptions include housing models that illustrate the proper living condition for a nuclear family, etc. Her idea is not to initiate a complete rejection to tradition, but rather to challenge the conventional process of design. Instead of unconsciously applying assumptions to a design, she tries to confront them consciously as best as she can. She thinks it is impossible to let a building completely based on a fictional idea or theory of what something should be.&lt;ref&gt;Sejima, Kazuyo. ''Kazuyo Sejima, 1988-1996''. Ed. C. Levene and Fernando Marquez Cecilia. Barcelona: El Croquis, 1996. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kütahya''' ({{IPA-tr|cyˈtahja}}) is a city in western [[Turkey]] with 237,804 inhabitants (2011 estimate), lying on the [[Porsuk River|Porsuk]] river, at 969 metres above sea level. It is the capital of [[Kütahya Province]], inhabited by some 564 294 people (2011 estimate). The region of Kütahya has large areas of gentle slopes with agricultural land culminating in high mountain ridges to the north and west.
The city's Greek name was '''Kotyaion'''{{Pronunciation-needed}}, [[Latinisation of names|Latinized]] in Roman times as '''Cotyaeum'''{{Pronunciation-needed}}.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04422a.htm Catholic Encyclopaedia: Cotiaeum.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Kutahya|title=Kütahya Turkey, britannica.com|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Kütahya is remembered as Cotyaeum during classical times. It later became part of the [[Roman province]] of [[Phrygia Salutaris]],&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Gelzer, [https://archive.org/stream/abhandlungenbay06klasgoog#page/n579/mode/1up ''Ungedruckte und ungenügend veröffentlichte Texte der Notitiae episcopatuum''], in: Abhandlungen der philosophisch-historische classe der bayerische Akademie der Wissenschaften, 1901, p. 540, nº 338.&lt;/ref&gt; but in about 820 became the capital of the new province of Phrygia Salutaris III. Its bishopric thus changed from being a [[suffragan]] of [[Synnada in Phrygia|Synnada]] to a [[metropolitan see]], although with only three suffragan sees according to the ''[[Notitia Episcopatuum]]'' of [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Leo VI the Wise]] (886-912), which is dated to around 901-902.&lt;ref&gt;Gelzer, ''op. cit.'', p. 559, nnº 650-653.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 6th-century historian [[John Malalas]], [[Cyrus of Panopolis]], who had been prefect of the city of Constantinople, was sent there as bishop by Emperor [[Theodosius II]] (408-50), after four bishops of the city had been killed. Two other sources makes Cyrus bishop of [[Smyrna]] instead. The bishopric of Cotyaeum was headed in 431 by Domnius, who was at the [[Council of Ephesus]], and in 451 by Marcianus, who was at the [[Council of Chalcedon]]. A source cited by [[Lequien]] says that a bishop of Cotyaeum named Eusebius was at the [[Second Council of Constantinople]] in 553. Cosmas was at the [[Third Council of Constantinople]] in 680–681. Ioannes, a deacon, represented an unnamed bishop of Cotyaeum at the [[Trullan Council]] in 692. Bishop Constantinus was at the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] in 692, and Bishop Anthimus at the [[Photius|Photian]] [[Council of Constantinople (879)]],&lt;ref&gt;Michel Lequien, [https://books.google.com/books?id=0agp0mJFG_sC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Oriens christianus in quatuor Patriarchatus digestus''], Paris 1740, Vol. I, coll. 851-852&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Janin, v. ''Cotyaeum'', in [http://booksnow.scholarsportal.info/ebooks/oca2/4/dictionnairedhis13bauduoft/dictionnairedhis13bauduoft.pdf ''Dictionnaire d'Histoire et de Géographie ecclésiastiques''], vol. XIII, Paris 1956, coll. 938-940&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pius Bonifacius Gams, [http://www.wbc.poznan.pl/dlibra/doccontent?id=65154&amp;dirids=1 ''Series episcoporum Ecclesiae Catholicae''], Leipzig 1931, p.&amp;nbsp;447&lt;/ref&gt; No longer a residential bishopric, Cotyaeum is today listed by the [[Catholic Church]] as a [[titular see]].&lt;ref&gt;''Annuario Pontificio 2013'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 {{ISBN|978-88-209-9070-1}}), p. 875&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the reign of Byzantine Emperor [[Justinian I]] the town was fortified with a double-line of walls and citadel. In 1071 Cotyaeum (or Kotyaion) fell to the [[Seljuk Turks]] and later switched hands, falling successively to the [[Crusaders]], [[Germiyanid]]s, [[Timur-Leng]] (Tamerlane), until finally being incorporated into the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1428.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.turkeyforyou.com/turkey_kutahya_history|title=History of Kutahya|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time a large number of Christian [[Armenians]] settled in Kotyaion/Kütahya, where they came to dominate the tile-making and ceramic ware production.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard G. Hovannisian|Hovannisian, Richard G.]] and Armen Manuk-Khaloyan, "The Armenian Communities of Asia Minor," in ''Armenian Communities of Asia Minor'', ed. Richard G. Hovannisian. UCLA Armenian History and Culture Series: Historic Armenian Cities and Provinces, 13. Costa Mesa, CA: Mazda Publishers, 2014, pp. 32-34.&lt;/ref&gt; With this, Kütahya emerged as a renowned center for the Ottoman ceramic industry, producing tiles and [[faience]] for mosques, churches, and official buildings in places all over the [[Middle East]].&lt;ref&gt;See Dickran Kouymjian, "The Role of Armenian Potters of Kutahia in the Ottoman Ceramic Industry," in ''Armenian Communities of Asia Minor'', pp. 107-30.&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially center of [[Anatolia Eyalet]] till 1827, when [[Hüdavendigâr Eyalet]] was formed. It was later sanjak centre in [[Hüdavendigâr Vilayet]] in 1867. It was briefly occupied by troops of [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt]] in 1833.

The fortifications of the city and its environs, which were vital to the security and economic prosperity of the region, have been built and rebuilt from antiquity through the Ottoman Period.&lt;ref name="foss"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Foss|first1=Clive| title=Survey of the Medieval Castles of Anatolia: Kütahya| date=1985|publisher=BAR| location=Oxford, U.K.|pages=12ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the dates assigned to the many periods of construction and the assessment of the military architecture are open to various interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Robert W., “Medieval Castles of Anatolia: Kütahya,” ''Speculum: A Journal of Medieval Studies'' 62.3, 1987, pp.675-680.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the nineteenth century, Kütahya's population was counted at 120,333, of which 4,050 were [[Greeks]], 2,533 Armenians, 754 [[Catholics]], and the remainder Turks and other Muslims.&lt;ref name="Hov and Man"&gt;Hovannisian and Manuk-Khaloyan, "The Armenian Communities of Asia Minor," p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; It is noteworthy that Kütahya and the district itself were spared the ravages of the [[Armenian Genocide]] of 1915, when the Turkish governor went to extreme lengths to protect the Armenian population from being uprooted and sent away on death marches.&lt;ref name="Hov and Man"/&gt; Kütahya was occupied by [[Greece|Greek]] troops on 17 July 1921 after [[Battle of Kütahya–Eskişehir]] during [[Turkish War of Independence]] and captured in ruins{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} after the [[Battle of Dumlupınar]] during the [[Great Offensive]] on 30 August 1922.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ole-nikolajsen.com/TURKISH%20FORCES%202004/indwar.pdf|title=Gamblers on Turkish Brink|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://i-cias.com/e.o/kutahya.htm|title=Kütahya|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
[[File:Asarkaya.JPG|thumb|200px|[[Tourism in Turkey|History tourism]] is an important economic of the city.]]
The industries of Kütahya have long traditions, going back to ancient times. Kütahya is famous for its [[kiln]] products, such as [[tiles]] and [[pottery]], which are glazed and multicoloured.&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Glassie]], ''Turkish Traditional Art Today'' Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1993, pp. 435 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern industries are [[sugar]] refining, [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]], [[nitrate]] processing and different products of [[meerschaum]], which is extracted nearby. The local agricultural industry produces [[cereals]], [[fruits]] and [[sugar beet]]. In addition [[livestock|stock]] raising is of much importance. Not far from Kütahya there are important [[mining|mines]] extracting [[lignite]].

Kütahya is linked by rail and road with [[Balıkesir]] {{convert|250|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} to the west, [[Konya]] {{convert|450|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} to the southeast, [[Eskişehir]] {{convert|70|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} northeast and [[Ankara]] {{convert|300|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} east.

A small [[ewer]], now in the [[British Museum]], gave its name to a category of similar blue and white [[fritware]] pottery known as 'Abraham of Kütahya ware'. It has an inscription in [[Armenian alphabet|Armenian script]] under the glaze on its base stating that it commemorated Abraham of Kütahya with a date of 1510.&lt;ref name="BritMus"&gt;'Abraham of Kütahya' ewer, British Museum Accession Code: [https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_details.aspx?objectid=236618&amp;partid=1 G.1]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957 Arthur Lane published an influential article in which he reviewed the history of pottery production in the region and proposed that 'Abraham of Kütahya' ware was produced from 1490 until around 1525, 'Damascus' and 'Golden Horn' ware were produced from 1525 until 1555 and 'Rhodian' ware from around 1555 until the demise of the [[İznik pottery]] industry at the beginning of the 18th century. This chronology has been generally accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Iznik: The Pottery of Ottoman Turkey |series= |author=Nurhan Atasoy and Julian Raby (authors), Yanni Petsopoulos (editor) |year=1989 |location=London |publisher=Alexandria Press |page= |isbn=978-1-85669-054-6 |quote= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kütahya's old neighbourhoods are dominated by traditional Ottoman houses made of wood and [[stucco]], some of the best examples being found along Germiyan Caddesi. It has many historical mosques such as Ulu Camii, Cinili Camii, Balikli  Camii and Donenler Camii. The Şengül Hamamı is a famous Turkish bath located in the city

The town preserves some ancient ruins, a Byzantine castle and church. During late centuries Kütahya has been renowned for its Turkish earthenware, of which fine specimens may be seen at the national capital. The Kütahya Museum has a fine collection of arts and cultural artifacts from the area, the house where [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] statesman [[Lajos Kossuth]] lived in exile between 1850-1851 is preserved as a museum.[http://www.rodosto.hu/en/kutahya.html]

The Main Campus and the Germiyan Campus of the [[Kütahya Dumlupınar University]] are located in the city.

      <comment>in the "by city" section someone keyed in Houston, Baton Rouge and Beaumont as cities #1, #2 and #3.  This can't be right.  Further, the graphic in that same area shows #1 as San Francisco (which makes sense, and which has the same 15.4% figure listed for Houston in the table), #2 as Seattle (again, makes sense, and it's the 12.9% listed for Baton Rouge), and Atlanta for #3 at 12.8%.  It seems like someone screwed with the cities listed in the table.  This is my first edit, sorry if it's verbose</comment>

{{Update|documentation|date=September 2015}}
The American cities with the highest gay populations are New York City with 272,493, Los Angeles with 154,270, Chicago with 114,449, and San Francisco with 94,234, as estimated by the Williams Institute in 2006.&lt;ref name=Williams/&gt; However, one is much more likely to encounter gay residents in San Francisco, Seattle, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Boston as a higher ''percentage'' of those cities' residents are gay or lesbian.

The U.S. metropolitan areas with the most gay residents are the New York, New York–Northern New Jersey–Long Island, New York metro with 568,903; followed by Los Angeles–Long Beach–Santa Ana, California with 442,211; and the Chicago-Naperville-Joliet, Illinois-Indiana-Wisconsin metro with 288,748.&lt;ref&gt;Note: the study cited is unclear as to the exact metro NY area that is included; on table 5, page 8, "New York–Northern New Jersey–Long Island" is included, but in Appendix 2, page 15, Pennsylvania also seems to be included as it states "New York–Northern New Jersey–Long Island, New York–NJ–PA"&lt;/ref&gt;

The charts below show a list of the top U.S. cities (in alphabetical order), metropolitan areas, and states with the highest population of gay residents and the highest percentage of gay residents (GLB population as a percentage of total residents based on available census data).&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;Gary J.

;1990
"Homosexuality/Heterosexuality: Concepts of Sexual Orientation" published findings of 13.95% of males and 4.25% of females having had either "extensive" or "more than incidental" homosexual experience.&lt;ref&gt;McWhirter, David P., Sanders, Stephanie A., &amp; Reinisch, June Machover(Eds.).

;1990
An extensive study on sexuality in general was conducted in the United States.  A significant portion of the study was geared towards homosexuality.  The results found that 8.6% of women and 10.1% of men had at one point in their life experienced some form of homosexuality.  Of these, 87% of women and 76% of men reported current [[same-sex attraction]]s, 41% of women and 52% of men had sex with someone of the same gender, and 16% of women and 27% of men identified as [[LGBT]].&lt;ref name=survey&gt;{{cite book

The American National Health Interview Survey conducts household interviews of the civilian non-institutionalized population. The results of three of these surveys, done in 1990–91 and based on over 9,000 responses each time, found between 2–3% of the people responding said yes to a set of statements which included "You are a man who has had sex with another man at some time since 1977, even one time."&lt;ref&gt;Dawson, D. &amp; Hardy, A.M.

The [[National Health and Social Life Survey]] asked 3,432 respondents whether they had any homosexual experience. The findings were 1.3% for women within the past year, and 4.1% since 18 years; for men, 2.7% within the past year, and 4.9% since 18 years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20011122111349/http://cloud9.norc.uchicago.edu/faqs/sex.htm Summary of The National Health and Social Life Survey ("The Sex Survey")]&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers Samuel and Cynthia Janus surveyed American adults aged 18 and over by distributing 4,550 questionnaires; 3,260 were returned and 2,765 were usable. The results of the cross-sectional nationwide survey stated men and women who reported frequent or ongoing homosexual experiences were 9% of men and 5% of women.&lt;ref&gt;Janus, Samuel S. &amp; Janus, Cynthia L.

Laumann et al. analyzed the National Health and Social Life Survey of 1992 which had surveyed 3,432 men and women in the United States between the ages of 18 and 59 and reported that the incidence rate of homosexual desire was 7.7% for men and 7.5% for women.&lt;ref&gt;Laumann, Edward O., Gagnon, John H., Michael, Robert T., and Michaels, Stuart (1994).

;1998
A random survey of 1672 males (number used for analysis) aged 15 to 19. Subjects were asked a number of questions, including questions relating to same-sex activity. This was done using two methods—a pencil and paper method, and via computer, supplemented by a verbal rendition of the questionnaire heard through headphones—which obtained vastly different results. There was a 400% increase in males reporting homosexual activity when the computer-audio system was used: from a 1.5% to 5.5% positive response rate; the homosexual behavior with the greatest reporting difference (800%, adjusted) was to the question "Ever had receptive anal sex with another male": 0.1% to 0.8%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Turner CF, Ku L, Rogers SM, Lindberg LD, Pleck JH, Sonenstein FL |title=Adolescent sexual behavior, drug use, and violence: increased reporting with computer survey technology |journal=Science  |volume=280 |issue=5365 |pages=867–73 |date=May 1998 |pmid=9572724 |doi=10.1126/science.280.5365.867}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;2000
During the [[2000 US presidential election]] campaign, market research firm [[Harris Insights &amp; Analytics|Harris Interactive]] studied the prevalence of a gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender identity employing three distinct methods. In phone interviews, 2% of the population self-identified as LGBT. Using in-person surveys with a blind envelope, that grew to 4%, and using online polls 6%. The group concluded that the difference between methods was due to the greater level of anonymity and privacy to online surveys, which provides more comfort to respondents to share their experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=http://www.witeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/partnership-with-harris-interactive.pdf|title=The GLBT Market Research Leaders - Hands Down|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith's 2003 analysis of [[National Opinion Research Center]] data&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061219090954/http://norc.uchicago.edu/issues/American_Sexual_Behavior_2003.pdf American Sexual Behavior: Trends, Socio-Demographic Differences, and Risk Behavior]&lt;/ref&gt; states that 4.9% of sexually active American males have had a male sexual partner since age 18, but that "since age 18 less than 1% are [exclusively] gay and 4+% bisexual". In the top twelve urban areas however, the rates are double the national average. Smith adds, "It is generally believed that including adolescent behavior would further increase these rates."&lt;!-- The European rates corroborate the figure of 4.9%, though when broader criteria are used (including manual contact) the rates almost triple, to 13.4% (Netherlands).  SOURCE PLEASE --&gt; The NORC data has been criticised because the original design sampling techniques were not followed, and depended upon direct self-report regarding [[masturbation]] and same sex behaviors. (For example, the original data in the early 1990s reported that approximately 40% of adult males had never masturbated—a finding inconsistent with some other studies.){{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Fried's 2008 analysis of [[General Social Survey]] data shows the percentage of United States males reporting homosexual activity for three time periods: 1988–92, 1993–98, and 2000–06.  These results are broken out by political party self-identification, and indicate increasing percentages, particularly among Democrats (perhaps reflecting, in the authors' view, either a shift of political allegiance among gay Americans, or increasing likelihood of acknowledging a homosexual orientation).&lt;ref&gt;Fried, Joseph, ''Democrats and Republicans – Rhetoric and Reality'' (New York: Algora Publishing, 2008), 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cornell University, carrying out research into sexuality amongst a representative sample of more than 20,000 young Americans, published that 14.4% of young women were not strictly heterosexual in behavior, a group that included lesbian and bisexual women; 5.6% of young men self-identified as being gay or bisexual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sax on Sex: The emerging science of sex differences |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/sax-sex/201004/why-are-so-many-girls-lesbian-or-bisexual?page=2 |newspaper= Psychology Today |date=3 April 2010 |accessdate=3 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an experiment, [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] concluded that the share of the population that is non-heterosexual has been significantly underestimated in surveys using traditional questioning methods, even if anonymous. In this study, it was found that, in all three facets of sexual orientation (identity, attraction, and behavior), the percentage of individuals who recognized themselves as non-heterosexual was larger when the survey method in use was the [[randomized response|item randomized response]], known to reduce socially desirable responding, in lieu of questions with direct responses. However, because the study was based on online volunteer samples and was therefore not nationally representative, researchers make no suggestion as to the real size of the LGBT population.&lt;ref name="nber.org"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Size of the LGBT Population and the Magnitude of Anti-Gay Sentiment are Substantially Underestimated |journal=Management Science |volume=63 |issue=10 |pages=3168–3186 |year=2013 |first1=Katherine B. |last1=Coffman |first2=Lucas C. |last2=Coffman |first3=Keith M.

Writing in the opinion section of ''The New York Times'' in 2013, Seth Stephens-Davidowitz estimated that roughly 5 percent of American men are "primarily attracted to men". First, using [[Facebook]] data and [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]] [[Opinion poll|poll]] results, he correlated the percentage of men who are openly gay with their state of birth and residence. Second, he measured what percentage of Google pornographic searches were for gay porn. The first method gave between 1 and 3 percent. The second showed that roughly 5 percent of men search for gay porn in every state. The figure was slightly higher in states considered gay-tolerant than in others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stephens-Davidowitz|first1=Seth|title=How Many American Men Are Gay|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/08/opinion/sunday/how-many-american-men-are-gay.html?pagewanted=all|website=nytimes.com|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=24 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;2014 General Social Survey behavior study
A study has also found that, based on the GSS, the proportion of men and women who self-report ever having had a same-sex sexual partner has steadily increased since the early 1990s. In the 1989-1994 period, 4.53% of men and 3.61% of women self-reported homosexual sex ever, which grew to 8.18% of men and 8.74% of women in the 2010-2014 period. The augmentation is mainly due to those who self-report sex with both genders; among those who have only had sex with the same gender, no clear pattern of increase emerged throughout the periods analyzed.&lt;ref&gt;http://psy2.fau.edu/~shermanr/Gay&amp;LesbianSex5-3-16.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>Rephrased comparison of Tunguska and Ch'ing-yang events to make clear that Tunguska event did not occur over a populated area and did not cause similar human destruction.</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41239">Many [[explosion]]s recorded in Earth's atmosphere are likely caused by the [[Bolide|air burst]] that results from a [[meteor]] exploding as it hits the thicker part of the [[atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]]. These types of meteors are also known as [[fireball (meteor)|fireballs]] or bolides with the brightest known as [[superbolide]]s. Before entering [[Earth's atmosphere]], these larger meteors were originally [[asteroid]]s and [[comet]]s of a few to several tens of meters in diameter, contrasting with the much smaller and much more common "[[Meteoroid#Meteors|shooting stars]]".

The most powerful recorded air burst is the 1908 [[Tunguska event]]. Extremely bright fireballs traveling across the sky are often witnessed from a distance, such as the 1947 [[Sikhote-Alin meteorite|Sikhote-Alin meteor]] and the 2013 [[Chelyabinsk meteor]], both in Russia. If the bolide is large enough, fragments may survive such as the [[Chelyabinsk meteorite]]. Modern developments in [[infrasound]] detection by the [[Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization]] and infrared [[Defense Support Program]] satellite technology have increased the likelihood of detecting airbursts.

== Frequency ==
The table from Earth Impact Effects Program (EIEP) estimates the average frequency of airbursts and their energy yield in kilotons (kt) or megatons (Mt) of [[TNT equivalent]].

While airbursts undoubtedly happened prior to the 20th century, reliable reports of such are quite scanty. A relatively well-documented case is the [[1490 Ch'ing-yang event]] which has an unknown energy yield but was apparently powerful enough to cause 10,000 deaths.&lt;ref name=Yau1&gt;{{Cite journal |bibcode = 1994Metic..29..864Y|title = Meteorite Falls in China and Some Related Human Casualty Events|journal = Meteoritics|volume = 29|issue = 6|pages = 864|last1 = Yau|first1 = Kevin|last2 = Weissman|first2 = Paul|last3 = Yeomans|first3 = Donald|year = 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern researchers are skeptical about the figure, but had the Tunguska event occurred over a highly populous district, it could have caused similar destruction.&lt;ref name=Yau1/&gt;

Depending on the estimate, there were only 3-4 known airbursts in the 20th century with energy yield greater than 80 kilotons (in 1908, 1930, 1932, and 1963), roughly consistent with the estimate of the EIEP table. Most values for the [[1930 Curuçá River event]] put it below 1 megaton.&lt;ref name=McFarland&gt;McFarland, John.

The first airburst of the 21st century with yield greater than 100 kilotons came from the 2013 [[Chelyabinsk meteor]], which had an estimated diameter of 20 meters.

The [[Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization]] and modern technology has improved ''multiple'' detection of airbursts with energy yield 1-2 kilotons every year within the last decade.&lt;ref name="jpl"/&gt; The table below contains a chronological list of events with yield at least 3 kilotons since 2005, with earlier or smaller events included if widely covered in the media.

{{Maya civilization}}
A unique and intricate style, the tradition of '''Mayan architecture''' spans several thousands of years. Often, the buildings most dramatic and easily recognizable as Mayans are the stepped  pyramids of the
[[Terminal Pre-classic]] period and beyond. Being based on the general [[Mesoamerican architecture|Mesoamerican architectural]] traditions, these pyramids relied on intricate carved stone in order to create a stairstep design. Each pyramid was dedicated to a deity whose shrine sat at its top. During this "height" of Maya culture, the centers of their religious, commercial and bureaucratic power grew into large cities, namely [[Tikal]] and [[Uxmal]]. Through observation of the numerous consistent elements and stylistic distinctions, remnants of Maya architecture have become an important key to understanding the evolution of their ancient temples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elan.com.mx/biblioteca/Function%20and%20Meaning%20in%20Classic%20Maya%20Architecture.pdf#page=56]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Urban design==
{{see also|Maya city}}

As Maya cities spread throughout the varied geography of [[Mesoamerica]], the extent of site planning appears to have been minimal; their cities having been built somewhat haphazardly as dictated by the topography of each independent location. Maya architecture tends to integrate a great degree of natural features. For instance, some cities existing on the flat [[limestone]] plains of the northern Yucatán grew into great sprawling municipalities, while others built in the hills of [[Usumacinta]] utilized the natural loft of the topography to raise their towers and temples to impressive heights. However, some semblance of order, as required by any large city, still prevailed.
At the onset of large-scale construction, a predetermined axis was typically established in congruence with the cardinal directions. Depending upon the location and availability of natural resources such as fresh-water wells, or ''[[cenotes]]'', the city grew by connecting great plazas with the numerous platforms that created the sub-structure for nearly all Maya buildings, by means of ''[[sacbeob]]'' causeways. As more structures were added and existing structures re-built or remodeled, the great Maya cities seemed to take on an almost random identity that contrasts sharply with other great Mesoamerican cities such as [[Teotihuacan]] and its rigid grid-like construction.

[[File:Temples of the Cross Group.jpg|thumb|left|Palenque, [[Temple of the Cross Complex]]]]
At the heart of the Maya city existed the large plazas surrounded by their most valued governmental and religious buildings such as the royal [[acropolis]], great pyramid temples, and occasionally [[Mesoamerican ballgame|ballcourts]]. Though city layouts evolved as nature dictated, careful attention was placed on the directional orientation of temples and observatories so that they were constructed in accordance with Maya interpretation of the orbits of the stars. Immediately outside this ritual center were the structures of lesser nobles, smaller temples, and individual shrines: the less sacred and less important structures had a greater degree of privacy. Outside the constantly evolving urban core were the less permanent and more modest homes of the common people.

[[Mesoamerican chronology|Classic Era]] Maya urban design could easily be described as the division of space by great monuments and causeways. In this case, the open public plazas were the gathering places for the people and the focus of the urban design, while interior space was entirely secondary. Only in the Late Post-Classic era did the great Maya cities develop into more fortress-like defensive structures that lacked, for the most part, the large and numerous plazas of the Classic.

==Building process==
All evidence seems to suggest that most stone buildings existed on top of a platform sub-structure that varied in height from less than a meter, in the case of terraces and smaller structures, to 45 meters in the case of great temples and pyramids. A flight of often steep stone steps split the large stepped platforms on at least one side, contributing to the common bi-symmetrical appearance of Maya architecture. Depending on the prevalent stylistic tendencies of an area, these platforms most often were built of a stucco and cut stone exterior filled with densely packed gravel. As is the case with many other Maya reliefs, those on the platforms often were related to the intended purpose of the residing structure. Thus, as the sub-structural platforms were completed, the grand residences and temples of the Maya were constructed on the solid foundations of the platforms. As all structures were built, little attention seems to have been given to their utilitarian functionality and much to external aesthetics; however, a certain repeated aspect, the [[corbeled arch]], was often utilized to mimic the appearance and feel of the simple Maya hut. Though not an effective tool to increase interior space, as it required thick stone walls to support the high ceiling, some temples utilized repeated arches, or a [[corbelled vault]], to construct what the Maya referred to as ''[[pibnal]]'', or [[sweatbath]], such as those in the [[Temple of the Cross]] at Palenque. As structures were completed, typically extensive relief work was added, often to the covering of stucco used to smooth any imperfections; however, many [[lintel]] carvings have been discovered, as well as actual stone carvings used as a facade. Commonly, these would continue uninterrupted around an entire structure and contain a variety of artwork pertaining to the inhabitants or purpose of a building. Though not the case in all Maya locations, broad use of painted stucco has been discovered as well.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

It has been suggested that, in conjunction to the [[Maya calendar|Maya Long Count Calendar]], every fifty-two years, or cycle, temples and pyramids were remodeled and rebuilt. It appears now that the rebuilding process was often instigated by a new ruler or for political matters, as opposed to matching the calendar cycle. However, the process of rebuilding on top of old structures is indeed a common one. Most notably, the [[North Acropolis, Tikal|North Acropolis]] at Tikal seems to be the sum total of 1,500 years of architectural modifications.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

'''Building Materials                                                                                                                                                                                '''

The Mayan civilization used very simple tools for building their structures.  The most common tools use were made of stone found in surrounding areas.  Limestone was a huge part of the Mayan tool making, as limestone was geographically very abundant in most settlements.  Locations of the Mayan cities were chosen with the access to necessary stones in mind.  This allowed most quarries to be right outside the city for easy access to blocks needed for construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.courses.psu.edu/anth/anth008_cmg149/mbm.html|title=Mayan construction:  building materials|last=Moore|first=Christina|website=www.courses.psu.edu|access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Top Limestone quarries used were Palenque and Tikal.  Though Limestone was the most important material they still collected sandstone from Quiriguá and volcanic tuff from Copan. 

The Mayan people had taken advantage of mortar on most structural projects.  The Mayans used a very difficult process of limestone under large amounts of heat to create their mortar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ancient.eu/Maya_Architecture/|title=Maya Architecture|work=Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The mortar was so widely used, the Mayans even used it for sculptures, facades, and floor layers.  Their mortar was very effective on a large building lifetime, but humid climates can have a negative effect on the mortar. 

For more important construction projects the Mayans would cover the entire structures exterior with stucco, followed by bright paintings, prioritizing red, yellow, green, and blue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mayansandtikal.com/mayan-architecture/mayan-buildings-daily-life-or-architecture/#Mayan_Building_Materials|title=Mayan Buildings|website=mayansandtikal.com|access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable constructions==

===Ceremonial platforms===
These were commonly limestone platforms of typically less than four meters in height where public ceremonies and religious rites were performed. Constructed in the fashion of a typical foundation platform, these were often accented by carved figures, altars and perhaps ''[[tzompantli]]'', a stake used to display the heads of victims or defeated [[Mesoamerican ballgame]] opponents.

===Palaces===
Large and often highly decorated, the palaces usually sat close to the center of a city and housed the population's elite. Every exceedingly large royal palace, or one consisting of many chambers on different levels might be referred to as an acropolis. However, often these were one-story and consisted of small chambers and typically at least one interior courtyard; these structures appear to take into account the needed functionality required of a residence, as well as the decoration required for their inhabitants stature. Archaeologists seem to agree that many palaces are home to various tombs. At [[Copán]], beneath over four-hundred years of later remodeling, a tomb for one of the ancient rulers has been discovered and the North Acropolis at [[Tikal]] appears to have been the site of numerous burials during the Terminal Pre-classic and Early Classic periods.[[File:Sayil Palacio Plan EN.png|thumb|left|Sayil, Yucatán. Three-story palace.]][[File:Palenque - El Palacio - Rekonstruktion.jpg|thumb|right|Palenque, Palace]]

===E-groups===
"[[E-Group]]" is a classification given by [[Mayanist]]s to certain structure complexes present at a number of Maya sites located in the central and southern Maya lowlands (e.g., the [[Petén Basin|Petén region]]). Complexes of this type consist of a stepped pyramid main structure, situated on the western side of a quadrilateral plaza or platform. A raised but rather elongated structure appears along the eastern side of the plaza, running north-south; a variation has three smaller temple mounds on top of or replacing this platform, the middle of these substructures placed directly opposite the main structure. Often, two other subsidiary structures appear on the north and south sides of the plaza, respectively. The main western structure is typically terraced (i.e. has several levels), with inset stairways on each of its four sides, with only the eastern stairway, leading from the plaza, providing access to the summit. The stairways have large balustrades which protrude from the pyramid, which were decorated with large [[stucco]] masks and panels of architectural art. In other examples, believed to be of a later date, this quadripartite stairway configuration is lacking.

E-group complexes are named after their prototypical example, Structure E-VII-sub at the site of [[Uaxactun]]. They were first identified as a meaningful complex by archaeologist [[Frans Blom]] in 1924, who excavated the site under the auspices of the [[Carnegie Institution of Washington|Carnegie Institution of Washington]].

It has been theorized that these E-groups are observatories, because the eponymous group at Uaxactun contains alignments corresponding approximately to sunrises on the [[solstice]]s and [[equinox]]es. However, all other E-groups have different orientations, which pertain to widespread groups of astronomical alignments that are also embedded in a number of buildings of other types; hence the term "observatory" applied to these assemblages is hardly warranted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Šprajc |first1=Ivan |last2=Sánchez Nava |first2=Pedro Francisco |title=Astronomy and architecture in the Maya lowlands |journal=Journal of Skyscape Archaeology |date=2016 |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=189-215 |doi=10.1558/jsa.30050}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other ideas seem to stem from the possible creation story told by the relief and artwork that adorns these structures.

===Triadic Groups===
They consist of an elevated platform (either an extensive acropolis or a steep pyramid) with a monumental stairway, with a central building facing the stairs, and two lateral structures facing each other on both sides of the platform. This formal complex has been attributed to the earthly re-creation of the Celestial Hearth (modern-day constellation of Orion), or a stage for enthronement rituals.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Most recently Triadic Groups have been interpreted as sanctuaries commemorating Maize God's resurrection upon the Flowery Mountain.&lt;ref&gt;Szymanski 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Such complexes appear during the Late Preclassic times and gradually decrease in number until their disappearance in the Early Postclassic.

===Pyramids and temples===
Often the most important temples sat atop towering Maya pyramids, some of over two-hundred feet, such as that at [[El Mirador]]. The sanctuary on top commonly was heightened by a crest or roof comb. While recent discoveries point toward the extensive use of pyramids as tombs, the temples themselves seem to rarely, if ever, contain burials. [[Image:Tikal6.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tikal]], temple pyramid with prominent roof comb]]

At Chichén Itzá there is a pyramid called [[El Castillo, Chichen Itza|El Castillo]] ('the castle'). With four stairways, each with 91 steps (with the upper platform they sum up to 365), and having other architectural elements appearing in astronomically significant numbers, it is a good example of Maya myth and astronomical cycles joined in architecture. Also referred to as the Pyramid of Kukulcán, the structure provides a remarkable display, observed by thousands of modern visitors at the equinoxes. The setting sun's rays are projected on the northern balustrade, create the illusion of a snake winding its way down the steps of the pyramid. The snake is composed of several triangle shapes giving it the appearance of a diamond back snake. At the base of the northern stairway there are massive snake head sculptures, making this effect even more persuasive. While it is a widespread belief that this light-and-shadow effect was achieved on purpose to record the equinoxes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.exploratorium.edu/ancientobs/chichen/HTML/castillo.html|title=Ancient Observatories: Chichén Itzá|author=|date=|website=www.exploratorium.edu|accessdate=7 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/travel/world-heritage/chichen-itza|title=Chichen Itza -- World Heritage Site -- National Geographic|author=|date=15 November 2010|website=nationalgeographic.com|accessdate=7 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the idea is highly unlikely: it has been shown that the phenomenon can be observed, without major changes, during several weeks around the equinoxes, making impossible to determine any date by observing this effect alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Šprajc |first1=Ivan |last2=Sánchez Nava |first2=Pedro Francisco |title=El Sol en Chichén Itzá y Dzibilchaltún: la supuesta importancia de los equinoccios en Mesoamérica |journal=Arqueología Mexicana |date=2018 |volume=XXV |issue=149 |pages=26-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maya architecture is vastly different from the others in Meso-American cultures. The blend of mythology and astronomical events can be found in nearly all Maya palace or pyramid structures. One will also notice the heavy influence of the Toltecs in the architecture at Chichén Itzá. The Toltecs invaded the Maya and merged their cultural traditions around the year 1000.&lt;ref name="ancient.eu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancient.eu/Chichen_Itza/|title=Chichen Itza|author=|date=|website=ancient.eu|accessdate=7 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180114073941/https://www.ancient.eu/Chichen_Itza/|archivedate=14 January 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Observatories===
The Maya were keen astronomers and had mapped out the phases of celestial objects, especially the [[Sun]], [[Venus]] and the [[Moon]]. Many temples have doorways and other features aligning to celestial events. Round temples, often dedicated to [[Kukulcan]], are perhaps those most often described as "observatories" by modern ruin tour-guides. It is now known, however, that many buildings of different types and uses were oriented on astronomical grounds, mostly to sunrises and sunsets on specific dates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Aveni |first1=A. |last2=Hartung |first2=H. |title=Maya City Planning and the Calendar |date=1986 |publisher=American Philosophical Society |location=Philadelphia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Aveni |first1=Anthony F. |title=Skywatchers: A Revised and Updated Version of Skywatchers of Ancient Mexico |date=2001 |publisher=University of Texas Press |location=Austin}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dates recorded are concentrated in four agriculturally significant seasons and tend to be separated by multiples of elementary periods of the calendrical system (13 and 20 days), suggesting that the orientations allowed the use of observational calendars intended to facilitate a proper scheduling of agricultural and associated ceremonial activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sánchez Nava |first1=Pedro Francisco |last2=Šprajc |first2=Ivan |title=Orientaciones astronómicas en la arquitectura maya de las tierras bajas |date=2015 |publisher=Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia |location=Mexico City |isbn=978-607-484-727-7 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/297155454_Orientaciones_astronomicas_en_la_arquitectura_maya_de_las_tierras_bajas}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although most of the important Maya buildings were oriented on the basis of astronomical criteria, their primary functions were religious, residential or administrative; the label "observatory" applied to any structural type is thus hardly warranted.

===Ballcourts===
As an integral aspect of the Mesoamerican lifestyle, the courts for their ritual ballgame were constructed throughout the Maya realm, often on a grand scale. The playing alleys of ballcourts were defined by two long walls.  Courts built earlier in Maya history (as at [[Cobá]]) had sloped sides, while ones built later (as at [[Chichén Itzá]]) had vertical sides. Frequently, the ends were enclosed so as to create an [[Image:I, heavily serifed.png|10px]]-shaped court when viewed from above.[[Image:Chichen itza ballcourt.jpg|thumb|right|Great Ballcourt at Chichen Itza]]

When the Maya played games in the Ballcourts, the ball was made of solid rubber and was sometimes as much as a foot in diameter. It was passed between teams ranged on opposite ends of the court. The players could hit it only with their knees or hips, much like football or soccer today. Points could be scored when the opponents failed to return the ball correctly. In central Mexico, and in late times in Yucatán, rings of stone were set high up in the side walls of the court. It was considered a particular triumph for a player to knock the ball through the ring.&lt;ref&gt;Proskouriakoff, Tatiana. (2002). An Album of Maya Architecture. Mineola, New York: Dover Publications, Inc. p.38.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cave sites==
There are also [[cave]] sites that are important to the Maya. [[Maya cave sites]] include [[Jolja Cave]], the cave site at [[Naj Tunich]], the [[Candelaria Caves]], and the [[Cave of the Witch]]. There are also cave [[creation myth]]s among the Maya. Some cave sites are still used by the modern Maya in the [[Chiapas highlands]] in Mexico.

Caspi worked as an artist-in-residence at the Kohl Jewish Teacher Center in Wilmette, Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Piper|first1=Barbara|title=Teachers' Centers Exchange Directory|date=1982|publisher=National Institute of Education, Far West Lab for Educational Research and Development|location=San Francisco, California|pages=127–128, pdf edition|url=http://eric.ed.gov/?q=%22barbara+piper%22&amp;id=ED218233}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating from Columbia College in 1982,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Columbia College Chicago, "Columbia College Alumni News" (1985). Alumni Newsletters. Book 25.|url=http://digitalcommons.colum.edu/alumnae_news/25|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; she returned to Israel, living on Kibbutz Harel and then in Jerusalem. She spent seven years as a freelance artist and calligrapher in Israel before returning to the United States in 1989 and establishing Caspi Cards &amp; Art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Credibility.com|url=https://credibility.com/greeting-card-publishers/us-ma-newton/caspi-cards-and-art}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her hundreds of original designs have been reproduced on greeting cards, Judaic art prints, calendars and is known for her innovations as a Ketubah artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Freiser|first1=Debbie|title=Made by Americans. Judaica Artist Mickie Caspi|url=http://patch.com/new-york/bayside/made-by-americans-judaica-artist-mickie-caspi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mickie Caspi Artist Profile|url=http://www.caspicards.com/about-us/}}&lt;/ref&gt; She introduced the first pre-printed Same Sex [[Ketubah]] text in 1994 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Caspi Cards Blog Same Sex Ketubah Text|url=https://www.caspicards.com/2015/09/same-sex-ketubah-text/}}&lt;/ref&gt;, predating [[Same-sex marriage in the United States | Same-sex marriage]] laws in the United States.

Caspi derives her inspiration from many sources, including traditional Jewish motifs, Persian and Arabic illumination, contemporary graphics, as well as art nouveau and art deco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mickie Caspi|url=http://www.ketubahaa.org/mickie-caspi/|website=The Ketubah Artists Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her art has been exhibited in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, Chicago, San Francisco and Boston, and her illustrations have appeared in Hebrew children’s books&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ketubah.com|url=http://www.ketubah.com/gallery/song-of-love-ketubah-by-mickie-caspi|location=Artist: Mickie Caspi Pop-Up Window}}&lt;/ref&gt; and English publications. According to [[Marc Michael Epstein]] (scholar of religion, focusing on Jewish religious culture), "Examples by American artist... Mickie Caspi are among the best and brightest examples of motifs often found in ketubot from the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Epstein|editor1-first=Marc Michael|title=Skies of Parchment, Seas of Ink: Jewish Illuminated Manuscripts|date=2015|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0300135534|pages=241–243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caspi volunteered at the Horace Mann School in Newton, Massachusetts. In 2011, the Oakland Hebrew Day School used her artwork as a stepping off point for the students to create their own works of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rosenkrantz|first1=H.

An avid organic gardener, Caspi incorporates the beauty of nature into much of her artwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mickie Caspi Judaica Artist Bio|url=http://www.judaism.com/bio.asp?author=Mickie%20Caspi|website=www.judaism.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally known as Micha Klugman, since her return to the United States she has used either Mickie Caspi or simply Mickie. She currently resides in Newton, Massachusetts, is married, and has three children and two grandsons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mickie Caspi Artist Profile|url=http://www.caspicards.com/about-us/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jewish Wedding Blog Featured Artist, Mickie Caspi|url=http://blog.ketubah.com/featured-artist-mickie-caspi/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Churches Trust''', formerly the '''Historic Churches Preservation Trust''', is a British [[Charitable organization#United Kingdom|registered charity]] whose aim is "promoting and supporting church buildings of historic, architectural and community value across the UK".&lt;ref name=whoweare&gt;{{Citation | url =http://nationalchurchestrust.org/about-us/who-we-are.php | title = About us| accessdate = 28 June 2011| publisher = National Churches Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It carries out this aim by providing financial grants to repair and modernise church buildings, supporting projects to enable churches to remain open, collaborating with local Churches Trusts and volunteer bodies, providing practical advice, support and information, and working to promote public awareness of the needs of churches.  Its forerunner was the Historic Churches Preservation Trust, whose  functions it has taken over, together with those of the Incorporated Church Building Society.&lt;ref name=whoweare/&gt;

==History==

By the middle of the 20th&amp;nbsp;century, the fabric of many British church buildings was in a poor state of repair.  This had followed socioeconomic changes in the late 19th and early 20th&amp;nbsp;centuries, including population changes, followed by neglect during the Second World War.&lt;ref name=hcpt/&gt;  Matters came to a head in 1950 with public statements, including an [[editorial]] in ''[[The Times]]''.  About this time the [[Pilgrim Trust]] declared that it was ceasing to give grants for repairs to individual churches.&lt;ref name=ch108&gt;{{Harvnb|Chandler|2006|pp=108–111.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Church of England Assembly (now the [[General Synod of the Church of England]]) established the Repair of Churches Commission to decide what should be done about the problem.  This resulted in the creation of the Historic Churches Preservation Trust, which was registered as a charity in 1953.&lt;ref name=hcpt/&gt;&lt;ref name=ch108/&gt;  Its first Secretary and Executive Committee Chairman was [[Ivor Bulmer-Thomas]], a [[Conservatism|Conservative]] politician, the role of Secretary being taken over later in 1953 by Hugh Llewellyn Jones.  In order to ensure that the grants it gave were appropriate, local advisory panels of architects were established, later replaced by the Committee of Honorary Consultant Architects, who continued to advise the Trust until 2002.  At the time of its foundation, it was estimated that a total of £4 million was necessary to fulfil its aims.  Money was raised in a variety of ways, including appeals on radio and television, exhibitions, concerts, individual and corporate donations, and a benefit dinner.  Support was received from charitable trusts, including the Pilgrim Trust, the Dulverton Trust, the [[Manifold Trust]], and the [[Esmée Fairbairn Foundation]].&lt;ref name=hcpt&gt;{{Citation | url = | title = Keeping Churches Alive — a brief history of the Trust| accessdate = | publisher = Historic Churches Preservation Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the time of its creation, the Trust gave grants for the repair of both active and [[redundant church|redundant]] churches, although the care of redundant churches was strictly beyond its remit.  In 1960 the Bridges Commission recommended that "a new fund be set up under a new Pastoral Measure to preserve churches of acknowledged historic or architectural worth".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chandler|2006|p=227.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Pastoral Measure of 1968 led to the creation of the Redundant Churches Fund (later the [[Churches Conservation Trust]]), which provided money from both the Church of England and the State for the preservation of redundant churches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chandler|2006|pp=227–229.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It took until 1984 to raise the first £4&amp;nbsp;million.  After that the size of donations tended to be larger. and by the end of 2005 a total of over £27&amp;nbsp;million had been raised.  In 2000 alone over £2.2&amp;nbsp;million was received.  The size of grants made to churches has varied greatly.  Up to 2005 the smallest grant had been £33&amp;nbsp;4[[Shilling|s]]&amp;nbsp;4[[Penny|d]] to a church in [[Mileham]], [[Norfolk]], in 1957, and the largest grants were of £100,000 each to a church in [[Portsea, Portsmouth]], [[Hampshire]], in 2000, and to [[Selby Abbey]] in 2005.&lt;ref name=hcpt/&gt;  The criterion for the award of a grant was "for essential repairs to any place of worship (with the exception of cathedrals) over 100 years old which is of a recognized Christian denomination and is open for public worship".&lt;ref name=hcpt/&gt; Initially available only to churches in England, the scheme was extended to churches and chapels in Wales in 1987.  The decision to award a grant is made by the Trust's Grants committee.  Some of the churches that have been helped are now closed and have been declared [[redundant church|redundant]].  These are now cared for by the [[Churches Conservation Trust]].  In 1983 the Historic Churches Preservation Trust took over the management of the Incorporated Church Building Society.  This had been founded in 1818 to assist [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] churches of any age, sometimes giving grants for new churches.    In the early 1990s a Friends' scheme was instituted.  In 2006 the Trust took over the functions of the Open Churches Trust.&lt;ref name=hcpt/&gt;  The Historic Churches Preservation Trust was succeeded by the National Churches Trust in 2007.&lt;ref name=whoweare/&gt;

==Present day==

The National Churches Trust is a registered charity.  The full definition of its objectives and activities are "to promote the conservation, repair, maintenance, improvement, and reconstruction of churches (to mean any recognised Christian places of worship, chapel or meeting house in the UK), and of such monuments, fittings, stained glass, furniture, organs, bells, in such churches and to promote the building, development of churches in the United Kingdom".&lt;ref name=charity&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityWithPartB.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=1119845&amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0| title = The National Churches Trust| accessdate = 30 June 2011| publisher = [[Charity Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the year ending 31 December 2009 its income was £1,895,258, of which 87.4% came from voluntary sources, and it spent £2,712,564, of which 89.4% was used for its charitable activities.  It employed eight people.&lt;ref name=charity/&gt;  The Trust is managed by a board of Trustees, and decisions to award grants are decided by the Grants Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url =http://nationalchurchestrust.org/about-us/our-people.php | title = Our People and Partners| accessdate = 30 June 2011| publisher = National Churches Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Grants of £10,000 and above are made for urgent structural repairs, and grants of between £5,000 and £25,000 are made towards the installation of facilities for such functions as toilets and catering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| url = http://nationalchurchestrust.org/supporting-you/grants/overview.php| title = Our Grants Programme| accessdate = 30 June 2011| publisher = National Churches Trust| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120215013949/http://nationalchurchestrust.org/supporting-you/grants/overview.php| archivedate = 15 February 2012| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 2005, the Trust has distributed over £9&amp;nbsp;million to over 1,000 churches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| url = http://nationalchurchestrust.org/about-us/statistics-and-key-facts.php| title = Key Facts| accessdate = 30 June 2011| publisher = National Churches Trust| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110926024838/http://nationalchurchestrust.org/about-us/statistics-and-key-facts.php| archivedate = 26 September 2011| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It supports church buildings of any denomination that are members of [[Churches Together in Britain and Ireland]], and covers the whole of the United Kingdom.  It does not own churches, and does not support [[redundant church]]es.  It receives no funding from the Government or from church authorities.  Its income is derived from individual donations, and from parishes, Trusts and Foundations, and from investment income.  As of 2011 the Trust is not contributing towards the building of new places of worship.  The Trust works in conjunction with a network of Local Churches Trusts that cover most of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url =http://nationalchurchestrust.org/about-us/faqs/faq.php#49 | title = Frequently Asked Questions| accessdate = 30 June 2011| publisher = National Churches Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Members of the public can become a Friend of the National Churches Trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| url = http://nationalchurchestrust.org/how-you-can-help/donate.php| title = How you can help| accessdate = 30 June 2011| publisher = National Churches Trust| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110830084843/http://nationalchurchestrust.org/how-you-can-help/donate.php| archivedate = 30 August 2011| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 BBC journalist [[Huw Edwards (journalist)|Huw Edwards]] was appointed as Vice-President of the trust.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalchurchestrust.org/news/huw-edwards-appointed-vice-president]&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017 the trust launched an online competition, ''Sacred Wales - Cymru Sanctaidd'', to find the favourite church or chapel in Wales from a list of 50 buildings suggested by religious and heritage organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Search is on for Wales’ favourite church/chapel|url=http://www.churchinwales.org.uk/news/2017/07/search-is-on-for-wales-favourite-churchchapel/|website=The Church in Wales|accessdate=13 August 2017|date=27 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The competition was devised to "celebrate and raise awareness of Wales’ religious heritage".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sacred Wales: Vote for Your Favourite Church or Chapel|url=https://rcahmw.gov.uk/sacred-wales-vote-for-your-favourite-church-or-chapel/|publisher=Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales|accessdate=13 August 2017|date=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Up From Conservatism,'' [[Michael Lind]] defines "national liberalism" in a way that ''[[The Progressive]]'' describes as matching [[historian]] [[Arthur M.

[[Gordon Smith (academic)|Gordon Smith]], a leading scholar of comparative European politics, understands national liberalism as a political concept that lost popularity when the success of nationalist movements in creating nation states rendered it no longer necessary to specify that a liberal ideal, party or politician was "national".&lt;ref name=SmithLiberalism&gt;"Between Left and Right: The Ambivalence of European Liberalism," pp. 16–28, in ''Liberal Parties in Western Europe,'' Emil J. Kirchner, ed., Cambridge University Press, 1988, {{ISBN|0521323940}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The roots of national liberalism are to be found in the 19th century, when [[conservative liberalism]] and/or [[classical liberalism]] was the ideology of the political classes in most [[Europe]]an countries and in particular those of [[Central Europe]], then governed by hereditary [[monarchy|monarchies]].

At their origin, national liberals, although pro-business, were not necessarily advocates of [[free trade]] and [[economic liberalism]] per se and sometimes favoured cooperation between the government and the national industry, moderate levels of protectionism, the establishment of preferential custom unions, subsidies for infant industry or companies considered of national strategic importance and various forms of industrial planning.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

National liberalism was popular in a number of countries including [[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Denmark]], [[Sweden]], [[Finland]] and [[Romania]] during the 19th century.&lt;ref name=Kuunmaki&gt;Kurunmaki, Jussi. “On the Difficulty of Being a National Liberal in Nineteenth-Century Finland.” Contributions to the History of Concepts, vol. 8, no. 2, 2013, pp. 83–95., https://www.jstor.org/stable/43610946.&lt;/ref&gt;{{verification needed|date=May 2017}} In Germany, Austria and Romania, national liberals and/or "National Liberal" parties were long in government.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} More specifically, in [[German language|German-speaking]] countries national liberals were also in favour of a more authoritarian or conservative political regime because of the multi-ethnic character or heterogeneous nature of countries like the [[Austrian Empire]] (later officially renamed [[Austria-Hungary]]) or the newly created Germany under [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Otto von Bismarck]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

===Germany===
In 19th-century Germany, believers in national liberalism differed from [[civic nationalism|liberal nationalists]] in that they believed in a more authoritarian presence in Europe and a strong [[German Empire]]. Liberal nationalists, such as [[Max Weber]], were looking towards a democratic Germany in cooperation with the other European powers.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

At the time of the German Empire, national liberalism was represented by the [[National Liberal Party (Germany)|National Liberal Party]] (NLP), the largest in the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]] for several years. National Liberals supported Bismarck, who served as Chancellor from 1871 ([[unification of Germany]]) to 1890, until the late 1870s when the Chancellor reversed his early [[free trade]] policies, became a proponent of [[protectionism]], opposed increasing parliamentary powers and ultimately pandered for the support of the [[German Conservative Party]] (largely representing the wealthy landowning elite [[Junker (Prussia)|Junkers]] of [[Prussia]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Farmer|first1=Alan|title=My Revision Notes: Edexcel A-level History: Germany, 1871-1990: united, divided and reunited|date=2017|publisher=Hodder Education|isbn=9781471876653|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=UUo_DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT22&amp;lpg=PT22&amp;dq=%22national+liberals%22+protectionism+bismarck&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QtOHZbTyiO&amp;sig=n16Uv7oUubm8kiqRPz-_x6nD5fE&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjzrb6W7PTUAhVOLFAKHaeUCZsQ6AEIXDAH#v=onepage&amp;q=%22national%20liberals%22%20protectionism%20bismarck&amp;f=false|accessdate=20 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Flynn|first1=John F.|title=At the Threshold of Dissolution: The National Liberals and Bismarck 1877/1878|jstor=2639216|journal=The Historical Journal|date=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/germany/31.htm |title=Germany - The Tariff Agreement of 1879 |website=Countrystudies.us |accessdate=2017-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/germany/31.htm |title=Germany - The Tariff Agreement of 1879 |publisher=Countrystudies.us |date= |accessdate=2017-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the NLP (which had obtained around 30% in the first three federal elections, including 30.1% in the [[German federal election, 1871|1871 federal election]]) suffered huge losses in the [[German federal election, 1878|1878 federal election]] and especially the [[German federal election, 1881|1881 federal election]] (when it was reduced to 14.6%). Later, the party experienced a steady decline in its share of vote, contextually with the rise of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] and the [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]] at the turn of the century.

During the [[Weimar Republic]], the NLP was succeeded by the [[German People's Party]] (DVP), whose main leader was [[Gustav Stresemann]], Chancellor (1923) and Minister of Foreign Affairs (1923–1929). The DVP, which was joined by some moderate elements of the [[Free Conservative Party]] (FKP) and the [[Economic Union (political party)|Economic Union]] (WV),&lt;ref name=VM&gt;Vincent E McHale (1983) ''Political parties of Europe'', Greenwood Press, p421 {{ISBN|0-313-23804-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; was generally thought to represent the interests of the great German industrialists and has been classified as a national-liberal party by several observers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Jürgen |last=Dittberner |title=Sozialer Liberalismus: Ein Plädoyer |publisher=Logos |year=2008 |pages=55, 58}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Wolfgang (ed.) |last=Neugebauer |title=Handbuch der Preussischen Geschichte |volume=3 |publisher=de Gruyter |year=2000 |page=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Liesbeth |last=Van De Grift |title=Securing the Communist State: The Reconstruction of Coercive Institutions in the Soviet Zone of Germany and Romania, 1944-48 |publisher=Lexington Books |year=2012 |page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its platform stressed Christian family values, secular education, lower tariffs, opposition to welfare spending and agrarian subsidies and hostility to "[[Marxism]]" (that is to say, both the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist Party]] and the Social Democratic Party). After Stresemann's death, the DVP, whose ranks included several anti-republicans, veered sharply to the right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=Richard J.|authorlink=Richard J.

The current [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP), which was the joint successor of the DVP and the [[social liberalism|social liberal]] [[German Democratic Party]] (DDP), originally featured conservative and partly nationalist efforts, which were particularly strong in some state associations until the 1950s&lt;ref&gt;Gert-Joachim Glaeßner: Politik in Deutschland, VS Verlag für Sozialwissenschaften 2006, p. 457&lt;/ref&gt; and more occasionally after that (an interesting example is that of [[Jürgen Möllemann]], FDP leader in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] in 1983–1994 and 1996–2002)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.untag-smd.ac.id/files/Perpustakaan_Digital_2/POLITICS%20AND%20GOVERNMENT%20The%20Politics%20of%20the%20Nazi%20Past%20in%20Germany%20and%20Austria.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and still includes a national-liberal faction,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Liberal Parties in Western Europe |last=Kirchner |first=Emil Joseph |year=1988 |publisher=Cambridge |location=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-32394-9 |page=214 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9IrE08SV1wEC |accessdate= }}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; which holds a consistently [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]] position, differently from the rest of the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Taggart |first1=Paul |last2=Szczerbiak |first2=Aleks |title=The Party Politics of Euroscepticism in EU Member and Candidate States |series=SEI Working Paper |volume=51 |page=11 |publisher=Sussex European Institute |doi= |url=http://www.sussex.ac.uk/sei/documents/wp51.pdf |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091210232136/http://www.sussex.ac.uk/sei/documents/wp51.pdf |archivedate=10 December 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some right-wing elements, including Sven Tritschler (former leader of the Stresemann Club),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rechtsliberale.wordpress.com/personen |title=Wir &amp;#124; Stresemann Club - Rechtsliberale in der FDP |website=Rechtsliberale.wordpress.com |date=2012-04-20 |accessdate=2017-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; have more recently joined the [[Alternative for Germany]] (AfD),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.wdr.de/fernsehen/westpol/sendungen/afd-nrw-steckbriefe-100.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-05-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304235510/http://www1.wdr.de/fernsehen/westpol/sendungen/afd-nrw-steckbriefe-100.html |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; which has in turn been characterised by some observers as national liberal.&lt;ref name="Franzmann2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Simon Franzmann|editor1=Gabriele D'Ottavio|editor2=Thomas Saalfeld|title=Germany After the 2013 Elections: Breaking the Mould of Post-Unification Politics?|chapter=The Failed Struggle for Office Instead of Votes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_mLBCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA166|year=2015|publisher=Ashgate|isbn=978-1-4724-4439-4|pages=166–167}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.freitag.de/autoren/idefix/die-populistische-versuchung |title=AfD ǀ Die populistische Versuchung — der Freitag |language=de|publisher=Freitag.de |date=2009-11-20 |accessdate=2017-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/patzelt-sachsen-landtagswahl-100.html |title=Politologe analysiert Landtagswahl: "Den Sachsen geht es zu gut" |website=tagesschau.de |date=2014-09-01 |accessdate=2017-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Austria===
In [[Austria-Hungary]], the [[Constitutional Party (Austria)|Constitutional Party]] was the main representative of national liberalism.&lt;ref name="Mulej"/&gt; In [[Austria]], national liberalism has remained the basis of one of the three ''Lager'', or ideological camps, in the country, dating back to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The new politics of the Right: neo-Populist parties and movements in established democracies |editor1-first=Hans-Georg |editor1-last=Betz |editor2-first=Stefan |editor2-last=Immerfall |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H9cGkDJgW7wC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=no&amp;pg=PA27#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |year=1998 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=978-0-312-21338-1 |chapter=The Freedom Party of Austria: From Protest to Radical Right Populism |first=Max |last=Riedlsperger |page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[interwar period]], the national-liberal camp was gathered into the [[Greater German People's Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V6DURCH53f4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Modern+Austria#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |first=Barbara |last=Jelavich |title=Modern Austria: Empire and Republic, 1815-1986 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |year=1987 |page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1938, with the ''[[Anschluss]]'' of Austria into [[Nazi Germany]], the national-liberal camp had been swallowed whole by [[Austrian National Socialism]] and all other parties were eventually absorbed into Nazi totalitarianism.&lt;ref name="R28"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The new politics of the Right: neo-Populist parties and movements in established democracies |editor1-first=Hans-Georg |editor1-last=Betz |editor2-first=Stefan |editor2-last=Immerfall |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H9cGkDJgW7wC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=no&amp;pg=PA27#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |year=1998 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=978-0-312-21338-1 |chapter=The Freedom Party of Austria: From Protest to Radical Right Populism |first=Max |last=Riedlsperger |page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Socialists and Christian Socials were persecuted under the Nazi regime and the national-liberal camp was scarred after the war due to [[association fallacy|guilt by association]] with National Socialism.&lt;ref name="R28"/&gt;

Haider himself would split from the party and form the [[Alliance for the Future of Austria]] in 2005.

===Denmark===
In [[Denmark]], from the 1840s the core concept of national liberalism was that the nation and the state should have the same extent. National liberals supported the union the Kingdom of Denmark and the [[Duchy of Schleswig]] under a common constitutional framework. On the economy, the state should not interfere with trade and the national-liberal economic vision was transposed in the 1857 Law on Freedom of Business, which abolished the last remnants of the feudal monopolies which had previously formed the framework for the craft of the cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.danmarkshistorien.dk/leksikon-og-kilder/vis/materiale/nationalliberalisme |title=Nationalliberalisme |website=Danmarkshistorien.dk |publisher=Aarhus Universitet |accessdate=2017-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Danish national liberals supported [[Scandinavism]] and thus Scandinavian unity.&lt;ref name="Hilson"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mary Hilson|chapter=Denmark, Norway, and Sweden|editor1=Timothy Baycroft|editor2=Mark Hewitson|title=What Is a Nation?: Europe 1789-1914|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iLYUDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA203|year= 2006|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-929575-3|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sweden===
In [[Sweden]], in the 1860s liberals described themselves as national liberals (''nationalliberaler'') and constituted a coalition of monarchists and liberal reformists in support of parliamentary reforms.&lt;ref name=Kuunmaki/&gt;{{verification needed|date=May 2017}} Swedish national liberals also supported Scandinavism.&lt;ref name="Hilson"/&gt;

===Finland===
In the [[Grand Duchy of Finland]], an [[autonomous entity|autonomous]] part of the [[Russian Empire]], where as many as 80% of the population was Protestant and Finnish-speaking, somewhat under 20% Protestant Swedish speakers (Sweden ruled Finland until 1809) and a small number Russian Orthodox, the term "national liberal" was used by the elite Swedish-speakers of the [[Svecoman movement]] who advocated liberal ideals, but wanted to keep Swedish as the dominant language, an idea opposed by Finnish-speaking nationalists of the [[Fennoman movement]].&lt;ref name=Kuunmaki/&gt;{{verification needed|date=May 2017}} The Svecoman movement gave birth to the Swedish Party, which was later renamed [[Swedish People's Party in Finland]], which has since moved to mainstream liberalism and [[social liberalism]] and is often a party of government in the country.

===Russia===
In [[Russia]], "national liberalism" was a 1990s movement claiming to be redefining "liberal" principles as understood in the Western tradition to produce a "national liberalism" better suited to Russian culture,&lt;ref name="EvansEdinburghCompanion"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Evans|first1=Mark|title=The Edinburgh Companion to Contemporary Liberalism|date=2001|publisher=PsychologyPress|isbn=1579583393|page=273}}&lt;/ref&gt; being practically a variety of [[Russian nationalism]].

Presidential candidate in [[Russian presidential election, 2018|2018 presidential election]], [[Ksenia Sobchak]] of [[Civic Initiative]], considers herself a national liberal.

===Romania===
In [[Romania]], the [[National Liberal Party (Romania)|National Liberal Party]] (PNL), founded in 1875, revived in 1990 and enlarged in 2014 (when it absorbed the [[Democratic Liberal Party (Romania)|Democratic Liberal Party]], PDL), has also been part of the national-liberal tradition. Today, it is one of the country's two main parties. President [[Klaus Iohannis]] hails from it. The PNL is now mainly [[Liberal conservatism|liberal-conservative]] and [[Pro-Europeanism|pro-Europeanist]] placed on the [[Centre-right politics|centre-right]] of the [[political spectrum]] concerning economy, society, culture, freedom of expression and civil liberties.

===Slovakia===

Viola, Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt; main opposition party after the [[Slovak parliamentary election, 2016|2016 parliamentary election]] in [[Slovakia]], has been shifting from liberalism to [[Euroscepticism]] and [[nationalism]] and/or combining liberalism and nationalism. As a fact, SaS is not a member of the [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party]], but of the [[Alliance of Conservatives and Reformists in Europe]], along with conservative and Eurosceptic parties. SaS leader [[Richard Sulík]] described himself both as a liberal and as a nationalist,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Richard Sulík: Áno, som slovenský nacionalista|url=https://dennikn.sk/688253/richard-sulik-sas-som-slovensky-nacionalista-rozhovor/|journal=Dennik N|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but later corrected himself by saying that he was a liberal and a [[patriotism|patriot]] while condemning [[chauvinism]], [[racism]] and [[religious fanaticism]] and opposing the withdrawal of Slovakia from the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://dennikn.sk/690096/som-slovensky-liberal/|title=Som slovenský liberál|last=Sulík|first=Richard|work=Denník N|access-date=2017-10-16|language=sk-SK}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the party has never been classified as national-liberal by third-party sources.

===Czech Republic===
In [[Austria-Hungary]] the [[Young Czech Party]], emerged in 1874 after a split from the [[Old Czech Party]], was a national-liberal force. During [[Czechoslovakia]]'s era (1918–1992), a few parties were described as national-liberal: [[Czechoslovak National Democracy]], the [[National Labour Party (1925)|National Labour Party]] and, after 1989, the [[Czech National Social Party]].

Today, the conservative [[Civic Democratic Party (Czech Republic)|Civic Democratic Party]] (ODS) in the [[Czech Republic]] has been described as a national-liberal party.&lt;ref name="NaglePerspective"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nagle|first1=John|title=Democracy and Democratization: Post-Communist Europe in Comparative Perspective|date=1999|publisher=SAGE|isbn=0761956794|page=193|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RLRuXV9vjswC&amp;pg=PA193&amp;dq=%22national+liberalism%22++rights+democratic&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi2vIHM5PbTAhWG6yYKHYADCyMQ6AEIMzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=%22national%20liberalism%22%20%20rights%20democratic&amp;f=false|accessdate=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ODS is a member of the [[Alliance of Conservatives and Reformists in Europe]], as [[Slovakia]]'s [[Freedom and Solidarity]], and the [[International Democrat Union]].

'''Ngô Đình Diệm''' ({{IPAc-en|d|j|ɛ|m}};&lt;ref&gt;[[British Pathé]] – [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rj8-qxROFc "New York Hails Vietnam's President Diem (1957)"]&lt;!--at 0:07--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-vi|ŋō ɗìn jîəmˀ|lang|NgoDinhDiem.ogg}}; 3 January 1901&amp;nbsp;– 2 November 1963) was a [[South Vietnamese]] politician. A former [[mandarin (bureaucrat)|mandarin]] of the [[Nguyễn dynasty]], he was named Prime Minister of the [[State of Vietnam]] by Head of State [[Bảo Đại]] in 1954. In October 1955, after winning a heavily [[electoral fraud|rigged]] [[State of Vietnam referendum, 1955|referendum]], he deposed Bảo Đại and established the first Republic of Vietnam (RVN), with himself as president. He was a leader of the [[Catholicism in Vietnam|Catholic]] element and was opposed by [[Buddhism in Vietnam|Buddhists]]. In November 1963, after constant Buddhist protests and non-violent resistance, Diệm was assassinated during a [[CIA]]-backed [[1963 South Vietnamese coup|coup d'état]], along with his brother, [[Ngô Đình Nhu]], by [[Nguyễn Văn Nhung]], the aide of the leader of the Army of Republic of Vietnam (ARVN), General [[Dương Văn Minh]]. Diệm has been a controversial historical figure in historiography on the [[Vietnam War]]. Some historians portrayed him as a tool of the U.S. policymakers, some considered him an avatar of Vietnamese tradition. Nevertheless, some recent studies have portrayed Diệm from a more Vietnamese-centred perspective as a competent leader with his own vision on nation building and modernisation of [[South Vietnam]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite book|title= Misalliance: Ngo Dinh Diem, the United States, and the Fate of South Vietnam|last= Miller|first= Edward|publisher= Harvard University Press|year= 2013|isbn= |location= |pages= 13–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Lost Mandate of Heaven: the American Betrayal of Ngo Dinh Diem, President of Vietnam''.

==Family and early life==
Ngô Đình Diệm was born in 1901 in [[Quảng Bình]], a province in [[central Vietnam]]. His family originated in Phú Cam Village, a Catholic village adjacent to [[Huế]] City. His clan had been among Vietnam's earliest Catholic converts in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Fall, Bernard B. (1963). ''The Two Viet-Nams.'' Praeger Publishers, p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt; Diệm was given a saint's name at birth, Gioan Baotixita (a Vietnamized form of [[John the Baptist|Jean Baptiste]]), following the custom of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ngô-Đình family suffered under the anti-Catholic persecutions of Emperors [[Minh Mạng]] and [[Tự Đức]]. In 1880, while Diệm's father, [[Ngô Đình Khả]] (1850–1925), was studying in [[British Malaya]], an anti-Catholic riot led by Buddhist monks almost wiped out the Ngô-Đình clan. Over 100 of the Ngô clan were "burned alive in a church including Khả's parents, brothers, and sisters."&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Seth (2006) [Not true: https://vi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ngô_Đình_Khả {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170407102752/https://vi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ng%C3%B4_%C4%90%C3%ACnh_Kh%E1%BA%A3 |date=7 April 2017 }}, under Thân Thế (biography): sau khi bố mất vì bị bệnh (khi ấy ông khoảng 6 tuổi) được một linh mục người Pháp đưa về nuôi cho ông học Nho học: after his (Ngô Đình Khả's) father died of disease (when he/Khả was 6 years old), a French priest took care of him, nourished and had him learn Chinese characters...] ''Cold War Mandarin: Ngo Dinh Diem and the Origins of America's War in Vietnam, 1950–1963''. Lanham, Maryland: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Note that while he is usually referred to as Diệm in English, his family name is actually Ngô.

[[Ngô Đình Khả]] was educated in a Catholic school in British Malaya, where he learned English and studied the European-style curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a devout Catholic and scrapped plans to become a Roman Catholic priest in the late 1870s. He worked for the commander of the French armed forces as an interpreter and took part in campaigns against anti-colonial rebels in the mountains of Tonkin during 1880. He rose to become a high-ranking Mandarin, the first headmaster of the National Academy in Huế (founded in 1896) and a counselor to Emperor [[Thành Thái]] under the [[French Indochina|French colonial regime]].&lt;ref&gt;Fall, p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed minister of the rites and [[chamberlain (office)|chamberlain]] and keeper of the [[eunuch]]s. Despite his collaboration with the French colonizers, Khả was "motivated less by Francophilia than by certain reformist ambitions".&lt;ref&gt;Miller, pp. 23–24.&lt;!--page check needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Like [[Phan Chu Trinh|Phan Châu Trinh]], Khả believed that independence from France could be achieved only after changes in Vietnamese politics, society and culture had occurred. In 1907, after the ouster of emperor Thành Thái, Khả resigned his appointments, withdrew from the imperial court, and became a farmer in the countryside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Triumph Forsaken: The Vietnam War, 1954–1965|last= Moyar|first= Mark|publisher= Cambridge University Press|year= 2006|isbn= |location= New York|page= 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the tragedy of his family, Khả decided to abandon preparation for the priesthood and married. After his first wife died childless, Khả remarried and had nine children—six sons and three daughters—by his second wife, Phạm Thị Thân.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; These were Ngô Đình Khôi, Ngô Đình Thị Giao, Ngô Đình Thục, Ngô Đình Diệm, Ngô Đình Thị Hiệp, Ngô Đình Thị Hoàng, Ngô Đình Nhu, Ngô Đình Cẩn, Ngô Đình Luyện. As a devout Roman Catholic, Khả took his entire family to Mass each morning and encouraged his sons to study for the priesthood.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Jacob, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Having learned both Latin and classical Chinese, Khả strove to make sure his children were well educated in both Christian scriptures and Confucian classics.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; During his childhood, Diệm laboured in the family's rice fields while studying at a French Catholic primary school (Pellerin School) in Huế, and later entered a private school started by his father, where he studied French, Latin, and classical Chinese. At the age of fifteen he briefly followed his elder brother, [[Ngô Đình Thục]], who would become Vietnam's highest-ranking Catholic bishop, into a monastery. Diệm swore himself to celibacy to prove his devotion to his faith, but found monastic life too rigorous and decided not to pursue a clerical career.&lt;ref name="Miller, p.24"&gt;Miller, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Moyar, Diệm's personality was too independent to adhere to the discipline of the Church. Diem also inherited his father's antagonism toward the French colonialists who occupied his country.&lt;ref&gt;Moyar, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of his secondary schooling at Lycée Quốc học, the French lycée in Huế, Diem's outstanding examination results elicited the offer of a scholarship to study in Paris. He declined and, in 1918, enrolled at the prestigious School of Public Administration and Law in Hanoi, a French school that prepared young Vietnamese to serve in the colonial administration.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; It was there that he had the only romantic relationship of his life, when he fell in love with one of his teacher's daughters. After she chose to persist with her vocation, entering a convent, he remained celibate for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name="early k"&gt;Fall, p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt; Diệm's family background and education, especially Catholicism and Confucianism, had influences on his life and career, on his thinking on politics, society, and history. According to Miller, Diệm "displayed Christian piety in everything from his devotional practices to his habit of inserting references to the Bible into his speeches"; he also enjoyed showing off his knowledge of classical Chinese texts.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
After graduating at the top of his class in 1921, Diệm followed in the footsteps of his eldest brother, Ngô Đình Khôi, joining the civil service in Thừa Thiên as a junior official. Starting from the lowest rank of mandarin, Diệm steadily rose over the next decade. He first served at the royal library in Huế, and within one year was the district chief in both Thừa Thiên and nearby Quảng Trị province,&lt;ref name="early k"&gt;Fall, p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt; presiding over seventy villages. Diệm was promoted to be a provincial chief (Tuần phủ) in Ninh Thuận at the age of 28, overseeing 300 villages.&lt;ref&gt;Moyar, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:5 vị Thượng thư từ trái qua phải Hồ Đắc Khải, Phạm Quỳnh, Thái Văn Toản, Ngô Đình Diệm, Bùi Bằng Đoàn.jpg|thumb|The five high-ranking mandarins of the Nguyễn dynasty (from left to right): Hồ Đắc Khải, Phạm Quỳnh, Thái Văn Toản, Ngô Đình Diệm, Bùi Bằng Đoàn]]

During his career as a mandarin, Diệm was known for his workaholism and incorruptibility, and as a Catholic leader and nationalist. Catholic nationalism in Vietnam during the 1920s and 1930s facilitated Diệm's ascent in his bureaucratic career.&lt;ref name="early k"/&gt; Diệm's rise was also facilitated through Ngô Đình Khôi's marriage to the daughter of Nguyễn Hữu Bài (1863–1935), the Catholic head of the Council of Ministers at the Huế court and also supported the indigenization of the Vietnamese Church and more administrative powers to the monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nguyễn Hữu Bài]] was highly regarded among the French, and Diệm's religious and family ties impressed him and he became Diệm's patron.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; The French were impressed by his work ethic but were irritated by his frequent calls to grant more autonomy to Vietnam. Diệm replied that he contemplated resigning but encouragement from the populace convinced him to persist. In 1925, he first encountered communists distributing propaganda while riding horseback through the region near Quảng Trị. Revolted by calls for violent socialist revolution contained in the propaganda leaflets, Diệm involved himself in anti-communist activities for the first time, printing his own pamphlets.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Jacob, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929, he was promoted to the governorship of [[Bình Thuận Province]] and was known for his work ethic. In 1930 and 1931, he helped the French suppress the first peasant revolts organized by the communists.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; According to Fall, Diệm put the revolution down because he thought it could not sweep out the French, but might threaten the leadership of the mandarins.&lt;ref name="early k"/&gt; In 1933, with the ascension of [[Bảo Đại]] to the throne, Diệm accepted Bảo Đại's invitation to be his interior minister following lobbying by Nguyễn Hữu Bài. Soon after his appointment, Diệm headed a commission to advise on potential administration reforms. After calling for the French to introduce a Vietnamese legislature and many other political reforms, he resigned after three months in office when his proposals were rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= The end of the Vietnamese monarchy|last= Lockhart, Bruce McFarland|first= Bruce McFarland|publisher= Council on Southeast Asia Studies, Yale Center for International and Area Studies.|year= 1993|isbn= |location= |pages= 68–86}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diệm denounced Emperor Bảo Đại as "nothing but an instrument in the hands of the French," and renounced his decorations and titles from Bảo Đại. The French then threatened him with arrest and exile.&lt;ref name="early k"/&gt;

For the next decade, Diệm lived as a private citizen with his family in Huế, although he was kept under surveillance. He spent his time reading, meditating, attending church, gardening, hunting, and in amateur photography.&lt;ref name="Moyar, p.13"&gt;Moyar, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Diệm also conducted extensive nationalist activities during those 21 years, engaging in meetings and correspondence with various leading Vietnamese revolutionaries, such as his friend, [[Phan Bội Châu]], a Vietnamese anti-colonial activist, whom Diệm respected for his knowledge of Confucianism and argued that Confucianism's teachings could be applied to a modern Vietnam.&lt;ref name="Moyar, p.13"/&gt; With the start of the Second World War in the Pacific, seeing an opportunity for Vietnam to challenge French colonization, he attempted to persuade the Japanese forces to declare independence for Vietnam in 1942 but was ignored. Diệm also tried to establish relationships with Japanese diplomats, army officers, and intelligence operatives who supported Vietnam's independence.&lt;ref name="Miller, p.30"&gt;Miller, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, Diệm's Japanese friends helped him to contact Prince [[Cường Để]], an anti-colonial activist, who was in exile in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Trần, Mỹ Vân (2005). ''Vietnamese royal in Exile: Prince Cường Để (1882–1951)'', Routledge, pp. 32–67.&lt;/ref&gt; After contacting Cường Để, Diệm formed a secret political party, the Association for the Restoration of Great Vietnam (Việt Nam Đại Việt Phục Hưng Hội), which was dominated by his Catholic allies in Hue.&lt;ref&gt;Keith, Charles (2012). ''Catholic Vietnam: A Church from Empire to Nation''. University of California Press, p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt; When its existence was discovered in the summer of 1944, the French declared Diệm to be a subversive and ordered his arrest. He flew to Saigon under Japanese military protection, staying there until the end of WWII.&lt;ref name="Miller, p.30"/&gt;

In 1945, after the [[Japanese coup d'état in French Indochina|coup against French colonial rule]], the Japanese offered Diệm the post of prime minister in the [[Empire of Vietnam]] under Bảo Đại, which they organized on leaving the country. He declined initially, but reconsidered his decision and attempted to reverse the refusal. However, Bảo Đại had already given the post to [[Trần Trọng Kim]]. In September 1945, after the Japanese withdrawal, [[Ho Chi Minh|Hồ Chí Minh]] proclaimed the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and in the Northern half of Vietnam, his [[Viet Minh|Việt Minh]] began fighting the French. Diệm attempted to travel to Huế to dissuade Bảo Đại from joining Hồ, but was arrested by the Việt Minh along the way and exiled to a highland village near the border. He might have died of malaria, dysentery, and influenza had the local tribesmen not nursed him back to health. Six months later, he was taken to meet Hồ, who recognized Diệm's virtues and, wanting to extend the support for his new government,&lt;ref&gt;Jacob, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; asked Diệm to be minister of the interior. Diệm refused to join the Việt Minh, assailing Hồ for the murder of his brother Ngô Đình Khôi by Việt Minh cadres.&lt;ref name="early k"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mid j"&gt;Jacobs, pp. 20–25&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[First Indochina War|Indochina War]], Diệm and other non-communist nationalists had to face a dilemma: they did not want to restore colonial rule and did not want to support the Việt Minh. Diệm proclaimed his neutrality and attempted to establish a Third Force movement that was both anti-colonialist and anti-communist&lt;ref&gt;Miller, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, he became the founder and chief of the National Union Bloc (Khối Quốc Gia Liên Hiệp) and then folded it into the Vietnam National Rally (Việt Nam Quốc Gia Liên Hiệp), which united non-communist Vietnamese nationalists. He also established relationships with some leading Vietnamese anti-communists like [[Nguyễn Tôn Hoàn]] (1917–2001), a fellow Catholic and political activist. His other allies and advisors were dominated by Catholics, especially his family members and their friends.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, pp. 32–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Diệm also secretly maintained contact with high-ranking leaders of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, attempting to convince them to leave Hồ Chí Minh's government and join him. At the same time, he lobbied French colonial officials for a "true independence" for Vietnam, Diệm was disappointed when in June 1948, [[Bảo Đại]] signed an agreement to grant Vietnam status as an "associated state" within the French Union, which allowed France to maintain its diplomatic, economic, and military policies in Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; In the meantime, the French had created the State of Vietnam and Diệm refused Bảo Đại's offer to become the Prime Minister. On 16 June 1949, he then published a new manifesto in newspapers proclaiming a third force different from Vietminh and Bảo Đại, but it raised little interest and further, his statement provided evidence to both the French and Việt Minh that Diệm was a dangerous rival.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, the Việt Minh lost patience and sentenced him to death in absentia, and the French refused to protect him. Hồ Chí Minh's cadres tried to assassinate him while he was traveling to visit his elder brother Thục, bishop of the Vĩnh Long diocese in the Mekong Delta. Recognizing his political status, Diệm decided to leave Vietnam in 1950.&lt;ref name="early k"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mid j"&gt;Jacobs, pp. 20–25&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Miller, during his early career, there were at least three ideologies which influenced Diệm's social and political views in the 1920s and 1930s. The first of these was Catholic nationalism, which Diệm inherited from his family's tradition, especially from Cardinal [[Ngô Đình Thục]], his brother, and Nguyễn Hữu Bài, who advised him to "return the seal" in 1933 to oppose French policies. The second was Diệm's understanding of Confucianism, especially through his friendship with [[Phan Bội Châu]] who argued that Confucianism's teachings could be applied to a modern Vietnam. Lastly, instructed by [[Ngô Đình Nhu]], Diệm began to examine [[Personalist Labor Revolutionary Party|Personalism]], which originated from [[Roman Catholicism in France|French Catholicism]]'s philosophy and then applied this doctrine as the main ideology of his regime.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, pp. 20–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exile==
Diệm applied for permission to travel to Rome for the Holy Year celebrations at the [[Holy See|Vatican]]. After gaining French permission, he left in August 1950 with his older brother, Bishop Ngô Đình Thục. Before going to Europe, Diệm went to Japan, where he met with Prince [[Cường Để]], his former ally, and discussed Cường Để's efforts to return to Vietnam and his capacity to play some roles in his homeland.&lt;ref&gt;Trần Mỹ Vân, pp. 213–214.&lt;/ref&gt; Diệm's friend also managed to organize a meeting between him and [[Michigan State University Vietnam Advisory Group|Wesley Fishel]], an American political science professor at the [[University of California]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archives.msu.edu/findaid/ua17-95.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-11-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171214215911/http://archives.msu.edu/findaid/ua17-95.html |archivedate=14 December 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; who was working for the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] in Japan. Fishel was a proponent of the anti-colonial, anti-communist third force doctrine in Asia and was impressed with Diệm and helped him organize connections in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Fall, p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, Diệm flew to the United States to seek the support of government officials. Nevertheless, Diệm was not successful in winning US support for Vietnamese anti-communists.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, pp. 39–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Rome, Diệm obtained an audience with [[Pope Pius XII]] at the Vatican before undertaking further lobbying across Europe. He also met with French and Vietnamese officials in Paris and sent a message indicating that he was willing to be the Prime Minister of the State of Vietnam to Bảo Đại. But Bảo Đại then refused to meet him.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Diệm returned to the United States to continue building support among Americans. Nonetheless, to Americans, the fact that Diệm was an anti-communist was not enough to distinguish him from Bảo Đại and other State of Vietnam leaders. Some American officials worried that his devout Catholicism could hinder his ability to mobilize support in a predominantly non-Catholic country. Diệm recognized that concern and broadened his lobbying efforts to include a development focus in addition to anti-communism and religious factors. Diệm was motivated by the knowledge that the US was enthusiastic in applying their technology and knowledge to modernize postcolonial countries.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; With the help of Fishel, then at Michigan State University (MSU), Diệm was appointed as a consultant to MSU's Government Research Bureau. MSU was administering government-sponsored assistance programs for cold war allies, and Diệm helped Fishel to lay the foundation for a program later implemented in South Vietnam, the [[Michigan State University Vietnam Advisory Group]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacob, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Americans' assessments of Diệm were varied. Some were unimpressed with him, some admired him. Diệm gained favor with some high-ranking officials, such as Supreme Court Justice [[William O. Douglas]], Roman Catholic cardinal [[Francis Spellman]], Representative [[Mike Mansfield]] of Montana, and Representative [[John F. Kennedy]] of [[Massachusetts]] along with numerous journalists, academics, and the legendary spy chief of the CIA [[William J.

Mansfield remembered after the luncheon with Diệm held on 8 May 1953, he felt that "if anyone could hold South Vietnam, it was somebody like Ngô Đình Diệm".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Senator Mansfiled: the Extraordinary Life of a Great American Statesman and Diplomat|last= Oberdorfer|first= Don|publisher= |year= 2003|isbn= |location= Washington, DC|pages= 77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Diệm's exile, his brothers Ngô Đình Nhu, Ngô Đình Cẩn, and Ngô Đình Luyện played important roles in helping him to build international and internal networks and support in different ways&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Bên giòng lịch sử, 1940–1965|last= Cao|first= Văn Luận|publisher= |year= 1972|isbn= |location= Sài Gòn - Trí Dũng|pages= 180–189.}}&lt;/ref&gt; for his return to Vietnam. In the early 1950s, Nhu established the [[Personalist Labor Revolutionary Party|Cần Lao Party]], which played a key role in helping Diệm attain and consolidate his power.

==Becoming Prime Minister and consolidation of power==
Until 1953, the State of Vietnam was nominally independent from Paris. Since dissatisfaction with France and Bảo Đại was rising among non-communist nationalists, and support from non-communist nationalists and Diệm's allies was rising for his "true independence" point of view, Diệm sensed that it was time for him to come to power in Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, pp. 94–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1954, Bảo Đại offered Diệm the position of Prime Minister in the new government in Vietnam. In May 1954, the French surrendered at [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu|Điện Biên Phủ]] and the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Conference]] began in April 1954. On 16 June 1954, Diệm met with Bảo Đại in France and agreed to be the Prime Minister if Bảo Đại would give him military and civilian control. On 25 June 1954, Diệm returned from exile, arriving at Tân Sơn Nhứt airport in Saigon. On 7 July 1954, Diệm established his new government with a cabinet of 18 people.&lt;ref name="Moyar, p.33"&gt;Moyar, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;
On 21 July 1954, the Geneva accords temporarily partitioned Vietnam at the 17th parallel, pending elections in 1956 to reunify the country. The [[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]] controlled the north, while the French-backed State of Vietnam controlled the south with Diệm as the Prime Minister. Diệm criticized the French for abandoning North Vietnam to the Communists at Geneva, claimed that the terms did not represent the  will of the Vietnamese people, and refused French suggestions to include more pro-French officials in the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Cauldron of resistance: Ngo Dinh Diem, the United States, and 1950s southern Vietnam|last= Chapman|first= Jessica|publisher= Ithaca: Cornell University Press|year= 2013|isbn= |location= |pages= 69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first period of his premiership, Diệm did not have much power in the government; he lacked control of the military and police forces, and the civil system's key positions were still held by French officials. He also could not control the Bank of Indochina. Besides, Diệm had to face massive obstacles: refugee issues; the French colonists wanting to remove Diệm to protect France's interest in South Vietnam; general [[Nguyễn Văn Hinh]], a Francophile, the leader of National Army was ready to oust Diệm; the leaders of the [[Hòa Hảo]] and [[Cao Đài]] sectarian armies wanted positions in Diệm's cabinet and complete administrative control over the areas in which they had large numbers of followers; and the major threat of [[Bình Xuyên]], an organized crime syndicate that controlled the National Police led by [[Lê Văn Viễn]], whose power was focused in Saigon&lt;ref&gt;Moyar, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; In summer 1954, the three organizations controlled approximately one-third of the territory and population of South Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; In that situation, besides his own political skills, Diệm had to trust in his relatives and the backing of his American supporters to overcome the obstacles and neutralize his opponents.&lt;ref&gt;Moyar, pp. 41–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Geneva accords allowed for freedom of movement between the two zones until October 1954; this put a large strain on the south. Diệm had only expected 10,000 refugees, but by August, there were more than 200,000 waiting for evacuation from Hanoi and Hải Phòng. Nevertheless, the migration helped to strengthen Diệm's political base of support. To deal with the refugee situation, Diem's government arranged for their relocation into fertile and under-populated provinces in the western Mekong Delta. The Diệm regime also provided them with food and shelter, farm tools, and housing material. The government also dug irrigation canals, built dikes, and dredged swamp-lands to help stabilise their lives.&lt;ref&gt;Moyar, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1954, Diệm also had to face the "Hinh crisis" when Nguyễn Văn Hinh launched a series of public attacks on Diệm, proclaiming that South Vietnam needed a "strong and popular" leader. Hinh also bragged that he was preparing a coup. However, at the end of 1954, Diệm successfully forced Hinh to resign from his post. Hinh had to flee to Paris and hand over his command of the national army to general Nguyễn Văn Vỹ.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Chapman, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; But the National Army officers favoured Diệm's leadership over General Vỹ, which forced him to flee to Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Moyar, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the failure of Hinh's alleged coup, the French continued to encourage Diệm's enemies in an attempt to destabilize him.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;

On 31 December 1954, Diệm established the National Bank of Vietnam and replaced the Indochinese banknotes with new Vietnamese banknotes.&lt;ref&gt;Years of the Ngô Đình Diệm administration|page= 307&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1955, although American advisors encouraged Diệm to negotiate with the leaders of the political-religious forces who threatened to overthrow his position and to forge an anti-communist bloc, he was determined to attack his enemies to consolidate his power.&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1955, Diệm's army forces took most of Bình Xuyên's posts in Saigon after a victory in the [[Battle of Saigon (1955)|Battle of Saigon]]. Within a few months, Diệm's troops wiped out the Bình Xuyên's remnants, leaving only a few small bands, who then joined forces with the communists. The failure of Bình Xuyên marked the end of French efforts to remove Diệm.&lt;ref&gt;Moyar, pp. 51–53.&lt;/ref&gt; After the defeat of Bình Xuyên, the authority and prestige of Diệm's government increased. Most of the Cao Đài leaders chose to rally to Diệm's government.&lt;ref&gt;Moyar, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Diệm then dismantled the private armies of the Cao Đài and Hòa Hảo religious sects. By the end of 1955, Diệm had almost taken control of South Vietnam, and his government was stronger than ever before.&lt;ref&gt;Moyar, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1956, along with the capture of Ba Cụt, the leader of the last Hòa Hảo rebels, Diệm almost subdued all of his non-communist enemies, and could focus on his Vietnamese communist opponents.&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Miller, Diệm's capacity in subduing his enemies and consolidating his power strengthened US support of his government, although the US government had planned to withdraw its backing from Diệm during his early difficult years of leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presidency (1955–1963)==

===Establishment of Republic of Vietnam===
{{Main|State of Vietnam referendum, 1955}}

[[File:Presidential Standard of South Vietnam (1955-1963).png|thumb|Presidential Standard of South Vietnam (1955–1963)]]
In South Vietnam, a referendum was scheduled for 23 October 1955 to determine the future direction of the south, in which the people would choose Diệm or Bảo Đại as the leader of South Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;Moyar, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; During the election, Diệm's brother Ngô Đình Nhu and the [[Personalist Labor Revolutionary Party|Cần Lao Party]] supplied Diệm's electoral base in organizing and supervising the elections, especially the propaganda campaign for destroying Bảo Đại's reputation. Supporters of Bảo Đại were not allowed to campaign.&lt;ref name="karnow55"/&gt; Official results showed 98.2 per cent of voters favoured Ngô Đình Diệm, an implausibly high result that was condemned as fraudulent. The total number of votes far exceeded the number of registered voters by over 380,000, further evidence that the referendum was heavily rigged.&lt;ref name="karnow55"&gt;Karnow, pp. 223–24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jacobs"&gt;Jacobs, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, only 450,000 voters were registered in Saigon, but 605,025 were said to have voted for Diệm.&lt;ref name="karnow55"&gt;Karnow, pp. 223–24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jacobs"&gt;Jacobs, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 October 1955, Diệm proclaimed the formation of the Republic of Vietnam, with himself as its first President, although only until 26 October 1956, the first Constitution provided articles to establish the republic and organize the election of its president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldstatesmen.org/South-Vietnam-Constitution1956.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-11-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170618155518/http://www.worldstatesmen.org/South-Vietnam-Constitution1956.pdf |archivedate=18 June 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1954 Geneva Accords prescribed elections to reunify the country in 1956. Diệm refused to hold these elections, claiming that a free election was not possible in the North.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KaootJV5BR4C&amp;pg=PA8&amp;dq=Unheralded+victory+Poland&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bnPET6WADZSo8AS086WeCw&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Unheralded Victory: The Defeat Of The Viet Cong And The North Vietnamese ... – Mark William Woodruff – Google Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624064844/https://books.google.com/books?id=KaootJV5BR4C&amp;pg=PA8&amp;dq=Unheralded+victory+Poland&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bnPET6WADZSo8AS086WeCw&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA |date=24 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Taylor, Diệm's rejection of the Geneva accords was a way of objecting to the French colonization of Vietnam. Diệm's disposition of Bảo Đại and the establishment of the First Republic of Vietnam was a way to claim Vietnamese independence from France.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the first Constitution of the Republic of Vietnam was promulgated. According to the Constitution, Diệm had almost absolute power over South Vietnam. His governance style became increasingly dictatorial over time.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Personalist Labor Revolutionary Party|Can Lao Party]] played a key role in Diệm's regime. Initially, the party acted secretly based on a network of cells, and each member only knew the identities of a few other members. When necessary, the Party could assume the role of the government. After 1954, the existence of the party was recognized, but its activities were hidden from public view. In the early 1950s, Diệm and Nhu used the party to mobilize support for Diệm's political movements. According to the decree 116/BNV/CT of the Republic of Vietnam, the Can Lao Party was established on 2 September 1954. [[Personalist Labor Revolutionary Party|Personalism (''Vietnamese: Chủ nghĩa nhân vị'')]] officially became the basic doctrine of Diệm's regime since the Constitution's preface declared that "Building Politics, Economy, Society, Culture for the people based on respecting Personalism".&lt;ref&gt;Nguyễn, Xuân Hoài (2011). ''Chế độ Việt Nam cộng hòa ở miền Nam Việt Nam giai đoạn 1955–1963 Republic of Vietnam regime in South Vietnam (1955–1963), Dissertation''. Ho Chi Minh city: University of Social Sciences and Humanities – Ho Chi Minh city. pp. 43–47.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Miller, [[democracy]], to Diệm, was rooted in his dual identity as Confucian and Catholic, and was associated with [[communitarianism]] and the doctrine of Personalism. He defined democracy as "a social ethos based on certain sense of moral duty", not in the US sense of "political right" or political pluralism and in the context of an Asian country like Vietnam, Confucian values were relevant to deal with contemporary problems in politics, governance, and social change. In this sense, Diệm was not a reactionary mandarin lacking an interest in democracy as he has been portrayed by some scholars. His way of thinking about democracy became a key factor of his approach to political and administrative reform.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, pp. 137–39.&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 March 1956, the elections for the first RVN National Assembly were held in a more free and fair manner than the 1955 referendum.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Diệm's regime of "democratic one man rule" faced increasing difficulties. After coming under pressure from within Vietnam and from the United States, Diệm agreed to hold legislative elections in August 1959 for South Vietnam. But in reality, newspapers were not allowed to publish names of independent candidates or their policies, and political meetings exceeding five people were prohibited. Candidates who ran against government-supported opponents faced harassment and intimidation. In rural areas, candidates who ran were threatened using charges of conspiracy with the Việt Cộng, which carried the death penalty. Phan Quang Đán, the government's most prominent critic, was allowed to run. Despite the deployment of 8,000 ARVN plainclothes troops into his district to vote, Đán still won by a ratio of 6–1. The busing of soldiers occurred across the country, and when the new assembly convened, Đán was arrested.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, pp. 112–15&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1961, U.S. Vice President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] visited Saigon and enthusiastically declared Diệm the "[[Winston Churchill]] of Asia." Asked why he had made the comment, Johnson replied, "Diệm's the only boy we got out there." Johnson assured Diệm of more aid in molding a fighting force that could resist the communists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rQIfAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA132&amp;lpg=PA132&amp;dq=karnow.+diem&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9ICvJQUjph&amp;sig=WK-ABv3_827gXJxz9ZtShM243K0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjm8OyXlp_ZAhWEq1kKHUPRA3kQ6AEwBnoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Churchill.%20Only%20boy&amp;f=false|title=Cold War Mandarin: Ngo Dinh Diem and the Origins of America's War in Vietnam, 1950–1963|last=Jacobs|first=Seth|date=24 July 2006|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|year=|isbn=9780742573956|location=|pages=123–125|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180221092044/https://books.google.com/books?id=rQIfAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA132&amp;lpg=PA132&amp;dq=karnow.+diem&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9ICvJQUjph&amp;sig=WK-ABv3_827gXJxz9ZtShM243K0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjm8OyXlp_ZAhWEq1kKHUPRA3kQ6AEwBnoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Churchill.%20Only%20boy&amp;f=false|archivedate=21 February 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Socio-economic policies===
During his presidency, Diệm imposed programs to reform Saigon society in accordance with Catholic and Confucian values. Brothels and opium dens were closed, divorce and abortion were made illegal, and adultery laws were strengthened.&lt;ref&gt;Kolko, Gabriel (1987). ''Vietnam: Anatomy of a War, 1940–1975''. Unwin Paperbacks, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Besides, Diệm's government established many schools and universities, such as the National Technical Center at Phú Thọ in 1957, the University of Saigon (1956), the University of Hue (1957), and the University of Dalat (1957)&lt;ref&gt;''Years of the Ngo Dinh Diem administration, p. 455''.&lt;/ref&gt; Diệm also paid attention to the preservation of Vietnamese traditional culture. Diệm restored and organized some traditional festivals, such as Hung kings ancestor festival (No, but on the contrary, Ngo Dinh Diệm during his nine years in power did not allow any celebration of the Hung kings, the Vietnam National founding fathers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sachhiem.net/printemail.php?id=2363 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-11-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201031310/http://www.sachhiem.net/printemail.php?id=2363 |archivedate=1 December 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.todinhtudamhaingoai.org/vn/?15659=5&amp;596=21&amp;759=986&amp;59615=4 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-11-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201034757/http://www.todinhtudamhaingoai.org/vn/?15659=5&amp;596=21&amp;759=986&amp;59615=4 |archivedate=1 December 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.giaodiemonline.com/thuvien/debate/buian_ptn.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-11-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201044412/http://www.giaodiemonline.com/thuvien/debate/buian_ptn.htm |archivedate=1 December 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;), The Trưng sisters festival ... According to Diệm, the values of traditional culture, along with Catholic and Confucian values were powerful in the fight against Materialism.&lt;ref&gt;Nguyễn Xuân Hoài, pp. 141–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding economic development, Diệm  and Nhu, in the political program of the Can Lao party and National Revolutionary Movement, pointed out the key factors of the RVN economy: a developed and independent economy, support for local capitalists, stabilized currency and reduced budget deficits; enhanced building infrastructure to meet military needs and create a prosperous South Vietnam. In 1957, Diệm's government suggested the 5-year plan (1957–1961), which aimed at expanding cultivated area to 20 percent and improving agricultural production to 25%, restoring exploitative industry and developing infrastructure. On 31 December 1955, Diệm promulgated Decree 48 on RVN independence on currency and banknotes (This is not in accordance with the first sentence of the last paragraph under "Being Prime Minister and consolidation of power" subtitle, with ref 54).&lt;ref&gt;Nguyễn Xuân Hoài, pp. 130–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Diệm's government also encouraged the development of handicrafts, industry, and commerce. In October 1957, Diệm established the Center for Technological Development for Investment, Instruction, and  Cooperation and supported private technological activities to gradually diminish the role of foreign capitalists, especially French capitalists in industry and to enhance the role of indigenous capitalists in the RVN economy. In 1961, Diệm suggested the second 5-year plan (1962–1966) to continue the first 5-year plan. During the first Republic of Vietnam, some indigenous industrial zones or factories were founded, such as the Cogido paper factory in An Hảo (1961), Vinatexco and Vimytex textile factories, the Khánh Hội glassware factory, the Hà Tiên and Thủ Đức cement factories, the Đa Nhim hydroelectric facility (1961), Đà Lạt nuclear research centre (1963), and the Biên Hòa industrial zone (1963). During 1956–1960, Diệm built a relatively stable RVN with a stable economy along with development of infrastructure and people's standards of living due to export of home comforts. Nevertheless, Diệm also admitted the dependence of RVN's economy on US assistance: "Today, the country is not self-sufficient. We can say that foreign assistance is a kind of compensation for the services our people have provided to the free world to protect SEA market, and to fight against manipulations of international communism".&lt;ref&gt;Nguyễn Xuân Hoài, pp. 136–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rural development===
During Diệm's reign, the Commissariat General for Civic Action (''Vietnamese: Công Dân vụ'') was established in March 1955 to "improve the intellectual level of the rural population and to raise the standard of living in rural areas in view to setting up a democratic basis and to promote a rural and material rearmament among the people".&lt;ref&gt;Years of the Ngo Dinh Diem administration, p. 455.&lt;/ref&gt; The Civic Action was considered a practical tool of Diệm's government to serve "the power vacuum" and make a rural influence for Diệm's government in countryside due to the departure of Việt Minh cadres after the Geneva Accords (1954). Steward's study provides a clearer picture of Diệm's domestic policies and a further understanding of his government's efforts in reaching and connecting with local communities in South Vietnam that shows "an indigenous initiative" of South Vietnam government in building an independent and viable nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= |title= Hearts, Minds and Cong Dan Vu: The Special Commissariat for Civic Action and Nation Building in Ngô Đình Diệm's Vietnam, 1955–1957|last= Stewart|first= G. C.|date= 2011|journal= Journal of Vietnamese Studies |volume=6 |issue=3 |page=44|doi= |pmid= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Land Reform:''' In South Vietnam, especially in Mekong Delta, landholdings in rural areas were concentrated in small number of rich landlord families. Thus, it was urgent to implement land reform in South Vietnam. Diệm had two attempts to control the excesses of the land tenancy system by promulgating the Ordinance 2 on 28 January 1955 to reduce land rent between 15% to 25% of the average harvest and the Ordinance 7 on 5 February 1955 to protect the rights of tenants on new and abandoned land and enhancing cultivation. In October 1956, with the urge from [[Wolf Ladejinsky]], Diệm's personal adviser on agrarian reform, Diệm promulgated a more serious ordinance on the land reform, in which he proclaimed a "land to the tiller" program to put a relatively high 100 hectares limit on rice land and 15 hectares for ancestral worship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= A Decade of Public Service: Nation Building during the Interregnum and Second Republic (1964–1975) in Voices from the second Republic of Vietnam (1967–1975), edited by Keith Taylor|last= Trần|first= Quang Minh|publisher= Southeast Asia Program Publications|year= 2014|isbn= 9780877277958|location= New York|page= 54}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this measure had no real effect because many landlords evaded the redistribution by transferring the property to the name of family members. Besides, during the 1946–54 war against the French Union forces, the Việt Minh had gained control of parts of southern Vietnam, initiated land reform, confiscated landlords' land and distributed it to the peasants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= The Vietnam Wars|last= Young|first= Marilyn B.|publisher= HarperPerennial|year= 1991|isbn= 0-06-016553-7|location= New York|pages= 56–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the ceiling limit was more than 30 times that allowed in Japan, [[South Korea]], and [[Taiwan]], and the 370,000 acres (1,500&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of the Catholic Church's landownings in Vietnam were exempted.  The political, social, and economic influences of the land reform was minimal.&lt;ref&gt;Trần Quang Minh, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1957 to 1963, only 50 percent of expropriated land was redistributed, and only 100,000 out of approximately one million tenant farmers in South Vietnam benefited from the reform.&lt;ref&gt;Trần Quang Minh, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Resettlement:''' According to Miller, Diệm, who described tenant farmer as "real proletariat" and pursued the goal of "middle peasantization", was not a beholden of large landowners, instead of vigorously implementing Land Reform, Diệm had his own vision in Vietnamese rural development based on resettlement, which focused on redistribution of people (rather than land), could reduce overpopulation and lead to many benefits in socio-economic transformation as well as military affairs and security, especially anti-communist infiltration. Moreover, Diệm was ambitious to envision Resettlement as a tactic to practice the government's ideological goals. The US and Diệm's differences over nation building in countryside shaped the clashes in their alliance.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cái Sắn resettlement project: In late 1955, with the help of US material support and expertise, Diệm's government implemented the project Cái Sắn in An Giang province, which aimed to resettle one hundred thousand northern refugees.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Miller, pp. 165–84.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Land Development program''' (''Khu dinh điền''): In early 1957, Diệm started a new program called the ''Land Development'' to relocate poor inhabitants, demobilized soldiers, and minority ethnic groups in central and southern Vietnam into abandoned or unused land in Mekong Delta and Central Highland, and cultivating technological and scientific achievements to transform South Vietnam and ensure security and prevent communist infiltration. Diệm believed that the program would help improve civilians' lives, teach them the values of being self-reliant and hard working. At the end of 1963, the program had built more than two hundred settlements for a quarter of a million people. Nevertheless, the lacks of conditions in these areas along with the corruption and mercilessness of local officials failed the program.&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt;

'''Agroville program''' (''khu trù mật''): During late 1959 and early 1960, motivated by the idea of population regroupment, Diệm introduced the Agroville Program, which he intended to physically relocate residents who lived in remote and isolated regions in Mekong delta into new settlements in "dense and prosperous areas"—proposing to offer them urban modernity and amenities without leaving their farms,&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt; and to keep them far away from the communists. Nonetheless, by late 1960, Diệm had to admit that the program's objective failed since the residents were not happy with the program and the communists infiltrated the program, and he had to discard it.&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt;

According to Miller, The US and Diệm's disagreement in their approaches to agrarian reform in countryside made their alliance "moved steadily from bad to worse".&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt;

===Counter-insurgency===
{{Main|1960 South Vietnamese coup attempt|1962 South Vietnamese Independence Palace bombing}}

During his presidency, Diệm strongly focused on his central concern: internal security to protect his regime as well as maintain order and social change: staunch anti-subversion and anti-rebellion policies. After the Bình Xuyên was defeated and the Hòa Hảo, Cao Đài were subdued, Diệm concentrated on his most serious threat: the communists. Diệm's main measures for internal security were threats, punishment and intimidation.&lt;ref name="Miller, p.187"&gt;Miller, p.187&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gabriel Kolko about 12,000 suspected opponents of Diệm were killed between 1955 and 1957 and by the end of 1958 an estimated 40,000 political prisoners had been jailed.&lt;ref&gt;Kolko, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 1959, Diệm was able to entirely control each family and the communists had to suffer their "darkest period" in their history. The number of membership declined by two thirds and had almost no power in the countryside of South Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob, p. 90; Moyar, pp. 85–86.&lt;/ref&gt; Diệm's repression extended beyond communists to anti-communist dissidents and anti-corruption whistleblowers. In 1956, after the "Anti-Communist Denunciation Campaign", Diệm issued Ordinance No. 6, which placed anyone who was considered a threat to the state and public order in jail or house arrest.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob, pp. 89–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, Diệm's hard policies led to fear and resentment in many quarters in South Vietnam and negatively affected his relations with the US in terms of counter-insurgent methods.&lt;ref name="Miller, p.187"/&gt; On 22 February 1957, when Diệm delivered a speech at an agricultural fair in Buôn Ma Thuột, a communist cadre named Hà Minh Tri attempted to assassinate the president. He approached Diệm and fired a pistol from close range, but missed, hitting the Secretary for Agrarian Reform's left arm. The weapon jammed and security overpowered Tri before he was able to fire another shot. Diệm was unmoved by the incident.&lt;ref name="Moyar, pp. 66–67"&gt;Moyar, pp. 66–67&lt;/ref&gt; The assassination was the response of the desperation of the communists to Diệm's relentless anti-communist policies.&lt;ref name="Moyar, pp. 66–67"/&gt;

As opposition to Diệm's rule in South Vietnam grew, a low-level insurgency began to take shape there in 1957. Finally, in January 1959, under pressure from southern Viet Cong cadres who were being successfully targeted by Diệm's secret police, Hanoi's Central Committee issued a secret resolution authorizing the use of armed insurgency in the South with supplies and troops from the North. On 20 December 1960, under instructions from Hanoi, southern communists established the [[Viet Cong]] (NLF) in order to overthrow the government of the south. On 11 November 1960, "a failed coup attempt against President Ngô Đình Diệm of South Vietnam was led by Lieutenant Colonel Vương Văn Đông and Colonel Nguyễn Chánh Thi of the [[Republic of Vietnam Airborne Division|Airborne Division]] of the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN)".&lt;ref&gt;Karnow, A history of Vietnam, pp. 252–53&lt;/ref&gt; There was a further attempt to assassinate Diệm and his family in February 1962 when two air force officers—acting in unison—bombarded the Presidential Palace.&lt;ref&gt;Karnow, 280–81&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, pp. 131–32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moyar, pp. 151–52.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gvnhamlet.jpg|thumb|South Vietnamese "Strategic Hamlet"]]

In 1962, the cornerstone of Diệm's counterinsurgency effort – the [[Strategic Hamlet Program]] (''Vietnamese:'' ''Ấp Chiến lược''), "the last and most ambitious of Diem's government's nation building schemes", was implemented, calling for the consolidation of 14,000 villages of South Vietnam into 11,000 secure hamlets, each with its own houses, schools, wells, and watchtowers supported by South Vietnamese government. The hamlets were intended to isolate the National Liberation Front (NLF) from the villages, their source for recruiting soldiers, supplies, and information, and to transform the countryside. In the end, because of many shortcomings, the Strategic Hamlet Program was not as successful as had been expected and was cancelled after the assassination of Diệm. However, according to Miller, the Strategic Hamlet Program created a remarkable turnabout in Diệm's regime in their war against communism.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious policies and the Buddhist crisis===
{{Main|Buddhist crisis}}{{See also|Huế Phật Đản shootings|Huế chemical attacks|Thích Quảng Đức|Xá Lợi Pagoda raids}}

Many historians have claimed that Diệm's religious policies favored Catholics and that he persecuted many Buddhists. The distribution of weapons to village self-defense militias intended to repel Việt Cộng guerrillas saw weapons only given to Catholics. Some Buddhist villages converted en masse to Catholicism in order to receive aid or to avoid being forcibly resettled by Diệm's regime.&lt;ref&gt;Buttinger, p. 993&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic Church was the largest landowner in the country, and the "private" status imposed on Buddhism by the French required official permission to conduct public Buddhist activities and was never repealed by Diệm.&lt;ref&gt;Karnow, p. 294&lt;/ref&gt; Catholics were also ''de facto'' exempt from the ''corvée'' labor that the government obliged all citizens to perform; US aid was disproportionately distributed to Catholic majority villages.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Diệm had contributed to Buddhist communities in South Vietnam by giving them permission to carry out activities that were banned by French and supported money for Buddhist schools, ceremonies, and building more pagodas. Among eighteen members of Diệm cabinet ministers, there were five Catholics, five Confucians, and eight Buddhists, including a vice-president and a foreign minister. Only three of the top nineteen military officials were Catholics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Moyar|last= |first= |publisher= |year= |isbn= |location= |page=216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If Diệm's government has always denied any allegation of persecution against Buddhists and presented these immolations and revolts as the fruit of infiltration of communist guerrillas disguised as bonzes; some French-Vietnamese authors support this thesis of infiltration, which then empowered a large instrumentalization of these disorders by the American and North Vietnamese propaganda in order to destabilize and demonize the South Vietnamese government.&lt;ref name="propaganda"&gt;{{fr}} Ngo-Dinh Quynh, Ngo-Dinh Le Quyen, Jacqueline Willemetz, ''La République du Viet-Nam et les Ngo-Dinh'', Paris 2013, p. 62 to 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Police raids have enabled the South Vietnamese authorities to find out presence of war's weapons in a number of pagodas, resulting in the closure of 12 of them.&lt;ref name="propaganda"/&gt;

The regime's relations with the United States worsened during 1963, as discontent among South Vietnam's Buddhist majority was simultaneously heightened. In May, in the heavily Buddhist central city of Huế, where Diệm's elder brother was the Catholic Archbishop, the Buddhist majority was prohibited from displaying Buddhist flags during Vesak celebrations commemorating the birth of Gautama Buddha when the government cited a regulation prohibiting the display of non-government flags.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt; A few days earlier, however, a Catholic flag flew at the 25th commemoration for Ngô Đình Thục's elevation to the rank of bishop. According to Miller, Diệm then proclaimed the flag embargo because he was annoyed with the commemoration for Thục.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Miller|last= |first= |publisher= |year= |isbn= |location= |page=266}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ban on religious flag led to a protest led by [[Thích Trí Quang]] against the government, which was suppressed by Diệm's forces, and unarmed civilians were killed in the clash. Diệm and his supporters blamed the Việt Cộng for the deaths and claimed the protesters were responsible for the violence.&lt;ref&gt;Moyar, pp. 212–13&lt;/ref&gt; Although the provincial chief expressed sorrow for the killings and offered to compensate the victims' families, they resolutely denied that government forces were responsible for the killings and blamed the Viet Cong. According to Diệm, it was the communists who threw a grenade into the crowd.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Buddhists pushed for a five-point agreement: freedom to fly religious flags, an end to arbitrary arrests, compensation for the Huế victims, punishment for the officials responsible, and religious equality. Diệm then banned demonstrations and ordered his forces to arrest those who engaged in civil disobedience. On 3 June 1963, protesters attempted to march towards the Từ Đàm pagoda. Six waves of ARVN tear gas and attack dogs failed to disperse the crowds. Finally, brownish-red liquid chemicals were doused on praying protesters, resulting in 67 being hospitalised for chemical injuries. A curfew was subsequently enacted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Jacob|last= |first= |publisher= |year= |isbn= |location= |page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The turning point came in June when a Buddhist monk, [[Thích Quảng Đức]], set himself on fire in the middle of a busy Saigon intersection in protest of Diệm's policies; photos of this event were disseminated around the world, and for many people these pictures came to represent the failure of Diệm's government.&lt;ref&gt;Moyar, p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt;  A number of other monks publicly self-immolated, and the US grew increasingly frustrated with the unpopular leader's public image in both Vietnam and the United States. Diệm used his conventional anti-communist argument, identifying the dissenters as communists. As demonstrations against his government continued throughout the summer, the special forces loyal to Diệm's brother, Nhu, conducted an August raid of the Xá Lợi pagoda in Saigon. Pagodas were vandalised, monks beaten, and the cremated remains of Quảng Đức, which included his heart, a religious relic, were confiscated. Simultaneous raids were carried out across the country, with the [[Từ Đàm pagoda]] in Huế looted, the statue of [[Gautama Buddha]] demolished, and the body of a deceased monk confiscated.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob, pp. 147–54.&lt;/ref&gt; When the populace came to the defense of the monks, the resulting clashes saw 30 civilians killed and 200 wounded. In all 1,400 monks were arrested, and some thirty were injured across the country. The United States indicated its disapproval of Diệm's administration when ambassador [[Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.]] visited the pagoda. No further mass Buddhist protests occurred during the remainder of Diệm's rule (which would amount to less than five months).&lt;ref&gt;Moyar, pp. 212–16, 231–34&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Madame Nhu]] Trần Lệ Xuân, Nhu's wife, inflamed the situation by mockingly applauding the suicides, stating, "If the Buddhists want to have another barbecue, I will be glad to supply the gasoline."&lt;ref&gt;Jacob, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; The pagoda raids stoked widespread public disquiet in [[Saigon]]. Students at Saigon University boycotted classes and rioted, which led to arrests, imprisonments, and the closure of the university; this was repeated at [[Huế University]]. When high school students demonstrated, Diệm arrested them as well; over 1,000 students from Saigon's leading high school, most of them children of Saigon civil servants, were sent to re-education camps, including, reportedly, children as young as five, on charges of anti-government graffiti. Diệm's foreign minister [[Vũ Văn Mẫu]] resigned, shaving his head like a Buddhist monk in protest.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; When he attempted to leave the country on a religious pilgrimage to India, he was detained and kept under house arrest.

There have been many interpretations of the Buddhist crisis and the immolation of Thích Quảng Đức in 1963. Relating the events to the larger context of Vietnamese Buddhism in the twentieth century and looking at the interactions between Diệm and Buddhist groups, the Buddhist protests during Diệm's regime were not only the struggles for discrimination in religious practices and religious freedom, but also the resistance of Vietnamese Buddhism to Diệm's nation building policies centered by Personalist revolution that Buddhists considered a threat to the revival of Vietnamese Buddhist power.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt; Until the end of his life, Diệm, along with his brother Nhu still believed that their nation building was successful and they could resolve the Buddhist crisis in their own way, like what they had done with the Hinh crisis in 1954 and the struggle with the Bình Xuyên in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, pp. 277–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign policies===
{{Main|Ngô Đình Diệm presidential visit to Australia|Ngô Đình Diệm presidential visit to the United States}}The foreign policy of the Republic of Vietnam (RVN), according to Fishel, "to a very considerable extent", was the policy of Ngo Dinh Diem himself during this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= |title= The Foreign Policy of Ngo Dinh Diem|author= William Henderson |author2= Wesley R. Fishel|date= 1966|journal= Vietnam Perspectives |volume=2 |issue=1 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the decisive factor in formulating foreign policies of RVN, besides the roles of his adviser – Ngô Đình Nhu and his foreign ministers: Trần Văn Độ (1954–1955), Vũ Văn Mẫu (1955–1963) and Phạm Đăng Lâm (1963) who played subordinate roles in his regime. Nevertheless, since Diệm had to pay much attention to domestic issues in the context of the Vietnam War, foreign policies did not receive appropriate attention from him. Diệm paid more attention to countries that affected Vietnam directly and he seemed to personalize and emotionalize relations with other nations.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;William Henderson and Wesley R. Fishel, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The issues Diệm paid more attention in foreign affairs were: the Geneva Accords, the withdrawal of the French, international recognition and the cultivation of legitimacy of RVN and the relations with the United States, Laos (good official relations) and Cambodia (complicated relations, especially in border disputes, minority ethnics), and especially North Vietnam.&lt;ref name=":7"/&gt; Besides, RVN also focused on the diplomatic relations with other Asian countries to secure its international recognition.

Diệm's attitude toward [[India]] was not harmonized due to India's non-alignment policy, which Diệm assumed favor of communism. It was not until in 1962, since India voted on a report to criticize the communists for supporting invasion South Vietnam, Diệm eventually reviewed his opinions toward India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= William Henderson and Wesley R. Fishel|last= |first= |publisher= |year= |isbn= |location= |page= 22}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Japan, Diệm's regime established the diplomatic relations for the recognition of war reparations, which led to a reparation agreement in 1959 with the amount of $49 million.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|title= Years of Ngô Đình Diệm administration|last= |first= |publisher= |year= |isbn= |location= |page= 155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diệm also established friendly relations with non-communist states especially the Republic of Korea, the Republic of China, the Republic of the Philippines, the Kingdom of Thailand, the Kingdom of Laos and the [[Federation of Malaya]]&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; where Diệm's regime shared the common recognition of communist threats.&lt;ref&gt;William Henderson and Wesley R. Fishel, pp. 23–24.&lt;/ref&gt; RVN established diplomatic relations with Cambodia, India, Burma, Indonesia, Hong Kong and Singapore.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; RVN also established diplomatic relations with Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Morocco, and Tunisia ...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Years of Ngô Đình Diệm administration|pages=156–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the relations with Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Diệm maintained total hostility and never had serious effort to establish any relations with them. In relations with France, as an anti-colonialism nationalist, Diệm did not believe in France and France was always a negative factor in his foreign policy. He also never "looked up on France as a counterweight to American influence".&lt;ref&gt;William Henderson and Wesley R. Fishel, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning relations with the US, although Diệm admitted the importance of the US-RVN alliance, he perceived that the US's assistance to RVN was primarily serving its own national interest, rather than the RVN's.&lt;ref&gt;William Henderson and Wesley R. Fishel, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Keith Taylor adds that Diệm's distrust of the US grew because of its Laotian policy, which gave North Vietnam access to South Vietnam's border through southern Laos. Diệm also feared the escalation of American military personnel in South Vietnam, which threatened his nationalist credentials and the independence of his government.&lt;ref name="Taylor, p.3"&gt;Taylor, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1963, the Ngô brothers even revised their alliance with the US.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite book|title= Miller|last= |first= |publisher= |year= |isbn= |location= |pages=253– 60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, they also disagreed with the US on how to best react to the threat from North Vietnam. While Diệm believed that before opening the political system for the participation of other political camps, military, and security matters should be taken into account; the US wanted otherwise and was critical of Diệm's clientelistic government, where political power based on his family members and trusted associates. The Buddhist crisis in South Vietnam decreased American confidence in Diệm, and eventually led to the coup d'état sanctioned by the US.&lt;ref name="Taylor, p.3"/&gt; Ultimately, nation-building politics "shaped the evolution and collapse of the US-Diem alliance". The different visions in the meanings of concepts – democracy, community, security, and social change – were substantial, and were a key cause of the strains throughout their alliance.&lt;ref name=":8"/&gt;

==Coup and assassination==
{{Main|Cable 243|1963 South Vietnamese coup|Arrest and assassination of Ngô Đình Diệm}}
As the Buddhist crisis deepened in July 1963, non-communist Vietnamese nationalists and the military began preparations for a coup. Bùi Diễm, later South Vietnam's Ambassador to the United States, reported in his memoirs that General [[Lê Văn Kim]] requested his aid in learning what the United States might do about Diệm's government.&lt;ref&gt;B. Diễm and D. Chanoff, ''In the Jaws of History'', p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Diễm had contacts in both the embassy and with the high-profile American journalists then in South Vietnam, [[David Halberstam]] (''New York Times''), [[Neil Sheehan]] (United Press International), and [[Malcolm Browne]] (Associated Press).&lt;ref&gt;B. Diễm and D. Chanoff, ''In the Jaws of History'', p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Corpse of Ngô Đình Diệm in the 1963 coup.jpg|alt=Ngô Đình Diệm after being shot and killed in the 1963 coup|thumb|[[Ngô Đình Diệm]] after being shot and killed in the 1963 coup]]
The coup d'état was designed by a military revolutionary council including [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam|ARVN]] generals led by General [[Dương Văn Minh]]. [[Lucien Conein]], a CIA operative, had become a liaison between the US Embassy and the generals, who were led by Trần Văn Đôn. They met each other for the first time on 2 October 1963 at Tân Sơn Nhất airport. Three days later, Conein met with General Dương Văn Minh to discuss the coup and the stance of the US towards it.&lt;ref name="Miller, p.312"&gt;Miller, p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt; Conein then delivered the White House's message of American non-intervention, which was reiterated by [[Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.]], the US ambassador, who gave secret assurances to the generals that the United States would not interfere.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The coup was chiefly planned by the Vietnamese generals.&lt;ref name="Miller, p.312"/&gt; Unlike the coup in 1960, the plotters of the 1963 coup knew how to gain broad support from other ARVN officer corps. They obtained the support of General Tôn Thất Định, General Đỗ Cao Trí, General Nguyễn Khánh, and the I Corps and II Corps Commanders. Only General Huỳnh Văn Cao of IV Corps remained loyal to Diệm.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, p. 320.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 November 1963, [[Dương Văn Minh|Minh]] and his co-conspirators overthrew the government in a swift coup. With only the palace guard remaining to defend Diệm and his younger brother Nhu, the generals called the palace offering Diệm exile if he surrendered. That evening, however, Diệm and his entourage escaped via an underground passage to Cha Tam Catholic Church in [[Cholon]], where they were captured the following morning, 2 November. The brothers were assassinated together in the back of an [[M113 armoured personnel carrier]] with a [[bayonet]] and [[revolver]] by Captain [[Nguyễn Văn Nhung]], under orders from Minh given while en route to the Vietnamese Joint General Staff headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;B. Diem, ''In the Jaws of History'', p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Diệm was buried in an [[unmarked grave]] in a cemetery next to the house of the US Ambassador.

==Aftermath==
Upon learning of Diệm's ouster and assassination, [[Ho Chi Minh|Hồ Chí Minh]] reportedly stated: "I can scarcely believe the Americans would be so stupid."&lt;ref name="moyarp286"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?pg=PA286&amp;id=phJrZ87RwuAC&amp;q Moyar, p. 286] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160408050442/https://books.google.com/books?pg=PA286&amp;id=phJrZ87RwuAC&amp;q |date=8 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The North Vietnamese Politburo was more explicit:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The consequences of the 1 November coup d'état will be contrary to the calculations of the US imperialists ... Diệm was one of the strongest individuals resisting the people and Communism. Everything that could be done in an attempt to crush the revolution was carried out by Diệm. Diệm was one of the most competent lackeys of the US imperialists &amp;nbsp;... Among the anti-Communists in South Vietnam or exiled in other countries, no one has sufficient political assets and abilities to cause others to obey. Therefore, the lackey administration cannot be stabilized. The coup d'état on 1 November 1963 will not be the last.&lt;ref name="moyarp286"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After Diệm's assassination, South Vietnam was unable to establish a stable government and several coups took place after his death. While the United States continued to influence South Vietnam's government, the assassination bolstered North Vietnamese attempts to characterize the South Vietnamese as "supporters of colonialism".&lt;ref&gt;Moyar, pp. 287–90&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diệm's legacies==
Diệm's assassination led to the collapse of his regime and the end of the first Republic of Vietnam. Nevertheless, Diệm's contribution over his nine years of power from 1954 to 1963 can be appreciated at many levels due to his part in resolving the northern refugees issue, establishing and consolidating the power of his regime, subduing the sects, and pacifying the country, Diệm stabilised an independent South Vietnam that had suffered in the first Indochina war and built a relatively stable government in Saigon during the late 1950s. The normalcy and domestic security created conditions for economic recovery and development of education in South Vietnam, which contributed educated human resources to serve the nation.&lt;ref name="Taylor, p.3"/&gt; Many universities were established during Diệm's presidency, such as: Huế University, Đà Lạt University, University of Pedagogy, the University of Saigon, University of Agriculture and Forestry, Medical University of Huế, and the National Institute of Administration, which applied the methods of European and American-style vocational schools, contributing to education in the Republic of Vietnam.

[[File:OnceOnATime.jpg|thumb|First edition (publ. [[Hodder &amp; Stoughton]])]]
'''''Once On A Time''''' is a [[fairy tale]] created by [[A. A. Milne]].

Written in 1917, Milne's own introduction begins 'This is an odd book', and indeed it is very difficult to classify.  Ostensibly a typical fairytale, it tells the story of the war between the kingdoms of Euralia and Barodia and the political shenanigans which take place in Euralia in the king's absence, all supposedly rewritten by Milne from the writings of the fictional historian "Roger Scurvilegs".

Milne created the story to contain believable, three-dimensional characters, rather than the stereotypes which will satisfy children. Hence the book introduces us to a princess who is far from helpless; a prince who, whilst handsome, is also pompous and vain; an enchantment which is almost entirely humorous; a villain who is not entirely villainous and receives no real comeuppance; a good king who is not always good; an evil king who is not always evil, and so on.  The result is a book which children may not enjoy as much as adults.

The book was written by Milne partly for his wife, upon whom the character of the Countess Belvane was partially based.

==Plot summary==

When the King of Barodia receives a pair of [[seven-league boots]] as a birthday present, his habit of flying over the King of Euralia's castle during breakfast provokes a series of incidents which escalate into war.  While the King of Euralia is away, his daughter Hyacinth tries to rule in his stead and counter the machiavellian ambitions of the king's favourite, the Countess Belvane.

==Characters==

'''King Merriwig of Euralia''':  fat, jolly if occasionally pompous and easily led.  He nevertheless can show great strength of mind, as related in an anecdote in which he outwitted a fairy, mostly by sheer stubbornness.

'''Princess Hyacinth''':  Merriwig's daughter.  Rather more savvy than her father, she is nevertheless at first out of her depth when trying to rule the kingdom in his absence.  Despite this, she grows into the role.

'''The King of Barodia''':  Bombastic, proud and arrogant, and takes inordinate pride in his moustache.

'''The Countess Belvane''':  A difficult character.  Beautiful, proud and haughty, she is inclined to melodramatics and emotional self-indulgence.  Ostensibly the villain of the piece, her motives are complex and subtle.

'''Lady Wiggs''':  Hyacinth's closest friend;  helpful and dreamy.

'''Lady Woggs''':  A palace servant;  well-meaning but terribly dim.

'''Prince Udo of Araby''':  Prince of a neighbouring realm, invited by Hyacinth to help her in her troubles with Belvane.  He turns out to be very little help at all, partly due to suffering an embarrassing enchantment, but mostly due to his personality.

'''Coronel''':  Udo's companion-at-arms and best friend.  Far more laid-back and likeable than the prince.

'''Roger Scurvilegs''':  Noted historian of Euralia, author of the monumental work ''Euralia Past and Present''.  The narrator gives him credit for the basic facts of the story whilst gently lampooning him for his stuffiness.

==Themes and issues==

Milne himself resisted characterising the book.  In his foreword to the 1922 edition he wrote of it:

"For whom, then, is the book intended?  That is the trouble. Unless I can say, "For those, young or old, who like the things which I like," I find it difficult to answer. Is it a children's book? Well, what do we mean by that? Is ''[[Wind in the willows|The Wind in the Willows]]'' a children's book? Is ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland|Alice in Wonderland]]''? Is ''[[Treasure Island]]''? These are masterpieces which we read with pleasure as children, but with how much more pleasure when we are grown-up. In any case, what do we mean by "children"? A boy of three, a girl of six, a boy of ten, a girl of fourteen - are they all to like the same thing? And is a book "suitable for a boy of twelve" any more likely to please a boy of twelve than a modern novel is likely to please a man of thirty-seven;  even if the novel be described truly as "suitable for a man of thirty-seven"? I confess that I cannot grapple with these difficult problems.  But I am very sure of this: that no one can write a book which children will like, unless he write it for himself first. That being so, I shall say boldly that this is a story for grown-ups. [...]  But, as you see, I am still finding it difficult to explain just what sort of book it is. Perhaps no explanation is necessary. Read in it what you like; read it to whomever you like;  be of what age you like; it can only fall into one of the two classes. Either you will enjoy it, or you won't.

"It is that sort of book.&lt;ref&gt;Milne, A.A.: "Once On A Time" pp vi-viii, 1922 US ed. published by Grosset &amp; Dunlap (New York)&lt;/ref&gt;".

'''Pin-ups For Vets''' is a [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit]] [[charitable organization]] dedicated to helping injured and ill American [[United States Army|Soldiers]], [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]], [[United States Air Force|Airmen]], [[National Guard of the United States|Guards]], and [[United States Navy|Sailors]]—and current active-duty personnel. The project is the work of Gina Elise who sells and distributes the Pin-ups For Vets Calendar, which hearkens back to 1940s and 1950-style vintage pretty-girl images. The calendars are considered very tasteful by today's standards; they contain no [[Nudity|frontal nudity]], or nudity of any kind. Elise appears in various types of period costume and lingerie. Several other women are involved in the project as models besides Elise. Some of these women have served in the U.S. Armed Forces themselves. To date, the organization has donated over $50,000 to [[Veterans hospital|veterans hospitals]].

Vintage hardware often features in Pin-ups For Vets photography, including old bikes, aircraft and military [[tank|tanks]]. Elise also takes the time to travel to stateside [[military hospital]]s personally, delivering the calendars, posters, and T-shirts to wounded vets, soldiers, airmen, Marines, and seamen at their bedsides, and thanking them for their service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,477747,00.html | title=California Woman Raises Troop Morale, Funds With 'Pin-Ups for Vets' Calendar |publisher=FOX News |author=Diane Macedo |date=January 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Elise was awarded the Volunteer of the Year award by the Los Angeles Business Journal on May 5, 2009 (as part of the newspaper's "Women Making a Difference" award series). In November 2010, Gina was featured on an Oprah Winfrey Show episode honoring American volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/video?id=7804442&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2010, the movie [[Red (2010 film)|Red]] ([[Bruce Willis]] and [[Helen Mirren]], [[Summit Entertainment]]) featured Gina Elise in a scene showing her pin-up in a locker in the CIA headquarters.

Elise has so far raised over $50,000 for rehab programs that have gone to military and [[Veterans Health Administration|VA hospitals]], and in 2007 won the Outstanding Young Californian award from the [[United States Junior Chamber|Junior Chamber of Commerce]] and California Jaycees. Eight flags have been flown in honor of the "Pin-ups For Vets" calendar project on various military bases worldwide. Gina hopes to eventually visit a VA hospital in each of the fifty States.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12256">'''Psychoanalytic conceptions of language''' refers to the intersection of [[psychoanalytic]] theory with [[linguistics]] and [[psycholinguistics]]. [[Language]] has been an integral component of the psychoanalytic framework since its inception, as evidenced by the fact that [[Anna O.]] (pseud. for [[Bertha Pappenheim]]), whose treatment via the [[cathartic method]] influenced the later development of psychoanalytic therapy, referred to her method of treatment as the "[[talking cure]]" (Freud &amp; Breuer, 1895; de Mijolla, 2005).

Language is relevant to psychoanalysis in two key respects. First, it is important with respect to the therapeutic process, serving as the principal means by which unconscious mental processes are given expression through the verbal exchange between analyst and patient (e.g., [[free association (psychology)|free association]], [[dream analysis]], [[transference]]-[[countertransference]] dynamics). Secondly, psychoanalytic theory is linked in many ways to linguistic phenomena, such as [[parapraxes]] and the telling of [[jokes]]. According to [[Freud]] (1915, 1923), the essential difference between modes of thought characterized by ''primary'' (irrational, governed by the id) as opposed to ''secondary'' (logical, governed by the ego and external reality) thought processes is one of preverbal vs. verbal ways of conceptualizing the world.

==Freud's ideas on language==

According to Freud (1940), "...the function of speech…brings material in the [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]] into a firm connection with the residues of visual, but more particularly of auditory, perceptions" (p.&amp;nbsp;35). In other words, the mind is able to assimilate perceptual information through language - we are able to make sense of our perceptions by thinking about them in the form of words.

== Aphasia, thing- and word-presentations ==

One of Freud's earliest papers, ''On Aphasia'' (1891), was concerned with the speech disorder the neurological mechanisms of which had been investigated earlier in the century by [[Paul Broca]] and [[Carl Wernicke]]. Freud was skeptical of Wernicke's findings, citing a paucity of clinical observation as his reason. Although he conceded the fact that language is linked to [[neurological]] processes, Freud repudiated a model of [[localization of brain function]], according to which specific regions of the brain are responsible for certain cognitive functions. In contrast to most of his contemporaries, Freud rejected the notion that in most cases pathological phenomena are manifestations of physiological dysfunctions (Lanteri-Laura, 2005a).

In the same paper, Freud (1891) distinguishes between ''word-presentations'', the mental images of words, and ''thing-presentations'', the representations of actual objects. Word-presentations involve the linking of a conscious idea to a verbal stimulus, are associated with the secondary processes, and are oriented towards reality. Thing-presentations are essentially pre- or nonverbal images of objects, are associated with the primary processes, and are not necessarily connected with reality (Rycroft, 1995; Gibeault, 2005a, 2005b; Lanteri-Laura, 2005b). The influence of the external world on the ego is apparent here in that mental processes and word-presentations become connected only gradually as the ego differentiates from the [[Id, ego, and super-ego#Id|id]] as a result of contact with the environment (Rycroft, 1995; Freud, 1923). The idea of thing vs. word-presentations is also evident in Freud's hypotheses concerning [[schizophrenia]] (Rycroft, 1995; Freud, 1894, 1896). It is suggested that, as a defense against [[intrapsychic]] conflict, schizophrenics divest thing-presentations of significance and come to treat word-presentations as actual things (cf. mental functioning in [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]]'s [[preoperational]] stage of cognitive development).

== Parapraxes, jokes ==
The parapraxes (e.g., slips of the tongue and pen) and [[humor]] were two other areas related to language that Freud investigated. He conceptualized speech errors as discrepancies between what a speaker intended to say and what he or she actually said, indicating that the intention was [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] and prevented from being expressed accurately due to intrapsychic conflict (Freud, 1901). In terms of humor, Freud (1905) believed that jokes were an innocuous way of expressing sexual and/or aggressive impulses and easing psychic tension, thereby producing a degree of pleasure. Like dreams and [[neurosis|neurotic]] symptoms, jokes serve as compromise-formations and are indicative of many of the same fundamental processes characteristic of the unconscious, e.g., condensation and [[displacement (psychology)|displacement]]. However, unlike dreams and symptoms, jokes occur in an inter- rather than intrapersonal context and are dependent on the listener's ability to discern the ways in which the sense of the joke has been distorted through the condensation of words, multiple use of the same words or phrases, and the double meaning of words (cf. [[Paul Grice]]'s [[cooperative principle]], cf. also Ephratt 2004). The humorous quality of the following joke by Viennese journalist Daniel Spitzer is the result of simple phrase rearrangement:

{{quote|'Mr. and Mrs. X live in fairly grand style. Some people think that the husband '''has earned a lot and so has been able to lay by a bit'''; others again think that the wife '''has lain back a bit and so has been able to earn a lot''''|Freud, 1905|p. 35}}

In this joke, we see multiple use of the same phrase with words in a different order, as well as the double meaning of the words "lay" and "lain." Ostensibly about a couple's financial status, this joke is effective because it allows for the overcoming of inhibition and the indirect expression of sexual impulses through the double meaning of words.

==Psychoanalysis and psycholinguistics==

Over the past half century, there have been efforts by psychoanalysts and [[cognitive psychologist]]s to bridge the gap between their two respective disciplines. Rizzuto (2002) has discussed the nature of the verbal exchange between analyst and patient in the context of [[Roman Jakobson]]'s (1976, 1990) typology of the six functions of "the speech event": (1) referential, involving contextual information; (2) poetic, referring to the construction of the form of the message; (3) emotive, or the speaker's emotional influence vis-a-vis the receiver; (4) conative, or the speaker's orientation toward the receiver; (5) phatic, or the attempt to establish and maintain contact between speaker and receiver (e.g., "Can you hear me?"); and (6) metalingual, or the application of language to itself (e.g.,"What do you mean with that word?"). Rizzuto (2002) suggests that by paying an equal amount of attention to each of the six functions of the speech act, the analyst can obtain a more comprehensive picture of the patient's affective life. Conversely, by focusing on one function at a time, the analyst can ascertain the patient's different ways of mitigating [[anxiety]] or coping with stress.

In a symposium paper on psychoanalysis and linguistics, Harris (1995) offers a variety of reasons why the mutual exchange of ideas between the two disciplines is an important enterprise. The theoretical shift in psychoanalysis from [[libidinal]] development and drive states to [[object relations]] and [[attachment (psychology)|attachment]], first initiated around the middle of the twentieth century, is now incorporating more and more elements of [[cognitive science]] and psycholinguistics. The framework of [[intersubjectivity]] and model of the [[therapeutic alliance]] as a reciprocal exchange constructed by both analyst and patient call for a modification to both theory and practice, the ultimate aim of which is to think of the analytic process more in terms of [[interpersonal]] relations and "complex language worlds" (p.&amp;nbsp;616). Furthermore, over the past twenty years infancy research has greatly informed psychoanalytic theory, and the concepts of [[symbol]]ism and [[mental representation]] have influenced both frameworks. According to Harris (1995), the processes involved in the transition from nonverbal to verbal ways of thinking about and experiencing the world, first investigated in infancy research, have pointed to the relevance of language with respect to psychoanalytic thinking. A closer [[interdisciplinary]] relationship between psychoanalysis and linguistics could potentially bolster the former's status as a research paradigm at the intersection of [[hermeneutics]] and [[natural science]], a reformulation that some analysts have suggested (Strenger, 1991).

The new journal ''Language and Psychoanalysis''&lt;ref&gt;Cf. http://www.language-and-psychoanalysis.com/&lt;/ref&gt; is just devoted to research in the intersection between psychoanalysis and linguistics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3726">'''Serial art''' is an [[art movement]] in which uniform elements or objects were assembled in accordance with strict modular principles.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} The composition of serial art is a systematic process.

==Overview==
An early example of serial art is [[Constantin Brâncuși]]'s sculpture ''[[The Endless Column|Endless Column]]''.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

One type of serial art is the production of multiple objects (paintings, sculptures, etc.) in sets or series, for example [[Josef Albers]]'s well-known series of “square” paintings, where a single, repeating image creates a variation series. This technique later became associated with [[minimalism]], the “multiple”, and “ABC art”. However, there is a different type, which may be regarded as more essentially “serial” because it is “characterized by the nonhierarchical juxtaposition of equivalent representations, which only yield their complete meaning on the basis of their mutual relationship”.&lt;ref&gt;Sykora 1983, 7.&lt;/ref&gt; This produces sequential structures defined similarly to those of a [[twelve-tone row]], found for example in [[Max Bill]]'s series, ''Fünfzehn Variationen über ein Thema'' (1934–38), and in [[Richard Paul Lohse]]'s ''30 vertikale systematische Farbreihen in gelber Rautenform'' (1943–70) and ''Konkretion III'' (1947).&lt;ref&gt;Guderian 1985, 436–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sol LeWitt]] wrote that "the serial [[artist]] does not attempt to produce a beautiful or mysterious object but functions merely as a clerk cataloguing the results of his [[premise]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Sam Hunter|Hunter]] and Jacobus 1986, 326.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''13th Site Museum of Archaeology''' (Het Dertiende Plaats Museum van de Archeologie/十三行博物館) is an [[archaeological museum]] in [[Bali District]], [[New Taipei]], [[Taiwan]]. The museum conserves and displays artifacts from the 13th archaeological site.

==History==
The origins of the museum date back to excavations undertaken at the 13th site in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.sshm.ntpc.gov.tw/ History of the Museum], 13th Site Museum of Archaeology, TaiVan (Taiwan).&lt;/ref&gt; The 13th Site Museum was built in 1998.&lt;ref name="taiwan.com.au"&gt;[http://www.taiwan.com.au/Envtra/North/Taipei/report13.html Shihsanhang Museum of Archaeology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110412201456/http://www.taiwan.com.au/Envtra/North/Taipei/report13.html |date=2011-04-12 }}, [http://www.taiwan.com.au/ Taiwan.com.au].&lt;/ref&gt; It includes a "Bridge of Time" or Tijd Brug, that allows visitors to travel back through time to explore its civilization and culture.

In 2017, the museum became the first museum exhibiting its artifacts outside Taiwan when they held an exhibition in [[Miyazaki Prefecture]], [[Japan]] at the [[Saitobaru kofungun|Saitobaru Archaeological Museum]] displaying 105 artifact sets from the museum in Taiwan. The exhibition was jointly organized by scholars and experts from both sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aedu/201710070025.aspx|date=7 October 2017|first1=Christine|last1=Chen|title=Taiwan archaeological museum holds exhibition in Japan|publisher=Focus Taiwan|accessdate=10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geology==
The museum is located at the foot of [[Mount Guanyin (New Taipei)|Guanyin Mountain]] near Däamzui, old Dutch administrative region (see Dutch Red Haus, Fort Äarmmo-Schee). The archaeological site dates back from 1,800 years ago ([[Iron Age]]).

==Architecture==
The architecture of the museum has an archaeological theme, reflecting ancient civilization in Taivan (Taiwan) islandwide and in its outlying minor islands.

==Transportation==
The museum is accessible by bus from [[Guandu Station]] of [[Taipei Metro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.travelking.com.tw/eng/tourguide/taipei/bali.html |title=Bali travel guide of hot destinations(旅遊王TravelKing)–Taiwan travel hotels,New Taipei City tourism,Bali |publisher=Travelking.com.tw |date= |accessdate=2014-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Lonely Crowd''''' is a 1950 [[sociology|sociological]] analysis by [[David Riesman]], [[Nathan Glazer]], and [[Reuel Denney]]. Together with ''[[White Collar: The American Middle Classes]]'' (1951), written by Riesman's friend and colleague, [[C. Wright Mills]], it is considered a landmark study of American [[character structure|character]].&lt;ref name="chron"&gt;{{Cite news|title= David Riesman, Thoughtful Pragmatist |url= http://chronicle.com/free/v48/i37/37b00501.htm |publisher= The Chronicle of Higher Education | first= Todd |last= Gitlin |date= May 24, 2002 |accessdate= 2006-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2011}}
Riesman et al. identify and analyze three main cultural types: tradition-directed, inner-directed, and other-directed. They trace the evolution of society from a tradition-directed culture, one that moved in a direction defined by preceding generations. Tradition-directed social types obeyed rules established a long time in the past and rarely succeeded in modern society, with its dynamic changes.{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} This earliest social type was succeeded by people who were inner-directed. They discovered the potential within themselves to live and act not according to established norms but based on what they discovered using their own inner [[gyroscope]]. Inner-directed people live as adults what they learned in childhood, and tend to be confident, sometimes rigid. After the [[Industrial Revolution]] in America had succeeded in developing a middle-class state, institutions that had flourished within the tradition-directed and the inner-directed social framework became secondary to daily life. Instead of living according to traditions, or conforming to the values of organized religion, [[family values|of the family]], or societal codes, the new middle class gradually adopted a malleability in the way people lived with each other. The increasing ability to consume goods and afford material abundance was accompanied by a shift away from tradition to inner-directedness. How to define one's self became a function of the way others lived.

Gradually an other-direction took hold, that is, the social forces of how others were living—what they consumed, what they did with their time, what their views were toward politics, work, play, and so on. Riesman and his researchers found that other-directed people were flexible and willing to accommodate others to gain approval. Because large organizations preferred this type of personality, it became indispensable to the institutions that thrived with the growth of industry in America. As Riesman writes, "The other-directed person wants to be loved rather than esteemed", not necessarily to control others but to relate to them. Those who are other-directed need assurance that they are emotionally in tune with others. By the 1940s, the other-directed character was beginning to dominate society. Today the triumph of this type of social personality is complete. If one applies the other-direction criteria to everyday actors as portrayed in modern culture, for example, the other-directed person is easy to identify.{{Original research inline|date=February 2011}}

This defined the [[middle class]] that no longer had the material needed to cling to past life standards to form a cohesive society. But since the other-directed could only identify themselves through references to others in their communities (and what they earned, owned, consumed, believed in) they inherently were restricted in their ability to know themselves. Riesman's book argues that although other-directed individuals are crucial for the smooth functioning of the modern organization, the value of autonomy is compromised. ''The Lonely Crowd'' also argues that society dominated by the other-directed faces profound deficiencies in leadership, individual self-knowledge, and human potential. The book's title was chosen by the publisher, not by Riesman or his co-authors (Nathan Glazer and Reuel Denney).

'''''The Philosophical Review''''' is a quarterly [[academic journal|journal]] of [[philosophy]] edited by the faculty of the Sage School of Philosophy at [[Cornell University]] and published by [[Duke University Press]] (since September 2006). The journal publishes original work in all areas of [[analytic philosophy]], but emphasizes material that is of general interest to academic philosophers. Each issue of the journal contains approximately two to four articles along with several book reviews.  It was ranked the best English-language general philosophy journal in a poll conducted on the popular philosophy blog Leiter Reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Brian Leiter |date =2009|title = The Highest Quality "General" Philosophy Journals in English|url = http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2009/03/the-highest-quality-general-philosophy-journals-in-english.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The journal has been in continuous publication since 1892. Volume I contained articles by [[William James]] and [[John Dewey]].

In philosophy, '''the Real''' is that which is the authentic, unchangeable truth. It may be considered a primordial, external dimension of experience, referred to as the [[Infinity|infinite]], [[absolute (philosophy)|absolute]] or [[noumenal]], as opposed to a reality contingent on [[sense perception]] and the material order. The Real is often considered irreducible to the [[symbolic order]] of lived experience, but may be gestured to in certain cases, such as the experience of the [[sublime (philosophy)|sublime]].

==In psychoanalysis==
===Lacan===
For [[Jacques Lacan]], the order of the real is not only opposed to the [[The Imaginary (psychoanalysis)|imaginary]] but is also located beyond the [[The Symbolic|symbolic]]. Unlike the symbolic, which is constituted in terms of oppositions such as "presence" and "absence", there is no absence in the real. The symbolic opposition between "presence" and "absence" implies the possibility that something may be missing from the symbolic, the real is "always in its place: it carries it glued to its heel, ignorant of what might exile it from there." If the symbolic is a set of differentiated signifiers, the real is in itself undifferentiated: "it is without fissure." The symbolic introduces "a cut in the real," in the process of signification: "it is the world of words that creates the world of things." Thus the real emerges as that which is outside language: "it is that which resists symbolization absolutely." The real is impossible because it is impossible to imagine, impossible to integrate into the symbolic order. This character of impossibility and resistance to symbolization lends the real its traumatic quality.

The primordial Real in which a (pre-[[Oedipal]]) human subject is born is differentiated from the real which a subject integrated into the [[symbolic order]] experiences. In the former, the real is the continuous, “whole” reality without categories and the differential function of language. Following the [[mirror stage]], however, and the eventual entrance of the imaginary and the symbolic (the split of the subject between the conscious imaginary and the unconscious symbolic), the real may only be experienced as traumatic gaps in the symbolic order. An example of this are traumatic events such as natural disasters, which effectively break down the signification of everyday life and cause a rupture of something alien and unrecognizable, without the usual grammar of the symbolic that conditions how to make meaning of something and how to proceed.

One of the main methods of psychoanalysis is to drain the traumatic experiences of the real into the symbolic through free association. The analyst searches the analysand’s discourse for sounds, words, or images of fixation and through dialectization attempt to bring these fixations to the regular [[metonymy|metonymic]] flow of the (unconscious) symbolic order, thereby integrating the subject further into their fantasy, usually referred to as “traversing the fantasy.”&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce Fink (psychoanalyst)|Bruce Fink]], ''The Lacanian Subject: Between Language and Jouissance'', Princeton University Press, 1997, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Žižek ===
Contemporary Slovenian philosopher [[Slavoj Žižek]] has expanded on Lacan's theories and described (at least) three modalities of the Real:&lt;ref name=Daly2004&gt;{{cite web|last=Daly|first=Glyn|title=Slavoj Zizek: A Primer|url=http://www.lacan.com/zizek-primer.htm|publisher=lacan dot com|accessdate=17 August 2012|year=2004|quote=The real Real is the hard limit that functions as the horrifying Thing (the Alien, Medusa's head, maelstrom and so on) - a shattering force of negation. The symbolic Real refers to the anonymous symbols and codes (scientific formulae, digitalisation, empty signifiers...) that function in an indifferent manner as the abstract "texture" onto which, or out of which, reality is constituted. In The Matrix, for example, the symbolic Real is given expression at the point where Neo perceives "reality" in terms of the abstract streams of digital output. In the contemporary world, Zizek argues that it is capital itself that provides this essential backdrop to our reality and as such represents the symbolic Real of our age (Zizek, 1999: 222; 276). With the ''imaginary real'' we have precisely the (unsustainable) dimension of fantasmatic excess-negation that is explored in Flatliners. This is why cyberspace is such an ambiguous imaginary realm.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The "real Real": a horrific thing, that which conveys the sense of [[Horror (emotion)|horror]] in horror films
* The "symbolic real": the signifier reduced to a meaningless formula like [[quantum physics]], which cannot be understood in any meaningful way, only grasped through abstract mathematics.
* The "imaginary real": an unfathomable something that permeates things as a trace of the sublime. This form of the real becomes perceptible in the film ''[[The Full Monty]]'', in the fact of disrobing the unemployed protagonists completely; in other words, through this extra gesture of "voluntary" degradation, something else, of the order of the sublime, becomes visible. Žižek also used the film ''[[The Sound of Music]]'' as an example, where the "invaded" Austrians are depicted more like provincial fascists (blond, beautiful, historic dresses), while the Nazis are managers, bureaucrats, etc., "like cosmopolitan decadent corrupted Jews." He posits that the movie has a hidden pro-fascist message that is not directly seen but embedded in the texture.

==In philosophy&lt;!--linked from 'Rudolf Christoph Eucken'--&gt;==

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Reality, says [[Rudolf Christoph Eucken]], is an independent spiritual world, unconditioned by the apparent world of sense. To know it and to live in it is man's true destiny. His point of contact with it is personality: the inward fount of his being: his heart, not his head. Man is real, and in the deepest sense alive, in virtue of this free personal life-principle within him; but he is bound and blinded by the ties set up between his surface-intelligence and the sense-world. The struggle for reality must be a struggle on man's part to transcend the sense-world, escape its bondage. He must renounce it, and be 're-born' to a higher level of consciousness; shifting his centre of interest from the natural to the spiritual plane. According to the thoroughness with which he does this, will be the amount of real life he enjoys. The initial break with the 'world,' the refusal to spend one’s life communing with one’s own cinematograph picture, is essential if the freedom of the infinite is to be attained. We are amphibious creatures: our life moves upon two levels at once—the natural and the spiritual. The key to the puzzle of man lies in the fact that he is "the meeting point of various stages of Reality." All his difficulties and triumphs are grounded in this. The whole question for him is, which world shall be central for him—the Real, vital, all-embracing life we call spirit, or the lower life of sense? Shall 'Existence,' the superficial obvious thing, or 'Substance,' the underlying verity, be his home? Shall he remain the slave of the senses with their habits and customs, or rise to a plane of consciousness, of heroic endeavour, in which—participating in the life of spirit—he knows reality because he is real?" ([[Evelyn Underhill]] (1911), ''Mysticism'', [https://archive.org/stream/mysticismstudyin00undeuoft#page/40/mode/2up p. 40])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"There are," says [[Plotinus]], "different roads by which this end [apprehension of the Infinite] may be reached. The love of beauty, which exalts the poet; that devotion to the One and that ascent of science which makes the ambition of the philosopher; and that love and those prayers by which some devout and ardent soul tends in its moral purity towards perfection. These are the great highways conducting to that height above the actual and the particular, where we stand in the immediate presence of the Infinite, who shines out as from the deeps of the soul." (Plotinus, Letter to Flaccus)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==In aesthetics==

Édouard Récéjac states: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;If the mind penetrates deeply into the facts of aesthetics, it will find more and more, that these facts are based upon an ideal identity between the mind itself and things. At a certain point the harmony becomes so complete, and the finality so close that it gives us actual emotion. The Beautiful then becomes the sublime; brief apparition, by which the soul is caught up into the true mystic state, and touches the Absolute, the Real. It is scarcely possible to persist in this Esthetic perception without feeling lifted up by it above things and above ourselves, in an ontological vision which closely resembles the Absolute of the Mystics. (Édouard Récéjac, ''Fondements de la Connaissance Mystique'' (1897), p. 74)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''triangle of reference''' (also known as the '''triangle of meaning'''&lt;ref&gt;[[Colin Cherry]] (1957) ''On Human Communication''&lt;/ref&gt; and the '''[[semiotics|semiotic]] triangle''') is a model of how linguistic symbols are related to the objects they represent. The triangle was published in ''[[The Meaning of Meaning]]'' (1923) by [[Charles Kay Ogden|Ogden]] and [[I. A. Richards|Richards]].&lt;ref&gt;[[C. K. Ogden]] and [[I. A. Richards]] (1923) ''[[The Meaning of Meaning]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  While often referred to as the "Ogden/Richards triangle" the idea is also expressed in 1810, by [[Bernard Bolzano]], in his ''Beiträge zu einer begründeteren Darstellung der Mathematik''.  However, the triangle can be traced back to the 4th century BC, in [[Aristotle]]'s ''Peri Hermeneias'' (often referred to in its Latin translation ''[[De Interpretatione]]'', second book of his ''[[Organon]]''). The Triangle relates to the [[problem of universals]], a philosophical debate which split ancient and medieval philosophers (mainly [[Platonic realism|realists]] and [[Nominalism|nominalists]]).

The triangle describes a simplified form of relationship between the speaker as '''subject''', a concept as '''object''' or referent, and its designation ('''sign''', signans). For more elaborated research see [[Semiotics]].

=== Other triangles ===
The relations between the triangular corners may be phrased more precisely in causal terms as follows{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}{{or|date=December 2012}}:

# The matter ''evokes'' the writer's thought.
# The writer ''refers'' the matter to the symbol.
# The symbol ''evokes'' the reader's thought.
# The reader ''refers'' the symbol back to the matter.

===The communicative stand===
Such a triangle represents ONE person, whereas communication takes place between TWO (objects, not necessarily persons). So imagine another triangle and consider that for the two to understand each other, the content that the "triangles" represent must fit or be aligned. Clearly, this calls for [[synchronisation]] and an interface as well as [[scale (ratio)|scale]] among other things. Notice also, that we perceive the world mostly through our eyes and in alternative phases of seeing and not seeing with change in the environment as the most important information to look for. Our [[eyes]] are [[Lens (anatomy)|lenses]]  and we see a surface (2D) in ONE direction (focusing) if we are stationary and the object is not moving either. This is why you may position yourself in one corner of the triangle and by replicating (mirroring) it, you will be able to see the whole picture, your [[cognitive]]  [[epistemological]] and the [[ontological]] [[existential]] or physical model of life, the universe, existence, etc. combined.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}{{or|date=December 2012}}

=== Direction of fit ===

[[John Searle]] used the notion of "direction of fit" to create a taxonomy of [[illocutionary act]]s.

Actually the arrows indicate that there is something exchanged between the two parties and it is a feedback cycle. Especially, if you imagine that the world is represented in both persons' mind and used for reality check. If you look at the triangle above again, then remember that reality check is not what is indicated there between the sign and the referent and marked as "true', because a term or a sign is allocated "arbitrarily'. What you check for is the observance of [[the law of identity]] which requires you and your partner to sort out that you are talking about the same thing. So the chunk of reality and the term are replaceable/interchangeable within limits and your concepts in the mind as presented in some appropriate way are all related and mean the same thing. Usually the check does not stop there, your ideas must also be tested for feasibility and doability to make sure that they are "real" and not "phantasy". Reality check comes from consolidating your experience with other people's experience to avoid [[solipsism]] and/or by putting your ideas (projection) in practice (production) and see the reaction. Notice, however how vague the verbs used and how the concept of a fit itself is left unexplained in details.{{Editorializing|date=December 2012}}

'''Watling Street''' is a route in England that began as an [[ancient trackway]] first used by the [[Britons (historical)|Britons]], mainly between the areas of modern [[Canterbury]] and {{nowrap|[[St Albans]]}} using a natural [[river ford|ford]] near [[Westminster]]. The [[Ancient Romans|Romans]] later paved the route, which then connected the Kentish ports of [[Portus Dubris|Dubris]] ([[Dover]]), [[Rutupiae]] ([[Richborough Castle|Richborough]]), [[Portus Lemanis|Lemanis]] ([[Lympne]]), and [[Regulbium]] ([[Reculver]]) to their bridge over the Thames at [[Londinium]] (London). The route continued northwest past [[Verulamium]] (St&amp;nbsp;Albans) on its way to [[Viroconium Cornoviorum|Viroconium]] ([[Wroxeter]]). The Romans considered the continuation on to [[Blatobulgium]] ([[Birrens]]) beyond [[Hadrian's Wall]] to be part of the same route, leading some scholars to call this Watling Street as well, although others restrict it to the southern leg. 

Watling Street was the site of [[Battle of Watling Street|Boudica's defeat by the Romans]] and was later the southwestern border of the [[Danelaw]]. In the early 19th century, the course between London and the [[English Channel|Channel]] was paved and became known as the [[Great Dover Road]]: today, the route from Dover to London forms part of the [[A2 road (Great Britain)|A2 road]]. The route from London to Wroxeter forms much of the [[A5 road (Great Britain)|A5 road]]. At various points along the historic route, the name Watling Street remains in modern use.

==Name==
The original [[Common Brittonic|Celtic]] and [[Latin|Roman]] name for the road is unknown and the Romans may not have viewed it as a single path at all, dividing it amongst two separate itineraries in [[Antonine Itinerary|one 2nd-century list]]. The modern name instead derives from the [[Old English]] ''{{lang|ang|Wæcelinga Stræt}}'', from a time when "street" {{nowrap|({{lang-la|via strata}})}} referred to any paved road and had no particular association with urban thoroughfares. The ''{{lang|ang|[[Waeclingas]]}}'' ("people of {{lang|ang|Waecla}}")&lt;ref name="Williamson p64"&gt;{{cite book |last=Williamson |first=Tom |title=The Origins of Hertfordshire |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L87sjkrXr60C&amp;pg=PA64 |accessdate=13 September 2014 |year=2000 |publisher=Manchester University Press |isbn=071904491X |page=64 }}&lt;/ref&gt; were a tribe in the [[St Albans]] area in the [[history of Anglo-Saxon England|early medieval period]]&lt;ref name="Williamson p64"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Cannon, ''A Dictionary of British History'', 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; with an early name of the town being ‘Waetlingacaester’ which would translate into modern English as ‘Watlingchester’.

It is uncertain whether they were considered part of [[Middle Saxons|Middlesex]] or [[Kingdom of Essex|Essex]] or a British remnant (''{{lang|ang|wæcla}}'' being a possible variation of Old English ''{{lang|ang|wealhas}}'', "foreigners", which gave the [[Welsh people|Welsh]] their English name).

The original Anglo-Saxon name for the section of the route between Canterbury and London was ''{{lang|ang|Casingc Stræt}}'' or Key Street, a name still borne by a hamlet on the road near [[Sittingbourne]].{{sfn|Margary|1973|p=34}} This section only later became considered part of Watling Street.{{sfn|Margary|1973|p=34}}

==Used as a boundary==
Watling Street has been used as a boundary of many historic administrative units, and some of these are still in existence today, either through continuity or the adoption of these as by successor areas.
Examples include:
* Watling Street was used as a boundary in the [[Treaty of Alfred and Guthrum]] and it is often inferred that this made the road the SW boundary of the [[Danelaw]]
* It is the boundary of Leicestershire and Warwickshire, this may be a legacy of the treaty described above.
* Watling Street forms part of the boundary of four London Boroughs ([[London Borough of Harrow|Harrow]], [[London Borough of Brent|Brent]], [[London Borough of Camden|Camden]] and [[London Borough of Barnet|Barnet]]) and is sometimes described as the boundary of [[West London (sub region)|West]] and [[North London]].

===British===
The broad, grassy [[ancient trackway|trackway]] found by the Romans had already been used by the [[Britons (Celtic people)|Britons]] for centuries. The main path led from [[Richborough]] on the [[English Channel]] to a natural [[river ford|ford]] in the [[River Thames|Thames]] at [[Thorney Island (London)|Thorney Island]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Loftie's Historic London (review) |journal=The Saturday Review of Politics, Literature, Science and Art |volume=63 |issue=1,634 |date=19 February 1887 |page=271 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m1RJAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA271 |accessdate=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; near [[Westminster]] to a site near [[Wroxeter]], where it split. The western continuation went on to [[Holyhead]] while the northern ran to [[Chester]] and on to [[Pictland|the Picts]] in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=English Villages |last=Ditchfield |first= Peter Hampson|authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1901 |publisher=Methuen |location=London |isbn= |page=33 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman===
The [[Ancient Romans|Romans]] began constructing [[Roman road|paved roads]] shortly after [[Roman conquest of Britain|their invasion]] in {{sc|ad}}&amp;nbsp;43. The London portion of Watling Street was rediscovered during [[Christopher Wren]]'s rebuilding of [[St Mary-le-Bow|St&amp;nbsp;Mary-le-Bow]] in 1671–73, following the [[Great Fire of London|Great Fire]]. Modern excavations date its construction to the winter from {{sc|ad}}&amp;nbsp;47 to 48. Around London, it was {{convert|7.5|-|8.7|m|abbr=on}} wide and paved with gravel. It was repeatedly redone, including at least twice before the sack of London by [[Boudica]]'s [[Boudica's Revolt|troops]] in 60 or 61.&lt;ref name=olo&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gbMkBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA41|page=41|title=The Origin of Roman London|last=Wallace|first=Lacey}}&lt;/ref&gt; The road ran straight from the bridgehead on the [[River Thames|Thames]]{{refn|Although it is possible the Romans used a ferry prior to the expansion of Londinium in the rebuilding following Boudica's sack of the city in the year 60 or 61.&lt;ref name=olo/&gt;}} to what would become [[Newgate]] on the [[London Wall]] before passing over [[Ludgate Hill]] and the [[River Fleet|Fleet]] and dividing into Watling Street and the [[Devil's Highway (Roman Britain)|Devil's Highway]] west to [[Calleva Atrebatum|Calleva]] ([[Silchester]]). Some of this route is preserved beneath [[Old Kent Road]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Margary|first=Ivan D.|title=Roman Ways in the Weald|publisher=J. M. Dent|location=London|year=1948|edition=third|pages=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2nd-century [[Antonine Itinerary]] gives the course of Watling Street from "[[Urioconium]]" (Wroxeter) to "[[Portus Ritupis]]" (Richborough) as a part of its Second Route (''{{lang|la|Iter II}}''), which runs for 501&amp;nbsp;[[Roman mile|MP]] from [[Hadrian's Wall]] to Richborough:&lt;ref name=ai&gt;[[s:la:Itinerarium Antonini Augusti|Itinerarium Antonini Augusti]].

====Battle====
{{main|Defeat of Boudica}}
Some site in the middle section of this route is supposed by most historians to have been the location of [[Gaius Suetonius Paulinus|G.&amp;nbsp;Suetonius Paulinus]]'s [[decisive victory]] over [[Boudica]]'s [[Iceni]] in {{sc|ad}}&amp;nbsp;61.

====Subsidiary routes====
The two routes of the [[Antonine Itinerary]] immediately following (''{{lang|la|Iter III}}'' &amp; ''{{lang|la|IV}}'') list the stations from Londinium to "[[Portus Dubris]]" ([[Dover]]) and to "[[Portus Lemanis]]" ([[Lympne]]) at the western edge of the [[Romney Marsh]], suggesting that they may have been considered interchangeable terminuses. They only differ in the distance to [[Durovernum]]: 14 and 17 [[Roman miles]], respectively.&lt;ref name=ai/&gt;&lt;ref name=ai2/&gt; The route to Lemanis was sometimes distinguished by the name {{nowrap|"Stone Street"}}; it now forms most of the B2068 road that runs from the [[M20 motorway]] to Canterbury. The route between Durovernum and the fortress and port at [[Regulbium]] ([[Reculver]]) on Kent's northern shore is not given in these itineraries but was also paved and is sometimes taken as a fourth terminus for Watling Street. The Sixth Route (''{{lang|la|Iter VI}}'') also recorded an alternate path stopping at [[Tripontio|Tripontium]] ([[Newton and Biggin]]) between [[Venonis]] ([[High Cross, Leicestershire|High Cross]]) and [[Bannaventa]] ([[Norton, Northamptonshire|Norton]]); it is listed as taking 24&amp;nbsp;[[Roman miles]] rather than 17.&lt;ref name=ai/&gt;&lt;ref name=ai2/&gt;

The more direct route north from [[Londinium]] (London) to [[Eboracum]] ([[York]]) was [[Ermine Street]]. The stations between Eboracum and [[Cataractonium]] ([[Catterick, North Yorkshire|Catterick]]) were shared with [[Dere Street]], which then branched off to the northeast. [[Durocobrivis]] ([[Dunstable]]) was the site of the path's intersection with the [[Icknield Way]]. The [[Maiden Way]] ran from [[Bravoniacum]] ([[Kirkby Thore]]) to the lead and silver mines at [[Epiacum]] ([[Whitley Castle]]) and on to [[Hadrian's Wall]].

===Saxon===
By the time of the [[Adventus Saxonum|Saxon invasions]], the Roman bridge across the Thames had presumably fallen into disrepair or been destroyed. The Saxons abandoned the walled Roman site in favour of [[Lundenwic]] to its west, presumably because of its more convenient access to the ford on the Thames. They did not return to [[Lundenburh]] (the [[City of London]]) until forced to do so by the [[Viking invasions of England|Vikings]] in the late 9th century. Over time, the graveling and paving itself fell into disrepair, although the road's course continued to be used in many places as a [[right of way (public throughway)|public right of way]]. "Watlingestrate" was one of the four roads {{nowrap|({{lang-la|chemini}})}} protected by the [[Anglo-Saxon law|king's peace]] in the [[Laws of Edward the Confessor]].&lt;ref name=haskill&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.earlyenglishlaws.ac.uk/laws/texts/ecf1/view/#edition,1_0_c_11_3/commentary,1_0_c_11_1|title=Early English Laws|chapter=Leges Edwardi Confessoris (ECf1), §12|publisher=University of London|location=London|date=2015|accessdate=20 February 2015 |language=la}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|The other three were "[[Fosse Way|Fosse]]", "[[Hikenildestrate]]" (Icknield Street), and "[[Herningestrate]]" (Ermine Street).&lt;ref name=haskill/&gt;}}

A number of Old English names testify to route of Watling Street at this time: [[Boughton Street]] in [[Kent]]; [[Colney Street]] in [[Hertfordshire]]; [[Fenny Stratford]] and [[Stony Stratford]] in [[Buckinghamshire]]; [[Old Stratford]] in Northamptonshire; [[Stretton under Fosse]] and [[Stretton Baskerville]] in [[Warwickshire]]; the three adjacent settlements of [[All Stretton]], [[Church Stretton]], and [[Little Stretton, Shropshire|Little Stretton]] in [[Shropshire]]; and [[Stretton Sugwas]] in [[Herefordshire]].

===Viking===
{{main|Danelaw}}
Following the [[Viking invasions of England|Viking invasions]], the 9th-century [[Treaty of Alfred and Guthrum]] mentions Watling Street as a boundary.

[[File:Map of London, 1300.svg|thumb|200px|Map of London around 1300 AD, showing Watling Street running north-west from [[London Bridge]] past [[Newgate]]]]

===Norman===
It is assumed that the pilgrims in [[Chaucer]]'s ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'' used the southeastern stretch of Watling Street when journeying from [[Southwark]] to [[Canterbury]].{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

[[File:Watling Street plaque Kilburn.jpg|thumb|200px|A paving stone on [[Kilburn, London|Kilburn]] High Road in London commemorates the route of Watling Street. (The date is incorrect.)]]

===Modernity===
{{hatnote|Main: [[Great Dover Road]], [[A2 road (Great Britain)|A2 Road]], and [[A5 road (Great Britain)|A5 Road]].}}
The first [[turnpike trust]] in England was established over Watling Street northwest of London by an Act of Parliament on 4 March 1707 in order to provide a return on the investment required to once more pave the road.&lt;ref name=holla&gt;{{cite web| title = House of Lords Journal|volume=18 | work = British History Online | publisher =University of London | url = http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=29521#s5 | accessdate =3 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The section from [[Fourne Hill]] north of [[Hockliffe]] to [[Stony Stratford]] was paved at a cost of [[Pound sterling|£]]7000{{efn|{{Inflation|UK|7000|1707|r=0|fmt=eq|cursign=£}} money.}} over the next two years. Revenue was below expectations; in 1709, the trust succeeded in getting a new act extending the term of their monopoly but not permitting their tolls to be increased. In 1711, the trust's debts had not been discharged and the creditors took over receivership of the tolls. In 1716, a new act restored the authority of the trust under the supervision of another group appointed by the Buckinghamshire justices of the peace. The trust failed to receive a further extension of their rights in 1736 and their authority ended at the close of 1738. In 1740, a new act named new trustees to oversee the road, which the residents of Buckinghamshire described as being "ruined".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Bogart | first = Dan | title = Evidence from Road and River Improvement Authorities, 1600–1750 | work = Political Institutions and the Emergence of Regulatory Commitment in England | publisher = University of California | year = 2007 | url = http://www.iisg.nl/hpw/papers/law-bogart.pdf |format=PDF | accessdate = 3 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The road was again paved in the early 19th century at the expense of [[Thomas Telford]]. He operated it as a turnpike road for [[British Post#History|mail coaches]] from [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland#Ireland|Ireland]]. To this purpose, he extended it to the port of [[Holyhead]] on [[Isle of Anglesey|Anglesey]] in Wales. During this time, the section southeast of London became known as the [[Great Dover Road]]. The tolls ended in 1875.

Much of the road is still in use today, apart from a few sections where it has been diverted. The [[A2 road (Great Britain)|A2]] road between Dover and London runs over or parallel to the old path. A section of Watling Street still exists in the [[City of London]] close to [[Mansion House underground station]] on the route of the original Roman road which traversed the [[River Thames]] via the first [[London Bridge]] and ran through the City in a straight line from London Bridge to [[Newgate]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.johnchaple.co.uk/watling.html Britain's hidden history – London's missing Roman road].&lt;/ref&gt; The sections of the road in Central London possess a variety of names, including [[Edgware Road]] and [[Maida Vale]]. At [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]], the Roman road ran along [[Old Dover Road]], turning and running through the area of present-day [[Greenwich Park]] to a location perhaps a little north of the current Deptford Bridge. The stretch between London and [[Shrewsbury]] (continuing to [[Holyhead]]) is known as the [[A5 road (Great Britain)|A5]]. Through [[Milton Keynes]], the A5 is diverted onto a new [[dual carriageway]] while Watling Street proper remains and forms part of the [[Milton Keynes grid road system]].

The name Watling Street is still used along the ancient road in many places, for instance in [[Bexleyheath]] in southeast London and in [[Canterbury]], [[Gillingham, Kent|Gillingham]], [[Strood]], [[Gravesend]], and [[Dartford]] in [[Kent]]. A major road joining the A5 in northwest London is called Watling Avenue. North of London, the name Watling Street still occurs in [[Hertfordshire]] (including [[St Albans]]), [[Bedfordshire]], Buckinghamshire (including [[Milton Keynes]]), [[Northamptonshire]] (including [[Towcester]]), [[Leicestershire]] ([[Hinckley]]), Warwickshire (including [[Nuneaton]] and [[Atherstone]]), [[Staffordshire]] (including [[Cannock]], [[Wall, Staffordshire|Wall]], [[Tamworth, Staffordshire|Tamworth]] and [[Lichfield]]), [[Shropshire]] (including in [[Church Stretton]] along the [[A49 road|A49]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/salop/vol10/pp72-120 Victoria County History - Shropshire A History of the County of Shropshire: Volume 10, Munslow Hundred (Part), the Liberty and Borough of Wenlock, Church Stretton]&lt;/ref&gt;  and even [[Gwynedd]] in north Wales.

==Other Watling Streets==
[[Dere Street]], the [[Roman roads in Britain|Roman road]] from [[Cataractonium]] ([[Catterick, North Yorkshire|Catterick]] in [[North Yorkshire|Yorkshire]]) to [[Corstopitum]] (now [[Corbridge]], [[Northumberland]]) to the [[Antonine Wall]], was also sometimes known as Watling Street. A third Watling Street was the Roman road from [[Mamucium]] ([[Manchester]]) to [[Bremetennacum]] ([[Ribchester]]) to [[Cumbria]]. [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]], [[Lancashire]], preserved a Watling Street Road between Ribbleton and [[Fulwood, Lancashire|Fulwood]], passing the Sharoe Green Hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bury.gov.uk/VisitorGuidesAndMaps/History.htm|title=Bury Metropolitan Council—History|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702214123/http://www.bury.gov.uk/VisitorGuidesAndMaps/History.htm|archivedate=2 July 2010|df=dmy-all}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these may preserve a separate derivation from the [[#Name|Old English ''wealhas'']] ("foreigner") or may have preserved the memory of the long Roman road while misattributing its upper stages to better-preserved roads.
