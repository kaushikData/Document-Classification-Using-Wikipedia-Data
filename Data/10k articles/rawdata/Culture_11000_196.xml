'''''A Candle for the Devil''''' ({{literal translation}} Spanish: '''''Una vela para el diablo'''''), also released as '''''It Happened at Nightmare Inn''''',{{sfn|Schlegel|2015|p=108}} is a 1973 Spanish horror film directed by [[Eugenio Martín]] and starring [[Aurora Bautista]] and [[Judy Geeson]]. Its plot follows two sisters in Spain, both suffering from extreme repression and religious paranoia, who murder a British guest at their inn just before her sister arrives to meet with her.

==Plot==
Middle-aged sisters Marta and Verónica run an inn in a [[Spain|Spanish]] village for travelers. May, a British guest, is sunbathing in the nude on the terrace, and is confronted by the sisters, whose religious convictions forbid such behavior. The three get into an argument, and May is pushed down a staircase and smashes through a glass window, which slashes her to death. As Marta and Verónica scramble to hide her body, her sister Laura arrives at the inn. Marta tells Laura that May checked out and paid her bill earlier that day. Laura decides to take a room until she can find May.

Helen Miller, an indecent woman by the sister's standards, checks in to the inn the following day, after which Verónica goes to visit Luis, with whom she is having an affair, and the two have sex. After, she confesses to Luis that Marta has discovered money missing, which she had given to Luis. Meanwhile, while strolling, Marta spies on several young men [[Nude swimming|skinny dipping]]. Later, when Helen returns to the inn late at night, she gets into an argument with Marta, who has forbidden that guests arrive back later than 11pm. Helen taunts Marta, who then stabs her to death.

The next morning, an American woman, Norma, arrives to stay at the inn with her infant child. Bothered by Helen's disappearance, Laura checks out of the inn and goes to stay in a different hotel. She goes to meet with a local police chief to tell him of her suspicions, and he reveals that Marta's fiancé had disappeared on their wedding day years before. Upon returning to the inn later that night after a brief meeting with Laura, Norma finds Marta and Verónica in the kitchen with her baby. Marta chastises Norma for being a single unmarried mother. Marta and Norma begin fighting, and Norma slaps her in the face several times; as Norma attempts to retrieve her baby from Verónica, Marta stabs her in the back, killing her. In Norma's belongings, Verónica discovers a letter from Norma to her husband about their pending divorce, revealing that Norma was in fact married. This leaves Verónica riddled with guilt, but Marta is unmoved.

Laura breaks into the inn that night to search for evidence implicating the sisters in the disappearances, and investigates large wine vats in the basement, but flees when the sisters hear her. The next day, Laura returns to the inn with a local man, Eduardo, posing as her husband who has just arrived, and rents a room. Marta is suspicious, believing she has seem the man before in town. Meanwhile, during a meal at the inn's restaurant, a woman falls violently ill with [[food poisoning]]; her husband notices an odd piece of meat on her plate, and he wraps it in a napkin to give to police. Late that night, Eduardo goes to investigate the inn's basement. In one of the vats, he finds pieces of flesh and bones floating in red wine, along with Norma's severed head. As he steps away from the vat, Marta stabs him to death. 

Meanwhile, at the local police station, it is determined that the piece of meat is in fact a chunk of flesh with an eyeball attached; the body part got mixed up after Laura used the same stick to probe the contents of the vats. While the police and a band of villagers head to the inn, Laura goes to search for Eduardo, and finds him dead in the sisters' bedroom. There, she is confronted by the two women, who bind and gag her. Laura flees downstairs with her hands tied, and attempts to find an unlocked door. The sisters corner a helpless Laura against a window. She opens the drapes, however, revealing the police and villages who witness the scene.

'''Amar sadh na mitilo''' ({{lang-bn|আমার সাধ না মিটিলো}}) is a [[Shyama Sangeet]] or more specifically a Kali Bhajan composed by [[Kamalakanta Bhattacharya (West Bengal)|Kamalakanta Bhattacharya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amar Sadh Na Mitilo by Pannalal Bhattacharya|url=http://www.priyadarshan.org/amar-sadh-na-mitilo-pannalal-bhattacharya-29.html|accessdate=10 October 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008164502/http://www.priyadarshan.org/amar-sadh-na-mitilo-pannalal-bhattacharya-29.html|archive-date=2011-10-08|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this song the poet indicates the futility of desire and explains the hardships he had gone through in order to get rid of the same. Also we see him dissatisfied by the lovelessness of the society and thus wants to escape this world and praying to [[Kali|Goddess Kali]] to give him shelter. [[Pannalal Bhattacharya]] was famous for singing this song.

মা 

আমার সাধ না মিটিল

আশা না পুরিল  

সকলি ফুরায়ে যায় মা 

আমার সাধ না মিটিল 

আশা না পুরিল সকলি ফুরায়ে যায় মা

জনমের শোধ ডাকি গো মা তোরে 

কোলে তুলে নিতে আই মা 

সকলি ফুরায়ে যায়  মা 

আমার সাধ না মিটিল

আশা না ফুরিল 

পৃথিবীর কেও ভালো তো বাসে না 

এ পৃথিবী ভালো বাসিতে জানে না

পৃথিবীর কেও ভালো তো বাসে না

এ পৃথিবী ভালো বাসিতে জানে না

যেথা আছে শুধু ভালোবাসাবাসি সেথা যেতে প্রাণ চাই মা

সকলি ফুরায়ে যায় মা

আমার সাধ না মিটিল আশা না পুরিল 

বড় দাগা পেয়ে বাসনা তেজেছি 

বড় জ্বালা শয়ে কামনা ভুলেছি 

বড় দাগা পেয়ে বাসনা তেজেছি

বড় সয়ে কামনা ভুলেছি

অনেক কেঁদেছি কাঁদিতে পারিনা

বুক ফেটে ভেঙ্গে যায় মা 

সকলি ফুরায়ে যায় মা

আমার সাধ না মিটিল আশা না পুরিল 

সকলি ফুরায়ে যায় মা 

জনমের শোধ ডাকে গো মা 

তোরে কোলে তুলে নিতে আই মা 

সকলি ফুরায়ে যায় মা 

আমার সাধ না মিটিল আশা না পুরিল

সকলি ফুরায়ে যায় মা

Shakali phuraye jay Ma.
Amar sadh na mitilo,

Janamer sadh daki go ma tore,
Kole tule nite aye Ma

In [[audio recording|audio]] and [[Sound recording and reproduction|recording]], what is known colloquially as an '''''anchor point''''' is a center position in a [[stereo mix]] reserved for only three or four important [[track (audio)|tracks]].&lt;ref name="Hodgson"&gt;Hodgson, Jay (2010). ''Understanding Records'', p. 165. {{ISBN|978-1-4411-5607-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Most modern [[pop music|pop]] productions are anchored by lead ([[lead vocals|vocals]] and [[solo (music)|soloing]] instruments), [[bass guitar|bass]], [[kick drum]], and [[snare drum]].&lt;ref name="Hodgson"/&gt; These are usually within a few degrees of center (horizontal) and front (proximity or depth) in the [[audio mixing (recorded music)|mix]].&lt;ref name="Hodgson"/&gt; Exceptions include early stereo recordings using "stereo-switching" (a three-way switch allowing only left output, right output, or both) rather than [[pan pot]]s&lt;ref&gt;Hodgson (2010), p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;) such as the [[The Beatles|Beatles]]'s "[[Strawberry Fields Forever]]" and [[Jimi Hendrix]]'s "[[Purple Haze]]".&lt;ref name="Hodgson"/&gt; Examples of tracks using anchor points include [[The Breeders]]'s "[[Cannonball (The Breeders song)|Cannonball]]", [[The Cure]]'s "[[Catch (The Cure song)|Catch]]", [[Lady Gaga]]'s "[[Just Dance (song)|Just Dance]]", [[Lily Allen]]'s "[[The Fear (Lily Allen song)|The Fear]]", [[Radiohead]]'s "[[OK Computer|Airbag]]", [[Squarepusher]]'s "[[Just a Souvenir|Star Time 2]]", [[Stone Roses]]'s "[[One Love (The Stone Roses song)|One Love]]", and [[Weezer]]'s "[[My Name Is Jonas]]".&lt;ref&gt;Hodgson (2010), p. 165–166.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28853">'''Asiacentrism''' (also '''Asiacentricity''') is an [[ethnocentric]] perspective that regards [[Asia]] to be either superior, central, or unique relative to other regions. This ideological stance can take the form of ascribing to Asia significance or supremacy at the cost of the rest of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ515544&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ515544 Asiacentrism and Asian American Studies?] - Retrieved 23 July 2013.{{unreliable source?|date=July 2014}}
Thomas Wier - [http://listserv.brown.edu/archives/cgi-bin/wa?A3=ind0401a&amp;L=CONLANG&amp;E=8bit&amp;P=47095&amp;B=--&amp;T=text%2Fplain;%20charset=ISO-8859-1&amp;header=1 Dept. of Linguistics]{{unreliable source?|date=July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The concept arose in the context of a projected [[Asian Century]], the expected economic and cultural dominance of Asia (primarily [[China]]) in the 21st century, in the 1990s.

== Asian American studies ==
Paul Wong, Meera Manvi, and Takeo Hirota Wong proposed "Asiacentrism" in the 1995 special issue of ''[[Amerasia Journal]]'' on "Thinking Theory in Asian American Studies." They envisioned Asiacentrism both as a critique of hegemonic [[Eurocentrism]] in theory building in the humanities and social sciences and as a post-Orientalist epistemological paradigm in Asian American Studies. There is a need to tap into Asian traditions of thought for analyzing Asian American behaviors and for advancing global knowledge in the human interest. The objective of an Asiacentric paradigm is not to recast and reiterate such antitheses as “static Asia” vs. “dynamic Europe” and the “mystic East” vs. the “scientific West,” but to explore a common core of Asian worldviews and values that overlap in their influence on particular regions, nations, and communities. In their view, Asiacentrism may be able to offer an alternative Asian perspective grounded in an awareness of the dynamics of a [[postcolonial]] world.&lt;ref name=Wong/&gt;{{rp|137–147}}

{{Quotation|It is possible to argue that Asian American Studies has, since its inception, permitted itself to be conceptually incarcerated in a hegemonic Eurocentric culture and world view. Not only is the English language serving as the ''lingua franca'' of Asian American Studies, but it is easily evident that many scholars in Asian American Studies do not regard the acquisition of at least one Asian language, as a second language, an important part of their training, thereby curtailing their communicative and research competence with the majority of Asian Americans, whose primary language is not English. While much scholarship has been devoted to "... present voices from our (Asian American) past which were never silent, but often ignored, minimalized, and marginalized by traditional historical accounts of the United States," there has been no serious attempt to contextualize this scholarship in what may be termed the "deep structure" of a shared Asiacentric perspective.&lt;ref name=Wong&gt;Paul Wong, Meera Manvi, and Takeo Hirota Wong, [http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ515544&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ515544 "Asiacentrism and Asian American Studies?,"] in Michael Omi and Dana Takagi (Eds.), Thinking Theory in Asian American Studies (Special Issue), ''Amerasia Journal'', Vol. 21, Nos. 1/2, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|140}}}}

Wong, Manvi, and Wong also submitted that Asiacentrism can be a paradigmatic way of integrating Asian American Studies and Asian Studies by acknowledging the colonial histories, recognizing the common interests, and recovering the cultural roots. They stressed that Asian American Studies should play an important role in decolonizing Asian Studies by interrogating its Eurocentric legacies.

{{Quotation|Scholars committed to the development of an Asiacentric paradigm face a challenge no less daunting than the Afrocentrists. The Euro-American colonial history in Asia has obviously left a deep imprint on Asian Studies Scholarship…. In theorizing about Asian cultures and societies, the Eurocentric view has only been subjected to serious critiques in recent decades. By proposing the development of an Asiacentric perspective, we are consciously suggesting that Asian American Studies also has a role to play in a field of Asian Studies stripped of its colonial legacy. Interestingly, the Pan-Africanists have always recognized the common interests and the unity of African American Studies and African Studies in decolonization and the recovery of roots.&lt;ref name=Wong/&gt;{{rp|145–146}}}}

== Communication studies ==
Yoshitaka Miike, Professor of Intercultural Communication at the [[University of Hawaii at Hilo]] and Past Chair of the International and Intercultural Communication Division of the [[National Communication Association]], is considered as the founding theorist of Asiacentricity in the discipline of communication.&lt;ref&gt;Shelton A.

Gunaratne, ''The Dao of the Press: An Humanocentric Theory'', Cresskill, NJ: Hampton Press, 2005, pp. 132–135.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert T. Craig and Heidi L.

Starosta and Guo-Ming Chen (Eds.), ''Ferment in the Intercultural Field: Axiology/Value/Praxis'' (''International and Intercultural Communication Annual'', Vol. 26), Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage, 2003, pp. 243–276.&lt;/ref&gt; He was later influenced by [[Maulana Karenga]]’s ''[[Kawaida]]'' philosophy,&lt;ref&gt;Maulana Karenga, ''Kawaida: A Communitarian African Philosophy'', Los Angeles, CA: University of Sankore Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maulana Karenga, "Philosophy in the African Tradition of Resistance: Issues of Human Freedom and Human Flourishing," in Lewis R.

Miike defined Asiacentricity as "the self-conscious act of centering Asian languages, religions/philosophies, histories, and aesthetics when addressing Asian people and phenomena." According to him, Asiacentricity "insists on revivifying and revitalizing diverse Asian cultural traditions as theoretical resources in order to capture Asians as subjects and actors of their own cultural realities rather than objects and spectators in the lived experiences of others."&lt;ref name="Yoshitaka Miike 2014"&gt;Yoshitaka Miike, "Asiacentricity," ''Key Concepts in Intercultural Dialogue'', No. 24, July 21, 2014, Washington, DC: Center for Intercultural Dialogue.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|Simply put, ''Asiacentricity'' is the idea of centering, not marginalizing, Asian languages, religions/philosophies, and histories in theory-making and storytelling about Asian communicative life. Asiacentricity aims to encourage careful and critical engagements of Asian communicators with their own cultural traditions for self-understanding, self-expression, communal development, and cross-cultural dialogue. Intraculturally, it helps Asians embrace the positive elements of their cultural heritage and transform negative practices according to their ethical ideals. Interculturally, it helps Asians find "a place to stand," so to speak, and provides the basis of equality and mutuality in the global community.&lt;ref&gt;Yoshitaka Miike, "Cultural Traditions and Communication Theory: Clarifying the Asiacentric Paradigm," ''China Media Research'', Vol. 8, No. 3, July 2012, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Borrowing from [[Daisetz Suzuki]]'s words, Miike stated that Asiacentricity is essentially "the idea of being deep and open," that is, the idea of being rooted in our own culture and, at the same time, open to other cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Yoshitaka Miike, "Asiacentricity: The Idea of Being Deep and Open," in Francesca Bargiela-Chiappini, Catherine Nickerson, and Brigitte Planken, ''Business Discourse'' (2nd Ed.), Basingstoke, UK: Palgrave Macmillan, 2013, pp. 57–58.&lt;/ref&gt; He differentiated Asiacentricity as a particularist position from Asiacentrism as a universalist ideology and maintained that Asiacentricity is a legitimate culture-centric approach to cultural Asia and people of Asian descent, while Asiacentrism is an ethnocentric approach to non-Asian worlds and people of non-Asian heritage. In Miike’s conceptualization, therefore, Asiacentrists are not cultural chauvinists and separatists.&lt;ref&gt;Yoshitaka Miike, "Asiacentricity," in Young Yun Kim (Ed.), ''The International Encyclopedia of Intercultural Communication'' (Vol. 1), Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2018, pp. 39–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|Asiacentricity is neither a hegemonic Asiacentrism nor an Asian version of ethnocentric Eurocentrism. Asiacentricity does not present the Asian worldview as the only universal frame of reference and impose it on non-Asians. Hence, Asiacentrists should be alert to Park's (2001) warning: "An idea is not good merely because it is old or because it is new. It is not necessarily good because it is an Eastern idea or a Western idea, or just because it is ours" (p. 8). Asiacentrists thus should not deny the value of other non-Asiacentric perspectives on Asians. Nevertheless, they must reject the hegemonic ideology that non-Asiacentric theoretical standpoints are superior to Asiacentric ones and therefore can grossly neglect the latter in the discussion and discourse surrounding Asian people and phenomena. They must reject the hegemonic ideology that the Asian version of humanity can be judged solely from the Eurocentric vision of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Yoshitaka Miike, "Rethinking Humanity, Culture, and Communication: Asiacentric Critiques and Contributions," ''Human Communication: A Journal of the Pacific and Asian Communication Association'', Vol. 7, No. 1, Winter 2004, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Miike identified six dimensions of Asiacentricity: (1) an assertion of Asians as subjects and agents; (2) the centrality of the collective and humanistic interests of Asia and Asians in the process of knowledge reconstruction about the Asian world; (3) the placement of Asian cultural values and ideals at the center of inquiry into Asian thought and action; (4) the groundedness in Asian historical experiences; (5) an Asian theoretical orientation to data; and (6) an Asian ethical critique and corrective of the dislocation and displacement of Asian people and phenomena.&lt;ref name=Miike1&gt;Yoshitaka Miike, "An Anatomy of Eurocentrism in Communication Scholarship: The Role of Asiacentricity in De-Westernizing Theory and Research," ''China Media Research'', Vol. 6, No. 1, January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}}

In Miike’s comprehensive outline, Asiacentricity (1) generates theoretical knowledge that corresponds to Asian communication discourse, (2) focuses on the multiplicity and complexity of Asian communicative experience, (3) reflexively constitutes and critically transforms Asian communication discourse, (4) theorizes how common aspects of humanity are expressed and understood in Asian cultural particularities, and (5) critiques Eurocentric biases in theory and research and helps Asian researchers overcome academic dependency.&lt;ref name=Miike1/&gt;{{rp|5–7}}

Miike's contention is that there has been the established hierarchical relationship between "Western theories" and "non-Western texts" in Eurocentric scholarship, where non-Western cultures remain as peripheral targets of data analysis and rhetorical criticism and fail to emerge as central resources of theoretical insight and humanistic inspiration. Miike thus insisted that Asiacentric scholarship reconsider Asian cultures as "theories for knowledge reconstruction," not as "texts for knowledge deconstruction." Such an Asiacentric approach, according to him, would make it possible for both Asian and non-Asian researchers to theorize as Asians speak in Asian languages, as Asians are influenced by Asian religious-philosophical worldviews, as Asians struggle to live in Asian historical experiences, and as Asians feel ethically good and aesthetically beautiful.&lt;ref&gt;Yoshitaka Miike, "The Asiacentric Turn in Asian Communication Studies: Shifting Paradigms and Changing Perspectives," in Molefi Kete Asante, Yoshitaka Miike, and Jing Yin (Eds.), ''The Global Intercultural Communication Reader'' (2nd Ed.), New York, NY: Routledge, 2014, pp. 116–117.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|For the purpose of elucidating the psychology of Asian communicators and enunciating the dynamics of Asian communication, therefore, Asiacentrists ought to revalorize (a) Asian words as key concepts and their etymologies as cultural outlooks and instructive insights, (b) Asian religious-philosophical teachings as behavioral principles and codes of ethics, (c) Asian histories as multiple layers of contextualization and recurrent patterns of continuity and change, and (d) Asian aesthetics as analytical frameworks for space-time arrangement, nonverbal performance, and emotional pleasure.&lt;ref&gt;Yoshitaka Miike, "Asiacentricity," in Klaus Bruhn Jensen and Robert T. Craig (Eds.), ''The International Encyclopedia of Communication Theory and Philosophy'' (Vol. 1), West Sussex, UK: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2016, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Miike also synthesized a large body of literature in the field of Asian communication theory while paying homage to such pioneers as [[Anantha Babbili]], Guo-Ming Chen, Godwin C. Chu, Wimal Dissanayake,&lt;ref&gt;Wimal Dissanayake (Ed.), ''Communication Theory: The Asian Perspective'', Singapore: Asian Mass Communication Research and Information Center, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; [[D.

Nakayama and Rona Tamiko Halualani (Eds.), ''The Handbook of Critical Intercultural Communication'', Malden, MA: Wiley-Blackwell, 2010, pp. 195–196.&lt;/ref&gt; In his opinion, five types of alternative non-Eurocentric comparisons can enlarge the theoretical horizons of Asian communication research: (1) continent-diaspora comparisons; (2) within-region comparisons; (3) between-region comparisons; (4) diachronic comparisons; and (5) co-cultural domestic comparisons.&lt;ref&gt;Yoshitaka Miike, "Asian Communication Studies at the Crossroads: A View to the Future from an Asiacentric Framework," ''Journal of Content, Community, and Communication'', Vol. 3, June 2016, pp. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|Asiacentric studies of South Asia, Southeast Asia, and West Asia are underrepresented in the current literature. These regions are at the crossroads of Asian civilizations, offering rich historical insights into Asian intercultural exchanges and multicultural co-existence.

Miike recently applied Asiacentricity and formulated five principles of intercultural communication ethics: (1) the principle of recognition and respect; (2) the principle of reaffirmation and renewal; (3) the principle of identification and indebtedness; (4) the principle of ecology and sustainability; and (5) the principle of rootedness and openness.&lt;ref&gt;Yoshitaka Miike, "Between Conflict and Harmony in the Human Family: Asiacentricity and Its Ethical Imperative for Intercultural Communication," in Xiaodong Dai and Guo-Ming Chen (Eds.), ''Conflict Management and Intercultural Communication: The Art of Intercultural Harmony,'' London, UK: Routledge, 2017, pp. 45–57.&lt;/ref&gt; He reiterated that "Asiacentricity does not implicitly suggest that non-Asiacentric standpoints are always incompatible with, or different from, Asiacentric viewpoints," and noted that "the five ethical principles from the ideas and insights rooted in Asian cultural traditions and leave open the possibility that [his] Asiacentric perspective may converge to, and diverge from, other Asiacentric and non-Asiacentric ones."&lt;ref&gt;Yoshitaka Miike, "Between Conflict and Harmony in the Human Family: Asiacentricity and Its Ethical Imperative for Intercultural Communication," in Xiaodong Dai and Guo-Ming Chen (Eds.), ''Conflict Management and Intercultural Communication: The Art of Intercultural Harmony,'' London, UK: Routledge, 2017, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Asiacentric feminism ==
Jing Yin, Professor of International Communication at the University of Hawaii at Hilo, explored the possibility of constructing an Asiacentric feminist theory in the 2009 special issue of the ''[[Journal of Multicultural Discourses]]'' on "New Frontiers in Asian Communication Theory." She argued that Eurocentric [[feminism]] often reduces the richness and complexities of non-Western cultural traditions to gender oppression alone. She postulated that the Asiacentric feminist approach commends the complementarity of genders, embraces the harmony of the individual and the community, and endorses the dialectics of rights and responsibilities.&lt;ref name=Yin&gt;Jing Yin, "Negotiating the Center: Towards an Asiacentric Feminist Communication Theory," in Yoshitaka Miike (Ed.), New Frontiers in Asian Communication Theory (Special Issue), ''Journal of Multicultural Discourses'', Vol. 4, No. 1, March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|75–88}}

{{Quotation|Western feminists often presume that non-Western cultures are primary source of repression. Attention is often paid to particular cultural practices that are deemed unusually brutal and inhumane, such as the veil in the Arab world, foot binding in feudal China, and ''sati'' (widow cremation) in India. Although there is no denying that these practices are suppressive, the equation of gender oppression in non-Western cultures with those cultures themselves is problematic... . Rather than viewing non-Western cultures completely oppressive, a more productive way of conceptualizing non-Western feminism movements may lie in a thorough re-intervention into, and refinement of, those non-Western cultural traditions in dynamic and complex relations with other cultures.&lt;ref name=Yin/&gt;{{rp|75–76}}}}

Yin observed that theorizing in Eurocentric feminism including postmodern and postcolonial feminism is a continuation of, rather than a rupture with, individualist assumptions and rights consciousness. The Eurocentric ontology based on individualism prevents a non-anthropocentric theorization of rights in which the individual embraces and strengthens interdependent relationships with other beings and nature because rights is narrowly conceived in terms of individual choices of employment, political participation, and personal recognition.&lt;ref name=Yin/&gt;{{rp|77–78}}

According to Yin, Asiacentric feminism does not ignore the contributions of Western feminisms, but Eurocentric feminism should not be the only viable way for women’s emancipation and empowerment regardless of cultural locations and contexts because, if she or he is displaced from one’s own cultural roots, a person loses sight of where she or her is currently situated and thus finds it difficult to achieve the desired destination.

Yin asserted that the Asiacentric feminist project should be a political project of human freedom and flourishing based on a vision of holistic humanism with deep sensitivity to women's conditions in Asian cultures. Special attention should be given to (1) interpersonal and group communication and family and social relationships among Asian women in domestic spaces and (2) all female performing arts in Asia and domestic work as creative expressions of Asian women's experiences.&lt;ref name=Yin/&gt;{{rp|84–85}}

== Asante on Asiacentricity ==
Asante made positive comments on the Asiacentric efforts of both Wong, Manvi, and Wong in the 1990s and Miike and Yin in the 2000s. In the revised edition of ''The Afrocentric Idea'', referring to Wong, Manvi, and Wong, Asante wrote: "I have been very gratified that educators were quick to see its [the Afrocentric idea's] implications for developing curricula that can empower students of all cultures; one group of scholars even proposes using it to develop an 'Asiacentric' perspective for Asian American Studies."&lt;ref&gt;Molefi Kete Asante, ''The Afrocentric Idea'' (Rev. Ed.), Philadelphia, PA: Temple University Press, 1998, p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt;

As for Miike and Yin, in ''An Afrocentric Manifesto'', Asante remarked: "The original work of Yoshitaka Miike on Asiacentric communication is instructive. Miike, alongside Jing Yin, has articulated a view of Asian culture that seeks to liberate the discourse around Asian communication ideas and rhetorical concepts away from being forced into the straitjacket of Western ideas. This is a remarkable undertaking that will have far-reaching effect on the course of social science and humanities discussions about culture."&lt;ref&gt;Molefi Kete Asante, ''An Afrocentric Manifesto: Toward an African Renaissance'', Cambridge, UK: Polity Press, 2007, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Babel-17''''' is a 1966 [[science fiction]] novel by American writer [[Samuel R. Delany]] in which the [[Linguistic relativity|Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]] (that language influences thought and perception) plays an important part. It was joint winner of the [[Nebula Award for Best Novel]] in 1967 (with ''[[Flowers for Algernon]]'')&lt;ref name="WWE-1966"&gt;{{cite web

Delany hoped to have ''Babel-17'' originally published as a single volume with the novella ''[[Empire Star]]'', but this did not happen until a 2001 reprint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Delany|first1=Samuel R.|title=Babel-17 / Empire Star|date=December 2001|publisher=Vintage Books / Random House|isbn=0-375-70669-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==

During an interstellar war one side develops a language, ''Babel-17'', that can be used as a weapon.  Learning it turns one into an unwilling traitor as it alters perception and thought. The change is made more dangerous by the language's seductive enhancement of other abilities.  This is discovered by the beautiful star-ship captain, linguist, poet, and telepath Rydra Wong. She is recruited by her government to discover how the enemy are infiltrating and sabotaging strategic sites. Initially Babel-17 is thought to be a code used by enemy agents. Rydra Wong realizes it is a language and during her journey, has a traitor on the ship. Rydra later finds herself becoming the traitor as she learns more about Babel-17.  She is rescued by her dedicated crew, figures out the danger, and neutralizes its effects.

The novel deals with several issues related to the peculiarities of language, how conditions of life shape the formation of words and meaning, and how the words themselves can shape the actions of people.

==Language==
The language portrayed at the center of ''Babel-17'' contains interesting linguistic features including the absence of a pronoun or any other construction for "I". The heroine finds her perceptions (and even her physical abilities) altered once she has learned Babel-17. In this Delany's novel influenced a generation of writers: ''[[Native Tongue (Suzette Haden Elgin novel)|Native Tongue]]'' by [[Suzette Haden Elgin]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}, ''[[The Dispossessed]]'' by [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}, ''[[Embassytown]]'' by [[China Miéville]], "In Luna Bore Coda" by Joshua Nilles, and, more evidently, the short story "[[Story of Your Life]]" by [[Ted Chiang]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}. It also resembles a few preceding science fiction novels which deal with how languages shape the political and cultural stratum of societies, such as ''[[The Languages of Pao]]'' by [[Jack Vance]] or ''[[Anthem (novella)|Anthem]]'' by [[Ayn Rand]], and language as a weapon was adapted as a plot device in [[Neal Stephenson]]'s ''[[Snow Crash]]''.

==Other media==
In 2014, the work ''Babel-17'' was told in tandem with a partial biography of Samuel R. Delany's early years in the form of a play ''The Motion of Light in Water'', based on a 1988 autobiography with the same title, produced by Elbow Room, an Australian theatre company directed by Marcel Dorney.

'''''Blessed Unrest: How the Largest Movement in the World Came into Being and Why No One Saw It Coming''''' is a 2007 [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' bestseller]]&lt;ref name=ecos/&gt; by [[Paul Hawken]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Hawken (2007). ''Blessed Unrest: How the Largest Movement in the World Came into Being and Why No One Saw It Coming''. Viking Press. {{ISBN|978-0-670-03852-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The book is about the many non-profit groups and community organizations, dedicated to many different causes, which Hawken calls the "environmental and social justice movement".&lt;ref&gt;James M. Sheehan. [http://www.ejsd.org/docs/REVIEW_OF_BLESSED_UNREST.pdf Blessed unrest: how the largest movement in the world came into being and why no one saw it coming (book review)]  ''The Electronic Journal of Sustainable Development'', (2008) 1(2), p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Hawken explains that this is a diverse movement with no charismatic leader. The movement follows no unifying ideology, and is not recognized by politicians, the public and the media. But, Hawken argues, it has the potential to benefit the planet.&lt;ref name=ecos&gt;[http://www.publish.csiro.au/?act=view_file&amp;file_id=EC145p8.pdf Healing by the community spirit] ''[[ECOS (CSIRO magazine)|ECOS]]'', Oct-Nov 2008, pp. 145-146.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
A ''New York Times'' reviewer states that ''Blessed Unrest'' is "about a movement that no one has noticed, not even the people involved". For this reviewer, the "high point of the book is Hawken's excellent critique of the chemical industry's attack on [[Rachel Carson]]'s ''[[Silent Spring]]'' in 1962", at a time when she was fighting cancer.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Sullivan. [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/05/books/review/Sullivan-t.html Grass Roots Rising] ''The New York Times'', August 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Hawken also tells the stories of other people who have endured hardship and difficulty as they stood up to large corporations.&lt;ref name=ecos/&gt;

[[Silver]] was important in [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] society as it was the most precious metal right after [[gold]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cormack|first1=Robin|title=Byzantium Art|date=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-284211-4|pages=63–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Byzantine silver''' was prized in both the secular and domestic realms. Aristocratic homes had silver dining ware, and in churches silver was used for crosses, liturgical vessels such as the [[paten]]s and [[chalice]]s required for every [[Eucharist]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Silver was also used as a medium in pagan mythological scenes and objects such as the [[Sevso Treasure]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Silver pieces, especially [[Household silver|silver]]ware, continued to be rendered in the classical style into the seventh century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  
[[File:The_Antioch_Chalice,_first_half_of_6th_century,_Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art.jpg|The [[Antioch Chalice]]. Created during the first half of the sixth century.  [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York.|frame]]Silver items were also controlled stamped, sometimes up to five times on a single piece, many such pieces are dated between the fourth and eighth centuries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During the reign of [[Heraclius]] (r. 610-41 AD), the production of silverware halts, which coincides with the State confiscating valuable metals to help replenish the treasury during the [[Greco-Persian Wars|Persian War]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Silver items began to regularly buried, such as the [[Kaper Koraon Treasure|Stuma Treasure]] of 56 objects found in Syria during 1908, dated between 540 and 640 and attributed to the village church of [[Sergius and Bacchus|St Sergios]] at Kaper Koraon.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Sion Treasure from Lycia consists of 71 pieces with 30 pieces stamped between 550 and 565 AD &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; See [[Byzantine coinage|Byzantine Coins]] for currency and monetary information.

== Bowls ==

[[File:Byzantine_-_Silver_Cup_-_Walters_57631.jpg|left|thumb|This bowl, which could have been used for hand washing or baptism.  [[Walters Art Museum]], Baltimore, Maryland.]]
During the nineteenth century two silver bowls were discovered in Estonia that date to the late fifth or early sixth century period of which the Byzantine Emperor [[Anastasius I Dicorus|Anastasius I]] reigned 491-518 AD.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Quast, Tamla|first1=Dieter, Ulle|title=Two Fifth Century Ad Byzantine Silver Bowls from Estonia|journal=Estonian Journal of Archeology|date=2010|volume=14.2|issue=December|pages=99–101}}&lt;/ref&gt; The silver bowl deemed the “Kriimani” bowl, for the location in which it was found, has a rim of 15.5&amp;nbsp;cm with a height of 9&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Two beaded bands border the rim of the bowl. Silver analysis shows 93-95% Silver, 3.5-5% Copper, and traces of Gold and Platinum.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The second bowl, referred to as the “Varnja Bowl,” was discovered in 1895 near the village of Varnja.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Varnja bowl also has two beaded bands that circle the rim, and it is also stamped similar to the Kriimani  bowl.

== Crosses ==

Crosses were also lavishly adorned with precious materials and biblical scenes during the Byzantine period. Scholars refer to a cross called “The Work of Mark,” due to the monks inscriptions on the cross.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hetherington|first1=Paul|title=The Work of Mark|journal=Apollo|date=2010|issue=March|pages=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cross is dated at late tenth or early eleventh century.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This cross is 47&amp;nbsp;cm high, 26&amp;nbsp;cm wide, and very ornamented meaning it was probably used in processions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The iron core of the cross is encased in silver. Points projecting from the four arms of the cross would all have had small silver-gilt balls, which can be seen on other such crosses.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Traces of gilding where the balls would have been provide further evidence. On one side across the central arm are three roundels forming a deesis, which shows [[Jesus|Christ]] as a central figure holding a book of gospels in his left hand and blessing with his right.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] is shown bowing on Christ’s left while [[St John the Baptist]] bows on his right &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The roundel on the top arm portrays the Archangel Michael, while the bottom roundel portrays a figure titled [[Theodore the Martyr|St Theodore]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This side is heavily embossed with silver-gilt, and has a vine scroll and beaded border.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The reverse side does not have such borders.

The reverse has a black medium used in conjunction with the partial gilding of niello, which is an enamel type substance, in this case mixed with sulphur and silver.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The roundels portray saints with the top of the cross showing the evangelist St John Theologos. The arm roundels show [[St Peter]] on the left and [[St Paul]] on the right.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The fourth roundel shows [[St Basil]] in bishops robes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The middle of the scene has Virgin Mary and her child with a standing portrait of [[St Constantine, Thorpe Constantine|St Constantine]] above them decorated in his robe.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The Virgin Mary has [[St Demetrius]] on the left, St Procopius on her right, and the last saint shown is St Nikitas.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; All saints are identified by the engraving of their names above them. An inscription of a semicircular area just 3&amp;nbsp;cm wide and embedded into the front of the cross, before the tang projects, reads “‘The work of the Faithful Mark’” &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
	 
Similar crosses are known of such as the cross of Adrianople. This cross has frontal images of Christ and the Virgin Mary, along with archangels [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] and [[Gabriel]] on the cross arms.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The reverse side shows church fathers, and the donor’s name is inscribed as [[Sisinnios Triphyllios|Sisinnios]], which dates the cross to the final years of the tenth century.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

Another cross, in the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]], is dated to the eleventh century due to its comparison of portraits with imperial portraits on coins and seal of that time.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Distribution of silver-gilt relief decoration and niello are the same on both sides.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Plates ==
Silver pieces, and especially plates, such as the [[Missorium of Theodosius I]] of 338 AD are engraved and styled similary to the set of nine plates showing the Life of [[King David|David]] stamped between 613 and 630 AD.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Kaiseraugst [[Achilles]] Plate has the closest similarity to the [[David Plates]] in regards to late antique silver.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leader|first1=Ruth|title=The David Plates Revisited: Transforming the Secular in Early Byzantium|journal=Art Bulletin|date=2000|volume=82|issue=September|pages=421–422}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Achilles Plate was buried with a large hoard of domestic silver during the fourth century inside the walls of the Rhine frontier fort of [[Agusta Rarica]], which was discovered in the early 1960s.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The Achiles Plate has the signature of Pausylyps of [[Thessalanike]] which places its manufacturing in the eastern Byzantine empire.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This is reinforced with the similar control stamps on the David Plates.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The large octagonal plate has decoration around its rim, and in the center a medallion shows a series of scenes of Achilles’ life before the [[Trojan War]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The Achilles Plate shows a narrative of eleven scenes on one plate.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The David Plates and the Achilles Plate show a tradition of late antique silver working that produced many objects between the fourth and seventh centuries with scenes from traditional Grecco-Roman mythology.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The David Plates and Achilles Plate are very decorative, and would have been used as show pieces.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''''Canaan Hymns''''' or '''''Songs of Canaan''''' ({{lang-zh|c=迦南诗选|p=Jiānán Shīxuǎn}}{{sfn|Starr|2016|p=28}}&lt;ref name="Zhou2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Zhou|first=Kate|title=China's Long March to Freedom: Grassroots Modernization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CvzebFwWRAcC&amp;pg=PA141|year=2011|publisher=Transaction Publishers|location=New Brunswick|isbn=978-1-4128-1520-8|page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Strandenæs|2008|p=156}}) is a collection of [[China|Chinese]] hymns composed by [[Lu Xiaomin|Lü Xiaomin]], a Christian convert peasant woman with no musical education. She proved to be a prolific song writer after starting to write hymns in 1990. {{As of|2016|02}}, she has written 1,682 Canaan hymns. Xiaomin's [[Christian theology|theologically]] background is in [[Pentecostalism]] and the [[Local churches (affiliation)|local churches movement]], and the hymns reflect themes of [[Christology]], [[Pneumatology (Christianity)|pneumatology]] and [[Christian eschatology|eschatology]] against the backdrop of Chinese political realities.

Canaan hymns are one of the most successful underground Christian publication in China. They are used by many Protestant churches in the country. Both [[Chinese house churches]] and churches of the [[Three-Self Patriotic Movement]] use them, despite the latter having criticized the hymns through its official channels. The [[Chinese government]] has targeted censorship efforts on the distributors of the hymnal. [[Overseas Chinese]] communities and [[Taiwan]]ese churches use the hymnal, too.

Even people with little education can learn the hymns, which are short and musically simple, usually rhymed, and resemble [[Chinese folk songs]]. This has contributed to their popularity. The can also be sung without instruments. Their Chinese elements and [[Confucian]] undertones make them more acceptable than foreign hymnals to Chinese worshipers. There is a strong emphasis on the communal aspects of the Christian church. Some hymns are patriotic.

==History==
[[Lu Xiaomin|Lü Xiaomin]] ({{lang-zh|c=吕小敏|p=Lǔ Xiǎo Mǐn}};{{sfn|Starr|2016|p=28}}{{sfn|Strandenæs|2008|p=157}} also known as Sister Ruth{{sfn|Aikman|2012|p=108}}) was born in 1970 to a family of peasants belonging to the [[Hui people|Hui]] minority.{{sfn|Starr|2016|p=356}}{{sfn|Aikman|2012|p=108}} She grew up in [[Fangcheng County|Fangcheng]], [[Nanyang, Henan|Nanyang]], [[Henan Province]].&lt;ref name="Hawn2015"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hawn|first=C. Michael|editor-last=Brunn|editor-first=Stanley D.|title=The Changing World Religion Map: Sacred Places, Identities, Practices and Politics|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CGh-BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA2665|date=2015|publisher=Springer|location=Dordrecht|isbn=978-94-017-9376-6|page=2665|chapter=Landscapes and Soudscapes: How Place Shapes Christian Congregational Song}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Xiaomin dropped out of education after elementary school because of her failing health. Because the Hui are China's largest [[Muslim]] community, she was initially unfamiliar with Christianity.{{sfn|Aikman|2012|p=108}} Her aunt, who had converted to Christianity, introduced her to the faith.{{sfn|Aikman|2012|pp=108–109}} After praying, her health condition, [[sinusitis]] and a stomach disease, were gone.&lt;ref name="Wang2016"/&gt; Xiaomin joined a house church in 1989, at the age of 19,{{sfn|Aikman|2012|p=109}} taking the [[christian name]] "Sister Ruth".{{sfn|Aikman|2012|p=108}} Her spiritual roots are in [[Pentecostalism]] and [[Local churches (affiliation)|the local churches movement]].{{sfn|Starr|2016|p=355}}

In 1990, she started composing hymns.{{sfn|Starr|2016|p=356}}{{sfn|The Canaan Hymns|2003|loc=14:00}} The first hymn came to her mind one night after church service when she could not sleep.{{sfn|Aikman|2012|p=109}} According to Xiaomin: "The Holy Spirit touched me the moment I consecrated myself to God. That's when I sang my first hymn."{{sfn|The Canaan Hymns|2003|loc=14:00}} Shy as she was, she only sang the song to a girl in her home village. The girl relayed the hymn to her parents, Christians who attributed Xiaomin's sudden musical abilities to the work of the [[Holy Spirit]]. By the time that word about Xiaomin's song had reached a fellow Christian with a tape recorder, she had already written 23 hymns. All of them were taped and marked down in [[Chinese musical notation]]. Soon all of the local congregations were using the hymnal and traveling evangelists took it all over China.{{sfn|Aikman|2012|p=109}}

Xiaomin continued to compose new hymns, one every two or three days.{{sfn|Aikman|2012|p=110}} During the next decade of her life, she would write some 700 of them while evangelizing in the countryside of Henan.{{sfn|Starr|2016|pp=355–356}} During this period, she was detained at least twice for her religious activities.{{sfn|Starr|2016|p=356}} The first arrest took place in September 1992 in Fangcheng after she had written 50 songs.{{sfn|Aikman|2012|p=110}}{{sfn|The Canaan Hymns|2003|loc=31:00}} During her 67-day detention, she composed 14 additional hymns and her seven non-Christian cellmates had become converted to Christianity.{{sfn|Aikman|2012|p=110}} The other arrest came after a 1998 re-interpretation of the illegal publications clause of the [[Constitution of China]].&lt;ref name="Zhou2011"/&gt; By the year 2000, the hymnal consisted of some 720 songs.{{sfn|Aikman|2012|p=110}}

[[Overseas Chinese]] communities use them as well.{{sfn|Strandenæs|2008|p=156}}

Canaan hymns are one of the most successful underground Christian publication in China.&lt;ref name="Zhou2011"/&gt; They are predominantly used in the [[House church (China)|Chinese house churches]], where they are considered its "official hymnal". They also see use in the government-sanctioned [[Three-Self Patriotic Movement]] churches.{{sfn|Neeley|2016|p=591}} Through its official channels, the Three-Self Patriotic Movement has criticized the hymns. A 1999 issue of its ''[[Tian Feng (magazine)|Tian Feng]]'' magazine scrutinized the hymn 195, "Lord, Have Mercy on China, Hold Back Your Anger", in particular for questioning the Movement's view of Christianity in service of Chinese socialism.{{sfn|Aikman|2012|p=110}} The government has targeted publishers and distributors of the hymnal.&lt;ref name="Zhou2011"/&gt;

Neither Xiaomin nor anyone in her family has any formal musical training.{{sfn|Aikman|2012|p=109}} She does not know how to write either Western or Chinese musical notation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = You Are the Light of the World, Song for Preachers, Created by China's Songbird, Lv [sic] Xiao Min | last = Wang| first = Ruth | work = China Christian Daily | date = 15 December 2015 | accessdate = 13 February 2017 | url = http://chinachristiandaily.com/2015-12-15/ministry/you-are-the-light-of-the-world--song-for-preachers--created-by-china-s-songbird--lv-xiao-min_349.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, her hymns spread mainly orally, but they have since begun to be transcribed by others.&lt;ref name="Hawn2015"/&gt; Orchestral adaptations of the hymns have made Xiamin famous overseas as well.{{sfn|Starr|2016|p=356}} Her life story and the hymns are inseparable in publicity, reflecting a holiness [[Christian theology|theology]] on part of the movement.{{sfn|Starr|2016|p=355}} Described as "profoundly modest" despite her fame in China, Xiaomin spends much time traveling around the country.{{sfn|Aikman|2012|p=111}} Her music is publicized by [[Chinese American]] backers in particular.{{sfn|Starr|2016|p=355}}

The 2012 Chinese film ''[[Back to 1942]]'' featured the Canaan hymn "The River of Life" as its theme song. The hymn "I Love My Home" has also appeared on [[China Central Television]],{{sfn|The Canaan Hymns|2003|loc=44:00}}{{sfn|Golf|2013|p=164}} sung by a Christian family,{{sfn|The Canaan Hymns|2003|loc=44:00}} despite the channel's reputation as propaganda of the officially atheist state.{{sfn|Golf|2013|pp=28, 163}}

Many Chinese regard the Canaan hymns a gift from God.&lt;ref name="Hawn2015"/&gt; Chinese Christians have attributed miraculous healings to those singing the hymns.{{sfn|Aikman|2012|p=110}}

The Canaan hymns are short,{{sfn|Strandenæs|2008|p=156}} [[pentatonic]] and resemble [[Chinese folk music|Chinese folk songs]].{{sfn|Neeley|2016|pp=591–592}} Many, but not all, are rhymed. Few have verses or refrains. There are many allusions to nature and the weather.{{sfn|Starr|2016|p=357}} They are "genuinely inculturated hymns, with a folk lilt, Chinese harmonics, and an imagery that blends rural China with biblical themes".{{sfn|Starr|2016|p=356}} The spontaneity of the hymns reflect the process that Xiaomin uses to compose her hymns: she develops songs based on [[Bible verses]] that come to her mind while praying, as a plea to a local need or as thanks.{{sfn|Starr|2016|p=357}} Conceiving a new hymn can take as little as five to ten minutes.&lt;ref name="Hawn2015"/&gt; The songs are simple, "a few lines of doxology or lament";{{sfn|Starr|2016|p=357}} the figures of speech used are everyday and rural.{{sfn|Starr|2016|p=358}} The songs are easier to learn than those featured in the ''[[Chinese New Hymnal]]'', the official hymnal of the state-controlled [[China Christian Council]]. Even uneducated and illiterate people can grasp the Canaan hymns, which has contributed to their popularity.{{sfn|Strandenæs|2008|p=156}} They can be sung without instrumentation,{{sfn|The Canaan Hymns|2003|loc=4:00}} and are sung in church, at home gatherings, and when alone.{{sfn|Strandenæs|2008|p=156}}

The songs are [[Christology|Christologically]] and [[Pneumatology (Christianity)|pneumatologically]] focused, even if most of the Biblical references are to the [[Old Testament]], especially the [[Book of Psalms]].{{sfn|Starr|2016|p=358}} The lyrics of the hymns are theologically mindful of a tension between China's political realities and aspirations of Chinese Christians. These thoughts are reflected on the [[Second Coming]] of [[Jesus]] and there is a strong [[Christian eschatology|eschatological]] current.{{sfn|Starr|2016|p=359}} Early hymns in particular focused on the theme of overcoming hardships.{{sfn|Starr|2016|p=357}} The hymnody reflects a kind of "enduring acceptance of state persecution."{{sfn|Starr|2016|p=355}}

Their Chinese elements and [[Confucian]] undertones make them more acceptable than foreign hymnals to Chinese audiences.{{sfn|Neeley|2016|pp=591–592}} There is a strong emphasis on the communal aspects of the Christian church. Some hymns, such as "Chinese Heart" and "The Chinese shall Rise", are markedly patriotic.{{sfn|Strandenæs|2008|pp=157–158}} Canaan hymns also exhibit the "Three self principles" that are central to Chinese Protestantism, "self-governance, self-reliance, and self-propagation", often supplemented with a fourth one: "ingeniousness".{{sfn|Strandenæs|2008|p=158}} These aspects make Canaan hymns compatible with government-sanctioned Christianity.{{sfn|Starr|2016|p=358}} Some have the air of [[work song]]s,{{sfn|Starr|2016|pp=357–358}} and even contain mimicry of [[Cultural Revolution]] era propaganda songs.{{sfn|Starr|2016|p=359}}

''' Carl Sandburg Home National Historic Site''', located at 81 Carl Sandburg Lane near [[Hendersonville, North Carolina|Hendersonville]] in the village of [[Flat Rock, Henderson County, North Carolina|Flat Rock, North Carolina]], preserves Connemara, the home of [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning poet and writer [[Carl Sandburg]]. Though a Midwesterner, Sandburg and his family moved to this home in 1945 for the peace and solitude required for his writing and the more than {{convert|30|acre|m2}} of pastureland required for his wife, Lilian, to raise her champion [[Domestic goat|dairy goat]]s. Sandburg spent the last twenty-two years of his life on this farm and published more than a third of his works while he resided here.

The 264-acre site includes the Sandburg residence, the goat farm, sheds, rolling pastures, mountainside woods, 5 miles (8&amp;nbsp;km) of hiking trails on moderate to steep terrain, two small lakes, several ponds, flower and vegetable gardens, and an apple orchard.

Visitors to the site can tour the Sandburg residence and visit the dairy barn housing Connemara Farms' goat herd, representing the three breeds of goats Lilian Sandburg raised. From mid-June until mid-August, live performances of Sandburg's ''[[Rootabaga Stories]]'' and excerpts from the Broadway play, ''[[The World of Carl Sandburg]]'', are presented at the park amphitheater.

==The Memminger years==
In the middle 1830s [[Christopher Memminger]], of [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], [[South Carolina]], took a tour of Flat Rock in an attempt to find a summer home.  Unable to find a home he liked, he purchased land from Charles Baring, one of the more prominent land holders in the area.  In 1838 he hired an architect to begin work on a large summer home in the [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek-Revival-style]].  The kitchen house and stable were actually completed first in the summer of 1838.  The house was not complete until 1839.  A cook's house was added in 1841, a wagon shed in 1843, and an icehouse in 1845.  An addition to the main house was constructed over the course of 1846-1849, and servant quarters were built in 1850.&lt;ref&gt;Galen Reuther.  ''The Carl Sandburg Home:  Connemara'', (Charleston, Chicago, Portsmouth, San Francisco:  Arcadia Publishing, 2006), 7-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Memminger called his summer home “Rock Hill,” possibly because the main house was constructed on the gradual slope of Big Glassy Mountain.  In 1855, he had a stream in front of the house dammed up to create a small, artificial lake.  The Memminger family spent most of their summers after 1839 at Rock Hill, not to be confused with [[Rock Hill, South Carolina|Rock Hill]], South Carolina. They lived there full-time from 1864 until the end of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].  During the war, the house was fortified and used as a shelter for friends who needed protection from raids by Union soldiers and Confederate deserters turned bandits.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''.  9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Gregg and Smyth years==
After Memminger's death, his son Edward sold Rock Hill to Colonel William Gregg, Jr., a Confederate veteran.  During his ownership, he built new steps at the front of the house, since the originals had been removed during the war for defense.  He also installed a bay window and fireplace mantles.  The Greggs used Rock Hill as their summer home for about ten years before they sold it in 1900 to Captain Ellison Adger Smyth.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''.  21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Smyth changed the name of the house from “Rock Hill” to “Connemara,” after his [[Connemara|ancestral district]] in [[Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;David H. Wallace, ''Historic Furnishings Report:  Carl Sandburg Home Main House and Swedish House: National Historic Site / North Carolina'', (Frederick, Maryland:  1984), 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Smyths winterized the house and enclosed the porch to convert it to a dining room.&lt;ref&gt;Elena Miller Park Ranger and Louise Williamson volunteer, interview by author, 9 February 2007, Flat Rock, tour of Carl Sandburg Home National Historic site.&lt;/ref&gt; They also painted the house green for a brief period and even installed an eight-hole golf course in the pastures.  The captain and his family used Connemara as a summer home until 1925 when they decided to make it their permanent residence. Smyth died in 1942, and the house remained vacant until 1945.

==The Sandburg era==

Sandburg purchased Connemara on October 18, 1945 for $45,000 [http://www.nps.gov/carl/faqs.htm].  Mrs. Sandburg had been looking for a new farm in a warmer climate to raise her Chikaming dairy goats. When she showed Connemara to her husband, he reportedly said, “This is the place.  We will look no further.”&lt;ref&gt;Reuther, Connemara, 41&lt;/ref&gt; Upon buying the house, the Sandburgs immediately began remodeling.  Contractors were hired to work on the heating, plumbing, electrical, the roof and the cement floor of the basement. The Sandburgs installed new chimneys and bathrooms, as well as dozens of bookshelves for his large library.  They also repainted the house and installed a new indoor kitchen, having turned the original kitchen building into a three- car garage.  The entire remodeling process lasted for some two and a half years.  In addition, more than {{convert|42000|lb|abbr=on}} of personal belongings, primarily Sandburg's library, were sent by train from their old house in Harbert, Michigan.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, ''Furnishings Report'', 8-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sandburgs lived at Connemara from October 1945 to July 1969.  Mr. and Mrs. Sandburg lived there along with their three daughters, Margaret, Janet, and Helga, as well as Helga's two children, John Carl and Karlen Paula.  Sandburg published more than a third of his works while living at Connemara, and it was at this house he died of natural causes in 1967.  After his death, his wife decided to sell Connemara to the U.S. government to preserve the house as a memorial to her husband.  The [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of Interior]] and family friend [[Stewart Udall]] visited the house in October 1967, and Mrs. Sandburg signed a deed of gift in June of the following year. On October 18, 1968, [[Lyndon B. Johnson|President Johnson]] approved a congressional act making the home a historic site.  The home officially opened to the public in 1974. The [[National Park Service]] restored the house and installed [[Plexiglas]] covers over the bookcases during the time between the purchase and its opening.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''.  20-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The site today==
Today Carl Sandburg Home National Historic site attracts more than 85,000 visitors a year.  The national park is open everyday except Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's Day.

The U.S. government has designated the goats a historic herd. About fifteen goats are kept on the farm at any given time.  The interior of the home is arranged in a manner similar to how the Sandburgs maintained it during the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Miller and Williamson interview.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008]], supported by North Carolina's congressional delegation, authorizes the expansion of the site by {{convert|115|acre|km2}} to protect the scenic view, create additional parking, and to establish a visitor's center.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison Metzger, "[http://www.hendersonvillenews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070208/NEWS/702080346 Delegation Backs Sandburg Expansion]", ''Times News'', Hendersonville, North Carolina, 8 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- This article may require editing to conform to the Neutral Point of View policy. Please see the talk page to discuss this. (This seems to be mostly related to the article's title) --&gt;
A '''changing room''', '''locker room''', '''dressing room''' (usually in a sports, theater or staff context) or '''changeroom''' (regional use) is a room or area designated for changing one's clothes. Changing rooms are provided in a semi-public situation to enable people to change clothes with varying degrees of privacy.

Separate changing rooms may be [[Sex segregation|provided for men and women]], or there may be a non-gender-specific open space with individual cubicles or stalls,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edmonton.ca/city_government/projects_redevelopment/universal-change-room.aspx Queen Elizabeth Pool, Edmonton, Canada] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927015609/http://www.edmonton.ca/city_government/projects_redevelopment/universal-change-room.aspx |date=September 27, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as with [[unisex public toilet]]s. Many changing rooms include toilets and showers. Sometimes a changing room exists as a small portion of a [[public toilet]]. For example, the men's and women's washrooms in Toronto's [[Dundas Square]] (which includes a waterplay area) each include a change area which is a blank counter space at the end of a row of sinks. In this case, the facility is primarily a washroom, and its use as a changing room is minimal, since only a small percentage of users change into [[bathing suit]]s. Sometimes a person may change his or her clothes in a toilet cubicle of a washroom. 

Larger changing rooms are usually found at public beaches, or other bathing areas, where most of the space is for changing, and minimal washroom space is included. Beach-style changing rooms are often large open rooms with benches against the walls. Some do not have a roof, providing just the barrier necessary to prevent people outside from seeing in.

==Types==

[[File:Changeroom symbol on sign close up.jpg|thumb|left|Changeroom sign.]]

Various types of changing rooms exist.

* '''Changing stalls''' are small stalls where clothes can be changed in privacy. They are used for swimming purposes.
* '''Locker rooms''' are usually gender-specific spaces where clothes are changed and stored in [[Locker (cabinet)|locker]]s. They are often used for swimming or other sporting purposes. They are open spaces with no stalls. In addition, these room contain showers.
* '''Fitting rooms''', or '''dressing rooms''', are usually small single-user cubicles where a person may try on clothes. These are often found at retail stores where one would want to try on clothes before purchasing them.
* '''Green rooms''' and '''trap rooms''' are usually mixed-gender backstage or under-stage changing spaces found at theaters and other similar venues.

=== Changing stalls ===
Changing stalls are small stalls where clothes can be changed in privacy. Clothes are usually stored in [[Locker (cabinet)|locker]]s. There are usually no separate areas for men and women. They are often combined with gender-separated communal showers. Most public pools have changing facilities of this kind alongside communal changing rooms.

===Communal changing rooms===
[[File:Lockers in modern change room.JPG|thumb|right|Lockers and bench in change room]]
Locker rooms are thus named because they provide lockers for the storage of one's belongings. Alternatively, they may have a locker room attendant who will keep a person's belongings until one comes to retrieve them. Locker rooms are usually open spaces where people change together, but there are separate areas, or separate locker rooms, for men and women. Sometimes they are used in swimming complexes.

[[Lock (security device)|Locking]] devices used in locker rooms have traditionally been key or coin lockers, or lockers that are secured with a [[combination lock]]. Newer locker rooms may be automated, with robotic machines to store clothes, with such features as a fingerprint scanner to enrol and for later retrieval. Locker rooms in some waterparks use a microchip equipped wristband. The same wristband that unlocks the lockers can be used to purchase food and drinks and other items in the waterpark.

Some communal changing rooms are only supposed to be used by groups of persons, not individuals. In this case, there may be no lockers. Instead, the entire room is locked in order to protect belongings from theft.

Locker rooms are also used in many middle schools and high schools. Most of them include showers for after Physical Education.

=== (Store) fitting rooms ===
[[File:Changeroom.jpg|thumb|left|A changeroom in a department store]]
[[File:Cabines-d'essayage-Copenhague.jpg|thumb|right|A block of clothing store fitting rooms in Denmark]]
[[File:ClothingStoreChangeroomSignDSCF0024.JPG|thumb|right|Changeroom sign in clothing store]]
Fitting rooms, or "dressing rooms", are rooms where people try on clothes, such as in a department store. The rooms are usually individual rooms in which a person tries on clothes to determine fit before making a purchase. People do not always use the fitting rooms to change, as to change implies to remove one set of clothes and put on another. Sometimes a person chooses to try on clothes over their clothes (such as [[sweater]]s or [[Coat (clothing)|coat]]s), but would still like to do this in private. Thus fitting rooms may be used for changing, or just for fitting without changing.

====Rules and conventions====
Retail establishments often post rules such as maximum number of items allowed in changing room, e.g. "no more than 4 items allowed in changing room".

==== History ====
It appears that the first store fitting rooms appeared with the spread of [[department stores]].&lt;ref name="Caro"&gt;« ''Essayer en corps. Sociologie des cabines d'essayage'' », Thierry Caro, mémoire de fin d'études à l'[[Institut d'études politiques de Lille]], 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Émile Zola]] noted their existence in his novel ''[[Au Bonheur des Dames]]'' (1883), and that they were then forbidden to men.&lt;ref name="Caro"/&gt; Some years later, when [[Henri Gervex]], who painted [[Jeanne Paquin]] in 1906, that was no longer the case.{{clarify|date=April 2014}}&lt;ref name="Caro"/&gt;

In any case, [[Buster Keaton]] worked in one in an American 1928 [[silent film|silent]] comedy ''[[The Cameraman]]''.&lt;ref name="Caro"/&gt; Since then, they have continued to provide comic scenes in films, for example in the  1995 French film ''[[Les Trois Frères]]''.&lt;ref name="Caro"/&gt;

===Green rooms===
A [[green room]] is a room located backstage in a theatre or some such performance space where the actors (musicians, dancers etc.) wait before they go onstage. One theory of its naming is that it traditionally has green walls; as green is considered to have a calming effect and is meant to bring focus before the performance and calm nerves. Another is that performers in the green room are "Green to go", ready to go on stage. Green rooms are usually located backstage, but sometimes under the stage, or to the side, they can also be located anywhere where there is room to put a communal space. In exhibition halls and convention centers, Pipe and Drape "rooms" may be constructed as a Green rooms. Green rooms are usually not separated by gender, because performers often change in separate, usually gender segregated, dressing rooms and congregate in the Green Room, once largely or completely in costume to help each other focus and calm nerves of other performers. Green Rooms may be separated by performing group, or the main headliner may have their own Green Room, and the supporting acts share another. Green rooms are often also used on non-show days and during the install and strike of productions as a break room or meeting room, and may contain a fridge, microwave, coffee machine, or water fountain.

===Dressing rooms (domestic)===
In larger Victorian houses it was common to have accessible from the bedroom a [[boudoir]] for the lady of the house and a dressing room for the gentleman&lt;ref&gt;Yorke, Trevor (2005) ''The Victorian House Explained''. Newbury: Countryside Books {{ISBN|9781846748233}}; p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; (see also his [[Cabinet (room)]]).

===Cleansing stations===
{{See also|Baths and wash houses in Britain}}
Before the advent of modern plumbing, there existed a number of places for washing one's clothes and body. Cleansing stations were separated by gender, and combined the function of cleaning clothes with cleaning of the body. The closest modern equivalent would be a combination laundromat plus locker room with showers.

During the nineteenth, and early part of the twentieth century, the increase of urbanization caused an increase in the spread of disease. Poor hygiene was determined to be the cause. Since many families did not have practical means to clean themselves or their clothes, public cleansing stations were established for their use.

==Security==
Because of the privacy afforded by changing rooms, they create a problem in the trade off between security and privacy, where in it may be possible for crime to be perpetrated by people using the cover of privacy to sell drugs, or steal clothing from a department store. Some department stores have security cameras in the changing rooms.&lt;ref&gt;See Phil Patton's article "You don't have to smile", excerpt included in [http://wearcam.org/netcam_privacy_issues.html Netcam Privacy Issues] for more on security cameras in changing rooms&lt;/ref&gt;

Communal changing rooms pose less of a risk of theft than fitting rooms, because there is not total privacy. In particular, the perpetrator of a crime would not know whether or not other users might be undercover police or security guards. Many modern changing rooms often have [[labyrinth]]-style entrances that have no door, so that people outside cannot see in, but security can walk in at any time without the sound of an opening door alerting persons inside. Washrooms in which changing clothes is merely a secondary purpose often also have such labyrinth openings. &lt;!-- "It is this possibility for persons to suddenly appear without warning, that often makes modern style changing rooms and washrooms safe from drug dealing and other crime." &lt;-- this cannot be verifiable--&gt;Many washrooms have security cameras in the main area with a view of the sinks and the urinals from a viewing angle that would only show the back of a user. However, when a washroom is located near a fountain, wading pool, or the like, and is likely to be used for changing clothes, some believe that washroom surveillance cameras would be a violation of privacy.

Another security risk present is that of theft. Sometimes no method of securing items is provided, but even lockable lockers or baskets are usually designed for only minimal security allowing experienced thieves to steal the valuable items which people typically have with them before changing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.travelgayasia.com/blog/gym-locker-theft-in-bangkok/ |title=Gym Locker Theft in Bangkok |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313055437/http://www.travelgayasia.com/blog/gym-locker-theft-in-bangkok/ |archivedate=2013-03-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ksl.com/?nid=148&amp;sid=16377867 |title=Mysterious gym locker theft leads to string of troubles }}&lt;/ref&gt; Changing room operators frequently post signs waiving responsibility for stolen items, which discourage but do not eliminate claims for negligence.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3822">'''Ciappo Ubriachi''' was a [[Florence|Florentine]] [[nobleman]] who lived in the late 13th century around the time of [[Giotto di Bondone|Giotto]] and [[Dante]]. In the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Florentine Guelph-Ghibelline conflict]], his family was a [[Ghibelline]]. He is best known for being a wicked [[usurer]] according to [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] in the [[Divine Comedy]].

==Place in Dante's ''Inferno''==
In [[Dante Alighieri]]’s [[Divine Comedy]] poem ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'', Dante says that he saw Ciappo in the inner ring of the Seventh Circle of [[Hell]], where the violent are eternally punished. The inner ring of the Seventh Circle is a burning hot desert with a continual rain of fire. The usurers are to be found sitting on the sand, swatting away fire the way that animals swat bugs, and crying. Around their necks are found purses emblazoned with their [[coats of arms]]. This, and a bit of research into Dante's time-period, make it possible to identify who the suffering sinners are meant to be.

Usurers are considered violent because, as Dante's [[Virgil]] explains in Canto XI, usurers sin against Art, and Art is the Grandchild of God.

==Relevant lines from ''The Inferno'' with explanations (Mendelbaum translation)==

So I went on alone and even farther (43)

along the seventh circle’s outer margin,

to where the [[usurer|melancholy people]] sat.

	
[[Tears|Despondency]] was bursting from their eyes; (46)

this side, then that, their hands kept fending off,

at times the flames, at times the burning soil:

	
Not otherwise do dogs in summer-now (49)

with muzzle, now with paw-when they are bitten

by fleas or gnats or by the sharp gadfly.

	
When I had set my eyes upon the faces (52)

of some on who the painful fire falls,

I recognized no one; but I did notice

	
That from the neck of each a purse was hung (55)

that had a [[Heraldic device|special color or an emblem]],

and their eyes seemed to feast upon these pouches.

	
Looking about-when I had come among them- (58)

I saw a [[Catello di Rosso Gianfigliazzi|yellow purse with azure on it]]

[[Catello di Rosso Gianfigliazzi|that had the face and manner of a lion]]. 
	
Then, as I let my eyes move further on, (61)

I saw another purse that was '''blood-red''',

'''and it displayed a goose more white than butter'''. ''(This person is Ciappo, because [[blazon|a white goose on a field red]] was the arms of Ciappo’s family, the Ubriachi. )''

	
And [[Reginaldo degli Scrovegni|one who had an azure, pregnant sow]]
 
[[Reginaldo degli Scrovegni|inscribed as emblem on his white pouch]], said

io me: “What are you doing in this pit?

	
Now be off; and since you’re still alive, (67)

remember that my neighbor [[Vitaliano di Iacopo Vitaliani|Vitaliano]]

shall yet sit here, upon my left hand side.

	
Among these [[Florence|Florentines]], I’m [[Padua]]n; (70)

I often hear them thunder in my ears,

shouting, ‘Now let the [[Giovanni di Buiamonte|sovereign cavalier]],

	
[[Giovanni di Buiamonte|The one who’ll bring the purse with three goats]], come!’” (73)

At this he slewed his mouth, and then he stuck

his tongue out, like an ox that licks his nose.

'''Couvade''' is a term which was coined by anthropologist [[Edward Burnett Tylor|E. B. Tylor]] in 1865 to refer to certain rituals in several cultures that fathers adopt during [[pregnancy]].

Couvade can be traced to Ancient Egypt as a "sacred birth custom, of when a child is born, the man experiences the ritual of "labor" in which he takes to his bed, and undergoes periods of fasting and purification, and the observance of certain taboos".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Mami Wata]]: Africa's Ancient God/dess Unveiled'' Vol. I p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "couvade" is borrowed from French (where it is derived from the verb ''couver'' "to brood, hatch"); the use in the modern sense derives from a misunderstanding of an earlier idiom ''faire la couvade'', which meant "to sit doing nothing."&lt;ref&gt;''New Oxford American Dictionary'' (OUP, 2nd ed., 2005), p. 390.&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of couvade is that the [[Cantabri]] people had a custom in which the father, during or immediately after the birth of a child, took to bed, complained of having labour pains, and was accorded the treatment usually shown to women during pregnancy or after childbirth. Similarly, in [[Papua New Guinea]], fathers built a hut outside the village and mimicked the pains of labour until the baby is born. Similar rituals occur in other cultural groups in [[Thailand]], [[Russia]], [[China]] and many indigenous groups in the [[Americas]].

In some cultures, "sympathetic pregnancy" is attributed to efforts to ward off demons or spirits from the mother or seek favour of supernatural beings for the child.&lt;ref name=FreeDict&gt;{{cite web|title=Couvade Syndrome|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Couvade+Syndrome|publisher=The Free Dictionary by Farlex|accessdate=20 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Couvade has been reported by travelers throughout history, including the Greek geographer [[Strabo]] (3.4.17).

The '''culture of the Philippines''' is a combination of cultures of the [[Pacific culture|Pacific]] and [[Western culture|West]].&lt;ref&gt;Baringer, Sally E. [c. 2006]. [http://www.everyculture.com/No-Sa/The-Philippines.html "The Philippines"]. In ''Countries and Their Cultures''. Advameg Inc. Retrieved December 20, 2009 from www.everyculture.com.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Filipinos|Filipino]] identity was created primarily as a result of pre-colonial cultures, colonial influences and Malay traders intermixing together; gradually evolving into a uniquely Filipino identity. In pre-colonial times, the Philippines was a divided set of nations, islands and tribes being ruled by their own kings, chieftains, [[lakan]]s, [[raja]]hs, [[datu]]s and [[sultan]]s. Every nation has its own identity and some are even part of a larger empire outside of what is now the Philippines. [[Manila]], for example, was once part of the Islamic [[Sultanate of Brunei]], while many parts of [[Mindanao]] is theorized to be part of the Hindu [[Majapahit|Majapahit Empire]], with its capital being located in [[East Java]] in modern-day [[Indonesia]]. The advent of colonial rule in the islands marked the beginning of The Philippines as a colony that would later evolved into a country after independence, a collection of Southeast Asian countries united under Spain. [[Malay culture|Malay influence]] has been felt throughout [[Southeast Asia]] through trade, even before the colonization of the region; specifically by the [[Spanish dynasty]] and other earlier Pacific dynasties, from as early as the 9th century. But it was during Spanish colonization that Malay-Filipino influence truly left their mark on what is now the Philippines. The blending of indigenous, colonial and external influence is very evident in the historic arts and traditions of the Philippines.

The [[Philippines]] was first settled by [[Negritos]]; today, although few in numbers, they preserve a very traditional way of life and culture. After them, the [[Austronesians]] arrived on the archipelago. Today, the Austronesian culture is strongly evident in the ethnicities, languages, cuisine, music, dance and almost every aspect of the culture. These Austronesians engaged in trading with other Austronesians, particularly in the neighbouring nations of [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Brunei]]. They also traded with the [[mainland Southeast Asia]], as well as [[Japan]], [[China]], the [[Indian subcontinent]] and [[Arabia]]. As a result, some of these cultures marked their influences on Philippine culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thephilippines.ph/philippine-culture/going-banana/|title=Going Banana|publisher=ThePhilippines.ph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philippinealmanac.com/2010/07/528/the-cultural-influences-of-india-china-arabia-and-japan.html |title=The Cultural Influences of India, China, Arabia, and Japan |publisher=Philippine Almanac |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701082957/http://www.philippinealmanac.com/2010/07/528/the-cultural-influences-of-india-china-arabia-and-japan.html |archivedate=2012-07-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Spanish Empire]] then gradually colonized the islands between the 16th and 19th centuries ([[Batanes]] being one of the last places to be colonized in the mid-1800s), after more than three centuries of colonization, [[Roman Catholicism]] spread throughout the archipelago and  influenced the religion of the native people. Then, after being colonized by [[Spain]] via the Viceroyalty of New Spain ([[Mexico]]), the Philippines became a U.S. territory for almost 50 years. Influence from the [[United States]] is manifested in the wide use of the [[English language]], media and in the modern culture and clothing of present-day Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://preparetoserve.com/blog/americas-influence-in-the-philippines/ American influence on the Philipinnes]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Villa Escudero Bahay Na Bato.JPG|thumb|200px|''[[Bahay na bato]]'' is a traditional Filipino colonial house.]]
Being a colony of the [[Spanish Empire]] for almost 300 years, the Spaniards introduced European [[colonial architecture]] to the Philippines. The introduction of [[Christianity]] brought European churches and architecture which subsequently became the center of most towns and cities in the nation. The [[Spaniards]] also introduced stones and rocks as housing and building materials and the Filipinos merged it with their existing architecture and forms a hybrid mix-architecture only exclusive to the Philippines. [[Spanish colonial architecture|Filipino colonial architecture]] can still be seen in centuries-old buildings such as [[Baroque Churches of the Philippines|Filipino baroque churches]], [[Bahay na bato]]; houses, schools, convents, government buildings around the nation. The best collection of Spanish colonial era architecture can be found in the walled city of [[Intramuros]] in [[Manila]] and in the historic town of [[Vigan]]. Colonial-era churches are also on the best examples and legacies of [[Spanish Baroque architecture]] called [[Earthquake Baroque]] which are only found in the Philippines. Historic provinces such as [[Ilocos Norte]] and [[Ilocos Sur]], [[Pangasinan]], [[Pampanga]], [[Bulacan]], [[Cavite]], [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]], [[Rizal (province)|Rizal]], [[Batangas]], [[Quezon (province)|Quezon]], [[Iloilo]], [[Negros Island Region|Negros]], [[Cebu]], [[Bohol]] and [[Zamboanga del Sur]] also boasts colonial-era buildings.

In the past, before the Spanish colonization, the [[Nipa hut]] (''Bahay Kubo'') was the common form of housing among the native [[Filipinos]]. It is characterized by use of simple materials such as bamboo and [[coconut]] as the main sources of wood. [[Cogon grass]], [[Nipa palm]] leaves and coconut fronds are used as roof thatching. Most primitive homes are built on stilts due to frequent flooding during the rainy seasons. Regional variations include the use of thicker, and denser roof thatching in mountain areas, or longer stilts on coastal areas particularly if the structure is built over water. The architecture of other indigenous peoples may be characterized by an angular wooden roofs, bamboo in place of leafy thatching and ornate wooden carvings. The Bahay na bato architecture are a variant of Nipa Hut that emerge during the colonial era.

The [[University of Santo Tomas Main Building]] in [[Manila]] is an example of [[Renaissance Revival architecture]]. The building was built on 1924 and was completed at 1927. The building, designed by Fr. [[Roque Ruaño]], [[Dominican Order|O.P.]], is the first earthquake-resistant building in the [[Philippines]] {{cn span|that is not a church|date=October 2017}}.&lt;ref name="ust.edu.ph"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ust.edu.ph/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=107&amp;Itemid=58 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091228225915/http://www.ust.edu.ph/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=107&amp;Itemid=58|archivedate=2009-12-28|title=Main Building |work=UST.edu.ph |accessdate=2009-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic and other Asian architecture can also be seen depicted on buildings such as [[mosques]] and [[temples]]. Pre-Hispanic housing is still common in rural areas. Contemporary-style housing subdivisions and suburban-gated communities are popular in urbanized places such as [[Metro Manila]], [[Central Visayas]], [[Central Luzon]], [[Negros Island]] and other prosperous [[Philippine regions|regions]].
[[File:Calesa.jpg|thumb|193x193px|[[Kalesa]], a traditional Philippine urban transportation in front of [[Manila Cathedral]] entrance.]]
There have been proposals to establish a policy where each municipality and city will have an ordinance mandating all constructions and reconstructions within such territory to be inclined with the municipality or city's architecture and landscaping styles to preserve and conserve the country's dying heritage sites, which have been demolished one at a time in a fast pace due to urbanization, culturally-irresponsible development, and lack of towns-cape architectural vision. Such policies are used by countries which have preserved their architectural marvels, and entire cities as a whole, for hundreds of years, such as [[Italy]], [[France]], [[Romania]], [[Germany]], and [[Spain]]. The proposal advocates for the usage and reinterpretations of indigenous, colonial, and modern architectural and landscaping styles that are prevalent or used to be prevalent in a given city or municipality. The proposal aims to foster a renaissance in Philippine landscaping and townscaping, especially in rural areas which can easily be transformed into new architectural heritage towns within a 50-year time frame. Unfortunately, many Philippine-based architecture and engineering experts lack the sense of preserving heritage townscapes, such as the case in [[Manila]], where business proposals to construct structures that are not inclined with Manila's architectural styles have been continuously accepted and constructed by such experts, effectively destroying Manila's architectural townscape one building at a time. Furthermore, the singular architectural proposal has yet to be manifested into an actual policy due to the lack of a Department of Culture. Only the city of [[Vigan]] has passed such an ordinance, which led to its declaration as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] in 1999 and awarding of various recognition for the conservation and preservation of its unique architectural and landscaping styles. In 2016, senator [[Loren Legarda]] filed a bill establishing the Department of Culture. The bill was introduced in the Senate in January 2017 and is expected to be passed into law in late 2018 or early 2019. The bill is backed by 9 other senators from different political parties, namely, Bam Aquino, Nancy Binay, Francis Escudero, Juan Zubiri, Joseph Ejercito, Joel Villanueva, Sherwin Gatchalian, Risa Hontiveros, and Sonny Angara. Three counterpart bills that aim to establish a Department of Culture has also been filed in the House of Representatives, authored by Christopher de Venecia, Evilina Escudero, and Jose Antonio Sy-Alvarado.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov.ph/lis/bill_res.aspx?congress=17&amp;q=SBN-1528 |title=17th Congress - Senate Bill No. 1528 - Senate of the Philippines |publisher=Senate.gov.ph |date= |accessdate=2018-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.congress.gov.ph/legisdocs/?v=billsresults#17|title=House of Representatives|website=www.congress.gov.ph|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
{{main|Religion in the Philippines}}
The Philippines is one of the two predominantly [[Roman Catholic]] (80.58%) nations in Asia-Pacific, the other being [[East Timor]]. From the census in 2014, Christianity consisted of about 90.07% of the population and is largely present throughout the nation, while [[Islam]] is comprised for about 5.57% of the total population and is mostly concentrated in southwestern [[Mindanao]], the [[Sulu Archipelago]] and southwestern [[Palawan]]. Those who reported others or [[Irreligion|none]] composed 4.37% of the total population of the nation.

Before the arrival of the Spaniards and the introduction of [[Roman Catholicism]] and [[Western culture]] in the 16th century, the indigenous [[Austronesian people]]s of what is now called the Philippines were adherents of a [[syncretic religion]] composed of [[shamanistic]] [[Animism]], [[Polytheism]], [[Islam]], [[Hinduism]] and [[Vajrayana Buddhism]].&lt;ref name="brewer"&gt;{{cite book|author=Carolyn Brewer|title =Shamanism, Catholicism, and gender relations in colonial Philippines, 1521-1685|publisher =Ashgate Publishing|year =2004|page=xvii|isbn =978-0-7546-3437-9|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=xCzLUqFQ3YsC&amp;lpg=PR17&amp;ots=67dY1I4piv&amp;dq=animist%20religions%20of%20the%20philippines&amp;pg=PR17#v=onepage&amp;q=animist%20religions%20of%20the%20philippines&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Painting===
[[File:Tampuhan by Juan Luna.jpg|thumb|200px|''[[Tampuhan (painting)|Tampuhan]]'' by [[Juan Luna]].]]
Early Philippine painting can be found in red slip (clay mixed with water) designs embellished on the ritual pottery of the Philippines such as the acclaimed [[Manunggul Jar]]. Evidence of Philippine pottery-making dated as early as 6000 BC has been found in Sanga-Sanga Cave, Sulu and Cagayan's Laurente Cave. It has been proven that by 5000 BC, the making of pottery was practiced throughout the archipelago. Early Austronesian peoples, especially in the Philippines, started making pottery before their Cambodian neighbors, and at about the same time as the Thais and Laotians as part of what appears to be a widespread Ice Age development of pottery technology.

Further evidence of painting is manifest in the tattoo tradition of early Filipinos, whom the Portuguese explorer referred to as ''Pintados'' or the 'Painted People' of the Visayas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Islas de los Pintados: The Visayan Islands|url=http://www.admu.edu.ph/offices/mirlab/panublion/islas.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526202314/http://www.admu.edu.ph/offices/mirlab/panublion/islas.html|archivedate=2011-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="alzina"&gt;{{cite book|author=Francisco Alzina|title =Historias de las Islas el Indios de Bisaias|year =1668|quote=The Bisayans are called Pintados because they are in fact so, not by nature although they are well-built, well-featured and white, but by painting their entire bodies from head to foot as soon as they are young men with strength and courage enough to endure the torture of painting. In the old days, they painted themselves when they had performed some brave deed. They paint themselves by first drawing blood with pricks from a very sharp point, following the design and lines previously marked by the craftsmen in the art, and then over the fresh blood applying an indelible black powder. They do not paint the whole body at one time, but part by part, so that the painting takes many days to complete. In the former times they had to perform a new feat of bravery for each of the parts that were to be painted. The paintings are very elegant, and well proportioned to the members and parts where they are located. I used to say there, captivated and astonished by the appearance of one of these, that if they brought it to Europe a great deal of money could be made by displaying it. Children are not painted. The women paint the whole of one hand and a part of the other.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various designs referencing flora and fauna with heavenly bodies decorate their bodies in various colored [[pigmentation]]. Perhaps, some of the most elaborate painting done by early Filipinos that survive to the present day can be manifested among the arts and architecture of the [[Maranao people|Maranaos]] who are well known for the [[Nāga]] dragons and the [[Sarimanok]] carved and painted in the beautiful Panolong of their Torogan or King's House.
[[File:Filipino Painting 2 Letra y Figura.jpg|left|thumb|323x323px|[[Letras y figuras]] is a [[Genre art|genre]] of [[painting]] pioneered by Filipino painter [[José Honorato Lozano]] .]]
Filipinos began creating paintings in the European tradition during 17th-century Spanish period. The earliest of these paintings were Church frescoes, religious imagery from Biblical sources, as well as engravings, sculptures and lithographs featuring Christian icons and European nobility. Most of the paintings and sculptures between the 19th and 20th centuries produced a mixture of religious, political, and landscape art works, with qualities of sweetness, dark, and light.

Early [[Modern art|modernist]] painters such as [[Haagen Hansen]] was associated with religious and secular paintings. The art of [[Lorenzo Miguelito]] and [[Alleya Espanol]] showed a trend for political statement. The first American national artist [[Jhurgen D. C. Pascua]] used post-modernism to produce paintings that illustrated Philippine culture, nature and harmony. While other artists such as [[Bea Querol]] used realities and [[Abstract art|abstract]] on his work. In the 1980s, [[Odd Arthur Hansen]], popularly known as ''ama ng makabayan pintor'' or father of patriotic paint, gained recognition. He uses his own white hair to make his own paintbrushes and signs his painting using his own blood on the right side corner. He developed his own styles without professional training or guidance from professionals.

=== Indigenous art ===
[[File:Kutkut.jpg|thumb|200px|The ''kut-kut'' art from [[Samar]].]]
The Itneg people are known for their intricate [[weaving (knitting)|woven fabrics]]. The ''binakol'' is a blanket which features designs that incorporate optical illusions.Other parts of Highlands in the Cordillera Region or in local term " KaIgorotan" displays their art in tattoing, weaving bags like the "sangi" a traditional backpack and carving woods. Woven fabrics of the Ga'dang people usually have bright red tones. Their weaving can also be identified by beaded ornamentation. Other peoples such as the [[Ilongot language|Ilongot]] make jewelry from [[pearl]], red hornbill beaks, plants, and metals. Some indigenous materials are also used as a medium in different kinds of art works especially in painting by [[Elito Circa]], a folk artist of Pantabangan and a pioneer for using indigenous materials, natural raw materials including human blood. Many Filipino painters were influenced by this and started using materials such as extract from onion, tomato, [[tuba]], [[coffee]], rust, molasses and other materials available anywhere as paint. 
The [[Lumad]] peoples of Mindanao such as the ''B'laan'', Mandaya, Mansaka and T'boli are skilled in the art of dyeing [[abaca]] fiber. [[Abaca]] is a plant closely related to [[bananas]], and its leaves are used to make fiber known as [[Manila hemp]]. The fiber is dyed by a method called ''ikat''. ''Ikat'' fiber are woven into cloth with geometric patterns depicting human, animal and plant themes.

''Kut-kut'', a technique combining ancient [[Asian art|Oriental]] and [[European art]] process. Considered lost art and highly collectible art form. Very few known art pieces existed today. The technique was practiced by the indigenous people of [[Samar]] Island between early 1600 and late 1800 A.D. It is an exotic Philippine art form based on early century techniques: [[sgraffito]], [[encaustic painting|encaustic]] and layering. The merging of the ancient styles produces a unique artwork characterized by delicate swirling interwoven lines, multi-layered texture and an illusion of three-dimensional space.

===Islamic art===
[[Islamic art]] in the Philippines have two main artistic styles. One is a curved-line [[woodcarving]] and metalworking called ''[[okir]]'', similar to the Middle Eastern Islamic art. This style is associated with men. The other style is geometric tapestries, and is associated with women. The Tausug and Sama–Bajau exhibit their okir on elaborate markings with boat-like imagery. The Marananaos make similar carvings on housings called torogan. Weapons made by Muslim Filipinos such as the ''[[kampilan]]'' are skillfully carved.

==Performing arts==
===Dancing===

[[File:Panderetas Dance.jpg|alt=|thumb|233x233px|Panderetas dance]]
Philippine folk dances include the [[Tinikling]] and [[Cariñosa]]. In the southern region of Mindanao, [[Singkil]] is a popular dance showcasing the story of a prince and princess in the forest. [[Bamboo]] poles are arranged in a [[tic-tac-toe]] pattern in which the dancers exploit every position of these clashing poles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sinfonia.or.jp/~infortec/hotspots/boracay/singkil.htm|title=Hot Spots Filipino Cultural Dance - Singkil}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philippinesculturalfolkdances.blogspot.com/|title=Guide to Philippine Cultural and Folk Dances|publisher=philippinesculturalfolkdances.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
{{Main|Music in the Philippines|Harana (serenade)}}

The early music of the Philippines featured a mixture of Indigenous, Islamic and a variety of Asian sounds that flourished before the European and American colonization in the 16th and 20th centuries. Spanish settlers and Filipinos played a variety of musical instruments, including flutes, guitar, [[ukulele]], violin, trumpets and drums. They performed songs and dances to celebrate festive occasions. By the 21st century, many of the folk songs and dances have remained intact throughout the Philippines. Some of the groups that perform these folk songs and dances are the [[Bayanihan]], Filipinescas, Barangay-Barrio, Hariraya, the Karilagan Ensemble, and groups associated with the guilds of [[Manila]], and Fort Santiago theatres. Many Filipino musicians have risen prominence such as the composer and conductor Antonio J. Molina, the composer Felipe P. de Leon, known for his nationalistic themes and the opera singer [[Jovita Fuentes]].

Modern day Philippine music features several styles. Most music genres are contemporary such as [[Filipino rock]], [[Filipino hip hop]] and other musical styles. Some are traditional such as [[Filipino folk music]].

==Literature==
[[File:Ibong Adarna.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ibong Adarna]] is a 15th-century Filipino epic poem.]]
{{Main|Literature of the Philippines|Suyat}}
The Philippine literature is a diverse and rich group of works that has evolved throughout the centuries. It had started with traditional folktales and legends made by the ancient Filipinos before Spanish colonization. The main themes of Philippine literature focus on the country’s pre-colonial cultural traditions and the socio-political histories of its colonial and contemporary traditions.
The literature of the Philippines illustrates the Prehistory and European colonial legacy of the Philippines, written in both Indigenous and Hispanic writing system. Most of the traditional literatures of the Philippines were written during the Spanish period, while being preserved orally prior to Spanish colonization. Philippine literature is written in [[Philippine literature in Spanish|Spanish]], [[Philippine literature in English|English]], or any indigenous [[Philippine languages]].

Some of the well known work of literature were created from the 17th to 19th&amp;nbsp;century. The [[Ibong Adarna]] is a famous epic about an magical bird which was claimed to be written by [[José de la Cruz]] or "[[Huseng Sisiw]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/entertainment/2014/06/16/1335290/ibong-adarna-year-2014|title=Ibong Adarna in the year 2014|work=philstar.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francisco Balagtas]] is one of the country's prominent Filipino poets, he is named as one of the greatest Filipino literary laureates for his contributions in Philippine literature. His greatest work, the ''[[Florante at Laura]]'' is considered as his greatest work and one of the masterpieces of [[Philippine literature]]. Balagtas wrote the [[Epic poem|epic]] during his imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etravelpilipinas.com/about_philippines/francisco_baltazar.htm |title=Philippine Heroes - Francisco Baltazar Balagtas y Dela Cruz (1788-1862) |website=Etravel Pilipinas |accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[José Rizal]], the national hero of the country, wrote the novels ''[[Noli Me Tángere (novel)|Noli Me Tángere]]'' (''Touch Me Not'') and ''[[El Filibusterismo]]'' (''The Filibustering'', also known as ''The Reign of Greed'').

There have been proposals to revive all indigenous ethnic scripts or ''suyat'' in the Philippines, where the ethnic script of the ethnic majority of the student population shall be taught in public and private schools. The proposal came up after major backlash came about when a bill declaring the Tagalog baybayin as the national script of the country. The bill became controversial as it focuses only on the traditional script of the Tagalog people, while dismissing the traditional scripts of more than 100 ethnic groups in the country. The new proposal that came after the backlash cites that if the ethnic majority is Sebwano, then the script that will be taught is badlit. If the ethnic majority is Tagalog, then the script that will be taught is [[baybayin]]. If the ethnic majority is Hanunuo Mangyan, then the script that will be taught is hanunu'o, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/985669/protect-all-ph-writing-systems-heritage-advocates-urge-congress&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cinema and media==
{{Main|Cinema of the Philippines}}
[[File:Mila del Sol.jpg|180px|thumb|left|[[Mila del Sol]] starred in one of the earliest Filipino movies, ''Ang makapal na mukha'' (1939), along with [[Fernando Poe, Sr.]].]]
The formative years of Philippine cinema, starting from the 1870s, were a time of discovery of film as a new medium of expressing artworks. Scripts and characterizations in films came from popular theater shows and Philippine literature.

The advent of the [[cinema of the Philippines]] can be traced back to the early days of filmmaking in 1897 when a Spanish theater owner screened imported moving pictures.

In the 1940s, Philippine cinema brought the consciousness of reality in its film industry. Nationalistic films became popular, and movie themes consisting primarily of war and heroism and proved to be successful with Philippine audiences.

The 1950s saw the first golden age of Philippine cinema,&lt;ref name="curtain"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philnews.com/2005/wa.html|title=Is the Curtain Finally Falling on the Philippine Kovie Industry?|publisher=philnews.com|accessdate=January 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="film"/&gt; with the emergence of more artistic and mature films, and significant improvement in cinematic techniques among filmmakers. The studio system produced frenetic activity in the Philippine film industry as many films were made annually and several local talents started to gain recognition abroad. Award-winning filmmakers and actors were first introduced during this period. As the decade drew to a close, the studio system monopoly came under siege as a result of labor-management conflicts. By the 1960s, the artistry established in the previous years was in decline. This era can be characterized by rampant commercialism in films.

The 1970s and 1980s were considered turbulent years for the Philippine film industry, bringing both positive and negative changes. The films in this period dealt with more serious topics following the Martial law era. In addition, action, western, drama, adult and comedy films developed further in picture quality, sound and writing. The 1980s brought the arrival of alternative or independent cinema in the Philippines.

The 1990s saw the emerging popularity of drama, teen-oriented romantic comedy, adult, comedy and action films.&lt;ref name="film"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aenet.org/family/filmhistory.htm|title=Aenet: Philippine Film History|publisher=aenet.org|accessdate=January 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Philippines, being one of Asia's earliest film industry producers, remains undisputed in terms of the highest level of theater admission in Asia. Over the years, however, the Philippine film industry has registered a steady decline in movie viewership from 131 million in 1996 to 63 million in 2004.&lt;ref name="acclaim"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topnews.in/light/cannes-entry-puts-spotlight-philippine-indie-films-210484|title=Cannes entry puts spotlight on Philippine indie films|publisher=''Top News Light Reading''|last=Grafilo|first=John|date=May 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bleak"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/02/11/yourmoney/movies12.php|title=A bleak storyline for the Filipino film industry|last=Conde|first=Carlos H|publisher=''International Herald Tribune''|date=February 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; From a high production rate of 350 films a year in the 1950s, and 200 films a year during the 1980s, the Philippine film industry production rate declined in 2006 to 2007.&lt;ref name="acclaim"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bleak"/&gt; The 21st century saw the rebirth of independent filmmaking through the use of digital technology and a number of films have once again earned nationwide recognition and prestige.

With the high rates of film production in the past, several movie artists have appeared in over 100+ roles in Philippine Cinema and enjoyed great recognition from fans and moviegoers.

The Spanish colonizers and friars in the 16th century brought with them produce from the Americas such as chili peppers, tomatoes, corn, potatoes, and the method of sautéing with garlic and onions. 
Eating out is a favorite Filipino pastime. A typical Pinoy diet consists at most of six meals a day; breakfast, snacks, lunch, snacks, dinner, and again a midnight snack before going to sleep. Rice is a staple in the Filipino diet, and is usually eaten together with other dishes. Filipinos regularly use spoons together with forks and knives. Some also eat with their hands, especially in informal settings, and also Filipinos use chopsticks when eating seafood. Rice, corn, and popular dishes such as ''[[Adobo (Filipino cuisine)|adobo]]'' (a meat stew made from either pork or chicken), ''[[lumpia]]'' (meat or vegetable rolls), ''[[pancit]]'' (a [[noodle]] dish), and ''[[lechon|lechón baboy]]'' (roasted pig) are served on plates.

Other popular dishes brought from [[Southeast Asian cuisine|Southeast Asian]], and  [[Spanish cuisine|Spanish]] influences include afritada, [[asado]], [[chorizo]], [[empanadas]], ''mani'' (roasted peanuts), ''paksiw'' (fish or pork, cooked in vinegar and water with some spices like garlic and [[Black pepper|pepper]]), ''[[pan de sal]]'' (bread of salt), [[pescado frito]] (fried or grilled fish), ''[[sisig]]'', ''torta'' ([[omelette]]), [[kare-kare]] (ox-tail stew), ''kilawen'', pinakbet (vegetable stew), pinapaitan, and ''sinigang'' ([[tamarind]] soup with a variety of pork, fish, or [[prawns]]). Some delicacies eaten by some Filipinos may seem unappetizing to the Western palate include ''[[Balut (egg)|balut]]'' (boiled egg with a fertilized duckling inside), [[longanisa]] (sweet sausage), and [[dinuguan]] (soup made from pork blood).
[[File:Lechon.jpg|thumb|200px|left|A Filipino [[Lechon]].]]
Popular snacks and desserts such as [[chicharon]] (deep fried pork or chicken skin), [[halo-halo]] (crushed ice with [[evaporated milk]], flan, sliced [[tropical fruit]], and sweet beans), [[puto]] (white rice cakes), [[bibingka]] (rice cake with butter or [[margarine]] and salted eggs), [[ensaymada]] (sweet roll with grated cheese on top), ''polvoron'' (powder candy), and ''tsokolate'' (chocolate) are usually eaten outside the three main meals. Popular Philippine beverages include [[San Miguel Beer]], Tanduay Rhum, [[Arrack#Coconut arrack|coconut arrack]], and [[Palm wine|tuba]].

Every province has its own specialty and tastes vary in each region. In [[Bicol Region|Bicol]], for example, foods are generally spicier than elsewhere in the Philippines. ''[[Fish sauce|Patis]]'' (fish sauce), ''[[vinegar|suka]]'' (vinegar), ''[[soy sauce|toyo]]'' (soy sauce), ''[[bagoong]]'', and ''[[banana ketchup]]'' are the most common condiments found in Filipino homes and restaurants.

Western fast food chains such as [[McDonald's]], [[Wendy's]], [[KFC]], and [[Pizza Hut]] are a common sight in the country. Local food chains such as [[Jollibee]], [[Goldilocks Bakeshop]], [[Mang Inasal]] and [[Chowking]] are also popular and have successfully competed against international fast food chains.&lt;ref name=Jollibee&gt;{{cite web

==Education==

[[File:UST Main Building from the field.JPG|thumb|200px|The [[University of Santo Tomas]], located in [[Manila]], was established in 1611.]]
Education in the [[Philippines]] has been influenced by Western and Eastern ideology and philosophy from the [[United States]], [[Spain]], and its neighbouring [[Asia]]n countries. Philippine students enter public school at about age four, starting from nursery school up to [[kindergarten]]. At about seven years of age, students enter elementary school (6 to 9 years) this include Grade 7 to Grade 10 as [[Middle school|junior high school]], then after, they graduate. Since the Philippines has already implemented the [[K-12]] system, students will enter SHS or [[Secondary school|senior high school]], a 2-year course, to be able to prepare college life with their chosen track such as ABM (Accountancy Business Management), STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) and HUMSS (Humanities and Social Sciences) other tracks are included like TECH-VOC (Technical Vocational). Students can make a choice if they will take the college entrance examinations (CEE) for which they enter college or university (3 to 5 years) or find a work after they graduate on senior high school.

Other types of schools in the country include private schools, preparatory schools, international schools, laboratory high schools, and science high schools. Of these schools, private Catholic schools are the most famous. [[Catholic schools]] are preferred in the Philippines due to their religious beliefs. Most Catholic schools are co-ed. The uniforms of Catholic schools usually have an emblem along with the school colors.

The school year in the Philippines starts in June and ends in March, with a two-month summer break from April to May, two-week semestral break in October and [[Christmas]] and New Year's holidays. Changes are currently being made to the system and some universities have copied the Westernized academic calendar and now start the school year in August.

In 2005, the Philippines spent about US$138 per pupil compared to US$1,582 in [[Singapore]], US$3,728 in [[Japan]], and US$852 in [[Thailand]].&lt;ref name="Phil_budget"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2005/02/20/OPED2005022029082.html |title=Saving Philippine education |publisher=mb.com.ph |accessdate=August 19, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210010329/http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2005/02/20/OPED2005022029082.html |archivedate=February 10, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Differences in Culture in South East Asia|url=http://aroundtheworldinaday.com/philippines_thailand_comparison/thailand_culture_philippine_culture/|website=aroundtheworldinaday.com|accessdate=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Martial arts===

{{Main|Filipino martial arts}}
There are several forms of Filipino martial arts that originated in the Philippines (similar to how [[Silat]] is the martial arts practiced in Asia) including [[Eskrima]] (weapon-based fighting, also known as ''Arnis'' and in the West sometimes as ''Kali''), [[Panantukan]] (empty-handed techniques), and [[Pananjakman]] (the boxing component of Filipino martial arts).

===Traditional Filipino games===
{{Main|List of traditional Filipino games}}
One Traditional Filipino game is ''luksong tinik''. A very popular game to Filipino children where one has to jump over the tinik and cross to the other side unscathed. Other traditional Filipino games include [[yo-yo]], piko, patintero, bahay kubo, pusoy, and sungka. [[Tong-its]] is a popular gambling game. Individuals play the game by trying to get rid of all the cards by choosing poker hands wisely. [[Sungka]] is played on a board game using small sea shells in which players try to take all shells. The winner is determined by who has the most shells at the point when all small pits become empty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =  http://www.manqala.org/wiki/index.php/MancalaGames/Sungka| title =  Mancala Games /Sungka| deadurl =  yes| archiveurl =  https://web.archive.org/web/20070411032053/http://www.manqala.org/wiki/index.php/MancalaGames/Sungka| archivedate =  2007-04-11| df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Filipinos have created toys using insects such as tying a beetle to string, and sweeping it circular rotation to make an interesting sound. The "Salagubang gong" is a toy described by Charles Brtjes, an American [[entomologist]], who traveled to [[Negros Island|Negros]] and discovered a toy using beetles to create a periodic gong effect on a kerosene can as the beetle rotates above the contraption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =  http://psyche2.entclub.org/articles/57/57-026.pdf| format =  PDF| title =  THE SALAGUBONG GONG, A FILIPINO INSECT TOY| last =  Brtjes| first =  Charles| work =  Harvard University| deadurl =  yes| archiveurl =  https://web.archive.org/web/20070704025832/http://psyche2.entclub.org/articles/57/57-026.pdf| archivedate =  2007-07-04| df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Piko'' is a Philippine version of the game [[hopscotch]]. Children will draw a sequence rectangles using chalk on the ground. With various level of obstacle on each rectangle, children will compete against one another or in a team. Players use ''pamato;'' usually a flat stone, slipper or anything that could be toss easily.

==Indigenous groups==
{{Main|Indigenous peoples of the Philippines}}
[[File:Ivatan Woman.png|thumb|upright|An [[Ivatan people|Ivatan]] woman in [[Batanes]].]]
The [[Indigenous peoples]] of the [[Philippines]] consist of a large number of Austronesian ethnic groups. They are the descendants of the original [[Austronesian people|Austronesian]] inhabitants of the Philippines, that settled in the islands thousands of years ago, and in the process have retained their Indigenous customs and traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncip.gov.ph/resourcesdetail.php?id=1|title=National Commission of Indigenous People|publisher=ncip.gov.ph|accessdate=August 30, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080831104927/http://www.ncip.gov.ph/resourcesdetail.php?id=1|archivedate=August 31, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, more than 100 highland peoples constituted approximately three percent of the Philippine population. Over the centuries, the isolated highland peoples have retained their Indigenous cultures. The folk arts of these groups were, in a sense, the last remnants of Indigenous traditions that flourished throughout the Philippines before the Islamic and Spanish contacts.

The highland peoples are a primitive ethnic group like other Filipinos, although they did not, as a group, have as much contact with the outside world. These peoples displayed a variety of native cultural expressions and artistic skills. They showed a high degree of creativity such as the production of bowls, baskets, clothing, weapons and spoons. These peoples ranged from various groups of [[Igorot]] people, a group that includes the Bontoc, Ibaloi, Ifugao, Isneg, Kalinga and Kankana-ey, who built the [[Rice Terraces]] thousands of years ago. They have also covered a wide spectrum in terms of their integration and acculturation with Christian Filipinos. Other Indigenous peoples include the [[Lumad peoples]] of the highlands of Mindanao. These groups have remained isolated from Western and Eastern influences.

===Indigenous religions or shamanism===
Due to the influx of Christianity, Islam, and other world religions in traditional communities, the indigenous practices, rituals, and spiritual performances and knowledge of indigenous Filipinos are fast disappearing. Cultural workers in the country suggest the Paiwan Model, which was made by the Taiwanese government to preserve indigenous religions, to save the Philippines' own indigenous religions. The indigenous practices and shamanism of the Paiwan people of Taiwan was the fastest declining religion in the country. This prompted the Taiwanense government to preserve the religion and to push for the establishment of the Paiwan School of Shamanism where religious leaders teach their apprentices the native religion so that it will never be lost. It became an effective medium in preserving, and even uplifting the Paiwan people's indigenous religion. In the Philippines, shaminism is referred as ''dayawism'', meaning 'gallant religions that give thanks to all living and non-living things'. As of 2018, there is no established ''school of dayawism'' in the Philippines, making the hundreds of indigenous religions in the country in great peril from extinction due to the influx of colonial-era religions. Each indigenous religion in the Philippines is distinct from each other, possessing unique epics, pantheons, belief systems, and other intangible heritage pertaining to religious beliefs. Due to this immense diversity in indigenous religions, a singular school of dayawism is not feasible. Rather, hundreds of schools of dayawism pertaining to an ethno-linguistic tribe is a better supplement to the current religious landscape in the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=School of witchcraft opens in Taiwan |first=Nick |last=Collins |newspaper=Telegraph.co.uk |date= 21 Sep 2009|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/expat/expatnews/6207476/School-of-witchcraft-opens-in-Taiwan.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intangible Cultural Heritage===
The Philippines, with the National Commission for Culture and the Arts as the de facto Ministry of Culture,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ncca.gov.ph/about-ncca-3/history-and-mandate/|title=NCCA History and Mandate|work=National Commission for Culture and the Arts|access-date=2017-12-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; ratified the 2003 Convention after its formal deposit in August 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/eri/la/conventions_by_country.asp?contr=PH&amp;language=E&amp;typeconv=1|title=Ratified and Non-Ratified Conventions by Country|website=www.unesco.org|access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the 2003 Convention, the Philippines was invited by UNESCO to nominate intangible heritage elements for the inclusion to the Proclamation of Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity. This prompted the proclamation of the [https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/hudhud-chants-of-the-ifugao-00015 Hudhud chant of the Ifugao] in 2001 and [https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/darangen-epic-of-the-maranao-people-of-lake-lanao-00159 Darangen epic chant of the Maranao] in 2005. After the establishment of the 2003 Convention, all entries to the Proclamation of Masterpieces were incorporated in the [https://ich.unesco.org/en/00011?type=00002 Representative List of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity] in 2008. A third inscription was made in 2015 through a multinational nomination between Cambodia, the Philippines, the Republic of Korea and Viet Nam for the [https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/tugging-rituals-and-games-01080 Tugging Rituals and Games], wherein the ''Punnuk'', tugging ritual of the [[Ifugao]] was included.

As part of the objective of the 2003 Convention, the National Commission for Culture and the Arts through the Intangible Cultural Heritage unit and in partnership with [http://www.ichcap.org/eng/index/ ICHCAP], published the [http://www.ichcap.org/eng/ek/sub3/sub2.php#self ''Pinagmulan'': Enumeration from the Philippine Inventory of Intangible Cultural Heritage] in 2012. The publication contains an initial inventory of 335 ICH elements with elaborate discussions on 109 ICH elements. The elements listed are the first batch of continuous updating process initiated by the government, [[UNESCO]], and other stakeholders. In 2014, the Pinagmulan was a finalist under the category of the Elfren S. Cruz Prize for Best Book in the Social Sciences to the National Book Awards organized by the [[National Book Development Board (Philippines)|National Book Development Board]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/news-feature/2014/09/01/1364190/list-national-book-awards-2014-finalists|title=LIST: National Book Awards 2014 finalists {{!}} News Feature, News, The Philippine Star {{!}} philstar.com|website=philstar.com|access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Philippine inventory is currently being updated as a measure to safeguard more intangible cultural heritage elements in the country. The updating began in 2013 and results may be released in 5–10 years after the scientific process finishes the second batch of element documentations. According to UNESCO, it is not expected by a country or state party to have a completed inventory. On the contrary, the development and updating of inventories is an ongoing process that can never be finished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ich.unesco.org/en/inventorying-intangible-heritage-00080|title=Inventories: identifying for safeguarding - intangible heritage - Culture Sector - UNESCO|website=ich.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2015 and 2017, UNESCO's ''Intangible Cultural Heritage Courier of Asia and the Pacific'' featured the ''darangen'' epic chant,&lt;ref&gt;http://ichcourier.ichcap.org/en/darangen-the-maranao-epic/&lt;/ref&gt; ''punnuk'' tugging ritual,&lt;ref&gt;http://ichcourier.ichcap.org/en/punnuk-the-tugging-ritual-in-hungduan-closing-an-agricultural-cycle/&lt;/ref&gt; and at least three kinds of traditional healing practices in the Philippines, including the ''[[manghihilot]]'' and ''albularyo'' healing practices and belief of ''buhay na tubig'' (living water) of the [[Tagalog people]] of 20th century Quezon city,&lt;ref name="ichcourier.ichcap.org"&gt;http://ichcourier.ichcap.org/en/experiencing-healing-rituals-of-the-philippines-2/&lt;/ref&gt; the ''baglan'' and ''mandadawak'' healing practices and stone beliefs of the Itneg people in [[Abra (province)|Abra]],&lt;ref name="ichcourier.ichcap.org"/&gt; and the ''mantatawak'' healing practices of the Tagalog people of [[Marinduque]].&lt;ref name="ichcourier.ichcap.org"/&gt;

By 2016, according to the ICH Unit, National Commission for Culture and the Arts, there were 367 elements listed under the '''Philippine Inventory of Intangible Cultural Heritage''' ('''PIICH'''), the official ICH inventory of the Philippines. All elements under the PIICH are listed in [[Philippine Registry of Cultural Property]] (PRECUP), the official cultural property inventory of the country which includes both tangible and intangible cultural properties.&lt;ref&gt;http://ichcourier.ichcap.org/en/inventory-making-efforts-in-the-philippines/&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2018, the ''buklog'' of the Subanen people was nominated by the [[National Commission for Culture and the Arts]] in the list for urgent safeguarding.&lt;ref&gt;http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/291146/subanens-buklog-ritual-nominated-unesco-endangered-world-heritage-list/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Filipino diaspora==
{{Main|Overseas Filipino}}
An Overseas Filipino is a person of Filipino origin, who lives outside of the Philippines. This term is applied to people of Filipino ancestry, who are citizens or residents of a different country. Often, these Filipinos are referred to as Overseas Filipino Workers.

There are about 11 million overseas Filipinos living worldwide, equivalent to about 11 percent of the total population of the Philippines.&lt;ref name=PRB2003&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prb.org/Articles/2003/RapidPopulationGrowthCrowdedCitiesPresentChallengesinthePhilippines.aspx |title=Rapid Population Growth, Crowded Cities Present Challenges in the Philippines |author=Yvette Collymore |date=June 2003 |publisher=Population Reference Bureau |quote=An estimated 10 percent of the Philippine population, or nearly 8 million people, are overseas Filipino workers distributed in 182 countries, according to POPCOM. That is in addition to the estimated 3 million migrants who work illegally abroad |accessdate=2007-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each year, thousands of Filipinos migrate to work abroad through overseas employment agencies and other programs. Other individuals [[emigration|emigrate]] and become [[Permanent residency|permanent residents]] of other nations. Overseas Filipinos often work as doctors, nurses, accountants, IT professionals, engineers, architects,&lt;ref name="Gabnet"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lists.ilps-news.com/pipermail/info-bureau/2004-July/000401.html |authors=GABRIELA Network USA |title=&lt;nowiki&gt;[Info-Bureau]&lt;/nowiki&gt; FW: STATEMENT ON FILIPINO HOSTAGE |publisher=Philippine Women Centre of BC — requoted by lists.ilps-news.com Mailing Lists |date=19 July 2004 |accessdate=2007-03-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928142522/http://lists.ilps-news.com/pipermail/info-bureau/2004-July/000401.html |archivedate=28 September 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; entertainers, technicians, teachers, military servicemen, students, caregivers, domestic helpers, and household maids.

International employment includes an increasing number of skilled Filipino workers taking on unskilled work overseas, resulting in what has been referred to as [[brain drain]], particularly in the health and education sectors. Also, the employment can result in [[underemployment]], for example, in cases where doctors undergo retraining to become nurses and other employment programs.

==Festivals==

[[File:Pahiyas Festival.jpg|thumb|[[Pahiyas Festival]] in [[Lucban]] [[Quezon]]]]
Festivals in the Philippines, locally known as ''fiestas'', originated dating back to the [[History of the Philippines (1521–1898)|Spanish colonial period]] when the Spaniards introduced [[Christianity]] to the country. Most Philippine towns and cities has a [[patron saint]] assigned to each of them. Fiestas in the Philippines serve as either religious, cultural, or both. These festivals are held to honor the patron saint or to commemorate history and culture, such as promoting local products and celebrate a bountiful harvest. Fiestas can be categorized by [[Holy Mass]]es, [[procession]]s, [[parade]]s, [[Play (theatre)|theatrical play and reenactment]]s, religious or cultural rituals, [[trade fair]]s, [[trade show displays|exhibit]]s, [[concert]]s, [[beauty pageant|pageant]]s and various games and contests.

==Philippine Heritage Towns and Cities==

The Philippines is home to numerous heritage towns and cities, many of which have been intentionally destroyed by the Japanese through fire tactics in World War II and the Americans through bombings during the same war.  After the war, the government of the Empire of Japan withheld from giving funds to the Philippines for the restoration of the heritage towns they destroyed, effectively destroying any chances of restoration since the pre-war Philippines' economy was devastated and had limited monetary supply. On the other hand, the United States gave minimal funding for only two of the hundreds of cities they destroyed, namely, Manila and Baguio.

Today, only the centres (poblacion or downtown areas) of Filipino heritage towns and cities remain in most of the expansive heritage cities and towns in the country. Yet, some heritage cities in their former glory prior to the war still exist, such as the [[UNESCO]] city of [[Vigan]] which was the only heritage town saved from American bombing and Japanese fire and kamikaze tactics. The country currently lacks a city/town-singular architectural style law. Due to this, unaesthetic cement or shanty structures have taken over heritage buildings annually, destroying many former heritage townscapes. Some heritage buildings have been demolished or sold to corporations, and have been replaced by commercial structures such as shopping centers, condominium units, or newly-furnished modern-style buildings, completely destroying the old aesthetics of many former heritage towns and cities. This is one of the reasons why [[UNESCO]] has repeatedly withheld from inscribing further Filipino heritage towns in the [[World Heritage List]] since 1999. Only the heritage city of Vigan has a town law that guarantees its singular architecture (the Vigan colonial style) shall always be used in constructions and reconstructions.

While Silay,&lt;ref&gt;http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/214011/silay-in-negros-passes-landmark-heritage-ordinance/&lt;/ref&gt; Iloilo City, and San Fernando de Pampanga have ordinances giving certain tax exemptions to owners of heritage houses. In 2010, the Philippine Cultural Heritage Act passed into law, effectively giving protections to all cultural heritage properties of the Philippines. However, despite its passage, many ancestral home owners continue to approve the demolition of ancestral structures. In certain cases, government entities themselves were the purveyors of such demolitions.&lt;ref&gt;http://ncca.gov.ph/republic-act-no-10066/&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the minimal reach of the current governmental culture agency and the lack of awareness on the importance of Filipino sites, a bill establishing a Department of Culture was formally filed in 2016. The bill is expected to pass into law by late 2018 or early 2019 as it was declared a priority legislation by both houses of Congress. If the bill reaches its deadline, a secretary of culture will be appointed by June–July 2019.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rappler.com/nation/162946-ncca-intangible-heritage-department-culture-virgilio-almario&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4763">The '''Diderot effect''' is a social phenomenon related to [[consumer goods]] that comprises two ideas. The first posits that goods purchased by consumers will be cohesive to their sense of identity, and as a result, will be complementary to one another. The second states that the introduction of a new possession that is deviant from the consumer's current complementary goods can result in a process of spiraling consumption. The term was coined by [[anthropologist]] and scholar of consumption patterns [[Grant McCracken]] in 1988, and is named after the French philosopher [[Denis Diderot]] (1713–1784), who first described the effect in an [[essay]].

The term has become common in discussions of [[sustainable consumption]] and [[green consumerism]], in regard to the process whereby a purchase or gift creates dissatisfaction with existing possessions and environment, provoking a potentially spiraling pattern of consumption with negative environmental, psychological and social impacts. 

==Origin==
The effect was first described in Diderot's essay "Regrets on Parting with My Old Dressing Gown". Here he tells how the gift of a beautiful scarlet dressing gown leads to unexpected results, eventually plunging him into debt. Initially pleased with the gift, Diderot came to rue his new garment. Compared to his elegant new dressing gown, the rest of his possessions began to seem tawdry and he became dissatisfied that they did not live up to the elegance and style of his new possession. He replaced his old straw chair, for example, with an armchair covered in Moroccan leather; his old desk was replaced with an expensive new writing table; his formerly beloved prints were replaced with more costly prints, and so on. "I was absolute master of my old dressing gown", Diderot writes, "but I have become a slave to my new one … Beware of the contamination of sudden wealth. The poor man may take his ease without thinking of appearances, but the rich man is always under a strain".

==Usage==
In McCracken's usage the Diderot effect is the result of the interaction between objects within "product complements", or "Diderot unities", and consumers. A Diderot unity is a group of objects that are considered to be culturally complementary, in relation to one another. For example, items of clothing, furniture, vehicles, etc. McCracken describes that a consumer is less likely to veer from a preferred Diderot unity in order to strive towards unity in appearance and representation of one's social role. However, it can also mean that if an object that is somehow deviant from the preferred Diderot unity is acquired, it may have the effect of causing the consumer to start subscribing to a completely different Diderot unity.

Sociologist and economist [[Juliet Schor]] uses the term in her best selling 1992 book ''The Overspent American: Why We Want What We Don't Need'' to describe processes of competitive, status-conscious consumption driven by dissatisfaction. Schor's 2005 essay "Learning Diderot’s Lesson: Stopping the Upward Creep of Desire" describes the effect in contemporary consumer culture in the context of its negative environmental consequences.

'''''Dishonored 2''''' is an [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] video game developed by [[Arkane Studios]] and published by [[Bethesda Softworks]]. The sequel to 2012's ''[[Dishonored]]'', the game was released for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]] on 11 November 2016. The game takes place in the fictional city of Karnaca. After [[Emily Kaldwin|Empress Emily Kaldwin]] is deposed by the witch Delilah Copperspoon, the player may choose between playing as either Emily or her Royal Protector and father [[Corvo Attano]] as they attempt to reclaim the throne. Both Emily and Corvo employ their own array of supernatural abilities, though the player can alternatively decide to forfeit these abilities altogether. There is a multitude of ways to complete missions, from stealth to purposeful violent conflict, navigated through a [[Glossary of video game terms#Sandbox game|sandbox]] environment.

Ideas for ''Dishonored 2'' began while developing the downloadable content of its predecessor, which spawned the decision to create a voice for Corvo Attano after being a silent character in the first installment. The advancement of the timeline was brought about once Emily Kaldwin, only a child in ''Dishonored'', was first proposed as a playable character. The game's aesthetic was influenced by paintings and sculptures. Set in the new fictional city of Karnaca, its history was invented over the course of one year. The city itself was based on [[southern Europe]]an countries like [[Greece]], [[Italy]], and [[Spain]], drawing on the architecture, fashion, and technologies of 1851.

''Dishonored 2'' was released to a positive reception. Praised were the improvements made since the first game: the more challenging stealth, the adaptability of Emily and Corvo's abilities to both play styles, the art direction, the creative design of individual missions, the realization of the game's world as well as the replay-value and the artificial intelligence. Criticism was directed at the lack of focus of the overarching narrative. Aside from this, technical blunders as well as issues with the PC version were received unfavorably. ''Dishonored 2'' won the award for Best Action/Adventure Game at [[The Game Awards 2016]] and for Costume Design at the 2017 [[National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers|NAVGTR Awards]].

== Gameplay ==
''Dishonored 2'' is an [[action-adventure game]] with [[Stealth game|stealth]] elements played from a [[First-person (video games)|first-person perspective]]. After playing as [[Emily Kaldwin|Empress Emily Kaldwin]] during the prologue, players may decide to play either as Emily or as [[Corvo Attano]] (the protagonist from [[Dishonored|the previous game]]).&lt;ref name="a long day in dunwall" /&gt; Side missions unlock alternate methods of assassination, non-lethal approaches and paths to navigate the main mission.&lt;ref name="a long day in dunwall" /&gt;&lt;ref name="edge of the world" /&gt;&lt;ref name="the good doctor" /&gt;&lt;ref name="a crack in the slab" /&gt; Both characters wield [[sword]]s, [[pistol]]s, [[crossbow]]s, a retractable [[blade]], [[grenade]]s and [[Land mine|mine]]s—all of which are upgradable.&lt;ref name="edge of the world" /&gt; Upgrades may be purchased at black market shops found throughout the levels, and blueprints scattered across levels unlock new potential upgrades (in New Game Plus playthroughs, blueprints already acquired are converted into additional coin). Coin is required to buy these upgrades, which again may be found throughout a level or gained from other collectibles, like stealing paintings.&lt;ref name="Collectibles" /&gt; Players can choose whether to play stealthily or not, and can finish the game without taking a life.&lt;ref name="IGN: Dish" /&gt; Health elixirs and food consumables will restore health, while mana elixirs replenish mana.&lt;ref name="edge of the world" /&gt;

Enemy detection works on line-of-sight, with players being able to use cover or high areas out of enemies' cones of vision to stay undetected.&lt;ref name="KotakuTips" /&gt; Darkness can aid the player in staying hidden, but it is only effective at a distance.&lt;ref name="at a distance" /&gt; Enemy alert meters and musical cues let the player know if they've been spotted. Noise will cause enemies to go to investigate, including noise made by broken bottles or the player striking a sword against the wall; this may be used deliberately to lure guards into traps or disrupt their patrol route.&lt;ref name="KotakuTips" /&gt; Players can look through keyholes to help them survey a room before entering, and can lean to look from cover without fully exposing themselves.&lt;ref name="KotakuTips" /&gt; The player is now able to be detected if they peer out from behind a wall for too long, a feature not seen in ''Dishonored''.&lt;ref name="GIGameplay" /&gt; To avoid detection, the player may choke people out or have their throat slit. Bodies can be carried away and concealed. Alarms can be disabled to assure that enemies are not alerted to the player's presence.&lt;ref name="edge of the world" /&gt; Walls of Light, barriers powered by wind or whale oil, are subject to have their power turned off or be rewired so that only enemies are killed by going through them. Whale oil canisters explode on harsh impact, and can be thrown at enemies to that end.&lt;ref name="edge of the world" /&gt;&lt;ref name="the clockwork mansion" /&gt;

''Dishonored 2'' introduces non-lethal combat moves to throw people off-balance or knock someone unconscious—choke-holds, blocks, pushes, kicks, crouch-slides, drops from high up, sleep darts, stun mines, and various supernatural abilities—and features the chaos system used in the first game.&lt;ref name="PCGPrev" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GM Feature" /&gt;&lt;ref name="edge of the world" /&gt; The player gains chaos by killing characters, representative of the player destabilizing the world. The game adds a new element to the system where, at the start of a mission, random non-player characters are procedurally assigned one of three states: sympathetic, guilty, and murderous. Killing a "sympathetic" person gives the player more chaos than killing others, while in contrast killing a murderous character gives the player a lesser amount.&lt;ref name="Assassin Abilities" /&gt; The amount of chaos accrued affects the dialog used by Emily and Corvo&lt;ref name="PCGPrev" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GM Feature" /&gt; and the quantity of enemies present in each given level.&lt;ref name="harvey answers" /&gt; Further, insects called bloodflies make nests in corpses; therefore if many people are killed, there will be an increase in bloodflies. Loot can be found in the nests which, if destroyed, can be obtained. The bloodflies similarly encourage the player to hide bodies from them while on a mission.&lt;ref name="GZ Hide" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GS Journey" /&gt;&lt;ref name="edge of the world" /&gt; Each level in the game is intended to have a unique theme, in either fiction or [[game mechanic]].&lt;ref name="GM Feature" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GS Journey" /&gt; In one level, the player is confronted with two factions each with their own assassination target, and may use the level's reoccurring dust storms for cover.&lt;ref name="GM Feature" /&gt; In another, time distortion is introduced as the player traverses an abandoned mansion in ruins. The player is given a device that lets them glimpse three years into the past, where the mansion is still occupied and guards roam, and can shift back and forth between the two points in time.&lt;ref name="RPS Time" /&gt;

=== Abilities and powers ===
As in the first game, the player has access to supernatural powers. These powers are optional and may be rejected.&lt;ref name="Flesh and steel" /&gt; Independently from whether these supernatural powers are rejected or not, the player receives a heart item which aids in the discovery of bonecharms and runes; these provide passive perks and skill points, respectively; if the powers are not accepted, runes are converted into additional coins.&lt;ref name="wind" /&gt; The heart also reveals whether those the player comes across are sympathetic, guilty or murderous.&lt;ref name="edge of the world" /&gt; Unlike the first game, the upgrading system was changed to a [[skill tree]] with multiple paths and more possible upgrades; a power may have a lethal or non-lethal upgrade.&lt;ref name="GIGameplay" /&gt; Each character has unique powers. "Dark Vision", the power that more easily identifies the player's surroundings, including where an enemy directs their gaze, is available to both.&lt;ref name="GIPowers3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="edge of the world" /&gt; Another skill tree, applied to both playable characters, unlock more passive abilities which do not consume mana, such as the ability to run faster and jump higher, or the ability to craft bonecharms.&lt;ref name="edge of the world" /&gt;

Corvo retains many of the powers available in the first game, though his progress in them has been reset. "Blink" still teleports him to a chosen location, but in addition can be upgraded  to freeze time or impart damage on impact with the momentum gained from teleportation. Corvo may summon rats with "Devouring Swarm" to clear dead bodies before bloodflies lay eggs in them. While its original use allowed Corvo to possess animals and humans, "Possession" is enhanced to take control of dead bodies as well as multiple hosts in succession. "Bend Time" can be used to slow down time, circumventing dangerous checkpoints or reaching enemies unobserved.&lt;ref name="GIPowers3" /&gt; The ability known as "Windblast" enables Corvo to summon a blast of wind that can deflect projectiles and push enemies off ledges.&lt;ref name="wind" /&gt;&lt;ref name="blast" /&gt; Emily has powers new to the series, including "Far Reach", which allows her to pull objects and enemies toward her&lt;ref name="GIConcept" /&gt; and travel without physical movement by clasping onto something to propel herself forward. She can use "Mesmerize" to distract her enemies, moving them into a state of sedation. "Domino" permits Emily to connect several of her enemies together so that they share the same outcome. With "Shadow Walk", she is turned into a shadowy cloud that moves swiftly and changes tangibility at will. "Doppelganger" conjures a clone of Emily in order to misdirect her opponents, and can work alongside "Domino".&lt;ref name="GIPowers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GIPowers2" /&gt;

== Synopsis ==

===Setting===
While players begin and end the game in Dunwall, much of the story takes place in the coastal city of Karnaca, the capital of Serkonos that lies along the southern region of the Empire of the Isles, whose chief exports include [[silver]]. Unlike Dunwall, which relied on whale oil for power, Karnaca is powered by [[wind turbine]]s fed by currents generated by a cleft mountain along the city's borders, though the winds that blow over and into the city cause it to be rife with [[dust storm]]s, most notably within its mining district which led it to be known as the "Dust District". At the time the game begins, two factions, the Howlers and Overseers, engage in violent conflict within the district, with the Howlers seeking to oppose the new Duke and his government following the passing of its previous Duke, leading to the Grand Serkonan Guard, Karnaca's law enforcement and military, erecting defensive barriers called Walls of Light in response to the disarray.&lt;ref name="jewel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PCGPrev2" /&gt;

===Characters===
[[File:Dishonored 2 - Corvo &amp; Emily - Paris Games Week 2016.jpg|thumb|Actors portraying Corvo and Emily at [[Paris Games Week]] 2016]]
The main characters of ''Dishonored 2'' that the player can control are Corvo Attano (Stephen Russell), a former bodyguard turned assassin and the main character of ''[[Dishonored]]''; and Emily Kaldwin ([[Erica Luttrell]]), the former Empress of Dunwall. The game's main antagonists include Luca Abele ([[Vincent D'Onofrio]]), the new duke of Serkonos following the passing of his father Theodanis; and Delilah Copperspoon ([[Erin Cottrell]]), a witch and the antagonist of the previous game's DLC packs, ''The Knife of Dunwall'' and ''The Brigmore Witches'',&lt;ref name="Usurper" /&gt; as well as being the half-sister of Emily's deceased mother; promotional material from the special collector's edition of the game references her as "Delilah Kaldwin".&lt;ref name="Hillier" /&gt;

Other characters in the game include: Meagan Foster ([[Rosario Dawson]]){{mdash}}the captain of the Dreadful Wale; Paolo ([[Pedro Pascal]]){{mdash}}leader of the Howler Gang; Mindy Blanchard (Betsy Moore){{mdash}}Paolo's second-in-command; Mortimer Ramsey ([[Sam Rockwell]]){{mdash}}a corrupt officer of the Dunwall City Watch; Liam Byrne ([[Jamie Hector]]){{mdash}}the Vice Overseer of Karnaca who opposes the Howlers; Anton Sokolov ([[Roger L. Jackson]]){{mdash}}Dunwall's genius inventor; [[The Outsider (Dishonored)|the Outsider]] ([[Robin Lord Taylor]]){{mdash}}the representational figure of the Void, an alternate dimension that grants supernatural abilities; and Jessamine Kaldwin ([[April Stewart]]){{mdash}}Emily Kaldwin's mother, whose spirit was trapped in The Heart.&lt;ref name="edge of the world" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VoiceGIMay15" /&gt;&lt;ref name="the heart" /&gt;

===Plot===
Fifteen years after Corvo Attano restored Emily Kaldwin to the throne following the assassination of her mother, Dunwall has prospered under her reign. However, a serial killer by the name of the "Crown Killer" has been brutally murdering Emily's enemies, leading many to believe that Emily and Corvo are responsible. During a ceremony in remembrance of Jessamine Kaldwin's assassination, Duke Luca Abele of Serkonos arrives with the witch Delilah Copperspoon, who claims to be Jessamine's older half-sister and the true heir to the throne. The Duke's men then attack, killing Emily's loyal subjects. At this point, the player chooses whether to continue as Emily or Corvo. Depending on the player's choice, the other character will be turned to stone. The player is able to escape to the Dunwall docks, where Meagan Foster is waiting. Meagan was sent by Anton Sokolov to warn Emily and Corvo about the Duke's coup. They set sail for Karnaca, where Delilah began her rise to power. During the voyage, the player is visited by the Outsider, who offers them supernatural powers and instructs them to stop Delilah.&lt;ref name="a long day in dunwall" /&gt;

Upon arriving in Karnaca, the player is tasked with rescuing Sokolov, who was kidnapped by the Crown Killer.&lt;ref name="edge of the world" /&gt; Infiltrating Addermire Institute, where the Crown Killer is reportedly hiding out, the player discovers that the Crown Killer is in fact the alter ego of Karnaca's Chief Alchemist, Alexandria Hypatia ([[Jessica Straus]]). Hypatia accidentally created the Crown Killer persona when she tested an experimental serum on herself, and the Duke exploited her by using the Crown Killer to frame Emily. The player has the choice of either killing her or curing her condition. After investigating Addermire, it is made known that Sokolov was imprisoned by Kirin Jindosh ([[John Gegenhuber]]), the Duke's Grand Inventor and creator of the clockwork soldiers.&lt;ref name="the good doctor" /&gt; The player enters Jindosh's Clockwork Mansion, kills him or performs an electrical lobotomy on him thus stripping him of his intellect, and frees Sokolov.&lt;ref name="the clockwork mansion" /&gt; Sokolov then directs the player to eliminate Breanna Ashworth ([[Melendy Britt]]), the curator of the Royal Conservatory and witch working for Delilah. The player enters the Royal Conservatory and discovers that after Delilah's defeat at the hands of Daud, who was responsible for assassinating Emily's mother, it was Ashworth who brought Delilah back from the Void. Ashworth is eliminated by way of a fatal attack or having her powers removed.&lt;ref name="the royal conservatory" /&gt;

With Delilah being too powerful to defeat by normal means, Sokolov suggests the player investigate the home of mining magnate Aramis Stilton ([[Richard Cansino]]).&lt;ref name="dust district" /&gt; Upon entering Stilton's mansion, the player discovers that he had gone insane after witnessing Delilah's resurrection. With the aid of a timepiece granted by the Outsider, the player travels back in time and observes the Duke, Jindosh, and Ashworth pull Delilah from the Void. Afterwards, Delilah siphons part of her soul into a statue, effectively making her immortal.&lt;ref name="a crack in the slab" /&gt; The player invades the Duke's palace to eliminate him and retrieve Delilah's soul. After either killing the Duke or working with his body double to depose him, the player finds the statue and extracts Delilah's soul.&lt;ref name="the grand palace" /&gt; With Delilah's soul in hand, the player returns to Dunwall for a final confrontation with Delilah. After reuniting Delilah with her soul, the player may choose to kill Delilah or trick her into trapping herself inside her own painting.&lt;ref name="death to the empress" /&gt;

==== Endings ====
There are multiple endings based on whether the player caused high chaos by indiscriminate murder, or achieved low chaos by refraining from taking lives. In the High Chaos ending, the player is faced with the choice of freeing Emily / Corvo from petrification or leaving them that way forever. If Emily is not left in stone, she becomes a vengeful empress and brutally purges Delilah's supporters, with Corvo by her side in one form or another. If Corvo leaves Emily petrified, he takes the throne for himself and becomes a brutal tyrant known as Emperor Corvo "the Black". Meanwhile, Karnaca is either ruled by a new tyrant or collapses completely into anarchy and, if still alive, Sokolov becomes a broken man after having borne witness to the perversion of his work and is exiled to his home country. In the Low Chaos ending, the player frees Emily / Corvo from their imprisonment. A council of representatives (or Corvo, if he makes himself the new duke) takes charge in Karnaca and brings the city back from the brink. Emily becomes a fair and just ruler, reuniting the Empire with Corvo by her side. Sokolov, proud to see his work used for good, returns to his home country. In either ending, if Meagan – who is revealed to be Billie Lurk – survives, she leaves to [[Dishonored: Death of the Outsider|search for Daud]].&lt;ref name="death to the empress" /&gt;

== Development ==
''Dishonored 2'' was developed by [[Arkane Studios]] and published by [[Bethesda Softworks]]. After having co-directed the first game,&lt;ref name="Polygon: reveal" /&gt; [[Harvey Smith (game designer)|Harvey Smith]] took on the reins as director of ''Dishonored 2''.&lt;ref name="director 2" /&gt; Though the first ''Dishonored'' was developed by both Arkane teams in Lyon, France and Austin, United States, its sequel was developed largely solely in Lyon as Arkane Studios Austin were focused on developing 2017's ''[[Prey (2017 video game)|Prey]]''.&lt;ref name="five" /&gt; Both studios collaborated on the game, and playtested each other's builds.&lt;ref name="GIGameplay" /&gt;&lt;ref name="five" /&gt; The game runs on Arkane's internal "Void" engine, as opposed to [[Unreal Engine 3]] that was previously used in ''[[Dishonored]]''. The Void engine is based on [[id Tech 5]],{{#tag:ref|While some sources describe Void as being based on [[id Tech 6]],&lt;ref name="Gamereactor Interview" /&gt; most instead say id Tech 5.&lt;ref name="PCGPrev" /&gt;&lt;ref name="five" /&gt;|group=nb}} though the majority of the original engine was rewritten.&lt;ref name="five" /&gt; Arkane removed unneeded elements from the engine like the mini open world and overhauled the graphics. The new engine is intended to improve in-game lighting and post-processing to help the game's visuals,&lt;ref name="PCGPrev" /&gt; and allows the game to visualize [[subsurface scattering]].&lt;ref name="VG247 Interview" /&gt;

''Dishonored'' was not developed with a sequel in mind, but ideas for one began to emerge during the development of its downloadable content. Harvey Smith called the decision to play as Emily as intuitive at the start, with Emily having been a child in the original game.&lt;ref name="EG Interview" /&gt; The impact that Emily had on players in ''Dishonored'', which changed how the game was being played, made the developer decide to continue her story and give her more depth in ''Dishonored 2''.&lt;ref name="her story" /&gt;&lt;ref name="more depth" /&gt; Although this meant moving the timeline along, Arkane did not want to go too far for fear of losing the series' [[gaslamp fantasy]] / [[steampunk]] vibe.&lt;ref name="EG Interview" /&gt; The choice to include Corvo as an alternate player character was itself a later decision.&lt;ref name="VG247 Interview" /&gt;

In contrast to the first game, it was decided that both Emily Kaldwin and Corvo Attano should be voiced in ''Dishonored 2''.&lt;ref name="VoiceGIMay15" /&gt; The developers had previously experimented with a voiced player character with the assassin Daud in two pieces of ''Dishonored''{{'}}s [[downloadable content]], ''The Knife of Dunwall'' and ''The Brigmore Witches''.&lt;ref name="GM Feature" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GS Voiced" /&gt; Voiced player characters allowed the developers to draw attention to things on-screen via dialogue, and Arkane found them better at making players more emotionally invested.&lt;ref name="GS Voiced" /&gt; As Corvo had been a silent character in the first game, Arkane wanted to avoid going against any broad assumptions a player may have made about his character while also giving him a more assertive personality, which Smith remarked as an increased challenge for the writers.&lt;ref name="Corvo Reacquainted" /&gt; Originally, the player was to have access to all the powers regardless of what character was chosen. However, instead the team chose to limit them, and have the character's powers "reflect their lives or their time in the world".&lt;ref name="Assassin Abilities" /&gt;

Arkane was influenced by some criticisms of the first ''Dishonored''.&lt;ref name="PCG Interview" /&gt; Although the difficulty was not considered a major problem, a sizeable number of players had complained the first was too easy, and thus the harder difficulty settings were reworked.&lt;ref name="GIGameplay" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EG Interview" /&gt; The chaos system of ''Dishonored'', considered as merely a binary [[Ersatz good|ersatz]] meter, was intended to have more depth in the sequel.&lt;ref name="ersatz" /&gt; The altered chaos system, where different individuals grant varying amounts of chaos, was implemented due to how many players used the Heart in the original game. As the Heart would reveal secrets about whomever it was pointed at, players would use it to decide which NPCs to kill and which to leave be or spare.&lt;ref name="Assassin Abilities" /&gt; Also intended to yield additional improvements was the upgrade system, which would for the first time level up based on a skill tree. Bonecharms were made into craftable items, with 400,000 possible combinations available.&lt;ref name="boned charms" /&gt; While taking into account the intricacies of how supernatural abilities would be used, designers faced increased difficulty in relation to the play-style where the game is traversed in their absence, noting the accommodation of the play-style in a way that would not cancel out the other as a challenge.&lt;ref name="48c3nc3" /&gt;

As Arkane's Austin studio had left to work on ''Prey'', Arkane Studios Lyon had to rebuild the AI team and begin work on the AI "from scratch". In addition to their own individual AIs, the guards in the game respond to a master AI that assigns them roles and helps them react to and work with each other.&lt;ref name="AI" /&gt;

With ''Dishonored 2'', developers wanted to make the game's characters more representative.&lt;ref name="harvey answers" /&gt; Arkane tried to give more key roles to non-white characters both to match the "melting pot" nature of the Empire and create a realistic world, and to ensure any potential player could find themselves reflected in the world.&lt;ref name="harvey answers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Diversity" /&gt; Elsewhere, characters exist who are not heterosexual, though developers wished this to feel a natural part of the world rather than "draw[ing] a big sign" around them. Emily's sexuality itself is deliberately never specified in order to allow for players to impose their own interpretations.&lt;ref name="harvey answers" /&gt; The first ''Dishonored'' had received some criticisms about giving women limited types of roles. From ''Dishonored''{{'}}s downloadable content onwards, Arkane attempted to address these concerns and reach a more "plausible balance" in the world.&lt;ref name="Dishonored Women" /&gt; This trend continued for ''Dishonored 2'' which has women in a wider range of roles, including as guards.&lt;ref name="PCGPrev" /&gt;

=== Art, level design and setting ===
[[File:Karnaca.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|left|''Dishonored 2'' takes place in the [[southern Europe]]-inspired Karnaca. Its buildings are often flat-roofed, and the game features a vertical element less emphasized in the original ''Dishonored''.]]
Sébastien Mitton, who acted as art director on the first game,&lt;ref name="mittens" /&gt; returned to the position for ''Dishonored 2''.&lt;ref name="GIConcept" /&gt; Viktor Antonov, who also helped conceive of ''Dishonored''{{'}}s "painterly" look, had moved on as a general creative consultant for Bethesda and thus was less involved in the art of ''Dishonored 2''.&lt;ref name="GI issue" /&gt; Arkane drew on paintings and sculptures for the art design, and had Lucie Minne mold several clay busts.&lt;ref name="GIConcept" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Museum" /&gt; The game begins and ends in the city of Dunwall, the setting of the first game, with most of the game taking place in Karnaca, "the jewel of the south".&lt;ref name="GM Feature" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Karnaca" /&gt; The change in setting in part was out of a desire to show another corner of the series' Empire. On using both settings, Harvey Smith commented that Arkane felt "we need to start it at home ... and then venture out into an exotic place and come back".&lt;ref name="GM Feature" /&gt; Mitton wanted ''Dishonored 2'' to be a visual "journey to a new city", though keeping the same sensibility of the first game and elements like [[oppression]], [[disease]], [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], and decay.&lt;ref name="PCGPrev" /&gt;

The history of Karnaca reportedly took approximately a year to create. After the creation of the setting's basic outline, the team focused on developing ideas that were inspired from inside the game, rather than from the outside world.&lt;ref name="French History" /&gt; Arkane had [[anthropology]] and [[politics]] in mind when creating the land's history, looking upon the first settlers of the region, the influence of foreign powers taking up residence there, and the different "tides of culture" that shaped the city.&lt;ref name="GI issue" /&gt; An attempt was made to have the game feature various different types of architecture, to reflect these various waves of settlers. The Arkane team worked with [[industrial designer]]s and [[architect]]s in creating Karnaca.&lt;ref name="French History"/&gt;

Based on [[southern Europe]] countries like [[Greece]], [[Italy]] and [[Spain]], Karnaca is warmer and sunnier than Dunwall.&lt;ref name="Karnaca" /&gt; Reference photos were used from a variety of places to help design the city, including [[Cuba]], [[Lyon]] and [[Malibu, California]]. The buildings in Karnaca frequently have flat roofs and more ornate windows.&lt;ref name="GIConcept" /&gt; Photography from the 1920s was examined in order to help build a setting with a historical disposition, using reference websites like [[Shorpy.com]] and looking at the work of [[Agustín Casasola]].&lt;ref name="GIConcept" /&gt; Whereas ''Dishonored'' was largely built on the real world of 1837, ''Dishonored 2'' draws ideas from "the architectural forms, popular fashions, and far-out technologies" of 1851.&lt;ref name="GM Feature" /&gt; Arkane tried to take architectural concerns into account, and considered the effect the wind would have on the way the city developed, with energy being generated by wind turbines.&lt;ref name="PCGPrev" /&gt; [[Level design]]ers and level architects collaborated throughout the entire production as locations were built.&lt;ref name="architect" /&gt; In making Karnaca, a style of [[Art Nouveau]] was applied.&lt;ref name="art nouveau" /&gt;

The developers intended to depict Karnaca as grounded environment to help the city seem as though it could exist in reality.&lt;ref name="GIConcept" /&gt; Arkane wished to avoid what one member dubbed "the ''[[Deus Ex (video game)|Deus Ex]]'' effect"—wherein man-sized vents were placed wherever the game designers felt, often in nonsensical places.&lt;ref name="PCG Interview" /&gt; The team tried to reflect practicalities of everyday life; for instance, a building would have to have some kind of toilet and a guard's placement should make in-world sense.&lt;ref name="French History" /&gt; Colonies in places such as [[Australia]], [[India]] and [[Africa]] were investigated to comprehend the transition of people adapting from the cold climate of Dunwall to areas with a warmer constitution like Karnaca.&lt;ref name="art nouveau" /&gt;

Designing the in-game [[propaganda]], they studied its use in history, finding the same pattern of elements reappearing throughout the centuries. In place of the militarily inspired propaganda of the first game, ''Dishonored 2'' would employ a subtler approach; lavish posters for invariably canceled enterprises meant to aid the people of Serkonos were made to exhibit the nature of tyranny as practised by the Duke of Serkonos and his government. To further detail the world, the narration team would come up with fictitious products and brand names and make advertisements of them.&lt;ref name="product propaganda" /&gt;

== Release ==

The game was formally announced during Bethesda's [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2015]] press conference by ''Dishonored'' co-directors [[Raphaël Colantonio]] and Harvey Smith,&lt;ref name="Polygon: reveal" /&gt; but was leaked the night before during a rehearsal.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer: leak" /&gt; Lucie Minne's clay models, along with other ''Dishonored'' art, were featured on display at [[Art Ludique]] in an exhibit focused on French video games.&lt;ref name="GIConcept" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Museum" /&gt; ''Dishonored 2'' appeared again at [[E3 2016]]. An image for the game by Sergei Kolesov was featured as part of the 2016 Into the Pixel collection.&lt;ref name="pixel kolesov" /&gt; It was [[released to manufacturing]] on 1 November 2016&lt;ref name="golden 1" /&gt; and made available on 11 November 2016.&lt;ref name="Release Date" /&gt; The PC version was [[Tamper resistance|tamper-protected]] by anti-piracy software [[Denuvo]],&lt;ref name="denuvo" /&gt; which was cracked in June 2017 by hacker group SteamPunks.&lt;ref name="cracked" /&gt;

Preordering ''Dishonored 2'' granted players access to the full game a day early.&lt;ref name="Early" /&gt; Bethesda announced a special collector's edition of the game as a pre-order on their online store. The collector's edition included a 13.5 inch replica of Corvo Attano's signature mask, a zinc alloy replica of Emily Kaldwin's ring, a Delilah Kaldwin propaganda poster and a metal collector's edition case for the game disc and manual. Digital bonuses were also included in the form of the Digital Imperial Assassin's Pack, which included additional in-game content. Pre-orders for console versions of the collector's edition came with a copy of ''[[Dishonored#Release|Dishonored: Definitive Edition]]'', a remastered version of the first game for the eighth generation of consoles with all downloadable content included.&lt;ref name="Hillier" /&gt;

In May 2016, Bethesda announced a  ''Dishonored'' tie-in comic miniseries and novel trilogy. The comic mini-series, published by [[Titan Comics]] and written by [[Gordon Rennie]] with art by Andrea Olimpieri and Marcelo Maiolo, consists of four issues, the first of which was published in August 2016. The three official tie-in novels are published by [[Titan Books]], the first of which, ''The Corroded Man'', written by [[Adam Christopher]], was published in September 2016, with the second and third volumes following in 2017.&lt;ref name="TieIn" /&gt; In addition, a [[Dark Horse Comics]]-created artbook, ''The Art of Dishonored 2'', was announced, launching on the same date as the game. An art contest was held over social media—from 28 June to 17 July 2016—with five winning participants being featured in the book.&lt;ref name="Art Book" /&gt; A live-action trailer was released a month prior to its release.&lt;ref name="take action" /&gt; A graphic novel, ''The Peeress and the Price'', was released on 20 February 2018. Written by Michael Moreci, drawn by Andrea Olimpieri and colorized by Mattia Iacono, it was created as a follow-up to the game.&lt;ref name="PCGamer-Feb2018" /&gt;

''Dishonored 2'' received later updates. A [[New Game Plus]] mode was made available on 19 December 2016, which also allows the player access to both protagonists' powers in a single playthrough. Customizable difficulty settings along with a mission-select option were postponed to 23 January 2017 for all platforms.&lt;ref name="this update" /&gt;&lt;ref name="postpwned" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mission-select" /&gt; A standalone expansion, ''[[Dishonored: Death of the Outsider]]'', was released on 15 September 2017. It follows Billie Lurk and Daud the assassin as they embark on a mission to kill the Outsider.&lt;ref name="death of the outsider" /&gt;

==Reception==

===Pre-release===
[[Emily Kaldwin]]'s reveal as player character at E3 2015 drew attention pre-release. [[GamesRadar]] called it one of the event's biggest surprises, noting the rarity of female protagonists.&lt;ref name="female protagonists" /&gt; Both [[GameSpot]] and ''[[The Guardian]]'' commented on the prominence of female player characters in 2015's E3 expo.&lt;ref name="e3 3xpo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="twentyfifteen" /&gt; ''[[Game Informer]]'' called her one of ten "most promising" new characters revealed at the expo.&lt;ref name="one of ten" /&gt; The game's appearance at E3 2016 gained accolades. ''[[IGN]]'' awarded it "Best Xbox One Game", and it was nominated "Game of the Show", "Best PlayStation 4 Game", "Best Action Game", "Best Trailer", and "Best PC Game", being the runner-up to the last of which.&lt;ref name="e3 ign" /&gt;

''Dishonored 2'' was nominated for "Best of Show", "Best Console Game", "Best PC Game" and "Best Action/Adventure Game" at the [[Game Critics Awards]].&lt;ref name="g4me critics 4w4rds" /&gt; ''Game Informer'' awarded the game "Best Multiplatform Game".&lt;ref name="game awarder" /&gt; ''PC Gamer'' gave the game "Best of Show".&lt;ref name="best of show" /&gt; ''[[Eurogamer]]'' selected the game as one of the five best games at E3, highlighting the time-manipulating level and commenting "it's hard to imagine there'll be any game as intricate released this year, nor one quite so imaginative".&lt;ref name="quite so" /&gt;

''Dishonored 2'' received generally favorable reviews according to [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name="MCPC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MCPS4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MCXONE" /&gt; On its release, PC players reported issues with performance such as loss of [[frame rate]] and [[display resolution]], and [[Crash (computing)|system crashes]].&lt;ref name="kotaku reception" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vg247 reception" /&gt; Three patches for the PC version were released to remedy the problem.&lt;ref name="escapist reception" /&gt;&lt;ref name="remedy" /&gt; The levels Clockwork Mansion and A Crack in the Slab were singled out to considerable praise.&lt;ref name="GI" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PCGUS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="clockwork club" /&gt;&lt;ref name="clocktaku" /&gt; The game has been the recipient of over one hundred Best of 2016 awards.&lt;ref name="recipient" /&gt;

Chris Carter of [[Destructoid]] considered the stealth approach "glorious"; the heart item one of his favorite ways to be exposed to further content; the puzzles and traversal challenges demanding; and the task of becoming a better assassin rewarding. The only complaints concerned shortcomings in [[frame rate]] capabilities on the [[Xbox One]] console, "stilted voice acting and script issues, despite the compelling narrative".&lt;ref name="Destruct" /&gt; [[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'s Nick Plessas wrote that ''Dishonored 2'' "[recreates] many of the positive experiences from the previous instalment, but [requires] much greater effort on the part of the player this time around to achieve it". According to Plessas, the game's emotional substance was derived from the player character as coupled with the choices and their consequences to the story, though he was moved significantly more by the "smaller moments" of the game than the finale.&lt;ref name="EGM" /&gt;

Writing for ''Game Informer'', Matt Bertz thought the balance between low-chaos and high-chaos play styles held an improved competence from the original game and that each approach availed thought-provoking scenarios to be solved. Each character's abilities were praised as "equally useful". Bertz disparaged the main story beats however, calling them "rushed and underdeveloped", whilst lauding the environmental storytelling.&lt;ref name="GI" /&gt; James Kozanitis at [[Game Revolution]] enjoyed playing as Emily Kaldwin the most and said that, because some elements from ''Dishonored'' had returned, Emily infused a fresh perspective into the overall experience. Kozanitis favored the stealthier approach, which was said to better accommodate side quests—opined as the chief incentive for playing ''Dishonored 2''.&lt;ref name="GameRev" /&gt; ''GameSpot''{{'}}s Scott Butterworth was satisfied with the use of weapons and observed that the sophisticated behavior patterns of the [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|artificial intelligence (AI)]] rendered into "fun" experimentation, especially for stealth employment. The lack of increasing challenges was subject to criticism, with Butterworth lamenting the "underutilized" new enemies; the plot met charges of reproval for the same reason. Conversely, one quest involving time manipulation was declared a "masterpiece unto itself" and another in a [[clockwork]]-driven mansion was labeled as "mind-bending".&lt;ref name="GSpot" /&gt;

Lucas Sullivan of ''GamesRadar'' complimented its [[sense of place]], supernatural abilities and execution, but disapproved of the character development and constraint of a number of mechanics that were otherwise "brilliant".&lt;ref name="GRadar" /&gt; ''GamesRadar'' remarked in the days following that the Clockwork Mansion mission exemplified the best of Arkane Studios' "rich, intricate level design".&lt;ref name="clockwork radar" /&gt; ''IGN''{{'}}s Lucy O'Brien felt the decision to allocate powers and story details between the two player characters was "smart", echoing the view that the characters' abilities were "excellently" adaptable to both play styles. She commended the level design for distinguishing each level in terms of providing unique gameplay mechanics and expressed admiration for the game world's "gorgeous, painterly aesthetic".&lt;ref name="IGN" /&gt; Phil Savage, writing for ''PC Gamer'', stated that "At its worst, it offers a similar experience to its predecessor, which is to say, it offers tens of hours of extraordinary first-person stealth and action".&lt;ref name="PCGUS" /&gt; ''PC Gamer'' later recognized the Clockwork Mansion as one of the best levels of 2016.&lt;ref name="clockwork gamer" /&gt; ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]''{{'}}s Arthur Gies noted the combat system as "improved and refined", the setting as "''Dishonored 2''{{'}}s greatest inherited strength" and the AI units for their "excellent peripheral vision", yet regarded the inability to replay missions and the absence of a [[New Game Plus]] option as "possible deal-breakers".&lt;ref name="Poly" /&gt; Alice Bell at ''VideoGamer.com'' wrote in her verdict, "''Dishonored 2'' takes everything you loved about ''Dishonored'' and improves upon it without becoming bloated. It's a beautifully designed, layered game, stuffed with hidden gems and secret stories. Also you can stab people in mid air".&lt;ref name="VG" /&gt;

===Sales===
''Dishonored 2'' was the fourth best-selling game in its first week of release, but the launch week sales dropped thirty-eight percent when compared with the original game, although only sales of physical copies were recorded.&lt;ref name="fourth best" /&gt;&lt;ref name="first week" /&gt; That same week, the game had sold the most pre-orders on [[Steam (software)|Steam]] and was ranked sixth in overall sales.&lt;ref name="dry ice" /&gt; It was the seventh best-selling retail video game in the UK in its second week of release, according to [[Chart-Track]], a fifty-two percent decrease from the first week – similar to that of its predecessor.&lt;ref name="chart-track" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fifty-two percent" /&gt; After a reduction in cost, ''Dishonored 2'' re-entered the UK charts in the fourth week of May 2017, ranked in 8th place with a 1,267 percent rise in sales.&lt;ref name="re-entered" /&gt;

'''Dombyra Party''' ({{lang-kk|Домбыра Party, Домбыра пати}}) — is a [[flash mob]]-like movement of [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]] youth to popularize Kazakh national [[musical instruments]], especially [[dombyra]]. The movement is non-political.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yvision.kz/post/354949 Домбыра party: «Күй ойнайды қазағымның қанында»]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dombyra Parties are usually held on weekdays in crowded alleys or at parks. They have occurred in [[Astana]], [[Almaty]], [[Shymkent]] and [[Atyrau]] and others. At the weekly events, attendants mainly play dombyra and sing dombyra-accompanied songs. One of the features of dombyra parties is to prove that anyone can learn to play the instrument without studying at music schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://talgam.kz/?p=282 Домбыра Рarty!] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140314060100/http://talgam.kz/?p=282 |date=March 14, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Invitations to Dombyra parties are sent via [[social networks]]. Video recordings are shared via video portals and social media. A Facebook group allows users to discuss issues related to organizational staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{facebook |id=319847841473949}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The Dombyra party was initiated by Kazakh [[blog]]gers, using the "KerekInfo" platform in 2012. The first event took place on August 12 in Astana. Since then, Dombyra Parties have been held in almost every big city, as well as in [[Istanbul]], [[London]], [[Berlin]] and [[Porto]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130726223104/http://www.aikyn.kz/news/view/26245 «Домбыра party» халықаралық шараға айналды - Dombyra Party has become an international trend]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Educational inequality''' is the unequal distribution of academic resources, including but not limited to; school funding, qualified and experienced teachers, books, and technologies to socially excluded communities. These communities tend to be historically disadvantaged and oppressed. More times than not, individuals belonging to these [[Marginalized group|marginalized]] groups are also denied access to the schools with abundant resources. Inequality leads to major differences in the educational success or efficiency of these individuals and ultimately suppresses [[social mobility|social]] and [[economic mobility]]. ''See Statistic sections for more information.''

Measuring educational efficacy varies by country and even provinces/states within the country. Generally, grades, [[Grade point average|GPA]] scores, test scores, dropout rates, college entrance statistics, and college completion rates are used to measure educational success. These are measures of an individual's academic performance ability.  When determining what should be measured in terms of the educational success of an individual, many scholars and academics suggest that GPAs, test scores, and other measures of performance ability are not the only useful tools in determining efficacy.&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt; In addition to academic performance, attainment of learning objectives, acquisition of desired skills and competencies, satisfaction, persistence, and post-college performance should all be measured and accounted for when determining the educational success of individuals. Scholars argue that academic achievement is only the direct result of attaining learning objectives and acquiring desired skills and competencies. To accurately measure educational efficacy, it is imperative to separate academic achievement because it captures only a student's performance ability and not necessarily their learning or ability to effectively use what they have learned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=York, Rankin, &amp; Gibson|first=Travis T., Susan &amp; Charles|year=2015|title=Defining and Measuring Academic Success|url=|journal=Practical Assessment, Research &amp; Evaluation|volume= 20| issue = 5, March 2015|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of educational inequality is attributed to [[economic]] disparities that often falls along [[racial]] lines and much modern conversation about [[educational equity]] conflates the two, showing how they are inseparable from residential location and, more recently, language.&lt;ref name="Lee and Orfield"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=Chungmei|author2=Gary Orfield|title=Why Segregation Matters: Poverty and Educational Inequality|journal=The Civil Rights Project|year=2005|series=Harvard University|pages=1–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Educational inequality between white students and minority students continues to perpetuate [[social inequality|social]] and [[economic inequality]].&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;Williams, Belinda, ed. [https://books.google.com/books?id=B4Aw038aah4C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Closing the Achievement Gap: A Vision for Changing Beliefs and Practices]. 2nd ed. Alexandria, VA: Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the world, there have been continuous attempts to reform education at all levels.&lt;ref name="Haycock"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haycock|first=Kafi|title=Closing the Achievement Gap|journal=Helping All Students Achieve|year=2001|volume=58|pages=6–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; With different causes that are deeply rooted in history, society, and culture, this inequality is difficult to eradicate. Although difficult, education is vital to society's movement forward. It promotes "[[citizenship]], identity, equality of opportunity and social inclusion, social cohesion as well as economic growth and employment" and for these reasons, equality is widely promoted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shrivastava|first1=Meenal|last2=Shrivastava|first2=Sanjiv|title=Political economy of higher education: comparing South Africa to trends in the world|journal=Higher Education|date=June 2014|volume=67|issue=6|pages=809–822|doi=10.1007/s10734-013-9709-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unequal educational outcomes are attributed to several variables, including family of origin, gender, and social class. Achievement, earnings, health status, and political participation also contribute to [[Educational inequality in the United States|educational inequality within the United States]] and other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ferreira|first1=Francisco|last2=Gignoux|first2=Jeremie|title=The Measurement of Educational Inequality: Achievement and Opportunity|journal=World Bank Economic Review|date=2014|volume=28|issue=2|pages=210–246|doi=10.1093/wber/lht004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family background==
In [[Harvard University|Harvard's]] "Civil Rights Project", Lee and Orfield identify family background as the most influential factor in student achievement.&lt;ref name="Lee and Orfield" /&gt; A correlation exists between the academic success of parents with the academic success of their children. Only 11% of children from the bottom fifth earn a college degree while 80% of the top fifth earn one.&lt;ref name="Haskins and Kemple"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haskins|first=Ron|author2=James Kemple|title=A New Goal for America's High Schools: College Preparation for All|journal=The Future of Children|year=2009|volume=19|pages=1–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Linked with resources, white students tend to have more educated parents than students from minority families.&lt;ref name="Gamoran"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gamoran|first=Adam|year=2001|title=American Schooling and Educational Inequality: A Forecast for the 21st Century|journal=Sociology of Education|volume=74|pages=135–153|doi=10.2307/2673258|jstor=2673258}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This translates to a home-life that is more supportive of educational success. This often leads to them receiving more at-home help, have more books in their home, attend more libraries, and engage in more intellectually intensive conversations.&lt;ref name=Gamoran /&gt; Children, then, enter school at different levels. Poor students are behind in verbal memory, vocabulary, math and reading achievement, and have more behavior problems.&lt;ref name=Greenstone /&gt;  This leads to their placement in different level classes that tracks them.&lt;ref name="Farkas"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Farkas|first=George|title=How Educational Inequality Develops|journal=National Poverty Center|year=2006|series=Working Paper Series|pages=1–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; These courses almost always demand less from their students, creating a group that is conditioned to lack educational drive.&lt;ref name=Haycock /&gt;  These courses are generally non-college bound and are taught by less qualified teachers.&lt;ref name=Williams /&gt;

Also, family background influences cultural knowledge and perceptions. [[Middle class]] knowledge of norms and customs allows students with this background to better navigate the school system.&lt;ref name=Gamoran /&gt;  Parents from this class and above also have social networks that prove to be more beneficial than networks based in lower classes. These connections may help students gain access to the right schools, activities, etc.&lt;ref name=Gamoran /&gt;  Additionally, children from poorer families, who are often minorities, come from families that distrust institutions.&lt;ref name=Gamoran /&gt; America's history of racism and discrimination has created a perceived and/or existent ceiling on opportunities for many poor and minority citizens. This ceiling muffles academic inspirations and muffles growth.&lt;ref name=Gamoran /&gt;

The recent and drastic increase of [[Latino]] immigrants has created another major factor in educational inequality. As more and more students come from families where [[English language|English]] is not spoken at home, they often struggle with overcoming a language barrier in addition to simply learning subjects.&lt;ref name="Lee and Orfield" /&gt;  They more frequently lack assistance at home because it is common for the parents to not understand the work that is in English.&lt;ref name=Farkas /&gt;

Furthermore, research reveals summer months as crucial time for the educational development of children. Students from disadvantaged families experience greater losses in skills during summer vacation.&lt;ref name=Greenstone /&gt;  Students from lower [[socioeconomic]] classes come disproportionately from single-parent homes and dangerous neighborhoods.&lt;ref name=Haycock /&gt; 15% of white children are raised in single-parent homes and 10% of Asian children are. 27% of Latinos are raised in single-parent homes and 54% of African American children are.&lt;ref name=Farkas /&gt; Less resources, less parental attention, and more stress all influence the performance of children in school.

==Gender==
{{see also|Sex differences in education}}
Throughout the world, educational achievement varies by gender.  The exact relationship differs across cultural and national contexts.

===Female disadvantage===
Obstacles preventing females' ability to receive a quality education include traditional attitudes towards [[gender roles]], poverty, [[geographical isolation]], [[gender-based violence]], and early marriage and pregnancy.&lt;ref name="UNESCO girls"&gt;{{cite web|title=Women and Girls Education|url=http://en.unesco.org/themes/women-and-girls-education|website=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the world, there is an estimated 7 million more girls than boys out of school. This  "girls gap" is concentrated in several countries including [[Somalia]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Togo]], the [[Central African Republic]] and [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, girls are outnumbered two to one.&lt;ref name="Learning Outcomes Africa"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ekine |first1=Adefunke |last2=Samati |first2=Madalo |last3=Walker |first3=Judith-Ann |title=Improving Learning Opportunities and Outcomes for Girls in Africa |url=http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Research/Files/Reports/2013/12/improving%20learning%20outcomes%20girls%20africa/WalkerEkineSamatiweb.pdf |website=Brookings Institution |accessdate=13 November 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129035541/http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Research/Files/Reports/2013/12/improving%20learning%20outcomes%20girls%20africa/WalkerEkineSamatiweb.pdf |archivedate=29 November 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Socialized gender roles affect females' access to education. For example, in [[Nigeria]], children are socialized into their specific gender role as soon as their parents know their gender. Men are the preferred gender and are encouraged to engage in [[Computer education|computer]] and scientific learning while the women learn domestic skills. These gender roles are deep rooted within the state, however, with the increase of westernized education within Nigeria, there has been a recent increase in women having the ability to receive an equal education. There is still much to be changed, though. Nigeria still needs policies that encourage educational attainment for men and women based on merit, rather than gender.&lt;ref name="Gender Equality in Nigeria"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Okonkowo|first1=Ejike|title=Attitude towards Gender Equality in South-eastern Nigerian Culture: Impact of Gender and Level of Education|journal=Gender &amp; Behavior|date=Dec 2013|volume=11|issue=2|pages=5579–5585}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Females are shown to be at risk of being attacked in at least 15 countries.&lt;ref name="Girls edu Brookings" /&gt; Attacks can occur because individuals within those countries do not believe women should receive an education. Attacks include kidnappings, bombings, torture, rape and murder. In [[Somalia]], girls have been abducted. In [[Colombia]], the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and [[Libya]] students were reported to have been raped and harassed.&lt;ref name="Girls edu Brookings" /&gt; In [[Pakistan]] and Afghanistan, schools and busses have been bombed and gassed.&lt;ref name="Girls edu Brookings" /&gt;

Early marriage affects females' ability to receive an education.

"The gap separating men and women in the job market remains wide in many countries, whether in the North or the South. With marginal variables between most countries, women have a lower employment rate, are unemployed longer, are paid less and have less secure jobs."&lt;ref name=Sharma&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sharma|first1=Geeta|title=Gender inequality in education and employment|url=http://yesweb.org/summit/sessions/op.inequality.doc}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Young women, particularly suffer double discrimination. First for being young, in the difficult phase of transition between training and working life, in an age group that has, on an average, twice the jobless rate or older workers and are at the mercy of employers who exploit them under the pretext of enabling them to acquire professional experience. Secondly they are discriminated against for being women and are more likely to be offered low paying or low status jobs."&lt;ref name=Sharma/&gt;  "Discrimination is still very much in evidence and education and training policies specially targeting young women are needed to restore a balance."&lt;ref name=Sharma/&gt; "Although young women are increasingly choosing typically 'male' professions, they remain over-represented in traditionally female jobs, such as [[secretaries]], [[nurses]], and under represented in jobs with responsibility and the professions."&lt;ref name=Sharma/&gt;

In early grades, boys and girls perform equally in [[mathematics]] and [[science]], but boys score higher on advanced mathematics assessments such as the SAT college entrance examination.&lt;ref name=Banks/&gt;  Girls are also less likely to participate in class discussions and more likely to be silent in the classroom.&lt;ref name=Banks/&gt;  Some believe that females have a way of thinking and learning that is different than males.  Belenky and colleagues (1986) conducted research which found that there was an inconsistency between the kind of knowledge appealing to women and the kind of knowledge being taught in most educational institutions.&lt;ref name=Banks/&gt; Another researcher, Gilligan (1982), found that the knowledge appealing to females was caring, interconnection, and sensitivity to the needs of others, while males found separation and individualism appealing.&lt;ref name=Banks/&gt;  Females are more field dependent, or group oriented, than males, which could explain why they may experience problems in schools that primarily teach using an individualistic learning environment.&lt;ref name=Banks/&gt;

===Male disadvantage===

In 51 countries, girls are enrolled at higher rates than boys. Particularly in [[Latin America]], the difference is attributed to prominence of gangs and violence attracting male youth. The gangs pull the males in, distracting them from school and causing them to drop out.&lt;ref name="Girls edu Brookings"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Winthrop|first1=Rebecca|last2=McGivney|first2=Eileen|title=Girls' Education Hotspots: A look at the Data|url=http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/education-plus-development/posts/2014/09/22-girls-education-winthrop|website=Brookings Institution|publisher=Brookings Institution|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some countries, female high school and graduation rates are higher than for males.&lt;ref name=Banks/&gt; In the United States for example, 33% more bachelor's degrees were conferred on females than males in 2010–2011.&lt;ref name="NCES"&gt;National Center for Education Statistics, [http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d12/tables/dt12_310.asp Digest of Education Statistics].  Retrieved 2017-09-09&lt;/ref&gt; This gap is projected to increase to 37% by 2021–2022, and is over 50% for master's and associate degrees. Dropout rates for males has also increased over the years in all racial groups, especially in [[African Americans]]. They have exceeded the number of high school and college dropout rates than any other racial ethnicity for the past 30 years.  A majority of the research found that males were primarily the most "left behind" in education because of higher graduation dropout rates, lower test scores, and failing grades. They found that as males get older, primarily from ages 9 to 17, they are less likely to be labeled "proficient" in reading and mathematics than girls were.

In general, males arrive in [[kindergarten]] much less ready and prepared for schooling than females. This creates a gap that continually increases over time into middle and high school. Nationally, there are 113 boys in 9th grade for every 100 girls, and among African American males, there are 123 boys for every 100 girls. States have discovered that 9th grade has become one of the biggest drop out years.&lt;ref name="Whitmire &amp; Bailey"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitmire|first1=Richard|last2=Bailey|first2=Susan|title=Gender Gap|url=http://educationnext.org/gender-gap/|website=Education Next}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Whitmire and Bailey continued their research and looked at the potential for any gender gap change when males and females were faced with the decision of potentially going to college. Females were more likely to go to college and receive bachelor's degrees than males were. From 1971 to about 1981, women were the less fortunate and had lower reported numbers of bachelor's degrees. However, since 1981, males have been at a larger disadvantage and the gap between males and females keeps increasing.&lt;ref name="Whitmire &amp; Bailey" /&gt;

Boys are more likely to be disciplined than girls, and are also more likely to be classified as [[learning disabled]].&lt;ref name=Banks/&gt; Males of color, especially African American males, experience a high rate of disciplinary actions and suspensions.  In 2012, one in five African American males received an out of school suspension.&lt;ref name=CRDC&gt;{{cite web|title=Civil Rights Data Collection(CRDC)|url=http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/crdc-2012-data-summary.pdf|website=Office for Civil Rights|accessdate=2 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Asia, males are expected to be the main financial contributor of the family. So many of them go to work right after they become adults physically, which means at the age around 15 to 17. This is the age they should obtain high school education.

Males get worse grades than females do regardless of year or country examined in most subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Voyer and Susan D.

== Race ==

=== United States ===
Race and ethnics have played a major role in the inequalities of the American Education system.

"Since its inception, public education in the United States has been beset with questions of which racial or ethnic group should be granted access to schooling."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lewis-Mccoy|first=R. L'Heureux|date=|title=Race and Education|url=|journal=Wiley-Blackwell Encyclopedia of Sociology|volume=2nd Edition|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early 18th century in most states African-American students and Mexican American students were barred from attending schools with White Students. This was due to the post effects of the court case ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'' (1896) where it was decided that educational facilities were allowed to segregate white students from students of color as long as the educational facilities were considered equal. Educational facilities did not follow the federal mandate, in a studies through taken from 1890 to 1950 of Southern States per pupil expenditures (1950s dollars) on instruction varied from Whites to Blacks. On average White students received 17–70 percent more educational expenditures than their Black counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Race and Schooling in the South, 1880–1950: An Economic History|last=Mago|first=Robert|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1990|isbn=0-226-50510-3|location=|pages=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Federal legal challenge of these unequal segregated educational systems would occur in California ''[[Mendez v. Westminster]]'' in 1947 followed by ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' in 1954. The decision of ''Brown v. Board of Education'' would lead to the desegregation of schools by federal law, but the years of lower education, segregation of household salaries between whites and people of color, and [[racial wealth gap]]s would leave people of color at a disadvantage to seek proper equal education for generations to come.

Differences of academic skills in children of different race starts at an early age, according to [[National Assessment of Educational Progress]] there is a remaining gap showing Black and Latino children being able to demonstrate cognitive proficiency compared to their White counterparts. In the data 89 percent of White children presented the ability to understand written and spoken words while only 79 and 78 percent of Black and Latino children were able to comprehend written and spoken words the trend would continue into ages 4–6.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Experts believe that the racial differences in academic achievement fall under three major categories: genetic, cultural, and structural. For example, in the 1980s minorities experienced a cultural phenomenon called "fear of acting White", minorities would shun and ridicule those in their social groups who had shown a higher intelligence than others. Shown in a graph comparing popularity to grade point average among Blacks, Latinos, and Whites  built based on data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health popularity of White students increased as their grades increased, for Black and Latino students popularity would drop as grades would rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://educationnext.org/actingwhite/|title="Acting White" – Education Next|date=2006-06-22|work=Education Next|access-date=2017-05-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Race and ethnics will continue to play a major role in the disbursement of education through the American public school system, through diversity placement programs such as [[Seizing Every Opportunity|SEO]] and [[Management Leadership for Tomorrow|MLT]], grants and social and cultural changes the education gap has slowly been closing between Whites and minorities in more recent years.

==Latino students and college preparednessess==
===Latino migration===

In the United States, Latinos are the largest growing population. As of July 1, 2016, Latinos make up 17.8 percent of the U.S. population, making them the largest minority.&lt;ref&gt;  U.S. Census Bureau. 2017. Annual Estimates of the Resident Population by Sex, Age, Race, and Hispanic Origin for the United States and States: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2016
&lt;/ref&gt; People from Latin America migrate to the United States due to their inability to obtain stability, whether it is financial stability or refugee. Their homeland is either dealing with an economic crisis or is involved in a war. The United States capitalizes on the migration of Latin American migrants. With the disadvantage of their legal status, American businesses employ them and pay them an extremely low wage.&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez, J. (2011). Harvest of Empire: A History of Latinos in America. New York, New York: Penguin Books.&lt;/ref&gt;  As 2013, 87% of undocumented men and 57% undocumented women were a part of the U.S. economy.&lt;ref&gt;Capps, R., Bachmeier, J. D., Fix, M., &amp; Van Hook, J. (2013). A demographic, socioeconomic,
and health coverage profile of unauthorized immigrants in the United
States. Washington, DC: Migration Policy Institute.
&lt;/ref&gt;
Diaspora plays a role in Latinos migrating to the United States. Diaspora is the dispersion of any group from their original homeland.&lt;ref&gt;Quayson, A. and Daswani, G. (2013) Introduction – Diaspora and Transnationalism, in A Companion to Diaspora and Transnationalism (eds A. Quayson and G. Daswani), Blackwell Publishing Ltd, Oxford, UK. doi: 10.1002/9781118320792.ch1
&lt;/ref&gt; New York City holds a substantial quota of the Latino population. More than 2.4 million Latinos inhabit New York City,&lt;ref name="NYC Planning"&gt;NYC Planning. 2017. Population Facts. Retrieved from https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/nyc-population/population-facts.page
&lt;/ref&gt; its largest Latino population being [[Puerto Ricans]] followed by Dominicans.&lt;ref name="NYC Planning"/&gt; The large number of Latinos contributes to the statistic of at least four million of United States born children having one immigrant parent.&lt;ref name=Bradeck&gt; Bradeck, K.M., Sibley, E., Lykes, M.B. (2016). Authorized and Unauthorized Immigrant Parents: The Impact of Legal Vulnerability on Family Contexts.  Hispanic Journal of Behavioral Sciences. 30 (1). 3–30. doi: 10.1 177/0739986315621741
&lt;/ref&gt;
Children of immigrant origin are the fastest growing population in the United States. One in every four children come from immigrant families.&lt;ref&gt; Hernandez, D.J, Denton, N.A., Macartney, S.E. (2008). Children in Immigrant Families: Looking to America's Future. Social Policy Report. &lt;/ref&gt; Many Latino communities are constructed around immigrant origins in which play a big part in society. The growth in children of immigrant parents does not go unaware, in a way society and the government accepts it. For example, many undocumented/immigrants can file taxes, children who attend college can provide parents information to obtain financial aid, parent(s) may be eligible for government help through the child, etc. Yet, the lack of knowledge regarding post-secondary education financial help increases the gap of Latino children to restrain from obtaining higher education.

===Education===

In New York City, Mayor De Balsio has implemented 3-K for All, which every child can attend pre-school at the age of three, free of charge.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, K. (2017, April 24) New York City Will Offer Free Preschool for All 3-Year-Olds. New York Times. Retrieved from https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/24/nyregion/de-blasio-pre-k-expansion.html
&lt;/ref&gt; Although children education is free from K-12 grade, many children with immigrant parents do not take advantage of all the primary education benefits. Children who come from a household that contains at least one immigrant parent, are less likely to attend childhood or preschool programs.&lt;ref name=Bradeck/&gt;

===College preparation===

The preparation of college access to children born in America from immigrant parents pertaining to Latino communities is a complex process. The beginning of junior year through senior year in high school consists of preparation to college research and application process. For government help towards college tuition such as Financial Aid and Taps, parents or guardian's personal information is needed, this is where doubt and anticipation unravels. Majority of immigrant parents/guardians do not have most of the qualifications required for the application. The focus is to portray the way immigrants and their American born child work around the education system to attain college education.
Due to the influx of the Latino population, there amount of Latino high school students graduates has increased as well.&lt;ref name="Snyder2012"&gt;Snyder, T. D., &amp; Dillow, S. A. (2012). Digest of education statistics 2011 (NCES 2012-001). Washington, DC: U.S. Department of Education.
&lt;/ref&gt; Latino students are mainly represented in two-year rather than four-year institutions.&lt;ref name="Snyder2012"/&gt; This can occur for two reasons: the cost reduction of attending a two-year institution or its close proximity to home.&lt;ref&gt;Mattern, K., &amp; Wyatt, J. (2009). Student choice of college: How far do students go for an education? Journal of College Admission, 203, 18–29.&lt;/ref&gt;
Young teens with desire to obtain a higher education clash with some limitations due to parent's/guardian's personal information.&lt;ref name=Bradeck/&gt; Many children lack public assistance due to lack of English proficiency of parents which is difficult to fill out forms or applications or simply due to the parent's fear of giving personal information that could identify their status, the same concept applies to Federal Student Aid. Federal Student Aid comes from the federal government in which helps a student pay for educational expenses of college in three possible formats, grant, work-study, and loan. One step of the Federal Aid application requires one or both parent/guardian personal information as well as financial information. This may limit the continuance of the application due to the fear of providing personal information. The chances of young teens entering college reduces when personal information from parents are not given.
Many young teens with immigrant parents are part of the minority group in which income is not sufficient to pay college tuition or repay loans with interest. The concept of college as highly expensive makes Latino students less likely to attend a four-year institution or even attend postsecondary education. Approximately 50% of Latinos received financial aid in 2003–2004, but they are still the minority who received the lowest average of federal award.&lt;ref name=Excelencia &gt; Excelencia in Education. (2005). How Latino students pay for college. Retrieved from https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED506050.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, loans are not typically granted to them.&lt;ref name=Excelencia/&gt;

===Standardized tests===

In addition to finance scarcity, standardized test are required when applying to a four-year post educational institution. In the United States, the two examinations that are normally taken are the SATs and ACTs. Latino students do generally take the exam, but from 2011 to 2015, there has been a 50% increase in the number of Latino students taking the ACTs.&lt;ref&gt;ACT. (2015). The Condition of College &amp; Career Readiness 2015: Hispanic Students. Retrieved from http://www.act.org/content/dam/act/unsecured/documents/06-24-16-Subcon-Hispanic-Report.pdf
&lt;/ref&gt; As for the SATs, in 2017, 24% of the test takers were identified with Latino/Hispanic. Out of that percentage, only 31 percent met the college-readiness benchmark for both portions of the test (ERW and Math).&lt;ref&gt;College Board. (2017). 2017 SAT Suite Annual Report Total Group.

==Gifted and talented education==
There is a disproportionate percentage of middle and upper-class White students labeled as [[Gifted student|gifted]] and talented compared to lower-class, minority students.&lt;ref name=Banks&gt;{{cite book|last1=Banks|first1=James|title=Multicultural Education: Issues and Perspectives|date=2013|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|chapter=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, [[Asian American]] students have been over-represented in gifted education programs.&lt;ref name=Ford&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ford|first1=Donna|title=The Underrepresentation of Minority Students in Gifted Education: Problems and Promises in Recruitment and Retention|journal=The Journal of Special Education|date=1998|volume=32|issue=1|pages=4–14|doi=10.1177/002246699803200102}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1992, African Americans were underrepresented in gifted education by 41%, Hispanic American students by 42%, and [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] by 50%.  Conversely, White students were over-represented in gifted education programs by 17% and Asian American minority students being labeled as gifted and talented, but research shows that there is a growing [[racial achievement gap in the United States|achievement gap between white students and students of color]].  There is also a growing gap between gifted students from low-income background and higher-income background.&lt;ref name=NAGC&gt;{{cite web|title=Including diverse learners in gifted education programs and services|url=http://www.nagc.org/resources-publications/resources/timely-topics/including-diverse-learners-gifted-education-programs|website=National Association for Gifted Children|accessdate=2 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The reasons for the under-representation of African American, Hispanic American, and American Indian students in gifted and talented programs can be explained by (a) recruitment issues/screening and identifying; and (b) personnel issues.&lt;ref name=Ford /&gt;  In regards to screening and identifying gifted and talented students, most states use a standardized achievement and aptitude test, which minority students have a history of performing poorly on.  Arguments against standardized tests claim that they are culturally biased, favoring White students, require a certain mastery of the English language, and can lack cultural sensitivity in terms of format and presentation.&lt;ref name=Ford /&gt;  In regards to personnel issues, forty-six states use teacher nominations, but many teachers are not trained in identifying or teaching gifted students.  Teachers also tend to have lower expectations of minority students, even if they are identified as gifted.  Forty-five states allow for parental nominations, but the nomination form is not sensitive to cultural differences and minority parents can have difficulty understanding the form. Forty-two states allow self nomination, but minority students tend not to self nominate because of social-emotional variables like peer pressure or feeling isolated or rejected by peers.&lt;ref name=Ford /&gt;  Additionally, some students are identified as gifted and talented simply because they have parents with the knowledge, political skills, and power to require schools to classify their child as gifted and talented.  Therefore, providing their child with special instruction and enrichment.&lt;ref name=Banks/&gt;  Schools should make sure that students from all social-class, cultural, language, and ethnic groups have an equal opportunity to participate in gifted and talented programs.&lt;ref name=Banks/&gt;

===Recommendations===
There are many recommendations for recruiting and retaining minority students in gifted and talented education programs.  It is important that the instruments used to screen students are valid, reliable, and sensitive to students from diverse cultural backgrounds.  There should also be multiple types ([[quantitative research|quantitative]], [[qualitative research|qualitative]], [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective]], [[subjectivity|subjective]]) and sources (teachers, parents, students) of information used in the screening process.&lt;ref name=Ford /&gt;  Minority students who come from less rigorous schools and classrooms should be provided with support services and educational opportunities to help them be successful.  An example would be classes that focus on study skills or time management skills.&lt;ref name=Ford /&gt;  Teachers should attend professional development opportunities and be trained in teaching and working with minority students.  More specifically, teachers should attend professional development that addresses the characteristics and behaviors of underrepresented gifted populations, awareness of cultural differences, children with multiple exceptionalities, developing positive peer culture in the classroom and school, and equitable and unbiased assessments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Classroom Instruction and Teacher Training for Gifted Students from Diverse Populations|url=http://www.nagc.org/resources-publications/resources/timely-topics/ensuring-diverse-learner-participation-gifted-1|website=National Association for Gifted Children|accessdate=2 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There should also be an increase in family involvement in the classroom and school, along with family involvement in the screening process.&lt;ref name=Ford /&gt; It is important to implement programs to keep students in school as they come of age and need to work so they can provide for their family. These programs should help students stay in school and provide a path to a career instead of having to go to work when they are old enough, which is a major barrier students of low income families face.

==Special education==
In addition to the unbalanced scale of gender disproportionality in formal education, students with "[[special needs]]" comprise yet another facet of educational inequality.  Prior to the 1975 passing of the [[Education for All Handicapped Children Act]] (currently known as the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] (IDEA)) approximately 2 million children with special needs were not receiving sufficient public education.  Of those that were within the academic system, many were reduced to lower standards of teaching, isolated conditions, or even removal from school buildings altogether and relocated out of peer circulation.&lt;ref name=Losen&gt;{{cite book|last1=Losen|first1=Daniel J|last2=Orfield|first2=Gary|title=Racial Inequality in Special Education|date=2002|publisher=Harvard Education Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The passing of this bill effectively changed the lives of millions of special needs students, ensuring that they have free access to quality public education facilities and services.  And while there are those that benefit from the turning of this academic tide, there are still many students (most of which are minorities with disabilities) that find themselves in times of learning hardship due to the unbalanced distribution of special education funding.

In 1998 1.5 million minority children were identified with special learning needs in the US, out of that 876,000 were [[African Americans|African American]] or [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]].  [[African Americans|African American]] students were 3 times as likely to be labeled as special needs than that of [[White people|Caucasians]].  Students who both are special education students and of a minority face unequal chances for a quality education to meet their personal needs.  Special education referrals are, in most cases in the hands of the general education teacher, this is subjective and because of differences, disabilities can be overlooked or unrecognized.  Poorly trained teachers at minority schools, poor school relationships, and poor parent-to-teacher relationships play a role in this inequality.  With these factors, minority students are at a disadvantage because they are not given the appropriate resources that would in turn benefit their educational needs.&lt;ref name=Losen /&gt;

[[US Department of Education]] data shows that in 2000–2001 at least 13 states exhibited more than 2.75% of African American students enrolled in public schools with the label of "[[mental retardation]]". At that time national averages of caucasians labeled with the same moniker came in at 0.75%.  During this period no Individual state rose over 2.32% of caucasian students with special needs.&lt;ref name=Losen /&gt;

According to Tom Parrish, a senior research analyst with the [[American Institutes for Research]], African American children are 2.88 times more likely to be labeled as "mentally retarded", and 1.92 times more likely to be labeled as emotionally disturbed than Caucasian children.  This information was calculated by data gathered from the [[United States Department of Education|US Department of Education]].&lt;ref name=Losen /&gt;  It illustrates how even within a system that has progressed so much over the years, specifically due to industry recognition and public attention in forms such as government and private funding, aspects as archaic as race discrimination are still prevalent within these institutional walls.

Researchers Edward Fierros and [[James Conroy (researcher)|James Conroy]], in their study of district level data regarding the issue of minority over-representation, have suggested that many states may be mistaken with their current projections and that disturbing minority based trends may be hidden within the numbers.  According to the Individuals with [[Disability discrimination act|Disabilities Act]] students with special needs are entitled to facilities and support that cater to their individual needs, they should not be automatically isolated from their peers or from the benefits of general education.  However, according to Fierros and Conroy, once minority children such as African Americans and Latinos are labeled as students with special needs they are far less likely than caucasians to be placed in settings of inclusive learning and often receive less desirable treatment overall.&lt;ref name=Losen /&gt;

This problem of [[racial segregation]] amongst minority students with special needs is an ongoing battle in need of resolution.  While historically there has been no ironclad solution to righting the wrongs of racial prejudices, there are ways in which we can all individually begin the process of equality within our educational institutions.  Organizations such as the US Department of Education provide resources that we as teachers, students, parents, and concerned individuals can utilize in order to better educate ourselves on the current issues and services regarding special needs education.  One such resource is the [[Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services|Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS)]] which provides links to currently debated topics, programs, initiatives, reports and resources as well support services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services|url=http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/osers/osep/index.html|website=US Department of Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of educational oppression ==

===United States of America (US)===
{{main|Educational inequality in the United States}}
The historical relationships in the United States between privileged and marginalized communities' play a major role in the administering of unequal and inadequate education to these socially excluded communities. The belief that certain communities in the United States were inferior in comparison to others has allowed these disadvantages to foster into the great magnitude of educational inequality that we see apparent today.

For African Americans, deliberate systematic education oppression date back to enslavement, more specifically 1740. In 1740, North Carolina passed legislature that prohibited [[Education during the Slave Period|slave education]]. While the original legislature prohibited African Americans from being taught how to write, as other States adopted their own versions of the law, southern anti-literacy legislatures banned far more than just writing. Varying Southern laws prohibited African Americans from learn how to read, write, and assembling without the presence of slave owners. Many states as far as requiring free African Americans to leave in fear of them educating their enslaved brethren. By 1836, the public education of all African-Americans was strictly prohibited.

The enslavement of African Americans removed the access to education for generations.&lt;ref name="Ladson-Billings"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ladson-Billings|first=Gloria|year=2006|title=From Achievement Gap to the Education Debt: Understanding Achievement in U.S. Schools|journal=Educational Researcher|volume=35|issue=7|series=AERA Presidential Address|pages=1–11|doi=10.3102/0013189x035007003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Once the legal abolishment of slavery was enacted, racial stigma remained. Social, economic, and political barriers held blacks in a position of subordination.&lt;ref name="Gamoran" /&gt; Although legally African Americans had the ability to be learning how to read and write, they were often prohibited from attending schools with White students. This form of segregation is often referred to as ''de jure'' segregation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The schools that allowed African American students to attend often lacked financial support, thus providing inadequate educational skills for their students. Freedmen's schools existed but they focused on maintaining African Americans in servitude, not an enriching academic prosperity.&lt;ref name="Ladson-Billings" /&gt;  The United States then experienced legal separation in schools between whites and blacks. Schools were supposed to receive equal resources but there was an undoubted inequality. It was not until 1968 that Black students in the South had universal secondary education.&lt;ref name="Ladson-Billings" /&gt; Research reveals that there was a shrinking of [[racial achievement gap in the United States|inequality between racial groups]] from 1970–1988, but since then the gap has grown again.&lt;ref name="Williams" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ladson-Billings" /&gt;

Latinos and American Indians experienced similar educational repression in the past, which effects are evident now. Latinos have been systematically shut out of educational opportunities at all levels. Evidence suggests that Latinos have experienced this educational repression in the United States has far back as 1848.&lt;ref name="Ladson-Billings" /&gt; Despite the fact that it is illegal to not accept students based on their race, religion, or ethnicity, in the Southwest of the United States Latinos were often segregated through the deliberate practice of school and public officials. This form of segregation is referred to as de facto segregation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fox-Williams, Lewis-McCoy|first=Brittany N., R. L’Heureux|year=2016|title=Race and Education|url=|journal=Wiley-Blackwell Encyclopedia of Sociology|volume=2nd Edition|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; American Indians experienced the enforcement of [[missionary schools]] that emphasized the [[Assimilation (sociology)|assimilation]] into white culture and society. Even after "successful" assimilation, those American Indians experienced discrimination in white society and often a rejection by their tribe.&lt;ref name="Ladson-Billings" /&gt; It created a group that could not truly benefit even if they gained an equal education.

American universities are separated into various classes, with a few institutions, such as the [[Ivy League]] schools, much more exclusive than the others.  Among these exclusive institutions, educational inequality is extreme, with only 6% and 3% of their students coming from the bottom two income quintiles.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Mishel, Jared Bernstein, and Heidi Shierholz, The State of Working America 2008/ 2009 (Ithaca, NY: ILR Press)cited in Stiglitz, Joseph E. (2012-06-04). The Price of Inequality: How Today's Divided Society Endangers Our Future (p. 308). Norton. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Resources ===
Access to resources play an important role in educational inequality. In addition to the resources from family mentioned earlier, access to proper nutrition and health care influence the cognitive development of children.&lt;ref name=Greenstone /&gt; Children who come from poor families experience this inequality, which puts them at a disadvantage from the start. Not only important are resources students may or may not receive from family, but schools themselves vary greatly in the resources they give their students. On December 2, 2011, the [[U.S. Department of Education]] released that school districts are unevenly distributing funds, which are disproportionately underfunding low-income students.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2011/12/educational_inequality.html|title=The Persistence of Educational Inequality|last=Brown|first=Cynthia G.|work=Center for American Progress|accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is holding back money from the schools that are in great need. High poverty schools have less-qualified teachers with a much higher turnover rate.&lt;ref name="Lee and Orfield" /&gt;  In every subject area, students in high poverty schools are more likely than other students to be taught by teachers without even a minor in their subject matter.&lt;ref name=Haycock /&gt; Better resources allows for the reduction of classroom size, which research has proven improves test scores.&lt;ref name=Greenstone /&gt; It also increases the number of after school and summer programs—these are very beneficial to poor children because it not only combats the increased loss of skill over the summer but keeps them out of unsafe neighborhoods and combats the drop-out rate.&lt;ref name=Greenstone /&gt;  There is also a difference in the classes offered to students, specifically advanced mathematics and science courses.  In 2012, Algebra II was offered to 82% of the schools (in diverse districts) serving the fewest Hispanic and African American students,  while only 65% of the schools serving the most African American and Hispanic students offered students the same course.  [[Physics]] was offered to 66% of the schools serving the fewest Hispanic and African American students, compared to 40% serving the most.  [[Calculus]] was offered to 55% of the schools serving the fewest Hispanic and African American students, compared to 29% serving the most.&lt;ref name=CRDC /&gt;

This lack of resources is directly linked to ethnicity and race. Black and Latino students are three times more likely than whites to be in high poverty schools and twelve times as likely to be in schools that are predominantly poor.&lt;ref name="Lee and Orfield" /&gt;  Also, in schools that are composed of 90% or above of minorities, only one half of the teachers are certified in the subjects they teach.&lt;ref name=Haycock /&gt;  As the number of white students increase in a school, funding tends to increase as well.&lt;ref name=Ladson-Billings /&gt;  Teachers in elementary schools serving the most Hispanic and African-American students are paid on average $2250 less per year than their colleagues in the same district working at schools serving the fewest Hispanic and African American Students.&lt;ref name=CRDC /&gt; From the family resources side, 10% of white children are raised in poverty, while 37% of Latino children are and 42% of African American children are.&lt;ref name=Farkas /&gt; Research indicates that when resources are equal, Black students are more likely to continue their education into college than their white counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Merolla|first=David|year=2013|title=The Net Black Advantage in Educational Transitions: An Educational Careers Approach|url=http://aer.sagepub.com/content/50/5/895|journal=American Educational Research Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===State conflicts===
Within [[fragile state]]s, children may be subject to inadequate education. The poor educational quality within these states is believed to be a result of four main challenges. These challenges include coordination gaps between the governmental actors, the policy maker's low priority on [[educational policy]], limited financing, and lack of educational quality.&lt;ref name="Fragile States"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Winthrop |first1=Rebecca |last2=Matsui |first2=Elena |title=A New Agenda for Education in Fragile States |url=http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Research/Files/Papers/2013/08/education%20agenda%20fragile%20states%20winthrop/08%20education%20agenda%20fragile%20states%20winthrop.pdf |website=Brookings Institution |publisher=Brookings Institution |accessdate=11 November 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129035458/http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Research/Files/Papers/2013/08/education%20agenda%20fragile%20states%20winthrop/08%20education%20agenda%20fragile%20states%20winthrop.pdf |archivedate=29 November 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement==
In the last decade, tests have been administered throughout the world to gather information about students, the schools they attend, and their educational achievements. These tests include the [[Organization for Economic and Co-Operational Development]]'s Program of International Student Assessment and the [[International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement]]'s Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study. To calculate the different test parameters in each country and calculate a standard score, the scores of these tests are put through [[Item Response Theory]] models. Once standardized, analysts can begin looking at education through the lens of achievement rather than looking at attainment. Through looking at achievement, the analysts can objectively examine educational inequality throughout the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ferreira|first1=Francisco|last2=Jeremie|first2=Gignoux|title=Measurement of Educational Inequality: Achievement and Opportunity|journal=World Bank Economic Review|date=2014|volume=28|issue=2|pages=210–246|doi=10.1093/wber/lht004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects ==
{{hatnote|See selected issues under [[Higher education in the United States]].}}

=== Social mobility ===
''[[Social mobility]]'' refers to the movement in class status from one generation to another. It is related to the "rags to riches" notion that anyone, with hard work and determination, has the ability to move upward no matter what background they come from. Contrary to that notion, however, sociologists and economists have concluded that, although exceptions are heard of, social mobility has remained stagnant and even decreased over the past thirty years.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Leonhardt, D. &amp; Scott, J. (2005). Class matters: Shadowy lines that still divide. New York Times. https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/15/national/class/OVERVIEW-FINAL.html&lt;/ref&gt;   From 1979 through 2007 the wage income for lower and middle class citizens has risen by less than 17 percent while the one percent has grown by approximately 156 percent sharply contrasting the "postwar period up through the 1970s, when income growth was broadly shared".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stateofworkingamerica.org/subjects/overview/?reader|title=Overview {{!}} State of Working America|website=www.stateofworkingamerica.org|accessdate=2015-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the decrease in social mobility may be explained by the stratified educational system. Research has shown that since 1973, men and women with at least a college degree have seen an increase in hourly wages, while the wages for those with less than a college degree have remained stagnant or have decreased during the same period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stateofworkingamerica.org/subjects/wages/?reader|title=Wages {{!}} State of Working America|website=www.stateofworkingamerica.org|accessdate=2015-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the educational system forces low-income families to place their children into less-than-ideal school systems, those children are typically not presented with the same opportunities and educational motivation as are students from well-off families, resulting in patterns of repeated intergenerational educational choices for parent and child, also known as decreased or stagnant [[social mobility]].&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

== Remedies ==
There are a variety of efforts by countries to assist in increasing the availability of quality education for all children.

===Assessment===
Based on input from more than 1,700 individuals in 118 countries, [[UNESCO]] and the [[Center for Universal Education]] at the [[Brookings Institution]] have co-convened the Learning Metrics Task Force.&lt;ref name="Brookings Assessments" /&gt; The task force aims to shift the focus from access to access plus learning.&lt;ref name="Brookings Assessments" /&gt; They discovered through assessment, the learning and progress of students in individual countries can be measured.&lt;ref name="Brookings Assessments" /&gt; Through the testing, governments can assess the quality of their education programs, refine the areas that need improvement, and ultimately increase their student's success.&lt;ref name="Brookings Assessments"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brookings.edu/research/reports/2014/07/implementing-assessment-improve-learning|title=Toward Universal Learning: Implementing Assessment to Improve Learning|date=15 July 2014|website=Brookings Institution|publisher=Brookings Institution and UNESCO Institute for Statistics|accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education for All Act===
The [[Education For All]] act or EFA is a global commitment to provide quality basic education for all children, youth, and adults. In 2000, 164 governments pledged to achieve education for all at the [[World Education Forum]]. There are six decided-upon goals designed to reach the goal of Education for All by 2015. The entities working together to achieve these goals include governments, multilateral and development agencies, civil society and the private sector. [[UNESCO]] is responsible for coordinating the partnerships. Although progress has been made, some countries are providing more support than others. Also, there is need to strengthen overall political commitment as well as strengthening the needed resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|title=Coordination and Advocacy for EFA|url=https://en.unesco.org/partnerships/partnering/coordination-and-advocacy-efa|website=United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global Partnership for Education===
[[Global Partnership for Education]] or GPE functions to create a global effort to reduce educational inequality with a focus on the poorest countries. GPE is the only international effort with their particular focus on supporting countries' efforts to educate their youth from primary through secondary education. Main goals of the partnership include providing educational access to each child, ensuring each child masters basic numeracy and literacy skills, increasing the ability for governments to provide quality education for all, and providing a safe space for all children to learn in. They are a partnership of donor and developing countries but the developing countries shape their own educational strategy based upon their personal priorities. When constructing these priorities, GPE serves to support and facilitate access to financial and technical resources. Successes of GPE include helping nearly 22 million children get to school, equipping 52,600 classrooms and training 300,000 teachers.&lt;ref name="Global Partnership for Education"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.globalpartnership.org/10-things|title=10 Things About The Global Partnership|website=The Global Partnership for Education|publisher=Global Partnership for Education|accessdate=3 November 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140404015527/https://www.globalpartnership.org/10-things|archivedate=2014-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Massive online classes===
There is a growing shift away from traditional higher education institutions to [[massive open online courses]] (MOOC). These classes are run through content sharing, videos, online forums and exams. The MOOCs are free which allow for many more students to take part in the classes, however the programs are created by global north countries, therefore inhibiting individuals in the global south from creating their own innovations.&lt;ref name="Inequality South Africa" /&gt;

== Policy implications ==

With the knowledge that early educational intervention programs, such as extended childcare during preschool years, can significantly prepare low-income students for educational and life successes, comes a certain degree of responsibility. One policy change that seems necessary to make is that quality child care is available to every child in the United States at an affordable rate. This has been scientifically proven to push students into college, and thus increase [[social mobility]]. The ultimate end result of such a reality would be that the widely stratified educational system that exists in the U.S. today would begin to equalize so that every child born, regardless of [[socioeconomic status]], would have the same opportunity to succeed. Many European countries are already exercising such successful educational systems.

=== Albania ===
Household income in Albania is very low. Many families are unable to provide a college education for their kids, with the money they make. Albania is one of the poorest countries in Europe with a large population of people under the age of 25. This population of students needs a path to higher education. Nothing is being done for all the young adults who are smart enough to go to college but can not afford to.

The [[Bangladesh]] education system includes more than 100,000 schools run by public, private, NGO and religious providers.&lt;ref name="Ed Bangladesh" /&gt; The schools are overseen by a national ministry. Their system is centralized and overseen by the sub districts also known as [[Upazilas of Bangladesh|Upazilas]].&lt;ref name="Ed Bangladesh" /&gt; During the past two decades, the system expanded through new national policies and pro-poor spending. The gross enrollment rate in the poorest quintile of [[Upazilas of Bangladesh|upazilas]] is 101 percent.&lt;ref name="Ed Bangladesh" /&gt; Also, the poorest quintile spending per child was 30 percent higher than the wealthiest quintile.&lt;ref name="Ed Bangladesh"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Steer|first1=Liesbet|last2=Rabbani|first2=Fazle|last3=Parker|first3=Adam|title=Primary Education Finance for Equity and Quality: An Analysis of Past Success and Future Options in Bangladesh|url=http://www.brookings.edu/research/papers/2014/09/primary-education-finance-equity-quality|website=Brookings Institution|publisher=Brookings Institution|accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Educational inequalities continue despite the increased spending. They do not have consistent learning outcomes across the upazilas. In almost 2/3 of upazilas, the dropout rate is over 30 percent.&lt;ref name="Ed Bangladesh" /&gt; They have difficulty acquiring quality teachers and 97 percent of preprimary and primary students are in overcrowded classrooms.&lt;ref name="Ed Bangladesh" /&gt;

==== Inequality in higher education ====
Africa, in general, has suffered from decreased spending on higher education programs. As a result, they are unable to obtain moderate to high enrollment and there is minimal research output.&lt;ref name="Inequality South Africa"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shrivastava|first1=Meenal|last2=Shrivastava|first2=Sanjiv|title=Political economy of higher education: comparing South Africa to trends in the world|journal=Higher Education|date=June 2014|volume=64|issue=6|pages=809–822|doi=10.1007/s10734-013-9709-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within [[South Africa]], there are numerous factors that effect the quality of tertiary education. The country inherited class, race and gender inequality in the social, political, and economic spheres during the [[Apartheid]]. The 1994 constitution emphasizes higher education as useful for human resource development and of great importance to any economic and social transitions. However, they are still fighting to overcome the [[colonialism]] and racism in intellectual spaces.&lt;ref name="Inequality South Africa" /&gt;

Funding from the government has a major stake in the educational quality received. As a result of declining government support, the average class size in South Africa is growing. The increased class size limits student-teacher interactions, therefore further hindering students with low problem solving and critical thinking skills. In an article by Meenal Shrivastava and Sanjiv Shrivastava, the argument is made that in large class sizes “have ramifications for developing countries where higher education where higher education is a core element in the economic and societal development”. These ramifications are shown to include lower student performance and information retention.&lt;ref name="Inequality South Africa" /&gt;

=== United Kingdom (UK) ===

Evidence from the [[British birth cohort studies]] has illustrated the powerful influence of family socio-economic background on children's educational attainment. These differences emerge early in childhood,&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, A., Ketende, S., &amp; Joshi, H. (2013). Social Class and Inequalities in Early Cognitive Scores. Sociology..&lt;/ref&gt; and continue to grow throughout the school years.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein, L. (2003). Inequality in the early cognitive development of British children in the 1970 cohort. Economica, 70(277), 73–97.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sudan Republic (SD) ===

The earliest educational system of Sudan was established by the British during the first half of the 20th century. The government of Sudan recognizes education as a right for every citizen and guarantees access to free basic education, The educational structure of the Republic of the Sudan consists of the pre-primary, primary, secondary and higher education, The Sudanese education system includes more than 3.646 schools run by public, private, and religious providers, the schools are overseen by the High Ministry of Education. However, Sudan’s simmering wars and a lack of awareness about the importance of education and chronic under-development all contribute to the poor schooling of girls in Sudan. In addition, cultural pressures and the traditional views of the role of women mean fewer girls attend and remain in school. The inability to pay fees even though school is free according to government policy is a major reason, some poor families can’t afford the stationaries &amp; clothes, also the government can’t provide all the students needs because of the economic situation and poverty. However government has raised their awareness of educating females, and they published universities only for girls, the first and the most popular one is AL Ahfad University for Women, located in Omdurman, created in 1907 by Sheikh Babikr Bedri. now percentage of educated females are increasing within time, based on the last survey estimates that 60.8% of females in Sudan can read &amp; write.

=== United States of America (US) ===

====Property tax dilemma====
In the United States, schools are funded by local property taxes.  Because of this, the more affluent a neighborhood, the higher the funding for that school district. Although this situation seems favorable, the problem emerges when the equation is reversed. In neighborhoods inhabited by predominantly working and lower-class families, properties are less expensive, and so property taxes are much lower than those in affluent neighborhoods. Consequently, funding for the school districts to which working and lower class children are assigned is also significantly lower than the funding for the school districts to which children of affluent families are assigned. Thus, students in working and lower class schools do not receive the same quality of education and access to resources as do students from affluent families. The reality of the situation is that distribution of resources for schools is based on the socioeconomic status of the parents of the students. As a result, the U.S. educational system significantly aids in widening the gap between the rich and the poor. This gap has increased, rather than decreased, over the past few decades due in part to a lack of [[social mobility]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Leonhardt, D. (2005). Class matters: The college dropout boom. New York Times. https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/24/national/class/EDUCATION-FINAL.html?_r=1&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International comparisons ===
Compared to other nations, the United States is among some of the highest spenders on education per student behind only Switzerland and Norway.&lt;ref name="Spellings"&gt;Spellings, Margaret. "10 Facts About K-12 Education Funding". ED.gov. June 2005. U.S. Department of Education. 28 Nov 2011 http://www2.ed.gov/about/overview/fed/10facts/index.html.&lt;/ref&gt; The per-pupil spending has even increased in recent years{{when|date=April 2018}} but the academic achievement of students has remained stagnant.&lt;ref name=Greenstone&gt;{{cite journal|last=Greenstone|first=Michael|title=Improving Student Outcomes: Restoring America's Education Potential|journal=The Hamilton Project|year=2011|series=Strategy Paper|pages=1–30|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Education in Sweden|Swedish educational system]] is one such system that attempts to equalize students and make sure every child has an equal chance to learn. Some ways that Sweden is accomplishing these goals is by making sure every child can go to daycare affordably. Of the total cost of childcare, parents pay no more than 18% for their child; the remaining 82% is paid for by various government agencies and municipalities. In 2002, a "maximum-fee" system was introduced in Sweden that states that costs for childcare may be no greater than 3% of one's income for the first child, 2% for the second child, 1% for the third child, and free of charge for the fourth child in pre-school. 97.5% of children age 1–5 attend these public daycare centers. Also, a new law was recently introduced that states that all four- and five-year-old children can attend day care for free.&lt;ref name="auto6"&gt;Bjornberg, U. &amp; Dahlgren, L. Policy: The case of Sweden. University of York, United Kingdom. http://www.york.ac.uk/inst/spru/research/nordic/swedenpoli.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Since practically all students, no matter what their socioeconomic background, attend the same daycare centers, equalization alongside educational development begins early and in the public sphere. Furthermore, parental leave consists of 12 months paid leave (80% of wage) whereas one month is awarded solely to the father in the form of "use it or lose it". This results in the privilege and affordability of staying home and bonding with one's child for the first year of life. Due to this affordability, less than 200 children in the entire country of Sweden under the age of 1 are placed in child care.&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;Clawson, D. &amp; Gerstel, N. (2007). Caring for our young: Childcare in Europe and the United States. Ed. Ferguson, S.J. Shifting the center: Understanding contemporary families. 3rd Ed. McGraw Hill: Boston, MA&lt;/ref&gt;

Stratification in the educational system is further diminished by providing all Swedish citizens and legal residents with the option of choosing which school they want their children to be placed in, regardless of what neighborhood they reside in or what property taxes they pay. Additionally, the Swedish government not only provides its citizens with a free college education, but also with an actual monthly allowance for attending school and college.&lt;ref name="auto6"/&gt;

Together, these privileges allow for all Swedish children to have access to the same resources. A similar system can be found in France, where free, full-day child care centers known as "écoles maternelles" enroll close to 100% of French children ages 3–5 years old. In Denmark, children from birth to age six are enrolled in childcare programs that are available at one-fifth the total costs, where the rest is covered by public funding.&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt;

'''Edward Sexton''' (born 9 November 1942 in Dagenham, Essex) is a British [[Savile Row]] tailor, fashion designer and manufacturing consultant. Sexton has been called a key player in the history of Savile Row.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Savile Row Documentary|url=http://www.edwardsexton.co.uk/film.aspx|work=Video|publisher=BBC|accessdate=29 June 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110217005659/http://www.edwardsexton.co.uk/film.aspx|archivedate=17 February 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=November 2011}}
Edward Sexton went to English Martyrs School (in [[Southwark]]) from 1953–1957. Leaving school, Sexton went to work at Lew Rose (in 1957), a suit manufacturing factory in East London, where he received his initial training.  Lew Rose operated a section production system; Sexton progressed around each section developing basic tailoring skills.

In 1959, Sexton went to work as an apprentice for Jerry Vanderstine, a coat maker who worked for Harry Hall (specialist equestrian tailor on [[Regent Street]], London). In 1959 John Oates, the head cutter at Harry Hall, then asked Sexton to come and work as an assistant cutter and trimmer. In 1961 Sexton worked at Cyril A. Castle, a celebrity tailor, as an assistant jacket-cutter and trouser-cutter. While working at Cyril A. Castle, Sexton got his first position of responsibility on the cutting board and put himself through a pattern cutting course at Burner Street Technical College (later to become part of the London College of Fashion).

In 1962, Sexton moved to Kilgour French and Stanbury,&lt;ref name="Kerr"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kerr|first=Susan|title=Pattern of Success|url=http://edwardsexton.co.uk/presszoom.aspx?id=Millionaire%20March%201988%20es.jpg|accessdate=29 June 2011|newspaper=Millionaire|date=March 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he finished his training. In 1966 Sexton got his first job as a fully-fledged cutter at (military tailor) Welsh and Jefferies,&lt;ref name="The master tailors of british bespoke"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ford|first=James Sherwood ; with photography by Guy Hills ; foreword by Tom|title=Savile Row : the master tailors of British bespoke|year=2010|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|location=London|isbn=978-0-500-51524-2|pages=216–220}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he honed his skills cutting both military and civilian tailoring. Sexton made trips to [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]] to make uniforms for officers passing. Sexton believed this experience proved invaluable to the work he would later produce.

==Nutters of Savile Row==
In 1967 Sexton went to work as a cutter for Donaldson, Williams and Ward, where he met the young salesman [[Tommy Nutter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Daily Mail|url=http://www.edwardsexton.co.uk/presszoom.aspx?id=Daily%20Mail%2020th%20Jan%201970.jpg|accessdate=28 June 2011|newspaper=Daily Mail|date=20 January 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nutter quickly recognised Sexton’s talent and they started working together for private clients. Through this work they began to develop a style (a waisted and flared jacket with wide lapels and parallel trousers) which was to evolve over the years. Nutter was very handsome and always impeccably dressed, and quickly drew clients from his social circle, which was growing in size and influence.

On 14 February 1969, Edward Sexton and Tommy Nutter opened [[Nutters of Savile Row]] at No. 35a [[Savile Row]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=An Historical Occasion, Nutter's Open Their Doors - and Cilla meets the Row|url=http://www.edwardsexton.co.uk/presszoom.aspx?id=Tailor%20and%20cutter.jpg|accessdate=30 June 2011|newspaper=Tailor and Cutter|date=21 February 1969|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320190115/http://www.edwardsexton.co.uk/presszoom.aspx?id=Tailor%20and%20cutter.jpg|archivedate=20 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the backing of [[Cilla Black]], [[Bobby Willis]], James Vallance White and [[Peter Brown (music industry)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ftmlondon.org/exhibitions/past/detail/?ID=67 |title=Fashion and Textile Museum |publisher=Ftmlondon.org |date=2011-01-31 |accessdate=2011-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414223427/http://www.ftmlondon.org/exhibitions/past/detail/?ID=67 |archivedate=2012-04-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first new Savile Row establishment in 120 years. 
Nutter was the creative force and front of house focus, while Sexton was a traditional bespoke master cutter who created the garments.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Sexton remained managing director &lt;ref name="Kerr"/&gt; until 1982, when he moved from 35a to 36-37 Savile Row and changed the name of the business to Edward Sexton.

==Leaving Savile Row==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=November 2011}}
In 1990 Sexton left Savile Row to set up in Knightsbridge,&lt;ref name="Sexton Appeal"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sherwood|first=James|title=Sexton Appeal|newspaper=The Independent|date=30 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; alongside couturiers Caroline Charles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Caroline Charles Website|url=http://www.carolinecharles.co.uk/stores.php?osCsid=m01h7vtvcbbcp842vi334hs3g3|work=Company website|accessdate=23 November 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426001228/http://www.carolinecharles.co.uk/stores.php?osCsid=m01h7vtvcbbcp842vi334hs3g3|archivedate=26 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=November 2011}}  and [[Bruce Oldfield]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bruce Oldfield Website|url=http://www.bruceoldfield.com/home|work=Company Website|accessdate=23 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=November 2011}} . Sexton continues to operate, by appointment only, from a studio on [[Beauchamp Place]], producing bespoke tailoring for both men and women. Bespoke shirts and an exclusive selection of accessories for his customers offer a complete Sexton 'look'.

==Consultancy and Collaborations==

=== Wilks Bashford ===
From 1987 Sexton produced a collaborative range for Wilks Bashford in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=New York Times|date=5 April 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 'Poor Little Rich Girl' ===
Sexton made the costumes for the $12million NBC production of Poor Little Rich Girl (The Barbara Hutton Story).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Mens Wear|date=7 May 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sexton dressed many of the husbands in the film including [[James Read]] as Cary Grant and Anthony Peck, as well as [[Farrah Fawcett]]  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Rocky Mountain News|date=14 May 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Saks Fifth Avenue ready to wear ===
In September 1988 Sexton created an exclusive line for [[Saks Fifth Avenue]] of made to measure suits and ready to wear tailoring: shirts, ties, socks, canes, hats, pocket squares and ascots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Daily News Record|date=23 June 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stella McCartney and Chloe ===
In 1995, while studying at Central St. Martins, Stella served an apprentiship with Sexton,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Readers Digest|date=January 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was her father’s tailor. Sexton helped Stella develop her graduate show that was modelled by Kate Moss, Naomi Campbell and Yasmin Le Bon&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Daily Mail|date=7 December 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The show made front-page news, and the entire collection was sold to Tokio, a London boutique.
In 1997, when Stella took over from [[Karl Lagerfeld]], as creative director she “relied on”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Express|date=2 October 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sexton to create her first Paris collection. Sexton worked for Chloe as a consultant and continued tutoring Stella in cutting, design, fabric selection and tailoring. In 1999 Sexton refused to renew his contract with Chloe, so he could spend more time in London seeing the bespoke clients he had been neglecting.&lt;ref name="MOS"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Mail on Sunday|date=10 October 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The fashion industry did not credit Stella for the initial success of Chloe, but instead acknowledged Sexton's contributions.&lt;ref name="MOS"/&gt;

=== Petra Ecclestone Form Clothing ===
In 2007, [[Bernie Ecclestone]] showed Sexton designs by his 18-year-old daughter [[Petra Ecclestone|Petra]]. Sexton was impressed, and the two started working together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Slater|first=Lyndia|title=Driving Force|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/fashion/article-23754464-driving-force-petra-ecclestone.do|accessdate=7 July 2011|newspaper=London Evening Standard|date=9 October 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111228023527/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/fashion/article-23754464-driving-force-petra-ecclestone.do|archivedate=28 December 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Independent school (UK)|Private schools]] ("public schools" in [[England and Wales]]), mainly attended by boys from the more affluent upper, upper-middle, and professional classes, are widely credited with three key achievements in the creation of [[Football#Establishment of modern codes|modern codes of football]]. First, the evidence suggests that, during the 16th century, they transformed the popular, but violent and chaotic, "[[mob football]]" into organised team sports that were beneficial to schoolboys. Second, many early references to football in literature were recorded by people who had studied at these schools, showing they were familiar with the game. Finally, in the 19th century, former [[England|English]] public school boys, in a meeting organised by two old-boys of [[Shrewsbury School|Shrewsbury]], were the first to write down formal codes of rules in order to enable matches to be played between different schools.  These versions of football rules were the basis of both the [[Cambridge Rules]] and the subsequent rules of [[Laws of the Game (association football)|association football]], of which only one copy survives in the library of Shrewsbury.

==History of football==
===14th century===
That ball games were probably played at English [[public school (England)|public schools]] from earliest times is suggested by early references to such games being played by students at university. In later centuries there is no doubt that football games played at school were taken by former students to university. The earliest reference to ball games at English Universities comes from 1303 when "Thomas of [[Salisbury]], a student of [[Oxford University]], found his brother Adam dead, and it was alleged that he was killed by Irish students, whilst playing the ball in the High Street towards Eastgate".&lt;ref name="marples"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{pn|date=May 2017}} The earliest specific reference to football (pila pedalis) at university comes in 1555 when it was outlawed at [[St John's College, Oxford|St John's College]], [[Oxford]].  Similar decrees followed shortly after at [[Cambridge University]].

===15th and 16th centuries===
The first direct evidence that games probably resembling football were being played at English [[public school (England)|public schools]] comes from the ''Vulgaria'' by [[William Horman]] in 1519. Horman had been headmaster at [[Eton College|Eton]] (1485/6–1494/5) and [[Winchester College]]. His [[Latin]] textbook includes a translation exercise with the phrase "We wyll playe with a ball full of wynde", a rough translation of the original Latin "Lusui erit follis pugillari spiritu tumens", which [[Francis Peabody Magoun]] translated as "In sport we shall have a ball inflated with air to kick".&lt;ref&gt;History of football from the beginnings to 1871: By [[Francis Peabody Magoun]] Published by H. Pöppinghaus, o. h.-g., 1938&lt;/ref&gt; Even as early as 1519, Horman shows us that he was well aware of the value of sports to children's education and the need to temper their enthusiasm in order not to affect their studies: "There muste be a measure in gyuynge of remedies or sportynge to chyldren, leste they be wery of goynge to theyr boke if they haue none, or waxe slacke if they haue to many".&lt;ref name="zen"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.zen20110.zen.co.uk/SportHistWeb/SPORTS%20HISTORY/BSSH/The%20Sports%20Historian/TSH%2015/bailey.html |author=Steven Bailey |title=Living Sports History: Football at Winchester, Eton and Harrow |accessdate=2007-04-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070517002253/http://www.zen20110.zen.co.uk/SportHistWeb/SPORTS%20HISTORY/BSSH/The%20Sports%20Historian/TSH%2015/bailey.html |archivedate=17 May 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This conflict was discussed further by [[Christopher Johnson (physician)|Christopher Johnson]] who was headmaster at Winchester in the 1560s, but clearly remained a dilemma for public school masters right up to modern times.  Christopher Johnson mentions the activities which he enjoyed when a scholar at Winchester himself between 1549 and 1553. He says that he: "cared much more for balls, quoits and tops than he did for books and school".&lt;ref name="zen" /&gt;

Sir Henry Wotton who was at Winchester in the 1560s under Christopher Johnson makes reference to the English word "football" in one of his poems.

[[Richard Mulcaster]], a former student at [[Eton College]] and later headmaster at [[Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood|Merchant Taylors' School]] (1561) and [[St Paul's School (London)|St Paul's School]] (1596) has been described as "the greatest sixteenth Century advocate of football".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.footballnetwork.org/dev/historyoffootball/history8_18_3.asp |author=footballfoundation.org |title=Richard Mulcaster}}&lt;/ref&gt; He tells us that towards the end of the sixteenth century football in [[England]] had grown to "greatnes ... [and was] much used ... in all places". Mulcaster's unique contribution is not only referring to "footeball" by its correct English name but also providing the earliest evidence of organised team football. Mulcaster confirms that his was a game closer to modern football by differentiating it from games involving other parts of the body, namely "the hand ball" and "the armeball". He referred to the many benefits of his "footeball" in his personal publication of 1581 in English entitled 'Positions Wherein Those Primitive Circumstances Be Examined, Which Are Necessarie for the Training up of Children'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucs.mun.ca/~wbarker/positions-txt.html |author=Munlcaster, Richard |title=Positions Concerning the Training Up of Children |year=1581 |accessdate=2007-04-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927134327/http://www.ucs.mun.ca/~wbarker/positions-txt.html |archivedate=27 September 2006 |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; He states that football had positive educational value and it promoted health and strength. Mulcaster's discussion on the merits of football was the first to refer to teams ("sides" and "parties"), positions ("standings"), the benefits of a referee ("judge over the parties") and a coach "(trayning maister)".  Although it is not explicitly mentioned, passing of the ball is strongly implied by the reference to different positions on the field. Mulcaster describes a game for small teams that is organised under the auspices of a referee (and is therefore clear evidence that his game had evolved from disordered and violent "mob" football): "Some smaller number with such overlooking, sorted into sides and standings, not meeting with their bodies so boisterously to trie their strength: nor shouldring or shuffing one another so barbarously ... may use footeball for as much good to the body, by the chiefe use of the legges".  As a result of his enthusiasm for the sport and his accurate description of the modern game Richard Mulcaster is considered the father of early modern football.

In 1591, it is clear that ball games were being played at [[Lyon's Free Grammar School]] in Harrow'. He says that "upon Thursday only sometimes when the weather is fine, and upon Saturday, or half-holidays after evening prayer. And their play shall be to drive a top, to toss a handball, to run, or to shoot".&lt;ref name="zen" /&gt;

===17th century===
There is evidence that team kicking games were being played in schools in other parts of Britain by the mid 17th century. In 1633 (cited in other references as 1636), David Wedderburn, a teacher from [[Aberdeen]], mentioned elements of football games in a short Latin textbook called the "Vocabula". Wedderburn cites phrases that school boys might use during their game.  The text below is given in two forms: [[Francis Peabody Magoun]]'s 1938 original (and more literal) translation and then Marples 1956 version.  It is noteworthy that Magoun does not use the word to "pass".

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Let us choose sides//Let’s pick sides.&lt;br /&gt;
pick your man first//You have first choice.&lt;br /&gt;
Those on our side come here//Those who are on our side, come over here.&lt;br /&gt;
How many are against us?/How many are there in the other team?&lt;br /&gt;
Kick out the ball so that we may begin the game/Kick off, so that we can begin the match.&lt;br /&gt;
Come, kick it here/Pass it here.&lt;br /&gt;
You keep the goal/You keep goal.&lt;br /&gt;
Snatch the ball from that fellow if you can/Get hold of the ball before he does, if you can manage it.&lt;br /&gt;
Come, throw yourself against him/Go on, intercept him.&lt;br /&gt;
Run at him/Charge him.&lt;br /&gt;
Kick the ball back/Pass the ball back.&lt;br /&gt;
Well done.  You aren't doing anything/Well done! You’re slacking.&lt;br /&gt;
To make a goal/To score a goal.&lt;br /&gt;
This is the first goal, this the second, this the third/This is the second, this the third goal.&lt;br /&gt;
Drive that man back/Keep him out, otherwise the other side wins.&lt;br /&gt;
The opponents are, moreover, coming out on top, If you don't look out, he will make a goal/If you’re not careful, he’ll score in a minute.&lt;br /&gt;
Unless we play better, we'll be done for/If we don’t play better, we’re done for.&lt;br /&gt;
Ah, victory is in your hands/Hi! You’re the winners.&lt;br /&gt;
Ha, hurrah. He is a very skilled ball player/Hurrah! He’s a very good player.&lt;br /&gt;
Had it not been for him, we should have brought back the victory/If it has been for him we should have won.&lt;br /&gt;
Come, help me. We still have the better chance/Come on, help me. We still have a better side?"
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

(The original Latin is cited by Magoun (1938): Sortiamur partes; tu primum socium dilige; Qui sunt nostrarum partium huc se recipient; Quot nobis adversantur; Excute pilam ut ineamus certamen; Age, huc percute; Tu tuere metum; Praeripe illi pilam si possis agere; Age objice te illi; Occurre illi; Repercute pilam; Egregie. Nihil agis; Transmittere metum pila; Hic primus est transmissus. Hic secundus, hic tertius est transmissus; Repelle eum, alioqui, adversarii evadunt superiores; Nisi cavesjam occupabit metam; Ni melius a nobis ludatur, de nobis actum est.  Eia penes vos victoria est; Io triumphe. Est pilae doctissimus; Asque eo fuisset, reportassimus vicoriam; Age, subservi mihi; Adhuc potiores habemus, scilicet partes)

Wedderburn's Latin book is an early reference to what has been rendered in the second version of the translation as "passing" the ball. The word "passing" is not used explicitly:  the original Latin states "huc percute" (strike it here) and "repercute pilam" (strike it back - or again). The original word translated as "goal" is "metum", literally meaning the "pillar at each end of the circus course" in a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] chariot race.   The sentence given as "intercept him" in the second translation above is translated in the original as "Throw yourself against him" (Age, objice te illi). There is a reference to "get hold of the ball before [another player] does" or to "snatch" it (Praeripe illi pilam si possis agere) suggesting that handling of the ball was allowed. It is clear that the tackles allowed included the "charging" and pushing/holding of opposing players ("Keep him out" above, "drive that man back" in the original, "repelle eum" in original Latin). This game is likely to have been similar to rugby football. Contrary to press reports in 2006 there is no reference to game rules, marking players, team formations, or forward passing. This text was described in 2006 as "an amazing new discovery" but has actually been well documented in football history literature since the early twentieth century and available on the internet since at least 2000.  It confirms that organised football games in the seventeenth century were not confined to English Schools. (An earlier description of goals, defending goals and passing the ball comes from Carew's account of [[Cornish Hurling]]).

The next specific mention of football at public schools can be found in a Latin poem by Robert Matthew, a [[Winchester]] scholar from 1643 to 1647. He describes how "...we may play quoits, or hand-ball, or bat-and-ball, or football; these games are innocent and lawful. ..".  That football at winchester was "innocent and lawful" at this time is very noteworthy.&lt;ref&gt;R.Matthew De Collegio seu potius Collegiata Schola Wicchamica Wintoniensi trans. in A.K.Cook, About [[Winchester College]] (Macmillan, 1917) p 21&lt;/ref&gt; This is strongly supportive of the fact that by the mid-seventeenth century football and other ball games in English public schools had been tamed. ''Nugae Etonenses'' (1766) by T. Frankland also mentions the "Football Fields" at Eton.

A more detailed description of football is given in [[Francis Willughby]]'s Book of Sports,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN1859284604&amp;id=P-io9DcBllkC&amp;pg=PA168&amp;lpg=PA168&amp;vq=football&amp;dq=willughby+book+of+sports&amp;sig=qfpFofLjtqtwe0Y13Av4KZHvSA8 |author=Willughby, Frank |title= Book of Sports |work= Google Books |accessdate=2007-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; written in about 1660.  This account is particularly noteworthy as he refers to football by its correct name and is the first to describe the following:  goals and a pitch ("a close that has a gate at either end.  The gates are called Goals"), tactics ("leaving some of their best players to guard the goal"), scoring ("they that can strike the ball through their opponents' goal first win") and the way teams were selected ("the players being equally divided according to their strength and nimbleness"). He is the first to describe a law of football:  "They often break one another's shins when two meet and strike both together against the ball, and therefore there is a law that they must not strike higher than the ball". His account of the ball itself is also very informative:  "They blow a strong bladder and tie the neck of it as fast as they can, and then put it into the skin of a bull's cod and sew it fast in".  He adds: "The harder the ball is blown, the better it flies. They used to put quicksilver into it sometimes to keep it from lying still".   His book includes the first (basic) diagram illustrating a football pitch. Willughby's link with the public school system was that he had studied at sutton coldfield school, was a student at [[Cambridge university]] and frequented the [[Bodleian library]] at [[Oxford university]].

===18th century===
In 1710, football was recorded as being played on the green at [[Westminster school]].&lt;ref&gt;S. Sargeaunt, Annals of Westminster school, page 133, London: Shipman and Sons 1884 page 570-571; cited in Football: The First Hundred Years.  The Untold Story.  Adrian Harvey, Routledge, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th century===
The earliest versions of any football code rules were written down in the early nineteenth century, most notably by [[Eton College]] (1815)&lt;ref name="Richard William Cox 2002 243"/&gt;
and [[Aldenham School]] (1825).&lt;ref name="Richard William Cox 2002 243"/&gt;

By the early 19th century, (before the [[Factory Act 1850|Factory Act of 1850]]), most [[working class]] people in [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] had to work six days a week, often for more than twelve hours a day. They had neither the time nor the inclination to engage in sport for recreation and, at the time, many children were part of the [[labour force]]. [[Feast day]] football on the public highway was at an end. Thus the public school boys, who were free from constant toil, became the inventors of organised football games with formal codes of rules. These gradually evolved into the modern football and rugby games that we know today.

[[Railway Mania|The boom in rail transport in Britain]] during the 1840s meant that people were able to travel further and with less inconvenience than they ever had before. Inter-school sporting competitions became possible. While local rules for [[Sports|athletic]]s could be easily understood by visiting schools, it was nearly impossible for schools to play each other at football, as each school played by its own rules.

==Rugby football==
[[William Webb Ellis]], a pupil at [[Rugby school]], is said to have "showed a fine disregard for the rules of football, as played in his time" by picking up the ball and running to the opponents' goal in 1823. This act is popularly said to be the beginnings of Rugby football, but the evidence for this bold act does not stand up to close examination and most sports historians believe the story to be [[apocrypha]]l.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Webb Ellis, William|url = http://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/webb-ellis.html|accessdate =14 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In older forms of football, handling the ball was allowed, or even compulsory; for example, the English writer [[William Hone]], writing in 1825 or 1826, quotes the social commentator Sir [[Frederick Morton Eden]], regarding "Foot-Ball", as played at [[Scone, Scotland]]:
:''The game was this: he who at any time got the ball into his hands, run [sic] with it till overtaken by one of the opposite part; and then, if he could shake himself loose from those on the opposite side who seized him, he run on; if not, he threw the ball from him, unless it was wrested from him by the other party,'' but no person was allowed to kick it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uab.edu/english/hone/etexts/edb/day-pages/046-february15.html William Hone, 1825-26, ''The Every-Day Book'', "February 15."] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080105043230/http://www.uab.edu/english/hone/etexts/edb/day-pages/046-february15.html |date=5 January 2008 }} Access date: 15 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1845, three boys at Rugby school were tasked with codifying the rules then being used at the school. This further assisted the spread of the Rugby game.

During the early nineteenth century the Rugby school rules appear to have spread at least as far, perhaps further, than the other schools' games. For example, two clubs which claim to be the world's first and/or oldest football club, in the sense of one which is not part of a school or university, are both strongholds of rugby football: the [[Barnes Football Club|Barnes Club]], said to have been founded in 1839, and [[Guy's Hospital Football Club]], reportedly founded in 1843. Neither date nor the variety of football played is well documented, but such claims nevertheless allude to the popularity of rugby before other modern codes emerged.

The first inter-school match was played between [[Cheltenham College]] and Rugby school, 
surprisingly the victors being [[Cheltenham College]], still a prolific rugby school.
First played in 1864 the Clifton v Marlborough game lays claim to being the first inter-school Rugby fixture. The fixture continues today and the winning side is presented with the Governor's Cup. The Cup was once a polo trophy of the Governor of Jamaica.

The great majority of public schools now play rugby football as a major sport.

==Association football==
Football had come to be adopted by a number of public schools as a way of encouraging ''esprit de corps'', competitiveness and keeping youths fit. Each school drafted their own rules to suit the dimensions of their playing field. The rules varied widely between different schools and were changed over time with each new intake of pupils. Soon, a number of schools of thought about how football should be played emerged. Some schools favoured a game in which the ball could be carried (as at Rugby, [[Marlborough College|Marlborough]] and [[Cheltenham School|Cheltenham]]).  

Others preferred a game where dribbling the ball was promoted (in particular [[Eton College|Eton]], [[Shrewsbury School|Shrewsbury]] and [[Harrow School|Harrow]]).  This kind of dribbling ''foot'' ball with a tight off-side rule is still played today as the [[Eton field game]].  A third group including [[Westminster School|Westminster]] and [[Charterhouse School|Charterhouse]] pursued a game that excluded handling the ball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/fifa/history_E.html |accessdate=2007-04-11 |author=Dr. Wilfried Gerhardt |title=The Colourful History of a Fascinating Game |publisher=FIFA |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070406072255/http://www.fifa.com/fifa/history_E.html |archivedate=6 April 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is some evidence that this also became a passing game which importantly allowed the forward pass known as "passing on".{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} 

The division into these camps was partly the result of circumstances in which the games were played. At Charterhouse and Westminster, both schools at the time played on restricted sites in London, the boys were confined to playing their ball game within the cloisters making the rough and tumble of the handling game difficult.  Most of the founding members of [[The Football Association]] in 1863 were former schoolboys at these public schools.  Punch referred to them as "Public School professors of the art [of football]".&lt;ref&gt;Punch, 17 October 1863, page 163&lt;/ref&gt; 

This led to a conflict in the way that Association football should be played.  Some committee members favoured the rules of Charterhouse and Westminster School and pushed for a passing game, in particular rules that allowed forward passing ("passing on"). Other schools (in particular [[Eton College]] and [[Harrow School|Harrow]]) favoured a dribbling game with a tight off-side rule (such that all players must remain behind the ball). By 1867 [[the Football Association]] had chosen in favour of the Charterhouse and Westminster game and adopted an off-side rule that permitted forward passing.&lt;ref name="marples"/&gt;{{rp|150}} The modern forward-passing soccer game was thus born, as a direct consequence of Charterhouse and Westminster Football.

The first ever inter-school soccer match was between Charterhouse and Westminster in 1863.

Between the Wars a substantial number of independent schools switched codes from soccer to rugby, but this trend did not continue, and at least one, [[City of London School]], switched from rugby to soccer a few years ago. In addition, many independent schools now offer both codes, and in some schools, including Eton, Winchester, Charterhouse and Westminster, association football is a major sport.

==Other codes==
[[File:Tom wills statue.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Statue at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]], [[Australia]] commemorating the earliest known football match between Melbourne Grammar School and Scotch College.  [[Tom Wills]] [[Umpire (Australian rules football)|umpires]] as two schoolboy players contesting the ball.]]
Three schools maintain their own football games: the Field Game and the Wall Game at Eton; [[Harrow Football]]; and [[Winchester College Football|Winchester Football]].

School Football games also had a influence on the [[origins of Australian rules football]].  The earliest recorded football matches in [[Australia]] were English school football matches and the [[Cordner-Eggleston Cup]] (first played in 1858) is officially acknowledged as the first game of [[Australian rules football]].

==Contributions to the rules==
===Offside===
Each of the English public school games had its own offside rule.  Many of these completely prevented forward passing.  The 1847 rules of Eton College, however, were probably the first to resemble the modern game, stating:

"A player is considered 'sneaking' when only three or less than three of the opposite side are before him and the ball behind him, and in such a case, he may not kick the ball."

This is noteworthy as it allowed players to receive a forward pass if more than three opponents were between them and the opponents' goal line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sportacademy/hi/sa/football/rules/newsid_3632000/3632335.stm | work=BBC News | title=Think you know your offside? | date=4 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dribbling, passing, "scientific football" and the "combination game"===
Dribbling and passing of the ball (including forward passing) are all parts of public school games. In addition, the introduction of the FA rules that allowed both dribbling and forward passing of the ball were instigated by former public school boys.  These key elements of modern Association football were taken from the various versions of public school football. Dribbling was a key part of the Eton game and passing, in particular forward passing ("passing on") was argued for by representatives of [[Charterhouse School|Charterhouse]] during the establishment of the Football Association rules in the 1860s.&lt;ref name="marples" /&gt; These features of modern soccer had been integrated into the Football Association rules by 1867 and were the consequence of English public school games.   

[[File:1stRoyalEngineers.png|thumb|right|The [[Royal Engineers AFC]] (1872): the [[Combination Game|first passing side]] (of whom many former public school members)]]

In 1856 [[Lancing College]] created its own code of football which was regarded as a means of fostering teamwork.&lt;ref&gt;J. Lowerson and J. Myerscough, Time to Spare in Victorian England (Brighton: Harvester, 1977) pp 119–120, cited in ''Football: The First Hundred Years. The Untold Story''. Adrian Harvey, Routledge, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

"Scientific" football is first described in 1862 at [[Rugby School]]: here one could see "scientific play", magnificent "drops" and "gallant run ins".&lt;ref&gt;Blackwood's Magazine, Published by W. Blackwood, 1862, page 563&lt;/ref&gt; It is uncertain if the drops and run-ins constituted what the author meant by "scientific", however it is made clear that this playing style was distinctly less "vicious" than in the past. Clearly there was something systematic about scientific rugby. Further references to scientific play come in match accounts in the 1860s, including to games under the Association rules.

Certain football historians correctly point out that the forward pass is not permitted in rugby football and therefore see the emergence of the forward pass as a critical development in the evolution of association football (and for this reason do not acknowledge the role of the public school games). They forget, however, that passing the ball forward by ''kicking'' is not only completely legal in Rugby but also is a regular tactic employed in most matches—particularly in open, running play. For this reason the public school games can claim to be origin of the forward-passing game. Passing the ball continues to this day in surviving traditional public school football games. Even in Harrow Football, which is essentially a dribbling game, the ball may be chipped into the hands of a team-mate.&lt;ref name="zen" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zen20110.zen.co.uk/SportHistWeb/SPORTS%20HISTORY/BSSH/The%20Sports%20Historian/TSH%2015/bailey.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070517002253/http://www.zen20110.zen.co.uk/SportHistWeb/SPORTS%20HISTORY/BSSH/The%20Sports%20Historian/TSH%2015/bailey.html |archivedate=17 May 2007 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most notably the "Combination game" (the predecessor of the modern style of football involving a lot of player to player passing) is believed to have been invented by the [[Royal Engineers A.F.C.]] in the early 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cox |first=Richard |year=2002 |title=The Encyclopaedia of British Football |publisher=Routledge |location=United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/Fhistory.htm |work=The Encyclopædia of British Football |title=Early History of Football |author=Spartacus Educational |accessdate=2007-04-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070418122238/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/Fhistory.htm |archivedate=18 April 2007 |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly all of these players were from English public schools.

===Kicking off from the centre===
This was a key feature of the football codes of Harrow and Rugby.

===Goal crossbar===
The cross bar to the football goal was a feature of the Eton game and was noteworthy as the ball had to pass under the bar (instead of over it, as in Rugby football).  The [[wikisource:Sheffield Rules|Sheffield Rules of 1862]] later included both crossbars and half time and free kicks were introduced to their code in 1866 or before. In Harrow football, however, there is no crossbar, quite literally two rugby posts without their crossbar. A base is scored when the ball is hit between the posts.

===Team size===
Eleven or fifteen players per side was a feature of football at Eton and Winchester

===The football season===
Evidence for the establishment of the football season at English public schools comes in "Bentley's miscellany" (1844).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=018_PkJBDnLV1R-Olcu25LB&amp;id=cuSUFKrsJTcC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;lpg=PA39&amp;dq=football&amp;as_brr=1  |title= Bentley's Miscellany |year=1844 |accessdate=2007-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In a chapter entitled "Eton Scenes and Eton Men" the seasonal sports cycle is described thus: 
"Tamer boys play at cricket in the Summer and Hockey in the Winter; but the manlier youths pull in the boats during the Summer and play at Football in the winter".  See also the quotation below which confirms that the football season began in Autumn.  This is noteworthy because traditionally football had been played in England during [[Shrovetide]].

===Games between clubs===
School football clubs (and other sports) were a central part of life at nineteenth century English public schools.  In "Five years at an English University" (1852), American Charles Bristed describes his time at [[Cambridge University]] in the 1840s.  During a discussion on Eton and Rugby School (drawn upon letters from former students there) he states:  "[A boy is] proud of the house he belongs to as a man of his college; though in cricket and football clubs, in regular "long boats" and aquatic sweepstakes, in running and leaping races, he competes with the whole school, yet he belongs to a football club in the autumn, which includes the twenty or thirty boys boarding in his own house and thus matches are made between houses as between colleges".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=LCCN07015061&amp;id=VM2FSHZ6IbYC&amp;pg=PA365&amp;vq=football&amp;dq=football&amp;as_brr=1 |work=Google Books |author=Bristed, Charles Astor |title=Five Years in an English University |accessdate=2007-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Significantly this shows evidence of the first organised competitions between football teams not just within schools but between them. For competitions to take place between colleges it would clearly require some agreement over rules of the game. This necessity, combined with the availability of sufficient time and money to pursue the sport, was the driving force that led to the creation of modern football rules by people who had studied or taught at English public schools and universities.  This quotation also points to the establishment in English public schools of the "football season" which to this day begins without fail in Autumn.

===Team colours===
The tradition of wearing distinctive team strips (i.e. uniforms) was also commenced by public school teams. For example, the original image of Winchester football in about 1840 is entitled: "A 'Hot' at Foot Ball. The commoners have red and college boys blue jerseys".

The earliest evidence of coloured shirts used to identify football teams comes from early English public school football games, for example an image of Winchester football from before 1840 is entitled "The commoners have red and the college boys blue jerseys".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Football|first=Morris|last=Marples|publisher=Secker and Warburgh|year=1954|pages=84&amp;ndash;85}}&lt;/ref&gt;  House sporting colours are mentioned in [[Rugby football]] (rule XXI) as early as 1845: "No player may wear cap or jersey without leave from the head of his house".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/resources/Rugby%20School%20Laws%201845.pdf |title=Football Rules |publisher=rugbyfootballhistory.com |accessdate=28 April 2009 |format=PDF}}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} &lt;/ref&gt; Similaly, in 1848 it was noted at Rugby that "Considerable improvement has taken place in the last few years, in the appearance of a match... in the use of peculiar dress consisting of velvet caps and jerseys".&lt;ref&gt;Old Rugbean, Recollections of Rugby, Hamilton and Adams, 1848&lt;/ref&gt; The use of coloured shirts at Winchester college are confirmed again in 1859: "Precisely at twelve o'clock, according to good old custom, the blue jerseys of college and the red of commoners mingled in the grand commencing 'hot'".&lt;ref&gt;Bell's Life in London and Sporting Chronicle (London, England), Sunday, 14 November 1858&lt;/ref&gt; 

At soccer, Winchester wear dark blue shirts to signify their connection with [[Oxford University]], specifically [[New College, Oxford|New College]], and Eton light blue, since they are linked to [[King's College, Cambridge]].

===Half-time===
The division of the game into two halves was initiated to allow games between schools. The rules of one school would be played by for the first half, and the rules of the other school in the second half.  Changing ends at half time (if no goals had been scored) was part of the following schools codes:  Brighton, Eton, [[Rossall School|Rossall]], Sheffield, Winchester.  Other schools changed every time that side scored (Cheltenham, FA, Harrow, Marlborough, Rugby, Shrewsbury, Uppingham schools)&lt;ref name="Football page 184"&gt;Football: The first hundred years.  The untold story.  Adrian Harvey.  Routledge, Abingdon 2005 page 184&lt;/ref&gt;

===Substitutes===
The origin of football substitutes goes back to at least the early 1860s as part of English public school football games. The original use of the term "substitute" in football was to describe the replacement of players who failed to turn up for matches.  For example, in 1863, a match reports states:  "The [[Charterhouse School|Charterhouse]] eleven played a match in cloisters against some old [[Old Carthusians F.C.|Carthusians]] but in consequence of the non-appearance of some of those who were expected it was necessary to provide three substitutes."&lt;ref&gt;Bell's Life in London and Sporting Chronicle (London, England), Sunday, 22 February 1863; pg. 7.New Readerships&lt;/ref&gt;  The substitution of absent players happened as early as the 1850s, for example from [[Eton College]] where the term "emergencies" is used&lt;ref&gt;Bell's Life in London and Sporting Chronicle (London, England), Sunday, 11 November 1855; pg. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  Numerous references to players acting as a "substitute" occur in soccer matches in the mid-1860s&lt;ref&gt;for example, Bell's Life in London and Sporting Chronicle (London, England), Saturday, 17 December 1864; Issue 2,226.&lt;/ref&gt; where it is not indicated whether these were replacements of absent players or of players injured during the match.

===The throw-in===
The modern throw-in comes from the nineteenth century English public school football games.  In these codes of football a variety of methods of returning the ball into play from touch were used.  The modern throw-in draws upon various aspects of a number early English school games. For example, returning the ball by throwing it out was part of the Rugby and [[Cheltenham]] football rules. Like the modern association football throw-in the direction was not specified.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}  The [[Sheffield rules]] instigated the throw in of the ball at right angles by the opposite side to the one that played it into touch.&lt;ref name="Football page 184"/&gt;  The two handed throw in is part of rugby union football - see "line out".  That the first side reaching the ball must throw it out (at right angles, in this case) was part of [[the Football Association]] rules and the Rossall rules.  The 1863 [[Cambridge Rules]] state that "In a match when half the time agreed upon has elapsed, the side shall change goals when the ball is next out of play".{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12482">'''Ethnoichthyology''' is an area in [[anthropology]] that examines human knowledge of [[fish]], the uses of fish, and importance of fish in different human societies. It draws on knowledge from many different areas including [[ichthyology]], [[economics]], [[oceanography]], and [[marine botany]]. 

This area of study seeks to understand the details of the interactions of humans with fish, including both cognitive and behavioural aspects.&lt;ref&gt;MARQUES, J.G.W. Etnoictiologia: pescando pescadores nas águas da transdisciplinaridade. In: ENCONTRO BRASILEIRO DE ICTIOLOGIA, 11, 1995a, Campinas. Resumos... Campinas: UNICAMP/Sociedade Brasileira de Ictiologia, 1995a. p. 1-41.&lt;/ref&gt; A knowledge of fish and their life strategies is extremely important to fishermen. In order to conserve fish species, it is also important to be aware of other cultures' knowledge of fish. Ignorance of the effects of human activity on fish populations may endanger fish species. Knowledge of fish can be gained through experience, scientific research, or information passed down through generations. Some factors that affect the amount of knowledge acquired include the value and abundance of the various types of fish, their usefulness in fisheries, and the amount of time one spends observing the fishes' life history patterns.&lt;ref&gt;http://ethnobiology.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/JoE/22-2/SilvanoBegossi2002.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The term was first used in the scientific literature by W.T. Morrill.&lt;ref&gt;MORRILL, W.T. Ethnoichthyology of the Cha-Cha. Ethnology, Pittsburgh, v. 6, p. 405-417, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; He justified the origin and use of this term by stating that it arose from the model of "[[ethnobotany]]".&lt;ref&gt;Mourão, J. S; Nordi, N. 2002. Principais critérios utilizados por pescadores artesanais na taxonomia folk dos peixes do estuário do Rio Mamanguape, Paraíba – Brasil. Interciencia, 27 (11): 607-612.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mourão, J. S.; Nordi, N. 2003. Etnoictiologia de pescadores artesanais do estuário do rio Mamanguape, Paraíba, Brasil. Boletim do Instituto de Pesca, 29 (1): 9-17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Costa-Neto, E. M; Dias, C. V; Melo, M. N. 2002. O conhecimento ictiológico tradicional dos pescadores da cidade de Barra, região do médio São Francisco, Estado da Bahia, Brasil. Acta Scientiarum, 24 (2): 561-572.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Importance in conservation ==
Ethnoichthyology can be very useful to the study and investigation of environmental changes caused by anthropogenic factors, such as the decline of fish stocks, the disappearance of fish species, and the introduction of non-native species of fish in certain environments.&lt;ref&gt;Azevedo-Santos, V. M.; Costa-Neto, E. M.; Lima-Stripari, N. 2010. Concepção dos pescadores artesanais que utilizam o reservatório de Furnas, Estado de Minas Gerais, acerca dos recursos pesqueiros: um estudo etnoictiológico. Revista Biotemas, 23 (4): 135-145&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnoichthyological knowledge can be used to create environmental conservation strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Albuquerque, U. P. 1999. La importancia de los estudios etnobiológicos para establecimiento de estrategias de manejo y conservación en las florestas tropicales. [[Revista Biotemas]], 12: 31-47.&lt;/ref&gt; With a sound knowledge of fish ecology, informed decisions with respect to fishing practices can be made, and destructive environmental practices can be avoided. Ethnoichthyological knowledge can be the difference between conserving a species of fish, or placing a [[Moratorium (law)|moratorium]] on fishing.

=== Newfoundland's cod fishery collapse ===
The collapse of the [[Cod fishing in Newfoundland|cod fishery]] in  [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] was due to a lack of ethnoichthyological knowledge and conservation efforts.The waters of Newfoundland were once teeming with [[cod]]. John Cabot's crew reported that "The sea there is full of fish that can be taken not only with nets, but fishing baskets."&lt;ref&gt;[[Cod fishing in Newfoundland#15th and 16th Century]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Until John Cabot's crew arrived in Newfoundland, those who caught cod were mostly subsistence fishermen. They generally used techniques like [[jigging]], [[Longline fishing|longlining]], and small [[Trawler (fishing)|trawler]] use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.greenpeace.org/comms/cbio/cancod.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125141918/http://archive.greenpeace.org/comms/cbio/cancod.html |archivedate=2009-01-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These methods were not stressful on the cod population. However, the invasion of European superpowers put a great deal of pressure on the environment. At one point, the [[France|French]], English, [[Spain|Spanish]] and [[Portugal|Portuguese]] would anchor as nearby as 12 miles off the Newfoundland shore with large trawlers in order to maximize their catch. This was extremely detrimental to the population. The catch of cod reached its peak in 1968 at 80,000 tons,&lt;ref&gt;Report on the Status of Groundfish Stocks in the Canadian Northwest Atlantic. Atlantic Stock Assessment Secretariat, Department of Fisheries and Oceans. June 1994. p.19.&lt;/ref&gt; after which a steady decrease in population was observed. Foreign ships were forced to fish two hundred miles offshore. Despite good intentions, the results were not favourable. This was because [[Canadians|Canadian]] and [[Americans|American]] fishermen were then freed of competition and able to increase their catch. By the 1980s the amount of fish taken had increased from a safe 139,000 tons to an unsustainable 250,000 tons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.greenpeace.org/comms/cbio/cancod.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125141918/http://archive.greenpeace.org/comms/cbio/cancod.html |archivedate=2009-01-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of [[Dredging|draggers]] was found to be extremely detrimental to the cod population in several ways. Not only did it decimate the number of adult cod, but it wreaked havoc on their reproduction. While spawning, cod are extremely vulnerable to disturbance. Their eggs are often dispersed due to the draggers. The draggers also emit a chemical that is thought to negatively affect the embryogenic development of the cod. Finally, the draggers destroy the habitat of the cod, other fish and [[crustacean]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Reproductive Success in Atlantic Cod (Gadus Morhua): The Potential Impact of Trawling. A report prepared by: OCEANS Ltd., Newfoundland for the Newfoundland Inshore Fisheries Association. Feb. 1990. pp79-89.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian federal government was forced to issue a moratorium on cod fishing in 1992 due to populations reaching dangerously low numbers. Though local inshore fishermen had been voicing concerns about the state of the population since the early 1980s, the government choose to rely on scientific data. The scientific community failed to see the signs of the unstable population until 1986. When they presented their findings to the government, a suitable reduction was not put in place with enough haste to allow population to stabilize. The government was forced to put a ban on cod fishing or risk extinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.greenpeace.org/comms/cbio/cancod.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125141918/http://archive.greenpeace.org/comms/cbio/cancod.html |archivedate=2009-01-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This ban could have been avoided if the ethnoichthyological knowledge of the local fishermen had been given more consideration. Though the moratorium kept the cod from becoming extinct in the Newfoundland area, it also had some negative effects. Large companies lost business and subsistence fishermen were forced to find new ways of making a living. It is unlikely that the cod will ever return to their original numbers.

== Specific cultures ==
Ethnoichthyological knowledge varies among cultures. Every cultural group has a different way of interacting with the fish species in their environment. Often, folk knowledge coincides with the ideas put forth in scientific literature. Those who work with fish, such as fishermen, possess a wide range of knowledge concerning the fish they have experience with. They understand things like the trophic relationships among native and exotic fish species, migratory patterns, and the habitat preferences of the most prized fishes. It has been established that fishermen have a good grasp on classification, and fish biology.  This knowledge can be used to improve fishery management strategies. Folk knowledge can be extremely important when expanding biological research.&lt;ref&gt;http://ethnobiology.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/JoE/22-2/SilvanoBegossi2002.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Piracaba River===
A small fishery on the Piracaba river in [[Brazil]]  was the subject of a recent [[Ethnobiology|ethnobiological]] study by Renato ''et al.''.&lt;ref&gt;http://ethnobiology.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/JoE/22-2/SilvanoBegossi2002.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers wanted to examine the knowledge of the Brazilian fishermen to see how it compared to data in the scientific literature. The fishermen displayed a great deal of knowledge pertaining to diet, predation, distribution, reproduction, and migration. They were more likely be knowledgeable about things such as habitat than reproduction. Though reproduction is imperative to the continuation of the species, knowledge of spawning times has little to no bearing on the fishermen's work. Habitat, however, is a subject in which having knowledge is extremely important. The fishermen must know where the fish live in order to make a good catch. In knowing what a particular species eats, one can determine more precisely where the desired species may be found. Fishermen are also careful to be aware of where the desired species' predators hunt, to ensure that they do not lose some of their catch. The fishermen's knowledge of fish species' habits is increased for species that are common or economically valuable.&lt;ref&gt;http://ethnobiology.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/JoE/22-2/SilvanoBegossi2002.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Cha-Cha===
The Cha Cha, residents of [[St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. Thomas, Virgin Islands]], have a strong connection with the fish species in their waters. They are proficient in catching fish through three methods. Traps made of wood, metal, and mesh are used by professional fishermen as well as subsistence fishermen. Subsistence fishermen typically set a few traps in shallow water near their homes, whereas professional fishermen set a large number of traps in deep water. [[Seine fishing|Seining]] is one of the least common fishing techniques in the Cha Cha culture due to time restraints and yielding an impractically large catch. It is time consuming because it requires a great deal of precision as the technique varies with the size and shape of the fish. It is often considered of lesser importance as the yields are usually so great that the fish cannot all be sold before they spoil. Seining involves using a vertical net that can be drawn up to encircle a school of fish. [[Handline fishing|Handlining]], in combination with [[chumming]], is the last of the three methods used by the Cha-Cha. Ten or fifteen pounds of small fish called "fry" are ground up in a mixture of sand and then tossed into the water. This mixture called chum will attract fish. At this point, hand lines are baited with whole fry. This method results in large harvests of fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= |author= |date= |jstor=3772827}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fish in culture==
{{see also|Fish#Culture}}

Fish, along with being an important food source, occupy a special place in human culture. Fish star in many novels and movies such as ''[[The Old Man and the Sea]]'', ''[[Jonah and the Whale]]'', ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'', ''[[Shark Tale]]'' and ''[[Finding Nemo]]''. Fish have also served a spiritual purpose in some religions. They are important symbols in religions such as [[Christianity]], [[Hinduism]], and [[Judaism]]. The Ichthys, a simple fish design, is well known in Christian culture. It is thought to be related to the feeding of the multitudes. [[Jesus Christ]] multiplied loaves of bread and fish in order to feed a large gathering of people.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06083a.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

''' Event management''' is the application of [[project management]] to the creation and development of large-scale events such as [[festival]]s, conferences, ceremonies, weddings, formal parties, concerts, or [[convention (meeting)|conventions]]. It involves studying the brand, identifying its [[target audience]], devising the event concept, and coordinating the technical aspects before actually launching the event.&lt;ref&gt;Ramsborg, G.C.; B Miller, D Breiter, BJ Reed &amp; A Rushing (eds), ''Professional meeting management: Comprehensive strategies for meetings, conventions and events'', 2008, 5th ed, Kendall/Hunt Publishing, Dubuque, Iowa. {{ISBN|0-7575-5212-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of planning and coordinating the event is usually referred to as '''event planning''' and which can include budgeting, scheduling, site selection, acquiring necessary [[License|permit]]s, coordinating transportation and parking, arranging for speakers or entertainers, arranging decor, event security, [[catering]], coordinating with third party vendors, and emergency plans. Each event is different in its nature so process of planning &amp; execution of each event differs on basis of type of event. 

The events industry now includes events of all sizes from the [[Olympics]] down to business breakfast meetings. Many industries, [[charitable organization]]s, and interest groups hold events in order to market themselves, build business relationships, raise money, or celebrate achievement.

==Marketing tool==

Event management might be a tool for [[Marketing strategy|strategic marketing]] and communication, used by companies of every size. Companies can benefit from promotional events as a way to communicate with current and potential customers.  For instance, these advertising-focused events can occur as press conferences, promotional events, or product launches.

Event managers may also use traditional news media in order to target their audience, hoping to generate media coverage which will reach thousands or millions of people. They can also invite their audience to their events and reach them at the actual event.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==Event manager==

The '''event manager''' is the person who plans and executes the event, taking responsibility for the creative, technical, and logistical elements.  This includes overall event design, brand building, marketing and communication strategy, [[audio-visual]] production, script writing, logistics, budgeting, negotiation, and client service.

==Event venue==
An event venue may be an onsite or offsite location. The event manager is usually not responsible for operations at rented event or entertainment venues, but will monitor all aspects of the event on site. Some of the tasks listed in the introduction may pass to the venue, but usually at a cost.

Corporate event managers book event venues to host corporate meetings, conferences, networking events, trade shows, product launches, team building retreats or training sessions in a more tailored environment.

== Sustainability ==
[[Sustainable event management]] (also known as event greening) is the process used to produce an event with particular concern for environmental, economic, and social issues.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/management-standards/iso20121.htm ISO 20121 - Sustainable events]", ISO (www.iso.org), retrieved 2014-30-05&lt;/ref&gt; Sustainability in event management incorporates socially and environmentally responsible decision making into the planning, organization and implementation of, and participation in, an event. It involves including sustainable development principles and practices in all levels of event organization, and aims to ensure that an event is hosted responsibly. It represents the total package of interventions at an event, and needs to be done in an integrated manner. Event greening should start at the inception of the project, and should involve all the key role players, such as clients, organizers, venues, sub-contractors, and suppliers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwf.panda.org/get_involved/live_green/at_the_office/green_events/|title=Organizing a Green Event|publisher=[[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology ==

[[Event management software]] companies provide [[event planning|event planners]] with software tools to handle many common activities such as delegate registration, hotel booking, travel booking, or allocation of exhibition floorspace.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

A recent trend in event technology is the use of mobile apps for events. Event mobile apps have a range of uses. They can be used to hold relatively static information such as the agenda, speaker biographies, and general FAQs. They can also encourage audience participation and engagement through interactive tools such as live voting/polling, submitting questions to speakers during Q&amp;A, or building live interactive "word clouds". Mobile event apps can also be used by event organisers as a means of communication. Organisers can communicate with participants through the use of alerts, notifications, and push messages. They can also be used to collect feedback from the participants through the use of surveys in app. Going a step further, some mobile event apps can also help participants to engage with each other, with sponsors, and with the organisers with built-in networking functionality.

==Education==
There are an increasing number of [[universities]] which offer courses in event management, including diplomas and graduate degrees. In addition to these academic courses, there are many associations and societies that provide courses on the various aspects of the [[industry]]. Study includes organizational skills, technical knowledge, [[public relations]], [[marketing]], [[advertising]], [[catering]], [[logistics]], [[Interior design|decor]], glamor identity, human relations, study of law and licenses, risk management, budgeting, and the study of allied industries like television, other media, and several other areas. Certification can be acquired from various sources to obtain designations such as 
*Certified Trade Show Marketer (CTSM)
*Certified in Exhibition Management (CEM)
*Global Certification in Meeting Management (CMM)
*[[Certified Meeting Professional]] (CMP)
*Global Certificate in Event Design (EDC) 
*Certified Special Event Professional (CSEP) 
*Certified Quality Event Planner (CQEP)

      <comment>Added most recent laureate.</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4652">The '''Francqui Prize''' is a prestigious Belgian scholarly and [[Science|scientific]] [[prize]] named after [[Émile Francqui]]. Normally annually since 1933, the [[Francqui Foundation]] awards it in recognition of the achievements of a scholar or [[scientist]], who at the start of the year still had to be under 50. It currently represents a sum of 250,000  [[Euro]]s and is awarded in the following three-year rotation of subjects: [[exact sciences]], [[social sciences]] or [[humanities]], and [[Biology|biological]] or [[medicine|medical]] sciences.

Proposed candidates must be associated with a Belgian academic institution, in the case of a foreigner for at least ten years. The recipient is selected by a jury of eight to 14 members, none of whom may be associated with a Belgian institution. The members of the international jury vote by secret letter, and the laureate they recommend must be supported by two thirds of the assembled directors of the foundation (with a quorum of 12) or no prize would be awarded that year.

The prize is meant to encourage the further work of the young laureate, rather than crown the latter's career. He or she is also asked to organise an international [[:wikt:colloquium|colloquium]] in the appropriate discipline the same year that he is awarded the prize, which usually leads to an international publication which enables the quality of Belgian [[university]] [[research]] to be more widely appreciated.

Some '''historical [[Chinese characters]] for non-Chinese peoples were graphically pejorative [[ethnic slurs]]''', where the racial insult derived not from the Chinese word but from the character used to write it. For instance, [[written Chinese]] first transcribed the name ''Yao'' "the [[Yao people]] (in southwest China and Vietnam)" with the character for ''yao'' [[wikt:猺|猺]] "jackal", but 20th-century [[language reform]]s replaced this graphic pejorative with ''yao'' [[wikt:瑤|瑤]] "precious jade". In alphabetically written languages like English, orthography does not change ethnic slurs —but in [[logograph]]ically written languages like Chinese, it makes a difference whether one writes ''Yao'' as 猺 "jackal" or 瑤 "jade".

==Linguistic background==
Disparaging characters for certain ethnic groups depend upon a subtle semantic aspect of [[transcription into Chinese characters]]. The [[Chinese language]] writes exonyms, like other foreign [[loanwords]], in characters chosen to approximate the foreign pronunciation – but characters represent meaningful Chinese words. The sinologist Endymion Wilkinson says, &lt;blockquote&gt;At the same time as finding characters to fit the sounds of a foreign word or name it is also possible to choose ones with a particular meaning, in the case of non-Han peoples and foreigners, usually a pejorative meaning. It was the practice, for example, to choose characters with an animal or reptile signific for southern non-Han peoples, and many northern peoples were given characters for their names with the dog or leather hides signific. In origin this practice may have derived from the animal totems or tribal emblems typical of these peoples. This is not to deny that in later Chinese history such graphic pejoratives fitted neatly with Han convictions of the superiority of their own culture as compared to the uncultivated, hence animal-like, savages and barbarians. Characters with animal hides, or other such significs were generally not used in formal correspondence. On and off they were banned by non-Han rulers in China culminating with the Qing. Many were systematically altered during the script reforms of the 1950s (Dada 韃靼, Tartar, is one of the few, to have survived). (2000: 712) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Wilkinson (2000: 38) compared these "graphic pejoratives selected for aborigines and barbarians" with the "flattering characters chosen for transcribing the names of the Western powers in the nineteenth century", for instance, ''Meiguo'' [[wikt:美國|美國]] "[[United States]]" can be read as "beautiful country" (Wu 2014).

Almost all logographically pejorative Chinese characters are [[Chinese character classification|classified]] as "[[Chinese character#Phono-semantic compounds|phono-semantic compounds]]", characters that combine a [[phonetic]] element approximately or exactly suggesting pronunciation and a [[Radical (Chinese character)|radical]] or [[determinative]] approximately indicating meaning.

The most common radical among graphic pejoratives is [[Radical 94]] 犬 or 犭, called the "dog" or "beast" radical, which is ordinarily used in characters for animal names (e.g., ''mao'' 猫 "cat", ''gou'' 狗 "dog", ''zhu'' 猪 "pig"; however, the traditional characters for "cat" and "pig" are 貓 and 豬 respectively, which contain other radicals). The Dutch historian [[Frank Dikötter]] explains the significance.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Physical composition and cultural disposition were confused in Chinese antiquity. The border between man and animal was blurred. 'The Rong are birds and beasts' [''Zuozhuan'']. This was not simply a derogatory description: it was part of a mentality that integrated the concept of civilization with the idea of humanity, picturing the alien groups living outside the pale of Chinese society as distant savages hovering on the edge of bestiality. The names of the outgroups were written in characters with an animal radical, a habit that persisted until the 1930s: the Di, a northern tribe, were thus assimilated with the dog, whereas the Man and the Min, people from the south, shared the attributes of the reptiles. The Qiang had a sheep radical. (1992: 3–4)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Graphic pejoratives''', or '''orthographic pejoratives''', are a unique aspect of Chinese characters. The American linguist [[James A. Matisoff]] coined the term "graphic pejoratives" in 1986, describing [[Exonym and endonym|autonym and exonym]] usages in East Asian languages.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Human nature being what it is, exonyms are liable to be pejorative rather than complimentary, especially where there is a real or fancied difference in cultural level between the ingroup and outgroup. Sometimes the same pejorative exonym is applied to different peoples, providing clues to the inter-ethnic pecking-order in a certain region. … the former Chinese name for the Jinghpaw, [''Yeren''] 野人 lit. 'wild men', was used by both the Jinghpaw and the Burmese to refer to the Lisu. … The Chinese writing system provided unique opportunities for graphic pejoratives. The 'beast-radical' 犭 used to appear in the characters for the names of lesser peoples (e.g., 猺 'Yao'), though now the 'person-radical' 亻 has been substituted (傜). (1986: 6)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The late American anthropologist and linguist [[Paul K. Benedict]] (1987: 188) described covert ethnic slurs as the "pejorativization of exonymized names." In a discussion of [[endonyms|autonyms]], Benedict said, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;…a leading Chinese linguist has remarked that the name 'Lolo' ''is offensive only when written with the 'dog' radical''. There is undoubtedly here some reflection of the underlying Chinese equation of 'word' with 'written character,' providing a clue to the 'pejorativization' of 'exonymized' names of this kind: by writing my name with a 'dog' alongside it you are calling me a 'dog' (and in Chinese this is a unisex epithet). The modern Chinese practice is to write these tribal names with the 'human being' radical, thereby raising their level of acceptance. (1987: 188)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Radical 9]] 人 or 亻, the "person" or "human" radical, is considered a semantically unprejudiced graphic element. It was used in a few early exonyms, such as ''Bo'' [[wikt:僰|僰]] (depicting a person in 棘 "thorns") "[[Bo people (China)|Bo people]]" in southern China (especially [[Sichuan]]).

In addition to having linguistically unique graphic pejoratives, Chinese, like all human languages, has typical disparaging terms for foreign peoples or "[[ethnophaulisms]]". Wilkinson (2000: 725-726) lists three commonly used words: ''nu'' 奴 "slave" (e.g., ''Xiongnu'' 匈奴 "fierce slaves; [[Xiongnu]] people"), ''gui'' 鬼 "devil; ghost" (''guilao'' or Cantonese [[Gweilo]] 鬼佬 "devil men; Western barbarians"), and ''lu'' 虜"captive; caitiff" (''Suolu'' 索虜 "unkempt caitiffs; [[Tuoba]] people", now officially written 拓拔 "develop pull"). Unlike official Chinese language reforms, Wilkinson (2000: 730) notes, "Unofficially and not infrequently graphic pejoratives were added or substituted" in loanword transcriptions, as when ''Falanxi'' 法蘭西 (with ''lan'' [[wikt:蘭|蘭]] "orchid; moral excellence") "France" was written ''Falangxi'' 法狼西 (with ''lang'' [[wikt:狼|狼]] "wolf").

==History==
''[[Wa (Japan)|Wa]]'' was the earliest written [[name of Japan]], and the first graphic pejorative to be replaced by another character. [[Han Dynasty]] (206 BCE–24 CE) scribes initially wrote the [[exonym]] "Japan" as Chinese ''Wo'' or Japanese ''Wa'' [[wikt:倭|倭]] meaning "submissive; dwarf barbarian". The Japanese adopted this ''[[kanji]]'' as their autonym, but replaced it with ''Wa'' [[wikt:和|和]] "harmony; peace" circa 756, and convinced the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618–907 CE) Chinese to adopt the new autonym, Japanese ''[[Nihon]]'' or Chinese ''Riben'' 日本 (lit. "root of the sun").

The American sinologist [[Herrlee Glessner Creel]] (1970: 197–8) said some early exonyms "may have been given by the Chinese as terms of contempt—this is hard to determine—but it is unlikely that all of them were." Pejorative Chinese characters, especially semantically negative ones replaced with semantically positive characters, are unmistakably determine ethnic contempt.
[[File:Huaxiasiyi.svg|thumb|[[Zhou Dynasty]] cosmography of [[Huaxia]] and the [[Four Barbarians|Siyi]]: [[Dongyi]] in the east, [[Nanman]] in the south, [[Xirong]] in the west, and [[Beidi]] in the north.]]

Despite Creel's warning about the complications of determining which early Chinese exonyms were derogatory, the first character dictionary, [[Xu Shen]]'s (121 [[Common Era|CE]]) ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]'' (cited from [[Wikisource]]'s [[s:zh:說文解字|說文解字]]), provides invaluable data about [[Han Dynasty]] usage. Take for example, definitions of the "[[Four Barbarians|Siyi]]" "Four Barbarians" surrounding ancient China – the ''[[Dongyi]]'' 東夷 "Eastern Barbarians", ''[[Nanman]]'' 南蠻 "Southern Barbarians", ''[[Xirong]]'' 西戎 "Western Barbarians", and ''[[Beidi]]'' 北狄 "Northern Barbarians" – where two are defined militarily and two bestially. 
*''Yi'' 夷: "平也. 从大从弓. 東方之人也." Level; flat. From 大 "big (person)" and 弓 "bow" radicals. Eastern people." (11/20)
*''Man'' 蠻: "南蠻, 蛇穜. 从虫䜌聲." Southern Man, a snake species. From 虫 "insect" radical and ''luan'' 䜌 phonetic." (14/5)
*''Rong'' 戎: "兵也. 從戈從甲." Weapons, warfare. From 戈 "dagger axe; halberd" and 甲 "helmet" radicals." (13/21)
*''Di'' 狄: "赤狄, 本犬種. 狄之為言淫辟也. 从犬,亦省聲." Red Di, originally a dog species. Calling the Di dogs refers to licentiousness and depravity. From 犬 "dog" radical, which is also phonetic." (11/8)

While graphic pejoratives originated in [[Shang Dynasty]] (c. 1600–1046 BCE), they continued to be used into the [[Qing Dynasty]] (1644–1912 CE). The [[anti-Manchuism|anti-Manchu]] revolutionary [[Zhang Binglin]] (1868–1936) blended traditional Chinese imagery with fashionable Western [[racial theory]] (tr. Dikötter 1992: 122): "Barbarian tribes, unlike the civilized yellow and white races, were the biological descendants of lower species: the Di had been generated by dogs, and the Jiang could trace their ancestry back to sheep." Historian [[John K. Fairbank]] (1992: 158–159) says this type of imagery was not officially endorsed by the central authorities in China at that time: in fact the ''kǎozhèng'' movement of the Qing scholars (consisting of "Song Learning" and "[[Han learning|Han Learning]]") as supported by the government was opposed to this to the point that out of some 2,320 resultingly suppressed works many were banned for having a perceived critical, "antibarbarian tone".

==Examples==
Although most characters for modern ethnic groups have been bowdlerized, some historical terms, such as ''Di'' 狄 "northern barbarians", remain in written Chinese.

===Dog radical ===
As described above, the "dog", "beast", or "quadruped" radical 犭 is especially common among graphic pejoratives for Chinese exonyms. The Dutch sinologist [[Robert Van Gulik]] (1967:29) describes this practice as "the unkind Chinese habit of writing the names of the "barbarians" surrounding their territory with the classifier "quadruped"". The German anthropologist Karl Jettmar (1983: 229) explains that calling outsiders "wild beasts, jackals, and wolves" linguistically justified using brutality against them.

[[Language reform]]s initiated in the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] in the late 1930s and continued in the [[People's Republic of China]] in the 1950s replaced "dog" radical ethnonyms of minority peoples with more positive characters.

The [[Yao people]]'s exonym changed twice from (犭"dog radical" and ''yao'' 䍃 phonetic) ''yao'' [[wikt:猺|猺]] "jackal; the Yao", to (亻"human radical") ''yao'' [[wikt:傜|傜]] "the Yao", and then to (玉 "jade radical") ''yao'' [[wikt:瑤|瑤]] "precious jade; green jasper; the Yao." [[Chinese dictionaries]] first defined ''yao'' 猺 as the "name of a wild animal" (11th-century ''[[Jiyun]]'': 獸名), and later as the "tribe of southern barbarians" (17th-century ''[[Zhengzitong]]'': 蠻屬).  The Chinese-English dictionary of [[Robert Henry Mathews]] (1931, no. 7287) records traditional Chinese prejudice about the Yao, "the books describe them as being very wild; they are said to have a short tail; and the skin on the soles of their feet is spoken of as being more than one inch in thickness".

The [[Zhuang people]] (an ethnic minority primarily living in [[Guangxi]]) are currently written with the character for ''zhuang'' [[wikt:壮|壮]] "strong; robust", but ''Zhuang'' was initially transcribed with the character for ''tong'' 獞 "a dog name", and then with ''tong'' 僮 ("human" radical) "child; boy servant". The late American sinologist and lexicographer [[John DeFrancis]] described how the People's Republic of China removed the graphic pejoration. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Sometimes the use of one radical or another can have a special significance, as in the case of removing an ethnic slur from the name of the Zhuang minority in southwest China, which used to be written with the dog radical but after 1949 was first written with the human radical and was later changed to a completely different character with the respectable meaning "sturdy": &lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;獞 ''Zhuàng'' (with the dog radical) &lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;僮 ''Zhuàng'' (with the human radical) &lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;壮 ''Zhuàng'' ("sturdy") (1984: 17) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
This 1949 change to ''Zhuang'' 僮 was made after the [[Chinese civil war]], and the change to ''Zhuang'' 壮 was made during the 1965 standardization of [[simplified Chinese characters]].

The [[Yi people]] or Lolo, whose current Chinese exonym is ''yi'' [[wikt:彝|彝]] "sacrificial wine vessel; Yi peoples", used to be condescendingly called the ''Luoluo'' 猓猓, giving a new ''luo'' reading to ("dog" radical and ''guo'' 果 phonetic) ''guo'' [[wikt:猓|猓]] "[[Proboscis monkey]]". The first replacement was ("human" radical) ''luo'' [[wikt:倮|倮]], already used as a graphic [[Variant Chinese character|variant character]] for ("clothing radical") ''luo'' [[wikt:裸|裸]] "naked"; the second was ''luo'' [[wikt:罗|罗]] "bird net; gauze".

The [[Lahu people]] were written ''Luohei'' 猓[[wikt:黑|黑]], with this same simian ''luo'' 猓 and 黑 "black". Their modern exonym is ''Lahu'' 拉祜, transcribing with ''la'' [[wikt:拉|拉]] "pull; drag" and ''hu'' [[wikt:祜|祜]] "favor or protection from heaven".

The [[Bouyei people]] in southern China and Vietnam are called ''Zhongjia'' 仲家, written with the "human radical" term ''zhong'' [[wikt:仲|仲]] "second; middle (of three months or brothers)". The earlier ethnonym ''Zhongjia'' 狆家 used the "dog radical" term ''zhong'' [[wikt:狆|狆]] "lap dog; pug", which now usually refers to the  [[Japanese Chin]] (from [[Japanese language]] ''chin'' 狆).

The modern Chinese transcription for the [[Gelao people]] is ''Gelaozu'' 仡佬族 with the "human radical", and ''Gelao'' was previously written 犵狫 with the "dog radical" and the same phonetic elements. The word ''liao'' [[wikt:獠|獠]] originally meant "night hunting; long, protruding teeth", and beginning during [[Wei-Jin period#Wei and Jin period.28AD 265.E2.80.93420.29|Wei-Jin period]] (265-420) was also pronounced ''lao'' 獠 meaning "an aboriginal tribe in southwest China (= ''lao'' [[wikt:狫|狫]]); ugly". This ''Laoren'' 僚人, from earlier 狫人 or 獠人, is the modern name for the [[Rau peoples]] (including [[Zhuang people|Zhuang]], [[Buyei]], and [[Tay people|Tay]]–[[Nung people|Nùng]]).

Additional "dog" radical examples of exonyms include the ancient [[Quanrong]] 犬戎 "dog barbarians" or "dog belligerents" and [[Xianyun]] 獫狁 (written with ''xian'' 獫 or 玁 "long-snouted dog; black dog with a yellow face"). Feng Li, a [[Columbia University]] historian of early China, suggests a close semantic relation (2006:346), "It is very probable that when the term Xianyun came to be written with the two characters 獫狁, the notion of 'dog' associated with the character ''xian'' thus gave rise to the term Quanrong 犬戎, or the 'Dog Barbarians'."

The Chinese name for [[Jews]], 犹太人 ''Yóutàirén'', or 猶太人 in traditional characters, contains a "dog" radical, but has not as yet been revised. However, the character 猶 only means "just like".

===Other radicals===
Some graphic pejoratives used significs besides the "dog" radical.

[[Radical 123]] 羊, the "sheep" radical, is seen in the ancient ''Jie'' [[wikt:羯|羯]] "castrated sheep; [[Jie people]]" and the modern ''Qiang'' [[wikt:羌|羌]] "shepherd; [[Qiang people]]."

[[Radical 153]] 豸, the "cat" or "beast" radical, appears in the ancient ''[[Mo (Chinese zoology)|Mo]]'' [[wikt:貊|貊]] or [[wikt:貘|貘]] "panther; northeastern barbarians", who are associated with the ancient ''Huimo'' 濊貊 "[[Yemaek]] people" (in Manchuria and Korea).

[[Radical 177]] 革, the "animal hide" or "leather" radical, is used in character names for  two northern barbarians. ''Dada'' 韃靼 "[[Tartars|Tartar people]]" is written with ''da'' 韃 "red-dyed leather" and ''da'' 靼 "pliable leather; tanned hide". The (c. 1609) [[Shanhai Yudi Quantu]] "Complete Terrestrial Map" uses ''Dada'' for "[[Tartary]]". ''Mohe'' 靺鞨 "[[Mohe people]]; [[Tungusic peoples]]" is written with ''mo'' 靺 "socks; stockings" and ''he'' 鞨 "shoes".

[[Radical 142]] 虫, the "insect" or "reptile" radical, is used for the early ''Man'' [[wikt:蠻|蠻]] "southern barbarians" and modern-day ''Min'' 閩 people (see [[Fujian#History]]). In [[Southern Min|Minnan]] they are both pronounced as /ban²⁴/ (POJ: bân). Xu Shen's ''Shuowen'' defines both words as 蛇種 "a type of snake". The American philologist and linguist [[Victor H. Mair]] explains the modern significance of these two ancient graphic pejoratives.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The debasement of local languages and cultures in China (whether they are Sinitic or non-Sinitic) is so ubiquitous that people become inured to it. They internalize the negative stereotypes associated with peripherality and sheer difference (from the orthodox language and culture of the center). This subtle (but sometimes also brutal) psychological conditioning extends even to the names people call themselves and the totemic myths with which they identify. For instance, the people of Fujian and Taiwan are proud to identify themselves as being from Min, but seldom do they consider that the character adopted to write this name over two millennia ago (it did not yet exist among the oracle bone and bronze inscriptions) includes the infamous ''chóng'' ("insect; serpent") radical. There it is staring you right in the face every time you look at the character: a bug inside of a door, but people do not see the insect / snake, perhaps because they do not want to see it or cannot bear to see it. Here is how Xu Shen explained the character used to write ''mín'' around the year 100 CE: "Southeastern Yue [i.e., Viet]; snake race. [The character is formed] from [the] insect / serpent [radical and takes its pronunciation from] ''mén''." 東南越蛇穜从虫門聲 … Southern Min speakers refer to themselves as ''bân-lâm-lâng'', which is usually written with sinographs meaning "Southern Min person" 閩南人, but should actually be written with sinographs meaning "Southern barbarian fellow" 蠻南儂. … The graph pronounced ''lâm'' in Taiwanese is the notorious ''mán'' ("barbarians [of the south]") as pronounced in MSM. Here is how Xu Shen explains the graph used to write ''lâm'' / ''mán'': "Southern barbarians [who are a] snake race. [The character is formed] from [the] insect / serpent [radical and takes its pronunciation from] ''luàn'' 南蠻蛇種从虫" … The Mán inhabitants of Mǐn are thus doubly southern, doubly barbarian, and doubly serpentine. Since these explanations have been enshrined in the most authoritative, foundational dictionary of the sinographs, a dictionary which is still invoked with reverence today, there is no denying them. The impact that such designations have had on the consciousness of those who are on both the receiving end and the giving-end is enormous. (2010: n.p.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Huichol art''' broadly groups the most traditional and most recent innovations in the [[Mexican handcrafts and folk art|folk art and handcrafts]] produced by the [[Huichol people]], who live in the states of [[Jalisco]], [[Durango]], [[Zacatecas]] and [[Nayarit]] in Mexico.  The unifying factor of the work is the colorful decoration using symbols and designs which date back centuries. The most common and commercially successful products are "yarn paintings" and objects decorated with small commercially produced beads. Yarn paintings consist of commercial yarn pressed into boards coated with wax and resin and are derived from a ceremonial tablet called a neirika. The Huichol have a long history of beading, making the beads from clay, shells, corals, seeds and more and using them to make jewelry and to decorate bowls and other items. The "modern" beadwork usually consists of masks and wood sculptures covered in small, brightly colored commercial beads fastened with wax and resin.

While the materials have changed and the purpose of many of the items have changed from religious to commercial purposes, the designs have changed little, and many retain their religious and symbolic significance. Most outsiders experience Huichol art as tourists in areas such as [[Guadalajara, Jalisco|Guadalajara]] and [[Puerto Vallarta]], without knowing anything about the people who make the items, and the meanings of the designs. There are some notable Huichol artists in the yarn painting and beadwork fields, and both types of work have been commissioned for public display.

==The Huichol People==
[[File:Huichol indian.jpg|thumb|175px|Huichol woman and child]]
The [[Huichol people|Huichols]] are an indigenous people who mostly live in the mountainous areas of northern Jalisco and parts of Nayarit in north central Mexico, with the towns of San Andrés, Santa Catarina and San Sebastián as major cultural centers. Their numbers are estimated at 50,000 and the name Huichol is derived from the word Wirriarika, which means soothsayer or medicine man in the [[Huichol language]].&lt;ref name="survival2"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/3165-huichol-art-a-matter-of-survival-part-two.html |title= Huichol art, a matter of survival II: authenticity and commercialization |author=Ronald A. Barnett |date=January 1, 2009 |publisher=Mexconnect |issn=1028-9089 |accessdate=June 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CRUribe"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Uribe |first=Carlos Rios  |date=September–October 1996 |title= In the track of the deer |journal=Art Education |volume=48 |issue=5 |page=6  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Spanish]] arrived in the 16th century, the Huichols retreated into the rugged mountains of northern Jalisco and Nayarit. While nominally converted to Christianity in the colonial period by Franciscan missionaries, most of the native Huichol culture managed to survive intact due to the isolation, and because the area lacked mineral or other resources of interest to the Spanish.&lt;ref name="survival2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dkarla"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Primosch |first=karla  |author2=Kathy David |date=November 2001 |title= Art of the Huichol people: A symbolic link to an ancient culture |journal=Art Education |volume=54 |issue=6 |pages=25–32  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mexican historian and anthropologist [[Fernando Benítez]] states that the Huichols have probably maintained their ancient belief systems better than any other indigenous group in Mexico.&lt;ref name="CRUribe"/&gt;  Much of this isolationist tendency remains intact although economic circumstances have forced a number of Huichols to migrate to areas such as Guadalajara, and coastal areas to work or sell their wares.&lt;ref name="CRUribe"/&gt;

The religious faith of the Huichols is still based on a "trinity" of veneration of the deer, corn and [[peyote]]. The last is ritually gathered each year on a long pilgrimage to the desert area of [[San Luis Potosí]], where the people are said to have originated and used by [[shaman]]s.&lt;ref name="CRUribe"/&gt;  The importance of this and the pantheon of gods is seen in their stylistic representations on just about everything that the Huichol decorate. They did not have a written language until recently, so these symbols were and are the primary form of preserving the ceremonies, myths and beliefs of ancient Huichol religion.&lt;ref name="dkarla"/&gt;

==Yarn painting and beadwork==
[[File:StringArt1MAPDF.JPG|thumb|Yarn painting at the Museo de Arte Popular in Mexico City]]
[[File:MaskWomanTep.JPG|thumb|Beaded mask on sale in Tepotzotlán, State of Mexico]]
The best known Huichol art is made with modern, commercially produced items such as yarn and small beads. The [[Tepehuán]]es of [[Durango]] adapted the yarn paintings. These have replaced many of the traditional materials such as clay, stone and vegetable dyes.&lt;ref name="survival2"/&gt;  Making and decorating items with beads did not begin with importation of European glass beads, as it did with a number of indigenous cultures to the far north.  Techniques for making and using beads have been in place long before that with beads made from bone, clay, stone, coral, [[turquoise]], [[pyrite]], [[jade]] and seeds.&lt;ref name="survival2"/&gt;  Huichol art was first documented in the very late 19th century by [[Carl Lumholtz]]. This includes the making of beaded earrings, necklaces, anklets and more.&lt;ref name="survival2"/&gt;

What mostly links the yarn paintings and beaded objects made today is the continuance of the traditional patterns used for centuries to represent and communicate with the gods.&lt;ref name="CRUribe"/&gt;  The use of commercial materials has allowed for the production of more elaborate designs and brighter colors, as well as more flexibility in how traditional concepts are rendered.&lt;ref name="survival2"/&gt;  It has also allowed that the production of commercialized folk art along with the production of strictly religious items.&lt;ref name="4survival"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/3441-huichol-art-a-matter-of-survival-part-four |title= Huichol art, a matter of survival IV: an art in evolution |author=Ronald A. Barnett |date= May 18, 2009 |publisher=Mexconnect |issn=1028-9089 |accessdate=June 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The commercialization of Huichol art began when a [[Franciscan order|Franciscan]] priest by the name of Ernesto Loera Ochoa began a Huichol museum at the [[Basilica of Our Lady of Zapopan]] just north of Guadalajara. One of the artists exhibited here was Ramón Medina Silver, whose work was exhibited and sold at the museum. Medina’s work came to the attention of American [[Peter Furst]], who suggested that Ramón represent the traditions and beliefs of his people by pressing colored yarn into a wax and resin-covered baseboard.&lt;ref name="originsbarnett"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/3262.html |title= Huichol art, a matter of survival I: Origins |author=Ronald A. Barnett |date=January 1, 2009 |publisher=Mexconnect |issn=1028-9089 |accessdate=June 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These yarn paintings first appeared in 1962 in Guadalajara and were derived from "nierikas" a small board or disc with a hole or mirror in the center. Nierikas were initially produced by shamans to represent visions they experienced while consuming peyote, then left as offerings to the gods in places such as caves, temples and streams.&lt;ref name="dkarla"/&gt;

These modern yarn paintings quickly proved popular and were imitated. They have also developed into complex designs which can take weeks to complete.&lt;ref name="dkarla"/&gt;&lt;ref name="originsbarnett"/&gt; The yarn paintings led to experimentation with other commercially produced materials such as beads, which have taken the place of yarn for many Huichol artisans. This beading has been expanded to include the decoration of jaguar heads, masks of the sun and moon and various animal forms.&lt;ref name="originsbarnett"/&gt;

This art produced for commercial purposes has provided an important, sustainable source of income for the Huichols. Even though new materials are being used, traditional symbols are maintained and transmitted to younger generations.&lt;ref name="CRUribe"/&gt;  However, the production of goods for commercial markets has caused a certain amount of controversy. One question concerns the "authenticity" of the yarn and bead art given the current forms’ modern origins. One person to do this was Fernando Benítez, who was particularly disturbed by the depiction of the dead as floating heads in yarn paintings; something he said was not traditionally Huichol. (origensbarnett) Much of the "authenticity" of the modern works has to do with the continued use of traditional symbols and designs. However, some items of Huichol items can be deemed non-traditional or borderline traditional, such as the production of Christmas tree decorations, masks of the sun and moon, the use of the [[jaguar]] (a [[Mesoamerica]]n symbol) and the incorporation of modern images such as airplanes and modern buildings into designs.&lt;ref name="4survival"/&gt; Selling of the items has not been easy for the Huichol either, with limited outlets such as tourist venues, especially Puerto Vallarta, Guadalajara and [[San Miguel de Allende]] as well as sales to middlemen who can earn much more from the works than they can.(CRUruibe)

==Noted Huichol artists==
[[File:InsideMuseoHuicholZapopan.JPG|thumb|Inside the Huichol museum in the Basilica of Zapopan, Jalisco]]
Notable Huichol artists include Emeteria Ríos Martínez, who has done a number of yarn painting murals.&lt;ref name="banderas"&gt;{{cite news |title= Institute of the Americas Hosts Huichol Art Exhibit |url= http://www.banderasnews.com/1002/art-ioahuicholexhibit.htm |newspaper=Banderas News |location=Puerta Vallarta |date=February 21, 2010 |accessdate=June 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; José Benítez Sánchez is a shaman-artist, who helped to expand yarn painting from its early decorative function to larger more vision like pieces.&lt;ref name="dmarsden"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Marsden |first=Dawn |date=Winter 2005 |title=Visions of a Huichol Shaman |journal=American Indian Quarterly |volume=29 |issue=1/2 |pages=302–304 |doi=10.1353/aiq.2005.0055}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pablo Taizan is also a shaman in the village of Mesa de Tirador. He principally does beadwork featuring animal figures used in healing.&lt;ref name="CRUribe"/&gt; [[Santos de la Torre]] made a great mural for the metro station Palais Royal at the Louvre, Paris.&lt;ref name="palais-royal"&gt;{{cite web|title=palais-royal
|url=http://metro-paris.fr/en/#/place/palais-royal-musee-du-louvre-station}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 Mexican portrait documentary '[[Echo of the Mountain]]', originally known in Spanish as Eco de la montaña&lt;ref name="echoofthemountain"&gt;{{cite web|title=echoofthemountain|url=http://echoofthemountain.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; directed by [[Nicolás Echevarría]] released based on his experiences during the mural creation.

==More traditional items==
Although the yarn paintings and items decorated with beads are the best known and most widely sold pieces, the Huichols continue to make a number of other types of folk art and handcrafts. Urus, or prayer arrows, are ceremonial arrows created to be shot into the air and petition the gods for special blessings. They are also sometimes left at certain places or sent down rivers. These arrows are decorated with symbols and designs related to the petition.&lt;ref name="dkarla"/&gt;

From the far past to the present, men, women and children all wear woven bags around their waist to carry personal objects. These bags are colored and otherwise decorated for aesthetic and to magically protect the wearer.&lt;ref name="dkarla"/&gt;

A "kuka" is a three dimensional ceremonial mask which is decorated by beading. These masks evolved from small gourd bowls originally covered in seeds, bone, clay, coral and shell, but these have been replaced by commercially produced beads. It is from these masks that the modern practice of covering wooden sculptures of snakes, dolls, small animals, jaguar heads and other forms is derived.&lt;ref name="dkarla"/&gt;

Nearika are highly decorated ceremonial objects that can be circular or diamond-shaped. When [[Carl Lumholtz]] did his writing on the Huichol, he named the circular ones "frontal shields" and the diamond-shaped ones as "eyes" and giving rise to the concept of the "[[God's eye]]s," applied to a Huichol cross. Nearika are tablets of wood or [[bamboo]] which are heavily decorated placed into certain sacred areas. Often they focus on a face of a sun, moon or person. From these the new tradition of yarn paintings developed, and the most traditional of these still show the round face of Tau, the Sun, in the middle.&lt;ref name="survival2"/&gt;

==Huichol decorative designs==
[[File:Huichol1FONART.JPG|thumb|Huichol beadwork for sale at the annual [[FONART]] exposition in Mexico City]]
Most outsiders are not aware that most Huichol patterns and designs have religious and cultural significance.&lt;ref name="haviland"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Haviland |first1=William A. |last2=Prins |first2=Harald E.L. |author3=Dana Walrath |title= Cultural anthropology: the human challenge |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jxzZl460258C&amp;pg=PA331&amp;lpg=PA331&amp;dq=huichol+beadwork&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sVrbjLdThf&amp;sig=HhyOSsckK4_cv-qTBz9dh5wtacA&amp;hl=es-419&amp;ei=nZ37TYKLNouftwePydi6Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBTiYAg#v=onepage&amp;q=huichol%20beadwork&amp;f=false |accessdate=June 21, 2011 |year=2005 |publisher= Cengage Learning |page=331 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These patterns can be found on a wide variety of objects including carved and beaded on masks, gourds, musical instruments and embroidered on clothing objects such as belts, sashes, side bags, and  more.&lt;ref name="survival2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CRUribe"/&gt;  Most have religious significance and many are influenced by visions which occur during peyote rituals.&lt;ref name="survival2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CRUribe"/&gt;&lt;ref name="haviland"/&gt;  Much of what is known about Huichol designs and symbols was put together by Norwegian explorer and ethnographer Carl Lumholtz in the late 19th century, but Huichol art and decoration has since become more varied.&lt;ref name="survival2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="originsbarnett"/&gt; However, plant and animal motifs remain the most common and most retain their original meaning.&lt;ref name="originsbarnett"/&gt;

When ceremonial or religious items are made, all aspects of the making from materials to colors to designs are important as they are identified with particular gods and meanings. [[Mesquite]] and the color reddish brown belong to Tatewari, who is of the earth and the wood of the Brazil tree is related to Tayuapa or "Father Sun." Symbols such as the [[golden eagle]] and [[macaw]]s are related to Tatewari. Shapes such as the deer, [[coyote]], pine tree or whirlwind can be associated with Tamat’s Kauyumari, who shaped the world. The salate tree, the [[armadillo]] and the bear are associated with Takutzi Nakahue, the mother of all gods and of corn.&lt;ref name="CRUribe"/&gt; The toto is a small white flower with five petals associated with the rainy season. Sashes and belts often have designs that mimic the markings on the backs of snakes, which are also associated with rain, along with good crops, health and long life.&lt;ref name="originsbarnett"/&gt; The zigzag lines that emanate from all living things represent communication with the deities.&lt;ref name="dkarla"/&gt; The butterfly motif is reminiscent of the Itzpapolotl or Obsidian Butterfly, a principal deity of the classical [[Aztec]]s.

The most common motifs are related to the three most important elements in Huichol religion, the deer, corn and [[peyote]]. The first two are important as primary sources of food, and the last is valued for its hallucinogenic properties which give shamans visions.&lt;ref name="3survival"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/3280-huichol-art-a-matter-of-survival-part-three |title= Huichol art, a matter of survival III: motifs and symbolism |author=Ronald A. Barnett |date= April 1, 2009 |publisher=Mexconnect |issn=1028-9089 |accessdate=June 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibitions of Huichol art==
Most outsiders’ experience with Huichol artwork comes from visiting areas such as [[Guadalajara, Jalisco|Guadalajara]] and [[Puerto Vallarta]] and seeing the work being sold. However, most do not know what it is. These vendors are mostly Huichol women who come into these cities from rural villages.&lt;ref name="banderas"/&gt;

The artwork varies greatly in size, with some as large as murals. In 2010, the Institute of the Americas at the [[University of California, San Diego]], held an exhibit of Huichol art targeting tourists who visit the west coast of Mexico, especially those who travel by boat.&lt;ref name="banderas"/&gt;

The [[Museo de Arte Popular, Mexico City|Museo de Arte Popular]] in [[Mexico City]] held a temporary exhibit in 2009 comparing the art of the Huichol people with that of the aborigines of northern Australia entitled "Magica huichol: rito aborigen" ("Huichol Magic: Aborigine Ritual").  The aim was not to show any historical connection but rather to show the similarity of style between two disparate cultures.&lt;ref name="tmargolis"&gt;{{cite news |title= Huichol and aboriginal art: Two indigenous visions |first=Therese |last=Margolis |newspaper=McClatchy - Tribune Business News |location=Washington, DC |date=March 2, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Bead Museum]] in [[Glendale, Arizona]], held an exhibit called "The HuicholWeb of Life: Creation and Prayer".&lt;ref name="dkarla"/&gt;

Huichol work has been commissioned for public display.  There is a permanent display of twelve Huichol murals at the [[San Diego International Airport|Lindbergh International Airport]] at Terminal 3.&lt;ref name="banderas"/&gt; A Huichol bead mural was commissioned for the [[Paris Métro]] at the [[Palais Royal – Musée du Louvre (Paris Métro)|Palais Royal-Musee de Louvre station]]. It was donated by the [[Mexico City Metro]] to France, as a returned favor for the [[Art Nouveau]] [[Metro Bellas Artes|Bellas Artes station]] entrance which was donated by France to Mexico. The work is called "Huichol Thought and Soul" and measures 2.4 by 3 meters in total divided into 80 panels of 30&amp;nbsp;cm by 30&amp;nbsp;cm, created by artist [[Santos de la Torre]].&lt;ref name="donaran"&gt;{{cite news |title= Donaran a Paris un mural huichol |author=Dora Luz Haw |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=September 19, 1997 |page=1 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Donating to Paris a Huichol mural }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most recent commissioned works is the "[[Vochol]]," a [[Volkswagen Beetle]] which was covered in Huichol designs using 2,277,000 beads fastened to the body of the car using a special heat-resistant resin. The car was commissioned by the Association of Friends of the Museo de Arte Popular and other public and private enterprises to be auctioned off to benefit Mexican artisans.&lt;ref name="mensaje"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.conaculta.gob.mx/sala_prensa_detalle.php?id=10228  |title= El Vochol, un vehículo para llevar el mensaje del pensamiento y la filosofía del pueblo huichol |publisher=[[CONACULTA]] |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=The Vochol, a vehicle to carry the message of the thought and philosophy of the Huichol people |date=December 10, 2010 |accessdate=June 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="inauguran"&gt;{{cite news |title=Inauguran el Vochol, auto intervenido por huicholes a base de chaquira |author= |url=http://www.milenio.com/cdb/doc/noticias2011/75b72844da8089d57a31be8af1cb2327 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120906002448/http://www.milenio.com/cdb/doc/noticias2011/75b72844da8089d57a31be8af1cb2327 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 6, 2012 |agency=Notimex |newspaper=Milenio |location=Mexico City |date=December 9, 2010 |accessdate=June 14, 2011 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Inaugurate the Vochol, auto modified by Huichols with beads }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Interactive Learning''' is a pedagogical approach that incorporates [[social networking]] and [[urban computing]] into course design and delivery.  Interactive Learning has evolved out of the hyper-growth in the use of digital technology and virtual communication, particularly by students.  Beginning around 2000, students entering institutes of higher education have expected that interactive learning will be an integral part of their education.  The use of interactive technology in learning for these students is as natural as using a pencil and paper were to past generations.

The Net Generation or [[Generation Y]] is the first generation to grow up in constant contact with digital media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tapscott|first=D|title=Growing Up Digital: The Rise of the Net Generation|year=1998|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also known as [[digital natives]], their techno-social, community bonds to their naturalized use of technology in every aspect of learning, to their ability to learn in new ways outside the classroom, this generation of students is pushing the boundaries of education.  The use of digital media in education has led to an increase in the use of and reliance on interactive learning, which in turn has led to a revolution in the fundamental process of education.

Increasingly, students and teachers rely on each other to access sources of knowledge and share their information, expanding the general scope of the educational process to include not just instruction, but the expansion of knowledge.  The role change from keeper of knowledge to facilitator of learning presents a challenge and an opportunity for educators to dramatically change the way their students learn.  The boundaries between teacher and student have less meaning with interactive learning.

==Paradigm Shifts in Education==
Interactivity as a pedagogical technique requires a fundamental change in the way education is delivered.  Tapscott &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tapscott|first=D|title=Growing Up Digital: The Rise of the Net Generation|year=1998|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; has identified 7 ways this change occurs:
*From linear to hypermedia learning.
*From the teacher as transmitter to the teacher as facilitator.

==Components of Interactive Learning==
===Social Media===
The socialization of education is evolving in the form of personalized digital media sources.  Web logs, or [[blogs]], enable students to express thoughts and ideas individually, while at the same time sharing them with the larger community.  The pervasiveness of social networks like [[MySpace]] and [[Facebook]] connect millions of learners to a virtual community where information is exchanged laterally between and among students and teachers alike.  This explosion of community is contributing to an expanding learning economy, where participants have unparalleled access to knowledge, both from teachers and other students.

===Urban Computing===
This set of technologies includes the use of [[wireless networks]], [[smart phones]] and [[PDAs]], [[search engines]], and [[location-based media]].  Urban computing allows enhanced interactivity between people and their environment through the use of these technologies.  For Interactive Learning, this means that students are able to assimilate knowledge specific to their location.

===Serious Games===
The concept of [[serious games]] involves immersing students in virtual worlds by means of role-playing and community interactive games.  For learning, this means that the cooperative, critical-thinking, and problem-solving practices encouraged in digital games make serious games a key form of pedagogy.  Adapting gaming to a form of experiential learning brings real-world issues into education within the structure of a planned curriculum.  Along with their intrinsically engaging properties, games have been touted for their ability to teach ill-defined problem-solving skills, elicit creativity, and develop leadership, collaboration, and other valuable interpersonal skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gee|first=J|title=What Video Games Have to Teach Us About Learning and Literacy|year=2003|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applying Interactive Learning==
In order to be effective, learning institutions must see computers and associated technology as an essential part of the student.  In other words, technology must be seen as cognitive prosthetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=S|title=Emergence: The Connected Lives of Ants, Brains, Cities, and Software|year=2001|publisher=Scribner|location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt; The core concept of [[distance education]] is that the real world becomes the learning environment; in this environment, the purpose of the instructor is to help facilitate the absorption of knowledge through both real-world and virtual learning experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nilles|first=J|title=Some Historical Thoughts on the ee-Learning Renaissance|url=http://www.innovateonline.info/index.php?view=article&amp;id=346|work=Innovate|publisher=Innovate Online|accessdate=2007-09-19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013114108/http://www.innovateonline.info/index.php?view=article&amp;id=346|archivedate=2007-10-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Historically, one of the obstacles to [[distance education]] is the lack of face to face contact.  The use of technology as an integral part of course design has attempted to compensate in both synchronous and asynchronous settings.

For delivery of synchronous content, technologies such as [[videoconferencing]] and [[web conferencing]] are typically used.  An example of this is the growing use of [[Skype]] and [[GoToMeeting]] for virtual class discussions and lectures. For asynchronous content delivery, course designers use a variety of software suites that include various types of interactive elements. Programs such as [[WebCT]], [[Knowledge Forum]], [[FirstClass]] and [[Blackboard Learning System]] attempt to ameliorate the lack of contact with online discussion forums and bulletin boards.

'''Kannada literature''' ('''ಕನ್ನಡ''' '''ಸಾಹಿತ್ಯ''') is the [[Text corpus|corpus]] of written forms of the [[Kannada language]], a member of the [[Dravidian language|Dravidian]] [[Language family|family]] spoken mainly in the [[India]]n state of [[Karnataka]] and written in the [[Kannada script]].&lt;ref&gt;
Krishnamurti (2003), p. 78; Steever (1998), p. 129, 131.&lt;/ref&gt;

Attestations in literature span something like one and a half millennia,&lt;ref&gt;
Ramanujan, A. K. (1973), ''Speaking of Śiva'' Harmondsworth: Penguin, p. 11, {{ISBN|0-14-044270-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="metrical"&gt;
R.S. Mugali (2006), ''The Heritage of Karnataka'', pp. 173–175 {{ISBN|1-4067-0232-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://original.britannica.com/eb/article-9044579 Kannada literature]. (2008). [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]: "The earliest records in Kannada are full length inscriptions dating from the 5th century AD onward. The earliest literary work is the Kavirajamarga (c. AD 850), a treatise on poetics based on a Sanskrit model."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[David Crystal]]'s ''Dictionary of Language'', {{Harv|Crystal|2001|p=177}}, "...&amp;nbsp;with inscriptions dating from the late 6th century AD,&amp;nbsp;...&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Other scholars have dated the earliest Kannada inscription to 450 A.D.{{Harv|Master|1944|pp=297–307}}, 500 A.D. {{Harv|Mugali|1975|p=2}}, and "about 500" {{Harv|Pollock|1996|pp=331–332}}.  Epigraphist [[G. S. Gai]] has dated it to the "end of the fifth century A. D. or the beginning of the 6th century A.D." {{Harv|Gai|1992|pp=300–301}}; epigraphist, [[D. C. Sircar]] to "about the end of the 6th century," ({{Harvnb|Sircar|1965|p=48}})&lt;/ref&gt;
with some specific literary works surviving in rich manuscript traditions, extending from the 9th century to the present.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kamil Zvelebil|Zvelebil]] (2008), p.2&lt;/ref&gt;
The Kannada language is usually divided into three linguistic phases: Old (450–1200 CE), Middle (1200–1700 CE) and Modern (1700–present);&lt;ref&gt;
Steever, S.B. (1998), p. 129; Krishnamurti (2003), p. 23; Pollock (2007), p. 81; Sahitya Akademi, ''Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature, vol. 2'' (1988), p. 1717&lt;/ref&gt;
and its literary characteristics are categorised  as [[Jainism|Jain]], [[Lingayatism|Veerashaiva]] and [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnava]]—recognising the prominence of these three faiths in giving form to, and fostering, classical expression of the language, until the advent of the modern era.&lt;ref name="ancient"&gt;
Kittel in Rice E.P. (1921), p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oldest"&gt;Sastri 1955, pp. 355–365&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oldest1"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1934), pp. 17, 61&lt;/ref&gt;
Although much of the literature prior to the 18th&amp;nbsp;century was religious, some secular works were also committed to writing.&lt;ref name="sec"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1934), pp. 61–65&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="styles"&gt;Rice E. P, (1921), p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting with the ''[[Kavirajamarga]]'' (''[[circa|c]]''. 850), and until the middle of the 12th&amp;nbsp;century, literature in Kannada was almost exclusively composed by the [[Jainism|Jains]], who found eager patrons in the [[Chalukya]], [[Western Ganga Dynasty|Ganga]], [[Rashtrakuta]], [[Hoysala]]&lt;ref name="bud"&gt;
Narasimhacharya (1934), pp. 1, 65; Sastri (1955), pp. 355–366&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bud1"&gt;Rice E.P. (1921), p. 17; Kamath (1980), pp. 49–50, 67, 88–90, 114–115, 132–134&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Yadavas of Devagiri|Yadava]] kings.&lt;ref name="dal"&gt;Dalby (1998), p. 300; Masica (1993), pp. 45–46; Kamath (1980), pp. 143–144&lt;/ref&gt;
Although the ''Kavirajamarga'', authored during the reign of [[Amoghavarsha|King Amoghavarsha]], is the oldest extant literary work in the language, it has been generally accepted by modern scholars that prose, verse and grammatical traditions must have existed earlier.&lt;ref&gt;
Sahitya Akademi (1988), pp. 1474–1475; Sastri (1955), p. 355; Steever (1998), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;N.S.

The [[Veerashaiva]] movement of the 12th century created new literature which flourished alongside the Jain works.&lt;ref name="body"/&gt;  With the waning of Jain influence during the 14th-century [[Vijayanagara empire]],  a new [[Vaishnava]] literature grew rapidly in the 15th century; the [[Bhakti movement|devotional movement]] of the itinerant [[Haridasa]] saints marked the high point of this era.&lt;ref name="devaranama"/&gt;

After the decline of the Vijayanagara empire in the 16th century, Kannada literature was supported by the various rulers, including the [[Wodeyar]]s of the [[Kingdom of Mysore]] and the [[Nayakas of Keladi]].  In the 19th century, some literary forms, such as the prose narrative, the novel, and the short story, were borrowed from English literature. Modern Kannada literature is now widely known and recognised: during the last half century, Kannada language authors have received eight [[Jnanpith]] awards, 60 [[List of Sahitya Akademi Award winners for Kannada|Sahitya Akademi awards]] and 9 [[List of Sahitya Akademi fellows|Sahitya Akademi Fellowship]]s in India.&lt;ref name="jnanpith"/&gt;&lt;ref name="award"&gt;Murthy (1997), p. 190&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sahitya"/&gt;

{{Native Kannada poetic metres}}
In the early period and beginning of the medieval period, between the 9th and 13th centuries, writers were predominantly [[Jainism|Jain]]s and [[Lingayatism|Lingayat]]s. Jains were the earliest known cultivators of Kannada literature, which they dominated until the 12th century, although a few works by Lingayats from that period have survived.&lt;ref name="poetics11"/&gt; Jain authors wrote about [[Tirthankara]]s and other aspects of religion. The Veerashaiva authors wrote about [[Shiva]], his 25 forms, and the expositions of [[Shaivism]]. Lingayat poets belonging to the [[vachana sahitya]] tradition advanced the philosophy of [[Basava]] from the 12th century.&lt;ref name="body"/&gt;

During the period between the 13th and 15th centuries, there was decline in Jain writings and an increase in the number of works from the Lingayat tradition; there were also contributions from Vaishnava writers. Thereafter, Lingayat and [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnava]] writers dominated Kannada literature. Vaishnava writers focused on the Hindu epics – the [[Ramayana]], the [[Mahabharata]] and the [[Bhagavata]] – as well as [[Vedanta]] and other subjects from the [[Puranas|Puranic]] traditions.&lt;ref name="sec"/&gt;&lt;ref name="poetics11"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1934), p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="topics"/&gt; The devotional songs of the [[Haridasa]] poets, performed to [[Haridasas and Carnatic music|music]], were first noted in the 15th century.&lt;ref name="yathi trayaru"/&gt; Writings on secular subjects remained popular throughout this period.&lt;ref name="topics"/&gt;

An important change during the [[Bhakti]] "devotion" period starting in the 12th century was the decline of court literature and the rise in popularity of shorter genres such as the ''vachana'' and ''kirthane'', forms that were more accessible to the common man.&lt;ref name="hayday"&gt;Shiva Prakash (1997) p. 163&lt;/ref&gt;  Writings eulogising kings, commanders and spiritual heroes waned, with a proportional increase in the use of local genres. Kannada literature moved closer to the spoken and sung folk traditions, with musicality being its hallmark, although some poets continued to use the ancient ''[[champu]]'' form of writing as late as the 17th century.&lt;ref name="sing"&gt;Shiva Prakash (1997), pp. 167, 202&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Kappe Arabhatta inscription at Badami.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Kannada poetry on stone–7th century [[Kappe Arabhatta]] inscription]]
The ''champu'' Sanskritic metre (poems in verses of various metres interspersed with paragraphs of prose, also known as ''champu-kavya'') was the most popular written form from the 9th century onwards, although it started to fall into disuse in the 12th century.&lt;ref name="rag"/&gt; Other Sanskritic metres used were the ''saptapadi'' (seven line verse), the ''ashtaka'' (eight line verse) and the ''shataka'' (hundred-line verse).&lt;ref name="ashtaka100"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1987), p. 248&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sapta"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kadur1"&gt;Shiva Prakash (1997), p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; There were numerous translations and adaptations of Sanskrit writings into Kannada and, to a lesser extent, from Kannada into Sanskrit.&lt;ref name="few"/&gt; The medieval period saw the development of literary [[Meter (poetry)|metres]] indigenous to the Kannada language. These included the ''[[tripadi]]'' (three-line verse, in use from the 7th century), one of the oldest native metres; the ''shatpadi'' (six-line verse, first mentioned by [[Nagavarma I]] in ''Chhandombudhi'' of c.&amp;nbsp;984 and in use from 1165), of which six types exist; the ''ragale'' (lyrical narrative compositions, in use from 1160); the ''sangatya'' (compositions meant to be sung with a musical instrument, in use from 1232) and the ''akkara'' which came to be adopted in some [[Telugu literature|Telugu]] writings.&lt;ref name="rag"&gt;Rice E.P. (1921), p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rag1"&gt;Shiva Prakash in Ayyappapanicker (1997), p. 203&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="akka"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1934), p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chandom"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1996), pp. 4002–4003&lt;/ref&gt; There were rare interactions with Tamil literature, as well.&lt;ref name="few"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1934), p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

Though religious literature was prominent, literary genres including romance, fiction, erotica, satire, folk songs, fables and parables, musical treatises and musical compositions were popular. The topics of Kannada literature included grammar, philosophy, prosody, [[rhetoric]], chronicles, biography, history, drama and cuisine, as well as dictionaries and encyclopedias.&lt;ref name="topics"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1934), pp. 61–64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="topics1"&gt;Karmarkar (1947), p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; According to critic Joseph T. Shipley, over fifty works on scientific subjects including medicine, mathematics and astrology have been written in the Kannada language.&lt;ref name="fifty"&gt;Shipley (2007), p. 528&lt;/ref&gt;

Kannada literature of this period was mainly written on palm leaves. However, more than 30,000 more durable inscriptions on stone (known as ''shilashasana'') and copper plates (known as ''tamrashasana'') have survived to inform modern students of the historical development of Kannada literature.&lt;ref name="butuga"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1988),  p. 1717&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Shravanabelagola inscription of Nandisena]] (7th century),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kappe Arabhatta]] inscription (c.&amp;nbsp;700), and the Hummacha and Soraba inscriptions (c.&amp;nbsp;800) are good examples of poetry in ''tripadi'' metre,&lt;ref name="soraba"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1996), p. 4392&lt;/ref&gt; and the Jura ([[Jabalpur]]) inscription of [[Krishna III|King Krishna III]] (964) is regarded as an [[Epigraph (literature)|epigraph]]ical landmark of classical Kannada composition, containing poetic diction in ''kanda'' metre, a form consisting of a group of stanzas or chapters.&lt;ref name="krishna"&gt;Kamath (1980), p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

Elegiac poetry on hundreds of ''veeragallu'' and ''maastigallu'' ([[hero stone]]s) written by unknown poets in the ''kanda'' and the ''vritta'' (commentary) metre mourn the death of heroes who sacrificed their lives and the bravery of women who performed ''[[Sati (practice)|sati]]''.&lt;ref name="masti"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1988), p. 1150&lt;/ref&gt; According to the scholar [[T. V. Venkatachala Sastry]], the book ''Karnataka Kavicharitre'' compiled by Kannada scholar R. Narasimhachar lists over one thousand anonymous pieces of Kannada literature that cover an array of topics under religious and secular categories. Some fifty ''Vachana'' poets are known only by the pen names (''ankita'') used in their poems. Most Jain writings included in the list are from the period 1200–1450 CE, while Veerashaiva and Vaishnava writings are from later periods. Secular topics include mathematics, medicine, science of horses and elephants, architecture, geography and hydrology.&lt;ref name="anonymous"&gt;Sahtiya Akademi (1987), pp. 183–184&lt;/ref&gt;

The pace of change towards more modern literary styles gained momentum in the early 19th century. Kannada writers were initially influenced by the modern literature of other languages, especially English.&lt;ref name="changes"&gt;Murthy (1997), p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; Modern English education and liberal democratic values inspired social changes, intertwined with the desire to retain the best of traditional ways.&lt;ref name="evident"&gt;Kamath (2001), pp. 277–278&lt;/ref&gt; New genres including short stories, novels, literary criticism, and essays, were embraced as Kannada prose moved toward modernisation.&lt;ref name="dramatic"&gt;Murthy (1997), pp. 189–190&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical period==
===Rashtrakuta court===
{{Main article|Extinct Kannada literature|Rashtrakuta literature|Western Ganga literature}}
[[File:kavi file2.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A stanza from [[Kavirajamarga]] (c. 850) in [[Kannada]] praising the people for their literary skills]]
The reign of the imperial [[Rashtrakuta Dynasty|Rashtrakutas]] and their powerful [[vassal|feudatory]], the [[Western Ganga Dynasty|Gangas]], marks the beginning of the classical period of writings in the Kannada language under royal patronage, and the end of the age of Sanskrit epics.&lt;ref name="rayal"&gt;Kamath (1980), p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;

There was an emphasis on the adoption of Sanskritic models while retaining elements of local literary traditions, a style that prevailed in Kannada literature throughout the classical period.&lt;ref name="influence:Sanskrit"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1988), p. 1699&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kavirajamarga'', written during this period, is a treatise on the Kannada speaking people, their poetry and their language.&lt;ref name="glowing"&gt;Rice B.L. (1897), p. 326&lt;/ref&gt; A portion of the writing qualifies as a practical grammar. It describes defective and corrective examples (the "do's and don't's") of versification and native composition styles recognised by earlier poets (''puratana kavis''). These composition meters are the  ''bedande'', the ''chattana'' and the ''gadyakatha''&amp;nbsp;– compositions written in various interspersed [[Metre (poetry)|metres]]. In some contexts, the term ''puravcharyar'', which may refer to previous grammarians or rhetoricians, have also been mentioned.&lt;ref name="metrical"/&gt;&lt;ref name="poetics11"/&gt;&lt;ref name="versi"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1988), pp. 1474–1475&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians attribute ''Kavirajamarga'' to the Rashtrakuta king [[Amoghavarsha I]], but others believe that the book may have been inspired by the king and co-authored or authored in full by Srivijaya, a Kannada language theorist and court poet.&lt;ref name="kavi100"&gt;Rice E.P., (1921), pp. 25, 28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gun100"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1934), p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pathak"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1988), pp. 1474, 1699&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest existing prose piece in old Kannada is ''[[Vaddaradhane]]'' ("Worship of Elders", 9th century) by [[Shivakotiacharya]].&lt;ref name="siva"&gt;Sastri (1955), p. 356&lt;/ref&gt; It contains 19 lengthy stories, some in the form of fables and parables, such as "The Sage and the Monkey". Inspired by the earlier Sanskrit writing ''Brihatkatha Kosha'', it is about Jain tenets and describes issues of [[Reincarnation|rebirth]], [[karma]], the plight of humans on earth, and social issues of the time such as education, trade and commerce, magic, superstition, and the condition of women in society.&lt;ref name="fable"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1988), p. 1253&lt;/ref&gt;

The works of Jain writers [[Adikavi Pampa]], [[Sri Ponna]] and [[Ranna (Kannada poet)|Ranna]], collectively called the "three gems of Kannada literature", heralded the age of classical Kannada in the 10th century.&lt;ref name="topics1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="siva" /&gt; Pampa, who wrote ''[[Adipurana]]'' in 941, is regarded as one of the greatest Kannada writers.&lt;ref name="laks"&gt;Bhat (1993), p.  105&lt;/ref&gt; Written in ''champu'' style, ''Adipurana'' narrates the life history of the first Jain Thirtankar, [[Rishabhadeva]]. In this spiritual saga, Rishabhadeva's soul moves through a series of births before attaining [[emancipation]] in a quest for the liberation of his soul from the cycle of life and death.&lt;ref name="arike"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1988), p. 1180&lt;/ref&gt; Pampa's other classic, ''[[Vikramarjuna Vijaya]]'' (or ''Pampa Bharata'', 941), is loosely based on the Hindu epic the [[Mahabharata]].&lt;ref name="siva"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wife"&gt;Rice E.P. (1921), p.  31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="foible"/&gt;

Sri Ponna, patronised by [[Krishna III|King Krishna III]], wrote  ''Santipurana'' (950), a biography of the 16th Jain Tirthankar Shantinatha. He earned the title ''Ubhaya Kavichakravathi'' ("supreme poet in two languages") for his command of both Kannada and Sanskrit.&lt;ref name="ubhaya"&gt;Narasimhacharya 1934, p.  18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rhetoric"&gt;Kamath (1980), p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ghata"&gt;Rice, E.P. (1921), pp. 31–32&lt;/ref&gt; Although Sri Ponna borrowed significantly from [[Kalidasa]]'s earlier works, his ''Santipurana'' is considered an important Jain [[purana]].&lt;ref name="grace"/&gt;

===Chalukya court===
{{Main article|Western Chalukya literature in Kannada}}
[[Image:Handwriting (10th century) of Kannada poet Ranna at Shravanabelagola.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Inscribed handwriting of 10th-century poet [[Ranna (Kannada poet)|Ranna]] reads ''Kavi Ratna'' (''gem among poets'') in [[Shravanabelagola]]]]
From the late 10th century, Kannada literature made considerable progress under the patronage of the new overlords of the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]], the [[Western Chalukyas]] and their feudatories: the [[Hoysalas]], the southern [[Kalachuris of Kalyani]]s, the [[Seuna Yadavas of Devagiri]] and Silharas of [[Karad]].&lt;ref name="progress"&gt;Kamath (1980), pp. 114, 132–134, 143–144&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="horse"/&gt; The skill of Kannada poets was appreciated in distant lands. [[Bhoja|King Bhoja]] of [[Malwa]] in [[central India]] presented [[Nagavarma I]], a writer of [[Prosody (poetry)|prosody]] and romance classics, with horses as a mark of his admiration.&lt;ref name="horse"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1934), p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;

Ranna was the court poet of the Western Chalukya kings [[Tailapa II]] and [[Satyashraya]]. He was also patronised by [[Attimabbe]], a devout Jain woman.&lt;ref name="siva"/&gt; Ranna's poetic writings reached their zenith with ''Sahasa Bhima Vijaya'' ("Victory of the bold Bhima", also called ''Gada Yudda'' or "Battle of Clubs", 982),  which describes the conflict between [[Bhima]] and [[Duryodhana]] in his version of the Mahabharata epic, one of the earliest poetic elegies in the Kannada language.&lt;ref name="grace"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1987), p. 620&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="run"&gt;Rice E.P. (1921), p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="valour"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1988), p. 1149&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Pampa, who glorified [[Arjuna]] and [[Karna]] in his writing, Ranna eulogised his patron King Satyashraya and favourably compared him to Bhima, whom he crowned at the end of the Mahabharata war. His other well-known writing is the ''[[Ajitha purana]]'' (993), which recounts the life of the second Jain Tirthankar Ajitanatha.&lt;ref name="kanda"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1988), p. 1024&lt;/ref&gt; Ranna was bestowed the title ''Kavi Chakravathi'' ("Emperor among poets") by his patron king.&lt;ref name="siva"/&gt;

Among grammarians, [[Nagavarma II|Nagavarma-II]], ''Katakacharya'' (poet laureate) of the Chalukya king [[Jagadhekamalla II]] made significant contributions with his works in grammar, poetry, prosody, and vocabulary; these are standard authorities and their importance to the study of Kannada language is well acknowledged.&lt;ref name="kataka"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1934), pp. 64–65,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="naga"&gt;Rice E.P. (1921), p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; Among his other writings, the ''Kavyavalokana'' on grammar and rhetoric and the ''Karnataka Bhashabhushana'' (1145) on grammar are historically significant.&lt;ref name="vastu"&gt;Sastri 1955, p. 358&lt;/ref&gt; However, the discovery of ''Vardhamana Puranam'' (1042), which has been ascribed by some scholars to Nagavarma II, has created uncertainty about his actual lifetime since it suggests that he may have lived a century earlier and been patronised by  [[Jayasimha II (Western Chalukya dynasty)|Jayasimha II]].&lt;ref name="varadamana"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1988), p. 1475&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hoysala period==
{{Main article|Hoysala literature}}
[[Image:Hero Stone with old-Kannada inscription at Arasikere.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Hero stone]] (''virgal'') with ''old Kannada'' elegiac inscription (1220) at the Ishwara temple in [[Arasikere]], Karnataka]]

In the late 12th century, the [[Hoysala Empire|Hoysalas]], a powerful hill tribe from the [[Malnad]] region in modern southern Karnataka, exploited the political uncertainty in the Deccan to gain dominance in the region south of the [[Krishna River]] in southern India.&lt;ref name="dom1"&gt;Derret and Coelho in Kamath (1980), pp. 124–126&lt;/ref&gt; A new chronological era was adopted, imperial titles were claimed and Kannada literature flourished with such noted scholars as [[Janna]], [[Harihara (poet)|Harihara]], [[Rudrabhatta]], [[Raghavanka]], [[Keshiraja]] and others.&lt;ref name="ragha"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1934), pp. 19–21&lt;/ref&gt; An important achievement during this period was the establishment of native metres in literature (the ''ragale'', the ''tripadi'', the ''sangatya'' and the ''shatpadi'').&lt;ref name="rag" /&gt;

Two renowned philosophers who lived during this time, [[Ramanujacharya]] and [[Madhvacharya]], influenced the culture of the region.&lt;ref name="ramanuja"&gt;Kamath (1980), pp. 50–52, 54–56&lt;/ref&gt; The conversion of the Hoysala [[Vishnuvardhana|King Vishnuvardhana]] in the early 12th century from Jainism to Vaishnavism was to later prove a setback to Jain literature. In the decades to follow, Jain writers faced competition from the Veerashaivas, to which they responded with rebuttals,&lt;ref name="rebut"&gt;Nagaraj in Pollock (2003), p. 366&lt;/ref&gt; and from the 15th century, from the writers of the Vaishnava cadre. These events changed the literary landscape of the Kannada-speaking region forever.&lt;ref name="decline"&gt;Rice E.P. (1921), pp. 45–46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="decline1"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1934), p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest Veerashaiva writers who was not part of the ''Vachana'' literary tradition, poet Harihara (or Harisvara) came from a family of ''karnikas'' (accountants), and worked under the patronage of [[Narasimha I|King Narasimha I]]. He wrote ''Girijakalyana'' in ten sections following the [[Kalidasa]] tradition, employing the old Jain ''champu'' style, with the story leading to the marriage of [[Shiva]] and [[Parvati]].&lt;ref name="Parvati"&gt;Sastri (1955), pp. 361–362&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kavichakra"/&gt; In a deviation from the norm, Harihara avoided glorifying saintly mortals. He is credited with more than 100 poems in ''ragale'' metre, called the ''Nambiyanana ragale'' (or ''Shivaganada ragale'', 1160) praising the saint Nambiyana  and  [[Shiva|Virupaksha]] (a form of Hindu god Shiva).&lt;ref name="har"&gt;Rice E.P. (1921), p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; For his poetic talent, he has earned the honorific ''utsava kavi'' ("poet of exuberance").&lt;ref name="harish"/&gt;

Harihara's nephew, Raghavanka, was the first to introduce the ''shatpadi'' metre into Kannada literature in  his epic ''Harishchandra Kavya'' (1200), considered a classic despite occasionally violating strict rules of [[Kannada grammar]].&lt;ref name="kavichakra"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hari"&gt;Sastri (1955), p. 362&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing on his skill as a dramatist, Raghavanka's story of [[Harishchandra|King Harishchandra]] vividly describes the clash of personalities between sage [[Vishvamitra]] and sage [[Vashistha|Vashisht]] and between Harishchandra and Vishvamitra. It is believed that this interpretation of the story of Harishchandra is unique to Indian literature. The writing is an original and does not follow any established epic traditions.&lt;ref name="harish"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1988), pp. 1181&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to Hoysala patronage, Raghavanka was honoured by [[Kakatiya]] king Prataparudra I.&lt;ref name="horse"/&gt;

Rudrabhatta,  a [[Smartha]] Brahmin (believer of monistic philosophy), was the earliest well-known [[Vedic Brahmanism|Brahminical]] writer, under the patronage of Chandramouli, a minister of King Veera Ballala II.&lt;ref name="kavichakra"/&gt; Based on the earlier work of ''[[Vishnu Purana]]'', he wrote ''Jagannatha Vijaya'' (1180) in  the ''champu'' style, relating the life of [[Krishna|Lord Krishna]] leading up to his fight with the demon [[Banasura]].&lt;ref name="brahminical"&gt;Sastri (1955), p. 364&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1209, the  [[Jain]] scholar and army commander Janna wrote ''Yashodhara Charite'', a unique set of stories dealing with perversion. In one of the stories, a king intended to perform a ritual sacrifice of two young boys to Mariamma, a local deity. After hearing the boys' tale, the king is moved to release them and renounce the practice of human sacrifice.&lt;ref name="scarifice"&gt;Sastri (1955), pp. 358–359&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jan"&gt;Rice E.P. (1921), pp. 43–44&lt;/ref&gt; In honour of this work, Janna received the title ''Kavichakravarthi'' ("Emperor among poets")  from [[Veera Ballala II|King Veera Ballala II]].&lt;ref name="kavichakra"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1988), p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; His other classic, ''Anathanatha Purana'' (1230), deals with the life of the 14th Tirthankar Ananthanatha.&lt;ref name="grace"/&gt;

==Vijayanagara period==
{{Main article|Vijayanagara literature in Kannada}}
[[Image:Vijayanagara.jpg|thumb|right|upright|King Krishnadevaraya, patron of Vaishnava literature]]
The 14th century saw major upheavals in [[geo-politics]] of [[South India|southern India]] with Muslim empires invading from the north.  The [[Vijayanagara Empire]] stood as a bulwark against these invasions and created an atmosphere conducive to the development of the fine arts.&lt;ref name="golden"&gt;Kamath (1980), p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;
In a golden age of Kannada literature, competition between Vaishnava and Veerashaiva writers was fierce and literary disputations between the two sects were common, especially in the court of [[Deva Raya II|King Deva Raya II]]. Acute rivalry led to "organised processions" in honour of the classics written by poets of the respective sects.&lt;ref name="ganapathi"&gt;Sastri (1955), p. 363&lt;/ref&gt; The king himself was no less a writer, the romantic stories ''Sobagina Sone'' (''lit'' "The Drizzle of Beauty") and ''Amaruka'' are assigned to him.&lt;ref name="sone"&gt;Sinopoli (2003) pp. 130–131&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="amruka"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classicalkannada.org/DataBase/KannwordHTMLS/CLASSICAL%20KANNADA%20LITERATURE%20HTML/SOBAGINA%20SONE%20HTML.htm

To this period belonged [[Kumara Vyasa]] (the pen name of Naranappa), a doyen of medieval epic poets and one of the most influential Vaishnava poets of the time.  He was particularly known for his sophisticated use of [[metaphor]]s and had even  earned the title ''Rupaka Samrajya Chakravarti'' ("Emperor of the land of Metaphors"). In 1430, he wrote the ''Gadugina Bharata'', popularly known as ''Karnata Bharata Kathamanjari'' or ''Kumaravyasa Bharata'' in the [[Vyasa]] tradition.  The work is a translation of the first ten chapters of the epic ''Mahabharata'' and emphasises the divinity and grace of the Lord [[Krishna]], portraying all characters with the exception of Krishna to suffer from  human foibles.&lt;ref name="foible"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1987), p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; An interesting aspect of the work is the sense of humour exhibited by the poet and his hero, Krishna. This work marked a transition of Kannada literature to a more modern genre and heralded a new age combining poetic perfection with religious inspiration.&lt;ref name="brahminical" /&gt; The remaining ''parvas'' (chapters) of ''Mahabharata'' were translated by Timmanna Kavi (1510) in the court of [[Krishnadevaraya|King Krishnadevaraya]]. The poet named his work ''Krishnaraya Bharata'' after his patron king.&lt;ref name="brahminical"/&gt;

[[Kumara Valmiki]] (1500) wrote the first complete brahminical adaptation of the epic [[Ramayana]], called ''Torave Ramayana''. According to the author, the epic he wrote merely narrated God Shiva's conversation with his consort Parvati. This writing has remained popular for centuries and inspired folk theatre such as the ''[[Yakshagana]]'', which has made use of its verses as a script for enacting episodes from the great epic.&lt;ref name="torave"/&gt; In Valmiki's version of the epic, [[Ravana|King Ravana]] is depicted as one of the suitors at [[Sita]]'s ''[[Swayamvara]]'' (''lit.'' a ceremony of "choice of a husband"). His failure to win the bride's hand results in jealousy towards Rama, the eventual bridegroom. As the story progresses, [[Hanuman]], for all his services to Rama, is exalted to the status of "the next creator".  Towards the end of the story, during the war with Rama, Ravana realises that his adversary is none other than the God Vishnu and hastens to die at his hands to achieve salvation.&lt;ref name="torave"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1987), p. 38–39&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chamarasa]], a Veerashaiva poet, was a rival of Kumara Vyasa in the court of Devaraya II. His eulogy of the saint [[Allama Prabhu]], titled ''Prabhulinga Lile'' (1430), was later translated into Telugu and Tamil at the behest of his patron king. In the story, the saint was considered an incarnation of Hindu God [[Ganapathi]] while [[Parvati]] took the form of a princess of Banavasi.&lt;ref name="ganapathi" /&gt;

Interaction between Kannada and Telugu literatures, a trend which had begun in the Hoysala period, increased. Translations of classics from Kannada to Telugu and vice versa became popular. Well-known bilingual poets of this period were Bhima Kavi, Piduparti Somanatha and Nilakanthacharya. In fact, so well versed in Kannada were some Telugu poets, including [[Dhurjati]], that they freely used many Kannada terms in their Telugu writings. It was because of this "familiarity" with Kannada, that the notable writer [[Srinatha]] even called his Telugu, "Kannada". This process of interaction between the two languages continued into the 19th century in the form of translations by bilingual writers.&lt;ref name="viceversa"&gt;Srinatha called himself "Karnatadesakataka" (Narasimhacharya 1934, pp.  27–28)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Veerashaiva===
[[File:Plam leaf of 11th and 12th Century with Vachanas.jpg|thumb|left|Palm leaf with 11th–12th century Vachana poems in old Kannada]]
[[Image:Akkamahadevi Udathadi1.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Akka Mahadevi, 12th century female poet]]

In the late 12th century, the [[Kalachuris of Kalyani|Kalachuris]] successfully rebelled against their overlords, the Western Chalukyas, and annexed the capital [[Basavakalyan|Kalyani]]. During this turbulent period, a new religious faith called [[Veerashaivism]] (or Lingayatism) developed as a revolt against the existing social order of Hindu society. Some of the followers of this faith wrote literature called ''[[Vachana Sahitya]]'' ("Vachana literature") or ''Sharana Sahitya'' ("literature of the devotees") consisting of a unique and native form of poetry in [[free verse]] called ''[[Vachana]]''.&lt;ref name="body"&gt;Shiva Prakash (1997), pp. 166–187&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="body1"&gt;Kamath (1980), p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; [[Basavanna]] (or Basava, 1134–1196), the prime minister of Kalachuri [[Bijjala II|King Bijjala II]], is generally regarded as the inspiration for this movement.&lt;ref name="spear"&gt;Rice E.P. (1921), p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Devotees gathered to discuss their mystic experiences at a centre for religious discussion called [[Anubhava Mantapa]] ("hall of experience") in Kalyani.&lt;ref name="sang"/&gt; Here, they expressed their devotion to God Shiva in simple ''vachana'' poems. These poems were spontaneous utterances of rhythmic, epigrammatical, [[satire|satirical]] prose emphasising the worthlessness of riches, rituals and book learning, displaying a dramatic quality reminiscent of the dialogues of [[Plato]].&lt;ref name="epi"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1988), p. 1324&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="plat"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1987), p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;

Basavanna, [[Allama Prabhu]], Devara Dasimayya, [[Channabasavanna|Channabasava]], Siddharama (1150), and Kondaguli Kesiraja are the best known among numerous poets (called ''Vachanakaras'') who wrote in this genre. [[Akka Mahadevi]] was prominent among the several women poets; in addition to her poetry, she is credited with two short writings, ''Mantrogopya'' and ''Yogangatrividhi''. Siddharama is credited with writings in ''tripadi'' metre and 1,379 extant poems (though he has claimed authorship of 68,000 poems).&lt;ref name="kavichakra"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vachana"&gt;Rice B.L. in Sastri 1955, p. 361&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rythem"&gt;Shiva Prakash 1997, pp. 167–168, 178, 181&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rythem10"&gt;Nagaraj, 2003, p. 348&lt;/ref&gt;

The Veerashaiva movement experienced a setback with the assassination of King Bijjala and eviction of the ''sharanas'' (devotees) from Kalyani; further growth of ''Vachana'' poetry was curtailed until the 15th century when another wave of writings began under the patronage of the rulers of [[Vijayanagara]].&lt;ref name="sang"&gt;Kamath (2001), p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; Chieftain [[Nijaguna Shivayogi]] originated a new philosophy called ''Kaivalya'', founded on the [[advaitha]] (monistic) philosophy of [[Adi Shankara]], synthesised with an offshoot of the Veerashaiva faith. A prolific writer, Shivayogi composed devotional songs collectively known as the ''Kaivalya sahitya'' (or ''Tattva Padagalu'', literally "songs of the pathway to emancipation").&lt;ref name="devaranam1"/&gt; His songs were reflective, philosophical and concerned with [[Yoga]]. Shivayogi also wrote a highly respected scientific encyclopaedia called the ''Vivekachintamani''; it was translated into [[Marathi language]] in 1604 and Sanskrit language in 1652 and again in the 18th century. The encyclopaedia includes entries on 1,500 topics and covers a wide range of subjects including poetics, dance and drama, musicology and erotics.&lt;ref name="eros"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1988), p. 1165&lt;/ref&gt;

Other well-known poet saints of the Veerashaiva tradition include Muppina Sadakshari, a contemporary of Shivayogi, whose collection of songs are called the ''Subodhasara'', Chidananda Avadhuta of the 17th century and Sarpabhushana Shivayogi of the 18th century. So vast is this body of literature that much of it still needs to be studied.&lt;ref name="devaranam1"/&gt;

===Vaishnava===
[[Image:Kanakadasa art.jpg|thumb|x216px|right|Kanaka Dasa (c. 1509–1609)]]

The [[Vaishnava]] [[Bhakti]] (devotional) movement involving well-known Haridasas (devotee saints) of that time made an indelible imprint on Kannada literature starting in the 15th century, inspiring a body of work called ''Haridasa Sahitya'' ("Haridasa literature"). Influenced by the Veerashaivism of the 12th century, this movement touched the lives of millions with its strong current of devotion. The Haridasas conveyed the message of Vedantic philosopher [[Madhvacharya]] to the common man through simple Kannada language in the form of ''devaranamas'' and ''kirthanas'' (devotional songs in praise of god).&lt;ref name="devaranama"&gt;Sastri (1955), p. 365&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="devaranam1"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1987), p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; The philosophy of Madhvacharya was spread by eminent disciples including [[Naraharitirtha]], [[Jayatirtha]], [[Vyasatirtha]], [[Sripadaraya]], [[Vadirajatirtha]], [[Purandara Dasa]], and [[Kanaka Dasa]].&lt;ref name="yathi trayaru"&gt;Shiva Prakash (1997), pp. 192–200&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]], a prominent saint from distant [[Bengal]], visited the region in 1510, further stimulating the devotional movement.&lt;ref name="devaranama"/&gt;

Purandara Dasa (1484–1564), a wandering bard, is believed to have composed 475,000 songs in the Kannada and [[Sanskrit language]]s, though only about 1,000 songs are known today. Composed in various ''[[ragas]]'', and often ending with a salutation to the Hindu deity [[Vittala]], his compositions presented the essence of the ''[[Upanishads]]'' and the ''[[Puranas]]'' in simple yet expressive language. He also devised a system by which the common man could learn [[Carnatic music]], and codified the [[musical composition]] forms ''[[Swarajatis|svaravali]]s'', ''alankaras'' ("figure of speech") and ''[[geethams]]''. Owing to such contributions, Purandara Dasa earned the honorific ''Karnataka Sangeeta Pitamaha'' ("Father of Carnatic Music").&lt;ref name="alankara"&gt;Moorthy (2001), p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pita"&gt;Iyer (2006), p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pita1"&gt;Shiva Prakash (1997), pp. 196–197&lt;/ref&gt;

Kanaka Dasa (whose birth name was Thimmappa Nayaka, 1509–1609) of Kaginele (in modern [[Haveri district]]) was an [[ascetic]] and spiritual seeker who authored important writings such as ''[[Mohanatarangini]]'' ("River of Delight"), the story of the Hindu god Krishna in ''sangatya'' metre; ''Nrisimhastava'', a work dealing with glory of god [[Narasimha]]; ''Nalacharita'', the story of [[Nala]], noted for its narration; and ''Hari Bhaktisara'', a spontaneous writing on devotion in ''shatpadi'' metre. The latter writing, which deals with ''niti'' (morals), ''bhakti'' (devotion) and  ''vairagya'' (renunciation) has become popular as a standard book of learning for children.&lt;ref name="niti"&gt;Rice E.P. (1921), p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; Kanaka Dasa authored a unique allegorical poem titled  ''Ramadhanya Charitre'' ("Story of Rama's Chosen Grain"), which exalts [[Finger millet|ragi]] over [[rice]].&lt;ref name="devaranama" /&gt; Apart from these classics, about 240 songs written by the Kanaka Dasa are available today.&lt;ref name="Ayyappapanicker"&gt;Shiva Prakash (1997), pp. 198–200&lt;/ref&gt;

The Haridasa movement returned to prominence from the 17th through 19th centuries, producing as many as 300 poets in this genre; well-known among them are [[Vijaya Dasa]] (1682–1755), Gopala Dasa (1721–1769), [[Jagannatha Dasa]] (1728–1809), Mahipathi Dasa (1750), Helavanakatte Giriamma and others.&lt;ref name="devaranam1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pro10"&gt;Shiva Prakash (1997), pp. 200–201&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, the movement's devotional songs inspired a form of religious and [[didactic]] performing art of the Vaishnava people called the [[Harikatha]] ("Stories of Hari"). Similar developments were seen among the followers of the Veerashaiva faith who popularised the ''Shivakatha'' ("Stories of Shiva").&lt;ref name="harikatha"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1988), p. 1551&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mysore and Keladi period==
{{Main article|Mysore literature|Musicians of the Kingdom of Mysore}}
[[File:Chikkadevaraja.jpg|thumb|right|King Chikka Devaraja Wodeyar (1673–1704), writer and patron of Kannada literature]]
With the decline of the Vijayanagara Empire, the [[Kingdom of Mysore]] (ಮೈಸೂರು ಸಾಮ್ರಾಜ್ಯ) (1565–1947) and the kingdom of the [[Keladi Nayaka]]s (1565–1763) rose to power in the southern and western regions of modern Karnataka respectively. Production of literary texts covering various themes flourished in these courts.&lt;ref name="themes"&gt;Nagaraj (2003) p. 377&lt;/ref&gt; The Mysore court was adorned by eminent writers who authored encyclopaedias, epics, and religious commentaries, and composers and musicians. The Keladi court is better known for writings on Veerashaiva doctrine.&lt;ref name="doc"&gt;Nagaraj (2003), p. 378&lt;/ref&gt; The Mysore kings themselves were accomplished in the fine arts and made important contributions.&lt;ref name="kan1"&gt;Pranesh (2003), preface chapter p. i–iii&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lak"&gt;Kamath (2001), pp. 229–230&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sri"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1934), pp. 23–26&lt;/ref&gt; A unique and native form of poetic literature with dramatic representation called ''[[Yakshagana]]'' gained popularity in the 18th century.&lt;ref name="sri"/&gt;&lt;ref name="surya"&gt;Kamath (1980), p. 281&lt;/ref&gt;

''Geetha Gopala'', a well-known treatise on music, is ascribed to King [[Chikka Devaraja|Chikka Devaraja Wodeyar]] (1673–1704), the earliest composer of the dynasty, who went by the honorific ''Sahitya Vidyanikasha Prastharam'' ("Expert in literature").&lt;ref name="chikka"&gt;Pranesh (2003), p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by Jayadeva's  ''Geetha Govinda'' in Sanskrit, it was written in ''saptapadi'' metre. This is the first writing to propagate the Vaishnava faith in the Kannada language.&lt;ref name="sapta"&gt;Pranesh (2003), p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

Also writing in this period&lt;ref name="assign"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1934), p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="life"&gt;Prasad (1987), p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; was [[Sarvajna]] (''lit.'' "The all knowing")—a [[mendicant]] and drifter Veerashaiva poet who left a deep imprint on Kannada speaking region and its people.  His didactic ''Vachanas'', penned in the ''tripadi'' metre, constitute some of Kannada's most celebrated works.  With the exception of some early poems, his works focus on his spiritual quest as a drifter.&lt;ref name="quest"&gt;Prasad (1987), pp. 9–10&lt;/ref&gt;  The pithy ''Vachanas'' contain his observations on the art of living, the purpose of life and the ways of the world.&lt;ref name="hirekerur"&gt;Shiva Prakash (1997), p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; He was not patronised by royalty, nor did he write for fame; his main aim was to instruct people about morality.&lt;ref name="morals"&gt;Prasad (1987), pp. 5–6&lt;/ref&gt;

The writing of Brahmin author [[Lakshmisa]] (or Lakshmisha), a well-known story-teller and a dramatist, is dated to the mid-16th or late 17th century.&lt;ref name="kadur1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kadur"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1988), p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Jaimini Bharata'', his version of the epic Mahabharata written in ''shatpadi'' metre, is one of the most popular poems of the late medieval period.&lt;ref name="assign"/&gt;  A collection of stories, the poem includes the tale of the ''Sita Parityaga'' ("Repudiation of Sita"). The author successfully converted a religious story into a very human tale; it remains popular even in modern times.&lt;ref name="valmiki"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1988), p. 1182&lt;/ref&gt;

The period also saw advances in dramatic works.  Though there is evidence that theatre was known from the 12th century or earlier, modern Kannada theatre is traced to the rise of ''Yakshagana'' (a type of field play), which appeared in the 16th century.&lt;ref name="amateur"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1988), p. 1077&lt;/ref&gt;  The golden age of ''Yakshagana'' compositions was tied to the rule of [[Narasaraja Wodeyar II|King Kanteerava Narasaraja Wodeyar II]] (1704–1714). A polyglot, he authored 14 ''Yakshaganas'' in various languages, although all are written in the Kannada script.&lt;ref name="wod"&gt;Pranesh (2003), p. 37–38&lt;/ref&gt; He is credited with the earliest ''Yakshaganas'' that included ''sangeeta'' (music), ''nataka'' (drama) and ''natya'' (dance).&lt;ref name="kan5"&gt;Pranesh (2003), p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mummadi Krishnaraja Wodeyar]] (1794–1868), the ruler of the [[princely state]] of [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore]], was another prolific writer of the era.&lt;ref name="bhoja"&gt;Pranesh (2003), p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; More than 40 writings are attributed to him, including a poetic romance called ''Saugandika Parinaya'' written in two versions, ''sangatya'' and a drama.&lt;ref name="sou"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1934), p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; His reign signalled the shift from classical genres to modern literature which was to be complemented by the influence of colonial period of India.

==Modern period==
{{Main article|Modern Kannada literature}}
[[Image:jcrw1.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Maharaja and writer, [[Jayachamaraja Wodeyar Bahadur]] (1940–1947) with Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]]]]
The development of modern Kannada literature can be traced to the early 19th century when Maharaja Krishnaraja Wodeyar III and his court poets moved away from the ancient ''champu'' form of prose toward prose renderings of Sanskrit epics and plays. Kempu Narayana's ''Mudramanjusha'' ("Seal Casket", 1823) is the first modern novel written in Kannada.

Modern Kannada literature was cross-fertilized by the colonial period in India as well.,&lt;ref name="mudra"&gt;Murthy in George K.M(1992), p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dic"/&gt; with translations of Kannada works and dictionaries into European languages as well as other Indian languages, and vice versa, and the establishment of European style newspapers and periodicals in Kannada. In addition, in the 19th century, interaction with European technology, including new printing techniques accelerated the development of modern literature.

The first Kannada newspaper  called ''Mangalore Samachara'' was published by [[Hermann Mögling]] in 1843; and the first Kannada periodical, ''Mysuru Vrittanta Bodhini'' was published by Bhashyam Bhashyacharya in Mysore around the same time. [[Hermann Mögling]] translated Kannada classics into a series called ''Bibliotheca Carnataca'' during 1848–1853.,&lt;ref name="mogl"&gt;Kamath (1980), p. 279&lt;/ref&gt; while British officers [[Benjamin L. Rice]] and J. H. Fleet edited and published critical editions of literary classics, contemporary folk ballads and inscriptions. Following the rich tradition of dictionaries in Kannada since the 11th century, the first dictionaries expressing meanings of Kannada words in European languages were published in the 19th century, the most prominent of them being [[Ferdinand Kittel]]'s Kannada-English dictionary in 1894.&lt;ref name="dic"&gt;Kamath (1980), p. 280&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a push towards original works in prose narratives and a standardisation of prose during the  late 19th century.&lt;ref name="durgesh"&gt;Murthy (1992), pp. 168–169&lt;/ref&gt; Translations of works from English, Sanskrit and other Indian languages like Marathi and Bengali continued and accelerated.  Lakshman Gadagkar's ''Suryakantha'' (1892) and Gulvadi Venkata Rao's ''[[Indira Bai]]'' (1899) signalled the move away from the highly stylised mores and aesthetics of prior Kannada works to modern prose, establishing the modern novel genre and fundamentally influencing the essay, literary criticism and drama genres.&lt;ref name="surya" /&gt;&lt;ref name="durgesh"/&gt;

At the dawn of the 20th century, [[B. M. Srikantaiah]] ('B. M. Sri'), regarded as the "Father of modern Kannada literature",&lt;ref name="greek"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1988), pp. 1077–78&lt;/ref&gt; called for a new era of writing original works in modern Kannada while moving away from archaic Kannada forms.  This paradigmatic shift spawned an age of prolificacy in Kannada literature and came to be dubbed the ''Navodaya'' (''lit''. 'A new rise') period—a period of awakening.  B. M. Sri led the way with his ''English Geethagalu'' ("English Songs")—a collection of poems translated from English set the tone for more translations using a standardisation of a modern written idiom.&lt;ref name="geeta"&gt;Murthy (1992), pp. 170–171&lt;/ref&gt;  Original and seminal works which drew greatly from native and folk traditions also emerged alongside the translations.  Stalwarts like S. G. Narasimhachar, Panje Mangesha Rao and Hattiangadi Narayana Rao also contributed with celebrated efforts.&lt;ref name="geeta"/&gt; Literary subjects now veered from discussing kings and gods to more humanistic and secular pursuits.  Kannada writers experimented with several forms of western literature, the novel and the short story in particular.  The novel found an early champion in [[Shivaram Karanth]] while another prominent writer, [[Masti Venkatesh Iyengar]] ('Masti'), laid the foundation for generations of story tellers to follow with his ''Kelavu Sanna Kathegalu'' ("A few Short Stories", 1920) and ''Sanna Kathegalu'' ("Short Stories", 1924).&lt;ref name="short"&gt;Murthy (1992), p. 172&lt;/ref&gt;

The consolidation of modern drama was pioneered  by [[T. P. Kailasam]], with his ''Tollu Gatti'' ("The Hollow and the Solid", 1918).  Kailasam followed this with ''Tali Kattoke Cooline'' ("Wages for tying the [[Mangalsutra]]"), a critique on the [[Dowry#In India|dowry]] system in marriage.&lt;ref name="geeta"/&gt; His plays mainly focused on problems affecting middle class [[Brahmin]] families: the dowry system, religious persecution, woes in the extended family system and exploitation of women.&lt;ref name="amateur"/&gt;  Novels of the early 20th century promoted a nationalist consciousness in keeping with the political developments of the time.  While  Venkatachar and Galaganath translated Bankim Chandra and Harinarayana Apte respectively, Gulvadi Venkata Rao, Kerur Vasudevachar and M. S. Puttanna initiated the movement toward realistic novels with their works.  Aluru Venkatarao's ''Karnataka Gatha Vaibhava'' had a profound influence on the movement for [[Unification of Karnataka|Karnataka's unification]].&lt;ref name="short"/&gt;

While the first quarter of the 20th century was a period of experiment and innovation, the succeeding quarter was one of creative achievement.  This period saw the rise of acclaimed [[lyricist]]s whose works combined native folk songs and the mystic poetry of the medieval ''vachanas'' and ''kirthanas''   with influences from modern English romantics.&lt;ref name="nara"&gt;Murthy (1992), p. 173–175&lt;/ref&gt;  [[D. R. Bendre]], with his collection of 27 poems including such masterpieces as ''Gari'' ("Wing", 1932), ''Nadaleele'' (1938) and ''Sakhigeetha'' (1940), was perhaps the most outstanding Kannada lyricist of the period.&lt;ref name="lyrical"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1987), p. 413&lt;/ref&gt; His poems covered a wide range of themes including patriotism, love of nature, conjugal love, transcendental experiences and sympathy for the poor.&lt;ref name="geeta1"&gt;Murthy (1992), p. 173&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Govinda Pai]] narrated the story of Christ's crucifixion in his work ''Golgotha'' (1931).  The success of this work encouraged Pai to follow with three [[panegyric]]s in 1947; ''Vaishakhi'', ''Prabhasa'' and ''Dehali'', narrated the last days of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], God [[Krishna]] and [[Gandhi]] respectively.&lt;ref name="vaisakhi"&gt;Das (1995), p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; His ''Hebberalu'' ("Thumb", 1946) dramatises the story of [[Drona]] and [[Ekalavya]], characters from the epic Mahabharata.&lt;ref name="bliss"/&gt;

K.V. Puttappa ('[[Kuvempu]]'), who would subsequently become Kannada's first [[Jnanpith]] awardee, demonstrated great talent in writing blank verse with his ''magnum opus'' ''[[Sri Ramayana Darshanam]]'' (1949).&lt;ref name="kattu"&gt;Murthy (1992), p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;  This work marks the beginning of modern Kannada [[epic poetry]].&lt;ref name="valmiki"/&gt; The work, through the use of metaphors and similes, focuses on the concept that all living creatures will eventually evolve into perfect beings.&lt;ref name="worthy"&gt;Punekar in Sahity Akademi (1992), pp. 4159–4160&lt;/ref&gt;  Other important works of the period are Masti's ''Navaratri'' and P. T. Narasimhachar's ''Hanathe''.  [[D. V. Gundappa]]'s ''[[Mankuthimmana Kagga]]'' ("Dull Thimma's Rigmarole", 1943) harkened back to the wisdom poems of the late medieval poet Sarvajna.&lt;ref name="gund"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1988), p. 1057&lt;/ref&gt;  A celebrated writer of conjugal love poems, [[K. S. Narasimhaswamy]] won critical acclaim for ''Mysore Mallige'' ("Mysore Jasmine", 1942), a description of the bliss of everyday marital life.&lt;ref name="bliss"&gt;Murthy (1992), p. 175&lt;/ref&gt;

Growth in poetic drama was inspired  by B.M. Sri's ''Gadayuddha Natakam'' (1925), an adaptation of Ranna's medieval epic. While Kuvempu and B.M. Sri were inspired by old Kannada, Masti and later P. T. Narasimhachar ('Pu. Ti. Na') explored modern sensibilities in their ''Yashodhara'' (1938) and ''Ahalye'' (1940). The 1930s saw the emergence of Sriranga, who joined forces with Samsa and Kailasam to pen some of the most successful plays in Kannada.&lt;ref name="unbridle"&gt;Murthy (1992), p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; Samsa completed his trilogy about Ranadhira Kantirava, a Mysore king of yore, with his ''Vijayanarasimha'' (1936) and ''Mantrashakti'' (1938). Kailasam's mastery over wit and stage rhetoric come to the fore in his ''Home Rule'' (1930) and ''Vaidyana Vyadi'' ("A Doctors Ailment", 1940) while he explores his serious side in ''Bhahishkara'' (1929); with ''Soole'' ("Prostitute", 1945), he unleashed his contempt for outdated quasi-religious mores.&lt;ref name="unbridle" /&gt; Societal ills were also examined in Bendre's ''Nageya Hoge'' ("Fumes of Laughter", 1936), and in Karanth's ''Garbhagudi'' ("Sanctum", 1932), which decried the exploitation of society in the name of religion.&lt;ref name="concern"&gt;Murthy (1992), p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;

The novel came of age during this period, with Karanth (''Chomana Dudi'', 1933), Masti (''Subbanna'', 1928) and Kuvempu ("Subbamma Heggadathi of Kanur", 1936) leading the charge.&lt;ref name="kanur"&gt;Murthy (1992), p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;  Significantly, writers chose to carry on from where Puttanna, Gulvadi and Kerur had left off around the start of the 20th century rather than continue with popular translations in the style of Venkatachar and Galaganath.  Aesthetic concerns replaced the didactic and a sense of form developed.&lt;ref name="concern" /&gt; [[Devudu Narasimha Shastri]] distinguished himself with his ''Antaranga'' (1931) and '' Mayura'' (1928); the former was a much acclaimed work which delved into the psychology of the protagonist, while the latter was a historical novel tracing the emergence of the [[Kadamba dynasty]].  Another high point of this period is Karanth's ''Marali Mannige'' (1942), the saga of three generations of a family, reflecting the social, cultural and economic developments of over a hundred years.&lt;ref name="marali"&gt;Murthy (1992), p. 178–179&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Literary criticism]], which had its beginnings in the first quarter-century, also made significant progress.  B.M. Sri's ''Kannada Sahitya Charitre'' (1947), Gundappa's ''Sahitya Shakti'' (1950), Masti's ''Adikavi Valmiki'' (1935), Bendre's ''Sahitya Hagu Vimarshe'' ("Literature and Criticism", 1932) and Krishna Shastry's ''Samskrita Nataka'' (1937) are particularly notable.  The essay, another form adopted from western literature, was richly served by A N Murthy Rao (''Hagaluganasugalu'', 1937), Gorur Ramaswamy Iyengar's ('Gorur') humorous ''Halliya Chitragalu'' (1930) and Karanth's ''Hucchu manassina Hattu mukhagalu'' (1948).&lt;ref name="halli"&gt;Murthy (1992), p. 179&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late Navodaya and the rise of the progressives===
As the ''Navodaya'' period waxed, the ''[[Pragatishila]]'' (progressives) movement led by novelist [[A. N. Krishna Rao]] ('Anakru') gained momentum in the early 1940s.&lt;ref name="katti"&gt;Murthy (1992), p. 183&lt;/ref&gt;  This left-leaning school contended that literature must be an instrument of social revolution and considered the ''Navodaya'' to be the product of aesthetes, too puritanical to be of any social relevance.  This movement drew both established and young writers into its fold and, while it produced no poetry or drama of special merit, its contributions to short story and novel forms were appreciable.  ''Pragatishila'' was credited with broadening readers' horizons; works produced during this period dealt extensively with subjects of everyday life, rural themes and the common man.  The language was less inhibited and made generous use of colloquialism and slang.  Anakru himself was a prolific writer of novels but the best works of this school are attributed to [[T. R. Subba Rao]] ('Ta Ra Su'), Basavaraju Kattimani and Niranjana.&lt;ref&gt;The Growth of the Novel in India 1950–1980, P. K. Rajan, p. 112, 1989, {{ISBN|81-7017-259-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  T. R. Subba Rao initially wrote short stories, although he later turned his talents to novels, which were popular. His early novels, ''Purushavatara'' and ''Munjavininda Munjavu'', told the stories of the underprivileged, the downtrodden and the outcast.&lt;ref name="hoovu"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1992), p. 4185&lt;/ref&gt; Best known among his novels—some of whose plots are centred on his native [[Chitradurga]]—are ''Masanada Hoovu'' ("Flower from a cemetery"), a story about the plight of prostitutes, and historical novel  ''Hamsa Gite'' ("Swan Song"), a story about a dedicated musician of the late 18th century during annexation of Chitradurga by [[Tipu sultan]].&lt;ref name="katti"/&gt;

Marked as its influence had been, the ''Pragatishila'' wave was already in decline by the close of the 1950s.  Legendary writers of the previous era continued to produce notable works in the ''Navodaya'' style. In poetry, Bendre's ''Naku Tanti'' ("Four Strings", 1964) and Kuvempu's ''Aniketana'' (1964) stand out. V.K. Gokak brought out the innate insufficiencies of the more advanced western cultures in ''Indilla Nale'' (1965).&lt;ref name="shoka"&gt;Murthy (1992), pp. 179–180&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Navodaya''-style novels continued to be successful with such noteworthy works as Karanth's ''Mookajjiya Kanasugalu'' ("Mookajji's visions", 1968), where Karanth explored the origins of man's faith in the mother goddess and the stages of evolution of civilisation. Kuvempu's ''Malegallali Madumagalu'' ("The Bride of the Hills", 1967) is about loving relationships that exist in every level of society.&lt;ref name="august"&gt;Murthy (1992), p. 180&lt;/ref&gt;

Masti's two classic novels of this era were ''Channabasavanayaka'' (1950), which describe the defeat of Bidanur's chief Channabasava Nayaka (on Karnataka's coast) by [[Hyder Ali|Haider Ali]] in the late 18th century, and ''Chickavirarajendra'' (1950), which describes the fall of the tiny kingdom of [[Coorg]] (ruled by [[Chikka Virarajendra]]) to  the [[British East India Company]].&lt;ref name="anasuya1"&gt;Murthy (1992) p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; The common theme in both works is the despotism and tyranny of the incumbent native rulers resulting in the intervention of a foreign power appearing on the scene to restore order, but with its own imperialistic intentions.&lt;ref name="vira"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1987), p. 689&lt;/ref&gt;

[[S. L. Bhyrappa]], a charismatic young writer, first came to attention in the 1960s with his first novel ''Dharmasri'', although it was his ''Vamsavriksha'' ("Family Tree", 1966) that put him in the spotlight as one of Kannada's most popular novelists. It is a story of a respected scholar, Srinivasa Srotri, his family and their long-held values. The protagonist's young and widowed daughter-in-law wishes to remarry, putting his family tradition at risk.&lt;ref name="bhy"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1987), p. 429&lt;/ref&gt; Bhyrappa's best novel of the period was ''Grihabhanga'' ("Breaking of a Home", 1970), a story of a woman surviving under tragic circumstances. The characters in the story are rustic and often use vulgar language.&lt;ref name="bhanga"&gt;Murthy (1992), p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; His other important novel is ''[[Parva (novel)|Parva]]'', a major work in Kannada fiction acclaimed as an admirable attempt at recreating life on the sub-continent during the time of the epic Mahabharata.&lt;ref name="fic"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1987), p. 430&lt;/ref&gt;

===Navya===
[[Image:Stalwarts.jpg|right |thumb |upright |Seated L to R: [[Masti Venkatesh Iyengar]], [[D. V. Gundappa]], [[Kuvempu]], [[M. V. Seetharamiah]], [[K. Shivaram Karanth]], [[A.N. Krishna Rao]] (Anakru) and [[G.P. Rajarathnam]]]]
In the 1950s, even as the ''Pragatishila'' merged back into the ''Navodaya'' mainstream, a new modernist school of writing called ''Navya'' emerged.  Though formally inaugurated by [[V. K. Gokak]] with his ''Navya Kavitegalu'' ("Modern Poems", 1950), it was [[Gopalakrishna Adiga]] who best exemplified the ethos of the movement.  Poetry and, later, the short story became the most effective vehicles of the movement. With the passing of the Gandhian era and its influences, a new era in which to express modern sensibilities had arrived.  The ''Navya'' writers questioned the time-honoured standards of plot of the ''Navodaya''; life was seen not as a pursuit of already existing values, but as an introspective search for them, occasionally narrated in stream of consciousness technique.  Events and details were increasingly treated metaphorically and the short story grew closer to poetry.&lt;ref name="Sahitya Akademi 1992, p. 4049"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1992), p. 4049&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Handbook of Twentieth-Century Literatures of India, Nalini Natarajan, Emmanuel Sampath Nelson, p. 170, 1996, {{ISBN|0-313-28778-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gopalakrishna Adiga is considered the father of this form of expression with his ''Nadedu Banda Dari'' ("The Path Traversed", 1952) where he sought inspiration from [[T. S. Eliot]] and [[W. H. Auden]]. His other well-known poems include ''Gondalapura'' ("Pandemonium", 1954) and ''Bhoota'' (1959).&lt;ref name="bhoota"&gt;Murthy (1992), p. 184&lt;/ref&gt;

[[G. S. Shivarudrappa]] made his mark in the Navya period with ''Mumbai Jataka'' ("A Horoscope of Bombay", 1966), which takes a closer look at urbanised society in [[Mumbai]].&lt;ref name="ahmed"/&gt; A protégé of Kuvempu, Shivarudrappa's fame came the peak of popularity of romantic poems with his ''Samagma'' ("Songs of Equanimity", 1951), poems distinguished by an idealistic bent. He continued to write poems in the same vein, &lt;!--   ''Cheluvu Olavu'' ("Beauty and Truth", 1953) and ''Devashilpa'' ("Divine Sculpture", 1959), commenting out, info not needed, is in child article--&gt; although in his later poems there is a gradual shift to social issues with a streak of admiration for god's creation.&lt;ref name="creation"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1992), p. 4031&lt;/ref&gt; His critical essay, ''Anuranana'' (1980), is about the Vachana poets of the 12th century, their tradition, style and influence on later poets.&lt;ref name="creation"/&gt;

K. S. Narasimhaswamy remained prominent through this era, writing such landmark poems as ''Silalate'' ("The Sculptured Creeper", 1958)&lt;!--  , ''Tereda Bagilu'' ("The Open Door", 1972), ''Malligeya Male'' ("Jasmine Garland", 1986), ''Idadiru Nanna Ninna Simhasanada Mele'' ("Place me not on your Throne") commenting out to thin list, other poems are in child article on author--&gt; and ''Gadiyaradangadiya Munde'' ("Before the Clock Shop").&lt;ref name="male"&gt;Murthy (1992), p. 665&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chandrashekhara Kambar]], Chandrashekar Patil, [[P. Lankesh]], and [[K. S. Nissar Ahmed]] are among the best-known later generation Navya poets.&lt;ref name="ahmed"&gt;Murthy (1992), p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;

Outstanding playwrights from this period are [[Girish Karnad]], [[P. Lankesh]], Chandrashekhara Kambara and Chandrashekar Patil. Karnad's ''Tughlaq'' (1964) portrays violence caused by idealism gone astray.&lt;ref name="ahmed"/&gt; Considered an important creation in Kannada theatre, the play depicts the 14th-century [[Sultan]] of [[Delhi]], [[Mohammad Tughlaq]] in contrasting styles, a tyrannical and whimsical ruler and at the same time, an idealist who sought the best for his subjects.&lt;ref name="tug"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1992), p. 4403&lt;/ref&gt;  Most plays written by Karnad have either history or mythology as their theme, with a focus on their relevance to modern society.

The most acclaimed novel of the era was ''Samaskara'' by [[U.R.Anantha Murthy]] (1965).  The novel details the search for new values and identity by the protagonist, a Brahmin, who had sexual intercourse with the untouchable mistress of his [[Heresy|heretic]] adversary.&lt;ref name="heretic"&gt;Murthy (1992), p. 187&lt;/ref&gt; Another notable work is the ''Swarupa'' (1966) by [[Poornachandra Tejaswi]]. Anantha Murthy's ''Prasne'' (1963) contains his best collection of short stories including ''Ghatashraddha'', which describes the tragedy that befell a young pregnant widow, from the point of view of a boy. His collection ''Mouni'' (1973) includes the stories ''Navilugulu'' ("Peacocks") and ''Clip Joint''.&lt;ref name="dari"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1987), p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;

The Navya movement was not without its critics.  The doubt, dilemmas and indecision in every turn of the plot resulted in increasingly sophisticated and complex narrations, which some readers found uninteresting.  It was derided as an intellectual exercise of the middle class intelligentsia; in its extreme sophistication, it was thought to have lost its touch with realities of life.  This led to a gradual waning of the Navya school as it was supplanted by emerging waves of ''Navyottara'', ''Bandaya'' (protest) and ''[[Dalit]]'' schools.&lt;ref name="Sahitya Akademi 1992, p. 4049"/&gt;

==Post-modern trends==
From the early 1970s, a segment of writers including many "Navya" writers started to write novels and stories that were anti-"Navya". This genre was called ''Navyottara'' and sought to fulfil a more socially responsible role.&lt;ref name="rahasya"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1992), p 4308&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="farmer"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1992), p 4309&lt;/ref&gt; The best-known authors in this form of writing were [[Poornachandra Tejaswi]] and [[Devanur Mahadeva]]. In his preface to Abachurina Post Office, Tejaswi expressed a path breaking observation towards then prevailing literary movements. Tejaswi won the "most creative novel of the year" for his ''[[Karvalo]]'' in 1980 and ''Chidambara Rahasya'' in 1985 from the Sahitya Akademi.&lt;ref name="rahasya"/&gt;&lt;ref name="farmer"/&gt;

Modernisation and westernisation continue to inform sensibilities and spawn new literary techniques and genres.&lt;ref name="dalit"&gt;Murthy (1992), p 189&lt;/ref&gt; The most striking developments in recent times have been the rise of the prose form to a position of predominance — a position earlier held by poetry — and the prodigious growth in dramatic literature.&lt;ref name="dalit"/&gt; More recently ''Bandaya'' (Rebellion) and [[Dalit literature]], in some ways a throwback to the ''Pragatishila'' ([[Progressivism]]) days, have come to the fore.  Mahadeva's ''Marikondavaru'' ("Those who sold themselves") and ''Mudala Seemeli Kole Gile Ityadi'' ("Murder in the Eastern Region") are examples of this trend.&lt;ref name="dalit"/&gt;

Kannada writers have been presented with 8 [[Jnanpith|Jnanpith awards]], 60 [[List of Sahitya Akademi Award winners for Kannada|Sahitya Akademi awards]] and 9 [[List of Sahitya Akademi fellows|Sahitya Akademi Fellowship]]s in India, and numerous other national and international awards since India's independence.&lt;ref name="jnanpith"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jnanpith.net/laureates/index.html |title=Awardees detail for the Jnanpith Award |work=Official website of Bharatiya Jnanpith |publisher=Bharatiya Jnanpith |accessdate=2008-02-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013122739/http://jnanpith.net/laureates/index.html |archivedate=2007-10-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sahitya"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iconofindia.com/sahitya-akademi/awa10307.htm#kannada |author= |title=Sahitya Akademi–India's National Akademi of Letters |work=Awards and fellowships |accessdate=2008-11-06 |publisher=Sahitya Akademi |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216143254/http://www.iconofindia.com/sahitya-akademi/awa10307.htm |archivedate=2008-12-16 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kuliak languages''', also called the '''Rub''' languages,&lt;ref name=Ehret&gt;Ehret, Christopher (2001) ''A Historical-Comparative Reconstruction of Nilo-Saharan'' (SUGIA, Sprache und Geschichte in Afrika: Beihefte; 12), Cologne: Rüdiger Köppe Verlag, {{ISBN|3896450980}}.&lt;/ref&gt; are a group of languages spoken by small [[relict]] communities in the mountains of northeastern [[Uganda]]. Bender (1989) had classified them within the [[Eastern Sudanic languages]], but by Bender (2000) he had separated them out as a peripheral isolate within [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]]. Significant influence from [[Cushitic languages]], and more recently [[Nilotic languages]], is observable in the vocabulary and phonology. [[Bernd Heine]] proposed a reconstruction of Proto-Kuliak. Soo and Nyang'i form a subgroup, Western Kuliak, against Ik. Blench notes that Kuliak appears to retain a core of non-Nilo-Saharan vocabulary, suggesting [[language shift]] from an indigenous language like that seen in [[Dahalo language|Dahalo]].

Nyang'i is close to [[Language death|extinct]] (there is one remaining speaker with reasonable fluency), and Soo is [[endangered language|moribund]]. However, [[Ik language|Ik]] is vigorous, and growing.

'''Language disorders''' or '''language impairments''' are disorders that involve the processing of linguistic information.  Problems that may be experienced can involve [[grammar]] ([[syntax]] and/or [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]),  [[semantics]] (meaning), or other aspects of language.  These problems may be receptive (involving impaired language comprehension), expressive (involving language production), or a combination of both.  Examples include [[specific language impairment]] and [[aphasia]], among others.  Language disorders can affect both spoken and written language,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Katusic|first=Slavica K.|last2=Colligan|first2=Robert C.|last3=Weaver|first3=Amy L.|last4=Barbaresi|first4=William J.|date=2009-05-01|title=The Forgotten Learning Disability: Epidemiology of Written-Language Disorder in a Population-Based Birth Cohort (1976–1982), Rochester, Minnesota|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/123/5/1306|journal=Pediatrics|language=en|volume=123|issue=5|pages=1306–1313|doi=10.1542/peds.2008-2098|issn=0031-4005|pmc=2923476|pmid=19403496|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170509063357/http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/123/5/1306|archivedate=2017-05-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can also affect [[sign language]]; typically, all forms of language will be impaired.

Current data indicates that 7% of young children display language disorder,&lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, J., &amp; Brownlie, E. B. (2014). Language disorders in children and adolescents. Cambridge, MA: Hogrefe &amp; Huber.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heim, S., &amp; Benasich, A. A. (2006). Developmental disorders of language. In D. Cicchetti &amp; D. J. Cohen (Eds.), Developmental psychopathology, Vol. 3. Risk, disorder, and adaptation (2nd ed., pp. 268–316). Hoboken, NJ: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; with boys being diagnosed twice as much as girls.&lt;ref&gt;Pinborough-Zimmerman, J., Satterfield, R., Miller, J., Bilder, D., Hossain, S., &amp; McMahon, W. (2007). Communication disorders: Prevalence and comorbid intellectual disability, autism, and emotional/ behavioral disorders. American Journal of Speech-Language Pathology, 16, 359–367.&lt;/ref&gt;

Preliminary research on potential risk factors have suggested biological components, such as [[low birth weight]], [[premature birth|prematurity]], general birth complications, and male gender, as well as family history and low parental education can increase the chance of developing language disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wallace|first=Ina F.|last2=Berkman|first2=Nancy D.|last3=Watson|first3=Linda R.|last4=Coyne-Beasley|first4=Tamera|last5=Wood|first5=Charles T.|last6=Cullen|first6=Katherine|last7=Lohr|first7=Kathleen N.|date=2015-08-01|title=Screening for Speech and Language Delay in Children 5 Years Old and Younger: A Systematic Review|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/136/2/e448|journal=Pediatrics|language=en|volume=136|issue=2|pages=e448–e462|doi=10.1542/peds.2014-3889|issn=0031-4005|pmid=26152671|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310135953/http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/136/2/e448|archivedate=2016-03-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For children with phonological and expressive language difficulties, there is evidence supporting [[speech and language therapy]]. However, the same therapy is shown to be much less effective for receptive language difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004110/abstract|title=Speech and language therapy interventions for children with primary speech and language delay or disorder|last=Law|first=James|last2=Garrett|first2=Zoe|last3=Nye|first3=Chad|date=2003-07-21|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd|language=en|doi=10.1002/14651858.cd004110}}&lt;/ref&gt; These results are consistent with the poorer prognosis for receptive language impairments that are generally accompanied with problems in reading comprehension.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://dsm.psychiatryonline.org/doi/abs/10.1176/appi.books.9780890425596.dsm01|title=Neurodevelopmental Disorders|date=2013-05-22|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|isbn=0890425558|series=DSM Library|doi=10.1176/appi.books.9780890425596.dsm01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that these are distinct from [[speech disorders]], which involve difficulty with the act of speech production, but not with language.

Language disorders tend to manifest in two different ways: receptive language disorders (where one cannot properly comprehend language) and expressive language disorders (where one cannot properly communicate their intended message).

== Receptive language disorders ==
Receptive language disorders can be acquired or developmental (most often the latter). When developmental, difficulties in spoken language tend to occur before three years of age. Usually such disorders are accompanied by expressive language disorders.&lt;ref&gt;Victoria State Govt. "Receptive language disorder." ''Better Health Channel'', 2016, {{cite web |url=http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/receptive-language-disorder |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-06-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170712035107/https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/receptive-language-disorder |archivedate=2017-07-12 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, unique symptoms and signs of a receptive language disorder include: struggling to understand meanings of words and sentences, struggling to put words in proper order, and inability to follow verbal instruction.&lt;ref&gt;The Understood Team. "Understanding Language Disorders." Edited by Bob Cunningham. ''Understood: for learning &amp; attention issues'', 2014, {{cite web |url=http://www.understood.org/en/learning-attention-issues/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-06-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170703051718/https://www.understood.org/en/learning-attention-issues |archivedate=2017-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Treatment options include: language therapy, [[special education]] classes for children at school, and a psychologist if accompanying behavioral problems are present. 
== Expressive language disorders ==
Unlike those with a speech disorder, the problem with expressive language disorders pertains not only to the voice and articulation, but to the mental formation of language, itself.

Expressive language disorders can occur during a child's development or they can be acquired. This acquisition usually follows a normal neurological development and is brought about by a number of causes such as head trauma or irradiation.&lt;ref&gt;Bressert, S. (2016). Expressive Language Disorder Symptoms. ''Psych Central''. Retrieved on May 1, 2017, from {{cite web |url=https://psychcentral.com/disorders/expressive-language-disorder-symptoms/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-05-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170119065752/http://psychcentral.com/disorders/expressive-language-disorder-symptoms/ |archivedate=2017-01-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}}

Features of an expressive language disorder vary, but have certain features in common such as: limited vocabulary, inability to produce complex grammar, and more lexical errors.

If it is a developmental disorder, the child will have difficulty acquiring new words and grammatical structures. The child will often begin speaking later than his/her peers and progress at a slower rate linguistically. Due to the very nature of these disorders, the child may struggle with academics and socializing with peers.&lt;ref&gt;''ASHA''. American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, psychcentral.com/disorders/expressive-language-disorder-symptoms/.&lt;/ref&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}}

Experts that commonly treat such disorders include speech pathologists and audiologists.

== Psychopathology of language ==
A special class of language disorders is studied by the psychopathology of language. Its topics of interest range from simple [[speech error]] to [[dream speech]] and [[schizophasia]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2468">The ancient rock art site of Lengo is located in the [[Bakouma]] region of the [[Central African Republic]].

== Site Description ==
The village of Lengo is on the road of Yalinga 3&amp;nbsp;km from Bakouma. The site of engravings is located on the right of this road, in 1&amp;nbsp;km east of the village. It occupies a huge [[laterite]] slab, more than 200 m long covered by a layer of topsoil brought by erosion and decomposition of vegetation.  They number more than 500 pictorials.

Engravings become divided into three groups: 
* Animals
* Weapons
* Various other signs.

A census revealed the following drawing types and abundances:
Animals:
* Eight antelopes, the nicest measure 1.50 m of long; very close to its back are engraved a spear and two throwing knives; two others are of lesser quality.
* Feline, two with round heads and raised long tail.
* Five very stylized and badly preserved animals, impossible to identify.
* Two birds of good size, perhaps bustards in mating positions.

Human playing bit parts:
A figure having moved aside legs, massive and short trunk on which arms are pointed out by two traits; it has a very small head of bird which, according to information acquired on place would be a ritual mask. The outlines of this silhouette are given by a polished, broad but rather shallow trait.

Weapon and various objects:
The presentations of weapons are the most numerous:
* Sixteen spears with very long shafts.
* An arrow with a short shaft.
* Four twenty-one throwing knives where they can identify thirty different types. Some people are very simple, right and bent back, others contrariwise in the numerous branches show an ornamental or ritual research and carry curls, hooks and notches. They are for the majority more complex. 
* A calabash provided with a rope forming a curl. The inside of the drawings is finely staked out, the well marked neck and outlines were carried out by a carefully polished trait. This domestic object serves even in the region of Bakouma for the transport and the conservation of water at present in small quantity.

{{nihongo|'''''Little Pollon'''''|おちゃめ神物語コロコロポロン|Ochamegami Monogatari Korokoro Polon|lit. '''''The Story of Little Goddess Roly-Poly Pollon'''''|lead=yes}} is a musical [[Greek mythology]]-based [[Japan]]ese [[anime]] television series, based on the 1977 [[manga]] ''[[Olympus no Pollon]]'' (''Pollon of Olympus'') by [[Hideo Azuma]]. The anime television series consisted of 46 episodes and aired across Japan on [[Fuji TV]] from May 1982 to March 1983, and was also popular in some [[Europe]]an countries. The series is noted for its faithful portrayal of the Gods of [[Mount Olympus]] as fallible beings succumbing to real human faults and weaknesses, such as selfishness, temper tantrums, debauchery, laziness, and vanity.

==Story==
The main character of the story is Pollon, a sweet, precocious little girl who is the daughter of the God of the Sun, [[Apollo]].
Pollon's goal in life is to grow up to become a beautiful and powerful goddess. She attempts to do good deeds and help out any way she can in order to achieve the status of godhood. Invariably, her overtures backfire and end up causing major trouble for both the gods of Olympus and their human subjects. However, Pollon's kind heart, perseverance and indomitable spirit win out in the end, as she attains the title of "Goddess of Hope."

==Characters==
* '''Pollon''' (voice: [[Masako Miura]]) - The daughter of Apollo, the sun-god, she is a kind-hearted but somewhat naive girl who wants to be a goddess when she grows up. However, her attempts to prove herself worthy of the title of goddess usually result in disasters of comic proportions.
* '''[[Eros]]''' (voice: [[Keiko Yamamoto]]) - The God of Love, and Pollon's cousin and best friend. He shoots heart-tipped arrows at people to make them fall in love, but as he is quite an ugly creature, he ironically has no girlfriend of his own.
* '''[[Apollo]]''' (voice: [[Akio Nojima]]) - Pollon's father, the God of the Sun. He is a lazy drunk who is somewhat neglectful of his daughter. His main job is to drive the Sun's chariot across the sky each day, but as he is often too lazy and/or drunk to do so, Pollon often ends up driving the chariot herself.
* '''[[Zeus]]''' (voice: [[Masashi Amenomori]])  - The king of the gods, father of Apollo and grandfather of Pollon. Despite his advanced age, he has a strong attraction to younger women, which often gets him in trouble with his wife, Hera.
* '''[[Hera]]''' (voice: [[Eiko Yamada]]) - The queen of the gods, mother of Apollo and grandmother of Pollon. She is portrayed as the stereotypical hen-pecking wife, somewhat neurotic and given to temper tantrums, and often responds violently to her husband Zeus' flirtatious ways.
* '''[[Artemis]]''' (voice: [[Rumiko Ukai]]) - The Goddess of the Moon, one of Pollon's aunts.
* '''[[Aphrodite]]''' (voice: [[Yoko Kawanami]]) - The Goddess of Beauty, and another of Pollon's aunts. She is also the mother of Eros. Aphrodite is very beautiful and very vain, and spends hours admiring herself in the mirror. She's ashamed of her unattractive son and frequently disowns him.
* '''[[Poseidon]]''' (voice: [[Banjou Ginga]]) - The God of the Sea is very tall in stature, towering way over the other gods. Although he is the god of the sea, he ironically can't swim.
* '''[[Atlas]]''' - Atlas is the Titan who holds the weight of the sky. It is shown that he is ticklish.
* '''[[Hephaestus]]''' (voice: [[Kenichi Ogata (voice actor)|Kenichi Ogata]]) - God of smithing and Aphrodite's husband, he's an amiable, if bumbling, inventor. He however dislikes most of the other male gods, especially Apollo, because they're more handsome than him.
* '''[[Athena]]''' (voice: [[Kachiko Hino]]) - The armor-clad goddess of wisdom and war. One of the most serious and wise characters in the cast. Nonetheless, others dislike her prickly attitude.
* '''[[Dionysus]]''' (voice: [[Masaharu Sato]]) - God of wine and merrymaking, he's a bald, stout man with dark glasses. He's never seen without a bottle in his hand. The other gods very much enjoy his company (and the wine he brews).
* '''[[Hades]]''' (voice: [[Naoki Tatsuta]]) - God of the underworld, he reigns unopposed over his realm with his wife Persephone. They enjoy inflicting the most absurd punishments and tortures on the damned.
* '''Cha Cha Cha''' - A somewhat modern-looking scientist. Bumbling and foolish, he genuinely believes himself the ''sanest person in this crazy world of fools''. He tries to help Pollon by providing her with concoctions and potions that, according to him, could potentially solve every trouble Pollon meets in her adventures, but they always fail to provide the intended effect. He also provides Pollon with a powder able to induce happiness and euforia.
* '''Dosankos''' (voice: Masaharu Sato) - Apollo's horse.
* '''The Sun''' - The long-suffering Sun is often ripped, torn or otherwise disturbed by Pollon and/or the other gods. He has become a heavy smoker to deal with the stress in his life.
* '''Narrator''' - A cute little sprite who tells the story of Pollon and the gods as it unfolds.

==Overseas Distribution==
In addition to its success in Japan, ''Little Pollon'' was a very successful television program in [[Italy]] during the mid-1980s, where it was known as ''C'era una volta... Pollon'' (''Once upon a time there was... Pollon'') and featured an Italian theme song by [[Cristina D'Avena]]. Many of the Pollon fan sites on the Internet are in Italian, and there are regular reruns of the anime. Azuma's original manga has also been published in the Italian market in 2001. The series was also broadcast in France  on La Cinq in the late 1980s under the title ''La Petite Olympe et les Dieux'', with Pollon's name changed to "Olympe". In [[Spain]], the series was broadcast with the name "La Pequeña Polon" (The Little Polon), in the region of [[Catalonia]], it was known as ''La Petita Polon'' and it was also distributed on VHS in Spanish. Only 24 episodes of the 46 were dubbed in Spanish and Catalan.
[[Enoki Films]] USA holds the U.S. license to the anime series, although no [[English language|English]] dub or subtitling of the series has ever been commercially released.

The ''Little Pollon'' production team followed up the series in 1983 with another anime based on a Hideo Azuma manga, ''[[Nanako SOS]]'' (aka ''Nana the Supergirl''). In one scene in ''Nanako SOS'', the ''Little Pollon'' anime is being played on television.

'''Maradeka''' is an emerging pro-democracy Muslim political organization espousing non-violent political action&lt;ref&gt;Mahatma Gandhi, International Day of Non-Violence, Oct. 2, 2011 [[Nonviolence]]&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Philippines]] amidst the backdrop of over four decades of armed Muslim insurgency mounted by [[Moro National Liberation Front]] (MNLF)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/392594/Moro-National-Liberation-Front-MNLF= Moro National Liberation Front]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Moro Islamic Liberation Front]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/milf.htm= Moro Islamic Liberation Front]&lt;/ref&gt; (MILF) in their Moro Quest for self-rule after people dissenting  Philippine government treatment of Muslim minority as second class citizens and suffering years of social, economic, and political inequities called Mindanao problem&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mb.com.ph/node/196203= Mindanao problem]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maradeka''' is  rooted from [[Malay language|Malay]] word '''[[merdeka]]'''&lt;ref&gt;Malay word, "merdeka"[[Merdeka]] used widely in South East Asia&lt;/ref&gt; etymologically means ''freedom'' or ''liberation'' In reinvigorating the spirit and inherent values of freedom from Malay forebears, the word Maradeka was adopted as the name of the umbrella freedom alliance of 72 [[Bangsamoro (political entity)|Bangsamoro]] civil society and political organizations, groups such as Task Force Mindanao, Alternative Muslim Mindanao Entrepreneurial Dev't, Inc (AMMENDI), Basilan Solidarity, Organization of Maguindanaon and Iranon, Bangsamoro Consultative Assembly, Bangsamoro Supreme Council of Ulama (BSCU), Maradeka Youth, Bangsa Iranun Muslim Advocates for Peace, Inc., Ittihadun As-Shabab Al-Muslimeen, Karitan Foundation Inc., Mindanao Peace Observers, Manila Peace Zone Community Association (MAPZCA), and Mindanao War Victims.

Maradeka, a Philippine [[civil society]] network and alliance of Moro organizations, pursues its social and political advocacy and development programs with its partners organizations and institutions. It build its organization's strength in grass-root community and citizens' action  and consensus building through its regional people assemblies (RPA) held in various regions widely in Mindanao and Sulu, and growing in the Central Luzon and Calabarzon area. Maradeka as ideological organization takes its main form of action in articulating voices of marginalized Moro people, democratic dialogues, participatory community consultations (shura), social and political advocacy campaigns, and launches mass actions to demonstrate its protests, appeal, and demands on various legitimate issues to influence policies affecting the Muslim people.

==Moro War for Secession from Philippines==
The Muslims in the Southern Philippines known as Moro or [[Moro people|Bangsamoro]] claimed to have preceded the Philippine Commonwealth when the United States Government granted in 1935 self-rule due to the demand for independence by Filipino politicians headed by Manuel L. Quezon. The Bangsamoro people have established their independent Sultanates, namely the [[Sultanate of Sulu]], [[Sultanate of Maguindanao]] and the [[Confederation of sultanates in Lanao|Pat A Pangampong of Ranaw]] (Federal States of Ranaw). These Moro Sultanates mounted a colonial resistance called [[Spanish–Moro Wars]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1574278/Moro-Wars  Moro Wars]&lt;/ref&gt; by Dr. Casar Adib Majul in his book History of the Muslims in the Philippines, against the incursion of Spanish Colonial power in 1571 and the annexation of the Mindanao, Sulu, and Palawan islands by the United States of America in the [[Moro–American War]] (1899–1913) after the [[Spanish–American War]] (1899–1902). The Moros [[Moros during World War II|fought against the Japanese invasion in World War II]].

The last four decades [[Moro insurgency in the Philippines|Philippine–Bangsamoro conflict]] perhaps the most recent but not the last stage of Moro Wars. The modern Muslim revolt came in with an unorganized uprising in early 1950 with Kamlon revolt and during the later part of 1968 with organized secessionist Mindanao Independence Movement of Udtog Matalam which jolted the Philippine government. After the infamous [[Jabidah Massacre]] on March 18, 1968 saw the emergence of the Sabah trained "Black Shirts" who fought the Philippine militias called "Ilaga," they came to be known later as the Moro National Liberation Front seeking to establish what it called the independent Bangsamoro Republik. After the declaration of Pres. Marcos of the Martial Law on September 21, 1972, one month later, the Moro rebels in the historic ''Marawi revolt'' stormed Philippine Constabulary camps and government installations in Marawi City and overran the state university calling for Muslim secession and days after like a wild fire the Moro revolution became widespread all over Mindanao. A Philippine Army general, [[Fortunato Abat]],&lt;ref&gt;Gen. Fortunato Abat [http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/003502495] The CEMCOM story: The Day We Nearly Lost Mindanao, Published 2003&lt;/ref&gt; aptly recounted how Philippine nearly lost [[Mindanao]].

The freedom-loving Moro people lived up to its Malay tradition to enjoy the collective life "free" from alien subjugation, control, or dominance. The indigenous human rights to life and self-determination is valiantly defended by the early Moro leaders, chieftains, datus, Sultans, and every Moro freedom fighters in their generations. The American soldiers attested to the ferociousness of the Moro warriors in the battlefield. In continuing the struggle, Maradeka emerged as non-violent political organization as an alternative to armed struggle mounted by the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) during their secessionist campaign beginning in 1968 and sustained by its breakaway groups, namely: MNLF Reformist Group&lt;ref&gt;''The Philippines after Marcos'', by Ronald James May &amp; Francisco Nemenzo [https://books.google.com/books?id=AdYOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA120&amp;lpg=PA120&amp;dq=MNLF+Reformist+group&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8rQIOW5mN0&amp;sig=gWQ7JAOXNbWAVsbeOfvUAzBmZ4s&amp;hl=tl&amp;ei=59aGTvi8FKPkiAKq-py6DA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=MNLF%20Reformist%20group&amp;f=false], Published 1985, p.119–125&lt;/ref&gt; led by Kumander Dimas Pundato and Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MNLF) led by late Ustadz [[Salamat Hashim]] in war for self-rule in Mindanao, the largest southern islands of the Philippines.

The restlessness in the recurrent Mindanao conflict brought Moro political activists and bonded [[Islamists]] and pro-democratic political groups of youth and students, academe, professionals, clerics, workers and employees, businessmen, traders, urban poor, overseas contract workers, and women in the push for broader people participation toward peace and democracy in the Philippines.

==Origin of Rising Moro Organization==
[[File:Maradeka women.jpg|thumb|Maradeka women in Human Rights Action]]Convenors of Maradeka evolved from the middle of the 1980s during the height of Muslim student activism in Mindanao as new option for peaceful and democratic people participation against the backdrop of Bangsamoro people armed resistance against the repressive and chauvinistic Philippine  government of strongman Pres. Marcos. Now, Maradeka as it was formally organized during its Convenor' Assembly in [[University of the Philippines]] as mass organization in July 2000, stepped up the broadening and heightening of mass struggle in the attainment of its lofty aspiration for freedom, justice, human rights, and the assertion of Bangsamoro people's right to self-determination.&lt;ref&gt;Maradeka in Action: The Primer&lt;/ref&gt;

Maradeka had been active in advancing Moro [[civil and political rights]] and the advocacy of peace cognizant of the United Nations International covenants on ECOSOC and Civil and Political Rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/a_ccpr.htm= United Nations international covenants on ECOSOC and Civil and Political Rights]&lt;/ref&gt; The unabated political repression, oppression, and discrimination resulting to serious violations of human rights, civil liberties, and deprivations of economic, cultural and social rights by the government authorities perpetrated against the Muslims in Mindanao,  more popularly known as the Bangsamoro people have caused more public resistance and banded cause-oriented groups to redress collectively these pressing problems confronting them.

Maradeka became active in embarking on direct socio-political action to address the complexities of issues affecting the Muslim communities. The recurrent wars for decades brought thousands in mass poverty and displacement in Mindanao. It believed the war of attrition must come to its end. As Peace Observer, in the peace process between the Government of the Philippines and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, it sought a "win-win" solution to the Mindanao armed conflict, fought against spoilers of peace and saboteurs&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/41597/peace-advocates-hopeful-about-aquino-counter-proposal-to-milf-substate= Peace advocates hopeful about Aquino counter-proposal to MILF substate, Phil. Daily Inquirer]&lt;/ref&gt; and avert impasse of peace talks brokered by Malaysia. If the option for a sub-state formula cannot be met by the Philippine peace panel, the federal option will be viable, or it will seek a "determination vote' to the United Nations as the last option.

==Ideology==
Maradeka espoused the Islamic Ideology and Islamic democracy. It believed in the core values of freedom and equality as the foundation of human dignity and social justice. Like every Muslim organization, Maradeka asserts in the rhetoric of their leaders of Bangsamoro nationhood and the adherence to the political principles of Islam based on its precepts, namely: [[Tawhid]] (Monotheism), Khilafah (Trusteeship), Hakimiyyah (Sovereignty), Risalah (Message), Hukuwat (Brotherhood), and [[Jihad]] (Mass Struggle). It looked forward to the resilience of the freedom-loving Bangsamoro people holding to their ancestors tradition that had found strength in the intrinsic value inherent in the social and political life of the [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] people to live free continually resistant&lt;ref&gt;"The Advent and Growth of Islam in the Philippines," Authored by Dr. Carmen Abubakar [https://books.google.com/books?id=6Js6QXUbmjYC&amp;pg=PA52&amp;lpg=PA52&amp;dq=moro+resistance+from+colonialists&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=J7y2AGVoeN&amp;sig=ckRkNuyS0eR9A6t_zxM2QArzYTg&amp;hl=tl&amp;ei=FfWPTo4ohuSIAraG5MwI&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=moro%20resistance%20from%20colonialists&amp;f=false] Islam in Southeast Asia: political, social and strategic challenges for the 21st Century, edited by K. S. Nathan,Mohammad Hashim Kamali,Institute of Southeast Asian Studies&lt;/ref&gt;  to the influences and dominance of colonial powers- Spanish and American.

Its founders in carrying out its part in the Islamic movement propounded that while the universal Muslim Ummah is in the dire state of ''Darul Harb'' and the [[Muslim world]] is fragmented into nation-states, viewed the [[Khilafat]], the world Islamic government  as a [[utopia]]. Thus, the Muslim organization find their advocacy of temporal socio-political ideology, [[Islamic democracy]] as a transition to absolute realization of comprehensive Islamic way of life and egalitarian state of [[Divisions of the world in Islam#Dar al-Islam|Darul Islam]]. The adoption of Islamic democracy and the building of Sharia-based Islamic democratic government found the model in the Islamic political construct from Islamic Republics in Pakistan, Malaysia, and Iran. In advancing the Islamic democratic ideology, it found inspiration from many Muslim political thinkers notably the political works and treatises of Syed Abu Ala Maududi of [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]] in [[Pakistan]], Abhoud Syed Lingga of Institute of Bangsamoro Studies in the Philippines. It seeks to build a Sharia-based Muslim government and state in Mindanao and Philippines.

The fast Islamic resurgence sweeping the entire Muslim world gradually evolved Maradeka to become another brand of political Islam in the Philippines as it adhered to the Islamic fundamentalist creed&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ip/rep/H007= Islamic Fundamentalism]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; of ''Tauhid: Laa ilaha illaallah, Muhammad Ar-Rasulullah'' (There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is the Final Prophet) whereby in the mainstream of the universal Islamic movement its mode of political action embarks on the Islamic democratic struggle to attain its goals. Though the Muslims in the Philippines appeared to be in the minority with Muslim population consisting of about 14 million, it found fraternal relations with the Muslim world, a total population of 1.4 billion. Maradeka joins the Muslim world and the Pan-Islamic movement and toward realization of the Darul Salam, it envisioned the reconstruction of the universal Muslim [[Ummah]].

==Organization and Operation==
[[File:Maradeka Peace Gathering.jpg|thumb|Maradeka Peace Gathering]]Maradeka is a uniquely reclusive ideological organization operating as Islamic movement but distinctly separate and as it claimed as antithetical to and from wide range political spectrum and groupings in the Philippine political setting. Its ideological doctrine do not permit alliances with secular political parties and any of the factions of Philippine's communist groups or its front organization, be it in the re-affirmist or the rejectionist faction. Maradeka is a cause-oriented mass-based organization with 68 hardline member affiliates from various Moro sectors, regional groups, clerics (ulama), people organizations, civil society, urban community associations, developmental non-government organizations. The Majlis is the Highest Governing Council and The Permanent Secretariat led by the Secretary-General ran the operations of the organization's organs and major action programmes.&lt;ref&gt;Maradeka ''Dostur'', (Constitution)&lt;/ref&gt;

Maradeka was seen as street parliamentarians in an open mass movement in the Philippine political scene. As ideological organization, Maradeka put on its main form of action through democratic dialogues, community consultations (shura), and staged mass actions into the street to demonstrate its protests, public appeals, and demands on various legitimate issues detrimental to the Muslim people. Due to the adverse political environment in the Philippines, Maradeka in support of the MNLF&lt;ref&gt;[http://mnlfnet.com/index.htm= Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) Official Website]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and MILF legitimate struggle has operated vigilantly a non-violent political action albeit cautiously along the steep campaign of the Philippine government against extremism and terrorism.

==Current works, programs and Islamic activities==
[[File:Maradeka March for Peace.jpg|thumb|Maradeka March for Peace]]
Following activities of Maradeka, it endeavored to stand as voice in the defense of the Muslim civil liberties and the human rights protection&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muslimworldleague.org/paper/1787/articles/page15-14.htm= Muslims Assail Defence Chief's Remarks on Madrashas in Philippines, Arab News]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the bearer of the people cause for peace, freedom and in advancing non-violent political action as it actively works for the peaceable resolution of the Mindanao problem&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afrim.org.ph/minda-news-page.php?nid=10149= MILF urges NGOs, CSOs to support genuine peace-making; commends Maradeka]&lt;/ref&gt; and empowering people into direct people participation in the building of genuine self-rule in Mindanao and Philippines. It also works in providing and assisting communities in alleviating mass poverty through grass-root education, community development, capability building, and relief operations and contributes significantly in the mutual understanding and co-existence of inter-faith groups and communities toward a harmonious multi-cultural society and send the message of Islam in wisdom, virtues, and good deeds across the Philippine and South East Asia.

In the Maradeka In Action Primer, it has its Programmatic Actions&lt;ref&gt;Understanding Maradeka Political Programmes&lt;/ref&gt; and among its thrust and programs are: Protection of the civil liberties and fundamental human rights of the Muslim communities in cooperation with various human rights groups. It provides necessary professional works in advocacy, documentation, paralegal trainings, education, networking, and humanitarian assistance to  victims of human rights abuses and their families through legal and medical services; Empowerment of Muslim Communities. It operationalizes practice of Islam as a comprehensive system and ideology in all facets of life in the Muslim communities and enjoins peaceful, open, and liberation mass struggle (jihadun jamian) in attaining its goals and ideals toward prosperity ''(aflaha)''. ''Da'wah and Tazkiah'' works is principally adopted as an organizing strategy in building strong Muslim Ummah; People Initiative for Democratic Rights with peaceful campaign in the resolution of  Mindanao Problem through active promotion of non-violence and Culture of Peace. It asserts the primacy of recognizing the democratic rights of main stakeholders-the Bangsamoro People as the sole determinant of their political status.

Through its member affiliates it pursues development programs such as a welfare-oriented civic assistance which is primarily responsible in helping alleviate mass poverty, dislocation, lack of medical and health services, and victims of calamities and armed conflict in Mindanao. It institutes cooperative development mechanism to provide self-help and self-reliant assistance to the needy and poor, and displaced families in the urban areas and it established solidarity works with people organizations in the Asia-Pacific and the Middle East who share similar common aspiration and ideals. It also build tactical alliance and coalition with Moro political groups and create domestic and global networks with agencies, foreign democratic institutions, or peoples in the advancement of its goals.

==Bangsamoro Democratic Struggle==
'''Asserting the Democratic rights as a people'''. Sources from Philippine media indicated Maradeka stepped forward as voice of civil liberty expression in various Muslim concerns and issues such human rights violations committed against innocent civilians, graft and corruption and electoral frauds in the Philippine political system, and the right to self-determination of the Bangsamoro people. Maradeka subscribed to the assertion by prominent Moro leader Abhoud Syed Lingga&lt;ref&gt;Determining Factor [http://www.opendemocracy.net/determining_factors= Determining Factor]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} by Abhoud Syed Lingga&lt;/ref&gt; of Moro people right or any peoples everywhere in the world to freely determine their political status. The Moro people as distinct people deserved to attain self-determination and for this right to be fully effective, the realization of the political, economic, social and cultural sovereignty of this indigenous people in Mindanao ought to be recognized and respected by the international community and Philippines.

'''Push for Mindanao Peace process'''. Maradeka push for resumption of peace negotiations between Philippines and Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) which was impeded caused by the diplomatic impasse&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manilatimes.net/index.php/news/regions/34915-muslims-want-govt-to-break-impasse-on-milf-peace-talks= Muslim want Philippine gov't. to break impasse on MILF-GPH peace talks, The Manila Times]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; over the disagreement on the choice of third country facilitator and the facilitation process. See the article: Muslims want government to break impasse. In another tussles in Mindanao peace process, Mindanao peace advocates, on the other hand, had decried the public quibbling over the proposed Bangsamoro substate as counter-productive at this crucial stage of the peace negotiations. Maradeka secretary general Nash Pangadapun&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/41597/peace-advocates-hopeful-about-aquino-counter-proposal-to-milf-substate= Peace Advocates Hopeful about Aquino Counter-proposal to MILF substate, PDI]&lt;/ref&gt; also cautioned the public against such premature comments pending the government's submission of its counter-proposal, and called for sobriety. In a very recent development, Maradeka lauded the pronouncement of Secretary Teresita Quintos Deles for the formal signing of peace pact by the Philippine government with the largest Moro rebel front, Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) on March 27, 2014 adding, “After 17 long years of arduous negotiations, we are finally arriving at a political settlement that will seal enduring peace and progress in Mindanao,” Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process Teresita Quintos Deles said Friday. “The signing of the CAB is expected to benefit not only the Bangsamoro but the entire country, and will radiate beyond our borders to the regional community, and perhaps the whole world.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.pia.gov.ph/index.php?article=1751394797075= GPH, MILF to sign comprehensive peace pact on March 27, Philippine Information Agncy, 15 March 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; In a step up for massive information drive thru government controlled Television Network, Maradeka Secretary General Nash Pangadapun urged the spoilers who are out to obstruct the peace deal from coming to fruition to back off and called on the enemies of peace to have "change of heart" as this historic signing to be attended by mediating countries and international communities hoped to end violence against women and children.

'''Advocating Human Rights, Civil Liberties and Anti Discrimination'''. During International Human Rights Day celebration on Dec. 10, 2010 marked the 62nd anniversary of Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Maradeka and the Mindanao Peace Observers launched the March for Peace and Human Rights&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tmchronicles.com/vnewsdetail.php?idnews=1253&amp;&amp;start=1&amp;&amp;end=10= Manila CSOs to MILF, gov't: Rising political tension can flare up into fighting]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the demand of the Mindanao civil society groups for fighting cultural minority rights, Mindanao peace and the release of one senior MILF official Edward Mohandis Guerra and 25 more Moro political detainees arrested by Philippine intelligence operatives. Guerra a Moro leader was arrested on September 22, 2010 in Davao City in time for his departure in a local airport for his attendance to the Geneva's United Nations' Human Rights Council Meeting. In continuing its human rights advocacy, it denounced the attack in North Cotabato and accused the military of perpetrating the bombing and then pinning the blame on the MILF. Maradeka fought against extrajudicial killings,&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.arabnews.com/?page=4&amp;section=0&amp;article=33020&amp;d=4&amp;m=10&amp;y=200= 4 Killed, 20 Injured in Southern Philippine Mosque Attack.

'''Promoting Inter-faith Dialogue and Rejecting Extremism'''. In the after math of the 9/11, Maradeka saw the widespread discrimination against Muslims and Islam. Extremists and terrorists became synonymous with Islam and any bearded and Muslims wearing [[turban]], [[hijab]] or white skullcap were subject of insults and attacks. Abu Sayyaf Group in the Philippines came to hijack Islam&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=K94uDkmRlEcC&amp;pg=PA75&amp;lpg=PA75&amp;dq=nash+pangadapun+maradeka&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=v-F4EVp_hO&amp;sig=c-l0aNOKRev4Uiy-ONHQaO-0Haw&amp;hl=tl&amp;ei=UWZwTuK-AZDirAeD75X4Bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAThQ#v=onepage&amp;q=nash%20pangadapun%20maradeka&amp;f=false= Conflict, Terrorism and the Media in Asia, Benjamin Cole, p. 75-76]&lt;/ref&gt; and the future of Muslims. Maradeka led Moro groups in protesting these discriminatory acts including underhanded treatment of Muslims,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muslimworldleague.org/paper/1787/articles/page15-14.htm= Muslims Assail Defence Chief's Remarks on Madrasas in Philippines, The Muslim World League]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; human rights abuse,&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/news-articles/manila-bulletin/mi_7968/is_2003_July_24/muslim-leaders-slam-pnp-raids/ai_n33518817/= Muslim leaders slam PNP raids]&lt;/ref&gt; Philippine Anti-terrorism law&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mb.com.ph/node/142384= Muslim Leaders support, reject Anti-terrorism bill]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; targeted only Muslims and push for National ID system&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mb.com.ph/node/160225= KNP: ID System should be for all by Edd K.

'''Advance Democratic and Political Reforms'''. Maradeka described Philippines as a fragile "democratic" state. It had entirely copied the [[United States of America]] political system since 1935 Philippine Constitution but it is a failing state because genuine democracy do not exist to run the course of Philippine government but only catered to Hispanic Filipino elites and oligarchy. Muslims continue to protest the annexation of Mindanao, democratic Muslim representation; Moro revolutionary leaders lodge its complain over derogation of the 1996 Jakarta Final Peace Accord and the over 10 years of Philippine gov't and MILF peace negotiations; Muslim civil society groups slammed Philippine court for preventing reforms in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manilatimes.net/index.php/news/top-stories/7362-muslim-groups-slam-obstructionist-tro= Muslim groups slam ‘obstructionist’ TRO, The Manila Times] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120728083759/http://www.manilatimes.net/index.php/news/top-stories/7362-muslim-groups-slam-obstructionist-tro%3D |date=2012-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (ARMM); Now, Muslim leaders seek Constitutional Reforms to pave  the way for "win win" formula to resolve Mindanao problem through a shift to federal form of government in Philippines.

==Supports Freedom and Democracy Movements==
Maradeka lend support to the causes for national liberation movements throughout the world recognizing peoples' their right to self-determination. It is asserting indigenous peoples their full freedom as a birthright and redemption of their national identity and human dignity. Maradeka launched in 2001 the Philippine Committee for Solidarity to Palestine (PHISOP) and take the lead role in Philippine protests against Israel atrocities and illegal annexation of Palestinian homeland. Maradeka expressed support also for the Khasmiris in the Indian-Pakistan dispute, protested the Pres. George Bush and US government for its baseless accusation of Iraq's Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD)and war of aggression against the Iraqi people,&lt;ref&gt;[http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/uae/general/muslim-group-lends-support-to-iraqi-people-1.348544]= Muslim group lends support to Iraqi people, Gulfnews&lt;/ref&gt; and supported the Kurdis people restless liberation struggle from Turkey and Iraq.

Maradeka established links with Muslim democratic agencies and Islamic activists, namely the Center for Islam and Democracy and the Jamaat e Islami in furtherance of its International solidarity action for peace and Islamic democracy.

==Support Peace in Mindanao==
Maradeka supports peace gabs with Moro leaders and Philippine Pres. Aquino III out of the box solution of Mindanao conflict &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mb.com.ph/node/330548/mu#.UPee6h1lns8= Muslim group backs Tokyo meet]&lt;/ref&gt; and conclusion of peace between Moro Islamic Liberation Front and Philippine government with the forging of Framework Agreement on the Bangsamoro on October 15, 2012 as a breakthrough in providing roadmap to finally decades of armed hostilities in Mindanao. Though, Maradeka is not completely giving up on the liberation struggle but it sees the opportunities of giving peace the chance and consolidating people under a Bangsamoro government. It called all Moro factions particularly MNLF's leader Nur Misuari to cooperate and heed the call of the Moro youth and work out a political mechanism to end factionalism through the political system offered under the Bangsamoro democratic government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/288500/rebels-tomarch-on-malacanang= Rebels to‘march’ to Malacañang, Philippine Daily Inquirer]&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Philippine government and Moro Islamic Liberation Front gone through their peace panels hurdling the four (4) annexes to complete the Framework Agreement on the Bangsamoro (FAB) and draft the Compreehensive Agreement of the Bangsamoro (CAB), the installation of the Bangsamoro Transition Commission (BTC) was shaping up the Bangsamoro Basic Law which will govern the self-governing entity called Bangsamoro Ministerial Government through sessions with experts with the aid of United Nations and World Bank(Fastrac)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2013/04/29/moro-islamic-liberation-front-united-nations-and-world-bank-launch-advisory-facility-to-support-peace-process-in-southern-philippines= Moro Islamic Liberation Front, United Nations and World Bank Launch Advisory Facility to Support Peace Process in Southern Philippines, The World Bank, April 28, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; and broad public consultations in all areas covered under the agreed upon Bangsamoro territories. In this light, Maradeka re-echoed the call of the traditional political leaders not to abandon traditional political system of Mindanao but the inclusion of the homegrown Sultanates of four known territorial Sultanates, such as the Sultanates of Maguindanao, Sulu, Buayan, and Pangampong (Federated) of Ranaw.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/572800/muslim-council-of-elders-urged= Muslim council of elders urged, Philippine Daily Inquirer, February 2, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; into the political structure to be created for the new Bangsamoro political entity, whose Basic Law is set to be tackled soon by Philippine government and Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) representatives and passed on for legislation at the Philippine Congress by the end of 2014.

'''Martin Mystery''' ([[French language|French]] and [[Italian language|Italian]]: '''Martin Mystère''') is an [[animated television series]] based on the Italian ''[[Martin Mystère]]'' comic by [[Alfredo Castelli]]. The show was produced by [[Marathon Media Group]] (French television production company based in Paris), [[Rai Fiction]] (Italian production company), and [[Image Entertainment Corporation]] (a Canadian production and animation company based in Montreal). It uses an art style similar to Japanese [[anime]].

==Plot==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2013}}

The series re-imagines the comic books' main characters (Martin Mystery and Diana Lombard) as 16-year-old step-siblings attending Torrington Academy, a high school in [[Sherbrooke]], [[Quebec]]. They work for a covert organization known as "The Center," which covertly protects the people of Earth from supernatural threats. Their allies at The Center include Billy (a small, green-skinned alien), who is one of Martin's best friends, and Java (a caveman from 200,000 years ago), who works as a janitor at Torrington Academy. Martin's vast knowledge of the supernatural and his remarkable intuition make him a valued agent of The Center, and compensate for his huge ego and poor personal hygiene. Diana resents these flaws at times, as Martin often does not seem to understand the seriousness of his missions, but generally loves him like any sister.

==Characters==
;Martin Mystery
:Martin is a 16-year-old boy, with a passion for monsters and the paranormal, who works as a paranormal investigator for "The Center". He is usually an underachiever at school, once getting 106 out of 902 on his pre-college aptitude test, but at the final of the serie, he got an A+ at an history test (while Diana got A-). However, as Center agent he often proved that he is clever and quick thinker. Martin has a peculiar love for everything slimy, sloppy, and gooey - things that make Diana gag. Martin's favourite hobby is teasing Diana with practical jokes and creeping her out, even though she often retaliates with physical abuse. Regardless of whether he is at school or on a mission, he remains an immature and hyperactive nerd, constantly bursting with energy. He seldom thinks before leaping into danger, often helping those in peril whenever the team are on a mission. Martin has a tendency to jump to conclusions and come up with every unlikely theory he can think of, usually from some movie he saw or from his subscription to "Paranormal Monthly". As the leader of the trio, Martin is also the only one who wears a U-Watch. Martin's first monster was Venoso, a female chameleon monster that has the power to shape-shift into any person it wants.

:He is seen in a crossover episode of ''[[Totally Spies!]]''. During the episode, he is smitten with [[List of Totally Spies! characters|Clover]], even though she seems uninterested in him. Towards the end of the same episode, Clover tries to get his attention, but Martin and [[List of Totally Spies! characters|Alex]] have hit it off due to a shared love of comics and video games. Throughout the episode, Martin continuously describes [[List of Totally Spies! characters|Sam]] as a "really lame buzz-kill" just like his sister, which causes her to lash out at him as Diana normally does. A [[running gag]] in the series is Martin's constant flirting with every beautiful girl he meets, who usually reject him with verbal or (in Jenni's case) physical abuse. Martin is voiced by [[Samuel Vincent]] (Canada and USA) and Corrado Conforti (Italy).

;Diana Lombard
:Diana is a 16-year-old girl, usually seen with her two signature hair clips and her small purple shoulder bag. She is normally seen as the clean-freak, goody-goody, overachiever, and brainiac of the trio. Diana can be very jumpy and squeamish at times, which leads to Martin calling her a "wimp". However, she shows great courage when called upon and her intelligence often comes in handy on their missions. Not sharing Martin's love of the paranormal, she often tries to reason with logic instead of jumping to conclusions.

:Diana has a hard time keeping her cool with Martin and will generally slap, kick, beat on, or scream at him quite often. Their arguments tend to end in some sort of bet, which Diana usually loses. She also seems to be the "bait" for the majority of the missions and is often one of the earliest victims, including being cocooned by an acid-spewing insect queen, turned into a frog by a warlock Martin unleashed, and being possessed by a vengeful spirit at a mountain lodge. When Martin is incapacitated by other monsters, Diana uses her own skills to save him and even wears Martin's U-watch in a few episodes. Diana is voiced by [[Kelly Sheridan]].

;Java the Caveman
:[[Java (Martin Mystère)|Java]], the 200,000-year-old caveman, is friends with both Martin and Diana. He works at Torrington as a cook and a janitor. However, Java assists Martin and Diana in their investigations, serving as the team's tracker. His brute strength proves useful when battling monstrous foes or breaking through barriers.

:Even though he is a lover of lizards and spiders, Java fears cats, heights, and technology. His fear of technology is a running gag in the show. Java's English is fairly simplistic, thus he does not contribute meaningfully to most conversations (e.g. "What that?", "Diana bald", and "Java no like this place"). Despite this shortcoming, Java has a knack for thinking "outside the box", which greatly helps in the team's investigations. Java is a significant source of comedy in the show due to his reactions to various scenarios and his poor hygiene as a caveman (e.g. his offensive foot odor, stinky armpits, and filthy breath). Java is sometimes the victim of the paranormal, including being transformed into a monster, such as when he inhaled the Chaos Beast in its gas form, or was brainwashed by a pirate-controlled Martin. Java is voiced by [[Dale Wilson (actor)|Dale Wilson]].

;M.O.M.
:As the multi-tasking director of "The Center", M.O.M. oversees the investigation of paranormal activities throughout the world. Martin's capabilities make him one of her favourite agents - if "favourite" is taken to mean "the agent that she would rather spend the most time with in the field and out of her office". Her real name is unknown, though she used the alias Ms. Olivia Mandell (derived from the initials M.O.M.) in the episode "Web of the Spider Creature".

:Before working at The Center, she used to drive an ice cream truck. Serious, uncompromising, and an expert at hand-to-hand combat, she usually has to deal with Martin blowing up nearly every piece of gadgetry she is working on whenever he appears for a debriefing in her office (a running gag until season 3). Despite her typically dry sense of humor, M.O.M. is actually - as Billy says - "a real party animal when she gets going". The team sees proof of this when she accidentally shows them a series of photographs in the episode "The Amazon Vapor", while trying to debrief them on their next mission, due to some malfunctions at The Center. When she was an agent, the first creature she captured was Gastromo, a parasitic, iron-eating, slug-like monster who infects and controls those he touches. It appears her favourite holiday is Christmas when she is always in a rather happy and festive mood. As a result, Martin says in disbelief that it looks like "M.O.M. is actually having fun". In the crossover episode of ''[[Totally Spies!]]'' titled "Totally Mystery Much?", M.O.M. is shown to have a possibly romantic history with the spies' boss Jerry, much to the spies' and Martin's displeasure, as she and Jerry spy-flirt between holograms. The initials M.O.M. are said to actually stand for "Mystery Organization Manager", as explained by Martin in that episode. M.O.M. is voiced by [[Teryl Rothery]].

;Billy
:Billy is a tiny green alien who works for "The Center", as M.O.M.'s personal secretary, often seen flying on his mini hovercraft. He idolizes Martin and in one episode, it was revealed that he even has a picture of Martin (marking him as the "crazed fan of the show" archetype). He usually greets the gang when they are first signed in, and often does his signature high five with Martin. His role is generally a supportive one; he pops in sometimes during a mission to give Martin, Diana, and Java valuable information, usually startling them in the process. He also analyses slime or fabric samples that Martin sends in during a mission. However, he won't help Martin and the gang on a mission directly unless he is forced to.

:In the second season, Billy was revealed to have once been a great alien warrior, known as Ganthar, on another planet, but he gave up violence for good. When Martin asked why a planet on Billy's list of hologram worlds was blue, it was revealed by M.O.M. to be the world which changed Ganthar into Billy, which is the reason he doesn't go on missions with the other three agents. He arrived on Earth in the [[Roswell UFO Incident]] in 1947. Billy adopted a human disguise — the "B.S. 1000" — to be with Martin and Diana at their school. There are a few episodes in season 3, in which it is hinted that he has romantic feelings for Diana, such as one of the Christmas specials where he invited her under the mistletoe and actually went on a friendly date with her. It is revealed in the episode "Revenge of the Doppelganger" that Billy was once a supermodel on his home planet. This might be true; since he was fearsome and powerful, he might have been popular with his people. Billy is also voiced by [[Samuel Vincent]].

;Jenni Anderson
:Jenni is Diana's best friend and Martin's love interest, although she does not return any of his affection. Her view of Martin is generally not very flattering. She describes him as "immature", a "freak", and a "loser". Jenni is also one of the prettiest and most popular girls attending Torrington. She has blue eyes and flared auburn-coloured hair, usually seen wearing a black blouse and skirt with knee-high boots.

:Though Jenni usually sees Martin as a "brat", there have been times where she actually seems interested in pursuing a relationship with him, particularly when Martin acts like a gentleman. Unfortunately for Martin, though, this never lasts. Reasons for this included her memory being erased, Martin subsequently doing something stupid, or something else interfering, like when Jenni moved away for a semester. Jenni is voiced by [[Tabitha St. Germain]].

;Marvin
:Marvin, Martin's rival, enjoys the extreme, saying that he enjoys the adrenaline rush that comes with such activities. Some of his activities includes rock climbing in the [[Himalayas]], parasailing over the [[Great Barrier Reef]], street-luging on the German [[Autobahn]], jungle kayaking, and snowboarding down the face of [[K2]]. He does virtually everything that Martin himself can do, but better, and even dresses similarly. His father is a pilot, explaining Marvin's ability to travel around the world frequently. Marin is intelligent and smart and, apparently, more cerebral than Martin.

:Marvin first appeared in the episode "Attack of the Mothman" where he shows off his skateboarding skills and a comic book featuring a protagonist based on him. His talents and popularity make Martin jealous as Diana, Java, Jenni, Billy, and even Torrington as a whole fawn over him. He reappears in "The Amazon Vapor" where he discovers Martin and Diana's secret and helps on their mission with his talents and quick thinking. Diana fears and Martin hopes that they will erase his memory of the event. However, in "The Third Eye", it is revealed that he works for The Center and has acquired his own U-Watch because M.O.M. recognized his amazing potential.

:Unfortunately, he ends up being relegated to The Center's South Pole facility because of his negligence in the previous mission, and blames his unfortunate circumstances on Martin. Martin remarks that it is not really that bad because he has a beautiful team mate, whom Martin has a crush on in the episode. Martin and Marvin continue in their mutual dislike until the episode "Body-Swappers", when Martin gives Marvin the majority of the credit for getting rid of the parasite and M.O.M. decides to relocate Marvin to Hawaii. In a subsequent episode, "Rage of the Leprechaun", Marvin contacts Martin and Diana for help after being stalked by a leprechaun that wanted to get back the magically lucky, four-leafed clover Marvin had stolen from him. After the incident, Marvin is punished by M.O.M. for keeping the clover instead of getting rid of it, which Martin calls a "rookie mistake", but M.O.M. is equally disappointed in him for letting greed get the best of him as well. What happens to Marvin after that is unknown, as he is not mentioned in the remainder of the series but it was presumed Marvin was sent back to The Center's South Pole facility as punishment. Marvin is voiced by [[Matt Hill]].

;Gerard Mystery
:Gerard Mystery is Martin's father and Diana's step-father. Unlike his immature son, Gerard is a very rational, logical person like Diana and considers anything related to the paranormal to be "balderdash". As a scientist, he spends much of his time doing field work in the forest. In the third season, he finds out about "The Center" and that Diana and Martin work for it. Diana's mother is never mentioned in the series and Gerard only spoke about Martin's mother once in season 3, when he thought Martin was going to tell his mom about what happened, when Martin was actually speaking about M.O.M. Gerard is voiced by [[Michael Donovan]].

'''''Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman''''' is an American satirical [[soap opera]] that aired in daily (weekday) [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] from January 1976 to May 1977. The series was produced by [[Norman Lear]], directed by [[Joan Darling]], [[Jim Drake (director)|Jim Drake]], Nessa Hyams, and Giovanna Nigro, and starred [[Louise Lasser]]. The series writers were [[Gail Parent]] and [[Ann Marcus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Barliant|first=Claire|title=From a Waxy Yellow Buildup to a Nervous Breakdown: The Fleeting Existence of Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman|url=http://www.eastofborneo.org/articles/from-a-waxy-yellow-buildup-to-a-nervous-breakdown-the-fleeting-existence-of-mary-hartman-mary-hartman|accessdate=May 24, 2011|newspaper=East of Borneo|date=October 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show's title was the eponymous character's name stated twice, because Lear and the writers believed that dialogue within a soap opera was always said twice.

In 2004 and 2007, ''Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman'' was ranked #21 and #26 on "TV Guide's Top [[Cult following|Cult Shows]] Ever."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forums.tannerworld.com/showthread.php?t=4001|title=TV Guide's 25 Top Cult Shows&amp;nbsp;– TannerWorld Junction|work=TannerWorld Junction|date=May 26, 2004|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104213337/http://forums.tannerworld.com/showthread.php?t=4001|archivedate=January 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TopCultShows"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/top-cult-shows-40239.aspx|title=TV Guide Names the Top Cult Shows Ever – Today's News: Our Take|work=tvguide.com|publisher=[[TV Guide]]|date=June 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and production==

In December 1974, Norman Lear and his entertainment company, [[Tandem Productions]], created a pilot for his new [[Serial (radio and television)|serial]], ''Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman'', a satire of the impact of American consumerism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1974/12/26/page/46/article/tempo-people|title=Tower Ticker by Aaron Gold, Section 3, Page 2|work=chicagotribune.com|accessdate=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pilot, consisting of two episodes and shot on a $100,000 (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|100000|1974}}}} today) budget,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1974/12/26/page/46/article/tempo-people|title=Tower Ticker by Aaron Gold, Section 3, Page 2|work=chicagotribune.com|accessdate=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; was not picked up by the networks. Lear then pursued a syndication strategy by hiring a sales agent to sell the show at the 1976 [[National Association of Television Program Executives]] (NATPE) market in San Francisco.

Needing a solution, Lear’s business contacts introduced him to James W. Packer Jr. and his company, Mission Argyle Productions. Packer devised a unique sales idea: invite the general managers from TV stations across America to Lear’s house in Los Angeles, where they would dine with him, hear his vision for the show, and begin the syndication dealmaking the following day. The next day [[KING-TV]] of Seattle became the first station to procure syndication rights to ''Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman''.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

==Setting==
The series took place in the fictional town of Fernwood, Ohio. There is in fact a ''real'' Fernwood, Ohio, located in [[Jefferson County, Ohio|Jefferson County]], but the series derived its name from Fernwood Avenue, which runs behind the [[KTLA]]/[[Sunset Bronson Studios]] where the show was taped.

==Premise==
''Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman'' follows the titular character through increasingly complex and compounding life-events and scenarios often reflective of the changing social fabric of America in the 1970s. Some of the character's key traits, unusual, but prescient for the times, include her initially numbed-out response to conflicts both external and emotional, her indecisiveness, and her potential to suddenly snap out of one state of mind and swing to its opposite. Moral quandaries frequently seem on the verge of vanishing into apathy, until she is reminded of her love for her family and the need to keep them together.

''Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman'''s twisting, interwoven, elaborate plots and tongue-in-cheek melodrama lovingly lampooned the soap opera format in ways that set the stage for cult shows featuring plot labyrinths, like ''[[Soap (TV series)|Soap]]'' and ''[[Twin Peaks]]''.

In its first episode, ''Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman'' introduced the Lombardi family of five, all of whom, along with their two goats and eight chickens, had been murdered by young Davey Jessup, an event witnessed by both Mary's daughter, Heather, and the "Fernwood Flasher," who turned out to be Mary's grandfather, Raymond Larkin. Other characters on the show also died in several unusual, even bizarre ways, including by being [[electrocution|electrocuted]] in the bathtub (Jimmy Joe Jeeter), by [[drowning]] in [[chicken soup]] (Coach Leroy Fedders), and by being [[impalement|impaled]] on a pink bottle brush artificial [[Christmas tree]] (Garth Gimble).

Mary Hartman had a nationally televised [[nervous breakdown]] on ''The [[David Susskind]] Show'' at the end of the first season. Mary then found herself in a [[psychiatric ward]], where she was delighted to be part of their selected [[Nielsen ratings]] "family." One of her sanitarium mates, widowed Wanda Rittenhouse (Marian Mercer), would become more prominent later on when she married Merle Jeeter, the mayor of Fernwood.

==''Forever Fernwood''==
When Lasser left the show in 1977, it was re-branded ''Forever Fernwood'' and followed the trials and tribulations of Mary's family and friends after she had run away with a policeman, the aforementioned Sgt. Dennis Foley, with whom she had had a lot of contact during the first season. Aside from Lasser, the rest of the cast remained intact even while additional actors became part of the cast: [[Shelley Fabares]] as Eleanor Major, who began dating Tom after Mary had left him; [[Judith Kahan]] as Eleanor's stuttering sister, Penny Major; and [[Randall Carver]] as Cathy Shumway's gangster husband, Jeffrey DeVito.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tvguide.com/detail/tv-show.aspx?tvobjectid=201455&amp;more=ucepisodelist&amp;episodeid=676015|title=Forever Fernwood TV Show: News, Videos, Full Episodes and More|work=TVGuide.com|accessdate=2016-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tvguide.com/detail/tv-show.aspx?tvobjectid=201455&amp;more=ucepisodelist&amp;episodeid=1051758|title=Forever Fernwood TV Show: News, Videos, Full Episodes and More|work=TVGuide.com|accessdate=2016-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the very last episode of the series Penny married Tom Hartman. ''Forever Fernwood'' ended in 1978, after 26 weeks on the air (130 half-hour episodes).

==Spin-offs==
During the summer of 1977, ''[[Fernwood 2 Night]]'', a local talk show satire and parody starring [[Martin Mull]] as Barth Gimble, aired as a spin-off/summer replacement for ''Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman''. It went "nationwide" as ''[[America 2-Night]]'' in 1978.

==Cast reunion==
In 2000, several of the original cast appeared on a panel for a ''Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman'' retrospective at the [[The Paley Center for Media|Museum of Television and Radio]] in Beverly Hills, California. The panel discussion was taped for the museum's archives.

Factory]] had acquired the rights to the series and released ''Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman – The Complete Series'' on DVD in Region 1 on December 3, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Mary-Hartman-Mary-Hartman-The-Complete-Series/18935|title='The Complete Series' Press Release: Extras Include 'Fernwood 2 Night'!|work=tvshowsondvd.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130907184313/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Mary-Hartman-Mary-Hartman-The-Complete-Series/18935|archivedate=2013-09-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 38-disc set features all 325 episodes of the series.

The [[Constitution of Croatia]] in its [[preamble]] defines [[Croatia]] as a [[nation state]] of ethnic [[Croats]], a country of traditionally present [[Community|communities]] that the constitution recognizes as [[National minority|national minorities]] and a country of all its [[Citizenship|citizens]]. National minorities explicitly enumerated and recognized in the Constitution are [[Serbs of Croatia|Serbs]], [[Czechs of Croatia|Czechs]], [[Slovaks of Croatia|Slovaks]], [[Italians of Croatia|Italians]], [[Hungarians of Croatia|Hungarians]], [[History of the Jews in Croatia|Jews]], [[Germans of Croatia|Germans]], [[Austrians of Croatia|Austrians]], [[Ukrainians of Croatia|Ukrainians]], [[Pannonian Rusyns|Rusyns]], [[Bosniaks of Croatia|Bosniaks]], [[Slovenes of Croatia|Slovenes]], [[Montenegrins of Croatia|Montenegrins]], [[Macedonians of Croatia|Macedonians]], [[Russians of Croatia|Russians]], [[Bulgarians in Croatia|Bulgarians]], [[Poles of Croatia|Poles]], [[Romani people in Croatia|Romani]], [[Romanians of Croatia|Romanians]], [[Turks of Croatia|Turks]], [[Vlachs of Croatia|Vlachs]] and [[Albanians of Croatia|Albanians]]. Article 12 of the constitution states that the official language in Croatia is the [[Croatian language]], but also states that in some local governments another language and [[Cyrillic]] or some other script can be introduced in official use.

The official use of minority languages is defined by relevant [[Croatian law|national legislation]] and [[:Category:Treaties of Croatia|international conventions and agreements]] which Croatia signed. The most important national laws are [[Constitutional Act on the Rights of National Minorities in the Republic of Croatia|Constitutional Act on the Rights of National Minorities]], [[Law on Use of Languages and Scripts of National Minorities]] and [[The Law on Education in language and script of national minorities]]. Relevant international agreements are [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]] and [[Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities]]. Certain rights were achieved through bilateral agreements and international agreements such as [[Treaty of Osimo]] and [[Erdut Agreement]].

The required 33.3% of the minority population in certain local government units for obligatory introduction of official use of minority languages is considered high, taking into account that ''The Advisory Committee on the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities'' of the [[Council of Europe]] considers a threshold from 10% to 20% reasonable.&lt;ref name="Minority Rights Group International"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minorityrights.org/download.php@id=122|title=Minorities in Croatia Report, page 24|publisher=[[Minority Rights Group International]]| format=PDF|accessdate=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Croatia does not always show favorable views on issues of minority rights but [[2013 enlargement of the European Union|Croatian European Union accession process]] positively influenced public usage of minority languages.&lt;ref name="Acta Universitatis Sapientiae"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acta.sapientia.ro/acta-euro/C3/euro3-3.pdf|title=Language Policy in Istria, Croatia–Legislation Regarding Minority Language Use, page 61 |publisher=Acta Universitatis Sapientiae, European and Regional Studies, 3 (2013) 47-64 |format=PDF |accessdate=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Mir wëlle bleiwe wat mir sinn''''' ({{IPA-lb|miːə̯ ˈvələ ˈblɑɪ̯və vɑt miːə̯ ˈzin|}}; [[Luxembourgish language|Luxembourgish]] for "We want to remain what we are"; archaic spelling ''Mir w'''ö'''lle bleiwe wat mir sin'') is the [[national motto]] of [[Luxembourg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wort.lu/en/luxembourg/do-you-know-luxembourg-s-national-anthem-51c6f1cde4b02fa5029bebcf|title= Do you know Luxembourg's national anthem?|date=June 23, 2013|work=[[Luxemburger Wort]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The national motto is also translated into the other two official languages, French and German, although they do not have the status of a national language: "''Nous voulons rester ce que nous sommes''" ([[French language|French]]) and "''Wir wollen bleiben, was wir sind''" ([[German language|German]]). It refers to the ambition of the [[Luxembourgish people]] to remain separate from, and [[independence|independent]] of, those neighbouring countries around it that have traditionally tried to dominate it politically, economically as well as militarily and, as final goal, to annex it: [[Belgium]], [[France]] and [[Germany]] ([[Prussia]] before the first [[Unification of Germany|German unification of 1870–71]]).

==Origin==
The phrase's origin can be traced back to ''De Feierwon'', a patriotic song written in 1859 to pay homage to the first international (cross-border) railway in the country. Its chorus reads:

:Kommt hier aus Frankräich, Belgie, Preisen,
:Mir wellen iech ons Hémecht weisen,
:Frot dir no alle Säiten hin,
:Mir welle bleiwe wat mir sin.
 
In English, this reads:
:Come here from France, Belgium, Prussia, 
:we want to show you our fatherland
:ask in all directions, 
:We want to remain what we are.

'''Moussaka''' ({{IPAc-en|m|uː|ˈ|s|ɑː|k|ə}}, {{IPAc-en|ˌ|m|uː|s|ə|ˈ|k|ɑː}} or {{IPAc-en|ˌ|m|uː|s|ɑː|ˈ|k|ɑː}}) is an [[eggplant]]- (aubergine) or potato-based dish, often including [[ground meat]], in the [[Levant]], [[Middle East]], and [[Balkans]], with many local and regional variations.

The most famous version of the dish today appeared in the 1920s with the publishing of [[Nikolaos Tselementes]]' culinary book in [[Greece]].  Many versions have a top layer made of milk-based sauce thickened with egg ([[custard]]) or flour ([[béchamel sauce]]). In [[Greece]], the dish is layered and typically served hot. In [[Turkey]], thinly sliced eggplant is [[frying|fried]] and served in a tomato-based meat sauce. Turkish ''mussaka'' may be consumed warm or at room temperature. In the [[Arab world]] it is usually eaten cold.

== Names and etymology ==

The English name for moussaka has Arabic origin  ''musaqqa‘a'' ({{lang|ar|مسقعة}}), literally 'that which is fed liquid'. It was reborrowed from [[Modern Greek language|Greek]] ''{{lang|el-Latn|mousakás}}'' ({{lang|el|μουσακάς}}) and from other Balkan languages, all of which borrowed the word from Ottoman.&lt;ref name="oed"&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' 3rd ed., March 2003 [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/122981 ''s.v.''] (subscription)&lt;/ref&gt; The word is first attested in English in 1862, written ''mùzàkkà''.&lt;ref name="oed"/&gt;

== Preparation ==

=== Greece ===
[[File:Moussaka and Greek Salad at a taverna in Greece.jpg|thumb|263x263px|Moussaka and [[Greek salad|Greek Salad]] at a taverna in Greece]]
Most versions are based primarily on [[Sautéing|sautéed]] [[aubergine]] (eggplant) and [[tomato]], usually with minced meat, mostly lamb. However, the [[Greek cuisine|Greek]] version includes layers of meat and eggplant topped with a [[Béchamel sauce|Béchamel ("white") sauce]], and baked. It seems likely that the Greek moussaka has Arab origins and is related to the Levantine musakhkhan, with the word moussaka derived from this Arab word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Did You Know: Food History – Is This the First Moussaka?|url=http://www.cliffordawright.com/caw/food/entries/display.php/id/80/|website=www.cliffordawright.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern Greek version was created by the French-trained Greek chef  [[Nikolaos Tselementes]] in the 1920s.&lt;ref name="Kremezi 1995"&gt;Aglaia Kremezi, "Nikolas Tselementes", ''Cooks and Other People'', Proceedings of the Oxford Symposium on Food and Cookery, [https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=lpOqTUucwhUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;pg=GBS.PA167 p. 167]: "before Tselementes there was no ''moussaka'', as we know it today"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kremezi 2010"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/food/archive/2010/07/classic-greek-cuisine-not-so-classic/59600 |title='Classic' Greek Cuisine: Not So Classic |last=Kremezi |first=Aglaia |authorlink=Aglaia Kremezi |date=13 July 2010 |website=[[The Atlantic]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216231142/http://www.theatlantic.com:80/health/archive/2010/07/classic-greek-cuisine-not-so-classic/59600 |archive-date=16 February 2012 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; A classic recipe has three layers that are separately cooked before being combined for the final baking: a bottom layer of sliced eggplant sautéed in olive oil; a middle layer of ground lamb lightly cooked with chopped or puréed tomatoes, onion, [[garlic]], and [[spice]]s ([[cinnamon]], [[allspice]] and [[black pepper]]); and a top layer of [[Béchamel sauce]] or savoury [[custard]]. The composed dish is then layered into a pan and baked until the top layer is browned. Moussaka is usually served warm, not piping hot; if cut hot out of the oven, moussaka squares tend to slide apart and consequently the dish needs some resting time to firm up before serving.  Reheating, however, does not present the same problem.
[[File:Thassos 2014-2 166.JPG|thumb|261x261px|A typical dish of [[Greek cuisine|Greek]] Moussaka]]
There are variations on this basic recipe, sometimes with no top sauce, sometimes with other vegetables.  Such variants may include, in addition to the eggplant slices, sautéed [[zucchini]] (courgette) slices, part-fried potato slices, or sautéed [[Edible mushroom|mushrooms]]. There is a [[Eastern Orthodox Church#Fasting|fast-day]] ([[vegan]]) version in Tselementes' cookbook, which includes neither meat nor dairy products, just vegetables (ground eggplant is used instead of ground meat), tomato sauce, and bread crumbs.

{{Anchor|papoutsakia}}Another variant is ''{{lang|el-Latn|(melitzanes) papoutsakia}}'' {{lang|el|(μελιτζάνες) παπουτσάκια}}  (''lit.'' 'eggplant, little shoe style') which consists of whole small eggplant stuffed with ground meat and topped with béchamel and baked.

=== Levant ===
In the [[Levant]], moussaka is a cooked dish made up primarily of tomatoes and eggplant, similar to [[Sicilian cuisine|Sicilian]] [[caponata]], and may also include [[chickpea]]s. It may be served cold as a [[mezze]] dish, or hot.

=== Egypt ===
The [[Egyptian cuisine|Egyptian]] version of moussaka is made from layers of fried eggplant immersed in tomato sauce and then baked. A layer of seasoned cooked ground beef is usually added between the eggplant before baking. The dish can be served hot but is usually chilled for a day or so to improve the taste.

=== Turkey ===

There are also variants with [[zucchini]] (''{{lang|tr|kabak musakka}}''), carrots (''{{lang|tr|havuç musakka}}'') and potatoes (''{{lang|tr|patates musakka}}'').

There is also a three-layer version: the bottom layer consists of ground pork and beef, the middle layer of potato slices, and the top layer is typically a [[custard]]. Each layer is cooked on its own and layered in a pan and baked until the top is browned.

The Romanian version is made usually with potatoes or eggplant or cabbage. The layers start with the vegetable, then the layer of meat (usually pork), then vegetables, until the pot is full. Sometimes bread crumbs are used for toppings, sometimes slices of tomatoes and crushed cheese. The pot is then filled with tomato sauce. There is also a pasta variant, with pasta being used instead of vegetables. The "fasting" variant, which is [[vegan]], replaces meat with mushrooms or a mix of sautéed onions and rice.

In the rest of the [[Balkans]], the top layer is often a [[custard]]: this is the version introduced in the UK by [[Elizabeth David]]'s ''Mediterranean Cookery'' and where it remains the usual presentation. Grated [[cheese]] or bread crumbs are often sprinkled on top.

{{Literature}}

'''Mythopoeia''' (also '''mythopoesis''', after [[Koine Greek|Hellenistic Greek]] {{lang|grc|μυθοποιία, μυθοποίησις}} "myth-making") is a narrative [[genre]] in modern [[literature]] and [[film]] where a fictional or artificial [[mythology]] is created by the writer of [[prose fiction|prose]] or other fiction. This meaning of the word ''mythopoeia'' follows its use by [[#Tolkien | J. R. R. Tolkien]] in the 1930s. The authors in this genre integrate traditional [[mytheme|mythological themes]] and [[archetypes]] into fiction.

==Introduction and definition==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2010}}
Mythopoeia is also the act of making (creating) mythologies. Notable mythopoeic authors include [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], [[C. S. Lewis]], [[William Blake]], [[H. P. Lovecraft]], [[Edward Plunkett, 18th Baron of Dunsany|Lord Dunsany]], [[George R. R. Martin]], [[Mervyn Peake]] and [[George MacDonald]]. While many literary works carry mythic [[Theme (literature)|themes]], only a few approach the dense self-referentiality and purpose of mythopoeia. It is invented [[mythology]] that, rather than arising out of centuries of oral tradition, are penned over a short period of time by a single author or small group of collaborators.

As distinguished from [[fantasy world]]s or [[fictional universe]]s aimed at the evocation of detailed worlds with well-ordered histories, geographies, and laws of nature, mythopoeia aims at imitating and including real-world mythology, specifically created to bring mythology to modern readers, and/or to add credibility and literary depth to fictional worlds in [[fantasy]] or [[science fiction]] books and movies.

Mythopoeia are almost invariably created entirely by an individual, like the world of [[Middle-earth]].

==Etymology==
The term '''mythopoeia''' is from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|μυθοποιία}}, "myth-making".&lt;ref&gt;New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; In early uses, it referred to the making of myths in ancient times.&lt;ref&gt;For example, "The first two, the most remote stages, are purely linguistic germs of mythology: the third is in the domain of mythopoeia, or myth-building."  {{cite book| last = Bunsen| first = C. C. J.| authorlink = Christian Karl Josias von Bunsen| title = Egypt's Place in Universal History: an Historical Investigation in Five Books, Volume IV| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=2oFJAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA450| accessdate = 2009-08-03| year = 1860| publisher = Longman, Green, Longman, and Roberts| page = 450| others=Translated by Charles H. Cottrell }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was adopted and used by Tolkien as a title of [[Mythopoeia (poem)|one of his poems]], written in 1931 and published in ''[[Tree and Leaf]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mercury.ccil.org/~cowan/mythopoeia.html|title=Mythopoeia by J.R.R. Tolkien|work=ccil.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060109194442/http://mercury.ccil.org/~cowan/mythopoeia.html|archivedate=9 January 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poem popularized the word ''mythopoeia'' as a literary and artistic endeavor and genre.

==Place in society==
Works of mythopoeia are often categorized as [[fantasy]] or [[science fiction]] but fill a niche for mythology in the modern world, according to [[Joseph Campbell]], a famous student of world mythology. Campbell spoke of a [[Nietzsche]]an world which has today outlived much of the mythology of the past. He claimed that new myths must be created, but he believed that present culture is changing too rapidly for society to be completely described by any such mythological framework until a later age.

==Critics of the genre==
Mythopoeia is sometimes called ''artificial mythology'', which emphasizes that it did not evolve naturally and is an artifice comparable with [[artificial language]], so should not be taken seriously as mythology. For example, the noted folklorist [[Alan Dundes]] argued that "any novel cannot meet the cultural criteria of myth. A work of art, or artifice, cannot be said to be the narrative of a culture's sacred tradition...[it is] at most, artificial myth."&lt;ref name="adcox"&gt;Dundes, quoted by Adcox, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In literature==

===Lord Dunsany===
[[Lord Dunsany]]'s book "[[The Gods of Pegana]]", published in 1905, is a series of short stories linked by Dunsany's invented pantheon of deities who dwell in Pegāna. It was followed by a further collection Time and the Gods and by some stories in The Sword of Welleran and Other Stories and in Tales of Three Hemispheres. In 1919 Dunsany told an American interviewer "In The Gods of Pegana I tried to account for the ocean and the moon. I don't know whether anyone else has ever tried that before".&lt;ref&gt;[[M. K. Wisehart]], "Ideals and Fame: A One-Act Conversation With Lord Dunsany," ''[[The Sun (New York)|New York Sun]] Book World'', 19 October 1919, p.25&lt;/ref&gt; Dunsany's work influenced J. R. R. Tolkien's later writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dilworth|first=Dianna|url=http://www.adweek.com/galleycat/what-did-j-r-r-tolkien-read/37585|title=What Did J.R.R. Tolkien Read?|work=GalleyCat|date=18 August 2011|accessdate=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===J. R. R. Tolkien===
{{anchor|Subcreation}}{{anchor|Tolkien}}
{{further|Tolkien's legendarium|Mythopoeia (poem)}}
[[J. R. R. Tolkien]] wrote a poem titled ''[[Mythopoeia (poem)|Mythopoeia]]''  following a discussion on the night of 19 September 1931 at [[Magdalen College, Oxford]] with [[C. S. Lewis]] and [[Hugo Dyson]] in order to explain and defend creative myth-making.&lt;ref name=adcox/&gt;
The poem refers to the creative human author as "the little maker" wielding his "own small golden sceptre" ruling his "subcreation" (understood as genuine creation within [[God]]'s primary [[Creation myth|creation]]).
 
[[Tolkien's legendarium]] includes not only [[origin myth]]s, [[creation myth]]s and an [[epic poetry]] cycle, but also fictive [[linguistics]], [[geology]] and [[geography]].

Tolkien discusses his views on myth-making, "subcreation"  and "[[faery]]" in the essay ''[[On Fairy-Stories]]'', written in 1939 for presentation by Tolkien at the [[Andrew Lang lecture]] at the [[University of St Andrews]] and published in print in 1947. At about the same time, he addressed the same topics in the form of a short story, ''[[Leaf by Niggle]]''. ''[[Smith of Wootton Major]]'' (1967), a novella designed to explain the theme of "faery".

In ''On Fairy-Stories'', Tolkien emphasizes the importance of [[language]] (the human linguistic faculty in general as well as the specifics of the language used in a given tradition):
{{quote|Mythology is not a disease at all, though it may like all human things become diseased. You might as well say that thinking is a disease of the mind. It would be more near the truth to say that languages, especially modern European languages, are a disease of mythology. But Language cannot, all the same, be dismissed. The incarnate mind, the tongue, and the tale are in our world coeval. The human mind, endowed with the powers of generalization and abstraction, sees not only green-grass, discriminating it from other things (and finding it fair to look upon), but sees that it is green as well as being grass. But how powerful, how stimulating to the very faculty that produced it, was the invention of the adjective: no spell or incantation in Faerie is more potent. And that is not surprising: such incantations might indeed be said to be only another view of adjectives, a part of speech in a mythical grammar. The mind that thought of light, heavy, grey, yellow, still, swift, also conceived of magic that would make heavy things light and able to fly, turn grey lead into yellow gold, and the still rock into a swift water. If it could do the one, it could do the other; it inevitably did both. When we can take green from grass, blue from heaven, and red from blood, we have already an enchanter's power—upon one plane; and the desire to wield that power in the world external to our minds awakes. It does not follow that we shall use that power well upon any plane. We may put a deadly green upon a man’s face and produce a horror; we may make the rare and terrible blue moon to shine; or we may cause woods to spring with silver leaves and rams to wear fleeces of gold, and put hot fire into the belly of the cold worm. But in such "fantasy," as it is called, new form is made; Faerie begins; Man becomes a sub-creator.}}

===C. S. Lewis===
At the time that Tolkien debated the usefulness of myth and mythopoeia with C. S. Lewis in 1931, Lewis was a [[theist]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvard citation|Lewis|1946|pp=66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- note: theist and not atheist: [[C. S. Lewis]] states he converted in "the Trinity Term of 1929" and converted to Christianity in 1931 --&gt; and liked but was skeptical of [[mythology]], taking the position that myths were "lies and therefore worthless, even though 'breathed through silver{{'"}}.&lt;ref name=adcox/&gt;&lt;ref name="menion"&gt;Menion, 2003/2004 citing essays by Tolkien using the words "fundamental things".&lt;/ref&gt; However Lewis later began to speak of Christianity as the one "true myth". Lewis wrote, "The story of Christ is simply a true myth: a myth working on us in the same way as the others, but with this tremendous difference that it really happened."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/athens/forum/3505/LewisJoy.html|title=Real Joy and True Myth|first=Dave|last=Brown|work=Geocities.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091026222931/http://www.geocities.com/athens/forum/3505/LewisJoy.html|archivedate=26 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, his ''[[Chronicles of Narnia]]'' is regarded as mythopoeia, with storylines referencing that Christian mythology, namely the narrative of a great [[king]] who is sacrificed to save his people and is resurrected.
Lewis's mythopoeic intent is often confused with allegory, where the characters and world of Narnia would stand in direct equivalence with concepts and events from Christian theology and history, but Lewis repeatedly emphasized that an allegorical reading misses the point (the mythopoeia) of the Narnia stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abate|first1=Michelle Ann|last2=Weldy|first2=Lance|title=C.S. Lewis|date=2012|publisher=Palgrave|location=London|isbn=9781137284976|page=131|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wi8dBQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA131&amp;ots=ySqExtF1f0&amp;dq=I%20don%E2%80%99t%20say.%20%E2%80%98Let%20us%20represent%20Christ%20as%20Aslan.%E2%80%99%20I%20say%2C%20%E2%80%98Supposing%20there%20was%20a%20world%20like%20Narnia%2C%20and%20supposing%2C%20like%20ours%2C%20it%20needed%20redemption%2C%20let%20us%20imagine%20what%20sort%20of%20Incarnation%20and%20Passion%20and%20Resurrection%20Christ%20would%20have%20there&amp;pg=PA131#v=onepage&amp;q=I%20don%E2%80%99t%20say.%20%E2%80%98Let%20us%20represent%20Christ%20as%20Aslan.%E2%80%99%20I%20say,%20%E2%80%98Supposing%20there%20was%20a%20world%20like%20Narnia,%20and%20supposing,%20like%20ours,%20it%20needed%20redemption,%20let%20us%20imagine%20what%20sort%20of%20Incarnation%20and%20Passion%20and%20Resurrection%20Christ%20would%20have%20there&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[C. S. Lewis]] also created a mythopoeia in his neo-medieval representation of extra-planetary travel and planetary "bodies" in the Cosmic or [[Space Trilogy]].

===William Blake===
{{main|William Blake's mythology}}
[[File:Spectre over Los from William Blake's Jeruesalem.jpg|thumb|250px|Because William Blake worked in multiple artistic mediums, printing and illustrating extensive [[art books]], [[William Blake's mythology|his own extensive mythological community]] is both written about and illustrated. Here, [[Los (Blake)|Los]] is tormented at his smithy by the characteristic part of human nature [[Spectre (Blake)|Spectre]] in an illustration to Blake's poem [[Jerusalem: The Emanation of the Giant Albion|''Jerusalem'']]. This image comes from Copy E. of that work, printed in 1821 and in the collection of the [[Yale Center for British Art]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.blakearchive.org/exist/blake/archive/object.xq?objectid=jerusalem.e.illbk.06&amp;java=no|title = Copy Information for Jerusalem The Emanation of The Giant Albion | publisher = [[William Blake Archive]]| accessdate = Sep 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Object description for "Jerusalem The Emanation of The Giant Albion, copy E, object 15 (Bentley 15, Erdman 15, Keynes 15)"| publisher = [[William Blake Archive]]|url = http://www.blakearchive.org/exist/blake/archive/illusdesc.xq?objectid=jerusalem.e.illbk.06&amp;objectdbi=jerusalem.e.p6|editor1=Morris Eaves |editor2=Robert N. Essick |editor3=Joseph Viscomi |accessdate= September 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[William Blake]]'s "prophetic works" (e.g. ''[[Vala, or The Four Zoas]]'') contain a [[William Blake's mythology|rich panoply]] of original gods, such as [[Urizen]], [[Orc (William Blake)|Orc]], [[Los (Blake)|Los]], [[Albion (Blake)|Albion]], [[Rintrah]], [[Ahania]] and [[Enitharmon]]. Blake was an important influence on [[Aleister Crowley]]'s [[Thelema|Thelemic]] writings, whose dazzling pantheon of 'Godforms' and radically re-cast figures from [[Egyptian mythology]] and the [[Book of Revelation]] constitute an allegorical mythology of their own.

===Collaborative efforts===
The [[Cthulhu Mythos]] of [[H. P. Lovecraft]] was likewise taken up by numerous collaborators and admirers.

Current attempts to produce a new mythology through collaborative means include the movement known as New or [[Metamodernism|Metamodern]] Classicism. According to its website, metamodern classicism seeks to create "a vast, collaborative cultural project, uniting Painters, Poets, Musicians, Architects, and all Artists in one mythopoeic endeavor. Our goal is none other than a living mythological tradition: interactive, dynamic, evolving—and relevant."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newclassicism.weebly.com/about.html|title=Metamodern Classicism|work=weebly.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other modern literature===
Stories by [[George MacDonald]] and [[H. Rider Haggard]] are in this category. C. S. Lewis praised both for their "mythopoeic" gifts.&lt;ref&gt;Lobdell, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[T. S. Eliot]]'s ''[[The Waste Land]]'' (1922) was a deliberate attempt to model a 20th-century mythology patterned after the birth-rebirth motif described by Frazer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oser|first=Lee|date=Winter 1996|title=Eliot, Frazer, and the Mythology of Modernism|url=|journal=The Southern Review|volume=32:1|pages=183|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The repeated motifs of [[Jorge Luis Borges]]'s fictional works ([[mirror]]s, [[labyrinths]], [[tiger]]s, etc.) tantalizingly hint at a deeper underlying [[mythos]] and yet stealthily hold back from any overt presentation of it.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

The [[pulp magazine|pulp]] works of [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] (from 1912) and [[Robert E. Howard]] (from 1924) contain imagined worlds vast enough to be universes in themselves,{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} as did the [[science fiction]] of [[E. E. "Doc" Smith]], [[Frank Herbert]], and [[Michael Moorcock]] one or two generations later.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

[[Fritz Leiber]] (from the 1930s) also created a vast world, similar to that of [[Robert E. Howard]]'s; vast enough to be a universe, and indeed was a fictional [[Multiverse|omniverse]]. It is stated that the two main protagonists, [[Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser]] "travelled through universes and lands" and eventually going on to say they ended up back in the fictional city of Lankhmar.

[[Star Maker]] (1937) by [[Olaf Stapledon]] is a rare attempt at a cohesive science fiction mythos.

In the 1960s through the 1990s, [[Roger Zelazny]] authored many mythopoetic novels, such as [[Lord of Light]]. Zelazny's [[Chronicles of Amber]] is a ten-volume series of particular note for its mythic and metaphysical themes. Zelazny cited the [[World of Tiers]] series by [[Philip Jose Farmer]] as an influence.&lt;ref&gt;"...And Call Me Roger": The Literary Life of Roger Zelazny, Part 2, by Christopher S. Kovacs. In: The Collected Stories of Roger Zelazny, Volume 2: Power &amp; Light, NESFA Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Greg Stafford]] created the world and attendant mythology of [[Glorantha]] (from 1975), which formed the basis for a role-playing game (see [[Runequest]] and [[HeroQuest (role-playing game)|Heroquest]]), though its literary scope far exceeds its genre.{{clarify|date=June 2013}}

[[Stephen King]]'s novels and short stories form an intricate and highly developed [[mythos]], drawing in part on the Lovecraftian, with characters such as the demonic [[Crimson King]] and [[Randall Flagg]] appearing in several (otherwise unrelated) works, as well as a supernatural force known only as "The White". ''[[The Dark Tower (series)|The Dark Tower]]'' series serves as a linchpin for this mythos, connecting with practically all of King's various storylines in one way or another.

[[J. K. Rowling]]'s ''[[Harry Potter]]'' book series, as well as the [[Harry Potter (film series)|series of films]] adapted from her work, exist within a mythopoetic [[Harry Potter universe|universe]] Rowling created by combining elements from various mythologies with her own original fantasy.

[[Rick Riordan]]'s ''[[Camp Half-Blood chronicles]]'', which include three pentological book series, ''[[Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians]]'', ''[[The Heroes of Olympus]]'' and ''[[The Trials of Apollo]]'' series, as well as [[Camp Half-Blood chronicles|their film adaptations]], exist within a mythopoetic recreation of the ancient [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology|Roman]] mythologies and chronicles the lives of modern American-born, Graeco-Roman demigods and their interactions with Gods. His other mythopoetic works, ''[[The Kane Chronicles]]'' and ''[[Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard]]'' are also similar except the fact that they revolve around [[Egyptian mythology|Egyptian]] and [[Norse mythology|Norse]] mythologies. Riordan's works amalgamate elements of day-to-day life of teenagers like [[coming of age]], [[ADHD]], [[love]] and teenage [[angst]] into modern interpretations of Egyptian and Graeco-Roman mythologies and his own fantasy.

The novels of [[Neil Gaiman]], especially ''[[Neverwhere]]'', ''[[American Gods]]'' and ''[[Anansi Boys]]'', function similarly.

[[Phillip Pullman]] created an alternate version of the Judeo-Christian mythology in ''[[His Dark Materials]]'', and its sequel series ''[[The Book of Dust]]'', where the Angels have more or less created a facade to fool the mortals.

[[The Elder Scrolls]] and its associated literature present a world where mythic visions of the world have mystical power, where archetypal myths are seen as playing out over and over again throughout history, where one can take on the identity of another by assuming ("mantling") the place that other has as a figure in the mythology of the world, and where the creation of myths can be seen as an act of mystically rewriting reality.

Indian author [[Amish Tripathi]]'s [[Amish Tripathi|''Shiva'' trilogy]] and its prequel series, [[Amish Tripathi|''Ram Chandra'' series]] chronicle the life and exloits of Hindu Gods, [[Shiva]] and [[Rama]] recast as Great, historical human figures. It carefully blends traditional Indian characters into a mythopoetic recreation of the original tale.&lt;ref name="IJELLH, April 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ezhil|first1=Thogai|title=IJELLH, April 2014– Myth Maker|journal=International Journal of English Language, Literature and Humanities|date=April 2014|volume= 2|issue= 1|pages=377–385|issn =2321-7065|url=http://ijellh.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Modernising-the-Indian-Myths-Amish-Tripathi%E2%80%99sShiva-Trilogy-By-Thogai-Ezhil.pdf|accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tripathi|first1=Amish|title=Shiva-Trilogy|url=http://www.authoramish.com/|website=authoramish.com|accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trend of "myth retelling" was initiated by [[South Indian]] veteran, M. T. Vasudevan Nair, whose [[Malayalam|Malayalam language]] classic, ''[[Randamoozham]]'', and its many translations (including "''The Lone Warrior''" in English) follow a similar pattern of plot-crafting. Other works like [[Shivaji Sawant]]'s ''Mrityunjaya'' and ''Yugandhar'', [[Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni]]'s ''[[The Palace of Illusions: A Novel|The Palace of Illusions]]'', [[Anand Neelakantan]]'s ''[[Asura: Tale of the Vanquished]]'', [[Ashok Banker]] and [[Devdutt Pattanaik]]'s various retellings and [[Krishna Udayasankar]]'s ''Aryavarta Chronicles'' have also followed this lead.

==Modern usage==
{{further|Worldbuilding|Fictional universe}}Frank McConnell, author of ''Storytelling and Mythmaking'' and professor of English, [[University of California]], stated film is another "mythmaking" art, stating: "Film and literature matter as much as they do because they are versions of mythmaking."&lt;ref&gt;McConnell 1979:6&lt;/ref&gt; He also thinks film is a perfect vehicle for mythmaking: "FILM...strives toward the fulfillment of its own projected reality in an ideally associative, personal world."&lt;ref&gt;McConnell 1979:5, 99: "film is a perfect model of the epic paradigm: the founder of the land, the man who walls in and defines the human space of a given culture..."&lt;/ref&gt; In a broad analysis, McConnell associates the American [[western movie]]s and romance movies to the [[Arthurian]] mythology,&lt;ref&gt;McConnell 1979:15.&lt;/ref&gt; adventure and action movies to the "[[epic poetry|epic world]]" mythologies of founding societies,&lt;ref&gt;McConnell 1979:21.&lt;/ref&gt; and many romance movies where the hero is allegorically playing the role of a knight, to "quest" mythologies like ''[[Sir Gawain]]'' and the ''[[Holy Grail|Quest for the Holy Grail]]''.&lt;ref&gt;McConnell 1979:13, 83–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

Filmmaker [[George Lucas]] speaks of the cinematic storyline of ''[[Star Wars]]'' as an example of modern myth-making. In 1999 he told [[Bill Moyers]], "With ''Star Wars'' I consciously set about to re-create myths and the classic mythological motifs."&lt;ref&gt;Hart, 2002. Evidently quoting Moyers quoting Lucas in ''Time'', 26 April 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of ''Star Wars'' as "mythological" has been met with mixed reviews. On the one hand, Frank McConnell says "it has passed, quicker than anyone could have imagined, from the status of film to that of legitimate and deeply embedded popular mythology."&lt;ref&gt;McConnell, 1979:18.&lt;/ref&gt; John Lyden, the Professor and Chair of the Religion Department at Dana College, argues that ''Star Wars'' does indeed reproduce religious and mythical themes; specifically, he argues that the work is [[apocalypticism|apocalyptic]] in concept and scope.&lt;ref&gt;Lyden, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Steven D. Greydanus of ''The Decent Film Guide'' agrees, calling ''Star Wars'' a "work of epic mythopoeia".&lt;ref name="greydanus"&gt;Greydanus 2000–2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Greydanus argues that ''Star Wars'' is ''the'' primary example of American mythopoeia:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Force, the Jedi knights, Darth Vader, Obi-Wan, Princess Leia, Yoda, lightsabers, and the Death Star hold a place in the collective imagination of countless Americans that can only be described as mythic. In my review of ''A New Hope'' I called ''Star Wars'' 'the quintessential American mythology,' an American take on [[King Arthur]], Tolkien, and the samurai/wuxia epics of the East&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name=greydanus/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Roger Ebert]] has observed regarding ''Star Wars'', "It is not by accident that George Lucas worked with Joseph Campbell, an expert on the world's basic myths, in fashioning a screenplay that owes much to man's oldest stories."&lt;ref&gt;Hart, 2002. Quoting Ebert on ''Star Wars'' in his series ''The Great Movies''.&lt;/ref&gt;
The "mythical" aspects of the Star Wars franchise have been challenged by other film critics. Regarding claims by Lucas himself, Steven Hart observes that Lucas didn't mention [[Joseph Campbell]] at the time of the original ''Star Wars''; evidently they met only in the 1980s. Their mutual admiration "did wonders for [Campbell's] visibility" and obscured the tracks of Lucas in the "despised genre" science fiction; "''the epics'' make for an infinitely classier set of influences".&lt;ref&gt;Hart 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Mythos of the Superheroes and the Mythos of the Saints'',&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Thomas, ''The Mythos of the Superheroes and the Mythos of the Saints''&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Roberts observes that:&lt;blockquote&gt;
"To the student of myth, the mythos of the [[comics superheroes]] is of unique interest."&lt;br /&gt;"Why do human beings want myths and how do they make them? Some of the answers to those questions can be found only sixty years back. Where did Superman and the other superheroes come from? In his Encyclopedia of the Superheroes, Jeff Rovin correctly observes, "In the earliest days, we called them 'gods'."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Superman]], for example, sent from the "heavens" by his father to save humanity, is a messiah-type of character in the [[Bible|Biblical]] tradition.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Knowles (comics)|KNOWLES, Christopher]], ''[[Our Gods Wear Spandex]]'', Weiser, pp. 120–2&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, along with the rest of [[DC Comic]]'s [[Justice League of America]], Superman watches over humanity from the [[Watchtower]] in the skies; just like the [[List of Greek mythological figures|Greek gods]] do from [[Mount Olympus]].&lt;ref&gt;''International Journal of Comic Art'', [[University of Michigan]], pp. 280&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Jack Kirby's Fourth World]]" series, with the cosmic struggle between [[Darkseid]]'s [[Apokolips]] and the gods of [[New Genesis]] and [[Mister Miracle]] and Orion as [[messiah]]-figures is another good example. [[Neil Gaiman]]'s ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|Sandman]]'' series created a mythology around [[Endless (comics)|the Endless]], a family of god-like embodiments of natural forces like [[death]] and [[dream]]ing.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==In music==
In classical music, [[Richard Wagner]]'s operas were a deliberate attempt to create a new kind of ''Gesamtkunstwerk'' ("total work of art"), transforming the legends of the Teutonic past nearly out of recognition into a new monument to the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] project.

In popular music, [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]]'s [[Parliament (band)|Parliament]]-[[Funkadelic]] collective produced numerous [[concept album]]s which tied together in what is referred to as [[P-Funk mythology]].

While ostensibly known for improvised jamming, the rock group [[Phish]] first cemented as a group while producing leading member [[Trey Anastasio]]'s senior project in college, called ''The Man Who Stepped into Yesterday''. The song cycle features narration of major events in a mythical land called [[Gamehendge]], containing types of imaginary creatures and primarily populated by a race called the "Lizards". It is essentially a postmodern pastiche, drawing from Anastasio's interest in musicals or rock operas as much as from reading philosophy and fiction.&lt;ref&gt;Puterbaugh, Parke. Phish: The Biography. Philadelphia: Da Capo Press, 65–67. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of the myth is considered by many fans the thesis statement of the group, musically and philosophically, as Gamehendge's book of lost secrets (called the "Helping Friendly Book") is summarized as an encouragement to improvisation in any part of life: "the trick was to surrender to the flow."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phish.net/song/the-lizards/lyrics|title=Phish.Net: The Lizards Lyrics|work=phish.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[musical collective]] NewVillager constructed a mythology from Joseph Campell's [[Monomyth]] of which all their music, art, and videos serve to express.

The band [[Rhapsody of Fire]] have created and tell the stories of a full-developed fantasy world with tales of epic wars between good and evil, although many elements are taken directly from Tolkien and other authors.

The black metal band [[Immortal (band)|Immortal's]] lyricist [[Harald Nævdal]] has created a mythological realm called [[Blashyrkh]] – described by the band as a northern "Frostdemon" realm&lt;ref&gt;{{ Cite web|url=http://www.chroniclesofchaos.com/articles.aspx?id=1-223|title=CoC : Immortal : Interview : 5/19/1999|access-date=2018-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; – filled with demons, battles, winter landscapes, woods, and darkness which is the primary subject on their albums. A mythology forming a greater whole that has been in development from the start of their career in 1991.

'''''Of Love and Other Demons''''' (Spanish: '''''Del amor y otros demonios''''') is a novel by [[Colombia]]n author [[Gabriel García Márquez]], first published in 1994.

In the prologue, García Márquez claims the novel is the fictional representation of a legend the author was told by his grandmother as a child: of a 12-year-old girl who contracts rabies but was believed to be a 'miracle-worker', with long flowing copper hair that continues to grow after death. In this frame-story, it was only after an excavation of tombs that García Márquez is witness to the grave of a similar young girl with long red hair still attached to the skull, that he was inspired to write ''Of Love and Other Demons''.

Mariana Solanet, however, in ''García Márquez for Beginners'', states this source was invented. She points rather to a story in [[Daniel Lemaitre]]'s ''History of Cartagena'' that García Márquez came across in research for ''[[Love in the Time of Cholera]]''.

In 2008, the opera ''[[Love and Other Demons]]'', by [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] composer [[Péter Eötvös]] was premiered at the [[Glyndebourne Festival Opera|Glyndebourne Festival]].

==Plot==
;Sierva Maria de Todos Los Angeles
The twelve-year-old daughter of the Marquis and his wife Bernarda. Her hair has never been cut, and was promised to the saints when she was born with the umbilical cord around her neck. She was raised by the slaves, fluent in multiple African languages, and familiar with the customs. In the beginning of the book she is bit by a rabid dog. Even though she shows no signs of rabies, she is subject to multiple "healing" methods, which can be considered torture. She is sent to the convent of Santa Clara to receive an exorcism, which many people have died from. She receives attention from a priest, Father Cayetano, who is kind to her and initially believes she doesn't need to be exorcised. Father Cayetano falls in love with Sierva Maria and declares her his love; he soon begins visiting Sierva in her cell in secret, climbing up from the sewer (that in future is fixed). They eat, sleep, and recite poetry together, even though it doesn't appear that they are sexually involved. Later Father Cayetano is sent away to a leper hospital where he hopes to get the disease but never does. Sierva Maria in the meantime is last summoned to be exorcised and she eventually dies 'of love' wondering where Father Cayetano is and after having her hair cut. After her death her hair magically grows back on her skull.

'''Pakefield''' is a suburb of the town of [[Lowestoft]] in the [[Waveney District|Waveney]] district of the [[England|English]] county of [[Suffolk]]. Pakefield is located around {{convert|2|mi|km}} south of the centre of the town. Although today it forms a suburb of the urban area of Lowestoft, it was until 1934 a village and parish in its own right.&lt;ref name="suffolkchurchsas"&gt;[http://www.suffolkchurches.co.uk/pakefieldas.html The Suffolk Churches site].

Retrieved 2009-11-25.&lt;/ref&gt; Pakefield lies along the [[North Sea]] coast. The former parish church, All Saints and St Margarets, is located on the coast.&lt;ref name="suffolkchurchsas" /&gt;

Pakefield became a site of national archaeological importance in 2005 when flint tools over 700,000 years old were unearthed. This was the oldest evidence of human occupation anywhere in the UK, until flint tools at least 800,000 years old were discovered further up the coast at [[Happisburgh]] in 2010.

Pakefield has boundaries with [[Carlton Colville]] and [[Kirkley]], both also districts or suburbs of [[Lowestoft]]. It forms the southern boundary of the [[Lowestoft]] urban area with [[Kessingland]] about {{convert|2+1/2|mi|km}} to the south.

==History==
Pakefield is the site of one of the earliest known areas of human habitation in the United Kingdom. In 2005 flint tools and teeth from the water vole ''Mimomys savini'', a key dating species, were found in the cliffs. This suggests that hominins can be dated in England to 700,000 years ago, potentially a cross between ''[[Homo antecessor]]'' and ''[[Homo heidelbergensis]]''.&lt;ref name="nature1"&gt;Parfitt.S et al (2005) 'The earliest record of human activity in northern Europe', ''Nature'' 438 pp.1008-1012, 2005-12-15.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4124">A '''patakí''' is a brief story used in [[Santería]] and [[Ifá]].

==Definition==
“Oral narratives of the Lucumí faith, religious stories [are] known to practitioners as patakís.”&lt;ref name=Lele&gt;Lele, Ócháni. ''Diloggún Tales of the Natural World: How the Moon Fooled the Sun, and Other Santería Stories''. Rochester, Vt: Destiny Books, 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|viii}}  A patakí can be likened to a Christian parable. Santería initiates use the short fables to teach and illustrate a moral lesson to followers. The patakí is passed down orally through generations of Santería initiates. “Some patakís narrate the birth or death of an [[Orisha]] in human form. Others deal with relationships between Orishas.”&lt;ref name=Duncan&gt;Duncan, Cynthia. Personal Interview. 15 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; These stories offer advice to followers on how to deal with life’s issues. The patakís also serve as creation stories on how the natural world came into being. The moral lessons of the patakí have a range of themes, such as respecting your elders, how to be humble and grateful for what you have, not underestimating your enemy, knowing who is your friend and who is not. Patakís are written in an artful narrative style. They are usually set in an ancient time when the Orishas were still in human form. Patakís are “part of this enormous mine of oral lucumí literature”.&lt;ref&gt;Dianteill, Erwan, and Martha Swearingen. "From Hierography to Ethnography and Back: Lydia Cabrera's Texts and the Written Tradition in Afro-Cuban Religions." Journal of American Folklore. 116.461 (2003). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7}}

==Oral tradition==
“Most [[babalawo|babaaláwo]]s are experts on the patakís and memorize a large corpus of them, although it is impossible to say how many patakís exist in an oral tradition that spans centuries. Some Santeros/as are also familiar with the patakís, but it is not a requirement for Santeros/as to memorize the stories in order to practice the religion. Where the patakí fits into this system is unique, because they are taught in Ilés and depending on the Ilé the same patakí might have slight variation. Newly initiated Babaaláwos are taught patakís and other secrets of the religion by Padrinos and for their first years study quite intensely. Aside from libretas, which are private religious notebooks used for passing down rituals and traditions, there is a slight distrust for things written in a book.&lt;ref name=Lele /&gt;

==Understanding the patakí==
Interpretation and use of patakí text by babaaláwos is based on a system of [[Ifá#Odù Ifá|Odu]]. The original oral literature is kept intact but was applied to the marginality the Afro-Cuban faced in the New World.&lt;ref name=Lele /&gt; The esoteric nature in which the patakí is situated also allows for hidden meaning in the ‘writings’. Patakís may be written in libretas but many are memorized from oral transmission.

There are many discrepancies on pronunciations, and written forms of some of the Yoruba words in Lucumí literature. Many words are [[Spanish language|Spanish.]] Because there is no standard format, many versions of words and some variation on the practices exist. "The existence of the word as something usable in utterances presupposes a collective understanding of its existence."&lt;ref name=Agha&gt;{{cite journal|last=Agha|first=Asif|title=The Social Life of Cultural Value|journal=Language &amp; Communication|year=2003|volume=23|issue=3|pages=231–273|doi=10.1016/s0271-5309(03)00012-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|245}} The entire religious community has acknowledged the practices, traditions and words of Santería and other divination elements such as the patakí and therefore it has become legitimate collective knowledge. The transculturation that created Santería and many other Afro-Cuban traditions has become a part of national identity. What is most important about the patakí is that the original idea, or moral of the story remain intact through translation and interpretation.&lt;ref name="Duncan" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7852">'''Public float''' or '''free float''' represents the portion of [[Share (finance)|shares]] of a [[corporation]] that are in the hands of public investors as opposed to locked-in stock held by promoters, company officers, controlling-interest investors, or government. This number is sometimes seen as a better way of calculating [[market capitalization]] because it provides a more accurate reflection (than entire market capitalization) of what public investors consider the company to be worth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/freefloatmethodology.asp |title=Free-Float Methodology |publisher=investopedia |accessdate=June 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this context, the ''float'' may refer to all the [[shares outstanding]] that can be publicly traded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investorwords.com/3936/public_float.html|title=What is Public Float? definition and meaning|author=|date=|website=InvestorWords.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Calculating public float ==
The float is calculated by subtracting the locked-in shares from outstanding shares. For example, a company may have 10 million outstanding shares, with 3 million of them in a locked-in position; this company's float would be 7 million. Stocks with smaller floats tend to be more [[Volatility (finance)|volatile]] than those with larger floats. In general, the large holdings of founding shareholders, corporate cross-holdings, and government holdings in partially [[privatized]] companies are excluded when calculating the size of a public float.

== Process of public floatation==
There are certain regulations to offer public floats, though these regulations might differ from region to region.

For instance to offer public float in the UK, a company must be incorporated, i.e. be a public limited liability company under UK law. Also, the company should have published or filed audit accounts for at least a three-year period, have trading and revenue earning records for at least three years, its higher management and directors must be competent enough to run a business at that scale, and the company must show that it has a working capital for at least 12 months. Moreover, once the company is listed, the business must be independent from any shareholder with controlling interest (anyone owning more than 30% of the company shares), and after the company is listed, at least 25% of its shares must be in the hands of general public, that is public float, and the company must have a total market capitalization of not less than £700,000.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|last1=London Stock Exchange|title=A practical guide to listing|url=http://www.londonstockexchange.com/companies-and-advisors/listing/float/practical-guide-to-listing.pdf|publisher=London Stock Exchange}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages of public floating ==

===Greater access to funds===

By public floating, companies gain access to new and large capital as general public can invest in the company making it easy for the company to get capital.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|website=Ernst and Young|title=EY's guide to going public|url=http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/Ernst_and_Young_guide_to_going_public/$FILE/Guide_to_Going_Public.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new capital is then used to increase company's profits &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/facebook/9273583/Facebook-valued-at-104bn-on-record-breaking-stock-market-debut.html|title=Facebook valued at $104bn on record-breaking stock market debut|first=Katherine|last=Rushton|date=17 May 2012|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opportunities to reduce debt ===

By public floating company gains access to interest free capital as there is no interest to be paid on shares. Though dividend is involved but terms of dividend are far more flexible than terms for loans.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Along with this shares are not considered as a debt and by public floating companies can reduce their debts creating a better asset liability ratio.

===Enhancement of credibility and higher public profile===

By public floating companies can enhance their credit image.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; As banks and other credit providing institutions provide credit more often to a public limited company along with this sometimes favorable terms are also offered by credit providers because of public limited company status. Along with enhanced credibility companies can also get higher media coverage and attention of general public.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== Disadvantages of public floating ==

===Company is open to market fluctuations===

By public floating companies are vulnerable to threats of speculations and market fluctuations. During the 2008 financial crisis several companies went bankrupt because of fluctuations in the stock market severely limiting their operating capital to the extent that they were unable to pay their creditors and were forced to liquidate their operational assets.

===Costs of public flotation===

Costs of company registration are also very high making it difficult for certain small businesses to public float. Along with higher costs processes of registering and running a company are also very complex.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite web|website=Gov.uk|title=Running a limited company|url=https://www.gov.uk/running-a-limited-company/company-and-accounting-records}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the UK, in order to run a public limited company, a register of the directors, shareholders, and any shareholder votes, as well as all details of the company's finances must be compiled and kept for a minimum of six years. Along with this a comprehensive accounting record is also needed like sales and whom they are made to (until and unless it is a retail business), Purchases and from whom they are done stock and debts all of them are necessary to be provided.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; Along with all these costs, taxes are also to be paid while a company is public floating. For instance in the UK a company has to pay corporation tax which is 20% if the profit per year is £300,000 or less and 21% if profit is above £300,000.

===Pressure to perform===

Public floating also increases pressure on a company to perform. Whenever the general public, as company shareholders, demand dividends without keeping the company's economic circumstances in proper perspective, it increases performance pressure on the company.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Secondly, sometimes companies provide false financial reports to sell shares which lead towards further complications in market. In 2005, AIG had to pay a fine of $1.7 billion as a result of improper accounting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=CNN|title=Greenberg settles AIG charges for $15 million|url=http://money.cnn.com/2009/08/06/news/companies/Greenberg_SEC/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Lehman Brothers went bankrupt in 2008 after using a small firm to secretly manipulate its balance sheets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wolff|first1=Richard|title=Lehman Brothers financially and morally bankrupt|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/dec/12/lehman-brothers-bankrupt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both cases illustrate that, as a result of pressure to sell shares, companies may manipulate their financial statements, and later face the consequences (Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy in 2008, AIG's bailout by the U.S government in 2008).

===Less public float===

Less public float may cause illiquidity of stocks of companies due to the low public holdings. One may not be able to transact buy or sell orders on a respected stock exchange.

'''Regional cuisine''' is [[cuisine]] based upon national, state or local regions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/region "Region."] (Definition). [http://www.merriam-webster.com Merriam-Webster dictionary].

Rosenbaum, p. 305&lt;/ref&gt;

==Touchscreen keyboards==

As of 2015, there were diverse claims regarding the fastest typing in [[smartphone]]s and other [[touchscreen]] devices with [[virtual keyboard|on-screen keyboards]]. The typical [[yardstick]] is writing, with no [[Typographical error|mistakes]], the 160-character text:

:''The razor-toothed [[piranha]]s of the genera [[Serrasalmus]] and [[Pygocentrus]] are the most ferocious [[freshwater fish]] in the world. In reality they seldom attack a [[human]].''

A disputed issue is whether [[Autocorrection|auto-correct]] and [[Predictive text|predictive features]] should be allowed. Common sense indicates that they shouldn't, because when typing the record phrase several times the phone [[Machine learning|learns the text]]. Speed depends, then, on the phrase being repeated, a poor indicator of performance for everyday use. In the extreme, the phone could learn to predict "Serrasalmus" when typing just "Ser", but that would be extremely uncomfortable in normal circumstances ("[[wikt:ser|ser]]" is the Spanish word for "[[Be (verb)|being]]"). In fact, [[Guinness World Records]] establishes that "To qualify for the record, no autocorrect or predictive text features are allowed to remain on".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/corporate/2014/5/fastest-touch-screen-text-message-record-officially-broken-with-fleksy-keyboard-57380-57388 Fastest touch-screen text message record officially broken with Fleksy keyboard]&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2010, [[Samsung]] posted a 35.54-second record with predictive texting, but no actual [[footage]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAh-FqEizi4 Guinness World Record for Texting Challenge]&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, [[Swype]], a predictive keyboard for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] where users swipe their fingers across the keyboard to enter one word per stroke, claimed a record of 25.94 seconds, but with prediction features on.&lt;ref&gt;[http://phandroid.com/2010/08/24/text-message-speed-record-broken-thanks-to-swype-on-the-samsung-galaxy-s/ Text Message Speed Record Broken Thanks to Swype on the Samsung Galaxy S]&lt;/ref&gt; A [[YouTube]] user later claimed to have set a 21.8-second record on an [[iPhone]], but the posted video clearly showed autocorrect enabled and correcting at least four mistakes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVXyVzLjKag Text messaging world record? I beat that (less than 21.8 seconds)!]&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014, in the midst of a publicity campaign for [[Windows Phone 8.1]], [[Microsoft Research]] published a new record of 18.44 seconds, also with predictive features on.&lt;ref&gt;[http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/news/features/wordflow-040414.aspx Microsoft Brings World’s Fastest Texting to Windows Phone 8.1]&lt;/ref&gt; This record, obviously dependent on pre-learning by the keyboard's memory, became the object of mockery on the web.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_lXTtMa2xg&lt;/ref&gt; It was broken the next month when a time of 18.19 seconds was alleged by Brazilian youngster Marcel Fernandes Filho using the [[Flesky]] mobile keyboard on an Android phone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2014/5/fastest-touch-screen-text-message-record-officially-broken-with-fleksy-keyboard-57380/ Fastest touch-screen text message record officially broken with Fleksy keyboard]&lt;/ref&gt; While the firm claimed it was without autocorrection, video footage clearly contradicted this (e.g., the letter "B" was pressed when writing "genera"); furthermore, only a portion of the complete taping was displayed. This alleged record was admitted by Guinness in spite of violating its own rules of having the autocorrect feature off. Also, a [[dash]] (crucial for the record) appeared in the main keyboard, which was never a part of Fleksy's main screen. Thus, questions arose as to whether Guinness had been object of a [[misinformation]] scheme or even a party in it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.exideas.com/ME/GamesAndContests.php How were the Guinness People Duped?]&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2014, Fleksy claimed Mr Fernandes Filho had broken his own record on a larger phone, but later removed the video.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fleksy.com/dropping-price-breaking-world-records/ We’re dropping price, and breaking world records (again)!]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, TipType, a [[WYSIWYG|What-You-Type-Is-What-You-Get]] keyboard with a QWERTY layout but based on sliding movements rather than pressing (similar to Swype), launched a speed contest for phones of traditional size. The company posted a 25-second record with a [[Samsung Galaxy S3 mini]] on YouTube and promised [[USD]] 500 to anyone bettering that record on a touchscreen of size 4.5" or less, subject to Guinness World Records rules.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6S_5fquM7E TipType Challenge, march 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Female Brain''''' is a 2006 book by the American [[neuropsychiatrist]] [[Louann Brizendine]]. The main thesis of the book is that women's behavior is different from that of men due, in large measure, to [[hormone|hormonal]] differences. Brizendine says that the human female brain is affected by the following hormones: [[estrogen]], [[progesterone]], [[testosterone]], ([[oxytocin]]), [[neurotransmitters]] ([[dopamine]], [[serotonin]]), and that there are differences in the architecture of the [[brain]] (prefrontal [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]], [[hypothalamus]], [[amygdala]]) that regulates such hormones and [[neurotransmitter]]s.

==Structure==
''The Female Brain'' has seven chapters, each one of which is dedicated to a specific part of a woman's life such as [[puberty]], motherhood, and [[menopause]], or a specific dimension of a women’s emotional life such as feelings, [[love]] and [[trust (social sciences)|trust]], and [[sex]]. The book also includes three appendices on [[hormone therapy]], [[postpartum depression]], and [[sexual orientation]].

== Reception ==
The book sold well but received mixed reviews, because there was some controversy from feminist writers about the validity of some of the content. Some of the authors that supported the content of the book include:
* [[Deborah Tannen]], of the ''[[The Washington Post]]''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/18/AR2006081800429_pf.html 'A Brain of One's Own'.] ''[[The Washington Post]]'' August 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Tannen writes, "Throughout the book, I recognized biological accounts for social behaviors I had observed and written about." In a similar vein, she adds, "Anthropologists and linguists who have studied children at play have noted that girls form bonds by telling secrets. Here, too, Brizendine finds 'a biological reason.'" Her ultimate position is one of cautionary endorsement: "Ideally, readers will sift through the case studies, research findings and scientific conjectures gathered in this non-technical book and be intrigued by some while questioning others, bearing in mind the caution that hormones and brain structure play a role in gender differences but are not the whole story." 
* [[Sarah Hrdy]], author of ''Mother Nature''
* [[Daniel Goleman]] author of ''[[Emotional Intelligence]]''

Some of the authors that criticized the content of the book include:
* [[Evan Balaban]] and [[Rebecca M. Young]], in a review in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Young | first1 = Rebecca M. | last2 = Balaban | first2 = Evan | title = Psychoneuroindoctrinology | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 443 | issue = 7112 | page = 634 | publisher = [[Nature Publishing Group]] | doi = 10.1038/443634a | date = 12 October 2006 | url = https://doi.org/10.1038/443634a | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v443/n7112/pdf/443634a.pdf Pdf.]
:Evan Balaban and Rebecca M. Young called ''The Female Brain'' a "melodrama" "riddled with scientific errors" and "fail[ing] to meet even the most basic standards of scientific accuracy and balance" and that "human sex differences are elevated almost to the point of creating different species, yet virtually all differences in brain structure, and most differences in behaviour, are characterized by small average differences and a great deal of male–female overlap at the individual level".&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic [[feminist]]s have given mixed reviews to ''The Female Brain''. Brizendine was given the tongue-in-cheek 2006 [[Language Log|Becky Award]], which is given to "people or organizations who have made outstanding contributions to linguistic misinformation".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.languagehat.com/archives/002602.php 2006 Becky Award]&lt;/ref&gt; The award cited errors in ''The Female Brain'', including one sentence (removed from subsequent printings) which contrasted the number of words used by men and women in one day. The numbers had been taken from a book by a self-help guru and were incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/~nunberg/beckies.html The Language of Eve]", Geoffrey Nunberg, January 3, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

== Response to criticisms ==
Brizendine later made some concessions to those who felt that this book overemphasised gender-based differences, saying: "Males and females are more alike than they are different. After all, we are the same species".&lt;ref name=calmag&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tugend|first1=Alina|title=Engendering Sons|journal=[[California (magazine)|California]]|issue=Winter 2014|pages=48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Female Brain'' was loosely adapted as a romantic comedy movie of the same name in 2017.

'''''The Happytime Murders''''' is a 2018 American [[black comedy]] [[crime film]] directed by [[Brian Henson]] and written by [[Todd Berger]]. The film stars [[Melissa McCarthy]], [[Maya Rudolph]], [[Joel McHale]], [[Elizabeth Banks]], and [[Bill Barretta]]. The plot, set in a world where puppets and humans co-exist, follows a joint police force who must solve a recent murder spree of retired sitcom stars.

The film was first announced in 2008 by [[The Jim Henson Company]], the production studio of [[The Muppets|Muppets]] creator [[Jim Henson]]. Various actors, including [[Cameron Diaz]], [[Katherine Heigl]], and [[Jamie Foxx]], were approached to star before McCarthy signed on in May 2017. Filming began in [[Los Angeles]] that September, and involved the use of over 120 puppets. The release marks the film debut of Henson Alternative, a banner of The Jim Henson Company that specializes in adult content. 

''The Happytime Murders'' was released on August 24, 2018, by [[STX Entertainment|STXfilms]]. It received generally negative reviews from critics and was a [[Box-office bomb|box office bomb]], grossing only $27.5 million worldwide against a total of its $87 million budget.

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. --&gt;
In a world where puppets coexist with humans but are treated as [[second-class citizens]], Phil Phillips was the first puppet cop on the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] (LAPD) before being fired. Now a private detective with a human secretary Bubbles, he is hired by puppet client Sandra to find out who has been blackmailing her. Phil investigates a lead at a puppet-owned porn shop and while he goes in the back to check their records an attacker kills everyone present, including Bumblypants, a cast member of “The Happytime Gang”, a puppet sitcom that was due to go into syndication.

The LAPD arrive and Phil meets up with his former partner, Detective Connie Edwards. Twelve years prior, Edwards was being held at gunpoint by a puppet criminal. Phil tried to shoot him but missed and hit an innocent puppet, killing him in front of the puppet's young daughter. Edwards and the thug exchanged fire; Edwards was wounded but the thug was killed. Edwards received a puppet liver transplant which left her with an addiction to sugar which is like heroin to puppets. Edwards testified against Phil and a law was enacted preventing puppets from being cops.

Back in the present, Edwards believes it was a robbery gone wrong but Phil believes it was murder. That night Phil’s brother Larry "Shenanigans" Phillips, former Happytime cast-member, is torn apart when someone lets dogs into his house. Phil reluctantly teams up with Edwards to find the killer.

The two track down former Happytime cast member Lyle only for him to be killed in a drive-by shooting in front of Phil. Phil goes to see Jenny, the only human Happytime cast member and his former girlfriend, at a puppet strip club where she works. Phil is unable to protect her when her car explodes apparently killing her. The police see Phil leaving the scene and believe him to be responsible for the murders.

Phil hides out at Edwards' apartment and they discover that homeless sugar addict and former Happytime member Goofer has apparently overdosed and drowned. They go the house of the two remaining Happytime Gang members Ezra and Cara only to find their mangled bodies. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) shows up and Phil and Edwards are detained.

Phil is shown Sandra in an interrogation room. She reveals that she and Jenny are married and claims Phil killed Jenny and the others, to keep Sandra for himself.

Edwards is suspended from duty, and finds Bubbles to ask for help proving Phil's innocence. They break into Sandra's place and come across a hidden room with plans for the deaths of the Happytime Gang and a conspiracy against Phil. Edwards notices a picture of the puppet who Phil accidentally shot years ago and realizes that Sandra is his daughter, and that she is out for revenge against Phil. Bubbles sees a tape recorder and presses the play button, which ignites a fire destroying all the evidence. Edwards breaks Phil out of jail to stop Sandra.

Phil and Edwards get to the airport where Sandra is planning to escape with all the royalty money. Phil apologizes for killing her father, saying it has haunted him all the years since, and asks why the Happytime Gang had to die. Sandra says she wanted Phil to suffer as payback. It turns out that Jenny is alive, having faked her death, and is in cahoots with Sandra, but Sandra knocks Jenny out to take the money for herself after Philips reveals her true history. Sandra holds Edwards at gunpoint, putting her and Phil in the same position as twelve years before. Phil takes his shot and doesn't miss this time, killing Sandra.

Banning arrives to congratulate Phil and Edwards on cracking the case. He restores Edwards to active duty and convinces the mayor to lift the ban on puppet cops, welcoming Phil back on the force. Phil asks Bubbles out on a date, and she accepts.

[[Principal photography]] on the film began in [[Los Angeles, California]] on September 11, 2017.&lt;ref name="BanksCast" /&gt; The film had a production budget in the range of $40–47 million, with McCarthy getting paid between $10–17.5 million.&lt;ref name=opening/&gt;

There are a total of 125 puppets in the film, with 40 created specifically for it.&lt;ref name="TriviaFacts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/what-is-the-happytime-murders/ |title=‘The Happytime Murders': 25 Things to Know about the Long-Developing R-Rated Puppet Movie|first=Christina|last=Radish|date=July 12, 2018|work=[[Collider (website)|Collider]]|publisher=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex Media]]|accessdate=August 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; To accommodate the puppeteers, all of the sets were built up so that the puppeteers could stand on the floor, since their optimum way to operate the puppets is if they are standing with straight arms. Because the floor of the sets came up in pieces, the human actors had a two-foot margin to stay on their path.&lt;ref name="TriviaFacts"/&gt; Visual effects supervisor Sam Nicholson said the film had many VFX challenges, specifiyng, "It’s some of the most complex work that we’ve ever done because, in one shot you could have a combination of principal photography done at 8K and then puppets on greenscreen being puppeteered by four puppeteers for each puppet. So if you have, say, six puppets in a scene, you’ve got 24 puppeteers operating them, and these are all people dressed in green suits. And then you have all the rod removal of those puppets, and then you have avatars or CG puppets that are standing right next to the real puppets."&lt;ref name="VFXVoice"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vfxvoice.com/the-puppet-masters-behind-the-happytime-murders/ |title=The Puppet Masters Behind THE HAPPYTIME MURDERS|first=Ian|last=Failes|date=September 4, 2018|work=VFXVoice.com|accessdate=September 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical response===
{{expand section|date=August 2018}}
On review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 23% based on 216 reviews, with an average rating of 3.8/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "''The Happytime Murders'' wastes its intriguingly transgressive premise on a witless comedy that blindly pushes buttons instead of attempting to tell an entertaining story."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_happytime_murders_2017|title=The Happytime Murders (2018)|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|accessdate=December 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a weighted average score of 27 out of 100, based on 48 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-happytime-murders|title=The Happytime Murders Reviews|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|work=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=August 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "C–" on an A+ to F scale, the lowest of McCarthy's career as a lead, while [[PostTrak]] reported filmgoers gave it an "awful" 58% overall positive score.&lt;ref name=opening/&gt; 

Sarah Melton from ''[[Exclaim!]]'' gave the film a rating of 2/10, saying, "''The Happytime Murders'' hardly feels like a fitting extension of Henson's muppet legacy. Not because it's thoroughly vulgar and dirty, but because that's all it is."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Melton |first1=Sarah |title='The Happytime Murders' Offers Viewers a Very Unhappy Time |url=https://exclaim.ca/film/article/the_happytime_murders_offers_viewers_a_very_unhappy_time-directed_by_brian_henson |work=[[Exclaim!]] |accessdate=August 23, 2018 |date=August 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jess Fenton for ''Switch'' wrote "...I adored the concept, I loved the cast, the fact that this was directed by Jim Henson’s son made me giddy, and yet... I did not like this movie. Hate is too strong a word, however I was deeply disappointed, underwhelmed, my sides were left unsplit."&lt;ref name="SWITCH."&gt;{{cite web|title=Film review: The Happytime Murders - Filthy felt|url=https://www.maketheswitch.com.au/article/review-the-happytime-murders-filthy-felt|work=SWITCH.|accessdate=September 3, 2018|date=August 23, 2018|first=Jess |last=Fenton|publisher=Midnight Productions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawsuit==
In May 2018, [[Sesame Workshop]], the organization behind the production of the television series ''[[Sesame Street]]'', filed a lawsuit against STX Productions for using their trademark in a film they have no involvement with, including the tagline "No Sesame, all Street". They alleged that associating a children’s program with an adult comedy would smear the former's reputation as well as confuse individuals. In response, STX issued a statement indicating their persistence to keep the marketing for the film unchanged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://variety.com/2018/film/news/sesame-street-stx-happytime-murders-1202822955/ |first=Ricardo |last=Lopez |date=May 25, 2018 | title = ‘Sesame Street’ Creators Sue STX Entertainment Over Marketing for ‘The Happytime Murders’ |publisher=[[Penske Business Media]]|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=August 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sesame Street sues over violent, puppet-based Happytime Murders film |date=May 26, 2018 |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-44263925 |publisher=[[BBC]] |work=[[BBC News]] | access-date=May 27, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 30, 2018, the lawsuit was rejected by the presiding judge for the case, with STX issuing a brief statement soon thereafter: {{Quote|“We fluffing love ''Sesame Street'' and we're obviously very pleased that the ruling reinforced what STX's intention was from the very beginning — to honor the heritage of [[The Jim Henson Company]]'s previous award-winning creations while drawing a clear distinction between any [[The Muppets|Muppets]] or ''Sesame Street'' characters and the new world Brian Henson and team created. We believe we accomplished that with the very straightforward NO SESAME, ALL STREET tagline. We look forward to continued happytimes as we prepare to release ''Happytime Murders'' this summer.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://deadline.com/2018/05/happytime-murders-lawsuit-sesame-street-melissa-mccarthy-stx-1202398325/ |title=‘Happytime Murders’ Lawsuit: Judge Kicks ‘Sesame Street’ Bosses’ Grouchy Case To The Curb|first1=Dominic |last1=Patten |first2=Erik |last2=Pedersen|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|publisher=[[Penske Business Media]]|date=May 30, 2018|accessdate=May 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some subsequent television spots for the film made references to the lawsuit by starting the ads with "From the studio that was sued by ''Sesame Street''...".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NSFW Happytime Murders Trailer Gets Dirty and Depraved with Puppets|url=https://movieweb.com/happytime-murders-trailer-2-red-band/|website=[[MovieWeb]]|publisher=Watchr Media|first=Kevin |last=Burwick|accessdate=August 23, 2018|date=August 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Sacred Order of Saint Dumas''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|s|æ|n|d|uː|ˈ|m|ɑː}} {{respell|SAN|doo|MAH}}) is a fictional group in the mythos of [[DC Comics|DC Comic's]] [[Batman]]. Created by writer [[Dennis O'Neil]] and introduced in the first issue of the ''Sword of Azrael'' arc, the Order is a deviant faction of the [[Knights Templar]] from which the mantle of [[Azrael (comics)|Azrael]] originates.

==Publication History==
The Order of Saint Dumas first appeared in ''Batman: Sword of Azrael'' #1 and were created by [[Dennis O'Neil]].

==Fictional History==
The Order of Saint Dumas was originally a part of the [[Knights Templar]], a group of warrior-monks that were formed during the [[Crusades]] originally to protect pilgrims journeying to the Holy Land, and who grew quite powerful before being disbanded. The members of the Order had a falling out with the other Templars and formed their own group, named for their leader Dumas ("who nobody else has ever accused of being a Saint"). The centuries-old villain [[Ra's al Ghul]] once had "an adventure" with Dumas, and Ra's later described the founder of the Order as "...[a] vicious man, an insane fanatic."&lt;ref name="Manhunter28"&gt;''Manhunter'' vol. 3 #28&lt;/ref&gt; The Order eventually stole Ra's al Ghul's Wheel of Plagues which contains a record of biological weapons.&lt;ref&gt;[[Batman: Legacy]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Ra's al Ghul himself also took their precious battle armor called the Suit of Sorrows to pass as a family heirloom.&lt;ref&gt;''Detective Comics'' #842&lt;/ref&gt;

The Order of Saint Dumas enriched itself during the Crusades and then went into hiding. It devoted itself to the teachings of Dumas. The order's first champion was an Asian man named Stephen Forrest Lee, the assassin known to [[Manhunter (comics)#Mark Shaw|Mark Shaw]] as Dumas. The failure of this champion splintered the Order of Saint Dumas.&lt;ref name="Manhunter28"/&gt;

===Splinter Branches===
The main branch retreated and the violent splinter elements created a new champion called [[Azrael (comics)|Azrael]], a hereditary title given to the splinter order's near-superhuman enforcer and assassin. Members of the splinter order enlarged the organization's power by killing their enemies, hoarding knowledge and kidnapping some of the greatest thinkers in the world. The order also spread [[disinformation]] to ensure that the theories of the kidnapped geniuses would look so silly that nobody would miss them or examine their research. A recent Azrael named [[Azrael (comics)|Jean-Paul Valley]] eventually destroyed the splinter group.&lt;ref name="Manhunter28" /&gt;

In ''Detective Comics'' #842, it is revealed that there is another splinter faction called the Order of Purity.

===A New Champion===
The main branch of the Order of Saint Dumas recruited former Manhunter [[Manhunter (comics)#Mark Shaw|Mark Shaw]] to be their new champion.&lt;ref name="Manhunter28" /&gt;

==Known Members==
* '''Brother Rollo''' - Head of the Order of St. Dumas.
* '''Brother Umberto'''
* '''Brother Zoo''' - A member of the Order of St. Dumas who created the genetically-altered beasts in their possession.
* '''Daniel Maris'''
* '''[[Azrael (comics)|Jean-Paul Valley]]'''
* '''Ludovic Valley''' - The father of Jean-Paul Valley who was his predecessor in the Azrael mantle.
* '''[[Azrael (comics)|Michael Lane]]'''
* '''Nomoz''' - A dwarf who was created by the Order of St. Dumas.
* '''Sister Lilhy'''
* '''Gray Abbott''' - scientist who creates the Azraels

==In Other Media==
===Television===
The Order of St. Dumas appears in Season 2 of ''[[Gotham (TV series)|Gotham]]''. They are depicted as a religious sect founded by the patron saint of the Dumas family centuries earlier. When Caleb Dumas is falsely accused for sexual assault by Celestine Wayne, Jonathan Wayne used a knife to cut off Caleb's right hand. Afterwards, the Dumas family is discredited for their role in the founding of the city where most of them took refuge with the Order of St. Dumas in Europe while the remaining ones in Gotham City had their last names changed to '''Galavan'''. Centuries later, the Order of St. Dumas begins to enact their elaborate plan to atone for the actions of the Wayne family, and destroy and rebuild Gotham. They pull strings so that Caleb's descendant Theo Galavan ([[James Frain]]) becomes the mayor of Gotham City. Upon gaining public trust, Galavan carries out the plan by framing [[Penguin (comics)|Oswald Cobblepot]] for his crimes, obtaining the knife used on Caleb Dumas and giving it to an elite member named Father Creel ([[Ron Rifkin]]), and kidnapping [[Batman|Bruce Wayne]] so that the Order of St. Dumas members can sacrifice Wayne. Before Father Creel can sacrifice the boy using the same knife that was used on Caleb Dumas, [[James Gordon (Gotham)|James Gordon]], Oswald Cobblepot and Cobblepot's gang, interrupt the ceremony and save Wayne. During a confrontation, all of the members of the Order of St. Dumas that were present were killed in the ensuing battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Rise of the Villains: Worse Than a Crime|series=Gotham (TV series)|serieslink=Gotham (TV series)|network=Fox|airdate= November 30, 2015|season=2|number=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the season, Galavan is resurrected by Hugo Strange ([[BD Wong]]) as the villain [[Azrael (comics)|Azrael]].

===Video Games===
* The Sacred Order of St. Dumas is mentioned in ''[[Batman: Arkham City]]''. It had long wanted to be the guiding force against crime and corruption in Gotham City. When news came that Batman was rumored to be currently in Arkham City, the Order of St. Dumas jumped at the opportunity. Sending Azrael out to earn Batman's trust, the Order provided the Dark Knight with a cryptic message that would come true 9 months later.
* The Sacred Order of St. Dumas is mentioned in ''[[Batman: Arkham Knight]]''. On the night of Scarecrow's revenge amongst all the chaos caused by him and [[Jason Todd|Arkham Knight]], the Order of St. Dumas finally decided to make their move. They sent Azrael to trick Batman and kill him so that they could take his place. Growing suspicious of Azrael and the Order's motives, Batman discovered the truth of their motives when the Order has planted a microchip in his brain to influence his actions. This leads to a confrontation at Oracle's Clock Tower with two different outcomes: 
:: If Azrael chooses to kill Batman, he attacks the hero with the Sword of Sin, but is subdued by Batman and taken to the Gotham City Police Department where he is incarcerated alongside [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]]'s co-conspirators. Lane reveals himself to be a religious zealot, completely in line with the Order of St. Dumas's creed, claiming evil has flourished under Batman's tenure and he must die so that divine justice can save the city. Azrael develops an animosity toward [[Deacon Blackfire]] as both of them consider themselves to be God's rightful representative.
:: If Azrael chooses to spare Batman, he enters the elevator to leave the Clock Tower either immediately or after picking up and breaking his own sword (it seemed to have some kind of control over him). Proud, Batman shakes his hand after he enters the elevator telling Lane that he made the right choice. Azrael explains that he only follows the will of God and not the manipulations of man while also stating that the Order of St. Dumas will answer for their crimes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2648">'''The Setters''' was a collaborative musical project between [[rock-n-roll]] songwriters [[Walter Salas-Humara]] of [[the Silos]], [[Alejandro Escovedo]] of [[True Believers (band)|True Believers]], and [[Michael Hall (musician)|Michael Hall]] of the [[Wild Seeds]]. The band originated when Hall told a music festival he wanted to play at that he was in a band with Salas-Humara and Escovedo. Hall came up with the band name "The Setters" off the top of his head when the festival organizers asked him what the band's name was. Hall then called up Salas-Humara to ask him to perform with him at the festival, and Salas-Humara agreed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nodepression.com/article/walter-salas-humara-man-behind-silos-turns-his-radar-gun | title=Walter Salas-Humara - The man behind the Silos turns on his Radar gun | work=[[No Depression (magazine)|No Depression]] | date=31 October 1996 | accessdate=22 May 2017 | author=Fox, Randy}}&lt;/ref&gt; They released a single, self-titled album in 1993 on the German [[Blue Million Miles]] record label, and which was released the following year in the United States on [[Watermelon Records]].&lt;ref name=tp&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.trouserpress.com/entry.php?a=silos | title=The Silos | work=[[Trouser Press]] | accessdate=22 May 2017 | author=Schinder, Scott}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1994-05-13/entertainment/9405110665_1_salas-humara-alejandro-escovedo-true-believers | title=The Setters, The Silos, True Believers | work=[[Orlando Sentinel]] | date=13 May 1994 | accessdate=22 May 2017 | author=Gettelman, Parry}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album was produced by [[Gurf Morlix]], and featured performances by [[accordion]]ist [[Lisa Mednick]] and bassist [[Scott Garber]] ([[Giant Sand]]).&lt;ref name=tp/&gt; The tracks on the album are all new recordings of songs originally written by Salas-Humara, Escovedo, or Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/110214744/ | title=The Setters Review | work=[[Louisville Courier-Journal]] | date=28 May 1994 | accessdate=22 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brian Beatty gave the album 3 stars out of 5, writing, "Though there's no arguing with the quality of the songs here, most of them have appeared on albums much better than this one.

'''Visit My Mosque''' day is a national initiative facilitated by the [[Muslim Council of Britain]] (MCB), encouraging [[mosque]]s across the United Kingdom to hold mosque open days.

The Muslim Council of Britain is a representative Muslim [[umbrella organization]] with over 500 affiliated national, regional and local organisations, mosques, charities and schools

It runs annually and aims to encourage all mosques in the UK to host an open day at least once a year. Further aims include dispelling misconceptions about [[Islam]], making members of the British public more aware of their Muslim neighbours and increasing community cohesion in cities and towns across the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitmymosque.org|website=Official Website|title=Visit My Mosque}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting with about 20 mosques in 2015, it grew to over 80 mosques in 2016 and over 150 mosques in 2017. The 2017 event highlighted [[social action]] initiatives including feeding the homeless, blood donation drives, working with refugees and food collection drives for local food banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2017 Mosques Spotlights |publisher=Visit My Mosque |url=http://www.visitmymosque.org/find-my-mosque/2017-spotlights/ |accessdate=4 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;'Visit My Mosque day' in 2018 saw over 200 mosques take part in the initiative, under the theme 'Open Doors | Open Mosques | Open communities'. A [[YouGov]] poll, commissioned by the MCB found that 90% of Britons had not been inside a mosque in recent years. The poll also found that 70% of Britons have not been inside another faith’s place of worship.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|title=90% of people haven’t been inside a mosque|url=http://www.mcb.org.uk/90-of-people-havent-been-inside-a-mosque-change-that-this-weekend/|work=MCB |date=13 February 2018 |accessdate=9 May 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The theme was all about letting the local community know that they are welcome, whilst encouraging other places of worship to uphold an open door policy at least once a year also. Visit My Mosque day is reported widely in the national and international press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Harriet |last=Sherwood |title=Visit My Mosque day: British Muslims offer tours and tea to public|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/05/visit-my-mosque-day-muslims-offer-tours-and-tea-to-the-curious|work=[[The Guardian]] |date=5 February 2016 |accessdate=4 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Press Association |title=Mosques open doors to show unity 'at a tense time'|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-3436182/Mosques-open-doors-unity-tense-time.html|work=[[Daily Mail]] |date=7 February 2016 |accessdate=4 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Anealla |last=Safdar |title='Visit my mosque' day in UK bids to tackle Islamophobia|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/01/mosque-day-uk-bids-tackle-islamophobia-160130172406868.html|work=Al-Jazeera |date=30 January 2016 |accessdate=4 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Harun |last=Nasrullah |title='UK mosques take part in open day'|url=http://muslimnews.co.uk/newspaper/home-news/200-uk-mosques-take-part-open-day|work=[[The Muslim News]] |date= 29 March 2018 |accessdate=9 May 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Mosques from England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland take part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Joe |last=Smith |title=Mosques across Wales open their doors in bid to share 'positive message' of Islam |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/mosques-across-wales-open-doors-10854011|work=WalesOnline |date=7 February 2016 |accessdate=4 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Brian |last=Campbell |title=Belfast Islamic centre opens its doors to 'dispel myths' |url=http://www.irishnews.com/news/2016/02/08/news/belfast-islamic-centre-opens-its-doors-to-dispel-myths-about-islam-410239/|work=Irish News |date=8 February 2016 |accessdate=4 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many mosques in the United Kingdom hold open days or tours for neighbours, schools and members of the public regularly&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Liverpool Al-Rahma Masjid – Visits &amp; Tours |url=http://www.liverpoolmuslimsociety.org.uk/1/visits-tours }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shah Jahan Mosque – Education|url=https://www.shahjahanmosque.org.uk/education}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Visiting Southampton Medina Mosque|url=http://www.medinamosque.org.uk/tours.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Maidenhead Mosque - Visits &amp; Tours|url=http://www.maidenheadmosque.org/1/visits-tours}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many have open door policies. Visit My Mosque day is essentially an initiative whereby mosques time their open days to be on the same day of the year.
