'''Abell 223''' is a [[galaxy cluster]]. It is located at a distance of 2.4 billion light-years from [[Earth]].
The cluster is connected to nearby cluster Abell 222 by a filament of matter. Research has shown that only 20% of that matter is normal. The rest is thought to be dark matter.&lt;ref name=csmonitor&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2012/0705/Cosmic-scaffolding-uncovered-Scientists-find-thread-of-dark-matter |title=Cosmic scaffolding uncovered?

'''Amguid''' is a [[meteorite]] [[impact crater|crater]] in [[Algeria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Earth Impact DB | name = Amguid | accessdate = 2009-08-12 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

It is approximately {{convert|500|to|530|m|ft}} in diameter,&lt;ref name=wondermondo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wondermondo.com/Countries/Af/Algeria/Tamanghasset/AmguidCrater.htm|title=Amguid crater|publisher=Wondermondo}}&lt;/ref&gt; approximately 65 m deep and the age is estimated to be less than 100,000 years and is probably [[Pleistocene]]. The crater is exposed at the surface.

Crater was discovered by Europeans in 1948,&lt;ref name=wondermondo/&gt; first scientific description was made by Jean-Phillippe Lefranc in 1969.

'''Bary Glacier''' ({{Coord|54|26|S|36|47|W|source:GNIS|display=inline,title}}) is a [[glacier]] flowing west into [[Jacobsen Bight]], [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]], south of [[Christophersen Glacier]]. The glacier cuts through the longest sedimentary sequence on the [[island]], from Christophersen Glacier to [[Cape Darnley (South Georgia)|Cape Darnley]]. It was named by the [[UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee]] in 1982 after [[Thomas de Bary]], one of the first directors of the [[Compañía Argentina de Pesca]] from 1904.

{{see also|Baseball broadcasting firsts|1939 in baseball|1939 in television}}

On August 26,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insidesocal.com/tomhoffarth/archives/2009/08/70-years-ago-to.html 70 years ago today, the Dodgers made TV history]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsday.com/blogs/sports/watchdog-1.812020/major-league-baseball-made-tv-debut-70-years-ago-today-1.1395575 Major League Baseball made TV debut 70 years ago today]&lt;/ref&gt; the first ever Major League Baseball telecast (the [[1939 Brooklyn Dodgers season|Brooklyn Dodgers]] vs. [[1939 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds]] from [[Ebbets Field]]) aired by [[W2XBS]], an experimental station in New York City which would ultimately become [[WNBC-TV]].

[[Red Barber]] called the game without the benefit of a monitor and with only two cameras capturing the game. One camera was on Barber and the other was behind the plate. Barber had to guess from which light was on and where it pointed.

In [[1939 in baseball|1939]], baseball games were usually covered by one camera providing a point-of-view along the third base line.

===1949===
{{main|1949 in baseball|1949 in television}}

#Equipment: Three [[black-and-white]] cameras,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/playoffs/2008-10-26-1948-world-series_N.htm Walker said Red Barber was among the announcers to handle the play-by-play duties of the games in Boston and critics complained the cameras often didn't show the part of the action he was describing. A regular-season game typically used two or three cameras, Walker said, but that would increase to four for special events such as the Series. (Fox is using 26 cameras this year.)]&lt;/ref&gt; all located on the [[Mezzanine (architecture)|Mezzanine level]].
#Camera lenses: Fixed, no zoom capabilities.
#Replays: None

===1951===
{{main|1951 in baseball|1951 in television}}

On August 11, 1951, [[WCBS-TV]] in New York City televised the first baseball game (in which the [[1951 Boston Braves season|Boston Braves]] beat the [[1951 Brooklyn Dodgers season|Brooklyn Dodgers]] by the score of 8-1) in [[Television#color|color]].

On October 3 of that year, NBC aired the first [[East Coast of the United States|coast]]-to-[[West Coast of the United States|coast]] baseball telecast as the [[1951 Brooklyn Dodgers season|Brooklyn Dodgers]] were beaten by the [[1951 New York Giants (MLB) season|New York Giants]] in the final game of a [[playoff]] series by the score of 5-4 (off [[Bobby Thomson]]'s [[Shot Heard 'Round the World (baseball)|now-legendary home run]]).

===1953===
{{main|1953 in baseball|1953 in television}}

#Equipment: Four [[black-and-white]] cameras, all located on the [[Mezzanine level]].
#Camera lenses: Fixed, no zoom capabilities.
#Video: Quality of picture has improved since the 1940s.
#Replay: None
#Graphics: White-text containing one line of information.
#Audio: One microphone on the play-by-play announcer and one mic is suspended from the press box for crowd noise.

{{main|1957 in baseball|1957 in television}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insidesocal.com/tomhoffarth/archives/2009/01/when-scully-tal.html As Bob Costas mentions on the MLB Network show, the great part about watching this game now is there's no center field camera, no replays, no different angles, very few graphics (except to put the players names in all caps with white letters), the announcers work alone, there's maybe something missing without any close-ups of the players and no bullpen shots. For a black-and-white telecast, it's pretty stark.]&lt;/ref&gt;

#Camera lenses: Three fixed lenses on each camera that's manually rotated by a camera operator.
#Video: Quality of picture is a very sharp [[black-and-white]].
#Replays: None
#Graphics: White-text only; information about the balls and strikes are added.
#Broadcasters: Analysts added to broadcast alongside the play-by-play announcer.

{{main|1961 in baseball|1961 in television}}

#Equipment: Five cameras: Four on the [[Mezzanine level]] and one in center field.
#Camera lenses: Zoom capability existed albeit, limited.
#Video: [[Black-and-white]] picture quality has improved.
#Replays: Yes; regular speed; no longer than thirty seconds long at a line angle only.
#Graphics: White-text only including two lines of text.
#Audio: Improved - Audience can now hear the crack of the bat.

===1962===
{{main|1962 in baseball|1962 in television}}

On July 23, 1962, Major League Baseball had its first [[satellite]] telecast (via [[Telstar|Telstar Communications]]). The telecast included portion of a contest between the [[1962 Chicago Cubs season|Chicago Cubs]] vs. the [[1962 Philadelphia Phillies season|Philadelphia Phillies]] from [[Wrigley Field]] with [[Jack Brickhouse]] commentating on [[WGN-TV]].

===1969===
{{main|1969 in baseball|1969 in television}}

By [[1969 in television|1969]], the usage of [[chroma key]] (in which the commentators would open a telecast by standing in front of a [[greenscreen]] composite of the stadiums' crowds) became a common practice for baseball telecasts.

#Equipment: Five cameras: Four on the [[Mezzanine level]] and one in center field.
#Camera lenses: Zoom capability existed albeit, limited.
#Video: Color became an industry standard.
#Replays: Yes; regular speed; no longer than thirty seconds long at a line angle.
#Graphics: Electronic graphics introduced.
#Audio: Improved - Audience can now hear the crack of the bat.

===1974===
{{main|1974 in baseball|1974 in television}}

#Equipment: Seven cameras: One at first and third base each, one at home plate, one at center field, one at left field, and each in the dugout.
#Camera lenses: 18×1; the batter can now be seen from head to toe.
#Video: Color quality has improved since the 1960s.
#Replays: [[Slow motion|Slow-motion]] from all camera angles.
#Graphics: Video font with two color capabilities.
#Audio: [[Monaural|Mono.]] - much improved quality; an [[Sound effect|effect]] microphone is placed near the field.

===1975===
{{main|1975 in baseball|1975 in television}}

In the bottom of the 12th inning of Game 6 of the [[1975 World Series]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.si.com/mlb/2015/10/21/game-changer-carlton-fisk-nbc-1975-world-series?xid=si_social|title=Game Changer: How Carlton Fisk's home run altered baseball and TV|last1=Verducci|first1=Tom|last2= |first2= |date=October 21, 2015|website=Sports Illustrated|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Boston]]'s [[Fenway Park]], [[1975 Boston Red Sox season|Red Sox]] catcher [[Carlton Fisk]] was facing [[1975 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds]] pitcher [[Pat Darcy]]. Fisk then hit a pitch down the left field line that appeared to be heading to foul territory. The enduring image of Fisk jumping and waving the ball fair as he made his way to first base is arguably one of baseball's greatest moments. The ball struck the foul pole, giving the Red Sox a 7-6 win and forcing a seventh and deciding game of the Fall Classic. During this time, cameramen covering baseball games were instructed to follow the flight of the ball; reportedly, Fisk's reaction&lt;ref&gt;[http://66.218.69.11/search/cache?ei=UTF-8&amp;p=Mutual+Broadcasting+System+Major+League+Baseball&amp;fr=yfp-t-501&amp;u=www.baseball-fever.com/archive/index.php/t-17096.html&amp;w=mutual+broadcasting+system+systems+major+majors+league+baseball&amp;d=F82G8OdmPcCb&amp;icp=1&amp;.intl=us In 1975 baseball announced a new kind of TV deal. Coverage of the World Series, playoffs, and All-Star Games would alternate between NBC and ABC. The networks saw the advantages: postseason baseball play was the perfect time to begin promoting the new fall TV season. Dual network coverage also brought an element of competition without economic overtones-quality of coverage. Then came October 21, 1975. The Boston Red Sox, unable to win a World Series since 1918, were on their way to a loss in six games to Cincinnati's "Big Red Machine". But a three-run pinch-hit homer by Bernie Carbo tied the game in the eighth, and in the twelfth (by then it was 12:34 a.m.) Carlton Fisk hit a solo shot over the "Green Monster" to win the game. Sixty-two million people saw it, and television couldn't have planned it better, because as Fisk hit his homer, the camera in the left field scoreboard followed him, not the ball, and on replay the audience saw Fisk furiously trying to wave the ball fair. It was the first-ever home run reaction shot. The next night, 75,890,000 people watched the seventh game, and baseball was definitely back. In 1976 baseball received revenue from radio and television approaching $51 million. Lou Harris said in 1977, "For the first time since 1968, more sports fans in the country follow baseball than football." Ten years later baseball received $350 million.]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; was only being recorded because [[Major League Baseball on NBC|NBC]] cameraman Lou Gerard, positioned inside Fenway's scoreboard at the base of the left-field [[Green Monster]] wall, had become distracted by a large rat.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce Lowitt]], "Rats!

Unlike Fox, TBS did not bludgeon the audience with an overabundance of crowd shots or fan interviews. Much of the camera work was exceptional. The close-ups of insects feasting on the neck of Yankees reliever Joba Chamberlain were so creepy that they could have been filmed by Wes Craven. For the most part, TBS did a nice job of letting the pictures work for them. Some of the graphics proved problematic, though. As SI's Tom Verducci pointed out, the Leadoff Line, the nine-foot arrow that measured the lead a runner gets off first base, overtly gimmicky and intrusive. Some SI.com readers complained that the graphic at the top of the screen showing how many runners were on base was too small. (To its credit, Behnke said that TBS adjusted it prior to the final game of the Indians-Yankees series by deepening the border and edgings.) Look for the same graphics to return for the LCS -- the Leadoff Line is sponsored by Travelers, not that most fans would know -- including the addition of microphones placed in the bases. "It's always a work in progress and we are our own worst critics," said Behnke, who averaged four hours of sleep during the Division Series. "We have this package for many years but I would say this: We are overwhelmingly deeply proud of what we have done through the divisional series and I can assure you that it will only be better when we done through the divisional series and I can assure you that it will only be better when we crank it up on Thursday."]&lt;/ref&gt; debuted various new looks, such as the first live online views from cameras in dugouts and ones focused on pitchers. TBS also introduced a graphic that creates sort of a rainbow to trace the arc of pitches on game replays. The graphic was superimposed in the studio so analysts like [[Cal Ripken, Jr.]] for instance, could take virtual cuts at pitches thrown in games.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/sports/columnist/hiestand-tv/2007-10-01-hiestand-weekend_N.htm "He'll be standing at a home plate with a bat," Behnke says.

The technology for the camera originated with the U.S. military looking at replays of missile impacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hiestand: Costas' 12-year MLB playoff absence ends |author=Hiestand, Michael |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/columnist/hiestand-tv/2012/10/09/hiestand-nfl-mlb-playoffs/1622587/ |newspaper=USA Today |date=10 October 2012 |accessdate=10 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brett James Gladman''' (born 1966)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astro.ubc.ca/people/gladman/index.html Biography at Astro.ubc.ca]&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[astronomer]], discoverer of [[Natural satellite|moons]] and [[minor planet]]s, and a full professor at the [[University of British Columbia]]'s Department of Physics and Astronomy in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]]. He holds the [[Canada Research Chair]] in [[planetary astronomy]].&lt;ref name="springer-7638-Gladman" /&gt;

== Career ==

Gladman is best known for his work in dynamical astronomy in the Solar System. He has studied the
transport of meteorites between planets, the delivery of meteoroids from the main asteroid belt, and
the possibility of the transport of life via this mechanism, known as [[panspermia]]. He also studies planet formation, especially the puzzle of how the giant planets came to be.

He is discoverer or co-discoverer of many astronomical bodies in the [[Solar System]], asteroids, Kuiper Belt comets, and many [[natural satellite|moons]] of the giant planets:
* [[Uranus]]: [[Caliban (moon)|Caliban]], [[Sycorax (moon)|Sycorax]], [[Prospero (moon)|Prospero]], [[Setebos (moon)|Setebos]], [[Stephano (moon)|Stephano]], and [[Ferdinand (moon)|Ferdinand]]
* [[Saturn]]: A dozen satellites in several groups, each named after a theme of Canadian Inuit gods, French deities, and Norse gods
* [[Neptune]]: The satellite Neso
* [[Jupiter]]: Discovery and co-discovery of 6 moons

Gladman is a member of the [[Canada–France Ecliptic Plane Survey]] (CFEPS), and the [[Outer Solar System Origins Survey]] (OSSOS) which has detected and tracked the world's largest sample of well-understood Kuiper belt comets, including unusual objects like [[2004&amp;nbsp;XR190]] ("Buffy") and [[2008&amp;nbsp;KV42]] ("Drac"), the first trans-Neptunian object on a retrograde orbit around the Sun.

== Honors and awards ==

Gladman was awarded the [[H. C. Urey Prize]] by the Division of Planetary Sciences of the [[American Astronomical Society]] in 2002. The [[main-belt]] asteroid [[7638 Gladman]] is named in his honor.&lt;ref name="springer-7638-Gladman" /&gt;  During 2008–2011 he served as member and chair of the Science Advisory Council of the [[Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope]] on Mauna Kea in Hawaii.  He was awarded a [[Killam Research Fellowship]] in 2015.

'''Buy-side analysts''' ("buy-siders") work for [[buy side]] money management firms such as [[mutual fund]]s, [[pension fund]]s, [[Trust law|trusts]], and [[hedge fund]]s.  They are incentivised to identify investment opportunities that will improve the net worth of the portfolio they work for.

A buy-side analyst typically works in a mutual fund, pension fund, or other non-brokerage firm, and provides research and recommendations exclusively for the benefit of the company's own money managers (as opposed to individual investors). Unlike [[sell-side analyst|sell-side]] recommendations and reports&amp;mdash;which are meant for the analyst's brokerage firm's clients, and the broad outlines of which the press often widely disseminates&amp;mdash;buy-side recommendations are not available to anyone outside the firm. If the buy-side analyst stumbles upon a formula, vision, or approach that proves effective, it is kept secret.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3445">The '''Conference of Socialist Economists''' ('''CSE''') describes itself as an international, [[democracy|democratic]] membership organisation committed to developing a [[materialist]] critique of [[capitalism]], unconstrained by conventional academic divisions between subjects.

==History==
CSE's origins lie in the general upsurge in [[socialist]] politics in the United Kingdom in the 1960s spurred by disillusion with the [[Labour Party (United Kingdom)|Labour]] government of [[Harold Wilson]], and more specifically in a corresponding dissatisfaction with orthodox economic theory.

A first conference in January 1970 was attended by 75 people, mainly economists, who discussed papers on the [[capital controversy]], the state of [[development economics]], and the internationalisation of capital. A second conference in October of the same year attracted 125 participants (including 20 from abroad) and considered the economic role of the state in modern capitalism.

This event proved to be the founding conference, deciding to set up CSE as a permanent organisation, to organise a further conference on Britain and the EEC, and to investigate launching a journal. This further conference (December 1971) saw the launch of the ''Bulletin of the CSE'', with the first issue containing four of the conference papers. The ''Bulletin'' was succeeded in 1977 by a refereed journal, ''[[Capital &amp; Class]]'', which continues to be published.

Notwithstanding its name and history, both CSE and ''Capital &amp; Class'' live up to the declared aim of being unconstrained by conventional academic subject divisions. Probably only a minority of CSE members are professional economists, and the journal's contents range over the whole of the social and human sciences.

Common Sense was Journal of the Edinburgh Conference of Socialist Economists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://libcom.org/tags/common-sense|title=Common Sense|website=libcom.org|access-date=2016-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Coulomb's constant''', the '''electric force constant''', or the '''electrostatic constant''' (denoted {{math|''k''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''k''}} or {{math|''K''}}) is a [[proportionality constant]] in electrodynamics equations. In SI units, it is exactly equal to {{val|8987551787.3681764|u=N·m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·C&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, or roughly equaling {{val|8.99e9|u=N·m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·C&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. It was named after the French physicist [[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb]] (1736–1806) who introduced [[Coulomb's law]].

== Value of the constant ==
Coulomb's constant is the constant of proportionality in Coulomb's law,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = k_\text{e}\frac{Qq}{r^2}\mathbf{\hat{e}}_r&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|'''ê'''{{sub|''r''}}}} is a unit vector in the {{math|'''r'''}}-direction and

:&lt;math&gt;k_\text{e} = \alpha \frac{\hbar c}{e^2} &lt;/math&gt;,

where {{math|''α''}} is the [[fine-structure constant]], {{math|''c''}} is the [[speed of light]], {{math|''ħ''}} is the [[reduced Planck constant]], and {{math|''e''}} is [[elementary charge]].&lt;ref name="Tomilin1999"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Fine-structure constant and dimension analysis | author=Tomilin, K. | journal=[[European Journal of Physics]] | year=1999 | volume=20 | issue=5 | pages=L39–L40 | doi=10.1088/0143-0807/20/5/404|bibcode = 1999EJPh...20L..39T }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[SI]]: 
:&lt;math&gt; k_\text{e} = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt; \varepsilon_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[vacuum permittivity]].
This formula can be derived from [[Gauss' law]],

:{{oiint | intsubscpt = &lt;math&gt;{\scriptstyle S}&lt;/math&gt; | integrand=&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E} \cdot {\rm d}\mathbf{A} = \frac{Q}{\varepsilon_0}&lt;/math&gt;}}

Taking this integral for a sphere, radius {{math|'''r'''}}, around a point charge, we note that the electric field points radially outwards at all times and is normal to a differential surface element on the sphere, and is constant for all points equidistant from the point charge.

:{{oiint | intsubscpt = &lt;math&gt;{\scriptstyle S}&lt;/math&gt; | integrand=&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E} \cdot {\rm d}\mathbf{A} = |\mathbf{E}|\mathbf{\hat{e}}_r\int_{S} dA = |\mathbf{E}|\mathbf{\hat{e}}_r \times 4\pi r^{2}&lt;/math&gt;}}

Noting that {{math|1='''E''' = {{sfrac|'''F'''|''Q''}}}} for some test charge {{math|''q''}},

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathbf{F} &amp;= \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\frac{Qq}{r^2}\mathbf{\hat{e}}_r =  k_\text{e}\frac{Qq}{r^2}\mathbf{\hat{e}}_r \\[8pt]
\therefore k_\text{e} &amp;= \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

In modern systems of units Coulomb's constant {{math|''k''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;}} is an exact constant, in  [[Gaussian units]] {{math|1=''k''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; = 1}}, in [[Lorentz–Heaviside units]] (also called ''rationalized'') {{math|1=''k''{{sub|e}} = {{sfrac|4π}}}} and in [[SI]] {{math|''k''{{sub|e}} {{=}} {{sfrac|1|4π''ε''{{sub|0}}}}}}, where the [[vacuum permittivity]] {{math|1=''ε''{{sub|0}} = {{sfrac|1|''μ''{{sub|0}}''c''{{sup|2}}}} ≈}} {{val|8.85418782|e=-12|u=[[Farad|F]] m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, the [[speed of light in vacuum]] {{math|''c''}} is {{val|299792458|u=m/s}}, the [[vacuum permeability]] {{math|''μ''{{sub|0}}}} is {{nowrap|4{{pi}}{{e|-7}} [[Henry (unit)|H]] m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}},&lt;ref&gt;[http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?ep0 CODATA Value: electric constant].

\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

== Use of Coulomb's constant ==

Coulomb's constant is used in many electric equations, although it is sometimes expressed as the following product of the [[vacuum permittivity]] constant:
:&lt;math&gt;k_\text{e} = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}.&lt;/math&gt;

Coulomb's constant appears in many expressions including the following:

[[Coulomb's law]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}=k_\text{e}{Qq\over r^2}\mathbf{\hat{e}}_r.&lt;/math&gt;

[[Electric potential energy]]:
:&lt;math&gt; U_\text{E}(r) =  k_\text{e}\frac{Qq}{r}.&lt;/math&gt;

[[Electric field]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E} = k_\text{e} \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{Q_i}{r_i^2} \mathbf{\hat{r}}_i.&lt;/math&gt;

'''Cryotank''' or '''cryogenic tank''' is a tank that is used to store frozen biological material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/living/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2012/01/michigan_blood_reaches_milesto.html|title=Michigan Blood reaches milestone with delivery of donated umbilical cord blood |last=Kopenkoskey|first=Paul R. |date=2 January 2012|publisher=Michigan Live|accessdate=27 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term “cryotank” refers to storage of super-cold fuels, such as [[liquid oxygen]] and [[liquid hydrogen]]. Cryotanks and [[cryogenics]] can be seen in many sci-fi movies, but they are still currently undeveloped. All that needs to be done is for a human to be loaded into the tank and then they can be frozen until a time comes when any diseases they have can be cured and they can live an even longer life. This could also be used in space travel and just preserving human life in general.  The problem with this is when the human body is frozen, ice crystals form in the cells. The ice crystals then continue to expand rupturing the cell wall and destroying the integrity of the cell, or killing it.&lt;ref&gt;You put antifreeze inside your car, so even though outside, everything can be frozen solid, but inside your car liquids still flow normally and so your car still runs. In the same way, glucose is an [[antifreeze]] for frogs and certain fish that their bodies could still be in liquid form with blood circulating even though they are frozen solid on the outside.&lt;/ref&gt;

This means in order for humans to undergo the cryogenic process a way to significantly raise the levels of [[glucose]] produced in the human body is needed.

== Material Uses ==
[[Cryogenic]] tanks are used to store natural gases such as [[oxygen]], [[argon]], [[nitrogen]], [[helium]], and other materials. Tanks can store the materials at the correct temperature and pressure for transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prentex.com/cryogenic_vessels.php|title= Cryogenic Vessels | year = 2005| publisher= Prentex Alloy Fabricators Inc.| accessdate= 16 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/offices/oct/home/comp_cryotank.html|title= Technology| date = 31 October 2012| publisher= NASA| accessdate= 16 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In science fiction ===
{{Further|:Category:Cryonics in fiction}}
In science fiction, cryogenic tanks are used to freeze people. ''cry-'' is a Greek prefix which means "cold or freezing", hence humans are stored in the tank frozen until a future date.
Cryotanks are found in some science fiction films such as ''[[Prometheus (2012 film)|Prometheus]]'' (2012) and ''[[The Host (2013 film)|The Host]]'' (2013).

A '''DNA sequencer''' is a [[scientific instrument]] used to automate the [[DNA sequencing]] process.  Given a sample of [[DNA]], a DNA sequencer is used to determine the order of the four bases: G ([[guanine]]), C ([[cytosine]]), A ([[adenine]]) and T ([[thymine]]). This is then reported as a text [[String (computer science)|string]], called a read. Some DNA sequencers can be also considered [[optical instrument]]s as they analyze light signals originating from [[fluorochrome]]s attached to [[nucleotides]].

The first automated DNA sequencer, invented by [[Lloyd M. Smith]], was introduced by [[Applied Biosystems]] in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cook-Deegan|first1=Robert Mullan|title=Origins of the Human Genome Project|url=http://faculty.washington.edu/mccurdy/Project.doc|publisher=University of Washington|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It used the [[Sanger sequencing]] method, a technology which formed the basis of the “first generation” of DNA sequencers&lt;ref name=Metzker&gt;{{cite journal |author=Metzker, M. L. |title=Emerging technologies in DNA sequencing |journal=Genome Res. |volume=15 |issue=12 |pages=1767–1776 |year=2005 |pmid=16339375 |doi= 10.1101/gr.3770505}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hutchison, C.

Therefore, these sequencers can also be used in the [[genotyping]] of genetic markers where only the length of a DNA fragment(s) needs to be determined (e.g. [[microsatellite]]s, [[Amplified fragment length polymorphism|AFLPs]]).

The [[Human Genome Project]] catalysed the development of cheaper, high throughput and more accurate platforms known as [[Next-generation sequencing|Next Generation Sequencers]] (NGS) to sequence the [[human genome]]. These include the 454, [[ABI Solid Sequencing|SOLiD]] and [[Illumina (company)|Illumina]] DNA sequencing platforms. Next generation sequencing machines have increased the rate of DNA sequence substantially compared with previous Sanger methods. DNA samples can be prepared automatically in as little as 90 mins,&lt;ref name="a tale of three" /&gt; while a human genome can be sequenced at 15 times coverage in a matter of days.&lt;ref name="large genome centre"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Michael A.

More recent, third-generation  DNA sequencers such as [[Single Molecule Real Time Sequencing|SMRT]] and [[Nanopore sequencing|Oxford Nanopore]] measure the addition of nucleotides to a single DNA molecule in real time.

Because of limitations in DNA sequencer technology these reads are short compared to the length of a [[genome]] therefore the reads must be [[Sequence assembly|assembled]] into longer [[contig]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Heng Li, Jue Ruan, and Richard Durbin (2008) http://genome.cshlp.org/content/18/11/1851 Mapping short DNA sequencing reads and calling variants using mapping quality scores. Genome Research.&lt;/ref&gt; The data may also contain errors, caused by limitations in the DNA sequencing technique or by errors during [[PCR amplification]]. DNA sequencer manufacturers use a number of different methods to detect which DNA bases are present. The specific protocols applied in different sequencing platforms have an impact in the final data that is generated. Therefore, comparing data quality and cost across different technologies can be a daunting task. Each manufacturer provides their own ways to inform sequencing errors and scores. However, errors and scores between different platforms cannot always be compared directly. Since these systems rely on different DNA sequencing approaches, choosing the best DNA sequencer and method will typically depend on the experiment objectives and available budget.&lt;ref name="Metzker"/&gt;

==History==

The first [[DNA sequencing]] methods were developed by Gilbert (1973)&lt;ref name="Gilbert 1973"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gilbert W, Maxam A |title=The Nucleotide Sequence of the lac Operator |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A |volume=70 |issue=12 |pages=13581–3584 |year=1973 |pmc=427284 |pmid=4587255 |doi=10.1073/pnas.70.12.3581}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and Sanger (1975).&lt;ref name=Sanger75&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sanger F, Coulson AR |title=A rapid method for determining sequences in DNA by primed synthesis with DNA polymerase |journal=J. Mol. Biol. |volume=94 |issue=3 |pages=441–8 |date=May 1975 |pmid=1100841 |doi=10.1016/0022-2836(75)90213-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert introduced a sequencing method based on chemical modification of DNA followed by cleavage at specific bases whereas Sanger’s technique is based on [[dideoxynucleotide]] chain termination. The Sanger method became popular due to its increased efficiency and low radioactivity. The first automated DNA sequencer was the AB370A, introduced in 1986 by [[Applied Biosystems]]. The AB370A was able to sequence 96 samples simultaneously, 500 kilobases per day, and reaching read lengths up to 600 bases. This was the beginning of the “first generation” of DNA sequencers,&lt;ref name="Metzker"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hutchison, C. A. III. 2007 6227–6237"/&gt; which implemented Sanger sequencing, fluorescent dideoxy nucleotides and polyacrylamide gel sandwiched between glass plates - slab gels.  The next major advance was the release in 1995 of the AB310 which utilized a linear polymer in a capillary in place of the slab gel for DNA strand separation by electrophoresis. These techniques formed the base for the completion of the human genome project in 2001.&lt;ref name="F. S. Collins, M. Morgan, and A. Patrinos 2003 286–290"/&gt; The human genome project catalysed the development of cheaper, high throughput and more accurate platforms known as Next Generation Sequencers (NGS). In 2005, 454 Life Sciences released the 454 sequencer, followed by Solexa Genome Analyzer and SOLiD (Supported Oligo Ligation Detection) by Agencourt in 2006. Applied Biosystems acquired Agencourt in 2006, and in 2007, Roche bought 454 Life Sciences, while Illumina purchased Solexa. Ion Torrent entered the market in 2010 and was acquired by Life Technologies (now Thermo Fisher Scientific). These are still the most common NGS systems due to their competitive cost, accuracy, and performance.

More recently, a third generation of DNA sequencers was introduced. The sequencing methods applied by these sequencers do not require DNA amplification (polymerase chain reaction&amp;nbsp;– PCR), which speeds up the sample preparation before sequencing and reduces errors. In addition, sequencing data is collected from the reactions caused by the addition of nucleotides in the complementary strand in real time. Two companies introduced different approaches in their third-generation sequencers. Pacific Biosciences sequencers utilize a method called Single-molecule real-time (SMRT), where sequencing data is produced by light (captured by a camera) emitted when a nucleotide is added to the complementary strand by enzymes containing fluorescent dyes. Oxford Nanopore Technologies is another company developing third-generation sequencers using electronic systems based on nanopore sensing technologies.

==Manufacturers of DNA sequencers==

DNA sequencers have been developed, manufactured, and sold by the following companies, among others.

===Roche===
The 454 DNA sequencer was the first next-generation sequencer to become commercially successful.&lt;ref name="Comparison Next-Gen Seq"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lin Liu |author2=Yinhu Li |author3=Siliang Li |author4=Ni Hu |author5=Yimin He |author6=Ray Pong |author7=Danni Lin |author8=Lihua Lu |author9=Maggie Law |title = Comparison of Next-Generation Sequencing Systems|journal = Journal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology|volume = |issue = |pages = |pmid = |doi = |url = http://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2012/251364/}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed by 454 Life Sciences and purchased by Roche in 2007. 454 utilizes the detection of pyrophosphate released by the DNA polymerase reaction when adding a nucleotide to the template strain.

Roche currently manufactures two systems based on their pyrosequencing technology: the GS FLX+ and the GS Junior System.&lt;ref&gt;[http://454.com/products/index.asp Products : 454 Life Sciences, a Roche Company&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The GS FLX+ System promises read lengths of approximately 1000 base pairs while the GS Junior System promises 400 base pair reads.&lt;ref&gt;[http://454.com/products/gs-flx-system/index.asp Products - GS FLX+ System : 454 Life Sciences, a Roche Company&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://454.com/products/gs-junior-system/index.asp Products - GS Junior System : 454 Life Sciences, a Roche Company&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; A predecessor to GS FLX+, the 454 GS FLX Titanium system was released in 2008, achieving an output of 0.7G of data per run, with 99.9% accuracy after quality filter, and a read length of up to 700bp. In 2009, Roche launched the GS Junior, a bench top version of the 454 sequencer with read length up to 400bp, and simplified library preparation and data processing.

One of the advantages of 454 systems is their running speed, Manpower can be reduced with automation of library preparation and semi-automation of emulsion PCR. A disadvantage of the 454 system is that it is prone to errors when estimating the number of bases in a long string of identical nucleotides. This is referred to as a homopolymer error and occurs when there are 6 or more identical bases in row.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mardis|first=Elaine R.|title=Next-Generation DNA Sequencing Methods|journal=Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics|date=1 September 2008|volume=9|issue=1|pages=387–402|doi=10.1146/annurev.genom.9.081307.164359|pmid=18576944}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another disadvantage is that the price of reagents is relatively more expensive compared with other next-generation sequencers.

In 2013 Roche announced that they would be shutting down development of 454 technology and phasing out 454 machines completely in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.genomeweb.com/sequencing/roche-shutting-down-454-sequencing-business Roche Shutting Down 454 Sequencing Business&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bio-itworld.com/2013/4/23/roche-shuts-down-third-generation-ngs-research-programs.html Roche Shuts Down Third-Generation NGS Research Programs&lt;/ref&gt;

Roche produces a number of software tools which are optimised for the analysis of 454 sequencing data.&lt;ref name=454analysis&gt;[http://454.com/products-solutions/analysis-tools/gs-de-novo-assembler.asp Products - Analysis Software : 454 Life Science, a Roche Company]&lt;/ref&gt; GS Run Processor&lt;ref&gt;[http://sequence.otago.ac.nz/download/ManualPartB.pdf Genome Sequencer FLX System Software Manual, version 2.3]&lt;/ref&gt; converts raw images generated by a sequencing run into intensity values. The process consists of two main steps: image processing and signal processing. The software also applies normalization, signal correction, base-calling and quality scores for individual reads. The software outputs data in Standard Flowgram Format (or SFF) files to be used in data analysis applications (GS De Novo Assembler, GS Reference Mapper or GS Amplicon Variant Analyzer). GS De Novo Assembler is a tool for ''de novo'' assembly of whole-genomes up to 3GB in size from shotgun reads alone or combined with paired end data generated by 454 sequencers. It also supports de novo assembly of transcripts (including analysis), and also isoform variant detection.&lt;ref name=454analysis /&gt; GS Reference Mapper maps short reads to a reference genome, generating a consensus sequence. The software is able to generate output files for assessment, indicating insertions, deletions and SNPs. Can handle large and complex genomes of any size.&lt;ref name=454analysis /&gt; Finally, the GS Amplicon Variant Analyzer aligns reads from amplicon samples against a reference, identifying variants (linked or not) and their frequencies. It can also be used to detect unknown and low-frequency variants. It includes graphical tools for analysis of alignments.&lt;ref name=454analysis /&gt;

===Illumina===
[[File:GA2.JPG|thumbnail|Illumina Genome Analyzer II sequencing machine]]
[[Illumina (company)|Illumina]] produces a number of next-generation sequencing machines using technology acquired from [[Manteia Predictive Medicine]] and developed by Solexa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2006-11-05/solexas-progress-is-in-the-genes Solexa's Progress Is In The Genes - Businessweek&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Illumina makes a number of next generation sequencing machines using this technology including the HiSeq, Genome Analyzer IIx, MiSeq and the HiScanSQ, which can also process [[DNA microarray|microarrays]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.illumina.com/systems.ilmn Illumina Systems]&lt;/ref&gt;

The technology leading to these DNA sequencers was first released by Solexa in 2006 as the Genome Analyzer.&lt;ref name="Comparison Next-Gen Seq" /&gt;  Illumina purchased Solexa in 2007. The Genome Analyzer uses a sequencing by synthesis method. The first model produced 1G per run. During the year 2009 the output was increased from 20G per run in August to 50G per run in December. In 2010 Illumina released the HiSeq 2000 with an output of 200 and then 600G per run which would take 8 days. At its release the HiSeq 2000 provided one of the cheapest sequencing platforms at $0.02 per million bases as costed by the [[Beijing Genomics Institute]].

In 2011 Illumina released a benchtop sequencer called the MiSeq. At its release the MiSeq could generate 1.5G per run with paired end 150bp reads. A sequencing run can be performed in 10 hours when using automated DNA sample preparation.&lt;ref name="Comparison Next-Gen Seq" /&gt;

The Illumina HiSeq uses two software tools to calculate the number and position of DNA clusters to assess the sequencing quality: the HiSeq control system and the real-time analyzer. These methods help to assess if nearby clusters are interfering with each other.&lt;ref name="Comparison Next-Gen Seq" /&gt;

===Life Technologies===
[[Life Technologies (Thermo Fisher Scientific)|Life Technologies]] (now Thermo Fisher Scientific) produces DNA sequencers under the [[Applied Biosystems]] and [[Ion Torrent]] brands. Applied Biosystems makes the SOLiD next-generation sequencing platform,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thermofisher.com/appliedbiosystems SOLiD]&lt;/ref&gt; and Sanger-based DNA sequencers such as the 3500 Genetic Analyzer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/life-science/sequencing/sanger-sequencing.html Sanger Sequencing | Life Technologies]&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Ion Torrent brand, Applied Biosystems produces four next-generation sequencers: the Ion PGM System, Ion Proton System, Ion S5 and Ion S5xl systems.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thermofisher.com/iontorrent Ion Torrent&lt;/ref&gt;. The company is also believed to be developing their new capillary DNA sequencer called SeqStudio that will be released early 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/products-and-services/promotions/life-science/seqstudio-genetic-analyzer.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

SOLiD systems was acquired by Applied Biosystems in 2006. SOLiD applies sequencing by ligation and [[2 base encoding|dual base encoding]]. The first SOLiD system was launched in 2007, generating reading lengths of 35bp and 3G data per run. After five upgrades, the 5500xl sequencing system was released in 2010, considerably increasing read length to 85bp, improving accuracy up to 99.99% and producing 30G per 7-day run.&lt;ref name="Comparison Next-Gen Seq" /&gt;

The limited read length of the SOLiD has remained a significant shortcoming&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.appliedbiosystems.com/absite/us/en/home/applications-technologies/solid-next-generation-sequencing.html SOLiD system accuracy]&lt;/ref&gt; and has to some extent limited its use to experiments where read length is less vital such as resequencing and transcriptome analysis and more recently ChIP-Seq and methylation experiments.&lt;ref name="Comparison Next-Gen Seq" /&gt; The DNA sample preparation time for SOLiD systems has become much quicker with the automation of sequencing library preparations such as the Tecan system.&lt;ref name="Comparison Next-Gen Seq" /&gt;

The colour space data produced by the SOLiD platform can be decoded into DNA bases for further analysis, however software that considers the original colour space information can give more accurate results. Life Technologies has released BioScope,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lifetechnologies.com/au/en/home/life-science/sequencing/next-generation-sequencing/solid-next-generation-sequencing/solid-next-generation-sequencing-data-analysis-solutions/solid-bioscope-software.html SOLiD BioScope Software | Life Technologies]&lt;/ref&gt; a data analysis package for resequencing, ChiP-Seq and transcriptome analysis. It uses the MaxMapper algorithm to map the colour space reads.

===Beckman Coulter===
[[Beckman Coulter]] (now [[Danaher Corporation|Danaher]]) has previously manufactured chain termination and capillary electrophoresis-based DNA sequencers under the model name CEQ, including the CEQ 8000.  The company now produces the GeXP Genetic Analysis System, which uses [[dye terminator sequencing]]. This method uses a [[thermocycler]] in much the same way as [[PCR]] to denature, anneal, and extend DNA fragments, amplifying the sequenced fragments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rai|first=Alex J.|author2=Kamath, Rashmi M. |author3=Gerald, William |author4= Fleisher, Martin |title=Analytical validation of the GeXP analyzer and design of a workflow for cancer-biomarker discovery using multiplexed gene-expression profiling|journal=Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry|date=29 October 2008|volume=393|issue=5|pages=1505–1511|doi=10.1007/s00216-008-2436-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beckmancoulter.com/wsrportal/wsr/research-and-discovery/products-and-services/genetic-analysis-systems/genomelab-gexp-genetic-analysis-system/index.htm#overview Beckman Coulter, Inc - GenomeLab GeXP Genetic Analysis System]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Oxford Nanopore ===
[[Oxford Nanopore Technologies]] has begun shipping early versions of its [[nanopore sequencing]] MinION sequencer to selected labs. The device is four inches long and gets power from a [[USB port]]. MinION decodes DNA directly as the molecule is drawn at the rate of 450 bases/second through a [[nanopore]] suspended in a membrane. Changes in electric current indicate which base is present. It is 60 to 85 percent accurate, compared with 99.9 percent in conventional machines. Even inaccurate results may prove useful because it produces long read lengths. GridION is a slightly larger sequencer that processes up to five MinION flow cells at once. PromethION is another (unreleased) product that will use as many as 100,000 pores in parallel, more suitable for high volume sequencing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.technologyreview.com/news/530746/radical-new-dna-sequencer-finally-gets-into-researchers-hands|title = Radical New DNA Sequencer Finally Gets into Researchers’ Hands|last = Regalado|first = Antonio|date = September 17, 2014|work = Technology Review|accessdate = October 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''David Suzuki: The Autobiography''''' is the 2006 [[autobiography]] of Canadian science writer and broadcaster [[David Suzuki]]. The book focuses mostly on his life since the 1987 publication of his first autobiography, ''Metamorphosis: Stages in a Life''. It begins with a chronological account of his childhood, academic years, and broadcasting career. In later chapters, Suzuki adopts a [[memoir]] style, writing about themes such as his relationship with Australia, his experiences in [[Brazil]] and [[Papua New Guinea]], the founding of the [[David Suzuki Foundation]], and his thoughts on climate change, celebrity status, technology, and death. Throughout, Suzuki highlights the continuing impact of events from his childhood.

This is Suzuki's forty-third book and, he says, his last.&lt;ref name=Dakers/&gt; Critics have called the book candid, sincere, and charming, with insightful commentary if occasionally flat stories. Suzuki's scientific background is reflected in the writing's rational and analytic style.

Suzuki's autobiography spent four weeks at {{abbr|No.|Number}} 1 on the ''[[Maclean's]]'' list of non-fiction best-sellers and six weeks at No. 6 on the ''[[The Globe and Mail|Globe and Mail's]]'' list. The book won two awards in 2007: the Canadian Booksellers' Association's Libris Award for Non-Fiction Book of the Year and the [[Bill Duthie Booksellers' Choice Award|British Columbia Booksellers' Choice Award]].&lt;ref name=CBALibris/&gt;&lt;ref name=BCBooksellers/&gt; The publishers, Greystone Books and [[Douglas &amp; McIntyre]], won the CBA Libris Award for Marketing Achievement of the Year.&lt;ref name=CBALibris/&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Right Livelihood Award 2009-press conference-6.jpg|thumb|left|upright|David Suzuki in 2009]]
[[Vancouver]]-based David Suzuki, 70 years old at the time of this book's publication, is best known as an [[Environmentalism|environmental activist]] and host of the television show ''[[The Nature of Things]]''.  He has also worked as a [[geneticist]], [[nature writer]], and university professor.&lt;ref name=Kennedy&gt;{{Citation |last =Kennedy |first =Janice |publication-date =2006-04-23 |title =The Icon in Winter |newspaper =[[Ottawa Citizen]] |pages =A8}}&lt;/ref&gt; His previous book, written in 2002, was ''Good News for a Change.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title= Books and Audio: Complete List |year= 2007 |url= http://www.davidsuzuki.org/About_us/Dr_David_Suzuki/Books_And_Audio/Complete_List.asp |publisher= [[David Suzuki Foundation]] |accessdate= 2008-02-09 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080212151604/http://www.davidsuzuki.org/About_us/Dr_David_Suzuki/Books_And_Audio/Complete_List.asp |archivedate= 2008-02-12 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; His 1987 book, ''Metamorphosis: Stages in a Life'', unintentionally became his first autobiography. ''Metamorphosis'' was originally drafted as a collection of essays, but following the prompting of his publisher, Suzuki rewrote it in a more autobiographical style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last =Ubelacker |first =Sheryl |publication-date =2006-04-29 |title =The green man |newspaper =[[Brantford Expositor]] |pages =D8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suzuki's working title for this second autobiography was ''The Outsider'', a title intended to express the author's view of his own role in society. The origin of this outsider feeling comes from isolation suffered at a [[Japanese Canadian internment]] camp during World War II.&lt;ref name=Kennedy/&gt; He was imprisoned there for being Japanese but shunned by other Japanese for being a [[Sansei|third generation]] Canadian, speaking only English.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last =Keen |first =Paul |publication-date =November 2006 |title =Tireless Activist |magazine =[[Books in Canada]] |url =http://www.booksincanada.com/article_view.asp?id=4684 |accessdate =2008-02-08 |deadurl =yes |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20071216195648/http://www.booksincanada.com/article_view.asp?id=4684 |archivedate =2007-12-16 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; His feeling of isolation continued during his early school years when the only other student of Japanese heritage was his twin sister. Suzuki's daughters acknowledged this perception of himself as an outsider but insist that the public views him very differently, as one of their own, leading to the simple ''The Autobiography'' title.&lt;ref name=Rumleski&gt;{{Citation |last =Rumleski |first =Kathy |title =Suzuki reveals outsider status in book |url =http://jam.canoe.ca/Books/2006/04/29/1556065.html |newspaper =[[London Free Press]] |publisher =[[Canadian On-line Explorer|Canoe]] |accessdate =2008-01-27 |deadurl =yes |archiveurl =https://archive.is/20130115060633/http://jam.canoe.ca/Books/2006/04/29/1556065.html |archivedate =2013-01-15 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suzuki's objective in writing the book was to document his experiences of personal rewards gained from the [[environmental movement]] and to illustrate, specifically for young people, opportunities in environmentalism.&lt;ref name=Short&gt;{{Citation|last=Short |first=Sue |title=Science of Life |url=http://www.theweekender.com.au/features_det.php?id=157 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130115023059/http://www.theweekender.com.au/features_det.php?id=157 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-01-15 |magazine=Weekender |publisher=[[Quest Community Newspapers]] |accessdate=2008-01-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Suzuki believes that he has been unfairly labelled as "the master of doom and gloom" by conservative media outlets and that this book will help balance that view.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last =Keenan |first =Tom |publication-date =2006-05-06 |title =The righteous rebel |newspaper =[[Calgary Herald]] |pages =F1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He intends this autobiography to be his final book.

==Contents==
The book has eighteen chapters with a two-page preface, which explains his experience with ''Metamorphosis'' and how this book complements it. The thesis of this book is identified by one reviewer as: "the importance of childhood's formative years for the development of the person. In Suzuki's case, it is the effects of racism, notably time spent in [[Japanese Canadian internment|BC's internment camps]] during the [[World War II|Second World War]], that still haunt him."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Wolfe-Wylie |first=William |publication-date=2006-06-26 |title=One on one with David Suzuki - Scientist speaks about childhood, family, and the power of the people |newspaper=[[The Peak (newspaper)|The Peak]] |issue=8 |url=http://www.peak.sfu.ca/the-peak/2006-2/issue8/fe-suzuki.html |accessdate=2007-01-27 |volume=123 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315152200/http://www.peak.sfu.ca/the-peak/2006-2/issue8/fe-suzuki.html |archivedate=2007-03-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview, Suzuki said, "my drive to do well has been motivated by the desire to demonstrate to my fellow Canadians that my family and I had not deserved to be treated as we were".&lt;ref name=Kennedy/&gt; Suzuki identifies a turning point of his life as winning his high school's student presidential election. He initially refused to run believing he was not popular enough. His father encouraged him, saying: "There's no disgrace in losing&amp;nbsp;... The important thing is trying." Suzuki ran and unexpectedly won with an "outsider" platform.&lt;ref name=Rumleski/&gt;

Suzuki recounts his youth and academic years as a student, professor, and genetics researcher. On his broadcasting career, Suzuki recalls early interviews that demonstrated an affinity for public speaking and the jobs that allowed him to travel the world. Regarding his personal life, he describes his relationships with his five children and the development of his two marriages. In a review in the ''[[New Zealand Listener]],'' David Larsen observes: "Step by step, you see him thinking his way into full-fledged environmentalism: not because he's a natural zealot, but because he's an intellectually honest man brought face to face with evidence that our current economic and energy policies are digging our grandchildren's graves."&lt;ref name=Larsen&gt;{{Citation |last = Larsen |first = David |title =The reluctant saviour |date =2006-08-26 |url = http://www.listener.co.nz/uncategorized/the-reluctant-saviour/ |magazine =[[New Zealand Listener]] |volume =205 |publication-place =[[Auckland]] |accessdate =2008-01-27 |issue =3459}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later chapters tell of events since ''Metamorphosis.'' In British Columbia, Suzuki spends time on the [[Queen Charlotte Islands]] and in [[Stein Valley Nlaka'pamux Heritage Park|Stein Valley]] advocating against logging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last =Suzuki |first =David |author-link =David Suzuki |publication-date = April 22, 2006 |title =David Suzuki: The Autobiography |place = Vancouver |publisher = Greystone Books |pages =113–133 |isbn =1-55365-156-1 |year =2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He describes his travels in Brazil while shooting an episode of ''The Nature of Things'' in 1988 and the relationship he developed with the [[Kayapo people]].&lt;ref&gt;Suzuki, 134–154.&lt;/ref&gt; One of their leaders returned to Canada with him to advocate the protection of his homeland in the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]].&lt;ref&gt;Suzuki, 155–174.&lt;/ref&gt; His tour of [[Papua New Guinea]]&lt;ref&gt;Suzuki, 288–304.&lt;/ref&gt; and how Australia became his second home are explained.&lt;ref&gt;Suzuki, 195–216.&lt;/ref&gt; He describes the founding and early years of the [[David Suzuki Foundation]], a [[non-profit organization]] based on environmental protection and developing sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;Suzuki, 217–266.&lt;/ref&gt; In the final four chapters Suzuki elaborates on his thoughts about climate change, celebrity status, technology, and death. He laments the lack of global action on climate change, scientific illiteracy on the part of politicians, and the lack of media attention to science. In the final chapter he accepts death as an inevitability and expects his works to be forgotten quickly, leaving his grandchildren as his only true legacy.&lt;ref&gt;Suzuki, 370–398.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style and genre==
Suzuki's tone is relaxed and understated.&lt;ref name=Kennedy/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wiersema&gt;{{Citation |last =Wiersema |first =Robert |author-link =Robert Wiersema |publication-date =2006-05-06 |title =The private side of a public intellectual |newspaper =[[The Vancouver Sun]] |pages =F15}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Wiersema]] notes that Suzuki's style has "an analytic quality&amp;nbsp;... probably rooted in his scientific training".&lt;ref name=Wiersema/&gt; Suzuki shows a humble, dry humour and instances of blurting out surprising statements.&lt;ref name=Short/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wiersema/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brett&gt;{{Citation |last =Brett |first =Brian |author-link =Brian Brett |publication-date =2006-04-22 |title =Self-portrait in green |newspaper =[[The Globe and Mail]] |publication-place =[[Toronto]] |pages =D14}}&lt;/ref&gt; One reviewer describes the style as a "fusion of by-the-numbers personal narrative and passionate, insightful commentary".&lt;ref name=Larsen/&gt;

The book begins as a chronological narrative of Suzuki's life with photographs of his family and friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |year= 2007 |title= Suzuki, David |publisher= B.C. BookWorld |url= http://www.abcbookworld.com/view_author.php?id=1740 |accessdate= 2008-02-04 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110526124330/http://www.abcbookworld.com/view_author.php?id=1740 |archivedate= 2011-05-26 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first five chapters cover the same time period as the first autobiography, from childhood to age fifty. Later chapters use a [[memoir]] style with personal thoughts developed around themes. Suzuki recounts his experiences with indigenous groups and his personal relationships with individual members. A [[Travel literature|travelogue]] of his journeys in Brazil, Papua New Guinea, Australia, and some places in Canada is presented. Scientific concepts and explanations occur throughout the book.&lt;ref name=Burns&gt;{{Citation |last =Burns |first =John |date =2006-04-27 |title =David Suzuki turns up the heat on Harper |newspaper =[[The Georgia Straight]] |url= https://www.straight.com/article/david-suzuki-turns-up-the-heat-on-harper-0 |accessdate =2008-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication and marketing==
Two weeks before its release on April 22, 2006, an excerpt was printed in the national daily newspaper ''[[The Globe and Mail]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last =Suzuki |first =David |author-link =David Suzuki |publication-date =2006-04-08 |title =Excerpt from ''David Suzuki: The Autobiography'' |newspaper =[[The Globe and Mail]] |publication-place =[[Toronto]] |pages =F1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Greystone Books]], the Vancouver division of [[Douglas &amp; McIntyre]], published the book. The book tour included more than 35 stops over two months throughout Canada.&lt;ref name =Dakers/&gt; Promoted by the publishers as his "final book tour" and labelled by Suzuki as his "thank-you book tour", it began in [[Victoria, British Columbia]], and included stops from coast-to-coast, from [[Whitehorse, Yukon]], to [[New Glasgow, Nova Scotia]].&lt;ref name=CBA&gt;{{Citation |title =CBA Libris Awards 2007 (PDF) |year=2007 |url = http://cbabook.org/AWARDS/Libris2007NomineeProfiles.pdf |format=PDF| publisher =Canadian Booksellers Association |accessdate =2008-02-09 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071020200958/http://cbabook.org/AWARDS/Libris2007NomineeProfiles.pdf |archivedate = 2007-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attended by nearly 500 people at each event, a multimedia slideshow with personal photos and videos was presented by Suzuki.&lt;ref name=CBA/&gt; The publishers estimated that Suzuki signed 5000 books and conducted 137 media interviews.&lt;ref name=CBA/&gt; For their efforts Douglas &amp; McIntyre and Greystone Books were awarded the 2007 Canadian Booksellers Association's Libris Award for Marketing Achievement of the Year.&lt;ref name=CBA/&gt; In July, the book was published by [[Allen &amp; Unwin]] in Australia. Suzuki conducted a promotional tour of both Australia and New Zealand in October and November.&lt;ref name=Larsen/&gt; The same publishers released paperback editions in April 2007.

Critics variously described his writing as "forthright," "chatty", and "charming".&lt;ref name=Burns/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last =Richardson |first =Owen |publication-date =2006-09-08 |title =Book Review: David Suzuki: The Autobiography |newspaper =[[The Age]] |url= http://www.theage.com.au/news/book-reviews/david-suzuki-the-autobiography/2006/09/08/1157222319992.html |accessdate =2008-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Blackford |first=Jenny |publication-date=2007-04-20 |title=Reviews: Non-Fiction: David Suzuki: The Autobiography |magazine=[[Cosmos (magazine)|Cosmos]] |url=http://www.cosmosmagazine.com/node/1232 |accessdate=2008-01-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120190401/http://www.cosmosmagazine.com/node/1232 |archivedate=2008-01-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a review in ''The Globe and Mail'' [[Brian Brett]] admires "Suzuki's disarming candour" and labels it "a strange, fascinating book".&lt;ref name=Brett/&gt; While Brett's review is positive, he calls it "clunkily written" and sometimes repetitive.&lt;ref name=Brett/&gt; The ''[[Edmonton Journal]]'' review notes that Suzuki could "charm the socks off the most hardened soul", but that many of his stories fall flat.&lt;ref name=Struzik&gt;{{Citation |last =Struzik |first =Ed |publication-date =2006-04-30 |title =Suzuki a compelling character |newspaper =[[Edmonton Journal]] |pages =E11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The review in the ''[[Quill &amp; Quire]]'' notes Suzuki "has not written an indulgent autobiography" and that he "is too polite to dish on his enemies".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last =Kett|first =Andrew |publication-date =May 2006 |title =David Book Review: Suzuki: The Autobiography |journal =[[Quill &amp; Quire]] |url= http://www.quillandquire.com/reviews/review.cfm?review_id=5096 |accessdate =2008-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''[[The Vancouver Sun]]'', [[Robert Wiersema]] states that while "his life is an open book&amp;nbsp;... [y]ou get the sense of meeting the real Suzuki for the first time." Wiersema calls him "a natural storyteller".&lt;ref name=Wiersema/&gt; The ''New Zealand Listener'' review states, "as a writer, he has the charm of a high-school geek desperately trying to get a date&amp;nbsp;... but ultimately it's what allows his story to convince".&lt;ref name=Larsen/&gt; Several critics find Suzuki's writing on death to be particularly well-done.&lt;ref name=Wiersema/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brett/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Schiefer |first=Nancy |publication-date=2006-04-27 |title=Suzuki laments conscience role |newspaper=[[London Free Press]] |url=http://lfpress.ca/cgi-bin/publish.cgi?p=132947&amp;x=articles&amp;s=books |archive-url=https://archive.is/20060903143907/http://lfpress.ca/cgi-bin/publish.cgi?p=132947&amp;x=articles&amp;s=books |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-09-03 |accessdate=2008-01-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of reviewers compared this book with the earlier one, ''Metamorphosis''.  The ''Edmonton Journal'' considers ''David Suzuki: The Autobiography'' to be more candid and insightful than the previous book.&lt;ref name=Struzik/&gt; On the other hand, [[Peter Desbarats]], writing in [[Literary Review of Canada]], suggests that  ''Metamorphosis'' had more personal charm. Desbarats is disappointed that ''The Autobiography'' does not provide a better reflection on the themes of ''Metamorphosis.'' He points out that the best parts, Suzuki's early years, are condensed from one third of ''Metamorphosis'' to a single chapter in ''The Autobiography.''  Desbarats states that neither book ends with a "satisfying final word" and concludes that Suzuki "is his own worst and most frustrating biographer".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last =Desbarats |first =Peter |author-link =Peter Desbarats |publication-date =June 2006 |title =Scientist, Activist or TV Star? |journal =[[Literary Review of Canada]] |volume =14 |pages=20–21 |url= http://lrc.reviewcanada.ca/index.php?page=scientist-activist-or-tv-star |accessdate =2008-01-27 |issue=5 | archiveurl = http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Scientist,+activist+or+TV+star%3F+In+his+second+attempt+at+charting+his...-a0160281406 | archivedate = 2012-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Garfield was born in 1925 in New York City as Eugene Eli Garfinkle,&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; and was raised in a Lithuanian&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Deeds and Dreams of Eugene Garfield|url=http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/papers/chemicalintelligencerp26y1999.pdf|work=[[University of Pennsylvania]]|accessdate=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;-Italian [[Jewish]] family.&lt;ref name=his-bio&gt;{{cite book|title=World Encyclopedia of Library and Information Services|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HSFu99FCJwQC&amp;pg=PA313|accessdate=14 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied at the [[University of Colorado]] and [[University of California, Berkeley]] before getting a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[chemistry]] from [[Columbia University]] in 1948.&lt;ref name=infoplease&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/biography/var/eugenegarfield.html|title=Eugene Garfield Biography|website=infoplease.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=timeshigher&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302142809/https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/citation-analytics-pioneer-eugene-garfield-dies-aged-91|archivedate=2017-03-02|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/citation-analytics-pioneer-eugene-garfield-dies-aged-91|website=[[Times Higher Education]]|first=John|last=Elmes|year=2017|title=Citation analytics pioneer Eugene Garfield dies, aged 91|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garfield also received a degree in Library Science from Columbia University in 1953&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wouters|first=Paul|date=2017-03-23|title=Eugene Garfield (1925-2017)|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v543/n7646/full/543492a.html|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=543|issue=7646|pages=492–492|doi=10.1038/543492a|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Web on Knowledge|last=Cronin|first=Blaise|publisher=ASIS|year=2000|isbn=1-57387-099-4|location=Medford, NJ|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to do his [[PhD]] in the Department of [[Linguistics]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], which he completed in 1961 for developing an [[algorithm]] for translating [[chemical nomenclature]] into [[chemical formula]]s.&lt;ref name=garfieldphd&gt;{{cite thesis |degree=PhD |first=Eugene Eli|last=Garfield |title=

==Career and research==
Garfield founded the [[Institute for Scientific Information|Institute for Scientific Information (ISI)]], which was located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name="OralHistory"/&gt; ISI formed a major part of the science division of Thomson Reuters. In October 2016 Thomson Reuters completed the sale of its intellectual property and science division; it is now known as [[Clarivate Analytics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clarivate.com/news/ip-and-science-launched-as-independent-company/|title=Acquisition of the Thomson Reuters Intellectual Property and Science Business by Onex and Baring Asia Completed|website=clarivate.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Garfield is responsible for many innovative bibliographic products, including ''[[Current Contents]]'', the ''[[Science Citation Index]]'' (SCI), and other citation databases, the ''[[Journal Citation Reports]]'', and ''Index Chemicus''. He is the founding editor and publisher of ''[[The Scientist (magazine)|The Scientist]]'', a news magazine for life scientists. In 2003, the [[University of South Florida]] School of Information was honored to have him as lecturer for the [[Alice G. Smith Lecture]]. In 2007, he launched [[Histcite|HistCite]], a bibliometric analysis and visualization software package.

Following ideas inspired by [[Vannevar Bush]]'s highly cited 1945 article ''[[As We May Think]]'', Garfield undertook the development of a comprehensive [[citation index]] showing the propagation of scientific thinking; he started the [[Institute for Scientific Information]] in 1955 (it was sold to the Thomson Corporation in 1992&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Thomson Corporation acquired ISI | journal = [[Online (magazine)|Online]] | url =http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-12394745.html |date = July 1992 | accessdate = 2015-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;).  According to Garfield, "the citation index ... may help a historian to measure the influence of an article — that is, its 'impact factor'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Garfield E |title=Citation indexes for science: A new dimension in documentation through association of ideas |journal=Science |volume=122 |pages=108–11 |year=1955 |doi=10.1126/science.122.3159.108 |pmid=14385826}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The creation of the ''Science Citation Index'' made it possible to calculate [[impact factor]],&lt;ref name="pmid16391221"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Garfield E |title=The history and meaning of the journal impact factor |journal=JAMA |volume=295 |issue=1 |pages=90–3 |year=2006 |pmid=16391221 |doi=10.1001/jama.295.1.90}}&lt;/ref&gt; which ostensibly measures the importance of scientific journals.  It led to the unexpected discovery that a few journals like ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' and ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' were core for all of [[hard science]].  The same pattern does not happen with the humanities or the social sciences.&lt;ref name="Buranyi"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Buranyi|first1=Stephen|title=Is the staggeringly profitable business of scientific publishing bad for science?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jun/27/profitable-business-scientific-publishing-bad-for-science|accessdate=15 September 2017|work=The Guardian|date=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goodall"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Goodall|first1=Amanda|last2=Oswald|first2=Andrew|title=Do the social sciences need a shake-up?|work=THE World University Rankings|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/features/do-the-social-sciences-need-a-shake-up/2016165.article|date=October 9, 2014|accessdate=15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Masic"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Masic|first1=Izet|title=The Most Influential Scientist in the Development of Medical informatics (17): Eugene Garfield|journal=Acta Informatica Medica|date=2017|volume=25|issue=2|pages=145|doi=10.5455/aim.2017.25.145-145|pmc=5544436|pmid=28883683}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His entrepreneurial flair in having turned what was, at least at the time, an obscure and specialist metric into a highly profitable business has been noted.&lt;ref name=annurev/&gt;

Garfield's work led to the development of several [[information retrieval]] algorithms, like the [[HITS algorithm]] and [[PageRank]]. Both use the structured citation between websites through hyperlinks.  [[Google]] co-founders [[Larry Page]] and [[Sergey Brin]] acknowledged Gene in their development of PageRank, the algorithm that powers their company's search engine.&lt;ref name=annurev&gt;{{cite web|url=https://annualreviewsnews.org/2017/02/27/eugene-garfield-1925-2017/|title=Eugene Garfield – 1925-2017 – a life of impact|website=annualreviewsnews.org|first=Richard|last=Gallagher|year=2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170228172321/https://annualreviewsnews.org/2017/02/27/eugene-garfield-1925-2017/|archivedate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honors and awards==
Garfield was awarded the [[John Price Wetherill Medal]] in 1984&lt;ref name="OralHistory"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wiliams |first1= Robert V.|title=Eugene Garfield, Transcript of an Interview Conducted by Robert V. Williams at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on 29 July 1997 |url=http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/papers/oralhistorybywilliams.pdf |place=Philadelphia, PA |publisher=[[Chemical Heritage Foundation]] |date= July 29, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Richard J.

Bolte Sr. Award for Supporting Industries|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/richard-j-bolte-sr-award-for-supporting-industries|website=[[Science History Institute]]|accessdate=6 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Association for Library and Information Science Education]] has a fund for doctoral research through an award named after Garfield.

==Criticism==
Writing in ''Physiology News'', No. 69, Winter 2007, David Colquhoun of the Department of Pharmacology, University College London, described the "impact factor," a method for comparing scholarly journals, as "the invention of Eugene Garfield, a man who has done enormous harm to true science." Colquhoun ridiculed C. Hoeffel's assertion that Garfield's impact factor "has the advantage of already being in existence and is therefore a good technique for scientific evaluation" by saying, "you can't get much dumber than that. It is a 'good technique' because it is already in existence? There is something better. Read the papers."

==Personal life==
Garfield is survived by a wife, three sons, a daughter, a step-daughter, two granddaughters, and two great-grandchildren.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webofstories.com/people/eugene.garfield|title= Eugene Garfield tells his life story (video)|website=webofstories.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OralHistory"/&gt;

'''Explorer 19''' was an [[United States|American]] [[satellite]] launched on December 19, 1963, as part of [[NASA]]'s [[Explorers program]]. It was the third of six identical Explorer satellites launched to study air density and composition, and the second to reach orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/explorer.html|title=Explorer Spacecraft Series|publisher=NASA History Division|first=Woody|last=Smith|accessdate=10 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was identical to [[Explorer 9]].&lt;ref name=gsp&gt;{{cite web|title=Explorer:AD|url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/explorer_ad.htm|publisher=Gunter's Space Page|access-date=10 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second of six identical [[air density]] research satellites to be launched, Explorer 9 was the first to successfully reach orbit. It was still operational when the next satellite, Explorer 19, was launched, allowing simultaneous readings to be taken and compared. The spacecraft consisted of alternating layers of [[aluminium foil]] and [[Mylar]] [[polyester]] film. Uniformly distributed over the aluminium surface were 5.1&amp;nbsp;cm-diameter dots of white paint for thermal control. The sphere was packed in a tube 21.6&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter and 48.3&amp;nbsp;cm long and mounted in the nose of the fourth stage of the launch vehicle. Upon separation of the fourth stage, the sphere was inflated by a nitrogen gas bottle, and a separation spring ejected it out into its own orbit. The two hemispheres of aluminium foil were separated with a gap of Mylar at the spacecraft's equator and served as the antenna. A 136&amp;nbsp;MHz, 15&amp;nbsp;mW beacon was carried for tracking purposes, but the beacon failed on the first orbit and the SAO [[Schmidt camera#Baker-Nunn|Baker-Nunn camera]] network had to be relied upon for tracking. Power was supplied by [[solar cells]] and rechargeable batteries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NSSDCA/COSPAR ID: 1961-004A |url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1961-004A |publisher=NASA |accessdate=9 June 2018}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Foundation'' series''' is a [[science fiction]] book series written by American author [[Isaac Asimov]]. For nearly thirty years, the series was a trilogy: ''[[Foundation (Asimov novel)|Foundation]]'', ''[[Foundation and Empire]]'', and ''[[Second Foundation]]''. It won the one-time [[Hugo Award]] for "Best All-Time Series" in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/1966-hugo-awards/| title=1966 Hugo Awards| publisher=[[Hugo Award]]| website=thehugoawards.org| accessdate=July 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nesfa.org/data/LL/Hugos/hugos1966.html| title=The Long List of Hugo Awards, 1966| accessdate=July 28, 2017| publisher=[[New England Science Fiction Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asimov began adding to the series in 1981, with two sequels: ''[[Foundation's Edge]]'', ''[[Foundation and Earth]]'', and two prequels: ''[[Prelude to Foundation]]'', ''[[Forward the Foundation]]''. The additions made reference to events in Asimov's [[Robot series (Asimov)|''Robot'']] and [[Galactic Empire (series)|''Empire'' series]], indicating that they were also set in the same fictional universe.

The premise of the series is that the mathematician [[Hari Seldon]] spent his life developing a branch of mathematics known as [[psychohistory (fictional)|psychohistory]], a concept of [[mathematical sociology]]. Using the laws of [[mass action (sociology)|mass action]], it can predict the future, but only on a large scale. Seldon foresees the imminent fall of the [[Galactic Empire (Isaac Asimov)|Galactic Empire]], which encompasses the entire [[Milky Way]], and a [[Dark Ages (historiography)|dark age]] lasting 30,000 years before a second great empire arises. Seldon's calculations also show there is a way to limit this interregnum to just one thousand years. To ensure the more favorable outcome and reduce human misery during the intervening period, Seldon creates the Foundation – a group of talented artisans and engineers positioned at the twinned extreme ends of the galaxy – to preserve and expand on humanity's collective knowledge, and thus become the foundation for the accelerated resurgence of this new galactic empire.

==Publication history==

===Original stories===
The original trilogy of novels were originally a series of eight short stories published in ''[[Astounding Magazine]]'' between May 1942 and January 1950. According to Asimov, the premise was based on ideas set forth in [[Edward Gibbon]]'s ''[[History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'', and was invented spontaneously on his way to meet with editor [[John W. Campbell]], with whom he developed the concepts of the collapse of the [[Galactic Empire (Asimov)|Galactic Empire]], the civilization-preserving Foundations, and psychohistory.&lt;ref&gt;Asimov, Isaac. La edad de oro II. Plaza &amp; Janes. 1987. P 252–253 (Spanish language translation of [[The Early Asimov]]) See afterword for the "Legal Rites" story.&lt;/ref&gt; Asimov wrote these early stories in his [[West Philadelphia]] apartment when he worked at the [[Philadelphia Naval Yard]].

===''Foundation'' trilogy===
The first four stories were collected, along with a new story taking place before the others, as a [[fixup]] published by [[Gnome Press]] in 1951 as ''[[Foundation (Isaac Asimov novel)|Foundation]]''. The remainder of the stories were published in pairs by Gnome as ''[[Foundation and Empire]]'' (1952) and ''[[Second Foundation]]'' (1953), resulting in the "Foundation Trilogy", as the series is still known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=ISAAC ASIMOV |title=Foundation's Edge |publisher=Spectra |location=Halmstad |year=1982 |page=1 |isbn=0-553-29338-9 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later sequels and prequels===
In 1981, Asimov was persuaded by his publishers to write a fourth book, which became ''[[Foundation's Edge]]'' (1982).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=ISAAC ASIMOV |title=Foundation and Earth |publisher=Spectra |location=Halmstad |year= |pages= |isbn=0-553-58757-9 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four years later, Asimov followed up with yet another sequel, ''[[Foundation and Earth]]'' (1986), which was followed by the prequels ''[[Prelude to Foundation]]'' (1988) and ''[[Forward the Foundation]]'' (1993), published after his death in 1992. During the two-year lapse between writing the sequels and prequels, Asimov had tied in his ''Foundation'' series with his various other series, creating a single unified universe. The basic link is mentioned in ''Foundation's Edge'': an obscure tradition about a first wave of space settlements with robots and then a second without. The idea is the one developed in ''[[Robots of Dawn]]'', which, in addition to showing the way that the second wave of settlements were to be allowed, illustrates the benefits and shortcomings of the first wave of settlements and their so-called ''[[carbon|C]]/[[iron|Fe]]'' (carbon/iron, signifying humans and robots together) culture. In this same book, the word ''psychohistory'' is used to describe the nascent idea of Seldon's work. Some of the drawbacks to this style of colonization, also called ''Spacer'' culture, are also exemplified by the events described in ''[[The Naked Sun]]''.

==Plot==

''Note: This plot is listed in the fictional chronological order of the stories in the series, which is not the order of publication. The series itself was left as a trilogy for many years, comprising "Foundation", "Foundation and Empire" and "Second Foundation". The two novels set chronologically earlier than the original trilogy, and the two which follow it, were later added to the series.''

===''Prelude to Foundation''===
{{main|Prelude to Foundation}}
''Prelude to Foundation'' opens on the planet [[Trantor]], the empire's capital planet, the day after [[Hari Seldon]] has given a speech at a mathematics conference. Several parties become aware of the content of his speech (that using mathematical formulas, it may be possible to predict the future course of human history). Seldon is hounded by the Emperor and various employed thugs who are working surreptitiously, which forces him into exile. Over the course of the book, Seldon and [[Dors Venabili]], a female companion and professor of history, are taken from location to location by [[Chetter Hummin]] who, under the guise of a reporter, introduces them to various Trantorian walks of life in his attempts to keep Seldon hidden from the Emperor.
Throughout their adventures all over Trantor, Seldon continuously denies that psychohistory is a realistic science. Even if feasible, it may take several decades to develop. Hummin, however, is convinced that Seldon knows something, so he continuously presses him to work out a starting point to develop psychohistory.
Eventually, after much traveling and introductions to various, diverse cultures on Trantor, Seldon realizes that using the entire known galaxy as a starting point is too overwhelming; he then decides to use Trantor as a model to work out the science, with a goal of later using the applied knowledge on the rest of the galaxy.

===''Forward the Foundation''===
{{main|Forward the Foundation}}
Eight years after the events of ''Prelude'', Seldon has worked out the science of psychohistory and has applied it on a galactic scale. His notability and fame increase and he is eventually promoted to First Minister to the Emperor. As the book progresses, Seldon loses those closest to him, including his wife, Dors Venabili, as his own health deteriorates into old age. Having worked his entire adult life to understand psychohistory, Seldon instructs his granddaughter, Wanda, to set up the Second Foundation.

===''Foundation''===
{{main|Foundation (Isaac Asimov novel)}}
Called forth to stand trial on Trantor for allegations of treason (for foreshadowing the decline of the Galactic Empire), Seldon explains that his science of psychohistory foresees many alternatives, all of which result in the Galactic Empire eventually falling. If humanity follows its current path, the Empire will fall and 30,000 years of turmoil will overcome humanity before a second Empire arises. However, an alternative path allows for the intervening years to be only one thousand, if Seldon is allowed to collect the most intelligent minds and create a compendium of all human knowledge, entitled ''[[Encyclopedia Galactica]]''. The board is still wary but allows Seldon to assemble whomever he needs, provided he and the "Encyclopedists" be exiled to a remote planet, [[Terminus (planet)|Terminus]]. Seldon agrees to these terms – and also secretly establishes a second Foundation of which almost nothing is known, which he says is at the "opposite end" of the galaxy.

After fifty years on Terminus, and with Seldon now deceased, the inhabitants find themselves in a crisis. With four powerful planets surrounding their own, the Encyclopedists have no defenses but their own intelligence. At the same time, a vault left by Seldon is due to automatically open. The vault reveals a pre-recorded [[hologram]] of Seldon, who informs the Encyclopedists that their entire reason for being on Terminus is a fraud, insofar as Seldon did not actually care whether or not an encyclopedia was created, only that the population was placed on Terminus and the events needed by his calculations were set in motion. In reality, the recording discloses, Terminus was set up to reduce the dark ages from 30,000 years to just one millennium, based on following his calculations. It will develop by facing intermittent and extreme "crises" – known as "Seldon Crises" – which the laws governing psychohistory show will inevitably be overcome, simply because human nature will cause events to fall in particular ways which lead to the intended goal. The recording reveals that the present events are the first such crisis, reminds them that a second foundation was also formed at the "opposite end" of the galaxy, and then falls silent.

The Mayor of Terminus City, [[Salvor Hardin]], proposes to play the planets against each other. His plan is a success; the Foundation remains untouched, and he is promoted to Mayor of Terminus (the planet). Meanwhile, the minds of the Foundation continue to develop newer and greater technologies which are smaller and more powerful than the Empire's equivalents. Using its scientific advantage, Terminus develops trade routes with nearby planets, eventually taking them over when its technology becomes a much-needed commodity. The interplanetary traders effectively become the new diplomats to other planets. One such trader, [[Hober Mallow]], becomes powerful enough to challenge and win the seat of Mayor and, by cutting off supplies to a nearby region, also succeeds in adding more planets to the Foundation's reach.

===''Foundation and Empire''===
{{main|Foundation and Empire}}
An ambitious general of the current Emperor of the Galaxy perceives the Foundation as a growing threat and orders an attack on it, using the Empire's still-mighty fleet of war vessels. The Emperor, initially supportive, becomes suspicious of his general's long-term motive for the attack, and recalls the fleet despite being close to victory. In spite of its undoubted inferiority in purely military terms, the Foundation emerges as the victor and the Empire itself is defeated. Seldon's hologram reappears in the vault on Terminus, and explains to the Foundation that this opening of the vault follows a conflict whose result was inevitable whatever might have been done – a weak Imperial navy could not have attacked them, while a strong navy would have shown itself by its successes to be a direct threat to the Emperor himself and been recalled.

A century later, an unknown outsider called the Mule has begun taking over planets belonging to the Foundation at a rapid pace. The Foundation comes to realize the Mule is a [[mutant]], unforeseen in Seldon's plan, and that the plan cannot have predicted any certainty of defeating him. [[Toran and Bayta Darell]], accompanied by [[Ebling Mis]] – the galaxy's current greatest psychologist – and a court jester familiar with the Mule named Magnifico (whom they agree to protect, as his life is under threat from the Mule himself), set out to find the Second Foundation, hoping to bring an end to the Mule's reign. Mis studies furiously in the Great Library of Trantor to decipher the Second Foundation's location in order to visit it and seek their help.  He is successful and also deduces that the Mule's success stems from his mutation; he is able to change the emotions of others, a power he used to first instill fear in the inhabitants of his conquered planets, then to make his enemies devoutly loyal to him. Mis is killed by Bayta Darell before he can reveal the location, having realised that Magnifico is in fact the Mule and has been using his gifts to drive Mis forward in his research, so that he can learn the location himself and subjugate the Second Foundation also. Dismayed at having made a mistake which allowed Bayta to see through his disguise, the Mule leaves Trantor to rule over his conquered planets while continuing his search.

===''Second Foundation''===
{{main|Second Foundation}}
As the Mule comes closer to finding it, the mysterious Second Foundation comes briefly out of hiding to face the threat directly. It consists of the descendants of Seldon's psychohistorians. While the first Foundation has developed the physical sciences, the Second Foundation has been developing Seldon's mathematics and the Seldon Plan, along with their own use of mental sciences. The Second Foundation ultimately wears down the Mule, who returns to rule over his kingdom peacefully for the rest of his life, without any further thought of conquering the Second Foundation.

However, as a result, the first Foundation has learned something of the Second Foundation beyond the simple fact that it exists, and has some understanding of its role. This means their behavior will now be chosen in light of that knowledge, and not based on uninformed natural human behavior, which means their behavior will no longer be the natural responses required by the mathematics of the Seldon Plan. This places the Plan itself at great risk. Additionally, the first Foundation instead starts to resentfully consider the other as a rival, and begins to develop equipment related to detecting and blocking mental influence, in order to detect members of the Second Foundation. After many attempts to unravel the Second Foundation's whereabouts from the minimal clues available, the Foundation is led to believe the Second Foundation is located on Terminus (being the "opposite end" of a galaxy, for a galaxy with a circular shape). The Foundation uncovers and destroys a group of fifty members of the Second Foundation and is left believing they have destroyed the Second Foundation. No longer concerned at the perceived threat, their behaviors as a society will tend to be those anticipated by the Plan.

In fact the group of fifty were volunteers on Terminus whose role was to be captured and give the impression that they composed the whole of the Second Foundation, so that the Seldon Plan would be able to continue unimpeded. The Second Foundation, itself, is finally revealed to be located on the former Imperial Homeworld of Trantor. The clue "at Star's End" was not a physical clue, but was instead based on an old saying, "All roads lead to Trantor, and that is where all stars end." Seldon, being a social scientist and not a physical one, placed the two Foundations at "opposite ends" of the galaxy, but in a sociological rather than physical sense. The first Foundation was located on the Periphery of the galaxy, where the Empire's influence was minimal; the Second Foundation was on Trantor, where, even in its dying days, the Empire's power and culture was strongest.

===''Foundation's Edge''===
{{main|Foundation's Edge}}
Believing the Second Foundation still exists (despite the common belief that it has been extinguished), young politician [[Golan Trevize]] is sent into [[exile]] by the current Mayor of the Foundation, [[List of minor Foundation series characters#Harla Branno|Harla Branno]], to uncover the Second Foundation; [[Golan Trevize|Trevize]] is accompanied by a scholar named [[Janov Pelorat]]. The reason for their belief is that, despite the unforeseeable impact of the Mule, the Seldon Plan still appears to be proceeding in accordance with the statements of Seldon's hologram, suggesting that the Second Foundation still exists and is secretly intervening to bring the plan back on course. After a few conversations with Pelorat, Trevize comes to believe that a mythical planet called [[Earth (Foundation universe)|Earth]] may hold the secret to the location. No such planet exists in any database, yet several myths and legends all refer to it, and it is Trevize's belief that the planet is deliberately being kept hidden. Unknown to Trevize and Pelorat, Branno is tracking their ship so that, in the event they find the Second Foundation, the first Foundation can take military or other action.

Meanwhile, [[Stor Gendibal]], a prominent member of the Second Foundation, discovers a simple local on Trantor who has had a very subtle alteration made to her mind, far more delicate than anything the Second Foundation can do. He concludes that a greater force of Mentalics must be active in the Galaxy. Following the events on Terminus, Gendibal endeavors to follow Trevize, reasoning that by doing so, he may find out who has altered the mind of the Trantor native.

Using the few scraps of reliable information within the various myths, Trevize and Pelorat discover a planet called Gaia which is inhabited solely by Mentalics, to such an extent that every organism and inanimate object on the planet shares a common mind. Both Branno and Gendibal, who have separately followed Trevize, also reach Gaia at the same time. Gaia reveals that it has engineered this situation because it wishes to do what is best for humanity but cannot be sure what is best. Trevize's purpose, faced with the leaders of both the First and Second Foundations and Gaia itself, is to be trusted to make the best decision among the three main alternatives for the future of the human race: the First Foundation's path, based on mastery of the physical world and its traditional political organization (i.e., Empire); the Second Foundation's path, based on mentalics and probable rule by an elite using mind control; or Gaia's path of absorption of the entire Galaxy into one shared, harmonious living entity in which all beings, and the galaxy itself, would be a part.

After Trevize makes his decision for Gaia's path, the intellect of Gaia adjusts both Branno's and Gendibal's minds so that each believes he or she has succeeded in a significant task. (Branno believes she has successfully negotiated a treaty tying Sayshell to the Foundation, and Gendibal – now leader (and First Speaker) of the Second Foundation – believes that the Second Foundation is victorious and should continue as normal.) Trevize remains, but is uncertain as to why he has intuited (is "sure") that Gaia is the correct outcome for the future.

===''Foundation and Earth''===
{{main|Foundation and Earth}}
Still uncertain about his decision, Trevize continues on with the search for Earth along with Pelorat and a local of Gaia, advanced in Mentalics, known as Blissenobiarella (usually referred to simply as Bliss). Eventually, Trevize finds three sets of coordinates which are very old. Adjusting them for time, he realizes that his ship's computer does not list any planet in the vicinity of the coordinates. When he physically visits the locations, he rediscovers the forgotten worlds of [[Aurora (planet)|Aurora]], [[Solaria]], and finally [[Melpomenia]]. After searching and facing different dilemmas on each planet, Trevize still has not discovered any answers.

Aurora and Melpomenia are long deserted, but Solaria contains a small population which is extremely advanced in the field of Mentalics. When the lives of the group are threatened, Bliss uses her abilities (and the shared intellect of Gaia) to destroy the Solarian who is about to kill them. This leaves behind a small child who will be put to death if left alone, so Bliss makes the decision to keep the child as they quickly escape the planet.

Eventually, Trevize discovers Earth, but it, again, contains no satisfactory answers for him (it is also long-since deserted). However, it dawns on Trevize that the answer may not be on Earth, but on Earth's satellite – the Moon. Upon approaching the planet, they are drawn inside the Moon's core, where they meet a robot named [[R. Daneel Olivaw]].

Olivaw explains that he has been instrumental in guiding human history for thousands of years, having provided the impetus for Seldon to create psychohistory and also the creation of Gaia, but is now close to the end of his ability to maintain himself and will cease to function. Despite replacing his [[positronic]] brain (which contain 20,000 years of memories), he is going to die shortly. He explains that no further robotic brain can be devised to replace his current one, or which will let him continue assisting for the benefit of humanity. However, some additional time can be won to ensure the long term benefit of humanity by merging [[R. Daneel Olivaw|R. Daniel Olivaw's]] mind with the organic intellect of a human – in this case, the intellect of the child that the group rescued on Solaria.

Once again, Trevize is put in the position of deciding if having Olivaw meld with the child's superior intellect would be in the best interests of the galaxy. The decision is left ambiguous (though likely a "yes") as it is implied that the melding of the minds may be to the child's benefit, but that she may have sinister intentions about it.

==Development and themes==
The early stories were inspired by [[Edward Gibbon]]'s ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]''. The plot of the series focuses on the growth and reach of the Foundation, against a backdrop of the "decline and fall of the Galactic Empire." The themes of Asimov's stories were also influenced by the political tendency in SF fandom, associated with the [[Futurians]], known as [[John Michel (science fiction)|Michelism]].

The focus of the books is the trends through which a civilization might progress, specifically seeking to analyze their progress, using history as a precedent. Although many science fiction novels such as ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' or ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'' do this, their focus is upon how current trends in society might come to fruition, and act as a moral allegory on the modern world. The ''Foundation'' series, on the other hand, looks at the trends in a wider scope, dealing with societal evolution and adaptation rather than the human and cultural qualities at one point in time.

Furthermore, the concept of psychohistory, which gives the events in the story a sense of rational fatalism, leaves little room for moralization. Hari Seldon himself hopes that his Plan will "reduce 30,000 years of Dark Ages and barbarism to a single millennium," a goal of exceptional moral gravity. Yet events within it are often treated as inevitable and necessary, rather than deviations from the greater good. For example, the Foundation slides gradually into oligarchy and dictatorship prior to the appearance of the galactic conqueror, known as the [[Mule (Foundation)|Mule]], who was able to succeed through the random chance of a telepathic mutation. But, for the most part, the book treats the purpose of [[Seldon Plan|Seldon's plan]] as unquestionable, and that slide as being necessary in it, rather than mulling over whether the slide is, on the whole, positive or negative.

The books also wrestle with the idea of individualism. Hari Seldon's plan is often treated as an inevitable mechanism of society, a vast mindless [[mob mentality]] of quadrillions of humans across the galaxy. Many in the series struggle against it, only to fail. However, the plan itself is reliant upon the cunning of individuals such as [[Salvor Hardin]] and [[Hober Mallow]] to make wise decisions that capitalize on the trends. On the other hand, the Mule, a single individual with mental powers, topples the Foundation and nearly destroys the Seldon plan with his special, unforeseen abilities. To repair the damage the Mule inflicts, the Second Foundation deploys a plan which turns upon individual reactions. Psychohistory is based on group trends and cannot predict with sufficient accuracy the effects of extraordinary, unforeseeable individuals, and as originally presented, the Second Foundation's purpose was to counter this flaw. Later novels would identify the Plan's uncertainties that remained at Seldon's death as the primary reason for the existence of the Second Foundation, which (unlike the First) had retained the capacity to research and further develop psychohistory.

Asimov tried unsuccessfully to end the series with ''[[Second Foundation]]''. However, because of the predicted thousand years until the rise of the next Empire (of which only a few hundred had elapsed), the series lacked a sense of closure. For decades, fans pressured him to write a sequel. In 1982, after a 30-year hiatus, Asimov gave in and wrote what was at the time a fourth volume: ''[[Foundation's Edge]]''. This was followed shortly thereafter by ''[[Foundation and Earth]]''. The story of this volume (which takes place some 500 years after Seldon) ties up all the loose ends and brings together all of his Robot, Empire, and Foundation novels into a single story. He also opens a brand new line of thought in the last dozen pages regarding [[Gaia (Foundation universe)#Galaxia|Galaxia]], a galaxy inhabited by a single collective mind. This concept was never explored further. According to his widow [[Janet Asimov]] (in her biography of Isaac, ''[[It's Been a Good Life]]''), he had no idea how to continue after ''Foundation and Earth'', so he started writing the prequels.

==The Foundation series==

===Merging with other series===
The series is set in the same universe as Asimov's first published novel, ''[[Pebble in the Sky]]'', although ''Foundation'' takes place about 10,000 years later. ''Pebble in the Sky'' became the basis for the [[Galactic Empire (series)|''Empire'' series]]. Then, at some unknown date (prior to writing ''Foundation's Edge'') Asimov decided to merge the ''Foundation''/''Empire'' series with his [[Robot series (Asimov)|''Robot'' series]]. Thus, all three series are set in the same universe, giving them a combined length of 15 novels, and a total of about 1,500,000 words (see the [[#Asimov's books within the Foundation series|List of books]] below). The merge also created a time-span of the series of around 20,000 years.

The stand-alone story ''[[Nemesis (Asimov novel)|Nemesis]]'' is also in the same continuity; being referenced in ''[[Forward the Foundation]]'', where [[Hari Seldon]] refers to a twenty-thousand-year-old story of "a young woman that could communicate with an entire planet that circled a sun named Nemesis." Commentators noted that ''Nemesis'' contains barely disguised references to the Spacers and their calendar system, the Galactic Empire and even to Hari Seldon which seem to have been deliberately placed for the purpose of later integration into the ''Foundation'' universe.&lt;ref name="From Robots to Foundations" &gt;{{cite book|last1=Codex|first1=Regius|title=From Robots to Foundations|date=2014|location=Wiesbaden/Ljubljana|isbn=1499569823}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Timeline inconsistencies===
Early on during Asimov's original world-building of the ''Foundation'' universe, he established within the first published stories a chronology placing the tales about 50,000 years into the future from the time they were written (''circa'' 1940). This precept was maintained in the pages of his first novel ''Pebble in the Sky'', wherein Imperial archaeologist [[Bel Arvardan]] refers to ancient human strata discovered in the Sirius sector dating back "some 50,000 years". However, when Asimov decided decades later to retroactively integrate the universe of his ''Foundation'' and ''Galactic Empire'' novels with that of his ''Robot'' stories, a number of changes and minor discrepancies surfaced – the character [[R. Daneel Olivaw]] was established as having existed for some 20,000 years, with the original ''Robot'' novels featuring the character occurring not more than a couple of millennia after the early-21st century [[Susan Calvin]] short stories. Also, in ''Foundation's Edge'', mankind was referred to as having possessed interstellar space travel for only 22,000 years, a far cry from the 50 millennia of earlier works.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

In the spring of 1955, Asimov published an early timeline in the pages of ''[[Thrilling Wonder Stories]]'' magazine based upon his thought processes concerning the ''Foundation'' universe's history at that point in his life, which vastly differs from its modern-era counterpart. Many included stories would later be either jettisoned from the later chronology or temporally relocated by the author. Also, the aforementioned lengthier scope of time was changed. For example, in the original 1950s timeline, humanity does not discover the hyperspatial drive until around 5000 AD, whereas in the reincorporated ''Robot'' universe chronology, the first interstellar jump occurs in 2029 AD, during the events of ''[[I, Robot]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asimovreviews.net/Timeline.html |title=An Early Asimov Timeline |publisher=Asimovreviews.net |date=2006-02-14 |accessdate=2013-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other authors==
Asimov's novels covered only 500 of the expected 1,000 years it would take for the Foundation to become a galactic empire. The novels written after Asimov did not continue the timeline but rather sought to fill in gaps in the earlier stories. The ''Foundation'' universe was once again revisited in 1989's ''[[Foundation's Friends]]'', a collection of short stories written by many prominent science fiction authors of that time. [[Orson Scott Card]]'s "[[The Originist]]" clarifies the founding of the Second Foundation shortly after Seldon's death; [[Harry Turtledove]]'s "Trantor Falls" tells of the efforts by the Second Foundation to survive during the sacking of Trantor, the imperial capital and Second Foundation's home; and [[George Zebrowski]]'s "Foundation's Conscience" is about the efforts of a historian to document Seldon's work following the rise of the Second Galactic Empire.

Also, shortly before his death in 1992, Asimov approved an outline for three novels, known as the Caliban trilogy by [[Roger MacBride Allen]], set between ''[[Robots and Empire]]'' and the Empire series. The Caliban trilogy describes the terraforming of the [[Spacer (Asimov)|Spacer]] world Inferno, a planet where an ecological crisis forces the Spacers to abandon many long-cherished parts of their culture. Allen's novels echo the uncertainties that Asimov's later books express about the [[Three Laws of Robotics]], and in particular the way a thoroughly roboticized culture can degrade human initiative.

After Asimov's death and at the request of Janet Asimov and the Asimov estate's representative, Ralph Vicinanza approached [[Gregory Benford]], and asked him to write another ''Foundation'' story. He eventually agreed, and with Vicinanza and after speaking "to several authors about [the] project", formed a plan for a trilogy with "two hard SF writers broadly influenced by Asimov and of unchallenged technical ability: [[Greg Bear]] and [[David Brin]]."&lt;ref&gt;Quotes from the Author's afterword in Foundation's Fear (Benford)&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Foundation's Fear]]'' (1997) takes place chronologically between part one and part two of Asimov's second prequel novel, ''[[Forward the Foundation]]''; ''[[Foundation and Chaos]]'' (1998) is set at the same time as the first chapter of ''Foundation'', filling in background; ''[[Foundation's Triumph]]'' (1999) covers ground following the recording of the holographic messages to the Foundation, and ties together a number of loose ends. These books are now claimed by some&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sikander.org/foundation.php|title=TimeLine for the Robots &amp; Foundations Universe|first=|last=sikander|website=www.sikander.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kaedrin.com/fun/asimov/newfound.html|title=The Second Foundation Series - Kaedrin's Guide to Isaac Asimov|website=kaedrin.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; to collectively be a "''Second Foundation'' trilogy", although they are inserts into pre-existing prequels and some of the earlier Foundation storylines and not generally recognized as a new Trilogy.

In an epilogue to ''Foundation's Triumph'', Brin noted he could imagine himself or a different author writing another sequel to add to ''Foundation's Triumph'', feeling that Hari Seldon's story was not yet necessarily finished. He later published a possible start of such a book on his website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davidbrin.com/foundationdenouement1.html|title=worlds of DAVID BRIN|first=David Brin, Runaway|last=Serfer|website=www.davidbrin.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, the Asimov estate authorized publication of another trilogy of robot mysteries by [[Mark W. Tiedemann]]. These novels, which take place several years before Asimov's ''Robots and Empire'', are ''Mirage'' (2000), ''Chimera'' (2001), and ''Aurora'' (2002). These were followed by yet another robot mystery, [[Alexander C. Irvine]]'s ''Have Robot, Will Travel'' (2004), set five years after the Tiedemann trilogy.

In 2001, Donald Kingsbury published the novel ''[[Psychohistorical Crisis]]'', set in the Foundation universe after the start of the Second Empire.

Novels by various authors (''Isaac Asimov's'' ''[[Isaac Asimov's Robot City|Robot City]]'', ''[[Isaac Asimov's Robots and Aliens|Robots and Aliens]]'' and ''[[Isaac Asimov's Robots in Time|Robots in Time]]'' series) are loosely connected to the ''Robot'' series, but contain many inconsistencies with Asimov's books, and are not generally considered part of the ''Foundation'' series.

In November 2009, the Isaac Asimov estate announced the upcoming publication of'' Robots and Chaos'', the first volume in a trilogy featuring Susan Calvin by fantasy author [[Mickey Zucker Reichert]]. The book was published in November 2011 under the title ''I, Robot: To Protect''.

Knopf, Inc.), 185ff.&lt;/ref&gt; psychologist [[Martin Seligman]] identifies the ''Foundation'' series as one of the most important influences in his professional life, because of the possibility of predictive sociology based on psychological principles. He also lays claim to the first successful prediction of a major historical (sociological) event, in the [[United States presidential election, 1988|1988 US elections]], and he specifically attributes this to a psychological principle.&lt;ref&gt;Seligman discusses the successful prediction of the Presidential and 33 Senatorial elections based on an evaluation of the candidates' optimism as expressed in their speeches, and the principle that American voters systematically favor optimistic candidates.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1996 book ''To Renew America'', [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|U. S. House Speaker]] [[Newt Gingrich]] wrote how he was influenced by reading the ''Foundation'' trilogy in high school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://historynewsnetwork.org/article/143446 "Newt Gingrich the Galactic Historian"]. [[Ray Smock]], [[History News Network]], 08 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Krugman]], winner of the 2008 [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]], credits the ''Foundation'' series with turning his mind to economics, as the closest existing science to psychohistory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/dec/04/paul-krugman-asimov-economics|title=Paul Krugman: Asimov's Foundation novels grounded my economics|first=Paul|last=Krugman|date=4 December 2012|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/business/july-dec08/nobelkrugman_10-13.html|title=U.S. Economist Krugman Wins Nobel Prize in Economics|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Businessman and entrepreneur [[Elon Musk]] counts the series among the inspirations for his career.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediabistro.com/galleycat/the-science-fiction-books-that-inspired-elon-musk_b67209 "Science Fiction Books That Inspired Elon Musk,"] Media Bistro: Galley Cat, March 19, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Elon Musk's Tesla Roadster|Musk's Tesla Roadster]] was launched into space on the [[Falcon Heavy Test Flight|maiden flight]] of the [[Falcon Heavy]] rocket in February 2018, amongst other items it carried a copy of the Foundation series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/nation-now/2018/02/06/spacex-falcon-heavy-launch/310431002/|title=Elon Musk successfully launched his Tesla into orbit on SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket|publisher=USA Today|date=February 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the nonfiction PBS series ''[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage]]'', [[Carl Sagan]] referred to an ''Encyclopedia Galactica'' in the episodes "Encyclopaedia Galactica" and "Who Speaks for Earth".

===Awards===
In 1966, the ''Foundation'' trilogy beat several other science fiction and fantasy series to receive a special [[Hugo Award]] for "Best All-Time Series". The runners-up for the award were ''[[Barsoom series]]'' by [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], ''[[Future History (Heinlein)|Future History series]]'' by [[Robert A. Heinlein]], ''[[Lensman series]]'' by [[Edward E. Smith]] and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]].&lt;ref name=Hugo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/1966-hugo-awards/|title=1966 Hugo Awards|date=26 July 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation series is still the only series so honored. Asimov himself wrote that he assumed the one-time award had been created to honor ''The Lord of the Rings'', and he was amazed when his work won.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= In Joy Still Felt: The Autobiography of Isaac Asimov, 1954–1978|last= Asimov|first= Isaac|date= 1980|publisher=Doubleday|location= Garden City, New York|isbn= 0-385-15544-1|at= chapter 24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series has won three other Hugo Awards. ''Foundation's Edge'' won Best Novel in 1983, and was a bestseller for almost a year. Retrospective Hugo Awards were given in 1996 and 2018 for, respectively, "The Mule" (the major part of ''Foundation and Empire'') for Best Novel (1946) and "Foundation" (the first story written for the series, and second chapter of the first novel) for Best Short Story (1943).

===Impact in fiction and entertainment===
Science fiction parodies, such as [[Douglas Adams]]' ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' and [[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison]]'s ''[[Bill, the Galactic Hero]]'', often display clear ''Foundation'' influences. For instance, "The Guide" of the former is a spoof of the ''[[Encyclopedia Galactica]]'', and the series actually mentions the encyclopedia by name, remarking that it is rather "dry", and consequently sells fewer copies than the guide; the latter also features the ultra-urbanized Imperial planet Helior, often parodying the logistics such a planet-city would require, but that Asimov's novel downplays when describing Trantor.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

In 1995, [[Donald Kingsbury]] wrote "Historical Crisis", which he later expanded into a novel, ''[[Psychohistorical Crisis]]''. It takes place about 2,000 years after ''Foundation'', after the founding of the Second Galactic Empire. It is set in the same fictional universe as the Foundation series, in considerable detail, but with virtually all ''Foundation''-specific names either changed (e.g., Kalgan becomes Lakgan), or avoided (psychohistory is created by an unnamed, but often-referenced Founder). The novel explores the ideas of psychohistory in a number of new directions, inspired by more recent developments in mathematics and [[computer science]], as well as by new ideas in science fiction itself.

In 1998, the novel [[Spectre (Star Trek)]] (part of the [[Shatnerverse]] series) by [[William Shatner]] and [[Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens]] states that the [[Mirror Universe]] divergent path has been studied by the ''Seldon Psychohistory Institute''.

The [[oboe]]-like holophonor in [[Matt Groening]]'s animated television series ''[[Futurama]]'' is based directly upon the "Visi-Sonor" which [[Mule (Foundation)|Magnifico]] plays in ''Foundation and Empire.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people=Cohen, David X.|date=2003|title=Futurama season 4 DVD commentary for the episode "The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings"|medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox|quote=Of course, you'll remember the holophonor [...] as we've said [...] is inspired by an instrument in [...] Foundation, one of the Foundation books, Isaac Asimov, the Mule plays an instrument much like that, except that it controls peoples minds.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Visi-Sonor" is also mirrored in an episode of ''[[Special Unit 2]]'', where a child's television character plays an instrument that induces mind control over children.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

During the 2006–2007 [[Marvel Comics]] [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]] [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] storyline, in [[Fantastic Four]] #542 [[Mister Fantastic]] revealed his own attempt to develop psychohistory, saying he was inspired after reading the Foundation series.

According to lead singer [[Ian Gillan]], the hard rock band [[Deep Purple]]'s song ''The Mule'' is based on the Foundation character: "Yes, The Mule was inspired by Asimov. It's been a while but I'm sure you've made the right connection...Asimov was required reading in the 60's."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gillan.com/qa-62.html|title=Caramba - Q&amp;a|website=www.gillan.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radio adaptation===
An eight-part [[The Foundation Trilogy (BBC Radio)|radio adaptation]] of the original trilogy, with sound design by the [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop]], was broadcast on [[BBC Radio 3]] in 1973 – one of the first BBC radio drama serials to be made in [[stereophonic sound|stereo]]. A [[BBC 7]] [[rerun]] commenced in July 2003.

Adapted by [[Patrick Tull]] (episodes 1 to 4) and Mike Stott (episodes 5 to 8), the dramatisation was directed by [[David Cain (composer)|David Cain]] and starred William Eedle as Hari Seldon, with [[Geoffrey Beevers]] as Gaal Dornick, [[Lee Montague]] as Salvor Hardin, [[Julian Glover]] as Hober Mallow, [[Dinsdale Landen]] as Bel Riose, [[Maurice Denham]] as Ebling Mis and [[Prunella Scales]] as Lady Callia.

===Film adaptation===
By 1998, [[New Line Cinema]] had spent $1.5&amp;nbsp;million developing a film version of the ''Foundation Trilogy''. The failure to develop a new franchise was partly a reason the studio signed on to produce [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Sibley | first = Brian | authorlink = Brian Sibley | title = Peter Jackson: A Film-maker's Journey | publisher =Harpercollins | year =2006 | location =London | page =403 | isbn = 0-00-717558-2 |chapter=Three-Ring Circus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 29, 2008, [[New Line Cinema]] co-founders [[Bob Shaye]] and [[Michael Lynne]] were reported to have been signed on to produce an adaptation of the trilogy by their company Unique Pictures for Warner Brothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Rich Drees| title = FOUNDATION Heading To Big Screen| publisher = Film Buff OnLine | date = 2008-07-29 | url = http://www.filmbuffonline.com/FBOLNewsreel/wordpress/?p=842/ | accessdate=2008-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, [[Columbia Pictures]] (Sony) successfully bid for the screen rights on January 15, 2009, and then contracted [[Roland Emmerich]] to direct and produce. Michael Wimer was named as co-producer.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|0000386|Roland Emmerich}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Two years later, the studio hired [[Dante Harper]] to adapt the books. This project failed to materialize and [[HBO]] acquired the rights when they became available in 2014.&lt;ref name="Sneider"&gt;{{cite web |last1 = Sneider |first1 = Jeff |title = 'Interstellar's' Jonah Nolan Developing 'Foundation' Series for HBO, WBTV (Exclusive) |website = [[TheWrap]] |url = http://www.thewrap.com/interstellars-jonah-nolan-developing-foundation-series-for-hbo-wbtv-exclusive/ |date = 10 November 2014 |accessdate = 11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014, ''[[TheWrap]]'' reported that [[Jonathan Nolan]] was writing and producing a TV series based on the ''Foundation Trilogy'' for [[HBO]].&lt;ref name=Sneider/&gt; Nolan confirmed his involvement at a [[Paley Center for Media|Paley Center]] event on April 13, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PaleyLive: An Evening with the Cast of Person of Interest|website=[[Yahoo]]|url=https://screen.yahoo.com/live/event/paleylive-an-evening-with-person-of-interest|date=13 April 2015|accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2017, ''[[Deadline Hollywood|Deadline]]'' reported that [[Skydance Media]] will produce a TV series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fleming|first1=Mike, Jr.|title=Skydance Trying Asimov's 'Foundation' As TV Series; David Goyer, Josh Friedman To Adapt|url=http://deadline.com/2017/06/foundation-isaac-asimov-skydance-television-series-deal-david-goyer-josh-friedman-science-fiction-star-wars-1202120701/|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=27 June 2017|accessdate=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2018 it was announced that [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] has commissioned a 10 episode straight-to-series order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=‘Foundation’: Apple Gives Series Order To Adaptation Of Isaac Asimov’s Sci-Fi Classic From David Goyer &amp; Josh Friedman|url=https://deadline.com/2018/08/foundation-apple-gives-series-order-to-adaptation-of-isaac-asimovs-sci-fi-classic-from-david-goyer-josh-friedman-1202450917/|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=23 August 2018|accessdate=29 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books within the ''Foundation'' series==
===Overview===
The "Author's Note" of ''[[Prelude to Foundation]]'' contains the chronological ordering of Asimov's science fiction books, in which he also said, "they were not written in the order in which (perhaps) they should be read".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Asimov|first=Isaac|title=Prelude to Foundation|year=1988|publisher=Bantam Dell|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-553-90095-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Forward the Foundation'' does not appear in Asimov's list, as it was not yet published at the time, and the order of the Empire novels in Asimov's list is not entirely consistent with other lists. For example, the 1983 [[Ballantine Books]] printing of ''[[The Robots of Dawn]]'' lists the Empire novels as: ''[[The Stars, Like Dust]], [[The Currents of Space]]'', and ''[[Pebble in the Sky]]''. Given that ''The Currents of Space'' includes Trantor and that ''The Stars, Like Dust'' does not, these two books possibly were accidentally reversed in Asimov's list.

===Asimov's books within the ''Foundation'' series===
# ''[[The Complete Robot]]'' (1982) and/or ''[[I, Robot]]'' (1950)
# ''[[The Caves of Steel]]'' (1954)

Another alternative is to read the books in their original order of publication, since reading the ''Foundation'' prequels prior to reading the ''Foundation Trilogy'' fundamentally alters the original narrative structure of the trilogy by spoiling what were originally presented as plot surprises.{{original research inline|date=May 2011}} In that same ''Author's Note'', Asimov noted that there is room for a book between ''Robots and Empire (5)'' and ''The Currents of Space (6)'', and that he could follow ''Foundation and Earth (15)'' with additional volumes.

===Tangential books===
While not mentioned in the above list, the books ''[[The End of Eternity]]'' (1955) and ''[[Nemesis (Asimov)|Nemesis]]'' (1989) are also referenced in the series.

''The End of Eternity'' is vaguely referenced in ''Foundation's Edge'', where a character mentions the Eternals, whose "task it was to choose a [[reality]] that would be most suitable to Humanity". (''The End of Eternity'' also refers to a "Galactic Empire" within its story.) In ''Forward the Foundation'', Hari Seldon refers to a 20-thousand-year-old story of "a young woman that could communicate with an entire planet that circled a sun named Nemesis", a reference to ''Nemesis''. In ''Nemesis'', the main colony is one of the Fifty Settlements, a collection of orbital colonies that form a state. The Fifty Settlements possibly were the basis for the fifty Spacer worlds in the ''Robot'' stories. The implication at the end of ''Nemesis'' that the inhabitants of the off-Earth colonies are splitting off from Earthbound humans could also be connected to a similar implication about the Spacers in [[Mark W. Tiedemann]]'s ''Robot'' books.

On the other hand, these references might be just jokes by Asimov, and the stories mentioned could be just those really written by himself (as seen in ''The Robots of Dawn'', where Fastolfe makes a reference to Asimov's ''Liar!'') and still being read twenty thousand years later. Furthermore, Asimov himself did not mention ''The End of Eternity'' in the series listing from ''Prelude to Foundation''. As for ''Nemesis'', it was written after ''Prelude to Foundation'', but in the author's note Asimov explicitly states that the book is not part of the ''Foundation'' or ''Empire'' series, but that some day he might tie it to the others.

'''Infrared cirrus''' are filamentary structures seen in space that emit [[infrared]] [[light]]. The name is given because the structures are [[cloud]]-like in appearance.&lt;ref name=Low1984/&gt; These structures were first detected by the [[IRAS|Infrared Astronomy Satellite]] at [[wavelength]]s of 60 and 100 [[micrometre]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4683">The '''Injun''' program was a series of six [[satellite]]s designed and built by researchers at the [[University of Iowa]]. They were intended to observe various radiation and magnetic phenomena in the [[ionosphere]] and beyond.

The design specifics of the satellites had little in common, though all were solar-powered and the first five used [[Magnetorquer|magnetic stabilization]] to control spacecraft attitude. (The last in the series was spin-stabilized.) Instruments included particle detectors of varying types, [[magnetometer]]s, and [[photometer]]s for observing [[aurora (astronomy)|aurora]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Swift, Daniel W.|author2=Gurnett, Donald A.|title=Direct comparison between satellite electric field measurements and the visual aurora|journal=Research Report|date=1973|publisher=University of Iowa, Department of Physics and Astronomy|location=Iowa City, Iowa}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last three satellites were launched as part of the [[Explorer program]].

In spite of various hardware difficulties and the loss of Injun 2 due to an upper stage failure, the program was generally successful. In particular they produced data on the [[Van_Allen_radiation_belt|Van Allen radiation belts]] including [[Magnetospheric electric convection field|electrical convection in the magnetosphere]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gurnett|first1=Donald|editor1-last=Dyer|editor1-first=E.R.|title=Electrical Fields and Plasma Observations in the Magnetosphere, in Critical Problems in Magnetospheric Physics|publisher=American Geophyscial Union|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=123–138|url=http://www-pw.physics.uiowa.edu/~dag/publications/1972_ElectricFieldAndPlasmaObservationsInMagnetosphere_AGU-BOOK.pdf|accessdate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the radiation after effects of the [[Starfish Prime]] [[high altitude nuclear explosion|high-altitude nuclear test]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

'''Jillian M. Buriak''' [[Fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry|FRSC]] is a Canadian chemist, currently a [[Canada Research Chair]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chairs-chaires.gc.ca/media-medias/lists-listes/2016/february-fevrier-eng.aspx|title=Canada Research Chairs|last=Chairs|first=Government of Canada, Industry Canada,       Canada Research|website=www.chairs-chaires.gc.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Nanomaterials]] at [[University of Alberta]] and a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Canada]], [[American Association for the Advancement of Science|American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS)]] and [[Royal Society of Chemistry]]. She is known for her work develoing flexible, lightweight solar cells made from nanoparticles. By spraying a plastic surface with nanomaterials, she's able to fabricate a transparent layer of electrode that act as solar cells. Due the flexibility, they could be incorporated onto different surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://axial.acs.org/2017/09/14/thankascientist-jillian-buriak/|title=#ThankAScientist – Jillian Buriak - ACS Axial: Your Bond With Chemistry Research|date=2017-09-14|work=ACS Axial: Your Bond With Chemistry Research|access-date=2018-08-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She has an A.B. degree from [[Harvard University]] (1990) and a Ph.D. from [[Université Louis Pasteur]] (1995), Strasbourg, working on organometallic chemistry and catalysis. She held a postdoctoral appointment at the [[Scripps Research Institute]] at [[La Jolla]], California, working on self-assembly of nanostructures on surfaces. Buriak started her independent faculty career at [[Purdue University]] in 1997, was promoted to associate professor, with tenure, in 2001. In 2003, She joined the [[University of Alberta]] as a full professor.

From 2003 to 2008, Buriak was on the Board of Reviewing Editors (BoRE) at [[Science (journal)|''Science'']] (handling 7-10 papers per week). She was an associate editor at ''[[ACS Nano]]'' from 2009 to 2013 (handling &gt;500 papers per year). In 2014, she was appointed as the editor-in-chief of ''[[Chemistry of Materials]]''handling ~5000 papers per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pubs.acs.org/page/cmatex/profile.html|title=Editor Profile|website=pubs.acs.org|language=en|access-date=2018-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3038">In [[fluid dynamics]], the '''Lamb–Oseen vortex''' models a line [[vortex]] that decays due to [[viscosity]]. This vortex is named after [[Horace Lamb]] and  [[Carl Wilhelm Oseen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author=Saffman, P. G.; Ablowitz, Mark J.; J. Hinch, E.; Ockendon, J. R.; [[Peter J. Olver|Olver, Peter J.]] | authorlink= | coauthors= | title=Vortex dynamics | year=1992 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | location=Cambridge  | isbn=0-521-47739-5 | pages=}} p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lamb-Oseen vortex.svg|right|thumb|upright=1.5|Vector plot of the Lamb–Oseen vortex.]]

The mathematical model for the [[flow velocity]] in the [[circumference|circumferential]] &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;–direction in the Lamb–Oseen vortex is:

:&lt;math&gt;V_\theta(r,t) = \frac{\Gamma}{2\pi r} \left(1-\exp\left(-\frac{r^2}{r_c^2(t)}\right)\right), &lt;/math&gt;

with
*&lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; = radius,
*&lt;math&gt;r_c(t)=\sqrt{4\nu t + r_c(0)^2}&lt;/math&gt; = core radius of vortex,
*&lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; = [[kinematic viscosity|viscosity]], and
*&lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; = [[circulation (fluid dynamics)|circulation]] contained in the vortex.
The [[radius|radial]] velocity is equal to zero.

The associated [[vorticity]] distribution&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Wu, J. Z. |author2=Ma, H. Y. |author3=Zhou M. D. | title=Vorticity and Vortex Dynamics | year=2006 | publisher=Springer-Verlag | location=Berlin  | isbn=3-540-29027-3 | pages=262}} p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt; in the vortex-filament-direction (here &lt;math&gt;\hat{z}&lt;/math&gt;) can be found with the curl: 
:&lt;math&gt;\omega_z(r,t) = \frac{\Gamma}{\pi r_c(t)^2} \exp\left(-\frac{r^2}{r_c^2(t)}\right), &lt;/math&gt;

An alternative definition is to use the peak tangential velocity of the vortex rather than the total circulation

:&lt;math&gt;V_\theta\left( r \right) =
                        V_{\theta \max} \left( 1 + \frac{1}{2\alpha} \right)
                        \frac{r_\max}{r}
                        \left[ 1 - \exp \left( - \alpha \frac{r^2}{r_\max^2} \right)
                        \right],
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;r_{\max} (t)=\sqrt{\alpha} r_c(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the radius at which &lt;math&gt;v_\max&lt;/math&gt; is
attained, and the number ''α'' = 1.25643, see Devenport et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=W.J. Devenport |author2=M.C. Rife |author3=S.I. Liapis |author4=G.J. Follin | year=1996 | title= The structure and development of a wing-tip vortex| journal=Journal of Fluid Mechanics | volume=312 | pages=67–106 | doi=10.1017/S0022112096001929|bibcode = 1996JFM...312...67D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[pressure]] field simply ensures the vortex rotates in the [[circumference|circumferential]] direction, providing the [[centripetal]] force
:&lt;math&gt; {\partial p \over \partial r} = \rho {v^2 \over r},
&lt;/math&gt;
where ''ρ'' is the constant density&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=G.K. Batchelor |author-link=George Batchelor | year=1967 | title= An Introduction to Fluid Dynamics |publisher=Cambridge University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31607">This is a '''list of the manned space missions''' conducted by the [[Russian Federal Space Agency]] since 1992.  All Russian manned space missions thus far have been carried out using the [[Soyuz programme|Soyuz]] vehicle, and all visited either [[Mir]] or the [[International Space Station]].

The Russian Federal Space Agency was the successor to the [[Soviet space program]]. Numeration of the Soyuz flights therefore continues from previous Soviet Soyuz launches.  For previous flights of the Soyuz and other manned space vehicles, see [[List of Soviet manned space missions]].

This is a '''list of neurosteroids''', or [[natural product|natural]] and [[synthetic compound|synthetic]] [[steroid]]s that are active on the mammalian [[nervous system]] through [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s other than [[steroid hormone receptor]]s. It includes [[inhibitory postsynaptic potential|inhibitory]], [[excitatory postsynaptic potential|excitatory]], and [[neurotrophic]] neurosteroids as well as [[pheromone]]s and [[vomeropherine]]s. In contrast to [[steroid hormone]]s, neurosteroids have rapid, non-[[genome|genomic]] effects through interactions with [[membrane steroid receptor]]s and can quickly influence [[central nervous system]] function.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="171467">'''Phenyltropanes''' ('''PT'''s) are a family of chemical compounds originally derived from structural modification of [[cocaine]]. The main feature differentiating phenyltropanes from cocaine is that they lack the [[ester]] functionality at the 3-position terminating in the [[benzene]]; and thusly the [[Phenyl group|phenyl]] is attached direct to the [[tropane]] [[Skeletal formula|skeleton]] with no further [[Molecular spacer|spacer]] (therefore the name "''phenyl''"-tropane) that the cocaine [[benzoyl]]oxy provided. The original purpose of which was to extirpate the [[cardiotoxicity]] inherent in the [[local anesthetic]] "numbing" capability of cocaine (since the [[Methyl benzoate|methylated benzoate]] ester is essential to cocaine's blockage of [[sodium channel]]s which cause topical anesthesia) while retaining [[stimulant]] function.{{efn|&lt;ref name="Singh2" /&gt; ←[https://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/pdf/cocaineanalogs.pdf#5 Page #929 (5th page of article)] § II}} These compounds present many different avenues of research into therapeutic applications, particularly in addiction treatment. Uses vary depending on their construction and [[structure-activity relationship]] ranging from the treating of cocaine dependency to understanding the dopamine reward system in the human brain to treating [[Alzheimer's Disease|Alzheimer's]] &amp; [[Parkinson's Disease|Parkinson's]] [[diseases]]. (Since 2008 there have been continual additions to the list and enumerations of the plethora of types of chemicals that fall into the category of this substance profile.&lt;ref&gt;[http://v3.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/originalDocument?CC=US&amp;NR=2008153870A1&amp;KC=A1&amp;FT=D&amp;date=20080626&amp;DB=EPODOC&amp;locale=en_gb U.S. Patent Application Publication # US 2008/0153870 A1] M. J. Kuhar, et al. Jun. 26, 2008. Research Triangle Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;) Certain phenyltropanes can even be used as a smoking cessation aid (''c.f.'' RTI-29). Many of the compounds were first elucidated in published material by the [[RTI International|Research Triangle Institute]] and are thus named with "RTI" serial-numbers (in this case the long form is either RTI-COC-''n'', for 'cocaine' "analog", or specifically RTI-4229-''n'' of the subsequent numbers given below in this article){{efn|Many of the RTI phenyltropanes are "'''RTI-4229-&lt;big&gt;×××&lt;/big&gt;'''" where &lt;big&gt;×&lt;/big&gt; is the specific phenyltropane code number.&lt;br /&gt;―&lt;br /&gt;''e.g.'' '''RTI-55''' is in-fact '''RTI-4229-55''' but given below as simply RTI-55 for the sake of simplicity in shorthand (following as is done in the literature itself) as the subject matter in context is wholly within the scope of the phenyltropane coded category herein. Sometimes (more rarely) it is given as '''RTI-COC-&lt;big&gt;×××&lt;/big&gt;''' for "''coc''aine derivative."&lt;br /&gt;―&lt;br /&gt;Worth mentioning in notation as to explain that other compounds entirely unrelated can be found with the same "''RTI-&lt;big&gt;×××&lt;/big&gt;''" short-numbered assignation. Therefore it is to be expected that within different contexts a compound or chemical of the same name very possibly could be in reference to a entirely other substance of another chemical series non-analogous to those in this topic.}} Similarly, a number of others are named for [[Sterling Drug|Sterling-Winthrop pharmaceuticals]] ("WIN" serial-numbers) and [[Wake Forest University]] ("WF" serial-numbers). The following includes many of the phenyltropane class of drugs that have been made and studied.

Like cocaine, phenyltropanes are considered a 'typical' or 'classical' (i.e. "cocaine-like") DAT re-uptake pump ligands in that they stabilize an "open-to-out" conformation on the dopamine transporter; despite the extreme similarity to phenyltropanes, [[benztropine]] and others are in suchwise not considered "cocaine-like" and are instead considered atypical inhibitors insofar as they stabilize what is considered a more inward-facing (closed-to-out) conformational state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | date = Jul 2013 | title = Nonclassical Pharmacology of the Dopamine Transporter: Atypical Inhibitors, Allosteric Modulators, and Partial Substrates| journal = J Pharmacol Exp Ther | volume = 346 | issue = 1| pages = 2–10 Fig. 1 | doi = 10.1124/jpet.111.191056 | pmc=3684841 | pmid=23568856 | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3684841/figure/F1/| author1 = Schmitt| first1 = K.

Considering the differences between PTs and cocaine: the difference in the length of the benzoyloxy and the phenyl linkage contrasted between cocaine and phenyltropanes makes for a shorter distance between the [[centroid]] of the aromatic benzene and the bridge nitrogen of the tropane in the latter PTs. This distance being on a scale of 5.6 [[Angstrom|Å]] for phenyltropanes and 7.7 [[Angstrom|Å]] for cocaine or analogs with the benzoyloxy intact.{{efn|&lt;ref name="Singh2" /&gt; ←[https://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/pdf/cocaineanalogs.pdf#46 Page #970 (46th page of article)] §B, 10th line}} The manner in which this sets phenyltropanes into the binding pocket at MAT is postulated as one possible explanation to account for PTs increased behavioral stimulation profile over cocaine.{{efn|&lt;ref name="Singh2"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/pdf/cocaineanalogs.pdf|doi=10.1002/chin.200020238|title=Chem ''Inform'' Abstract: Chemistry, Design, and Structure-Activity Relationship of Cocaine Antagonists|journal=ChemInform|volume=31|issue=20|pages=no|year=2000|last1=Singh|first1=Satendra}} [https://www.scribd.com/doc/77191354/Satendra-Singh-Chemistry-Design-and-Structure-Activity-Relationship-of-Cocaine-Antagonists Mirror hotlink.]&lt;/ref&gt; ←[https://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/pdf/cocaineanalogs.pdf#47 Page #971 (47th page of article)] 1st ¶, 10th line}}

Use of a [[cyclopropyl]] ester appears to enable better [[monoamine transporter|MAT]] retention than does the choice of [[isopropyl]] ester.

Use of a [[cyclobutyl|&lt;sup&gt;cyc&lt;/sup&gt;Bu]] resulted in greater [[Dopamine active transporter|DAT]] selectivity than did the [[cyclopropyl|&lt;sup&gt;cyc&lt;/sup&gt;Pr]] homologue.

These [[heterocycle]]s are sometimes referred to as the "[[Bioisostere|bioisosteric]] equivalent" of the simpler esters from which they are derived. A potential disadvantage of leaving the ββ-ester unreacted is that in addition to being hydrolyzable, it can also epimerize&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

[[File:HeterocyclicMEPCmpndModel34.png|thumb|Atomic positions A—C&lt;br /&gt;(compound model '''34''')]]
Several of the oxadiazoles contain the same number and types of heteroatoms, while their respective binding potencies display 8×-15× difference. A finding that would not be accounted for by their affinity originating from hydrogen bonding.

To explore the possibility of electrostatic interactions, the use of [[molecular electrostatic potentials]] (MEP) were employed with model compound '''34''' (replacing the phenyltropane moiety with a methyl group). Focusing on the vicinity of the atoms @ positions A—C, the ''minima'' of electrostatic potential near atom position A (Δ''V''&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt;(A)), calculated with semi-empirical ([[Austin Model 1|AM1]]) quantum mechanics computations (superimposing the heterocyclic and phenyl rings to ascertain the least in the way of steric and conformational discrepancies) found a correlation between affinity @ DAT and Δ''V''&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt;(A): wherein the values for the latter for '''32c''' = 0, '''32g''' = -4, '''32h''' = -50 &amp; '''32i''' = -63 kcal/mol.

In contrast to this trend, it is understood that an increasingly negative Δ''V''&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt; is correlated with an increase of strength in hydrogen bonding, which is the opposing trend for the above; this indicates that the 2''β''-substituents (at least for the heterocyclic class) are dominated by electrostatic factors for binding in-the-stead of the presumptive hydrogen bonding model for this substituent of the cocaine-like binding ligand.{{efn|&lt;ref name="Singh2" /&gt; ←[https://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/pdf/cocaineanalogs.pdf#16 Page #940 (16th page of article)] underneath Table 8., above §&amp;nbsp;4}}

'''21a''' was twice as potent as both cocaine and troparil in displacement of ''β''-CFT, as well as displaying high &amp; low affinity ''K&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' values in the same manner as those two compounds. Whereas its inhibition of DA uptake showed it as comparably equipotent to cocaine &amp; troparil. '''21b''' by contrast had a one hundredfold decrease in high-affinity site binding compared to cocaine and a potency 10× less for inhibiting DA uptake.

The discrepancy in binding for the two benzene metal chelates is assumed to be due to electrostatic differences rather than their respective size difference. The solid cone angles, measured by the steric parameter (''i.e.'' '''''θ''''') is '''''θ'''''=131° for Cr(CO)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; whereas Cp*Ru was '''''θ'''''=187° or only 30% larger.

It is well established that electrostatic potential around the ''para'' position tends to improve [[monoamine transporter|MAT]] binding. This is believed to also be the case for the ''meta'' position, although it is less studied. N-demethylation dramatically potentiates NET and SERT affinity, but the effects of this on DAT binding are insignificant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of course, this is not always the case. For an interesting exception to this trend, see the [[RTI-274|Taxil]] document. There is ample evidence suggesting that N-demethylation of alkaloids occurs naturally ''in vivo'' via a biological enzyme. The fact that hydrolysis of the ester leads to inactive metabolites means that this is still the main mode of deactivation for analogues that have an easily metabolised 2-ester substituent. The attached table provides good illustration of the effect of this chemical transformation on MAT binding affinities. N.B. In the case of both nocaine and pethidine, N-demethyl compounds are more toxic and have a decreased seizure threshold.&lt;ref name="Spealman"&gt;{{Cite journal

The eight position nitrogen has been found to not be an exclusively necessary functional anchor for binding at the MAT for phenyltropanes and related compounds. Sulfurs, oxygens, and even the removal of any heteroatom, leaving only the carbon skeleton of the structure at the bridged position, still show distinct affinity for the monoamine transporter cocaine-target site and continue to form an ionic bond with a measurable degree of reasonable efficacy.

Fused tropane-derivatives as neurotransmitter reuptake inhibitors. Singh notes that all bridged derivatives tested displayed 2.5—104 fold higher DAT affinity than cocaine. The ones 2.8—190 fold more potent at DAT also had increased potency at the other two MAT sites (NET &amp; SERT); NET having 1.6—78× increased activity. ''(+)-128'' additionally exhibited 100× greater potency @ SERT, whereas ''132a'' &amp; ''133a'' had 4—5.2× weaker 5-HTT (''i.e.'' SERT) activity. Front-bridged (''e.g.'' 128 &amp; 129) had a better 5-HT/DA reuptake ratio in favor of SERT, while the back-bridged (''e.g.'' 130—133) preferred placement with DAT interaction.&lt;ref name="Singh2" /&gt;

Parent compound of a series of spirocyclic cocaine benzoyl linkage modification analogs created by Suzuki coupling method of ''ortho''-substituted arylboronic acids and an enol-triflate derived from cocaine; which technically has the three methylene length of cocaine analogues as well as the single length which defines the phenyltropane series. Note that the carbomethoxyl group is (due to constraints in synthetic processes used in the creation of this compound) alpha configured; which is not the usual, most prevalent, conformation favored for the PT cocaine-receptor binding pocket of most such sub-type of chemicals.

To better elucidate the binding requirements at MAT, the methylene unit on the tropane was extended by one to create the azanonane analogs.{{efn|&lt;ref name="Singh2" /&gt; ←[https://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/pdf/cocaineanalogs.pdf#43 Page #967 (43rd page of article)] 2nd column}} Which are the beginning of classes of modifications that start to become effected by the concerns &amp; influences of [[macrocyclic stereocontrol]].

Despite the loosened flexibility of the ring system, nitrogen constrained variants (such as were created to make the bridged class of phenyltropanes) which might better fit the rigid placement necessary to suit the spatial requirements needed in the binding pocket were not synthesized. Though front-bridged types were synthesized for the piperidine homologues: the trend of equal values for either isomers of that type followed the opposing trend of a smaller and lessened plasticity of the molecule to contend with a rationale for further constraining the pharmacophore within that scope. Instead such findings lend credence to the potential for the efficacy of fusing the nitrogen on an enlarged tropane, as like upon the compounds given below.

=== Azabornane (outer ring contracted) ===
3-Phenyl-7-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane derivatives

Ring-contracted analogs of phenyltropanes did not permit sufficient penetration of the phenyl into the target binding site on MAT for an affinity in the efficacious range. The distance from the nitrogen to the phenyl centroid for '''155a''' was 4.2 and '''155c''' was 5.0 [[Angstrom|Å]], respectively. (Whereas troparil was 5.6 &amp; compound '''20a''' 5.5 angstroms). However piperidine homologues (discussed below) had comparable potencies.{{efn|&lt;ref name="Singh2" /&gt; ←[https://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/pdf/cocaineanalogs.pdf#43 Page #967 (43rd page of article)] 2nd column}}

Azabornanes with longer substitutions at the 3''β''-position (benzoyloxys alkylphenyls, carbamoyls etc.) or with the nitrogen in the position it would be on the piperidine homologues (''i.e.'' arrangements of differing locations for the nitrogens being either [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|distal or proximal]] within the terms required to facilitate the framework of the compound to a correlative proportion, functional for the given moiety), were not synthesized, despite conclusions that the nitrogen to phenyl length was the issue at variance enough to be the interfering factor for the proper binding of the compressed topology of the azabornane.

=== Piperidine [[Homology (chemistry)|homologues]] (inner two-carbon bridge excised) ===
Piperidine homologues had comparable affinity &amp; potency spreads to their respective phenyltropane analogues. Without as much of a discrepancy between the differing isomers of the piperidine class with respect to affinity and binding values as had in the phenyltropanes.

These compounds include [[transition metal]]s in their heteroatomic conformation, unlike [[List of phenyltropanes#η6-3β-(transition metal complexed phenyl)tropanes|non-radiolabel intended chelates]] where their element is chosen for intrinsic affectation to binding and function, these are tagged on by a "tail" (or similar) with a sufficient spacer to remain separated from known binding properties and instead are meant to add radioactivity enough to be easily tracked via observation methods that utilize radioactivity. As for anomalies of binding within the spectrum of the under-written kinds just mentioned: other factors not otherwise considered to account for its relatively lower potency, "compound '''89c'''" is posited to protrude forward at the aryl place on its moiety toward the MAT ligand acceptor site in a manner detrimental to its efficacy. That is considered due to the steric bulk of the eight-position "tail" chelate substituted constituent, overreaching the means by which it was intended to be isolated from binding factors upon a tail, and ultimately nonetheless, interfering with its ability to bind. However, to broach this discrepancy, decreasing of the nitrogen tether at the eight position by a single methylene unit ('''89d''') was shown to bring the potency of the analogous compound to the expected, substantially higher, potency: The ''N''-methyl analog of '''89c''' having an IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of 1.09 ± 0.02 @ DAT &amp; 2.47 ± 0.14 nM @ SERT; making '''89c''' upwards of thirty-three times weaker at those MAT uptake sites.{{efn|&lt;ref name="Singh2" /&gt; ←[https://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/pdf/cocaineanalogs.pdf#31 Page #955 (31st page of article)] 1st (left) column, 2nd ¶}}

== Select annotations of above ==
Phenyltropanes can be grouped by "N substitution" "Stereochemistry" "2-substitution" &amp; by the nature of the 3-phenyl group substituent X.&lt;br /&gt;
Often this has dramatic effects on selectivity, potency, and duration, also toxicity, since phenyltropanes are highly versatile. For more examples of interesting phenyltropanes, see some of the more recent patents, e.g. {{US Patent|6329520}}, {{US Patent|7011813}}, {{US Patent|6531483}}, and {{US Patent|7291737}}.

Potency ''in vitro'' should not be confused with the actual dosage, as [[pharmacokinetic]] factors can have a dramatic influence on what proportion of an administered dose actually gets to the target binding sites in the brain, and so a drug that is very potent at binding to the target may nevertheless have only moderate potency ''in vivo''. For example, [[RTI-336]] requires a higher dosage than cocaine. Accordingly, the active dosage of [[RTI-386]] is exceedingly poor despite the relatively high ex vivo [[Dopamine transporter|DAT]] binding affinity.

== Sister substances ==
Many molecular drug structures have exceedingly similar pharmarcology to phenyltropanes, yet by certain technicalities do not fit the phenyltropane moniker. These are namely classes of dopaminergic cocaine analogues that are in the [[piperidine]] class (a category that includes [[methylphenidate]]) or [[benztropine]] class (such as [[Difluoropine]]: which is extremely close to fitting the criteria of being a phenyltropane.) Whereas other potent [[Dopamine reuptake inhibitor|DRIs]] are far removed from being in the phenyltropane structural family, such as [[Benocyclidine]] or [[Vanoxerine]].
&lt;div style="background-color: #CFCFCF; border:10px solid #666666"&gt;
See: [[List of cocaine analogues]]

Most any variant with a tropane locant—3-''β'' (or ''α'') connecting linkage differing from, ''e.g.'' longer than, a single methylene unit (''i.e.'' "phenyl"), including alkylphenyls (see the styrene analog, first image given in example below) is more correctly a "cocaine analogue" proper, and not a phenyltropane. Especially if this linkage imparts a [[sodium channel blocker]] functionality to the molecule:&lt;br&gt;

A '''macrocyst''' is an aggregate of cells of [[Dictyostelid|Dictyostelids]] formed during [[sexual reproduction]] enclosed in a [[Cell wall|cellulose wall]].&lt;ref name="Brock"&gt;{{cite book |author = Brock|title = Biology of Microorganisms|edition = 11th|publisher = Prentice Hall|year = 2006|isbn = 9780131443297|editor-last = Madigan|editor-first = Michael T.|editor-last2 = Martinko|editor-first2 = John M|first = T|page = 468|nopp = }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|468}}

If two [[Amoeba|amoebae]] of different [[Mating type|mating types]] are present in a dark and wet environment, they can fuse during aggregation to form a [[giant cell]]. The giant cell will then engulf the other cells in the aggregate and encase the whole aggregate in a thick, cellulose wall to protect it. This is known as a macrocyst. Inside the macrocyst, the giant cell divides first through [[meiosis]], then through [[mitosis]] to produce many [[haploid]] amoebae that will be released to feed as normal amoebae would.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3905">The '''Marshall Sklare Award''' is an annual honor of the [[Association for the Social Scientific Study of Jewry]] (ASSJ). The ASSJ seeks to recognize "a senior scholar who has made a significant scholarly contribution to the social scientific study of Jewry." In most cases, the recipient has given a scholarly address. In recent years, the honored scholar has presented the address at the annual meeting of the [[Association for Jewish Studies]].

The award is named in memory of the "founding father of American Jewish sociology" [[Marshall Sklare]] (1921-1992), who had been Klutznick Family Professor of Contemporary Jewish Studies and Sociology at [[Brandeis University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE3D81431F930A25750C0A964958260 |title=Marshall Sklare, 70, an Authority On Sociology of American Jewry - New York Times |accessdate=2008-01-27 |format= |work=The New York Times | date=1992-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Medical microbiology ''', the large subset of [[microbiology]] that is [[applied science|applied]] to [[medicine]], is a branch of medical science concerned with the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of [[infection|infectious disease]]s.  In addition, this field of science studies various clinical applications of microbes for the improvement of health.  There are four kinds of [[microorganism]]s that cause infectious disease: [[bacteria]], [[fungi]], [[Parasitism|parasites]] and [[virus]]es, and one type of infectious protein called  [[prion]].

A medical [[microbiologist]] studies the characteristics of [[pathogen]]s, their modes of transmission, mechanisms of infection and growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jcm.asm.org/content/48/10/3465.full.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803235551/http://jcm.asm.org/content/48/10/3465.full.pdf |archivedate=2016-08-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Using this information, a treatment can be devised.  Medical microbiologists often serve as consultants for [[physicians]], providing identification of pathogens and suggesting treatment options.
Other tasks may include the identification of potential health risks to the community or monitoring the evolution of potentially [[virulent]] or resistant strains of microbes, educating the community and assisting in the design of health practices.  They may also assist in preventing or controlling [[epidemics]] and outbreaks of disease.
Not all medical microbiologists study microbial [[pathology]]; some study common, non-pathogenic species to determine whether their properties can be used to develop [[antibiotics]] or other treatment methods.

[[Epidemiology]], the study of the patterns, causes, and effects of [[health]] and [[disease]] conditions in populations, is an important part of medical microbiology, although the clinical aspect of the field primarily focuses on the presence and growth of microbial infections in individuals, their effects on the human body, and the methods of treating those infections. In this respect the entire field, as an applied science, can be conceptually subdivided into academic and clinical subspecialties, although in reality there is a fluid continuum between '''public health microbiology''' and '''clinical microbiology''', just as the state of the art in [[medical laboratory|clinical laboratories]] depends on continual improvements in academic medicine and [[research institute|research laboratories]]. 

==History ==
[[File:Anthonie van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723). Natuurkundige te Delft Rijksmuseum SK-A-957.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]] was the first to observe microorganisms using a microscope.]]
In 1676, [[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]] observed bacteria and other microorganisms, using a single-lens [[microscope]] of his own design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Frank N. Egerton |date=2006| doi=10.1890/0012-9623(2006)87[47:AHOTES]2.0.CO;2| volume=87| pages=47| title=A History of the Ecological Sciences, Part 19: Leeuwenhoek's Microscopic Natural History| journal=Bulletin of the Ecological Society of America}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1796, [[Edward Jenner]] developed a method using [[cowpox]] to successfully immunize a child against smallpox.  The same principles are used for developing [[vaccines]] today.

Following on from this, in 1857 [[Louis Pasteur]] also designed vaccines against several diseases such as [[anthrax]], fowl [[cholera]] and [[rabies]] as well as [[pasteurization]] for food preservation.&lt;ref name=Brock&gt;{{cite book | editor = Madigan M| editor2 = Martinko J | title = Brock Biology of Microorganisms | edition = 13th | publisher = Pearson Education | date = 2006 | isbn = 0-321-73551-X |page = 1096}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1867 [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Joseph Lister]] is considered to be the father of [[antiseptic]] surgery.  By sterilizing the instruments with diluted [[carbolic acid]] and using it to clean wounds, post-operative infections were reduced, making surgery safer for patients.

In the years between 1876 and 1884 [[Robert Koch]] provided much insight into infectious diseases. He was one of the first scientists to focus on the isolation of bacteria in [[Microbiological culture|pure culture]].  This gave rise to the [[germ theory]], a certain microorganism being responsible for a certain disease. He developed a series of criteria around this that have become known as the [[Koch's postulates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Robert Koch: a life in medicine and bacteriology |author=Brock TD |author-link=Thomas D. Brock |date=1999 |publisher=American Society of Microbiology Press |location=Washington DC |isbn=1-55581-143-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major milestone in medical microbiology is the [[Gram stain]]. In 1884 [[Hans Christian Gram]] developed the method of staining bacteria to make them more visible and differentiable under a microscope. This technique is widely used today.

In 1929 [[Alexander Fleming]] developed the most commonly used antibiotic substance both at the time and now: [[penicillin]].

[[DNA sequencing]], a method developed by [[Walter Gilbert]] and [[Frederick Sanger]] in 1977,&lt;ref&gt;Sanger F, Nicklen S, Coulson AR (1977) DNA sequencing with chain-terminating inhibitors" ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'' 74:5463-5467.&lt;/ref&gt; caused a rapid change the development of [[vaccine]]s, medical treatments and diagnostic methods. Some of these include synthetic [[insulin]] which was produced in 1979 using [[recombinant DNA]] and the first genetically engineered vaccine was created in 1986 for [[hepatitis B]].

In 1995 a team at [[The Institute for Genomic Research]] sequenced the first bacterial [[genome]]; ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Fleischmann R, Adams M, White O, Clayton R, Kirkness E, Kerlavage A, Bult C, Tomb J, Dougherty B, Merrick J, al. e (1995) Whole-genome random sequencing and assembly of Haemophilus influenzae Rd" ''Science'' 269:496-512.&lt;/ref&gt;  A few months later, the first [[eukaryotic]] genome was completed. This would prove invaluable for diagnostic techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Prescott LM, Harley JP, Klein DA (2005) Microbiology: McGraw-Hill Higher Education.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes and transmission of infectious diseases ==
{{See also|Infection}}

Infections may be caused by [[bacteria]], [[virus]]es, [[fungi]], and [[parasite]]s. The pathogen that causes the disease may be exogenous (acquired from an external source; environmental, animal or other people, e.g. [[Influenza]]) or endogenous (from normal flora e.g. [[candidiasis]]).&lt;ref name=Baron&gt;{{cite book| last=Washington| first=JA| editor-first=S| editor-last=Baron| title=Medical Microbiology| edition=4th| publisher=University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston| date=1996| chapter=10 Principles of Diagnosis| isbn=0-9631172-1-1| chapterurl=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK8014/| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160613091205/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK8014/| archivedate=2016-06-13| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site at which a microbe enters the body is referred to as the portal of entry.&lt;ref name=Bittar&gt;{{cite book |last=Siebeling|first=RJ|editor-first=E, B |editor-last=Bittar, Neville |title=Microbiology| publisher = Elsevier| date = 1998|chapter=Chapter 7 Principles of bacterial pathogenesis | isbn = 1-55938-814-5|page = 87}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include the [[respiratory tract]], [[GI tract|gastrointestinal tract]], [[genitourinary tract]], [[skin]], and [[mucous membranes]].&lt;ref name=Rhinehart&gt;{{cite book | author = Rhinehart E| author2 = Friedman M| title = Infection control in home care| publisher = Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning| date = 1999 | isbn = 0-8342-1143-2|page = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The portal of entry for a specific microbe is normally dependent on how it travels from its natural habitat to the host.&lt;ref name=Bittar /&gt;

There are various ways in which disease can be transmitted between individuals. 
These include:&lt;ref name=Bittar /&gt;
* Direct contact - Touching an infected host, including [[Transmission (medicine)#Sexual transmission|sexual contact]]
* Indirect contact - Touching a contaminated surface
* [[Transmission (medicine)#Droplet contact|Droplet contact]] - Coughing or sneezing
* [[Fecal–oral route]] - Ingesting contaminated food or water sources
* Airborne transmission - Pathogen carrying [[Spore#Dispersal|spores]]
* [[Vector borne transmission|Vector transmission]] - An organism that does not cause disease itself but transmits infection by conveying pathogens from one host to another 
* [[Fomite|Fomite transmission]] - An inanimate object or substance capable of carrying infectious germs or parasites
* Environmental - Hospital-acquired infection ([[Nosocomial|Nosocomial infections]])

Like other pathogens, viruses use these methods of transmission to enter the body, but viruses differ in that they must also enter into the host's actual cells. Once the virus has gained access to the host's cells, the virus' genetic material ([[RNA]] or [[DNA]]) must be [[Viral replication|introduced to the cell]].  Replication between viruses is greatly varied and depends on the type of genes involved in them. Most DNA viruses assemble in the nucleus while most RNA viruses develop solely in cytoplasm.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts RJ, "Fish pathology, 3rd Edition", Elsevier Health Sciences, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Baron1&gt;{{cite book|last=Roizman|first=B|editor-first=S|editor-last=Baron|title=Medical Microbiology|edition=4th|publisher=University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston|date=1996|chapter=42 Multiplication|isbn=0-9631172-1-1|chapterurl=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK8181/|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180511212551/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK8181/|archivedate=2018-05-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mechanisms for infection, proliferation, and persistence of a virus in cells of the host are crucial for its survival. For example, some diseases such as [[measles]] employ a strategy whereby it must spread to a series of hosts. In these forms of viral infection, the illness is often treated by the [[Cell-mediated immunity|body's own immune response]], and therefore the virus is required to disperse to new hosts before it is destroyed by [[Immune system|immunological resistance]] or host death.&lt;ref name= Hilleman&gt;{{cite journal |author= Hilleman M| title= Strategies and mechanisms for host and pathogen survival in acute and persistent viral infections| journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America| volume=101| pages=14560–14566| date=October 2004| doi=10.1073/pnas.0404758101| pmc=521982| pmid=15297608}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast, some infectious agents such as the [[Feline leukemia virus]], are able to withstand immune responses and are capable of achieving long-term residence within an individual host, whilst also retaining the ability to spread into successive hosts.&lt;ref name= Greggs&gt;{{cite journal |author = Greggs WM| author2 = Clouser CL |author3 = Patterson SE|author4 = Manksy LM| title= Discovery of drugs that possess activity against feline leukemia virus| journal= Journal of General Virology| volume=93| issue=4| pages=900–905| date=April 2012| doi=10.1099/vir.0.039909-0 |url=http://jgv.sgmjournals.org/content/93/Pt_4/900.full|pmc=3542715}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diagnostic tests ==
{{main|Diagnostic microbiology}}
Identification of an infectious agent for a minor illness can be as simple as clinical presentation; such as [[gastrointestinal disease]] and skin infections.  In order to make an educated estimate as to which microbe could be causing the disease, epidemiological factors need to be considered; such as the patient's likelihood of exposure to the suspected organism and the presence and prevalence of a microbial strain in a community.

Diagnosis of infectious disease is nearly always initiated by consulting the patient's medical history and conducting a physical examination. More detailed identification techniques involve [[microbial culture]], [[microscopy]], [[Infectious disease#Biochemical tests|biochemical tests]] and [[genotyping]]. Other less common techniques (such as [[X-rays]], [[CAT scans]], [[PET scans]] or [[NMR]]) are used to produce images of internal abnormalities resulting from the growth of an infectious agent.

=== Microbial culture ===
[[Image:K pneumoniae M morganii providencia styphimuriuma.JPG|thumb|200px|Four [[nutrient agar]] plates growing colonies of common [[Gram negative]] bacteria.]]
[[Microbiological culture]] is the primary method used for isolating infectious disease for study in the laboratory. Tissue or fluid samples are tested for the presence of a specific [[pathogen]], which is determined by growth in a selective or differential [[Growth medium|medium]].

The 3 main types of media used for testing are:&lt;ref name=Nester&gt;{{cite book | author = Nester E| author2 = Anderson D| author3 = Evans Roberts, C | author4=Nester M| title = Microbiology: A human perspective| publisher = McGraw Hill| date = 2009 | isbn = 1-55938-814-5|pages = 336–337}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Solid culture: A solid surface is created using a mixture of nutrients, salts and [[agar]]. A single microbe on an agar plate can then grow into colonies (clones where cells are identical to each other) containing thousands of cells. These are primarily used to culture bacteria and fungi.
* Liquid culture: Cells are grown inside a liquid media. Microbial growth is determined by the time taken for the liquid to form a [[colloidal suspension]]. This technique is used for diagnosing parasites and detecting [[mycobacteria]].&lt;ref name="Møller"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Møller M| author2= El Maghrabi R| author3= Olesen N|author4= Thomsen VØ| title=Safe inoculation of blood and bone marrow for liquid culture detection of mycobacteria| journal=Occupational Medicine |volume=54 |issue=8 |pages=530–3 |date=November 2004 |pmid=15520021 |doi=10.1093/occmed/kqh106}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cell culture: Human or animal [[cell culture]]s are infected with the microbe of interest. These cultures are then observed to determine the effect the microbe has on the cells. This technique is used for identifying viruses.

=== Microscopy ===
[[Microbiological culture|Culture techniques]] will often use a microscopic examination to help in the identification of the microbe. Instruments such as [[compound light microscope]]s can be used to assess critical aspects of the organism. This can be performed immediately after the sample is taken from the patient and is used in conjunction with biochemical staining techniques, allowing for resolution of cellular features. [[Electron microscopes]] and [[fluorescence microscope]]s are also used for observing microbes in greater detail for research.&lt;ref&gt;Madigan MT (2009) Brock Biology of Microorganisms: Pearson/Benjamin Cummings.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biochemical tests ===
Fast and relatively simple [[Infectious disease#Biochemical tests|biochemical tests]] can be used to identify infectious agents. For bacterial identification, the use of [[metabolic]] or enzymatic characteristics are common due to their ability to ferment [[carbohydrates]] in patterns characteristic of their [[genus]] and [[species]]. Acids, alcohols and gases are usually detected in these tests when bacteria are grown in [[Growth Medium|selective liquid or solid media]], as mentioned above. In order to perform these tests en masse, automated machines are used.  These machines perform multiple biochemical tests simultaneously, using cards with several wells containing different dehydrated chemicals.  The microbe of interest will react with each chemical in a specific way, aiding in its identification.

[[Serological]] methods are highly sensitive, specific and often extremely rapid laboratory tests used to identify different types of microorganisms. The tests are based upon the ability of an [[antibody]] to bind specifically to an [[antigen]]. The antigen (usually a protein or carbohydrate made by an infectious agent) is bound by the antibody, allowing this type of test to be used for organisms other than bacteria. This binding then sets off a chain of events that can be easily and definitively observed, depending on the test. More complex serological techniques are known as [[immunoassays]]. Using a similar basis as described above, immunoassays can detect or measure antigens from either infectious agents or the proteins generated by an infected host in response to the infection.&lt;ref name=Nester/&gt;

=== Polymerase chain reaction ===

[[Polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) assays are the most commonly used molecular technique to detect and study microbes.&lt;ref name=Mackay&gt;{{cite book | author = Mackay I | title = Real-time PCR in Microbiology: From Diagnosis to Characterisation| publisher = Horizon Scientific Press  | date = 2007 | isbn = 9781904455189|pages = 1–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; As compared to other methods, sequencing and analysis is definitive, reliable, accurate, and fast.&lt;ref name=Viljoen&gt;{{cite book | editor = Viljoen GJ| editor2 = Nel LH| editor3 = Crowther JR | title = Molecular Diagnostic PCR Handbook| publisher = Springer| date = 2005 | isbn = 978-1-4020-3404-6 |page = 58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, [[quantitative PCR]] is the primary technique used, as this method provides faster data compared to a standard PCR assay. For instance, traditional PCR techniques require the use of [[gel electrophoresis]] to visualize amplified DNA molecules after the reaction has finished. [[quantitative PCR]] does not require this, as the detection system uses [[Fluorometer|fluorescence]] and [[DNA probe|probes]] to detect the DNA molecules as they are being amplified.&lt;ref name=Tang&gt;{{cite book | author = Tang YW| author2 = Persing DH| title = Encyclopedia of Microbiology| publisher = Oxford Academic Press  | date = 2009 | isbn =  978-0-12-373944-5 |pages = 308–320}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this, [[quantitative PCR]] also removes the risk of contamination that can occur during standard PCR procedures (carrying over PCR product into subsequent PCRs).&lt;ref name=Mackay /&gt; Another advantage of using PCR to detect and study microbes is that the DNA sequences of newly discovered infectious microbes or strains can be compared to those already listed in databases, which in turn helps to increase understanding of which organism is causing the infectious disease and thus what possible methods of treatment could be used.&lt;ref name=Viljoen /&gt; This technique is the current standard for detecting viral infections such as [[AIDS]] and [[hepatitis]].

== Treatments ==

Once an infection has been diagnosed and identified, suitable treatment options must be assessed by the physician and consulting medical microbiologists. Some infections can be dealt with by the body's own [[immune system]], but more serious infections are treated with [[antimicrobial]] drugs. [[Pathogenic bacteria|Bacterial infections]] are treated with [[antibacterials]] (often called antibiotics) whereas [[Mycosis|fungal]] and [[Viral disease|viral]] infections are treated with [[Antifungal medication|antifungals]] and [[Antiviral drug|antivirals]] respectively. A broad class of drugs known as [[antiparasitics]] are used to treat [[parasitic diseases]].

Medical microbiologists often make treatment recommendations to the patient's physician based on the strain of [[microbe]] and its [[antibiotic resistance]]s, the site of infection, the potential [[toxicity]] of  antimicrobial drugs and any [[drug allergies]] the patient has.

[[File:Antibiotic sensitvity and resistance.JPG|right|thumb|Antibiotic resistance tests:  bacteria in the culture on the left are sensitive to the antibiotics contained in the white, paper discs. Bacteria in the culture on the right are resistant to most of the antibiotics.]]
In addition to drugs being specific to a certain kind of organism (bacteria, fungi, etc.), some drugs are specific to a certain [[genus]] or [[species]] of organism, and will not work on other organisms. Because of this specificity, medical microbiologists must consider the effectiveness of certain antimicrobial drugs when making recommendations. Additionally, [[strain (biology)|strains]] of an organism may be resistant to a certain drug or class of drug, even when it is typically effective against the species. These strains, termed resistant strains, present a serious public health concern of growing importance to the medical industry as the spread of [[antibiotic resistance]] worsens. [[Antimicrobial resistance]] is an increasingly problematic issue that leads to millions of deaths every year.&lt;ref name="WHO 2014"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.who.int/drugresistance/documents/surveillancereport/en/ | title=Antimicrobial resistance: global report on surveillance 2014 | publisher=WHO | work=WHO | date=April 2014 | accessdate=May 9, 2015 | author=WHO | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150515101620/http://www.who.int/drugresistance/documents/surveillancereport/en/ | archivedate=May 15, 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst drug resistance typically involves microbes chemically inactivating an antimicrobial drug or a cell mechanically stopping the uptake of a drug, another form of drug resistance can arise from the formation of [[biofilm]]s. Some bacteria are able to form biofilms by adhering to surfaces on implanted devices such as catheters and prostheses and creating an [[Biofilm#Extracellular matrix|extracellular matrix]] for other cells to adhere to.&lt;ref&gt;Vickery K, Hu H, Jacombs AS, Bradshaw DA, Deva AK (2013) A review of bacterial biofilms and their role in device-associated infection. Healthcare Infection .&lt;/ref&gt; This provides them with a stable environment from which the bacteria can disperse and infect other parts of the host. Additionally, the extracellular matrix and dense outer layer of bacterial cells can protect the inner bacteria cells from antimicrobial drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author=Stewart PS| author2=Costerton JW |title=Antibiotic resistance of bacteria in biofilms |journal=Lancet |volume=358 |issue=9276 |pages=135–8 |date=July 2001 |pmid=11463434 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(01)05321-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medical microbiology is not only about diagnosing and treating disease, it also involves the study of beneficial microbes.  Microbes have been shown to be helpful in combating infectious disease and promoting health. Treatments can be developed from microbes, as demonstrated by Alexander Fleming's discovery of [[penicillin]] as well as the development of new antibiotics from the bacterial genus [[Streptomyces#Medicine|Streptomyces]] among many others.&lt;ref&gt;Taguchi T, Yabe M, Odaki H, Shinozaki M, Metsä-Ketelä M, Arai T, Okamoto S, Ichinose K (2013) Biosynthetic Conclusions from the Functional Dissection of Oxygenases for Biosynthesis of Actinorhodin and Related Streptomyces Antibiotics. Chemistry &amp; Biology 20:510-520.&lt;/ref&gt;  Not only are microorganisms a source of antibiotics but some may also act as [[probiotics]] to provide health benefits to the host, such as providing better gastrointestinal health or inhibiting pathogens.&lt;ref&gt;Williams NT (2010) Probiotics. American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy 67:449-458.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3618">The '''moral high ground''', in ethical or political parlance, refers to the status of being respected for remaining moral, and adhering to and upholding a universally recognized standard of justice or goodness.
:"Parties seeking the moral high ground simply refuse to act in ways which are not viewed as legitimate and morally defensible."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colorado.edu/conflict/peace/treatment/moralhg.htm Moral High Ground] - International Online Training Program On Intractable Conflict - Conflict Research Consortium, University of Colorado, USA&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
Holding the moral high ground can be used to legitimize [[political movements]], notably [[nonviolent resistance]], especially in the face of violent opposition,&lt;ref&gt;R. L. Johnson, ''Gandhi's Experiment with Truth'' (2006) p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; and has been used by [[civil disobedience]] movements around the world to garner sympathy and support from society.

Similarly, 21st century states may refrain from declaring war in order to retain the moral high ground – though the cynic will observe that [[realpolitik]] still leads to wars being ''fought'', only without declarations.&lt;ref&gt;Y. Dinstein, ''War, Aggression and Self-Defence'' (2005) p. 326&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business==
Economist and social critic [[Robert H. Frank]] challenged the idea that prosocial behavior was necessarily deleterious in business in his book ''What Price the Moral High Ground?''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pupress.princeton.edu/titles/7602.html What Price the Moral High Ground: Ethical Dilemmas in Competitive Environments] - Robert H. Frank, {{ISBN|0-691-00672-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He argued that socially responsible firms often reap unexpected benefits even in highly competitive environments, because their commitment to principle makes them more attractive as partners to do business with.&lt;ref&gt;A. Teniati, ''The Collaborative Enterprise'' (2010) p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Everyday use==

In everyday use a person may take the perspective of the 'moral high ground' in order to produce a [[critique]] of something, or merely to win an argument. This perspective is sometimes associated to [[snobbery]] but may also be a legitimate way of taking up a stance.

Social sciences or philosophies are sometimes accused of taking the 'moral high ground' because they are often inherently interested in the project of human freedom and justice. The traditional project of education itself may be seen as defending a type of moral high ground from [[popular culture]], perhaps by using [[critical pedagogy]]: its proponents may themselves be accused (rightly or wrongly) of seeking a false and unjustified sense of superiority thereby.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Shippey, ''Tolkien'' (2001) p. 308&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feminism==
Kate Fillion considered that in the wake of [[second-wave feminism]] "assumptions about female moral superiority pervade the public discourse", placing women as "comrades on the moral high ground, pitted against a common adversary who dwells in the shadowy depths far below".&lt;ref&gt;Kate Fillion, ''Lip Service'' (1997) p. 305 and p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Robert Lowell]] took the moral high ground, not once, but twice, with separate American presidents, in protesting US militarism.&lt;ref&gt;Seamus Heaney, '' Finders Keepers'' (2002) p. 205-10&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Mandelson]] considered that [[Tony Blair]] was "good at taking the high ground and throwing himself off it".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Simon Jenkins, ''Thatcher and Sons'' (2007) p. 225&lt;/ref&gt;

In regard to agriculture, [[Abiotic stress]] is stress produced by '''natural environment factors''' such as extreme [[temperature]]s, [[wind]], [[drought]], and [[salinity]]. Humankind doesn’t have much control over abiotic stresses. It is very important for humans to understand how stress factors affect plants and other living things so that we can take some preventative measures. 

Preventative measures are the only way that humans can protect themselves and their possessions from abiotic stress. There are many different types of abiotic stressors, and several methods that humans can use to reduce the negative effects of stress on living things.

== Cold ==
One of the types of Abiotic Stress is [[cold]]. This has a huge impact on farmers. Cold impacts crop growers all over the world in every single country. Yields suffer and farmers also suffer huge losses because the weather is just too cold to produce crops (Xiong &amp; Zhu, 2001). 

Humans have planned the planting of our crops around the seasons. Even though the seasons are fairly predictable, there are always unexpected storms, heat waves, or cold snaps that can ruin our growing seasons.(Suzuki &amp; Mittler, 2006)

ROS stands for reactive oxygen species. ROS plays a large role in mediating events through transduction. Cold stress was shown to enhance the transcript, protein, and activity of different ROS-scavenging enzymes. Low temperature stress has also been shown to increase the H2 O2 accumulation in cells.(Suzuki &amp; Mittler, 2006)

Plants can be acclimated to low or even freezing temperatures. If a plant can go through a mild cold spell this activates the cold-responsive genes in the plant. Then if the temperature drops again, the genes will have conditioned the plant to cope with the low temperature. Even below freezing temperatures can be survived if the proper genes are activated (Suzuki &amp; Mittler, 2006).

== Heat ==
[[Heat]] stress has been shown to cause problems in [[mitochondrial]] functions and can result in [[oxidative]] damage. Activators of heat stress receptors and defenses are thought to be related to ROS. Heat is another thing that plants can deal with if they have the proper pretreatment. This means that if the temperature gradually warms up the plants are going to be better able to cope with the change. A sudden long temperature increase could cause damage to the plant because their cells and receptors haven’t had enough time to prepare for a major temperature change.

Heat stress can also have a detrimental effect on plant reproduction. Temperatures 10 degrees Celsius or more above normal growing temperatures can have a bad effect on several plant reproductive functions. Pollen [[meiosis]], pollen germination, [[ovule]] development, ovule viability, development of the embryo, and seedling growth are all aspects of plant reproduction that are affected by heat.(Cross, McKay, McHughen, &amp; Bonham-Smith, 2003)

There have been many studies on the effects of heat on plant reproduction. One study on plants was conducted on [[Canola]] plants at 28 degrees Celsius, the result was decreased plant size, but the plants were still fertile. Another experiment was conducted on Canola plants at 32 degrees Celsius, this resulted in the production of sterile plants. Plants seem to be more easily damaged by extreme temperatures during the late flower to early seed development stage (Cross, McKay, McHughen, &amp; Bonham-Smith, 2003).

== Wind ==
Wind is a huge part of abiotic stress. There is simply no way to stop the wind from blowing. This is definitely a bigger problem in some parts of the world than in others. Barren areas such as deserts are very susceptible to natural wind erosion. These types of areas don’t have any vegetation to hold the soil particles in place. Once the wind starts to blow the soil around, there is nothing to stop the process. The only chance for the soil to stay in place is if the wind doesn’t blow. This is usually not an option.

Plant growth in windblown areas is very limited. Because the soil is constantly moving, there is no opportunity for plants to develop a root system. Soil that blows a lot usually is very dry also. This leaves little [[nutrient]]s to promote plant growth.

Farmland is typically very susceptible to wind erosion. Most farmers do not plant cover crops during the seasons when their main crops are not in the fields. They simply leave the ground open and uncovered. When the soil is dry, the top layer becomes similar to powder. When the wind blows, the powdery top layer of the farmland is picked up and carried for miles. This is the exact scenario that occurred during the “Dust Bowl” in the 30’s. The combination of drought and poor farming practices allowed the wind to moves thousands of tons of dirt from one area to the next.

Wind is one of the factors that humans can really have some control over. Simply practice good farming practices. Don’t leave ground bare and without any type of vegetation. During dry seasons it is especially important to have the land covered because dry soil moves much easier than wet soil in the wind.

When soil is not blowing due to the wind, conditions are much better for plant growth. Plants cannot grow in a soil that is constantly blowing. Their root systems do not have time to be established. Also, when soil particles are blowing they wear away at the plants that they run into. Plants are essentially “sand blasted.”

== Drought ==
Drought is very detrimental to all types of plant growth. When there is no water in the soil there are not very many nutrients to support plant growth. Drought also enhances the effects of wind. When drought occurs the soil becomes very dry and light. The wind picks up this dry dirt and carries it away. This action severely degrades the soil and creates a poor condition for growing plants.

== Adaptation of plants ==
Plants have been exposed to the elements for thousands of years. During this time they have evolved in order to lessen the effects of abiotic stress. Signal transduction is the mechanism in plants that is responsible for the adaptation of plants (Xiong &amp; Zhu, 2001). Many signaling transduction networks have been discovered and studied in microbial and animal systems. There is limited knowledge in the plant field because it is very difficult to find exactly which phenotypes in the plant are affected by stressors. These phenotypes are very valuable to the researchers. They need to know the phenotypes so that they can create a method to screen for mutant genes. Mutants are the key to finding signaling pathways in living creatures.

&lt;nowiki&gt;Animals and microbes easier to run tests on because they show a reaction fairly quickly when a stress factor is put on them, this leads to the isolation of the specific gene.  There have been decades of research on the effects of temperature, drought, and salinity, but not very many answers.&lt;/nowiki&gt;

== Receptors ==
The part of the plants, animal, or microbe that first senses an abiotic stress factor is a receptor. Once a signal is picked up by a receptor, signals are transmitted intercellularly and then they activate nuclear transcription to get the effects of a certain set of genes. These activated genes  allow the plant to respond to the stress that it is experiencing. Even though none of the receptors for cold, drought, salinity or the stress hormone abscisic acid in plants is known for sure, the knowledge that we have today shows that receptor-like protein kinases, two-component histidine kinases, as well as G-protein receptors may be the possible sensors of these different signals.

Receptor like kinases can be found in plants as well as animals. There are many more RLKs in plants than there are in animals. They are also a little bit different. Unlike animal RLKs that usually possess tyrosine signature sequences, plant RLKs have serine or threonine signature sequences (Xiong &amp; Zhu, 2001).

== Genetically Modified Plants ==
Plants are most commonly modified to be resistant to specific [[herbicide]]s or [[pathogen]]s, but we have the technology to modify plants in order to make them resistant to specific abiotic stressors. Cold, heat, drought, or salt are all factors that could possibly be defended against by genetically modified plants.

Some plants could have genes added to them from other species of plants that have a resistance to a specific stress. Plants implanted with these genes would then become transgenic plants because they have the genes from another species of plant in them. Scientists first have to isolate the specific gene in a plant that is responsible for its resistance. The gene would then be taken out of the plant and put into another plant. The plant that is injected with the new resistant gene would have a resistance to an abiotic stressor and be able to tolerate a wider range of conditions (Weil, 2005).

This process of creating transgenic plants could have a huge impact on our nation’s economy. If plants could be genetically engineered to be resistant to a wider variety of stress, crop yields would skyrocket. With the expansion of town and cities there is a decreasing number of farm acres. Although the farm acres are being built on, the number of people consuming agriculture products is going up. Ethanol is also responsible for using much more of the corn that is grown here in the U.S. The production of this fuel has put a strain on the corn market. Prices of corn have gone up and this price is having a negative impact on the people who feed animals using corn. The combination of reduced acres of farmland and a higher demand on crops have left producers and consumers in a severe dilemma. The only solution to this problem is to keep getting higher and higher yields from the cropland that we have left.

Genetically modified plants are a good answer to the problem of not enough crops to go around. These plants can be engineered to be resistant to all types of abiotic stress. This would eliminate [[crop yield]] loss due to extreme temperatures, drought, wind, or salinity. The consumers of crops would enjoy a little bit lower prices because the demand on them would be a little lower.

The [[Midwest]]ern U.S. is experiencing a severe drought. Farmers are being limited on how much they can irrigate due to the shortage of water. There is also very little rain during the growing season so the crops do not yield very well. This problem could be solved by genetically modifying plants to become more drought resistant. If plants could use less water and produce yields that are superior or equal to current ones, it would be better for the people and also the environment. People would enjoy an abundance of crops to consume and export for a profit. The environment would be able to have more water in its aquifers and rivers throughout the country.

Another environmental factor that would be improved would be the amount of land left for [[wildlife]]. Crops modified to be resistant to abiotic stress and other factors that decrease yields would require less land use. Producers would be able to grow enough crops on less acres if the plants were modified to produce very high yields. This would allow some of the cropland that is in use today to be set aside for wildlife. Instead of farming “fence line to fence line” farmers would be able to create large buffers in their fields. These buffers would provide a great habitat for plants and animals.

A lot of people do not like genetically modified organisms. People opposed to these modified plants often claim that they are not safe for the environment or for human consumption. There are many videos and reports in circulation that discredit the safety of genetically modified organisms. [[King Corn (film)|King Corn]] is one video that claims that corn is bad for humans to consume.

There are strict regulations and protocols that go along with genetically modifying plants. A company that specializes in producing genetically modifying organisms must put their plants through a huge variety of tests to ensure the safety of their product. Each of these tests must be passed by the product in order to produce more of the plant seeds.

When seeds are mass-produced, the fields that they are grown in have to meet specific criteria. They must have no vegetation zones around them to prevent the spread of the modified plants into the native population. The plots must be carefully labeled and marked so that the company knows exactly what is planted in the field. All of these protocols are in place to ensure the safety of the consumers and also of the environment.
Because genetically modified plants are given stress resistant genes or high yielding genes they are better for the environment. They only help create more land to be put back into natural habitats for plants and animals.

== Conclusion ==
Abiotic stress is a naturally occurring factor that cannot be controlled by humans. One example of two stressors that are complimentary to each other is wind and drought. Drought dries out the soil and kills the plants that are growing in the soil. After this occurs, the soil is left barren and dry. Wind can pick up the soil and carry for miles. Irrigation can keep this from happening, but it is not possible to irrigate some areas.

Genetically modified plants can be implemented to slow down the effects of the abiotic stressors. This allows more crops to be grown on a smaller amount of land. Less need for farmland allows some of it to be set aside for natural wildlife habitat.

Abiotic stress only poses a problem to people or the environment if they are not prepared for it. There can be steps taken by humans to lessen the effects. Plants and animals have the ability to adapt to abiotic stress over time.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It proposes the [[planetary migration|migration]] of the [[giant planet]]s from an initial compact configuration into their present positions, long after the dissipation of the initial [[protoplanetary disk]]. In this way, it differs from [[history of Solar System formation and evolution hypotheses#Reemergence of the nebular hypothesis|earlier models]] of the Solar System's formation. This planetary migration is used in [[dynamical simulation]]s of the Solar System to explain historical events including the [[Late Heavy Bombardment]] of the [[inner Solar System]], the formation of the [[Oort cloud]], and the existence of populations of [[small Solar System bodies]] including the [[Kuiper belt]], the [[Neptune trojan|Neptune]] and [[Jupiter trojan]]s, and the numerous [[resonant trans-Neptunian object]]s dominated by Neptune. Its success at reproducing many of the observed features of the Solar System means that it is widely accepted as the current most realistic model of the Solar System's early evolution,&lt;ref name="Crida2009"/&gt; although it is not universally favoured among [[planetary science|planetary scientists]]. Later research revealed a number of differences between the original Nice model's predictions and observations of the current Solar System, for example the orbits of the terrestrial planets and the asteroids, leading to its modification.

A large, dense disk of small [[silicate|rock]] and [[volatiles|ice]] [[planetesimal]]s, their total about 35 Earth masses, extended from the orbit of the outermost giant planet to some 35 AU.

Scientists understand so little about the formation of Uranus and Neptune that Levison states, "...the possibilities concerning the formation of Uranus and Neptune are almost endless."&lt;ref name="G. Jeffrey Taylor"&gt;{{cite web

However, it is suggested that this planetary system evolved in the following manner. Planetesimals at the disk's inner edge occasionally pass through [[gravity assist|gravitational encounters]] with the outermost giant planet, which change the planetesimals' orbits. The planets scatter the majority of the small icy bodies that they encounter inward, exchanging [[angular momentum]] with the scattered objects so that the planets move outwards in response, preserving the angular momentum of the system. These planetesimals then similarly scatter off the next planet they encounter, successively moving the orbits of [[Uranus]], [[Neptune]], and [[Saturn]] outwards.&lt;ref name="G. Jeffrey Taylor"/&gt; Despite the minute movement each exchange of momentum can produce, cumulatively these planetesimal encounters shift ([[Planetary migration|migrate]]) the orbits of the planets by significant amounts. This process continues until the planetesimals interact with the innermost and most massive giant planet, [[Jupiter]], whose immense gravity sends them into highly elliptical orbits or even ejects them outright from the Solar System. This, in contrast, causes Jupiter to move slightly inward.&lt;!-- want to check this ref a bit more, insert the original paper, put this paper elsewhere. --&gt;&lt;!-- as suggested in 1984 by Fernandez and Ip.&lt;ref name="Hahn05"&gt;

--&gt;

The low rate of orbital encounters governs the rate at which planetesimals are lost from the disk, and the corresponding rate of migration. After several hundreds of millions of years of slow, gradual migration, Jupiter and Saturn, the two inmost giant planets, cross their mutual 1:2 [[mean-motion resonance]]. This resonance increases their [[orbital eccentricity|orbital eccentricities]], destabilizing the entire planetary system. The arrangement of the giant planets alters quickly and dramatically.&lt;ref name="Geotimes05"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Jupiter shifts Saturn out towards its present position, and this relocation causes mutual gravitational encounters between Saturn and the two [[ice giant]]s, which propel Neptune and Uranus onto much more eccentric orbits. These ice giants then plough into the planetesimal disk, scattering tens of thousands of planetesimals from their formerly stable orbits in the outer Solar System. This disruption almost entirely scatters the primordial disk, removing 99% of its mass, a scenario which explains the modern-day absence of a dense [[trans-Neptunian object|trans-Neptunian]] population.&lt;ref name="Tsiganis05"/&gt; Some of the planetesimals are thrown into the inner Solar System, producing a sudden influx of [[impact event|impacts]] on the [[terrestrial planet]]s: the [[Late Heavy Bombardment]].&lt;ref name="Gomes05"/&gt;

Eventually, the giant planets reach their current orbital [[semi-major and semi-minor axes#Astronomy|semi-major axes]], and [[dynamical friction]] with the remaining planetesimal disc damps their eccentricities and makes the orbits of Uranus and Neptune circular again.&lt;ref name=Levinson2007/&gt;

In some 50% of the initial models of Tsiganis and colleagues, Neptune and Uranus also exchange places.&lt;ref name=Tsiganis05/&gt; An exchange of Uranus and Neptune would be consistent with models of their formation in a disk that had a surface density that declined with distance from the Sun, which predicts that the masses of the planets should also decline with distance from the Sun.&lt;ref name="Desch07-pressrelease"/&gt;

==Solar System features==
Running dynamical models of the Solar System with different initial conditions for the simulated length of the history of the Solar System will produce the various populations of objects within the Solar System. As the initial conditions of the model are allowed to vary, each population will be more or less numerous, and will have particular orbital properties. [[Mathematical proof|Proving]] a model of the evolution of the early Solar System is difficult, since the evolution cannot be directly observed.&lt;ref name="Geotimes05"/&gt; However, the success of any dynamical model can be judged by comparing the population predictions from the simulations to astronomical observations of these populations.&lt;ref name="Geotimes05"/&gt; At the present time, computer models of the Solar System that are begun with the initial conditions of the Nice scenario best match many aspects of the observed Solar System.&lt;ref name=Johnson08&gt;

===The Late Heavy Bombardment===
{{Main|Late Heavy Bombardment}}

The crater record on the [[Moon]] and on the terrestrial planets is part of the main evidence for the Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB): an intensification in the number of impactors, at about 600 million years after the Solar System's formation. In the Nice model icy planetesimals are scattered onto planet-crossing orbits when the outer disc is disrupted by Uranus and Neptune causing a sharp spike of impacts by icy objects. The migration of outer planets also causes mean-motion and [[secular resonance]]s to sweep through the inner Solar System. In the asteroid belt these excite the eccentricities of the asteroids driving them onto orbits that intersect those of the terrestrial planets causing a more extended period of impacts by stony objects and removing roughly 90% of its mass.&lt;ref name="Gomes05"/&gt; The number of [[planetesimal]]s that would reach the Moon is consistent with the crater record from the LHB.&lt;ref name="Gomes05"/&gt; However, the orbital distribution of the remaining asteroids does not match observations.&lt;ref name="Morbidelli_Basser_2010"/&gt; In the outer Solar System the impacts onto Jupiter's moons are sufficient to trigger Ganymede's differentiation but not Callisto's.&lt;ref name="Baldwin_2010"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Baldwin|first1=Emily|title=Comet impacts explain Ganymede-Callisto dichotomy|url=http://astronomynow.com/news/n1001/25galilean/|website=Astronomy Now|accessdate=23 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The impacts of icy planetesimals onto Saturn's inner moons are excessive, however, resulting in the vaporization of their ice.&lt;ref name="Nimmo_Korycansky_2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nimmo|first1=F.|last2=Korycansky|first2=D.

After Jupiter and Saturn cross the 2:1 resonance their combined gravitational influence destabilizes the Trojan co-orbital region allowing existing [[Trojan (astronomy)|Trojan]] groups in the L&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and L&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; [[Lagrange point]]s of Jupiter and Neptune to escape and new objects from the outer planetesimal disk to be captured.&lt;ref name=Levison1997&gt;

When Jupiter and Saturn are near but not in resonance the location where Jupiter passes Saturn relative to their perihelia circulates slowly. If the period of this circulation falls into resonance with the period that the trojans librate the range of their librations can increase until they escape.&lt;ref name="Morbidelli05"/&gt; When this occurs the trojan co-orbital region is "dynamically open" and objects can both escape and enter the region. Primordial trojans escape and a fraction of the numerous objects from the disrupted planetesimal disk temporarily inhabit it.&lt;ref name="Crida2009"/&gt; Later when Jupiter and Saturn orbits are farther apart the Trojan region becomes "dynamically closed", and the planetesimals in the trojan region are captured, with many remaining today.&lt;ref name="Morbidelli05"/&gt; The captured trojans have a wide range of inclinations, which had not previously been understood, due to their repeated encounters with the giant planets.&lt;ref name="Crida2009"/&gt; The libration angle and eccentricity of the simulated population also matches observations of the orbits of the [[Jupiter trojan]]s.&lt;ref name="Morbidelli05"/&gt; This mechanism of the Nice model similarly generates the [[Neptune trojan]]s.&lt;ref name="Crida2009"/&gt;

A large number of planetesimals would have also been captured in Jupiter's mean motion resonances as Jupiter migrated inward.

There were not enough interactions between [[Jupiter]] and the other planets to explain Jupiter's retinue of irregulars in the initial Nice model simulations that reproduced other aspects of the outer Solar System.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, the [[Kuiper belt]] was much denser and closer to the [[Sun]], with an outer edge at approximately 30&amp;nbsp;AU. Its inner edge would have been just beyond the orbits of [[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]], which were in turn far closer to the Sun when they formed (most likely in the range of 15–20&amp;nbsp;AU), and in opposite locations, with Uranus farther from the Sun than Neptune.&lt;ref name="Gomes05"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Levinson2007/&gt;

Gravitational encounters between the planets scatter Neptune outward into the planetesimal disk with a semi-major axis of ~28 AU and an eccentricity as high as 0.4. Neptune's high eccentricity causes its mean-motion resonances to overlap and orbits in the region between Neptune and its 2:1 mean motion resonances to become chaotic. The orbits of objects between Neptune and the edge of the planetesimal disk at this time can evolve outward onto stable low-eccentricity orbits within this region. When Neptune's eccentricity is damped by dynamical friction they become trapped on these orbits. These objects form a dynamically-cold belt, since their inclinations remain small during the short time they interact with Neptune. Later, as Neptune migrates outward on a low eccentricity orbit, objects that have been scattered outward are captured into its resonances and can have their eccentricities decline and their inclinations increase due to the [[Kozai mechanism]], allowing them to escape onto stable higher-inclination orbits. Other objects remain captured in resonance, forming the plutinos and other resonant populations. These two population are dynamically hot, with higher inclinations and eccentricities; due to their being scattered outward and the longer period these objects interact with Neptune.&lt;ref name="Levinson2007"/&gt;

This evolution of Neptune's orbit produces both resonant and non-resonant populations, an outer edge at Neptune's 2:1 resonance, and a small mass relative to the original planetesimal disk. The excess of low-inclination plutinos in other models is avoided due to Neptune being scattered outward, leaving its 3:2 resonance beyond the original edge of the planetesimal disk. The differing initial locations, with the cold classical objects originating primarily from the outer disk, and capture processes, offer explanations for the bi-modal inclination distribution and its correlation with compositions.&lt;ref name="Levinson2007"/&gt; However, this evolution of Neptune's orbit fails to account for some of the characteristics of the orbital distribution. It predicts a greater average eccentricity in classical Kuiper belt object orbits than is observed (0.10–0.13 versus 0.07) and it does not produce enough higher-inclination objects. It also cannot explain the apparent complete absence of gray objects in the cold population, although it has been suggested that color differences arise in part from surface evolution processes rather than entirely from differences in primordial composition.&lt;ref name="Levison2008"&gt;{{cite journal

The shortage of the lowest-eccentricity objects predicted in the Nice model may indicate that the cold population formed in situ. In addition to their differing orbits the hot and cold populations have but differing colors. The cold population is markedly redder than the hot, suggesting it has a different composition and formed in a different region.&lt;ref name="Levison2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv

===Scattered disc and Oort cloud===
Objects scattered outward by Neptune onto orbits with semi-major axis greater than 50 AU can be captured in resonances forming the resonant population of the [[scattered disc]], or if their eccentricities are reduced while in resonance they can escape from the resonance onto stable orbits in the scattered disc while Neptune is migrating. When Neptune's eccentricity is large its aphelion can reach well beyond its current orbit. Objects that attain perihelia close to or larger than Neptune's at this time can become detached from Neptune when its eccentricity is damped reducing its aphelion, leaving them on stable orbits in the scattered disc.&lt;ref name=Levinson2007/&gt;

Objects scattered outward by Uranus and Neptune onto larger orbits (roughly 5,000 AU) can have their perihelion raised by the galactic tide detaching them from the influence of the planets forming the inner [[Oort cloud]] with moderate inclinations. Others that reach even larger orbits can be perturbed by nearby stars forming the outer Oort cloud with isotropic inclinations. Objects scattered by Jupiter and Saturn are typically ejected from the Solar System&lt;ref name="Dones_etal_2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dones|first1=L.|last2=Weissman|first2=P.

==Modifications==
{{Main|Jumping-Jupiter scenario}}

The Nice model has undergone a number of modifications since its initial publication as the understanding of the formation of the Solar System has advanced and significant differences between its predictions and observations have been identified. Hydrodynamical models of the early Solar System indicate that the orbits of the giant planets converge resulting in their capture into a series of resonances.&lt;ref name="Morbidelli_2007"/&gt; The slow approach of Jupiter and Saturn to the 2:1 resonance during their later planetesimal-driven migration can allow Mars to captured in a secular resonance that excites its eccentricity to a level that destabilizes the inner Solar System. The eccentricities of the other terrestrial planets can also be excited beyond current levels by sweeping secular resonances after the instability.&lt;ref name="Brasser_2009"/&gt; The orbital distribution of the asteroid belt is also left with an excess of high inclination objects due to secular resonances exciting inclinations and removing low inclination objects.&lt;ref name="Morbidelli_Basser_2010"/&gt; Other differences between predictions and observations included the capture of few irregular satellites by Jupiter, the vaporization of the ice from Saturn's inner moons, a shortage of high inclination objects captured in the Kuiper belt, and the recent discovery of D-type asteroids in the inner asteroid belt.

The first modifications to the Nice model were the initial positions of the giant planets. Investigations of the behavior of planets orbiting in a gas disk using hydrodynamical models reveal that the giant planets would migrate toward the Sun. If the migration continued it would have resulted in Jupiter orbiting close to the Sun like recently discovered exoplanets known as hot Jupiters. Saturn's capture in a resonance with Jupiter prevents this, however, and the later capture of the other planets results in a quadruple resonant configuration with Jupiter and Saturn in their 3:2 [[orbital resonance|resonance]].&lt;ref name=Morbidelli_2007&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morbidelli|first=Alessandro|author2=Tsiganis, Kleomenis |author3=Crida, Aurélien |author4=Levison, Harold F. |author5= Gomes, Rodney |title=Dynamics of the Giant Planets of the Solar System in the Gaseous Protoplanetary Disk and Their Relationship to the Current Orbital Architecture|journal=The Astronomical Journal|date=2007|volume=134|issue=5|pages=1790–1798|doi=10.1086/521705|arxiv= 0706.1713 |bibcode= 2007AJ....134.1790M}}&lt;/ref&gt; A late instability beginning from this configuration is possible if the outer disk contains Pluto-massed objects. The gravitational stirring of the outer planetesimal disk by these Pluto-massed objects increases their eccentricities and also results in the inward migration of the giant planets. The quadruple resonance of the giant planets is broken when secular resonances are crossed during the inward migration. A late instability similar to the original Nice model then follows. Unlike the original Nice model the timing of this instability is not sensitive to the distance between the outer planet and the planetesimal disk. The combination of resonant planetary orbits and the late instability triggered by these long distant interactions has been referred to as the [[Nice 2 model]].&lt;ref name=Levison_2011&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levison|first=Harold F.|author2=Morbidelli, Alessandro |author3=Tsiganis, Kleomenis |author4=Nesvorný, David |author5= Gomes, Rodney |title=Late Orbital Instabilities in the Outer Planets Induced by Interaction with a Self-gravitating Planetesimal Disk|journal=The Astronomical Journal|date=2011|volume=142|issue=5|page=152|doi=10.1088/0004-6256/142/5/152|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/1538-3881/142/5/152/pdf/aj_142_5_152.pdf|bibcode= 2011AJ....142..152L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second modification was the requirement that one of the ice giants encounters Jupiter, causing its semi-major axis to jump. In this [[jumping-Jupiter scenario]] an ice giant encounters Saturn and is scattered inward onto a Jupiter-crossing orbit, causing Saturn's orbit to expand; then encounters Jupiter and is scattered outward, causing Jupiter's orbit to shrink.

'''Nunatak''' was the [[British Antarctic Survey]]’s (BAS) [[Rothera Research Station]]’s house band. The five person [[Indie rock|indie]] [[rock band]] was part of a science team investigating [[climate change]] and evolutionary biology on the [[Antarctic Peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=11507002 |title=Live in the Antarctic, It's Nunatak |work=NPR |date=2 July 2007 |accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are chiefly known for their participation in [[Live Earth]] in 2007, where they were the only band to play in the event's [[Live Earth concert, Antarctica|Antarctica concert]].

==History==
The band's name is the [[Kalaallisut language|Greenlandic]] [[Nunatak|word for a mountain top protruding from an ice sheet]]. Originally, the band had named itself after a disease previously common to [[Punta Arenas]] roughly translated to "Rat Shit Death" but felt that the pronunciation of that name was less than politically correct.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

The band disbanded in 2007, as its members returned to the United Kingdom, but they reunited to perform in the [[Sanday, Orkney]] Soulka festival in 2012.&lt;ref name="NunatakReunion" /&gt;

==Live Earth==
{{main|Live Earth concert, Antarctica}}
Nunatak played the Live Earth Antarctica concert on July 7, 2007, to a "sell out" crowd of seventeen, the entire population of the Rothera Research Station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/press/featured/nunatak/about_rothera.php |title=About Rothera |work=British Antarctic Survey |year=2014 |accessdate=6 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010120835/http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/press/featured/nunatak/about_rothera.php |archivedate=10 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their participation fulfilled the event's promise to hold a concert on all seven continents. Lead singer Matt Balmer, 22, said of the event that the band "expected to spend our Antarctic winter here at Rothera quietly getting on with our work and maybe performing at the occasional Saturday night party. We could never have imagined taking part in a global concert."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nbcnews.com/id/19221919/wid/18298287 |title=Antarctic gig secured for Live Earth |work=NBC News |year=2013 |accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the buildup to the event, Director of BAS Professor [[Chris Rapley]] said:
:The need to reduce our carbon emissions to avoid serious climate change is one of the greatest challenges humans have had to confront – is a complex issue that will only be solved by us all working together – scientists, politicians and society. Right now, Antarctic scientists and our colleagues in the Arctic are taking part in International Polar Year - the biggest ever globally co-ordinated research effort – to help find the way forward. Hopefully, Live Earth will make a real difference in public awareness and attract talented young people to become scientists – it’s a cool job with a real purpose. I am looking forward to Nunatak’s appearance in the Live Earth concert inspiring young people the world over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/press/press_releases/press_release.php?id=92 |title=Press Release - Antarctica - the coolest Live Earth gig in the world |work=British Antarctic Survey |date=12 June 2007 |accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British Antarctic Survey cameraman Pete Bucktrout made videos of the band's performances that were transmitted back from Antarctica for later inclusion in Live Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL0580573920070706 |title=Unknown Antarctica band joins Live Earth megastars |last=Collett-White |first=Mike |date=6 July 2007 |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=14 December 2009 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The videos are available on the BAS website and the BAS [[YouTube]] channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/indepth/nunatak/video/index.php |title=Watch the Performances - Nunatak at Live Earth 2007 |work=British Antarctic Survey |year=2014 |accessdate=6 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010121432/http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/indepth/nunatak/video/index.php |archivedate=10 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.youtube.com/user/AntarcticSurvey/videos?query=Nunatak+Live+Earth |title=Antarctic Survey : Nunatak Live Earth |work=YouTube |year=2014 |accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoOiQDckGwI |title=RaiNews 24 Exclusive Snippet ("How Many People") |work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
He lived the Portuguese decolonisation of Mozambique. In 1944, he moved with his wife and daughter to [[Coimbra]], where he studied biology at the [[University of Coimbra]].

He worked as a biologist in [[Maputo|Lourenço Marques]] and wrote for several publications such as: ''Tempo'', ''Itinerário'', ''Vértice'' and ''África''. In spite of being European, he strongly criticized colonial treatment towards black people and [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Salazar's administration]]. During the [[Portuguese Colonial War]], he was with [[FRELIMO]] nationalist party.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4081">'''Overlapping consensus''' is a term coined by [[John Rawls]] in ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' and developed in ''[[Political Liberalism]]''.

==Overview==
The term "overlapping consensus" refers to how supporters of different comprehensive normative doctrines—that entail apparently inconsistent conceptions of justice—can agree on particular principles of justice that underwrite a political community's basic social institutions. Comprehensive doctrines can include systems of [[religion]], [[List of political ideologies|political ideology]], or [[Ethics|morality]]. 

Rawls explains that an overlapping consensus on principles of justice can occur despite "considerable differences in citizens' conceptions of justice provided that these conceptions lead to similar political judgements."&lt;ref&gt;Rawls, John. ''A Theory of Justice''. (Revised Ed.) Harvard University Press, 1971, 1999, p. 340.&lt;/ref&gt; The groups are able to achieve this consensus in part by refraining from political/public disputes over fundamental (e.g. metaphysical) arguments regarding religion and philosophy. Rawls elaborates that the existence of an overlapping consensus on conceptions of justice among major social groups holding differing—yet reasonable—comprehensive doctrines is a necessary and distinctive characteristic of political liberalism. Rawls also explains that the overlapping consensus on principles of justice is itself a moral conception and is supported by moral reasoning—although the fundamental grounds of this support may differ for each of the various groups holding disparate comprehensive doctrines, and these lines of reasoning may also differ from the public reasons provided for supporting the principles. These latter features distinguish his idea of an overlapping consensus from a mere modus vivendi, which is a strategic agreement entered into for pragmatic purposes, and therefore potentially unprincipled and unstable.&lt;ref&gt;Rawls, John. ''Political Liberalism''. Columbia University Press, 1993, pp. 134–49.&lt;/ref&gt; The overlapping consensus could in sum be said to “depend, in effect, on there being a morally significant core of commitments common to the ‘reasonable’ fragment of each of the main comprehensive doctrines in the community”&lt;ref&gt;D'Agostino, Fred, "[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2003/entries/original-position/ Original Position]", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Summer 2003 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued that reasonable forms of religious and moral public education may be agreed by considering which common values and principles may be determined through overlapping consensus between those of otherwise incommensurable comprehensive doctrines (e.g. those of a given religion and secularists) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moulin|first=Daniel|last2=Robson|first2=James|date=2012|title=Doing God in a liberal democracy|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03054985.2012.722863?utm_source=TrendMD&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=_Oxford_Review_of_Education_TrendMD_0|journal=Oxford Review of Education|language=en|volume=38|issue=5|pages=539–550|doi=10.1080/03054985.2012.722863|issn=0305-4985|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moulin|first=Dan|date=2009|title=A too liberal religious education?

'''Public engagement''' is a term that has recently been used, particularly in the UK, to describe "the involvement of specialists listening to, developing their understanding of, and interacting with, non-specialists" (as defined by England's university funding agency, [[HEFCE]], in 2006).

==Origins==
The tradition of a decision-making body getting inputs from those with less power is generally known as "consultation". This became popular with UK [[governments]] during the 1980s and 1990s.  Even though most governments that carry out consultations are democratically elected, many people who became involved in these processes were surprised that conduct of such "consultations" was unsatisfactory in at least three respects.

# Groups that already had influence were often the only ones consulted
# People who did not have the resources to find out would usually not be able to be part of a consultation, even if the decision it was meant to influence might have a major impact on them.
# There were no agreed safeguards against consultations being used cynically by decision-makers to make it look like they had sought to canvass other opinions, while in fact having set a new policy in place even before it asked the question.

As early as 1979, science analyst [[Dorothy Nelkin]] pointed out that much of what passed for participation in governance could best be understood as attempts by the powerful to [[co-opt]] the public.

==Theories==
Public engagement is a relatively new term, hardly used before the late 1990s. The existing term it shares most in common with is [[participatory democracy]], discussed by thinkers such as [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[G D H Cole]].

Many see participatory democracy as complementing [[representative democratic]] systems, in that it puts decision-making powers more directly in the hands of ordinary people. Rousseau suggested that participatory approaches to democracy had the advantage of demonstrating that "no citizen is a master of another" and that, in society, "all of us are equally dependent on our fellow citizens". Rousseau suggested that participation in decision – making increases feeling among individual citizens that they belong in their community.  Perhaps the most long-standing institution of participatory democracy is the system of trial by jury.

Whilst elected governments make the laws, it is therefore juries that are able to decide the innocence or guilt of anyone charged with breaking many of those laws, making it a key instrument of participatory democracy. Over the centuries they have achieved an importance to many democracies that have had to be fiercely defended. One senior judge surveying the limiting of a government's power provided by the jury over the centuries compared the jury to: "a little parliament... No tyrant could afford to leave a subject's freedom in the hands of twelve of his countrymen.... Trial by jury is more than an instrument of justice and more than one wheel of the constitution: it is the lamp that shows that freedom lives". ([[Patrick Devlin, Baron Devlin|Patrick Devlin]] 1956). Today, jury trials are practised in the UK, US, and many other democracies around the world including Russia, Spain, Brazil and Australia. Perhaps no other institution of government rivals the jury in placing power so directly in the hands of citizens, or wagers more on the truth of democracy's core claim that the people make their own best governors. Juries are therefore argued to be the most widespread form of genuine consultation at work in society today.

The tension between the state and civil society as underscored by Public Engagement within Newly Industrialized Economies (NIE) such as Singapore is illustrated by Kenneth Paul Tan of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tan|first1=Kenneth Paul|title=Public Engagement: The Gap between Rhetoric and Practice|url=https://www.cscollege.gov.sg/Knowledge/Ethos/Issue%2011%20August%202012/Pages/Public%20Engagement%20The%20Gap%20between%20Rhetoric%20and%20Practice.aspx|website=Civil Service College of Singapore|accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''But speaking about public engagement is, of course, quite a different thing from carrying out public engagement. And this is where there seems to be a gap between rhetoric and practice in Singapore. For instance, government officials recently met selectively with concerned members of the public to discuss a controversial decision to build a road through a historically significant graveyard. When criticised for not taking the public's views seriously, the Government explained that the meeting was never meant to be a "consultation". So it is important to ask why such a gap exists and why it might be difficult to close it, assuming of course that closing it is what we want to do."

''As a neo-liberal global city, Singapore has been witnessing rising popular pressure. Politics has come to the fore again, prompting the policy establishment to pay greater heed to the demands of a new and more variegated citizenry, with political leaders now more sensitive to the real prospect of losing elections. At the same time, the cultural, ideological, practical and institutional legacies of the earlier survivalist and development stages continue to be a source of tension in the evolution of Singapore's political culture. By no means has this been a simple and linear story of liberalisation.
However, are these recent developments enough to shift the deeply entrenched public sector mindsets that have been formed out of historically shaped ways of thinking and reasoning? Will a new generation of leaders in the public sector, whose horizons of experience may differ from the survivalist and developmental preoccupations of a previous generation, lead to fresh opportunities for new terms of engagement?''

''The elitist proclivities of the public sector, reinforced by top-level salaries that are comparable to the private sector, are unlikely to incentivise real public engagement, since they reinforce the sense that public sector leaders, possessing superior intellect, knowledge and insight, must defend the public interest against irrational and dangerous mass populism. The public, according to this mindset, needs to be educated to think correctly rather than present themselves as equal participants in policy formulation and implementation.
''

==Good practice==
Taking participatory democracy as an ideal for public engagement has significant consequences for how we apply the concept to issues with a scientific or technical element. Instead of merely receiving inputs from various interested parties, a participatory model of consultation forces decision-makers to recognise the democratic accountability of their actions not merely every few years at elections, but in a more systematic, direct sense to citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Bloomfield, D., Collins, K., Fry, C. and Munton, R., 2001: [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.459.23&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf Deliberation and inclusion: vehicles for increasing trust in UK public governance?] Environment and Planning C: Government and Policy 19, 501-513&lt;/ref&gt;

A common misconception is that there is a particular ''[[methodology]]'' that can be devised to facilitate all public engagement. Effective participation, by contrast, is conducted on the assumption that each different situation will require a different design, using a new combination of tools as part of an evolving cycle of action and reflection by the institution involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Measham | first1 = T.G. Brake | last2 = Robinson | first2 = C.J | last3 = Larson | first3 = S. Richards | last4 = Smith | first4 = T. | year = 2011 | title = NRM engagement between remote arid communities and government agencies: Success factors from Australia | url = | journal = Journal of Arid Environments | volume =  75| issue = | pages =  968–973| doi = 10.1016/j.jaridenv.2011.04.018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each "experiment" in participatory democracy contains a unique mix of people and institutions. Each method must therefore select elements from a range of different approaches.&lt;ref&gt;There are a number of organizations, like California's Institute for Local Government, that provide public officials with analytic constructs to decide which approaches to use and evaluate the results.  See, [http://www.ca-ilg.org/PublicEngagement www.ca-ilg.org/publicengagement.]&lt;/ref&gt; Participation is also overtly "political" in that it is about humans, power and knowledge – all of which are inherently complex and which together make for a potent mix that requires sensitivity and careful planning. So while participatory processes can be replicated in the same way as scientific protocols, their human ingredients can differ so much that a concentration on replicating what happened elsewhere often hinders the practical application of a technique.

Before describing a scientific experiment, scientists know that it is vital to explain the context in which that experiment takes place. Was the plant in a test tube or in a farmer's field?  Was the rat well fed or starving? This logic also applies in the case of a participatory process, in which the each consultation event is analogous to an experimental subject. Each needs to proceed from an understanding of its political, scientific, institutional and practical constraints.

So instead of recommending a perfect method of public engagement, Table 1 summarises some working principles for such processes, based on those used by [[Policy, Ethics and Life Sciences Research Centre|PEALS]] at [[Newcastle University]].

==Nine principles==
#Participants should join those organising the process in setting [[terms of reference]] for the whole exercise, and framing the questions that they will discuss.
#The group organising, or in overall control of, the process should be broad based, including stakeholders with different interests on the subject being discussed.
#There should be a diversity of [[information]] sources and perspectives available to participants.
#There should be space for the perspectives of those participants who lack specialist knowledge of the area concerned to engage in a two-way exchange with those possessing specialist knowledge.
#There should be complete [[transparency (behavior)|transparency]] of the activities carried out within the process to those both inside and outside it.
#Those without a voice in policy-making should be enabled to use the consultation process as a tool for positive [[political change]]. This should be embedded in the process by sufficient funds being made available for follow-up work after their initial conclusions have been reached.
#The process should contain safeguards against decision-makers using a process to [[legitimise]] existing assumptions or policies.
#All groups involved in the process should be given the opportunity to identify possible strategies for longer-term learning, development and change on a range of issues relating to their conclusions.
#The group organising, or in overall control of, the process should develop an [[audit]] trail through the process, to explain whether policies were changed, what was taken into account, what criteria were applied when weighing up the evidence from the process, and therefore how the views of those involved in the participatory process may have made a difference. This should be explored together with as many those involved in all levels of the process as possible.

==In science and technology==
The movement for public engagement in science and technology grows out of a paradox: the steadily increasing number of ways citizens can learn about science has not always been matched by any increased level of scientific knowledge or sophistication among citizens.  There are nearly one hundred science and technology museums in North America alone, numerous science blogs (the aggregation site, [[ScienceBlogs]], reported 152 thousand posts and 3.3 million comments for 61 blogs alone before it closed in October 2017), and a proliferating number of science magazines.&lt;ref&gt;ScienceBlogs. (n.d.). ScienceBlogs. Retrieved November 13, 2011, from http://scienceblogs.com/&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, surveys of scientific literacy show a long term pattern in which Americans have only a moderate understanding of basic scientific facts and concepts.  In 1992, only 59% of adults sampled could give correct answers to a series of scientific terms and concepts; in 2008 the number was 64%.&lt;ref&gt;nsf.gov - S&amp;E Indicators 2010 - Chapter 7.  Science and Technology: Public Attitudes and Understanding - Public Knowledge About S&amp;T - US National Science Foundation (NSF). (n.d.). nsf.gov - National Science Foundation - US National Science Foundation (NSF). Retrieved November 12, 2011, from {{cite web |url=https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind10/c7/c7s2.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001164010/https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind10/c7/c7s2.htm |archivedate=2011-10-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2010 the presentation of these same measures of [[scientific literacy]] became controversial. Americans performed much worse on questions about [[evolution]] and the [[big bang]] theory than respondents from different countries. These differences disappeared when short caveats like, "According to the theory of Evolution..." were added to the questions – pointing to a larger conflict between scientific knowledge and personal beliefs in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bhattacharjee | first1 = Y. | year = 2010 | title = NSF board draws flak for dropping evolution from Indicators. | url = http://science.sciencemag.org/content/328/5975/150.short | journal = Science | volume = 328 | issue = 5975| page = 150 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another survey found widening gaps in knowledge of [[nanotechnology]] between the most and least educated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Corley | first1 = E.

To address this disconnect and complexity, there have been calls for new ways of connecting citizens with science in hopes that citizens can do more than respond passively to choices made by experts, and instead actually contribute to shaping science policy as it is made. This engagement of different publics in the policymaking process happens through the flow of information between the relevant publics and the sponsor of the engagement (e.g., policy makers, experts, scientists). Mechanisms for public engagement generally fall within one of the following types of information flow; public communication, public consultation, and public participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Guidry | first1 = Jeanine P.D. | last2 = Jin | first2 = Yan | last3 = Orr | first3 = Caroline A. | last4 = Messner | first4 = Marcus | last5 = Meganck | first5 = Shana | year = 2017 | title = Ebola on Instagram and Twitter: How health organizations address the health crisis in their social media engagement. | url = | journal = Public Relations Review | volume = 43 | issue = | page = 477-486 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''Public communication''' is characterized by the one-way transfer of information or resources to the public. This includes mechanisms like information broadcasts and static website resources. Traditional media functions in this way by influencing the public agenda, termed [[agenda-setting theory]]. '''Public consultation''' is the collection of information about or from the public by the sponsor. Potential mechanisms are [[opinion poll]]s, [[referendum]], [[survey (human research)|surveys]], [[focus groups]], or interactive websites. These mechanisms gather information from the public to shape what sponsors focus on or invest their resources into. Public consultation is also a one-way flow of information, but in the reverse direction of public communication.

'''Public participation''' is the two-way dialogue between the public and the sponsor. This two-way dialogue can be either short-term, with brief exchanges of information, or long-term, lasting decades. Mechanisms for public participation include action planning workshops, citizens' jury, consensus conferences, and task forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rowe | first1 = G. | last2 = Frewer | first2 = L. J. | year = 2005 | title = A typology of public engagement mechanisms. | url = http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.546.7172&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf | journal = Science Technology &amp; Human Values | volume = 30 | issue = 2| page = 251 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Social media has become an increasingly prominent mechanism of public participation as well. Social allows for instant and on-going dialogue between sponsors and the public. Additionally, social is flexible and can be implemented in a variety of ways, but not all social media platforms function identically. For example, three major health organizations implemented social media campaigns during the Ebola epidemic of 2013: [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), and [[Médecins Sans Frontières]] (MSF, also known as Doctors without Borders). All three organizations used both Twitter and Instagram to communicate with the public, but the public engaged with Instagram posts more often than Twitter. This finding is consistent with [[Visual communication]] theory. Additionally, each organization fostered a different level of engagement with the public (MSF garnered the highest engagement).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jeanine P.D.|first1=Guidry|last2=Jin|first2=Yan|last3=Orr|first3=Caroline A.|last4=Messner|first4=Marcus|last5=Meganck|first5=Shana|title=Ebola on Instagram and Twitter: How health organizations address the health crisis in their social media engagement|journal=Public Relations Review|date=2017|volume=43|page=477-486||doi=10.1016/j.pubrev.2017.04.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Deliberative democracy'''

[[Deliberative democracy]] is also a mechanism for public participation with potential implications for public engagement with science. It provides a structure for public participation about pending policy developments via public hearings, the mainstream media and the internet, consulting with different interest groups. This way, policy in the making is informed by the knowledge and experiences of those who will be affected by it, works to engage the public before final decisions are made, and sometimes gives affected groups a share of power in policy developments.&lt;ref&gt;Lukensmeyer, C. J., &amp; Torres, L. H. (n.d.). Public Deliberation: A Manager's Guide to Citizen Engagement | IBM Center for the Business of Government. IBM Center for the Business of Government: Research, Trends, Reports. Retrieved November 14, 2011, from http://www.businessofgovernment.org/report/public-deliberation-managers-guide-citizen-engagement&lt;/ref&gt;

Stages 1 and 2 can use tools like public opinion surveys, media campaigns and public hearings.  Stages 3 and 4 involve public or online deliberation or multi-stakeholder negotiation aimed at consensus building. Government decision makers at the agencies involved are expected to know their objectives and rationales, as well as key challenges to engaging the public.

In such situations, agencies must be on guard to see that all the important views are represented without raising expectations so high that all participants think their views will automatically be adopted as policy. Moreover, evaluation to ensure the effectiveness of public engagement is also important.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jensen | first1 = E | year = 2011 | title = 'Evaluate impact of communication' | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = | page = 162 | doi = 10.1038/469162c}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Key examples of public engagement''' include:

* Americans Discuss Social Security, which engaged 50,000 Americans in all fifty states over fifteen months in 1998 and 1999.  During that period, President Clinton and 120 members of Congress took part in town meetings and teleconferences.  The project's sponsors state that it "demonstrated the intense public interest in the future of Social Security reform and showed that Americans had more of a "middle ground" approach than special interests or lawmakers had believed. For example, contrary to insiders' expectations, participants overwhelmingly supported raising the cap on payroll taxes."&lt;ref&gt;Americans Discuss Social Security «  AmericaSpeaks. (n.d.).

* Listening To The City, which brought 5,000 people from New York City and the tri-state area to the Javits Center in July 2002, to discuss the future of lower Manhattan.  A separate series of 26 online dialogues involved an additional 800 participants over two weeks.  The purpose was to insure broad participation in redevelopment of the World Trade Center site and listen to citizens' ideas about the proposed memorial.  According to the final report, 80% of participants were satisfied or very satisfied with the result.&lt;ref&gt;Listening to the City. (n.d.). Listening to the City.

This included one-on-one interviews with three thousand people as well as eleven workshops attended by 15,000 more people.  Nine hundred citizens took part in an additional town meeting aimed at identifying goals the region needed to adopt to overcome its most significant challenges.  There were also leadership workshops for 1000 government and business leaders.  The three top goals that emerged were  planning for the future development and growth of the region, ensuring students have the financial resources they need to succeed, and improving workforce training programs.  90% of regional town meeting participants described them as excellent or good. (www.futurefundneo.org/~/media/Final_VoicesChoices_Report.ashx)

Public engagement with science was formally called for in the Third Report of the UK House of Lords Committee on Science and Technology, which argued that "public confidence in science and policy based on science has been eroded in recent year....there is a new humility on the part of science in the face of public attitudes, and a new assertiveness on the part of the public."  One consultation, on the regulation of biotechnology in 1998, involved six two-day workshops as well as a large-scale survey.  Asked who should be involved in regulating biotechnology, between 40 and 50 percent of respondents said regulatory groups should include a mixed advisory body, an expert body, scientists themselves, the general public, government, and environmental groups.  One advisor to the Office of Science and Technology said the process was time-consuming and expensive, and workshops were open to the charge of being run by their organizers rather than their participants, but he still felt the participants dealt with the issues and came to understand them.&lt;ref&gt;Select Committee on Science and Technology Third Report CHAPTER 5: ENGAGING THE PUBLIC .

&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there are important obstacles facing public engagement strategies. [[Selective exposure theory]] postulates that individuals favor information that agrees with their beliefs over information that contradicts those beliefs. Experimental evidence supports this theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yeo|first1=Sara K.|last2=Xenos|first2=Michael A.|last3=Brossard|first3=Dominque|last4=Scheufele|first4=Dietram A.|title=Selecting our own science: How communication contexts and individual traits shape information seeking|journal=The annals of the american academy|date=March 2015|volume=658|pages=172-191|doi=10.1177/0002716214557782}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals also form a [[filter bubble]] of like-minded people who hold a similar belief structure, decreasing the amount of dissonant information they are likely to encounter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pariser|first1=Eli|title=The Filter Bubble: What the Internet Is Hiding from You|date=May 2011|publisher=Penguin Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-59420-300-8|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sponsors and communicators need to address or counter these obstacles when trying to engage with the public.

==Constraints of public meeting efforts==

The following intrinsic and extrinsic constraints of public meetings can lead to unexpected a misrepresentation of the overall public's opinions:

'''1. Attendance in public meetings is low and highly selective'''

Although citizens express their intention to participate in public engagement activities, in real world, they are less likely to show up. For example, the average turnout at annual town meetings in Massachusetts in 1996 was 7.6 percent which was much lower than the average municipal election turnout of 31.1 percent.&lt;ref&gt;de Santis, V. S., and T. Renner. 1997. Democratic traditions in New England town meetings: Myths and realities. In Annual Convention of the Midwest Political Science Association. Chicago, IL.&lt;/ref&gt; Low turnout rate in public meetings can lead serious sampling biases when attendees and non-attendees significantly differ in their interests. For example, attendees can be more interested in politics and involved in more personal discourses than non-attendees. In this case, their opinions can be slanted to one side.

'''2. Group dynamics and personality traits of participants'''

Depending the makeup of participants, group dynamics and personality characteristics of participants can considerably affect the outcomes of discussions. A small number of outspoken participants can make more than half of the comments during the discussions while least outspoken members make a very small portion of the comments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Merkle | first1 = D. M. | year = 1996 | title = The polls-Review-The National Issues Convention Deliberative Poll | url = | journal = Public Opinion Quarterly | volume = 60 | issue = 4| pages = 588–619 | doi=10.1086/297775}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''3. Moderated/controlled settings of public meetings'''
In order to minimize the potential effects of participants' demographic and cognitive characteristics on conversations, public meetings or consensus conferences tend to be carefully moderated and guided by facilitators. In such artificial setting, participants may behave in different ways that may differ from what is likely to occur in real-world discussions.&lt;ref&gt;Scheufele, A. D. (2011). Modern  Citizenship  or  Policy  Dead  End?  Evaluating  the  need  for  public  participation  in  science  policy  making,  and  why  public  meetings  may  not  be  the  answer . Paper #R-34, Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy Research Paper Series. Havard University. Cambridge, MA. Retrieved from http://www.hks.harvard.edu/presspol/publications/papers/research_papers/r34_scheufele.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''4. Spillovers from public meetings to real-world discussion'''

The social implication effect of follow-up media coverage of public meetings or other engaging events may help transfer issues from these small group discussions to the broader community. However, in the case of the U.S., a spillover effect from public meetings into media discourse are minimal at best.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dudo | first1 = A. D. | last2 = Dunwoody | first2 = S. | last3 = Scheufele | first3 = D. A. | year = 2011 | title = The emergence of nano news: Tracking thematic trends and changes in U.S. newspaper coverage of nanotechnology | url = http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/107769901108800104 | journal = Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly | volume = 88 | issue = 1| pages = 55–75 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''5. Knowledge gap issues'''

Public meetings and consensus conferences may create knowledge gaps between high SES and less SES participants. The demographic, prepositional and cognitive differences between two groups in public meeting may lead to differing outcomes of public engagement. For example, highly educated participants may learn more from discussions and dominate the conversation while less educated members listen to their arguments. Furthermore, only small proportions of the population who may be already informed attend public meetings while the majority of the population who may need information the most do not. In such case, any public engagement effort may widen existing gaps further.

The '''ROSE''' compiler framework, developed at [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] (LLNL), is an [[open-source software]] [[compiler]] infrastructure to generate [[Source-to-source compiler|source-to-source]] analyzers and [[Translator (computing)|translators]] for multiple source languages including [[C (programming language)|C]] (C89, C98, [[Unified Parallel C]] (UPC)), [[C++]] (C++98, C++11), [[Fortran]] (77, 95, 2003), [[OpenMP]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], and [[PHP]].

It also supports certain binary files, and [[Automatic parallelization|auto-parallelizing]] compilers by generating source code annotated with OpenMP directives. Unlike most other research compilers, ROSE is aimed at enabling non-experts to leverage compiler technologies to build their own custom software analyzers and optimizers.

==The infrastructure==
ROSE consists of multiple front-ends, a midend operating on its internal [[intermediate representation]] (IR), and backends regenerating (unparse) source code from IR. Optionally, vendor compilers can be used to compile the unparsed source code into final executables.

To parse C and C++ applications, ROSE uses the Edison Design Group's C++ front-end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edg.com/index.php?location=c_frontend|title=Edison Design Group's C++ front-end|website=Edg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224123854/http://www.edg.com/index.php?location=c_frontend|date=2008-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fortran support, including F2003 and earlier 1977, 1990, and 1995 versions, is based on the Open Fortran Parser (OFP) developed at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Fortran-parser.sourceforge.net|url=http://fortran-parser.sourceforge.net/|title=Open Fortran Parser (OFP)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ROSE IR consists of an [[abstract syntax tree]], symbol tables, control flow graph, etc. It is an [[object-oriented]] IR with several levels of interfaces for quickly building source-to-source translators. All information from the input source code is carefully preserved in the ROSE IR, including C preprocessor control structure, source comments, source position information, and [[C++ template]] information, e.g., template arguments.

ROSE is released under a [[BSD licenses|BSD-style license]]. It targets [[Linux]] and [[OS X]] on both [[IA-32]] and [[x86-64]] platforms. Its [[Edison Design Group]] (EDG) parts are [[proprietary software|proprietary]] and distributed in binary form. Source files of the EDG parts can be obtained if users have a commercial or research license from EDG.

==Award==
The ROSE compiler infrastructure received one of the 2009 R&amp;D 100 Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rdmag.com/award-winners/2009/07/free-compiler-aids-novices-experts |title=Free compiler aids novices, experts |date=30 July 2009 |website=R&amp;D Magazine |publisher=Advantage Business Media |access-date=18 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The R&amp;D 100 Awards are presented annually by ''R&amp;D Magazine'' to recognize the 100 most significant proven [[research and development]] advances introduced over the past year. An independent expert panel selects the winners.

A '''research center''' (also known as '''research group''') is a facility or building dedicated to [[research]], commonly with the focus on a specific area. There are over 14,000 research centers in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Evaluating Research Centers and Institutes for Success: A Manual and Guide with Case Studies William R. Tash WT &amp; Associates, 2006. 229 pages&lt;/ref&gt;  Centers apply varied disciplines including [[basic research]] and [[applied research]] in addition to non traditional techniques. However, a research center should not be confused with a [[research institute]]. Additionally, today many universities are establishing research centers to conduct a specific research or education activity. Over a hundred of research centers can be established in one university. This number certainly differs from a university to a university, but most of the research centers there do bring something to the scientific table.

[[File:Smartvillagelandscape.JPG|thumb|A view of the Smart Village in 6th of October]]
'''Smart Village''' ({{Lang-ar|القرية الذكية}}) is a high-technology business district in the city of [[6th of October (city)|6th of October]], [[Egypt]], established by Presidential Decree no.355 in 2000, with activities starting in 2001. It is located on the [[Cairo–Alexandria desert road | Cairo-Alexandria Desert Road]], slightly west of [[Cairo]].&lt;ref name="Smart Village East"&gt;{{cite news |title=Abu Dhabi JV plans to build smart city in Cairo |url=http://www.tradearabia.com/news/CONS_317268.html |accessdate=17 October 2018 |work=Trade Arabia |date=27 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161128140950/http://www.tradearabia.com/news/CONS_317268.html |archive-date=2016-11-28 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Smart Village occupies an area of 450 [[feddan|feddans]]. It's a business district with office buildings, retail shops, entertainment, factories and green spaces.&lt;ref name="Real_Estate"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.smartvillageegypt.com/ |website=Smart Village Egypt |title=Real Estate |accessdate=17 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180823142606/https://smartvillageegypt.com/ |archive-date=2018-08-23 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[Hosni Mubarak]] signed the decree and provided the land for the building of Smart Village, in order for Egypt to build its IT economy and IT industry. Mubarak worked to get Microsoft, IBM and Cisco on-board. The 2001 decree gave companies in the Smart Village a ten-year tax break. The plan was to create several ''smart villages'' in Egypt.&lt;ref name="Wired"&gt;{{cite magazine |author=Staff writer |title=Work Like an Egyptian |url=https://www.wired.com/2000/11/work-like-an-egyptian/ |magazine= Wired|location=Science |date=14 November 2000 |access-date= 17 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stanko Luka Karaman''' (8 December 1889 – 17 May 1959) was a Yugoslav biologist of [[Bosnian Serb]] ancestry, researcher on [[amphipod]] and [[isopod]] crustaceans.

In 1926 he founded the Museum of South Serbia (later - [[Macedonian Museum of Natural History]]) in [[Skopje]] and in 1928, the Zoological Garden of Skopje.

Several species are named after him, for example ''[[Delamarella karamani]]'' &lt;small&gt;[[T. K. Petkovski|Petkovski]], 1957&lt;/small&gt; ([[Harpacticoida]]), ''[[Stygophalangium karamani]]'' &lt;small&gt;[[Anthonie Cornelis Oudemans|Oudemans]], 1933&lt;/small&gt; ([[Arachnida]]), or ''[[Macedonethes stankoi]]'' &lt;small&gt;[[Ivo Karaman|I. Karaman]], 2003&lt;/small&gt; ([[Isopoda]]).

Other taxa named ''karamani'' are labeled after his son [[Gordan S. Karaman]], also a [[carcinologist]].

'''Systems simulation''' is a set of techniques that use [[computer]]s to imitate the operations of various real-world tasks or processes through [[simulation]]. Computers are used to generate numeric models for the purpose of describing or displaying complex interaction among multiple variables within a system. The complexity of the system arises from the [[stochastic]] (probabilistic) nature of the events, rules for the interaction of the elements and the difficulty in perceiving the behavior of the systems as a whole with the passing of time.

==Systems Simulation in Video Games==
One of the most notable video games to incorporate systems simulation is [[Sim City]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/05/the-philosophy-of-simcity-an-interview-with-the-games-lead-designer/275724/|title=The Philosophy of SimCity: An Interview With the Game's Lead Designer|publisher=[[The Atlantic]]|accessdate=2 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which simulates the multiple systems of a functioning city including but not limited to: electricity, water, sewage, public transportation, population growth, social interactions (including, but not limited to jobs, education and emergency response).

[[Image:The Status Civilization.jpg|thumb|Cover of the first edition, published by [[Signet Books|Signet]].]]
'''''The Status Civilization''''' is a [[science fiction]] novel by American writer [[Robert Sheckley]], first published in 1960.

''The Status Civilization'' concerns Will Barrent, a man who finds himself, without memory of any crime or, indeed, of his previous life, being shipped across space to the planet Omega.

Omega, used to imprison extreme offenders, has a hierarchical society of extreme brutality, where the only way to advance (and avoid dying) is to commit an endless series of crimes. The average life expectancy from time of arrival on Omega is three years. The story concerns Barrent's attempt to survive, escape, and return to Earth to clear himself of the accusations against him.

==Plot summary==

[[Earth]] is a uniform, weakly structured, [[utopian]] society based on the mutual trust and conformity of its citizens. It is sleepy and stagnant, developing neither socially nor technologically. Its striking social stability is maintained by robots brainwashing children in "closed classes." The ideologies of both Earth and Omega resemble one another, differing only in words. On Omega, the citizens worship Evil (always capitalized) in a cult dedicated to an entity called The Black One. On Earth, the world religion is an amalgam of all the "good" aspects of previous Earth religions. Its institution is the Church of the Spirit of Mankind Incarnate.

As Barrent comes closer to the truth about the reasons for his incarceration, his Omegan consciousness conflicts with his subconsciousness which was programmed in the closed classes by the robots when he was a child. The subsequent psychological struggle is played out by repeating all of the previous fights and battles which Barrent experienced throughout the book, eventually making clear the vision (or "skrenning") which the mutant girl on Omega foresaw of Barrent's death.

The ''Zelinsky Model of Migration Transition'', also known as the '''Migration Transition Model''', claims that the type of [[Human migration|migration]] that occurs within a [[country]] depends on how developed it is or what type of society it is. A connection is drawn from migration to the stages of within the [[Demographic Transition Model]] (DTM). It was developed by [[Wilbur Zelinsky]] (1921–2013), longtime professor of [[geography]] at the [[Pennsylvania State University]].

== Model stages ==

[[Demographic transition#Stage One| Stage one]] (“Premodern traditional society”): This is before the onset of the
[[urbanization]], and it is very little to no migration and natural increase rates are about zero. There are very high levels of mobility (nomadism), but very little migration.

[[Demographic transition#Stage Two| Stage two]] (“Early transitional society”): During stage two a “massive movement from countryside to cities" occurs. And as a "community experiences the process of modernization”.
There is a “rapid rate of natural increase”. And  Internationally there is a high rate of emigration, although the total population number is still rising.

[[Demographic transition#Stage Three| Stage three]] (“Late transitional society”): Stage three corresponds to the “critical rung...of the mobility transition” where urban-to-urban migration surpasses the rural-to-urban migration, where rural-to-urban migration “continues but at waning absolute or relative rates”, and “a complex migrational and circular movements within the urban network, from city to city or within a single [[Metropolitan Area| metropolitan region]]”increased, circulation and non-economic migration starts to emerge. Then the net-out migration trend shifts to a net-in migration trend as more people immigrate than emigrate. That is, more people move in rather than out.

[[Demographic transition#Stage Four| Stage four]] (“Advanced society”): During stage four the “movement from countryside to city continues but is further reduced in absolute and relative terms, vigorous movement of
migrants from city to city and within individual urban agglomerations...especially
within a highly elaborated lattice of major and minor metropolises” is observed. A large increase of urban to suburban migration can also occur.
There is a “slight to moderate rate of natural increase or none at all”.

[[Demographic transition#Stage Five| Stage five]] (“Future super advanced society”): During stage five “Nearly all residential migration may be of the interurban and interurban variety….No plausible predictions of [[fertility]]
behavior,...a stable mortality pattern slightly below present levels”.
