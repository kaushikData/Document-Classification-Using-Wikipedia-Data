      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3073">'''Abdul Hadi''' ({{lang-ar| عبد الهادي}}) is a Muslim male given name, and in modern usage, surname. It is built from the Arabic words ''[[Abd (Arabic)|Abd]]'', ''[[al-]]'' and ''[[Hadi]]''. The name means "servant of the Guide", ''Al-Hādi'' being one of the [[names of God in the Qur'an]], which give rise to the [[List of Arabic theophoric names|Muslim theophoric names]].&lt;ref name=ahmed&gt;{{cite book| title=A Dictionary of Muslim Names| author=Salahuddin Ahmed| publisher = Hurst &amp; Company| location=London| year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rahman&gt; {{cite book| title=A Dictionary of Muslim Names| author= S. A. Rahman| publisher=Goodword Books|  location=New Delhi| year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The letter ''a'' of the ''al-'' is unstressed, and can be transliterated by almost any vowel, often by ''e''. So the first part can appear as Abdel, Abdul or Abd-al. The second part may appear as Hadi, Hady, or in other ways. The whole name is subject to variable spacing and hyphenation. 

It may refer to:

Born in [[Hemsworth]], Hall began his career in journalism with the ''[[The Journal (newspaper)|Newcastle Journal]]'', but soon moved to London.  By the age of 27 he became editor of the ''[[Sunday Graphic]]'' for a year,&lt;ref name="martin"&gt;Douglas Martin, "[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03E5D81538F930A35756C0A9679C8B63&amp;n=Top%2FReference%2FTimes%20Topics%2FSubjects%2FD%2FDeaths%20(Obituaries) Allan Hall, 71, Journalist Who Inspired Beaujolais Race]", ''[[The New York Times]]'', 3 May 2001&lt;/ref&gt; then in 1959 became managing editor of the ''[[News Chronicle]]''.  In 1960, both papers closed, and Hall began writing a [[gossip column]] for the ''[[Daily Herald (UK newspaper)|Daily Herald]]''.&lt;ref name="leapman"&gt;Michael Leapman, "[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/allan-hall-729066.html Allan Hall]", ''[[The Independent]]'', 30 April 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Hall remained a columnist as the ''Herald'' became ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', but left in 1969 when [[Rupert Murdoch]] bought the paper.  He joined the ''[[Sunday Times]]'', where he launched a lifestyle section before taking over the "Atticus" diary column.  Having long had an interest in wine, being known for spending long lunches in the [[Connaught Rooms]], he convinced editor [[Harold Evans]] to launch the Sunday Times Wine Club.&lt;ref name="leapman" /&gt;  By now writing regularly about wine, Hall decided in 1972 to organise an annual race to bring [[Beaujolais Nouveau]] to Britain.  This was replicating a private race by Clement Freud (Wine Correspondent for The Son) and Joseph Berkmann (agent for Georges DuBoeuf) in 1970 and 1971. This race, became a reality in 1972,  with a bottle of champagne up for grabs for the winner. This was collected by the first to arrive at The Sunday Times offices having let themselves into the building! This was later replicated in other countries, and by the 1980s attracted widespread interest. The official Beaujolais Run® continues to this day www.beaujolaisrun.com.&lt;ref name="martin" /&gt;

In 1980, Hall moved to work for [[James Goldsmith]]'s magazine ''[[NOW! (1979-81 magazine)|NOW!]]'', during which time he hosted a lunch at which fine wines were served.  For this one meal he claimed, and was paid, expenses of more than £11,000.  The magazine closed the following year, after which Hall retired to [[Suffolk]], selling wine and offering tasting sessions.  He continued writing about wine on a freelance basis, and organised wine tours of France.&lt;ref name="leapman" /&gt;

'''Anarky''' is a [[fiction]]al [[character (arts)|character]] appearing in comic books published by [[DC Comics]]. Co-created by [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]] and [[Norm Breyfogle]], he first appeared in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' No. 608 (November 1989), as an adversary of [[Batman]]. Introduced as '''Lonnie Machin''', a child prodigy with knowledge of radical philosophy and driven to overthrow governments to improve social conditions, stories revolving around Anarky often focus on political and philosophical themes. The character, who is named after the philosophy of [[anarchism]], primarily espouses [[anti-statism]]; however, multiple [[social issues]] have been addressed through the character, including [[environmentalism]], [[antimilitarism]], [[economic inequality]], and [[political corruption]]. Inspired by multiple sources, early stories featuring the character often included homages to political and philosophical books, and referenced anarchist philosophers and theorists. The inspiration for the creation of the character and its early development was based in Grant's personal interest in [[Anti-authoritarianism|anti-authoritarian]] philosophy and politics.&lt;ref name="Best/Grant/Breyfogle"/&gt; However, when Grant himself transitioned to the philosophy of Neo-Tech, developed by [[Frank R. Wallace]], he shifted the focus of Anarky from a vehicle for [[socialism|socialist]] and [[populism|populist]] philosophy, to [[rationalism|rationalist]], [[atheism|atheist]], and [[free market]] thinking.&lt;ref name="Kraft"/&gt;

Originally intended to only be used in the debut story in which he appeared, Grant decided to continue using Anarky as a sporadically recurring character throughout the early 1990s, following positive reception by readers and Dennis O'Neil.&lt;ref name="Berridge"/&gt; The character experienced a brief surge in media exposure during the late 1990s when Norm Breyfogle convinced Grant to produce a [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] based on the character. The 1997 [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series, ''[[Anarky (comic book)|Anarky]]'', was received with positive reviews and sales, and later declared by Grant to be among his "career highlights".&lt;ref name="Redington"/&gt; ''[[Batman: Anarky]]'', a [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] collection of stories featuring the character, soon followed. This popular acclaim culminated, however, in a financially and critically unsuccessful ongoing solo series. The 1999 ''Anarky'' series, in which even Grant has expressed his distaste, was quickly canceled after eight issues.&lt;ref name="Best/Grant/Breyfogle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cooling"/&gt;

Following the cancellation of the ''Anarky'' series, and Grant's departure from DC Comics, Anarky experienced a prolonged period of absence from DC publications, despite professional and fan interest in his return.&lt;ref name="Best/Breyfogle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WonderCon"/&gt; This period of obscurity lasted approximately nine years, with three brief interruptions for minor cameo appearances in 2000, 2001, and 2005. In 2008, Anarky reappeared in an issue of ''[[Robin (comics)#Robin monthlies|Robin]]'' authored by [[Fabian Nicieza]], with the intention of ending this period of obscurity.&lt;ref name="DC 2008 December Solicits"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DC 2009 January Solicits"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brady 2"/&gt; The storyline drastically altered the character's presentation, prompting a series of responses by Nicieza to concerned readers.&lt;ref name="Nicieza 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nicieza 2"/&gt; Anarky became a recurring character in issues of ''[[Red Robin (comic book)|Red Robin]]'', authored by Nicieza, until the series was cancelled in 2011 in the aftermath of [[The New 52]].&lt;ref name="Hyde"/&gt; A new Anarky was introduced into the New 52 continuity in October 2013, in an issue of ''[[Green Lantern Corps]]'', which itself was a tie-in to the "[[Batman: Zero Year]]" storyline.&lt;ref name="GLC No.25"/&gt; Yet more characters have been authored as using the Anarky alias in the New 52 continuity via the pages of ''Detective Comics''&lt;ref name="Rogers"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Detective Comics No.37" /&gt; and ''Earth 2: Society''.&lt;ref name="Earth 2: Society Vol.1 No.6" /&gt;

From 2013, Anarky began to be featured more heavily in media adaptations of DC Comics properties, across multiple platforms.&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt; In July, a revamped version of Anarky was debuted as the primary antagonist in ''[[Beware the Batman]]'', a Batman animated series produced by Warner Bros. Animation.&lt;ref name="Veronese"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Collura"/&gt; In October, the character made his video game debut in ''[[Batman: Arkham Origins]]'', as a villain who threatens government and corporate institutions with destruction.&lt;ref name="O'Dwyer/Holmes"/&gt; Anarky made his live action debut in the [[Green Arrow]] television series ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' in 2015, portrayed by [[Alexander Calvert]], once again as a villain.&lt;ref name=Tyrrel/&gt;

{{See also|Anarky in Gotham City}}
Originally inspired by his personal political leanings, [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]] entertained the idea of interjecting [[anarchism|anarchist]] philosophy into Batman comic books. In an attempt to emulate the success of [[Chopper (Judge Dredd)|Chopper]], a rebellious youth in [[Judge Dredd]], he conceptualized a character as a twelve-year-old anarchist vigilante, who readers would sympathize with despite the character's harsh methods;&lt;ref name="Grant"/&gt; as well, in the wake of the death of [[Jason Todd]], Grant hoped that Anarky could be used as the new [[Robin (character)|Robin]].&lt;ref name="Oral History"&gt;[http://www.comicsbeat.com/the-lives-and-death-of-jason-todd-an-oral-history-of-the-second-robin-and-a-death-in-the-family/ The Lives and Death of Jason Todd: An Oral History of The Second Robin and A DEATH IN THE FAMILY], by Joe Grunenwald; at ComicsBeat.com; published November 29, 2018; retrieved November 30, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;
Creating the character without any consultation from his partner, illustrator [[Norm Breyfogle]],&lt;ref name="Klaehn/Grant"/&gt; his only instructions to Breyfogle were that Anarky be designed as a cross between [[V (comics)|V]] and the black spy from ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' magazine's ''[[Spy vs. Spy]]''.&lt;ref name="Berridge"/&gt; The character was also intended to wear a costume that disguised his youth, and so was fitted with a crude "head extender" that elongated his neck, creating a jarring appearance. This was in fact intended as a ruse on the part of writer Alan Grant to disguise the character's true identity, and to confuse the reader into believing Anarky to be an adult.&lt;ref name="H-C Chan"/&gt; While both of these design elements have since been dropped, more enduring aspects of the character have been his golden face mask, "priestly" hat, and his golden [[walking stick|cane]].&lt;ref name="Breyfogle 1"/&gt;

The first Anarky story, "[[Anarky in Gotham City|Anarky in Gotham City, Part 1: Letters to the Editor]]", appeared in ''Detective Comics'' No. 608, in November 1989. Lonnie Machin is introduced as "Anarky" as early as his first appearance in ''Detective Comics'' No.608, withholding his [[origin story]] for a later point. He is established as an uncommonly philosophical and intelligent twelve-year-old.&lt;ref name="Detective Comics No.608"/&gt; Lonnie Machin made his debut as "Anarky" by responding to complaints in the newspaper by attacking the offending sources, such as the owner of a factory whose byproduct waste is polluting local river water.&lt;ref name="Detective Comics No.608"/&gt; Anarky and Batman ultimately come to blows, and during their brief fight, Batman deduces that Anarky is actually a young child. During this first confrontation, Anarky is aided by a band of homeless men, including [[Legs (comics)|Legs]], a homeless cripple who becomes loyal to him and would assist him in later appearances. After being caught, Lonnie is locked away in a juvenile detention center.&lt;ref name ="Detective Comics No.609"/&gt;

{{main article|Anarky (comic book)}}

Following the comic book industry crash of 1996, Norm Breyfogle sought new employment at DC Comics. Darren Vincenzo, then an editorial assistant at the company, suggested multiple projects which Breyfogle could take part in. Among his suggestions was an Anarky limited series, to be written by Grant or another specified author. Following encouragement from Breyfogle, Grant agreed to participate in the project.&lt;ref name="Carey"/&gt; The four-issue limited series, ''[[Anarky (comic book)|Anarky]]'', was published in May 1997. Entitled "Metamorphosis", the story maintained the character's anti-authoritarian sentiments, but was instead based on Neo-Tech, a philosophy developed by [[Frank R. Wallace]].&lt;ref name="Kraft"/&gt;

Well received by critics and financially successful, Grant has referred to the limited series as one of his favorite projects, and ranked it among his "career highlights".&lt;ref name="Redington"/&gt; With its success, Vincenzo suggested continuing the book as an ongoing series to Breyfogle and Grant. Although Grant was concerned that such a series would not be viable, he agreed to write it at Breyfogle's insistence, as the illustrator was still struggling for employment.&lt;ref name="Carey" /&gt; Building on the increasing exposure of the series, a trade paperback featuring the character titled ''[[Batman: Anarky]]'' was published. However, Grant's doubts concerning the ongoing series's prospects eventually proved correct. The second series was panned by critics, failed to catch on among readers, and was canceled after eight issues; however Grant has noted that it was popular in [[Latin America]]n countries, supposing this was due to a history of political repression in the region.&lt;ref name="Berridge"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Luiz"/&gt;

===Absence from DC publications===
{{quote box|align=right|width=25em|quote="We don't have any conclusive evidence, but Alan and I can't help but feel that Anarky's philosophy grated on somebody's nerves; somebody got a look at it and didn't like it&amp;nbsp; [...] So I've generally gotten the impression that Anarky was nixed because of its philosophy.  Especially in this age of post [[September 11 attacks|9/11]], Anarky would be a challenge to established authority.  He's very anti-establishment, that's why he's named Anarky!"|source=—Norm Breyfogle, 2003.&lt;ref name="Best/Breyfogle" /&gt;}}
After the financial failure of ''Anarky'' vol. 2, the character entered a period of absence from DC publications that lasted several years.  Norm Breyfogle attempted to continue using the character in other comics during this time. However, when his efforts were rejected, he came to suspect the character's prolonged absence was due in part to censorship.&lt;ref name="Best/Breyfogle" /&gt; Since the cancellation of the ''Anarky'' series, Grant has disassociated himself from the direction of the character, simply stating, "you have to let these things go."&lt;ref name="Cooling"/&gt;

In 2005, James Peaty succeeded in temporarily returning Anarky to publication, writing ''[[Green Arrow]]'' No.51, ''Anarky in the USA''. Although the front cover of the issue advertised the comic as the "return" of the character, Anarky failed to make any further appearances.&lt;ref name="GA V.3 No.51"/&gt; This was despite comments by Peaty that he had further plans to write stories for the character.&lt;ref name="M. Contino"/&gt;

Anarky retained interest among a cult fan base during this obscure period.&lt;ref name="Carey"/&gt; During a panel at [[WonderCon]] 2006, multiple requests were made by the audience for Anarky to appear in DC Comic's limited series, ''[[52 (comics)|52]]''. In response, editors and writers of ''52'' indicated Anarky would be included in the series. However, the series concluded without Anarky making an appearance, and with no explanation given by anyone involved in the production of the series for the failed appearance.{{Ref label|A|I|none}}

===Return as "Moneyspider"===
{{quote box|align=right|width=25em|quote="I took 2 characters who had not been seen in 10 years and told a story with them that sets up the potential for more stories to be told using those characters. I call that a good day at the office."|source=—Fabian Nicieza, 2009.&lt;ref name="Nicieza 2"/&gt;}}
On August 15, 2008, DC Comics announced that Anarky would reappear in the December issue of ''[[Robin (comics)#Robin monthlies|Robin]]'', issue No.181.&lt;ref name="DC 2008 December Solicits"/&gt; With the publication of ''Robin'' No.181, "Search For a Hero, Part 5: Pushing Buttons, Pulling Strings", on December 17, 2008, it was revealed that Lonnie Machin's role as Anarky had been supplanted by another [[List of Batman Family adversaries|Batman villain]], '''[[General (DC Comics)|Ulysses Armstrong]]'''. [[Fabian Nicieza]], author of the issue and storyline in which Anarky appeared, depicted the character as being held hostage by Armstrong, "paralyzed and [[Catatonia|catatonic]]",&lt;ref name="Nicieza 1"/&gt; encased in an [[iron lung]], and connected to computers through his brain. This final feature allowed the character to connect to the internet and communicate with others via a [[Speech synthesis|speech synthesizer]].&lt;ref name="Robin No.181"/&gt; Nicieza's decision to give Machin's mantle as Anarky to another character was due to his desire to establish him as a nemesis for Tim Drake, while respecting the original characterization of Anarky, who Nicieza recognized as neither immature, nor a villain. Regardless, Nicieza did desire to use Machin and properly return the character to publication, and so favored presenting Ulysses H. Armstrong as Anarky, and Lonnie Machin as Moneyspider, a reference to a secondary name briefly used by Grant for Anarky in storyline published in 1990.{{Ref label|B|II|none}}

The reactions to ''Robin'' No.181 included negative commentary from political commentator and scholar, [[Roderick T. Long|Roderick Long]],&lt;ref name="Long 1"/&gt; and Alan Grant himself.&lt;ref name="Forrest"/&gt; Among fans who interacted with Nicieza in a forum discussion, some responses were also negative, prompting responses from Nicieza in his own defense.&lt;ref name="Nicieza 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nicieza 2"/&gt;

With the conclusion of ''Robin'', Nicieza began authoring the 2009 ''Azrael'' series, leaving any future use of Anarky or Moneyspider to author [[Christopher Yost]], who would pick up the Robin character in a new ''[[Red Robin (comic book)|Red Robin]]'' series. However, in the ensuing months, Yost only made one brief reference to Anarky, without directly involving the character in a story plot.&lt;ref name="Red Robin No.3"/&gt; In April 2010, it was announced that Nicieza would replace Yost as the author of ''Red Robin'', and Nicieza was quick to note his interest in using Anarky and Moneyspider in future issues of the series.&lt;ref name="Renaud"/&gt; Nicieza reintroduced Ulysses Armstrong and Lonnie Machin within his first storyline, beginning in ''Red Robin'' No.16, "The Hit List", in December 2010.&lt;ref name="Red Robin No.16"/&gt; Nicieza then proceeded to regularly use Lonnie as a cast member of the ongoing ''Red Robin'' series, until its cancellation in October 2011. The series was concluded as a result of [[The New 52]], a revamp and relaunch by [[DC Comics]] of its entire line of ongoing monthly superhero books, in which all of its existing titles were canceled. 52 new series debuted in September 2011 with new No. 1 issues to replace the cancelled titles.&lt;ref name=Hyde/&gt;

===The New 52===
While Anarky was "rising in profile in other media" by mid 2013, the character had yet to be reintroduced to the status quo of the post-New 52 [[DC Universe]].&lt;ref name="Ching (1)"/&gt; This changed on August 12, when DC Comics announced that Anarky would be reintroduced in ''[[Green Lantern Corps]]'' No. 25, "Powers That Be", on November 13, 2013. The issue was a tie-in to the "[[Batman: Zero Year]]" crossover event, authored by Van Jensen and co-plotted by [[Robert Venditti]].&lt;ref name="DC 2013 November Solicits"/&gt;

In the lead up to the publication date, at a panel event at the [[New York Comic Con]], Jensen was asked by a fan holding a "plush Anarky doll" what the character's role would be in the story. Jensen explained that Anarky "would have a very big hand" in the story, and further explained, "you can understand what he's doing even if you don't agree with what he's doing."&lt;ref name="Ching/Jensen"/&gt; Jensen had also indicated that his version of Anarky would be a "fresh take that also honors his legacy."&lt;ref name="Sailer"/&gt; The story featured a character study of [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]], narrating Stewart's final mission as a young Marine in the midst of a Gotham City power blackout and citywide evacuation, mere days before a major storm is to hit the city. Anarky is depicted as rallying a group of followers and evacuees to [[Occupation (protest)|occupy]] a sports stadium, on the basis that the area the stadium was built upon was [[Gentrification|gentrified]] at the expense of the local community and should be returned to them.&lt;ref name="GLC No.25"/&gt; The storyline brought two particular additions to the revamped version of Anarky; the first being that this new version of Anarky is portrayed as an [[African American]]; the second being to preserve the character's anonymity, as Anarky escapes custody at the end of the story without an identity behind the mask being revealed.&lt;ref name="Asburry (2)"/&gt;

Another version of Anarky debuted in the post-New 52 ''[[Detective Comics#The New 52|Detective Comics]]'' series, written by [[Francis Manapul]] and Brian Buccellato.&lt;ref name="Rogers"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Detective Comics No.37" /&gt; This character isn't the same Anarky that appeared in "Batman: Zero Year", but rather a corrupt politician named '''Sam Young''' who used the Anarky persona to exact revenge on the [[Mad Hatter (comics)#The New 52|Mad Hatter]] for murdering his sister.&lt;ref name="Detective Comics No.40" /&gt;

A female version of Anarky from the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|alternate reality]] of [[Earth-Two]] was introduced in ''Earth 2: Society'''s 2015 story line, "Godhood", by [[Daniel H. Wilson]]. Prior to the fictional events of the series, this Anarky detonated a bomb in the city of Neotropolis that resulted in a public riot. She disappears before [[Superman]] and [[Power Girl]] can apprehend her. In the series, she is portrayed as a hacker that is allied with such characters as [[Jimmy Olsen#Earth 2|Doctor Impossible]], [[Hourman]], and [[Johnny Sorrow]].&lt;ref name="Earth 2: Society Vol.1 No.6" /&gt;

==Characterization==
[[File:Detective Comics -609.jpg|thumb|right|The cover of ''[[Detective Comics]]'' No. 609 contrasts Anarky as a champion of the oppressed, and Batman as a champion of the law. Art by [[Norm Breyfogle]].]]
Anarky has undergone several shifts in his characterization over the course of the character's existence. These were largely decided upon by Alan Grant, who between the creation of Anarky to the end of the 1999 ''[[Anarky (comic book)|Anarky]]'' series, was largely the sole author of the character. After the departure of Grant and Breyfogle from DC Comics, Anarky's characterization fell to various authors who utilized him thereafter.&lt;!--Prominent examples include James Peaty's attempt to rescue Anarky from obscurity in 2005; Fabian Nicieza's treatment of the character in issues of ''Robin'' and ''Red Robin'' between 2008 and 2011; Eric Holmes' direction of the character's portrayal in ''Batman: Arkham Origins'' in 2013; and Van Jensen's post-New 52 Anarky reboot, all cited a mutual desire to remain true to the original portrayal of Anarky. Only the portrayal of Anarky in ''Beware the Batman'' was totally revamped, so as to be unrecognizable from his original incarnation.--&gt;

===Description and motivations===
Lonnie Machin is introduced as a twelve-year-old school boy. An [[only child]], he shares his physical traits of [[light skin]] and [[red hair]] with both of his parents, Mike and Roxanne Machin, a middle-class family living in Gotham City.&lt;ref name ="Detective Comics No.608"/&gt; The character's age was continuously adjusted over the course of several years; stated to be fourteen during "The Anarky Ultimatum" in ''Robin Annual'' No.1,&lt;ref name="Robin Annual No.1"/&gt; it is reestablished as fifteen during the events of the ''Anarky'' limited series,&lt;ref name="Anarky Vol.1 No.1"&gt;{{Cite comic |writer=Alan Grant |penciller=Norm Breyfogle |inker=Josef Rubinstein |story=Metamorphosis Part 1: Does a Dog Have a Buddha Nature? |title=Anarky |volume=1 |issue=1 |date=1997-5-1 |publisher=DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt; and adjusted as sixteen the following year during the ongoing series.&lt;ref name ="Anarky Vol.2 No.1"/&gt;

Grant laconically described Lonnie Machin as "a serious-beyond-his-years teenager who wants to set the world to rights."&lt;ref name="Darkhorse"/&gt;  As the character was based on a theme of ideas, he had initially been given no personal, tragic past, a common motivator in [[superhero fiction]]. This was intended to contrast with Batman, who fought crime due to personal tragedy, while Anarky would do so in the name of ideals and beliefs.&lt;ref name="Grant"/&gt; As the character was further developed, he was also intended to contrast with common teenage [[superhero]]es. Referring to the tradition established by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] of saddling teenagers with personal problems, Grant purposely gave Anarky none, nor did he develop a girlfriend or social life for the character. As Grant wrote for the ''Batman: Anarky'' introduction, this was intended to convey the idea that Anarky was single minded in his goals.&lt;ref name="Grant"/&gt; In one of the earliest explorations of Lonnie Machin's back story in "The Anarky Ultimatum", Grant described Lonnie as a prolific reader, but also of being isolated from peers his own age during his childhood.&lt;ref name="Robin Annual No.1"/&gt; This was elaborated upon years later in the "Anarky" storyline, which described Lonnie as having lost a childhood friend living in an impoverished nation, the latter suffering the loss of his family due to civil war and strife before disappearing entirely. The resulting shock of discovering at such a young age that the world was in turmoil precipitated Lonnie Machin's rapid maturation and eventual radicalization.&lt;ref name="Batman: SotB No.41"/&gt;

===Heroic and villainous themes===
Anarky's introduction during the late 1980s was part of a larger shift among [[supervillain]]s in the ''Batman'' franchise of the time. While many naive and goofy villains of previous eras were abandoned, and more iconic villains made more violent to cater to tastes of a maturing readership, some were introduced to challenge readers to "question the whole bad/good guy divide." Falling into "the stereotype anarchist bomb-toting image", Anarky's design was countered by his principled stances to create an odd contrast.&lt;ref name="Pradhan"/&gt; In a review of the ''[[Anarky (comic book)|Anarky]]'' miniseries, Anarky was dubbed an "anti-villain", as opposed to "[[antihero]]", due to his highly principled philosophy, which runs counter to most villains: "In the age of the anti-hero, it only makes sense to have the occasional anti-villain as well. But unlike sociopathic vigilante anti-heroes like the [[Punisher]], an anti-villain like Anarky provides some interesting food for thought. Sure, he breaks the law, but what he really wants is to save the world&amp;nbsp;... and maybe he's ''right''."&lt;ref name="VerBeek"/&gt;

Breyfogle's characterization of Anarky has shifted on occasion, with him at times referring to Anarky as a villain, and at other times as a hero. In his 1998 introductory essay composed for ''[[Batman: Anarky]]'', Breyfogle characterized Anarky as not being a villain, but rather a "misunderstood hero", and continued "he's a ''philosophical'' action hero, an Aristotle in tights, rising above mere 'crime-fighter' status into the realm of incisive social commentary."&lt;ref name="Breyfogle 1"/&gt; A year later, Breyfogle conceded that Anarky was "technically" a villain, but insisted "I don't consider him a villain&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name="H-C Chan"/&gt; Breyfogle later reconsidered the character in more ambiguous terms for a 2005 interview: "Anarky isn't a villain, he's his own character. He's definitely not a superhero, although it depends on who you talk to."&lt;ref name="O'Ryan"/&gt;
{{quote box|align=left|width=25em|quote="Anarky's world clashes as much with the traditional world of superheroes as it does with the world of crime. So the interplay between him and [[Green Lantern]] and him and [[Superman]] is not the usual kind of hero interplay."|source=—Alan Grant, 1998.&lt;ref name="Irving/Grant"/&gt;}}
Grant has been more direct in his description of Anarky's virtuous attributes: "In my eyes, Anarky's a hero. Anarky's the hero I want to be if I was smart enough and physically fit enough." Acknowledging that Anarky's moral perspective was guided by his own, Grant expressed that the conflict between Anarky and other heroes is a result of their political divisions: "In my eyes, he's a hero, but to others, they see him as a villain. That is because most people might gripe about the political situation, or various aspects of the political situation, and wouldn't advocate the total overthrow of the system under which we live. Anarky certainly does that, and more."&lt;ref name="Irving/Grant"/&gt;

In creating stories involving Anarky, other writers have played off this anti-heroic and anti-villainous tension. James Peaty made the heroic and political comparisons between Lonnie Machin and Oliver Queen the central theme of his 2005 ''Green Arrow'' story, "Anarky in the USA": "Anarky comes to find Ollie because of his reputation and is quite disappointed in Ollie's reaction towards him. However, as the story unfolds, Ollie has to re-assess his initial reaction to Anarky and his own much vaunted 'radical' credentials."
&lt;ref name="M. Contino"/&gt; With his controversial revival of the character in 2008, Fabian Nicieza chose to portray the mantle of Anarky as being possessed by a villain other than Lonnie Machin on the grounds that Lonnie was too heroic to act out the part of a black hat: "Since Lonnie is too smart to be immature and NOT a 'villain,' I wanted Anarky, but it couldn't be Lonnie without compromising who he is as a character."&lt;ref name="Nicieza 1"/&gt;
{{quote box|align=right|width=25em|quote="So, one of the reasons I really like Anarky is he's a kind of classic anti-villain, right? Like, he's trying to do the right thing; he believes he's doing the right thing; from Batman's perspective he's not; but from a dramatic perspective, if you look at him, there's a really good argument to be made for what he does and why he does it."|source=—Eric Holmes, 2013.&lt;ref name="Petit"/&gt;}}In the character's 2013 video game debut in ''[[Batman: Arkham Origins]]'', creative director Eric Holmes dubbed Anarky a "classic anti-villain".&lt;ref name="Petit"/&gt; A "social activist" who wishes to "liberate and free people", Anarky views himself as a hero akin to Batman and offers an alliance with him. However his approach is rebuked on the basis that their methods are nothing alike.&lt;ref name="Osborn"/&gt; Nonetheless, he attracts a following among the city's downtrodden and particularly the homeless, whom he protects from the hostility of police officers.&lt;ref name="Ching (1)"/&gt; This "special relationship" between the homeless who look up to a villain, who in turn acts as their protector against police who prey upon them, was intended to present an area of grey morality for the player to consider.&lt;ref name="Petit"/&gt;

On two occasions Grant nearly went against Dennis O'Neil's early wish that Anarky not kill opponents. These events include his appearance during the ''[[Batman: Knightfall]]'' saga, in which Grant briefly portrayed Anarky as preparing to kill both the [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]] and [[Azrael (comics)|Batman-Azrael]].&lt;ref name="Batman: SotB No.18" /&gt;  Grant also implied Anarky was a lethal figure in "The Last Batman Story", part of ''[[Armageddon 2001]]'' crossover event. In the story, a [[time travel]]er shows Batman a possible future in the (relatively) not-too-distant year of 2001. An aged Batman is framed and sentenced to death for [[murder]], but Anarky, now an adult, sympathizes with the fallen hero and breaks into the prison in an attempt to rescue Batman. However, Batman resists his help, on the basis that Anarky has killed others in the past, and the two never reconciled their differences.&lt;ref name="Batman Annual No.15"/&gt;

Grant later expressed relief that he had not fully committed to portraying Anarky as a potential murderer, as he felt "Anarky would have compromised his own beliefs if he had taken the route of the criminal-killer."&lt;ref name="Grant"/&gt; Anarky was given a non-lethal approach in ''[[The Batman Adventures]]'' No.31, "Anarky", written by Alan Grant, who acted as a guest author for the issue. Anarky takes business elites hostage and places them on public trial, broadcast from a [[pirate television]] show.  He charges these men with such crimes as the creation of [[land mine]]s that kill or cripple thousands, funding [[Third World]] dictators, polluting the air with toxic chemicals, and profiting from [[wage slavery]], and threatens each man with a bomb if the public should find them guilty. When the explosions take place, it is revealed that the bombs are fake, and the public trials were only intended to expose the men and raise public awareness. One bomb explosion carried a specific message. It unfurled a banner that denounced lethal weapons.&lt;ref name="Batman Adventures No.31"/&gt;

Contradicting Anarky's non-lethal portrayal, entries for the character in ''[[Who's Who in the DC Universe]]'',&lt;ref name="Who's Who"/&gt; ''The DC Comics Encyclopedia'',&lt;ref name="DC Comics Encyclopedia"/&gt; and ''The Supervillain Book'',&lt;ref name="Misiroglu/Eury"/&gt; have falsely referred to Anarky as having killed criminals in early appearances. Norm Breyfogle was also under the false impression that Anarky had killed for several years, having failed to realize the original script for Anarky's debut storyline had been rewritten. Grant eventually explained the situation to Breyfogle in 2006, during a joint interview.&lt;ref name="Best/Grant/Breyfogle"/&gt; Despite this regular equivocation of Anarky with murder and villainy in DC Comics character guides, the company made efforts to describe the character in heroic terms in promoting the 1999 ''Anarky'' series. During this time, DC Comics described Anarky as an "anti-establishment loose cannon trying to do good as a hero to the disenfranchised".&lt;ref name="Comics International"/&gt;

===Political and philosophical themes===
{{quote box|align=right|width=25em|quote="(Anarky is) a philosophical action hero, an Aristotle in tights, rising above mere "crime-fighter" status into the realm of incisive social commentary. In fact, Anarky exists primarily to challenge the status quo of hierarchical power, and he may be the first mainstream comics hero of his type to do it consistently and with such rational intelligence."|source=—Norm Breyfogle, 1998.&lt;ref name="Breyfogle 1"/&gt;}}
In the initial years following Anarky's creation, Grant rarely incorporated the character into Batman stories, being reserved for stories in which the author wished to make a philosophical point.&lt;ref name="Grant"/&gt; Originally, Grant created Anarky as an [[anarchism|anarchist]] with [[Socialism|socialist]] and [[Populism|populist]] leanings. In this early incarnation, Anarky was designed as an avatar for Grant's personal meditations on political philosophy, and specifically for his burgeoning sympathy for anarchism.&lt;ref name="Best/Grant/Breyfogle"/&gt;

Within the books, the nature of the character's political opinions were often expressed through the character's rhetoric, and by heavy use of the [[Anarchist symbolism#Circle-A|circle-A]] as a character gimmick. The character's tools often incorporate the circle-A motif into them. In his earliest incarnation, he would also use red [[aerosol paint|spray-paint]] to leave the circle-A as a calling card at crime scenes.&lt;ref name ="Detective Comics No.608"/&gt; The circle-A has also been used to decorate the character's base of operations, either as [[graffiti]] or suspended from wall [[tapestry|tapestries]].&lt;ref name="Robin No.181"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Robin Annual No.1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Detective Comics No.620 (2)"/&gt;

In some instances, Anarky's political behavior would stand as the only political element of the story,&lt;ref name="Robin Annual No.1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Batman: SotB No.40 (3)"/&gt; while in other instances, entire stories would be framed to create a political parable. In ''Batman: Shadow of the Bat Annual'' #2, an ''[[Elseworlds]]'' story entitled "The Tyrant", Grant made dictatorship and the corrupting influence of power the primary theme. Batman (under the influence of [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Jonathan Crane]]) uses his resources to usurp power in the city of [[Gotham City|Gotham]] and institute a police state in which he exercises hegemonic control over the city's population.  Anarky becomes a [[Resistance movement|resistance leader]], undermining the centers of Batman's power and ultimately overthrowing Bruce Wayne's tyranny.&lt;ref name="Batman: SotB Annual"/&gt; The story ends with a quote by [[Mikhail Bakunin]]: "(For reasons of the state) black becomes white and white becomes black, the horrible becomes humane and the most dastardly felonies and atrocious crimes become meritorious acts."&lt;ref name="Bakunin"/&gt; During the early years of the character's development, virtually no writers other than Grant used Anarky in DC publications. In the singular portrayal by an author other than Grant during this period, writer Kevin Dooley used Anarky in an issue of ''[[Green Arrow]]'', producing an explicitly [[Gun politics in the United States|anti-firearm]] themed story. Throughout the narrative, dialogue between Anarky and Green Arrow conveys the need for [[direct action]], as Anarky attempts to persuade Oliver Queen to sympathize with militant, economic sabotage in pursuit of social justice.&lt;ref name="GA V.2 No.89"/&gt;
[[File:Clip - Detective Comics -620 (August 1990).jpg|thumb|left|Lonnie Machin defends his actions in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' No.620. Political elements include Machin's dialogue, the [[Anarchist symbolism#Circle-A|circle-A]] painted in the background, and an issue of ''[[Black Flag (newspaper)|Black Flag]]'' being read in the foreground by [[Tim Drake]].&lt;ref name="Detective Comics No.620 (2)"/&gt;]]
Literary cues illustrated into scenes were occasionally used whenever Anarky was a featured character in a comic. During the Anarky limited series, fluttering newspapers were used to bear headlines alluding to social problems.&lt;ref name="Anarky Vol.1 No.1 (2)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Anarky Vol.1 No.3 (1)"/&gt; Occasionally, the titles of books found in Anarky's room would express the character's philosophical, political, or generally esoteric agenda. In both ''[[Detective Comics]]'' No.620 and ''[[Batman: Shadow of the Bat]]'' No.40, a copy of ''[[V for Vendetta]]'' can be seen on Lonnie Machin's bookshelf as homage.&lt;ref name="Batman: SotB No.40 (3)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Detective Comics No.620 (3)"/&gt; Other books in his room at different times have included ''Apostles of Revolution'' by [[Max Nomad]], ''[[The Anarchists (book)|The Anarchists]]'' by [[James Joll]], books labeled "''[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon]]''" and "''[[Mikhail Bakunin|Bakunin]]''", and an issue of ''[[Black Flag (newspaper)|Black Flag]]''.&lt;ref name="Detective Comics No.620 (3)"/&gt; Non-anarchist material included books labeled "''[[Plato]]''", "''[[Aristotle]]''", and "''[[Emanuel Swedenborg|Swedenborg]]''",&lt;ref name="Batman: SotB No.40 (3)"/&gt; and a copy of ''Synergetics'', by [[Buckminster Fuller]].&lt;ref name="Anarky Vol.1 No.4"/&gt; The character also made references to ''Universe'' by [[Scudder Klyce]], an extremely rare book.&lt;ref name="Detective Comics No.609"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Batman: SotB No.41"/&gt; When asked if he was concerned readers would be unable to follow some of the more obscure literary references, Grant explained that he hadn't expected many to do so, but reported encountering some who had, and that one particular reader of the 1999 ''Anarky'' series had carried out an ongoing correspondence with him on the topic as of 2005.&lt;ref name="Berridge"/&gt;
{{quote box|align=right|width=25em|quote="Although I haven't read them in chronological order I would think it would be quite easy to see the parallel between Anarky's thought processes and my own thought processes."|source=—Alan Grant, 1997.&lt;ref name="Kraft"/&gt;}}
Over the course of several years, Grant's political opinions shifted from [[libertarian socialism]] to [[free market]] based philosophies. Grant later speculated that this transformation would be detectable within stories he'd written. By 1997, Grant's philosophy settled on Neo-Tech, which was developed by [[Frank R. Wallace]], and when given the opportunity to write an ''Anarky'' miniseries, he decided to redesign the character accordingly. Grant laid out his reasoning in an interview just before the first issue's publication. "I felt he was the perfect character" to express Neo-Tech philosophy, Grant explained, "because he's human, he has no special powers, the only power he's got is the power of his own rational consciousness".&lt;ref name="Kraft"/&gt; This new characterization was continued in the 1999 ''Anarky'' ongoing series.

The limited and ongoing series were both heavily influenced by Neo-Tech, despite the term never appearing in a single issue. New emphasis was placed on previously unexplored themes, such as the depiction of Anarky as an [[atheism|atheist]] and a [[rationalism|rationalist]].&lt;ref name="Anarky Vol.1 No.1 (3)"/&gt; Grant also expressed a desire to use the comic as a vehicle for his thoughts concerning the [[Philosophy of mind|mind]] and [[consciousness]],&lt;ref name="Cooling" /&gt; and made [[Bicameralism (psychology)|bicameralism]] a major theme of both series.&lt;ref name="Anarky Vol.1 No.1 (4)"/&gt; While this trend led the character away from the philosophies he had espoused previously, the primary theme of the character remained [[anti-statism]]. In one issue of the 1999 series, a character asked what the nature of Anarky's politics were. The response was that Anarky was neither [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]], nor [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]], and that he "transcends the political divide".&lt;ref name="Anarky Vol.2 No.6"/&gt; Grant has specified that he categorized Anarky politically as an anarchist who "tried to put anarchist values into action."&lt;ref name="Kleinhenz"/&gt; Norm Breyfogle also stated in 1999 that the character represented anarchist philosophy,&lt;ref name="H-C Chan"/&gt; but said in 2003 that he believed the Neo-Tech influence allowed Anarky to be classified as an [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|objectivist]].&lt;ref name="Best/Breyfogle"/&gt;

==Skills, abilities, and resources==
{{quote box|align=right|width=25em|quote="The ''audaciousness'' of a non-super-powered teenager functioning as a highly effective adult without a mentor is pretty iconoclastic in a genre where it sometimes appears 'it's all been done before.'"|source=—Norm Breyfogle, 1998.&lt;ref name="Breyfogle 1"/&gt;}}
Grant developed Anarky as a [[superhero#Types of superheroes|gadgeteer]]—a character who relies on inventions and [[gadget]]s to compensate for a lack of [[Superpower (ability)|superpowers]]—and as a [[child prodigy]]. In early incarnations he was portrayed as highly intelligent, but inexperienced. Lacking in many skills, he survived largely by his ingenuity. In accordance with this, he would occasionally quote the maxim, "the essence of anarchy is surprise".&lt;ref name ="Detective Comics No.609"/&gt; By 1991 a profile of the character, following the introduction of Anarky's skills as a hacker in the "Rite of Passage" storyline of ''Detective Comics'' No.620, described that "Lonnie's inventive genius is equaled only by his computer wizardry."&lt;ref name="Who's Who"/&gt;

Anarky's abilities were increased during the character's two eponymous series, being portrayed as having enormous talents in both engineering and computer technology, as well as prodigiously developing skills in martial arts. This was indicated in several comics published just before the ''Anarky'' miniseries, and later elaborated upon within the series itself.

===Early skills and equipment===
Described as physically frail in comparison to the adults he opposes, the character often utilizes cunning, improvisation, and intelligence as tools for victory. During the [[Batman: Knightfall|Knightfall]] saga, the character states, "The essence of anarchy is ''surprise'' – spontaneous action&amp;nbsp;... even when it does require a little ''planning''!"&lt;ref name="Batman: SotB No.16"/&gt;

Early descriptions of the character's gadgets focused on low-tech, improvised tools and munitions, such as [[flare gun]]s,&lt;ref name="Batman: SotB No.18"/&gt; swing lines,&lt;ref name="Robin Annual No.1"/&gt; [[shuriken|throwing stars]],&lt;ref name="Batman: SotB No.40 (4)"/&gt; small spherical [[Shell (projectile)|shelled]] [[Improvised explosive device|explosives]] with [[Fuse (explosives)|burning fuses]] (mimicking [[Mortar (weapon)|round mortar bombs]] stereotypically associated with 19th-century anarchists),&lt;ref name ="Detective Comics No.608"/&gt; gas-bombs,&lt;ref name ="Detective Comics No.608"/&gt; [[smoke bomb]]s,&lt;ref name="Robin Annual No.1"/&gt; and his primary weapon, a powerful [[Electroshock weapon|electric stun baton]] shaped as a golden cane.&lt;ref name ="Detective Comics No.608"/&gt;

As a wanted criminal, Anarky's methods and goals were described as leaving him with little logistical support amongst the heroic community, or the public at large, relegating him to underground operation. When in need of assistance, he would call on the help of the homeless community in Gotham who had supported him since his first appearance.&lt;ref name="Detective Comics No.609"/&gt;

Anarky was described as having developed skills as a computer [[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]] to steal enormous sums of money from various corporations in his second appearance, part of the "Rite of Passage" storyline in ''Detective Comics'' No.620.&lt;ref name="Detective Comics No.620 (1)"/&gt; This addition to the character's skill set made him the second major hacker in the DC Universe, being preceded by [[Barbara Gordon|Barbara Gordon's]] debut as ''Oracle'',&lt;ref name="Suicide Squad Vol.1 No.23"/&gt; and was quickly adapted by 1992 to allow the character to gain information on other heroes and villains from police computer networks.&lt;ref name="Robin Annual No.1"/&gt;

According to Alan Grant, the urgency with which Anarky views his cause has necessitated that the character forsake any social life, and increase his abilities drastically over the years. "The kid's whole life is dedicated to self-improvement," wrote Grant for the ''Batman: Anarky'' introduction, "with the sole aim of destroying the parasitic elites who he considers feast off ordinary folks."&lt;ref name="Grant"/&gt; A review of the first issue of the 1999 series described Anarky as akin to a "Batman Jr." The reviewer continued, "[Grant] writes Lonnie like a teenager who is head and shoulders above the rest of the population, but still a kid."&lt;ref name="Erhardt (1)"/&gt;

In 1995, Grant used the two part "Anarky" storyline in ''Batman: Shadow of the Bat'' to alter the character's status quo in several ways that would reach their fruition in the first ''Anarky'' series. To accomplish this feat, several plot devices were used to increase Lonnie's abilities. To justify the character's financial independence, Anarky was described as using the internet to earn money through his online bookstore, ''Anarco'', which he used as a [[Front organization|front company]] to propagate his philosophy.  A second front organization, ''The Anarkist Foundation'', was also developed to offer grants to radical causes he supports.&lt;ref name="Batman: SotB No.40 (1)"/&gt; A ''Biofeedback Learning Enhancer'' was employed to increase Lonnie's abilities. The cybernetic device was described as being capable of [[Intelligence amplification|amplifying brain functions]] by a multiple of ten.&lt;ref name="Batman: SotB No.40 (1)"/&gt; Anarky was also described as having begun to train in martial arts, following the character's time in juvenile hall.&lt;ref name="Batman: SotB No.40 (2)"/&gt;

The 1997 ''Anarky'' limited series saw the earlier plot devices of the preceding "Anarky" storyline become narrative justifications for drastically upgraded skill sets. Anarky's earlier brain augmentation was now described as having "fused" the hemispheres of his brain, in a reference to [[Bicameralism (psychology)|bicameralism]]. Meanwhile, the character's business enterprises were said to have gained him millions of dollars in the [[dot-com bubble]]. The character's combat abilities were described as having progressed remarkably, and to have included training in multiple styles which he "integrated" into a [[Hybrid martial arts|hybrid fighting style]].&lt;ref name="Anarky Vol.1 No.3 (2)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Anarky Vol.1 No.1 (1)"/&gt;  Even the character's primary stun baton weapon was enhanced, with a [[grappling hook]] incorporated into the walking stick itself to allow dual functionality.&lt;ref name="Anarky Vol.1 No.1 (1)"/&gt;

With this enhanced intelligence and financial assets, the 1999 ongoing series narrates that Anarky went on to create an on-board [[Artificial intelligence|AI computer]], MAX (''Multi-Augmented X-Program'');&lt;ref name = "Anarky Vol.2 No.1"/&gt; a crude but fully functioning [[teleportation]] device capable of summoning a [[boom tube]],&lt;ref name="Anarky Vol.1 No.2 (1)"/&gt; and secretly excavated an underground base below the [[Washington Monument]].&lt;ref name="Anarky Vol.2 No.1"/&gt; Portrayed as an atheist by Grant, Anarky espoused the belief that "science is magic explained", and was shown to use scientific analysis to explain and manipulate esoteric forces of magic and energy.&lt;ref name="Anarky Vol.1 No.2 (2)"/&gt; Anarky's skill in software cracking was further increased to allow him to tap into [[Batcomputer|Batman's supercomputer]],&lt;ref name="Anarky Vol.1 No.1 (1)"/&gt; and the [[Justice League Watchtower]].&lt;ref name = "Anarky Vol.2 No.1"/&gt;

This evolution in Anarky's abilities was criticized as having overpowered the character in a ''Fanzing'' review of the ''Anarky'' ongoing series. The rapid development was seen as preventing the [[suspension of disbelief]] in the young character's adventures, which was said to have contributed to the failure of the series.&lt;ref name="Morrison"/&gt; This view stood in contrast with that of Breyfogle, who considered Anarky's heightened skill set to be a complementary feature, and contended that Anarky's advanced abilities lent uniqueness to the character. Breyfogle wrote, "Anarky's singularity is due partly to his being, at his age, nearly as competent as Batman."&lt;ref name="Breyfogle 1"/&gt;

===Abilities as Moneyspider===
In Fabian Niciza's stories for ''[[Red Robin (comic book)|Red Robin]]'', Lonnie Machin's abilities as Moneyspider were revamped, with the character taking on the persona of an "electronic ghost."&lt;ref name="Nicieza 1"/&gt; Comatose, Moneyspider was free to act through his mind via connections to the internet, and interacted with others via text messaging and a speech synthesizer. In this condition, he acts to "create an international web that will [access] the ins and outs of criminal and corporate operations."&lt;ref name="Red Robin No.17"/&gt; Within virtual reality, the character's augmented intelligence was described as a "fused bicameral mind", able to maintain a presence online at all times, while another part of his mind separately interacted with others offline.&lt;ref name="Red Robin No.19 (1)"/&gt;

===Costume===

====Designs by Norm Breyfogle====
[[File:Anarchy-symbol-red.svg|thumb|The circle-A, a common [[Anarchist symbolism|anarchist symbol]], is frequently used as a [[gimmick]] to decorate Anarky's costume. The color red was chosen as a symbolic protest against war.&lt;ref name="H-C Chan"/&gt;]]

Anarky's costume has undergone several phases in design, the first two of which were created by Norm Breyfogle, in accordance with Grant's suggestions.
The original costume was composed of a large, flowing red robe, over a matching red [[jumpsuit]]. A red, wide brimmed hat baring the circle-A insignia; a golden, metallic face mask; and red hood, completed the outfit. The folds of the robe concealed various weapons and gadgets.&lt;ref name="Detective Comics No.608"/&gt; Breyfogle later expressed that the color scheme chosen held symbolic purpose. The red robes "represented the blood of all the innocents sacrificed in war." The gold cane, face mask, and circle-A symbol represented purity and spirituality. The connection to spirituality was also emphasized through the hat and loose fabric, which mimicked that of a [[priest]]. Breyfogle believed the loose clothes "[went] better with a wide-brimmed hat. It's more of a colloquial style of clothing&amp;nbsp;..." However, observers have noted that Breyfogle's Christian upbringing may have also inspired the "priestly analogy."&lt;ref name="H-C Chan"/&gt;
{{quote box|align=left|width=25em|quote="[Anarky's fake head] was unique and provided a drawing challenge in that the reader should later say, 'So ''that's'' why Anarky looked so awkward!' Such awkwardness, in fact, was one reason I ''eliminated'' the fake head in the miniseries&amp;nbsp;... |source=—Norm Breyfogle, 1998.&lt;ref name="Breyfogle 1"/&gt;}}
This costume was also designed to disguise Anarky's height, and so included a "head extender" under his hood, which elongated his neck. This design was also intended to create a subtle awkwardness that the reader would subconsciously suspect as being fake, until the reveal at the end of Anarky's first appearance. Despite the revelation of this false head, which would no longer serve its intended purpose at misdirecting the reader, the head extender was included in several return appearances, while at irregular times other artists drew the character without the extender.{{Ref label|E|V|none}} This discontinuity in the character's design ended when Breyfogle finally eliminated this aspect of the character during the 1997 limited series, expressing that the character's height growth had ended its usefulness.&lt;ref name="Breyfogle 1"/&gt; In reality, Breyfogle's decision was also as a result of the difficulty the design presented, being "awkward [to draw] in action situations."&lt;ref name="H-C Chan"/&gt;
{{quote box|align=right|width=25em|quote="...&amp;nbsp;as an antihero, Anarky doesn't have to be beholden to one fashion statement."|source=—Vera H-C Chan, 1999.&lt;ref name="H-C Chan"/&gt;}}
Anarky's second costume was used during the 1999 ongoing ''Anarky'' series. It retained the red jumpsuit, gold mask, and hat, but excised the character's red robes. New additions to the costume included a red cape, a utility belt modeled after [[Batman's utility belt]], and a single, large circle-A across the chest, akin to [[Superman|Superman's]] iconic [[Superman logo|"S" shield]]. The golden mask was also redesigned as a reflective, but flexible material that wrapped around Anarky's head, allowing for the display of facial movement and emotion. This had previously been impossible, as the first mask was made of inflexible metal. Being a relatively new creation, Breyfogle encountered no editorial resistance in the new character design: "Because [Anarky] doesn't have 50 years of merchandising behind him, I can change his costume whenever I want&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name="H-C Chan"/&gt; Within the ''Anarky'' series, secondary costumes were displayed in Anarky's base of operations. Each was slightly altered in design, but followed the same basic theme of color, jumpsuit, cloak, and hat. These were designed for use in various situations, but only one, a "universal battle suit", was used during the brief series.&lt;ref name="Anarky Vol.2 No.1"/&gt; These suits were also intended to be seen in the unpublished ninth issue of the series.&lt;ref name="Anarky Vol.2 No.9"/&gt;

Armstrong version of Anarky.&lt;ref name="Robin No.182 promotional cover"/&gt;
}}
In 2005, James Peaty's ''Green Arrow'' story, "Anarky in the USA", featured a return to some of the costume elements used prior to the ''Anarky'' series. Drawn by [[Eric Battle]], the circle-A chest icon was removed in favor of a loose fabric [[jumpsuit]] completed with a flowing cape. The flexible mask was replaced with the previous, unmoving metallic mask, but illustrated with a new reflective quality. This design element was used at times to reflect the face of someone Anarky looked at, creating a mirroring of a person's emotions upon Anarky's own mask.&lt;ref name="GA V.3 No.51"/&gt; This same effect was later reused in two issues of ''Red Robin''.&lt;ref name="Red Robin No.19 (2)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Red Robin No.21"/&gt; For the usurpation of the "Anarky" mantle by [[General (DC Comics)|Ulysses Armstrong]], [[Freddie Williams II]] illustrated a new costume design for Armstrong that featured several different design elements. While retaining the primary colors of gold and red, the traditional hat was replaced with a hood, and a new three-piece [[cuirass]] with shoulder guards and leather belt was added. The mask was also altered from an expressionless visage to a menacing grimace.&lt;ref name="Robin No.181"/&gt; This design was later re-illustrated by [[Marcus To]] in the ''Red Robin'' series, but with a new color scheme in which red was replaced with black.&lt;ref name="Red Robin No.16"/&gt;

}}
In attempting to present the character as a figurative mirror to Batman, the costume worn by Anarky in ''Beware the Batman'' was radically redesigned as entirely white, in contrast to Batman's black [[Batsuit]]. It consists of a tightly worn jumpsuit, cape, hood, flexible mask with white-eye lenses, and a utility belt. Upon the chest is a small, stylized circle-A in black.&lt;ref name="Collura"/&gt; The design was negatively compared by reviewers to the longstanding design for [[Moon Knight]], a [[Marvel Comics]] superhero.&lt;ref name="Asburry (1)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Greear"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sims"/&gt;

The costume redesign for Anarky in ''Batman: Arkham Origins'', while stylized, attempted to thematically highlight the character's anarchist sentiments by updating his appearance utilizing [[black bloc]] iconography.&lt;ref name="O'Dwyer/Holmes"/&gt; Donning a red puffer [[flight jacket]], [[hoodie]] and [[cargo pants]], the character sported gold accents decorating his black belt, backpack and combat boots, and completed this with an orange [[Kerchief|bandana]] wrapped below his neck. His metallic mask was replaced with a white theatrical stage mask, evocative of the [[Guy Fawkes mask]] made popular among protesters by ''[[V for Vendetta]]'' and [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]].&lt;ref name="Sessler/Holmes"/&gt; The jacket is itself emblazoned with a painted circle-A. "He looks like a street protester in our game," commented Eric Holmes, the creative director of the game, "and there's no accident to that."&lt;ref name="GamerHubVideos"/&gt; This design was later used as model for a DC Collectibles figure, released as part of a series based on villains featured in the game.&lt;ref name="Dietsch"/&gt;

==Reception==

===Impact on creators===
{{quote box|align=right|width=25em|quote="A large part of our relationship, especially when we got into doing Anarky, became a friendly philosophical debate over politics and conspiracy theory; mysticism versus scientism and all this other stuff. We came to really enjoy those debates, even when they (rarely) got a little heated."|source=—Norm Breyfogle, 2006.&lt;ref name="Irving/Grant/Breyfogle"/&gt;}}
In the years that followed the creation of Anarky, both Norm Breyfogle and Alan Grant experienced changes in their personal and professional lives which they attributed to that collaboration. Each man acknowledged the primary impact of the character to have been on their mutual friendship and intellectual understanding. In particular, their time developing the ''Anarky'' series led to a working relationship centered on esoteric debate, discussion, and mutual respect.&lt;ref name="Cooling"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Best/Breyfogle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Irving/Grant/Breyfogle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Klaehn/Breyfogle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Close"/&gt;

Over time, Anarky emerged as each man's favorite character, with Grant wishing he could emulate the character,&lt;ref name="Cooling"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Klaehn/Grant"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chmielewski"/&gt; and remarking that "Anarky in Gotham City" was the most personal story he had ever written, and the foremost among his three favorite stories he had ever written for the Batman mythos.&lt;ref name="Butcher"/&gt; Of Breyfogle, Grant complimented that the former "draws Anarky as if he loves the character."&lt;ref name="Irving/Grant"/&gt; While Breyfogle acknowledged that Anarky was his favorite of the creations they collaborated on,&lt;ref name="Breyfogle 1"/&gt; he felt that his own appreciation was not as great as Grant's, commenting that Anarky was "Alan's baby".&lt;ref name="Close"/&gt;

With the cancellation of the Anarky series, and the eventual departure of each artist from DC Comics{{--}}first by Grant, followed by Breyfogle{{--}}their mutual career paths split, and Anarky entered into a period of obscurity. During this period, Breyfogle came to suspect that the treatment each man, and Anarky, had received from their former employer was suspect.&lt;ref name="Best/Breyfogle"/&gt; While acknowledging that he lacked evidence, he held a "nagging feeling" that he and Grant had each been "blacklisted" from DC Comics as a result of the controversial views expressed in the ''Anarky'' series' second volume.&lt;ref name="Klaehn/Breyfogle"/&gt;

While professing that Anarky was the character for whom he was proudest, and that the character's narratives were among his best achievements for the amount of reaction they generated among readers, the character was also a source of some regret for Grant. Reflecting on his early secret plan to transform Lonnie Machin into a new [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], Grant has stated that though he came to appreciate the character of [[Tim Drake]], he occasionally experiences "twinges of regret that Anarky wasn’t chosen as the new sidekick for comics' greatest hero."&lt;ref name="Butcher"/&gt; Grant has also stated that he attempted to distance himself from the direction of Anarky following his termination from DC Comics, and actively tried to avoid learning about the fate of Anarky and other characters he had come to care about. He often found himself disappointed to see how some characters were used or, as he felt, were mismanaged.&lt;ref name="Luiz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Forrest"/&gt; Grant later joked on his disillusion in the handling of Anarky, "if you create something that's close to your heart and you don't own it, 'Oh woe is me!'"&lt;ref name="Best/Grant/Breyfogle"/&gt; In 2011, DC Comics initiated a special ''[[DC Retroactive]]'' series of comics, exploring different periods in the publication history of popular characters. Both Grant and Breyfogle were invited to participate, and collaborated to reproduce a story in the style of their classic ''Batman: Shadow of the Bat'' series. Grant chose to author a story featuring the [[Ventriloquist (comics)|Ventriloquist]]. However, he had been tempted to author a story featuring Anarky, only reconsidering the idea on the basis that his disassociation from the character had left him unfamiliar with what had become of Anarky's canonical status at the time.&lt;ref name="Ashby/Grant"/&gt;

As Anarky was created while Grant and Breyfogle were operating under "work-for-hire" rules, [[DC Comics]] owns all rights to the Anarky character. Following the cancellation of the ''Anarky'' series, both men attempted to buy the rights to Anarky from the company, but their offer was declined.&lt;ref name="Berridge"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cooling"/&gt;

===Readership reaction===
{{quote box|align=right|width=25em|quote="My character Anarky - a 15-year-old vigilante kid - tried to put anarchist values into action. He's immensely popular - or, at least, he was - in countries like Mexico, Peru, Chile, and Argentina, where comic fans were able to empathize with his ethos a lot more than Americans did."|source=—Alan Grant, 2013.&lt;ref name="Kleinhenz"/&gt;}}

When an interviewer commented that Anarky was popular among fans in 2003, in the midst of the character's period of obscurity, Norm Breyfogle offered a caveat: "Well, in certain segments of the comic book industry, I suppose." Breyfogle continued, "It has some diehard fans. But, DC doesn't seem to want to do anything with him. Maybe it's because of his anti-authoritarian philosophy, a very touchy subject in today's world."&lt;ref name="Carey"/&gt;

The sense that Anarky is appreciated by certain fans is one shared by Alan Grant, who noted that the character's stories routinely generated more reader mail than any other he wrote.&lt;ref name="Butcher"/&gt; Commenting on the popularity of the ''Anarky'' series, Grant acknowledged the failure of the series, but pointed out that it was very popular among some readers: "It wasn't terribly popular in the States, although I received quite a few letters (especially from philosophy students) saying the comic had changed their entire mindset. But Anarky was very popular in South America, where people have had a long and painful taste of totalitarianism, in a way the US is just entering."&lt;ref name="Berridge"/&gt;

Sales of the ''Anarky'' limited series were high enough to green light an ongoing series,&lt;ref name="Comics International"/&gt; with Breyfogle commenting, "[it] did well enough so that DC is willing to listen to Alan’s idea for a sequel if we wanted to pitch them."&lt;ref name="Cook"/&gt; However, despite the sales, Grant was still concerned the character lacked enough support among fans to sustain an ongoing series.&lt;ref name="Carey"/&gt; While the ongoing series did find an audience amongst Latin American nations—Mexico and Argentina in particular—it failed in the United States, where Alan Grant has lamented that the comic was doomed to eventual cancellation, as DC Comics "[doesn't] take foreign sales into consideration when counting their cash".&lt;ref name="Cooling"/&gt;

Acknowledging the failure of the ongoing ''Anarky'' series, Grant has conceded that its themes, in particular his interest in exploring esoteric concepts such as [[philosophy of mind]], likely resulted in "plummeting" sales.&lt;ref name="Cooling"/&gt; Breyfogle claimed the difficulty of combining escapist entertainment with social commentary as his explanation for the series' failure. Breyfogle wrote at the time: "''Anarky'' is a hybrid of the mainstream and the not-quite-so-mainstream. This title may have experienced exactly what every 'half-breed' suffers: rejection by both groups with which it claims identity."&lt;ref name="Breyfogle 2"/&gt; Besides the themes, commentators have also found the escalation of Anarky's skills and special heroics as a source of criticism among readers. "I liked the original concept behind Anarky: a teenage geek who reads ''[[The Will to Power (manuscript)|The Will to Power]]'' one too many times and decides to go out and fix the world," wrote a critic for ''Fanzing'', an online newsletter produced by comic book fans and professionals. "But the minute he wound up getting $100 million in a Swiss Bank account, owning a building, impressing [[Darkseid|Darksied]]{{Small|{{sic}}}}, getting a Boom Tube and was shown as being able to outsmart Batman, outhack [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]] and generally be invincible, I lost all interest I had in the character."&lt;ref name="Morrison"/&gt;

In 2014, [[Comic Book Resources]] held an informal poll which asked readers to vote for the best characters within the Batman franchise, in celebration of the 75th anniversary of the 1939 creation of "the Caped Crusader". Anarky was placed at No. 31 among the best villains, coming nearly 25 years after the character's own creation.&lt;ref name="Cronin"/&gt;

===Political analysis and relevance===
{{quote box|align=right|width=25em|quote="Anarky is a direct contrast to Batman – he is an active agent of change while Batman is simply a reactive agent, reinforcing the status quo (as all corporate superheroes do)&amp;nbsp;... "|source=—Greg Burgas, 2006.&lt;ref name="Burgas"/&gt;}}
The philosophical nature of the character has invited political critiques, and resulted in comparisons drawn against the political and philosophical views of other fictional characters. Of the various positive analyses drawn from Anarky, two points which are continuously touched upon by critics are that Anarky is among the most unusual of Batman's rogue gallery, and that his challenge to the ideologies of superheroes is his best feature.

The authors of "I'm Not Fooled By That Cheap Disguise", a 1991 essay deconstructing the Batman mythos, refer to Anarky as a challenge to Batman's social and political world view, and to the political position indirectly endorsed by the themes of a Batman adventure. As the Batman mythos is centered on themes of retribution and the protection of property rights, the invitation to readers to identify with Batman's vigilantism is an invitation to adopt political authoritarianism. The authors summarize that position as "the inviolability of property relations and the justification of their defense by any means necessary (short of death)." However, the authors contend that Anarky "potentially redefines crime" and invites the reader to identify with a new political position in favor of the disenfranchised, which Batman "can not utterly condemn". The authors contend that the creation of Anarky and dialogue by other characters represented a shift towards "self-conscious awareness of the Batman's hegemonic function, questioning the most central component of the Batman's identity—the nature of crime and his relation to it." However, the authors remain skeptical of Anarky's commercial nature, pointing out Anarky could be "incorporated as another marketing technique [...] The contradictions of capitalism would thus permit the commodification of criticisms as long as they resulted in profits."&lt;ref name="E. Pearson/Uriccio"/&gt;

With the publication in 2005 of an issue of ''[[Green Arrow]]'' in which Anarky guest-starred, writer James Peaty juxtaposed Anarky's radical philosophy with the [[progressivism|liberal progressive]] beliefs of Green Arrow: "Everyone always goes on about what a radical Ollie is and I wanted to show that maybe that isn't the case&amp;nbsp;... especially as Ollie's radical credentials are pretty antiquated&amp;nbsp;... Anarky as a character—and as a broader idea—is much more radical than Ollie."&lt;ref name="M. Contino"/&gt;

Greg Burgas, of ''Comic Book Resources'', critiqued Anarky as "one of the more interesting characters of the past fifteen or twenty years [...] because of what he wants to accomplish..." Burgas continued, comparing the nature of Anarky as a change agent against Batman: "He is able to show how ineffective Batman is against the real problems of society, and although Batman stops his spree, we find ourselves sympathizing much more with Anarky than with the representative of the status quo."&lt;ref name="Burgas"/&gt;

Anarky's appearance in ''Batman: Arkham Origins'' included a speech delivered at the conclusion of the character's story arch. The player is given the opportunity to observe Anarky after he has been defeated, and watch as the teenager enters a monologue in which he laments the downfall of society, tries to reconcile his admiration for Batman, and ultimately denounces the Caped Crusader as a false hero. Nick Dinicola of [[PopMatters]], in comparing the game to its predecessor, ''Batman: Arkham City'', asserted that the narrative of ''Origins'' consistently challenged Batman's ideological reasons for acting as he does, whereas ''City'' uncritically took his motivations as a given. "Anarky’s wonderful speech takes Batman to task for the contradictions in his symbolism," writes Dinicola, choosing that moment in the game as one of several examples of this theme. "Considering that Batman is very explicitly a symbol of fear, Anarky is equating the rise of Batman with the downfall of society." Dinicola was also of the opinion that the willingness to use characters like Anarky to scrutinize Batman's heroism, rather than simply assert it, allowed the game to ultimately prove and uphold Batman as a heroic figure in a way ''City'' could not. To Dinicola, this validated the act of challenging a superhero's traditional interpretation in service to the story.&lt;ref name="Dinicola"/&gt;

In ''Batman and Philosophy'', an analysis of various philosophies which intersect with the Batman mythos, Anarky's critique of the [[State (polity)|state]] is compared favorably to that of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]: "The Nietzschean state constitutes a 'new idol,' one that is no less repressive than its predecessors, as it defines good and evil for, and hangs a 'sword and a hundred appetites' over, the faithful. No Batman villain sees this as clearly as Anarky&amp;nbsp;..." However, Anarky's behavior was also interpreted as an attempt to impose an even more restrictive order, with examples presented from ''Batman: Anarky'', in which Lonnie Machin lectures fellow juvenile detainees in "Tomorrow Belongs to Us", explains his motivations in a self-righteous farewell letter to his parents in "Anarky", and creates a fantasy dystopia in a distorted reflection of his desired society in "Metamorphosis": "His [Anarky's] search for an organizing principle that is less repressive than the state fails." This is sharply compared with Batman, described as moderating his impulses towards social control.&lt;ref name="White/Arp/Irwin"/&gt; Dialogue from ''Detective Comics'' is employed, in which Batman compares himself to Anarky and denies the latter legitimacy: "The fact is, no man can be allowed to set himself up as judge, jury and executioner."&lt;ref name ="Detective Comics No.608"/&gt;

Far less favorable views of Anarky have also been offered. [[Newsarama]] contributor George Marston was especially scathing of the character's politics and costume, placing Anarky at No.8 on a list of the "Top 10 Worst Batman villains of all time." Deriding the character as a "living embodiment of an [[Avril Lavigne]] t-shirt", he pointed out the pointlessness of being inspired to super heroics by radical philosophy, and the contradictory nature of fighting crime as an anarchist. He concluded by referring to the unsuccessful ''Anarky'' series as proof that "bad decisions are timeless".&lt;ref name="Marston"/&gt; Similarly, Cracked contributor Henrik Magnusson listed Anarky's debut at No.3 on a list of "5 Disastrous Attempts at Political Commentary in Comic Books." Magnusson's scorn focused on Anarky's poorly written speeches, which he derided as "pedantic" and laden with "pseudo-philosophical catchphrases." Referring to the original identity of Lonnie Machin as a "naive pre-teen", Magnusson considered this fine satire of "base-level philosophy" and teen rebellion. However, the understanding that Grant had intended Anarky to be a vehicle for his personal views, and that the "[[Anarky in Gotham City]]" narrative describes Batman as sympathetic to his goals, if not his methods, upset Magnusson.&lt;ref name="Magnusson"/&gt;
{{quote box|align=left|width=25em|quote="I think Anarky's age is right now. He looks like a street protester. He looks like Anonymous. He's like one of these guys who wants to go out there and change the world to what he believes is the better, and I think of all the Batman enemies, and one of the reasons I'm most excited about Anarky, is he feels relevant today." |source=—Eric Holmes, 2013.&lt;ref name="Sessler/Holmes"/&gt;}}
Several global events of the early 2010s included the rise of hacktivist groups such as [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] and [[LulzSec]]; large scale protest movements, including the [[Arab Spring]], [[Occupy movement]], and [[2012 Quebec student protests|Quebec student protests]]; the [[Crypto-anarchism|crypto-anarchist]] activity on the part of [[Defense Distributed]] and [[Cody Wilson]]; and the various information leaks to [[WikiLeaks]] by [[Chelsea Manning]], the [[2012–13 Stratfor email leak|Stratfor email leak]] by Anonymous and [[Jeremy Hammond]], and the [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)|global surveillance disclosures]] by [[Edward Snowden]]. The rapid succession of these events led some media commentators to insist that Anarky's relevance as a character had dramatically increased, and recommended that the character receive a higher profile in media.&lt;ref name="Asburry (2)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Burgas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Erhardt (2)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gilbert"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rabinowitz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Thill"/&gt; This sentiment led the creative team that developed ''Batman: Arkham Origins'' to include Anarky in the game. Describing Anarky's anti-government and anti-corporate agenda, Holmes acknowledged the relevance of anarchism in the contemporary protest movements of the time as a factor in the choice to include the character in the game, and to update his appearance to that of a street protester with a gang resembling a social movement.&lt;ref name="O'Dwyer/Holmes"/&gt; Holmes stressed in one interview, "In the real world, this is Anarky's moment. Right now. Today."&lt;ref name="O'Dwyer/Holmes"/&gt; Even as early as 2005, James Peaty recommended that Anarky should be included in more publications in the midst of the ongoing [[War on Terror]], stating "Anarky is a terrorist! How can that not be interesting in the modern climate?"&lt;ref name="M. Contino"/&gt;

====Anarchist critique====
{{quote box|align=right|width=25em|quote="[Anarky] does represent the anarchist philosophy &lt;!--The "sic" template indicates that the typo is included as a reflection of the original source. Please don't edit this quote. Either keep it or delete it, but don't "fix" it.--&gt;His whole point of existing is rolled up in his name. It's a philosophy of responsibility and freedom from the hierarchical power."{{Small|{{sic}}}}|source=—Norm Breyfogle, 1999.&lt;ref name="H-C Chan"/&gt;}}
Critics have commented on the character's depiction as an anarchist since his first appearance. According to Alan Grant, anarchists with whom he associated were angered by his creation of the character, seeing it as an act of [[Recuperation (sociology)|recuperation]] for commercial gain.&lt;ref name="Chmielewski"/&gt; Neither Grant nor Breyfogle could fully agree with this criticism. As Grant put it, "I thought I was doing them a favour you know?"&lt;ref name="Best/Grant/Breyfogle"/&gt;

In the years following the ''Anarky'' publications of the late 1990s, more receptive critiques have been offered. In assessing the presentation of anarchist philosophy in fiction, [[Mark Leier]], the director for the Centre for Labour Studies from [[Simon Fraser University]], cited Anarky as an example of the favorable treatment anarchist philosophy has occasionally received in mainstream comic books. Leier took particular note of quotations derived from the dialogue in "[[Anarky in Gotham City]]" story, in which Batman speaks positively of Anarky's intentions.&lt;ref name="Leier"/&gt; Following the cancellation of the ongoing series, [[Roderick T. Long]], an [[Anarchism|anarchist]]/[[Libertarianism|libertarian]] political commentator and Senior Scholar at the [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]], praised Anarky as "an impressive voice for liberty in today's comics".&lt;ref name="Long 2"/&gt; Margaret Killjoy's examination of anarchist fiction, ''Mythmakers &amp; Lawbreakers'', afforded Alan Grant and Anarky brief mention. Explaining the relationship Grant had with anarchism, Killjoy reviewed the characters' early incarnations as "quite wonderful."&lt;ref name="Killjoy"/&gt;

Greg Burgas, in reviewing the career of Alan Grant, specifically cited Anarky's anarchist philosophy as one of the character's most empathetic traits.  Lamenting the obscurity of the character, Burgas wished Anarky and anarchism would be presented more often: "...&amp;nbsp;anarchy as a concept is often dismissed, but it's worth looking at simply because it is so radical and untenable yet noble."&lt;ref name="Burgas"/&gt;

==Media==
{{Main article|Publication history of Anarky#List of notable media appearances|l1=Publication history of Anarky: List of notable media appearances}}
As a lesser known character in the [[DC Universe]], Anarky has a smaller library of associated comic books and significant story lines than more popular DC Comics characters. Between 1989 and 1996, Anarky was primarily written by Alan Grant in [[Batman]]-related comics, received a guest appearance in a single issue of ''[[Green Arrow]]''&lt;ref name="GA V.2 No.89" /&gt; by Kevin Dooley, and was given an entry in ''[[Who's Who in the DC Universe]]''.&lt;ref name="Who's Who"/&gt;

In the late 1990s, Anarky entered a brief period of minor prominence; first with the publication of the first ''Anarky'' volume in 1997; followed in 1998 with the ''[[Batman: Anarky]]'' collection; and in 1999, with featured appearances in both ''[[Secret Files and Origins|DCU Heroes Secret Files and Origins]]'' #1,&lt;ref name="DCU Heroes: SFaO (1)"&gt;{{Cite comic |writer=D.

After the cancellation of the ongoing series, Anarky lapsed into obscurity lasting approximately nine years. This ambiguous condition was not complete, as Anarky was sporadically used during this time. These appearances include marginal cameos in issues of ''[[Young Justice]]'',&lt;ref name="Young Justice: Sins of Youth"&gt;{{Cite comic |writer=Peter David |penciller=Todd Nauck |inker=Lary Wright |story=Justice for All |title=Young Justice: Sins of Youth |issue=1 |date=May, 2000 |publisher=DC Comics |page=10, 16, 26, 36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sins Of Youth: JLA, Jr."&gt;{{cite comic |writer=Curtis Johnson |penciller=Carlo Barberi |inker=Wayne Faucher |coinkers=Juan Vlasco |story=You Gotta Be Kidding! |title=Sins Of Youth: JLA, Jr. |issue=1 |date=May 1, 2000 |publisher=DC Comics |page=5–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Wonder Woman]]'',&lt;ref name="Wonder Woman Vol.2 No.175"&gt;{{Cite comic |writer=Phil Jimenez |penciller=Phil Jimenez |copencillers=Brandon Badeaux |inker=Lanning Stucker Marzan Jr. |coinkers=Conrad Alquiza |story=The Witch and The Warrior, part II: Girl Frenzy |title=Wonder Woman |volume=2 |issue=175 |date=December 2001 |publisher=DC Comics |page=20 |panel=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Green Arrow''.&lt;ref name="GA V.3 No.51"/&gt;

Anarky made an appearance in a 2008 issue of ''Robin'' as part of an effort to return the character to regular publication, and became a recurring cast member in the ''[[Red Robin (comic book)|Red Robin]]'' series in November 2010, until the series was cancelled in October 2011.

Lesser known among the cast of characters in the DC universe, Anarky went unused for adaptations to other media platforms throughout much of the character's existence. However, in 2013 the character was chosen to recur in ''[[Beware the Batman]]'', an animated series on Cartoon Network, voiced by [[Wallace Langham]].&lt;ref name="Langham"/&gt; Anarky debuted in the third episode, "Tests", and appeared in seven total episodes of the series before its cancellation.&lt;ref name="Collura"/&gt; Later that year, Anarky was also included in the Batman video game, ''[[Batman: Arkham Origins]]'', voiced by [[Matthew Mercer]],&lt;ref name="Totilo"&gt;{{cite web |last=Totilo |first=Stephen |url=http://kotaku.com/the-next-batman-game-still-has-a-lot-to-prove-508836920 |title=The Next Batman Game Still Has A Lot To Prove |publisher=Gawker Media |work=Kotaku |date=May 20, 2013 |accessdate=May 20, 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GlVcvsLP?url=http://kotaku.com/the-next-batman-game-still-has-a-lot-to-prove-508836920 |archivedate=May 20, 2013 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Scribblenauts Unmasked: A DC Comics Adventure]]''.&lt;ref name="O'Dwyer/Tringali"/&gt; Lonnie Machin made his live action debut in 2016, during the fourth season of ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'', in a villainous adaptation portrayed by [[Alexander Calvert]].&lt;ref name=Tyrrel/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ching (2)"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/exclusive-arrow-casts-its-anarky-for-season-4|title=EXCLUSIVE: "Arrow" Casts its Anarky for Season 4|accessdate=2015-07-17 |last=Ching |first=Albert |authorlink=Albert Ching|date=July 17, 2015 |work=Comic Book Resources |publisher=comicbookresources.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
'''{{Small|I}}.''' {{Note label|A|I|none}} ''52'' was promoted as a comic that would attempt to incorporate as many DC Comics characters as possible. In a Q&amp;A session hosted by Newsarama.com, ''52'' editor Michael Siglain answered a series of questions regarding which characters fans wanted to see in the series. Question No.19 asked "We were told Anarky would be playing a part in 52. Could you please tell us when we can expect his appearances?" Siglain's simple response to readers was, "check back in the late 40s."&lt;ref name="Brady 1"/&gt; Speculation centered on the prospect of Anarky appearing in issue No.48 of the series, as the solicited cover illustration was released to the public several weeks before the issues' publication.  On the cover, the [[Anarchy a|circle-A]] could be seen as a minor element in the background. In a review for "Week 48", ''Major Spoilers'' considered the absence of Anarky a drawback: "It's too bad we didn't see the return of Anarky as hinted by this week's cover"&lt;ref name="Schleicher"/&gt; Pop culture critic, [[Douglas Wolk]], wrote, "I guess this issue's cover is the closest we're going to get to Anarky after all (and by proxy as close as we're going to get to the Haunted Tank). Too bad."&lt;ref name="Wolk"/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
'''{{Small|II}}.''' {{Note label|B|II|none}} The 1990 ''Detective Comics'' #620 story, "Rite of Passage Part 3: Make Me a Hero", chronicles Tim Drake's first solo detective case, as he pursues an online investigation against an advanced [[grey hat]] computer [[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]]. The unknown hacker, operating under the alias "Moneyspider", has stolen millions of dollars from western corporations, including [[Wayne Enterprises]], outmaneuvering Batman's own data security in the process. He is revealed by Drake to be Lonnie Machin by the end of the issue.&lt;ref name="Detective Comics No.620 (1)"/&gt; This functioned as the antecedent for Fabian Nicieza's reintroduction of Machin under the name "Moneyspider" in 2008.&lt;br /&gt;
'''{{Small|III}}.''' {{Note label|C|III|none}}As a result of the increased renown the character gained from this appearance, speculation that Anarky would reappear in the ''[[Batman: Arkham]]'' franchise simmered in the lead up to the release of ''[[Batman: Arkham Knight]]'', with commentators predicting that the enigmatic "Arkham Knight" character would be revealed to be Anarky in adult form.&lt;ref name="Parreno"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Suddi"/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
'''{{Small|IV}}.''' {{Note label|D|IV|none}} In warning readers to avoid spoiling potential surprises for their experience in playing ''[[Batman: Arkham Origins]]'', Eric Holmes specifically referenced the Wikipedia article on the character as a resource to avoid: "You know what? If you want to enjoy the game, don't bother reading up on him, because there are a few surprises about him which will turn up in the game, and if you go read Wikipedia or something like that, it'll rob you a little bit on some of the stuff in the game, because there are some surprises about Anarky."&lt;ref name="Massongill"/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
'''{{Small|V}}.''' {{Note label|E|V|none}} Following Anarky's debut in "[[Anarky in Gotham City]]", the character's design incorporated the head extender in ''Robin Annual'' #1 (1992),&lt;ref name="Robin Annual No.1"/&gt; ''Green Arrow'' #89 (August 1994),&lt;ref name="GA V.2 No.89" /&gt; and ''The Batman Adventures'' #31 (April 1995).&lt;ref name="Batman Adventures No.31"/&gt; The head extender was not included in ''Batman: Shadow of The Bat'' #18 (October 1993),&lt;ref name="Batman: SotB No.16"/&gt; and ''The Batman Chronicles'' #1 (Summer, 1995).&lt;ref name="Batman Chronicles No.1"/&gt;

Batman was confronted by a new foe, Anarky, in 1989. Unlike the protector of Gotham City, Anarky took on corporations and governments that destroyed the environment and displaced the homeless to build bank towers. The Caped Crusader vanquished him, naturally, but admitted that Anarky's "cause was just" and "he only wanted to set the world straight." ''Detective Comics'', nos. 608 and 609, 1989. Anarky appeared in other comics and had his own for a time. The original two-part series owed much to a British graphic novel of the early 1980s, ''V for Vendetta'', by Alan Moore and David Lloyd, set in a bleak fascist Britain of the 1990s.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anthony Ray Hinton''' (born June 1, 1956) is a black man from [[Alabama]] who was [[wrongful conviction|wrongly convicted]] of the 1985 murders of two fast food restaurant managers in [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], sentenced to death, and held on the state's [[death row]] for 28 years.&lt;ref name=TheGuardian2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=TheGuardian2018/&gt;&lt;ref name=WashingtonPost&gt;Abby Phillip, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/04/03/how-the-case-against-anthony-hinton-on-death-row-for-30-years-unraveled/ "Alabama inmate free after three decades on death row. How the case against him unraveled"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', 3 April 2015 (page visited on 9 April 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NBC/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;

In 2015 the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] unanimously overturned his conviction on appeal, and the state dropped all charges against him. It was unable to affirm the forensic evidence of a gun, which was the only evidence in the first trial.&lt;ref name=TheGuardian2018&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/01/i-went-to-death-row-for-28-years-through-no-fault-of-my-own-|title='I went to death row for 28 years through no fault of my own'|last=McGreal|first=Chris|date=1 April 2018|website=[[The Guardian]]|language=en|access-date=2018-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being released, Hinton wrote and published a memoir ''The Sun Does Shine: How I Found Life and Freedom on Death Row'' (2018).&lt;ref name=TheGuardian2018/&gt;

==Background==

===Incidents===
On 25 February and 2 July 1985, two fast food managers, John Davidson and Thomas Wayne Vasona, were killed in separate incidents during armed robberies at their restaurants in Birmingham.&lt;ref name=TheGuardian2015/&gt; A survivor of a third restaurant robbery picked a photo of Anthony Ray Hinton, then age 29, from a [[Police lineup|lineup]], and the police investigated him. He worked at a supermarket warehouse and lived with his mother Buhlar Hinton at her home in rural Alabama, about a half hour north of Birmingham.&lt;ref name=TheGuardian2018/&gt; 

==Arrest, prosecution and conviction==
After Hinton's arrest, his public defense attorney did not provide adequate counsel. He said to Hinton, "All of y'all Blacks always say you didn’t do something." The credibility of his ballistics expert, who was the only one the attorney thought he could hire with funds available, was torn apart by the prosecutor because of physical limitations and lack of experience.&lt;ref name=WashingtonPost/&gt;&lt;ref name=TheGuardian2016&gt;Anthony Ray Hinton, [https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/oct/21/28-years-on-death-row "I spent 28 years on death row "], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 21 October 2016 (page visited on 1 April 2018).&lt;/ref&gt; The jury disregarded the testimony of Hinton's boss, who testified that he was at work at the time of the alleged crimes.&lt;ref name=TheGuardian2018/&gt; 

The prosecution's only evidence at the trial was a statement that ballistics tests showed four crime scene bullets matched Hinton's mother's gun, which was discovered at her house during the investigation. No fingerprints or eyewitness testimony were introduced. Hinton was convicted of each of the two murders and sentenced to death.&lt;ref name=TheGuardian2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=TheGuardian2018/&gt;

==Death row==
He was sent to [[death row]], which meant that he was held in solitary confinement for nearly three decades. During his decades in prison, he was supported by his mother's unwavering faith in his innocence, as well as that of a longtime friend, Lester Bailey, who visited him monthly. His mother died in 2002.&lt;ref name=WashingtonPost/&gt; 

While on death row, Hinton began to read a lot. He eventually organized a book club that was allowed to meet in the prison's law library. Among the authors whom the prisoners read and discussed were [[James Baldwin]] and [[Harper Lee]]. Finally Hinton was the last prisoner left on death row.&lt;ref name=TheGuardian2018/&gt;

===Appeals===
Hinton's initial appeals continued to be handled by his public defender, who lost each case. After Hinton had been on death row about a decade, the [[Equal Justice Initiative]] (a non-profit based in Montgomery, Alabama), picked up his case,&lt;ref name=TheGuardian2018/&gt; handling his defense for 16 years.&lt;ref name=NBC/&gt; During the appeals, EJI introduced evidence from three forensics experts, including one from the FBI, showing that the bullets from the crime scenes did not match Hinton's mother's gun. But the state court of Alabama refused to overturn his convictions or grant a new trial.&lt;ref name=TheGuardian2015/&gt;

==Exoneration, release and aftermath==
Responding to an appeal that reached the [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]] in 2014, the Court ruled that Hinton's original defense lawyer was "constitutionally deficient", and remanded his case to the lower court for retrial. Hinton's defense lawyer had wrongly thought he had only $1,000 available to hire a ballistics expert to rebut the state’s case on evidence. The only expert willing to testify at that price was a civil engineer with little ballistics training and limited by having one eye; he admitted in court to having trouble in operating the microscope.&lt;ref name=WashingtonPost/&gt;

After the Supreme Court ruling, on April 1, 2015 the [[Jefferson County, Alabama|Jefferson County]] district attorney’s office moved to drop the case. Their forensics experts were unable to match crime-scene bullets to Hinton's mother's gun. Prosecutors admitted that they could not match four bullets found at the crime scene with Hinton's gun, and that this was the only evidence offered in the original murder trial.&lt;ref name=TheGuardian2015&gt;{{cite web|title=Alabama man off death row after 28 years to jailers: You will answer to God|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/04/alabama-death-row-anthony-ray-hilton|author= Associated Press |website=theguardian.com|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date= 4 April 2015 |accessdate=4 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 3, 2015, Hinton was released from prison after Laura Petro, Jefferson County Circuit judge, overturned his conviction and the state dropped all charges against him.&lt;ref name=NBC&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/lethal-injection/anthony-ray-hinton-alabama-man-who-spent-30-years-death-n334881 |title=Anthony Ray Hinton, Alabama Man Who Spent 30 Years on Death Row, Has Case Dismissed |author=Daniella Silva |publisher=NBC News |accessdate=4 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-32178121 |title=Alabama death row inmate freed after 30 years |date=3 April 2015 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=4 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hinton is the 152nd person since 1973 to be exonerated from death row in the United States, and the sixth in the state of [[Alabama]]. He said, “Everybody that played a part in sending me to death row, you will answer to God.”&lt;ref name=WashingtonPost/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alabama man off death row after 28 years to jailers: You will answer to God"&gt;{{cite web|title=Alabama man off death row after 28 years to jailers: You will answer to God|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/04/alabama-death-row-anthony-ray-hilton|website=theguardian.com|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=4 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hinton filed a claim for nearly $1.5 million in compensation for his time in jail due to wrongful conviction. The legislature has resisted approval of this payment, as state authorities say that he did not prove his innocence.

Since his release, Hinton has spoken in various venues about the injustices of the Alabama judicial system and other issues related to his conviction and imprisonment. He completed a memoir entitled ''The Sun Does Shine: How I Found Life and Freedom on Death Row'' (2018), and has given readings and talks about the book and his experiences around the country.&lt;ref name=TheGuardian2018/&gt;

'''Asimakis Fotilas''' (Greek: Ασημάκης Φωτήλας) (1761–1835) was a [[Greece|Greek]] [[politician]] and a revolutionary leader.

==Biography==

He was born in [[Kalavryta]] and was a chief of Kalavryta who took part in the [[Greek War of Independence]].  Nearly two months before the start of the war, in January 1821, he took part in the [[Aigio|Vostitsa]] council. In March 1821, he took part in the Ayia Lavra council and supported the idea of immediate action against the Turks. He was vice-president of the [[Peloponnesian Senate]] and president of the parliament in 1822.  He took part in the [[Georgios Kountouriotis]] government in 1824 from which he resigned quickly and became a political opponent of Kountouriotis. He was prosecuted by Kountouriotis and his house was plundered.  Later, when King [[Otto of Greece|Otto]] came to power he was re-instated and became a general.

[[File:"Crater with red figures" (350-340 BC) "Cassandra and Ajax" .jpg|thumb|"Cassandra and Ajax", Greek Krater, 350-340 BC ]]
'''Cassandra''' or '''Kassandra''' ([[Ancient Greek]]: Κασσάνδρα, {{IPA-el|kas̚sándra|pron}}, also {{lang|grc|Κασάνδρα}}), also known as '''Alexandra''', was [[List of children of Priam|a daughter]] of King [[Priam]] and of Queen [[Hecuba]] of [[Troy]] in [[Greek mythology]].

Cassandra was cursed to utter [[prophecy|prophecies]] that were true but that no one believed. The older and most common versions state that she was admired by the god [[Apollo]], and he offered her the gift to see the future in order to win her heart. Cassandra agreed to be his lover in return to his gift, but after receiving the gift, she went back on her word and refused him. Apollo was angered that she lied to and deceived him, but since he couldn't take back a gift already given, he cursed her that though she would see the future accurately, nobody would ever believe her prophecies. 

Some of the later versions have her falling asleep in a temple, where snakes licked (or whispered in) her ears so that she could hear the future.{{Efn|A snake as a source of knowledge is a recurring theme in Greek mythology, though sometimes the snake brings understanding of the language of animals rather than an ability to know the future. Likewise, prophets without honor in their own country reflect a standard narrative trope.}}

Cassandra became a figure of [[Epic Cycle|epic tradition]] and of [[Greek tragedy|tragedy]].

In modern usage her name is employed as a rhetorical device to indicate someone whose accurate prophecies are not believed by those around them.

==Etymology==
[[Hjalmar Frisk]] (''Griechisches Etymologisches Wörterbuch'', Heidelberg, 1960–1970) notes "unexplained etymology", citing "various hypotheses" found in Wilhelm Schulze,&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Schulze, ''Kleine Schriften'' (1966), 698, J. B. Hoffmann, ''Glotta'' '''28''', 52&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edgar Howard Sturtevant]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Edgar Howard Sturtevant]], ''Class. Phil.'' '''21''', 248ff.&lt;/ref&gt; J. Davreux,&lt;ref&gt;J.

Beekes]], ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;654&lt;/ref&gt; cites García Ramón's derivation of the name from the [[Proto-Indo-European]] root *''(s)kend-'' "raise".

== Mythology ==

=== Biography ===
[[File:Woodcut illustration of Cassandra's prophecy of the fall of Troy (at left) and her death (at right) - Penn Provenance Project.jpg|thumb|Woodcut illustration of Cassandra's prophecy of the fall of Troy (at left) and her death (at right), from an [[Incunable]] German translation by [[Heinrich Steinhöwel]] of [[Giovanni Boccaccio]]'s ''[[De mulieribus claris]]'', printed by {{Interlanguage link multi|Johann Zainer|de}} at Ulm ca. 1474.]]

Cassandra was a princess of Troy, the daughter of King Priam and Queen Hecuba and the [[twin#Dizygotic (fraternal) twins|fraternal twin]] sister of [[Helenus]]. According to legend, Cassandra had dark brown curly hair and dark brown eyes, and was both beautiful and clever, but considered insane.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schein|first=Seth L.|date=1982|title=The Cassandra Scene in Aeschylus' Agamemnon|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/greece-and-rome/article/cassandra-scene-in-aeschylus-agamemnon/072B57ED4FB035B6191BA6242B97597B|journal=Greece &amp; Rome|volume=29|issue=1|pages=11–16|doi=10.1017/S0017383500028278|issn=1477-4550|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gift of prophecy ===
Cassandra was given the gift of prophecy, but was also cursed by the god Apollo so that her accurate prophecies would not be believed. Many versions of the myth relate that she incurred the god's wrath by refusing him sex, after promising herself to him in exchange for the power of prophecy. In Aeschylus' ''Agamemnon'', she bemoans her relationship with Apollo:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Apollo, Apollo!
God of all ways, but only Death's to me,
Once and again, O thou, Destroyer named,
Thou hast destroyed me, thou, my love of old!&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And she acknowledges her fault
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;"... I consented to Loxias (Apollo) but broke my word... Ever since that fault I could persuade no one of anything."&lt;ref name="AESCHYLUS, AGAMEMNON 2"&gt;{{cite web | title=Aeschylus, Agamemmon 2 | publisher=The Theoi Project | url=http://www.theoi.com/Text/AeschylusAgamemnon2.html | accessdate=March 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Hyginus]] in [[Fabulae]] says:&lt;ref name="Cassandra at Stanford"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.stanford.edu/~plomio/cassandra.html | title=Cassandra | work=Mortal Women of the Trojan War | publisher=Stanford University | accessdate=March 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|Cassandra, daughter of the king and queen, in the temple of Apollo, exhausted from practising, is said to have fallen asleep; whom, when Apollo wished to embrace her, she did not afford the opportunity of her body. On account of which thing, when she prophesied true things, she was not believed.}}

In some versions of the myth, Apollo curses her by spitting into her mouth.

Cassandra had served as a priestess of Apollo and taken a sacred vow of chastity to remain a virgin for her entire life.&lt;ref name="The Trojan women of Euripides"&gt;{{cite web | title= The Trojan women of Euripides | url=https://archive.org/stream/thetrojanwomenof10096gut/10096.txt | accessdate=March 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ajax drags Cassandra from Palladium.jpg|thumb|[[Ajax the Lesser]] in Troy drags Cassandra from [[Palladium (classical antiquity)|Palladium]] before eyes of [[Priam]], Roman mural from the [[Casa del Menandro]], [[Pompeii]]]]

Her cursed gift from Apollo became a source of endless pain and frustration to Cassandra. She was seen as a liar and a madwoman by her family and by the Trojan people. In some versions of the story, she was often locked up in a pyramidal building on the citadel on the orders of her father, King Priam.  She was accompanied there by the wardress, who cared for her under orders to inform the King of all of his daughter's "prophetic utterances".&lt;ref name="illinois1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/a_f/bogan/classical.htm |title=Cassandra in the Classical World |publisher=English.illinois.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to legend, Cassandra had instructed her twin brother Helenus in the power of prophecy so he could be a prophet.  Like her, Helenus was always correct whenever he had made his predictions, but unlike his sister, people believed him.

Cassandra made many predictions, and all of her prophecies were disbelieved except for one, when she foresaw who [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] was and proclaimed that he was her abandoned brother.&lt;ref name="maicar1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maicar.com/GML/Cassandra.html |title=Cassandra – Greek Mythology Link |publisher=Maicar.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cassandra foresaw that Paris’ abduction of Helen for his wife would bring about the Trojan War and warned Paris not to go to Sparta. Helenus echoed her prophecy, but his warnings were ignored.&lt;ref name="maicar1"/&gt; Cassandra saw Helen coming into Troy when Paris returned home from Sparta. Cassandra furiously snatched away Helen's golden veil and tore at her hair, for she had foreseen that Helen's arrival would bring the calamities of the Trojan War and the destruction of Troy. The Trojan people, however, welcomed Helen into their city.&lt;ref name="maicar1"/&gt;

=== Fall of Troy and aftermath ===
[[File:Aias und Kassandra (Tischbein).jpg|thumb|left|''Ajax and Cassandra'' by [[Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Tischbein]], 1806]]
Cassandra foresaw the destruction of Troy.  In various accounts of the war, she warned the Trojans about the Greeks hiding inside the Trojan Horse, [[Agamemnon]]'s death, her own demise at the hands of [[Aegisthus]] and [[Clytemnestra]], her mother Hecuba's fate, [[Odysseus]]'s ten-year wanderings before returning to his home, and the murder of Aegisthus and Clytemnestra by the latter's children [[Electra]] and [[Orestes]]. Cassandra predicted that her cousin [[Aeneas]] would escape during the fall of Troy and found a new nation in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Virgil/aeneid.html |title=The Internet Classics Archive &amp;#124; The Aeneid by Virgil |publisher=Classics.mit.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, she was unable to do anything to forestall these tragedies since no one believed her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/thetrojanwomenof10096gut/10096.txt |title=Full text of "The Trojan women of Euripides" |publisher=Archive.org |date=2003-11-16 |accessdate=2014-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Coroebus]] and [[Othronus]] came to the aid of Troy during the Trojan War out of love for Cassandra and in exchange for her hand in marriage, but both were killed.&lt;ref name="illinois1"/&gt; According to one account, Priam offered Cassandra to [[Telephus]]’s son [[Eurypylus (son of Telephus)|Eurypylus]], in order to induce Eurypylus to fight on the side of the Trojans.&lt;ref&gt; [[Dictys Cretensis]] 4.14 (Frazer, p. 95).&lt;/ref&gt; Cassandra was also the first to see the body of her brother [[Hector]] being brought back to the city.

In ''The Fall of Troy'', told by [[Quintus Smyrnaeus]], Cassandra had attempted to warn the Trojan people that Greek warriors were hiding in the Trojan Horse while they were celebrating their victory over the Greeks with feasting. They disbelieved her, calling her names and degrading her with insults.&lt;ref name="theoi1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Text/QuintusSmyrnaeus12.html |title=Classical E-Text: Quintus Smyrnaeus, Fall of Troy 12 |publisher=Theoi.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; She grabbed an axe in one hand and a burning torch in her other, and ran towards the Trojan Horse, intent on destroying it herself to stop the Greeks from destroying Troy. The Trojan people stopped her before she could do so. The Greeks hiding inside the Horse were relieved that the Trojans had stopped Cassandra from destroying it, but they were surprised by how clearly she had seen their plan to defeat Troy.&lt;ref name="theoi1"/&gt;

At the fall of Troy, Cassandra sought shelter in the temple of [[Athena]]. There she embraced the wooden statue of Athena in supplication for her protection, but was abducted and brutally raped by [[Ajax the Lesser]]. Cassandra was clinging so tightly to the statue of the goddess that Ajax knocked it from its stand as he dragged her away.&lt;ref name="maicar1"/&gt; One account claimed that even Athena, who had worked hard to help the Greeks destroy Troy, was not able to restrain her tears and her cheeks burned with anger.  In one account, this caused her image to give forth a sound that shook the floor of the temple at the sight of Cassandra's rape, and her image turned its eyes away as Cassandra was violated, although others found this account too bold.&lt;ref name="maicar1"/&gt; Ajax's actions were a sacrilege because Cassandra was a supplicant of Athena and supplicants were untouchable in the sanctuary of a god, being under the protection of that god. Furthermore, he committed another sacrilege by raping her inside the temple of Athena, despite it being strictly forbidden for people to have sexual intercourse in a temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rwaag.org/cassandra |title=Cassandra, Ancient Princess of Troy, Priestess and Prophetess|website=The Role of Women in the Art of Ancient Greece (Rwaag)|date=  |author= |accessdate= 3 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Odysseus insisted to the other Greek leaders that Ajax should be stoned to death for his crimes, which had enraged Athena and the other gods. Ajax avoided their wrath, because none of them dared to punish him after he clung, as a supplicant, to Athena's altar and swore an oath proclaiming his innocence.&lt;ref name="maicar1"/&gt; Athena was furious at the Greeks' failure to punish Ajax for raping Cassandra in her temple, and she punished them severely with the help of [[Poseidon]] and [[Zeus]]. Poseidon sent storms and strong winds to destroy much of the Greek fleet on their way home from Troy. Athena punished Ajax herself, by causing him to have a terrible death, although the sources differ as to [[Ajax the Lesser#Death|the manner of his death]]. The [[Locrians]] had to atone for Ajax's great sacrilege against Cassandra in Athena's temple by sending two maidens to Troy every year for a thousand years to serve as slaves in Athena's temple. However, if they were caught by the inhabitants before they reached the temple they were executed.&lt;ref name="illinois1"/&gt;

In some versions, Cassandra intentionally left a chest behind in Troy, with a curse on whichever Greek opened it first.&lt;ref name="maicar1"/&gt; Inside the chest was an image of [[Dionysus]], made by [[Hephaestus]] and presented to the Trojans by Zeus. It was given to the Greek leader [[Eurypylus (king of Thessaly)|Eurypylus]] as a part of his share of the victory spoils of Troy. When he opened the chest and saw the image of the god, he went mad.&lt;ref name="maicar1"/&gt;

=== Captivity and death ===
Cassandra was then taken as a [[concubine]] by King Agamemnon of [[Mycenae]]. Unbeknown to Agamemnon, while he was away at war, his wife, Clytemnestra, had begun an affair with Aegisthus. &lt;!--Upon Agamemnon and Cassandra's arrival in Mycenae, [[Clytemnestra]] asked her husband to walk across a [[purple]] (some versions say red) tapestry, a sign of [[hubris]].  He initially refused, fearing the wrath of the gods, but gave in, ignoring Cassandra's warnings. By walking on the tapestries, he was committing sacrilege.--&gt;  Clytemnestra and Aegisthus then murdered both Agamemnon and Cassandra. Some sources mention that Cassandra and Agamemnon had twin boys, Teledamus and Pelops, both of whom were killed by Aegisthus.

Cassandra was sent to the [[Elysium|Elysian Fields]] after her death, because her soul was judged worthy due to her dedication to the gods, and her religious nature during her life.&lt;ref name="Westmoreland"&gt;{{cite book|title=Ancient Greek Beliefs|last=Westmoreland|first=Perry L.|publisher=Lee &amp; Vance Publishing Company|year=2007|isbn=9780979324819|location=San Ysidro, CA|pages=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cassandra was buried either at Amyclae or Mycenae. The two towns disputed the possession of her grave.&lt;ref name="illinois1"/&gt; [[Heinrich Schliemann]] was certain that he had discovered Cassandra’s tomb when he had excavated Mycenae, because he found the remains of a woman and two infants in one of the circle graves at Mycenae.&lt;ref name="illinois1"/&gt;

The play ''[[Oresteia#Agamemnon|Agamemnon]]'' from Aeschylus's trilogy ''[[Oresteia]]'' depicts the king treading the scarlet cloth laid down for him, and walking offstage to his death.&lt;ref name="Agamemnon"/&gt;{{rp|ln. 972}} After the chorus's ode of foreboding, time is suspended in Cassandra's "[[mad scene]]".&lt;ref name="The Cassandra Scene in Aeschylus' 'Agamemnon'"&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Seth L. |last=Schein |title=The Cassandra Scene in Aeschylus' 'Agamemnon' |journal=Greece &amp; Rome |series=Second Series |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=11 |year=1982  |doi=10.1017/S0017383500028278}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p. 11–16}} She has been onstage, silent and ignored. Her madness that is unleashed now is not the physical torment of other characters in [[Greek tragedy]], such as in [[Euripides]]' ''Heracles'' or [[Sophocles]]' ''Ajax''.

According to author Seth Schein, two further familiar descriptions of her madness are that of Heracles in ''[[The Women of Trachis]]'' or [[Io (mythology)|Io]] in ''Prometheus Bound''.&lt;ref name="The Cassandra Scene in Aeschylus' 'Agamemnon'"/&gt;{{rp|p. 11}} She speaks, disconnectedly and transcendent, in the grip of her psychic possession by Apollo,&lt;ref name="Agamemnon"&gt;{{cite book | title=Agamemnon | type=play script | language=Greek | quote=The chorus find her to be "crazed in mind and transported by a god"}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|ln. 1140}} witnessing past and future events. Schein says, "She evokes the same awe, horror and pity as do [[schizophrenics]]".&lt;ref name="The Cassandra Scene in Aeschylus' 'Agamemnon'"/&gt;{{rp|p. 12}} Cassandra is someone "who often combine deep, true insight with utter helplessness, and who retreat into madness."

The frightened and respectful chorus are unable to comprehend her. She goes to her inevitable offstage murder by [[Clytemnestra]] with full knowledge of what is to befall her.&lt;ref&gt;Analyses of the Cassandra scene are in [[Bernard Knox]] ''Word and Action: Essays on the Ancient theatre'' (Baltimore and London: Penguin) 1979&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|pp. 42–55}}{{full citation needed|date=March 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;Anne Lebeck, ''The Oresteia: A study in language and structure'' (Washington) 1971&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|pp. 52–58}}

== Modern adaptations ==
Cassandra is an enduring archetype.  Modern invocations of Cassandra are most frequently an example of a [[Cassandra complex]].  To emphasize such a situation, Cassandra's name is frequently used in fiction when prophecy comes up, especially true prophecy that is not believed.  This can include the names of people, objects, or places.

Cassandra has been used as metaphor and allegory in psychological and philosophical tracts.  For example, [[Florence Nightingale]]'s book ''Suggestions for Thought to Searchers after Religious Truth'' has a section named for Cassandra, using her as a [[metaphor]] for the helplessness of women that she attributes to over-feminization.  (Further examples are located on the [[Cassandra (metaphor)|Cassandra complex]] page.)

The Cassandra myth itself has also been retold several times by modern authors of novels and dramatizations, including works by [[Eric Shanower]], [[Lindsay Clarke]], [[Christa Wolf]], [[Lesya Ukrainka]], [[Woody Allen]], [[Marion Zimmer Bradley]], [[David Gemmell]], and [[Hector Berlioz]].  A number of songs have also referred to her, such as "[[Cassandra (ABBA song)|Cassandra]]" (1982), by Swedish pop band [[ABBA]].
&lt;!---Please don't add specific examples here, it's unwieldy, it's not encyclopedic, and it adds nothing to the page.  Especially don't add instances where her name or a similar character appear – those are an instance of a Cassandra Complex, and at best belong on that page---&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5527">'''Cathy Massiter''' is a British [[whistleblower]] and former member of [[MI5]] who revealed that the  British security service carried out surveillance of British trade unions, civil rights organisations and the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]]. She sustained her revelations via a [[affidavit]].&lt;ref name="McSmith"&gt;Andy McSmith [https://books.google.com/books?id=qXlHAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT63  ''No Such Thing As Society''], Constable &amp; Robinson, 2010, p.63-64&lt;/ref&gt;

From the late 1960s until the mid-1970s, the MI5 designated the CND, an anti-nuclear weapons organisation, as [[subversive]] by virtue of its being "communist controlled". Communists had played an active role in the organisation, and John Cox, its chairman from 1971 to 1977, was a member of the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]].&lt;ref name=dmail&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1229940/Cathy-Ashton-EUs-new-Foreign-Minister-Treasurer-CND.html |title=EU's new 'Foreign Minister' Cathy Ashton was Treasurer of CND |publisher=Daily Mail |date=2009-11-22 |accessdate=2011-01-09 |location=London |first1=Ian |last1=Gallagher |first2=Daniel |last2=Boffey |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110219191440/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1229940/Cathy-Ashton-EUs-new-Foreign-Minister-Treasurer-CND.html# |archive-date=2011-02-19 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  From the late 1970s, MI5 downgraded CND to "communist-penetrated".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mi5.gov.uk/output/myths-and-misunderstandings.html#8 |title=Myths and Misunderstandings |publisher=Mi5.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110106160005/https://www.mi5.gov.uk/output/myths-and-misunderstandings.html |archivedate=2011-01-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, Massiter, who as an MI5 officer had been responsible for the surveillance of CND from 1981 to 1983, resigned and made disclosures to  a [[Channel 4]] ''20/20 Vision'' programme, "MI5's Official Secrets".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/true_spies/2336987.stm |title=Secret State: Timeline |publisher=BBC News |date=2002-10-17 |accessdate=2011-01-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050922210020/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/true_spies/2336987.stm# |archive-date=2005-09-22 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hansard&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1986/jul/24/business-of-the-house-1 |title=Dale Campbell-Savours, MP, in '&amp;#39;Hansard'&amp;#39;, 24 July 1986 |publisher=Hansard.millbanksystems.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110921055251/http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1986/jul/24/business-of-the-house-1# |archive-date=2011-09-21 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She said that her work was determined more by the political importance of CND than by any security threat posed by subversive elements within it, and argued that the organisation was contravening the rules governing its practices.&lt;ref&gt;James Rusbridger [https://books.google.com/books?id=p62LN9EhsKYC&amp;pg=PA208 ''The Intelligence Game: The Illusions and Delusions of International Espionage''], London: I.B. Taurus, 1991, p.208. Originally published by The Bodley Head in 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, she analysed telephone intercepts on John Cox that gave her access to conversations with [[Joan Ruddock]] and [[Bruce Kent]]. MI5 also placed a spy, Harry Newton, in the CND office. According to Massiter, Newton believed that CND was controlled by extreme left-wing activists and that Bruce Kent might be a crypto-communist, but Massiter found no evidence to support either opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Bateman, D., ''[http://www.lobster-magazine.co.uk/issue28.php  The Trouble With Harry: A memoire of Harry Newton, MI5 agent] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729042021/http://www.lobster-magazine.co.uk/issue28.php# |date=2013-07-29 }}'', '''Lobster''', Issue 28, December 1994. Accessed 3 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; CND activist [[Pat Arrowsmith]], who had known Newton for twenty-five years, disputed the veracity of Massiter's allegations against him.&lt;ref name="McSmith"/&gt; On the basis of Ruddock's contacts, she had given an interview to a Soviet newspaper in 1981, MI5 suspected her of being a communist sympathiser.

Massiter also revealed the surveillance of [[Harriet Harman]] and [[Patricia Hewitt]], who had respectively held the posts of the legal officer and general secretary of the [[Liberty (pressure group)|National Council for Civil Liberties]].&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Andrew [https://books.google.com/books?id=njWH7cW3aLAC&amp;pg=PT1305&amp;lpg=PT1305 ''The Defence of the Realm: The Authorized History of MI5'', London: Penguin, 2012, p.1305]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Norton-Taylor]] wrote in 2001 that Massiter's revelations in 1985 had never been officially challenged by the government,&lt;ref&gt;Richard Norton-Taylor [https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/sep/11/media.freedomofinformation "Truth, but not the whole truth"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170311164102/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/sep/11/media.freedomofinformation# |date=2017-03-11 }}, ''The Guardian'', 11 September 2001&lt;/ref&gt; although British governments have a tradition of not commenting "on matters of national security and intelligence."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6650">'''Conrad Bussow''' (1552 or 1553, [[Sehnde|Ilten]], [[Hanover]]&lt;ref name=OR29/&gt; &amp;ndash; 1617) was a German [[mercenary]] from [[Lower Saxony]] who lived in [[Riga]] in 1590s and in [[Muscovy]] in 1600–1611. In 1614–1617 Bussow compiled ''[[The Disturbed State of the Russian Realm]]'', an eye-witness history of the [[Time of Troubles]]. An early manuscript of his book was [[Plagiarism|plagiarized]] by [[Peter Petreius]] in his ''[[History of the Grand Duchy of Muscovy]]''.

==Biography==

Conrad Bussow was born in the township of Ilten (part of present-day [[Sehnde]] near [[Hanover]]), in a family of a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] pastor; his writing as a mature man suggests that he received a decent education at home, especially in Latin language and literature.&lt;ref name=OR29&gt;Orchard, p. xxix&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the military at the age of sixteen or seventeen. Details of his early service are unknown, but he eventually appeared in the troops of [[Stephen Báthory of Poland]], engaged in the [[Livonian War]]. When Russia was forced out of this conflict, the Polish-Swedish coalition fell apart; Bussow changed sides and joined the Swedish service. In 1590s he lived in [[Riga]]; little is known of his family life except that two of his sons born in this period reached mature age and were alive in 1610s. His exact position in Swedish forces remains unclear; Bussow names himself ''Inspector and Intendant of the lands conquered in Livonia'' by [[Charles IX of Sweden|Duke Karl of Södermanland]].&lt;ref name=OR30&gt;Orchard, p. xxx&lt;/ref&gt;

Swedish hold of Livonia eroded in late 1590s, the Poles were preparing to take it over and in 1599 Bussow changed sides again, deserting the weakened Swedish force for Muscovy. According to the version of Bussow' [[wikt:nemesis|nemesis]], Swedish envoy [[Peter Petreius]], in 1599 agents of [[Boris Godunov (opera)|Boris Godunov]] recruited Bussow in [[Narva]]; Bussow agreed to hand the city over to Russians and secure neutrality of the German troops in his command. The plot was discovered and Bussow fled to Muscovy.&lt;ref name=OR30/&gt;

Bussow's treason was rewarded with lands in Russia and a small, unimportant military command. His subsequent service to Godunov, [[False Dmitriy I]] and [[Vasily Shuysky]] was unremarkable; Bussow stayed away from the political conflicts. In 1606 he somehow dissatisfied tsar Vasily Shuysky who relieved Bussow of his command and ordered him to retire in his [[Kaluga]] estate. There, he was caught in the middle of [[Ivan Bolotnikov]]'s revolt. Bussow's son, also Conrad Bussow, joined the revolt; he was later caught, sentenced to exile in Siberia but returned safely after the fall of Shuysky. Bussow (senior) followed Bolotnikov's troops but did not engage in any decisive combat. Later, he would likewise follow the camps of [[Jan Piotr Sapieha]] and [[False Dmitry II]]. In 1611 Bussow realized that the Poles ultimately lost their war in Muscovy; he retired to Polish-occupied Riga and settled on writing a book of memoirs on the Time of Troubles. Perhaps he was motivated by the financial success of a book published by [[Jacques Margeret]], a fellow mercenary in Muscovite service.&lt;ref name=OR31&gt;Orchard, p. xxxi&lt;/ref&gt;

Bussow prepared two versions of his book. The first, compiled with the help of his son-in-law Martin Beer, was sent in 1613 to [[Frederick Ulrich, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg]], master of the Wolfenbüttel Library. The Duke did not reply, either due to his internal problems, or due to Bussow's strained reputation as a deserter. This book never found its way to a printing press. [[Peter Petreius]], the man who made Bussow's desertion a common knowledge among European courts, obtained a copy of the manuscript and reused or plagiarized its content in his own book issued in Swedish in 1615 and in German in 1620. The second manuscript, written by Bussow alone, was ready for publication in 1617. Bussow made a deal with a printer in [[Lübeck]] shortly before his death and the publication was cancelled. Petreius could now proceed with his plagiarism without remorse.&lt;ref name=OR33&gt;Orchard, p. xxxiii&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical assessment==

Although the manuscripts were not printed in the 17th century, their placement in the [[Wolfenbüttel Library]] made them accessible to scholars. In 1690s [[Christian Kelch]] used both Bussow and Petreius as ''independent'' sources. In the first half of 19th century the relationship between Martin Beer, Conrad Bussow and Peter Petreius was not clearly understood; German and Russian scholars (notably [[Friedrich von Adelung]], [[Nikolay Karamzin]], [[Nikolai Rumyantsev]]) considered Beer, not Bussow, to be the primary author. Bussow was restored in his own right in 1849 by [[Arist Kunik]] and in 1858 by [[Sergey Solovyov]].&lt;ref name=OR35&gt;Orchard, pp. xxxv-xxxvi&lt;/ref&gt;

Bussow's German text now exists in different manuscript copies, of which ''Wolfenbüttel II'' is probably the most authentic; the complete English translation (printed 1994) was based on 1961 ''Smirnov edition'' with cross-checking against the manuscripts.&lt;ref name=OR37&gt;Orchard, pp. xxxvii&lt;/ref&gt;

Bussow as an author is remarkable in two aspects. On the upside, he "seems to have had all the instincts of an investigative reporter. He always seemed to be where the action was."&lt;ref name=OR31/&gt; He personally knew the driving leaders of most of warring factions and was personally present at the crucial events of the war. Knowing spoken Russian well, Bussow could retell his Russian sources directly, without resorting to interpreters.&lt;ref name=OR31/&gt;

At the same time, "it is amazing that someone could live for ten years in a country without acquiring the slightest insight into, or empathy to, the local culture."&lt;ref name=OR32&gt;Orchard, p. xxxii&lt;/ref&gt; Bussow was as ignorant in matters of [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]] and popular culture as he was competent in military tactics. However, the numbers provided in his generally credible descriptions of military actions are regarded as exaggerated.&lt;ref name=OR32/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19823">'''Eliza Jane Scovill''' (December 3, 2001 {{ndash}} May 16, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/Health/story?id=1386737&amp;page=1&amp;singlePage=true |title=Did HIV-Positive Mom's Beliefs Put Her Children at Risk? |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=8 December 2005 |website=abcnews.go.com |publisher=[[ABC Primetime Live]] |accessdate=21 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the daughter of [[AIDS denialist]] [[Christine Maggiore]], an [[HIV-positive]] activist who publicly questioned the link between HIV and [[AIDS]], and supported HIV-positive pregnant women who want to avoid taking anti-HIV medication. Eliza Jane's May 16, 2005 death from AIDS at the age of three and a half sparked a social and legal controversy over her mother's decision not to take precautions during pregnancy and breastfeeding to prevent transmission of the virus, and her parents' decision to not have her treated for HIV infection during her life.

==AIDS diagnosis and death==
{{Main|Christine Maggiore}}

In 1992, Eliza Jane's mother, Christine Maggiore, [[HIV test|tested positive for HIV]].&lt;ref name=Newsweek&gt;{{cite news | title = The HIV Disbeliever | first = David | last = France | publisher = ''[[Newsweek]]'' | date = 2000-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; She subsequently became involved in volunteer work for a number of AIDS charities, including AIDS Project Los Angeles, L.A. Shanti, and Women at Risk. However, following an interaction with prominent [[AIDS denialist]] [[Peter Duesberg]] in 1994, she began to question whether HIV causes AIDS. Maggiore came to believe that her positive test may have been due to [[flu shot]]s, [[pregnancy]], or a common viral infection.&lt;ref name="LATimesArticle"/&gt;

Maggiore chose not to take [[antiretroviral]] drugs or other measures which reduce the risk of [[vertical transmission|mother-to-child transmission]] of HIV during her pregnancies.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/international/story/0,,1578142,00.html | title = Mother who denied Aids link faces police investigation after death of daughter | first = Julian | last = Borger | publisher = ''[[The Guardian]]'' | date = 2005-09-26 | accessdate = 2007-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Given the known and unknown risks of antiretroviral use in pregnancy, [[National Institutes of Health]] guidelines state that the final decision regarding their use "should be made by the woman after discussion with her health care provider about the known and unknown benefits and risks of therapy" in a "noncoercive" environment; see {{cite web | url = http://aidsinfo.nih.gov/ContentFiles/PerinatalGL.pdf | publisher = [[National Institutes of Health]] | title =  Recommendations on HIV therapy during pregnancy | accessdate = 2006-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maggiore also [[breast-feeding|breast-fed]] her children, despite evidence that breast-feeding can also transmit HIV from mother to child. Her younger child, Eliza Jane, was never tested for HIV, nor did she or her older brother Charlie receive any of the recommended childhood vaccines. (Maggiore later reported Charlie to have tested HIV-negative three times.)&lt;ref name="LATimesArticle"/&gt; Maggiore discussed her beliefs as an AIDS dissident on [[Air America Radio]] in March 2005, stating that "...our children have excellent records of health. They've never had respiratory problems, flus, intractable colds, ear infections, nothing. So, our choices, however radical they may seem, are extremely well-founded."&lt;ref name="LATimesArticle"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://articles.latimes.com/2005/sep/24/local/me-eliza24 |title =  A Mother's Denial, a Daughter's Death | publisher = ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' | date = 2005-09-24 | accessdate = 2008-12-29 | last = Ornstein | first = Charles |author2=Daniel Costello}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several weeks after this interview, in April 2005, Eliza Jane became ill with a runny nose. She was seen by a physician from the family's pediatric practice, who documented a normal physical exam. Several days later, Maggiore took Eliza Jane to see another [[pediatrician]], [[Jay Gordon (physician)|Jay Gordon]], who felt she had a mild ear infection.&lt;ref name="LATimesArticle"/&gt; Reportedly, Gordon was aware of Maggiore's HIV status,&lt;ref name="LATimesArticle"/&gt; but did not have Eliza Jane tested for HIV. According to the hospital report, filed just after Eliza Jane's death and based upon an interview with Maggiore, Eliza Jane "had been diagnosed with pneumonia" in the weeks preceding her death.&lt;ref name="autopsy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aidstruth.org/ejs-coroner-report.pdf |title=Autopsy Report on Eliza Jane Scovill |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928112905/http://www.aidstruth.org/ejs-coroner-report.pdf |archivedate=2007-09-28 |df= }}&amp;nbsp;(2.29&amp;nbsp;[[Mebibyte|MiB]])&lt;/ref&gt;

When Eliza Jane failed to improve, Maggiore took her to see Philip Incao, a [[holistic]] practitioner and board member of Maggiore's AIDS-denialist organization [[Alive &amp; Well AIDS Alternatives]]. Incao stated that Eliza Jane appeared "mildly ill... no way I considered her in danger... she did not act as a patient acts if she's severely ill or in danger."&lt;ref name="primetime"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/print?id=1386737 | title = Did HIV-Positive Mom's Beliefs Put Her Children at Risk? | publisher = [[ABC Primetime Live]] | date = 2005-12-08 | accessdate = 2008-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 14, 2005, Incao prescribed [[amoxicillin]] for a presumed [[otitis media|ear infection]].

The following day, Eliza Jane became lethargic and vomited several times. While Maggiore was on the phone with Incao, Eliza Jane collapsed and stopped breathing.&lt;ref name="LATimesArticle"/&gt; She was rushed by ambulance to Valley Presbyterian Hospital in [[Van Nuys, California]]. Physicians attempted to resuscitate Eliza Jane, but were unsuccessful. According to the hospital report, a "chest x-ray revealed pneumonia," and Eliza Jane was pronounced dead at 5:40 AM on May 16, 2005.&lt;ref name="autopsy"/&gt;

===Cause of death===
An [[autopsy]] was performed. The senior deputy medical examiner for the [[Los Angeles County]] [[coroner| Coroner's Office]] &lt;ref name="primetime"/&gt; found that Eliza Jane was markedly [[failure to thrive|underweight and underheight]], consistent with a chronic illness, and that she had pronounced [[atrophy]] of her [[thymus]] and other lymphatic organs. Examination of her lungs showed infection with ''[[Pneumocystis jirovecii]]'',&lt;ref name="primetime"/&gt; a common [[opportunistic infection|opportunistic pathogen]] in people with AIDS and the leading cause of pediatric AIDS deaths.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebody.com/content/treat/art6573.html HIV Infection in Infants and Children; thebody.com; July 2004] Accessed 20 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The post-mortem examination of Eliza Jane's [[brain]] showed changes consistent with HIV [[encephalitis]];&lt;ref name="primetime"/&gt; [[P24 capsid protein|protein components of HIV itself]] were identified in Eliza Jane's brain tissue via [[immunohistochemistry]].&lt;ref name="autopsy"/&gt;

Based on the clinical information, the immunohistochemical documentation of HIV in Eliza Jane's brain, the evidence of pronounced immunosuppression, and the isolation of the opportunistic [[pathogen]] ''Pneumocystis jirovecii'' from Eliza Jane's lungs, the coroner concluded that Eliza Jane had died of [[Pneumocystis pneumonia]] in the setting of advanced AIDS.&lt;ref name="autopsy"/&gt; This conclusion was described by the coroner as "unequivocal".&lt;ref name="primetime"/&gt;

Maggiore rejected the coroner's conclusion, ascribing it to political bias and attacking the personal credibility of the senior coroner, James Ribe.&lt;ref name="justiceforej"&gt;[http://www.justiceforej.com/ Justice For E.J.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051206022514/http://www.justiceforej.com/ |date=2005-12-06 }}, website maintained by David Crowe of the Alberta Reappraising AIDS Society, accessed 5 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Maggiore retained a board member of the organization she founded named [[Alive &amp; Well AIDS Alternatives]], toxicologist Mohammed Al-Bayati, to review the autopsy report. Al-Bayati holds a [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] in veterinary medicine from the [[University of Baghdad]], an [[Master of Science|M.S.]] from the [[University of Cairo]], and a [[Ph.D.]] in comparative pathology from [[UC Davis]]. Among other subjects he studied human pathology for his doctorate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mohammed Ali Al-Bayati|url=http://www.medicalveritas.com/Albayati.pdf|accessdate=3 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been described as a pseudoscientist.&lt;ref&gt;Seth C. Kalichman, ''Denying AIDS: Conspiracy Theories, Pseudoscience, and Human Tragedy'', p. 181, Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 2009.[https://books.google.com/books?id=_mtDBCDwxugC&amp;pg=PA181]&lt;/ref&gt; He is not a [[physician]] nor is he board-certified in human pathology.&lt;ref&gt;Nicoli Nattrass, ''The AIDS Conspiracy: Science Fights Back'', p. 121, Columbia University Press, 2013.[https://books.google.com/books?id=almsAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA121]&lt;/ref&gt;  He is the author of a book entitled ''Get All The Facts: HIV Does Not Cause AIDS''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | publisher = ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' | last = Costello | first = Daniel |author2=Charles Ornstein | title = HIV Skeptic Takes Her Case to TV Audience | url = http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-christine-maggiore9-2005dec09,0,6599725.story | date = 2005-12-09 | accessdate = 2008-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Bayati released a report concluding that Eliza Jane had not died from AIDS or pneumocystis pneumonia, but from an [[allergic reaction]] to [[amoxicillin]].&lt;ref name="abreport"&gt;[http://www.justiceforej.com/Al-BayatiReport.pdf Mohammed Al-Bayati's review of Eliza Jane Scovill's autopsy]{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, accessed 5 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Maggiore embraced Al-Bayati's conclusion that a reaction to amoxicillin was responsible, stating, "I believe the unfortunate irony in this situation is that the one time that we were asked to and that we complied with mainstream medicine, we inadvertently gave our daughter something that took her life."&lt;ref name="primetime"/&gt;

Al-Bayati's report has been dismissed as both biased and medically unsound.&lt;ref name="gdotcom"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070301110720/http://www.gay.com/health/safetyzone/article.html?coll=health_fitness&amp;sernum=3265&amp;page=1 Christine Maggiore: AIDS naysayer], accessed 5 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bennett"&gt;[http://www.physics.smu.edu/pseudo/AIDS/A_report_on_Eliza_Ver2.pdf Rebuttal to Dr. Mohammed Al-Bayati's report, by Nicholas Bennett], accessed 5 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicoli Nattrass, ''The AIDS Conspiracy: Science Fights Back'', p. 122, Columbia University Press, 2013.[https://books.google.com/books?id=almsAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA121]&lt;/ref&gt; Both the [[L.A. Times]] and [[Primetime (U.S. TV program)|ABC PrimeTime Live]] consulted independent experts in pathology about Eliza Jane's case; these experts agreed unequivocally with the coroner's conclusion that AIDS and resultant Pneumocystis pneumonia were the cause of death, and rejected Al-Bayati's report.&lt;ref name="LATimesArticle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="primetime"/&gt;

==Criticism and controversy==
Following Eliza Jane Scovill's death, Maggiore's beliefs and advocacy became points of controversy. Maggiore had held fast to her belief that HIV does not cause AIDS, and that Eliza Jane died of a reaction to amoxicillin.&lt;ref name="LATimesArticle"/&gt; She submitted a letter to the ''[[LA Times]]'' alleging factual errors and omissions in their articles on Eliza Jane; the Times did not print the letter, stating that "If facts in an article are wrong, a correction would be published. However, no correction is warranted in this case."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justiceforej.com/LATimes.html Maggiore's view of the L.A. Times article]{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, accessed 5 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others point to the evidence which indicates that Eliza Jane acquired AIDS from Maggiore [[perinatal]]ly or via breast feeding, that Eliza's HIV infection might have been prevented had Maggiore taken antiretroviral drugs or avoided breast feeding, that Eliza Jane's death was due to complications of AIDS, and that her death may have been preventable with proper medical care.&lt;ref name="LATimesArticle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="primetime"/&gt;

John Moore, a prominent HIV/AIDS researcher speaking at the 16th [[International AIDS Conference]], described Eliza Jane's death as a concrete example of the human harm that can result from [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] beliefs such as [[AIDS denialism]]:

{{Quotation|...infants whose HIV infected mothers listen to AIDS denialists never got the chance to make their own decisions. The Maggiore case received wide publicity. Christine Maggiore is a person who’s proselytized against the use of antiretrovirals to prevent HIV/AIDS. She’s a classic AIDS denialist, and she gave birth to a child who died at age three late last year of an AIDS-related infection. The coroner’s report clearly reports that the child died of AIDS. That was another unnecessary death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kaisernetwork.org/health_cast/uploaded_files/081306_ias_sat_journalism.pdf HIV and Responsible Journalism] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002035909/http://www.kaisernetwork.org/health_cast/uploaded_files/081306_ias_sat_journalism.pdf |date=October 2, 2008 }}, presented at the 16th annual International AIDS Conference, accessed 5 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Maggiore's inclusion as an exhibitor at the 13th [[International AIDS Conference]] in [[Durban]], [[South Africa]] has been criticized by AIDS activists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/06/04/opinion/edmoore.php Criticism of Maggiore's inclusion in the 13th International AIDS Conference]&lt;/ref&gt;

Maggiore's influence on Thabo Mbeki's decision to block funding of medical treatment of HIV-positive pregnant women was criticized following her death, with medical researchers noting a Harvard study which estimated "330,000 lives were lost to new AIDS infections during the time Mbeki blocked government funding of AZT treatment to mothers."&lt;ref name=ABCdeath&gt;{{cite news|title=Death of an AIDS Skeptic; Friends Say Christine Maggiore Endured Media Stress; Doctors Say She Caused Misery|publisher=ABCNews|date=2009-01-01|accessdate=2009-01-02|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/story?id=6558202&amp;page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The journalist and [[AIDS denialist]] [[Celia Farber]] wrote an article in June 2006 in the independent paper ''[[Los Angeles CityBeat]]'', arguing Maggiore's case and alleging incompetence, [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy]], and coverups on the part of the coroner, the mainstream AIDS community, the mainstream media, and the medical community. In particular, Farber's article claimed that the coroner's office had not disclosed the records of Eliza Jane's HIV serology test, and quoted another denialist who claimed Eliza Jane's [[lymphocyte|total lymphocyte count]] was elevated at the time of her death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lacitybeat.com/cms/story/detail/a_daughter_s_death_br_a_mother_s_survival/3887/ Celia Farber, ''A Daughter's Death, A Mother's Survival,'' Los Angeles City Beat]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal ramifications==
The death of Eliza Jane was investigated by the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] and the Los Angeles Department of [[Child Protective Services]] as a possible case of medical neglect or [[child endangerment]].&lt;ref name="LATimesArticle"/&gt; On September 15, 2006 the LA County District Attorney's office announced that it would not file charges against Christine Maggiore, noting the difficult in proving negligence given that Maggiore did take her sick child to several physicians.&lt;ref name="latimesfollowup"&gt;{{cote web |url=http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-christine-maggiore16-2006sep16-story.html |date=16 September 2006 |title=L.A. County D.A. Won't Act in Girl's AIDS-Related Death"] |last=Ornstein |first=Charles |website=L.A. Times |access-date=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2006, the Medical Board of California filed charges of [[gross negligence]] against one of these physicians, [[Paul M. Fleiss|Paul Fleiss]], who was Eliza Jane's pediatrician, alleging a failure to test Eliza Jane for HIV (or to document her parents' refusal of testing), a failure to counsel Maggiore to avoid breast-feeding at any time during the three years Maggiore breast-fed her daughter, given the risk of transmitting HIV, and similar violations of standard medical practice in Fleiss' care of a second HIV-positive child.&lt;ref name="latimesfollowup"/&gt;

In September 2007, the Medical Board of California issued its decision in the Fleiss case, effective October 8, 2007.&lt;ref name="FleissDecision"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aidstruth.org/MedBoardResult.pdf |title=Decision in the Matter of the Accusation Against: Paul Fleiss, M.D. - MBC Case #17-2005-169843 |accessdate=2007-10-21 |author=Attorney General |author2=Medical Board of California |date=2007-09-10 |format=PDF |publisher=Medical Board of California |pages=14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821124255/http://www.aidstruth.org/MedBoardResult.pdf |archivedate=August 21, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Board revoked Fleiss' medical license, but stayed this action in favor of a 35-month probation period during which Fleiss must submit to regular monitoring, pay costs, notify insurance and hospitals of the decision against him, and take continuing medical education (CME) classes and record-keeping courses. He is not permitted to supervise Physician Assistants and has affirmed the practice of referring HIV-positive patients to a specialist.

In an admonition letter dated September 13, 2007, an Inquiry Panel of the Colorado State Board of Medical Examiners issued its finding that Philip Incao's "care and treatment and lack of timely documentation" in the case of Eliza Jane Scovill "falls below the generally accepted standards of medical practice".  The Panel warned Incao that any further instances of such behavior could result in "formal disciplinary proceedings against your license to practice medicine".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aidstruth.org/sites/aidstruth.org/files/documents/Incao-Letter.pdf State of Colorado State Board of Medical Examiners letter to Dr. Philip F. Incao, M.D.] Accessed 04 May 2008.{{Dead link|date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maggiore and her husband, Robin Scovill, sued Los Angeles county in 2007 for allegedly violating their daughter's civil rights and privacy by releasing her autopsy report, which indicated that she was HIV-positive. A $15,000 settlement was reached in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/mar/06/local/me-briefs6 |date=6 March 2009 |title=L.A.

'''Douglas J. Burgum''' (born August 1, 1956) is an American entrepreneur, philanthropist and politician serving as the 33rd and current [[Governor of North Dakota]] since December 15, 2016. He is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wday.com/news/4155069-doug-burgum-elected-governor-speech-upcoming-wday|title=Doug Burgum elected Governor; speech upcoming on WDAY|publisher=|accessdate=November 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2017 profile in Forbes Magazine described him as “America's Best Entrepreneurial Governor.”&lt;ref&gt;Karlgaard, Rich; America's Best Entrepreneurial Governor; Forbes; June 13, 2017; [https://www.forbes.com/sites/richkarlgaard/2017/06/13/americas-best-entrepreneurial-governor/#10e35e037f21]&lt;/ref&gt;

He joined [[Great Plains Software]] in 1983 and became the company’s president in 1984, which he later sold to [[Microsoft]] for $1.1 billion in 2001. At Microsoft he became the head of Microsoft Business Solutions. He began serving as chairman of the board for [[Atlassian]] in 2012. He also served on the board for SuccessFactors starting in 2007, and as chairman from 2010 to 2012. Burgum is the founder of Kilbourne Group, a [[Fargo, North Dakota|Fargo]]-based real-estate development firm, and co-founder of Arthur Ventures.

In 2016, he announced his intention to run for Governor of North Dakota as a Republican candidate. With no formal political experience and despite losing the state Republican party's gubernatorial endorsement contest to longtime Attorney General [[Wayne Stenehjem]] at the party convention in April 2016, Burgum nevertheless defeated Stenehjem handily in the primary election two months later to claim the Republican nomination. Burgum ran against Democrat [[Marvin Nelson]] and Libertarian Marty Riske in the November [[North Dakota gubernatorial election, 2016|2016 gubernatorial election]], and won in a landslide with over 75% of the vote.&lt;ref name="Forum staff reports"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inforum.com/news/3924330-live-stream-doug-burgum-announcement-11-am|title=Live stream: Doug Burgum announcement at 11 a.m.|author=Forum staff reports|work=INFORUM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Burgum was born on August 1, 1956 and raised in [[Arthur, North Dakota]], where his grandfather founded a grain elevator in 1906.&lt;ref name=Horiz&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ndhorizons.com/featured/index.asp?ID=16 |title=Spring 2006: Doug Burgum's Prairie Fire 20 Years and Blazing |author=Gretchen Heim Olson |publisher=North Dakota Horizons |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160215232447/http://www.ndhorizons.com/featured/index.asp?ID=16 |archivedate=February 15, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[North Dakota State University]] to earn his undergraduate degree in 1978. During his senior year at NDSU he applied to the Stanford University Graduate School of Business. He also started a chimney-sweeping business. “The newspaper wrote a story about me as a chimney sweep,” he later recalled, “and ran a photo of me sitting on top of an icy chimney in below-freezing weather in Fargo. The story made the AP wire service. I was later told it caused quite a stir in the Stanford admissions office: 'Hey, there’s a chimney sweep from North Dakota who’s applied.'”&lt;ref&gt;Karlgaard, Rich; America's Best Entrepreneurial Governor; Forbes; June 13, 2017; [https://www.forbes.com/sites/richkarlgaard/2017/06/13/americas-best-entrepreneurial-governor/#10e35e037f21]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was accepted to study business at Stanford. While there, he befriended [[Steve Ballmer]], who would later be CEO of Microsoft. During his last year at Stanford, Burgum “spent the whole final quarter on a project team with Ballmer.”&lt;ref&gt;Karlgaard, Rich; America's Best Entrepreneurial Governor; Forbes; June 13, 2017; [https://www.forbes.com/sites/richkarlgaard/2017/06/13/americas-best-entrepreneurial-governor/#10e35e037f21]&lt;/ref&gt; He received his MBA from [[Stanford University]] Graduate School of Business in 1980. He would later receive honorary doctorates from North Dakota State&lt;ref name=NKS /&gt; in 2000 and from the [[University of Mary]] in 2006.&lt;ref name=Ent&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=742111&amp;privcapId=36833945|title=Douglas J.

==Executive career==
===Early career===
Following his graduation from Stanford GSB, Burgum moved to Chicago to become a consultant with [[McKinsey &amp; Company]].

== Butoh vocal theatre ==

Eseohe Arhebamen is the first [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] and native-born African [[butoh]] performer.&lt;ref name=SPalms&gt;{{cite web | url=http://swedishpalms.blogspot.com/2011/04/nigeriansk-butoh.html | title=Nigeriansk Butoh | author=Anna | publisher=Swedish Palms | date=30 April 2011 | accessdate=5 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Eseohe Arhebamen is the first performer to combine butoh dance with singing, talking, [[mudra]], [[sign language]], [[spoken word]], and experimental vocalizations after the traditional dance styles of the [[Edo people]] of West [[Africa]].&lt;ref name="SPalms"/&gt; She refers to this dance style as Butoh-Vocal Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vocal Styles: An Interview with Performance Artist Edoheart|url=http://www.claudiafriedlander.com/the-liberated-voice/2010/07/vocal-styles-an-interview-with-performance-artist-edoheart.html|publisher=The Liberated Voice|accessdate=20 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eseohe Arhebamen's Butoh-Vocal Theatre style arises out of her work in [[poetry]], music and the traditional Edo theater in which performers dance and sing simultaneously, and is influenced by her expressed belief in a common lingual history between the Edo people of Nigeria and the Japanese.&lt;ref name=SPalms /&gt; On 26 September 2010 Eseohe gave a performance at a [[Yukio Waguri]] intensive workshop demonstrating her style of Butoh-Vocal Theatre during which she danced butoh while singing [[Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory#Music|Pure Imagination]] from [[Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory]].

'''Faheem Ansari''', also known as '''Mohammad Faheem Ansari''',&lt;ref name="th-up-security"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2008/11/30/stories/2008113057360700.htm|title=U.P. to sensitise hoteliers on security issues|last=Khan |first=Atiq|date=30 November 2008|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|accessdate=17 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an Indian national who was charged with involvement in the [[2008 Mumbai attacks]]. He was also charged with being a member of the [[Lashkar-e-Toiba]] (LeT),&lt;ref name="ians-arrests"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.aol.in/news/story/2008021010289012000010/India/index.html|title=Yet another terror plot to target Mumbai foiled|date=10 February 2009|publisher=[[Indo Asian News Service]]|accessdate=17 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; an Islamic [[List of designated terrorist organizations|terrorist organization]] (designated as such by India and the USA, among other countries). He was arrested in February 2009 along with five others,&lt;ref name="ians-arrests" /&gt; charged with these crimes and prosecuted, but was acquitted after being given benefit of doubt. The late [[Shahid Azmi]] was his lawyer and fought his case ''[[pro bono]].'' Faheem Ansari was discharged by court in May 2010, a few months after Shahid Azmi's death by gunmen in February 2010.&lt;ref name="ie-charged"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/26-11-attacks-ansari-sabauddin-remanded-to-.../405003/|title=26/11 attacks: Ansari, Sabauddin remanded to police custody|date=31 December 2008|publisher=[[Indian Express]] – citing agencies|accessdate=17 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=acquitted/&gt;

==Background==
Ansari's family was originally from [[Uttar Pradesh]], but he was born and raised in [[Mumbai]]. He is married to Yasmin, with whom he has a daughter, Iqra.&lt;ref name="Iqra"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-05-05/mumbai/28282864_1_yasmin-terror-attack-attack-case|title=It is an honourable acquittal, says Faheem Ansari's wife|date=5 May 2010|publisher=[[The Times of India]]|accessdate=16 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the Lashkar e Toiba in 2003 while working in [[Dubai]].&lt;ref name="Ansari"/&gt; In 2007, he returned to Mumbai and stayed there for about three months.&lt;ref name="Ansari"/&gt; Though his parents and brothers were residing in the [[Goregaon]] suburb of the city, he made no attempt to contact them during his entire stay.&lt;ref name="Ansari"/&gt; He first stayed at a guest house in Grant Road, but after a few weeks rented a small accommodation.&lt;ref name="Ansari"/&gt; Ansari had initially planned on renting an accommodation in [[Colaba]], but due to the high rent there, decided to settle at Grant Road.&lt;ref name="Ansari"/&gt;

The [[Mumbai police]] alleged that Ansari did a reconnaissance of several prominent Mumbai landmarks, including the [[Mumbai Stock Exchange]], the Mumbai police headquarters at Crawford Market, the Maharashtra police headquarters at Colaba, the [[Mahalakshmi Temple, Mumbai|Mahalakshmi Temple]] and the [[Siddhivinayak Temple, Mumbai|Siddhivinayak temple]].&lt;ref name="Ansari"/&gt; Ansari went to the [[Taj Mahal Palace &amp; Tower|Taj Hotel]] and [[Oberoi Trident]] as a tourist and shot video footage of the interiors.&lt;ref name="Ansari"/&gt; He also videotaped the [[Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus]] and the [[Nariman House]], and hand-drew the maps of all the 26/11 targets.&lt;ref name="Ansari"/&gt; In December 2007, Ansari travelled to [[Kathmandu]], where he met and handed over the material to his associate, Sabahuddin Shaikh.&lt;ref name="Ansari"/&gt; He then travelled on a Pakistani passport to [[Karachi]] and gave the maps to an LET member named Muzammil.&lt;ref name="Ansari"&gt;{{harvnb|Baweja|2009|pp=164–165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest==
On 10 February 2008, [[Uttar Pradesh]] police arrested Ansari along with five others.&lt;ref name="ians-arrests" /&gt; These included [[Pakistani people|Pakistani]] nationals Romez alias "Amar Singh" and Sehwez alias "Ajay Malhotra" and Indian nationals Sohel, Sawauddin (or Sabauddin) Sanju and Baba Jung Bahadur.&lt;ref name="ians-arrests" /&gt; He was arrested for his involvement with an attack on a [[Central Reserve Police Force]] camp in [[Rampur, Uttar Pradesh|Rampur]] on 31 December 2007, in which 7 paramilitary personnel and 1 civilian were killed.&lt;ref name="th-up-security"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ians-arrests"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CRPF"/&gt; The interrogation revealed that Ansari had performed reconnaissance over twelve places in Mumbai, including government, police, transportation, tourist and financial sites over the course of two months.&lt;ref name="th-up-security" /&gt;&lt;ref name="toi-recce"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2008-02-17/india/27757203_1_recce-faheem-ansari-ats|title=LeT man did recce of 12 places in Mumbai|last=Hafeez|first=Mateen |date=17 February 2008|publisher=[[Times of India]]|accessdate=17 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ansari later alleged that the [[Mumbai police]] conveniently made him a scapegoat and deliberately falsified evidence against him.&lt;ref name=acquitted&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ndtv.com/news/india/co-accused-fahim-ansari-sahabuddin-acquitted-22805.php|title=Co-accused Fahim Ansari, Sabahuddin, acquitted|last=NDTV correspondent |date=30 March 2009|publisher=[[NDTV]]|accessdate=16 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alleged role in the Mumbai attacks and acquittal==
On 31 December 2008, Ansari, along with [[Sabauddin Shaikh]], was formally accused of aiding the November 2008 attackers in Mumbai.&lt;ref name="ie-charged" /&gt; The interrogation of [[Ajmal Kasab]] and of Ansari, revealed that none of the attackers had been in the city before the attacks, and acted solely on intelligence provided by Ansari.&lt;ref name="toi-charged"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-01-02/mumbai/28009042_1_crime-branch-nariman-house-recce|title='Kasab, aides never did city recce'|last=Hafeez|first=Mateen |date=2 January 2009|publisher=[[Times of India]]|accessdate=17 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 February 2010, his lawyer [[Shahid Azmi]] was murdered in what was suspected by authorities to be a professional [[contract killing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article7024904.ece|title=Mumbai terror lawyer Shahid Azmi killed in 'professional hit'|last=Blakely |first=Rhys |date=12 February 2010|publisher=[[Times of India]]|accessdate=2 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 May 2010, Ansari and the co-accused Sabauddin Shaikh were acquitted of any complicity in the attacks. In the acquittal, the Judge  blasted the Mumbai police for the case it made against him and Sabauddin Shaikh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ndtv.com/news/india/co-accused-fahim-ansari-sahabuddin-acquitted-22805.php|title=Co-accused Fahim Ansari, Sabahuddin, acquitted|last=NDTV correspondent |date=3 May 2010|publisher=[[NDTV]]|accessdate=16 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were shifted from [[Arthur Road Jail]] to Uttar Pradesh to stand trial in connection with the CRPF camp attack at [[Rampur, Uttar Pradesh|Rampur]] in 2007.&lt;ref name="CRPF"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/faheem-ansari-sabauddin-shifted-to-up/628470/|title=Faheem Ansari, Sabauddin shifted to UP |date=2 June 2010|publisher=Indian Express|accessdate=16 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexual harassment==
Advocate Ejaz Naqvi, the lawyer for Ansari, presented in court an allegation that a female FBI agent had removed all of Ansari's clothes and showed him pornographic films.&lt;ref name="tele-sex-harass"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/india/4587941/Female-FBI-officer-tortured-Mumbai-terror-attacks-suspect-with-sex.html|title=Female FBI officer 'tortured Mumbai terror attacks suspect with sex' |last=Leach |first=Ben |date=11 February 2009|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=17 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Naqvi also requested that Ansari be taken for a medical examination.&lt;ref name="toi-sex-harass"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-02-10/india/28056587_1_sexual-harassment-faheem-ansari-agent|title=LeT man accuses FBI agent of 'sexual assault'|last=Kartikeya|date=10 February 2009|publisher=[[Times of India]]|accessdate=17 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court asked the [[Crime Branch]] to investigate and report by 26 February 2009,&lt;ref name="toi-sex-harass" /&gt; and ordered the medical examination.&lt;ref name="tele-sex-harass" /&gt; Ansari had earlier questioned the right of FBI agents to interrogate him.&lt;ref name="toi-sex-harass" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6972">'''Rosa Frances Emily Swiney''', ''née'' Biggs, (21 April 1847&amp;nbsp;– 3 May 1922) was an early British [[feminist]], writer, and [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophist]]. She was born in [[Poona]], India, but spent most of her childhood in Ireland. In 1871 she married Major John Swiney (1832–1918), and devoted herself to becoming a full-time wife and mother. Swiney relocated to [[Cheltenham]], Gloucestershire in 1877, a place she described later in her life as "the town of no ideals", where her husband joined her ten years later.{{r|ODNB}}

Since 1890, Swiney was a feminist activist, lecturer, and writer in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire. She co-founded the Cheltenham [[National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies|Women’s Suffrage Society]] (Cheltenham WSS) in 1896; was Vice President of the Cheltenham Food Reform and Health Association; and lectured in organisations such as the Higher Thought Centre in London, Theosophical lodges, and Ethical Societies. Swiney was a member of the [[Theosophical Society]] (TS), the [[Sociological society|Sociological Society]], the [[National Union of Women Workers]] (NUWW), the [[Eugenics Education Society]], the Secular Education League, the [[Women's Freedom League|Woman’s Freedom League]] (WFL), and the [[Women's Social and Political Union|National Woman’s Social and Political Union]] (WSPU), as well as of the council of the Woman’s Branch of the International Neo-Malthusian League.

In addition to her activism, she engaged in feminist debates through her writings. She regularly contributed to ''The Anglo-Russian'', ''The Christian Commonwealth, The Awakener, [[The Westminster Review]]'' as well as the ''Indian Ladies’ Magazine'' and the American feminist paper ''The Woman’s Tribune''. Furthermore, Swiney published a series of books and pamphlets, such as ''The Awakening of Women'' (1899) and ''The Bar of Isis'' (1907). 

Swiney was personally connected to various prominent and important figures of her time, such as [[Charlotte Despard]], [[Harriet McIlquham]], [[Charlotte Carmichael Stopes|Charlotte Stopes]], [[Margaret Sibthorp|Margaret Sibthorpe]], [[Elizabeth Clarke Wolstenholme Elmy|Elizabeth Wolstenholme Elmy]], and [[Annie Besant]].

Since 1910, her books were co-published by the [[League of Isis]], which she founded in 1909. The League of Isis aimed to bring about ‘the betterment of the Race, by individual observance of the Natural Law of reproduction (…) for the building up of the Higher Self’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Swiney|first=Frances|date=1910|title=The League of Isis: Rules’|url=|journal=Racial Problems No. 14|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This organisation, together with her writings, reflects a deep engagement in theosophical teachings: the belief in a spiritual evolution and in the Divine Mother (Isis), as well as the convincement that Theosophy can overcome the boundaries between science and religion.

Contemporary conceptions of motherhood and race strongly influenced Frances Swiney, the Theosophist, feminist, and eugenicist. 

Like other feminists at that time, she reversed the negative connotations of womanhood and motherhood and used it for her own argumentation, to fight for women’s enfranchisement. Swiney claimed justice for women as ‘aiders in creating the wealth of the nation and as mothers of the race’.

Swiney’s feminist emphasis on motherhood, race, and evolution also influenced her interpretations of Theosophy. This is the reason why Swiney focussed on one particular aspect of theosophical thought: the Divine Feminine, or the Divine Mother, as personated by the Goddess Isis, and her role in the cosmic process. Herein, Swiney’s theosophical concepts differ from mainstream Theosophy. This is evidence for her own, personal, feminist agenda within an esoteric framework.&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Mother, then, is the Supreme Unity, uniting all in Herself. It is not difficult why in the eternal sequence of things in evolution the human race is awakening to the truth of the Divine Feminine in the present stage of the world history. (…) Relatively speaking, the race, still in its immature youth, expelled the Mother from the nursery, and anarchy and chaos prevailed, (…). The evolved soul has always known that this intense craving for union once more with the Feminine Principle must be the first sign of the regenerate heart."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Ancient Road|last=Swiney|first=Frances|publisher=Bell and Sons|year=1918|isbn=|location=London|pages=485 ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;For her, the Divine Mother was oneness of the sublime cause, and all emanation would derive from her and return to her in the end of the circled cosmic process: &lt;blockquote&gt;"For the soul is the feminine creative principle in man (…). The Feminine is therefore the inner nature of man, and woman (…), the objective representative of the Divine Feminine."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Esoteric Teachings of the Gnostics|last=Swiney|first=Frances|publisher=Mellon, Williams &amp; Co.|year=1909|isbn=|location=London|pages=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Swiney’s imperial context (personal and family connections to British India) influenced her perception and interpretation of Theosophy and, therefore, her theosophical feminism. Furthermore, Theosophy, and esotericism in general, were deeply embedded in the discourse of Britain’s First Wave Feminism, as it is evident especially by the vast number of theosophical feminists.

'''Franz Romeikat''' (born October 7, 1904, date of death unknown) was an [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]-''[[Unterscharführer]]'' and staff member at [[Auschwitz concentration camp]]. He was prosecuted in the [[Auschwitz Trial]].

Romeikat was born in [[Iwenberg]] (then in [[East Prussia]]). A watchmaker by trade, he became a member of the [[Nazi party]] and the SS by March 6, 1933. In November 1940 he was drafted into the [[Waffen-SS]] and in February 1941 he was assigned to Auschwitz. At first he worked in the clothing section, then from November 1942 to October 1944 he worked in Department IV (Administration), dealing with prisoners' property. He was cruel to prisoners, sometimes beating them, and participated in the plundering of property from those killed in the Birkenau gas chambers.

Romeikat was tried by the [[Supreme National Tribunal]] at the Auschwitz Trial in [[Kraków]] and sentenced to 15 years in prison for his crimes. Due to an amnesty, he was released in the fifties.

'''Geoffrey A. Tandy''' (1900–1969) was a British marine biologist and broadcaster.

==Life==
Tandy graduated from [[Oxford University]] in 1921, and pursued graduate studies at [[Birkbeck College]], in the University of London. He was employed at the [[Natural History Museum]] in London from 1926 to 1948, specialising in the biology of algae, after which he worked for the British [[Foreign Office]] until 1954. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/CalmView/Record.aspx?src=CalmView.Persons&amp;id=PX1130|title=Search Results|website=www.nhm.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A friend of [[T. S.

&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Gmurnu.jpg|thumb|George Murnu]] --&gt;
'''George Murnu''' ({{IPA-ro|ˈɟe̯orɟe ˈmurnu}}; [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]]: '''Ioryi al Murnu'''; 1 January 1868, [[Veria]], [[Salonica Vilayet]], [[Ottoman Empire]], now in [[Greece]] – 17 November 1957, [[Bucharest]]) was a [[Romania]]n university professor, archaeologist, historian, translator, and poet of [[Aromanians|Aromanian]] origin.

After attending the courses of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20060101124750/http://www.vlachophiles.net/rom_schools.htm Romanian primary and secondary schools] in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] at [[Bitola]], he attended the [[University of Bucharest]]. In 1893, at age 25, Murnu was appointed professor at the [[University of Iaşi]] and shortly afterwards was awarded a [[scholarship]] by the Romanian State in order to complete his postgraduate studies in [[Munich]], and, after several years he returned to Romania after completing a [[doctorate]] in [[philology]]. A fruitful scholarly activity followed, culminating in Murnu becoming a chairman professor of archaeology at the University of Bucharest.

In 1909, he was appointed head of the National Archaeological Museum in Bucharest by the Ministry of Public Instruction and Religious Confessions.  He has translated an accomplished version of the ''[[Odyssey]]'' and ''[[Iliad]]'' into [[Romanian language|Romanian]]. He also wrote his own works of poetry (with [[bucolic]] themes), both in Romanian and in his native [[Aromanian language]].

Murnu was a sympathizer of the [[far right]] [[Iron Guard]], and was an intimate friend of the Aromanian [[separatism|secessionist]] politician, [[Alcibiades Diamandi]] who in 1917 participated in a failed effort to form an independent [[Principality of Pindus]] under the protection of Italy. After the end of [[World War II]], Murnu was not subject to legal investigation - probably due to his age and prestige.

He was elected a full [[list of members of the Romanian Academy|member of the Romanian Academy]]. Nowadays, a [https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=strada+george+murnu+mangalia&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta= street] in the Romanian [[Black Sea]] port of [[Mangalia]] bears his name.

'''Gülşah Hatun''' ({{lang-ota|کل شاہ خاتون}}; died {{circa}} 1487) was a consort of Sultan [[Mehmed the Conqueror]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]].

==Early years==
She married Mehmed in 1449, when he was still a prince and the governor of Manisa. Just before Sultan [[Murad II]]'s death,{{sfn|Babinger|1992|p=61}}{{sfn|Stavrides|2001|p=351}} she gave birth to her only son, Şehzade Mustafa, who was to be his father's favourite.{{sfn|Uluçay|1988|p=39}}{{sfn|Stavrides|2001|p=351}} According to Turkish tradition, all princes were expected to work as provincial governors as a part of their training. Mustafa was sent to govern [[Konya]] and later Kayseri, and Gülşah accompanied him.{{sfn|Peirce|1993|p=47}}{{sfn|Sakaoğlu|2008|p=129}}

==Mustafa's death== 
Mustafa died in June 1474  of natural causes.{{sfn|Babinger|1992|p=330}} It was rumored that Mustafa had approached [[Mahmud Pasha Angelović|Mahmud Pasha]]'s wife and thus making him the person behind Mustafa's murder.{{sfn|Babinger|1992|p=331}}{{sfn|Stavrides|2001|p=351}} There are speculations that Gülşah Hatun may have been a party to the illicit relations between the prince and wife of Mahmud Pasha.{{sfn|Peirce|1993|p=299}} [[Giovanni Maria Angiolello]], a Venetian traveler, author of an important historical report on the Aq Qoyunlu and early Safavid Persia, who was in the service of Mustafa, and who with the rest of Mustafa’s household accompanied the prince’s cortege from his post his [[Kayseri]] to Bursa, where he was buried, denied any role for Mahmud Pasha in Mustafa's death;{{sfn|Babinger|1992|p=331}}{{sfn|Peirce|1993|p=50}}{{sfn|Stavrides|2001|p=351}} nevertheless Mehmed II had the man executed shortly thereafter.{{sfn|Stavrides|2001|p=181}}

Gülşah Hatun had not been informed of his death, and with the wagon with her dead son stopped outside the palace, she and the women of her train began to wail. Babinger wrote that Mustafa's only child, Princess  Nergiszade , shared her grandmother's grief, and the lamentations went on endlessly.{{sfn|Babinger|1992|p=330}} Mehmed sent word that she should remain in Bursa with those maidens whom she required. Mehmed also had a good provision made for her, where she might live there honorably. He ordered that Mustafa’s daughter and her mother and rest of the ladies together with all others belonging to the court of his decreased son should come to Istanbul. All the women were lodged in the palace where women of Mehmed's harem stayed, and after several days the maidens were married to courtiers.{{sfn|Peirce|1993|p=50}} Nergiszade married her cousin [[Şehzade Ahmet]], son of Şehzade [[Bayezid II|Bayezid]]. {{sfn|Babinger|1992|p=332}}{{sfn|Süreyya|1969|p=239}} According to Alderson Mustafa had two daughters: Nergisşah and Bülbül. Nergiszade married  [[Şehzade Ahmet]] in 1474 and Bülbül married Şehzade Abdullah, also son of Şehzade [[Bayezid II|Bayezid]] in 1480.{{sfn|Alderson|1956|loc=tables XXVII,XXVIII}}

==Last years==
In 1479, Gülşah Hatun was granted the village of Sığırcalu in Dimetoka,{{sfn|Archivum|1983|p=191}} its revenues were converted into mülk so that Gülşah could turn it into an endowment for the eventual upkeep of her tomb in Bursa.{{sfn|Zachariadou|1996|p=33}} Gülşah Hatun died in 1487, and was buried in Bursa in the tomb she had built for herself near that of Mustafa.{{sfn|Peirce|1993|p=50}}{{sfn|Uluçay|1988|p=39}}{{sfn|Sakaoğlu|2008|p=129}} The tomb of Gülşah Hatun has an entrance with elegant jogged voussoirs, and marble cenotaphs inside, newly-made from old pieces.{{sfn|Greenhalgh|2009|p=475}}

[[File:Biret comte.png|80px|thumb|right|Count of the French Empire]]
'''Horace François Bastien Sébastiani de La Porta''' ({{lang-co|Oraziu Francescu Bastianu Sebastiani De A Porta}}; 11 November 1771 – 20 July 1851) was a French soldier, diplomat, and politician, who served as [[List of Naval Ministers of France|Naval Minister]], [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (France)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]], and [[Minister of State]] under the [[July Monarchy]].

Having joined the [[French Revolutionary Army]] in his youth, Sébastiani rose through its ranks before becoming a supporter of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]]. Sébastiani was the [[French Consulate]]'s emissary to The [[Levant]], notably drafting plans to reconquer [[Ottoman Egypt]], and later served as the [[First French Empire|Empire]]'s [[French Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire|Ambassador to The Porte]]. In the latter capacity, he attempted to increase French influence and signaled pro-[[Russian Empire|Russian]] activities in the [[Danubian Principalities]], thus provoking the [[Russo-Turkish War (1806–1812)|War of 1806–1812]]. In 1807, Sébastiani organized the defense of [[Constantinople]] during the [[Dardanelles Operation]]. Recalled due to [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] pressure after the deposition of [[Selim III]], he served in the [[Peninsular War]] and resided in the [[Alhambra]], took part in the unsuccessful [[Napoleon's invasion of Russia|invasion of Russia]], and defended the [[Champagne (region)|Champagne]] region in front of the [[Sixth Coalition]].

Sébastiani recognized the [[Bourbon Restoration]], but rallied with Napoleon during the [[Hundred Days]], being elected to the [[Chamber of Deputies of France|Chamber]] for the first time in 1815. Briefly exiled after the return of [[List of French monarchs|King]] [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]], he was again admitted as a Deputy in 1819, sitting with the [[History of the Left in France|Left]] faction, supporting [[Liberalism and radicalism in France|liberal politics]], and coming into conflict with the [[Jean-Baptiste de Villèle]] Cabinet. After the [[July Revolution]], he endorsed [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis-Philippe]]. Sébastiani's time as [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Development (France)|Foreign Minister]] saw France's involvement in the [[Belgian Revolution]], its refusal to sanction the [[November Uprising]], the controversial solution to a commercial dispute with the [[United States]], and the French occupation of [[Ancona]]. In later years, he progressed in [[French Government]] service as an [[ambassador]].

The 1847 murder of his daughter, [[Francoise, Duchess de Praslin]] indirectly helped spark the [[Revolutions of 1848 in France|1848 Revolution]].

==Mission to Egypt and 1805 Campaign==
Sébastiani negotiated with the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] military commanders in the aftermath of the [[French invasion of Egypt (1798)]], asking them to abide by the newly signed [[Treaty of Amiens]] and withdraw from [[Alexandria]];&lt;ref name="encyclopediaamericana"/&gt;&lt;ref name="revuemondes"/&gt; following this he met with Ottoman officials in [[Cairo]], unsuccessfully offering to mediate between them and rebellious [[bey]]s (''see [[Muhammad Ali's seizure of power]]'').&lt;ref name="encyclopediaamericana"/&gt; In late 1802, he traveled to [[Acre, Israel|Akka]], and negotiated a trade agreement with the local [[pasha]].&lt;ref name="encyclopediaamericana"/&gt;

During this period, Sébastiani theorized that, despite Egyptian Campaign's failure, the French could yet again establish their control over the region.&lt;ref name="turnbull"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jeremyblack"&gt;[[Jeremy Black (historian)|Jeremy Black]], ''From Louis XIV to Napoleon: the Fate of a Great Power'', [[Routledge]], London, 1999, p.183&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ingram"&gt;Edward Ingram, ''Empire-Building and Empire-Builders: Twelve Studies'', [[Routledge]], London, 1995, p.95–96&lt;/ref&gt; He publicized this view in a report, published by ''[[Le Moniteur Universel]]'' on 30 January 1803,&lt;ref name="jeremyblack"/&gt; posing a threat for both British and [[Imperial Russia|Russian]] interests; this probably contributed to deescalating relations between the latter two over the prolonged British presence in [[Malta]], with [[Henry Addington, 1st Viscount Sidmouth|Henry Addington]]'s [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] indicating that [[British troops]] would remain as long as [[France]] held designs to invade Egypt.&lt;ref name="ingram"/&gt;

Returning to France, he was put in charge of the [[littoral]] from the mouth of the [[Vilaine]] (in [[Morbihan]]) to [[Brest, France|Brest]],&lt;ref name="massey"/&gt; before, in 1804, being despatched on a short mission to the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] in Vienna.&lt;ref name="massey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="encyclopediaamericana"/&gt; Promoted [[Brigadier-General]] in 1803,&lt;ref name="mullie"/&gt;&lt;ref name="massey"/&gt; he commanded ''[[La Grande Armée|Grande Armée]]'' troops during the [[Battle of Ulm]]. After leading a successful attack on [[Günzburg]],  Sébastiani followed the [[Austrian Empire|Austrians]] into [[Moravia]] (1805),&lt;ref name="massey"/&gt; having been promoted ''[[Général|Général de division]]'' after the [[Battle of Austerlitz]] in 1805, where he was wounded.&lt;ref name="mullie"/&gt;&lt;ref name="massey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gentlemens"/&gt;&lt;ref name="encyclopediaamericana"/&gt;

==Embassy to Selim III==
{{main|Dardanelles Operation (1807)}}
[[Image:Ster van de Orde van de Halve Maan Turkije 1800.jpg|thumb|150px|Order of The Crescent insignia]]

Appointed [[French Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire|French Ambassador]] to [[Sublime Porte|The Porte]] on 12 April 1806, and gaining his post on 10 August,&lt;ref name="hamiltonboogert"&gt;Alastair Hamilton, Maurits H. van den Boogert, Alexander H. de Groot, ''Friends and Rivals in the East: Studies in Anglo-Dutch Relations in The Levant from the Seventeenth Century to the Early Nineteenth Century'', Brill Publishers, Leiden, 2000, p.231&lt;/ref&gt; he attempted to convince [[Ottoman dynasty|Sultan]] [[Selim III]] to exclude the [[Royal Navy]] from access through the [[Dardanelles]].&lt;ref name="gentlemens"/&gt; According to a biographical essay published by the ''[[Revue des Deux Mondes]]'' in 1833, Sébastiani faced almost universal hostility from the anti-French [[diplomatic corps]]—whose opinions were influenced by the Russian [[Andrei Budberg|Count Andrei Yakovlevich Budberg]] and the British Ambassador [[Charles Arbuthnot]]. The same article claimed: "France had for its allies only the envoys of [[Enlightenment Spain|Spain]] and [[Batavian Republic|Holland]]".&lt;ref name="revuemondes"/&gt; Among Horace Sébastiani's moves to enlist [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] support for Napoleon was the establishment of a [[printing press]] in [[Constantinople]], which published works of French literature translated into [[Ottoman Turkish language|Turkish]] and Arabic.&lt;ref name="massey"/&gt;

Sébastiani persuaded the Ottomans to take a stand against Russia after bringing attention to the anti-Ottoman conspiracy in [[Principality of Wallachia|Wallachia]], formed around Prince [[Constantine Ypsilantis]], as well as to the suspicious policies of [[Principality of Moldova|Moldavia]]'s Prince [[Alexander Mourousis]].&lt;ref name="revuemondes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="djuvara"&gt;[[Neagu Djuvara]], ''Între Orient şi Occident.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"He felt that [Ypsilantis] sided with the Russians and had an understanding with [[Osman Pazvantoğlu|Pazvantoğlu]] of [[Vidin]] and with [[Karađorđe Petrović|Czerny-George]] the Serbian, both of whom had rebelled against The Porte."&lt;ref name="ghica"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The conflict itself started when Russia considered Ypsilantis' deposition to go against the letter of the [[Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca]] and the [[Treaty of Jassy]].&lt;ref name="revuemondes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="djuvara"/&gt; While [[Andrei Budberg|the Russian Count]] and Ambassador Arbuthnot prepared to leave [[Istanbul]], The Porte convened to have the two Princes reinstated.&lt;ref name="revuemondes"/&gt; Despite this, Russian troops under General [[Ivan Ivanovich Michelson|Ivan Michelson]] and Count [[Mikhail Miloradovich]] entered the two [[Danubian Principalities]] (''see [[Russo-Turkish War (1806–12)]]'').&lt;ref name="revuemondes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="djuvara"/&gt; Prince Ypsilantis had previously escaped to the Russian camp, and was briefly considered by his allies as ruler over both [[principality|principalities]] (just before Russian occupation took over);&lt;ref name="ghica"/&gt; the French Consul to [[Moldavia]], [[Charles-Frédéric Reinhard]], reportedly not informed of Sébastiani's contacts with Selim, was arrested by the Russian troops.&lt;ref name="djuvara"/&gt; As a major consequence of this chain of events, France pulled the strings of Ottoman foreign policy.&lt;ref name="revuemondes"/&gt;

[[Image:Sebastianilegiondhonneur.jpg|thumb|Horace Sébastiani, portrait by [[Tassaert family|Philippe Joseph Tassaert]], ca. 1800]]
During the parallel [[Anglo-Turkish War (1807–09)|Anglo-Turkish War]] in 1807, Sébastiani helped the Ottomans in the successful defense of [[Constantinople]] against the British squadron of [[Sir John Duckworth, 1st Baronet|Admiral Duckworth]] (''see [[Dardanelles Operation (1807)|Dardanelles Operation]]'').&lt;ref name="mullie"/&gt;&lt;ref name="massey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="encyclopediaamericana"/&gt;&lt;ref name="revuemondes"/&gt; The British bombardment, coming at a time when the Muslim population was celebrating ''[[Eid al-Adha]]'',&lt;ref name="revuemondes"/&gt; was met with panic, and Sébastiani's group of French military officers was soon the only organized force present on the European side.&lt;ref name="revuemondes"/&gt; In his messages to Selim, Sir John Duckworth asked for the French ambassador to be removed, for the [[Ottoman fleet]] and the Dardanelles military facilities to be handed over,&lt;ref name="mullie"/&gt;&lt;ref name="revuemondes"/&gt; and for Russia to be granted rule over [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]].&lt;ref name="revuemondes"/&gt; The [[Sultan]] sent envoys requesting Sébastiani to leave Ottoman territory, but the French Ambassador explained that he would not do so until being ordered by Selim himself.&lt;ref name="mullie"/&gt;&lt;ref name="revuemondes"/&gt;

As the matter was being debated, [[Janissary]] forces on the [[Anatolia]]n shore organized themselves, and, once increased in strength, began responding to the attack.&lt;ref name="revuemondes"/&gt; Selim subsequently asked Sébastiani and his men (including [[Louis Gustave le Doulcet, comte de Pontécoulant|Louis Gustave le Doulcet]] and [[:es:José Martínez de Hervás|José Martínez Hervás, marquis d'Alménara]], as well as the embassy's secretary [[:fr:Florimond de Faÿ de La Tour-Maubourg|Florimond de Faÿ de La Tour-Maubourg]]), to oversee Constantinople's defense and the line of fire nearby [[Topkapı Palace]], organizing maneuvers which caused Duckworth to withdraw.&lt;ref name="mullie"/&gt;&lt;ref name="revuemondes"/&gt;

In 1806, Sébastiani married Jeanne-Françoise-Antoinette (Fanny) [[:fr:Famille de Franquetot|Franquetot de Coigny]], only daughter of [[François-Henri de Franquetot de Coigny|François-Henri de Franquetot, marquis de Coigny]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/mss/online/online-mss-catalogues/cats/port_londonplf_trusteeships.html ''Portland (London) Collection: Catalogue of Family and Financial Papers of the Dukes of Portland, 1583–1940''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070320094034/http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/mss/online/online-mss-catalogues/cats/port_londonplf_trusteeships.html |date=2007-03-20 }}, at the [[University of Nottingham]], retrieved 5 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; She died in childbirth while in Constantinople, just a few days before the [[Sultan]] was deposed (14 April 1807),&lt;ref name="fisquet"&gt;Honoré Fisquet, "Praslin, Charles-Laure-Hugues-Théobald, duc de Choiseul", in ''Nouvelle biographie générale depuis les temps les plus reculés jusqu'à nos jours'', Tome 40, Firmin Didot, Paris, 1862, p.979–980&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="juchereau"/&gt; and left Sébastiani a large fortune.&lt;ref name="massey"/&gt; Upon hearing news of her death, Sultan Selim transmitted condolences through his ''[[Dragoman]]''.&lt;ref name="juchereau"/&gt;

==Embassy to Mustafa IV==
[[File:Badge of Légion d'honneur.png|thumb|right|120px|''Légion d'honneur'']]
The successful rebellion led by [[Kabakçı Mustafa]] and the Janissary troops put an end to French diplomatic success. Sébastiani negotiated with Kabakçı, while the British sought support from various factions inside Constantinople&lt;ref name="revuemondes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="juchereau"&gt;Antoine de Juchereau de Saint-Denys, ''Histoire de l'Empire Ottoman depuis 1792 jusqu'en 1844'', Tome II, Comptoirs des Imprimeurs-unis, Paris, 1844, p.205, 208–209, 211–215&lt;/ref&gt; — the ''Dragoman'', [[Alexandros Soutzos|Aleko Soutzos]], eventually informed the French Ambassador on the parallel British projects.&lt;ref name="revuemondes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="juchereau"/&gt; This resulted in Soutzos' beheading&lt;ref name="revuemondes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ghica"/&gt; — that which, in [[Ion Ghica]]'s version of events, caused the [[Soutzos family]] of [[Phanariote]]s to abandon their commitment to France and begin supporting Russia.&lt;ref name="ghica"/&gt; According to the ''Revue des Deux Mondes'' biography, Sébastiani had betrayed Aleko Soutzos' confidence by revealing as many details of Anglo-Ottoman negotiations as to render it clear that the ''Dragoman'' had been acting as his spy, and by failing to respect the promise of French protection.&lt;ref name="revuemondes"/&gt;

Under the new monarch, [[Mustafa IV]], he attempted to impose a pro-French pasha as governor of [[Baghdad]], and later provoked a scandal by asking for the Imperial Executioner, ''Bostanci-başi'', to be demoted—this came after three [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusan]] subjects, having been found guilty of theft, were subjected to ''[[falaka]]'', despite the facts that the recent annexation of Ragusa by France offered them a degree of immunity. As a result of his pressures, Sébastiani obtained rule over the province of Baghdad for his favorite, and, in return, allowed the ''Bostanci-başi'' to remain in office.&lt;ref name="juchereau"/&gt;

He asked to be recalled in April 1807,&lt;ref name="encyclopediaamericana"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hamiltonboogert"/&gt;&lt;ref name="juchereau"/&gt; being replaced by ''[[Chargé d'affaires]]'' Faÿ de La Tour Maubourg.&lt;ref name="hamiltonboogert"/&gt;&lt;ref name="juchereau"/&gt; This departure was also prompted by renewed British requests.&lt;ref name="massey"/&gt; Shortly before his leaving, Sultan Mustafa awarded Sébastiani the [[Order of the Crescent]] 1st Class,&lt;ref name="massey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="revuemondes"/&gt; which has been interpreted as a measure to alleviate the impact of British successes.&lt;ref name="massey"/&gt; According to other accounts, Mustafa himself had become deeply dissatisfied with Sébastiani's interventions and policies.&lt;ref name="juchereau"/&gt; Upon his return to France, Sébastiani received the ''[[Légion d'honneur|Grand Aigle de la Légion d'honneur]]''.&lt;ref name="massey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="revuemondes"/&gt; The ''Revue des Deux Mondes'' speculated that, based on the [[Corsica]]n heritage he shared with Sébastiani:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"the Emperor would often keep his eyes closed in respect to his Generals' mistakes.&lt;br/&gt;As for [Sébastiani's] diplomatic skills, Napoleon was so affected that he sent him to the arms as soon as he returned from the Orient, and did not assign him to any negotiations until his fall [of 1814]."&lt;ref name="revuemondes"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Peninsular War and 1813 Campaign==
[[Image:Granada5.JPG|thumb|The [[Alhambra]] citadel, Granada]]
Sébastiani became a [[Count]] of the [[First French Empire|Empire]], and commanded the [[IV Corps (Grande Armée)|IVth Corps]] in the [[Peninsular War]], notably at the [[Battle of Ciudad-Real]],&lt;ref name="meyerskl"/&gt; the [[Battle of Talavera]],&lt;ref name="gentlemens"/&gt; and the [[Battle of Almonacid]].&lt;ref name="mullie"/&gt;&lt;ref name="massey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="meyerskl"/&gt; In 1810, he took [[Linares, Jaén|Linares]], [[Jaén, Spain|Jaén]], [[Granada]] and [[Málaga]].&lt;ref name="gentlemens"/&gt;&lt;ref name="meyerskl"/&gt; Troops under his command included a group of Polish ''[[émigré]]'' soldiers,&lt;ref name="revuemondes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gnorowski"&gt;S. B. Gnorowski, ''Insurrection of Poland in 1830–31: And the Russian Rule Preceding it Since 1815'', James Ridgway, London, 1839, p.223–224&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="niecks"&gt;[[Frederick Niecks]], ''Frédéric Chopin as a Man and Musician'', Volume 2, Kessinger Publishing, Whitefish, 2004, p.8&lt;/ref&gt; among them [[Wojciech Grzymała|Albert Grzymała]], who served on his staff and was later noted for his friendship with [[Frédéric Chopin]].&lt;ref name="niecks"/&gt;

Starting from that date, Sébastiani gained a reputation for lacking leadership skills: popularly nicknamed "General Surprise" as a result of having been caught out by enemy troops a significant number of times, he was argued by [[Jean Baptiste Antoine Marcellin de Marbot|Jean-Baptiste de Marbot]] to have been noted for nothing other than mediocrity.&lt;ref name="haythornthwaite"&gt;Philip J. Haythornthwaite, ''Napoleon's Commanders (2): c1809–15'', [[Osprey Publishing]], Botley, 2002, p.51&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 1833 ''[[Revue des Deux Mondes]]'', he had also become known for his lassitude, to the point where Napoleon himself grew irate. The same source recounted that, after Talavera de la Reina and especially after Almonacid, the general raised suspicion that he wasted men and resources, systematically failed to report all his casualties, and seriously exaggerated the scale of his victories. It was contended that the Emperor eventually withdrew Sébastiani's command of the IVth Corps after concluding that this assessment was correct.&lt;ref name="revuemondes"/&gt;

Some sources claim that Sébastiani was created ''[[Duke|1º Duque de Murcia]]'' by Napoleon;&lt;ref name="massey"/&gt; according to the ''Revue'', although nominated for the title by the new [[List of Spanish monarchs|King of Spain]], [[Joseph Bonaparte]], Sébastiani was denied appointment by Napoleon (a gesture alleged to have itself been based on the General's conduct at Almonacid). Nonetheless, it was reported that Sébastiani made use of the title for the rest of his participation in the Spanish expedition. The ''Revue'' claimed that the ducal title "of Murcia" was adopted by the General himself, after he reaped a minor victory in [[Lorca, Spain|Lorca]] and reportedly advanced a project to gain the region back from ''[[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]]'' forces (the plan was to be discarded by Sébastiani's commander, [[Nicolas Jean de Dieu Soult]]).&lt;ref name="revuemondes"/&gt;

Sébastiani is reported to have plundered a number of [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] convents during the Peninsular expedition.&lt;ref name="gentlemens"/&gt; Having stationed his troops in the [[Alhambra]],&lt;ref name="gentlemens"/&gt;&lt;ref name="revuemondes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="irving"&gt;[[Washington Irving]], "The Alhambra", in ''Bracebridge Hall, Tales of a Traveller and the Alhambra'', [[Library of America]], 1991, p.753 ("Notes", p.1101)&lt;/ref&gt; where he himself resided in noted luxury,&lt;ref name="revuemondes"/&gt; Sébastiani partly destroyed the palace's fortifications after retreating.&lt;ref name="irving"/&gt; It is argued that he was also responsible for the partial devastation of the palace's interior.&lt;ref name="gentlemens"/&gt; The American author [[Washington Irving]], who visited [[Spain]] in the following period, recounted that: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"With that enlightened taste which has ever distinguished the French nation in their conquests, this monument of [[Al-Andalus|Moorish]] elegance and grandeur was rescued from the absolute ruin and desolation that were overwhelming it. The roofs were repaired, the saloons and galleries protected from the weather, the gardens cultivated, the watercourses restored, the fountains once more made to throw up their sparkling showers; and Spain may thank her invaders for having preserved to her the most beautiful and interesting of her historical monuments."&lt;ref name="irving"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Serving during [[Napoleon's invasion of Russia]], under [[Joachim Murat|Marshal Joachim Murat]],&lt;ref name="gentlemens"/&gt; and in the [[Sixth Coalition|Campaign of 1812–1813]], he commanded a cavalry division,&lt;ref name="mullie"/&gt;&lt;ref name="massey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="haythornthwaite"/&gt; becoming noted in the battles of [[Battle of Borodino|Borodino]]&lt;ref name="massey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gentlemens"/&gt;&lt;ref name="encyclopediaamericana"/&gt; (being the first French commander to enter Moscow, but was later forced to retreat with heavy losses),&lt;ref name="mullie"/&gt; [[Battle of Bautzen|Bautzen]], [[Battle of Lützen (1813)|Lützen]], [[Battle of Leipzig|Leipzig]] (where he was wounded),&lt;ref name="mullie"/&gt; and [[Battle of Hanau|Hanau]].&lt;ref name="mullie"/&gt;&lt;ref name="massey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gentlemens"/&gt; After attempting to hold [[Cologne]],&lt;ref name="massey"/&gt; he took part in the defense of French territory, holding a command position in [[Champagne (province)|Champagne]] and organizing troops in [[Châlons-en-Champagne]].&lt;ref name="massey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gentlemens"/&gt;&lt;ref name="encyclopediaamericana"/&gt; In March, he assisted in the retaking of [[Reims]], where he faced the [[Military history of Imperial Russia|Imperial Russian Army]] troops under the command of [[Emmanuel de Saint-Priest]].&lt;ref name="massey"/&gt;

==Hundred Days and Second Restoration==

During the [[Hundred Days]], he was assigned the reviewing of legislation passed by Louis XVIII, and organized the National Guard in [[Picardy]].&lt;ref name="massey"/&gt; Sébastiani was elected to the [[Chamber of Deputies of France|Chamber]] for the [[Departments of France|department]] of [[Aisne]].&lt;ref name="massey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gentlemens"/&gt;&lt;ref name="encyclopediaamericana"/&gt; After the [[Battle of Waterloo]], he voted in favor of Napoleon's [[abdication]],&lt;ref name="revuemondes"/&gt; and, eventually, was among those assigned with negotiating a peace with the [[Seventh Coalition]] (as part of a delegation also comprising [[Benjamin Constant|Benjamin Constant de Rebecque]], the [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de La Fayette|marquis de La Fayette]], [[Marc-René de Voyer de Paulmy d'Argenson (1771-1842)|marquis d'Argenson]] and [[Louis Gustave le Doulcet, comte de Pontécoulant|comte de Pontécoulant]]).&lt;ref name="mullie"/&gt;&lt;ref name="massey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="encyclopediaamericana"/&gt; During talks, he showed himself opposed to a second [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] return.&lt;ref name="massey"/&gt;

Sébastiani spent a year in England before being allowed to return&lt;ref name="massey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gentlemens"/&gt;&lt;ref name="revuemondes"/&gt; (having retired from active service and receiving half pay).&lt;ref name="massey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gentlemens"/&gt; Starting in 1819, after being promoted by the [[Élie, duc Decazes|Duke Decazes]],&lt;ref name="massey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="revuemondes"/&gt; he was a prominent member of the [[Chamber of Deputies]], initially representing Corsica, rallying with the [[History of the Left in France|Left]].&lt;ref name="massey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gentlemens"/&gt;&lt;ref name="revuemondes"/&gt; According to the ''Revue'''s comments, his political choice was unusual, reportedly astonishing both members of the Left and the moderate Decazes, a Royalist. Inside the Chamber, he joined forces with [[Maximilien Sebastien Foy]], notably pushing projects to recognize the merits of ''[[La Grande Armée|Grande Armée]]'' veterans; a speech he held on the latter occasion, which gave praise to the [[Flag of France|French tricolor]], caused an uproar among [[Conservatism|conservative]] deputies.&lt;ref name="revuemondes"/&gt;

During the [[French legislative election, 1824]], his attempt to campaign in [[Corsica]] was frustrated by the local authorities representing the Royalist Government of [[Jean-Baptiste de Villèle]], and he subsequently won 1 out of 48 votes.&lt;ref name="massey"/&gt; Instead, after General Foy's death in late 1825, he was elected as replacement in his constituency, the [[Aisne]] town of [[Vervins]], receiving 120 votes out of 200.&lt;ref name="massey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="revuemondes"/&gt;

==July Revolution and Belgian question==

After the [[July Revolution]], he held the posts of [[List of Naval Ministers of France|Naval Minister]] under the nominal leadership of [[François Guizot]] (autumn 1830),&lt;ref name="mullie"/&gt;&lt;ref name="turnbull"/&gt;&lt;ref name="encyclopediaamericana"/&gt; and [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (France)|Foreign Affairs]] under [[Jacques Laffitte]] and [[Casimir Pierre Perier]].&lt;ref name="meyerskl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="encyclopediaamericana"/&gt; During the Revolution, he parted with the Left, and made declarations in support of [[Charles X of France|Charles X]]—including one which proclaimed that the only national flag was the white one for the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]]s.&lt;ref name="mullie"/&gt; Allegedly establishing links with the radical ''[[Aide-toi, le ciel t'aidera]]'' society in the early days of the [[July Monarchy]],&lt;ref name="revuemondes"/&gt; he subsequently rallied with the [[Centrism|centrist]] politics of the [[Orléanist]] camp.&lt;ref name="mullie"/&gt;&lt;ref name="revuemondes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rittiez"&gt;F. Rittiez, ''Histoire du règne de Louis-Philippe Ier, 1830 à 1848, précis'', Tome I, V. Lecou, Paris, 1855, p.44–45, 251–267, 268–269, 274, 280, 445&lt;/ref&gt; With [[Jacques Laffitte|Laffitte]], [[Benjamin Constant]], [[Jean-Guillaume, baron Hyde de Neuville|Jean-Guillaume Hyde de Neuville]], [[Adolphe Thiers]], and others, he played a prominent part in calling [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis-Philippe]] to the [[Line of succession to the French throne (Orléanist)|French throne]].&lt;ref name="rittiez"/&gt;

After that, the Sébastianis became the most influential faction in [[Corsica]], replacing the [[Legitimists|Legitimist]] Pozzo di Borgo family&lt;ref name="ortegalimperani"&gt;{{fr icon}} Alfredo Ortega, [http://adecec.net/adecec-net/parutions/pdf/delacorsealandalousie.pdf ''De la Corse à l'Andalousie. Joseph Antoine Limperani''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070226213656/http://www.adecec.net/adecec-net/parutions/pdf/delacorsealandalousie.pdf |date=2007-02-26 }}, hosted by [http://adecec.net/ ADECEC (Association pour le Développement des Etudes Archéologiques, Historiques, linguistiques et Naturalistes du Centre-Est de la Corse)], retrieved 5 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; — one of the latter, [[Carlo Andrea Pozzo di Borgo]], was a high-ranking Russian diplomat who negotiated with Horace Sébastiani on several occasions.

In the wake of the [[Belgian Revolution]], when candidatures were considered for the [[Monarchy of Belgium|Belgian throne]], Sébastiani  had the task of undermining support for [[Auguste de Beauharnais, 2nd Duke of Leuchtenberg|Auguste of Leuchtenberg]] and drawing allegiances for the [[Prince Louis, Duke of Nemours|Duke of Nemours]].&lt;ref name="revuemondes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rittiez"/&gt; After Nemours refused the Belgian crown, he transferred French support to [[Leopold I of Belgium|Leopold of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]], the British-backed candidate, in exchange for Leopold's agreeing to marry [[Louise-Marie of France]]. This policy was viewed as a capitulation by the Legitimists, and most notably by [[Jean Maximilien Lamarque]], who, while deploring the separation of the [[French people|French]] and the French-speaking [[Walloons]], accused Sébastiani of having obtained the destruction of fortifications in Belgium not as a concession from other states, but rather because "the allied powers want to set aside the means of entering France without running into obstacles".&lt;ref name="revuemondes"/&gt;

When the [[London Conference of 1832|London Conference]] compelled [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands|Dutch]] forces to evacuate Belgian territory, Sébastiani indicated that the French troops under [[Étienne Maurice Gérard|General Gérard]] were to remain in the area until "all reasons why the French Army has maneuvered would be dealt with resolutely, and no danger would threaten us". Nevertheless, Gérard retreated before the Conference came to an end. When Chamber called on the minister to answer about the discrepancy, he declared himself "astonished" by news of the retreat, attributing it to British pressures, and indicated that "we have entered Belgium in good will; good will is what led us to withdraw".&lt;ref name="rittiez"/&gt;

==November Uprising: early negotiations==
[[Image:Conference de londres.jpg|thumb|[[Honoré Daumier]]'s cartoon of the 1832 [[London Conference of 1832|London Conference]], with France depicted as a timid hare in front of other powers (Poland is the female figure trampled upon by Russia)]]
In late 1830, after the [[November Uprising]] broke out in [[Congress Poland]], Sébastiani, despite the revolutionaries' expectations, chose to avoid his country's involvement. As Russian troops carried out a violent intervention against the rebellion, a deputy in the [[Sejm]] lamented that Poland was perishing without having even seen a French courier; the minister responded to similar accusations at home by stating that France was determined not to raise the anger of [[List of Russian rulers|Emperor]] [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas]].&lt;ref name="revuemondes"/&gt; Nevertheless, some time after the Uprising erupted, Sébastiani received Polish envoys with sympathy, and had felt secure that "a friendly arrangement with Russia" could be achieved. To this end, he sent a mission to [[Saint Petersburg]], which attempted to mediate an understanding between the Polish revolutionaries and Russia; in order to undermine communications between France and Poland, the government of [[Viktor Kochubey]] took the decision of recognizing the July Monarchy, which it had refused to do until then. In January 1831, after pressures from the [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de La Fayette|Marquis de La Fayette]], [[Casimir-Louis-Victurnien de Rochechouart de Mortemart|the Duke of Mortemart]] was dispatched to Russia in order to seek a new agreement—his mission was made ineffectual by the revolutionaries' decision to dethrone Nicholas from his position as [[List of Polish monarchs|King of Poland]], which in turn led to a standoff between all sides involved.&lt;ref name="gnorowski"/&gt;

In parallel, Sébastiani allegedly approved the designs of [[Armand Charles Guilleminot]], the [[French Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire|Ambassador to The Porte]], who attempted to undermine the [[Holy Alliance]] by stressing that Russian actions in Poland and the [[Balkans]] could rally opposition from [[Austrian Empire|Austria]], the Ottoman Empire and the United Kingdom. Guilleminot ultimately presented the Ottomans with an offer to back an independent Poland—as a consequence, Foreign Minister Sébastiani was formally asked by [[Carlo Andrea Pozzo di Borgo]] to recall the ambassador, and he ultimately agreed to do so.&lt;ref name="revuemondes"/&gt;

Historian [[Barthélemy Hauréau]] indicated that the moderate path pursued by Sébastiani had been largely responsible for convincing [[Jan Zygmunt Skrzynecki]] to postpone military operations, to the point where it was later contended that the [[Minister (government)|minister]] was plotting with Russian authorities. He referred to Sébastiani's position as "a miserable role", and to his correspondence with the Poles as "perfidious epistles".&lt;ref name="haureau"&gt;[[Barthélemy Hauréau]], ''Histoire de la Pologne depuis son origine jusqu'en 1846'', Pagnerre, Paris, 1846, p.204–205&lt;/ref&gt;

==November Uprising: aftermath==
[[Image:L` ordre regne a Varsovie 1831.PNG|thumb|''Order reigns in Warsaw'', cartoon by [[Jean Ignace Isidore Gérard|J. J. Grandville]], 1831]]
When Poland was ultimately pacified, Sébastiani uttered the famous words: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Order reigns in [[Warsaw]]."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The statement itself was not rendered verbatim by the ''[[Le Moniteur Universel|Moniteur]]'', allegedly due to their potential for causing scandal.&lt;ref name="rittiez"/&gt; As Sébastiani's words began circulating freely, public opinion considered them evidence of callousness, and, in December, they were used by [[Jean Ignace Isidore Gérard|J. J. Grandville]] as title for a cartoon showing the effects of repression in [[Congress Poland]]. Another of Grandville's drawings, depicting the authorities' violent response to public manifestations of support for Polish revolutionaries, was titled ''Public Order Reigns Also in Paris'' (sold together, the two works caused the artist to be [[Censorship|censored]] and his house to be raided by policemen).&lt;ref name="goldstein"&gt;Robert Justin Goldstein, ''Censorship of Political Caricature in Nineteenth-Century France'', [[Kent State University Press]], Kent, 1989, p.143&lt;/ref&gt; It was also contended that the statement had been made by Sébastiani with the specific goal of persuading Russia that France did not condemn the intervention — reportedly, Emperor Nicholas normalized relations with France and received its ambassador, the [[Édouard Adolphe Casimir Joseph Mortier|Duke of Trévise]], only after hearing news of Sébastiani's speech.&lt;ref name="revuemondes"/&gt;

Later, he justified himself in front of the Chamber by arguing that intervention in Poland was doomed to failure, noting that a French landing on Poland's [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] shore was made impossible by both distance and the minor scale of facilities in [[Palanga|Polangen]].&lt;ref name="revuemondes"/&gt; When interpellated in the Chamber, he also contended that France had managed to obtain consensus that Russia was to maintain a degree of Polish autonomy, as these had been stipulated by the 1814–1814&lt;!-- are these years really both supposed to be the same? --&gt; [[Congress of Vienna]].&lt;ref name="rittiez"/&gt; Reflecting upon public sentiment at a time when [[Radicalism (historical)|Radicalism]] had become a European phenomenon, he was also quoted saying:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"There are those who want to drag us into a war of opinions, to dump us into an apparent alliance of peoples versus governments; we ask them with what right do they pretend to attribute themselves or assign us the mission of revolutionizing all the peoples. We know their goal and their secret thought. These people work to bring disruptions on the inside through disruptions on the outside. What they want, we avoid; what they fear, we seek. In the absence of set rules of conduct, their exhortations, their fears and their joys would suffice for shedding light on our path and making us perceive the abysses where they would like to throw us."&lt;ref name="revuemondes"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{wikisource|Declaration of Horace Sébastiani in French Chamber of Deputies about situation in Poland (1831)|Declaration of Horace Sébastiani in French Chamber of Deputies about situation in Poland (1831)}}

During a Chamber session in September 1831, the [[Liberalism and radicalism in France|liberal]] [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de La Fayette|Marquis de La Fayette]] publicly accused the Laffitte cabinet in general and Sébastiani in particular of having secretly encouraged the Poles while persuading them to delay their attack on Russian troops (allegedly promising that France would give them official backing following that moment, and later forfeiting the pledge). La Fayette also stressed that it was possible for France to sanction Polish independence, especially since the [[Holy Alliance]] appeared to have been divided on the issue. According to [[Karl Marx]], when Sébastiani defended his ministry and stressed that he had not made Poland any promises, the Marquis confronted him with a letter signed by [[Karol Kniaziewicz]], dated September 1830, which contained references to Sébastiani's guarantees and his call to postpone the offensive.&lt;ref name="marxminutebook"&gt;[[Karl Marx]], [http://www.marxists.org/history/international/iwma/documents/1864/poland-note.htm "Note for Draft of Speech by Marx on France's Attitude to Poland"], at [[Marxists Internet Archive]], retrieved 5 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Revue des Deux Mondes]]'' recounted that the diplomat [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord|Talleyrand]] and Sébastiani both maintained an independent line in politics—their secretive notes reportedly contributed to the fall of the Laffitte government.&lt;ref name="revuemondes"/&gt;

==Périer Cabinet==
Over the following year, he and [[List of Prime Ministers of France|Prime Minister]] [[Casimir Pierre Périer|Périer]] were called upon by the Marquis de La Fayette to express disapproval for [[reactionary]] politics in the [[Austrian Empire]], and to allow [[Italians|Italian]] [[Carbonari]] refugees such as [[Cristina Trivulzio di Belgiojoso]] to remain on French territory. La Fayette noted that Sébastiani had undertaken:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"efforts to revoke and prevent the sequestration [of property] that was inflicted [by Austria] on the Italian men and women who are traveling in France."&lt;ref name="kramerlafayette"&gt;Lloyd S. Kramer, ''Lafayette in Two Worlds: Public Cultures and Personal Identities in an Age of Revolution'', [[University of North Carolina Press]], Chapel Hill, 1996, p.174–176&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In February 1832, Sébastiani took initiative in ordering a French occupation of [[Ancona]]. The ''Revue'' argued that this was the most significant gesture of his career, and credited him with having planned it as an indirect but effective strike at Austrian economic interests, when implying that France would march into Rome and [[Trieste]] in the event of a war with Austria.

Among his last actions in office as Foreign Minister were negotiations with the United States over losses suffered by American citizens during the Napoleon's [[Continental System|Continental Blockade]], when several ships bearing the American flag were arrested in European ports, on suspicion that they were in fact serving British commercial interests (''see [[Embargo Act of 1807]]''). Raising much controversy, he set the sum France agreed to pay at 25 million [[French franc|francs]], 10 million more than what committees of the ''[[Council of State (France)|Conseil d'État]]'' and Chamber had decided, although still significantly less than what had been asked by American plaintiffs.&lt;ref name="revuemondes"/&gt;

It was during the same period that Sébastiani remarried, to Aglaé-Angélique-Gabrielle de Gramont, one of [[Antoine-Geneviève-Héraclius-Agénor de Gramont|Héraclius, duc de Gramont]]'s daughters and the widow of the Russian General [[:fr:Alexandre Lvovitch Davydov|Count Alexander Davidoff]].&lt;ref name="raikes"&gt;[[Thomas Raikes]], ''A Portion of the Journal Kept by Thomas Raikes, Esq., from 1831 to 1847'', Vol. II, Longman, Brown, Green etc., London, 1856, p.40&lt;/ref&gt; He retired from office after suffering a [[stroke]] which left him partly paralyzed, and traveled in the [[Italian Peninsula]]. He was later [[Minister of State]] for a short period of time.&lt;ref name="revuemondes"/&gt;

==Later years==
[[Image:SebastianiMarshal.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Marshal of France|Marshal]] Sébastiani in full dress uniform, portrait by [[Franz Xaver Winterhalter]], 1841]]
In 1833, Sébastiani was ambassador to the [[Two Sicilies]], and in 1835–1840, to the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]].&lt;ref name="gentlemens"/&gt;&lt;ref name="raikes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="regnault"&gt;[[Adolphe Thiers]], "Lettre aux électeurs d'Aix", in [[Élias Regnault]], ''Révolution française. Histoire de huit ans, 1840–1848'', Pagnerre, Paris, 1852, p.119, 121&lt;/ref&gt; He was recalled and replaced by [[François Guizot]] after refusing, against his government wishes, to support the cause of [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]]'s design to extend his rule out of the [[Egypt under Muhammad Ali and his successors|Egyptian realm]] by conquering Ottoman lands in [[Syria Province, Ottoman Empire|Syria]] (''see [[London Straits Convention]]''). [[Adolphe Thiers]] later pointed out that he agreed with Sébastiani's view, which he defined as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The apprehension [...] over seeing France engaging in the [[Decline of the Ottoman Empire|Oriental question]], to find herself the only one of that opinion, and from that moment on to be reduced to the alternative of either ceding or risk a universal war over an object that was not worth it [...]."&lt;ref name="regnault"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During the ministerial crisis provoked by the fall of the [[Nicolas Jean de Dieu Soult]] cabinet, before Thiers' nomination, Sébastiani was considered for the office of Premier; his failure to gain the position was attributed to rejection from all political camps, based on the view that he was overtly subservient to King Louis-Philippe.&lt;ref name="rittiez"/&gt;

He was made [[Marshal of France]] in 1840,&lt;ref name="gentlemens"/&gt;&lt;ref name="haythornthwaite"/&gt; replacing the deceased [[Nicolas Joseph Maison]],&lt;ref name="mullie"/&gt; and represented [[Ajaccio]] in the Chamber for several terms.&lt;ref name="meyerskl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ortegalimperani"/&gt; He became a [[Peerage of France|Peer of France]] in 1842. The ''[[Revue des Deux Mondes]]''' [[François Buloz]] announced, in April 1835, that [[:fr:Tiburce Sébastiani|Vicomte Tiburce Sébastiani]] was involved in heated disputes with other public figures, over repeated allegations that his brother had harmed French interests in the American creditors' affair. In this and other cases of the period, the same controversy almost erupted into [[duel]]s.&lt;ref name="bulozrevuechronique"/&gt;

Having largely retired from public life, he had his last years clouded by the 1847 death of his sole daughter from his first marriage, Fanny, duchess of Choiseul-Praslin.&lt;ref name="fisquet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lebrigand"&gt;{{fr icon}} Brigitte-Marie Le Brigand, [http://www.historia.presse.fr/data/mag/704/70400301.html "Choiseul-Praslin: les pièces à conviction"]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, in ''Historia'', Nr.704, retrieved 5 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vella"&gt;Christina Vella, ''Intimate Enemies: The Two Worlds of the Baroness de Pontalba'', [[Louisiana State University Press]], Baton Rouge, 1997, p.138&lt;/ref&gt; Fanny had married [[Charles de Choiseul-Praslin|Charles, duc de Praslin]], in 1825.&lt;ref&gt;Henry James Gabriel de Milleville, ''Armorial historique de la noblesse de France'', Bureau de l'Armorial Historique, Paris, 1845, p.67&lt;/ref&gt; In what was one of the most famous murders of the 19th century,&lt;ref name="vella"/&gt; the duchess had been stabbed repeatedly and with noted violence. For long before her death, Fanny had accused Charles de Choiseul-Praslin of having cheated on her and of having separated her from her children.&lt;ref name="lebrigand"/&gt; Her killing was thought to be a consequence of the Duke's plan to run away with their children's [[governess]].&lt;ref name="lebrigand"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vella"/&gt; Arrested and waiting to be tried by the Court of Peers, Choiseul-Praslin was released on [[parole]], only to commit suicide on 24 August 1847; shortly before his death, he denied all charges.&lt;ref name="lebrigand"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vella"/&gt; This event played a part in bringing about the [[Revolutions of 1848 in France|1848 Revolution]], after public opinion began speculating that aristocrats had allowed one of their own to take his own life rather than face trial,&lt;ref name="lebrigand"/&gt; or even that Choiseul-Praslin had been allowed to escape.&lt;ref name="fisquet"/&gt; As a parallel result, the 1848 events brought an end to the Sébastianis' influence in [[Corsica]], especially after Tiburce Sébastiani chose to retire to his domain in [[Olmeta-di-Tuda]].&lt;ref name="ortegalimperani"/&gt;

Four years later, Sébastiani died suddenly while having breakfast. His funeral service was held at [[Les Invalides]] and attended by [[List of Presidents of the French Republic|President]] [[Napoleon III, Emperor of the French|Charles-Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte]] among other officials of the [[Second French Republic|Second Republic]].&lt;ref name="gentlemens"/&gt;

==Legacy==
Horace Sébastiani's name is inscribed on the western side of the [[Arc de Triomphe]].&lt;ref name="mullie"/&gt; An avenue in [[Bastia]] was named in his honor (''Avenue Maréchal Sébastiani'').

In 1938, [[Rachel Field]] published her ''[[All This and Heaven Too]]'', a novel which centers on the killing of Sébastiani's daughter. The 1940 drama film of the same starred [[Barbara O'Neil]] as Fanny, [[Charles Boyer]] as De Choiseul-Praslin, and [[Bette Davis]] as Henriette Deluzy-Desportes, the governess. Sébastiani is portrayed by [[Montagu Love]].&lt;ref name="allthisimdb"&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032194/ ''All This and Heaven Too''] at the [[Internet Movie Database]], retrieved 5 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Sébastiani is also one of the protagonists in [[Prince Michael of Greece and Denmark|Prince Michael of Greece]]'s novel ''[[The Favorite|Sultana - La Nuit du Sérail]]'', which depicts fictionalized events of [[Selim III]]'s rule. In 1989, the story was later turned into an American-[[Switzerland|Swiss]] film co-production: titled ''[[The Favorite]]'' (or ''La Nuit du Sérail''), it starred [[:fr:Laurent Le Doyen|Laurent Le Doyen]] as Sébastiani.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097341/ ''The Favorite''] at the [[Internet Movie Database]], retrieved 5 May 2007&lt;br/&gt;{{de icon}} [http://www.films.pierre-marteau.com/hist_filme/1989_usa_favoritin.html ''The Favorite'', at ''The Marteau Encyclopedia of the Early Modern Period''], retrieved 5 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11730">The '''Human Fly''' is the name of two fictional characters appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. One is a [[super-villain]] that was an occasional [[antagonist]] of [[Spider-Man]], and the other a [[superhero]]. Additionally, ''Human Fly'' was the title of a short-lived series in the late 1950s reprinting some of [[Fox Feature Syndicate|Fox]]'s [[Blue Beetle]] strips from the 1940s. It was published by Super Comics.

Richard Deacon, born in [[Newark, New Jersey]], was a small-time criminal who was shot by the police and left for dead after an unsuccessful kidnapping attempt which was foiled by [[Spider-Man]]. Stumbling into the laboratory of Dr. Harlan Stillwell (whose brother [[Farley Stillwell]] created the [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]] for [[J. Jonah Jameson]]), Deacon coerces the scientist into saving his life. Overhearing an offer Jameson made with Stillwell to fund the creation of a new superhero, Deacon insists he be the subject of the experiment. Stillwell imprints the genetic coding of a [[housefly]] onto Deacon, empowering him and healing him of his bullet wounds. Deacon then kills Harlan Stillwell after he served his purpose and uses his newfound powers to further his criminal ambitions. He first uses Jameson as bait to get revenge on Spider-Man. Due to his inexperience, the Fly is no match for him and is defeated.&lt;ref&gt;''Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #10&lt;/ref&gt;

Some time later, the Fly begins to display fly-like tendencies like eating garbage.&lt;ref name="SpecSp86"&gt;''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #86&lt;/ref&gt; He also develops physical mutations, including [[facet eyes]].&lt;ref name="SW30"&gt;''Spider-Woman'' #30&lt;/ref&gt; The Fly attacks Spider-Man after [[Spencer Smythe]] handcuffed him—along with Jameson—to a bomb. The Fly hurls the two from a rooftop and leaves them for dead. Once freed from the shackle, Spider-Man tries to stop the Fly from stealing an art exhibit, but the villain knocks him down and escapes. Soon afterwards, the police catch the Fly using [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] equipment.&lt;ref&gt;''Amazing Spider-Man'' #192–193&lt;/ref&gt;

Traveling to [[Los Angeles]], the Fly seeks out Dr. [[Karl Malus]], who confirms that his powers are fading and he will soon be powerless. Malus recommends that he get a new set of powers using a blood transfusion from another superbeing, which would most conveniently be the locally operating [[Jessica Drew|Spider-Woman]]. With his powers already at less than a third their usual strength, however, he is unable to defeat her and is apprehended. Afterwards, Malus uses some of the Fly's DNA to temporarily mutate Scotty McDowell into the similarly powered [[Hornet (comics)#Hornet (Scotty McDowell)|Hornet]].&lt;ref name="SW30"/&gt;

The Fly is freed from prison and his powers restored by untold means. He subsequently battles [[Moon Knight]], leaving the hero temporarily paralyzed, and again seeks revenge against Jameson and Spider-Man.&lt;ref&gt;''Moon Knight'' #35&lt;/ref&gt; Partnered with the [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]], Spider-Man once more defeats the Fly.&lt;ref name="SpecSp86" /&gt;

Over time, Deacon's mutation increases. After escaping from a mental institution, Deacon is killed by a [[Scourge of the Underworld]] (who was disguised as a sanitation worker) while trying to take revenge on Spider-Man.&lt;ref&gt;''Amazing Spider-Man'' #276&lt;/ref&gt;

The Human Fly is among the eighteen criminals that were murdered by Scourge of the Underworld to be resurrected by [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] using the power of [[Dormammu]] as part of a squad assembled to eliminate the [[Punisher]].&lt;ref&gt;''Punisher'' (vol. 7) #5&lt;/ref&gt; He now has acidic vomit that can melt steel and wings strong enough to deflect cannon fire and sharp enough to cut a dump truck in two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/preview2.php?image=previews/marvelcomics/punisher/villains/PunisherVillains-7.jpg |title=Comic Book Resources |publisher=Comic Book Resources |date=2014-06-11 |accessdate=2015-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fly, now craving human flesh, devours a prostitute in a private room, and then fights a group of armed guards who burst in, vomiting deadly acid on them. When he assaults another woman in the hallway, the Punisher confronts him.&lt;ref&gt;''Punisher'' (vol. 7) #7&lt;/ref&gt; Punisher uses his knife to cut one of Human Fly's wings in half. A group of his fellow criminals (disguised as Avengers from another time and place) intervene as [[Bird-Man#Achille DiBacco|Bird-Man]] manages to get the Human Fly to safety. His wing regenerates rather quickly.&lt;ref&gt;''Punisher'' (vol. 7) #8&lt;/ref&gt; He battles the Punisher again with Letha and Lascivious, and is defeated when the Punisher throws him into Lascivious.&lt;ref&gt;''Punisher'' (vol. 7) #9&lt;/ref&gt;

The Human Fly is apprehended by [[Agent Venom]],&lt;ref&gt;''Venom'' (vol. 2) #5 (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; but he is able to escape a prisoner transport to the Raft when the [[Phil Urich|Hobgoblin]] attacks the transport trying to kill the Human Fly for stealing money from the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]].&lt;ref&gt;''Venom'' (vol. 2) #16&lt;/ref&gt; Human Fly is later recruited by the third [[Crime Master]] to become a member of his [[Savage Six]].&lt;ref&gt;''Venom'' (vol. 2) #17&lt;/ref&gt;

He is then hired by [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]] and [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Owl]] to become a member of the [[Sinister Six]]teen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic

The second Human Fly was a young man of unknown identity who was severely injured during a car crash. After a long hospitalization, including a number of reconstructive surgeries in which much of his skeleton was replaced by steel, he took on the masked identity of the Human Fly. As the Human Fly, he performed daredevil stunts to benefit various charities, especially those helping children with disabilities.

His activities often drew him into conflict with criminals, who were often seeking to rob the charity events at which he performed. Additionally, he drew the attention of [[Spider-Man]], who thought he might be the villain of the same name.

The character was based on real-life [[stunt performer|stuntman]] [[Rick Rojatt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-rocketman.com/human-fly.html |title=The Rocketman Online Store |publisher=The-rocketman.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The comic book carried the tag line "The Wildest Super-Hero Ever&amp;nbsp;– Because He's Real!", and photographs of someone in a Human Fly costume appeared in the books. [[Jim Shooter]], a high-ranking member of Marvel's editorial staff at the time of publication, said in 2007 that the photos were indeed of Rojatt.&lt;ref&gt;Shooter, Jim. ''Back Issue'' #20 (Jan. 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
The Richard Deacon version of Human Fly has the abilities of flight, wall-crawling, and superhuman strength and agility. He also has compound eyes. Following his revival at the hands of Hood, Human Fly now has acid vomit that can melt steel and wings that are strong enough to deflect cannon fire and sharp enough to cut a dump truck in two. The wings soon regenerate if they are torn off.

The superhero version of Human Fly had 60% of his bone structure replaced by steel, which allows him to withstand any injury that normal humans cannot endure. He is also a master aerialist, stuntman, hand-to-hand combatant and gymnast, and uses specialized gadgets that help him in his performances, depending on the stunt.

==In other media==
===Television===
* In the ''[[Spider-Woman (TV series)|Spider-Woman]]'' episode "Spider-Woman and the Fly", a crazed scientist named Dr. Hagel became a giant fly. The Fly was able to find out [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]]'s alter-ego. However, when he was turned back to normal, he forgot everything about Spider-Woman's true identity.
* The super-villain Human Fly made a cameo appearance on the ''[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]'' episode "Attack of the Arachnoid". He was seen as an inmate in Ryker's Island with [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]], [[Klaw (Marvel Comics)|Klaw]], and [[Blastaar]].

===Film===
* An [[independent film]] based on the superhero Human Fly is in development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Patten |first=Dominic |url=http://deadline.com/2012/06/human-fly-superhero-movie-in-development-292695/ |title=Human Fly' Superhero Movie In Development |publisher=Deadline |date=2012-06-27 |accessdate=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5673">'''Ian Parry''' (12 April 1965 &amp;ndash; 28 December 1989) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] photographer and photojournalist who worked as a freelance and on assignment for newspapers including ''[[The Mail on Sunday]]'', ''[[The Times]]'' and ''[[The Sunday Times]]''. He was killed at the age of 24 in an aircraft crash in [[Romania]] during the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|overthrow of Communism]]. In his honour a scholarship fund was set up to encourage and help young photographers.

==Early life==
Parry was the youngest of four children, and was born and brought up in [[Prestatyn]] in north [[Wales]]. He attended Penmorfa County Primary and Prestatyn High Schools, and his interest in photography began while he was very young: by the age of 13 he had learned to develop and print his own film using a darkroom set up by his uncle. He took photographs of people staying at the nearby [[Pontin's]] holiday camp during the summer holidays while still at school. Parry left school at the age of 16 and was taken on by the local newspaper ''Rhyl Journal'' as a trainee photographer; the editor Brian Barratt later praised his "nose for a good news picture".&lt;ref name="Pictures"&gt;Margarette Driscoll, "Newsman's memorial: his pictures", ''Sunday Times'', 31 December 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional life==
After studying at the [[National Council for the Training of Journalists]] at [[Sheffield College]],&lt;ref name="About"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ianparry.org/main/?page_id=12 |title=About Ian Parry |publisher=Ian Parry Scholarship Fund |accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the age of 21 Parry joined the national newspaper ''Mail on Sunday''. He later worked for both ''The Times'' and ''The Sunday Times''.&lt;ref name="Memorial service"&gt;"Mr Ian Parry: Memorial service", ''The Times'', 31 January 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; He worked with the Chief Reporter of ''Mail on Sunday'', Barbara Jones, on a front-page story about the personal life of Sonia Sutcliffe (wife of murderer [[Peter Sutcliffe]]).&lt;ref&gt;Robin Young, "Ripper's wife loses libel case and faces costs of £300,000", ''The Times'', 22 December 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 1989|1989 Conservative leadership election]], Parry followed the challenger [[Anthony Meyer|Sir Anthony Meyer]] (his local MP) throughout his challenge, photographing him throughout each day; Meyer was impressed with Parry's ability to get access to events and regarded him as "a constant and welcome companion".&lt;ref&gt;"Ian Parry", ''The Times'', 30 December 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
When an uprising against the government of [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] broke out in [[Romania]] in December 1989, Parry was working for ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' and argued that he should be sent on assignment to cover events there.&lt;ref name="Crash"&gt;Geoff King, "Photographer dies in plane crash", ''The Times'', 29 December 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; He spent several days in [[Bucharest]] taking pictures of the city recovering after  Ceaușescu was overthrown, photographing soldiers with flowers in their arms, as well as funerals for people killed in the revolution.&lt;ref name="Pictures" /&gt; On 28 December he was returning to Britain and managed to find a place on an [[Antonov An-24]] airliner operated by [[TAROM]] that was travelling out of Bucharest to [[Belgrade]] to pick up relief supplies. He took with him the undeveloped film from other photographers. The aircraft crashed near [[Găeşti]], 43 miles west of Bucharest, killing all on board.&lt;ref name="Crash" /&gt; An inquest in November 1990 returned an initial verdict of accidental death.&lt;ref&gt;"Parry inquest", ''The Sunday Times'', 18 November 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Although to this day the investigation has not been officially closed, the most plausible explanation is that the plane was actually shot down by a surface-to-air missile.&lt;ref name="About Ian Parry"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ianparry.org/about-ian-parry/| title=The Ian Parry Scholarship |accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A memorial service for Parry was held at [[St Bride's Church]] in [[Fleet Street]] on 30 January 1990.&lt;ref name="Memorial service" /&gt; A photograph by Parry of the funeral of a young Romanian killed in the revolution won the Nikon Press Photograph of the Month for January 1990; the picture editor of the [[Press Association]] selected it as the winner because "it summed up better than anything the whole story of Romania and the terrible legacy of sadness inflicted on ordinary Romanians by the Ceaușescus".&lt;ref&gt;Margarette Driscoll, "Parry photograph wins press award", ''The Sunday Times'', 4 February 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarship==
After Parry's death, the Picture Editor of ''The Sunday Times'' Aidan Sullivan worked with Parry's family and friends and set up the Ian Parry Scholarship Fund.&lt;ref name="Scholarship"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ianparry.org/main/?page_id=2 |title=The Scholarship |publisher=Ian Parry Scholarship Fund |accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fund announced in September 1990 that it would offer photographers aged up to 24 funding of £1,000 plus a further £1,000 for equipment to cover a foreign assignment of their choice.&lt;ref&gt;"Ian Parry photography award", ''The Sunday Times'', 9 September 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jane Osti''' is a native [[Cherokee]] artist from [[Tahlequah, Oklahoma]], United States. She specializes in traditional Cherokee pottery with unique embellishments and designs. In 2005, Osti was one of the youngest Cherokee artists to be appointed as a Living Treasure by [[Cherokee Nation]]. Currently, Osti teaches and creates her own pottery in her studio in downtown Tahlequah.

==Early life==
Osti was born in the Rocky Ford area of Tahlequah. Osti's father started out as a miner and in the later half of his life he raised cattle and was a rancher. Her Cherokee mother died when she was 5 years old. Osti did not have much exposure to art until she lived alone. She participated in art class in fourth and fifth grade but did not have any other opportunities outside of that. Osti attended Oaks Mission High School.&lt;ref name="Oral History" /&gt;

===Education===
Osti was married and started a family and did not start college classes until she was 33, when she took classes at a community college in [[San Francisco]]. In 1985, Osti moved back to [[Tahlequah, Oklahoma|Tahlequah]] and took the rest of her classes at [[Northeastern State University]]. Osti finished her Bachelor of Arts in Art in 1989 and continued on to her master's at NSU immediately after. She graduated with her Master's of Science in Education in 1992.&lt;ref name="Linked in profile"&gt;{{cite web|title=Artist/Educator at Jane Osti Art|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pub/jane-osti/a/326/458|website=linkedin.com|publisher=Linked In|accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction into art==
The classes that Osti took with professor Jerry Choate were influential for her later career as a 3-dimmensional artist. After finishing her first pottery class and while taking a Cherokee history course, Osti decided to interview [http://www.clayhound.us/gallery/117.htm Anna Mitchell] for a paper. Mitchell soon became Osti's teacher, mentor, and friend. During this time, Osti switched her focus from the 2-dimensional to the 3-dimensional and really fell in love with pottery.&lt;ref name="Oral History" /&gt;

===Style and notable works===
Osti's work draws from ancient Mississippian culture and [[prehistoric]] southeastern woodland.&lt;ref name="indian craft shop"&gt;{{cite web|title=Artist Bio: Jane Osti (Cherokee)|url=http://www.indiancraftshop.com/ARTIST_bios/artist-bio-Jane-Osti-Cherokee.htm|website=indiancraftshop.com|publisher=The Indian Craft Shop|accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Osti specializes in coil and slab construction, stone polishing, as well as glazing, and raku-firing. The images typically convey abstract animals and landscape with symbols of celestial activity, protection, and endurance.&lt;ref name="Lovetts Gallery"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lovetts Gallery: Jane Osti|url=http://www.lovettsgallery.com/artists/artist.asp?ArtistID=15|website=lovettsgallery.com|publisher=Lovetts Gallery|accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and achievements==
Osti has won awards at many exhibitions, including awards from:
* [[Santa Fe Indian Market]] 
* [[Five Civilized Tribes Museum]]
* Red Earth Indian Arts Festival

In 2005, Osti was one of the youngest Cherokee artists to be designated a Living Treasure by Cherokee Nation.&lt;ref name="Oral History"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pearson-Little Thunder|first1=Julie|title=Oral history interview with Jane Osti|journal=Oklahoma Native Artists|date=May 2, 2011|url=http://dc.library.okstate.edu/cdm/ref/collection/Spot/id/432|accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Rollin Ridge''' ([[Cherokee]] name: '''Cheesquatalawny''', or '''Yellow Bird''',&lt;ref name="newgeorgia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?path=/Literature/Fiction/Authors&amp;id=h-508|title=John Rollin Ridge (1827-1867)|work=New Georgia Encyclopedia  |accessdate=September 20, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; March 19, 1827 &amp;ndash; October 5, 1867), a member of the [[Cherokee Nation (19th century)|Cherokee Nation]], is considered the first [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] novelist.

==Biography==
Born in [[New Echota]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], he was the son of [[John Ridge]], and the grandson of [[Major Ridge]], both of whom were signatories to the [[Treaty of New Echota]], which Congress affirmed in early 1836, ceding [[Cherokee]] lands east of the [[Mississippi River]] and ultimately leading to the [[Cherokee removal|Trail of Tears]]. At the age of twelve, Ridge witnessed his father's death at the hands of supporters of Cherokee leader [[John Ross (Cherokee chief)|John Ross]], who had vehemently opposed the treaty. His mother, Sarah Bird Northrup (a white woman), took him and fled to [[Fayetteville, Arkansas]]. In 1843, he was sent to the [[Great Barrington School]] in [[Great Barrington, Massachusetts]] for two years, after which he returned to Fayetteville to study law.&lt;ref name="encycIndians"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://college.hmco.com/history/readerscomp/naind/html/na_033200_ridgejohnrol.htm |title=Ridge, John Rollin (Yellow Bird)|work=Encyclopedia of North American Indians  |accessdate=February 23, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060212224518/http://college.hmco.com/history/readerscomp/naind/html/na_033200_ridgejohnrol.htm |archivedate = February 12, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during this period that his first known writing appeared in print. He published a poem, "To a Thunder Cloud," in the ''Arkansas State Gazette''.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Fraser. "Yellow Bird and the Thunder: On Finding the Earliest Known Poem by John Rollin Ridge, the First Native American Novelist." ''Common-place''. 14.4 (2014). http://www.common-place.org/vol-14/no-04/tales/#.VNU_6NLF-So&lt;/ref&gt; He married Elizabeth Wilson, a white woman, in 1847. They had one daughter, Alice, in 1848.

In 1849, he killed Ross sympathizer David Kell, whom he thought had been involved with his father's assassination, over a horse dispute.&lt;ref name="newgeorgia"/&gt; Despite having a good argument for [[right of self-defense|self-defense]], he fled to [[Missouri]] to avoid prosecution.&lt;ref name="union2003"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theunion.com/article/20031101/OPINION/111010052&amp;parentprofile=search|title=The legendary life of John Rollin Ridge|last=Somerville|first=Richard|date=November 1, 2003|work=The Union|accessdate=24 June 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813182758/http://www.theunion.com/article/20031101/OPINION/111010052%26parentprofile%3Dsearch|archivedate=13 August 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, he joined in the [[California Gold Rush]], but disliked being a [[mining|miner]].&lt;ref name="encycIndians"/&gt; While there, he was reunited with his wife and daughter.&lt;ref name="union2005"&gt;{{cite news|title=The California Bandit and Yellow Bird|url=http://www.theunion.com/article/20050917/TODAYSFEATURE/109170135|first=Gary|last=Noy|date=September 17, 2005|work=The Union}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His writing career began with poetry (published posthumously)&lt;ref name="encycIndians"/&gt; and essays for the [[Democratic Party of the United States|Democratic Party]] before what is now considered the first Native American novel and the first novel written in California, ''[[The Life and Adventures of Joaquin Murieta]]: The Celebrated California Bandit'' (1854).&lt;ref name="newgeorgia"/&gt; A fictionalized version of the notorious bandit's story, the tale describes a young [[Mexico|Mexican]] who comes to California to seek his fortune during the Gold Rush and turns to crime after his wife is raped and his brother murdered by white men. This novel, which condemned American racism especially towards Mexicans, later inspired the [[Zorro]] stories.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} Although widely popular, Ridge saw no money from the book's publication—by the time of his death it had not yet even turned a profit.&lt;ref name="learner"/&gt;

Ridge was a writer and the first editor of the ''[[Sacramento Bee]]'' and also wrote for the ''[[San Francisco Herald]]'', among other publications.&lt;ref name="newgeorgia"/&gt; As an editor, he advocated [[Cultural assimilation|assimilationist]] policies for American Indians as his father had, placing his trust in the federal government to protect their rights. At the same time, however, he was blind to the ways in which those rights were continually abused by the same government.&lt;ref name="encycIndians"/&gt; Despite his novel's stance against racism, Ridge had owned slaves on his Arkansas property&lt;ref name="newgeorgia"/&gt; and felt that California Indians were inferior to those of other tribes.&lt;ref name="union2005"/&gt; During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Ridge openly supported the "[[Copperhead (politics)|Copperheads]]" and opposed both the election of [[Abraham Lincoln]] as well as the signing of the [[Emancipation Proclamation]], blaming the war on [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]]s.&lt;ref name="encycIndians"/&gt;

After the war, Ridge was invited by the federal government to head the Southern Cherokee delegation in postwar treaty proceedings. Despite his best efforts, the Cherokee region was not admitted as a state to the Union.&lt;ref name="encycIndians"/&gt; In December 1866, he returned to his home in [[Grass Valley, California]], where he died of "brain fever" (''[[Encephalitis lethargica]]'') on October 5, 1867.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nativeamericannetroots.net/diary/827 " American Indian Biography: John Rollin Ridge, Cherokee Writer."] Posted by Ojibwa on Native American Netroots,  January 4, 2011. Retrieved July 9, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was buried at Greenwood Memorial Park in Grass Valley.&lt;ref&gt;{{Find a Grave | name=John Rollin Ridge | grid=9426217 | author=Alice Huitt Preston | date=4 September 2004 | accessdate=2 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Life and Adventures of Joaquin Murieta''==
{{See also|The Life and Adventures of Joaquin Murieta}}
Ridge's novel, one of the earliest by a Native American author, is curious both because it is written not about a Native American subject, but about a Mexican immigrant, and because it is not original but based on a legendary figure widely discussed in the media of the day. Ridge presents the figure of [[Joaquin Murieta]] as that of a young, innocent and industrious man who is hampered in his attempts to be successful in the United States by the racism of the people and by the 1850 Foreign Miner's Tax Law, which severely hampered the ability of Latinos to mine for gold. Ridge's version of Murieta becomes a bandit who attracts a large number of associates and who terrorizes the state of California for several months with his gruesome acts of violence. At the same time, Ridge's Murieta is a romantic figure, often showing kindness (especially to women) and relishing the stories about him, even as he keeps his identity so well secret that he can walk through town in broad daylight with no one recognizing him.

Although the novel is fictional, many people took it as fact and some historians even cited it when writing biographical materials on Murrieta.&lt;ref name="learner"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.learner.org/amerpass/unit05/authors-8.html|title=John Rollin Ridge (Yellow Bird) (1827-1867)|work=American Passages: A Literary Survey  |accessdate=February 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Miguel Román''', is a research physical scientist with the [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)]]. A major focus of Román's work is the quantification of uncertainty in long-term satellite measurements of the Earth's surface at both moderate and high spatial resolutions. Román has developed a combination of global quality assessment and validation techniques that include visible, near-infrared, and multi-angular imagery and measurements acquired from in-situ and airborne platforms. His efforts to improve narrowband reflectance anisotropy models to estimate the [[Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function]] (BRDF) of land surfaces have led to major advancements in the estimation of terrestrial essential climate variables routinely used to monitor human activity and natural disturbances from satellite platforms. As a lead member of the [[Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer]] (MODIS) and [[Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite ]] (VIIRS) Land Discipline teams, Román's research has enabled scientists to quantify how much of the variations in satellite observations are due to sensor performance, terrain, and/or geometry (view angle) effects; a critical factor when the satellite data are used to drive policy related to [[Climate change|global climate change]]. Most recently, Dr. Román's research has focused on capturing seasonal variations in nighttime lights using measurements from the [[VIIRS]] Day/Night Band on [[Suomi NPP|Suomi-NPP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/satellite-sees-holiday-lights-brighten-cities/ |title=Satellite Sees Holiday Lights Brighten Cities |publisher=NASA |accessdate=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''MacArthur Fellows Program''', '''MacArthur Fellowship''', commonly but unofficially known as a "'''Genius Grant'''", is a prize awarded annually by the [[John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation]] typically to between 20 and 30 individuals, working in any field, who have shown "extraordinary originality and dedication in their creative pursuits and a marked capacity for self-direction" and are citizens or residents of the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.macfound.org/programs/fellows/strategy/|title=About the MacArthur Fellows Program|website=macfound.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Foundation's website, "the fellowship is not a reward for past accomplishment, but rather an investment in a person's originality, insight, and potential". The current prize is $625,000 paid over five years in quarterly installments. This figure was increased from $500,000 in 2013 with the release of a review&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.macfound.org/press/publications/macarthur-fellows-program-review-summary/|title=Review Affirms Impact and Inspiration of MacArthur Fellows Program – MacArthur Foundation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the MacArthur Fellows Program.

The Program allows no applications. Anonymous and confidential nominations are invited by the Foundation and reviewed by an anonymous and confidential selection committee of about a dozen people. The committee reviews all nominees and recommends recipients to the President and [[board of directors]]. Most new Fellows first learn of their nomination and award upon receiving a congratulatory phone call. MacArthur Fellow [[James Collins (bioengineer)|Jim Collins]] described this experience in an editorial column of ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/19/opinion/19collins.html| title=It Isn't Easy Being a Genius| author=Jim Collins| date=September 19, 2005| work=The New York Times| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418105755/http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/19/opinion/19collins.html| archivedate=April 18, 2015| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Manifiesto a la Nación''''' is a document written by [[Francisco I. Madero]] on 5 October 1910 in [[San Luis Potosí]], [[México]]. The text begins with a message directed to the Mexican people and describes a plan in twelve articles. The first article declares invalid the elections  June and July 1910 for president, vice president, magistrates to the [[Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation]], deputies and senators. In the second article he disowned the government of [[Porfirio Díaz]] and all the authorities unelected by the people.

The 3º article declares that the law on uncultivated land took advantage of small landowners, and mostly dispossessed indigenous people arbitrarily. Madero proposes in the name of justice restore to the ancient possessors and demand to those who purchased of immoral form those lands, call to return them to their primitive owners in addition to paying them a compensation by the suffered damages. Only in the case that these lands have been sold to third persons before the promulgation of this plan, the ancient owners will receive compensation of those in whose profit verified the undress.

One of the articles with more impact in this Manifest it is the 4º, where it is declared as ''Supreme Law of the Republic'' the principle of NO-REELECTION of the president and vice-president of the Republic, governors of the states and municipal presidents.

In the 5th article of this manifest, [[Francisco I. Madero|Madero]] assumes the charge of provisional president of the [[Mexico|Mexican United States]], calling for extraordinary elections a month afterwards, when the half of the States of the Federation are in power of the people, promising give the power to the president that results elect. Call to all the citizens of the Republic in the 7th article to take the weapons to launch of the power to the authorities the day [[Mexican Revolution|20 November]] at 6&amp;nbsp;pm. In articles 8 and 9 respectively specifies that when the authorities shows armed resistance, people will force them by strength to respect the popular decisions and to those who resist to this plan will be apprehended and subjects will trial at the end of the [[Mexican Revolution|revolution.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Breve historia del Centro de Estudios de Historia de México Carso|last = Ramos|first = Manuel|publisher = Fundación Carlos Slim|year = 2015|isbn = 978-607-7805-11-3|location = Mexico|pages = |language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical context ==

'''Maria Petrova''' ({{lang-bg|Мария Петрова}}) (born November 13, 1975 in [[Plovdiv]], [[Bulgaria]]) is a [[Bulgaria]]n [[Rhythmic gymnastics|rhythmic gymnast]]. She is a three-time (1993, 1994, 1995) [[World Rhythmic Gymnastics Championships|World]] All-around champion and a three-time (1992, 1993, 1994) [[Rhythmic Gymnastics European Championships|European]] All-around champion.

==Career==
Petrova began her training at the age of five at Trakia Plovdiv Club in [[Plovdiv]], [[Bulgaria]], coached by Natalia Moravenova. By 1991, she was coached by [[Neshka Robeva]] at the Levski Sofia Club. In her first World Championship appearance, Petrova placed second in the team competition after a hoop drop.

Petrova was one of the favorites to win gold but found herself finishing in fifth in the all-around finals at the [[Barcelona Olympics]] after a penalty of .20 was imposed due to the zipper on the back of her [[leotard]] that had broken during her hoop exercise. A few months later, at the World Championships, Petrova took second place behind Russia's [[Oxana Kostina]] and ahead of Belarusian [[Larissa Lukyanenko]].

[[File:Larissa_Loukianenko,_Ekaterina_Serebrianskaya,_Maria_Petrova_y_Amina_Zaripova_1996_Budapest 02.jpg|left|thumb|280px|Petrova (3rd from left) at the [[1996 World Rhythmic Gymnastics Championships|1996 World Championships]]]]In 1993, Petrova performed with her Panovaesque ball to an [[India]]n melody. She also competed in a ribbon exercise, and a small-toss filled clubs routine to [[Suzanne Vega]]'s ''"[[Tom's Diner]]"''. Her final performance to [[Carmina Burana (Orff)|Carmina Burana]] caused a great crowd ovation. She went on to win the all-around World title, as well as three more gold medals (ball, hoop, ribbon) and a bronze medal (clubs).

She went on to win one more European title and two more world titles (shared in 1995 with [[Yekaterina Serebrianskaya]]), tying her with countrywoman [[Maria Gigova]] for the most wins in the latter category.

Competing in her second Olympics, Petrova was one of the front runner to win the gold at the [[1996 Summer Olympics]] in [[Atlanta]], however a series of mistakes left her finishing in 5th place in the [[Gymnastics at the 1996 Summer Olympics – Women's rhythmic individual all-around|All-around Finals]] behind Russia's [[Amina Zaripova]].

Although she had tried to retire several times after her first World title, Petrova continued competing as a favor to the Bulgarian national team, which was in a rebuilding phase after the [[Eastern European]] [[Communist]] collapse.

Petrova shares the world record for most individual world all-around rhythmic gymnastics titles with [[Maria Gigova]], [[Evgenia Kanaeva]] and [[Yana Kudryavtseva]]. Petrova's three titles were earned in 1993, 1994, and 1995 (shared).

She is currently a judge in rhythmic gymnastics.

== Personal life ==
In 1998, Petrova married Bulgarian footballer [[Borislav Mikhailov]].

'''Mikhail Viktorovich Popkov''' ({{lang-ru|Михаи́л Ви́кторович Попко́в}}; born 7 March 1964) is a Russian [[serial killer]] and [[rapist]] who sexually assaulted and [[murder]]ed numerous young women between 1992 and 2010 in [[Angarsk]], [[Irkutsk]], and [[Vladivostok]] in [[Siberia]]. Known as "The Werewolf" and the "Angarsk maniac"—termed as one of Russia's most prolific serial killers—for the brutal nature of his crimes, Popkov was convicted of 22 murders in 2015 and confessed to 59 additional homicides three years later. The killings, if confirmed, supersede that of the country's most notorious serial killer [[Andrei Chikatilo]].

==Life==
Mikhail Popkov was born in [[Angarsk]] on 7 March 1964. Little is known about his upbringing and personal life beyond that he is married and has one daughter. He worked as a police officer in the [[Irkutsk Oblast|Irkutsk region]], and by the time of his capture had also spent time as a security guard at the Angarsk Oil and Chemical Company, as well as at a private firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/4228295|title=Ex-Policeman, Mikhail Popkov, Allegedly Confesses To Gruesome Murdering 24 Women In Siberia|author=Thomas, Emily|work=[[HuffPost]]|date=6 November 2013|accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Popkov's crimes were motivated by suspicions that his wife had committed adultery.&lt;ref name=siberian&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siberiantimes.com/other/others/news/n0844-werewolf-is-worst-ever-serial-killer-in-former-ussr-as-he-is-charged-with-killing-47-more-women/|title='Werewolf' is worst-ever serial killer in former USSR as he is charged with killing 47 more women|work=Siberian Times|date=11 January 2017|accessdate=18 January 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180119060713/http://siberiantimes.com/other/others/news/n0844-werewolf-is-worst-ever-serial-killer-in-former-ussr-as-he-is-charged-with-killing-47-more-women/|archivedate=19 January 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most, if not all, his victims were prostitutes or inebriated young women—people who Popkov considered immoral—between the ages of 17 and 38.&lt;ref name=siberian/&gt; At various points between 1992 and 2010 in Angarsk, [[Irkutsk]], and [[Vladivostok]]—‌a distance of some 3,900&amp;nbsp;km (2,423&amp;nbsp;mi)—‌Popkov, dressed in his police uniform, lured victims with the promise of a free ride and sexually assaulted them.&lt;ref name=siberian/&gt; He killed women with various instruments—‌knives, axes, baseball bats, screwdrivers—‌and mutilated the bodies so grotesquely that Russian media ascribed the crimes to "The Werewolf" and the "Angarsk maniac".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siberiantimes.com/other/others/features/ex-policeman-nicknamed-werewolf-confesses-to-murdering-24-women-in-siberia/|title=Ex-policeman nicknamed 'werewolf' confesses to murdering 24 women in Siberia|work=Siberian Times|date=6 November 2013|accessdate=18 January 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180119120128/http://siberiantimes.com/other/others/features/ex-policeman-nicknamed-werewolf-confesses-to-murdering-24-women-in-siberia/|archivedate=19 January 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/werewolf-serial-killer-mikhail-popkov-heads-trial-59-more-murders-1654662|title='Werewolf' serial killer Mikhail Popkov heads to trial for 59 more murders|author=Rojas, Nicole|work=[[International Business Times]]|date=10 January 2018|accessdate=18 January 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180119120401/http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/werewolf-serial-killer-mikhail-popkov-heads-trial-59-more-murders-1654662|archivedate=19 January 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian police were involved in the search for one perpetrator as slain women were discovered in the mid-1990s, killed by similar methods. Despite extensive inquiries and testimonies from surviving victims, Popkov eluded police for two decades.&lt;ref name=siberian/&gt; However, investigators discovered a pattern: tracks from a [[LADA 4x4]], an off-road vehicle used by law enforcement, were found at numerous crime scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/01/12/werewolf-of-siberia-ranked-among-worst-serial-killers-ever-after-confessing-to-81-victims-says-russian-media/|title='Werewolf' of Siberia ranked among worst serial killers ever after confessing to 81 victims, says Russian media|author=Barbash, Fred|work=[[Washington Post]]|date=12 January 2018|accessdate=18 January 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180119060631/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/01/12/werewolf-of-siberia-ranked-among-worst-serial-killers-ever-after-confessing-to-81-victims-says-russian-media/|archivedate=19 January 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[DNA]] testings of 3,500 current and former policemen in Irkutsk in 2012 facilitated Popkov's capture that same year.

==SuperTrash==
The SuperTrash brand specializes in dresses, tops and pants. A shoe line was added to the collection in 2009, featuring primarily high-heeled shoes supplemented by glamorous flats. Later that year a denim collection named STenim was launched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.textilia.nl/nieuws/jeans/nid3804-supertrash-lanceert-denimlijn-stenim.html |title=Supertrash lanceert denimlijn STenim |date=3 September 2009 |publisher=Textilia.nl''}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, five brand stores were opened in The Netherlands ([[Utrecht]] – [[The Hague]] – [[Laren, North Holland|Laren]] – [[Maastricht]] – [[Eindhoven]]), one in [[Ibiza]] and several shop-in-shops. Additionally, an [[Amsterdam]] and [[Rotterdam]] Brand Store opened in 2011. In 2012 the label expanded internationally, opening up a store and Headquarters on London's Carnaby Street and New York's Prince Street (permanently closed). In total there are now 15 brand stores internationally, including Antwerp, Gent and Wijnegem in Belgium. The brand also introduced its new label ST. Girls in 2012 to fashionably dress 6-16-year olds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grazia.nl/2011/09/15/supertrash-komt-met-lijn-voor-kleine-meisjes/ |title=Supertrash komt met lijn voor kleine meisjes |date=15 September 2011 |publisher=Grazia.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; SuperTrash has also launched its own fragrance, ''Phenomenal'' and a range of nail polishes. In 2013 SuperTrash has evolved into a lifestyle brand instead of primarily a fashion label.

'''Qahtān''' ({{Lang-ar|قحطان}}, also spelled as {{Lang|ar|القحطاني}}) to distinguish between the tribe and the Qahtanite peoples, is an [[Arab]] tribal confederation. Qahtan is composed of three main tribes: Sanhan, Junb, and Rufaida. Today, members of the tribe and its sub-tribes are based in [[Saudi Arabia]] (where most of the tribe is congregated), [[Kuwait]], [[Qatar]], and the [[United Arab Emirates]]. One must note that the [[Madh'hij]]i Qahtan tribe is different from the [[Qahtanite]] peoples, because while all members of the Qahtan identify as Qahtanite through their ancestry to Qahtan son of [[Hud (prophet)|Hud]] which the tribe is named after, not all Qahtanite tribes (such as Shammar, Sharhan, Harb, etc.) trace their ancestry back to the modern tribe known as ''Qahtan''.

Qahtan's sheikhdom was unanimously agreed by Western historians to be in the hands of the 'Al Qarmalah' family of the Jahader clan in the 19th century, and as early as 1961, the paramount sheikh of Qahtan was reported to be 'Khalil ibn Nasir ibn Qarmalah' (a descendant of Hadi ibn Qarmalah).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; However today, this subject of whether the Al Qarmalah family or the Ibn Dulaim family of the Sharif clan are the rightful sheikhs of Qahtan is highly controversial and has led to physical confrontations in high profile tribal Qahtan congregations. Regardless, Abdullah ibn Fahad ibn Dulaim, sheikh of the Ibn Dulaim family, is recognized by the Saudi state as the appointed paramount sheikh of Qahtan and its allied tribe of Wadi'a.&lt;ref&gt;https://arabi21.com/story/1050599/%D8%A7%D8%AC%D8%AA%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B9-%D9%82%D8%AD%D8%B7%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%8A%D8%B3%D8%A8%D8%A8-%D8%AE%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A8%D9%8A%D9%86-%D8%A3%D8%A8%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%A8%D9%8A%D9%84%D8%A9-%D8%B4%D8%A7%D9%87%D8%AF&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Rule of Al Qarmalah===
The Qahtan tribe enjoyed priority rights and control to southern Najd for a period generally agreed to have spanned 90 years, paying suzerainty only to Ibn Saud. Tribes who migrated to Najd during spring or winter to herd their cattle were required to pay taxation in order for them to be allowed to graze their livestock in the Qahtani diyar (territory) in Najd.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;^ جامعة الملك سعود / قسم التاريخ - كلية الاداب&lt;/ref&gt;  Several historians have described Qahtan as "the most powerful" tribe or "nobody dared to challenge them" during this era.&lt;ref&gt;Alexei Vassiliev The History of Saudi Arabia&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Jahader'' branch of the Sanhan sub-tribe of Qahtan migrated to southern Najd from their homelands in Asir Region during the late 18th century and early 19th century under the leadership of Athfar al-Amaaj, driving out the Mutair tribe from Najd after refusing to pay taxation to Mutair in exercising their rights to herding camels and cattle in Najd.&lt;ref&gt;المصدر : كتاب تاريخ نجد – لابن غنام – صفحة 82&lt;/ref&gt; After Qahtan's victory over Mutair, a previously unknown member of the Jahader known as Hadi ibn Qurmula visited Ibn Saud whom he convinced to grant him the sheikhdom of Qahtan. This began the 90 year rule of Al Qurmula over Najd, beginning with Hadi ibn Qurmula and culminating with his son Muhammad ibn Hadi ibn Qurmula.&lt;ref&gt;ج.ج لويمر ج 1 ص 499-500.&lt;/ref&gt; .&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Migration of Bani Hajer===

==Branches==
The Qahtan tribe is subdivided into three major branches: Sanhan سنحان, Junb جنب and Rufaida رفيدة each major branch is divided into many clans, each clan is divided into various families.

*'''Sanhan''' The Sanhan tribe are as follows:
** al-Habab
** al-Jahader
** Al al-Sari
** Al Umar
*'''Junb''' The Junb tribe are as follows:
** [[Al-Hawajir|Bani Hajer (al-Hajri)]]
** Sharif
** Bani Beshr 
** Obaida (al-Obaidi)
*'''Rufaida'''

===Iraq===
Most Qahtanite tribes in Iraq (such as Shemmar, Dulaim, Juboor, etc.) do not belong to the [[Madh'hij]]i tribe of Qahtan. However, few tribes belonging to the aforementioned [[Madh'hij]]i tribe of Qahtan are present in Iraq, a prominent example being the Kobaisat tribal confederation. The Kobaisat (al-Kobaisi) migrated from Tathlith, modern southern Saudi Arabia in the 16th century and settled in Iraq. By the 18th century, many of the Kobaisat migrated to the growing pearl towns of northern Qatar and are a prominent tribe today in that country. The Kobaisat today in Iraq are a large tribal confederation that was also joined by non-Kobaisat tribes such as al-Buhaidar and al-Durai'at, and have formed their own town known as ''Kobaisa''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alshawaf.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=50&amp;Itemid=58|title=قبيلة الكبيسات|first=|last=Administrator|website=www.alshawaf.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; It  must be noted that the Kobaisat are entirely independent from Qahtan and the only aspect linking the two tribes together today is ancestry. Some well known members of the Kobaisat tribe are Iraqi religious scholar [[Mohammed Alkobaisi]] and Ahmed al-Kobaisi, the latter whom is most famous for participating in anti-Salafist debate shows.

===Kuwait===
In Kuwait, Qahtan and its sub-tribe [[Al-Hawajir|Bani Hajir]] have formed a well known alliance in National Assembly elections, being a part of the tribal bloc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alraimedia.com/ar/article/local/2009/04/20/113146/nr/nc|title=طلال السهلي: الالتزام في العهد وميثاق التحالف مع الهواجر وبني قحطان والعتبان والمطران|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bani Hajir are among the largest tribal blocs to participate in the Kuwait National Assembly elections, consisting of 8150 voters in the 2016 election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alqabas.com/67101/|title=بالفيديو – قراءة في السجل الانتخابي للدائرة الخامسة: لأول مرة الرجال أكثر عدداً من النساء - القبس الإلكتروني|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Qatar===
Qahtan, specifically the Bani Hajer tribe, has taken a very prominent role in the Qatar peninsula ever since their migration to that country in the 18th century. The Bani Hajers were infamous in the 19th century for their nomadic lifestyle, political and tribal alliances, and piratical activities in the Persian Gulf.&lt;ref&gt;دليل الخليج. الجزء الأول. المواد التاريخية والسياسية.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the vast majority of Bani Hajer inhabited the Qatar peninsula until around 1900 when most of the tribe migrated west to modern day Saudi Arabia in Al-Ahsa and Jubail after a dispute with the ruling Qatari [[Al Thani]] family. As a result of their loyalty and military service to [[Al Saud]], in the Eastern region of Saudi Arabia, the Bani Hajers were awarded settlement rights in an area known today as "Jawf Bani Hajer", and there they also established several [[hijras]].&lt;ref&gt;Bedouin Ethnobotany: Plant Concepts and Uses in a Desert Pastoral World page 48 and 49&lt;/ref&gt; Branches of Qahtan such as al-Habab (known as al-Ehbabi in Qatar) also have a presence in that country but their fame is not nearly as recognized as that of Bani Hajer. Perhaps the most recognized Hajri personality in Qatar would be Mozah Al Mesned, the mother of the current Emir of Qatar [[Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani]], who belongs to the Al Muhannada branch of the Bani Hajer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marefa.org/%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%B5%D8%B1_%D8%A8%D9%86_%D8%B9%D8%A8%D8%AF_%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D9%87_%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B3%D9%86%D8%AF|title=ناصر بن عبد الله المسند - المعرفة|website=www.marefa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bahrain===
Bahrain is a Gulf country that houses the tiniest number of Qahtanis compared to other Gulf countries, however, some members of the tribe have taken a relatively prominent role in the country. For example, the head of the Sunni Waqf Endowment Directorate is Rashid al-Hajri, a member of the Bani Hajer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alayam.com/online/local/549725/News.html|title=صدور أمر ملكي بتعيين الشيخ راشد الهاجري رئيساً لمجلس الأوقاف السنية|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Offshoot Hajri families such Almuhannada also take a public role such as former Member of Parliament Hamad Almuhannadi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alwasatnews.com/news/497331.html|title=الكتل النيابية تحت قبة البرلمان|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Arab Emirates===
Qahtan takes a noteworthy role in the United Arab Emirates, which however is not as large as Kuwait or Qatar. For example, a member of the Advisory Council to the Government of [[Sharjah]] is Abdulqader al-Hajri, a member of Bani Hajer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emarati.katib.org/2011/03/09/%d8%a5%d9%85%d8%a7%d8%b1%d8%a7%d8%aa%d9%8a%d9%88%d9%86-%d9%8a%d8%b1%d9%81%d8%b9%d9%88%d9%86-%d8%b1%d8%b3%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%a9-%d9%84%d8%ad%d9%83%d8%a7%d9%85-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%a5%d9%85%d8%a7%d8%b1%d8%a7/|title=إماراتيون يرفعون رسالة لحكام الإمارات تطالب بإصلاح كلي للنظام البرلماني : مواطن إماراتي مغلوب على أمره|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bani Hajer were also historically allied with the al-Manasir tribe, which sometimes may claim descent from Bani Hajer based on their historical alliance.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Bedouin Ethnobotany: Plant Concepts and Uses in a Desert Pastoral World&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller families of Qahtan such as "al-Ehbabi" are also present in the country.

==Notable members==
* [[Saud al-Qahtani]], former Advisor of the Saudi Royal court and the former General Supervisor of the Center for Studies and Information Affairs at minister rank. &lt;ref&gt;https://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/gulf/2017/07/06/Saudi-official-23-thousand-account-recruited-by-Qatar-to-attack-Saudi-Arabia.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert Pershing Wadlow''' (February 22, 1918 – July 15, 1940), also known as the '''Alton Giant''' and the '''Giant of Illinois''', was an American who became famous as the [[list of tallest people|tallest person]] in [[recorded history]] for whom there is irrefutable evidence. He was born and raised in [[Alton, Illinois]].&lt;ref name="museum"/&gt;

Wadlow reached {{convert|8|ft|11.1|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}}&lt;ref name="Guinness"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Worlds Largest Things Traveling Roadside Attraction"&gt;{{cite web |title=World's Tallest Man |website=Worlds Largest Things Traveling Roadside Attraction |url=http://www.worldslargestthings.com/easterntour/wadlow.htm |access-date=May 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="roadside"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roadsideamerica.com/attract/ILALTwadlow.html |title=Robert Wadlow, World's Tallest Man, Alton Illinois |publisher=[[Roadside America]] |accessdate=March 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in height and weighed {{convert|439|lbs|abbr=on}} at his death at age 22. His great size and his continued growth in adulthood were due to [[hyperplasia]] of his [[pituitary gland]], which results in an abnormally high level of [[human growth hormone]] (HGH). He showed no indication of an end to his growth even at the time of his death.

==Early life==
Wadlow was born in [[Alton, Illinois]], on February 22, 1918, to Harold Franklin and Addie May (Johnson) Wadlow, and was the oldest of five children. He was taller than his father by the age of 8, and in elementary school they had to make a special desk for him due to his size. By the time he had graduated from [[Alton High School]] in 1936, he was {{convert|8|ft|4|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}}.&lt;ref name="museum"/&gt; After graduating he enrolled in [[Shurtleff College]] with the intention of studying law.

==Later years and death==
Wadlow's size began to take its toll: he required leg braces to walk and had [[Hypoesthesia|little feeling]] in his legs and feet. Despite these difficulties, he never used a wheelchair.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2018/2/on-this-day-in-1918-the-tallest-man-in-the-world-is-born-515815|title=On This Day in 1918: The tallest man in the world is born|date=February 22, 2018|work=Guinness World Records|access-date=August 18, 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wadlow became a [[celebrity]] after his 1936 U.S. tour with the [[Ringling Brothers Circus]]. He appeared with Ringling Brothers at [[Madison Square Garden]] and the [[Boston Garden]] in the center ring, never in the [[sideshow]].&lt;ref name="nickell"&gt;Joe Nickell (2005). Secrets of the Sideshows. University Press of Kentucky.{{ISBN|0813123585}}, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; During his appearances, he was dressed in his normal clothes and refused Circus request to wear a [[top hat]] and [[Tailcoat|tails]].&lt;ref name="nickell"/&gt;

In 1938, he did a promotional tour with the [[International Shoe Company]]. They provided him his shoes free of charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.altonweb.com/history/wadlow/|title=Alton Museum of History and Art - Robert Pershing Wadlow - Alton's Gentle Giant|website=www.altonweb.com|access-date=August 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of the shoes still exist in several locations throughout the U.S., including Snyder's Shoe Store of Ludington and Manistee, Michigan, and the [[Alton Museum of History and Art]]. He continued participating in tours and public appearances, though only in his normal street clothes.{{sfn |Drimmer |1991 |p=60}} Wadlow rationalized that he was working in advertising, not being exhibited as a freak.&lt;ref name="nickell"/&gt; He possessed great physical strength until the last year of his life, when his strength and his health in general began to deteriorate rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thevintagenews.com/2016/10/21/measuring-8-ft-11-inches-wadlow-was-the-tallest-man-in-history-at-age-eight-he-was-taller-than-his-father/|title=Measuring 8 ft 11 inches, Wadlow was the tallest man in history. At age eight, he was taller than his father.|date=October 21, 2016|work=The Vintage News|access-date=July 24, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wadlow was a member of the Order of DeMolay, the Masonic-sponsored organization for young men. He was also a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]]. In 1939, he petitioned Franklin Lodge #25 in Alton, Illinois, and by late November of that year&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilmason.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=01Sk7v_r9nY%3d&amp;tabid=101&amp;mid=516 ''Robert Wadlow "worlds tallest man, worlds tallest mason"''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110914143338/http://www.ilmason.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=01Sk7v_r9nY%3D&amp;tabid=101&amp;mid=516 |date=September 14, 2011 }} Illinois Freemasonry Magazine, Vol. 15, No. 1, Winter 2009 p.5&lt;/ref&gt; was raised to the degree of Master Mason under the jurisdiction of the Grand Lodge of Illinois A.F. and A.M.. His Freemason ring was the largest ever made.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

One year before his death, Wadlow passed [[John Rogan]] as the tallest person ever. On June 27, 1940 (18 days before his death), he was measured at {{convert|8|ft|11.1|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} by doctors C. M. Charles and Cyril MacBryde of [[Washington University School of Medicine|Washington University]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]].&lt;ref name="museum"/&gt;

On July 4, 1940, during a professional appearance at the [[Manistee National Forest]] Festival, a faulty [[Brace (orthopaedic)|brace]] irritated his ankle, causing a [[blister]] and subsequent [[infection]]. Doctors treated him with a [[blood transfusion]] and emergency [[surgery]], but his condition worsened due to an [[Autoimmune disease|autoimmune disorder]], and on July 15, 1940, 11 days after contracting the infection, he died in his sleep at the age of 22.{{sfn |Drimmer |1991 |pp=68, 70}}&lt;ref name="museum"/&gt; His coffin measured {{convert|10|ft|9|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} long by {{convert|2|ft|8|in|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} wide by {{convert|2|ft|6|in|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} deep, weighed over {{convert|1000|lbs|abbr=on}}, and was carried by twelve pallbearers and eight assistants.&lt;ref name="museum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guiness2"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/tallest-man-ever |title=Tallest man ever |website=Guinness World Records}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hartzman 2006 p. 432"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hartzman |first=Marc |title=American sideshow : an encyclopedia of history's most wondrous and curiously strange performers |publisher=Jeremy P.

==Legacy==
A life-size statue of Wadlow stands on College Avenue in Alton, opposite the [[Alton Museum of History and Art]]. It was erected in 1986, in honor of the well-known native.&lt;ref name="museum"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thetelegraph.com/news/wadlow-42595-manistee-years.html|title=Wadlow died 70 years ago Thursday|last=Brannan|first=Dan|date=July 14, 2010|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=March 4, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110131061652/http://www.thetelegraph.com/news/wadlow-42595-manistee-years.html|archivedate=January 31, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others stand in the [[Guinness World Records#Museums|Guinness Museums]] in [[Niagara Falls, Ontario]] and [[Gatlinburg, Tennessee]], as well as several of the [[Ripley's Believe It or Not!#Museums|Ripley's Believe It or Not Museums]]. A group of six life-size models of him, made by artist [[James Butler (artist)|James Butler]], exist, and are shipped and displayed in replica caskets.&lt;ref name="The worlds strangest mysteries 1987 p. 702"&gt;{{cite book |title=The World's Strangest Mysteries |year=1987 |publisher=Gallery Books |location=New York |isbn=9780831796785 |oclc=17192393 |page=702 |chapter=The King of Giants}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another life-size statue of Wadlow may be viewed at Marvin's Marvelous Mechanical Museum in [[Farmington Hills, Michigan]]. In front of it is a small, quarter-operated "TV-box", which plays a short, documentary movie about his extraordinary short life.

Wadlow is still affectionately known as the "Gentle Giant".&lt;ref name="scout"/&gt;

==In music==
The 1998 song "The Giant of Illinois", by [[The Handsome Family]] (and later covered by [[Andrew Bird]]) honors Wadlow. In 2005, [[Sufjan Stevens]] recorded "The Tallest Man, the Broadest Shoulders" about Wadlow for the ''[[Illinois (Sufjan Stevens album)|Illinois]]'' album. A picture of Wadlow with his family is featured on the back cover of the [[VHS]] version of the [[Talking Heads]] music video compilation, ''[[Storytelling Giant]]''.

'''Sam J. Reid''' (born 7 November 1989) is a professional [[Australian rules football]]er playing for the [[Greater Western Sydney Giants]] in the [[Australian Football League]] (AFL). He previously played for the {{AFL WB}}.

Reid was drafted to the [[Western Bulldogs]] with the 35th selection in the [[2007 AFL draft]]. The young [[Queensland]]er is a medium-sized midfielder, and debuted against [[Adelaide Football Club|Adelaide]] in the final round of the regular season of [[2008 AFL season|2008]].

In 2009, he had major groin surgery for his osteitis pubis. This surgery was thought to have also triggered his Type 1 diabetes which shortly followed the surgery.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/bulldog-has-diabetes-but-is-ok-to-play-on-20100123-mrrx.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 he was recruited by the new Greater Western Sydney Giants as an uncontracted player.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/more-action-to-come-on-day-four/story-fn69a32t-1226165490224 Trade week updates - day four]&lt;/ref&gt;  He made his debut for the Giants in their Round 5 match against the Bulldogs in Canberra at [[Manuka Oval]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-sport/sheedy-makes-hit-list-of-gws-critics-20120427-1xq0g.html Sheedy makes hit list of GWS critics]&lt;/ref&gt;

After being delisted at the end of the 2013 season, Sam accepted a role from the Giants to stay at the club in a coaching role (development coach).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gwsgiants.com.au/video/2013-11-06/reid-steps-into-coaching|title=Reid Steps Into Coaching|date=6 November 2013|work=GWSGiants.com.au|publisher=[[Bigpond]]|accessdate=28 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sebastao Rodolfo Dalgado.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Sebastião Rodolfo Dalgado]]
'''[[Msgr]] Sebastião Rodolfo Dalgado''' ([[Konkani]] [[devnagri script]]: सॆबास्तियाँव रॊदॊल्फ़ो दाल्गादॊ; [[Konkani]] '[[romi script]]' : Sebastiaom Rodolf Dalgad; 8 May 1855 – 4 April 1922) was an [[Indian people|Indo]]-[[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] [[Catholic]] priest, academic, university professor, theologian, [[Orientalism|orientalist]] and [[Linguistics|linguist]]. 

Dalgado distinguished himself as a linguist and etymologist in the study of the influences of the Portuguese language on a number of languages of [[Southeast Asia]]. He was a corresponding member of the [[Lisbon Academy of Sciences]], elected on July 27, 1911.He also became widely renowned during his lifetime as a [[Konkani]] language [[scholar]].

==Early life==
Sebastião Rodolfo Dalgado, was born in [[Assagao]], [[Bardez]], Goa,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pereira|1983|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; to a [[Goan Catholic]] family of the [[Roman Catholic Brahmin|Bamonn]] caste.&lt;ref name="Dalgado"/&gt; He had six brothers and a sister. The family's pre-conversion surname was Desai, replaced by the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] surname [[Dalgado]], after conversion to Christianity.&lt;ref name="Dalgado"&gt;{{harvnb|Dalgado|Soares|1988|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=3qk-p5hKuccC&amp;pg=PR12 57]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second son of Ambrose Dalgado, a landowner in Bardez, and Florinda Rosa de Souza, he had six brothers and one sister. Among the siblings were [[Daniel Gelásio Dalgado]], a medical director of  the health services from [[Sawantwadi]] and an eminent botanist; Patrocínio Dalgado, ophthalmologist; and Eduardo Dalgado, a lawyer in Lisbon.

==Career==
After completing his elementary studies in [[Assagao]], the young Dalgado completed his secondary education in [[Mapusa]] and joined the [[Rachol Seminary]], near [[Margao]], from where he was ordained a priest in 1881. 

Considered the best student of his course, he was selected for further studies and then went on to Rome, where he enrolled at the [[Seminary of St. Apollinaris]].

In Rome his doctorate was in [[Canon Law]] and [[Roman Law]].

==Return from Lisbon==

After a brief stay in Lisbon in 1884, he returned to Goa as a missionary, where the then [[Patriarch of the East Indies]], Don [[António Sebastião Valente]], appointed him as the inspector of schools and workshops of the [[Padroado do Oriente]] and as a professor of Scripture and Canon Law at the [[Seminary of Rachol]], where he formerly studied. He also functioned as an ecclesiastical judge in Goa.

Subsequently, he was intensely involved in religious activity in India, and then became [[vicar general]] of the [[island of Ceylon]], particularly of  the Portuguese mission in the city of [[Colombo]], which had been abolished by [[Concordat of 1886]].

Later, he served at [[Calcutta]], where he founded a school for girls and a dispensary for the poor in [[Nagori]], and [[Dhaka]].

==Close contacts with languages==

All this activity enabled him to forge close contacts with various language communities, thus allowing him to acquire a mastery of several Indian languages, including [[Malayalam]], [[Kannada]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Sinhalese language|Sinhala]] and [[Bengali language|Bengali]]. Learning some of these languages was made easier due to his deep knowledge of [[Sanskrit]]. 

Between 1893 and 1895 he was vicar-general in [[Honnavar]], today in the State of Karnataka. There he served a community of Konkani and Kannada speakers, the latter being a language he learnt. It took some time in [[Sawantwadi]], with his brother Gelasius Dalgado, who was a doctor there, for him to learn other dialects of Konkani.

When he was vicar general of [[Ceylon]], he declined to accept the bishop's mitre that the [[Congregation of Propaganda Fide]] had offered him, probably in the context of the dispute between Portugal and the [[Holy See]] on the extent and powers of the [[Patronage of the East]] ([[Padroado]]).

During his stay in [[Ceylon]], he wrote several sermons and homilies in the Indo-Portuguese dialect  of Ceylon. His other work included ''[[The Indo-Portuguese Dialect of Ceylon]],'' published in 1900 in ''Contributions of the Geographical Society of Lisbon'', done in commemoration of the centenary of the European discovery of sea route to India.

==Dictionaries==

His first published work was the first part of ''Konkani-Portuguese Dictionary'', written using the  [[Devanagari]] alphabet and the Roman script, and which was published in 1893 in the city of Bombay, now known as [[Mumbai]]. 

In 1895 he settled in [[Lisbon]], where he completed the publication of the ''Konkani-Portuguese Dictionary'' (which was out in 1905) and devoted himself to study the influence of [[English language|English]] on the languages of the [[Indian subcontinent]].

In view of its studies published, in 1907 he was appointed Professor of Sanskrit in the [[Curso Superior de Letras]], which was founded in 1859 by D. [[Pedro V]] in [[Lisbon]]. This institution later on went on to become the nucleus of the   Faculty of Arts of the [[University of Lisbon]].

==Recognition==

In 1911 he was elected corresponding member of the [[Academy of Sciences]], and received the title of ''Doutor em Letras'', which was granted by the Council of the Faculty of Arts of Lisbon (''Conselho da Faculdade de Letras de Lisboa'').

He suffered from [[diabetes]], which ultimately resulted in the amputation of both his legs (in 1911 and 1915.) From that point onwards, Dalgado used a wheelchair.

Because of his handicap, the Faculty of Humanities granted him the  privilege of performing his duties from his home, where his students gathered around him to hear his lessons. He also undertook the daily celebration of Mass in his wheelchair, with special religious permission.

When he died, on 4 April 1922, his funeral rites reflected the wide prestige that had won. In attendance were the Patriarch of Lisbon, the Apostolic Nuncio in Lisbon, the Minister of Education and representatives of colleges and academies of Lisbon.

The funeral eulogy was delivered by Canon [[José de Santa Rita e Sousa]], professor of the ''Escola Superior Colonial'', where he taught the chair of Konkani language. The press coverage was large, reflecting throughout the Lusophone world.

He was an  eminent [[philologist]], publishing, among other works, the ''Glossário Luso-Asiático'' in two volumes, full-text versions of which are available online today. He was also the author of outstanding works in the field of Portuguese [[Orientalism]]  such as ''The Indo-Portuguese dialect of Ceylon''; ''Konkani-Portuguese Dictionary''; ''The Indo-Portuguese dialect of Mumbai and suburbs''; ''Influencia do vocabulário português em línguas asiáticas'' (The Influence of Portuguese Vocables in Asian Languages);  ''The Indo-Portuguese Dialects  of Goa, Daman and Ceylon''; ''Fundamentals of the Sanskrit language'', and ''Indian Proverbs''.

His works have earned high praise, including that of Dr. [[Aniceto dos Reis Gonçalves Viana|Gonçalves Viana]] who appreciated his work ''The Influence of Portuguese Vocables in Asian Languages'' and said ''that perhaps no other wise person, Portuguese or foreign, could carry it out satisfactorily''.

The Brazilian philologist Dr. [[Solidonio Leite]] said that "Monsignor Dalgado could undertake and carry out those works that attest to exceptional value of this great man".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.supergoa.com/pt/read/news_cronica.asp?c_news=286 Monsignor Rodolfo Dalgado (1855–1922)] {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recognition of his work in 1904, he received the honour of honorary chaplain of the Pope's ''extra urbem'', with the right to use the title of "[[Monsignor]]". He was a member of the [[Lisbon Geographic Society]] (1895), a member of the [[Institute of Coimbra]] (1896), Doctor ''Honoris Causa'' from the Faculty of Arts, University of Lisbon (1911), corresponding member Academy of Sciences (1911) and its member (1922) and a member of the [[Royal Asiatic Society]] in [[London]] (1921).

In 1922, the [[Academy of Sciences of Lisbon]], which bequeathed the 300 documents that constitute the Monsignor Dalgado Fund, admitted him posthumously as a member. Along with [[Shenoi Goembab]] and [[Joaquim Heliodoró da Cunha Rivara]], Sebastião Rodolfo Dalgado is widely considered to be a pioneer in the defence of the [[Konkani]] language.

The city of Lisbon honoured him with a place named after him, to a wide locality in the parish of [[São Domingos de Benfica]]. In 1955 the ''Correios do Estado da Índia'' (postal department of the Estado da Índia) issued a postage stamp of a one real denomination, to mark the centenary of the birth of Monsignor Sebastiao Rodolfo Delgado, accompanied by a postcard with his photograph.

In 1989, the [[Goan]] state capital of [[Panjim]] saw the creation of   the [[Dalgado Konkani Academy]], an academy to promote the use of the [[Konkani language]] in the Latin alphabet (the [[Konkani in the Roman script|''Konkani Romi lipi'']]). The [[Dalgado Konkani Academy]] has also established the Monsignor Sebastiao Rudolfo Dalgado Award to be awarded annually for activities to promote the study and use of Konkani.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mail-archive.com/goanet@goanet.org/msg25931.html Msgr Sebastiao Rodolfo Dalgado Award 2005].&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3858">'''Shabtai Teveth''' ({{lang-he|שבתי טבת}}; 1925 – 1 November 2014), was an [[Israelis|Israeli]] historian and an anti-[[Revisionist Zionism|Revisionist]] author.

Teveth was born in 1925 and grew up in the worker' quarters at the Migdal Tzedek quarry, where his father worked, near [[Petah Tikvah]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/news/israel/1.624423 Remembering Shabtai Teveth, David Ben-Gurion's official biographer], ''Haaretz''&lt;/ref&gt; He began working as a journalist for the newspaper ''[[Haaretz]]'' in 1950, eventually becoming its political correspondent. In 1981, he was appointed Senior Research Fellow at the [[Moshe Dayan Center for Middle Eastern and African Studies]] at [[Tel Aviv University]].

Following the publication of his research into the murder of [[Haim Arlosoroff]], 1982, [[Menachim Begin]] - first Israeli Prime Minister elected from the Revisionist movement - ordered a Judicial Commission of Enquiry which concluded that Teveth was wrong to suggest the murder might have been carried out by two [[Revisionist Zionism|Revisionists]].

In his biography of [[David Ben-Gurion]], Teveth argues that Ben-Gurion did not instigate a policy of [[population transfer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Segev |first=Tom |title=One Palestine Complete: Jews and Arabs under the British Mandate |publisher= Little, Brown and Company |year=2000 |isbn= 9780805065879 |page=407}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Teveth was awarded the [[Israel Prize]] for "lifetime achievement and special contribution to society and the State."

'''Sophia Namutebi''', also known as '''Sofia Namutebi''', '''Sylvia Namutebi''', and '''Maama Fiina''', is a [[Uganda]]n businesswoman, [[traditional healer]], and community leader. She was listed in 2013 as one of the wealthiest people in Uganda.&lt;ref name="Wel"&gt;{{cite web | title=Some of Uganda's richest women | newspaper=[[New Vision (newspaper)|New Vision]] | date=3 March 2013 | first=Maureen | last=Nakatudde | url=https://www.newvision.co.ug/new_vision/news/1314989/ugandas-richest-women | accessdate=16 November 2017 | location=Kampala}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Namutebi was born in [[Mukono District]] circa 1979&lt;ref name="Beg"/&gt; in a family with modest means. She dropped out of school at an early age and while still a teenager, gave birth to her daughter Safina (abbreviated as Fiina). She worked as a maid to support herself and her daughter. When she was 16 years old, she relocated to Kampala, the country's capital city, where she began hawking merchandise on the streets.&lt;ref name="Beg"&gt;{{cite web | accessdate=16 November 2017 | location=Kampala | url=http://www.monitor.co.ug/Business/Commodities/Maama-Fiina--the-business-empress/688610-2141834-ba6piu/index.html | title=Maama Fiina, the business empress | date=11 January 2014 | newspaper=[[Daily Monitor]] | first=Edgar | last=Batte}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, she borrowed UGX:38,000 and bought a consignment of polythene bags to hawk on the streets. She grew her capital to UGX:3 million in a short time. She bought a commuter taxi (matatu or kamunye), recycling the profits into a second vehicle and a third one, over time.&lt;ref name="Beg"/&gt;

In 1998, she began importing cloth from [[Dubai]] to make the women's attire called [[gomesi]] or [[busuuti]], worn in Uganda. Namutebi recalls that in 1999, she had four commuter taxis plying the [[Kampala–Jinja Highway]], each valued at UGX:8.5 million, representing almost 1,000 fold what she had borrowed in 1995.&lt;ref name="Beg"/&gt;

==Her businesses==
With the commuter taxis and the gomesi business continuing to bring in income, she diversified into the motorcycles taxi business. She would buy a motorcycle at UGX:720,000 each and lease to a rider-operator with payments totaling UGX:1,400,000 by the end of the lease-purchase. Starting with 20 motorcycles, her business grew to 500 vehicles.&lt;ref name="Beg"/&gt; 

Her other investments include garment shops in downtown Kampala, [[Masaka]], and [[Mityana]]. She owns secondary schools in [[Mukono Town|Mukono]] and Mityana.&lt;ref name="Wel"/&gt; She has real estate investments in residential and commercial property in various locations in the country. She is also involved in the importation of used cars from Japan for sale to retail customers. Maama Fiina says she does not earn much from her business as a traditional healer.&lt;ref name="Beg"/&gt;

==Family==
In September 2017, Namutebi was married to Ismail Ssegujja, a businessman. The wedding took place at Kololo Mosque.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Mama-Fina-gets-married-again-given-Shs19m/688334-4095922-ecn1k7/index.html |title=Mama Fiina gets married again, given Shs19 million | accessdate=16 November 2017 |location=Kampala | first=Joseph |last=Kato |newspaper=[[Daily Monitor]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has been married in the past, to the late Major Major Muhammad Kiggundu who was assassinated in November 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=26 November 2016 | url=http://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Gunmen--kill--Sheik--Maj-Kiggundu/688334-3465564-p75oe4/index.html |title=Police link Major Kiggundu's assassination to ADF rebels |accessdate=16 November 2017 |location=Kampala |newspaper=[[Daily Monitor]]| | author=Monitor Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was previously married to Ali Kyonjo, who was her husband in 2014.&lt;ref name="Beg"/&gt;

'''Stefan Brockhoff''' is a pseudonym that was used ''collectively'' by a group of three [[Germans|German]] co-authors of several detective novels,&lt;ref name=Brockhoff&gt;Cf. Stefan Brockhoff, ''Schuß auf die Bühne'' (Leipzig, Wilhelm Goldmann Verlag, 1935); ''id.'', ''Musik im Totengässlein'' (Bern, etc., Goldmann, 1936); ''id.'', ''Drei Kioske am See'' (Leipzig, Goldmann, 1937); ''id.'', ''Begegnung in Zermatt'' (Munich, Goldmann, 1955). Another novel, entitled ‘Verwirrung um Veronika’, is said to have been serialized in the ''Zürcher Illustrierte'' in 1938. Cf. Angelika Jockers and Reinhard Jahn, eds., ''Lexikon der deutschsprachigen Krimi-Autoren'' (2nd&amp;nbsp;ed., rev.; Munich, Verlag der Criminale, 2005). It is impossible independently to corroborate the attribution in question.&lt;/ref&gt; all of them having certain characteristics in common: they were all born in Germany at or about the beginning of the second decade of the twentieth century; at one point or another they all of them became refugees from [[Nazism]]; and they all eventually lived out their lives in the United States of America. Moreover, to every one of them the writing of detective novels was a youthful [[avocation]], their principal interests and activities in later life lying in different areas.

'''William Todd Akin''' (born July 5, 1947) is an American politician who is a former [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|MO|2}}, serving from 2001 to 2013. He is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].

Born in [[New York City]], Akin grew up in the [[Greater St. Louis]] area. After receiving his bachelor's degree from [[Worcester Polytechnic Institute]] in Massachusetts, Akin served in the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] and worked in the private sector in the computer and steel industries. In 1988, he was elected to the [[Missouri House of Representatives]]. He served in the state house until 2000, when he was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives]], in which he served until 2013.

Akin's Congressional career ended after he lost a bid to unseat [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] U.S. Senator [[Claire McCaskill]] in the [[United States Senate election in Missouri, 2012|2012 election]]. Akin, who had won the Republican primary in a crowded field, led McCaskill in pre-election polls until [[Rape and pregnancy controversies in United States elections, 2012#Todd Akin|he said]] that women who are victims of what he called "legitimate rape" [[Pregnancy from rape|rarely get pregnant]]. Akin eventually apologized for the remark but rebuffed calls to withdraw from the election.&lt;ref name="Haberkorn"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1112/83449.html |work=Politico |first=Jennifer |last=Haberkorn |title=Abortion, rape controversy shaped key races |date=November 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He lost to McCaskill by 54.7 percent to 39.2 percent.&lt;ref name="2012results" /&gt; In a book published in July 2014, Akin said that he regretted apologizing and defended his original comments.

==Early life, education, and business career==
Akin was born in [[New York City]], and raised in the [[St. Louis]] area. He is the son of Nancy Perry (née Bigelow) and Paul Bigelow Akin.&lt;ref name=nyt1944&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1944/09/09/archives/troth-announced.html Announcements], The New York Times, September 9, 1944, Section Sports, Page 21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="faith"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/22/us/politics/todd-akins-faith-is-central-to-his-politics.html|  title=A Politician Whose Faith Is Central to His Persistence|first=John|last=Eligon|date=August 21, 2012 |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Penniman Family: To 1980|author1=Penniman, G.W.|author2=Bigelow, P.|author3=Penniman, G.D.|date=1987|publisher=Penniman Family|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZpJJAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=2015-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Akin's great-grandfather, Thomas Russell Akin, founded [[Alton Steel|Laclede Steel Corporation]] of St. Louis in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1966/03/26/archives/laclede-steel-names-chief.html Laclede Steel Names Chief], The New York Times, Business and Finance Section, March 26, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; The company eventually passed to his grandfather, William Akin, and then to his father Paul, a third-generation graduate of [[Harvard University]] who served as an officer in the Navy during World War II.&lt;ref name="nyt1944"/&gt;&lt;ref name="faith"/&gt;

Akin graduated from [[John Burroughs School]], a private [[University-preparatory school|prep school]] in suburban St. Louis,&lt;ref name="faith"/&gt; and went on to attend [[Worcester Polytechnic Institute]] in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], earning a B.S. in Management Engineering in 1970.

After graduation, Akin served as an engineer officer in the [[U.S. National Guard|National Guard]] of the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]],&lt;ref name="bluebook 1993.1"&gt;[http://cdm.sos.mo.gov/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=%2Fstatepub&amp;CISOPTR=99477&amp;REC=17&amp;CISOBOX=akin  Official Manual of the State of Missouri, 1993–1994]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; then served in the [[United States Army Reserve|Army Reserve]] until 1980.&lt;ref&gt;[http://akin.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=9&amp;Itemid=2  Biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120824000846/http://akin.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=9&amp;Itemid=2 |date=2012-08-24 }}, Congressman Todd Akin, Missouri's 2nd District, retrieved 2012-08-23.&lt;/ref&gt; After leaving active duty, Akin sold large computer systems for [[IBM]], then worked as a manager in his family's steel business.&lt;ref name="bluebook 1993.1"/&gt;

Akin earned a [[Master of Divinity]] degree in 1984 from [[Covenant Theological Seminary]] where he studied Greek, Hebrew, and a socially conservative interpretation of the Christian scriptures. He did not enter the ministry.&lt;ref name="agenda"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/akins-congressional-legacy-small-but-his-support-among-christian-groups-is-big/2012/08/22/b2c2d98e-ec75-11e1-aca7-272630dfd152_story_1.html|title=Akin's agenda wins loyalty of Christian groups|author1=McCrummen, Stephanie  |author2=Fahrenthold, David A.  |lastauthoramp=yes |work=Washington Post|date=August 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Missouri House of Representatives==

===Elections===
Akin was elected to the [[Missouri House of Representatives]] in November 1988, running unopposed to represent District 85 in West County.&lt;ref name="bluebook 89"&gt;[http://cdm.sos.mo.gov/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=%2Fstatepub&amp;CISOPTR=92231&amp;REC=10&amp;CISOBOX=akin Official Manual of the State of Missouri 1989–1990]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, p. 669.&lt;/ref&gt; He won re-election in 1990 with 59% of the vote.&lt;ref name="bluebook 91"&gt;[http://cdm.sos.mo.gov/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/statepub&amp;CISOPTR=97970&amp;REC=10 Official Manual of the State of Missouri 1991–1992]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}, p. 506.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to re-districting, Akin represented District 86 from 1993 through 2000, never winning less than 66% of the vote.&lt;ref name="bluebook 93"&gt;[http://cdm.sos.mo.gov/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=%2Fstatepub&amp;CISOPTR=99477&amp;REC=17&amp;CISOBOX=akin  Official Manual of the State of Missouri, 1993–1994]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}, p. 716.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bluebook 95"&gt;[http://cdm.sos.mo.gov/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/statepub&amp;CISOPTR=95089&amp;REC=5 Official Manual of the State of Missouri, 1995–1996]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}, p. 541.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bluebook 97"&gt;[http://cdm.sos.mo.gov/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/statepub&amp;CISOPTR=93684&amp;REC=4 Official Manual of the State of Missouri 1997–1998]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }} p. 574.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bluebook 99"&gt;[http://cdm.sos.mo.gov/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/statepub&amp;CISOPTR=96610&amp;REC=7 Official Manual of the State of Missouri 1999–2000]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }} p. 571.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tenure===
Akin served as a member of the House Ways and Means Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SL&amp;p_theme=sl&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB04F928C618B8F&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM | work=St. Louis Post-Dispatch | title=Tangled Politics Of Coming Election Apply Ice To Missouri's Tax-Cut Fever | date=1996-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his 12 years in the state house, Akin advocated for [[Homeschooling|homeschool]] rights,&lt;ref name="stltoday1"/&gt; voted for [[concealed carry permit|carrying concealed weapons]], voted against the parks and soils [[sales tax]], and voted against the 1993 tax increase and education spending increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SL&amp;p_theme=sl&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB04FF2A1063D61&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM | work=St. Louis Post-Dispatch | title=For The Missouri House – Iv | date=1996-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Akin sponsored legislation to prohibit [[Casino industry|casino companies]] from contributing to Missouri state lawmakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SL&amp;p_theme=sl&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB086CE430588D9&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM | work=St. Louis Post-Dispatch | title=Casinos Decry Proposal To Stop Contributions Similar Efforts Have Withstood Court Challenges | date=1998-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, he fought Democratic Governor [[Mel Carnahan]] over a bill providing state funding for school nurses. Ultimately, the governor refused to sign the funding bill due to Akin's amendment, which would have prohibited nurses from telling students about sources for information about abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=9zUjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=a9gEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1361,2108434&amp;dq=todd+akin&amp;hl=en |accessdate=2012-01-29|title=Carnahan blasts 'extremists'|agency=The Associated Press|date=May 14, 1995|work=The Southeast Missourian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
In 2000, Akin ran in the Republican [[primary election]] to fill the House seat vacated by [[U.S. Representative]] [[Jim Talent]], who was running for governor. Light voter turnout caused by heavy rains helped Akin win the tight, five-way primary by just 56 votes; he defeated two better-known candidates, former St. Louis County Executive [[Gene McNary]] and [[Missouri Senate|State Senator]] [[Franc Flotron]].&lt;ref name="faith"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Representative – District 2 – Summary|url=http://www.sos.mo.gov/enrweb/raceresults.asp?eid=13&amp;oid=3681&amp;arc=1|publisher=Office of Secretary of State, Missouri|accessdate=2011-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="world"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/opinion/columns/kevin-horrigan/horrigan-the-world-discovers-the-weirdness-of-todd-akin-darn/article_f9135e2d-a7cc-508a-a544-cf8d5f3bf203.html|title=Horrigan: The world discovers the weirdness of Todd Akin.

In 2010, Akin won re-election with 67.9% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | title = Missouri  | work = Election 2010  | publisher =The New York Times  | url = http://elections.nytimes.com/2010/results/missouri  | doi =   | accessdate = 2010-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had been challenged for the seat by Democratic nominee Arthur Lieber, Libertarian nominee Steve Mosbacher, and write-in candidate Patrick M. Cannon.

===Tenure===
Akin earned a 96% rating from the [[American Conservative Union]] in 2008, and 100% in 2007.&lt;ref name="Barone2010"&gt;{{cite book |last=Barone |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Barone (pundit) |author2=[[Richard E.

For most of his tenure, Akin was listed in the official House roll as "R-St. Louis," even though his district didn't include any portion of the city of St. Louis.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the [http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/olm-112.pdf official House member list] during Akin's last term in the House.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Social issues====
Akin is an outspoken opponent of [[abortion]] in all cases, including health reasons or in cases of [[rape]] or [[incest]], and he opposes [[embryonic stem cell research]]. In a 2008 speech on the House floor, Akin called abortion providers "terrorists" and alleged that it was "common practice" for abortion providers to perform "abortions" on women who were not actually pregnant.&lt;ref name="stl-cbs"&gt;{{cite news | publisher = [[KMOX]] CBS | title = Akin In 2008: Doctors Give Abortions To Patients Who Aren't Pregnant | url = http://stlouis.cbslocal.com/2012/10/03/akin-in-2008-doctors-give-abortions-to-patients-who-arent-pregnant/ | date = October 3, 2012 | accessdate= 2012-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pd-pregnant"&gt;{{cite news | work = [[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]] | title = Long before 'legitimate rape' comment, Akin alleged abortions on non-pregnant women | url = http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/long-before-legitimate-rape-comment-akin-alleged-abortions-on-non/article_f5f0c752-0d72-11e2-b591-0019bb30f31a.html | date = October 3, 2012 | accessdate = 2012-10-03 | first = Kevin | last = McDermott}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Akin is a supporter of the [[right to keep and bear arms]] and has an ''A'' rating from the [[National Rifle Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akin.org/issues/2nd-amendment |title=2nd Amendment &amp;#124; Todd Akin for Senate |publisher=Akin.org |accessdate=2012-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Akin has stated that he has supported many bills including the Second Amendment Sovereignty Act of 2012, The Sportsmen's Heritage Act and the Disaster Recovery Personal Protection Act.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Akin is a staunch advocate of a federal prohibition of [[online poker]]. In 2006, he co-sponsored H.R. 4411, the [[Goodlatte]]-[[Jim Leach|Leach]] Internet Gambling Prohibition Act,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:h.r.04411: |title=Thomas (Library of Congress): HR 4411 |publisher=Thomas.loc.gov |accessdate=2011-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and H.R. 4777, the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:h.r.04777: |title=Thomas (Library of Congress): HR 4777 |publisher=Thomas.loc.gov |accessdate=2011-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Akin also authored the Protect the Pledge (of Allegiance) Act.&lt;ref name="world"/&gt; In late June 2011, Akin objected to [[NBC television|NBC's]] recent removal of the words "under God" from a video clip of school children reciting the [[Pledge of Allegiance (United States)|Pledge of Allegiance]]. After remarking that "NBC has a long record of being very liberal," Akin said, "at the heart of liberalism really is a hatred for God and a belief that government should replace God".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2011/06/28/lawmaker-apologizes-for-liberal-hatred-god-quip/ |publisher=Fox News |title=Lawmaker Apologizes for Liberal 'Hatred of God' Quip |author=Colby Hochmuth |date=June 28, 2011|accessdate=2011-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, Akin said he did not mean all liberals hate God, only that liberals have "a hatred for public references for God." The next day, he apologized, saying his statement had been "directed at the political movement, Liberalism, not at any specific individual".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/article_257a8021-15ab-5006-9245-cca7ad534d62.html |title=Akin changes course, apologizes for comment|publisher=St. Louis Post-Dispatch |author=Jason Hancock |date=June 29, 2011 |accessdate=2011-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his 2012 US Senate bid, Akin reaffirmed his opposition to legislation like the [[Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009]], which he voted against as a Congressman.&lt;ref name="wapo-women"&gt;{{cite news | work = [[Washington Post]] | title = Todd Akin on women's issues in Kansas City campaign stop | first = Diana | last = Reese | date = October 1, 2012 | accessdate = 2012-10-03 | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/she-the-people/wp/2012/10/01/todd-akin-on-womens-issues-in-kansas-city-campaign-stop/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Todd Akin is an opponent of the [[No Child Left Behind Act]]. Akin believes that it should not be the federal government that decides on education, but that local government should have control over public education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akin.org/issues/life |title=2nd Amendment &amp;#124; Todd Akin for Senate |publisher=Akin.org |accessdate=2012-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On MSNBC, Todd Akin opposes [[evolution]]. He was running for the senate seat in Missouri at the time. He has said "I take a look at both sides of the thing and it seems to me that evolution takes a tremendous amount of faith. I don't even see it as a matter of science because I don't know if you can prove....".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51mi7dDbitk NEWSROOMMSNBC], Youtube, NEWSROOMMSNBC&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fiscal issues====
In his early years in Congress, Akin brought back [[earmark (politics)|earmarks]] for his district, voted to raise the debt ceiling, voted for off-balance-sheet wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and voted to create the unfunded Medicare prescription drug benefit.&lt;ref name="world"/&gt; More recently, he has opposed increases in taxation and spending. He voted in 2007 against an expansion of the [[State Children's Health Insurance Program]] (SCHIP), objecting to its potential coverage of children in families making up to $62,000 a year, and stating that proof of U.S. citizenship was not required. He also said the bill would "weaken the private health care system" and lead the country "further down the slippery slope to socialized medicine."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/political-fix/mo-dems-gop-split-over-schip-while-protesters-target-bond/article_8b32e603-2acc-5fa2-a752-8aad7fbd0780.html|title=Mo Dems- GOP split over SCHIP, while protesters target Bond, who backs SCHIP|first=Jo|last=Mannies|date=October 4, 2007|work=St Louis Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has voted against federally funded school breakfasts and lunches, and called student loans "a stage-three cancer of socialism".&lt;ref name="world"/&gt; He has also voted against increasing the minimum wage.&lt;ref name="world"/&gt; He was a vocal critic of the September 2008 bank bailout, and voted against it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=|title=Bailout critic Akin also target of spray-paint vandals |first=Jo|last=Mannies|work=St Louis Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; He voted no on the Affordable Health Care Act in March 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/opinion/columns/the-platform/charting-the-votes-the-money-and-the-uninsured/article_0e70aaf5-0216-5dc8-b64e-f9495a0d50b5.html|title=Charting the votes, the money and the uninsured|work=St Louis Post-Dispatch|date=March 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on Paul Ryan's fiscal year 2012 budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://akin.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1629 |title=Akin Supports Ryan Budget |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120921175558/http://akin.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1629 |archivedate=2012-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Military issues====
Akin has spent time working on military and veterans issues. On the [[House Armed Services Committee]] he served as the Chairman of the Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee, which handles Navy and Air Force issues. He has served as Ranking Republican on the Seapower Subcommittee and the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee. Akin has also introduced veterans-related bills, most notably the Open Burn Pit Registry Act, which creates a registry for [[Iraq War|Iraq]] and  [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]]  veterans who were exposed to [[burn pits]]. He opposed repeal of the Dover Policy, which banned media coverage of caskets of troops returning home from overseas, citing privacy and decorum issues.&lt;ref name="dover"/&gt;

Akin faced McCaskill and Libertarian nominee [[United States Senate election in Missouri, 2012#Libertarian primary|Jonathan Dine]] in the general election, losing to McCaskill after [[#Controversial comments on rape and pregnancy|his controversial comments on rape]] lost him a great deal of support.

===Home of record===
In May 2011, questions were raised about Akin's official address for voting. For most of his political career, Akin had claimed [[Town and Country, Missouri|Town and Country]] as his official residence. However, according to the [[Associated Press]] and  the ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'', Akin moved to [[Wildwood, Missouri|Wildwood]], in far western St. Louis County, sometime between 2007 and 2009, after he and his wife purchased a second home there. However, he continued to vote as a Town and Country resident, and signed a polling place logbook attesting to his living there in April 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/article_a4e87e23-6e54-5f0c-a5fe-28367ef2ba75.html|title=Todd Akin votes in Town and Country|publisher=St. Louis Post-Dispatch website|date= 2011-05-31|accessdate=2011-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kmov.com/news/local/Missouri-Rep-Akin-voting-living-at-different-places-122872884.html |title=Missouri Rep.

{{Main|Rape and pregnancy controversies in United States elections, 2012}}
{{See also|Pregnancy from rape}}

In a local news interview, on August 19, 2012, discussing [[abortion]], Akin claimed that victims of what he described as "legitimate rape" very rarely become [[pregnancy|pregnant]]. Airing on St. Louis television station [[KTVI]], his response to a question on [[rape]] exceptions for [[abortion]] was:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Well you know, people always want to try to make that as one of those things, well how do you, how do you slice this particularly tough sort of ethical question. First of all, from what I understand from doctors, that's really rare. If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.
But let's assume that maybe that didn't work or something. I think there should be some punishment, but the punishment ought to be on the rapist and not attacking the child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jaco|first=Charles|title=The Jaco Report: August 19, 2012|url=http://fox2now.com/2012/08/19/the-jaco-report-august-19-2012/|publisher=Fox News|accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The comments from Akin, which came as he ran for the [[U.S. Senate]] seat held by [[Claire McCaskill]], almost immediately led to widespread uproar. The term "legitimate rape" was called "loathsome" because it suggests that "there are different categories of rape — some real and awful and others that are not".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= The Washington Post Editorial Board |title=The repugnant code behind Todd Akin’s words | date=20 Aug 2012 | URL=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-repugnant-code-behind-todd-akins-words/2012/08/20/7e91ed12-eb08-11e1-a80b-9f898562d010_story.html |accessdate=9 Oct 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others took exception to the phrasing because it suggests that the victims who do become [[Pregnancy from rape|pregnant from rape]] may be [[False accusation of rape|lying]]. His claims about the likelihood of pregnancy resulting from rape were seen by some as being based on fringe ideas like stress-induced [[miscarriage]] or Dr. [[John C.

Akin apologized for his [[political gaffe|gaffe]], saying he "misspoke." His campaign ran an advertisement in which he asked voters to forgive him, saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Rape is an evil act. I used the wrong words in the wrong way and for that I apologize. As the father of two daughters, I want tough justice for predators. I have a compassionate heart for the victims of sexual assault. I pray for them. The fact is, rape can lead to pregnancy. The truth is, rape has many victims.

===Aftermath===
In July 2014, Akin's book, ''Firing Back: Taking on the Party Bosses and Media Elite to Protect Our Faith and Freedom'', was published by [[WND Books]]. In it, he said that he regretted apologizing, because "by asking the public at large for forgiveness, I was validating the willful misinterpretation of what I had said." He also defended his original comments and attacked various Republicans for "wronging" him, including [[Karl Rove]]; former [[National Republican Senatorial Committee]] Executive Director Rob Jesmer; Senators [[Mitch McConnell]], [[John Cornyn]], [[John McCain]], [[Roy Blunt]] and [[Lindsey Graham]]; and House Speaker [[John Boehner]]. He also repeatedly attacked the Republican establishment for seeing his comments "as their opportunity to take [me] out and select someone more palatable to their tastes", and the "[[Media bias in the United States#Liberal bias|liberal media]]" for making him "the target of a media assassination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2014/07/todd-akin-new-book-108745.html#ixzz3CIr617iC |title=Todd Akin returns to national stage |publisher=Politico |date=July 10, 2014 |accessdate=2014-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When his father sought to subdivide the 8.5-acre property in the late 2000s, Akin moved to a house in Wildwood.&lt;ref name="stltoday1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/political-fix/todd-akin-s-deep-beliefs-and-loyal-base-are-hurdle/article_c41d61a4-eb4e-11e1-ad3e-0019bb30f31a.html |title=Akin in Ohio as deadline to exit race passes |publisher=St Louis Today |date=August 21, 2012 |first=Nicholas J.C.|last=Pistor |accessdate=2012-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thomas John "Tom" Dowd''' (October 20, 1925 – October 27, 2002) was an [[United States|American]] [[recording engineer]] and [[record producer|producer]] for [[Atlantic Records]]. He was credited with innovating the [[multitrack recording]] method. Dowd worked on a veritable "who's who" of recordings that encompassed blues, jazz, pop, rock and soul records.

==Career==

=== Early years ===
Born in [[Manhattan]], Dowd grew up playing piano, tuba, violin, and string bass. His mother was an opera singer and his father was a [[concertmaster]].

Dowd graduated from [[Stuyvesant High School]] in June 1942 at the age of 16.&lt;ref name="SoS"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/Oct04/articles/rocketscience.htm |title=The Engineers Who Changed Recording |date=October 2004 |journal=Sound on Sound |last=Daley |first=Dan |accessdate=2007-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued his musical education at [[City College of New York]]. Dowd also played in a band at New York's [[Columbia University]], where he became a [[conducting|conductor]]. He was also employed at the [[physics]] laboratory of Columbia University.

=== Military work ===
At age 18, Dowd was [[Conscription in the United States|drafted]] into the military with the rank of [[sergeant]]. He continued his work in physics at Columbia University. He worked on the [[Manhattan Project]], which developed the [[atomic bomb]]. The purpose of the work was unclear until 1945.&lt;ref name="languageofmusic"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thelanguageofmusic.com/bio_40.HTM |title=Biography |publisher=''Tom Dowd and the Language of Music'' |accessdate=2007-11-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928212802/http://www.thelanguageofmusic.com/bio_40.HTM |archivedate=2007-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dowd planned to obtain a degree in [[nuclear physics]] when he completed his work on the Manhattan Project. However, because his work was top secret, the university did not recognize it, and Dowd decided not to continue, since the university's curriculum would not have been able to further his physics education. His research for the military was more advanced than academic courses at that time.&lt;ref name="languageofmusic"/&gt;

=== Music ===
Dowd took a job at a [[European classical music|classical music]] recording studio until he obtained employment at [[Atlantic Records]]. His first hit was [[Eileen Barton]]'s "[[If I Knew You Were Comin' I'd've Baked a Cake]]". He soon became a top [[audio engineering|recording engineer]] there and recorded popular artists such as [[Ray Charles]], [[the Drifters]], [[the Coasters]], [[The Spinners (American R&amp;B group)|The Spinners]],  [[Ruth Brown]] and [[Bobby Darin]], including Darin's famous rendition of [[Kurt Weill]]/[[Bertolt Brecht]]'s "Mack the Knife". He captured jazz masterpieces by [[John Coltrane]], [[Ornette Coleman]], [[Thelonious Monk]] and [[Charlie Parker]]. It was Dowd's idea to cut Ray Charles' recording of "[[What'd I Say]]" into two parts and release them as the A-side and B-side of the same single record.

Dowd worked as an engineer and producer from the 1940s until the beginning of the 21st century. While working for Atlantic Records, he lived in Westwood, NJ with his wife Jackie and his sons, Steven and Theodore. He recorded albums by many artists including [[Bee Gees]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]], [[Black Oak Arkansas]], [[Derek and the Dominos]], [[Rod Stewart]], [[Wishbone Ash]], [[New Model Army (band)|New Model Army]], [[Cream (band)|Cream]], [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]], [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]], [[the Allman Brothers Band]], [[Joe Bonamassa]], [[the J. Geils Band]], [[Meat Loaf]], [[Sonny &amp; Cher]], [[the Rascals]],  [[The Spinners (American R&amp;B group)|The Spinners]], [[Willie Nelson]], [[Diana Ross]], [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], [[The Four Seasons (band)|the Four Seasons]], [[Kenny Loggins]], [[James Gang]], [[Dusty Springfield]], [[Eddie Harris]], [[Charles Mingus]], [[Herbie Mann]], [[Booker T. &amp; the M.G.'s]], [[Otis Redding]], [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Joe Castro]] and [[Primal Scream]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p72005|pure_url=yes}} |publisher=Allmusic |title=Tom Dowd - Credits |accessdate=2007-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also an employee of [[Apex Studios]] in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="Inc.2002"&gt;{{cite book|title=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OQ0EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA6|accessdate=December 20, 2012|date=November 9, 2002|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|page=6|issn=0006-2510}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dowd received a [[Grammy Trustees Award]] for his lifetime achievements in February 2002.

He died of [[emphysema]] on October 27, 2002, in [[Florida]], where he had been living and working at [[Criteria Studios]] for many years, a week after his 77th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.miaminewtimes.com/2003-01-16/film/soundman-god/|title=Soundman God|last=Norman|first=Forrest|date=January 16, 2003|work=New Times|accessdate=January 7, 2011|location=Miami}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Tom Dowd helped to shape the artists that he worked with, and because he worked with an array of great artists on some of the world's greatest recordings, Dowd was highly influential in creating the sound of the second half of the 20th Century.  It was he who encouraged [[Jerry Wexler]] of [[Atlantic Records]] to install an [[Ampex]] '''eight-track recorder''', enabling Atlantic to be the first recording company to record using multiple tracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| first=Matt
| last= Dobkin
| year= 2004

| isbn=0-312-31828-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dowd is credited as the engineer who popularized the eight-track recording system for commercial music and popularized the use of [[stereophonic sound]]. He also pioneered the use of linear channel faders as opposed to rotary controls on audio mixers.  He devised various methods for altering sound after the initial recording.&lt;ref name="SoS"/&gt;

In 2003 director Mark Moormann premiered an award-winning documentary about his life entitled ''[[Tom Dowd and the Language of Music]]''. In the 2004 biopic ''[[Ray (film)|Ray]]'', Tom Dowd was portrayed by actor [[Rick Gomez]].

Tom Dowd was posthumously inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2012.  The ceremony took place on April 14, 2012, and [[Robbie Robertson]] gave the induction speech.

'''Walter Edward Williams''' (born March 31, 1936) is an American economist, commentator, and academic. He is the John M. Olin Distinguished Professor of Economics at [[George Mason University]], as well as a [[Print syndication|syndicated]] [[columnist]] and [[author]] known for his [[Classical liberalism|classical liberal]] and [[Libertarian conservatism|libertarian conservative]] views.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freemarketmojo.com/?p=4699 Free Market Mojo&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; His writings frequently appear on [[Townhall.com]], [[WorldNetDaily|WND]], and [[Jewish World Review]].

== Early life and education ==
Williams's family during childhood consisted of his mother, his sister, and him. Williams's father played no role in raising Williams or his sister.&lt;ref&gt;Williams ''Up From the Projects  p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;  He grew up in [[Philadelphia]]. The family initially lived in West Philadelphia, moving to North Philadelphia and the Richard Allen [[housing project]]s when Williams was ten years old.  His neighbors included a young [[Bill Cosby]]. Williams knew many of the individuals that Cosby speaks of from his childhood, including Weird Harold and [[Fat Albert]].&lt;ref name=Reason&gt;Root, Damon (2011-01-28) [http://reason.com/archives/2011/01/28/man-versus-the-state Man Versus the State], ''[[Reason magazine|Reason]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Williams was a talented high school student who displayed a very inconsistent performance in his studies. Following high school, he went to California to live with his father and attend one semester at [[Los Angeles City College]].  He later said that he was not ready at that time to be a serious student.&lt;ref&gt;Williams ''Up From the Projects'' p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1959, he was drafted into the military, and served as a [[Private (rank)|Private]] in the [[United States Army]].&lt;ref name=Reason/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams ''Up From the Projects'' p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; While stationed in the South, he "waged a one man battle against [[Jim Crow]] from inside the army". He challenged the racial order with provocative statements to his fellow soldiers. This resulted in an overseeing officer filing a [[court-martial]] proceeding against Williams.  Williams argued his own case and was found not guilty.&lt;ref name=Reason/&gt; While considering filing countercharges against the officer that had brought him up for court martial, Williams found himself transferred to Korea. Upon arriving there, Williams marked "Caucasian" for race on his personnel form.  When challenged on this, Williams replied wryly if he had marked "Black", he would end up getting all the worst jobs. From Korea, Williams wrote a letter to President John F. Kennedy denouncing the pervasive racism in the American government and military and questioning the actions black Americans should take given the state of affairs, writing:

{{quote|Should Negroes be relieved of their service obligation or continue defending and dying for empty promises of freedom and equality?  Or should we demand human rights as our Founding Fathers did at the risk of being called extremists ... I contend that we relieve ourselves of oppression in a manner that is in keeping with the great heritage of our nation.&lt;ref name=Reason/&gt;}}

He received a reply from the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense, [[Alfred B. Fitt]], a response which he termed "the most reasonable response that I received from any official."&lt;ref&gt;Williams "Up From The Projects" pp. 63–65&lt;/ref&gt;

Williams was described as follows by [[Richard W. Rahn]] in a December 20, 2010 ''[[The Washington Times|Washington Times]]'' column:&lt;blockquote&gt;Friends who knew Mr. Williams long before I did have told me that he, by manner and dress, was viewed as a black radical during his earlier student days. He also freely confesses to having been a troublemaker when he was in the Army and elsewhere. But unlike others less wise, Mr. Williams grew to understand that he could do far more for both his black brothers and sisters and all other Americans by teaching them how free markets don't discriminate on the basis of race, religion or national origin, and hence lead to the greatest opportunity and prosperity for all.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Following his military service, Williams re-entered college as a far more motivated student. Williams earned a bachelor's degree (1965) in Economics from California State College at Los Angeles (now [[California State University, Los Angeles]]). He earned both his master's degree (1967) and his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] (1972) in Economics from the [[University of California, Los Angeles]]. Speaking of his early college days, Williams says "I was more than anything a radical. I was more sympathetic to Malcolm X than Martin Luther King because Malcolm X was more of a radical who was willing to confront discrimination in ways that I thought it should be confronted, including perhaps the use of violence.  But I really just wanted to be left alone. I thought some laws, like minimum-wage laws, helped poor people and poor black people and protected workers from exploitation. I thought they were a good thing until I was pressed by professors to look at the evidence."  While at UCLA, Williams came into contact with economists such as [[Armen Alchian]], [[James M. Buchanan]], and [[Axel Leijonhufvud]] who challenged his assumptions.  Never one to be over-awed by others, Williams regularly challenged his professors as well.  But on examining the evidence of actual outcomes, he came to believe such laws are abject failures.  "I learned that you have to evaluate the effects of public policy as opposed to intentions."&lt;ref name=Riley/&gt;

While Williams was at UCLA, [[Thomas Sowell]] arrived on campus in 1969 as a visiting professor. Although he never took a class from Dr. Sowell, the two met and began a friendship that has lasted for decades. In the summer of 1972, Sowell was hired as director of the Urban Institute's Ethnic Minorities Project, which Williams joined shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;Williams ''Up From The Projects'' pp. 91–93&lt;/ref&gt; Correspondence between Sowell and Williams appears in the 2007 "A Man of Letters" piece by Sowell.

== Academic career ==
Williams has been a professor of economics at George Mason University since 1980, and was chairman of the University's Economics department from 1995 to 2001.

He had previously been on the faculty of [[Los Angeles City College]], California State University – Los Angeles, [[Temple University]], and [[Grove City College]]. Williams was awarded an honorary degree at [[Universidad Francisco Marroquin]].

== Writing career ==
Williams has written ten books and hundreds of articles. His syndicated column is published weekly in approximately 140 newspapers across the [[United States]], as well as on several [[web site]]s by [[Creators Syndicate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://econfaculty.gmu.edu/wew/vita.html | title = Walter E. Williams Biographical Sketch | work = [[George Mason University]] | accessdate = 2011-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote and hosted documentaries for [[PBS]] in 1985. The "Good Intentions" documentary was based on his book ''The State Against Blacks''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://econfaculty.gmu.edu/wew/vita.html
|title=Biography, Walter E. Williams|author=George Mason University|date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2017, the Drudge Report dropped the link to Walter E. Williams' weekly column.  No reason was known for the exclusion.  However, the link was reinstated in August 2017.

== Economic and political views ==
As an [[economist]], Williams is a proponent of [[free market]] economics and opposes [[Socialism|socialist]] systems of government intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Williams ''More Liberty Means Less Government'' pp. 42–44&lt;/ref&gt; Williams believes laissez-faire capitalism is the most moral, most productive system humans have ever devised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fee.org/the_freeman/detail/capitalism-and-the-common-man | title = Capitalism and the Common Man | author = Williams, Walter | date = August 25, 1997 | accessdate = March 20, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-to-late 1970s, Williams conducted research into the [[Davis-Bacon Act]] of 1931 and on the impact of minimum wage laws on minority employment. His research led him to conclude the government's interventional programs are harmful. Among those state programs Williams was critical of were [[minimum wage]] and [[affirmative action]] laws, stating both practices inhibit liberty and are detrimental to the blacks they are intended to help. He published his results in his 1982 book ''The State Against Blacks'', where he argued that laws regulating economic activity are far greater obstacles to economic progress for blacks than racial bigotry and discrimination.&lt;ref name=Riley&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704881304576094221050061598|title=The State Against Blacks|last=Riley|first=Jason|date=January 22, 2011|work=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Williams has spoken on the topic and penned a number of articles detailing his view that increases in the minimum wage price low skill workers out of the market, eliminating their opportunities for employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://theoaklandpress.com/articles/2010/12/03/opinion/doc4cf9a5e18f435702667011.txt | work=The Oakland Press | title=Opinion: Minimum wage's effect is universal in all parts of U.S. | first=Walter E. | last=Williams | date=December 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | work=Deseret News | url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700024309/Minimum-wage-increases-hurt-not-help-workers.html | title=Opinion: Minimum wage increases hurt, not help, workers | first=Walter E. | last=Williams | date=April 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://www.ncpa.org/sub/dpd/index.php?Article_ID=1473 | work=Investors Business Daily | title=Minimum Wage Is Not An Anti-Poverty Tool| last=Williams|first=Walter E. |date=March 24, 2005  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4Ubp7U9Dq4 | work=Radio Interview | title=Williams With Sowell – Minimum Wage, Maximum Folly | first=Walter E. | last=Williams | date=April 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams believes that [[racism]] and the legacy of [[slavery]] in the United States are overemphasized as problems faced by the black community today. He points to the crippling effects of a welfare state and the disintegration of the black family as more pressing concerns. "The welfare state has done to black Americans what slavery couldn't do, and that is to destroy the black family."&lt;ref name=Riley/&gt; Although in favor of equal access to government institutions such as court houses, city halls, and libraries, Williams opposes anti-discrimination laws directed at the private sector on the grounds that such laws infringe upon the people's right of [[freedom of association]].

Williams views [[Gun politics in the United States|gun control]] laws as a governmental infringement upon the rights of individuals, and argues that they end up endangering the innocent while failing to reduce crime.&lt;ref&gt;Williams ''More Liberty Means Less Government'' pp. 59–61&lt;/ref&gt; Williams also makes the argument that the true proof of whether or not an individual [[Ownership|owns]] something is whether or not they have the right to sell it. Taking this argument to its conclusion, he supports legalization of [[Organ sale|selling one's own bodily organs]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams ''More Liberty Means Less Government'' pp. 138–140&lt;/ref&gt;  He argues that government prohibiting the selling of one's bodily organs is an infringement upon one's property rights, asking "If I don't own my organs, please tell me who does?"&lt;ref&gt;Williams ''More Liberty Means Less Government''  p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics/wew/articles/fee/organs.html|title = My Organs Are For Sale|author = Williams, Walter|accessdate=October 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding [[New Federalism|federalism]], Williams is in favor of power being in the hands of the states, with limited powers being held by the Federal government. He notes this was the design of the nation's founding documents, which were largely undermined by the events of the Civil War:

{{quote|The War between the States settled by force whether states could secede. Once it was established that states cannot secede, the federal government, abetted by a Supreme Court unwilling to hold it to its constitutional restraints, was able to run amok over states' rights, so much so that the protections of the Ninth and Tenth Amendments mean little or nothing today. Not only did the war lay the foundation for eventual nullification or weakening of basic constitutional protections against central government abuses, but it also laid to rest the great principle enunciated in the Declaration of Independence that 'Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the [[consent of the governed]].'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=DiLorenzo |first=Thomas |date=2003 |title=The Real Lincoln: A New Look at Abraham Lincoln, His Agenda, and an Unnecessary War |chapter=Foreword |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5B9qs5dAnuwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |others=Foreword by Walter Williams |location=New York, New York |publisher=Three Rivers Press |page=xii-xiii |isbn=0-7615-2646-3 |accessdate=December 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In light of the founding documents, Williams concludes it is the right of U.S. states to [[secede]] from the union if they so wish, as several states attempted to do during the [[United States Civil War|Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://archive.lewrockwell.com/orig2/w-williams1.html | title = DiLorenzo Is Right About Lincoln | author = Williams, Walter | work = [[LewRockwell.com]] | date = March 22, 2005 | accessdate = April 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has gone on record as advocating the [[Free State Project]] in at least two columns and once on television. The Williams endorsement correlated with the largest single membership jump in the first 5000 phase{{clarify|date=November 2015}} of the project, a jump even higher than the results of the project being [[Slashdot effect|slashdotted]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Williams believes programs such as affirmative action and minimum wage laws set up to aid minorities have, in fact, been harmful to them and stifled their ability to advance in society. "Affirmative action has led to, I believe, many Black people expecting favors from the system and not working as hard as they otherwise would. That is, if you know that you can get into college because of affirmative action—or some people call it diversity nowadays—well then why work as hard in high school? So it might undermine some of the spirit of people. And I think that the basic premise of those who advocate affirmative action is that the problems that Black Americans face today are the result of racial discrimination." In reaction to what he viewed as inappropriate racial sensitivity that he saw hurting blacks in higher education, Williams began in the 1970s to offer colleagues a "certificate of amnesty and pardon" to all white people for Western Civilization's sins against blacks – and "thus obliged them not to act like damn fools in their relationships with Americans of African ancestry." He still offers it to anyone. The certificate can be obtained at his website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://econfaculty.gmu.edu/wew/gift.pdf|title=Gift of Amnesty and Pardon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Williams is opposed to the Federal Reserve System.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jewishworldreview.com/cols/williams110409.php3#.UI8U_2cqlbI|title=Walter Williams|work=jewishworldreview.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also compared U.S. monetary policy to "counterfeiting":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://townhall.com/columnists/walterewilliams/2008/12/17/counterfeiting_versus_monetary_policy/page/full/|title=Counterfeiting Versus Monetary Policy|work=townhall.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Knowing the dangers posed by central banks, we might ask whether our country needs the Federal Reserve Bank. Whenever I'm told that we need this or that government program, I always ask what we did before. It turns out that we did without a central bank from 1836, when President Andrew Jackson closed the Second Bank of the United States, to 1913 when [[Federal Reserve Act]] was written. During that interval, we prospered and became one of the world's major economic powers."

In his work, Williams builds on the economic theories of [[F. A. Hayek]], [[Ludwig von Mises]], [[Henry Hazlitt]], and [[Milton Friedman]],&lt;ref&gt;Williams  ''Up From the Projects'' p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the previously mentioned Thomas Sowell, and he has said of [[Ayn Rand]]'s 1967 work ''Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal'' that it is "one of the best defenses and explanations of capitalism one is likely to read."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://econfaculty.gmu.edu/wew/readings.html | work=Walter Williams Homepage | title=Book Recommendations| last=Williams|first=Walter E. }}(ret'd. 12-30-2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides his weekly columns, Williams has become known nationally as a highly popular guest host before the twenty million listeners of the [[Rush Limbaugh]] [[The Rush Limbaugh Show|radio program]] when Limbaugh is away traveling. ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'' has called Williams "one of the country's leading libertarian voices."&lt;ref name=Reason/&gt; In 2009, Greg Ransom, a writer for the [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]], ranked Williams as the third-most important "[[Friedrich Hayek|Hayekian]]" Public Intellectual in America, behind only [[Thomas Sowell]] and [[John Stossel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Top 30 Hayekian Public Intellectuals In America | url = http://blog.mises.org/9727/the-top-30-hayekian-public-intellectuals-in-america/ | author = Ransom, Greg | date = April 2, 2009 | accessdate = November 16, 2010 | work = Mises Economics Blog, [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Williams and his wife Connie (née Taylor) were married from 1960 until her death on December 29, 2007. They had one daughter, Devon. Williams is a cousin of former [[NBA]] player [[Julius Erving]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heymiller.com/2011/03/walter-williams/|title=Walter Williams|work=heymiller.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Williams served on the board of directors of Media General from 2001 until his retirement from the board in 2011. He was also chairman of the Audit Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://people.equilar.com/bio/walter-williams-media-general-/salary/434856|title=Walter E.
