The '''2007 Yap Islands Zika virus outbreak''' represented the first time [[Zika virus]] had been detected outside [[Africa]] and [[Asia]]. It occurred in the [[Yap Islands]], an island chain in the [[Federated States of Micronesia]]. Zika virus (ZIKV) is a [[vector (epidemiology)|vector]]-borne [[flavivirus]] in the same family as [[yellow fever]], [[Dengue fever|dengue]], [[West Nile virus|West Nile]] and [[Japanese encephalitis virus]]es.&lt;ref name="Hayes2009"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/15/9/09-0442 | title=Zika virus outside Africa | publisher=[[Center for Disease Control and Prevention]] | date=September 2009 | last=Hayes | first=Edward B. | journal=[[Emerging Infectious Diseases]] | volume=15 | issue=9 | pages=1347–1350 | issn=1080-6059 | doi=10.3201/eid1509.090442 | pmc=2819875 | pmid=19788800}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The emergence of zika virus"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.jgid.org/text.asp?2016/8/1/3/176140 | title=The emergence of zika virus as a global health security threat: A review and a consensus statement of the INDUSEM Joint working Group (JWG) | date=11 February 2016 | last=Sikka | first=Veronica | last2=Chattu | first2=Vijay Kumar | last3=Popli | first3=Raaj K. | last4=Galwankar | first4=Sagar C. | last5=Kelkar | first5=Dhanashree | last6=Sawicki | first6=Stanley G. | last7=Stawicki | first7=Stanislaw P. | last8=Papadimos | first8=Thomas J. | journal=Journal of Global Infectious Diseases | volume=8 | issue=1 | pages=3–15 | language=en | issn=0974-8245 | doi=10.4103/0974-777X.176140 | pmid=27013839 | display-authors=3 | pmc=4785754}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Epidemiology ==

In 2007, physicians in the Yap Islands reported to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] an [[outbreak]] of an illness characterized by [[rash]], [[conjunctivitis]], and [[arthralgia]]. Initial serum testing revealed some patients had the IgM antibody against dengue virus, yet the patients' signs and symptoms were clinically distinct from dengue fever. Subsequent retesting using consensus primers detected the presence of Zika virus RNA.&lt;ref name="NEJM"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Duffy |first1=Mark R. |last2=Chen |first2=Tai-Ho |last3=Hancock |first3=W. Thane |display-authors=etal |title=Zika virus outbreak on Yap Islands, Federated States of Micronesia |journal=[[New England Journal of Medicine]] |volume=360 |issue=24 |pages=2536–43 |date=11 June 2009 |url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa0805715 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa0805715 |pmid=19516034}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A household survey was conducted to determine the proportion of Yap residents with the IgM antibody against Zika virus and to identify possible mosquito vectors of Zika virus. In total, the Yap Islands outbreak had 49 confirmed and 59 probable cases of Zika virus disease. The patients resided in 9 of the 10 municipalities on Yap. None of the patients required hospitalization. No hemorrhagic manifestations occurred and no deaths resulted. It was estimated that 73% (95% confidence interval, 68 to 77) of Yap residents 3 years of age or older had been recently infected with Zika virus. ''[[Aedes hensilli]]'' was the predominant mosquito species identified.&lt;ref name="NEJM" /&gt;

The outbreak of [[Zika fever]] in [[Micronesia]] demonstrated the transmission of Zika virus outside Africa and Asia. This was considered a significant finding in that previously only 14 cases of Zika virus had been documented since the virus was first identified in 1947. Prior to the Yap Islands outbreak, no previous outbreaks of Zika virus had ever been reported and only 14 cases had been documented since the virus was first isolated in 1947. All previous cases had occurred within Africa and Asia.&lt;ref name="NEJM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The emergence of zika virus" /&gt;

== Reservoir ==
''[[Aedes aegypti]]'' has been recognized as the vector of Zika virus. The virus was first isolated in 1947 from a [[Sentinel species|sentinel]] [[Rhesus macaque|rhesus monkey]] stationed on a tree platform in the Zika forest, Uganda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Philip S. |last=Corbet |title=Observations on Mosquitoes Ovipositing in Small Containers in Zika Forest, Uganda |journal=[[Journal of Animal Ecology]] |publisher=[[British Ecological Society]] |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=141–164 |date=February 1964  |jstor=2354 |doi=10.2307/2354}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The emergence of zika virus" /&gt;

== Transmission ==
Transmission is typically via the bite of the ''Aedes aegypti'' mosquito, although in this outbreak, ''Aedes hensilli'' was the predominant mosquito species identified.&lt;ref name="NEJM" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=S.D.K. |last=Sempala |title=Seasonal population dynamics of the immature stages of ''Aedes africanus'' (Theobald) (Diptera: Culicidae) in Zika Forest, Uganda |date=March 1983 |volume=73 |issue=1 |pages=11–18 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract;jsessionid=2C41D3D5E7CBA35498615FAA46804BCD.journals?fromPage=online&amp;aid=2379708 |journal=[[Bulletin of Entomological Research]] |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |doi=10.1017/S0007485300013742 |accessdate=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Abortion Rights Campaign''' (ARC) is an Irish [[Abortion-rights movements|pro-choice]] group. Its  main aim is the introduction of free, safe and legal abortion care in Ireland and Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Abortion Rights Campaign |title=Submission to the Citizens' Assembly |date=2016-12-15 |pages=1 |url=https://issuu.com/abortionrightscampaign/docs/citizens_assembly_front |accessdate=22 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A significant aim prior to May 2018 was the repeal of the Eighth Amendment of the Irish Constitution, which was achieved by the successful passing of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty-sixth_Amendment_of_the_Constitution_Bill_2018 Thirty-Sixth Amendment 2018]. ARC also campaigns for the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] to introduce extensive abortion legislation in common with the rest of the United Kingdom and "to ensure the health of women in pregnancy is protected in line with international human rights standards".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = About ARC {{!}} Abortion Rights Campaign Ireland|url = http://www.abortionrightscampaign.ie/about-arc/|website = www.abortionrightscampaign.ie|accessdate = 2015-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; ARC supports the full decriminalisation of abortion in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Abortion must be fully decriminalised |url=https://www.abortionrightscampaign.ie/2018/01/16/abortion-must-be-fully-decriminalised/ |website=Abortion Rights Campaign Blog |accessdate=22 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Abortion Rights Campaign was formed on 10 July 2012, when 40 people came together. Initially formed as the Irish Choice Network, after another meeting in the [[Gresham Hotel]] in [[Dublin]] on 8 December 2012 and another meeting in 19 January 2013 the Abortion Rights Campaign was formally launched. It has organised the annual March for Choice in Dublin since 2013.

Many Irish politicians have supported ARC's aims, such as [[Richard Boyd Barrett]] ([[Anti-Austerity Alliance–People Before Profit]]), [[Catherine Murphy (politician)|Catherine Murphy]] ([[Social Democrats (Ireland)|Social Democrats]]), [[Mick Wallace]], [[Joan Collins (politician)|Joan Collins]] and [[Clare Daly]] ([[Independents 4 Change]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Kitty Holland |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/march-for-choice-attracts-thousands-in-dublin-1.1944267 |title=March For Choice Attracts Thousands In Dublin |publisher=[[Irish Times]] |date=2014-09-27 |accessdate=2015-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However ARC itself is not affiliated with any political party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Abortion Rights Campaign |title=ARC is not affiliated to any political party |url=https://www.abortionrightscampaign.ie/2017/11/22/arc-is-not-affiliated-to-any-political-party/ |accessdate=22 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ARC was one of the main partner organisations in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Together_for_Yes Together for Yes], the civil society group advocating a Yes vote in the 2018 referendum. One of ARC's founding members was a co-director of Together for Yes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.togetherforyes.ie/about-us/our-executive/|title=Together for Yes Executive|last=|first=|date=|website=Together for Yes|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ARC's network of regional groups across the island of Ireland formed the basis for many Together for Yes groups in several counties in Ireland. 

In January 2016, they received a grant of €23,000 from [[Open Society Foundation]] for "educational and stigma-busting projects." [[Standards in Public Office Commission|SIPO]] reasoned that the money had been raised for a political purpose. The ARC returned the money in November 2016, while disagreeing with the finding. The story was first published in ''[[The Irish Catholic]]'' in late March 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/abortion-rights-campaign-group-returns-us-donation-after-sipo-warning-1.3033589|newspaper=The Irish Times|title=Abortion Rights Campaign group returns US donation after SIPO warning|date=1 April 2017|first=Aine|last=McMahon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=TheJournal.ie|url=https://www.thejournal.ie/abortion-rights-campaign-return-e23000-to-foreign-donor-3316866-Apr2017/|title=Abortion Rights Campaign gives back €23,000 US donation|date=1 April 2017|first=Gráinne|last=Ní Aodha}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|user=freesafelegal|number=848161372441628672|date=1 April 2017|title=Abortion Rights Campaign gives back €23,000 US donation (via @thejournal_ie)|author=Abortion Rights IE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Irish Catholic]]|url=http://irishcatholic.ie/article/pro-repeal-group-return-billionaire%E2%80%99s-cash-after-ethics-watchdog-probe|title=Pro-repeal group return billionaire’s cash after ethics watchdog probe|date=30 March 2017|first=Greg|last=Daly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
ARC is an all-volunteer, non-hierarchical organisation. Membership elect a Convening Group annually, which convenes a Steering Group made up of representatives of several working groups and regional groups. Ongoing decision-making is carried out by the Steering Group during regular meetings. There is no one leader or spokesperson of ARC as the Convening and Working Group roles change on a regular basis. This structure is designed to encourage engagement and activity by all members, and to avoid power hierarchies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Abortion Rights Campaign |title=Annual Report 2015 |date=2017-12-06 |pages=8-9 |url=https://www.abortionrightscampaign.ie/2017/12/06/our-annual-report-2015/ |accessdate=22 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==March for Choice==
The Abortion Rights Campaign's most visible event is the annual March for Choice, normally held on the [http://www.september28.org/ Global Day of Action for Safe and Legal Access to Abortion]. The March is organised by ARC and attended by the public, as well as various national pro-choice groups, including trade unions such as [[Unite the Union|Unite]], [[Mandate (trade union)|Mandate]], [[Teachers Union of Ireland]], [[National Union of Journalists]] and [[Union of Students in Ireland]], political parties including [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour]], [[Solidarity–People Before Profit]], and the [[Social Democrats (Ireland)|Social Democrats]], and international groups such as [[Catholics for Choice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Kitty Holland |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/march-for-choice-attracts-thousands-in-dublin-1.1944267 |title=‘March for Choice’ attracts thousands in Dublin |publisher=[[Irish Times]] |date=2014-09-27 |accessdate=2015-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Mary Carolan |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/campaign-for-legal-abortions-says-new-laws-too-restrictive-1.1542611 |title=Campaign for legal abortions says new laws too restrictive |publisher=[[Irish Times]] |date=2013-09-27 |accessdate=2015-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most recent March for Choice was held on 29 September 2018, the first since the vote to repeal the Eighth Amendment.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thejournal.ie/march-for-choice-dublin-2-4260824-Sep2018/|title=Large crowds as March for Choice takes place in Dublin|last=Barry|first=Aoife|date=2018-09-29|work=The Journal|access-date=22 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theme was 'Free Safe Legal', the slogan of ARC, and was chosen to "show [their] support for stigma-free abortion access for anyone who wants or needs one, regardless of their financial or legal status".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.abortionrightscampaign.ie/2018/09/16/march-for-choice-29th-september/|title=March for Choice 29th September|last=|first=|date=2018-09-16|website=Abortion Rights Campaign|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=22 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speakers included ARC co-conveners Sarah Monaghan and Denise O'Toole, Zanele Sibindi of Movement of Asylum Seekers in Ireland, Evie Nevin of Disabled Women for Yes and Emma Campbell and Kellie O'Dowd from the Belfast-based Alliance for Choice.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The 2017 March for Choice was held on 30 September and over 40,000 people took part. The rally at the march's conclusion was addressed by [[Bernadette Devlin McAliskey]].  Additional "sympathy marches" were held in 20 cities around the world, including London, Sydney and Nicosia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rte.ie/news/ireland/2017/0930/908737-march-for-choice/|title=Tens of thousands take part in March for Choice rally|publisher=RTÉ|date=30 September 2017|accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/thousands-attend-dublin-abortion-rights-protest-1.3239832|title=Thousands attend Dublin abortion rights protest|publisher=The Irish Times|date=30 September 2017|accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Acoustic wayfinding''' is the practice of using the [[auditory system]] to orient oneself and navigate physical space.  It is commonly used by the [[Visual impairment|visually impaired]], allowing them to retain their mobility without relying on visual cues from their environment.

==Method==
Acoustic wayfinding involves using a variety of auditory cues to create a [[Cognitive map|mental map]] of the surrounding environment.  This can include a number of techniques: navigating by sounds from the natural environment, such as pedestrian crossing signals; [[Echolocation (human)|echolocation]], or creating sound waves (by tapping a cane or making clicking noises) to determine the location and size of surrounding objects; and memorizing the unique sounds in a given space to recognize it again later.  For the visually impaired, these auditory cues become the primary substitute for visual information about the direction and distance of people and objects in their environment.&lt;ref name="GolledgeStimson1997"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Reginald G. Golledge|author2=Robert John Stimson|title=Spatial behavior: a geographic perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2JPMvpMbLrMC&amp;pg=PA508|accessdate=24 September 2011|year=1997|publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=978-1-57230-050-7|page=508}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Detectable Warnings.jpg|thumb|left|Visually impaired person using a cane to navigate a city street]]

However, there are a number of common obstacles to acoustic wayfinding techniques: noisy outdoor environments can challenge an individual's ability to identify useful sounds, while indoors, the architecture may not provide an acoustic response which is useful for orientation and destination.  Among the most difficult environments to navigate for individuals who rely on acoustic wayfinding are crowded places like department stores, transit stations, and hotel lobbies, or open spaces like parking lots and parks, where distinct sound cues are lacking.  This means that, in practice, individuals who navigate primarily by acoustic wayfinding must also rely on a number of other senses – including touch, smell, and residual sight – to supplement auditory cues.&lt;ref name="Portugali1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Juval Portugali|title=The construction of cognitive maps|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qeBXM0m9rqQC&amp;pg=PA230|accessdate=24 September 2011|year=1996|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-7923-3949-6|page=230}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These different methods can be used in tandem.  For example, visually impaired individuals often use a [[white cane]], not only to physically locate obstacles in front of them, but also to acoustically get a sense of what those obstacles may be.&lt;ref name="Truax2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Barry Truax|title=Acoustic communication|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u5N6We_rw1wC&amp;pg=PA21|accessdate=24 September 2011|year=2001|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-56750-536-8|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By tapping the cane, they also create sound waves that help them to gauge the location and size of nearby objects.

Recently{{when|date=January 2017}}, architects and acousticians have begun to address the problems faced by people who rely primarily on acoustic wayfinding to navigate urban spaces.&lt;ref name="Wayarch"&gt;{{cite book | title=Wayfinding: people, signs, and architecture | publisher=McGraw-Hill Book Co. | author=Arthur, Paul and Romedi Passini | year=1992 | isbn=0-07-551016-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The primary work on the architectural implications of acoustic wayfinding comes from a collaboration between Christopher Downey, an architect who went blind in 2008 and has since worked to improve architectural design for the visually impaired,&lt;ref name="Atlantic-design"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/10/design-within-reach/8220/ | title=Design Within Reach: A blind architect relearns his craft | publisher=The Atlantic Monthly Group | date=October 2010 | accessdate=24 September 2011 | author=McGray, Douglas}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Joshua Cushner, who leads the Acoustic consulting practice for engineering design firm [[Arup Group Limited|Arup]] in San Francisco.   Their work focuses on how to plan new facilities to include sensible systems of sound markers and architectural spaces which provide orientation through acoustic cues.  On 20 September 2011, the San Francisco chapter of the [[American Institute of Architects]] organized an acoustic wayfinding discussion and walking tour,&lt;ref name="Dwell"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dwell.com/articles/sfs-architecture-and-the-city.html | title=SF's Architecture and the City | publisher=Dwell Media LLC | date=5 September 2011 | accessdate=24 September 2011 | author=Britt, Aaron}}&lt;/ref&gt; led by Chris Downey and Joshua Cushner.  The purpose of the tour was to highlight the ways that visual impaired people associate sounds with particular buildings and locations, creating "sound markers" that help them find their way on the street or indoors, and to discuss implementing more unique sound markers into urban design projects.&lt;ref name="Arch-and-city"&gt;{{cite press_release | title=Architecture and the city festival guide | publisher=AIASF | date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4558">[[File:Apple for Health - Apple with Stethoscope (16348686815).jpg|thumb|It is commonly believed that apple consumption has health benefits.]]
'''"An apple a day keeps the doctor away"''' is a common English-language proverb of Welsh origin. It espouses the [[Traditional knowledge|folk-wisdom]] that [[apple]] consumption (or consumption of [[fruits]] and [[vegetables]] in general) has identifiable health benefits.

==Origin==
First recorded in the 1860s, the proverb originated in [[Wales]], and was particularly prevalent in [[Pembrokeshire]]. The original wording of the saying was "Eat an apple on going to bed, and you’ll keep the doctor from earning his bread." The current phrasing, "An apple a day keeps the doctor away", began usage at the end of the 19th century, &lt;ref name="wapo"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/wellness/history-behind-an-apple-a-day/2013/09/24/aac3e79c-1f0e-11e3-94a2-6c66b668ea55_story.html | title=History behind ‘An apple a day’ | work=Washington Post | date=24 September 2013 | accessdate=5 December 2015 | author=Ely, Margaret}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An apple a day keeps the doctor away|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOkif_tTGtk}}&lt;/ref&gt; early print examples found as early as 1899.&lt;ref name="CtryGtlmn"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Google Books Search Results|url=https://www.google.ru/search?tbs=sbd%3A1%2Ccdr%3A1%2Ccd_max%3A12%2F31%2F1910&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=%22an+apple+a+day%22|accessdate=11 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The background for the proverb was that at bedtime it was served either a fried apple filled with [[caraway]] seeds or a fresh apple with caraway seeds stuck in the apple.&lt;ref name="Borgen"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Annemarta  Borgen |title=Urtehagen på Knatten |date=1973 |publisher=Gyldendal |isbn=8205060118 |pages=37-38 |url=https://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2007071701094;page=38 |language=Norwegian |chapter=Innenlandske ville kryddurter: Karve |quote=Opprinnelsen til ordspråket om at "an apple a day keeps the doctor away" er at ved sengetid ble det før servert enten et stekt eple fylt med karve eller et friskt gjennomstukket med karve. Eplet var der for at folk skulle få mest mulig karve i seg.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Caraway was considered very healthy and the apple was a way to eat as much caraway as possible.&lt;ref name="Borgen"/&gt;

==Scientific evaluation==
A 2011 study found that consumption of apples and pears might prevent [[stroke]]s.&lt;ref name=wapo/&gt; A 2012 study found that apple consumption significantly lowered [[bad cholesterol]] levels in middle-aged adults.&lt;ref name=wapo/&gt; In 2013, the ''BMJ'' published a study as part of its humorous Christmas issue comparing the effects of prescribing everyone in the UK over age 50 either an apple or a [[statin]] a day. The study concluded that both interventions would be similarly effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Briggs|first1=A. D. M.|last2=Mizdrak|first2=A.|last3=Scarborough|first3=P.|title=A statin a day keeps the doctor away: comparative proverb assessment modelling study|journal=BMJ|date=17 December 2013|volume=347|issue=dec17 2|pages=f7267–f7267|doi=10.1136/bmj.f7267|lay-url=https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2013/12/18/255219148/an-apple-a-day-keeps-the-doctor-away-and-statins-do-too}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A 2015 study looked directly at the relationship between apple consumption and physician visits and found no evidence that the proverb was true. The study did, however, find that people who ate an apple a day did use fewer prescription medications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davis|first1=Matthew A.|last2=Bynum|first2=Julie P. W.|last3=Sirovich|first3=Brenda E.|title=Association Between Apple Consumption and Physician Visits|journal=JAMA Internal Medicine|date=1 May 2015|volume=175|issue=5|pages=777|doi=10.1001/jamainternmed.2014.5466|lay-url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/does-an-apple-a-day-really-keep-the-doctor-away/|pmc=4420713}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a 2011 study found that adding one ‘[[Golden Delicious]]’ apple to the daily diet of a small group of overweight men led to higher levels of LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. The results were attributed to the higher sugar and low-phenolic content of ‘Golden Delicious’ apples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/oct/04/gardens-truth-about-apples-james-wong | title=Gardens: the truth about apples | work=The Guardian | date=4 October 2015 | accessdate=16 April 2016 | author=James, Wong}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bernard Norman Barwin''' is a [[general practitioner]] and medical professor. He was appointed to the [[Order of Canada]] in 1997, but resigned the award in 2013 after admitting to professional misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/norman-barwin-sperm-class-action-lawsuit-1.3832572|title=Former Ottawa doctor impregnated 2 women with his own sperm, lawsuit alleges - CBC News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==

Barwin was born in [[South Africa]]. He attended [[Queen's University]] in [[Northern Ireland]] to complete his Medical Degree, graduating in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cpso.on.ca/docsearch/details.aspx?view=9&amp;id=%2028666|title=Doctor Details {{!}} Public Register Info {{!}} College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

Barwin was director of the High Risk Pregnancy Clinic and co-director of the [[Ottawa General Hospital]]'s fertility clinic. He left in 1984 because he was not a certified gynaecologist in Canada. He would then establish his own clinic, though still licensed as a general physician.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2013/02/04/wrongsperm_doctor_barwin_took_shortcuts_in_career_and_races_too_dimanno.html|title=Wrong-sperm doctor Barwin took shortcuts in career and races, too|last=DiManno|first=Rosie|date=|website=Toronto Star|publisher=|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the Associate Professor of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at the [[University of Ottawa]]. He was also one of the founding members of Fertility Self-Help Group (ISSG), which later became the Infertility Awareness Association of Canada. He also founded Canadians for Choice and has been President since 2004. In addition, he was the President of the Canadian Fertility Society, the [[Planned Parenthood]] Federation of Canada and Planned Parenthood Ottawa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canadiansforchoice.ca/scholarship.html Canadians for Choice&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312153526/http://www.canadiansforchoice.ca/scholarship.html |date=March 12, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Barwin was appointed to the [[Order of Canada]] for having a "profound impact on both the biological and psycho-social aspects of women's reproductive health."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 2009, he was awarded the [[Honorary degree]] of [[Doctor of Laws]] from [[Carleton University]].&lt;ref&gt;https://carleton.ca/senate/honorary-degrees/honorary-degrees-awarded-since-1954/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Professional misconduct ==
In 1995, Loree-Ann Huard and Wanda Cowton sued Barwin for allegedly using the wrong sperm donor.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/parenting/sperm-donor-mix-up-where-do-these-two-girls-come-from/article570411/|title=Sperm donor mix-up: Where do these two girls come from?|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple and Barwin settled out of court in 1998.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 2010, two former patients of Barwin brought lawsuits against him alleging that he had inseminated them with the wrong sperm.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In January 2013, Barwin admitted to professional misconduct in regards to four women who were artificially inseminated with the wrong sperm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2013/01/31/fertility_expert_dr_norman_barwin_admits_impregnating_women_with_the_wrong_sperm.html|title=After impregnating women with wrong sperm, a grudging apology from 'baby God'|last=DiManno|first=Rosie|date=|website=Toronto Star|publisher=|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2013/01/31/bernard-norman-barwin-suspended-wrong-sperm_n_2592710.html|title=Doctor Suspended For Inseminating Women With Wrong Sperm|website=The Huffington Post|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/fertility-doctor-suspended-admits-to-4th-sperm-mixup-1.1398706|title=Fertility doctor suspended, admits to 4th sperm mixup|newspaper=CBC News|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; A panel of the [[College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario]] found Barwin guilty of one of three counts of professional misconduct. They issued an official reprimand, revoked his license practice for two months, and ordered him to cover the $3,650 cost of the disciplinary proceedings.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; A review of the incidences could find no "evident" reasons for the error.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

In 2013, Barwin resigned his appointment to the Order of Canada and it was formally removed later that year.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ipolitics.ca/2013/08/02/renowned-ottawa-doctor-loses-order-of-canada-appointment/|title=Renowned Ottawa doctor loses Order of Canada appointment|website=iPolitics|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p1/2013/2013-08-03/html/gh-rg-eng.html|title=ARCHIVED — Canada Gazette – GOVERNMENT HOUSE|last=Gazette|first=Government of Canada, Public Works and Government Services Canada, Public Services and Procurement Canada, Integrated Services Branch, Canada|website=www.gazette.gc.ca|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Blissymbols''' or '''Blissymbolics''' was conceived as an [[ideographic]] writing system called '''Semantography''' consisting of several hundred basic [[symbol]]s, each representing a concept, which can be composed together to generate new symbols that represent new concepts. Blissymbols differ from most of the world's major writing systems in that the characters do not correspond at all to the sounds of any [[spoken language]].

==History==
Blissymbols was invented by [[Charles K. Bliss]] (1897–1985), born Karl Kasiel Blitz in the Austro-Hungarian city of [[Czernowitz]] (at present the Ukrainian city of [[Chernivtsi]]), which had a mixture of different nationalities that “hated each other, mainly because they spoke and thought in different languages.”&lt;ref name="Stott"&gt;Grant Stott (1997). [http://www.blissymbolics.us/biography/ A Great Australian. The Inventor of Semantography (Blissymbolics)]. Retrieved 18 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Bliss graduated as a chemical engineer at the [[Vienna University of Technology]], and joined an electronics company as a research chemist.

As the German Army invaded Austria in 1938, Bliss, a [[Jew]], was sent to the concentration camps of [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]] and [[Buchenwald concentration camp|Buchenwald]]. His German wife Claire managed to get him released, and they finally became exiles in [[Shanghai]], where Bliss had a cousin.

Bliss devised Blissymbols while a refugee at the [[Shanghai Ghetto]] and [[Sydney]], from 1942 to 1949. He wanted to create an easy-to-learn [[international auxiliary language]] to allow communication between different linguistic communities. He was inspired by [[Chinese character]]s, with which he became familiar at Shanghai.

Bliss's system was explained in his work ''Semantography'' (1949,&lt;ref&gt;Bliss, C. K. (1949).

It had several names:
{{quote|In 1942 I named my symbols '''World Writing,''' then chose in 1947 an international scientific term '''Semantography''' (from Greek ''semanticos'' significant meaning, and ''graphein'' to write) .... My friends argued that is customary to name new writing systems after the inventors .... '''Blissymbolics,''' or '''Blissymbols,''' or simply '''Bliss''' ....&lt;ref name="Bliss" /&gt; (1965, p. 8)}}

As the “tourist explosion” took place in the 1960s, a number of researchers were looking for new standard symbols to be used at roads, stations, airports, etc. Bliss then adopted the name ''Blissymbolics'' in order that no researcher could plagiarize his system of symbols.

Since the 1960s/1970s, Blissymbols have become popular as a method to teach disabled people to communicate.
In 1971 Shirley McNaughton started a pioneer program at the [[Ontario]] Crippled Children's Centre (OCCC), aimed at children with [[cerebral palsy]], from the approach of [[augmentative and alternative communication]] (AAC). According to [[Arika Okrent]], Bliss used to complain about the way the teachers at the OCCC were using the symbols, in relation with the proportions of the symbols and other questions: for example, they used “fancy” terms like “nouns” and “verbs”, to describe what Bliss called “things” and “actions”.&lt;ref name="Okrent"&gt;Okrent, Arika (2009), ''In the land of invented languages''. New York : Spiegel &amp; Grau. pp. 175–6. {{ISBN|978-0-385-52788-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (2009, p.&amp;nbsp;173-4).
The ultimate objective of the OCCC program was to use Blissymbols as a practical way to teach the children to express themselves in their mother tongue, since the Blissymbols provided visual keys to understand the meaning of the English words, especially the abstract words.

In his work ''Semantography'' Bliss had not provided a systematic set of definitions for his symbols (there was a provisional vocabulary index instead &lt;ref name="Bliss" /&gt; (1965, pp.&amp;nbsp;827–67)), so McNaughton's team might often interpret a certain symbol in a way that Bliss would later criticize as a “misinterpretation”. For example, they might interpret a tomato as a vegetable —according to the English definition of tomato— even though the ideal Blissymbol of vegetable was restricted by Bliss to just vegetables growing underground. Eventually the OCCC staff modified and adapted Bliss's system in order to make it serve as a bridge to English.&lt;ref name="Okrent" /&gt; (2009, p.&amp;nbsp;189) Bliss complaints about his symbols “being abused” by the OCCC became so intense that the director of the OCCC told Bliss, on his 1974 visit, never to come back. In spite of this, in 1975 Bliss granted an exclusive world license, for use with disabled children, to the new Blissymbolics Communication Foundation directed by Shirley McNaughton (later called Blissymbolics Communication International, BCI). Nevertheless, in 1977 Bliss claimed that this agreement was violated so that he was deprived of effective control of his symbol system.&lt;ref name="Stott"/&gt;

According to Okrent (2009, p.&amp;nbsp;190), there was a final period of conflict, as Bliss would make continuous criticisms to McNaughton often followed by apologies.&lt;ref name="Okrent" /&gt; Bliss finally brought his lawyers back to the OCCC, and both parts reached a settlement:
{{quote|In 1982, the OCCC got an exclusive, noncancelable, and perpetual license to use Blissymbolics, and he [Bliss] got $160,000. Easter Seals, the charitable foundation .... paid the settlement. .... Bliss spent the money on a big publication run of his own Blissymbols teaching manual.&lt;ref name="Okrent" /&gt; (2009, pp. 192–4)}}
{{anchor|licensing}}Blissymbolic Communication International now claims an exclusive license from Bliss, for the use and publication of Blissymbols for persons with communication, language, and learning difficulties.&lt;ref name="Stott" /&gt;

The Blissymbol method has been used in Canada, Sweden, and a few other countries. Practitioners of Blissymbolics (that is, speech and language therapists and users) maintain that some users who have learned to communicate with Blissymbolics find it easier to learn to read and write traditional orthography in the local spoken language than do users who did not know Blissymbolics.

== The speech question ==
Unlike similar constructed languages like [[AUI (constructed language)|aUI]],&lt;ref name="Okrent" /&gt; Blissymbolics was conceived as a purely [[Visual language|visual]], speech-less language, on the premise that “interlinguistic communication is mainly carried on by reading and writing”. Nevertheless, Bliss suggested that a set of international words could be adopted, so that “a kind of spoken language could be established – as a travelling aid only”.&lt;ref name="Bliss" /&gt; (1965, p.&amp;nbsp;89–90).

So, whether Blissymbolics constitutes an unspoken language is a controversial question, whatever its practical utility may be.  Some linguists, such as [[John DeFrancis]] &lt;ref&gt;DeFrancis, John (1984), ''The Chinese language : fact and fantasy''. Honolulu : University of Hawaii Press. {{ISBN|0-8248-0866-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DeFrancis, John (1989), ''Visible speech : the diverse oneness of writing systems''. Honolulu : University of Hawaii Press. {{ISBN|0-8248-1207-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[J. Marshall Unger]] &lt;ref name="Unger2004"&gt;{{cite book |author = Unger, J. Marshall |title = Ideogram: Chinese characters and the myth of disembodied meaning |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=fRqKreZFVTYC&amp;pg=PA26 |accessdate = 25 July 2011 |year = 2004 |publisher = University of Hawaii Press |isbn = 978-0-8248-2760-1 |pages = 14, 16, 26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that genuine ideographic writing systems with the same capacities as [[natural language]]s do not exist. It is not certain, however, that they have examined Blissymbols.

== Semantics ==
Bliss's concern about [[semantics]] finds an early referent in [[John Locke]],&lt;ref&gt;Locke, J. (1690). ''An Essay Concerning Human Understanding''. London.&lt;/ref&gt; whose ''[[Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' prevented people from those "vague and insignificant forms of speech" that may give the impression of being deep learning.

Another vital referent is [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]’s project of an ideographic language called "[[Characteristica universalis|universal character]]", based on the principles of Chinese characters. It would contain small figures representing "visible things by their lines, and the invisible, by the visible which accompany them", as well as adding "certain additional marks, suitable to make understood the flexions and the particles." &lt;ref name="Bliss" /&gt; (1965, p.&amp;nbsp;569). Bliss stated that his own work was an attempt to take up the thread of Leibniz's project.

Finally there is a strong influence by the work ''[[The Meaning of Meaning]]'' by [[C. K. Ogden]] and [[I. A. Richards]],&lt;ref&gt;C. K. Ogden &amp; I. A. Richard (1923). ''The meaning of meaning; a study of the influence of language upon thought and of the science of symbolism''. London: K. Paul, Trench, Trubner &amp; co., ltd; New York, Harcourt, Brace &amp; company, inc. LC: 23009064.&lt;/ref&gt; which was considered a standard work on semantics. Bliss found especially useful their "triangle of reference": the physical thing or "referent" that we perceive would be represented at the right angle; the meaning that we know by experience (our implicit definition of the thing), at the top angle; and the physical word that we speak or write, at the left angle. The reversed process would happen when we read or listen to words: from the words, we recall meanings, related to referents which may be real things or unreal "fictions". Bliss was particularly concerned with political propaganda, whose discourses would tend to contain words that correspond to unreal or ambiguous referents.

== Grammar ==
The grammar of Blissymbols is based on a certain interpretation of nature, dividing it into matter (material things), energy (actions), and human values (mental evaluations). In an ordinary language, these would give place respectively to [[substantive]]s, [[verb]]s, and [[adjective]]s. In Blissymbols, they are marked respectively by a small square symbol, a small cone symbol, and a small V or inverted cone. These symbols may be placed above any other symbol, turning it respectively into a “thing”, an “action”, and an “evaluation”:
{{quote|The main manifestations of our world can be classified into matter, energy, and...mind force. '''Matter''' is symbolised by a square to indicate that the structure of matter is not chaotic...The symbol for '''energy''' indicates...the primeval [first age] action of our planet, the throwing-up of volcano cones...The symbol for human '''evaluation'''...suggests a cone standing on its point, a position which in physics is termed ''[[lability|labile]]'' [likely to fall, unstable]....All words relating to things and actions refer to something real, which exists outside of our brain. But human evaluations...depend upon the mind of each individual.&lt;ref name="Bliss" /&gt; (1965, p. 42-43)}}
When a symbol is not marked by any of the three grammar symbols (square, cone, inverted cone), they may be a non material thing, a [[grammatical particle]], etc.

== Examples ==
[[File:Blissymbolics.svg|50px]]

The symbol above represents the expression "world language", which was a first tentative name for Blissymbols.
It combines the symbol for "writing tool" or "pen" (a line inclined, as a pen being used) with the symbol for "world", which in its turn combines "ground" or "earth" (a horizontal line below) and its counterpart derivate "sky" (a horizontal line above). Thus the world would be seen as "what is among the ground and the sky", and "Blissymbols" would be seen as "the writing tool to express the world". This is clearly distinct from the symbol of "language", which is a combination of "mouth" and "ear". Thus natural languages are mainly oral, while Blissymbols is just a writing system dealing with semantics, not phonetics.

The 900 individual symbols of the system are called "Bliss-characters"; these may be "[[ideographic]]" – representing abstract concepts, "[[pictographic]]" – a direct representation of objects, or "composite" – in which two or more existing Bliss-characters have been superimposed to represent a new meaning. Size, orientation and relation to the "skyline" and "earthline" affects the meaning of each symbol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.blissymbolics.org/images/bliss-rules.pdf |title = The Fundamental Rules of Blissymbolics: creating new Blissymbolics characters and vocabulary |date = September 28, 2004 |website = Blissymbolics.org |publisher = Blissymbolics Communication International (BCI) |accessdate = 1 January 2014 }} (pp. 7–9)&lt;/ref&gt; A single concept is called a "Bliss-word", which can consist of one or more Bliss-characters. In the case of multiple character Bliss-words, the main character is called the "classifier" which "indicates the semantic or grammatical category to which the Bliss-word belongs". To this can be added Bliss-characters as prefixes or suffixes called "modifiers" which amend the meaning of the first symbol. A further symbol, called an "indicator" can be added adjacent to the Bliss-word; these are used as "grammatical and/or semantic markers."&lt;ref&gt;Rules of Blissymbolics pp. 11–18&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Bliss cinema.png|"I want to go to the cinema." in blissymbols]]&lt;br /&gt;
This sentence means "I want to go to the cinema." This example shows several features of Blissymbolics:
* The pronoun "I" is formed of the Bliss-character for "person" and the number 1 (the first person). Using the number 2 would give the symbol for singular "You"; adding the plural indicator (a small cross at the top) would produce the pronouns "We" and plural "You".
* The Bliss-word for "to want" contains the heart which symbolizes "feeling" (the classifier), plus the [[Wikt:serpentine|serpentine]] line which symbolizes "fire" (the modifier), and the verb (called "action") indicator at the top.
* The Bliss-word for "to go" is composed of the Bliss-character for "leg" and the verb indicator.
* The Bliss-word for "cinema" is composed of the Bliss-character for "house" (the classifier), and "film" (the modifier); "film" is a composite character composed of "camera" and the arrow indicating movement.

== Towards the international standardization of the script ==
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2014}}
As elucidated above, Blissymbolics was used in 1971 to help children at the Ontario Crippled Children's Centre (OCCC, now the [[Bloorview Kids Rehab]]) in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada. Since it was important that the children see consistent pictures, OCCC had a [[draftsman]] named Jim Grice draw the symbols. Both Charles K. Bliss and Margrit Beesley at the OCCC worked with Grice to ensure consistency. In 1975, a new organization named Blissymbolics Communication Foundation directed by Shirley McNaughton led this effort. Over the years, this organization changed its name to Blissymbolics Communication Institute, [[Easter Seals (Canada)|Easter Seal]] Communication Institute, and ultimately to Blissymbolics Communication International (BCI).

BCI is an international group of people who act as an authority regarding the [[standardization]] of the Blissymbolics language. It has taken responsibility for any extensions of the Blissymbolics language as well as any maintenance needed for the language. BCI has coordinated usage of the language since 1971 for augmentative and alternative communication. BCI received a licence and copyright through legal agreements with Charles K. Bliss in 1975 and 1982.  Limiting the count of Bliss-characters (there are currently about 900) is very useful in order to help the user community. It also helps when implementing Blissymbolics using technology such as computers.

In 1991, BCI published a reference guide &lt;ref&gt;Wood, Storr, &amp; Reich (1992) ''Blissymbol Reference Guide''. Toronto: Blissymbolics Communication International. {{ISBN|0-9690516-9-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; containing 2300 vocabulary items and detailed rules for the graphic design of additional characters, so they settled a first set of approved ''Bliss-words'' for general use.
The [[Standards Council of Canada]] then sponsored, on January 21, 1993, the registration of an encoded character set for use in ISO/IEC 2022, in the [[ISO-IR]] international registry of coded character sets.
After many years of requests, the Blissymbolic language was finally approved as an encoded language, with code &lt;tt&gt;zbl&lt;/tt&gt;, into the [[ISO 639-2]] and [[ISO 639-3]] standards.

A proposal was posted by [[Michael Everson]] for the Blissymbolics script to be included in the [[Universal Character Set]] (UCS) and encoded for use with the [[ISO/IEC 10646]] and [[Unicode]] standards.&lt;ref name="Everson"&gt;[[Michael Everson|Everson, Michael]] (1998). [http://std.dkuug.dk/JTC1/SC2/WG2/docs/n1866.pdf Encoding Blissymbolics in Plane 1 of the UCS.] Retrieved 19 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; BCI would cooperate with the Unicode Technical Committee (UTC) and the ISO Working Group.
The proposed encoding does not use the lexical encoding model used in the existing ISO-IR/169 registered character set, but instead applies the Unicode and ISO character-glyph model to the ''Bliss-character'' model already adopted by BCI, since this would significantly reduce the number of needed characters.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} Bliss-characters can now be used in a creative way to create many new arbitrary concepts, by surrounding the invented words with special Bliss indicators (similar to punctuation){{citation needed|date=October 2014}}, something which was not possible in the ISO-IR/169 encoding.

However, at the end of 2009, the Blissymbolic script is still not encoded in the UCS. Some questions are still unanswered, such as the inclusion in the BCI repertoire of some characters (currently about 24) that are already encoded in the UCS (like digits, punctuation signs, spaces and some markers), but whose unification may cause problems due to the very strict graphical layouts required by the published Bliss reference guides{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}. In addition, the character metrics use a specific layout where the usual [[baseline (typography)|baseline]] is not used, and the ideographic em-square is not relevant for Bliss character designs, that use additional "earth line" and "sky line" to define the composition square.  
Some fonts supporting the BCI repertoire are available and usable with texts encoded with [[Private Use Area|private-use assignments]] (PUA) within the UCS. But only the private BCI encoding based on ISO-IR/169 registration is available for text interchange.

The '''British Psychoanalytical Society''' was founded by the British [[psychiatrist]] [[Ernest Jones]] as the '''London Psychoanalytical Society''' on 30 October 1913. 

== Establishment and name ==
[[Ernest Jones]] established the society in 1913, shortly after he returned to London from Canada. The society had 9 founding members including [[William Mackenzie (doctor)|William Mackenzie]], [[Maurice Nicoll]] and [[David Eder]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://psychoanalysis.org.uk/who-we-are/100-years-of-history#6|title=100 years of history {{!}} Institute of Psychoanalysis|website=psychoanalysis.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost immediately, the society was caught up in the international controversy between [[Carl Jung]] and [[Sigmund Freud]]. Many of the society's membership were followers of Jung's theories, although Jones himself enjoyed a close relationship with [[Freud]] and wished for the society to be unambiguously Freudian.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE BRITISH PSYCHOANALYTICAL SOCIETY|last=Robinson|first=Ken|publisher=Institute of Psychoanalysis|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=1-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The outbreak of [[World War I|World War One]] in 1914 meant that the nascent society, which depended on correspondence with psychoanalysts in [[Vienna]], then part of [[Austria-Hungary]], had to be suspended. There were a few informal meetings during the war, but these became less and less frequent as the war went on.

In 1919, Ernest Jones refounded the society as the '''British Psychoanalytical society.'''  He took the opportunity to define the society as [[freudian]] in nature, removing most of the [[jungian]] members'''.''' With the help of [[John Rickman (psychoanalyst)|John Rickman]] , the society established a clinic and a training arm, known as the '''Institute of Psychoanalysis.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.psychoanalysis.org.uk/our-authors-and-theorists/ernest-jones|title=Ernest Jones {{!}} Institute of Psychoanalysis|website=www.psychoanalysis.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Interwar years ==
In the 1920's, Ernest Jones and the society grew increasingly under the influence of [[Melanie Klein]]. Jones was inspired by her writings to develop several psychoanalytical concepts. In 1925, Klein delivered a series of talks at the society, and Jones invited her to move to London, which she did shortly after. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.psychoanalysis.org.uk/our-authors-and-theorists/melanie-klein|title=Melanie Klein {{!}} Institute of Psychoanalysis|website=www.psychoanalysis.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Klein's work was well received in London, but it attracted increasing controversy on the continent, where most psychoanalysts were based.

The rise of the [[Nazi Party]] in Germany and later in Austria, led to increasing numbers of German and Austrian Psychoanalysts fleeing to London, where they joined the burgeoning society. By 1937, 13 out of 71 members were refugees from Europe. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Ernest Jones]] personally intervened to bring [[Sigmund Freud]] and his daughter, [[Anna Freud]], to London.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1938,  Sigmund Freud wrote to Jones:&lt;blockquote&gt;''"The events of recent years have made London the principal site and center of the psychoanalytical movement. May the society carry out the functions thus falling to it in the most brilliant manner."'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/24794598|title=Letters of Sigmund Freud|last=1856-1939.|first=Freud, Sigmund,|date=1992|publisher=Dover|others=Freud, Ernst L., 1892-1970.|isbn=0486271056|location=New York|oclc=24794598}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;By the start of the second world war, 34 out of 90 members were emigres from the continent.

However, the assimilation of so many prominent Psychoanalysts from continental Europe created tensions. The huge difference in the approaches of [[Anna Freud]] and [[Melanie Klein]] led to the development of several factions. Increasingly, presentations of papers at the society became thinly veiled attacks on opposing factions theories. For example, in March 1937 [[Melitta Schmideberg]] (Klein's daughter) presented her paper: "After the Analysis – Some Phantasies of Patients", which viciously attacked almost all of Klein's ideas, though it did not mention her by name. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.melanie-klein-trust.org.uk/1926-38-London-first-papers|title=melanie klein trust|website=www.melanie-klein-trust.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jcfar.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/After-the-Analysis-Melitta-Schmideberg.pdf|title=After the Analysis|last=Schmideberg|first=Melitta|date=|website=Journal of the Centre for Freudian Analysis and Research|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The 'Controversial Discussions' ==
''See main article: [[Controversial discussions]]''
[[File:James Strachey.jpg|thumb|267x267px|James Strachey, one of the leaders of the scientific committee]]
By 1942, relations between the factions within the society had become so heated that a committee had to be convened to facilitate monthly discussions on the scientific nature of the society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://psychoanalysis.org.uk/announcement-of-the-controversial-discussions|title=Announcement of the 'Controversial Discussions' {{!}} Institute of Psychoanalysis|website=psychoanalysis.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee was chaired by three members of the society, each representing one of the major factions:

* [[James Strachey]] - a member of the [[British Independent Group (psychoanalysis)|British Independent Group.]]
* [[Marjorie Brierley]] - an ally of [[Melanie Klein]].
* [[Edward Glover (psychoanalyst)|Edward Glover]] - who identified as 'pure Freudian', in opposition to [[Melanie Klein]]. Glover resigned from the society in 1944, along with several other Freudian psychoanalysts.

After heated debate, the committee resolved to a "gentleman's agreement" - which ensured that each faction would have equal representation within all committees within the society. It was also agreed that training of future Psychoanalysts at the institute would be organised into two pathways: one Kleinian, and one Freudian.

== After World War Two ==

[[Portugal]] was a pioneer in the process of abolition of [[capital punishment]]. No executions have been carried out since 1846, with the formal abolishment of capital punishment for civil crimes occurring in 1867.

The method of capital punishment used in Portugal was by hanging. 
Portugal was the first country in the world to begin the process to abolish the death penalty,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/europe.html "The end of capital punishment in Europe"], Capital Punishment UK&lt;/ref&gt; abolishing it in stages – for political crimes in 1852, for all crimes except the military in 1867, and for all crimes in 1911. In 1916 Portugal entered in [[World War I]] and it was re-established only for military crimes in war time with a foreign country and only in the [[Theater (warfare)|theater of war]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Law 635: Amendment to the Portuguese Constitution of 1911, Article 3 – Exception on the Death Penalty Article|url=https://dre.pt/application/dir/pdf1s/1916/09/19700/09090909.pdf|work=Diário do Governo da República Portuguesa|publisher=República Portuguesa|accessdate=4 May 2017|language=Portuguese|format=pdf|date=28 September 1916|quote=[Translation]: The Death Penalty ... cannot be reestablished in any case (...) # with the exception, about the Death Penalty, only in case of war with a foreign country (...) and only in the theater of war.}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the new Constitution in 1976, it was again abolished for all crimes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/europe.html "The end of capital punishment in Europe"], Capital Punishment UK&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act50/012/2007/en/ "Document – Death Penalty Statistics 2006"], [[Amnesty International]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Constitution of the Portuguese Republic: Article 24º, Nº2|url=http://www.parlamento.pt/Legislacao/Paginas/ConstituicaoRepublicaPortuguesa.aspx#art1|accessdate=29 March 2014|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last execution in Portugal took place in [[Lagos, Portugal|Lagos]] in 1846. A possible execution of a soldier of the [[Portuguese Expeditionary Corps]] carried out in France during World War I remains poorly documented.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/europe.html "The end of capital punishment in Europe"], Capital Punishment UK&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act50/012/2007/en/ "Document – Death Penalty Statistics 2006"], [[Amnesty International]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2008 European Values Study (EVS), 51.6% of respondents in Portugal said the death penalty can never be justified, while only 1.5% said it can be always justified.&lt;ref&gt;http://zacat.gesis.org/webview/index.jsp?study=http%3A%2F%2F193.175.238.79%3A80%2Fobj%2FfStudy%2FZA4783&amp;variable=http%3A%2F%2F193.175.238.79%3A80%2Fobj%2FfVariable%2FZA4783_V252&amp;mode=documentation&amp;submode=variable&amp;top=yes&amp;language=en&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Changshou Lake''' ({{Zh|s=长寿湖|t=長壽湖|p=Chángshòu Hú}}) is a man-made [[lake]] with another name Shizitun (Lion Beach) [[Reservoir]] in [[Changshou District|Changshou]], [[Chongqing]], [[China]]. In the purpose of generating electric power, four [[hydraulic power station]]s were built after the [[dam]] construction had been completed in the 1950s. Since then a state farm was set up for [[fishery]] and [[horticulture]] as well as [[animal husbandry]]. Its surface area is 60&amp;nbsp;km² with an irrigation area amounting to 248&amp;nbsp;km². There are many [[islands]] within the lake, good for tourism.

'''Critical illness insurance''', otherwise known as '''critical illness cover''' or a '''dread disease policy''', is an [[insurance]] product in which the insurer is contracted to typically make a lump sum cash payment if the policyholder is diagnosed with one of the specific illnesses on a predetermined list as part of an [[insurance policy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Woodfield |first=KR |title=Don't Buy That Health Insurance: Become an Educated Healthcare Consumer |publisher=Dog Ear Publishing, LLC|year=2012 |isbn=1457515326}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The policy may also be structured to pay out regular income and the payout may also be on the policyholder undergoing a surgical procedure, for example, having a heart bypass operation.

The policy may require the policyholder to survive a minimum number of days (the ''survival period'') from when the illness was first diagnosed. The survival period used varies from company to company, however, 14 days is the most typical survival period used. In the Australian market, survival periods are set between 8 – 14 days.

The contract terms contain specific rules that define when a [[diagnosis]] of a critical illness is considered valid. It may state that the diagnosis need be made by a physician who specialises in that illness or condition, or it may name specific tests, e.g. EKG changes of a myocardial infarction, that confirm the diagnosis.

In some markets, however, the definition of a claim for many of the diseases and conditions have become standardised, thus all insurers would use the same claims definition. The standardisation of the claims definitions may serve many purposes including increased clarity of cover for policyholders and greater comparability of policies from different life offices. For example, in the UK the [[Association of British Insurers]] (ABI) has issued a ''Statement of Best Practise'' which includes a number of standard definitions for common critical illnesses.

There are alternative forms of critical illness insurance to the lump sum cash payment model. These critical illness insurance policies directly pay health providers for the treatment costs of critical and life-threatening illnesses covered by the policyholder’s insurance policy, including the fee of specialists and procedures at a select group of high-ranking hospitals up to a certain amount per episode of treatment as set out in the policy.

==First critical illness product==

Critical illness insurance was founded by [[Marius Barnard (surgeon)|Dr Marius Barnard]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Heart to Heart | newspaper=CoverTen | publisher=Incisive Financial Publishing | pages=11–12 | date=10 October 2007 | url=http://db.riskwaters.com/data/cover/pdf/cover_supp_1007.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the first critical illness product being launched on 6 October 1983 in [[South Africa]], under the name '''dread disease insurance'''.

This form of insurance originally covered four primary human health conditions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Smith |first1=Matt |title=What is Critical Illness Insurance |url=https://protectcritical.com/what-is-critical-illness-insurance/ |website=Protect Critical |accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

*Cancer
*Stroke
*Heart attack
*Coronary bypass surgery

Since 1983, the cover has been accepted into many insurance markets around the world. Other names of the insurance cover include: '''trauma insurance''', '''serious illness insurance''' and '''living assurance'''.

==Conditions covered==

The schedule of insured illnesses varies between insurance companies. In 1983, four conditions were covered by the policy, i.e. heart attack, cancer, stroke and coronary artery by-pass surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title=Critical Illness Insurance: Past, present and future | publisher=Marius Barnard | year=2004 | url=http://www.actuaries.org.uk/sites/all/files/documents/pdf/Barnard.pdf | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120707092303/http://www.actuaries.org.uk/sites/all/files/documents/pdf/Barnard.pdf | archivedate=2012-07-07 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ref: [https://www.canadalife.co.uk/group-insurance/group-critical-illness Canada Life Critical Illness Insurance Policy] 

Due to the fact that the incidence of a condition may decrease over time and both the diagnosis and treatment may improve over time, the financial need to cover some illnesses deemed critical a decade ago are no longer deemed necessary today. Likewise, some of the conditions covered today may no longer be needed a decade or so in the future.

The actual conditions covered depend on the market need for the cover, competition amongst insurers, as well as the policyholder's '''perceived''' value of the benefits offered. For these reasons conditions such as diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis, among others, may become the norm cover provided in the future.

==Need for critical illness cover==

Critical illness cover was originally sold with the intention of providing financial protection to individuals following the diagnosis or treatment of an illness deemed critical. Critical illness may be purchased by individuals in conjunction with a [[life insurance]] or [[term assurance]] policy at the time of a residential purchase, known as a 'bolt-on' benefit.

The finances received could be used to:

* pay for the costs of the care and treatment;
* pay for recuperation aids;
* replace any lost income due to a decreasing ability to earn; or even
* fund for a change in lifestyle.

This insurance can provide financial protection to the policyholder or their dependents on the repayment of a [[Mortgage loan|mortgage]] due to the policyholder contracting a critical illness condition or on the death of the policyholder. In this type of product design, some insurers may choose to structure the product to repay a portion of the outstanding mortgage debt on the contracting of a critical illness, whilst the full outstanding mortgage debt would be repaid on the death of the policyholder. Alternatively, the full sum assured may be paid on diagnosis of the critical illness, but then no further payment is made on death, effectively making the critical illness payment an 'accelerated death payment'.

Some employers may also take out critical illness insurance for their employees. This contract would be in the form of a group contract and has become an essential strategy used by employers around the world to both protect their employees financially as well as attract more employees to consider working for the company.

==Alternative forms of critical illness insurance==
Typical critical illness insurance products refer to policies where the insurer pays the policyholder a pre-determined lump sum cash payment if the policyholder is diagnosed with a critical illness listed in the policy. However, alternative forms of critical illness cover provide direct payment to health providers to cover the high medical costs in treating critical illnesses such as cancer, cardiovascular procedures and organ transplants. The maximum amount is set out in the insurance policy and defined per episode of treatment.

These critical illness insurance products generally pay hospitals directly to avoid policyholder’s incurring out of pocket expenses and lengthy reimbursement processes. In most instances of this alternative to the lump sump critical illness insurance, policyholders may decide where they will receive treatment among a pre-selected group of hospitals.

Some forms of critical illness insurance also offer policyholders the option to travel to highly specialised hospitals in other countries to receive treatment. These policies usually include travel and accommodation expenses for the policyholder and a companion, as well as other concierge services such as translators or personal nurses.

==Assessing risk ==

Applicants are assessed for risk by a process of underwriting.  Underwriting may take place in an automated underwriting computer filtering system.  However the most detailed and holistic underwriting is still performed by experienced life insurance underwriters.

The underwriting process for critical illness is similar to life insurance underwriting in that it takes into account factors such as age, gender, smoking status, past medical history, family history, alcohol consumption, and body mass index.  In the case of critical illness however, there is an increased emphasis on family history, smoking and bodymass index are risk factors that can demonstrate a marked increase risk with respect to critical illness cover.

Having underwritten an applicant in full, an underwriter can decide to accept the risk at the standard rate, or they may decide than an extra charge is warranted, or they may decide to apply exclusions of particular illnesses.  If there is any amendment by an underwriter to the terms of acceptance, this has to be agreed by the applicant before the policy can proceed to issue.

==World markets==

In [[South Africa]], the [[UK]], [[Ireland]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], critical illness insurance has become a well established form of insurance.

Critical illness insurance continues to grow in popularity and has recently been accepted into other territories including the [[far east]] and the [[United States]].

In markets where the product is newer, many insurers choose to use the expertise of reinsurers with worldwide exposure as well as overseas insurers who have sold the product for a number of years. The expertise may come in the form of data provided as well as assistance with the product design features of the product.

=== Australia ===
Critical Illness insurance, also known as Trauma Insurance in [[Australia]] is characterised by lump sum payments for listed medical events. Unlike in the [[United Kingdom]], Trauma Insurance conditions are not standardised and market competition is based on both premium and policy definitions. It is not uncommon for an Australian Trauma Insurance policy to list 40+ definitions, including Cancer, Heart Attack, Strokes. Around 85% of Trauma Insurance claims paid in Australia are for either Cancer or Heart Disease. It is not uncommon for policies to also offer partial payments, if the condition suffered does not meet the full definition required for a full claim payout.

Trauma Insurance policies in Australia are most commonly linked to [[Life Insurance]] policies, however can be taken as a stand-alone policy and where a Trauma Insurance policy is linked, it will normally deduct the balance of the insured Life Insurance amount.

Trauma Insurance policies in Australia when used to provide personal protection, are generally not tax deductible and any claim proceeds are not taxable. Trauma Insurance is not offered in [[Superannuation]] as the definitions available for payment do not always align with the required conditions of release.

=== Canada ===
Critical illness insurance options available in Canada:

* ROP - Return of premium.  If you do not claim a critical illness you can request a return of premium as long as you have fulfilled the minimum time period specified within the policy.
* ROPD - Return of premium on Death.  Your premiums are returned to your estate. The ROPD is an optional 
* Term CI - Similar to term life insurance, this critical illness insurance increases in premium cost at the start of each new term.  A term is generally 10 years. Term CI expires at age 75 (varies by insurance company).
* Permanent CI - Permanent critical illness insurance is a level term insurance, which means the premiums do not change.  Permanent CI does not expire unless requested by the client, or failure to pay.
* Second Event.  If there is a second critical illness you receive 50% of the policy benefit over and above the base benefit.  Second event is an optional rider.
* Waiver of premium.  The premium are waived if you are disabled. Waiver of premium is an optional rider.

Brian was a double [[amputee]] in a wheelchair and had been brought to the center for a blocked catheter. Sinclair arrived in a taxi van at the emergency department just before 3 p.m. September 19, 2008. A video of his arrival is on YouTube. He was dead for two to seven hours before someone in authority noticed and it is estimated he waited thirty-four hours.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/winnipeg-brian-sinclair-report-1.4295996 "Ignored to death: Brian Sinclair's death caused by racism, inquest inadequate, group says" CBC news.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="916">The mission of the '''Department of Essential Drugs and Medicines''' of the [[World Health Organization]] is "to help save lives and improve health by closing the huge gap between the potential that essential drugs have to offer and the reality that for millions of people – particularly the poor and disadvantaged – medicines are unavailable, unaffordable, unsafe or improperly used."

The EDM provides "global guidance on essential drugs and medicines, and working with countries – at their request – to implement national drug policies to ensure equity of access to essential drugs, drug quality and safety, and rational use of drugs."

The '''Friends of Science In Medicine''' ('''FSM''') is an Australian association which supports [[evidence-based medicine]] and strongly opposes the promotion and practice of unsubstantiated [[Therapy|therapies]] that [[Pseudoscience|lack a scientifically plausible rationale]].

== Scope and operations ==
Friends of Science in Medicine advocate the cessation of those university [[Alternative medicine|complementary medicine]] courses that are not based on [[Scientific method|scientific principles]] nor supported by [[scientific evidence]], although they do support research into alternative and complementary approaches where there is evidence for potential benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1= Costa |first1= Marcello |last2= Morrison |first2= Rob |last3= Dwyer |first3= John |last4= Marron |first4= Loretta |last5= MacLennan  |first5= Alastair |title= Join Us! |url= http://www.i2p.com.au/sites/i2p.com.au/files/FSM_Supporters.pdf |type= Recruitment letter, vision statement |year= 2011 |publisher= Friends of Science In Medicine |location= Morayfield |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140912221947/http://www.i2p.com.au/sites/i2p.com.au/files/FSM_Supporters.pdf |archivedate= 12 September 2014 |deadurl= no |via= i2p.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tertiary"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Hughes |first1= JD |last2= Blott |first2= LA |title= Tertiary education institutions should not offer pseudoscientific medical courses |url= https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2012/196/9/tertiary-education-institutions-should-not-offer-pseudoscientific-medical-courses |journal= [[The Medical Journal of Australia]] |volume= 196 |issue= 9 |page= 566 |doi= 10.5694/mja12.10484 |pmid= 22621142 |date= 21 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Ryan2012"&gt;{{cite news |last1= Ryan |first1= Kath |title= Alternative medicine row erupts |url= https://www.mja.com.au/insight/2012/27/alternative-medicine-row-erupts |publisher= [[The Medical Journal of Australia|MJA Group Australia]] |work= MJA InSight |issue= 27 |accessdate= 5 August 2014|date= 16 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By April 2012 they had widened their focus from university education to the [[Medicine#Clinical practice|clinical practice]], use and legitimacy of complementary medicine within Australian society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Marron |first= Loretta |title= What are 'Complementary and Alternative Medicines' (CAMs)? |url= http://scienceinmedicine.org.au/index.php?view=article&amp;catid=11 |website= www.scienceinmedicine.org.au |publisher= Friends of Science in Medicine |accessdate= 6 September 2012}} More recent [http://www.scienceinmedicine.org.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=165 version] ([https://web.archive.org/web/20140912150707/http://www.scienceinmedicine.org.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=165 archived] 12 September 2014)..&lt;/ref&gt; Entirely volunteer run, FSM was initially supported by a A$3,000 grant from the [[Australian Skeptics]] Science and Education Foundation(ASSEF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= FSM Supported by Australian Skeptics |url= http://www.skeptics.com.au/latest/news/fsm-supported-by-australian-skeptics/ |website= www.skeptics.com.au |publisher= [[Australian Skeptics]] |date= 22 April 2012 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140306041902/http://www.skeptics.com.au/latest/news/fsm-supported-by-australian-skeptics/ |archivedate= 6 March 2014 |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite letter|last=Executive Committee, Friends of Science in Medicine |recipient=Eran Sergev, President [[Australian Skeptics]] |subject=Thank you for your generosity and support |date=16 February 2012 |url=http://www.skeptics.com.au/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/FSM-Skeptics-thankyou.pdf |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511072841/http://www.skeptics.com.au/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/FSM-Skeptics-thankyou.pdf |archivedate=11 May 2013 }} .&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
Throughout its history, FSM has been actively involved in a variety of [[Health policy|medical policy]] issues surrounding evidence-based medicine and [[Alternative medicine|complementary and alternative medicine]].  They continue to appeal to the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency, [[Medicare (Australia)]] and Australian [[tertiary education]].&lt;ref name= "Levi2012"&gt;{{cite episode |last= Levi |first= Scott |title= University "pseudoscience" criticised |url=http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2012/02/01/3420275.htm?site=adelaide |station= [[891 ABC Adelaide]] |network= [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=1 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Thompson |first= Matthew |title= RMIT defends CAM courses |url= http://www.australiandoctor.com.au/news/latest-news/rmit-defends-alternative-medicine-courses |magazine= Australian Doctor |date= 1 February 2012 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130216063855/http://www.australiandoctor.com.au/news/latest-news/rmit-defends-alternative-medicine-courses |archivedate= 16 February 2013 |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |last= Colvin |first= Mark |authorlink= Mark Colvin |title=Doctors group fights to keep alternative medicine out of uni |url= http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2012/s3420802.htm |accessdate= 12 September 2014 |series= [[PM (ABC Radio)|PM]] |network= [[Radio National]]; [[ABC Local Radio]]: [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date= 1 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to review current policies.

FSM entered into the Australian media and promoted their message through ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1= Corderoy |first1= Amy |title= Treatment isn't always a cure |url= http://www.smh.com.au/national/health/treatment-isnt-always-a-cure-20130308-2fr0d.html |accessdate= 28 July 2014|newspaper= [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date= 9 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Courier-Mail]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1= Houghton |first1= Des |title= Quacks galore in facade of quirky medicine |url= http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/quacks-galore-in-facade-of-quirky-medicine/story-e6frerdf-1226367305953?nk=64b410a72fee3140c9e2f94fafbc722c |accessdate= 28 July 2014 |newspaper= [[The Courier-Mail]] |location= Brisbane, AU |date= 26 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]],&lt;ref name= "Levi2012"/&gt; ''[[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Thompson |first= Matthew |date= 28 January 2012 |title= Alternative medicine can be scientific, say besieged academics |url= http://theconversation.com/alternative-medicine-can-be-scientific-say-besieged-academics-5058 |work= [[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]] |accessdate= 28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Medical Journal of Australia]]'',&lt;ref name= "Ryan2012"/&gt; the ''Australian Doctor'' magazine and regional radio stations. By May 2012 thirteen separate FSM discursive events created the unified message that all alternative and complementary medicines should be banned unless proven by rigorous [[Scientific method|scientific inquiry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |last= Kelly |first= Fran |title= New lobby opposes teaching alternative medicine |url= http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/breakfast/2012-01-30/3799620 |accessdate= 12 September 2014 |series= [[Radio National Breakfast]] |network= [[Radio National]]: [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date= 30 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Dell2012"/&gt;

In September 2012 FSM was involved in lobbying the [[Minister for Health (Australia)|Australian Health Minister]], [[Tanya Plibersek]], to expand the chief medical officer's study into complementary medicine to include [[chiropractic]] and [[acupuncture]]. The group further demanded that all alternative medicines be taken off [[Health insurance#Australia|private health insurance]] which the [[Australian Government]] subsidizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Kaye |first= Byron |title= Acupuncture, chiro should be investigated: Academics |url= http://www.medicalobserver.com.au/news/acupuncture-chiro-should-be-investigated-academics |accessdate= 25 August 2013 |magazine= Medical Observer |date= 18 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian Government is currently examining the evidence of clinical [[efficacy]], [[Cost-effectiveness analysis|cost effectiveness]], safety and quality of natural therapies. The result, expected in April 2015, will include a decision as to which natural therapies should continue to receive the rebate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= The Review of the Australian Government Rebate on Private Health Insurance for Natural Therapies |url= http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/phi-natural-therapies |website= www.health.gov.au |publisher= [[Department of Health (Australia)|Department of Health]]: [[Government of Australia|Australia]] |accessdate= 6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The therapies under review are those not provided by an accredited [[health professional]], which are covered by private health insurance but not Medicare. In addition to [[homeopathy]], they include [[iridology]], [[aromatherapy]], various kinds of [[massage]], [[Buteyko method|Buteyko]], [[yoga]] and [[pilates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1= McCredie |first1= Jane |title= Jane McCredie: A drop of credibility |url= https://www.mja.com.au/insight/2013/16/jane-mccredie-drop-credibility |work= MJA InSight |publisher= [[The Medical Journal of Australia|MJA Group Australia]] |accessdate= 12 August 2014 |date= 6 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
Several professional groups including the [[Australian Medical Association]] found that FSM had exceeded the boundaries of reasoned debate and risked compromising the values that the Friends of Science in Medicine claimed to support.&lt;ref name="Tertiary"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Newton |first= Kate |title=Anti-quackery group risks backlash: critics |url= http://www.australiandoctor.com.au/news/latest-news/anti-quackery-group-risks-backlash-critics |accessdate= 17 July 2012 |magazine= Australian Doctor |date= 17 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group underwent further criticism through editorials in ''The Medical Journal of Australia'' calling on the association to reverse its tactics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1= PA |last1= Komesaroff |first2= A |last2= Moore |first3= IH |last3= Kerridge |title= Medicine and science must oppose intolerance and censorship |journal= [[The Medical Journal of Australia]] |date= 16 July 2012 |volume= 197 |issue= 2 |pages= 82–3 |doi= 10.5694/mja12.10500 |pmid= 22794044}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kerryn Phelps]], former President of the Australian Medical Association, wrote the group had "cast its net too wide" in its condemnations, particularly in attacking courses in chiropractic, traditional Chinese medicine and Western herbalism. She further stated, "there is evidence supporting CAM approaches. You also have to remember that a sizable part of what is done in mainstream medicine lacks robust evidence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Smith |first= Paul |title= Phelps defends CAM degrees |url= http://www.australiandoctor.com.au/news/latest-news/phelps-defends-cam-degrees |accessdate= 25 August 2013 |magazine= Australian Doctor |date= 7 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phelps, along with Stephen Myers, a Professor of Complementary Medicine and Director of the Natural Medicine Research Unit at [[Southern Cross University]], in a 2012 editorial in ''The Medical Journal of Australia'' wrote, "there is great danger for the public if complementary medicine practice is allowed to develop outside mainstream education." They wrote it would undermine "safe practice and critical appraisal", and stated there is now an extensive evidence base for complementary therapies available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1= Norrie |first1= Justin |title= Attack on complementary medicine undermines safety |url= http://theconversation.com/attack-on-complementary-medicine-undermines-safety-8264 |work= [[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]] |accessdate= 10 August 2014 |date= 16 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Meyers |first1= SP |last2= Xue |first2= CC |last3= Cohen |first3= MM |last4= Phillips |first4= KL |last5= Lewith |first5= GT |displayauthors= 4 |date= 16 July 2012 |title= The legitimacy of academic complementary medicine |journal= [[The Medical Journal of Australia]] |volume= 197 |issue= 2 |pages= 69–70 |doi= 10.5694/mja12.10491 |pmid= 22794038 |type= editorial}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an open letter on their website which was triggered by FSM's position on the proposed partnership between [[nutraceutical]] company Swisse and [[La Trobe University]], the Australasian Integrative Medicine Association (AIMA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= About AIMA |url= https://www.aima.net.au/who_we_are |website= www.aima.net.au |publisher= Australasian Integrative Medical Association |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140826161713/https://www.aima.net.au/who_we_are/ |archivedate= 26 August 2014 |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; criticizes the FSM for not reaching out to AIMA or other complementary medicine organizations which, the AIMA states, would at least establish "a more effective dialogue ...to improve the basis of health care and research for academics, medical professionals and the general population alike."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Open Letter to Friends of Science in Medicine |url= https://www.aima.net.au/open-letter-to-friends-of-science-in-medicine/ |website= www.aima.net |location= Terrigal, AU |publisher= Australasian Integrative Medicine Association |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140826161029/https://www.aima.net.au/open-letter-to-friends-of-science-in-medicine/ |archivedate= 26 August 2014 |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; They further state that "FSM appear to be purposefully limiting their use of scientific scrutiny."

==Activities and Impact==

The following describes some of the initiatives and accomplishments of the Friends of Science in Medicine.

===Chiropractic===

As a result of the efforts of John Dwyer and the Friends of Science in Medicine, in August 2013, the chairman of the Chiropractic Board of Australia said it had removed some courses from its approved training schedule and would be randomly auditing practitioners to ensure they were not making unsubstantiated claims about the benefits of chiropractic.
It also announced all registered chiropractors would be required to remove [[Vaccine controversies|anti-vaccination]] claims from their websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1= Corderoy |first1= Amy |title= Chiropractors pushing anti-vaccination line face crackdown, audits |url= http://www.smh.com.au/national/chiropractors-pushing-antivaccination-line-face-crackdown-audits-20130808-2rkof.html |newspaper= [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |accessdate= 28 July 2014 |date= 9 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2013, [[Macquarie University]] began discussions with higher education providers to transfer its chiropractic degrees by 2015.&lt;ref name= "Baldock2013"&gt;{{cite web |last= Baldock |first= Clive |authorlink=Clive Baldock |title= Proposed changes to Chiropractic at Macquarie |url= http://www.announcements.mq.edu.au/others/proposed_changes_to_chiropractic_at_macquarie |website= mq.edu.au |publisher= [[Macquarie University]] |type= notice to university staff |date= 24 April 2013 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140826161518/http://www.announcements.mq.edu.au/others/proposed_changes_to_chiropractic_at_macquarie |archivedate= 26 August 2014 |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Executive Dean of Science, Professor [[Clive Baldock]] said the initiative was first and foremost an academic one, based on a need for the Faculty of Science to build upon the University’s recent major strategic investments in research-intensive disciplines such as biomedical science and engineering.&lt;ref name= "Baldock2013"/&gt;

Earlier in 2013, FSM sent out a series of letters about inappropriate treatment of babies and children by chiropractors who claim that spinal manipulation helps health conditions such as [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]], [[Asthma]], [[Allergy|allergies]], [[Nocturnal enuresis|bedwetting]], [[Baby colic|colic]] and [[Otitis|ear infection]] and is a substitute for [[vaccination]]. This was prompted in part by the report that government funding of chiropractic care for children under 14 was reported to have risen by 185% in four years. FSM sent letters to the Chiropractic and Osteopathic College of Australasia (COCA), [[Chiropractors' Association of Australia]] (CAA), Chiropractic Board of Australia (CBA), the Australian Spinal Research Foundation (ASRF), Chiropractic Council of NSW and Council on Chiropractic Education Australasia (CCEA). A second letter sent to the four universities teaching chiropractic, asking them to justify the '[[Vertebral subluxation|subluxation]]' theory that is the foundation of chiropractic.  The response by the CEO of [[Chiropractors' Association of Australia]], Andrew Macnamara claims that there is no evidence provided to back up the concerns that chriropractic subluxations are an unjustified hypothesis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title= Drs’ Tiresome Turf War Not About Patient Care |url= http://chiropractors.asn.au/images/stories/Files/Media%20Releases/Media%20Release%20080313%20Drs%20Tiresome%20Turf%20War.pdf |publisher= [[Chiropractors' Association of Australia]] |accessdate= 10 August 2014 |date= 8 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; however there is evidence from a 2007 [[systematic review]] published in ''[[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]]'' and a 2009 report by four chiropractors which would back up FSM concerns that subluxations are not causally related to disease and thus have no valid clinical applicability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Vohra |first1= S |last2= Johnston |first2= BC |last3= Cramer |first3= K |last4= Humphreys |first4= K |title= Adverse events associated with pediatric spinal manipulation: A systematic review |url= https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0025314/ |journal= [[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]] |volume= 119 |issue= 1 |pages= e275-83 |doi= 10.1542/peds.2006-1392 |pmid= 17178922 |date= 1 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mirtz TA ''et al''.

In March 2014, surgeon John Cunningham and FSM's Joanne Benhamu published an article in ''The Medical Journal of Australia'' calling for a national system for chiropractors to report adverse events in the wake of allegations that a four-month-old baby had a neck fracture following treatment for [[torticollis]].   The Chiropractors' Association of Australia responded by saying that it was in favor of a mandatory adverse reporting system but that it should apply to all health professions and be run through Australian Health Practitioners Regulation Agency (AHPRA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Cunningham |first1= J |last2= Benhamu |first2= J |last3= Hawkes |first3= D |title= The need for a chiropractic adverse events reporting system in Australia |journal= [[The Medical Journal of Australia]] |volume= 200 |issue= |page= 204 |doi= 10.5694/mja13.11347  |pmid= 24580515 |date= 3 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Homeopathy===

In systematic reviews of [[Randomized controlled trial|randomised controlled trials]], [[Cochrane Collaboration|Cochrane Researchers]] examine recent evidence for the safety and effectiveness of therapies. [[Edzard Ernst]] conducted a systematic review of reviews in ''[[Cochrane Library|The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews]]'' (generally considered to be the most reliable source of evidence) in January 2010. Ernst's review, published in ''The Medical Journal of Australia'', concluded, "The findings of currently available Cochrane reviews of studies of homeopathy do not show that homeopathic medicines have effects beyond placebo."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Ernst |first1= E |authorlink= Edzard Ernst |date= 19 April 2010 |title= Homeopathy: What does the "best" evidence tell us? |url= https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2010/192/8/homeopathy-what-does-best-evidence-tell-us |journal= [[The Medical Journal of Australia]] |volume= 192 |issue= 8 |pages= 458–60 |pmid= 20402610}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commenting in an article in ''[[The Guardian]]'' on a [[National Health and Medical Research Council]] (NHMRC) study (draft) debunking homeopathy, FSM co-founder John Dwyer stressed an area that was not investigated; the use of homeopathy for protection. Dwyer told ''The Guardian'', "the most serious issue was the spreading of the concept that homeopathic vaccinations were harmless and just as good as orthodox vaccinations. People who believe that are not protecting themselves and their children."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Davidson |first= Helen |date= 8 April 2014 |title= Homeopathy is bunk, study says |url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/08/homeopathy-is-bunk-study-says |newspaper= [[The Guardian]] |accessdate= 15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1= Luntz |first1= Stephen |title= Meta Study Confirms Homeopathy Doesn't Work |url= http://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/meta-study-confirms-homeopathy-doesnt-work |website= www.iflscience.com |publisher= IFL Science! |accessdate= 23 August 2014 |date= 9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===La Trobe University/Swisse Wellness Partnership Controversy===

In January 2014, La Trobe University formed a A$15M partnership with [[vitamin]] manufacturer [[Swisse Vitamins|Swisse Wellness]], causing a wave of controversy in the Australian medical community.  One month later, [[Ken Harvey (professor)|Ken Harvey]], Adjunct Associate Professor at the School of Public Health at La Trobe, resigned his position, stating "here were clear dangers in conducting research that was paid for by companies, and he could no longer be associated with the university given the 'fraught way' the research was being undertaken."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1= O'Connell |first1= Brigid |last2= Nash |first2= Jonno |title= Dr Ken Harvey resigns from La Trobe University to protest against the $15m deal with Swisse |url= http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/dr-ken-harvey-resigns-from-la-trobe-university-to-protest-against-the-15m-deal-with-swisse/story-fni0fit3-1226818022838?nk=64b410a72fee3140c9e2f94fafbc722c |accessdate= 10 August 2014 |newspaper= [[Herald Sun]] |location= Melbourne |date= 4 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In light of this controversy, FSM wrote to the Australian Government's [[National Health and Medical Research Council|NHMRC]], urging them to "generate formal guidelines for research funding that would reflect the 'world’s best practices,' as this is needed to protect the credibility and integrity of contracted research, particularly where the results could affect the pecuniary interests of the funder." As a result, the NHMRC is reviewing the evidence for the effectiveness of homeopathy and released a resource for clinicians entitled "Talking with your patients about Complementary Medicine – a Resource for Clinicians."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Homeopathy Review: Assessment of the evidence - Effectiveness of Homeopathy for Clinical Conditions |url= https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/your-health/complementary-medicines/homeopathy-review |website= www.nhmrc.gov.au |publisher= [[National Health and Medical Research Council]] |accessdate= 10 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Talking with your patients about Complementary Medicine – a resource for Clinicians |url= https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/guidelines/publications/cam001 |website= www.nhmrc.gov.au |publisher= [[National Health and Medical Research Council]] |accessdate= 10 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
[[Loretta Marron]], CEO of FSM, was awarded a 2014 Medal (OAM) in the General Division of the [[Order of Australia]] "for service to community health".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title= Governor presents Australian awards and honors Tuesday 9 September 2014 |url= http://www.govhouse.qld.gov.au/media/17098/Website-9-September-2014-Invesiture.pdf |publisher= [[Government House, Brisbane|Government House, Queensland]]: [[Government of Australia]] |accessdate= 15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Search Australian Honours: Simple Search: Marron, Loretta Josephine |website= It's An Honour |url= https://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=1149329&amp;search_type=simple&amp;showInd=true |publisher= [[Government of Australia]] |accessdate= 28 July 2014 |date= 26 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marron has also received the Skeptic of the Year award three times from the [[Australian Skeptics]] who wrote she "has made great contributions to public health and the exposure of dangerous and discredited treatments that profit through offering spurious cures to the vulnerable and ill."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Loretta Marron wins Order of Australia |url= http://www.skeptics.com.au/latest/news/loretta-marron-wins-order-of-australia/ |website= www.skeptics.com.au |publisher= [[Australian Skeptics]] |date= 25 January 2014 |accessdate= 15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gleich's syndrome''' or '''episodic angioedema with eosinophilia''' is a rare disease in which the body swells up episodically ([[angioedema]]), associated with raised antibodies of the [[IgM]] type and increased numbers of [[eosinophil granulocyte]]s, a type of [[white blood cell]]s, in the blood ([[eosinophilia]]). It was first described in 1984.&lt;ref name="pmid6727934"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gleich GJ, Schroeter AL, Marcoux JP, Sachs MI, O'Connell EJ, Kohler PF |title=Episodic angioedema associated with eosinophilia |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=310 |issue=25 |pages=1621–6 |year=1984 |pmid=6727934 |doi=10.1056/NEJM198406213102501}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its cause is unknown, but it is unrelated to [[capillary leak syndrome]] (which may cause similar swelling episodes) and [[eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome]] (which features eosinophilia but alternative symptoms). Some studies have shown that edema attacks are associated with degranulation (release of enzymes and mediators from eosinophils), and others have demonstrated [[antibody|antibodies]] against [[endothelium]] (cells lining blood vessels) in the condition.&lt;ref name="pmid10930860"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Emonet S, Kaya G, Hauser C |title=Gleich's syndrome |journal=Ann Dermatol Venereol |volume=127 |issue=6–7 |pages=616–8 |year=2000 |pmid=10930860 |url=http://www.masson.fr/masson/portal/bookmark?Global=1&amp;Path=REVUE/ADE/2000/127/6_7/ARTICLE11105965522.xml|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gleich's syndrome is not a form of the idiopathic [[hypereosinophilic syndrome]] in that there is little or no evidence that it leads to organ damage. Rather, recent studies report that a subset of [[T cell]]s (a special form of lymphocyte blood cell) found in several Gleich syndrome patients have an abnormal [[immunophenotype]], i.e. they express CD3-, CD4+ [[cluster of differentiation]] cell surface antigens. These same aberrant T cell immunophenotypes are found in [[lymphocyte-variant eosinophilia]], a disease in which the aberrant T cells overproduce [[cytokine]]s such as [[interleukin 5]] which simulate the proliferation of eosinophil precursor cells and are thereby responsible for the eosinophilia. It is suggested that most forms of Gleich's syndrome are due to a similar aberrant T cell mechanism and are a subtype of lymphocyte-variant eosinophilia.&lt;ref name="pmid27684977"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Boyer DF | title = Blood and Bone Marrow Evaluation for Eosinophilia | journal = Archives of Pathology &amp; Laboratory Medicine | volume = 140 | issue = 10 | pages = 1060–7 | year = 2016 | pmid = 27684977 | doi = 10.5858/arpa.2016-0223-RA | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gleich syndrome has a good prognosis. Attack severity may improve with [[glucocorticoid|steroid]] treatment.&lt;ref name="pmid6727934"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid10930860"/&gt;

The predominant agency associated with global health (and international health) is the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO). Other important agencies impacting global health include [[UNICEF]] and [[World Food Programme]]. The United Nations system has also played a part with cross-sectoral actions to address global health and its underlying socioeconomic determinants with the declaration of the [[Millennium Development Goals]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/ |title=Millennium Development Goals |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=2013-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the more recent [[Sustainable Development Goals]].

==Definition==

Global health employs several perspectives that focus on the determinants and distribution of health in international contexts:

* [[Medicine]] describes the pathology of diseases and promotes prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Weatherall, D. J., &amp; Clegg, J. B. (2001). Inherited haemoglobin disorders: an increasing global health problem. Bulletin of the World Health Organization, 79(8), 704-712.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Public health]] emphasizes the health of populations.&lt;ref&gt;Fried, L. P., Bentley, M. E., Buekens, P., Burke, D. S., Frenk, J. J., Klag, M. J., &amp; Spencer, H. C. (2010). Global health is public health. The Lancet, 375(9714), 535-537.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Epidemiology]] helps identify risk factors and causes of health problems.&lt;ref&gt;Ahern, M., Kovats, R. S., Wilkinson, P., Few, R., &amp; Matthies, F. (2005). Global health impacts of floods: epidemiologic evidence. Epidemiologic Reviews, 27(1), 36-46.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Demography]] provides data for policy decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Verano, J. W., &amp; Ubelaker, D. H. (1992). Disease and Demography in the Americas.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Economics]] emphasizes the cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit approaches for the optimal allocation of health resources.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, D., Cafiero, E., Jané-Llopis, E., Abrahams-Gessel, S., Bloom, L., Fathima, S., ... &amp; O’Farrell, D. (2012). The global economic burden of noncommunicable diseases. Program on the Global Demography of Aging.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Other social sciences such as [[sociology]], [[development studies]], [[psychology]], [[anthropology]], [[cultural studies]], and [[law]] can help understand the determinants of health in societies.

Both individuals and organizations working in the domain of global health often face many questions regarding [[ethics|ethical]] and [[human rights]]. Critical examination of the various causes and justifications of health inequities is necessary for the success of proposed solutions. Such issues are discussed at the bi-annual [https://www.globalsummit-berlin2016.de Global Summits of National Ethics/Bioethics Councils, next in March 2016 in Berlin], with experts from WHO and UNESCO, by invitation of the German Ethics Council.

==History==

{{see also|Timeline of global health}}

The 19th century held major discoveries in [[medicine]] and [[public health]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalhealthhub.org/timeline Global Health Timeline]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Broad Street cholera outbreak]] of 1854 was central to the development of modern [[epidemiology]]. The microorganisms responsible for [[malaria]] and [[tuberculosis]] were identified in 1880 and 1882, respectively. The 20th century saw the development of preventive and curative treatments for many diseases, including the [[BCG vaccine]] (for tuberculosis) and [[penicillin]] in the 1920s. The eradication of [[smallpox]], with the last naturally occurring case recorded in 1977, raised hope that other diseases could be eradicated as well.

Important steps were taken towards global cooperation in health with the formation of the [[United Nations]] (UN) and the [[World Bank Group]] in 1945, after [[World War II]]. In 1948, the member states of the newly formed United Nations gathered to create the [[World Health Organization]]. A cholera epidemic that took 20,000 lives in Egypt in 1947 and 1948 helped spur the international community to action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of WHO|author=World Health Organization|url=http://www.who.int/library/historical/access/who/index.en.shtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061207150944/http://www.who.int/library/historical/access/who/index.en.shtml|archivedate=2006-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WHO published its [[WHO Model List of Essential Medicines|Model List of Essential Medicines]], and the 1978 [[Alma Ata declaration]] underlined the importance of [[primary health care]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|title=Primary Health Care: Report of the International Conference on Primary Health Care|location=Geneva|publisher=World Health Organization|year=1978|url=http://www.unicef.org/about/history/files/Alma_Ata_conference_1978_report.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a United Nations Summit in 2000, member nations declared eight [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs), which reflected the major challenges facing human development globally, to be achieved by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Resolution adopted by the General Assembly, 55/2|date=18 September 2000|publisher=United Nations|url=https://www.un.org/millennium/declaration/ares552e.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The declaration was matched by unprecedented global investment by donor and recipient countries. According to the UN, these MDGs provided an important framework for development and significant progress has been made in a number of areas.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web

In 2015 a book titled "[[To Save Humanity]]" was published, with nearly 100 essays regarding today's most pressing global health issues.&lt;ref&gt;S.J. Hoffman. 2011. "Ending Medical Complicity in State-Sponsored Torture," The Lancet 378(9802): 1535-1537. doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60816-7.&lt;/ref&gt; The essays were authored by global figures in politics, science, and advocacy ranging from [[Bill Clinton]] to [[Peter Piot]], and addressed a wide range of issues including vaccinations, [[antimicrobial resistance]], health coverage, tobacco use, research methodology, [[climate change]], equity, access to medicine, and media coverage of health research.

==Measures==

Measures of global health include [[disability-adjusted life year]] (DALY), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and [[mortality rate]].&lt;ref name="etches2006"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Etches V, Frank J, Di Ruggiero E, Manuel D |title=Measuring population health: a review of indicators |journal=Annu Rev Public Health |volume=27 |issue= |pages=29–55 |year=2006 |pmid=16533108 |doi=10.1146/annurev.publhealth.27.021405.102141 |url=http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.publhealth.27.021405.102141?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dpubmed|last2=Frank |last3=Di Ruggiero |last4=Manuel }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;]]
{{Main|Disability-adjusted life year}}
The DALY is a summary measure that combines the impact of [[illness]], [[disability]], and mortality by measuring the time lived with disability and the time lost due to premature mortality. One DALY can be thought of as one lost year of "healthy" life. The DALY for a disease is the sum of the years of life lost due to premature mortality and the years lost due to disability for incident cases of the health condition.

===Quality-adjusted life years===
{{Main|Quality-adjusted life year}}
QALYs combine expected survival with expected quality of life into a single number: if an additional year of healthy life is worth a value of one (year), then a year of less healthy life is worth less than one (year). QALY calculations are based on measurements of the value that individuals place on expected years of survival. Measurements can be made in several ways: by techniques that simulate gambles about preferences for alternative states of health, with surveys or analyses that infer willingness to pay for alternative states of health, or through instruments that are based on trading off some or all likely survival time that a medical intervention might provide in order to gain less survival time of higher quality.&lt;ref name="etches2006" /&gt;

===Infant and child mortality===
{{Main|Infant mortality|Child mortality}}
Infant mortality and child mortality for children under age 5 are more specific than DALYs or QALYs in representing the health in the poorest sections of a population, and are thus especially useful when focusing on [[health equity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mulholland E, Smith L, Carneiro I, Becher H, Lehmann D |title=Equity and child-survival strategies |journal=Bull. World Health Organ. |volume=86 |issue=5 |pages=399–407 |date=May 2008 |pmid=18545743 |pmc=2647438 |url=http://www.scielosp.org/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0042-96862008000500018&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en |doi=10.2471/BLT.07.044545|last2=Smith |last3=Carneiro |last4=Becher |last5=Lehmann }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Morbidity===
{{Main|Morbidity}}
Morbidity measures include [[incidence rate]], [[prevalence]], and [[cumulative incidence]], with incidence rate referring to the risk of developing a new health condition within a specified period of time. Although sometimes loosely expressed simply as the number of new cases during a time period, morbidity is better expressed as a proportion or a rate.

==Health conditions==
The diseases and health conditions targeted by global health initiatives are sometimes grouped under "[[diseases of poverty]]" versus "[[diseases of affluence]]", although the impact of globalization is increasingly blurring the lines between the two.

===Respiratory infections===
Infections of the respiratory tract and middle ear are major causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide.&lt;ref name="Lopez AD 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lopez AD, Mathers CD, Ezzati M, Jamison DT, Murray CJ |title=Global and regional burden of disease and risk factors, 2001: systematic analysis of population health data |journal=Lancet |volume=367 |issue=9524 |pages=1747–57 |date=May 2006 |pmid=16731270 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68770-9 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(06)68770-9|last2=Mathers |last3=Ezzati |last4=Jamison |last5=Murray }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some respiratory infections of global significance include [[tuberculosis]], [[measles]], [[influenza]], and [[pneumonia]]s caused by [[pneumococci]] and ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]''. The spread of respiratory infections is exacerbated by crowded conditions, and poverty is associated with more than a 20-fold increase in the relative burden of lung infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mizgerd JP |year=2006 |title=Lung Infection—A Public Health Priority |journal=PLoS Med |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages= e76|publisher= |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0030076 |pmid= 16401173|pmc= 1326257|url=http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pmed.0030076 |accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diarrheal diseases===
[[Diarrhea]] is the second most common cause of child mortality worldwide, responsible for 17% of deaths of children under age 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.childinfo.org/709.htm |title=Statistics by Area – Diarrhoeal disease – The challenge |publisher=UNICEF |accessdate=2013-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poor [[sanitation]] can increase transmission of bacteria and viruses through water, food, utensils, hands, and flies.

===Maternal health===
[[Image:Merlin Maternal.jpg|thumb|Maternal health clinic in Afghanistan (source: [[Merlin]])]]

===HIV/AIDS===
{{Main|HIV|AIDS|}}
The HIV/AIDS epidemic has highlighted the global nature of human health and welfare and globalisation has given rise to a trend toward finding common solutions to global health challenges. Numerous international funds have been set up in recent times to address global health challenges such as HIV. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://globalizationandhealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1744-8603-1-13|title=HIV/AIDS: global trends, global funds and delivery bottlenecks|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;Since the beginning of the epidemic, more than 70 million people have been infected with the HIV virus and about 35 million people have died of HIV. Globally, 36.9 million [31.1–43.9 million] people were living with HIV at the end of 2017. An estimated 0.8% [0.6-0.9%] of adults aged 15–49 years worldwide are living with HIV, although the burden of the epidemic continues to vary considerably between countries and regions. The WHO African region remains most severely affected, with nearly 1 in every 25 adults (4.1%) living with HIV and accounting for nearly two-thirds of the people living with HIV worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/gho/hiv/en/|title=HIV/AIDS|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is transmitted through unprotected sex, unclean needles, blood transfusions, and from mother to child during birth or lactation. Globally, HIV is primarily spread through sexual intercourse. The risk-per-exposure with vaginal sex in low-income countries from female to male is 0.38% and male to female is 0.3%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aidsmap.com/Estimated-risk-per-exposure/page/1324038/#item1324093|title=Estimated HIV transmission risk per exposure for specific activities and events|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;The infection damages the immune system, leading to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and eventually, death. [[Management of HIV/AIDS|Antiretroviral drugs]] prolong life and delay the onset of AIDS by minimizing the amount of HIV in the body.

===Malaria===
{{Main|Malaria}}
Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease caused by the parasites of the genus ''[[Plasmodium]]''. Symptoms may include fever, headaches, chills, and nausea. Each year, there are approximately 500 million cases of malaria worldwide, most commonly among children and pregnant women in developing countries.&lt;ref name="Birn"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Birn, A., Pillay |author2=Yogan, Holtz, T. |year=2009|title=Textbook of International Health|edition=3rd|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=273|isbn=9780199719853}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WHO African Region carries a disproportionately high share of the global malaria burden. In 2016, the region was home to 90% of malaria cases and 91% of malaria deaths. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria|title=Malaria key facts|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;The use of [[Mosquito net|insecticide-treated bednets]] is a cost-effective way to reduce deaths from malaria, as is prompt [[artemisinin]]-based combination therapy, supported by [[intermittent preventive therapy]] in pregnancy. International travellers to [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] zones are advised [[chemoprophylaxis]] with [[antimalarial drugs]] like Atovaquone-proguanil, doxycycline, or mefloquine&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/travelers/country_table/a.html|title=CDC - Malaria - Travelers - Malaria Information and Prophylaxis, by Country|last=Prevention|first=CDC - Centers for Disease Control and|date=2018-01-26|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nutrition===
In 2010, about 104 million children were underweight, and undernutrition contributes to about one third of child deaths around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=World Health Organization|work=Nutrition|title=Challenges|url=http://www.who.int/nutrition/challenges/en/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Undernutrition is not to be confused with ''malnutrition'', which refers to poor ''proportion'' of food intake and can thus refer to obesity.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Shetty | first=Prakash | title=Malnutrition and Undernutrition | journal=Medicine | series=Nutrition | year=2003 | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1357303906004786 | volume=31 | issue=4 | pages=18–22 | doi=10.1383/medc.31.4.18.27958 | issn=1357-3039 | quote=Malnutrition refers to all deviations from adequate and optimal nutritional status, including energy undernutrition and over-nutrition (obesity is a form of malnutrition).

{{Main|Domestic violence}}
[[Violence against women]] has been defined as: "physical, sexual and psychological violence occurring in the family and in the general community, including battering, sexual abuse of children, dowry-related violence, rape, [[female genital mutilation]] and other traditional practices harmful to women, non-spousal violence and violence related to exploitation, sexual harassment and intimidation at work, in educational institutions and elsewhere, trafficking in women, forced prostitution and violence perpetrated or condoned by the state."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=The United Nations Population Fund|year=2005|title=Violence Against Women Fact Sheet|url=http://www.unfpa.org/swp/2005/presskit/factsheets/facts_vaw.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to causing injury, violence may increase "women’s long-term risk of a number of other health problems, including chronic pain, physical disability, drug and alcohol abuse, and depression".&lt;ref&gt;Ellsberg M, and Heise L.

===Chronic disease===
{{Main|Non-communicable disease}}
Approximately 80% of deaths linked to non-communicable diseases occur in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=WHO: Global Status Report on Noncommunicable Diseases 2010|year=2011| url=http://www.who.int/nmh/publications/ncd_report2010/en/}}&lt;/ref&gt;For instance, urbanization and aging have led to increasing poor health conditions related to non-communicable diseases in India. The fastest-growing causes of disease burden over the last 26 years were diabetes (rate increased by 80%) and ischemic heart disease (up 34%).

For example, the rate of [[Diabetes mellitus|type 2 diabetes]], associated with [[obesity]], has been on the rise in countries previously plagued by hunger. In low-income countries, the number of individuals with diabetes is expected to increase from 84 million to 228 million by 2030.&lt;ref name="nejm"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hossain P, Kawar B, El Nahas M |title=Obesity and diabetes in the developing world—a growing challenge |journal=N.

Many populations face an "outcome gap", which refers to the gap between members of a population who have access to medical treatment versus those who do not. Countries facing outcome gaps lack sustainable infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Farmer P |title=The major infectious diseases in the world—to treat or not to treat? |journal=N. Engl.

Journalist [[Laurie Garrett]] argues that the field of global health is not plagued by a lack of funds, but that more funds do not always translate into positive outcomes. The problem lies in the way these funds are allocated, as they are often disproportionately allocated to alleviating a single disease.&lt;ref name="Garrett, Laurie 2007"&gt;{{cite web|author=Garrett, Laurie|year=2007|title=The Challenge of Global Health|work=Foreign Affairs|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/62268/laurie-garrett/the-challenge-of-global-health}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Global Health Security Agenda ==
The Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) is "a multilateral, multi-sector effort that includes 60 participating countries and numerous private and public international organizations focused on building up worldwide health security capabilities toward meeting such threats" as the spread of infectious disease. On March 26-28, 2018, the GHSA held its last high-level meeting which was located in Tbilisi, Georgia on biosurveillance of infectious disease threats, "which include such modern-day examples as HIV/AIDS, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), H1N1 influenza, multi-drug resistant tuberculosis — any emerging or reemerging disease that threatens human health and global economic stability."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://homelandprepnews.com/countermeasures/27450-u-s-critical-juncture-global-health-security-agenda/|title=U.S. at critical juncture with Global Health Security Agenda|last=Riley|first=Kim|date=2018-03-21|work=Homeland Preparedness News|access-date=2018-03-23|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This event brought together GHSA partner countries, contributing countries of Real-Time Surveillance Action Package, and international partner organizations supporting the strengthening of capacities to detect infectious disease threats within the Real-Time Surveillance Action Package and other cross-cutting packages.

[[File:Bhutan Gross National Happiness.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|right|Slogan about Gross National Happiness in Thimphu's School of Traditional Arts.]]

'''Gross National Happiness''' (also known by the acronym: '''GNH''') is a [[philosophy]] that guides the government of [[Bhutan]]. It includes an index which is used to measure the collective happiness and well-being of a population. Gross National Happiness is instituted as the goal of the government of Bhutan in the [[Constitution of Bhutan]], enacted on 18 July 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Constitution of the Kingdom of Bhutan|url=http://www.nationalcouncil.bt/assets/uploads/files/Constitution%20%20of%20Bhutan%20English.pdf|website=National Council|publisher=Royal Government of Bhutan|accessdate=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Gross National Happiness'' was coined in 1972 during an interview by a British journalist for the Financial Times at [[Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport|Bombay airport]] when the then [[List of rulers of Bhutan|king of Bhutan]], [[Jigme Singye Wangchuck]], said "Gross National Happiness is more important than [[Gross domestic product|Gross National Product]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dorji|first1=Tashi|title=The story of a king, a poor country, and a rich idea|url=http://earthjournalism.net/stories/6468|accessdate=1 April 2017|publisher=Business Bhutan|date=15 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://earthjournalism.net/stories/6468|title=The story of a king, a poor country, and a rich idea|last1=Dorji|first1=Tashi|date=15 June 2012|accessdate=1 April 2017|publisher=Business Bhutan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gnhc.gov.bt/en/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/GNH-FAQs-pdf.pdf|title=FAQ on GNH|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, The UN General Assembly passed Resolution "Happiness: towards a holistic approach to development" urging member nations to follow the example of Bhutan and measure happiness and well-being and calling happiness a "fundamental human goal."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://repository.un.org/handle/11176/291712|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171017150819/http://repository.un.org/handle/11176/291712|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2017-10-17|title=Happiness : towards a holistic approach to development : resolution / adopted by the General Assembly|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Bhutan's Prime Minister Jigme Thinley and the Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon of the United Nations convened the ''High Level Meeting: Well-being and Happiness: Defining a New Economic Paradigm'' to encourage the spread of Bhutan's GNH philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/index.php?page=view&amp;type=400&amp;nr=617&amp;menu=35|title=Defining a New Economic Paradigm: The Report of the High-Level Meeting on Wellbeing and Happiness|author=Bhutan|date=2012|publisher=United Nations|access-date=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the High Level meeting, the first [[World Happiness Report]] was issued.  Shortly after the High Level meeting, 20 March was declared to be International Day of Happiness by the UN in 2012 with resolution 66/28.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/66/281|title=Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 28 June 2012 66/281. International Day of Happiness|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bhutan's [[Prime minister|Prime Minister]] [[Tshering Tobgay]] proclaimed a preference for focus on more concrete goals instead of promoting GNH when he took office,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/05/world/asia/index-of-happiness-bhutans-new-leader-prefers-more-concrete-goals.html|title=Index of Happiness?

GNH is distinguishable from [[Gross domestic product|Gross Domestic Product]] by valuing collective happiness as the goal of governance, by emphasizing harmony with nature and traditional values as expressed in the 9 domains of happiness and 4 pillars of GNH.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.grossnationalhappiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/An%20Extensive%20Analysis%20of%20GNH%20Index.pdf|title=An Extensive Analysis of GNH Index|last1=Ura|first1=Karma|last2=Alkire|first2=Sabina|last3=Zangmo|first3=Tshoki|last4=Wangdi|first4=Karma|date=May 2012|publisher=The Centre for Bhutan Studies|location=Thimphu, Bhutan|accessdate=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four pillars of GNH's are 1) [[Sustainable development|sustainable]] and [[Social development theory|equitable]] socio-economic development; 2) [[Environmental protection|environmental conservation]]; 3) preservation and promotion of culture; and 4) good governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tenth Five-Year Plan: 2008-2013|publisher=Gross National Happiness Commission - Royal Government of Bhutan, Actual Date of Publishing 25 June 2009 |location=Thimphu, Bhutan|url=http://www.gnhc.gov.bt/wp-content/uploads/2011/10thplan/TenthPlan_Vol1_Web.pdf|accessdate=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The nine domains of GNH are psychological well-being, health, time use, education, cultural diversity and resilience, good governance, community vitality, ecological diversity and resilience, and living standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ura|first1=Karma|date=2008|title=Understanding the Development Philosophy of Gross National Happiness|journal=Interview with Bhutan Broadcasting Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grossnationalhappiness.com/|title=Welcome to the CBS's works on Gross National Happiness!|website=Gross National Happiness|publisher=www.grossnationalhappiness.com/|accessdate=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each domain is composed of [[Survey methodology|subjective]] (survey-based) and objective indicators.

==Implementation of GNH in Bhutan==
The Gross National Happiness Commission is charged with implementing GNH in Bhutan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gnhc.gov.bt/en/|title=Gross National Happiness Commission|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GNH Commission is composed of the Secretaries each of the ministries of the government, the Prime Minister, and the Secretary of the GNH Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gnhc.gov.bt/en/commission-members/|title=Commission Members|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The GNH Commission's tasks include conceiving and implementing the nation's 5-year plan and promulgating policies. The GNH Index is used to measure the happiness and well-being of Bhutan's population. A GNH Policy Screening Tool&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gnhcentrebhutan.org/what-is-gnh/gnh-screening-tool/|title=GNH Screening Tool|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a GNH Project Screening Tool is used by the GNH commission to determine whether to pass policies or implement projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.grossnationalhappiness.com/gnh-policy-and-project-screening-tools/|title=GNH Tools|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The GNH Screening tools used by the Bhutanese GNH Commission for anticipating the impact of policy initiatives upon the levels of GNH in Bhutan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pennock|first1=M|last2=Ura|first2=K|year=|title=Gross national happiness as a framework for health impact assessment|url=|journal=Environmental Impact Assessment Review|volume=31|issue=|pages=61–65|doi=10.1016/j.eiar.2010.04.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the first GNH survey was conducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/site/ssfc2011/48920513.pdf|title=The Gross National Happiness Index of Bhutan.

The first GNH surveys consisted of long questionnaires that polled the citizens about living conditions and religious behavior, including questions about the times a person prayed in a day and other [[Karma]] indicators. It took several hours to complete one questionnaire. Later rounds of the GNH Index were shortened, but the survey retained the religious behavioral indicators.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.grossnationalhappiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Short-GNH-Index-edited.pdf||title=Short Guide to GNH Index}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bhutan GNH Index was developed by the [[Centre for Bhutan Studies]] with the help of the researchers from Oxford University researchers to help measure the progress of Bhutanese society. The Index function was based on Alkire &amp; Foster method of 2011.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ophi.org.uk/policy/national-policy/gross-national-happiness-index/|title=Bhutan’s Gross National Happiness Index|last=|first=|date=|website=Oxford Poverty and Human Development Index|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the creation of the national GNH Index, the government used the metric to measure national progress and inform policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adler|first=Alejandro|date=2009|title=Gross National Happiness in Bhutan: A Living Example of an Alternative Approach to Progress|url=https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1003&amp;context=sire|journal=Social Impact Research Experience|volume=1|pages=1–137|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Musikanski|first=Laura|date=2014|title=Happiness in Public Policy|url=http://scholarworks.waldenu.edu/jsc/vol6/iss1/5/|journal=Walden University Journal of Social Change|volume=6|pages=55–85|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bhutan GNH Index is considered to measure societal progress similarly to other models such as the [[Gross National Well-being]] of 2005, the OECD [[Better Life Index]] of 2011, and SPI [[Social Progress Index]] of 2013. One distinguishing feature of Bhutan GNH Index from the other models is that the other models are designed for secular governments and do not include religious behavior measurement components.

The data is used to compare the happiness between different groups of [[Citizenship|citizens]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ophi.org.uk/policy/national-policy/gross-national-happiness-index/|title=Bhutan’s Gross National Happiness Index|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and changes over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.grossnationalhappiness.com/category/survey-report/|title=A Compass Towards a Just and Harmoneous Society: 2015 GNH Survey Report|date=2016|publisher=Centre for Bhutan Studies &amp; GNH Research|isbn=978-99936-14-86-9|location=Thimphu, Bhutan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spread of GNH Outside of Bhutan==
In [[Victoria, British Columbia]], [[Canada]], a shortened version of Bhutan's GNH survey was used by the local government, local foundations and governmental agencies under the leadership of Martha and Michael Pennock to assess the population of Victoria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://victoriafoundation.bc.ca/past-initiatives/happiness-index-partnership/|title=The Happiness Index Partnership|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pri.org/stories/2011-10-03/measuring-happiness-victoria-british-columbia|title=Measuring Happiness in Victoria, British Columbia|last=Chatterjee|first=Rhitu|date=3 October 2011|website=pri.org|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[São Paulo (state)|state of São Paulo]], [[Brazil]], Susan Andrews,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Susan_Andrews|title=Susan Andrews|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; through her organization Future Vision Ecological Park, used a version of Bhutan's GNH at a [[community]] level in some cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPeNwH3ax-c&amp;feature=youtu.be|title=GNH ´s Pilot Project in Brazil|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Seattle|Seattle, Washington]], [[United States]], a version of the GNH Index was used by the Seattle City Council and Sustainable Seattle to assess the happiness and well-being of the Seattle Area population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Musikanski|first=Laura|date=January 2013|title=The Happiness Initiative: The Serious Business of Well-Being|url=https://www.thesolutionsjournal.com/article/the-happiness-initiative-the-serious-business-of-well-being/|journal=Solutions Journal|volume=4|pages=34–39|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://newdream.org/blog/2011-11-happiness-initiative|title=Does Your Town Need A Happiness Index?|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.citylab.com/design/2011/11/how-happy-seattle/565/|title=How Happy is Seattle?|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other cities and areas in North America, including [[Eau Claire, Wisconsin|Eau Claire, Wisconsin]], [[Creston, British Columbia]] and the U.S. state of [[Vermont]], also used a version of the GNH Index.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wikiprogress.org/data/organization/happiness-alliance|title=WikiProgress Knowledge Base - Happiness Alliance|last=|first=|date=|website=WikiProgress.org|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[University of Oregon]], United States, a behavioral model of GNH based on the use of positive and negative words in [[social network]] status updates was developed by Adam Kramer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kramer|first1=Adam|title=An unobtrusive behavioral model of "gross national happiness"|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1753326.1753369|journal=Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems|pages=287–290|accessdate=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, [[Thailand]] launched its own GNH center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thainews.prd.go.th/website_en/news/news_detail/WNPOL5910120010021|title=Thailand GNH Center|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202044010/http://thainews.prd.go.th/website_en/news/news_detail/WNPOL5910120010021|archivedate=2 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former king of Thailand, Bhumibol Adulyadej, was a close friend of King Jigme Singye Wangchuck, and conceived the similar philosophy of [[Sufficiency economy|Sufficiency Economy]].

In the [[Philippines]], the concept of GNH has been lauded by various personalities, notably Philippine senator and UN Global Champion for Resilience [[Loren Legarda]], and former environment minister [[Gina Lopez]]. Bills have been filed in the Philippine Senate and House of Representatives in support of Gross National Happiness in the Philippines. Additionally, Executive Director of Bhutan’s GNH Center, Dr. Saamdu Chetri, has been invited by high-level officials in the Philippines for a GNH Forum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/242511/242511/|title=How PH can have Gross National Happiness, too|first=Cathy|last=Cañares-Yamsuan|date=|website=inquirer.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.mb.com.ph/2016/11/03/gross-national-happiness-for-ph-fvr-still-needed-malacanang/|title=Gross National Happiness for PH; FVR still needed – Malacañang|author=|date=|website=mb.com.ph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguidon.com/1112/main/2016/10/bhutan-happiness-guru-speaks-gross-national-happiness/|title=Bhutan ‘happiness guru’ speaks on ‘Gross National Happiness’|author=|date=23 October 2016|website=theguidon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other cities and governments have undertaken efforts to measure happiness and well-being (also termed "Beyond GDP"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fabriquespinoza.fr/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/D5-2_BRAINPOoL_Final_Report-2.pdf|title=BRAINPOoL Final Report: Beyond GDP – From Measurement to Politics and Policy|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) since the High Level Meeting in 2012, but have not used versions of Bhutan's GNH index. Among these include the national governments of the [[United Kingdom]]'s Office of National Statistics&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/wellbeing/bulletins/measuringnationalwellbeing/2015-09-23|title=Measuring National Well-being: Personal Well-being in the UK, 2014 to 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United Arab Emirates]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.happy.ae/en|title=Happy UAE|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cities including [[Somerville, Massachusetts]], United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://data.somervillema.gov/Happiness/Somerville-Happiness-Survey-responses-2011-2013-20/w898-3dfm|title=Somerville Happiness Survey responses - 2011, 2013, 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bristol]], United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.happycity.org.uk/measurement-policy/happiness-pulse/|title=Happy City Happiness Pulse|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also a number of companies which are implementing sustainability practices in business have been inspired by GNH.&lt;ref&gt;Sander G. Tideman (2016), Gross National Happiness: Lessons for sustainability Leadership, South Asian Journal of Global Business Research, Vol. 5 Iss 2 pp. 190 – 213&lt;/ref&gt;

Gross National Happiness is also promoted in the United States by a nonprofit organization, [http://gnhusa.org/ Gross National Happiness USA].  Headquartered in Vermont, GNHUSA is a 501c(3) tax-exempt non-profit organization with a mission to increase personal happiness and the collective wellbeing by changing how the United States measure their progress and success. GNHUSA was founded after Linda Wheatley of Montpelier, Vermont, attended the 2008 Annual Gross National Happiness Research Conference in Thimphu, Bhutan. Wheatley returned to Vermont determined to introduce the little-known GNH concepts to the general public in the U.S. After establishing the nonprofit in the spring of 2009, representatives of the group attended the fifth international GNH research conference in Brazil in November 2009 and, in June 2010, hosted the first US-based conference on Gross National Happiness and other alternative indicators, at Champlain College in Burlington, Vermont. In May of 2012, GNHUSA with co-sponsors organized Measure What Matters, a conference building a collaborative of data experts in Vermont. The state of Vermont's Governor declared April 13th (President Jefferson’s birthday) “Pursuit of Happiness Day,” and became the first state to pass legislation enabling development of alternative indicators and to assist in making policy. GNHUSA collaborates with the Vermont Data Center to perform a [http://gnhusa.org/alternative-indicators/measuring-well-vermont-leads-way/ periodic study of well-being in the state], as a pilot for other states and municipalities. The organization also collaborates closely with the Happiness Alliance in collecting online GNH data, based on the domain of happiness developed by Bhutan.  In 2017, GNHUSA initiated the process of establishing chapters in all 50 states to work with local governments and institutions on well-being initiatives, beginning with Wisconsin and North Carolina. 
The organization also promotes the U.N.-designated International Happiness Day (March 20) as an opportunity to discuss the concepts of well-being with others at [http://gnhusa.org/happiness-dinners/ Happiness Dinners] across the country.

From August 25, 2012 to the present, GNHUSA has been carrying out a nationwide action research project, [http://gnhusa.org/serious-about-happiness/the-science-of-happiness-walking/ The Happiness Walk], carried out by GNHUSA board members and supporters. On the first leg, two GNHUSA board members walked 594 miles, from Vermont to Washington DC; the Walk most recently completed a leg from Santa Monica, CA to the Bay Area, with a side trip to Hawaii, and resumed March 1, 2018, walking from Petaluma CA to Seattle, Washington, on the 13th leg of the journey. Along the way, Walkers perform audio and video interviews and collect survey responses, introducing the concept of GNH and amassing data that will assist them in tailoring the GNH domains and indicators to American culture.
GNHUSA also posts and promotes a [http://gnhusa.org/charter-for-happiness/ Charter for Happiness] which, as of May 7, 2018, has 469 signatories.

==Criticism==

GNH has been described by critics as a [[propaganda]] tool used by the Bhutanese government to distract from [[Ethnic cleansing in Bhutan|ethnic cleansing]] and [[human rights in Bhutan|human rights abuses]] it has committed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thapa|first1=Saurav Jung|title=Bhutan’s Hoax: of Gross National Happiness|work=Wave Magazine|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713000732/http://wavemag.com.np/issue/article3775.html|date=July 2011|archive-date=13 July 2011|url=http://wavemag.com.np/issue/article3775.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Vishal|last1=Arora|title=Bhutan’s Human Rights Record Defies ‘Happiness’ Claim|url=http://thediplomat.com/2014/04/bhutans-human-rights-record-defies-happiness-claim/|date=25 April 2014|work=The Diplomat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bhutanese democracy|Bhutanese democratic]] government began in 2008. Before that time the [[ethnic cleansing in Bhutan]] of non-Buddhist population of ethnic Nepalese of Hindu faith as a result of the GNH cultural preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/enigma-bhutan/|title=The Enigma of Bhutan|last=Bird|first=Kai|date=March 7, 2012|website=The Nation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/101east/2014/05/bhutan-forgotten-people-201452081049514496.html|title=Bhutan's Forgotten People|last=|first=|date=May 30, 2014|website=Aljazeera|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] [[Human Rights Watch]] documented the events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/asia/bhutan|title=Bhutan|last=|first=|date=|website=Human Rights Watch|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Human Rights Watch, "Over 100,000 or 1/6 of the population of Bhutan of Nepalese origin and [[Hindu]] faith were expelled from the country because they would not integrate with Bhutan’s [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] culture."&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch https://www.hrw.org/news/2008/02/01/bhutans-ethnic-cleansing&lt;/ref&gt; The Refugee Council of Australia stated that "it is extraordinary and shocking that a nation can get away with expelling one sixth of its people and somehow keep its international reputation largely intact. The Government of Bhutan should be known not for Gross National Happiness but for Gross National [[Hypocrisy]]."&lt;ref&gt;The Australian Refugee Council https://www.refugeecouncil.org.au/media/time-to-challenge-bhutans-gross-national-hypocrisy/&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers state that Bhutan's GNH philosophy “has evolved over the last decade through the contribution of western and local scholars to a version that is more [[Democracy|democratic]] and open. Therefore, probably, the more accurate historical reference is to mention the coining of the GNH phrase as a key event, but not the Bhutan GNH philosophy, because the philosophy as understood by western scholars is different from the philosophy used by the King at the time.”&lt;ref&gt;The History of Gross National Happiness https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317151566_The_History_of_Gross_National_Happiness&lt;/ref&gt; Other viewpoints are that GNH is a process of development and learning, rather than an objective norm or absolute end point. Bhutan aspires to enhance the happiness of its people and GNH serves as a measurement tool for realizing that aspiration.&lt;ref&gt;Sander G. Tideman (2016), Gross National Happiness: Lessons for Sustainability Leadership South Asian Journal of Global Business Research, Vol. 5 Iss 2 pp. 190 – 213&lt;/ref&gt;

Other criticism focuses on the standard of living in Bhutan. In an article written in 2004 in the [[The Economist|Economist magazine]], “The Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan is not in fact an idyll in a fairy tale. It is home to perhaps 900,000 people most of whom live in grinding poverty."&lt;ref&gt;The Economist Magazine http://www.economist.com/node/3445119&lt;/ref&gt;  Other criticism of GNH cites "increasing levels of [[political corruption]], the rapid spread of diseases such as [[HIV/AIDS|aids]] and [[tuberculosis]], [[Gang|gang violence]], abuses against women and ethnic minorities, shortages in food/medicine, and economic woes."&lt;ref&gt;The GSD Magazine https://www.gsdmagazine.org/the-false-promises-of-bhutans-gross-national-happiness/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://2008.bhutan-360.com/gross-national-happiness-happy-in-bhutan/|title=Gross National Happiness – Happy in Bhutan?|last=|first=|date=December 1, 2008|website=Bhutan, 2008 and Beyond|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== First cases ==
According to a 1998 report released by the office of the Honduran Secretary of Public Health, the incubation period, during which HIV/AIDS was first introduced into the Honduran population without being recognized, is estimated to have been during the end of the 1970s and into the early 1980s. In 1984, the first case of HIV/AIDS in Honduras was identified in a man who reported having travelled to [[San Francisco]] multiple times in the years preceding his diagnosis, which was confirmed in 1985 when he tested positive for [[Kaposi's sarcoma]] and [[Antibody|antibodies]] for HIV. Four men, all reporting having traveled outside of the country, constituted the first cases recognized in Honduras. Three of those men were likely to have contracted HIV from homosexual transmission, while one contracted the virus likely from heterosexual transmission. 

By 1992, the 100 Honduran cases of HIV/AIDS included almost every risk group associated with HIV/AIDS: [[men who have sex with men]] (MSM), men who have sex with men and women (MSM/W), commercial sex workers, children of HIV-positive mothers, intravenous drug users, and blood transfusion recipients. Since spreading to other populations, HIV/AIDS is considered to be transmitted mainly heterosexually in Honduras and thought to have been introduced to the heterosexual population through bisexual transmission. Additionally, groups such as marines and soldiers, who have increased interaction with the exterior and are also more likely to have multiple sexual partners, contributed to the spread of HIV/AIDS throughout Honduras.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A 1997 study found prevalence of 6.8% among military recruits.&lt;ref name="usaid" /&gt;

==Prevalence and causes==

=== Geographical predominance ===
[[File:Tegucigalpa location.png|thumb|Map of Honduras, delineating its departments, and its capital Tegucigalpa]]
The areas most heavily affected by HIV/AIDS cases tend to be within what is called the Central Corridor of Development (''Corridor Central de Desarrollo''), affecting urban areas such as Tegucigalpa, San Pedro Sula, La Ceiba, El Progreso, Comayagua, Puerto Cortés, Tela, La Lima, and Choluteca. The disease originated in the northern part of the country, with especially high rates in Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula, which was the original epicenter of the disease. In San Pedro Sula, rates of HIV prevalence were estimated to be as high as 14 to 21% of the population at the height of the epidemic in Honduras. HIV/AIDS has since spread to the south, east, and west of Honduras, including the Honduran Bay Islands in the Caribbean, though these regions were affected later.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Municipalities with the highest reported incidences of HIV infection are found on the border with neighboring countries El Salvador, Guatemala, and Nicaragua.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; On the northern coast of Honduras, the Garífuna minority group experiences particularly high rates of HIV prevalence.&lt;ref name="Atkinson_2018" /&gt;

=== Demographical predominance ===
HIV/AIDS has most affected young people in Honduras, ranging from 20 to 39 years of age.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The main risk groups associated with HIV/AIDS in Honduras are female sex workers (FSWs), men who have sex with men (MSM), the Garífuna community, prisoners, and transgender women.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The [[United Nations Joint Programme on AIDS]] (UNAIDS) released the following statistics regarding the HIV prevalence among different risk groups in Honduras&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unaids.org/en/regionscountries/countries/honduras|title=Honduras|website=www.unaids.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

* 5.3% among sex workers
* 11.7% among gay men and men who have sex with men
* 11.9% among transgender people

Additionally, prevalence rates among prisoners have been found to be as high as 7.6%.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In 2005 the national prevalence among sex workers was 9.68% according to a UNAIDS document on CONASIDA. 47% of the cases of HIV recorded in 2004 were women,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; and in that same year around 0.5% of women in antenatal surveillance studies were HIV positive.&lt;ref name="Paz-Bailey_2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Paz-Bailey|first=Gabriela, et al.,|vauthors=|date=2009|title=High Rates of STD and Sexual Risk Behaviors Among Garífunas in Honduras|url=https://ovidsp.tx.ovid.com/sp-3.31.1b/ovidweb.cgi?QS2=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|journal=JAIDS Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes|volume=51, Supplement 1|issue=|pages=S26–34|doi=|pmid=|via=Ovid}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, women account for more of emerging infections than men do.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Proposed national causes ===
While it is not known exactly why the epidemic in Honduras became so severe, some experts, such as epidemiologists like Manuel Sierra, attribute its severity to the long incubation period of the disease in the country. Other reasons to which specialists attribute the state of the Honduran epidemic include increased international military presence due to the Cold War, during which Honduras experienced an influx of both international military personnel and also contras from neighboring Nicaragua, who helped to stimulate the commercial sex industry on a national level.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

===Among the Garífuna===
The [[Garifuna|Garífuna]], of Afro-Caribbean descent, are one of at least eight minority groups within Honduras and one of the few for which HIV prevalence rates are known.&lt;ref name="Paz-Bailey_2009"/&gt; Heterosexual transmission rates among the Garífuna are comparable to those of sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite | vauthors = Sabin M, Luber G, Sabin K, Paredes M, Monterroso E | title = Rapid ethnographic assessment of HIV/AIDS among Garifuna communities in Honduras: informing HIV surveillance among Garifuna women. | journal = Journal of Human Behavior in the Social Environment | date = September 2008 | volume = 17 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 237–57 | doi = 10.1080/10911350802067773 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2005, the prevalence of HIV among the Garífuna was estimated to be somewhere between 8 and 14% of this population.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Among this population, condom use was reported in 2009 to be only 10.6% in stable couples and 41.4% in casual couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/e672442007-017|title=UNAIDS releases report on global AIDS efforts|last=|first=|date=2006|website=PsycEXTRA Dataset|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; HIV was higher among Garífunas residing in urban areas. In addition to low condom use and urban living, researchers suggest that the high rates of HIV prevalence may be due to the migratory working patterns of Garífuna men, who often travel seasonally to the United States or cities, such as San Pedro Sula where HIV prevalence is particularly high, for their jobs in shipping and fishing. Other possible contributing factors are sexual violence, the inability of women to control their sexual experiences, multiple sex partners, remuneration received for sex, with 6% of subjects reporting having received money for sex in a 2009 study, and first sexual encounters for men at 15 and women at 17.&lt;ref name="Paz-Bailey_2009" /&gt;

Prevalence among Garífuna was 3.8% among men and 5.1% among women as of 2006, indicating rates more than three times those of the national average. In a 2015 study, men were found to be more than four times as likely to have had multiple sex partners within the last 12 months than women.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Garífuna women remain an especially disenfranchised group and have been subject to treatment methods as radical as forced sterilization.&lt;ref name="Atkinson_2018" /&gt; Only 9% of Garífuna men were reported to have been circumcised,&lt;ref name="Paz-Bailey_2009"/&gt; which is proven to be a successful method at lowering risk of HIV contraction through heterosexual transmission by as much as 60%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/hiv/topics/malecircumcision/en/|title=Male circumcision for HIV prevention|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; High rates of other [[Sexually transmitted infection|sexually transmitted infections]] (STIs) such as syphilis and herpes ([[Herpes simplex virus|HSV-2)]] were also found among the Garífuna in a 2009 study,&lt;ref name="Paz-Bailey_2009" /&gt; and high rates of other STIs are linked to a higher risk of HIV infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/std/hiv/stdfact-std-hiv-detailed.htm|title=Detailed STD Facts - HIV/AIDS &amp; STDs|date=2018-09-14|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although traditional health care is available to some within this community, the Garífuna have also developed their own methods of educating their community and spreading knowledge of prevention: utilizing their traditional musical forms to accompany informational plays about HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/03/29/172602211/in-honduras-fighting-hiv-aids-through-music-and-theater|title=In Honduras, Fighting HIV/AIDS Through Music And Theater|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-11-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations, such as the Pan American Social Marketing Organization (PASMO), have adopted similar education tactics, such as bingo games in which each space on a playing card contains a picture of HIV/AIDS or another STD.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Jon|date=2006-07-28|title=Why So High?

==National response==

=== Early response ===
National efforts to reduce the number of new HIV infections have been in place since the late 1980s. The national response to HIV/AIDS has been led by the Ministry of Health, with collaboration from other ministries and several [[Non-governmental organization|nongovernmental organizations]] (NGOs). The Health Secretariat solidified the creation of the National AIDS Control Program (PNS) between 1989 and 1994 in an effort to improve health infrastructure, create a national counseling network, and standardize treatment for Hondurans living with HIV/AIDS. During this same time period, the National AIDS Commission (COMSIDA) was also founded. Since the beginning of its involvement in preventing the spread of HIV, the Honduran government has sought to establish multi-sector programs, such as COMSIDA, which was reorganized in 1999 into CONASIDA, with fifteen national institutions or organizations represented. Similarly, the Strategic Plan for the Fight Against AIDS, in place from 1998 to 2002, included the response capabilities of both governmental and nongovernmental bodies and organizations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; By the beginning of the 1990s, blood began to be screened for HIV on a national scale in Honduras, five years after the US began screening blood donations. HIV/AIDS cases due to blood transfusions began to decrease by 1991.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Recent response and current policies ===
HIV/AIDS was declared a national priority between 2002 and 2006 under President Ricardo Maduro,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; who publicly committed himself to support the national response to HIV/AIDS and identified HIV/AIDS as one of five health issues to receive priority government attention. 

Current programs focus on prevention, education, comprehensive care, and the rights of HIV-positive people. Prevention efforts, executed among various governmental and nongovernmental organizations like NGOs, churches, and schools, have specifically targeted groups especially at risk for HIV/AIDS, such as sex workers, members of the gay and lesbian community, mobile populations, and members of the Garífuna ethnic population. In the education system, teachers were trained in 2005 to educate their students about reproductive health, STIs, and HIV/AIDS, and these topics have become integrated into the national curriculum in Honduran schools.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Despite these education and awareness efforts, in 2013, still around half of Hondurans infected were unaware they were living with HIV.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theglobalfund.org/en/portfolio/country/?k=38565614-b542-4558-96f5-6c0ab3e36f97&amp;loc=HND|title=Country: Concept Note HIV/AIDS - 2015 (PDF)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.theglobalfund.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Honduras’s long-term plan is to prevent new infections and to provide services to those who are most at risk for HIV infection, including young people, sex workers, men who have sex with men, institutionalized persons, and the Garífuna ethnic group. In 2017, the Ministry of Health resolved to cover all treatment for those living with HIV, regardless of CD4 count, and internal funding covers 95% and 70% of treatment costs and preventative efforts respectively.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== International response and aid ==

The [[Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;has disbursed US$90,720,054 of the US$96,502,161 originally signed to Honduras for HIV/AIDS programs alone. According to USAIDS, another international body that supports programs addressing HIV/AIDS in Honduras, Global Fund programs have three main goals: to promote the protection of the rights of people living with HIV/AIDS ([[PLWHA|PLWHA)]], create awareness surrounding risks and risk-reducing measures among particularly vulnerable populations, and make health services more accessible to these populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hivhealthclearinghouse.unesco.org/sites/default/files/resources/1.401_Honduras_HIV_Prevention_Evaluation_FINAL_Public_-_508_3.29.11.pdf|title=USAID/Honduras: HIV/AIDS Prevention Programs Evaluation|last=Terrell|first=Stanley|date=January 2011|website=unesco.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS ([[UNAIDS]]) has been another significant supporter of HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, and care in Honduras. Other international bodies that have assisted programs in Honduras include the Swedish International Development Agency, Canadian International Development Agency, Department for International Development (United Kingdom), Humanist Institute for Development Cooperation, Christian Aid, Catholic Relief Services, German Cooperation Agency, Cooperative for American Relief Everywhere, Inc. (CARE), and the Red Cross. USAID programs include partnership directly with the Honduran government through projects such as AIDSTAR-One (AIDS Support and Technical Assistance Resources) but also include funding of individual, local organizations and NGOs, such as ''Fundación para el Fomento en Salud.''&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hivhealthclearinghouse.unesco.org/sites/default/files/resources/1.401_Honduras_HIV_Prevention_Evaluation_FINAL_Public_-_508_3.29.11.pdf|title=USAID/Honduras: HIV/AIDS Prevention Programs Evaluation|last=|first=|date=January 2011|website=UNESCO|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Doctors Without Borders (''[[Médecins Sans Frontières|Medecins sans Frotieres]])'' has also been active in the country since 1974. Their HIV/AIDS programs in Honduras focus on antenatal care and their ''servicio prioritario'', or priority service, which consists of free and confidential [[post-exposure prophylaxis]] and psychological counseling to rape victims. As of 2017, Doctors Without Borders had provided 2,300 mental health consultations, 6,800 antenatal consultations, 800 postnatal consultations, assisted in 400 births, and treated 600 patients after experiences of sexual violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.msf.org/international-activity-report-2017/honduras|title=Honduras {{!}} Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) International|website=Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) International|language=en|access-date=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Access to ARV treatment ==
[[Antiretroviral Therapy|Antiretroviral therapy]] was only offered in the Honduran public health system as of 2002. In 2001, 18 million [[Honduran lempira|lempiras]] were allocated to the purchase of ART in 2002, and the Honduran government aims to achieve universal ART access. Currently, the Honduran government spends 40 million lempiras annually to provide this treatment.&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.elheraldo.hn/pais/1164412-466/tres-personas-se-infectan-a-diario-con-vih-en-honduras|title=Tres personas se infectan a diario con VIH en Honduras - Diario El Heraldo|work=Diario El Heraldo|access-date=2018-10-28|language=es-LA}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, it was estimated that 4,500 people were receiving ART treatment, but CONASIDA estimated that only one-third of people with advanced HIV were actually receiving their drugs.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Beyond simply providing the antiretroviral drugs themselves, programs such as the Inter-institutional Alliance for the Improved Nutrition of People Living with HIV/AIDS (IMANAS) have attempted to alleviate among households receiving ART the added stressor of lack of food, which can negatively impact people's ability to adhere to their ART regimens.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Despite these efforts, in a study published in 2011, researchers found that 87% of households receiving ART in Honduras were food insecure, which was reflected by the 15% of these households in which ART adherence was inadequate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martinez|first=Homero|last2=Ramirez|first2=Blanca Yohisy|last3=Palar|first3=Kartika|last4=Adams|first4=Jayne|last5=Farias|first5=Hugo|last6=Green|first6=Hank|last7=Wagner|first7=Glenn|last8=Derose|first8=Katie|date=2011-04-01|title=Food security, nutrition and HIV/AIDS – overview and context in Honduras|url=https://www.fasebj.org/doi/10.1096/fasebj.25.1_supplement.780.6|journal=The FASEB Journal|language=en|doi=10.1096/fasebj.25.1_supplement.780.6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, 42% of people were still accessing health care and receiving treatment after 12 months, and one in three patients had reached an undetectable viral load.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; As of 2016, 51% of Honduras affected by HIV/AIDS were able to receive [[antiretroviral treatment]] (ART), and 54% of HIV-positive pregnant women were receiving treatment or had utilized prophylaxis as a means of prevention of mother to child transmission ([[PMTCT]]).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As of 2018, a total of 12,789 individuals were reported to be receiving ART, according to El Heraldo.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt;

== Activism ==
The Special Law on HIV/AIDS, passed by Congress and allowing CONASIDA to be formed in order to protect the rights of Hondurans living with HIV/AIDS, is attributed greatly to activism on the part of Hondurans living with HIV/AIDS and civil society workers in a 2005 special report created for the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Honduran National Association of People Living with HIV (''Asociación Nacional de Honduras de Personas que Viven con el VIH'') ===
The Honduran National Association of People Living with HIV, in part facilitated by USAID funds, has served to empower those in Honduras living with HIV/AIDS and was established to protect their human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://aidsfree.usaid.gov/resources/diagn%C3%B3stico-de-los-servicios-ofrecidos-por-la-asociaci%C3%B3n-nacional-de-personas-viviendo-con|title=Diagnóstico de los Servicios Ofrecidos por la Asociación Nacional de Personas Viviendo con VIH/SIDA en Honduras|date=2015-09-14|work=AIDSFree|access-date=2018-10-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded by Allan Dunaway, who also served as its president and give a face to HIV/AIDS in Honduras and essentially all of Latin America, as he was one of the first Latin American HIV/AIDS activists.

Together, they also founded ''Fundación Llaves'', and Dunaway worked directly with the National Commission of Human Rights (Comisionado Nacional de los Derechos Humanos).

The '''Health Metrics Network (HMN)''' was a global health partnership focused on strengthening [[health information system]]s in low and middle income countries, launched in May 2005 during the 58th session of the [http://www.who.int/gb/ World Health Assembly (WHA)] and dissolved on 31 May 2013.&lt;ref name="apps.who.int"&gt;{{cite web |title=WHO’s arrangement for hosting health partnerships and proposals for harmonizing WHO’s work with hosted partnerships |publisher=World Health Organization |date=January 18, 2013 |url=http://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/EB132/B132_5Add9-en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hosted by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], the HMN's stated purpose was to make available timely and accurate health information by encouraging joint funding and development of country health information systems,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/healthmetrics/about/whatwillhmndo/en/index.html HMN website] . Accessed June 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; to improve health and save lives.

HMN also promoted research and technical innovation. Specifically, HMN pursued interrelated objectives as below:
* Setting up a framework for country health information system (HIS) development (the HMN Framework) which prescribes standards for health information systems;
* Recording every birth, death and cause of death (MOVE-IT for the MDGs);
* Developing methods to track progress in health information systems; and
* Ensuring access and use of information at all levels.&lt;ref name=hmn/&gt;

==Structure==
[[Image:DFID 4 Dr. Sally Stansfield.jpg|thumb|Sally Stansfield, Former Executive Secretary]]
HMN had an organizational structure composed of an Executive Board and a Secretariat. The HMN Executive Board coordinated the Network and made decisions; membership comprised key health information workers, including health and statistical experts, technical and development partners and funding agencies in developing and other countries.

The Secretariat supported HMN partners; it comprised an Executive Secretary, and core technical and administrative staff, based at the World Health Organization in Geneva, Switzerland.

==Achievements==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}
* The ''HMN Framework and Standards for Country Health Information Systems'' was used by over 85 countries in all six WHO Regions to make an assessment of their health information systems. The  ''HMN Framework'' was also used by partners such as the World Bank, Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, USAID, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Africa Development Bank.
* The ''HMN Framework'' is credited for health information system-related improvements in terms of lives and money saved, and for cost-effectiveness. HMN has tracked and documented over US $500 million being associated with the improvements of country health information systems.
* In 2007, the World Health Assembly passed a resolution (WHA60.27) entitled ''Strengthening of health information systems''. The resolution acknowledges that sound information is critical in framing evidence-based health policy and making decisions, and is fundamental for monitoring progress towards internationally agreed health-related development goals. The resolution urges Members States, all stakeholders and the WHO Director-General to take specific steps to support the strengthening of health information systems, given that such systems in most developing countries are weak.
* A joint initiative with The Lancet launched a successful global advocacy campaign on the monitoring of vital events in 2006. The published findings and ideas have since positively influenced  advocacy efforts on the strengthening of civil registration and vital statistics strengthening  in Africa and Asia in 2010 alone.
* HMN has helped foster a growing cluster of regional networks such as the Caribbean Group, an e-health network spearheaded by the Rockefeller Foundation, the m-health Alliance, and the West African Health Organization.
* The HMN Secretariat has provided assistance to several countries including Ethiopia, Belize, and Kenya, enabling them to secure financing from the Global Fund to strengthen health information systems.
** Information-driven improvements have been achieved in countries. For example, in rural Western District, Sierra Leone where the percentage of women giving birth rose in 2009 from around 13% to nearly 60% due to a policy of free health services,information from a revitalized health information system was used to identify the problem of high maternal mortality, to understand contributing factors, to design a relevant intervention with active participation of clients, civil society, and district officials to track the effect of implementing the intervention. 
** In Belize, the percentage of HIV+ pregnant women receiving full prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) went from just under 60% in 2006 to virtually 100% in the first half of 2008. Thanks to information system driven improvements, including a national electronic medical record system, HIV+ pregnant women are now readily identified and are closely followed with medical and psychosocial support. This has contributed to the virtual elimination of mother-to-child transmission of HIV in the country
* The HMN Secretariat introduced the formal practice of Enterprise Architecture to the domain of health information system's strategy, planning and design.

==Partners==
HMN worked with and through partners, including countries, donors, development agencies and technical experts. By linking with other networks and partnerships involved in health information, such as RHINO and [[PARIS21]], HMN extended its reach and both draws upon and contributes to such initiatives. By forging alliances with major consumers of health information, in particular global health initiatives such as The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization and the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, HMN worked to ensure that countries and programmes benefit from coherent and consistent technical support.&lt;ref name=hmn&gt;[http://www.who.int/healthmetrics/network/partners/en/index.html HMN website] . Accessed June 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}
HMN received an initial grant of US$50 million awarded by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation in 2004, and additional contributions from donors including: Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA), European Commission, Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Paris 21, Rockefeller Foundation, Systems Research Institute of Thailand, United Kingdom Department for International Development (DFID), United States Agency for International Development (USAID), United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Bank.

==Dissolution==
{{Clarify|date=December 2014|post-text=Why dissolved?}}
Subsequent to the preparation of the report by the Secretariat contained in EB132/5Add.1&lt;ref name="apps.who.int"/&gt; (“WHO’s arrangement for hosting health partnerships and proposals for harmonizing WHO’s work with hosted partnerships”), the Executive Board of the Health Metrics Network decided on 8 November 2012 to dissolve the Network.  The Network's operations ceased on 31 May 2013.

'''Health in Uganda''' refers to the health of the population of [[Uganda]]. As of 2013, [[life expectancy]] at birth in Uganda was 58 years, which was lower than in any other country in the [[East African Community]] except [[Burundi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=WHO - Uganda | url=http://www.who.int/countries/uga/en/ | publisher=World Health Organization | accessdate=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=The World Bank | publisher=[[The World Bank]] | date=2013 | accessdate=16 October 2016 | url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.LE00.IN | title=Life expectancy at birth, total (years) | location=Washington, D. C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015, the probability of a child dying before reaching age five was 5.5 percent (55 deaths for every 1000 live births).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.DYN.MORT | title=Mortality rate, under-5 (per 1000 live births) | accessdate=16 October 2016 | location=Washington, D.

In 2015, an estimated 1.5 million people in Uganda were infected with [[HIV]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.unaids.org/resources/documents/2016/prevention-gap | title=Prevention Gap Report | publisher=UNAIDS | date=2016 | access-date=12 January 2017 | page=229}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the HIV prevalence rate in the country was 7.2 percent.&lt;ref name="Prev"&gt;{{cite web | accessdate=16 October 2016 | location=Geneva | url=http://www.avert.org/professionals/hiv-around-world/sub-saharan-africa/uganda | title=Global information and advice on HIV &amp; AIDS: HIV and AIDS in Uganda (2015) | publisher=Avert.org | date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical activity==

Uganda was the most physically active nation in the world in 2018 according to the [[World Health Organization]]. Only 5.5% of Ugandans do not achieve 150 minutes of moderate-to-intense or 75 minutes of rigorous activity per week. Most work is still very physical, and commuting by vehicle is beyond the reach of most of the population.  Kampala, however, is not freindly towards walking or cycling, and the air is very polluted. The [[Kampala Capital City Authority]] established the country's first cycle lane - 500 metres in Kololo - in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Why Uganda is the 'world's fittest country' |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-45496654 |accessdate=15 September 2018 |publisher=BBC |date=15 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Common illnesses and treatments ==
[[File:Health in Uganda.jpg|thumb|300x300px|Patients in Uganda]]

As of 2016, the five leading causes of death in Uganda included [[communicable diseases]] such as [[HIV/AIDS]], [[tuberculosis]], [[malaria]], [[respiratory tract infections]], and [[diarrhea|diarrheal diseases]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2017 | url=http://www.healthdata.org/uganda |access-date=24 August 2018 |publisher=Healthdata.org |author=Healthdata.org |title=Top 10 causes of death in 2016 and percent change, 2005-2016, all ages}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[risk factor]]s most responsible for death and disability include child and maternal [[malnutrition]], unprotected [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]], [[multiple sex partners]],&lt;ref name=Atuyambe2014/&gt; contaminated water, poor sanitation, and [[air pollution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.monitor.co.ug/SpecialReports/Quality-Kampala-air-deathtrap/688342-4310794-11eynt/index.html |title=Quality of Kampala Air: A Deathtrap |newspaper=[[Daily Monitor]] |date=19 February 2018 |first=Walter |last=Mwesigye |access-date=24 August 2018 |location=Kampala}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[HIV treatment]] in Uganda has centered on human [[antiretroviral therapy]] through cross-training and increasing the scope of health workers who can administer treatment (e.g., [[community health workers]] and [[nurses]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.who.int/healthsystems/task_shifting/en/ | title=WHO: First Global Conference on Task Shifting | publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |access-date=5 May 2017 | author=World Health Organization |date=January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Callaghan | first=Mike | year=2010 | title=A systematic review of task-shifting for HIV treatment and care in Africa | journal=Human Resources for Health}}&lt;/ref&gt; This shift in treatment occurred through the WHO's 2004 "Integrated Management of Adult and Adolescent Illness" guide.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Studies of HIV-infected adults in Uganda showed [[risky sexual behavior]]&lt;ref name=Atuyambe2014&gt;{{cite web |title=HIV Risk Sexual Behaviors Among Teachers in Uganda | url=http://www.publichealthinafrica.org/index.php/jphia/article/view/350/186 |publisher=Journal of Public Health in Africa | first1=Lillian | last1=Ayebale | first2=Lynn | last2=Atuyambe | first3=William | last3=Bazeyo | first4=Erasmus Otolok | last4=Tanga | date=2014 | number=1 | volume=5 | access-date=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; to have declined, contributing to the decline in HIV incidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bunnell |first=Rebecca | year=2006 |title=Changes in sexual behavior and risk of HIV transmission after antiretroviral therapy and prevention interventions in rural Uganda |journal=AIDS |volume=20 | doi=10.1097/01.aids.0000196566.40702.28 | pages=85–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1990 to 2004, HIV rates declined by 70 percent and [[casual sex]] declined by 60 percent.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Stoneburner | first=Rand | year=2004 | title=Population-Level HIV Declines and Behavioral Risk Avoidance in Uganda | journal=Science | volume=304 | pages=714–718 | doi=10.1126/science.1093166 | pmid=15118157}}&lt;/ref&gt; Health communication was also listed as a potential cause of inducing [[Behavior change (public health)|behavioral change]]s in the Ugandan population.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; According to a 2015 study, impediments to reducing HIV incidence include food insecurity in rural areas and [[Social stigma|stigma]] against HIV counseling and testing.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Chan | first=Brian | year=2015 | title=Persistent HIV-related stigma in rural Uganda during a period of increasing HIV incidence despite treatment expansion | journal=AIDS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Uganda has the highest incidence rate of malaria in the world, with 478 people out of 1000 population being afflicted per year.&lt;ref name="Stat"&gt;{{cite web|access-date=16 July 2017 |  url=http://www.newvision.co.ug/new_vision/news/1423973/malaria-leading-cause-death-uganda |title=Malaria leading cause of death in Uganda | newspaper=[[New Vision]] |date=16 July 2017 | location=Kampala | first=Richard |last= Wetaya}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to WHO data published in May 2014, malaria accounted for 19,869 deaths in Uganda (6.19% of total deaths).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Malaria in Uganda|date=May 2014 |access-date=19 July 2017 | url=http://www.worldlifeexpectancy.com/uganda-malaria|author=WLEC Quoting [[WHO]] |publisher=Worldlifeexpectancy.com (WLEC)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the [[Ugandan government]] formalized the process of treating fevers through home-based care.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nsungwa-Sabiiti| first=Jesca|year=2007|title=Home-based management of fever and malaria treatment practices in Uganda.|url=|journal=Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene|volume=101|pages=1199–1207|doi=10.1016/j.trstmh.2007.08.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mothers who were able to better recognize symptoms of malaria took their children to a community medicine facility early in the illness.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The Integrated Management of Childhood Illness allowed for better recognition of malaria's [[symptom]]s.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Treatment either involved immediately taking the child to see a nearby healthcare worker or acquiring the treatment of [[chloroquine]] and SP, also known as [[Homapak]],&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; though kits have been found to be expired in some instances.&lt;ref&gt;https://ugandaradionetwork.com/story/expired-homapak-malaria-kits-in-kumi-hospitals&lt;/ref&gt; However, resistance to HOMAPAK emerged, and drug recommendations by the WHO changed to [[artemisinin]] combination therapy (ACT).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; After the midterm review in 2014 of the national plan for malaria reduction and the malaria programme review in 2010, the national strategy to reduce malaria is being redesigned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://health.go.ug/download/file/fid/526|title=The Uganda Malaria Reduction Strategic Plan 2014-2020|last=Ministry of Health|first=|date=May 2014|website=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, Uganda is treating malaria through distribution of [[insecticide]]-treated nets, indoor spraying of insecticides, and preventative therapy for [[pregnancy|pregnant]] women.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yeka|first=Adoke|year=2012|title=Malaria in Uganda: Challenges to control on the long road to elimination: I.

==Reproductive health==

Reproductive health (RH) is a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being in all matters relating to the reproductive system and to its functions and processes. It implies that people have the capability to reproduce and the freedom to decide if, when, and how often to do so. Implicit in this is the right of men and women to be informed and to have access to safe, effective, affordable, and acceptable methods of family planning of their choice, as well as other methods of their choice for regulation of fertility, which are not against the law, and the right of access to health care services that will enable women to go safely through pregnancy and childbirth. RH care also includes sexual health, the purpose of which is the enhancement of life and personal relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=WHO | publisher=[[World Health Organization]] (WHO) | location=Geneva | url=http://www.who.int/topics/reproductive_health/en | title=Reproductive Health | accessdate=17 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;


The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) defines maternal health as the health of women during pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=World Health Organization: Maternal Health | date=17 October 2016 | url=http://www.who.int/topics/maternal_health/en/ | publisher=[[World Health Organization]] (WHO)| author=WHO}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[UNICEF]], Uganda's maternal mortality ratio, the annual number of deaths of women from pregnancy-related causes per 100,000 live births,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Women: Definitions of the indicators | accessdate=17 October 2016 | url=http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/stats_popup8.html | date=17 October 2016 | publisher=[[United Nations Children's Fund]] (UNICEF) | author=UNICEF | location=Copenhagen}}&lt;/ref&gt; was 440 from 2008 to 2012.&lt;ref name="Data"&gt;{{cite web | title=Uganda Health Statistics | date=17 October 2016 | url=http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/uganda_statistics.html | last=UNICEF | publisher=[[United Nations Children's Fund]] (UNICEF) | location=Copenhagen | accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Millennium Development Goal (MDG) for 2015 concerning the maternal mortality ratio was 131 per 100,000 births. The MDG also set a goal for all births to be attended by a skilled health professional,&lt;ref name="MMRatio"&gt;{{cite web | accessdate=17 October 2016 | format=PDF | url=http://planipolis.iiep.unesco.org/upload/Uganda/Uganda%20MDG%20Report-Oct%202013.pdf | title=Millennium Development Goals Report for Uganda 2013 | publisher=[[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) | author=UNESCO | location=Paris, France | date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In rural areas, conceiving pregnant women seek the help of [[traditional birth attendant]]s (TBAs) because of the difficulty in accessing formal health services and high transportation or treatment costs. TBAs are trusted as they embody the cultural and social life of the community. The TBAs' lack of knowledge and training and the use of traditional practices, however, have led to risky medical procedures resulting in high maternal mortality rates. Those rates also persist because of an overall low use of contraceptives, the limited capacity of health facilities to manage abortion/miscarriage complications, and the prevalence of HIV/AIDS among pregnant women. Despite malaria being one of the leading causes of morbidity in pregnant women, prevention and prophylaxis services are not well established according to a 2013 published report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | accessdate=17 October 2016 | first=Anne | last=Mugisa |  url=http://www.newvision.co.ug/new_vision/news/1317103/maternal-mortality-rate-rises | title=Maternal mortality rate rises | date=10 April 2013 | newspaper=[[New Vision]] | location=Kampala}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only 47 percent of Ugandan women receive the recommended four antenatal care visits, and only 42 percent&lt;ref name="Data"/&gt; of births are attended by skilled health personnel. Among the poorest 20 percent of the population, the share of births attended by skill health personnel was 29 percent in 2005/2006 compared to 77 percent among the wealthiest 20 percent of the population.&lt;ref name="MMRatio"/&gt;

==Malnutrition==
Malnutrition is a major development concern in Uganda, affecting all regions of the country and most segments of the population. The current levels of malnutrition hinder Uganda’s human, social, and economic development. Although the country has made tremendous progress in economic growth and poverty reduction over the past 20 years, its progress in reducing malnutrition remains very slow. The ultimate objective of the Uganda Nutrition Action Plan
(UNAP) is to ensure that all Ugandans are properly nourished so they can live healthy and productive lives. However, it is at the start of life in particular that we must work together to ensure that all Ugandans are properly nourished.
According to the three most recent Uganda Demographic Health Surveys (UDHS), nutrition indicators for young children and their mothers have not improved much over the past 15 years, with some indicators showing a worsening trend. For example, in 1995, 45 percent of children under 5 years old in Uganda were short for their age (stunted); 10 years later, the prevalence of stunted under-5s had fallen to only 39 percent (UDHS, 2006). Stunting indicates
chronic malnutrition in children; the stunting prevalence rate of 39 percent means that about 2.3 million young children in Uganda today are chronically malnourished. [[UNICEF]]&lt;ref&gt;[[UNICEF]] [https://www.unicef.org/uganda/Nutrition_Plan_2011.pdf "Nutrition Action Plan 2011-2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

Consider the nutrition profile of Uganda for children under 5 years of age as per [[USAID]] &lt;ref&gt;USAID [https://www.usaid.gov/what-we-do/global-health/nutrition/countries/uganda-nutrition-profile "Nutrition profile April 2018"]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; [[USAID]] [https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1864/Uganda-Nutrition-Profile-Apr2018-508.pdf "Nutrition profile Uganda DHS 2011 and 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

This has a huge burden on the country through lost income that directly affects the GDP where as much as 5.6% or US$899 million is lost annually.

Despite the worrying numbers, latest research shows that the numbers of children under 5 suffering from malnutrition are declining. &lt;ref&gt;Gapminder tools, [https://www.gapminder.org/tools/#$state$time$value=2016;&amp;entities$show$geo$/$in@=uga;;;;&amp;marker$axis_y$which=malnutrition_weight_for_age_percent_of_children_under_5&amp;scaleType=linear&amp;spaceRef:null;;;&amp;chart-type=linechart "Malnutrition, weight for age 1988-2016"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender based violence==
[[Domestic violence]] (DV) is a key issue in reproductive health and rights. Most of the DV is gender-based.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | accessdate=17 October 2016 | url=http://www.who.int/topics/gender_based_violence/en/ | location=Geneva |

==Health in the Northern Region==

[[Northern Region, Uganda|Northern Uganda]] is one of the four major administrative regions in Uganda. The region was devastated by a protracted civil war between the government of Uganda and the [[Lords Resistance Army]] as well as the cattle rustling conflict that lasted for 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.un.org/events/tenstories/07/printable/uganda.shtml | title=Ten Stories the World Should Hear Moe About – Northern Uganda: Major Steps Towards Peace In A Decades-Old Conflict | accessdate=17 October 2016 | date= 2008 | author=United Nations | publisher=[[United Nations]] | location=New York City}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | accessdate=17 October 2016 | url=https://justiceinconflict.org/2012/04/09/a-genocide-in-northern-uganda-the-protected-camps-policy-of-1999-to-2006/ | date=9 April 2012 | title=A Genocide in Northern Uganda? – The 'Protected Camps' Policy of 1999 to 2006 | first=Patrick | last=Wegner | publisher=Justiceinconflict.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the war ended in 2006, the [[internally displaced person]] camps have been destroyed and people have resettled back to their former homesteads. The region, however, still has many health challenges, such as poor health care infrastructure and inadequate staffing at all levels (2008 published report);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.equip123.net/docs/E1-Education_Fragility_Uganda.pdf | format=PDF | title=Education and Fragility in Northern Uganda | accessdate=17 October 2016 | date=October 2008 | last=Meredith McCormac | first=and Judy A.

==Refugees==
Uganda has been hosting refugees and asylum seekers since achieving its independence in 1962.In fact, the 2016 United Nations Summit for Refugees declared Uganda’s refugee policy a model. The 2006 Refugee Act and 2010 Refugee Regulations allow for integration of refugees within host communities with refugees
having access to the same public services as nationals. They have freedom of movement and are free to pursue livelihood opportunities, including access
to the labour market and to establish businesses.
Uganda is currently hosting 1,252,470 refugees and asylum seekers making it the largest refugee hosting country in Africa and the third largest in the world (GoU and UNHCR, 2017) [[UNDP]] &lt;ref&gt; [[UNDP]] [http://www.ug.undp.org/content/dam/uganda/docs/UNDPUg17-Uganda%20Contribution%20to%20Refugee%20Hosting-Study%20Summary%20(2).pdf "Uganda's contribution to Refugee Protection and Management"]&lt;/ref&gt;. This has placed a huge burden on the country that has GDP of just 710 dollars, yet the aid received per person is very small.

There are regular outbreaks of diseases such as cholera, ebola and marburg. [[2017 Uganda Marburg virus outbreak]]. The policy of allowing refugees to freely move within the country increases the risk of spreading these outbreaks beyond refugee camp borders.
===Health indicators===

According to the 2015 Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS) report:&lt;ref name="Abs"&gt;{{cite web | title=Uganda Bureau of Statistics: 2015 Statistical Abstract | publisher=[[Uganda Bureau of Statistics]] (UBOS) | url=http://www.ubos.org/onlinefiles/uploads/ubos/statistical_abstracts/Statistical%20Abstract%202015.pdf | format=PDF | accessdate=17 October 2016 | date=October 2015 | author=UBOS | location=Kampala}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The region has one of the highest HIV prevalence rates of 8 percent in the country, second only to Kampala. 
* The region leads in poverty with 80 percent of households living below poverty line compared to only 20 percent of the country in general living in poverty. The region has the lowest per capita house hold expenditure of UGX:21,000 compared to UGX:30,000 of the general population. Up to 26 percent of people are chronically poor 
* The region leads in illiteracy with only 60 percent of the population aged 10 years and above being literate compared to 71 percent of the general country population. 
* Most districts in the region lack clean piped water supply with the exception of a few town centers like Gulu, Lira, Arua, and Soroti. The pit latrine coverage ranges from 4 to 84 percent in some districts, the worst in the country.
* The region has the lowest numbers of health facilities compared to other regions of the country. Of the total 5,229 health facilities in Uganda (2,867 operated by the government, 874 operated by non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and 1,488 private facilities), there are only 788 health facilities in the Northern Region (664 operated by government, 122 operated by NGOs, and 2 private facilities). Health facility deliveries range from 7 percent in [[Amudat]], to 81 percent in [[Gulu]].&lt;ref name="Abs"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3171">Within the [[English National Health Service]] (NHS), a '''Healthcare Resource Group''' (HRG) is a grouping consisting of patient events that have been judged to consume a similar level of resource. For example, there are a number of different knee-related procedures that all require similar levels of resource; they may all be assigned to one HRG.

The current revision of Healthcare Resource Groups in use is the fourth, and is known as HRG4. HRG4 is updated annually to enhance the system, reflect changes in clinical practice and to include changes to policy.

HRG4 is maintained by the [http://www.ic.nhs.uk/casemix National Casemix Office], part of the [http://www.ic.nhs.uk Health and Social Care Information Centre].

The HRG system is used by [[Payment by Results]], an activity based payment system rolled out in the NHS in England (but not Wales) from 2004 and used to determine the income hospitals in England get for given hospital stays and procedures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hscic.gov.uk/article/2580/HRG4-201314-Local-Payment-Grouper The 2013/14 Local Payment Grouper] - The NHS HSCIC website&lt;/ref&gt;

HRGs can be derived for the following areas:

:* Admitted Patient Care
:* Non-Admitted Consultations
:* Emergency Medicine
:* Adult Critical Care
:* Paediatric Critical Care
:* Neonatal Critical Care
:* Renal

Patient data are assigned HRG codes using a software application known as a Grouper.

An HRG code consists of five characters: two letters followed by two numbers and a final letter. The first letter refers the Chapter, the second being the Sub-Chapter; these correspond to body areas or body systems identifying the area of clinical care that the HRG falls within. The final letter is known as the 'split' and is used, for example, to indicate the level of complications and comorbidities associated with the HRG (e.g. Minor, Intermediate and Major), for different lengths of stay, ages or a combination of factors.

== Admitted Patient Care ==
In Admitted Patient Care, an HRG is derived for each Consultant Episode (a period of care under one consultant) and Provider Hospital Spell (a period of care from admission to discharge) using clinical coding ([[ICD-10]] and [[OPCS-4]]) and administrative codes about patient events.

== Non-Admitted Consultations ==
Non-admitted consultations includes outpatients and ward attenders. An HRG is derived for each attendance record using clinical coding and the 'First Attendance' data item.

== Emergency Medicine ==
Emergency Medicine (A&amp;E) data are grouped based on investigation and treatment codes.

== Adult Critical Care ==
Adult Critical Care HRGs are allocated per Critical Care Period using a count of organ systems supported.

== Paediatric Critical Care ==
Paediatric Critical Care HRGs are allocated on a per-day basis largely using Critical Care Activity Codes.

== Neonatal Critical Care ==
Neonatal Critical Care HRGs are allocated on a per-day basis largely using Critical Care Activity Codes.

== Renal ==
Renal HRGs are allocated based on the National Renal Dataset

'''Jesse Michael Bering''' (born 6 May 1975) is a writer and academic. He is Associate Professor in Science Communication at the [[University of Otago]], as well as a frequent contributor to ''[[Scientific American]]'', ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', and ''[[Das Magazin]]'' (Switzerland). His work has also appeared in ''[[New York (magazine)|New York Magazine]]'', ''[[The Guardian]]'', and ''[[The New Republic]]'', and has been featured on ''[[NPR]]'', the ''[[BBC]]'', ''[[Playboy Radio]]'' and elsewhere.

==Life and career==
Bering is the former director of the Institute of Cognition and Culture at [[Queen's University Belfast]] and began his career as a psychology professor at the [[University of Arkansas]]. After a period as a full-time writer and professor at [[Wells College]], he took up a science communication post at the [[University of Otago]] in 2014.

Bering is notable for his frank and humorous handling of controversial issues in psychological science, especially those dealing with [[human sexuality]]. His ''Scientific American'' blog, ''Bering in Mind,''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/bering-in-mind/|title=Bering in Mind - A research psychologist's curious look at human behavior| publisher=Scientific American|accessdate=December 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; was named a 2010 [[Webby Award]] Honoree for the Blog-Cultural category by members of The [[International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences]]. He also received the 2010 "Scientist of the Year Award" from the [[National Organization of Gay and Lesbian Scientists and Technical Professionals]] (NOGLSTP), an affiliate of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]].

He is also a Project Partner in the [[Oxford University]]-based 'Explaining Religion' project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icea.ox.ac.uk/large-grants/explaining-religion/ |title=Explaining Religion Project |publisher=Oxford University, Institute of Cognitive and Evolutionary Anthropology |accessdate=December 13, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130112013032/http://www.icea.ox.ac.uk/large-grants/explaining-religion/ |archivedate=January 12, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a three-year, €2 million project funded by the [[European Commission]].

He attended graduate school at the [[University of Louisiana at Lafayette]] where he earned his MA degree (1999) studying [[Chimpanzee#Social structure|chimpanzee social cognition]] under the guidance of [[comparative psychologist]] Daniel J. Povinelli. He then transferred to [[Florida Atlantic University]], where he obtained a PhD in [[developmental psychology]] (2002). His doctoral advisor was the [[evolutionary developmental psychologist]] [[David F. Bjorklund]]. Bering's formal academic research is in the area of the [[cognitive science of religion]]. In his book ''Perv: The Sexual Deviant in All of Us'' he has expressed support for [[Virtuous Pedophiles]], an anti-[[child sexual abuse]] group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Rachel Kramer|last=Bussel|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/10/18/can-pedophiles-help-themselves-a-book-s-provocative-take-on-sexuality.html |title=Can Pedophiles Help Themselves?

'''José Tamborini''' (February 22, 1886 - September 25, 1955) was an Argentine physician and historically significant politician.
==Life and times==
José Pascual Tamborini was born in [[Buenos Aires]], in 1886. He enrolled at the public college preparatory school, the [[Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires|National College of Buenos Aires]] and by 1900, became affiliated with the [[Radical Civic Union]] (UCR) - then the nation's leading [[advocacy group]] for universal male suffrage. He then headed the school's UCR chapter and published its newsletter.&lt;ref name=scarecrow&gt;''Historical Dictionary of Argentina''. London: Scarecrow Press, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tamborini received a medical degree from the [[University of Buenos Aires]] and by 1912, headed that city's UCR committee. That year, free and fair elections guaranteed by the landmark [[Sáenz Peña Law]] led to the victory of numerous UCR candidates for the [[Argentine Congress]], including Tamborini. Following the election to the presidency of longtime UCR leader [[Hipólito Yrigoyen]] in 1916, however, Tamborini aligned himself against what a faction in the UCR viewed as the president's growing [[personality cult]]. This opposition was fueled by Yrigoyen's numerous removals of provincial governors, for instance, and soon became known as "anti-personalism."&lt;ref name=scarecrow/&gt;

The election of a diplomat with anti-personalist sympathies, [[Marcelo Torcuato de Alvear]], as president in 1922 led to a division in the UCR. Congressman Tamborini joined Senate President [[Leopoldo Melo]] and others in the formation of the Antipersonalist UCR in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.todo-argentina.net/historia/radicales/alvear/index.html Todo Argentina: Alvear {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt; President Alvear named Tamborini Interior Minister (overseeing law enforcement), in 1925. The aging Yrigoyen returned to power in 1928, deeping inter-party divisions; but his 1930 overthrow helped unify the UCR, and Tamborini joined the City Hotel Declaration of April 1931 to that effect.&lt;ref name=scarecrow/&gt;

Seeking to thwart a UCR victory ahead of the [[Argentine presidential election, 1931|1931 elections]], the dictator, General [[José Félix Uriburu]] jailed much of its leadership - including Alvear and Tamborini. Freed after the election (which the UCR boycotted), Tamborini was returned to Congress in 1934 and stood for the UCR nomination in [[Argentine presidential election, 1937|1937]]; but he was defeated by Alvear. Elected Senator in 1940, he became the dominant figure in the UCR following Alvear's death in 1942.&lt;ref name=scarecrow/&gt;

A [[coup d'état]] in 1943 led to rise of the populist new Labor Minister, Col. [[Juan Perón]]. Forcing the junta to call [[Argentine general election, 1946|elections for early 1946]], Perón's populism and anti-U.S. sentiment rallied an unusually diverse opposition against him. Tamborini led the majority of the UCR, the reformist [[Democratic Progressive Party (Argentina)|Democratic Progressive Party]], [[Socialist Party of Argentina|Socialists]], [[Communist Party of Argentina|Communists]] and the conservative National Democrats (part of the Concordance that kept the UCR from power by "[[Infamous Decade|patriotic fraud]]" in the 1930s) into a [[w:es:Unión Democrática|Democratic Union]]. Joined by interests in the financial sector and the chamber of commerce, the alliance also enjoyed the support of U.S. Ambassador [[Spruille Braden]], and was united solely by the goal of keeping Perón from the [[Casa Rosada]].&lt;ref name=enigmas&gt;Crassweller, David. ''Perón and the Enigmas of Argentina''. W.W. Norton and Company. 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; Organizing a massive kick-off rally in front of Congress on December 8, the Democratic Union nominated Tamborini and his fellow political prisoner in 1931: former Congressman [[Enrique Mosca]]. The alliance, however, failed to win over several prominent lawmakers opposed the Union's ties to conservative interests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.todo-argentina.net/historia/peronista/farrell/1945.html Todo Argentina: 1945 {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt; Ambassador Braden's leak of a [[white paper]] accusing Perón of [[fascist]] ties and his addressing Democratic Union rallies in person backfired, moreover. Perón seized on this to make the election a choice between "Perón or Braden," while prevailing on President [[Edelmiro Farrell]] to enact his populist agenda and dismissing Tamborini and Mosca as "the tambourine and the fly."&lt;ref name=enigmas/&gt; The Democratic Union was defeated by 11%. 

Tamborini was unable to return to prominence following his break with less conservative UCR figures during that election. He ran once again for his party's nomination in [[Argentine general election, 1951|1951]]; but he lost to Congressman [[Ricardo Balbín]]. President Perón was overwhelmingly reelected, though on September 19, 1955, he was violently overthrown. The ailing Dr. Tamborini died a week later, at age 69.&lt;ref name=scarecrow/&gt;

[[Image:A Smiling boy from Bangladesh.jpg|thumb|[[Laughter]], like that of these [[Bangladesh|Bangladeshi]] children, is a typical expression of joy.]]
The word '''joy''' means a feeling of great pleasure and happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/joy|title=Joy - Definition of joy in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English|accessdate=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[C. S. Lewis]] saw clear distinction between joy, [[pleasure]], and [[happiness]]: "I sometimes wonder whether all pleasures are not substitutes for Joy."&lt;ref&gt;Surprised by Joy: The Shape of My Early Life. (p. 169) Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;, and "I call it Joy, which is here a technical term and must be sharply distinguished both from Happiness and Pleasure. Joy (in my sense) has indeed one characteristic, and one only, in common with them; the fact that anyone who has experienced it will want it again...

==History==
===Pre-Rakusen-en days===
*1869:There was a big fire in the Kusatsu Hot Spring. Later, a publicity book "Kusatsu Onsen Shi(Kusatsu Hot Spring is good for health) circulated and by and by leprosy patients gathered around Kusatsu.
*1888:[[Erwin Bälz]] wrote that after studying Kusatsu Hot Spring, Japanese hot springs should be used for health purposes.
*1907:Bertrand met opposition to his plan of building a hospital in Kusatsu.
*1913:[[Hannah Riddell]] sent Missionary Yonehara to Kusatsu.
*1914:Koenkai(Light and salt society), a Christian group was formed in Kusatsu.

===Mary Cornwall-Legh===
*{{main|Mary Cornwall-Legh}}
*1915: [[Mary Cornwall-Legh]] inspected Kusatsu.
*1916: [[Mary Cornwall-Legh]] started the Barnabas' mission.
*1917: St. Barnabas' Hospital started with Dr. Kesa Hattori and Nurse Chiyo Mikami.
*1924:Suzuran Hospital was started by Kesa Hattori and Chiyo Mikami but soon closed by the death of Hattori.
*1929:St.Barnaba Hospital was renewed (Dr. Ichiro Tsuruta).
*1930:The population of Yunosawa Community was 817, one third of Kusatsu.

===Kusatsu Rakusen-en Sanatorium===
*1932: Kusatsu Rakusen-en Sanatorium started (Director: Yoshiichi Furumi)
*1938:Special prison "Juukanbou" [[Kusatsu Special Prison]],was built within the sanatorium.
{{See also|Kusatsu Special Prison}}
*1941:St.Barnaba Hospital was closed. 44 patients were transferred to Kusatsu Rakusen-en.
*1947: The cruel condition of the special prison was spotlighted. The director was suspended from office.
*Apr 1996:The 1953 Leprosy Prevention Law was abolished.
*Jul 1998: The trial for compensation started.
*May 11, 2001: The trial for compensation ruled that the previous Leprosy Prevention was unconstitutional.
*May 25, 2001: The trial for compensation was confirmed. The compensation of 8,000,000 yen to 14,000,000 yen was given to patients depending on the duration of unconstitutional periods.

===Number of In-patients===
The number of in-patients is the sum of patients which changed not only by the newly diagnosed hospitalized and those who died among in-patients, by other factors such as the number of patients who escaped or were discharged, depending on the condition of the times. Recently they were encouraged to be discharged, but the long period of the segregation policy causing leprosy stigma might influence the number of those who went into the society.

A '''litter''' is the live birth of multiple [[offspring]] at one time in [[animal]]s from the same mother and usually from one set of [[parent]]s, particularly from three to eight offspring. The word is most often used for the offspring of [[mammal]]s, but can be used for any animal that gives birth to multiple young.  In comparison, a group of [[egg (biology)|eggs]] and the offspring that hatch from them are frequently called a [[clutch (animal)|clutch]], while young birds are often called a [[offspring|brood]]. Animals from the same litter are referred to as litter-mates.

Animals frequently display grouping behavior in [[herd]]s, [[swarm]]s, [[Flock (birds)|flocks]], or [[Colony (biology)|colonies]], and these multiple births derive similar advantages.  A litter offers some protection from [[predation]], not particularly to the individual young but to the parents' investment in breeding.  With multiple young, predators could eat several and others could still survive to reach maturity, but with only one offspring, its loss could mean a wasted breeding season.  The other significant advantage is the chance for the healthiest young animals to be favored from a group.  Rather than it being a conscious decision on the part of the parents, the fittest and strongest baby competes most successfully for food and space, leaving the weakest young, or [[runt]]s, to die through lack of care.

In the wild, only a small percentage, if any, of the litter may survive to maturity, whereas for domesticated animals and those in captivity with human care the whole litter almost always survives. [[Kittens]] and [[puppies]] are in this group. [[Carnivore]]s, [[rodent]]s, and [[pig]]s usually have litters, while primates and larger herbivores usually have singletons.

'''(John) Martin Faulkner''' (born June 6, 1964 in London) is an English artist and [[therapist]] who as an [[illustrator]] and [[designer]] has specialized in [[Art Deco]], and was a pioneer of the British [[vintage]] movement in the 1980s.

A winner in the [[National Portraiture Foundation]] [[Sir Charles Wheeler Award]] in 1979, he went on to study at the [[Herts College of Art and Design]] at [[St. Albans]]. He started his career painting murals and making novelty 'character' signs.
''Faulkner'' worked his way up from paste-up artist at a small [[Hertfordshire]] advertising agency, to designer/visualiser with a design consultancy in [[Covent Garden]], London's creative centre of the time, and became a freelance [[illustrator]] published in magazines such as [[Punch (magazine)|Punch]], [[Radio Times]], [[Country Life (magazine)|Country Life]], and [[Best of British (magazine)|Best of British]]. His clients included advertising agencies such as [[Saatchi &amp; Saatchi]], and [[fashion]] labels such as [[Pepe Jeans|Pepe]]. The quality of his work was recognised by his [[corporate design]] for [[Sam Walker Vintage Clothing]] being included in the showcase publication [[The Best of British Retail Design]] in the mid-Nineties.

His passion for the era of the 1920s to 1940s and the expertise he acquired has led him to specialise in re-creating the style of that period: his subject matter ranges from portraits and scenes to mechanical subjects, particularly steam trains and [[vintage]] cars. It also inspired his work as a designer of [[vintage]] [[fashion]]s and sets.

Adopting the [[Art Deco]] lifestyle lead him to [[swing music]] and [[ballroom dancing]], and one decade of his career was spent pursuing professionally what started as a keen leisure interest: first as one half of the [[Fred Astaire]]-[[Ginger Rogers]]-inspired 1930s dance cabaret act [[Ruby Fox &amp; Johnny Martin]] for five years, entertaining at high society venues, among them [[The Cliveden Club]] and [[The Waldorf]], backed by top nostalgic/swing bands including [[The Pasadena Roof Orchestra]], and then as principal male dancer and design director of the historical dance and [[drama]] company [[Baroque 'n' Roll]] for eight years.
This opened the way to various period TV dramas such as [[Agatha Christie]]'s [[Poirot]], produced by [[LWT]] for [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]], and [[The House of Eliott]] for the [[BBC]]; it also led him into the heritage and education sectors, where he taught dance and social history to pupils from primary age to adult groups, working for various well-known heritage sites including [[Museum of London]], [[National Portrait Gallery (London)|National Portrait Gallery]], [[Imperial War Museum]] and [[National Maritime Museum]].

After a year spent in [[Canada]] exploring his interest in [[psychology]], and building on his experiences in the educational sector, ''Faulkner'' trained as a therapist.
Having adapted the name ''John'' from his stage name he now lives in [[Downham Market]], [[Norfolk]], working as both an artist-designer and [[Neuro-linguistic programming|NLP]]-practitioner/[[hypnotherapist]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3341">'''Mouth infections''', also known as '''oral infections''', are a group of infections that occur around the [[oral cavity]]. They include [[dental infection]], [[dental abscess]], and [[Ludwig's angina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rajendran|first1=Arya|last2=Sivapathasundharam|first2=B.|title=Shafer's Textbook of Oral Pathology|date=2014|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=9788131238004|page=503|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=WnhtAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA503|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mouth infections typically originate from dental caries at the root of [[Molar (tooth)|molars]] and [[Premolar|premolars]] that spread to adjacent structures. In immunocompetent patients with minimal spread of disease, removing the offending tooth to allow drainage will usually resolve the infection. In cases that spread to adjacent structures or in immunocompromised patients (cancer, diabetes, transplant immunosuppression), surgical drainage and systemic antibiotics may be required in addition to tooth extraction. Since bacteria that normally reside in the oral cavity cause mouth infections, proper dental hygiene can prevent most cases of infection. As such, mouth infections are more common in populations with poor access to dental care (homeless, uninsured, etc.) or populations with health-related behaviors that damage one's teeth and oral mucosa (tobacco, methamphetamine, etc).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cummings Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery, 5th Edition|last=Flint|first=Paul|publisher=Elsevier|year=2010|isbn=978-0808924340|location=|pages=177 - 190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patients with mouth infections usually complain of pain at the affected tooth with or without fevers. Inability to fully open one's mouth, also known as [[trismus]], suggests that the infection has spread to spaces between the jaw and muscles of mastication ([[Masseter muscle|masseter]], [[Medial pterygoid muscle|medial pterygoid]], and [[Temporal muscle|temporalis]]). If an [[abscess]] has formed, swelling, redness, and tenderness will be present. Depending on the location of the abscess, it will be visible intraorally, extraorally, or both. Severe infections with significant swelling may cause airway obstruction by shifting/enlarging soft tissue structures (floor of mouth, tongue, etc.) or by causing [[dysphagia]] that prevents adequate clearance of saliva. This is a medical emergency and may require endonasal intubation or tracheotomy to protect one's airway. The development of [[stridor]], shortness of breath, and pooling oral secretions may indicate impending airway compromise due to a worsening mouth infection.

The '''National Health Insurance Scheme''' is a form of [[National health insurance]] established by the Government of Ghana, with a goal to provide equitable access and financial coverage for basic health care services to Ghanaian [[Citizenship|citizens]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhis.gov.gh/ NHIS - National Health Insurance Scheme]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Birth of Ghana's National Health Insurance Scheme==
&lt;!-- Could add more history here as to health financing in Ghana previous to NHIS --&gt;
The idea for the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) in Ghana was conceived by former president [[John Kufuor]] who when seeking the mandate of the people in the 2000 elections, promised to abolish the ''cash and carry system'' of health delivery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/national_health_insurance_scheme.php Health Insurance in Ghana]&lt;/ref&gt; Under the ''cash and carry system'', the health need of an individual was only attended to after initial payment for the service was made.&lt;ref name="bare_url"&gt;[http://img.modernghana.com/images/content/report_content/NHIS.pdf National Health Insurance Scheme]&lt;/ref&gt; Even in cases when patients had been brought into the hospital on emergencies it was required that money was paid at every point of service delivery.

Upon becoming president, former president Kufuor pushed through his idea of getting rid of “cash and carry” and replacing it with an equitable insurance scheme that ensured that treatment was provided first before payment for Ghanaian [[Citizenship|citizens]]. In 2003, the scheme was passed into law. Under the law, there was the establishment of Ghana National Health Insurance Authority which licenses, monitors and regulates the operation of health insurance schemes in Ghana. Like many countries in the world, Ghana's health insurance was fashioned out to meet specific needs of Ghanaian [[Citizenship|citizens]].

The National Health Insurance Scheme is a form of National health insurance established by the Government of Ghana. The scheme provides equitable access and financial coverage for basic health care services to the Ghanaian population. The objective of the NHIC is to secure the implementation of the national health insurance policy that ensures access to basic healthcare services to all residents of Ghana.&lt;ref&gt;[http://healthmarketinnovations.org/program/ghana-national-health-insurance-scheme]&lt;/ref&gt;

==NHIS Policy==
The health insurance was set up to allow Ghanaian citizens to make contributions into a fund so that in the event of illness Ghanaian contributors could be supported by the fund to receive affordable health care. Under this policy, three types of health insurance schemes were set up. They were:
* The District-Wide Mutual Health Insurance Scheme.
* The Private Mutual Health Insurance Scheme.
* The Private Commercial Health Insurance Scheme.&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt;

In order for the system to function well, the government decided to support the District Mutual Health Insurance Scheme concept to ensure that:
* Opportunity is provided for all Ghanaian [[Citizenship|citizens]] to have equal access to the functional structures of health insurance.
* Ghanaian [[Citizenship|citizens]] do not move from an unaffordable ‘Cash and carry’ regime to another unaffordable Health Insurance one.
* A sustainable Health Insurance option is made available to all Ghanaian [[Citizenship|citizens]].
* The quality of health care provision is not compromised under Health Insurance.

==Premiums==
Like all insurance schemes, different types of premiums are available under the country's NHIS. Ghanaian contributors are grouped according to their levels of income. Based on the group a Ghanaian contributor may fall in, there is specific premium that ought to be paid. This was done since the socio-economic condition scheme contributors is not the same and the Ghanaian contributions was to be affordable for all to ensure that nobody is forced to remain in ''cash and carry'' system. This meant that Ghanaian contributions payable could vary from one district to the other as even the disease burden was also not the same in all the districts. To ensure that all Ghanaian [[Citizenship|citizens]] made some contribution to the scheme, a 2.5% Health Insurance Levy on selected goods and services was passed into law so that the money collected could be put into a National Health Insurance Fund to subsidize fully paid contributions to the District Health Insurance Schemes.

==Nature of the Scheme==
In order to ensure the continuity of the scheme, two major lists were made. One had the all the conditions that the scheme could cover with the other the excluded conditions.

===Diseases covered under the scheme===
The Government came out with a minimum benefit package of diseases which every district-wide scheme was to cover for Ghanaian [[Citizenship|citizens]]. This package covered about 95% of diseases in Ghana. Diseases covered included among others:
* [[Malaria]]
* [[Diarrhoea]]
* [[Upper respiratory tract infection]]
* [[Skin Diseases]]
* [[Hypertension]]
* [[Diabetes]]
* [[Asthma]]
However, all district-wide schemes were given the right under the law to organise their schemes to cover as many diseases and services for Ghanaian [[Citizenship|citizens]] as they desire, provided it was approved by the National Health Insurance Council.

===Exclusive list===
Certain diseases were however excluded from the benefit package because it was considered to be too expensive to treat. Therefore, other arrangements had to be considered to enable Ghanaian [[Citizenship|citizens]] get these diseases treated. Diseases currently not covered are:
* Optical aids
* [[Hearing aid]]s
* Orthopaedic aids
* [[Dentures]]
* [[Cosmetic surgery|Beautification Surgery]]
* Supply of [[Antiretroviral drug|AIDS drugs]]
* treatment of [[Chronic kidney disease|Chronic renal failure]]
* [[Heart surgery|Heart]] and [[Brain surgery]], etc.
All these constitute only 5% of the total number of diseases that Ghanaian [[Citizenship|citizens]] suffered from.&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt;

==Scheme coverage==
The government supports all 212 Districts, Municipal and Sub-metro schemes in Ghana for Ghanaian [[Citizenship|citizens]] to the various districts to facilitate the set-up of the schemes.

==Controversies==
Since the inception of the scheme in 2003, there have been a lot of controversies surrounding its operation and purpose. The first one was to do with members of the opposition [[National Democratic Congress (Ghana)|National Democratic Congress]] (NDC), whose members claimed that the scheme was one made for members of the then ruling [[New Patriotic Party]] (NPP). As such many members of NDC did not want to register with the scheme. The reverse of all the propaganda that surrounded the scheme at its inception were revisited in 2009 when the NDC took over power.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.modernghana.com/news/219867/1/nhis-seized-by-ndc.html&lt;/ref&gt;
Currently, the controversy with the scheme has to do with the proposed one-time premium payment. This idea was included in the ruling party's manifesto. The promise has so far not come into fruition as the date for its implementation is constantly postponed.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.myjoyonline.com/health/201007/49927.asp&lt;/ref&gt; Many critics of the proposal claim that it is just not possible to support the scheme with a one-time premium since the sustainability of the scheme would not be possible if premiums were not paid yearly.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/artikel.php?ID=199496&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2471">The '''Nursing Interventions Classification''' ('''NIC''') is a care [[wiktionary:classification|classification]] system which describes the activities that [[nurse]]s perform as a part of the planning phase of the [[nursing process]] associated with the creation of a nursing care plan.

The NIC provides a four level hierarchy whose first two levels consists of a list of 433 different interventions, each with a definition in general terms, and then the ground-level list of a variable number of specific activities a nurse could perform to complete the intervention. The second two levels form a [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] in which each intervention is grouped into 27 classes, and each class is grouped into six domains.

An intent of this structure is to make it easier for a nurse to select an intervention for the situation, and to use a [[computer]] to describe the intervention in terms of standardized labels for classes and domains. Another intent is in each case to make it easy to use a [[Nursing Minimum Data Set]] (NMDS).

The terminology is an [[American Nurses' Association]]–recognized terminology, which is included in the [[UMLS]], and is [[HL7]] registered.&lt;ref&gt;Iowa Intervention Project (1996). Nursing Interventions Classification (NIC) (2nd ed.), St. Louis: Mosby-Year Book&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henry SB, Warren JJ, Lange L, Button P., "A review of major nursing vocabularies and the extent to which they have the characteristics required for implementation in computer-based systems", ''J Am Med Inform Assoc.'' 1998 Jul–Aug;5(4):321–8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henry SB, Mead CN., "Nursing classification systems: necessary but not sufficient for representing 'what nurses do' for inclusion in computer-based patient record systems", ''J Am Med Inform Assoc.'' 1997 May–Jun;4(3):222–32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncvhs.hhs.gov/970416w4.htm Nursing Interventions Classification] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416012932/http://www.ncvhs.hhs.gov/970416w4.htm |date=2008-04-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{other uses|Placebo (disambiguation)}}
[[File:Cebocap.jpg|thumb|Placebos are typically inert tablets, such as sugar pills]]
A '''placebo''' ({{IPAc-en|p|l|ə|ˈ|s|iː|b|oʊ}} {{respell|plə|SEE|boh}}) is a substance or treatment of no intended therapeutic value.&lt;ref name=aspmn/&gt; Common placebos include inert tablets (like sugar pills), inert injections (like [[Saline (medicine)|saline]]), [[sham surgery]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304680904579365414108916816 | title=The FDA Wants You for Sham Surgery | work=Wall Street Journal | date=18 February 2014 | access-date=8 January 2015 | last = Gottlieb | first = Scott | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; and other procedures.&lt;ref name="Lanotte"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lanotte M, Lopiano L, Torre E, Bergamasco B, Colloca L, Benedetti F | title = Expectation enhances autonomic responses to stimulation of the human subthalamic limbic region | journal = Brain, Behavior, and Immunity | volume = 19 | issue = 6 | pages = 500–9 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16055306 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbi.2005.06.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In drug testing and medical research, a placebo can be made to resemble an active medication or therapy so that it functions as a [[scientific control|control]]; this is to [[blinded experiment|prevent the recipient(s) or others from knowing]] (with their [[consent]]) whether a treatment is active or inactive, as expectations about [[efficacy]] can influence results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dictionary.com/browse/placebo | title = placebo |date=9 April 2016|access-date=21 January 2017 | work = Dictionary.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.thefreedictionary.com/placebo | title=placebo|access-date=21 January 2017 | work = TheFreeDictionary.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[clinical trial]] any change in the placebo arm is known as the '''placebo response''', and the difference between this and the result of no treatment is the '''placebo effect'''.&lt;ref name=chaplin/&gt;

A placebo may be given to a person in a clinical context in order to deceive the recipient into thinking that it is an active treatment. The use of placebos as treatment in clinical medicine is ethically problematic as it introduces deception and dishonesty into the doctor–patient relationship.&lt;ref name="Newman"&gt;{{cite book | first = David H. | last = Newman | name-list-format = vanc |title=Hippocrates' Shadow |publisher=Scribner |year=2008| pages=134–59 |isbn=978-1-4165-5153-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Placebos have no impact on [[disease]] itself; they can only affect the person's perception of their own condition.&lt;ref name=acs/&gt;

Historically, an influential 1955 study entitled ''The Powerful Placebo'' established the idea that placebo effects were clinically important,&lt;ref name="Hrob2001"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hróbjartsson A, Gøtzsche PC | title = Is the placebo powerless? An analysis of clinical trials comparing placebo with no treatment | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 344 | issue = 21 | pages = 1594–602 | date = May 2001 | pmid = 11372012 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM200105243442106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and were a result of [[Neural top–down control of physiology|the brain's role in physical health]], but a 1997 review of the study found "no evidence [...] of any placebo effect in any of the studies cited".&lt;ref name="Kienle &amp; Kiene" /&gt; Subsequent research has found that placebos are not a useful means of therapy.&lt;ref name=CochraneHrob2010/&gt;

== Definitions ==
The word "placebo", Latin for "I will please", dates back to a Latin translation of the Bible by [[St Jerome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jacobs B | title = Biblical origins of placebo | journal = Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine | volume = 93 | issue = 4 | pages = 213–4 | date = April 2000 | pmid = 10844895 | pmc = 1297986 | doi = 10.1177/014107680009300419 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American Society of Pain Management Nursing define a placebo as "any sham medication or procedure designed to be void of any known therapeutic value".&lt;ref name=aspmn/&gt;

In a [[clinical trial]], a ''placebo response'' is the measured response of subjects to a placebo; the ''placebo effect'' is the difference between that response, and no treatment.&lt;ref name=chaplin&gt;{{cite journal |year=2006 | vauthors=Chaplin S |journal=Prescriber |title=The placebo response: an important part of treatment |doi=10.1002/psb.344 |pages=16–22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also part of the recorded response to any active medical intervention.&lt;ref name=eccles&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Eccles R | title = The powerful placebo in cough studies? | journal = Pulmonary Pharmacology &amp; Therapeutics | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 303–8 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12099783 | doi = 10.1006/pupt.2002.0364 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Any measurable placebo effect is termed either ''objective'' (e.g. lowered [[blood pressure]]) or ''subjective'' (e.g. a lowered perception of pain).&lt;ref name=aspmn&gt;{{cite journal| author=Arnstein P, Broglio K, Wuhrman E, Kean MB| title=Use of placebos in pain management. | journal=Pain Manag Nurs | year= 2011 | volume= 12 | issue= 4 | pages= 225–9 | pmid=22117754 | doi=10.1016/j.pmn.2010.10.033 | pmc= | url=http://www.aspmn.org/documents/UseofPlacebosinPainManagement.pdf |type=Position Statement of the American Society for Pain Management Nursing |format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==

Placebos have no meaningful therapeutic worth.&lt;ref name=CochraneHrob2010&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hróbjartsson A, Gøtzsche PC | title = Placebo interventions for all clinical conditions | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 106 | issue = 1 | pages = CD003974 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 20091554 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD003974.pub3 | editor1-last = Hróbjartsson | editor1-first = Asbjørn | name-list-format = vanc | url = http://nordic.cochrane.org/sites/nordic.cochrane.org/files/public/uploads/ResearchHighlights/Placebo%20interventions%20for%20all%20clinical%20conditions%20(Cochrane%20review).pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have no effect on [[disease]], and can only affect some people's subjective judgement of their symptoms.&lt;ref name=acs/&gt; Sometimes they can make people feel better, and sometimes worse&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; in which case they are termed a [[nocebo]].&lt;ref name=acs/&gt;

Because the placebo response is simply the patient response that cannot be attributed to an investigational intervention, there are multiple possible components of a measured placebo effect. These components have varying relevance depending on study design and the types of observations.&lt;ref name="Kienle &amp; Kiene"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kienle GS, Kiene H | title = The powerful placebo effect: fact or fiction? | journal = Journal of Clinical Epidemiology | volume = 50 | issue = 12 | pages = 1311–8 | date = December 1997 | pmid = 9449934 | doi = 10.1016/s0895-4356(97)00203-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While there is some evidence that placebo interventions can alter levels of  [[endocannabinoids]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Colloca|first1=Luana | name-list-format = vanc |title=Placebo and Pain: From Bench to Bedside|date=Aug 28, 2013|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-397931-5|pages=11–12|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[endogenous opioid]]s,&lt;ref name=Neurobiology2005&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Benedetti F, Mayberg HS, Wager TD, Stohler CS, Zubieta JK | title = Neurobiological mechanisms of the placebo effect | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 25 | issue = 45 | pages = 10390–402 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16280578 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3458-05.2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; other prominent components include [[Subject-expectancy effect|expectancy effect]]s, [[regression to the mean]],&lt;ref name="How much?"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McDonald CJ, Mazzuca SA, McCabe GP | title = How much of the placebo 'effect' is really statistical regression? | journal = Statistics in Medicine | volume = 2 | issue = 4 | pages = 417–27 | year = 1983 | pmid = 6369471 | doi = 10.1002/sim.4780020401 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RTM&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barnett AG, van der Pols JC, Dobson AJ | title = Regression to the mean: what it is and how to deal with it | journal = International Journal of Epidemiology | volume = 34 | issue = 1 | pages = 215–20 | date = February 2005 | pmid = 15333621 | doi = 10.1093/ije/dyh299 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and flawed research methodologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hróbjartsson A, Gøtzsche PC | author-link1 = Asbjørn Hróbjartsson | author-link2 = Peter C.

[[childhood|Children]] seem to have greater response than [[adults]] to placebos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rheims S, Cucherat M, Arzimanoglou A, Ryvlin P | title = Greater response to placebo in children than in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis in drug-resistant partial epilepsy | journal = PLoS Medicine | volume = 5 | issue = 8 | pages = e166 | date = August 2008 | pmid = 18700812 | pmc = 2504483 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.0050166 | editor1-last = Klassen | editor1-first = Terry }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Factors influencing the power of the placebo effect ===
A review published in ''JAMA Psychiatry'' found that, in trials of antipsychotic medications, the change in response to receiving a placebo had increased significantly between 1960 and 2013. The review's authors identified several factors that could be responsible for this change, including inflation of baseline scores and enrollment of fewer severely ill patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rutherford BR, Pott E, Tandler JM, Wall MM, Roose SP, Lieberman JA | title = Placebo response in antipsychotic clinical trials: a meta-analysis | journal = JAMA Psychiatry | volume = 71 | issue = 12 | pages = 1409–21 | date = December 2014 | pmid = 25321611 | pmc = 4256120 | doi = 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2014.1319 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another analysis published in ''Pain'' in 2015 found that placebo responses had increased considerably in [[neuropathic pain]] clinical trials conducted in the United States from 1990 to 2013. The researchers suggested that this may be because such trials have "increased in study size and length" during this time period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tuttle AH, Tohyama S, Ramsay T, Kimmelman J, Schweinhardt P, Bennett GJ, Mogil JS | title = Increasing placebo responses over time in U.S. clinical trials of neuropathic pain | journal = Pain | volume = 156 | issue = 12 | pages = 2616–26 | date = December 2015 | pmid = 26307858 | doi = 10.1097/j.pain.0000000000000333 | lay-url = http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2015/10/placebo-effect-is-getting-stronger.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symptoms and conditions===
A 2010 [[Cochrane Collaboration|Cochrane]] review suggests that placebo effects are only apparent in subjective, continuous measures, and in the treatment of pain and related conditions.&lt;ref name="CochraneHrob2010" /&gt;

==== Pain ====
Placebos are believed to be capable of altering a person's perception of pain. "A person might reinterpret a sharp pain as uncomfortable tingling."&lt;ref name=acs&gt;{{cite web |publisher=American Cancer Society |date=10 April 2015 |title=Placebo Effect |url=https://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatments-and-side-effects/clinical-trials/placebo-effect.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One way in which the magnitude of placebo analgesia can be measured is by conducting "open/hidden" studies, in which some patients receive an analgesic and are informed that they will be receiving it (open), while others are administered the same drug without their knowledge (hidden). Such studies have found that analgesics are considerably more effective when the patient knows they are receiving them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Price DD, Finniss DG, Benedetti F | title = A comprehensive review of the placebo effect: recent advances and current thought | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 59 | issue = 1 | pages = 565–90 | date = 2008 | pmid = 17550344 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.psych.59.113006.095941 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Depression ====
In 2008, a controversial meta-analysis led by psychologist [[Irving Kirsch]], analyzing data from the FDA, concluded that 82% of the response to antidepressants was accounted for by placebos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kirsch I, Deacon BJ, Huedo-Medina TB, Scoboria A, Moore TJ, Johnson BT | title = Initial severity and antidepressant benefits: a meta-analysis of data submitted to the Food and Drug Administration | journal = PLoS Medicine | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = e45 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 18303940 | pmc = 2253608 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.0050045 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are serious doubts about the used methods and the interpretation of the results, especially the use of 0.5 as cut-off point for the [[Effect size|effect-size]].&lt;ref name="TurnerRosenthal2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Turner EH, Rosenthal R | title = Efficacy of antidepressants | journal = BMJ | volume = 336 | issue = 7643 | pages = 516–7 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 18319297 | pmc = 2265347 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.39510.531597.80 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A complete reanalysis and recalculation based on the same FDA data discovered that the Kirsch study suffered from "important flaws in the calculations". The authors concluded that although a large percentage of the placebo response was due to expectancy, this was not true for the active drug. Besides confirming drug effectiveness, they found that the drug effect was not related to depression severity.&lt;ref name="FountoulakisMöller2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fountoulakis KN, Möller HJ | title = Efficacy of antidepressants: a re-analysis and re-interpretation of the Kirsch data | journal = The International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology | volume = 14 | issue = 3 | pages = 405–12 | date = April 2011 | pmid = 20800012 | doi = 10.1017/S1461145710000957 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another meta-analysis found that 79% of depressed patients receiving placebo remained well (for 12 weeks after an initial 6–8 weeks of successful therapy) compared to 93% of those receiving antidepressants. In the continuation phase however, patients on placebo relapsed significantly more often than patients on antidepressants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Khan A, Redding N, Brown WA | title = The persistence of the placebo response in antidepressant clinical trials | journal = Journal of Psychiatric Research | volume = 42 | issue = 10 | pages = 791–6 | date = August 2008 | pmid = 18036616 | doi = 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2007.10.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Chronic fatigue syndrome ====
It was previously assumed that placebo response rates in patients with [[chronic fatigue syndrome]] (CFS) are unusually high, "at least 30% to 50%", because of the subjective reporting of symptoms and the fluctuating nature of the condition. According to a meta-analysis and contrary to conventional wisdom, the pooled response rate in the placebo group was 19.6%, even lower than in some other medical conditions. The authors offer possible explanations for this result: CFS is widely understood to be difficult to treat, which could reduce expectations of improvement. In context of evidence showing placebos do not have powerful clinical effects when compared to no treatment, a low rate of spontaneous remission in CFS could contribute to reduced improvement rates in the placebo group. Intervention type also contributed to the heterogeneity of the response. Low patient and provider expectations regarding psychological treatment may explain particularly low placebo responses to psychiatric treatments.&lt;ref name="PMID 15784798"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cho HJ, Hotopf M, Wessely S | title = The placebo response in the treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Psychosomatic Medicine | volume = 67 | issue = 2 | pages = 301–13 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15784798 | doi = 10.1097/01.psy.0000156969.76986.e0 | url = http://www.psychosomaticmedicine.org/cgi/content/full/67/2/301.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Negative effects ===
{{See also|Nocebo}}
A phenomenon opposite to the placebo effect has also been observed. When an inactive substance or treatment is administered to a recipient who has an expectation of it having a ''negative'' impact, this intervention is known as a '''nocebo''' ([[Latin]] ''nocebo'' = "I shall harm").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nocebo|title=nocebo|access-date=22 January 2017|publisher=Mirriam-Webster Incorporated}}&lt;/ref&gt; A '''nocebo effect''' occurs when the recipient of an inert substance reports a negative effect or a worsening of symptoms, with the outcome resulting not from the substance itself, but from negative expectations about the treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Häuser W, Hansen E, Enck P | title = Nocebo phenomena in medicine: their relevance in everyday clinical practice | journal = Deutsches Arzteblatt International | volume = 109 | issue = 26 | pages = 459–65 | date = June 2012 | pmid = 22833756 | pmc = 3401955 | doi = 10.3238/arztebl.2012.0459 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://priory.com/medicine/Nocebo.htm |title=The Nocebo Effect |publisher=Priory.com |date=10 February 2007 |access-date=2009-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another negative consequence is that placebos can cause [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side-effects]] associated with real treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shapiro AK, Chassan J, Morris LA, Frick R |year=1974 |title=Placebo induced side effects |journal=Journal of Operational Psychiatry |volume=6 |pages=43–6 |url=http://psycnet.apa.org/?fa=main.doiLanding&amp;uid=1977-04006-001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Withdrawal symptoms can also occur after placebo treatment. This was found, for example, after the discontinuation of the [[Women's Health Initiative]] study of [[Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|hormone replacement therapy]] for [[menopause]]. Women had been on placebo for an average of 5.7 years. Moderate or severe [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] symptoms were reported by 4.8% of those on placebo compared to 21.3% of those on hormone replacement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ockene JK, Barad DH, Cochrane BB, Larson JC, Gass M, Wassertheil-Smoller S, Manson JE, Barnabei VM, Lane DS, Brzyski RG, Rosal MC, Wylie-Rosett J, Hays J | title = Symptom experience after discontinuing use of estrogen plus progestin | journal = JAMA | volume = 294 | issue = 2 | pages = 183–93 | date = July 2005 | pmid = 16014592 | doi = 10.1001/jama.294.2.183 | url = http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/reprint/294/2/183 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethics==
{{see also|Medical ethics|Philosophy of medicine}}

=== In research trials ===
Knowingly giving a person a placebo when there is an effective treatment available is a bioethically complex issue. While placebo-controlled trials might provide information about the effectiveness of a treatment, it denies some patients what could be the best available (if unproven) treatment. [[Informed consent]] is usually required for a study to be considered ethical, including the disclosure that some test subjects will receive placebo treatments.

The ethics of placebo-controlled studies have been debated in the revision process of the [[Declaration of Helsinki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Howick J | title = Questioning the methodologic superiority of 'placebo' over 'active' controlled trials | journal = The American Journal of Bioethics | volume = 9 | issue = 9 | pages = 34–48 | date = September 2009 | pmid = 19998192 | doi = 10.1080/15265160903090041 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of particular concern has been the difference between trials comparing inert placebos with experimental treatments, versus comparing the best available treatment with an experimental treatment; and differences between trials in the sponsor's developed countries versus the trial's targeted developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kottow M | title = The improper use of research placebos | journal = Journal of Evaluation in Clinical Practice | volume = 16 | issue = 6 | pages = 1041–4 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 20663001 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2753.2009.01246.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some suggest that existing medical treatments should be used instead of placebos, to avoid having some patients not receive medicine during the trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Michels KB | title = The placebo problem remains | journal = Archives of General Psychiatry | volume = 57 | issue = 4 | pages = 321–2 | date = April 2000 | pmid = 10768689 | doi = 10.1001/archpsyc.57.4.321 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In medical practice ===

Critics of the practice responded that it is unethical to prescribe treatments that do not work, and that telling a patient (as opposed to a research test subject) that a placebo is a real medication is deceptive and harms the doctor–patient relationship in the long run. Critics also argued that using placebos can delay the proper diagnosis and treatment of serious medical conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Altunç U, Pittler MH, Ernst E | title = Homeopathy for childhood and adolescence ailments: systematic review of randomized clinical trials | journal = Mayo Clinic Proceedings | volume = 82 | issue = 1 | pages = 69–75 | date = January 2007 | pmid = 17285788 | doi = 10.4065/82.1.69 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While some say that blanket consent, or the general consent to unspecified treatment given by patients beforehand, is ethical, others argue that patients should always obtain specific information about the name of the drug they are receiving, its side effects, and other treatment options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Asai A, Kadooka Y | title = Reexamination of the ethics of placebo use in clinical practice | journal = Bioethics | volume = 27 | issue = 4 | pages = 186–93 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 22296589 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8519.2011.01943.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; This view is shared by some on the grounds of [[Autonomy#Medicine|patient autonomy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chua SJ, Pitts M | title = The ethics of prescription of placebos to patients with major depressive disorder | journal = Chinese Medical Journal | volume = 128 | issue = 11 | pages = 1555–7 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 26021517 | doi = 10.4103/0366-6999.157699 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also concerns that legitimate doctors and pharmacists could open themselves up to charges of fraud or malpractice by using a placebo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Malani|first1=Anup | name-list-format = vanc |title=Regulation with Placebo Effects|journal=Chicago Unbound|date=2008|volume=58|page=455|url=https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2640&amp;context=journal_articles|access-date=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 25% of physicians in both the Danish and Israeli studies used placebos as a diagnostic tool to determine if a patient's symptoms were real, or if the patient was [[malingering]]. Both the critics and defenders of the medical use of placebos agreed that this was unethical.&lt;ref name=Spiegel&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Spiegel D | title = Placebos in practice | journal = BMJ | volume = 329 | issue = 7472 | pages = 927–8 | date = October 2004 | pmid = 15499085 | pmc = 524090 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.329.7472.927 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''British Medical Journal'' editorial said, "That a patient gets pain relief from a placebo does not imply that the pain is not real or organic in origin...the use of the placebo for 'diagnosis' of whether or not pain is real is misguided."

Referring specifically to [[homeopathy]], the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]] Science and Technology Committee has stated:{{quote|In the Committee's view, homeopathy is a placebo treatment and the Government should have a policy on prescribing placebos. The Government is reluctant to address the appropriateness and ethics of prescribing placebos to patients, which usually relies on some degree of patient deception. Prescribing of placebos is not consistent with informed patient choice—which the Government claims is very important—as it means patients do not have all the information needed to make choice meaningful.

Beyond ethical issues and the integrity of the doctor–patient relationship, prescribing pure placebos is bad medicine. Their effect is unreliable and unpredictable and cannot form the sole basis of any treatment on the NHS.&lt;ref name=inquiry_cfm&gt;{{cite web |author1=UK Parliamentary Committee Science |author2=Technology Committee |url=http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-archive/science-technology/s-t-homeopathy-inquiry/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224202602/http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-archive/science-technology/s-t-homeopathy-inquiry/ |archive-date=2012-02-24 |title=Evidence Check 2: Homeopathy }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A survey in the United States of more than 10,000 physicians came to the result that while 24% of physicians would prescribe a treatment that is a placebo simply because the patient wanted treatment, 58% would not, and for the remaining 18%, it would depend on the circumstances.&lt;ref name=kane&gt;[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/731485_7 Doctors Struggle With Tougher-Than-Ever Dilemmas: Other Ethical Issues] Author: Leslie Kane. 11/11/2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanisms ==
Expectation plays a clear role. A placebo presented as a [[stimulant]] may trigger an effect on [[heart rhythm]] and [[blood pressure]], but when administered as a [[depressant]], the opposite effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Kirsch I |year=1997 |chapter=Specifying non-specifics: Psychological mechanism of the placebo effect |editor=Harrington A |title=The Placebo Effect: An Interdisciplinary Exploration |location=Cambridge |publisher=Harvard University Press |pages=166–86 |isbn=978-0-674-66986-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychology ===
[[File:"Miracle Cure!" Health Fraud Scams (8528312890).jpg|thumb|right|The "placebo effect" may be related to expectations]]

In psychology, the two main hypotheses of placebo effect are expectancy theory and [[classical conditioning]].&lt;ref name="podd" /&gt;

In 1985, [[Irving Kirsch]] hypothesized that placebo effects are produced by the self-fulfilling effects of response expectancies, in which the belief that one will feel different leads a person to actually feel different.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kirsch I |year=1985|title=Response expectancy as a determinant of experience and behavior|url=|journal=American Psychologist|volume=40|issue=11|pages=1189–1202|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.40.11.1189}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this theory, the belief that one has received an active treatment can produce the subjective changes thought to be produced by the real treatment. Placebos can act similarly through [[classical conditioning]], wherein a placebo and an actual stimulus are used simultaneously until the placebo is associated with the effect from the actual stimulus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Voudouris NJ, Peck CL, Coleman G | title = Conditioned response models of placebo phenomena: further support | journal = Pain | volume = 38 | issue = 1 | pages = 109–16 | date = July 1989 | pmid = 2780058 | doi = 10.1016/0304-3959(89)90080-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both conditioning and expectations play a role in placebo effect,&lt;ref name="podd"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stewart-Williams S, Podd J | title = The placebo effect: dissolving the expectancy versus conditioning debate | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 130 | issue = 2 | pages = 324–40 | date = March 2004 | pmid = 14979775 | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.130.2.324 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and make different kinds of contribution. Conditioning has a longer-lasting effect,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Klinger R, Soost S, Flor H, Worm M | title = Classical conditioning and expectancy in placebo hypoalgesia: a randomized controlled study in patients with atopic dermatitis and persons with healthy skin | journal = Pain | volume = 128 | issue = 1-2 | pages = 31–9 | date = March 2007 | pmid = 17030095 | doi = 10.1016/j.pain.2006.08.025 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and can affect earlier stages of information processing.&lt;ref name="Colloca et al 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Colloca L, Tinazzi M, Recchia S, Le Pera D, Fiaschi A, Benedetti F, Valeriani M | title = Learning potentiates neurophysiological and behavioral placebo analgesic responses | journal = Pain | volume = 139 | issue = 2 | pages = 306–14 | date = October 2008 | pmid = 18538928 | doi = 10.1016/j.pain.2008.04.021 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Those that think that a treatment will work display a stronger placebo effect than those that do not, as evidenced by a study of acupuncture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Linde K, Witt CM, Streng A, Weidenhammer W, Wagenpfeil S, Brinkhaus B, Willich SN, Melchart D | title = The impact of patient expectations on outcomes in four randomized controlled trials of acupuncture in patients with chronic pain | journal = Pain | volume = 128 | issue = 3 | pages = 264–71 | date = April 2007 | pmid = 17257756 | doi = 10.1016/j.pain.2006.12.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, [[motivation]] may contribute to the placebo effect. The active goals of an individual changes their somatic experience by altering the detection and interpretation of expectation-congruent symptoms, and by changing the behavioral strategies a person pursues.&lt;ref name="Geers et al"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Geers AL, Weiland PE, Kosbab K, Landry SJ, Helfer SG | title = Goal activation, expectations, and the placebo effect | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 89 | issue = 2 | pages = 143–59 | date = August 2005 | pmid = 16162050 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.89.2.143 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Motivation may link to the meaning through which people experience illness and treatment. Such meaning is derived from the culture in which they live and which informs them about the nature of illness and how it responds to treatment.

===Placebo effect and the brain===

It has been known that placebo analgesia depends upon the release in the brain of [[Opioid#Endogenous opioids|endogenous opioids]] since 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Levine JD, Gordon NC, Fields HL | title = The mechanism of placebo analgesia | journal = Lancet | volume = 2 | issue = 8091 | pages = 654–7 | date = September 1978 | pmid = 80579 | doi = 10.1016/s0140-6736(78)92762-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such analgesic placebos activation changes processing lower down in the brain by enhancing the descending inhibition through the periaqueductal gray on spinal [[Withdrawal reflex|nociceptive reflexes]], while the expectations of anti-analgesic nocebos acts in the opposite way to block this.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt;

Functional imaging upon placebo analgesia has been summarized as showing that the placebo response is "mediated by "top-down" processes dependent on frontal cortical areas that generate and maintain cognitive expectancies. [[Dopamine pathways|Dopaminergic reward pathways]] may underlie these expectancies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Faria V, Fredrikson M, Furmark T | title = Imaging the placebo response: a neurofunctional review | journal = European Neuropsychopharmacology | volume = 18 | issue = 7 | pages = 473–85 | date = July 2008 | pmid = 18495442 | doi = 10.1016/j.euroneuro.2008.03.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Diseases lacking major 'top-down' or cortically based regulation may be less prone to placebo-related improvement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Diederich NJ, Goetz CG | title = The placebo treatments in neurosciences: New insights from clinical and neuroimaging studies | journal = Neurology | volume = 71 | issue = 9 | pages = 677–84 | date = August 2008 | pmid = 18725593 | doi = 10.1212/01.wnl.0000324635.49971.3d }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brain and body===
{{Details|Neural top–down control of physiology}}

In conditioning, a neutral stimulus [[saccharin]] is paired in a drink with an agent that produces an unconditioned response. For example, that agent might be [[cyclophosphamide]], which causes [[immunosuppressive|immunosuppression]]. After learning this pairing, the taste of saccharin by itself is able to cause immunosuppression, as a new conditioned response via neural top-down control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ader R, Cohen N | title = Behaviorally conditioned immunosuppression | journal = Psychosomatic Medicine | volume = 37 | issue = 4 | pages = 333–40 | year = 1975 | pmid = 1162023 | doi = 10.1097/00006842-197507000-00007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such conditioning has been found to affect a diverse variety of not just basic physiological processes in the immune system but ones such as [[Serum iron|serum iron levels]], [[DNA oxidation|oxidative DNA damage]] levels, and [[insulin]] secretion.

The word placebo was used in a medicinal context in the late 18th century to describe a "commonplace method or medicine" and in 1811 it was defined as "any medicine adapted more to please than to benefit the patient". Although this definition contained a derogatory implication&lt;ref name="Shapiro"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Shapiro AK |title=Semantics of the placebo |journal=Psychiatric Quarterly |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=653–95 |year=1968 |pmid=4891851 |doi=10.1007/BF01564309 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it did not necessarily imply that the remedy had no effect.&lt;ref name="Kaptchuk"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kaptchuk TJ |title=Powerful placebo: the dark side of the randomised controlled trial |journal=The Lancet |volume=351 |issue=9117 |pages=1722–5 |date=June 1998 |pmid=9734904 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(97)10111-8 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(97)10111-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Placebos have featured in medical use until well into the twentieth century.&lt;ref name=HistoricalOverview&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = de Craen AJ, Kaptchuk TJ, Tijssen JG, Kleijnen J | title = Placebos and placebo effects in medicine: historical overview | journal = Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine | volume = 92 | issue = 10 | pages = 511–5 | date = October 1999 | pmid = 10692902 | pmc = 1297390 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955 [[Henry K. Beecher]] published an influential paper entitled ''The Powerful Placebo'' which proposed idea that placebo effects were clinically important.&lt;ref name="Hrob2001"/&gt; Subsequent re-analysis of his materials, however, found in them no evidence of any "placebo effect".&lt;ref name="Kienle &amp; Kiene"/&gt;

===Placebo-controlled studies===
{{Main|Placebo-controlled study}}

The placebo effect makes it more difficult to evaluate new treatments. Clinical trials control for this effect by including a group of subjects that receives a sham treatment. The subjects in such trials are blinded as to whether they receive the treatment or a placebo. If a person is given a placebo under one name, and they respond, they will respond in the same way on a later occasion to that placebo under that name but not if under another.&lt;ref name="pmid18440407"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Whalley B, Hyland ME, Kirsch I | title = Consistency of the placebo effect | journal = Journal of Psychosomatic Research | volume = 64 | issue = 5 | pages = 537–41 | date = May 2008 | pmid = 18440407 | doi = 10.1016/j.jpsychores.2007.11.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clinical trials are often double-blinded so that the researchers also do not know which test subjects are receiving the active or placebo treatment. The placebo effect in such clinical trials is weaker than in normal therapy since the subjects are not sure whether the treatment they are receiving is active.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vase L, Riley JL, Price DD | title = A comparison of placebo effects in clinical analgesic trials versus studies of placebo analgesia | journal = Pain | volume = 99 | issue = 3 | pages = 443–52 | date = October 2002 | pmid = 12406519 | doi = 10.1016/S0304-3959(02)00205-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Psychographic segmentation''' has been used in [[marketing research]] as a form of [[market segmentation]] which divides consumers into sub-groups based on shared psychological characteristics, including subconscious or conscious beliefs, motivations, and priorities to explain and predict consumer behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/psychographics |title=Psychographics |date=n.d. |website=Merriam-Webster Dictionary |accessdate=June 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developed in the 1970´s, it applies behavioral and social sciences to explore to understand consumers’ decision-making processesconsumer attitudes, values, personalities, lifestyles, and communication preferences. It complements demographic and socioeconomic segmentation, and enables marketers to target audiences with messaging to market brands, products or services. When attitudes,motivations, personality characteristics and belief systems are analyzed statistically to determine groups with substantially different attitudes, the result is psychographic segmentation psychographic segmentation will help advertisers to target the most receptive audience for their message.&lt;ref&gt;Raj, M., Prasanna, M., &amp; Sait, A. K. (2015). Psychographic Profiling of Indian Young Adult Consumers of Smartphone-VALS Approach. Management Studies and Economic Systems, 2(2), 95-102.&lt;/ref&gt;Some consider lifestyle segmentation to be interchangeable with psychographic segmentation, marketing experts argue that lifestyle relates specifically to overt behaviors while psychographics relate to consumers' cognitive style, which is based on their "patterns of thinking, feeling and perceiving".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://acrwebsite.org/volumes/6285/volumes/v11/NA-11 |title=Lifestyle and Psychographics: a Critical Review and Recommendation |author=W. Thomas Anderson |author2=Linda L. Golden |year=1984 |magazine=NA - Advances in Consumer Research Volume 11 |accessdate=June 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

== History ==

In 1964, Harvard alumnus and social scientist [[Daniel Yankelovich]] wrote that traditional demographic traits—sex, age and education level—lacked the insights marketers needed to inform their strategies. He suggested to use of non-demographic segmentation to help companies better predict consumer behavior, to improve product development, distribution, pricing and advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://hbr.org/2006/02/rediscovering-market-segmentation |title=Rediscovering Market Segmentation |magazine=Harvard Business Review |author=Daniel Yankelovich |author2=David Meer |year=2006 |accessdate=June 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time, market researcher Emanuel Demby began using the term ‘psychographics,’ to reference variations in attitudes, values and behaviors within a specific demographic segment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.ama.org/archive/ResourceLibrary/MarketingResearch/documents/9511240220.pdf |title=Psychographics Revisited: The Birth of a Technique |magazine=Marketing News |author=Emanuel H. Demby |year=1989 |accessdate=June 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a decade, [[Arnold Mitchell]] and others at the [[Stanford Research Institute]] developed the Values Attitudes and Lifestyles (VALS) psychographic methodology. Despite critics—including Daniel Yankelovich— it was embraced by leading marketers, prompting [[Advertising Age]] to call VALS "one of the ten top market research breakthroughs of the 1980s."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sri.com/work/timeline-innovation/timeline.php?tag=seminal-innovations#!&amp;innovation=vals-market-research |title=VALS™ Market Research |website=SRI International |accessdate=June 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages and disadvantages==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}
Advances in computing power and the era of big data has fueled the use of all types of segmentation. By applying analytics to break down the marketplace of consumers into smaller groups, marketers and advertisers can profile and target key audiences more effectively. Each type of segmentation offers pros and cons.

# Attitudinal and psychographic segments may be projected across a population through predictive modeling based on many variables, though the accuracy may be greatly reduced.

Ultimately, the argument for any type of segmentation is to identify high-yield target markets that are likely to meet growth potential, profitability, or other specific goals.

== Methods of model development==

The traditional way to develop a psychographic segmentation model has been through a market research study surveying a statistically representative sample of a target audience. That target audience could be representative of the general population, a specific demographic or socioeconomic group, a population of consumers who utilize a certain product or service category or any group of people relevant to one’s research or business objectives.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

The first step is the development of a robust questionnaire consisting of a series of attitudinal statements, often using a [[Likert scale]] (e.g., Strongly Agree = 1, Agree = 2, Neither Agree Nor Disagree = 3, Disagree = 4, Strongly Disagree = 5), to assess consumer beliefs about a given subject. Consideration should be given to dimensions that will differentiate consumers in the market, such as attitudes and beliefs about a certain topic or behaviors in a specific situation.{{cn|date=April 2018}}    

A [[factor analysis]] using statistical clustering procedures is conducted to examine response patterns to the survey questions. Natural clusters or segments emerge from groups of respondents who answer the survey questions in a similar manner. A useful illustration is a [[scatter plot]] with all of the respondents' answers that shows clusters of respondents who answered the survey questions similarly. Taking all the survey questions into account, consistent groups — or psychographic segments — are identified.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

Statistical analysis of the respondents' answers can also identify an algorithm that uses a subset of the survey questions to classify consumers according to the psychographic segments. This could involve five, ten, fifteen or other limited set of questions that effectively categorize consumers by segment.{{cn|date=April 2018}} 

In addition to using surveys to gather psychographic data, experts{{who|date=April 2018}} suggest that social media monitoring and analytics can also help marketers identify trends in consumer interests, attitudes, sentiments, and psychographic clusters.&lt;ref name=alexandra&gt;{{cite web |url=https://hbr.org/2016/03/psychographics-are-just-as-important-for-marketers-as-demographics |title=Psychographics Are Just as Important for Marketers as Demographics |author=Alexandra Samuel |year=2016 |accessdate=June 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After using [[quantitative marketing research]] to identify psychographic segments, many marketers and researchers will follow up with [[qualitative research]] (e.g., focus groups and one-on-one interviews) with members of each psychographic segment. This allows for additional insights and translation of the quantitative data from the perspective of each segment. This is a useful step for helping to prevent bias in the researcher’s interpretation of the data, as researchers may view data through the lens of their own attitudes and motivations.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

The optimal psychographic segmentation model should meet several criteria:{{cn|date=April 2018}}

# It provides the most differentiation when comparing segments.
# It produces segments that are internally consistent.
# It provides actionable insights.
# It creates solutions that are stable and reproducible.
# It balances predictability with practicality.

A psychographic segmentation model should be able to accurately predict the segment to which a consumer belongs with an acceptable level of confidence. Often there are trade-offs involved. For instance, a model may attain a higher level of predictability with a greater number of segments, but too many segments become unwieldy and infeasible to juggle when operationalizing the model. This also pertains to the number of questions used in the algorithm to classify consumers by segment. More questions may be more predictive, but there are diminishing returns past a certain number of questions, and too many questions decrease completion rates among consumers.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

== Examples of psychographic segmentation use ==

Consumers recognize that modern marketers and advertisers collect a wealth of data about prospects and customers. As a result, consumers hold brands to a higher standard. Individual consumers expect greater relevance and personalized brand experiences in exchange for the information they share. These expectations, in turn, have increased the need for psychographic segmentation. 

=== Retail industry ===

Marketers of educational/entertainment technology for the family (e.g., e-readers and video game systems), for example, can identify key audiences based on family income, ages of children in the household, or other demographic indicators. However, these factors do not identify the "why" behind purchases. Using psychographic segmentation, marketers can drill down to types of purchasers:&lt;ref name=alexandra /&gt; 

* 'Enablers' who focus on the entertainment value of technology tend to let their children guide tech decisions.
* 'Limiters' who regulate screen time tend to look for technology that offers educational value and family participation options.

Understanding these psychographic variations among likely consumers allows marketers to fine-tune keyword targeting to appeal to these distinct sub-groups. 

Similarly, a retail drugstore chain uses a combination of segmentation to identify a super-user who is motivated by a sense of responsibility for family. Marketing strategies are therefore focused on a customer persona of a woman in her early 50s who manages medications for her children, herself and her spouse, and her aging parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cmo.com/opinion/articles/2013/7/8/_5_segmentation_less.html#gs.fiDMZFo |title=5 Segmentation Lessons from CVS |author=Michael Hinshaw |year=2013 |accessdate=June 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Travel industry ===	

Business travelers have different needs and expectations than vacationers. However, marketing to such broad categories alone fails to capture motivations and personal preferences. Within the broad segment of Leisure Travelers, for example, travel brands can use psychographic segmentation to drill down to identify individuals as 'novelty-seeking' versus 'familiarity-seeking' consumers, and then customize campaigns based on the most relevant travel style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/10548400903163129 |title=Identifying Leisure Travel Market Segments based on Preference for Novelty |author=Pamela A. Weaver |author2=Ken W. McCleary |author3=Jiho Han |author4=Phillip E. Blosser |journal=Journal of Travel &amp; Tourism Marketing |year=2008 |accessdate=July 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knowing that a consumer is 'familiarity-seeking', for example, could lead a travel brand to market guided tour travel packages to that consumer; a 'novelty-seeking' consumer could be targeted with a build-your-own tour package. 

=== Healthcare industry ===

The healthcare industry faces an ongoing mandate to engage patients more effectively to address chronic disease and engage in healthier behaviors. However, experts note that segmentation based on demographic or socioeconomic factors falls short on motivating engagement. Similarly, one-size-fits-all programs based on a shared diagnosis do not lead to high adoption rates of recommended behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01988/full |title=Psychographic Profiling for Effective Health Behavior Change Interventions |author=Sarah J. Hardcastle |author2=Martin S. Hagger |journal=Frontiers in Psychology |year=2016 |accessdate=July 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychographic segmentation applied to healthcare consumers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b8neUCvnew |title=Psychographic Segmentation Defined |author=c2b solutions |publication-date=June 22, 2017 |via=YouTube |accessdate=July 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; can help healthcare organizations, health insurance providers, healthcare-related retailers and others classify individual consumers according to whether they:

*are proactively engaged in health and wellness or reactive and disengaged,
*need directive guidance by healthcare professionals or want options and choices in their care,
*believe in holistic and alternative medicine or dismiss it, relying only on traditional medicine,
*prioritize others' health and wellness over their own,
*display various other motivations, priorities and preferences. 

Segmenting healthcare consumers by these factors allows one to customize messaging (whether verbal, print or digital) to appeal to individual motivations to improve overall engagement, drive behavior changes, boost adherence to care plans or increase adoption of medical devices and apps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.c2bsolutions.com/psychographic-segmentation |title=Healthcare-Related Psychographic Segmentation |website=c2b solutions |accessdate=July 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
REDCap was developed by an informatics team at [[Vanderbilt University]] with ongoing support from [[National Center for Research Resources|NCRR]] and [[NIH]] grants.&lt;ref&gt;[NCRR grants 5M01-RR00095, G12RR03051, 5M01RR000058-45, and 1 UL1 RR024975 from NCRR/NIH]&lt;/ref&gt; REDCap was designed to address common problems for academic biomedical researchers hoping to use electronic databases. First, major vendor EDC and [[Clinical data management system|CDMS]] solutions are targeted and priced for large clinical trials, and can be prohibitively expensive for investigator-initiated studies or other such studies at a smaller scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michelle Zubatch |url=http://www.bio-itworld.com/issues/2006/april/cdms/ |title=Value of Hosted Clinical Data Environments |publisher=Bio-itworld.com |date=2006-04-14 |accessdate=2012-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, the independent research environment often lacks the informatics and other multidisciplinary support necessary for effective IT integration into research protocols.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The REDCap software as distributed through the REDCap consortium attempts to facilitate informatics support for clinical researchers and foster a collaborative network of institutional researchers who share and support REDCap as a common research tool.&lt;ref name="autogenerated377"/&gt;

==Software licensing and intended use==
Although REDCap is available at no charge to institutional partners – discounting the cost of internal IT support staffing – REDCap is expressly not [[open-source software]]. Certain end-user license agreements distinguish it from a typical open-source license. Namely, the software is restricted in use, permitted only for non-commercial research purposes. REDCap is also restricted in redistribution because Vanderbilt is the only entity that can distribute it. Furthermore, any and all derived works – such as innovations or programmatic features added on by the user – are essentially owned by Vanderbilt.  Vanderbilt catalogues such derived works in their REDCap Consortium library, which is available to all consortium members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.project-redcap.org |title=REDCap |publisher=Project-redcap.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The REDCap End-User License Agreement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.project-redcap.org/participate.php |title=End-User License Agreement |publisher=Project-redcap.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; also encompasses control by Vanderbilt over its licensees' publications on or about REDCap, specifying that Vanderbilt shall coordinate and have editorial control over any ''"publications created by CONSORTIUM MEMBERS which discuss the SOFTWARE and its methodologies, functionality, and/or abilities."'' Publications that describe scientific studies which have utilized REDCap are excepted from these editorial restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://redcap.vanderbilt.edu/consortium/REDCap_License_Agreement.pdf Sections 3.2, 3.3 of End-User License Agreement], (accessed 2010-Sep-30).&lt;/ref&gt;

The REDCap software is distributed from Vanderbilt to institutional consortium partners, who in turn give research teams access to REDCap. REDCap project design has an intended workflow outlined by the developers.&lt;ref name="autogenerated377"/&gt; Upon request, the informatics core gives the research team a demonstration of REDCap, highlighting the most relevant user interface features. The researchers then fill out a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet file with key metadata (i.e. field name, data-type, data range, etc.) about each measurement in their [[case report form|CRF]]. The informatics core converts this spreadsheet template into study-specific database tables which are linked to a working web-based EDC forms and applications environment. The researchers then test this prototype web application by filling out dummy data, and the metadata spreadsheet is revised and refined in an iterative process. Once the REDCap project design is finalized, the application is deployed from development to production mode, all dummy data is lost, and researchers begin committing actual patient data.

The REDCap design workflow has important limitations. When a project is deployed into production mode, further revisions in database design need to be approved by the informatics core. Furthermore, certain production mode revisions are simply not allowed. For instance, when applying the REDCap calendar tool, production mode revisions to calendar metadata is prohibited, so researchers are advised to be very careful in formulating metadata and event-handlers before committing to the inflexibility of production mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://redcap.vanderbilt.edu/consortium/videoplayer.php?video=calendar_and_cal_data_entry01.flv&amp;title=The+Project+Calendar+%285+min%29&amp;text=&amp;referer=REDCAP_PUBLIC |title=The Project Calendar (5 min) |publisher=Redcap.vanderbilt.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="993">'''Rod sheath''' is an area identified in [[histology|histologic]] sections of a [[tooth]].  It is found where [[enamel rod]]s, the functional unit of [[tooth enamel|enamel]], meet [[interrod enamel]].  The [[crystal]]s of both types of enamel meet at sharp angles and form the appearance of a space called the rod sheath.  As a result of this space, the rod sheath consists of more [[protein]] (as opposed to minerals) than other areas of enamel.  For this reason, the rod sheath is characterized as being hypomineralized in comparison to the rest of the highly mineralized enamel.

Additionally, the rod sheath is attributed with giving tooth enamel a "fish-scale" appearance under a microscope when the enamel has been demineralized or acid-etched.

The rod sheath is Inorganic matrix tying the enamel rods together

'''Self-cannibalism''' is the practice of eating oneself, also called '''autocannibalism''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meish.org/012951.php#_ftnref4 "Man-eaters: The Evidence for Coastal Tupi Cannibalism" ''mei(sh) dot org'']&lt;/ref&gt; or '''autosarcophagy'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mikellides AP |title=Two cases of self-cannibalism (autosarcophagy) |journal=Cyprus Med J |volume=3 |issue=12 |pages=498–500 |date=October 1950 |pmid=14849189 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar term which is applied differently is ''[[autophagy (cellular)|autophagy]]'', which specifically denotes the normal process of self-degradation by [[cell (biology)|cell]]s. While almost an exclusive term for this process, autophagy nonetheless has occasionally made its way into more common usage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.benecke.com/publications/2013/8/24/body-modification-autophagy Benecke, Mark "First report of non-psychotic self-cannibalism (autophagy), tongue splicing and scar patterns (scarification) as an extreme form of cultural body modification in a Western civilization"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Among humans==
===As a natural occurrence===
A certain amount of self-cannibalism occurs unwittingly, as the body consumes dead cells from the tongue and cheeks.
Ingesting one's own blood from an unintentional lesion such as a nose-bleed or an ulcer is clearly not intentional harvesting and consequently not considered cannibalistic. Ingesting one’s own blood on purpose from a deliberate wound is, however.

===As a disorder or symptom thereof===
{{Main|Autophagia}}
[[Nail-biting|Fingernail-biting]] that develops into fingernail-eating is a form of [[pica (disorder)|pica]], although many do not consider nail biting as a true form of cannibalism.{{fact|date=December 2012}}  Other forms of pica include the [[Trichotillomania|compulsion of eating one's own hair]], which can form a [[Trichobezoar|hairball]] in the [[stomach]].{{fact|date=December 2012}} Left untreated, this can cause death due to excessive hair buildup.

===As a choice===
Some people will engage in self-cannibalism as an extreme form of [[body modification]], for example eating their own skin.&lt;ref&gt;See Benecke above.&lt;/ref&gt; Others will drink their own blood, a practice called autovampirism,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=883741&amp;dopt=Abstract NCBI PubMed]&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Blood sucking#Human hematophagy|sucking blood]] from wounds is generally not considered cannibalism.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} [[Placentophagy]] may be a form of self-cannibalism.

==As a crime==
Forced self-cannibalism as a form of [[torture]] or [[war crime]] has been reported. [[Erzsébet Báthory]] allegedly forced some of her servants to eat their own flesh in the early 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/431/did-dracula-really-exist Adams, Cecil "Did Dracula really exist?" ''[[The Straight Dope]]'']&lt;/ref&gt;  Incidents were reported in the years following the [[1991 Haitian coup d'état]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/43a/045.html Chin, Pat. "Behind the Rockwood case" ''Workers World'', April 6, 1996]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, young people in [[Sudan]] were forced to eat their own ears.&lt;ref&gt;[http://justus.anglican.org/resources/Lambeth1998/Lambeth-Daily/06/humanrights.html ''Lambeth Daily News'' 6 August 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Among animals==
The short-tailed [[Cricket (insect)|cricket]] is known to eat its own wings.&lt;ref&gt;Taber, Stephen Welton (2005) ''Invertebrates Of Central Texas Wetlands'', page 200.&lt;/ref&gt;   There is evidence of certain animals digesting their own nervous tissue when they transition to a new phase of life.  The [[sea squirt]] (with a tadpole-like shape) contains a ganglion "brain" in its head, which it digests after attaching itself to a rock and becoming stationary, forming an [[sea anemone|anemone]]-like organism.  This has been used as evidence that the purpose of brain and nervous tissue is primarily to produce movement. Self-cannibalism behavior has been documented in [[North America]]n [[rat snake]]s: one captive snake attempted to consume itself twice, dying in the second attempt. Another wild rat snake was found having swallowed about two-thirds of its body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Mattison, Chris |title=The New Encyclopedia of Snakes |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, N.J. |year=2007 |isbn=0-691-13295-X |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= |page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2840">'''Sexual function''' is how the body reacts in different stages of the [[sexual response cycle]], or as a result of [[sexual dysfunction]]. Relevant aspects of sexual function are defined on the basis of a modified version of [[Masters and Johnson]]'s work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Masters |first= William |authorlink= Masters and Johnson|author2=Virginia E. Johnson |title=Human Sexual Response| publisher=Little, Brown &amp; Co. |year=1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aspects of sexual function defined as being relevant to the assessment include [[sexual desire]], [[erection]], [[orgasm]] and [[ejaculation]]. Guidelines for assessing sexual function are suggested and divided into four stages:

''Stage 1'' deals with the documentation of the defined aspects of sexual function. The main questions are: 
#Is the function intact? For example: Have there been any occurrences of erections or orgasms during a given period of time? 
#If the function is intact, what is the frequency and/or intensity of the function? For example: How often has the person had an orgasm or erections during the given period of time and how intense is the [[Orgasm#Physiological responses|orgasmic pleasure]] and [[Erection#Autonomic control|erection stiffness]] compared to youth or the best period in life. The suggested explanations for the absence or waning of functions at this stage are physiological and psychological.

''Stage 2'' deals with the assessment of the frequency of different sexual activities, such as intercourse, within a given time frame. The possible explanations for an absence or a decreased frequency of sexual activities may include physiological, [[psychological]], social, [[religious]] and [[ethical]] reasons.

''Stage 3'' it is estimated if or to what extent waning sexual functions and/or activities cause distress.

''Stage 4'', the association between the distress due to waning sexual function and [[Health|well-being]] and [[emotional isolation]] is assessed.

These guidelines were constructed to assess male sexual function&lt;ref&gt;[[Helgason ÁR]], Adolfsson J, Dickman P, Arver S, Fredrikson M, Göthberg M, Steineck G.

However, the concept has been modified and adapted for females.&lt;ref&gt;Bergmark K, Avall-Lundkvist E, Dickman PW, Henningsohn L, Steineck G.

It was merged with another congregation which had broken off from them shortly after their founding to form the [[Franciscan Sisters of Mary]]. As of May 2013, Sister Rose Mary Dowling, FSM, is the President and thus the ecclesiastical religious superior of the Sisters of St. Mary.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.fsmonline.org/leadership/leadershipteam/|title=Leadership {{!}} Franciscan Sisters of Mary|work=Franciscan Sisters of Mary|access-date=2018-06-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The congregation was founded in 1872 by Mother [[Mary Odilia Berger]], who emigrated to St. Louis from Germany. It shared a door with [[St. Mary of Victories Church]] in downtown St. Louis.

Anna Katherine (later Mother Mary Odilia) Berger was born in [[Regen]], [[Bavaria]].  In 1858 she joined the Poor Franciscan Sisters of Pirmasens, which later became the [[Poor Franciscan Sisters of the Holy Family]], founded by the [[beatification|Blessed]] [[Paul Joseph Nardini]], [[Third Order of Saint Francis|T.O.S.F.]]; she was sent to beg in [[Paris]].

Once in Paris, she co-founded the [[Sisters Servants of the Sacred Heart]]  with [[Abbé]] Victor Braun in 1866, but had to flee Paris when the city was besieged during the [[Franco-Prussian War]].  After living several years in [[Elberfeld]] in the [[Rhineland]], she emigrated to St. Louis in 1872.  In St. Louis she founded the Sisters of St. Mary.  In 1877 the congregation borrowed $16,000 to open St. Mary's Infirmary in St. Louis.  In 1878 a third of the [[Religious sister|sisters]] were sent to [[Canton, Mississippi]] and [[Memphis, Tennessee]] during a [[Yellow Fever]] outbreak to nurse the sick. Five sisters were to die themselves from the illness.

In 1894 Mother [[Mary Augustine Giesen]] led six Sisters to [[Maryville, Missouri]] where they formed an independent congregation, the '''[[Sisters of St. Francis of Maryville]]''' and founded the first full-fledged hospital in the town.

In 1985 the two congregations merged back together, in order to form the [[Franciscan Sisters of Mary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fsmonline.org/history/|title=History {{!}} Franciscan Sisters of Mary|work=Franciscan Sisters of Mary|access-date=2018-06-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twenty hospitals now are operated as [[SSM Health Care]] (SSMHC) in Illinois, Missouri, Oklahoma and Wisconsin.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3401">The '''Standing Committee of European Doctors''' (CPME) is a [[medical organization]] representing all medical doctors in the [[European Union]]. The abbreviation comes from the original French name for the committee, ''Comité Permanent des Médecins Européens''. CPME is composed of 33 member organizations, each of which is the most representative national medical organisation of a European Union/ European Economic Area country.

== Goals ==
The aim of CPME is to "promote the highest standards of medical training and medical practice in order to achieve the highest quality of health care for all citizens of Europe". CPME is also concerned with the promotion of public health, the relationship between patients and doctors and the free movement of doctors within the European Union [http://www.cpme.be/policy.php].

== Organization ==
The headquarters of CPME are situated in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]]. The CPME works in different sectors of the health policy:

* Professional Practice: Medical training, continuing professional development and quality improvement
* Medical ethics and professional codes
* eHealth and Health Technology
* Ethics and Human Rights
* Health literacy and patient empowerment
* Patient Safety and Quality of Care

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12218">[[File:Teodora Krajewska (cropped).jpg|right|thumb|Teodora Krajewska]]
'''Teodora Krajewska''' (née '''Kosmowska''', [[Germanized]] as '''Theodora'''; 1854–1935) was a Polish-born Austro-Hungarian physician, writer and teacher.

In her youth, Krajewska worked in schools and wrote novels. She surprised her family by moving to Switzerland to study medicine in 1883. In 1892, she was hired by the authorities of [[Austria-Hungary]] to work as a public health official in [[Condominium of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. One of the [[first women to practice medicine]] in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Austria-Hungary, Krajewska mainly treated [[Bosnian Muslim]] women, whom she regarded as susceptible to particular health problems. Krajewska wrote detailed notes about the state of women and Muslim customs. These writings, published in 1989, reveal the patronizing attitude towards Muslims that was common for the era. Krajewska stayed in Bosnia after the collapse of Austria-Hungary but the loss of eyesight forced her to retire in 1922. In 1928, she moved back to Warsaw, a decision she regretted, where she died.

== Family and education ==
Teodora Kosmowska was born to an [[intelligentsia]] family in [[Warsaw]], then part of [[Russian Poland]]. Her father, Ignacy, worked in a school, while her mother, Seweryna (née Główczyńska), brought up the couple's eight daughters. The family were friends with the Skłodowskis, whose daughter [[Marie Curie|Maria]] played with the Kosmowski daughters.&lt;ref name="Lis"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lis|first=Tomasz Jacek|url=http://o-historii.pl/teodora-krajewska-bosniacka-dr-quinn/|author-link=|title=Teodora Krajewska – bośniacka dr Quinn|website=o-historii.pl|date=|language=Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating from Warsaw's prestigious girls' [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]],&lt;ref name="Lis"/&gt; Teodora Kosmowska passed teacher's exam and started teaching [[arithmetic]] to gymnasium students.&lt;ref name="Tomašević"&gt;{{cite web|last=Tomašević|first=Dragana|url=http://stav.ba/teodora-krajewska-prva-lijecnica-u-bih/|author-link=|title=Teodora Krajewska – prva liječnica u BiH|website=stav.ba|date=30 April 2017|language=Serbo-Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt; She quit her job in 1876, when she married Ignacy Krajewski, a professor of [[classical philology]].&lt;ref name="Lis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tomašević"/&gt; The couple entertained various members of the intelligentsia at their home, including the writer [[Aleksander Świętochowski]] and the Skłodowskis. These contacts influenced Krajewska to start writing novels, poems, and literature reviews, as well as to translate.&lt;ref name="Tomašević"/&gt;

The turning point in Krajewska's life was the death of her husband in 1881. She at first resumed her teaching career, working in a private gymnasium run by her aunts, Leokadia and Bronislawa Kosmowska, and continued writing novels.&lt;ref name="Tomašević"/&gt; Young Polish widows at the time were expected to remarry, but Krajewska defied both the social norm and her parents' wishes.&lt;ref name="Lis"/&gt; She left Warsaw in 1883, travelled to Switzerland and enrolled in the [[University of Geneva]]. Krajewska first studied [[physiology]], becoming the first female teaching assistant in the university's history, and then took up medicine.&lt;ref name="Tomašević"/&gt; She was actively involved in the activities of the [[Polish diaspora]] in Switzerland, serving as the President of the Association of Polish Students.{{sfn|Fuchs|2011|p=78}}

Krajewska passed her final exams in 1891 and received an award for her [[doctoral dissertation]] the following year,&lt;ref name="Tomašević"/&gt; but found that she could not obtain the [[nostrification]] of her diploma or practice medicine in her homeland.&lt;ref name="Lis"/&gt; It thus did not take her much thought to respond to the notice of the [[Austro-Hungarian]] authorities, who were looking for female physicians to work in the newly occupied [[Condominium of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia and Herzegovina]].&lt;ref name="Tomašević"/&gt;

== Medical career ==

[[File:Administrativna podjela BiH 1895. godine (cropped).png|thumb|right|Austro-Hungarian districts of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Krajewska was first responsible for the towns in the district of Tuzla and then for those in the district of Sarajevo.]]
Teodora Krajewska was named the [[public health]] official (''Amtärztin'') of the District of [[Tuzla]] with the rank of [[captain]] by the decree of 28 November 1892.&lt;ref name="Tomašević"/&gt;{{sfn|Fuchs|2017|p=1}} In order to perform obstetric and gynecological procedures, she undertook training in a clinic in [[Vienna]]. Women could not study or practice medicine in Austria-Hungary at the time, but exceptions had to be made for Bosnia and Herzegovina, where Muslim women refused to be treated by male physicians. Krajewska was thus not only one of the [[first female physicians]] in Bosnia and Herzegovina but in Austria-Hungary as well.&lt;ref name="Tomašević"/&gt; Seven women in total were employed to treat Bosnian women; Krajewska was one of the three Russian citizens and one of the two ethnic Poles.{{sfn|Fuchs|2017|p=3}} Before assuming her office, Krajewska had to take Austro-Hungarian citizenship.{{sfn|Fuchs|2011|pp=77–78}} She succeeded [[Anna Bayerová]], a Czech, who had resigned shortly after her appointment due to frequent disagreements with her military superiors. Bayerová was unwilling to care predominantly for [[Bosnian Muslim]] women, as her superiors had expected, while Krajewska embraced the task.{{sfn|Fuchs|2017|p=5}}

Krajewska's arrival in Tuzla in March 1893 was announced by the town crier.&lt;ref name="Tomašević"/&gt; She was dismayed to find "these marvellous Slavic women covered by veils".{{sfn|Fuchs|2017|p=5}} Krajewska learned [[Serbo-Croatian]] quickly. She usually rode a [[Bosnian pony]] on her visits to remote mountain villages but had to travel by foot when the winters were too severe for the horse.&lt;ref name="Tomašević"/&gt; The demand for Krajewska's services was such that the Austro-Hungarian authorities soon employed [[Bohuslava Kecková]], another Pole, who took up post in [[Mostar]].&lt;ref name="Tomašević"/&gt; Speaking at the [[1896 International Congress of Women]] in [[Berlin]], Krajewska defended [[colonialism]] by arguing that Bosnians and Herzegovinians needed "civilization and progress from the outside", imposed "from above".{{sfn|Fuchs|2011|p=80}} The [[imperial feminism]] espoused by Krajewska was rejected by Austrian women's movements, which had a liberal outlook.{{sfn|Fuchs|2017|p=6}}

Krajewska was particularly interested in [[osteomalacia]]. She published a detailed article about it in 1900, claiming, on the basis of only 50 cases, that the disorder was [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] among Muslim women living in the mountains of Tuzla District.{{sfn|Fuchs|2011|p=80}} According to Krajewska, Christian women were never afflicted.{{sfn|Fuchs|2011|p=82}} She blamed "damp climate", "lack of sun", poverty, [[malnutrition]], and "Muslim customs" (chiefly [[child marriage]], seclusion, [[veiling]], excessive [[libido]] of Muslim men, overly frequent pregnancies, and prolonged breastfeeding) for the supposedly endemic osteomalacia.{{sfn|Fuchs|2011|p=81}}

In 1901, Krajewska was moved to [[Sarajevo]], with [[Jadwiga Olszewska]] replacing her in Tuzla.{{sfn|Fuchs|2011|p=78}} As the public health official of the District of Sarajevo, she regularly traveled to the towns of [[Foča]], [[Fojnica]], [[Goražde]], [[Vareš]], and [[Visoko]]. In addition to practicing medicine, Krajewska taught hygiene in several Sarajevo schools. While doing so, she met another teacher and writer, [[Jagoda Truhelka]], with whom she developed a close friendship.&lt;ref name="Tomašević"/&gt; She also formed friendships with native Bosnians, favoring [[Bosnian Croats|Croats]] but also including "progressive Muslims"; she disliked [[Bosnian Serbs|Serbs]] due to their perceived [[Russophilia]]. The backbone of her contacts, however, was formed by foreigners who had, like herself, flocked to Bosnia and Herzegovina during the [[Austro-Hungarian rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Austro-Hungarian rule]].&lt;ref name="Lis"/&gt;

== Retirement ==

The [[First World War]], triggered by the [[assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] several hundred meters away from Krajewska's home in Sarajevo in 1914, ended the Austro-Hungarian rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina. While the majority of the upper class [[Poles in Bosnia and Herzegovina]] moved to the newly established [[Second Polish Republic]], Krajewska stayed. Her eyesight deteriorated during the war due to [[cataracts]]; a [[cataract surgery|surgical intervention]] in [[Prague]] was unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="Tomašević"/&gt; By 1922, she had to retire.&lt;ref name="Lis"/&gt;

After years of living alone with her cat, Krajewska decided to leave "the country and the people she knew and loved". She returned to Warsaw, now capital of Poland, in 1927. She found that the city had changed immensely and she did not feel at home there anymore.&lt;ref name="Lis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tomašević"/&gt; She had been one of the best known and most respected people in Sarajevo, but only an anonymous old woman in Warsaw. With her sisters and their children living in [[southern Poland]] and her friends in Bosnia, Krajewska felt lonely and bitter.&lt;ref name="Lis"/&gt; Already frail and almost completely blind, she undertook a strenuous journey to see Bosnia for the last time before dying in Warsaw on 5 September 1935.&lt;ref name="Tomašević"/&gt;

== Diary ==

Krajewska left behind numerous reports and a detailed diary. In her old age, Krajewska entrusted these writings to her friend Zofia Grabowska. Krajewska's nephew, Zbigniew Danielak, edited her diary and had it published in Poland in 1989. The original manuscript is kept in the [[Ossolineum]]. Parts of it were translated into Serbo-Croatian by the Bosnian writer [[Marina Trumić]], who died before she could finish.&lt;ref name="Tomašević"/&gt;

Krajewska's detailed reports of her impressions of Muslim customs reflect the [[Orientalist stereotypes]] common in the era.{{sfn|Fuchs|2017|p=5}} She insisted that the Muslims of Bosnia and Herzegovina were less intelligent and less civilized than their Christian compatriots. Judging various nations and ethnicities by the progressiveness of their respective national movements, Krajewska classified Serbs as "extraordinarily intelligent", Croats as "average", and Bosnian Muslims as a "superfluous and foreign element". Reports of her colleagues in Bosnia and Herzegovina, including Bohuslava Kecková, contradicted Krajewska's writings and denied the correlation between religious affiliation and intelligence.{{sfn|Fuchs|2017|p=6}}

'''Thelarche''' {{IPAc-en|θ|ᵻ|ˈ|l|ɑːr|k|iː}} is the onset of secondary (postnatal) [[breast]] development,&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/thelarche Dictionary.com &gt; thelarche] Citing: 
*The American Heritage® Stedman's Medical Dictionary
Copyright © 2002, 2001, 1995
*Merriam-Webster's Medical Dictionary, © 2007&lt;/ref&gt; usually occurring at the beginning of [[puberty]] in girls. Its etymology is from Greek θηλή [tʰelḗ], “nipple” and ἀρχή [arkʰḗ], “beginning, onset”. Thelarche is usually noticed as a firm, tender lump directly under the centre of the [[nipple]] ([[wiktionary:papilla|papilla]] and [[areola]]). Thelarche is also referred to as a "breast bud", or more formally as [[Tanner stage]] 2 breast development (Tanner stage 1 being the entirely undeveloped prepubertal state). Thelarche may occur on one side first, or both sides simultaneously.

Thelarche is the first physical change of puberty in about 60 percent of girls, usually after 8 years of age. It is a result of rising levels of [[estradiol]]. It is typical for a woman's breasts to be unequal in size, particularly while the breasts are developing. Statistically it is slightly more common for the left breast to be the larger.&lt;ref name="asymmetry"&gt;{{cite journal

| journal=Annals of Plastic Surgery
| year=1989
| volume=22

| pmid=2729845
|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In rare cases, the breasts may be significantly different in size, or one breast may fail to develop entirely.

Although breast development can occur as a part of normal male puberty, it is termed [[gynecomastia]], and the term "thelarche" is not used with reference to male breast development.

When thelarche occurs at an unusually early age, it may be the first manifestation of [[precocious puberty]]. If no other changes of [[puberty]] or [[sex hormone]] effects occur, it is referred to as isolated [[premature thelarche]], and generally requires no treatment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9789">The '''Unified Victim Identification System''' ('''UVIS''') is an Internet-enabled database system developed for the [[Office of Chief Medical Examiner of the City of New York]] (OCME) in the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks]] on New York City and the crash of [[American Airlines Flight 587]].  It is intended to handle critical fatality management functions made necessary by a major disaster.&lt;ref&gt;City of New York Office of Chief Medical Examiner Pandemic Influenza Surge Plan To Manage In-Hospital Deaths Planning Tool&lt;/ref&gt;

In the event of a mass casualty event, it will initially be used by New York City's 311 call center operators, the New York Police Department, and OCME to gather key information to facilitate compiling an accurate list of missing persons.  UVIS will also be used by the OCME to track decedents and collect postmortem findings to facilitate the identification process after a disaster.  UVIS also contains a Pandemic Flu module to prepare against such an eventuality.

UVIS was built for the OCME by Trumbull, Connecticut-based consulting firm ICRA Sapphire Inc.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icrasapphire.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

Developed with public funds, UVIS is available to municipalities, counties, states, and other governmental agencies without charge, under license from New York City.

== Ante-Mortem Section ==

The Ante-Mortem Section relates to activities carried out before an individual is absolutely known to be deceased.  These include recording key information about the missing individual and managing interactions with the missing person's family members.

===Call Center module===

Mass casualty events generate numerous calls to government agencies: for example, the 2005 London subway bombing generated some 42,000 calls to the UK. Casualty Bureau call centers within the Bureau's first hour of operation.&lt;ref&gt;Report of the 7 July Review Committee (London Assembly)&lt;/ref&gt;  The Call Center module can handle tens of thousands of calls from individuals reporting or enquiring about missing persons, and record basic information about both the missing person and the caller.

===Missing Persons module===

The Missing Persons module enables NYPD Missing Persons detectives to conduct detailed interviews of family members, friends, and acquaintances of missing persons, and can store extremely detailed data ranging from clothing to physical characteristics such as eye and hair color to tattoo or scar information.

===Family Assistance Center module===

The UVIS Family Assistance Center module manages Family Assistance Centers (FACs), which are established to provide services to, and capture information from, the family and friends of injured, missing, or deceased disaster victims.  Services generally provided at a FAC include: grief counseling; childcare; religious support; facilitation of family needs such as hotel, food, and transportation; ante-mortem data collection by the investigative authorities and the medical examiner or coroner; and notification of death to the next of kin. The UVIS Family Assistance Center module tracks all interactions and appointments with the family of missing persons, and can manage the personal items of victims received from family members for identification purposes.

===Records module===

The Records modules handles requests for records from family members, lawyers, and public administrators, providing “Chain of Custody” for all records.

==Post-Mortem Section==
The Post-Mortem Section deals with human remains recovered from mass casualty sites.

===Field Operation module===

The Field Operations module can help users to manage incidents, field investigation, and the collection of remains and evidence, as well as maintaining records and documentation about remains and evidence.  Because internet connectivity will often be unavailable at disaster sites, the Field Operations module has a Microsoft Windows-based client version that can capture data off-line and synchronize with the main database when connectivity is available.

===Disaster Mortuary Management module===

The Disaster Mortuary Management module provides mortuary management functionality.  It supports the accessioning of remains, both check-in and check-out; the examination of remains by Medical Examiner and Anthropology; the tracking and documentation of autopsies and individual remains; and the final disposition of remains to funeral homes.

===Disaster Victim Identification module===

This module has bidirectional (from ante- to post-mortem and back) one-to-many search capabilities based on multiple criteria.  It possesses considerable identification tracking capabilities including DNA, fingerprint, radiology, and dental (see UDIM below).  The module enables identification review and verification, including DNA re-sampling.  It also enables the consolidation of fragmented remains as they are uncovered.

The Disaster Victim Identification module can conduct notification tracking, including communication both with family members and media about a given decedent.  It is capable of issuing death certification either when remains are found or not.  It also maintains a log of all family communications, and can schedule and track family visits.

===UVIS Dental Identification Module (UDIM) module===

A Forensic Odontology add-on, UDIM possesses detailed charting, complex and advanced search, and the ability to look for anomalies.

===Pandemic Influenza Module===
[[Pandemic influenza]] remains a serious threat.  The U.S. Health and Human Services Department forecasts that if a lethal flu pandemic strikes, deaths could range from 209,000 to 1.9 million.&lt;ref&gt;HHS Pandemic Influenza Plan- Part 1: Strategic Plan&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pan Flu.JPG||]]

If an influenza pandemic occurs, the magnitude of the event would demand a response from the NYC OCME to assist any governmental health care facilities as well as to support facilities in the private sector. Health care facilities which would be affected by a flu pandemic include public and private hospitals, nursing homes, retirement facilities, prison health clinics, public health clinics, and mental health hospitals.  During a flu pandemic causing mass fatalities, the limited morgues and decedent storage space at most health care facilities will be quickly overwhelmed.  The proposed solution consists of temporary morgues, known as Body Collection Points (BCPs), at health care facilities.  These would be either refrigerated [[Semi-trailer|18-wheel trailers]] or refrigerated [[CONEX container]]s.

The UVIS Pandemic Flu module enables health care facility morgue managers to administer BCPs, allowing them to:  
*Create a report for a set of remains, entering such information as the decedent’s medical history, usual residence, and next of kin, as well as report notes and the reporting physician’s information.  Creating a report automatically assigns a specimen number to the remains.
*Search for a decedent using the specimen number, last name, first name, and/or date of death.
*Check remains into or out of a BCP, storing them until they are ready to be released to a funeral home or funeral director.  Remains can also be moved from one BCP location to another.
*Browse through all BCPs at the health care facility to locate remains.
*Create a request for a BCP storage unit.
The Pandemic Flu module also enables medical examiner personnel to handle health care facilities’ requests for BCPs, managing the location and distribution of storage units at health care facilities, police precincts, or any other designated location.  If necessary, they can place a request on behalf of a facility. 
 
As well, Pandemic Flu module enables medical examiner personnel to create reports for decedents and to search for decedents using the specimen number, last name, first name, and/or date of death.  They can also track and record the progress of a decedent’s case.  Currently, the system tracks remains that are awaiting investigation, awaiting disposition, and transportation.  UVIS tracks time elapsed in each state and color-codes each record, giving an immediate visual indication of the status of each case.

NYC OCME personnel can also search the New York State Electronic Death Record System (EDRS) for decedents.

As part of UVIS, the Pandemic Influenza module’s data is available for search within the system.

===Administrative Section===
The Administrative Section allows users to create incidents, to which missing persons are attached; conduct records management; and carry out other system administration tasks.

===Technical Description===
UVIS is a multi-tiered, browser- and Windows-based application, written in Microsoft-based technology, and running on a minimum configuration of Microsoft Windows Server 2003 and Microsoft SQL 2000 / 2005 as the database engine.

'''Yerevan State Medical University after Mkhitar Heratsi ''' ('''YSMU''', {{lang-hy|Երեվանի Մխիթար Հերացու անվան Պետական Բժշկական Համալսարան}}), is the leading [[medical school|medical university]] in [[Armenia]]. It is located in the capital [[Yerevan]].

==History==
On 31 January 1920, during the [[First Republic of Armenia]], the [[Yerevan State University|People's University of Armenia]] opened in [[Gyumri|Alexandropol]], with the presence of prime minister [[Alexander Khatisian]] and minister of culture and public education [[Nikol Aghbalian]]. In October of the same year, a decision was passed by then-minister of education Gevorg Ghazarian to establish the faculty of medicine in the university. However, due to political circumstances, the plan was never fulfilled. Armenia became a republic in December 1920.

In 1920, the medical faculty of Yerevan was founded by the government of Armenia.

On 25 May 1989 Yerevan State Medical University was named after the 12th-century Armenian physician [[Mkhitar Heratsi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ysmu.am/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=517&amp;Itemid=84&amp;lang=am|title=Երևանի պետական բժշկական համալսարանի համառոտ պատմությունը|first=|last=Administrator|publisher=|accessdate=21 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
