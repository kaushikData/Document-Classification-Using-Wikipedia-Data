'''''ARMA: Queen's Gambit''''' (stylized as '''''A{{small|RM}}A: Queen's Gambit''''') is an [[expansion pack]] to ''[[ARMA: Armed Assault]]''. It was made by [[Bohemia Interactive]], the developer of the original game and [[Black Element Software]]. It contains new units, weapons, islands and campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.armaseries.cz/index1.php?site=static&amp;staticID=7|title=ARMA: Queen's Gambit &amp;#124; ARMAseries.cz - Arma 2, Arma 2: Operation Arrowhead, Arma 3|website=ARMAseries.cz|date=|accessdate=2013-08-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703233620/http://www.armaseries.cz/index1.php?site=static&amp;staticID=7|archive-date=3 July 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The first campaign "Rahmadi Conflict" is a follow-up to the original storyline. Player takes role of Leon Ortega who leads a [[Special Forces (United States Army)|U.S. Army Special Forces]] team. He is sent to nearby island of Rahmadi where the remaining of Sahrani Liberation Army is located and led by a mysterious leader, called "the President".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.databaze-her.cz/hry/arma-queens-gambit/ |title=ArmA: Queen´s Gambit – Databáze-her.cz |website=Databaze-her.cz |date=2012-07-25 |accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign consists of three missions and takes place on Rahmadi and a new island Porto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://games.tiscali.cz/recenze/armed-assault-queens-gambit-49302 |title=Armed Assault: Queens Gambit - GAMES.cz |website=Games.tiscali.cz |date=2007-11-14 |accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The other campaign, "Royal Flush", takes place on Sahrani a few years after the original storyline. The island is united, but the people from the northern part of the island together with the refugees from the south are dissatisfied with the monarchy which evolved into an oppressive regime. A group of [[Mercenary|mercenaries]] from Black Element [[private military company]] is hired by Sahrani queen Isabella who has taken the throne after a sudden death of her father, King Jose and her brother, Prince Orlando in a helicopter crash, causing a full scale-insurgency on the north. They are supposed to fight anti-government insurgents on North and to seize a stockpile of chemical weapons believed to be in possession of the rebels. Player takes role of Kurt Lambowski who is a member of the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Clare |first=Oliver |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/armed-assault-queens-gambit-review |title=Armed Assault: Queen's Gambit Review • Reviews • PC • |website=EuroGamer |date=2007-11-10 |accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zing.cz/special/953/bohemia-interactive-studio-ktere-zlepsilo-herni-prumysl-kapitola-ctvrta-arma-valceni-pro-novou-generaci |title=Speciál: Bohemia Interactive: Studio, které zlepšilo herní průmysl - Kapitola čtvrtá - Arma, válčení pro novou generaci |website=Zing.cz |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before arriving to Sahrani, Lambowski believes there is something fishy about the Queen who is unable to quell the insurgency despite having well-trained armed forces at hand. This proves true during the campaign as the team discovers that the Queen is a ruthless leader who runs a police state and puts the opponents to the concentration camps. Which is more - Prince Orlando is alive and leads the rebels. With these facts at hand, the team decides to help the rebels.

Depending on the player's decisions the Queen is either overthrown (killed or escapes) or she manages to get Prince Orlando killed, forcing the contractors to hastily leave the island and they are later branded as the rogue contractors.
The allegations about the involvement of Black Element company in a coup d'état is one of the reasons for a later [[rebranding]] of the company name to ION Services.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aan-online.com/en/europe/29-black-element-rebrand-corporate-image.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Afro Samurai''''' is a video game for the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]] video game consoles, loosely based on the [[manga]] and [[anime]] series [[Afro Samurai|of the same name]]. It was announced in the February 2008 issue of [[Play (US magazine)|''Play'' magazine]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.xbox360fanboy.com/2008/02/19/latest-anime-game-afro-samurai/| title= Latest Anime Game: Afro Samurai| publisher= Xbox 360 Fanboy| date= 2008-02-19| accessdate= 2008-02-20| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080221121404/http://www.xbox360fanboy.com/2008/02/19/latest-anime-game-afro-samurai/| archivedate= 2008-02-21| deadurl= yes| df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and released on January 27, 2009.&lt;ref name=Gamespot&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6195088.html|title= Afro Samurai Stalls to January 27 |date=2008-07-28|accessdate=2008-07-28|publisher=Gamespot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was developed by [[Namco Bandai Games]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=IGN: Afro Samurai by Namco Bandai| publisher=IGN |url=http://xbox360.ign.com/objects/944/944273.html| date=| accessdate=2008-06-30| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080517114807/http://xbox360.ign.com/objects/944/944273.html| archivedate= 17 May 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in North America, it was the first (and would end up being the only) game published under their western label, Surge. In Europe and Australia the game was released under the Namco brand instead and was distributed by [[Atari|Atari Europe]].

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Afro Samurai (screenshot).jpg|200px|thumb|left|''Afro Samurai'' features a cel-shaded animation style]]
''Afro Samurai'' is a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] brawler with platforming elements. Using light hits, power hits, kicks, and blocks the player fights various enemies. Most levels culminate in a boss fight, and in-engine cutscenes advance the story.

The game features a [[cel-shaded animation]] style. Though it is a [[hack and slash]] game, the "fighting is a bit more strategic" and the player is able to block and use combos. The enemies will respond by rolling, ducking and hopping over the player's blade and occasionally using body orifices to catch the weapons, the combat system was worked on by [[Monty Oum]].

==Plot==
{{main|Afro Samurai}}

It is said that the one who becomes "Number One" will rule the world, wielding powers akin to a god. Someone becomes Number One by killing the previous Number One and taking his ceremonial headband. However, only the "Number Two" is allowed to challenge the Number One. Because of this, few people ever reach the Number One because the Number Two headband is constantly changing owners. Afro's father was the old Number One, until he was brutally killed by a gunman named Justice, an event witnessed by Afro as a child. Now an adult, Afro Samurai is the current Number Two and a master [[swordsman]]; he travels the road seeking [[revenge]] on Justice. Lengthy [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]] interspersed throughout the story detail how Afro rose from frightened boy fleeing the death of his father, to master swordsman, and eventually to become the current "Number Two", while the story in the present deals with the adult Afro making his way to the mountain top keep of the "Number One" to duel Justice, while at the same time the mysterious cult known as the Empty Seven Clan sends various agents to kill Afro and take his Number Two headband. Ultimately, Afro discovers that Justice is already long dead, rendering his quest meaningless. After defeating a hallucination of Justice in single combat, Afro realizes that the headbands only bring pain and death and throws them into an abyss.

==Development==
===Voice acting===
All of the main characters are voiced by the same actors as in the anime. [[Mary Elizabeth McGlynn]] served as the voice director for the game.

===Music===
Hip hop producer [[RZA]] is credited as music director, but due to time constraints, he was unable to contribute fully. Instead he told the team how he went about scoring ''Afro Samurai'', and put them in contact with various individuals to assist them in delivering a sound similar to what he created for the anime. He did, however, send the team a couple of tracks to use in the game.

===Downloadable content===
The game's credits reveal that Namco Bandai commissioned a TV screenwriter, Peter Saji, to produce a storyline for a downloadable episode. In an interview, Saji admitted that multiple downloadable episodes are in production, but could not provide a release date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.gamecyte.com/?p=13647 | title="Afro Samurai" DLC Revealed by Credit Reel -- Will Span Multiple Episodes | publisher=GameCyte |accessdate=2009-02-10| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090309175333/http://www.gamecyte.com/afro-samurai-dlc-revealed-by-credit-reel-will-span-multiple-episodes| archivedate= 9 March 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''All Love Lost'' received universal acclaim from music critics. Kellen Miller of ''[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]'' said, "One becomes so engrossed in Budden’s hypnotic confession-as-art lyrical display of repeated drug relapses, depression and relationship drama that the music both forgives and transcends his past digressions."&lt;ref name="XXL"/&gt; Jesse Fairfax of [[HipHopDX]] said, "Joe Budden’s recorded therapy gives a voice to the lost, but despite his enormous lyrical ability, ''All Love Lost'' finds Joe making music as much for his own catharsis than connecting his laments to either other emotions inside him or the world at large."&lt;ref name="HipHopDX"/&gt;

The album debuted at number 29 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], selling 14,229 copies in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hernandez |first=Victoria |url=http://hiphopdx.com/news/id.36021/title.hip-hop-album-sales-the-game-machine-gun-kelly-joe-budden |title=Hip Hop Album Sales: The Game, Machine Gun Kelly &amp; Joe Budden |publisher=HipHopDX |date=2015-10-22 |accessdate=2015-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hindu thought, '''Anubhava''' or ''anubhavah'' ([[Sanskrit]]: अनुभव) refers to personal knowledge or aesthetic experience.

==Etymology==
The term ''anubhava'' or ''anubhavah'' ([[Sanskrit]]) is a compound of: 
* अनु ''anu'': 'after', 'afterwards', 'later on', 'in consequence of', 'being indicated by'; 
* भ(भु)व ''bhava'': 'causing', 'delighting' or 'experiencing'.

''Anubhava'' has a wide range of possible translations:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary|author=V.S.Apte|publisher=Digital Dictionaries of South Asia|page=11|url=http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?p.0:100.apte }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature |publisher=Sahitya Akademi|page=201|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=ObFCT5_taSgC&amp;pg=PA201&amp;dq=anubhava&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Fz_HVNWqEqLCmwXpiICQCg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=anubhava&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* अनुभव – 'direct perception or cognition', 'knowledge derived from personal observation or experiment, 'notion', 'apprehension', 'the impression on the mind not derived from memory', 'one of the kinds of knowledge', 'experience', 'understanding', 'result', 'consequence'; 
* अनुभवसिद्ध – 'established by experience'.

Several related words express the mental state which can be communicated to others or represented (अभिनय – 'acting'), either verbally or physically or emotionally, in one or different contexts:
* भाव ''bhāvah'': 'feeling', 'emotion', 'sentiment', 'temperament', 'mood'; 
* विभाव ''vibhāvah'': 'any condition which produces or develops a particular state of body or mind';  
* अनुभाव ''anubhāvah'': 'greatness', 'dignity', 'firm opinion or determination', 'an external manifestation or indication of a feeling by appropriate looks, gestures etc., called by some ensuant';
* अनुभू ''anubhū'': to enjoy, taste, experience or suffer; 
* अनुभूति ''anubhūti'': 'realization', self-realization'.

''Anubhāvas'' are not causes, but aesthetic experiences and important ingredients of [[Rasa (aesthetics)|Rasa]]. ''Anubhavah'' is not a sense-experience.

==Religion==

===Direct cognition===
''Anubhavah'' refers to poetic, narrative or ritual experience, enjoyment, relish or delight resulting, for the devotee or the seeker after truth, in the ecstatic experience of the divine; it is a means to understand during one’s own life-time the true nature of one’s own self which is the real nature of the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] by experiencing the sublime delight of the unity with the Supreme Self .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Contemporary Hinduism|author=P.Pratap Kumar|publisher=Routledge|page=220|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=7Wd_BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA220&amp;dq=anubhava&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5z_HVOLFFeihmQWS_IKoDg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=anubhava&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cognition is said to be of two kinds – ''[[Smriti|smrti]]'' ('reproductive') which is other than re-cognitive perception requiring disposition, and ''anubhavah'' ('productive') which involves a kind of awareness not derived from disposition alone. The difference between the waking state and the dreaming state becomes known through ''anubhava'' ('perception').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Classical Indian Philosophy of Mind|author=Kisor Kumar Chakrabarti|publisher=SUNY Press|pages=35, 43,|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=WxkcJd2X75oC&amp;pg=PA35&amp;dq=anubhava&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=L0THVJ6DOee2mAXhzYCADg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=anubhava&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advaita Vedanta===
The sage of the [[Mundaka Upanishad]] declares:
{{quote|sign=|source=|स यो ह् वै तत्परमं ब्रह्म वेद ब्रह्मैव भवति – "Verily he becomes Brahman, who knows Brahman. " –  ([[Mundaka Upanishad]] III.ii.9)}}

This is so because [[Brahman]] is of the nature of experience (''anubhuti'') and to have the ''anubhava'' of Brahman is to become Brahman, thus this revelation, a moment ago non-existing, is realized as existing eternally. ''Vijñānam'' is ''anubhava'', and ''anubhava'' is realization of the identity of the individual self and Brahman, which experience does not depend on any process, neither produced  by any process nor as an effect to any cause and is the highest state of development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Philosophy of Hindu Sadhana|author=Nalini kanta Brahma|publisher=PHI Learning|page=127,147|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=xPQjT7X8odMC&amp;pg=PA195&amp;dq=anubhava&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rUHHVLrrJKi0mwW_zoGYDg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=anubhava&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to the origination of things, [[Badarayana]] declares:
{{quote|जन्माद्यस्य यतः "That (is Brahman) from which (are derived) the birth etc., of this (universe)."  - ([[Brahma Sutras]] I.i.2)}}

[[Adi Shankara|Shankara]] holds ''anubhava'' to be a ''[[pramana]]'', an independent source of knowledge which is provided by contemplation (''[[nididhyasana]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Accomplishing the Accomplished|author=Anantanand Rambachan|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|page=14,|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=9FlsBa8FWlIC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;dq=anubhava&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Fz_HVNWqEqLCmwXpiICQCg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=anubhava&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his commentary on this ''[[sutra]]'' Shankara explains that a thing cannot be simultaneously judged to be existent and non-existent for the valid knowledge of the true nature of a thing does not depend on human notions and यतः ('' yatah'' ) ('that from which') in this ''sutra'' "is not meant to present an inference but speaks of a cause that is by nature eternal, pure, free and intrinsically omniscient" (which has to be experienced and felt).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Brahma Sutra Bhasya of Sankaracarya|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|page=17|url=https://www.amazon.in/Brahma-Sutra-Bhasya-Sankaracarya/dp/8175051051}}&lt;/ref&gt; The realization of the Supreme Word (''[[Shabda|śabda]]''), which is truth and reality, happens intuitively (a stage of ''[[pratibha]]''), and resembles Shankara’s concept of ''anubhava''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Being and Meaning|author=Sebastian Alackapally|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=100|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=liCLrmfnKSoC&amp;pg=PA100&amp;dq=anubhava&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=L0THVJ6DOee2mAXhzYCADg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=anubhava&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Padmapadacharya|Padmapada]] (fl. 8th century), a student of Shankara, in his ''Panchapādikā'', expounding [[Prabhākara]]’s view, explains that knowledge is ''anubhava'' i.e. the immediate experience, the resultant-cognition gained through valid means of knowledge when the subject and the object manifest and the self of the knower is known indirectly as "I".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Method of the Vedanta|author=Satchidanandendra Saraswati|page=419|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=ZMkbWhjE2M4C&amp;pg=PA419&amp;dq=anubhava&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZUbHVLHAA-HQmAX1nYHgBA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=anubhava&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; And, according to [[Abhinavagupta]], the very continuous and proper remembrance of the mantra (of a ritual) is the attainment of the condition in which the devout ''[[Upāsaka and Upāsikā|upāsaka]]'' as a routine has the continuous and direct ''anubhava'' ('experience') of the Self as no different from himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Triadic Heart of Siva|author=Paul Eduardo Muller-Ortega|publisher=SUNY Press|page=187|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=ObmRkyVbgDUC&amp;pg=PA187&amp;dq=anubhava&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZUbHVLHAA-HQmAX1nYHgBA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=anubhava&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swami Dayananda notes that ''anubhava'' has a more specific meaning than its conventional meaning of "experience", namely "direct knowledge". Dayananda explains that interpreting ''anubahva'' as "experience" may lead to a misunderstanding of Advaita Vedanta, and a mistaken rejection of the study of the scriptures as mere intellectual understanding. Stressing the meaning of ''anubhava'' as knowledge, Saraswati argues that liberation comes from knowledge, not from mere experience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://advaita-academy.org/Pages/PrintPost.aspx?PID=231 Advaita Academy, ''Experience versus knowledge – a brief look at samAdhi (Part 2 of 2) ''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203004634/http://advaita-academy.org/Pages/PrintPost.aspx?PID=231 |date=December 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Saraswati points out that "the experience of the self&amp;nbsp;... can never come because consciousness is ever-present, in and through each and every experience."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avgsatsang.org/hhpsds/pdf/Anubhava.pdf Swami Dayananda Saraswati, ''Anubhava'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neo-Vedanta===
According to [[Vivekananda]], ''anubhavah'' is the ground and source of all religious traditions, the infallible source of liberating knowledge, and the ultimate source of spiritual knowledge; however, he happens to distinguish between internal and external experience, between knowledge gained through words heard and own experience which he finds are not similar in nature and import.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Limits of scripture|author=Anantanand Rambachan|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|pages=9, 113, 133, 151|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=b9EJBQG3zqUC&amp;pg=PA94&amp;dq=anubhava&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=GUHHVKbvDITxmAXMuIKIDg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=anubhava&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Reza Shah-Kazemi]] ''anubhava'' is the immediate experience through which the transcendence of the Supreme Self beyond all limitations becomes known as one’s own self, then one realizes the real nature of one’s own self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Paths to Transcendence|author=Reza Shah-Kazemi|publisher=World Wisdom|page=28|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=UeEl4d2MhmYC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;dq=anubhava&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZUbHVLHAA-HQmAX1nYHgBA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=anubhava&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saiva Siddhanta===
[[Thayumanavar]], the 18th-century Tamil [[Saiva Siddhanta]] saint, the one who gains ''anubhava'' delights in the unitive experience (''advaita anubhava'') which is deep and intuitive, and the culmination of all experimental states of [[Vedanta]]; it is the ''svarupa-lakshana''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Harmony of Religions|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|pages=169, 106,123|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=uE4-veDrY7AC&amp;pg=PA169&amp;dq=anubhava&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=nEPHVN_mLqilmQW6o4CYDw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=anubhava&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Waking and dreaming===
In the waking state and in the dreaming state, ''samvedana'' (संवेदन) ('perception', 'act of perceiving or feeling', 'cognitive awareness') is two-folds – i) 'knowledge' and its ii) 'object'; in deep sleep state and ''[[turiya]]'' state, which states are not different from knowledge, ''anubhava'' ('experiencing awareness') is consciousness alone; the enlightened soul does not ever lose this experiencing awareness which event (''anubhava'') occurs no sooner the object is perceived and its existence is registered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Stanzas on Vibration|publisher=SUNY Press|pages=96, 165, 349|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=tM-y2WBYubcC&amp;pg=PA219&amp;dq=anubhava&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dUXHVOCCF4POmAWUhoDIBA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=anubhava&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anubhāvah (अनुभावः) and Indian aesthetics==

In poetry, prose and drama, emotions are indirectly communicated to the readers and audience via portrayal of certain aspects of emotion’s conditions and causes (''vibhāva'' consisting of ''alambana'' and ''uddipana''), exterior manifestations or consequences (''anubhāva'' which is ''vācika'', ''āngika'' or ''sāttvika'') and concomitant accompanying emotions (''sancāribhāva'') which method is called ''rasa'' ('relish') or ''dhvani'' and involves diction (''riti''), rhetoric (''alankāra'') and oblique expression (''vakrokti''), and is the finished product of sentiment (''sthāyibhāva''). ''Bhāva'' is emotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Critique of Poetics Vol.1|author=A.R.Biswas|page=17,45,|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=Hc3wNPJhD9IC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq=anubhava&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5z_HVOLFFeihmQWS_IKoDg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=anubhava&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mystic poetry is known as ''Anubhāvakāvya''. [[D. R. Bendre|Bendre]], who started the cultural movement ''nada-habba'', considers mystic experience as an extension of ''anubhava'', and ''anubhava'' leads to ''anubhāva'' – ''Bhāva'' -&gt; ''Anubhava'' -&gt; ''Bhāva'' -&gt; ''Anubhāva''. In his poem, ''Sanna Somavara'' as a poetic composition is seen the transformation of ''bhāva'' into ''anubhava'' and back to ''bhāva''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dattatreya Ramachandra Bendre|author=G.S.Amur|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|pages=95, 97|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=QaSWBH68NQYC&amp;pg=PA95&amp;dq=anubhava&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5z_HVOLFFeihmQWS_IKoDg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=anubhava&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are eight different and distinct ''rasa'' or 'sentiments' – 'erotic', 'comic', 'pathetic', 'furious', 'heroic', 'terrible', 'odious', and 'marvellous', to which ''rasa'' is also added ''śānta rasa''. Bharata states that ''rasa'' is the soul of poetry. The ''[[vedic]]'' meaning of ''rasa'' is 'liquid' or 'flavour'; for [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]], ''rasa'' signifies the intrinsic and spiritual non-material bliss. [[Natya Shastra]] (St.109) explains that ''rasa'' is produced from a combination of determinants (''vibhāva''), consequents or histrionic representations (''anubhāva'') and any of the thirty-three transitory states (''vyabhicāribhāva''), according to which text, 'love', 'mirth', 'sorrow', 'anger', 'energy', 'terror', 'disgust' and 'astonishment' are the eight dominant states or ''sthāyibhāva''; 'paralysis', 'perspiration', 'horripilation', 'change of voice', 'trembling', 'change of colour', 'weeping' and 'fainting' are the eight temperamental states or ''sattvikabhāva'', and emphasizes on histrionic representation or ''abhinaya'' of the ''anubhāva'' presented by the characters developed by the playwright. [[Abhinavagupta]] states that ''śānta rasa'', also a ''sthāyibhāva'', leads to ''[[moksha]]'', for it is the very experience of pure consciousness; ''vibhāva'' also means 'pure consciousness' and ''anubhāva'' also means the experience arising from pure consciousness. ''Rasa'' is an experience of pure consciousness brought about by the aesthetic contents, impressions and stimuli for the mind, the intellect and the emotions; ''vibhāva'' causes a specific emotional state to cause an ''anubhāva'' (effect)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Theatre and Consciousness|author=Daniel Meyer-Dinkgrafe|publisher=Intellect Books|page=|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=zGy0UglRz6IC&amp;pg=PT80&amp;dq=anubhava&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5z_HVOLFFeihmQWS_IKoDg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=anubhava&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is defined as means of histrionic representation. The experience of ''rasa'' is the experience of the different levels of perception corresponding to the different transitory mental states,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=restoration of Breath|author=Sreenath Nair|publisher=Rodopi|page=|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=8OurFVARfq0C&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq=anubhava&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rUHHVLrrJKi0mwW_zoGYDg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=anubhava&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''sāttvika-bhāvas'', for example,  are involuntary and uncontrollable physical responses produced from certain mental states. Bhatta Lolatta states that ''rasa'' is intensified ''sthāyibhāva'' located in the character (''anukārya'') and the actor (''anukartā'') by virtue of the power of identification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Bhaktirasamrtasindhu|author=Rupa Goswami|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=xxxvii, xliv|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=DsRb6gjUa1oC&amp;pg=PR37&amp;dq=anubhava&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=L0THVJ6DOee2mAXhzYCADg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=anubhava&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arne Arnardo''' (12 October 1912 – 4 May 1995), born '''Arne Otto Lorang Andersen''', was a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[circus]] performer and -owner, generally referred to as the "circus king" of Norway.&lt;ref name="NRK"/&gt; He escaped with the circus at an early age, took the stage name "Arnardo", and developed proficiency in several different acts. In 1949, he opened his own circus, under the name of Cirkus Arnardo.

==Biography==
Arnardo was born in [[Sarpsborg]], the son of lumberjack Einar Andersen and his wife Elna.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; He was interested in the entertainment industry from an early age, and escaped with Cirkus Empress as a teenager.&lt;ref name="NRK"/&gt; Here he worked as a [[contortion]]ist, [[Magic (illusion)|illusionist]] and [[Acrobatics|acrobat]].&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; In 1927, he took the stage name "Arnardo", under which he was invariably known since. He also performed as  an [[Equilibristics|equilibrist]], [[trapeze]] artist, [[Hypnosis|hypnotist]] and [[Ventriloquism|ventriloquist]].&lt;ref name="NRK"/&gt; In 1939 he became director of Cirkus Berny, before he was finally able to open his own circus in 1949 – under the name Cirkus Arnardo.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; Through a keen sense for [[public relations]], Arnardo built the brand of his circus to become the best-known in Norway.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; He died in his caravan during a show in [[Tøyen]], [[Oslo]], in 1995.&lt;ref name="NRK"/&gt;

==Works and honours==
Arnardo played in the movie ''[[Cirkus Fandango]]'' in 1954, and authored the autobiography ''Sirkusliv'' (''Circus Life'') in 1962.&lt;ref name=snl/&gt; In 1973 he received the [[King's Medal of Merit]] in gold, and he was made Knight, First Class, of the [[Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav]] 1988.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; He was married twice; to Gerd Gløgaard and Eva Sørensen, née Steene.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; After Arne Arnardo's death, his son Arild took over the role as director of Cirkus Arnardo.&lt;ref name=CA/&gt;

'''''Atari Games Corp. v. Oman''''' is court case dealing with the [[copyright law|copyright status]] of a [[video game]]. [[Breakout (video game)|''Breakout'']] is a paddle and ball video game created by the plaintiff, [[Atari Games Corporation]], which was released in 1976. Eleven years later, in 1987, the plaintiff sought registration for the work with the [[US Copyright Office]]. On February 13, 1987 and again on May 22, 1987, Copyright Registrar Ralph Oman refused to register the work because it "did not contain at least a minimum amount of original pictorial or graphic authorship, or authorship in sounds".&lt;ref name="trial"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Atari Games Corp. v. Oman |vol=693 |reporter=F. Supp. |opinion=1204 |court=Dist Ct DC |date=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atari challenged Oman's use of discretion not to award the game copyright protection.&lt;ref name="trial" /&gt;

==Prior history==
Justice John H. Pratt of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, deferred to the Registrar and granted summary judgment for the defendant. He noted that "It is simply not the case, in short, that video games are ''per se'' copyrightable, or by definition more expressive and creative than other mediums."&lt;ref name="trial" /&gt;

==Opinion of the court==
Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]], sitting on the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]], reversed the decision of the trial court and held that ''Breakout'' was a copyrightable work.&lt;ref name="appeal"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Atari Games Corp. v. Oman |vol=979 |reporter=F. (2d) |opinion=242 |court=Cir DC |date=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order for a work to be copyrightable, it must be fixed.&lt;ref name="copyright act"&gt;{{usc|17|102}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also must possess a requisite level of creativity. The standard for creativity that was applied is outlined in ''[[Feist v. Rural]]'' as "extremely low; even a slight amount will suffice". Because breakout consists of a series of shapes and images in a particular sequence alongside audio, the court found it met the requisite level of copyright.&lt;ref name="appeal" /&gt;

==Importance of the case==
This case stands as a precedent that a video game can attract the protection of copyright. Although ''Breakout'' is a simple game considering modern standards, the law remains applicable to today's highly advanced titles.

'''''Batman: The Killing Joke''''' is a 1988 [[DC Comics]] [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] [[graphic novel]] featuring the characters [[Batman]] and the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] written by [[Alan Moore]] and illustrated by [[Brian Bolland]]. ''The Killing Joke'' provides an origin story for the supervillain the Joker, loosely adapted from the 1951 story arc "[[The Man Behind the Red Hood!]]". The Joker's origin is presented via flashback, while simultaneously depicting his attempt to drive [[James Gordon (comics)|Jim Gordon]] insane and Batman's desperate attempt to stop him.

Created by Moore and Bolland as their own take on the Joker's source and psychology,&lt;ref name="Will"/&gt; the story became famous for its origin of the Joker as a tragic character; a family man and failed comedian who suffered "one bad day" that finally drove him insane. Moore stated that he attempted to show the similarities and contrasts between the two characters. The story's effects on the mainstream Batman continuity also included the shooting and [[paralysis]] of [[Barbara Gordon]] (a.k.a. [[Batgirl]]), an event that laid the groundwork for her to develop the identity of [[Barbara Gordon#Suicide Squad, Birds of Prey and other appearances (1989–2011)|Oracle]].

Many critics consider the graphic novel to be the definitive Joker story and one of the best Batman stories ever published. The comic won the [[List of Eisner Award winners#Best Graphic Album|Eisner Award]] for 'Best Graphic Album' in 1989 and appeared on [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller List]] in May 2009. In 2006, ''The Killing Joke'' was reprinted as part of the trade paperback ''[[DC Universe: The Stories of Alan Moore]]''. In 2008, DC Comics reprinted the story in a deluxe hardcover edition, which features new coloring by Bolland, with a more somber, realistic, and subdued palette than the original. Elements of ''The Killing Joke'' have inspired or been incorporated into other aspects of Batman media.

==Background and creation==
Artist [[Brian Bolland]]'s version of the Joker stemmed in part from his having recently seen the film ''[[The Man Who Laughs (1928 film)|The Man Who Laughs]]''.&lt;ref name="ABB195"&gt;Bolland, "The 1980's - The Killing Joke" in ''The Art of Brian Bolland'', pp.&amp;nbsp;195–197&lt;/ref&gt; Giordano's invitation led directly to Bolland working with writer Alan Moore to create a plausible background story for the Joker. He recounted, "I thought about it in terms of who's my favorite writer at the moment, what hero I would really love to do, and which villain? I basically came up with Alan, Batman and the Joker".&lt;ref name="Art"&gt;Salisbury, Mark, ''Artists on Comic Art'' ([[Titan Books]], 2000) {{ISBN|1-84023-186-6}}, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the story takes pains to stress that it is merely one possible "[[origin story]]", it has been widely accepted and adopted into DC continuity, and a central mutilation of a [[Barbara Gordon|long-running character]] had to be specially approved by editor Wein.&lt;ref name="ABB195"/&gt; Bolland said that he saw "[[Judge Death]] [as] almost a dry run for drawing the Joker". He also recounted that "by the time Alan had finished ''[[Watchmen]]'' he had fallen out with DC to a certain extent&amp;nbsp;... in the end, he only continued to do ''Killing Joke'' as a favor to me".&lt;ref name="Art"/&gt;

The 48-page [[prestige format]] one-shot comic took a considerable amount of time to produce. Both Moore and Bolland are well known for their meticulous and time-consuming work; both creators' then-recently finished 12-issue maxiseries titles – Moore's ''Watchmen'' and Bolland's ''[[Camelot 3000]]'' – had seen delays.&lt;ref name="Will"&gt;Will Brooker, ''Batman Unmasked: Analyzing a Cultural Icon'' (Bloomsbury Academic September 18, 2001) pp. 268-272. {{ISBN|978-0826413437}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was aided by the laidback attitude taken by DC, who he says "seemed prepared to let me do it at my own pace". The original editor, [[Len Wein]], left the company, and was replaced by [[Dennis O'Neil]], a "very hands-off sort of guy", with whom Bolland only recalls having one conversation about the book.&lt;ref name="Art"/&gt;

Bolland envisaged the [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] sequences in black and white, and instructed ''Watchmen'' colorist [[John Higgins (comics)|John Higgins]] to use "muted November colors". He was upset when he saw the finished comic had "garish&amp;nbsp;... hideous glowing purples and pinks&amp;nbsp;... and my precious ''[[Eraserhead]]''-esque flashback sequences swamped in orange".&lt;ref name="ABB195"/&gt; The 2008-published 20th anniversary edition of the book featured new colouring by Bolland, restoring his artistic intentions to the palette.

The story is referred to in a flashback scene in the [[DC Universe Animated Original Movies]], ''[[Batman: Under the Red Hood]]''. In the movie, [[Red Hood]] lures Batman to the chemical factory where the Joker's accident took place. Batman remembers the events like in the comic, where a fleeing Joker had attempted to escape while trying to claim that he was set up but accidentally fell into the toxic waste and disfigured him. Red Hood calls it Batman's greatest failure. Jason Todd also refers to Joker crippling Barbara.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://io9.com/5601910/batman-under-the-red-hood-tosses-the-comics-baggage-to-reveal-the-dark-side-of-the-bat-legacy|title=Under the Red Hood cuts through Batman's baggage to reveal the dark side of his legacy|publisher=io9.com|author=Alasdair Wilkins}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==
[[File:Jokerorig.png|thumb|left|Joker, before his accident, with his pregnant wife; art by Brian Bolland and John Higgins]]
The man who will become the Joker is an unnamed engineer who quits his job at a chemical company to become a [[stand-up comedy|stand-up comedian]], only to fail miserably. Desperate to support his pregnant wife Jeannie, he agrees to guide two criminals through the chemical plant where he previously worked so that they can rob the [[playing card]] company next to it. During the planning, the police inform him that his wife has died in a household accident. Grief-stricken, the engineer tries to withdraw from the plan, but the criminals strong-arm him into keeping his commitment to them.

At the plant, the criminals make him don a special mask to become the infamous [[Red Hood]]. As previously told to the engineer by the criminals, they use this disguise to implicate any accomplice as the mastermind and to divert attention away from themselves. Once inside, they encounter security personnel, a shootout ensues, and the two criminals are killed. The engineer is confronted by Batman who is investigating the disturbance.

Terrified, the engineer jumps into the chemical plant's waste [[Lock (water transport)#Pound lock|pound lock]] to escape Batman and is swept through a pipe leading to the outside. Once outside, he discovers to his horror that the chemicals have permanently bleached his skin chalk-white, stained his lips ruby-red and dyed his hair bright green. The engineer's disfigurement, compounded with the loss of his family, drives him completely insane and marks the birth of the Joker.

[[File:Jokerkillingjoke.png|thumb|right|The Joker, after emerging from the canal of chemical waste]]
In the present day, Batman goes to [[Arkham Asylum]] to talk with the Joker about ending their years-long feud, only to realize that the Joker has escaped and put a decoy in his place. Soon after, the Joker shoots [[Barbara Gordon]] in the stomach, paralyzing her, and kidnaps her father, [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner James Gordon]]. The Joker imprisons Gordon in a run-down [[amusement park]]. His henchmen then beat Gordon and cage him in the park's [[freak show]]. It is implied but not explicitly said that the Joker gives Gordon LSD to continue his mental torture. The Joker chains Gordon to one of the park's rides and forces him to view giant photos of Barbara, lying down naked, bloodied, and in pain. Once Gordon has run the horrifying gauntlet, the Joker puts him on display in the freak show, ridiculing him as "the average man", a naïve weakling doomed to insanity.

Batman's attempts to locate Commissioner Gordon are unsuccessful until the Joker sends him an "invitation" that leads him to the amusement park. Batman arrives to save Gordon, and the Joker retreats into the [[funhouse]]. Though [[psychological trauma|traumatized]] by the ordeal, Gordon retains his sanity and moral code, and he insists that Batman capture the Joker "by the book" in order to "show him that our way works". Batman enters the funhouse and dodges the Joker's booby traps, while the Joker tries to persuade his nemesis that the world is "a black, awful joke" that is not worth fighting for, and that it only takes "one bad day" to drive an ordinary man insane.

Batman subdues the Joker and tells him that Gordon survived the Joker's torments, and suggests that the Joker is alone in his madness. He attempts to reach out to the Joker and offers to help him recover in order to end their everlasting war, which Batman fears may one day result in a fight to the death. The Joker declines, saying it is "too late for that. Far too late". He then says that this situation reminds him of a joke about two inmates in a lunatic asylum who try to escape. One inmate jumps across a narrow gap between the asylum and the adjoining building, but the other is afraid he will fall. The first inmate offers to shine his flashlight across the gap so the other can walk across it, but the second inmate replies, "What do you think I am, crazy? You'd turn it off when I was halfway across!" Batman chuckles at the punchline, and the two old foes laugh as the police arrive.

From the text itself, the ending is ambiguous:&lt;ref&gt;Darius,Julian (August 22, 2013). [http://sequart.org/magazine/29540/on-interpreting-the-killing-jokes-ending-and-authorial-intent/ "On Interpreting The Killing Joke’s Ending (and Authorial Intent)"]&lt;/ref&gt; according to one view, Batman breaks the Joker's neck out of panel, causing the laughter to stop abruptly. Some people theorise that the title, "The Killing Joke", is in reference to the ending scene, in which The Joker and Batman laugh, over a joke, thus triggering Batman to kill the Joker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wQ2x0OKBjU&amp;feature=youtu.be|title=Grant Morrison on The Killing Joke|first=|last=Jordan Gibson|date=15 August 2013|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to another view, Batman and the Joker, who have been fighting for years, end all of their disputes by having a good laugh about it all.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Scott (August 17, 2013). [http://comicbook.com/blog/2013/08/17/the-killing-joke-script-proves-batman-didnt-kill-the-joker/ "The Killing Joke Script Proves Batman Didn't Kill The Joker"]. Comicbook.com.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crump, Andy (February 16, 2014). [http://screenrant.com/the-killing-joke-batman-killed-joker-grant-morrison/ "Did Batman Kill The Joker at the End of 'The Killing Joke'?"]. Screen Rant.&lt;/ref&gt; Still another theory maintains that the first and last panels of the book are both purposely of rain falling on the ground, which symbolizes that nothing has changed except for the two parties' respect for each other.

Though many people, fans and critics alike, have debated each of these theories, the ending was purposely left uncertain to allow each individual reader to decide what happened.

==Themes and analysis==
The book explores Moore's assertion that, psychologically, "Batman and the Joker are mirror images of each other"&lt;ref name="cbr"&gt;Stone, Brad (October 22, 2001). [http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=511 "Alan Moore Interview"]. [[Comic Book Resources]]&lt;/ref&gt; by delving into the relationship between the two. The story itself shows how the Joker and Batman came to terms with their respective life-altering tragedies, which both eventually lead to their present lives and confrontation. Critic Geoff Klock further explained that "both Batman and the Joker are creations of a random and tragic 'one bad day'. Batman spends his life forging meaning from the random tragedy, whereas the Joker reflects the absurdity of life, and all its random injustice".&lt;ref&gt;Geoff Klock, ''How to Read Superhero Comics and Why'' (New York: Continuum, 2002) 52-53. {{ISBN|0-8264-1419-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The torments that the Joker puts Commissioner Gordon through are meant to serve as "proof that there is something buried deep within each lunatic, a nugget of insanity, that is simply waiting for the right moment to spring forth".&lt;ref name="Hilary"/&gt; Unlike the Joker, however, Gordon emerges from his ordeal with his sanity and moral code intact. The story is also famous for changing how the [[Modern Age of Comics]] perceived Batman comics by bringing it back to its darker roots.&lt;ref&gt;[[Les Daniels|Daniels, Les]]. ''Batman: The Complete History''. Chronicle Books, 1999. pp. 163-164, {{ISBN|978-0-8118-2470-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The comic book, however, delves deeper in order to present Batman's own psychology—that he is, in his own way, just as insane as the Joker, and that he and the Joker perceive the world according to differing points of view, with the Joker's interpreted through a joke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comicsbeat.com/the-killing-joke-ending-revealed/|title=The Killing Joke ending revealed?|publisher=''Comics Beat''|author=Zainab Akhtar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Joker serves as an [[unreliable narrator]]. He admits to his own uncertainty, as he has disparate memories of the single event ("Sometimes I remember it one way, sometimes another&amp;nbsp;... If I'm going to have a past, I prefer it to be multiple choice!"), accentuating the comic's depiction of "a world unraveling toward relentless urban violence and moral nihilism&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref&gt;David Leverenz, "The Last Real Man in America: From Natty Bumppo to Batman," ''The "American Literary History" Reader'', ed.

==Critical reception and legacy==
Although a one-shot, the events of ''The Killing Joke'' were adopted into ongoing comic book storylines. DC Comics officially retired Batgirl in the one-shot comic ''Batgirl Special'' #1 (July 1988),&lt;ref name="Batgirl Special #1"&gt;{{cite book |last= Randall |first= Barbara |authorlink= |title= ''Batgirl Special'' #1 |year= 1988 |publisher= DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt; and when Barbara Gordon reappeared in the ''[[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]]'' series, she was in a wheelchair and became the computer hacker [[Barbara Gordon#Oracle (1989–present)|Oracle]] (this series was later adapted into a [[Birds of Prey (TV series)|TV series of the same title]]). This event, along with a Batman storyline that takes place shortly afterward, ''[[Batman: A Death in the Family]]'', involving the Joker murdering [[Robin (comics)#Jason Todd|Robin]] ([[Jason Todd]]), ''The Killing Joke'', leads Batman's obsession with the Clown Prince of Crime to a personal level. The mantle of Batgirl would eventually be passed to successor [[Cassandra Cain]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|writer=[[Greg Rucka]]|penciller=[[Mike Deodato]]|inker=Sean Parsons|title=[[Legends of the Dark Knight]]|story=No Man's Land: Assembly|issue=120|date=August 1999|publisher=DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later, [[Stephanie Brown (comics)|Stephanie Brown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|writer=[[Bryan Q.

The graphic novel won the [[Eisner Award]] for Best Graphic Album and garnered Alan Moore the Best Writer award in 1989. Hilary Goldstein of [[IGN]] Comics praised ''The Killing Joke'', calling it "easily the greatest Joker story ever told" and adding that "Moore's rhythmic dialogue and Bolland's organic art create a unique story often mimicked but never matched".&lt;ref name="Hilary"&gt;[http://comics.ign.com/articles/618/618658p1.html ''Batman: The Killing Joke'' Review], IGN, May 24, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; IGN declared ''The Killing Joke'' the third-greatest Batman graphic novel, after ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'' and ''[[Batman: Year One]].''&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Hilary (June 13, 2005).

Andy Shaw of ''Grovel'' had a more lukewarm response to ''The Killing Joke'', saying that though "wonderfully executed", it "suffer[s] from its reliance on the rules of the superhero story".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grovel.org.uk/batman-the-killing-joke/|title=''Batman: The Killing Joke'' review|publisher=''Grovel''|author=Andy Shaw}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seb Patrick of ''Den of Geek'' also had a mixed response, calling ''The Killing Joke'' "one of the most revered and influential 'Batman' stories ever written and arguably the definitive Joker story", but adding that it's "not at the level of [Alan Moore's] true masterpieces [such as] ''[[Watchmen]]'', ''[[V for Vendetta]]'' [and] ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]''".&lt;ref name="denofgeek"&gt;[http://www.denofgeek.com/comics/42346/batman_the_killing_joke_deluxe_edition_review.html Title], Seb Patrick, Den of Geek, 28 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creator's response===
In a 2000 interview, Moore said: "I don't think it's a very good book. It's not saying anything very interesting".&lt;ref&gt;Kavanagh, Barry (October 17, 2000). [http://www.blather.net/articles/amoore/brought-to-light1.html "The Alan Moore Interview: The Killing Joke and Brought to Light"]. Blather.net.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, he elaborated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''The Killing Joke'' is a story about Batman and the Joker; it isn't about anything that you're ever going to encounter in real life, because Batman and the Joker are not like any human beings that have ever lived. So there's no important human information being imparted ... Yeah, it was something that I thought was clumsy, misjudged and had no real human importance. It was just about a couple of licensed DC characters that didn't really relate to the real world in any way.&lt;ref&gt;George Khoury, ed., ''The Extraordinary Works of Alan Moore'' (Raleigh: TwoMorrows, 2003) 123. {{ISBN|1-893905-24-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a 2006 interview with ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' magazine, Moore was also critical about his decision to cripple Barbara Gordon: "I asked DC if they had any problem with me crippling Barbara Gordon - who was Batgirl at the time - and if I remember, I spoke to [[Len Wein]], who was our editor on the project&amp;nbsp;... [He] said, 'Yeah, okay, cripple the bitch'. It was probably one of the areas where they should've reined me in, but they didn't".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lonelygods.com/w/bat4.html "No Place For a Girl: Batman Comics of the 1980s"]. Lonely Gods. Retrieved July 30, 2012. {{dead link|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the introduction to the story as it appears in the ''DC Universe: The Stories of Alan Moore'' trade paperback, Brian Bolland disputes the widely held belief that the story started as a ''Batman'' annual story and ended up as a prestige-format book. Bolland recalls that the idea for a one-off ''Batman'' story focusing on the Joker—with Batman more of an incidental character—was his. Bolland says that in 1984, DC editor [[Dick Giordano]] told him he could do any project for DC he wanted, and Bolland requested to do a Batman/Joker prestige book with Moore as writer. Bolland has also expressed dissatisfaction with the final book, and regrets that its impending schedule for release meant he could not color the book himself (John Higgins was the colorist). Bolland says that "the end result wasn't quite what I'd hoped. I don't think it rates with some of the highlights of Alan's career".&lt;ref&gt;Brian Bolland, "On Batman: Brian Bolland Recalls ''The Killing Joke''," ''DC Universe: The Stories of Alan Moore'' (New York: DC Comics, 2006) 256. {{ISBN|1-4012-0927-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; March 2008 saw the release of the artwork as Bolland intended it: the twentieth anniversary hardcover edition of ''The Killing Joke'' is completely recolored by Bolland himself. The book made [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]] in May 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/22/graphic-books-best-seller-list-may-16/ "Graphic Books Best Seller List: May 16" ''[[The New York Times]]''; George Gene Gustines. May 22, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influence on Joker stories===
Critic Mark Vogler wrote that ''The Killing Joke'' provided the Joker "with a sympathetic back story as it presented some of the villain's most vile offenses".&lt;ref&gt;Mark Voger. ''The Dark Age: Grim, Great and Gimmicky Post-Modern Comics'' (Raleigh: TwoMorrows, 2006) 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Moore's rendition of the Joker's origin employs elements of the 1951 story "The Man Behind the Red Hood" (''[[Detective Comics]]'' #168), which established the concept of the Joker originally having been a thief known only as the [[Red Hood]]. The tragic and human elements of the character's story, coupled with his barbaric crimes as the Joker, portray the character as more of a three-dimensional human being. During an interview with ''Salon'', Moore explained that Joker's psychotic nature could have been caused by a "bad decision" in his life.&lt;ref name="Will"/&gt;

Much of the Joker's backstory from ''The Killing Joke'' is also referenced in 2004's "Pushback" (''[[Batman: Gotham Knights]]'' #50-55; reprinted with #66 as ''Batman: Hush Returns''), in which the events are observed and reported by the [[Riddler]], who recounts that the pregnant wife of the pre-accident Joker, who is called "Jack" prior to his accident, was kidnapped and murdered by the criminals in order to force his compliance.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman: Gotham Knights'' #52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Batman: Gotham Knights'' #53&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feminist interpretations===
The book has been the subject of feminist critique, criticizing the treatment of Barbara Gordon. Author Brian Cronin notes that "[many] readers felt the violence towards Barbara Gordon was too much, and even Moore, in retrospect, has expressed his displeasure with how the story turned out".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Brian Cronin|title=Was Superman A Spy?: And Other Comic Book Legends Revealed|publisher=Penguin|year=2009|page=47|isbn=9780452295322}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author Sharon Packer wrote: "Anyone who feels that feminist critics overreacted to [Gordon's] accident is advised to consult the source material&amp;nbsp;... Moore's ''The Killing Joke'' is sadistic to the core. It shows Gordon stripped and mutilated, with before, during and after photos of the attack displayed before her bound and gagged father, the police commissioner. She is more than merely disabled".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Sharon Packer|title=Superheroes and Superegos: Analyzing the Minds Behind the Masks|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2010|page=201|isbn=9780313355363}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gail Simone]] included the character's paralysis in a list of "major female characters that had been killed, mutilated, and depowered", dubbing the phenomenon "[[Women in Refrigerators]]" in reference to a 1994 [[Green Lantern]] story where the title character discovers his girlfriend's mutilated body in his refrigerator. Author Jeffrey A. Brown noted ''The Killing Joke'' as an example of the "relatively unequal violence [female characters] are subjected to" in the major DC/Marvel comics industry. While male characters may be critically injured or killed, they are more than likely to be returned to their original conception, while "women on the other hand, are more likely to be casually, but irreparably, wounded such as when Barbara Gordon's (the original Batgirl) spine was shattered by the Joker just for fun and has been restricted to a wheelchair for over a decade now".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Jeffrey A. Brown|title=Dangerous Curves: Action Heroines, Gender, Fetishism, and Popular Culture|publisher=[[University Press of Mississippi]]|year=2011|page=175|isbn=9781604737141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="No Joke"===
In 2007, [[Geoff Johns]] wrote a companion story to ''The Killing Joke'' entitled "No Joke" that appeared in the series ''[[Booster Gold (comic book)|Booster Gold]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Geoff Johns|title=Booster Gold #5|publisher=DC Comics|year=2008|page=|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the story, [[Booster Gold]] is charged by [[Rip Hunter]] to go back in time and save Barbara from being shot by the Joker. Booster arrives at the carnival shortly after the Joker has rounded up the freaks, only to be attacked by them. He manages to escape, but arrives too late to save Barbara. Catching the Joker in the middle of taking photos of the wounded Barbara, Booster attacks the Joker in a rage; the Joker nevertheless gains the upper hand, snapping several photos of Booster as well. Rip returns Booster to the future before Joker can murder him, but Booster demands to be sent back again. Booster fails several times until Rip reveals that the Joker is destined to paralyze her, as it would ensure that she would become Oracle. Rip did this to demonstrate to Booster that some points in time, like Barbara's paralysis, are fixed and cannot be prevented or altered, so that Booster would not continue insisting on rescuing his friend [[Ted Kord]] from death, another fixed point. The story also reveals that Batman kept the photos of Barbara and Booster, and had been waiting until Booster came of age before confronting him. Batman thanks Booster for trying to stop the Joker and offers him his friendship. Eventually, [[Dick Grayson]], who becomes his mentor's temporary successor as Batman, would also learn about this and offer his thanks as well.

==="Ladies' Night"===
In 2010, writer [[J. Michael Straczynski]] and artist [[Cliff Chiang]] collaborated on a one-shot story called "Ladies' Night", which was published in the anthology series ''[[The Brave and the Bold]]''. The story is set shortly before ''The Killing Joke'' and deals with [[Zatanna]] and [[Wonder Woman]] struggling to come to terms with the impending attack on Barbara after Zatanna has a [[precognition|precognitive]] dream about it. Like "No Joke", the story heavily implies that the heroines cannot alter Barbara's fate, despite their desire to do so, instead giving her a final night on the town before she loses the use of her legs. The story also implies that Wonder Woman served as the inspiration for Barbara Gordon's eventual codename of Oracle.&lt;ref&gt;[[Straczynski, J. Michael]] (w), [[Chiang, Cliff]] (a). "Ladies' Night". ''[[The Brave and the Bold]]'' #33 (June 2010). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The New 52===
When DC Comics [[The New 52|relaunched its continuity]] in 2011, many of Batman's stories were erased from history or altered, but the events of ''The Killing Joke'' remained intact. In the new continuity, [[Barbara Gordon]] recovered from the paralysis after four years. Although she resumes her work as Batgirl one year after recovering her mobility, she continues to suffer from [[post-traumatic stress]] disorder when exposed to gunfire that could result in receiving new spinal damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|writer=[[Gail Simone]]|penciller=Ardian Syaf|inker=Vicente Cifuentes|title=Batgirl|issue=3|volume=4|publisher=DC Comics|date=February 2012|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 13, 2015 DC Comics released 25 Joker-themed variant covers for its various monthly series for release that June, in celebration of the character's 75th anniversary. Among them was a cover to ''[[Batgirl]]'' #41 by artist [[Rafael Albuquerque]] that took its inspiration from ''The Killing Joke''. The cover depicts the Joker standing next to a tearful Batgirl, who has a red smile painted across her mouth. The Joker has one hand holding a revolver draped over Batgirl's shoulder and is pointing to her cheek with the other hand, as if gesturing to shoot her. The cover quickly drew criticism for highlighting a dark period in the character's history, especially when juxtaposed with the youthful, more optimistic direction of the series at the time. The [[hashtag]] #changethecover drew dozens of posts on Twitter and Tumblr asking DC to not release the variant. DC ultimately withdrew the cover from publication at the request of Albuquerque, who stated, "My intention was never to hurt or upset anyone through my art...For that reason, I have recommended to DC that the variant cover be pulled".&lt;ref&gt;Ching, Albert (March 16, 2015).

==In other media==
*Along with ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'', [[Tim Burton]] has mentioned that ''The Killing Joke'' influenced his [[Batman (1989 film)|film adaptation of ''Batman'']], specifically the origin of the Joker. Burton was quoted as saying, "I was never a giant comic book fan, but I've always loved the image of Batman and the Joker. The reason I've never been a comic book fan — and I think it started when I was a child — is because I could never tell which box I was supposed to read. I don't know if it was [[dyslexia]] or whatever, but that's why I loved ''The Killing Joke'', because for the first time I could tell which one to read. It's my favorite. It's the first comic I've ever loved. And the success of those graphic novels made our ideas more acceptable".&lt;ref&gt;Tim Burton, ''Burton on Burton'', revised ed. (London: Faber and Faber, 2006) 71. {{ISBN|0-571-22926-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Director [[Christopher Nolan]] has mentioned that ''The Killing Joke'' served as an influence for the version of the Joker appearing in the 2008 feature film ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]''.

*In 2009, [[Bruce Timm]] was asked to make an R-rated animated film adaptation of ''The Killing Joke'' as part of the [[DC Universe Animated Original Movies]], but the project was delayed and subsequently scrapped after the polarized reception of ''[[Watchmen (film)|Watchmen]]''. Some concept art of the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] was made by artist Phil Bourassa at that time, although it was not seen until February 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/killing-joke-almost-got-animated-movie-back-2009/|title=Batman: The Killing Joke almost got an animated movie back in 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, during Comic-Con, actor [[Mark Hamill]] stated that he would be willing to voice the Joker for an adaption of ''[[Batman: The Killing Joke (film)|The Killing Joke]]'', encouraging fans to campaign for said adaptation,&lt;ref&gt;1:30 mark of {{YouTube|st2OCn9DI2M|Interview with Mark Hamill at Comic-Con 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZWEn3i1RqU|title=SDCC 2011-BAC: Mark Hamill Interview|work=YouTube|accessdate=October 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; most notably in a tweet made on October 24 that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hamill |first=Mark |url=https://twitter.com/HamillHimself/status/128336011200708608 |title=HamillHimself: I'd come back for THAT!

*In the 2013 video game ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'', a [[downloadable content]] ''Killing Joke'' pack includes three skins for the character from the story. It includes his Hawaiian attire, the [[Red Hood]], and his hat and long coat.&lt;ref&gt;Andronico, Mike (May 15, 2013).

*In the 2013 video game ''[[Batman: Arkham Origins]]'', a prequel to the ''Arkham'' series, there are several references to ''The Killing Joke''. When Batman enters a carnival-esque room, Joker tells him he got a great deal on an out-of-service amusement park, "You should have seen the look on the real estate agent's face when we shook hands on the deal!", alluding to Joker's conning a theme park entrepreneur into granting him the rights of a run-down amusement park early in the graphic novel and then proceeding to murder him via Joker toxin. In a level featuring a psychiatric interview with [[Harley Quinn|Dr. Harleen Quinzel]], Joker is playable as the Red Hood, walking through the chemical plant that will end with him becoming the Joker, as well as earlier beating up several patrons at a Comedy Club due to very poor reception towards a joke he made. The name of the achievement for defeating the Joker in the ending of the game "Perhaps sooner, perhaps later" was a reference to Batman's talk with "Joker" in the beginning of the graphic novel. While promoting the game, [[Troy Baker]], who voices the Joker in the game, recites a monologue from the graphic novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/videos/2013/10/12/nycc-batman-arkham-origins-killing-joke-monologue|title=NYCC: Batman: Arkham Origins' Killing Joke Monologue - IGN Video|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The 2015 video game ''[[Batman: Arkham Knight]]'' depicts the Joker's shooting of Barbara Gordon, as one of Batman's hallucinations throughout the game. The shooting closely resembles the scene in the graphic novel, including the Joker's appearance at Gordon's apartment door, and the clothing he wears, with the only difference being that James Gordon was absent at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Parrish, Robin (August 18, 2015).

''The Killing Joke'' is included in the 2006 trade paperback collection ''[[DC Universe: The Stories of Alan Moore]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/03/29/dc-universe-by-alan-moore-hardcover-review|title=DC Universe by Alan Moore Hardcover Review|author=Schedeen, Jesse|publisher=IGN|date=March 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are multiple printings of the original comic graphic novel.  The title on the cover of the multiple printings changes color.

In March 2008, a deluxe hardcover version of the book was released, featuring recoloring of the book by Brian Bolland. The new colors featured [[black-and-white]] flashbacks, as opposed to Higgins' colors, along with one or two items per panel colored in pink or red, up until the helmet of the Red Hood is revealed. In addition to recoloring the pages, Bolland also removed the yellow oval around the bat symbol on Batman's chest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popcultureshock.com/killing-joke-remastered-13/43466 |title=Killing Joke Remastered |publisher=PopCultureShock |date=2008-03-20 |accessdate=2010-06-17 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106170724/http://www.popcultureshock.com/killing-joke-remastered-13/43466 |archivedate=January 6, 2012 |dead-url=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also included is a colored version of Bolland's "An Innocent Guy" (originally published in ''[[Batman Black and White]]''), an introduction by [[Tim Sale (artist)|Tim Sale]] and an epilogue by Bolland. Van Jensen of ComicMix said that "the new colors really do improve the book, giving it a subtlety and grimness not present in the original".&lt;ref name="comicmix"/&gt; James Donnelly of Pop Syndicate said that the original version "is outdone by Bolland's recoloring", which he said "gives the comic a more timeless quality".&lt;ref name="popsyn"/&gt; Seb Patrick of Den of Geek had a lukewarm reaction, calling the recoloring of the flashbacks "superb", but commenting that "some of the [other] changes seem to have less of a point — increasing definition for the sake of it, but giving the book too much of a present-day feel rather than looking like it was printed in the 1980s".&lt;ref name="denofgeek"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3207">'''Brian Francis Way''' (September 12, 1923 - February 23, 2006), established [[Theatre Centre]] in [[London, England]], in 1953. The company originated the modern concept of theatre for children in an educational context.

Brian Way was born in [[Sussex, England]], in 1923. He was the prime mover in a group of lecturers and teachers, who were in 1946 considering the relationship between theatre and teaching. People such as Peter Slade, Warren Jenkins and Brian English had a considerable influence on his thinking and he edited Slade's book ''Child Drama''. They worked together at [[Bristol Old Vic]], where he met his first wife, Kathleen. After his marriage to her in 1946, they came to London and he continued to make a rather tenuous living from lecturing and teaching until the beginning of the fifties, when he provided a centre for unemployed actors, on occasional days, at a hall in Loudoun Road, St John's Wood.

There he produced plays in the round including ''[[Philoctetes]]'' and ''[[Pinocchio]]'', which he wrote with Warren Jenkins and an abbreviated version of ''[[The Man Born to be King]]'' by [[Dorothy L. Sayers]]. Sayers herself saw this production and was so impressed she donated £200 to him so that he could establish Theatre Centre as a company, whose board of management she joined. Brian, who had co-founded the West Country Children's Theatre Company after the war, again turned his attention to educational children's theatre. He believed that plays in this context ought to be performed in the round, for specific age groups limited in number, with professional actors capable of interacting with the children. He believed the plays should be entertaining, as well as informative. That philosophy has remained the purpose of Theatre Centre ever since. It was not, however, until 1965 that theatre in education became an accepted part of the educational system and of professional theatre.

Brian stated his beliefs in two seminal books, ''Development Through Drama'' and ''Audience Participation'', which have been translated into many languages. He retired from Theatre Centre in 1977 and he has to his credit more than 50 plays. He became a visiting professor in a number of distinguished universities, moving permanently to [[Canada]] in 1983 and living in [[Toronto]] with his second wife Perri. He is survived by her, by Kathleen and by his three children David, Peter and Amanda. He was a seminal figure in the development of educational theatre. He died in Toronto in 2006.

The [[Arts Council of Great Britain]] established The Children's Award to celebrate the accomplishments and raise the profile of theatre for young people and most especially playwrights who work in this field. Since 2006 [[Theatre Centre]] has administrated this Award, which has been renamed 'The Brian Way Award' in honour and recognition of this pioneering man of extraordinary vision.

'''Canal Digital''' is a [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] [[pay TV]] and [[internet service provider]] in Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Finland that was founded in March 1997 as a [[joint venture]] between the French pay TV company [[Canal+]] and the Norwegian [[telecommunications]] operator [[Telenor]]. Since 2003, Canal Digital is fully owned by [[Telenor]].

Canal Digital was started as a [[direct broadcast satellite]] [[television]] service to Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland, but has since expanded into [[cable television]] in Norway, Sweden and Denmark, [[digital terrestrial television]] in Finland and [[IPTV]] in Sweden and Denmark. More than 2.9 million Nordic households and activities are subscribed to their services.

[[FTTH]] services have slowly started in selected areas in Norway.

[[Internet access]] through the [[Hybrid fiber-coaxial|cable network]] is based on the [[EuroDOCSIS]] standard.

Canal Digital's cable system in the newer network areas which includes most of Canal Digital's cable networks in Norway is based on [[hybrid fibre-coaxial]] technology. Some other network areas are [[copper]] only, but are subjected to upgrading in order to support new TV [[set-top box]]'s.

Unlike its DTH rival, [[Viasat]], Canal Digital does not own a TV-network – they have however secured several multi-year exclusive deals with different TV broadcasters. As of 2011, Canal Digital has exclusive [[satellite]] rights with [[C More Entertainment]], [[ProSiebenSat.1]] in Denmark, [[Eurosport]], [[BBC Worldwide]] and [[Discovery Communications]]. Satellite exclusivity was more common in the past, but many channels that were once exclusive to Canal Digital have eventually signed agreements with Viasat. Broadcasters that were once exclusive to Canal Digital but later joined Viasat include [[Sveriges Television]] (joined Viasat in 2003), [[TV4 AB]] (2005–2006), [[National Geographic Channel Scandinavia|National Geographic Channel]], [[ProSiebenSat.1]] in Norway and Sweden, [[TV 2 (Denmark)]] and [[TV 2 (Norway)]].

Their satellite broadcasts can be received from the [[Thor 5]] and [[Thor 6]] satellites at 1°W with any [[DVB-S]] Receiver Equipped with a [[Conax]] Descrambling Module.

==Satellite television==

=== High-definition television ===
Canal Digital was the first major distributor in the region to launch [[high-definition television]]. The first channel, C More HD, was launched in September 2005 using [[MPEG-2]] compression. In June 2006, Canal Digital started broadcasting ''HD-kanalen'' from [[Sveriges Television]] and [[TV4 AB]] in Sweden, which did broadcast the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] in HD using [[MPEG-4]] compression. HD-kanalen became [[SVT HD]] in October when SVT expanded their HD broadcasts.

The major launch of HDTV occurred in Sweden in November 2006 when a special high-definition package with [[Discovery HD]] and [[Voom HD International|Voom HD]] launched and C More HD was rebranded as [[Canal+ HD]]. The high-definition package were to be released in the other Nordic countries during 2007. High-definition channels launching in 2007 include [[Canal+ Sport HD]] in February, [[National Geographic Channel HD]] in April, [[TV4 HD (Sweden)|TV4 HD]] (Sweden only) in May, Silver HD in September and [[History (Scandinavian TV channel)|History HD]] in December.

2008 brought [[Kanal 5 HD]] in January, [[Eurosport HD]] in May, Nelonen HD, [[TVNorge HD]] in October and [[BBC HD Scandinavia|BBC HD]] in December. Channels launched in 2009 include TV 2 Film HD in January and [[Animal Planet Nordic|Animal Planet HD]] in February.

The HD channels were initially offered for as a separate package, but starting on 1 April 2008 this package was dropped in Sweden and the HD channels were included in the "Family" package.

==Gameplay==
The player assumes the role of [[List of Castlevania characters#Gabriel Belmont|Gabriel Belmont]], his son [[List of Castlevania characters#Trevor C. Belmont|Trevor Belmont]], grandson [[List of Castlevania characters#Simon Belmont|Simon Belmont]] (Trevor's son), and [[Alucard (Castlevania)|Alucard]].
Mirror of Fate is a [[side-scrolling]] [[action-adventure game]].

==Plot==
Simon (voiced by [[Alec Newman]]) is the son of Trevor (voiced by [[Richard Madden]]) and Sypha Belmont. At the age of six, Simon’s parents were murdered by the forces of Dracula (voiced by [[Robert Carlyle]]) and Simon was lucky to escape with his own life. Lost and alone, he was found in the forest by some of the mountain people. Simon was taken in and raised amongst them. Simon never forgot what had happened to his parents and vowed to deliver vengeance one day upon those responsible. He trained hard and was extremely gifted in combat, yet life was hard for young Simon growing up. Always an outcast amongst the tribe, he developed a strong will and stubborn attitude that would always boil over into rage, and men soon came to fear him and his prowess in the arts of war. He fiercely protected a fragment of mirror given to him by his father and always wore it around his neck for safekeeping. Many years passed, yet the rage and yearning for revenge never left his heart. So one day he left the relative safety of the mountains and headed towards the land of his birth, to seek out the one they call the Dragon, to meet him face to face, and destroy him forever, little knowing that the curse of his family name would lead him into darkness and a terrible truth.&lt;ref name="Castlevania: Lords of Shadow - Mirror of Fate Official Website - Cursed by Blood"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.konami-castlevania.com/mof/us#/home |title=Castlevania: Lords of Shadow – Mirror of Fate Official Website – Cursed by Blood |accessdate=December 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s '''''Clavier-Übung II''''' was [[List of compositions by Johann Sebastian Bach printed during his lifetime|published in 1735]], containing two works written for performance on a two-[[manual (music)|manual]] [[harpsichord]]. In the publication, Bach contrasted a work in Italian style – a ''[[Italian Concerto, BWV 971|Concerto nach Italienischem Gusto]]'' (''Concerto after the Italian taste'', now known as the ''Italian Concerto''), BWV 971, with a work in French style, a [[Suite (music)|suite]] which he called ''[[Ouvertüre nach franzosischer Art]]'' (''Overture in the French style'', also known as the ''French Overture''), BWV 831.

==History==
The ''French Overture'' had previously been written down in [[C minor]]; for the publication of 1735 Bach transposed it to [[B minor]] and made slight changes to the musical text, for example in the rhythms of the first movement. The reason for the transposition is not known: one speculation is that the aim was to increase the contrast between the two works. F major is a "flat" key and B minor is a "sharp" key, and the keynotes are related by a [[tritone]], which is the most distant [[Modulation (music)|modulation]]. Another possible motivation is that out of the eight German note names A, B ([[B♭ (musical note)|B{{music|flat}}]]), C, D, E, F, G, H ([[B (musical note)|B{{music|natural}}]]), six had already been used as keynotes in the Partitas, thus only F and H remained.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.signumclassics.com/catalogue/sigcd030/programme.htm] Programme notes for recording by Lucy Carolan&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Cobalt WASD''''' is an [[action video game|action]] [[video game]] developed by Oxeye Game Studio and published by [[Mojang]] released on 30 November 2017&lt;ref name="Steam"/&gt; for [[Microsoft Windows]].

== Gameplay ==
The player plays as either a "Metalface" or a "Protobot". The Metalfaces try to defend the bomb-sites, while the Protobots try to attack and plant a bomb. When the Protobots plant the bomb, the Metalfaces must try to defuse the bomb before it explodes. The Protobots win when they kill all of the Metalfaces, and the Metalfaces win then they defuse the bomb.&lt;ref name="RPS"/&gt; At the end of each round, players can choose to buy armor, weapons, or vehicles.&lt;ref name="PC Games N"/&gt; While the game mainly focuses on the online multiplayer game mode, there is a mode where the player can play against offline bots.&lt;ref name="Press"/&gt;

== History ==
''Cobalt WASD'' is a separate stand-alone spin-off of ''[[Cobalt (video game)|Cobalt]]''. The developers saw that the original game was too complex for some players and its higher price point discouraged some players, so they wanted to make a completely different game. They decided to make a spin-off of ''Cobalt'', focusing on just one game mode.&lt;ref name="Press"/&gt;

== Reception ==
''Cobalt WASD'' has been called a "very funny and competitive multiplayer game"&lt;ref name="Eurogamer"/&gt; and a "2D version of ''[[Call of Duty]]'''s Search and Destroy game mode".&lt;ref name="PC Games N"/&gt;

The '''Cornell Cup''' is an annual college-level [[Embedded system|embedded]] design competition created by [[Cornell Systems Engineering]] and hosted by [[Cornell University]]. The competition was an initiative originally created by [[Cornell University and Intel, and now partnered with arm ]] to "empower student teams to become the inventors of the newest innovative applications of embedded technology".&lt;ref name=home1&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=http://www.systemseng.cornell.edu/engineering2/se/intel/about/|publisher=[[Cornell University]]|accessdate=26 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The competition is designed to allow college students the opportunity to transform ideas into real products with actual results. Various awards are given with a range of prizes between $1,000 and $10,000.&lt;ref name=accapp /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cornell Cup USA |url=http://wece.ec.illinois.edu/?p=1748|publisher=Women in ECE|accessdate=26 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Expand section|date=November 2013}}

The competition was announced in late 2011 by Intel as a way of finding and encouraging college students to develop ideas and transform them into robust products. The competition is built based on the highly successful [[Intel Cup China]] that attracts over 26,000 students annually.

==Qualification==
To qualify for the application stage, a team must be formed with the following requirements:&lt;ref name=home1 /&gt;

* The team must be between 3 and 5 students
* Each student must be enrolled full-time in any accredited U.S. university
* Students must be enrolled full-time in an undergraduate or masters
* Students must be engineering, science, or computer science students
* Students must complete the application stage by the designated deadline

==Competition summary==
[[File:Young Guru speaking at the Cornell Cup USA 2014.jpg|thumb|right|[[Young Guru]] speaking at the 2014 event.]]
The competition involves two stages: an applications stage and a finalists stage.

===Applications Stage===
The application stage typically takes place in the months the previous year of the competition. Teams must complete an application which includes a team interest form, a competition integrity form, and a 7 application questions form by the designated deadline. Applications are reviewed by the Cornell review team which in turn selects up to 35 of the top application submissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Team Info|url=http://www.systemseng.cornell.edu/engineering2/se/intel/team/|publisher=Cornell Cup USA|accessdate=26 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The selected team can then participate in the final competition.

====Finalists Support====
Finalists are given an array of support as they work through their plan.&lt;ref name=home1 /&gt;

* '''Hardware''' - Each team is given the latest Intel Atom board. The board is equipped with an Intel Atom, an FPGA, and a large array of I/O. Additionally various other equipment is provided from secondary sponsors.
* '''Funding''' - Each team is provided $1,500 in financial support to aid their project and team.
* '''Access''' - Each team is given direct access to Intel technical leaders other sponsoring companies' experts who are designing and developing embedded hardware and application commercially.
* '''Training''' - Cornell Systems Engineering offers an online guide system to hone students professional design skills
* '''Invitation''' - Teams are invited to the public expo

===Finalists Stage===
The top application submissions that have been chosen have roughly half a year to make their project come to fruition. The teams are responsible for following through their application. A final report is required to be submitted by the deadline. The competition holds an all-day public [[Trade fair|expo]] during May where judges hear a six-minutes pitch, asking questions, examining posters, and checking out the demos. Each team undergoes a more in-depth, private review process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cornell Cup: Be awesome all the time {{!}} EDN|url=http://www.edn.com/electronics-blogs/engineering-the-next-generation/4372089/Cornell-Cup-Be-awesome-all-the-time|publisher=EDN|accessdate=26 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cornell Cup |url=https://www.edn.com/electronics-blogs/engineering-the-next-generation/4372089/Cornell-Cup-Be-awesome-all-the-time |publisher=EDN |accessdate=26 November 2013 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204101547/http://www.edn.com/electronics-blogs/engineering-the-next-generation/4372089/Cornell-Cup-Be-awesome-all-the-time |archivedate=4 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the final day of the expo, the winners are announced and awarded first, second, or third place in various categories. Various other sponsors may potentially offer special awards to various teams in addition to these awards. The expo takes place at [[Walt Disney World]] in May.

==Awards==
[[File:Cornell Cup USA 2014 Expo 05.jpg|thumb|right|The teams presenting their projects at the 2014 expo.]]
During the expo a number of awards will be given away in addition to the grand prize award.

===Cornell Cup USA, presented by Intel Grand Prizes===

The grand prize winner will receive $10,000. Second place team will receive $5,000. Third place team will receive $2,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top Engineering Students to Square Off at Cornell Cup USA by Intel|url=http://www.newswise.com/articles/top-engineering-students-to-square-off-at-cornell-cup-usa-by-intel|accessdate=26 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===People's Choice Award===
During the Cornell Cup Expo, all competition participants will be able to have a single vote for their choice of team. These votes will determine the winning team. '''People's Choice Award''' will go to the team receiving the most participants' votes but did not win one of the 3 grand prizes.

===Wild Card Award===
Teams that have successfully submitted an application, but were not chosen as finalists are allowed to submit a final report. Their final report must follow the same rules and guidelines as the finalists. The '''Wild Card Award''' is given to a team who were deemed strong enough by the review judges.

===Media Award===
Each of the finalist team must create an On-line Chronicle blog using the template provided by the competition. They must also generate [[social network]] and media buzz by publishing updates on various channels. The '''Media Award''' are judged by members of the media, which is based on team [[blogs]], online channels, and their presentation at the expo.

The top two teams will receive $1,000 awards.&lt;ref name=accapp&gt;{{cite web|title=Cornell Cup USA, presented by Intel accepting applications for third annual competition|url=http://www.systemseng.cornell.edu/intel/news/2014_accepting_applications.cfm|publisher=Cornell Cup USA|accessdate=26 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Entrepreneurship Award===
In 2014 the competition added a new award, the '''Entrepreneurship Award''', where teams can create a business plan around their Cornell Cup project which could be pitched to [[venture capitalist]]s. The award was created due to a great interest by past teams that wanted to turn their creative competition inventions into [[entrepreneurial]] opportunities after the Cup's final expo.

The winner of the Entrepreneurship Award will receive $2,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Optional Entrepreneurship Award Rules|url=http://www.systemseng.cornell.edu/se/intel/team/rules.cfm#entrepreneurship|publisher=Cornell Cup|accessdate=26 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Dance Dance Revolution Solo''''' is a short-lived series of games spun off of the main ''[[Dance Dance Revolution]]'' series. It consists of three arcade releases in Japan. The game mode was also adapted for use in a children's arcade version and two console releases (as a game mode).

==Gameplay==
Gameplay in the ''Solo'' series is nearly identical to that of the main ''Dance Dance Revolution'' series, but with a few differences to optimize the game for single-player mode.  In addition to the four-panel mode offered in the main series, ''Solo'' adds a three-panel mode in its ''Bass Mix'' and ''2000'' releases, as well as a six-panel mode in all of its releases.  Both modes add two new panels: up-left and up-right.  The three-panel mode adds the down arrow to these, while the six-panel mode combines both the four traditional panels and the two new panels.

==Games==
[[File:Dance Dance Revolution Kids arcade machine.jpg|120px|thumb|left|''Dance Dance Revolution Kids'' adapts elements from ''Solo'' for a younger audience.]]

=== Main series ===

==== ''Dance Dance Revolution Solo Bass Mix'' ====
{{nihongo|&amp;nbsp;|ダンスダンスレボリューションソロベースミックス|Dansu Dansu Reboryūshon Soro Bēsu Mikkusu}} is the first game in the series. It was released as an [[arcade game]] by [[Konami]] on August 19, 1999 in [[Japan]]. The game premiered 16 songs to the series and takes its name, as well as most of its soundtrack, from the [[Dancemania]] BASS albums. This is the first game that features a live-action intro.

==== ''Dance Dance Revolution Solo 2000'' ====
{{nihongo|&amp;nbsp;||ダンスダンスレボリューションソロ2000|Dansu Dansu Reboryūshonsoro Tsū Sauzando}} the second game in the series. It was released as an [[arcade game]] by [[Konami]] on December 16, 1999 in [[Japan]]. DDR Solo 2000 premiered 20 songs to the series and also featured all 16 songs from Bass Mix, for a total of 36 songs.

==== ''Dance Dance Revolution Solo 4thMix'' ====
This game and '''Dance Dance Revolution Solo 4thMix Plus''' were released concurrently with 4thMix and 4thMix Plus respectively, designed for use with Solo cabinets. The changes in the actual game engine are few, but significant. The 4 and 6-panel modes are offered instead of the usual options, and the chubby arrows of the Solo series also appear. Multi-player Mode from the Solo series is not present in either game.

=== Derivatives ===
While not Solo releases per se, these games offer a one-player mode inspired by ''Solo''.
* '''''Dance Dance Revolution Extra Mix''''' for the PlayStation in Japan featured a total of 50 songs: 33 of the 36 songs from Solo 2000, plus 11 songs that premiered in 4thMix Plus, four previews from 5thMix and two songs that later premiered in DDRMAX 6thMix. Of these, only the Solo 2000 and 4thMix Plus songs include Solo steps, though Edit Mode allows players to create custom Solo steps for any of the 50 songs.
* '''''[[Dance Dance Revolution Konamix]]''''' for the PlayStation is the first release in North America to feature a Solo mode.
* '''''Dance Dance Revolution Kids''''' {{nihongo|&amp;nbsp;|ダンスダンスレボリューションキッズ|Dansu Dansu Reboryūshon Kizzu}}, sometimes abbreviated as {{nihongo|'''''DDR Kids'''''|DDRキッズ|Dī Dī Ā Kizzu}}, is a game in the ''Dance Dance Revolution'' series aimed at a younger audience. Released in December 2000 by Konami for the [[Japan]]ese arcade rooms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://callusnext.com/pcbs/ddrkids.html|title=KONAMI GSAN1基板情報(DanceDanceRevolution Kids)|accessdate=May 13, 2012|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; DDR Kids is limited in comparison to the main series. Only one player can play at a time, the steps are very simplistic and it's easier to score a passing grade. The arcade machine is smaller than a typical DDR machine, designed for smaller players. The song selection is also limited with only a couple of tracks from the main series. The rest are mostly exclusive to this release and feature theme songs to children's shows that have aired in Japan.
* '''''Dancing Karaoke DKara''''' was released on January 16, 2001. It combined the gameplay of Dance Dance Revolution with [[karaoke]] style singing. Konami had previously released two titles with similar gameplay in the past as very rare arcade machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.system16.com/hardware.php?id=825 |title=BEMANI KARAOKE HARDWARE |accessdate=10 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The song selection was primarily download driven and features a unique set of music that has not been repeated in any other DDR game. The downloadable songs were sold for ¥150 a song&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ddr.sh/info/trick/dkara.html#general |title=Dancing Karaoke DKara general information |accessdate=10 September 2016 |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; and released in packs of varying size a week or so apart from each other. As of August 9, 2001 the total number of songs available for DKara including the original game and downloadable content was 80, however an undetermined number of songs have been released since then. A newer release, [[Karaoke Revolution|Karaoke Revolution Party]], features similar gameplay.

===Soundtrack===
A combined soundtrack for both ''DDR Solo'' mixes was released by [[Toshiba-EMI]] under their [[Dancemania]] dance music brand. It contains 35 tracks from the game and all 9 megamixes.

==Controversy==
In 2002, a bowling alley in [[San Diego]], [[California]] removed a ''Solo 2000'' machine after Jennifer Stoefen and several members of a local group, known as Youth Advocacy Coalition (YAC), complained that the background movies of selected songs contained images that could promote [[substance abuse]], such as a scantily clad nurse and pills in "I'm Alive" and alcoholic drinks appearing in "Club Tropicana". 

The alley opted to replace the ''Solo 2000'' machine with a ''[[DDRMAX Dance Dance Revolution 6thMix]]'' machine, which removes the nurse theme and alcohol references, but includes profanity. Konami responded by warning arcades that such machines are illegally imported. Using the DDR Freak fan site, the YAC located other ''Solo 2000'' machines and considered contacting the operators, asking for the games to be removed or replaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last= Clark |first= Brian |date= June 21, 2002|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/northcounty/20020621-9999_1mi21ddr.html |title=Teens get mad over video; it's removed |accessdate=2008-01-20|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040211215304/http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/northcounty/20020621-9999_1mi21ddr.html|archivedate=February 11, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, DDR Freak published a statement that denied the allegations of ''Dance Dance Revolution'' promoting substance abuse, pointing out that ''Solo 2000'' had a medical theme instead. Videos of related TV news report uploaded on DDR Freak contain the text: "F***IN IDIOT NEWS REPORTERS".

In 1997, the [[BBC]] soap opera ''[[EastEnders]]'' broadcast three singular transmissions that were filmed on location in [[Dublin]], Ireland. The episodes involved the [[The Beale/Fowler family|Fowler and Beale family]] travelling from London to Ireland to meet their long-lost relatives. They were badly received by viewers and heavily criticised in the media. The BBC was inundated with complaints from angry viewers from Ireland for negative stereotyping, portraying Irish people as "dirty, rude, and drunk".&lt;ref name="Italy"&gt;"[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-61053150.html Italy's Square deal; LAST NIGHT'S VIEW]", ''[[Daily Mirror|The Mirror]]''. URL last accessed on 18 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Complaints were made by the Irish Embassy and there were fears that the episodes would have a negative effect on the Irish tourist trade. The BBC was forced to issue an apology for causing offence.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,564651,00.html |title= No soft soapbox|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' | author = Summerskill, Ben| date = 7 October 2001| accessdate=11 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Storyline development==
In 1997, ''EastEnders'' aired a storyline in which the character [[Pauline Fowler]] ([[Wendy Richard]]) discovers that she has a long-lost sister, [[#Maggie Flaherty|Maggie Flaherty]] (Olivia Shanley). In the storyline, Pauline's now-deceased mother [[Lou Beale]] had given Maggie up for adoption shortly after her birth, as she was born out of wedlock. Maggie is first said to be the result of an illicit affair Lou had with an Irishman 60 years earlier, but although Maggie is initially thought to be Pauline's half-sister, it later transpires that they share the same father too; Maggie was only the result of pre-marital sex between Lou and her husband-to-be, [[Albert Beale]].

Pauline and various members of the Fowler and Beale family travel to Ireland to reunite with their long-lost relatives in a special week of episodes. The episodes were filmed on location in the countryside around [[County Dublin]], away from the soap's typical filming location in [[Borehamwood]], England.&lt;ref name="ireland"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-61088991.html |title= EastEnders' stars arrive in the Emerald Isle|publisher=''The News Letter (Belfast, Northern Ireland)'' | date = 23 July 1997| accessdate=11 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were filmed over a period of two weeks in July and August 1997, and were broadcast on 22, 23 and 25 September 1997. In the three episodes, Pauline is accompanied by her sons [[Mark Fowler]] ([[Todd Carty]]) and [[Martin Fowler (EastEnders)|Martin Fowler]] ([[James Alexandrou]]), Mark's wife [[Ruth Fowler]] ([[Caroline Paterson]]), nephew [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]) and his daughter [[Lucy Beale]] ([[Casey Anne Rothery]]). Speaking about their trip to Dublin, actress Wendy Richard who played Pauline said "It's nice to be in Dublin for a change. It's not like London at all, where they take you a little bit for granted", and Todd Carty, who played her screen son Mark, said "It's also really nice to get out of Albert Square for a while to do something different."&lt;ref name="ireland1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-61076383.html |title= Albert Square's touch of Blarney as the Fowlers find lost family; EASTENDER PAULINE COMES WEST|publisher=''The Mirror'' | author = Taylor, Richie| date = 23 July 1997| accessdate=11 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of Irish actors were cast as Pauline's long-lost relatives, many of whom were starring in their first prominent television role.&lt;ref name="ireland1"/&gt; They included Maggie Flaherty, played by Olivia Shanley, son [[Conor Flaherty|Conor]] ([[Seán Gleeson|Sean Gleeson]]) and his headstrong daughter [[Mary Flaherty (EastEnders)|Mary]] ([[Melanie Clark Pullen]]).&lt;ref name="mel"&gt;"[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_20010204/ai_n14524642 I felt so lonely and isolated when I went to work on EastEnders]", ''Sunday Mirror''. URL last accessed on 31 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; For the latter two characters, Conor and Mary, the Ireland episodes were only the beginning of their stint in ''EastEnders''. Both characters remained in the serial as regulars, moving back to the soap's setting in [[Albert Square]] to be with the new-found family. They remained on-screen for two years. At the time of filming the Ireland episodes, Gleeson, from [[Thurles]], [[County Tipperary]], said, "The ''EastEnders'' cast are all really nice people", and Shanley said, "I've always been a big fan of ''EastEnders'' and to tell the truth I was a bit star struck [...] But they made us all feel very much at ease."&lt;ref name="ireland1"/&gt; Clark Pullen added, "I was expecting the cast to be luvvies but they were all brilliant – real grafters and totally down to earth. They were all very supportive as well and made me feel right at home. I was pretty starstruck [...] Wendy Richard who plays Pauline Fowler was great – she is the most wonderful woman and she quietly gave me advice on how to cope with the sudden fame and attention."&lt;ref name="pullen"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_20000102/ai_n9706465 |title= MY LIFE WITHOUT SOAP: Interview – Melanie Clark Pullen|publisher=''Sunday Mirror'' | author = Doherty, Amanda| date = 2 January 2000| accessdate=11 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were also joined by a host of other characters, including Maggie's husband Sean ([[Pat Laffan]]), second son Eamonn ([[Maurice O'Donoghue]]), Eamonn's wife Brenda ([[Janet Behan]]) and daughter Colette ([[Shiona Redmond]]).&lt;ref name="ireland1"/&gt;

==Reception==
The episodes were not well received by viewers or the media. The BBC and the programme makers were heavily criticised for the [[stereotype|stereotypical]] way they portrayed [[Irish people]].&lt;ref name="pork"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-61058550.html|title=WHAT A LOAD OF PORK PIES; Ireland's full of drunkards, dimwits and donkeys according to EastEnders|publisher=''The Mirror''| author = Kierans, John| date = 24 September 1997| accessdate=11 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Viewers were angered by scenes that they felt portrayed Irish as resentful towards English, drunk, dirty, poor and rude – one scene showed a drunk man pouring beer over Pauline Fowler (later revealed to be her brother-in-law), and then demanding payment for the drink.&lt;ref name="pork"/&gt; Others were angered by the scriptwriters' decision to include various farm animals in a street scene on the outskirts of Dublin, with one viewer commenting to the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'': "It was nothing like life in the real Ireland of today. When did you last see a donkey walking along our streets? The EastEnders production team haven't got a clue about modern Irish society; they are living in the Dark Ages."&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pork"/&gt;

The BBC and [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]] (the Public Service Broadcaster of Ireland) received complaints from angry Irish people all over Britain and Ireland, and it was reported that viewers "bombarded" local and national radio stations, claiming the episodes were an insult to Irish people everywhere.&lt;ref name="pork"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Oirish"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-61144901.html|title= Irish Eastenders' fans in a lather over soap Oirish over Dublin|publisher=''The News Letter (Belfast, Northern Ireland)''| date = 24 September 1997| accessdate=11 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Callers to [[Radio Ulster]]'s [[Talk radio#Talk radio in the United Kingdom|Talkback]] programme and [[Gerry Ryan]]'s morning talk show on [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ radio]], demanded that the scriptwriters be sacked. BBC contributor Mike Philpott described the show as "the worst case of stage 'Oirish' seen for a long time" and "one of the most shameful half-hour episodes in the history of British television".&lt;ref name="Oirish"/&gt;

The angry reaction stretched from official channels, such as the [[Diplomatic missions of Ireland|Irish Embassy]], to holiday chiefs, who feared that the episodes would have a negative effect on tourist trade.&lt;ref name="Oirish"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ofcom" /&gt; The Irish Embassy in London said, "[''EastEnders''] has caused a great deal of upset and annoyance in the country [Ireland] and with Irish people in Britain."&lt;ref name="pork"/&gt; Furthermore, they suggested that the episodes "presented a prejudiced and stereotyped view of Ireland that [was] utterly unrecognisable."&lt;ref name="pork"/&gt; Ted Barrington, Ireland's ambassador to the UK, described the portrayal of Ireland as an "unrepresentative caricature", stating he was worried by the negative stereotypes and the images of drunkenness, backwardness and isolation.&lt;ref name="dirty"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-61151274.html|title= Soap does the dirty on Éire says envoy|publisher=''The News Letter (Belfast, Northern Ireland)''| date = 25 September 1997| accessdate=11 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added, "EastEnders is a powerful and very concentrated medium … People are upset at the caricature and misrepresentation of Ireland. Irish people can laugh at themselves but, the point is, this is one of the most popular programmes on British television, and it decided to present an image of Ireland that conforms to old-fashioned negative stereotypes. It selected an unrepresentative range of stereotypes. Cultural and racial stereotyping tends to create barriers between people."&lt;ref name="dirty"/&gt;

Mark Mortell, the chairman of Ireland's national tourism development, [[Fáilte Ireland|Bord Fáilte]], said: "I am enormously concerned that the single biggest television audience in Britain was shown a negative image of Irish hospitality … It has the potential to be enormously damaging."&lt;ref name="pork"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Oirish"/&gt;  His colleague, John Lahiffe, added: "I am dismayed by the mischievous nature of it. We go to great efforts to promote this country, but it was in no way representative of Ireland."&lt;ref name="pork"/&gt;

Various Irish entertainers and sports personalities also went public with their opinions on the episodes. Broadcaster [[Gerry Kelly (broadcaster)|Gerry Kelly]] labelled the episodes racist, and an unmitigated disaster.&lt;ref name="people"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-61112421.html|title=I blame Irish actors for selling us short|publisher=''The People''| author = Kelly, Gerry| date = 28 September 1997| accessdate=11 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Irish actors, who were employed specifically for the storyline, were also criticised by Kelly for not speaking out against the scenes they were enacting. He accused them of selling out their heritage and denigrating their fellow-countrymen.&lt;ref name="people"/&gt; Comic [[Brendan O'Carroll]] said, "Whoever wrote the script has obviously never been to Ireland. I'm very disappointed because ''EastEnders'' is a programme I have great respect for. It is outrageous and untrue to portray us like that. I'm disappointed the producers allowed it to be broadcast as it was."&lt;ref name="pork"/&gt; Former jockey and TV presenter Declan Murphy said, "It's wrong and disgraceful when writers portray everyone from Ireland as backward drunks. I am an Irishman and I'm proud of it, but I'm not a drunk and I'm certainly not backward and neither are my compatriots."&lt;ref name="pork"/&gt; Actor Garret Keogh, who played an "ignorant" Irish hotel owner in the ''EastEnders'' episodes, revealed: "The streets around [[Cabra, Dublin|Cabra]], where I live, are hopping. I went down to get the paper and some bread and I was accosted. The script has stirred up a hell of a hornets' nest here. I'm only an actor, but I wouldn't want to do anything that would be demeaning to me, my people or my country."&lt;ref name="pork"/&gt; However, actor [[Dermot Morgan]] urged Irish people not to over-react: "I'm sure there's no great conspiracy against Irish people here. The BBC have a good track record and this would seem to be a dodgy storyline that has somehow crept through. As for being drunks, surely they must only mean on a Saturday night!"&lt;ref name="pork"/&gt;&lt;ref name="beeb"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-61058551.html|title=BEEB'S APOLOGY FOR TV INSULT TO IRISH|publisher=''The Mirror''| author = Kierans, John| date = 24 September 1997| accessdate=11 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Complaints were upheld by the British [[Ofcom|Broadcasting Standards Commission]], who said "the intention was positive rather than negative but the result was clumsy and irritating".&lt;ref name="ofcom"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-61066865.html|title= Soap rapped for 'irritating' Irish scenes|publisher=''The Mirror''| author = Tallant, Nicola| date = 28 September 1997| accessdate=11 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC said, "EastEnders has a reputation for showing slices of life in many different ways and sometimes these are not flattering",&lt;ref name="pork"/&gt; but they admitted that the episodes were "ill-judged" and issued a public apology for causing offence and misrepresenting Irish people.&lt;ref name="ofcom"/&gt;&lt;ref name="beeb"/&gt; [[Jana Bennett]], the BBC's then director of production, stated on [[BBC One|BBC1]]'s news bulletin: "It is clear that a significant number of viewers have been upset by the recent episodes of ''EastEnders'', and we are very sorry, because the production team and programme makers did not mean to cause any offence." A year later, in 1998, BBC chairman [[Christopher Bland]] admitted that as result of the Irish-set ''EastEnders'' episodes, the station failed in its pledge to represent all groups accurately and avoid reinforcing prejudice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/172718.stm BBC sets out pledges], ''BBC News''.

'''Margaret "Maggie" Flaherty''' is the illegitimate child of [[Lou Beale|Lou]] ([[Anna Wing]]) and [[Albert Beale]] ([[Gary Olsen]]), before they married. She was given up for adoption, as she was born out of wedlock, and was sent to live with a family in Ireland.

In 1996, eight years after Lou's death in 1988, her youngest daughter [[Pauline Fowler|Pauline]] ([[Wendy Richard]]) finds a letter from Lou to her best friend [[Ethel Skinner|Ethel]] ([[Gretchen Franklin]]), revealing that she had a secret daughter. Pauline and her family try to find Maggie, and when they do, they visit her in Kilmoneen, Ireland.

Whilst in Ireland, Maggie's lecherous husband [[#Sean Flaherty|Sean]] (Pat Laffin) flirts with Pauline, and is abusive to his granddaughter, [[Mary Flaherty (EastEnders)|Mary]] ([[Melanie Clark Pullen]]). When Pauline and her family leave, taking Mary with them, she begs Maggie to leave Sean and return to [[Walford]] with her, but Maggie decides to stay and look after her vast family. This is the last time she is seen.

Her grown up family send a wreath to Pauline's funeral in 2006 and Maggie herself sends flowers and a condolence message to her nephew [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]), when his daughter [[Lucy Beale|Lucy]] ([[Hetti Bywater]]) dies in 2014.

Sean leers over [[Pauline Fowler]] ([[Wendy Richard]])'s [[breasts]] and tries to buy her a drink, only to be told to leave her alone by [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]).

He is then thrown out of the bar.&lt;ref name="mon"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mon 22 Sep 97 |url=https://web.archive.org/web/19980710115651/http://walford.net:80/story/1509.htm|publisher=walford.net|accessdate=28 January 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19980710115651/http://walford.net:80/story/1509.htm|archivedate= 10 July 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edward Victor''' (1887 – 17 April 1964), born Edward Neuschwander, was a notable [[stage magician]].&lt;ref&gt;Price, David. (1985). ''Magic: A Pictoral History of Conjurers in the Theater''. Cornwall Books. pp. 331&amp;ndash;333&lt;/ref&gt; He was an early member of the [[The Magic Circle (organisation)|Magic Circle]] and was promoted to the Inner Magic Circle, and for over thirty years was president of the [[Merlin Magical Society]].

Early in his career he also took up [[Shadowgraphy (performing art)|Shadowgraphy]].

==History==
In 1911, a trial week at [[St. George's Hall, London|St. George's Hall]] was extended to many months, setting the standard for his professional career. He played top variety theaters in [[Europe]] and [[South Africa]] and was often seen on [[television]] (including a "[[What's My Line]]?" appearance which he was quickly recognized).
Victor was the Blackpool Magicians' club's first Honorary Life President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blackpoolmagic.com/history.html |title=Blackpool Magicians' Club History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28000">Films made in the 2000s featuring the character of [[James Bond]] included ''[[Die Another Day]]'', ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]'', and ''[[Quantum of Solace]]''.

==''Die Another Day'' (2002)==
[[Principal photography]] of ''Die Another Day'' began on 11 January 2002 at Pinewood studios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2002/01/12/nbond12.xml |title=Brosnan meets the two-faced Bond villain |publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=17 July 2009| location=London | first=Hugh | last=Davies | date=12 January 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was shot primarily in the United Kingdom, [[Iceland]], and [[Cádiz|Cádiz, Spain]]. Other locations included Pinewood Studios' historic [[Albert R. Broccoli's 007 Stage|007 Stage]], and scenes shot in [[Maui]], Hawaii, in December 2001.
[[Laird Hamilton]], [[Dave Kalama]], and [[Darrick Doerner]] performed the pre-title surfing scene at the surf break known as Jaws in [[Peahi, Hawaii|Pe{{okina}}ahi, Maui]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Maui's monster surf break getting bigger by the day |author= Timothy Hurley |newspaper= [[Honolulu Advertiser]] |date=18 November 2002 |url= http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2002/Nov/18/ln/ln04a.html |accessdate=29 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the shore shots were taken near Cádiz and [[Newquay|Newquay, Cornwall]]. Scenes inside Graves' diamond mine were also filmed in [[Cornwall]], at the [[Eden Project]]. The scenes involving the Cuban locations Havana and the fictional Isla Los Organos were filmed at [[La Caleta, Spain]].&lt;ref name="locales"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.movie-locations.com/movies/d/dieanother.html |title=Die Another Day filming locations |accessdate=20 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scenes featuring Berry in a bikini were shot in Cádiz; the location was reportedly cold and windy, and footage has been released of Berry wrapped in thick towels between takes to avoid catching a chill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|title=Die Another Day |medium=DVD |year=2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Berry was injured during filming when debris from a smoke grenade flew into her eye. The debris was removed in a 30-minute operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/1390372/Halle-Berry-hurt-in-blast-during-Bond-film-scene.html |title=Halle Berry hurt in blast during Bond film scene |author=Hugh Davies |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=10 April 2002 |accessdate=8 March 2012| location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gadgets and other props from every previous Bond film and stored in Eon Productions' archives appear in Q's warehouse in the [[London Underground]]. Examples include the jetpack in ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'' and [[Rosa Klebb]]'s poison-tipped shoe in ''[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia with Love]]''.&lt;ref name="dvdcommentary1"&gt;{{cite video|title=Die Another Day [[Audio commentary]] 1|people=[[Lee Tamahori]], [[Michael G. Wilson]]|location=''Die Another Day''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Q mentions that the watch he issues Bond is "your 20th, I believe", a reference to ''Die Another Day'' being the 20th Eon-produced Bond film.&lt;ref name="dvdcommentary2"&gt;{{cite video|title=Die Another Day [[Audio commentary]] 2|people=[[Pierce Brosnan]], [[Rosamund Pike]]|location=''Die Another Day''}}&lt;/ref&gt; In London, the [[Reform Club]] was used to shoot several places in the film, including the lobby at the [[Blades Club]], MI6 Headquarters, Buckingham Palace, Green Park, and Westminster. [[Svalbard|Svalbard, Norway]] and [[Jökulsárlón|Jökulsárlón, Iceland]] were used for the car chase on the ice with additional scenes filmed at [[Jostedalsbreen National Park|Jostedalsbreen National Park, Norway]] and [[RAF Little Rissington|RAF Little Rissington, Gloucestershire]].&lt;ref name="locales"/&gt;

[[File:Jökulsárlón April 07-3.JPG|thumb|left|[[Jökulsárlón|Jökulsárlón, Iceland]]]]

The scene where Bond surfs the wave that Icarus created when Graves was trying to kill Bond was shot on the blue screen. The waves and all of the glaciers in the scene were digitally produced.

The hangar interior of the "US Air Base in South Korea", shown crowded with [[CH-47 Chinook|Chinook]] helicopters, was filmed at [[RAF Odiham]] in Hampshire, UK, as were the helicopter interior shots during the Switchblade sequence although this took place entirely on the ground with the sky background being added in post-production using blue screen techniques. Although in the plot the base is American, in reality all the aircraft and personnel in the shot are British. In the film, a Switchblade (one-man glider shaped like a fighter jet) is used by Bond and Jinx to enter North Korea undetected. The Switchblade was based on a workable model called "PHASST" (Programmable High Altitude Single Soldier Transport). Kinetic Aerospace Inc.'s lead designer, Jack McCornack was impressed by director Lee Tamahori's way of conducting the Switchblade scene and said, "It's brief, but realistic. The good guys get in unobserved, thanks to a fast cruise, good glide performance, and minimal radar signature. It's a wonderful promotion for the PHASST."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Bond Flies PHASST |publisher=Kinetic Aerospace |url=http://www.kineticaerospace.com/ |accessdate=18 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Graves' plane was a {{convert|20|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} model that was controlled by a computer. When the plane flew through the Icarus beam, engineers cut the plane away piece by piece so that it looked like it was burning and falling apart.

The [[Sex in film|sex scene]] between Bond and Jinx—the first time onscreen in the series in which Bond is depicted actually having sex as opposed to a post-coital scenario—had to be trimmed for the American market. An early cut of ''Die Another Day'' featured a brief moment—seven seconds in length—in which Jinx is heard [[Orgasm|moaning strongly]]. The [[MPAA]] ordered that the scene be trimmed so that ''Die Another Day'' could get the expected [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|PG-13]] rating. The scene was cut as requested, earning the film a PG-13 rating for "action violence and sexuality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0246460/alternateversions |title=''Die Another Day'' (Alternate versions) |publisher=Internet Movie Database |accessdate=17 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Casino Royale'' (2006)==
[[Image:Daniel Craig on Venice yacht crop w Wilson.jpg|thumb|Craig in Venice during filming.|alt=A man wearing a grey shirt, jeans and sunglasses sits on a boat at sea. Besides him, a man wearing a black shirt, red cap and sunglasses talks to another which is mostly off the picture.]]
Principal photography for ''Casino Royale'' commenced on 3 January 2006 and concluded on 20 July 2006. The film was primarily shot at [[Barrandov Studios]] in Prague, with additional location shooting in the [[Bahamas]], Italy and the United Kingdom. The shoot concluded at [[Pinewood Studios]].&lt;ref name="Real"&gt;{{cite video|title=James Bond: For Real |medium=DVD |publisher=Special Treats Productions |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, Michael G. Wilson confirmed that ''Casino Royale'' would either be filmed or take place in Prague and South Africa. However, Eon Productions encountered problems in securing film locations in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=John |last=Cox |title=Eon facing South African detour |work=CommanderBond.net |date=8 August 2005 |url=http://commanderbond.net/2877/eon-facing-south-african-detour.html |accessdate=21 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; After no other locations became available, the producers had to reconsider their options. In September 2005, Martin Campbell and [[cinematographer|director of photography]] [[Phil Meheux]] were scouting [[Atlantis Paradise Island|Paradise Island]] in the Bahamas as a possible location for the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=John |last=Cox |title=Bond bound for Bahamas |date=13 September 2005 |work=CommanderBond.net |url=http://commanderbond.net/2922/bond-bound-for-bahamas.html |accessdate=21 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 October 2005, Martin Campbell confirmed that ''Casino Royale'' would film in the Bahamas and "maybe Italy". In addition to the extensive location filming, studio work including choreography and stunt coordination practice was performed at the Barrandov Studios in Prague and at Pinewood Studios where the film used several stages as well as the paddock tank and the historic [[007 Stage]]. Further shooting in the UK was scheduled for [[Dunsfold Aerodrome]] in Surrey, the cricket pavilion at [[Eton College]] (although that particular scene was cut from the completed movie) and the Millbrook Vehicle Proving Ground in [[Bedfordshire]].&lt;ref name="Location2"/&gt;

After Prague, the production moved to the Bahamas. Several locations around [[New Providence]] were used for filming during February and March, particularly on Paradise Island. Footage set in [[Mbale]], Uganda, was filmed at [[Black Park]], a Country Park in [[Buckinghamshire]], on 4 July 2006. Additional scenes took place at Albany House, an estate owned by golfers [[Ernie Els]] and [[Tiger Woods]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=James Bond takes over Ernie and Tiger's pad |publisher=Ernie Els Official Website |date=12 June 2006 |url=http://www.ernieels.com/search.aspx?i_MediaEntryID=506 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060618111857/http://www.ernieels.com/search.aspx?i_MediaEntryID=506 |archivedate=18 June 2006 |accessdate=21 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crew returned to the Czech Republic in April, and continued there, filming in Prague, [[Planá (Tachov District)|Planá]] and [[Loket (Sokolov District)|Loket]], before completing in the town of [[Karlovy Vary]] in May. A famous Czech [[destination spa|spa]], Karlovy Vary, in German known as the Karlsbad,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Casino Royale: filming locations |work=Movieloci.com |date=19 June 2012 |url=http://www.movieloci.com/851-Casino-Royale |accessdate=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; was used as the exterior of the Casino Royale, with the [[Grandhotel Pupp]] serving as "Hotel Splendide".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=On set report from Casino Royale getaway chase sequence |work=[[MI6.co.uk|MI6-HQ.com]] |date=23 May 2006 |url=http://www.mi6-hq.com/news/index.php?itemid=3701&amp;catid=2 |accessdate=21 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main Italian location was [[Venice]], where the majority of the film's ending is set. Other scenes in the latter half of the film were shot in late May and early June at the [[Villa del Balbianello]] on the shores of [[Lake Como]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=007 Nel Bel Paese |work=Il Giorno |location=Italy |date=25 February 2006 |url=http://qn1.quotidiano.net/chan/musica:5405032:/2006/02/27: |accessdate=20 June 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011102258/http://qn.quotidiano.net/archivio_art.php?art=http%3A%2F%2Fqn.quotidiano.net%2F2006%2F02%2F27%2Fpages%2FartI5405032.html |archivedate=11 October 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further exterior shooting for the movie took place at properties such as the Villa la Gaeta, near the lakeside town of [[Menaggio]].&lt;ref name="Location2"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Blond, James Blond |url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/11/08/commentary/mediabiz/index.htm |publisher=CNN |date=6 November 2006 |accessdate=2 April 2007 | first=Paul R. | last=La Monica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recreation of the [[Body Worlds]] exhibit provided a setting for one scene in the film. Among the Body Worlds plastinates featured in that scene were the ''[http://www.bodyworlds.com/en/media/picture_database/preview.html?id=78 Poker Playing Trio]'' (which plays a key role in one scene) and ''[http://www.bodyworlds.com/en/media/picture_database/preview.html?id=129 Rearing Horse and Rider]''. The exhibition's developer and promoter, German anatomist [[Gunther von Hagens]], also has a cameo appearance in the film,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Press Information &amp; Media News |url= http://www.plastinarium.de/en/media/media_news.html |work=Plastinarium |accessdate=9 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; although only his trademark hat is actually visible on screen.

On 30 July 2006, a fire broke out at the 007 Stage. The damage was significant, but had no effect on the release of ''Casino Royale'' as the incident occurred one week after filming had been completed, and the sets were in the process of being dismantled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Fire wrecks James Bond film stage |work=BBC News |date=30 July 2006 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/5228794.stm |accessdate=21 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 August 2006, Pinewood Studios confirmed that no attempt would be made to salvage the remains of the stage;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=007 stage destroyed by fire |work=[[MI6.co.uk|MI6-HQ.com]] |date=30 July 2006 |url=http://www.mi6-hq.com/sections/articles/event_pinewood_fire.php3?t=bond21&amp;s=bond21 |accessdate=21 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; instead it would be rebuilt from scratch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Pinewood receives planning permission to rebuild 007 stage, bigger than ever next year |work=[[MI6.co.uk|MI6-HQ.COM]] |date=21 September 2006.The scenes set for the music video,"Who Let The Bond Out" |url=http://www.mi6-hq.com/news/index.php?itemid=4114&amp;catid=4 |accessdate=21 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shooting in [[Panama City]] began on 7 February 2008 at [[Howard Air Force Base]]. The country doubled for Haiti and Bolivia, with the National Institute of Culture of Panama standing in for a hotel in the latter country.

While filming in [[Sierra Gorda, Chile]], the local mayor, Carlos Lopez, staged a protest because he was angry at the filmmakers' portrayal of the Antofagasta region as part of Bolivia. He was arrested, detained briefly, and put on trial two days later. Eon dismissed his claim that they needed his permission to film in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Simon Gardner | title = James Bond has new nemesis: irate Chilean mayor | agency=Reuters | date = 2 April 2008 | url = http://uk.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUKN0237294620080402 | accessdate=13 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = 'Mayor' protests on Chile 007 set |publisher=[[BBC News]] | date = 2 April 2008 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7326582.stm | accessdate=3 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael G.

From 4–12 April, the main unit shot on Sienese rooftops.&lt;ref name=fountain/&gt; Shooting on the real rooftops turned out to be less expensive than building them at Pinewood.&lt;ref name=artfilm/&gt; The next four weeks were scheduled for filming the car chase at [[Lake Garda]] and [[Carrara]].&lt;ref name=fountain/&gt; On 19 April, an [[Aston Martin]] employee driving a [[Aston Martin DBS V12|DBS]] to the set crashed into the lake.

Filming took place at the [[Bregenzer Festspiele|floating opera stage]] at [[Bregenz]], Austria, from 28 April – 9 May 2008. The sequence, where Bond stalks the villains during a performance of ''[[Tosca]]'', required 1500 extras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Production Diary (10) | work = [[MI6-HQ.com]] | date = 8 February 2008 | url = http://www.mi6-hq.com/sections/articles/bond_22_prod_diary10.php3?t=qos&amp;s=qos | accessdate=9 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production used a large model of an eye, which Forster felt fitted in the Bond style, and the opera itself has parallels to the film.&lt;ref name=lake&gt;{{cite news|title=Solace on the Lake|publisher=[[MSN]]|date=8 May 2008|url=http://movies.msn.com/movies/hitlist/05-13-08|accessdate=16 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A short driving sequence was filmed at the nearby [[Feldkirch, Vorarlberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Production Diary (1) |work=[[MI6-HQ.com]] |date=3 January 2008|url=http://www.mi6-hq.com/sections/articles/bond_22_prod_diary01.php3?t=&amp;s=articles |accessdate=8 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crew returned to Italy from 13–17 May to shoot a (planned) car crash at the marble quarry in Carrara,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Production Diary (32) | work = [[MI6-HQ.com]] | date = 16 May 2008 | url = http://www.mi6-hq.com/sections/articles/bond_22_prod_diary32.php3?t=qos&amp;s=qos | accessdate=16 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a recreation of the Palio di Siena at the [[Piazza del Campo]] in Siena. 1000 extras were hired for a scene where Bond emerges from the ''Fonte Gaia''.

'''''Guru's Jazzmatazz, Vol. 2: The New Reality''''' is the second [[studio album]] by American [[hip hop music|hip hop]] [[recording artist]] [[Guru (rapper)|Guru]]. This second release to the ''Jazzmatazz'' series slightly toned down the [[jazz rap]] punch that made the first volume memorable. It was nevertheless critically acclaimed in its own right. Guests featured on this release include [[Freddie Hubbard]], [[Donald Byrd]], [[Ramsey Lewis]], [[Kool Keith]], [[Patra (singer)|Patra]] and [[Jamiroquai]]; other musicians reprising their roles from the previous release include [[Branford Marsalis]], [[Courtney Pine]] and [[Ronny Jordan]].

According to [[Billboard magazine|Billboard]] music charts, this album slightly outpeformed its predecessor; it peaked at #16 and #73 on Billboard's "Top R&amp;B / Hip Hop Albums and "Billboard 200" albums charts respectively. The single, "Watch What You Say" (featuring [[Chaka Khan]]), peaked at #13 and #93 on the Billboard's "Hot Dance Music / Maxi-Singles" and "Hot R&amp;B / Hip Hop Singles &amp; Tracks" charts respectively.

''Jazzmatazz, Vol. 2: The New Reality'' was released on July 18, 1995, via the [[Chrysalis Records|Chrysalis]] imprint.

It focuses on the planning, execution, and aftermath of a [[theft]]. They could be described as the analogues of [[caper story|caper stories]] in [[history of film|film history]]. A typical film includes many [[plot twist]]s, with the focus on the characters' attempts to formulate a plan, carry it out, and escape with the goods. Often a [[Archenemy|nemesis]] must be thwarted, who might be either a figure of authority or else a former partner who turned on the group or one of its members.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21968">The '''International Magicians Society''' ('''IMS''') is the world's largest [[magic (illusion)|magic]] society as recorded in the [[Guinness Book of World Records]]. The IMS began in 1968 and now has over 41,000 members worldwide. It was created to help promote and preserve the art of magic and provide a format where magicians could share their secrets and ideas.

The IMS named [[Siegfried &amp; Roy]] as the Magicians of the Century in 2000 and named [[David Copperfield (illusionist)|David Copperfield]], [[Doug Henning]], [[Harry Blackstone, Jr.]], [[Criss Angel]] and [[David Blaine]] as the most influential magicians of the past 25 years. The organization awards the Merlin Awards, every three years. "Every three years, the International Magicians Society hosts a banquet dinner, where those magicians who have achieved the highest level in their craft are awarded the coveted Merlin Award. The voting members begin with approximately one hundred names and narrows down to a handful. The criteria that the voting members consider are talent, showmanship, originality, skills, and above all the rare ability to entertain under any conditions."&lt;ref name=imswebsite&gt;[http://imsmagic.com/Merlin_Award.php "Merlin Awards"], Retrieved 2 Oct 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Merlin Award==
The '''Merlin Award''' is given to magicians in recognition of their contributions to the performance and creation of magic around the world. While sometimes called the [[Academy Award]]s of magic, the Merlin Award lacks much of the oversight that enhance the credibility of awards in other industries.&lt;ref name=unofficialarchive&gt;{{cite web|last=Ellis|first=Tim|title=Merlin Awards: Controversy|url=http://merlinawards.wordpress.com/controversy/|publisher=The Unofficial Archives of the Merlin Awards|accessdate=2 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The award was created by [[Tony Hassini]] and his International Magicians Society and is given out to invited guests at triennial banquets as well as in person by Hassini himself with greater frequency.&lt;ref name=merlineawards&gt;{{cite web|last=Hassini|first=Tony|title=Merlin Awards|url=http://merlinawards.wordpress.com/controversy/|publisher=International Magicians Society|accessdate=2 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===

&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imsmagic.com/Merlin_Award.php |title=Merlin award Criteria- IMS|publisher=imsmagic.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The award is intended to be a recognition for magicians who perform at the highest level of skills on national and international stages. Merlin award can be obtained in three ways.One is to attend Merlin Award banquet dinner on invitation, after being voted to receive the prize. Another is by participating and winning a Merlin Award competition organized by IMS and held in different countries. Third way is for the organizers to travel to the magician’s country to present the award there. The criteria considered are talent, showmanship, originality, skills, and an ability to entertain under any conditions.

===Design===
The award statue was commissioned to over 100 art students in a nationwide search. The winning design was created by Carol Michaud, a New York University art student, in 1968.

in May 2016, Hany show received the Prestigious Merlin Award as " Best Stage Magic Middle East 2016.

Merlin Awards are not listed with either category or date:

''"Sometimes, I am asked why don’t we publish the year and category for each magician’s Merlin Award on our website. The fact is that when the magician receives his award, during the press conference, we announce the category. Thereafter, it serves no purpose to publish the category or the year on our website. Because some categories might sound more glorious than the others, there’s no point of hyping or diminishing anyone’s award or the year they received it. And there’s no point in dating their awards either. The bottom line is everyone who received the Merlin Award is a Merlin Award Recipient period and is entitled to enjoy the glory for the rest of their life without dating or categorizing it.”'' - '''Tony Hassini'''

It has been suggested that the Merlin Awards exist purely to generate publicity for the artist and income for the IMS. Tony Hassini clarifies this in the FAQ page of The International Magicians Society.

''"I’m also asked how do we consider a nominee for the Merlin Award? A magician must send to the IMS World Headquarters a videotape or DVD of his complete act for our Board of Directors to consider. (No promo DVD’s or online videos are accepted.) The other question I am asked is “Are there any costs to receive the Merlin Award?” First, I must say that the Merlin Award is not for sale at any cost. Regarding the actual out-of-pocket cost, this varies from situation to situation. There are three ways a magician can receive the Merlin Award. One is to attend our Merlin Award banquet dinner; this is by invitation only, after the recipient was voted to receive the Merlin Award. Two is to participate and win a Merlin Award competition in different countries, which is organized by IMS with the event and convention organizers. And three is for us to travel to the magician’s country and present the Merlin Award to them in their own country. So let’s look at the cost of the first scenario, which is where the magician must obtain a visa from the American embassy to travel to the USA. He must purchase airline tickets, other travel related costs and fees, hotels, meals, and $500 US dollars per plate at the Merlin Award banquet dinner. In the second scenario, again the magician must travel to the event where the Merlin Award competition is taking place. He pays all of the same travel expenses as mentioned in the first scenario and pays for the entrance fee to the convention or to the competition, whichever applies. In the third scenario, where we have to travel from the USA to the magician’s country, either the magician or the magician’s producer pays for all of the travel expenses, hotels, meals, airlines, and other related expenses. Within any of these three scenarios, it’s always a trade when it comes to the cost. Within any of the three scenarios, our main focus is to generate as much PR as possible with the general public. A good example of this is when we were going to present the Merlin Award to Louis Yan in Hong Kong, we could have presented the award to him in our Hong Kong IMS office. Or we could have had our IMS members meet at a nice Chinese restaurant and present the award to him there. Then we came up with an idea. We approached one of the largest shopping malls in Hong Kong. Not only did they build a custom stage and provided enough seating for the audience, they also provided guards for crowd control. The mall management, with their media contacts, were able to invite newspapers, radio, and television to cover the event. Both the mall and Louis Yan received tremendous PR and public awareness."'' - '''Tony Hassini'''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4274">'''John Stromberg''' ([[Prince Edward Island]], Canada, 1853 - [[New York City]], 1902), was an American songwriter, composer, and conductor born in Canada of Swedish ancestry (name originally "Stramborg"). He was best known for his work in collaboration with lyricist [[Edgar Smith (librettist)|Edgar Smith]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/edgar-smith |title=Edgar Smith: Information from |publisher=Answers.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; on stage shows for the [[Joe Weber (vaudevillian)|Weber]] and [[Lew Fields|Fields]] comedy team.&lt;ref name="musicals101"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicals101.com/1890-1900b.htm |title=1890s: Part II - Weber &amp; Fields, Lillian Russell |publisher=Musicals101.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Weber and Fields began as a two-man show in the genre of ethnic (German) humor. They were a funny man/straight man comedy duo, a precursor to such famous acts as Abbott &amp; Costello and Laurel &amp; Hardy. They later expanded their act into the genre of vaudeville known as "[[Burlesque]]"—musical stage shows that broadly and somewhat raucously parodied other well-known contemporary Broadway shows, without the striptease acts with which the term was later associated.

John "Honey" Stromberg, whose career began formally in Tin Pan Alley, where he worked as an arranger for the Witmark musical publishing house, was already the writer of a popular song hit ("My Girl's a Corker, She's a New Yorker") before becoming the principal composer and orchestra conductor (with [[Edgar Smith (librettist)|Edgar Smith]] the principal writer) for these shows in 1896 with "The Art of Maryland," with which Weber and Fields opened their Music Hall. Stromberg wrote the scores for ten productions, conducting nine of them. His most famous composition (the lyrics, however, credited to Robert B. Smith) was "Come Down Ma Evenin' Star" from ''Twirly Whirly,'' written for the great diva of the day [[Lillian Russell]] and (as the story goes) found in the pocket of Stromberg's coat after he had committed [[suicide]] in July 1902, having ingested [[Paris Green]] insecticide.&lt;ref name="musicals101"/&gt; Stromberg had suffered severely from debilitating (probably rheumatoid) arthritis for several years. Contributing heavily to his troubles was the failure of his investment in "Stromberg Park," a real-estate development in Freeport, Long Island, with streets named after various Weber and Fields performers. He was greatly mourned on Broadway, and at his funeral the band struck up his famous "Come Back Ma Honey Boy to Me." 
"Come Down Ma Evenin' Star"is the only song that Lillian Russell is known to have recorded. Stromberg also wrote "Ma Blushin' Rosie" (also sometimes called "Rosie You Are My Posie") which was part of the repertoire of the legendary [[Al Jolson]], the theme song of the [[Rosemary Clooney]] TV variety show in the 1950s, and even performed in an Abbot and Costello film, The Naughty Nineties." He was one of the outstanding composers of the ragtime era, but his songs have been largely forgotten because most of the best ones were of the genre of so-called "coon songs"—the name itself contains a racial slur, and the genre consisted of songs containing the most blatant racial stereotypes expressed in a "Negro dialect" which makes them highly offensive to modern audiences. Although the offensive matter is entirely contained in Edgar Smith's lyrics, not in Stromberg's music, the music has suffered badly from "guilt by association" with the racist lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first1=Armond |last1=Fields |first2=L.

==Career and work==

Before going to Mozambique, Karen had her own production company in Britain.
She has worked around the world as a sound recordist, producer and director.
In Mozambique she produced many radio features for the [[BBC World Service]].
In 1999 she returned to directing TV documentaries with ''Living Battles'' (1998) and ''From the Ashes'' (1999), both concerning the recently ended civil war. 
''Dancing on the Edge'' (2001) is a movie about the risks facing a young woman coming of age in Mozambique where poverty and traditional practices increase the risk of acquiring HIV/AIDS.
It is the first made by Catembe Productions, her own production company, which produces educational and children's program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Karen Boswall's 2004 ''[[Marrabenta Stories]]'' documents young Mozambican musicians who play jazz, funk and hip-hop joining older men who play the more traditional [[Marrabenta]] dance music on a tour of South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Research into a joint project with Jose Eduardo Agualusa to make a film with a strong element of music about the situation of women in the cone of southern Africa, to be called "My Father's Wives", became the basis for a 2008 book by that name by Agualusa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:X-Team Masters of Disaster (promotional poster).jpg|thumb|Promotional poster]]
The '''Masters of Disaster''' are an [[airshow]] team that performs aerobatics in a combination with ground-based jet-propelled trucks and pyrotechnics. The group is known for the improvisational and often unscripted performances they give. The show once included a jet-propelled [[biplane]].

Two of the team's founding members, ([[Jimmy Franklin]] and Bobby Younkin), were killed in a crash during a performance at [[Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan]], on July 10, 2005.

The team re-grouped and began to perform airshows again in 2005.  Two years later the team leader, [[Jim LeRoy]], died at the [[Dayton Air Show]] on July 28, 2007 performing an exhibition they called ''Codename:Maryslamb''.  His [[Pitts Special]] aircraft crashed into the runway and slid for approximately 300 yards before becoming engulfed in flames.  LeRoy died en route to the hospital from the injuries he sustained when his aircraft impacted the ground at high speed.

The team, in 2007, performed two shows, entitled ''Tinstix'' and ''Codename:Maryslamb''.

The team began to perform a new act in 2014 entitled "The Immortals", which featured Kyle Franklin, Skip Stewart, Melissa Pemberton, Neal Darnell, Chris Darnell and Paul Stender.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12500">'''Music of ''The X-Files'' franchise''' is composed and written by American [[Mark Snow]]; the franchise was created by [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]]. Snow has composed the music for all the franchise main releases (etc. television shows and films). Together with the show, the music was positively met by critics and viewers of the show alike. Snow has been nominated with over twenty awards and nominations for his music on the various franchise releases, but notably ''The X-Files''. Among the most famous compositions of the franchise is the theme song for ''The X-Files''. The theme was a top ten hit in the United Kingdom, peaking at number two on the [[UK Singles Chart]].

With ''[[The X-Files]]'' peaking in popularity in the mid-to-late 1990s, the music did too. When the show was hitting its peak in popularity, Carter created a [[Spin-off (media)|spin off]] to the series, entitled ''[[Millennium (TV series)|Millennium]]'' which aired from 1996–1999. While never gaining as much attention as ''The X-Files'', the show's theme song and soundtrack releases were well received by critics. ''[[The Lone Gunmen (TV series)|The Lone Gunmen]]'' is the last television spin off of ''The X-Files'' which only aired for around two months. A soundtrack of the original music has been released in a set with music from Carter's other short lived Science Fiction series [[Harsh Realm]]. Snow returned to compose music for the [[media franchise|franchise]] with the film, ''[[The X-Files: I Want to Believe]]''.

== ''The X-Files'' ==

=== Early conception and series (1993–2002) ===
[[Mark Snow]] got involved with ''The X-Files'', since he was a good friend of [[executive producer]] [[R.W. Goodwin]]. When the production staff was talking about who was going to take the composing duties for the series, [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] didn't know who to ask, in total about "10–15" people were looked at. But Goodwin pressed for Snow being the show's [[composer]]. Snow auditioned around three times, but didn't get any signs from the production staff if they wanted him. One day, Snow's agent called talking about the [[The X-Files (pilot episode)|pilot episode]], and hinted that he had got the part. At first Snow wasn't sure if he wanted to work on ''The X-Files'', giving the reason that he felt they were "weird". So Snow eventually started to compose his music in [[Los Angeles, California]], in which he would continue until the show's end.&lt;ref name="Music"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.soundtrack.net/features/article/?id=19 |title=The S Files |publisher=Soundtrack.net |accessdate=June 6, 2009|date=May 27, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the start, Carter and the producers wanted Snow to heavily use [[synthesizers]] when composing his music, to sustain a "type A atmosphere ambient sound design". Snow had commented that after a while he got tired with this, and wanted to make a new musical direction for the show. He then started to do more "musical" work, such as creating more "melodies" for his songs.&lt;ref name="Music"/&gt; When composing the music for the show, the monster-of-the-week episodes, Snow got a lot more "freedom" when compared to the [[Mythology of The X-Files|mytharc episodes]] which were much more "traditional" and conservative in its approach. Carter and the production crew gave Snow much freedom to compose his own music, rarely if ever giving him any notes on how he would record or compose his music for the series; when he was given notes they would be in a more basic form such as "too much" or "too loud", according to Snow.&lt;ref name="I_Want_to_Believe"/&gt;

When creating the music for [[The X-Files (film)|''The X-Files'' film]], Snow had a couple of months to write and to produce the music while he also created the music for the television show. The first film marked the first time the music for the franchise was composed and recorded with help from an [[orchestra]]. According to Snow, the recording and writing process didn't change during the making of the film. The biggest difference was that he used [[MIDI]] files to save his musical scores and pieces, which would go to a copyist who would take it through one of their programs and eventually give it to the orchestrators.&lt;ref name="I_Want_to_Believe"/&gt;

The [[The X-Files (season 6)|sixth season]] episode "[[The Unnatural (The X-Files)|The Unnatural]]" marked the first time in the series that the show recorded the score with musicians rather than synthesizers. Slide guitar player Nick Kirgo and harmonica player Tommy Morgan assisted Snow with the score.&lt;ref&gt;Meisler, Andy (2000). The End and the Beginning: The Official Guide to the X-Files Volume 5. Harper Prism. p. 262-263.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[The X-Files (season 7)|seventh season]] episode "[[Closure (The X-Files)|Closure]]", [[Mark Snow]]'s music was not used, being replaced by [[Moby]]'s "My Weakness". Carter never told Snow about this change. While Snow has been confirmed to be more positive to it than negative, saying it fit "perfect", and further stating, "Every once in a while, when Chris would pick out a pop song or whatever, he would always make really great choices and I thought that was a good one."&lt;ref name="I_Want_to_Believe"/&gt;

"[[Within (The X-Files)|Within]]", the [[The X-Files (season 8)|season eight]] premiere, was the first of six episodes to feature the song "Scully's Theme". The other five were "[[Without (The X-Files)|Without]]", "[[Per Manum]]", "[[This Is Not Happening]]", "[[Deadalive]]" and the [[season finale]] "[[Existence (The X-Files)|Existence]]". The song features a solo female voice that repeats the distorted words "We are near" over and over. According to Carter, it is one of the greatest things that series composer Snow has ever done. Carter himself admitted to "tweaking" the song a little, adding the three words that are repeated over and over, with the idea to "distort" them.&lt;ref name="Characterprofile"&gt;{{cite video |people=[[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Carter, Chris]], [[Robert Patrick|Patrick, Robert]], [[Mark Snow|Snow, Mark]], [[Frank Spotnitz|Spotnitz, Frank]] and [[Annabeth Gish|Gish, Annabeth]] |date=2001 |title=The Truth Behind Season 8 |medium= DVD |publisher=[[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment|Fox Home Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''I Want to Believe'' (2008) ===
After ''The X-Files'' was cancelled in 2002, [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] and his crew started working with a goal of releasing a second ''X-Files'' film. In 2003, Carter called Snow, who by that time lived in [[London]], [[United Kingdom|UK]] and said he wanted him to return for another film. Snow was positive to the idea, but filming got bogged down by contract issues between [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] and Carter. Once the contract issues were sorted out, Carter re-contacted Snow about the development and later on sent him the script for the film. Carter and his production crew wanted as much secrecy for the film as possible, forcing Snow to sign a contract when receiving the script. Snow wrote a couple of [[demo (music)|demo]]s at the start, in which Carter and [[Frank Spotnitz]] were not to pleased about, but it eventually worked out when Snow re-recorded them.&lt;ref name="I_Want_to_Believe"/&gt;

When composing the music for ''[[The X-Files: I Want to Believe]]'', Snow said it was "different" from the [[The X-Files (film)|previous film]] which followed the show's [[Mythology of The X-Files|mytharc storyline]] about the [[Syndicate (The X-Files)|government conspiracy]] with [[Colonist (The X-Files)|aliens]]. He said it was much "more heart, warmth and tuneful music" since this film was much more based around [[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]) and [[Dana Scully]]'s ([[Gillian Anderson]]) relationship.&lt;ref name="I_Want_to_Believe"/&gt;

Snow recorded the score with the [[Hollywood Studio Symphony]] in May 2008 at the Newman Scoring Stage at 20th Century Fox in Century City, California.&lt;ref name=scoring&gt;{{cite news | author=Dan Goldwasser | url=http://www.scoringsessions.com/news/143 | title=Mark Snow scores ''The X-Files: I Want to Believe'' | publisher=ScoringSessions.com | date=May 30, 2008 |accessdate=July 27, 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt; No music was written out during Snow's recording season with the symphony orchestra. When making the music, Snow used many instruments such as a "battery of percussion", taiko drums and [[whistle]] with live singers, among other things. It took four days to record and writing music for and with the orchestra. He used no [[trumpet]]s and no high [[woodwind]]s when recording, but used up to  eight [[french horns]], five [[trombones]], two [[piano]], one [[harp]], thirty-two [[violin]]s, sixteen [[violas]] twelve [[cello]]s and eight [[Bass guitar|basses]].&lt;ref name="I_Want_to_Believe"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/37203|title=ScoreKeeper With Composer Mark Snow About THE X-FILES: I WANT TO BELIEVE, The Creation Of The Series' Theme, And Much More!! |publisher=Ain't It Cool |date=June 24, 2008|accessdate=August 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British performers [[UNKLE]] recorded a new version of the theme music for the end credits to the movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://movies.yahoo.com/mv/news/va/20080627/121462342200.html|title="X-Files" theme gets a fresh spin for summer film|publisher=Yahoo!

Mark Snow also comments that the fast percussion featured in some tracks was inspired by the track 'Prospectors Quartet' from the ''[[There Will Be Blood]]'' soundtrack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=[[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Carter, Chris]] and [[Mark Snow|Snow, Mark]] |date=2005 |title=Trust No One Documentary |medium= DVD |publisher=[[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment|Fox Home Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; UNKLE's song "Broken" was also included in the end credits.

== ''Millennium'' ==
The [[theme music]] for ''[[Millennium (TV series)|Millennium]]'' was created by [[Mark Snow]]. A popular belief amongst fans is that the theme song was inspired by [[Kylie Minogue]]'s [[dance-pop]] song "[[Confide In Me]]". In reality, [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] allegedly sent him a traditional Scottish [[céilidh]] song.&lt;ref name="OrderChaoes"&gt;{{cite video |people=[[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Carter, Chris]], [[Brittany Tiplady|Tiplady, Brittany]], [[Terry O'Quinn|O'Quinn, Terry]], [[Lance Henriksen|Henriksen, Lance]] and [[Megan Gallagher|Gallagher, Megan]] |date=2004 |title= Order in Chaos, Making Millennium Season One |medium= DVD |publisher=[[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment|Fox Home Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception and legacy ==
"[[The X-Files (song)|The X-Files]]" theme music went straight to #2 on March 30, 1996, on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and stayed there for three weeks, then kept on dropping.&lt;ref name="UK"&gt;{{cite web |title="The X-Files", UK Singles Chart |url=http://www.chartstats.com/songinfo.php?id=23946 |publisher=Chartstats.com |accessdate=August 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In France, the single entered the chart at #42 on April 6, 1996, climbed quickly until reaching #2 four weeks later. It remained blocked for five weeks at this position, behind [[Robert Miles]]'s hit "[[Children (Robert Miles song)|Children]]", then topped the chart for a sole week, becoming the second instrumental number-one hit, before climbing. It totalled 1 weeks in the top ten and 30 weeks in the top 50. The single was re-charted from October 1998, but remained in low positions. It is the 754th best-selling single of all time in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Best-sellings singles of all time in France |url=http://www.infodisc.fr/S_ToutTemps.php?debut=750 |publisher=Infodisc.fr |accessdate=August 1, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081113170523/http://www.infodisc.fr/S_ToutTemps.php?debut=750 |archivedate=November 13, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Naturalism''' is a [[Art movement|movement]] in [[Europe]]an [[drama]] and [[theatre]] that developed in the [[Nineteenth-century theatre|late 19th]] and [[Twentieth-century theatre|early 20th]] centuries. It refers to theatre that attempts to create an illusion of reality through a range of dramatic and theatrical strategies. Interest in naturalism especially flourished with the French playwrights of the time, but the most successful example is Strindberg’s play ''[[Miss Julie]]''{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}, which was written with the intention to abide by both his own particular version of naturalism, and also the version described by the French novelist and literary theoretician, [[Émile Zola]].&lt;ref&gt;Madsen, Borge Gedso. ''Strindberg’s Naturalistic Theatre''. Russell &amp; Russell.1962. {{ISBN|0-8462-1729-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zola’s term for naturalism is ''la nouvelle formule''.  The three primary principles of naturalism (''faire vrai, faire grand'' and ''faire simple'') are first, that the play should be realistic, and the result of a careful study of human behaviour and psychology.  The characters should be flesh and blood; their motivations and actions should be grounded in their heredity and environment.  The presentation of a naturalistic play, in terms of the setting and performances, should be realistic and not flamboyant or theatrical.  The single setting of ''Miss Julie'', for example, is a kitchen.  Second, the conflicts in the play should be issues of meaningful, life-altering significance — not small or petty.  And third, the play should be simple — not cluttered with complicated sub-plots or lengthy expositions.&lt;ref&gt;Madsen, Borge Gedso. ''Strindberg’s Naturalistic Theatre''. Russell &amp; Russell.1962. {{ISBN|0-8462-1729-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Darwin|Darwinian]] understandings pervade naturalistic plays, especially in the determining role of the environment on character, and as motivation for behavior.  Naturalism emphasizes everyday speech forms, plausibility in the writing,  (no ghosts, spirits or gods intervening in the human action), a choice of subjects that are contemporary and reasonable (no exotic, otherworldly or fantastic locales, nor historical or mythic time-periods); an extension of the social range of characters portrayed (not only the [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrats]] of classical drama, to include [[bourgeois]] and [[Working class|working-class]] protagonists) and social conflicts; and a style of acting that attempts to recreate the impression of reality.

Naturalism was first advocated explicitly by [[Émile Zola]] in his 1880 essay entitled ''Naturalism on the Stage''.

== Influences ==
Naturalistic writers were influenced by the [[Evolution|theory of evolution]] of [[Charles Darwin]].&lt;ref name="keywords"&gt;Williams (1976, 217).&lt;/ref&gt; They believed that one's [[heredity]] and [[social environment]] determine one's character. Whereas [[Realism (theatre)|realism]] seeks only to describe subjects as they really are, naturalism also attempts to determine "scientifically" the underlying forces (i.e. the environment or heredity) influencing the actions of its subjects. Naturalistic works are opposed to [[romanticism]], in which subjects may receive highly symbolic, idealistic, or even supernatural treatment. They often include uncouth or sordid subject matter; for example, [[Émile Zola]]'s works had a frankness about sexuality along with a pervasive pessimism. Naturalistic works exposed the dark harshness of life, including poverty, racism, sex, prejudice, disease, prostitution, and filth. As a result, Naturalistic writers were frequently criticized for being too blunt.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="141043">'''Pay-per-view (PPV)''' is a type of [[pay television]] service by which a subscriber of a television service provider can purchase events to view via private telecast. The broadcaster shows the event at the same time to everyone ordering it (as opposed to [[video on demand|video-on-demand]] systems, which allow viewers to see recorded broadcasts at any time). Events can be purchased using an on-screen guide, an automated telephone system, or through a live [[customer service representative]]. Events often include [[feature film]]s, [[sport]]ing events, and other [[entertainment]] programs. With the rise of the Internet, the term Internet pay-per-view (iPPV) has been used to describe pay-per-view services accessed online. PPV is most commonly used to distribute [[combat sports]] events, such as [[boxing]] and [[mixed martial arts]], and sports entertainment such as [[professional wrestling]].

==History==
The earliest form of pay-per-view was [[closed-circuit television]], also known as [[theatre television]], where [[professional boxing]] telecasts were broadcast live to a select number of venues, mostly theaters, where viewers paid for tickets to watch the fight live.&lt;ref name="Ezra"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ezra|first=Michael|title=The Economic Civil Rights Movement: African Americans and the Struggle for Economic Power|date=2013|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=9781136274756|page=105|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DL41bsCigZcC&amp;pg=PA105|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bloodyelbow"&gt;{{cite news|title=History of Prizefighting's Biggest Money Fights|url=https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2017/8/24/16170894/history-of-prizefightings-biggest-money-fights-boxing-mma-ufc|work=[[Bloody Elbow]]|agency=[[SB Nation]]|date=August 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first fight with a closed-circuit telecast was [[Joe Louis]] vs. [[Jersey Joe Walcott]] in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Television|date=1965|publisher=Frederick A. Kugel Company|page=78|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=it0aAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=Louis+Walcott|language=en|quote=Teleprompter's main-spring, Irving B. Kahn (he's chairman of the board and president), had a taste of closed circuit operations as early as 1948. That summer, Kahn, then a vice president of 20th Century-Fox, negotiated what was probably the first inter-city closed circuit telecast in history, a pickup of the Joe Louis-Joe Walcott fight.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Closed-circuit telecasts peaked in popularity with [[Muhammad Ali]] in the 1960s and 1970s,&lt;ref name="Ezra"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bloodyelbow"/&gt; with "[[The Rumble in the Jungle]]" fight drawing 50{{nbsp}}million buys worldwide in 1974,&lt;ref name="The Morning Herald"&gt;{{cite news|title=Zaire's fight promotion opens new gold mines|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/28336306/|work=[[The Morning Herald]]|date=November 18, 1974|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the "[[Thrilla in Manila]]" drawing 100{{nbsp}}million buys worldwide in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Karriem Allah|journal=[[Black Belt (magazine)|Black Belt]]|date=1976|page=35|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XtUDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA35|publisher=Active Interest Media, Inc.|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Closed-circuit television was gradually replaced by pay-per-view home television in the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref name="bloodyelbow"/&gt;

===United States===
The Zenith [[Phonevision]] system became the first home pay-per-view system to be tested in the United States. Developed in 1951, it used [[telephone]] lines to take and receive orders, as well as to descramble a television broadcast signal. The field tests conducted for Phonevision lasted for 90 days and were tested in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. The system used [[IBM]] [[punched card|punch card]]s to descramble a signal broadcast during the broadcast station's "[[Dark (broadcasting)|off-time]]". Both systems showed promise, but the [[Federal Communications Commission]] denied them the permits to operate.&lt;ref&gt;FCC Squares Off to Face Subscription TV Dilemma", ''Broadcasting-Telecasting'', November 15, 1954, p31-32&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest pay-per-view systems on [[cable television]], the Optical Systems-developed [[Channel 100]], first began service in 1972 in [[San Diego]], [[California]] through Mission Cable&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mullen|first=Megan Gwynne|authorlink=|title= The Rise of Cable Programming in the United States: revolution or evolution?|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=c0ZYdOP8unIC&amp;dq=alan+greenstadt+channel+100|accessdate=|year= 2003|publisher= University of Texas Press|location=|isbn= 0-292-75273-3|oclc=|doi=|bibcode=|page=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (which was later acquired by [[Cox Communications]]) and TheaterVisioN, which operated out of [[Sarasota, Florida|Sarasota]], [[Florida]]. These early systems quickly went out of business, as the cable industry adopted [[communications satellite|satellite]] technology and as flat-rate pay television services such as Home Box Office ([[HBO]]) became popular.

While most pay-per-view services were delivered via cable, there were a few over-the-air pay TV stations that offered pay-per-view broadcasts in addition to regularly scheduled broadcasts of movies and other entertainment. These stations, which operated for a few years in Chicago, Los Angeles and some other cities, broadcast "scrambled" signals that required descrambler devices to convert the signal into standard broadcast format. These services were marketed as "ON-TV."

The first home pay-per-view [[cable television]] broadcast was the [[Floyd Patterson]] vs. [[Ingemar Johansson]] rematch in 1960, when 25,000 [[TelePrompTer Corporation|TelePrompTer]] subscribers mailed $2 to watch Patterson regain the heavyweight title.&lt;ref name="brooks"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brooks|first=Ken|title=Ingemar Johansson: Swedish Heavyweight Boxing Champion|date=2016|publisher=[[McFarland &amp; Company|McFarland]]|isbn=9781476620237|page=150|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uGQuCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA150|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third Patterson{{ndash}}Johansson match in 1961 was later viewed by 100,000 paid cable subscribers.&lt;ref name="lake"&gt;{{cite news|title=Floyd Favored 18-5 to Send Swede Home with Lumpy Head|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/21287459/|work=[[Daily Inter Lake]]|date=March 13, 1961|language=en|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muhammad Ali had several fights on early pay-per-view home television, including [[Cassius Clay vs. Doug Jones]] in 1963,&lt;ref name="Traverse City Record-Eagle"&gt;{{cite news|title=Clay-Jones Fight First Garden Sellout in 13 Yrs|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/54847931/|work=[[Traverse City Record-Eagle]]|date=March 13, 1963|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Muhammad Ali vs. Sonny Liston]]&lt;ref name="broadcasting"/&gt; which drew 250,000 buys on cable television in 1964.&lt;ref name="Ezra83"/&gt;

[[Professional boxing]] was largely introduced to pay-per-view cable television with the "[[Thrilla in Manila]]" fight between [[Muhammad Ali]] and [[Joe Frazier]] in September 1975. The fight sold 500,000 pay-per-view buys on HBO.&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt; There was also another major title fight aired on pay-per-view in 1980, when [[Roberto Durán]] defeated [[Sugar Ray Leonard]]. Cable companies offered the match for $10, and about 155,000 customers paid to watch the fight.&lt;ref name="askmen"&gt;{{cite web|author=Steve Seepersaud |url=http://ca.askmen.com/sports/business_60/99_sports_business.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310081737/http://ca.askmen.com/sports/business_60/99_sports_business.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-03-10 |title=Money in Boxing: The Pay-Per-View Craze |publisher=Ca.askmen.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Steve Seepersaud |url=https://www.youtube.com/user/93599Productions |title=Money in Boxing: The Pay-Per-View Craze |publisher=Ca.askmen.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1980s{{ndash}}2000s====
A major pay-per-view event{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} occurred on September 16, 1981, when [[Sugar Ray Leonard]] [[Sugar Ray Leonard vs. Thomas Hearns|fought]] [[Thomas Hearns|Thomas "Hitman" Hearns]] for the [[World Welterweight Champion]]ship. Viacom Cablevision in [[Nashville]], [[Tennessee]] – the first system to offer the event – saw over 50 percent of its subscriber base purchase the fight.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Leonard visited Nashville to promote the fight, and the event proved such a success that Viacom themed its [[annual report]] for that year around it.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Viacom marketing director Pat Thompson put together the fight, and subsequently put together additional PPV fights, wrestling matches, and even a televised Broadway play.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

After leaving Viacom, Thompson became head of Sports View and produced the first pay-per-view [[American football|football]] game on October 16, 1983, a [[college football]] game between the [[Tennessee Volunteers football|University of Tennessee]] and the [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|University of Alabama]] from [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], [[Alabama]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Sports View played a role in building pay-per-view networks,{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} and became the early pioneer in developing TigerVision for [[LSU Tigers football|Louisiana State University]], TideVision for Alabama and UT Vol Seat for Tennessee. Sports View also produced the [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State]]-[[Michigan Wolverines football|Michigan]] football game for pay-per-view in November 1983.

In 1985, the first pay-per-view cable channels in the United States – Viewer's Choice (now [[In Demand]]), [[Cable Video Store]], First Choice and [[Request TV]] – began operation within days of each other.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Viewer's Choice serviced both home satellite dish and cable customers, while Request TV, though broadcasting to cable viewers, would not become available to satellite subscribers until the 1990s.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} First Choice PPV was available on Rogers Cablesystems in the United States and [[Canada]]. After [[Paragon Cable]] acquired the Rogers Cablesystems franchise in [[San Antonio]], [[Texas]], First Choice continued to be carried until [[Time Warner Cable]] bought Paragon in 1996. In the United States, pay-per-view broadcasters transmit without advertisements, similar to conventional flat-rate pay television services.

The term "pay-per-view" did not come into general use until the late 1980s{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} &lt;!-- what did people call the technology before that? --&gt; when companies such as Viewer's Choice, HBO and [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] started using the system to show movies and some of their productions. Viewer's Choice carried movies, concerts and other events, with live sporting events such as [[WrestleMania]] being the most predominant programming. Prices ranged from [[United States dollar|$]]3.99 to $49.99, while HBO and Showtime, with their event production [[swap (finance)|leg]]s TVKO and SET Pay Per View, would offer championship [[boxing]] matches ranging from $14.99 to $54.99.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

[[ESPN]] later began to televise [[college]] [[American football|football]] and [[basketball]] games on pay-per-view through its services [[ESPN GamePlan]] and [[ESPN Full Court]], which were eventually sold as full-time [[out-of-market sports package]]s.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} The [[boxing]] [[undercard]] ''Latin Fury'', shown on June 28, 2003, became ESPN's first boxing [[Card (sports)|card]] on pay-per-view and also the first pay-per-view boxing card held in [[Puerto Rico]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Pay-per-view has provided a [[revenue stream]] for [[professional wrestling]] circuits such as [[WWE]], [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] (TNA), [[Ring of Honor]] (ROH) and [[Lucha Libre AAA World Wide]] (AAA).

WWE chairman and [[chief executive officer]] [[Vince McMahon]] is considered by many as one of the icons of pay-per-view promotion. McMahon owns the [[domain name]] payperview.com, which redirects to the [[WWE Network]] website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whois.domaintools.com/payperview.com |title=PayPerView.com – WWE Online Pay-Per-View |publisher=Whois.domaintools.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====HBO PPV (professional boxing)====
In 2006, HBO generated 3.7 million pay-per-view [[Trade|buy]]s with $177 million in gross sales. The only year with more buys previously, 1999, had a total of 4 million. The former record fell in 2007 when HBO sold 4.8 million PPV buys with $255 million in sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/boxing/news/story?id=3158134 |title=Mayweather-Hatton pay-per-view a smashing success |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2007-12-17 |accessdate=2011-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, HBO generated 59.3 million buys and $3.1 billion in revenue since its 1991 debut with Evander Holyfield-George Foreman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dan Rafael|url=http://www.espn.com/blog/dan-rafael/post/_/id/12732/mayweather-pacquiao-on-ppv-a-perfect-storm|title=Mayweather-Pacquiao on PPV 'a perfect storm'|publisher=ESPN|date=April 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1999 differed radically from 2006: 1999 saw four major fight cards: De La Hoya-Trinidad (1.4 million buys), Holyfield-Lewis I (1.2 million), Holyfield-Lewis II (850,000) and De La Hoya-Quartey (570,000). By contrast, only one pay-per-view [[mega-fight]] took place in 2006: De La Hoya-Mayorga (925,000 buys). Rahman-Maskaev bombed with under 50,000. The other eight PPV cards that year all fell in the 325,000–450,000 range. Pay-per-view fights in that range almost always generate more money for the promoter and fighters than HBO wants to pay for an HBO World Championship Boxing license-fee.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

In May 2007, the super-welterweight boxing match between [[Oscar De La Hoya vs. Floyd Mayweather Jr.]] on HBO PPV became the biggest-selling non-heavyweight title fight, with a little more than 2.5 million buyers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/sports-tv-ratings-how-many-people-watched-mayweather-vs-pacquiao-kentucky-derby-nfl-1907833|title=Sports TV Ratings: How Many People Watched Mayweather vs. Pacquiao, The Kentucky Derby And NFL Draft?|date=2015-05-04|access-date=2016-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fight itself generated roughly {{US$|139 million|long=no}} in domestic PPV revenue, making it the most lucrative prizefight of that era. The record stood until 2015 before it was broken by [[Floyd Mayweather, Jr. vs. Manny Pacquiao]] in a fight dubbed as the "Fight of the Century" on May 2, 2015 which generated 4.6 million ppv buys and a revenue of over $400 million.&lt;ref name="boxingscene2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/hbos-taffet-still-stunned-by-46m-buys-pac--97976|title=HBO’s Taffet Still Stunned By 4.6M Buys For May-Pac|publisher=BoxingScene|date=November 10, 2015|accessdate=May 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The leading PPV attraction, [[Floyd Mayweather Jr.]] has generated approximately 24.8 million buys and $1.3 billion in revenue. [[Manny Pacquiao]], ranked second, has generated approximately 19.2 million buys and $1.2 billion in revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kurt Badenhausen|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2016/04/09/manny-pacquiao-set-to-retire-with-500-million-in-career-earnings/#5f4ff5866f25|title=Manny Pacquiao Set To Retire After Bradley Fight With $500 Million In Career Earnings|publisher=Forbes|date=April 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boxingjunkie.usatoday.com/2016/11/15/bob-arum-manny-pacquiao-jessie-vargas-fight-300k-ppv-buys/|title=USA TODAY: Latest World and US News  - USATODAY.com|website=USA TODAY|accessdate=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oscar De La Hoya]], has "sold" approximately 14 million [[wikt:unit|unit]]s in total, giving $700 million in domestic television receipts and stands third.

Ross Greenburg, then president of HBO Sports, called the expansion of pay-per-view "the biggest economic issue in boxing", stating "I can't tell you that pay-per-view helps the sport because it doesn't. It hurts the sport because it narrows our audience, but it's a fact of life. Every time we try to make an HBO World Championship Boxing fight, we're up against mythical pay-per-view numbers. HBO doesn't make a lot of money from pay-per-view. There's usually a cap on what we can make. But the promoters and fighters insist on pay-per-view because that's where their greatest profits lie."&lt;ref name="The Boxing Scene"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VfvqxXaJcKEC&amp;pg=PA133&amp;lpg=PA133&amp;dq=%22put+fighters+like+Manny+Pacquiao+on+HBO+World%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3AtoCILmkn&amp;sig=14hJ-ZUeJAFiN6nsJalKUP8PbM8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=QMa-To-UIvDJ0AHGsKzaBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22put%20fighters%20like%20Manny%20Pacquiao%20on%20HBO%20World%22&amp;f=false The Boxing Scene] By Thomas Hauser&lt;/ref&gt;

"It's a big problem," Greenburg continues. "It's getting harder and harder to put fighters like Manny Pacquiao on HBO World Championship Boxing. If Floyd Mayweather beats Oscar, he might never fight on HBO World Championship Boxing again. But if HBO stopped doing pay-per-view, the promoters would simply do it on their own [like Bob Arum did with Cotto-Malignaggi in June 2006] or find someone else who will do it for them."&lt;ref name="The Boxing Scene"/&gt;

Former HBO Sports President Seth Abraham concurs, saying, "I think, if Lou (DiBella) and I were still at HBO, we'd be in the same pickle as far as the exodus of fights to pay-per-view is concerned."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.secondsout.com/usa/colhauser.cfm?ccs=208&amp;cs=21089] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070126235411/http://www.secondsout.com/usa/colhauser.cfm?ccs=208&amp;cs=21089|date=January 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship)====
[[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] (UFC), a relative newcomer on the pay-per-view scene, matched the once-dominant [[World Wrestling Entertainment]] Inc. in pay-per-view revenues during 2006 and surpassed boxing titan HBO. The three companies make up the bulk of the pay-per-view business.  According to Deana Myers, a senior analyst at Kagan Research LLC (which tracks the PPV industry), "UFC has reinvigorated the pay-per-view category."&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, Adam. [http://www.boston.com/business/articles/2007/02/28/extreme_fight_on_for_pay_per_view_crown/ "Extreme fight on for pay-per-view crown"], Associated Press, 28 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Professional wrestling====
[[Professional wrestling]] has a long history of running pay-per-view events. [[WWE]] (then WWF) launched its first pay-per-view event in 1985 with [[The Wrestling Classic]] and has run numerous others throughout the years. Other major organisations such as [[WCW]], [[Extreme Championship Wrestling|ECW]] and [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling|TNA]] have also run pay-per-view events.

Although it still offers its events via traditional pay-per-view outlets, since 2014 WWE has offered all of its PPV events at no additional charge as part of a subscription-based streaming service known as [[WWE Network]]—which features on-demand access to library content and other exclusive programming. Following [[WrestleMania 34]], the service had 2.12 million subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Berkman |first=Seth|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/31/business/media/the-body-slam-is-buffering.html |title=WWE Network Is Loud Introduction to the Video Streaming Ring |work=The New York Times |date=March 30, 2014 |accessdate=August 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/business/article/WrestleMania-34-sets-Superdome-record-12818488.php|title=WrestleMania 34 sets Superdome, network records|date=2018-04-09|work=Stamford Advocate|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other events====
In 2015, with the [[Fare Thee Well: Celebrating 50 Years of the Grateful Dead]] the pay-per-view set a new record for a music event with more than 400,000 subscriptions, surpassing a 1999 simulcast by the Backstreet Boys which drew 160,000 subscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;Zumberge, Marianne (July 25, 2015).

===United Kingdom and Ireland===
Viewers in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Ireland]] can access pay-per-view via satellite, cable and [[IPTV|over-the-internet]] television services, mainly for films, boxing and [[WWE|American professional wrestling]] via services such as [[Sky Box Office]] and more recently [[ITV Box Office]] and [[BT Sport Box Office]]. The last couple of years has seen the number of pay-per-view boxing events significantly increase and currently all of the UK's top fights are only available via pay-per-view. Broadcasters (most notably [[PremPlus]]) have abandoned their aspirations to introduce PPV into other sports market due to poor take-up.

===Canada===
In [[Canada]], most specialty television providers provide pay-per-view programming through one or more services. In all cases, prices typically range from around [[Canadian dollar|C$]]4.99 (for movies) up to $50 or more for special events.

Initially, there were three major PPV providers in Canada; [[Viewers Choice|Viewers Choice Canada]] operated in Eastern Canada as a joint venture of [[Astral Media]], [[Rogers Communications]], and [[The Sports Network|TSN]], while [[Western International Communications]] operated a separate service also branded as Viewers Choice, which used the brand under licence after previously operating as Home Theatre.

Viewers Choice Canada was a partner in a French-language PPV service known as [[Canal Indigo]], which is now entirely owned by [[Videotron]]. [[Bell Canada]] also launched a PPV service for its [[Bell TV|ExpressVu]] television provider known as [[Vu!]] in 1999.

Home Theatre was later acquired by [[Shaw Communications]]; after gaining permission to operate nationally, it re-branded as a [[White-label product|white-label]] PPV known internally as [[Shaw PPV]] in December 2007. In 2014, due to [[Bell Media]]'s majority ownership of Viewers Choice because of its acquisition of Astral, and because both Bell and Rogers now ran their own in-house PPV operations (Vu! and [[Sportsnet PPV]]), Viewers Choice was shut down.&lt;ref name="multinews-vcc-shutdown"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.multichannel.com/news/networks/viewers-choice-canada-winding-down/382680|first=Kent|last=Gibbons|title=Viewers Choice Canada Winding Down: Bell, Rogers-Owned Pay-Per-View Provider Closing Sept. 30|work=[[Multichannel News]]|date=2014-07-22|accessdate=2014-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mainland Europe===
In [[Romania]], cable communications operator UPC Romania has notified the National Audiovisual Council (CNA) on the intention to introduce in January, February 2014 at the latest, an on-demand audiovisual media service called Agerpres. According to the manager of UPC Romania-owned Smaranda Radoi UPC, will allow customers to watch movies on demand or live events; as well as broadcasts of performances, concerts and sporting events.

In November 2008, pay-per-view made its debut in [[Albania]] through [[Digitalb]] on terrestrial and satellite television, with the channel DigiGold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalb.al/ppv/ |title=Digitalb – Pay per View :: Digigold |publisher=Digitalb.al |date= |accessdate=2011-11-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111101235216/http://www.digitalb.al/ppv/ |archivedate=2011-11-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[France]], launched in the late 1990s, Canalsat (Ciné+) and TPS (Multivision) operate their own pay-per-view service. While CanalSat holds the rights to live soccer matches for France's Ligue 1, TPS had the rights for Boxe matches. In 2007, Multivision service ceased by the end of TPS service which merged with Canalsat. Nowadays, Ciné+ is the only existing pay-per-view service in France.

In [[Croatia]], [[Fight Channel]] is broadcasting martial arts events organized by the world's most prominent fighting organizations, such as the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]], [[K-1]], [[HBO Boxing]], Dream, Glory WS, World Series of Boxing etc. and its pay-per-view service covers the [[Balkans]] region.

[[File:Trillium Poncho cat dog.jpg|thumb|A [[Tabby cat|tabby]] [[cat]] and a [[Mixed breed|mixed]] [[Molosser]] [[dog]]]]
A '''pet''' or '''companion animal''' is an [[animal]] kept primarily for a person's company, protection, or entertainment rather than as a [[working animal]], [[livestock]], or [[animal testing|laboratory animal]].  Popular pets are often noted for their attractive appearances, [[intelligence]], and relatable personalities.

Two of the most popular pets are [[dog]]s and [[cat]]s. A cat lover is known as an '''ailurophile''' and a dog lover is known as a '''cynophile'''. Other animals commonly kept include: [[house rabbit|rabbit]]s, [[ferret]]s, [[domestic pig|pig]]s; [[rodent]]s, such as [[gerbil]]s, [[hamster]]s, [[chinchilla]]s, [[fancy rat|rat]]s, and [[guinea pig]]s; [[bird|avian]] pets, such as [[parrot]]s, [[passerine]]s, and [[fowl]]; reptile pets, such as [[turtle]]s, [[lizard]]s and [[snake]]s; [[aquarium|aquatic pets]], such as [[fish]], [[freshwater snail|freshwater]] and [[sea snail|saltwater]] snails, and [[frog]]s; and [[arthropod]] pets, such as [[tarantula]]s and [[hermit crab]]s. Small pets may be grouped together as [[Pocket pet|pocket pets]], while the [[equine]] and [[bovine]] group include the largest companion animals.

Pets provide their owners (or "guardians"&lt;ref name="Guardianship Movement"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.petplanethealth.com/guardian/guardianship-petition/|title=Guardianship Movement|publisher=Pet Planet Health|accessdate=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) both physical and emotional benefits. Walking a dog can provide both the human and the dog with exercise, fresh air, and [[social interaction]]. Pets can give companionship to people who are living alone or elderly adults who do not have adequate social interaction with other people. There is a medically approved class of [[Animal-assisted therapy|therapy animals]], mostly dogs or cats, that are brought to visit confined humans, such as [[Children's hospital|children in hospitals]] or elders in [[nursing homes]]. [[Pet therapy]] utilizes trained animals and handlers to achieve specific physical, social, cognitive or emotional goals with patients.

Some [[scholars]], [[Ethicist|ethicists]] and [[animal rights organizations]] have raised concerns over keeping pets because of the lack of autonomy and objectification of [[non-human|nonhuman]] animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= McRobbie|first=Linda Rodriguez|date=1 August 2017|title=Should we stop keeping pets?

Keeping animals as pets may be detrimental to their health if certain requirements are not met. An important issue is inappropriate feeding, which may produce clinical effects. The consumption of [[chocolate]] or grapes by dogs, for example, may prove fatal.

Certain species of [[houseplant]]s can also prove toxic if consumed by pets. Examples include [[philodendron]]s and [[Lilium longiflorum|Easter lilies]] (which can cause severe kidney damage to cats)&lt;ref name="CFA plants"&gt;{{cite web|title=Plants and Your Cat|url=http://www.cfainc.org/articles/plants.html|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5mq1hjPbF?url=http://www.cfainc.org/articles/plants.html|archivedate=17 January 2010|publisher=Cat Fanciers' Association|accessdate=15 May 2007|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Langston 2002"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Acute Renal Failure Caused by Lily Ingestion in Six Cats|last=Langston|first=Cathy E.|journal=Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association|date=1 January 2002|volume=220|issue=1|pages=49–52, 36|pmid=12680447|doi=10.2460/javma.2002.220.49}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[poinsettias]], [[begonia]], and [[aloe vera]] (which can sicken or, in extreme cases, kill dogs).&lt;ref name="Sunset Plants Poisonous to Dogs"&gt;{{cite web|title=These plants can be poisonous to dogs|url=http://www.sunset.com/garden/flowers-plants/plants-poisonous-to-dogs-00418000068562/|publisher=Sunset Magazine|accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Housepets, particularly dogs and cats in [[Industrialisation|industrialized]] societies, are also highly susceptible to [[obesity]]. Overweight pets have been shown to be at a higher risk of developing diabetes, liver problems, joint pain, kidney failure, and cancer. Lack of exercise and high-caloric diets are considered to be the primary contributors to pet obesity.&lt;ref name="ASPCA Overweight Dogs"&gt;{{cite web|title=Overweight Dogs|url=http://www.aspca.org/pet-care/dog-care/overweight-dogs|work=Pet Care|publisher=The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA)|accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ASPCA Overweight Cats"&gt;{{cite web|title=Overweight Cats|url=http://www.aspca.org/pet-care/cat-care/overweight-cats|work=Pet Care|publisher=The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA)|accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HuffPost Obesity"&gt;{{cite web|last=Zelman|first=Joanna|title=Pet Obesity: Over Half Of U.S. Dogs And Cats Are Overweight, Study Says|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/02/23/pet-obesity-overweight-dogs-cats_n_827017.html|work=Huffington Post|accessdate=17 October 2013|date=23 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pets in long-term care institutions===
People residing in a long-term care facility, such as a hospice or nursing home, may experience health benefits from pets. Pets help them to cope with the emotional issues related to their illness. They also offer physical contact with another living creature, something that is often missing in an elder's life.&lt;ref name="shea-online.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Reinman|first=Steve|title=Therapy Dogs in the Long-Term Health Care Environment|url=http://www.therapydogs.org/documents/Therapy%20Dogs%20in%20the%20Long.pdf|accessdate=27 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pets for nursing homes are chosen based on the size of the pet, the amount of care that the breed needs, and the population and size of the care institution.&lt;ref name="Whiteley1986"/&gt; Appropriate pets go through a screening process and, if it is a dog, additional training programs to become a [[therapy dog]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huculak|first=Chad|title=Super Furry Animals|journal=Edmonton|date=4 October 2006|page=W7}}.

===Connection with community===
In addition to providing health benefits for their owners,  pets also impact the social lives of their owners and their connection to their community.  There is some evidence that pets can facilitate social interaction.&lt;ref&gt;Wood L, Martin K, Christian H, Nathan A, Lauritsen C, Houghton S, Kawachi I, McCune S. The pet factor - Companion animals as a conduit for getting to know people, friendship formation, and social support. PLoS One. 2015:10(4):e0122085&lt;/ref&gt; Assistant Professor of Sociology at the University of Colorado at Boulder, Leslie Irvine has focused her attention on pets of the homeless population. Her studies of [[pet ownership among the homeless]]  found that many modify their life activities for fear of losing their pets. Pet ownership prompts them to act responsibly, with many making a deliberate choice not to drink or use drugs, and to avoid contact with substance abusers or those involved in any criminal activity for fear of being separated from their pet. Additionally, many refuse to house in shelters if their pet is not allowed to stay with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = My Dog Always Eats First: Homeless People and Their Animals|last = Irvine|first = Leslie|publisher = Lynne Rienner Publishers, Inc.|year = 2013|isbn = |location = Boulder, CO|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health risks===
Health risks that are associated with pets include:
* Aggravation of [[allergy|allergies]] and [[asthma]] caused by [[dander]] and [[fur]] or [[feather]]s
* [[Falling (accident)|Falling injuries]]. Tripping over pets, especially dogs causes more than 86,000 falls serious enough to prompt a trip to the emergency room each year in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
|title= In the Home, a Four-Legged Tripwire
|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/28/health/28pets.html?ref=health
|publisher= ''[[The New York Times]]''
|date=27 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among elderly and disabled people, these falls have resulted in life-threatening injuries and broken bones.
* Injury, mauling, and sometimes death caused by pet bites and attacks
* Disease or parasites due to animal hygiene problems, lack of appropriate treatment, and undisciplined behavior (feces and urine)
* Stress caused by the behavior of animals
* Anxiety over who will care for the animal should the owner no longer be able to do so

==Legalities==
States, cities, and towns in [[Western world|Western nations]] commonly enact local ordinances to limit the number or kind of pets a person may keep personally or for business purposes. Prohibited pets may be specific to [[Breed-specific legislation|certain breeds]] (such as [[pit bull]]s or [[Rottweiler]]s), they may apply to general categories of animals (such as [[livestock]], [[Exotic pet|exotic animals]], [[Wildlife|wild animals]], and [[Canid hybrid|canid]] or [[Felid hybrid|felid]] hybrids), or they may simply be based on the animal's size. Additional or different maintenance rules and regulations may also apply. [[Condominium]] associations and owners of [[Lease|rental properties]] also commonly limit or forbid tenants' keeping of pets.

The keeping of animals as pets can cause concerns with regard to animal rights and [[animal welfare|welfare]].&lt;ref name="NhRP About"&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.nonhumanrightsproject.org/about-us-2/|work=NhRP Website|publisher=Nonhuman Rights Project|accessdate=29 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120626085624/http://www.nonhumanrightsproject.org/about-us-2/|archive-date=26 June 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IDA About"&gt;{{cite web|title=About IDA|url=http://www.idausa.org/about-ida/|work=IDA Website|publisher=In Defense of Animals|accessdate=29 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PETA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Animal Rights Uncompromised: 'Pets'|url=http://www.peta.org/about/why-peta/pets.aspx|work=PETA Website|publisher=People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|accessdate=21 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pets have commonly been considered [[property|private property]], [[ownership|owned]] by [[Personhood|individual persons]].

== Environmental impact ==
Pets have a considerable environmental impact, especially in countries where they are common or held in high densities. For instance, the 163 million dogs and cats kept in the United States consume about 20% of the amount of dietary energy that humans do and an estimated 33% of the animal-derived energy.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Okin|first=Gregory S.|date=2 August 2017|title=Environmental impacts of food consumption by dogs and cats|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=12|issue=8|pages=e0181301|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0181301|pmid=28767700|pmc=5540283|issn=1932-6203}}&lt;/ref&gt; They produce about 30% ± 13%, by mass, as much feces as Americans, and through their diet, constitute about 25–30% of the [[environmental impact of meat production|environmental impacts from animal production]] in terms of the use of land, water, fossil fuel, phosphate, and biocides. Dog and cat animal product consumption is responsible for the release of up to 64 ± 16 million tons CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-equivalent methane and nitrous oxide, two powerful [[Greenhouse gas|greenhouse gasses]]. Americans are the largest pet owners in the world, but pet ownership in the US has considerable environmental costs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Types==
[[File: Jenmedia baby bovine 1.jpg|thumb|A young cow]]
[[File:Renardrouxgris.jpg|thumb|The red fox was only recently domesticated]]
While many people have kept many different species of animals in captivity over the course of human history, only a relative few have been kept long enough to be considered [[domestication|domesticated]]. Other types of animals, notably [[monkey]]s, have never been domesticated but are still sold and kept as pets. There are also inanimate objects that have been kept as "pets", either as a form of a game or humorously (e.g. the [[Pet Rock]] or [[Chia Pet]]).

===Domesticated===
[[Domesticated]] pets are the most common types of pet. A ''domesticated animal'' is any animal that has been tamed and made fit for a human environment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Farlex|title=The Free Dictionary by Farlex|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/domestic+animal|accessdate=27 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; by being consistently kept in captivity and [[selective breeding|selectively bred]] over a long enough period of time that it exhibits marked differences in behavior and appearance from its wild relatives.

Wild animals are kept as pets. The term “wild” in this context specifically applies to any species of animal which has not undergone a fundamental change in behavior to facilitate a close co-existence with humans. Some species listed here may have been bred in captivity for a considerable length of time, but are still not recognized as [[domesticated]]. 

Generally, wild animals are recognized as not suitable to keep as pets, and this practice is completely banned in many places. In other areas, certain species are allowed to be kept, and it is usually required for the owner to obtain a permit. It is considered [[animal cruelty]] by some, as most often, wild animals require precise and constant care that is very difficult to meet in captive conditions. Many large and instinctively aggressive animals are extremely dangerous, and numerous times have they killed their handlers.

== History ==
{{expand section|date=March 2015}}
Archaeology suggests that dogs as pets may date back to at least 12,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Victorian era: the rise of modern pet keeping ===

Throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth-century pet keeping in the modern sense gradually became accepted throughout [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]]. Initially, aristocrats kept dogs for both companionship and hunting.  Thus, pet keeping was a sign of elitism within society. By the nineteenth century, the rise of the middle class stimulated the development of pet keeping and it became inscribed within the [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Beastly Possession: Animals in the Victorian Consumer Culture|last=Amato|first=Sarah|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=2015|isbn=|location=Toronto|page=25|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Economy ====
As the popularity of pet-keeping in the modern sense rose during the [[Victorian era]], animals became a fixture within urban culture as commodities and decorative objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Beastly Possessions: Animals in Victorian Consumer Culture|last=Amato|first=Sarah|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=2015|isbn=|location=|page=6|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pet keeping generated a commercial opportunity for entrepreneurs.  By the mid-nineteenth century, nearly twenty thousand street vendors in London dealt with live animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Animal Estate: The English and Other Creatures in the Victorian Age|last=Ritvo|first=Harriet|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1987|isbn=|location=Cambridge|page=86|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, the popularity of animals developed a demand for animal goods such as accessories and guides for pet keeping. Pet care developed into a big business by the end of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Beastly Possession: Animals in Victorian Consumer Culture|last=Amato|first=Sarah|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=2015|isbn=|location=Toronto|page=48|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Profiteers also sought out pet stealing as a means for economic gain. Utilizing the affection owner’s had for their pets, professional dog stealers would capture animals and hold them for ransom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Animal Space, Beastly Places: New Geographies of Human-Animal Relations|last=Philo|first=Chris|publisher=Routledge|year=1989|isbn=|location=|pages=38–389|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The development of dog stealing reflects the increased value of pets.  Pets gradually became defined as the property of their owners. Laws were created that punished offenders for their burglary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Animal Space, Beastly Places: New Geographies of Human-Animal Relations|last=Philo|first=Chris|publisher=Routledge|year=1989|isbn=|location=|page=41|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Social ====
Pets and animals also had social and cultural implications throughout the nineteenth century. The categorization of dogs by their breeds reflected the hierarchical, social order of the Victorian era. The [[pedigree (dog)|pedigree]] of a dog represented the high status and lineage of their owners and reinforced social stratification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Beastly Possession: Animals in Victorian Consumer Culture|last=Amato|first=Sarah|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=2015|isbn=|location=Toronto|page=55|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Middle-class owners, however, valued the ability to associate with the upper-class through ownership of their pets. The ability to care for a pet signified respectability and the capability to be self-sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Beastly Possession: Animals in Victorian Consumer Culture|last=Amato|first=Sarah|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=2015|isbn=|location=Toronto|page=10|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Harriet Ritvo, the identification of “elite animal and elite owner was not a confirmation of the owner’s status but a way of redefining it.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Animal Estate: The English and Other Creatures in the Victorian Era|last=Ritvo|first=Harriet|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1987|isbn=|location=Cambridge|page=104|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Entertainment ====
The popularity of dog and pet keeping generated [[animal fancy]].  Dog fanciers showed enthusiasm for owning pets, breeding dogs, and showing dogs in various shows.  The first [[Conformation show|dog show]] took place on 28 June 1859 in Newcastle and focused mostly on sporting and hunting dogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Animal Estate: The English and Other Creatures in Victorian Age|last=Ritvo|first=Harriet|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1987|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=7–8|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, pet owners produced an eagerness to demonstrate their pets as well as have an outlet to compete.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Animal Estate: The English and Other Creatures in the Victorian Age|last=Ritvo|first=Harriet|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1987|isbn=|location=Cambridge|page=98|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, pet animals gradually were included within dog shows.  The first large show, which would host one thousand entries, took place in Chelsea in 1863.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Animal Estate: The English and Other Creatures in the Victorian Age|last=Ritvo|first=Harriet|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1987|isbn=|location=Cambridge|page=66|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Kennel club|Kennel Club]] was created in 1873 to ensure fairness and organization within dog shows. The development of the ''[[Stud book|Stud Book]]'' by the Kennel Club defined policies, presented a national registry system of purebred dogs, and essentially institutionalized dog shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Animal Estate: The English and Other Creatures in the Victorian Age|last=Ritvo|first=Harriet|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1987|isbn=|location=Cambridge|page=104|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prostitutes are known locally as "motyo". [[UNAIDS]] estimate there to be 2,228 prostitutes in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sex workers: Population size estimate - Number, 2016 |url=http://www.aidsinfoonline.org/gam/stock/shared/dv/PivotData_2018_7_22_636678151733621264.htm |website=www.aidsinfoonline.org |publisher=UNAIDS |accessdate=21 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although prostitution is illegal, the country issues temporary [[work permit]]s to migrant prostitutes travelling through Suriname en-route to another country.&lt;ref name="pbs"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pbs.org/wnet/wideangle/uncategorized/human-trafficking-worldwide-suriname/1462/ |title= Human Trafficking Worldwide: Suriname |last= |first= |date= 25 September 2003 |website= Wideangle |publisher= |access-date= 2 December 2017 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prostitutes often rent rooms in hotels and attract clients in the hotel's bar or outside the hotel.&lt;ref name="kempadoo"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kempadoo|first1=Kamala|title=Sexing the Caribbean : gender, race, and sexual labor|date=2004|publisher=Routledge|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=978-0415935036}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law enforcement==
Prostitution is generally tolerated and the laws forbidding it are not enforced. Laws that tend to be enforced, at least to some degree, are those prohibiting human trafficking, child prostitution and soliciting outside unofficially tolerated areas.&lt;ref name="state"/&gt;

Brothels are usually tolerated unless there is trouble or if women are working there against their will. Police regularly visit the brothels and may act as intermediaries in disputes between the prostitutes and brothel owners. The police sometimes work as 'advisors' to the brothels and assist in getting work visas for the women.&lt;ref name="state"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pbs"/&gt;

==Red-light districts==
In the capital [[Paramaribo]], the [[red-light district]] is located in the area of Watermolenstraat, Timmermanstraat, Hoek Hogestraat, Zwartenhovenbrugstraat and Crommelinstraat. These streets are known for their [[street prostitution|street walkers]]. The sex workers, mainly from [[Guyana]]&lt;ref name="refworld"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.refworld.org/pdfid/55af8bd14.pdf |title= Suriname Mission Report |last= Hamcha |first= Bahia |date= 2012 |website= RefWorld |publisher= |access-date= 2 December 2017 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; are fully visible and practice their work relatively undisturbed.

==Gold Mining==
In the interior of Suriname there are a number of official and unofficial [[gold mines]]. A lot of men work at the mines, especially [[Brazilians]]. In the mining areas there are a large number of prostitutes to service the needs of the [[miners]].&lt;ref name="pellau"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Joseph|first1=Andrew|title=The Horniest Countries in the Caribbean|url=https://mypellau.com/2016/11/08/the-horniest-countries-in-the-caribbean/|website=Pellau Media|accessdate=22 December 2017|date=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many foreign women who come to work in the gold fields (Brazilians, Dominicans, Guyanese and French) and well as native Surinamese prostitutes.&lt;ref name="stab"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.stabroeknews.com/2012/news/stories/01/30/prostitution-big-business-in-suriname-gold-fields/ |title= Prostitution big business in Suriname gold fields |last= |first= |date= 30 January 2012 |website= Stabroek News |publisher= |access-date= 2 December 2017 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brazilian prostitutes can earn three times the amount in the mining area than they can at home.&lt;ref name="refworld" /&gt; Some women will take payment in gold nuggets.&lt;ref name="stab" /&gt; There is evidence of [[Child prostitution]] in the area.&lt;ref name="pbs"/&gt;

Prostitutes generally live in "women's camps", a series of huts, near the mining camps where the women live and receive their clients.&lt;ref name="kempadoo" /&gt; There are also some bars around the mining camps, the prostitutes in these bars are generally recruited and employed by the owner.&lt;ref name="kempadoo" /&gt; Some miners have a prostitute as a "temporary wives" for a period of 3 months. The women look after the miner's domestic needs as well as their sexual ones. This arrangement is usually made through a mining foreman who recruits and pays women from Brazil in return for 10% of the miner's wages.&lt;ref name="kempadoo" /&gt;

In 2011, the government introduced a scheme to register all workers in the mining areas, including sex workers. The object was to enable the government to collect taxes from the workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/Suriname-sex-workers-to-be-taxed |title= Suriname sex workers to be taxed |last= |first= |date= 17 September 2011 |website= Jamaica Observer |publisher= |access-date= 2 December 2017 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sex Trafficking==
{{see also|Human trafficking in Suriname}}
Suriname is principally a destination and transit country for men, women, and children trafficked transnationally for the purposes of commercial [[sexual slavery|sexual exploitation]] and [[forced labor]]. It is also a source country for underage Surinamese girls, and increasingly boys, trafficked internally for sexual exploitation. Some of these children are trafficked into the sex trade surrounding [[gold]] mining camps in the country’s interior. Foreign girls and women from [[Guyana]], [[Brazil]], the [[Dominican Republic]], and [[Colombia]] are trafficked into Suriname for commercial sexual exploitation; some transit Suriname en route to [[Europe]].&lt;ref name="state" /&gt;

The [[United States Department of State]] [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] ranks Suriname as a '[[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|Tier 2 Watch List]]' country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/2017/271117.htm|title=Trafficking in Persons Report 2017: Tier Placements|website=www.state.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==

===Setting===
In the 2040s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/5831527/read-the-first-two-chapters-of-ernest-clines-dystopian-gamer-novel-ready-player-one|title=Read the first two chapters of Ernest Cline's new novel, Ready Player One|first=Annalee|last=Newitz|date=|website=gizmodo.com|accessdate=April 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the world has been gripped by an [[energy crisis]] from the depletion of [[fossil fuels]] and the consequences of [[global warming]] and overpopulation, causing widespread social problems and economic stagnation. To escape the decline their world is facing, people turn to the OASIS,{{efn|OASIS is an acronym for Ontologically Anthropocentric Sensory Immersive Simulation{{Ref|Chapter|p. 48}}}} a virtual reality simulator accessible by players using [[Head-mounted display|visors]] and [[haptic technology]] such as gloves. It functions both as an [[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]] and as a [[virtual world]], with its currency being the most stable in the real world. It was created by James Halliday who, when he died, had announced in his will to the public that he had left an [[Easter egg (media)|Easter egg]] inside OASIS, and the first person to find it would inherit his entire fortune and the corporation. The story follows the adventures of Wade Watts, starting about five years after the announcement, when he discovers one of the three keys pointing to the treasure.&lt;!-- ch. 0, 1 --&gt;

===Plot===
Teenager Wade Watts lives with his aunt in [[Oklahoma City]]&lt;!--Do not change this to Columbus - that was from the movie, not the book--&gt;&lt;ref name="newsok"&gt;{{cite news |last=Poppe |first=Nathan |url=http://newsok.com/article/5581790 |title=Why isn't Steven Spielberg's 'Ready Player One' movie set in OKC? |publisher=NewsOK |date=February 1, 2018 |accessdate=April 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the "stacks", a poverty-stricken district constructed of [[trailer home]]s piled on top of each other. He spends his spare time as a "gunter" ("egg hunter"), logging on to the OASIS as an [[Avatar (computing)|avatar]] under the moniker    Parzival, reading Halliday's journal ''Anorak's Almanac'', and researching details of the 1980s pop culture, mainly [[classic video game]]s and movies, that Halliday loved. One day, he realizes that the first key is located on Ludus, the same virtual world as his own online high school, in a re-creation of the ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' module ''[[Tomb of Horrors]]''. He meets Art3mis, a famous female gunter and blogger who has been exploring the place, and advances further than she does when he defeats the [[AI]] [[Acererak]] at the video game ''[[Joust (video game)|Joust]]''. He is awarded the Copper Key, and Parzival appears on the "[[Score (game)|Scoreboard]]", attracting the world's attention.

Parzival completes the gate's puzzles by [[Teleportation|teleporting]] to planet [[Middletown, Ohio|Middletown]], playing through the ''[[Dungeons of Daggorath]]'' video game in a recreation of Halliday's parents's house and then role-playing [[Matthew Broderick]]'s character in the film ''[[WarGames]]''. Art3mis clears the gate shortly afterwards, as does Wade's friend Aech. Wade’s fame enables him to make a living by endorsing virtual products. It also brings him to the attention of Nolan Sorrento, head of operations at Innovative Online Industries (IOI), a multinational corporation bent on a well-funded effort to find the Easter egg in order to take control of the OASIS and [[Monetization|monetize]] it. When Wade refuses to join IOI, Sorrento attempts to kill him by blowing up the stacks where Wade lives, killing his aunt and disguising the explosion as a [[meth lab]] accident.

Wade escapes and moves to [[Columbus, Ohio]], where he lies low, assuming the [[pseudonym]] [[Max Headroom (TV series)#Bryce Lynch|Bryce Lynch]] and living in an anonymous apartment designed for hardcore OASIS users. He considers an alliance with Aech, Art3mis, and Daito and Shoto, two Japanese gunters who have also earned the Copper Key. Instead, he and Art3mis begin a wary friendship, but when he [[online relationship|asks her out]], Art3mis declines. IOI operatives, called Sixers, attempt to assassinate Wade and Art3mis at the birthday party of OASIS co-founder Ogden Morrow. They are stopped by Morrow, who has special privileges and powers within the OASIS. Art3mis abandons Wade due to the competition being more personal for her. Five months pass. Neither Wade nor anyone else has found the next token, the Jade Key.

When Art3mis finds the Jade Key, Parzival scrambles to planet Archaide, where he plays a [[Pac-Man#Perfect play|perfect game of ''Pac-Man'']], receiving only a [[quarter (United States coin)|quarter]] as a prize. Aech provides a hint leading him to the planet [[Frobozz]] where he solves the [[text adventure game]] ''[[Zork]]''. Sorrento, who had tracked Art3mis and Aech using a premium locator artifact, establishes a base there to [[Farming (video gaming)|farm]] their company's avatars with keys, and unlocks the second Gate and acquires the Jade Key. Shoto tells Parzival that the Sixers infiltrated Daito's [[real life|real-life]] apartment and threw him out of the building, killing him.

Parzival unlocks the Jade Gate, a [[Voight-Kampff machine]] by entering a privately-owned ''[[Blade Runner (franchise)|Blade Runner]]''-themed bulding, and completes the arcade game ''[[Black Tiger (arcade game)|Black Tiger]]'' as a character from the [[first-person shooter]] perspective, being given a virtual [[mecha]] as the prize and another clue: a red star in a circle. Using his knowledge of [[Rush (band)|Rush]], he acquires the Crystal Key on planet Syrinx (the red star being the symbol of the Solar Federation in the song ''[[2112 (song)|2112]]''), and after playing "Discovery", the third movement of the song, finds a clue regarding the conditions to unlock the final gate. As he messages Art3mis, Aech, and Shoto with his solution, Sorrento ends their covert attempts to clear the third gate, Castle Anorak on planet Chthonia, and places a force field around it.

Wade manipulates his assumed identity in order to be arrested and placed in [[indentured servitude]] in IOI's [[tech support]] department. While inside IOI, he uses [[Darknet market|black market passwords]] and [[Security hacker|security exploits to hack]] into IOI's [[intranet]]: he acquires a wealth of information, including footage of Daito's murder. The information also includes the attempt on his own life, as well as plans to force Shoto and Art3mis to work for IOI in real life, and kill them at the end of the contest (IOI doesn't know who Aech is due to him using a pseudonym). After escaping the corporation, he shares his information with his friends and publicizes a gathering of avatars to storm the castle. They are interrupted by Ogden Morrow, who offers them a safe haven at his home in [[Oregon]]. Wade meets the real-life Aech and Ogden, but not Art3mis and Shoto, who are already hooked into Ogden's immersion pods.

The day of the battle, Wade uses his planted hack to bring down the barricade, and a massive fight among avatars ensues. After Parzival uses the mecha [[Spider-Man (Toei TV series)#Leopardon|Leopardon]] (accompanied by Art3mis's [[Mazinger|Minerva X]] and Aech's [[Gundam (fictional robot)|Gundam]]) to fight against Sorrento's [[Mechagodzilla#Millennium (2002–2003)|''Mechagodzilla'' Kiryu]], Parzival and friends unlock the gate, at which point the Sixers use an artifact called the Cataclyst to destroy the castle and all avatars over a large area. Parzival survives because having the ''Pac-Man'' quarter granted him an [[extra life]]. As he enters the Crystal Gate, he announces that if he wins he will share his fortune with his three friends. With Sorrento and his Sixers on his heels, Parzival plays ''[[Tempest (video game)|Tempest]],'' role-plays King Arthur and various characters in ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'', and retrieves the Easter egg in ''[[Adventure (Atari 2600)|Adventure]]''. His victory grants him control of the OASIS, including wiping out his enemies' avatars, resurrecting his friends, and a [[Big Red Button]] that would wipe OASIS. Sorrento is arrested for the murder of Daito and for conspiring to kill Wade and the others. Back in Oregon, Wade and Art3mis, whose actual name is Samantha, meet in person and rekindle their relationship with a kiss.

==Characters==
* '''{{vanchor|Wade Owen Watts|Parzival|Wade3}}''' {{aka}} '''Parzival''': the [[viewpoint character]], an orphan from the "stacks" surrounding metropolitan [[Oklahoma City]]. Wade names his OASIS character Parzival after [[Parzival|the Arthurian knight involved in the quest for the holy grail]], and dedicates his life to finding James Halliday's Easter egg. He is 18 years old when he finds the Copper Key in the prologue of the book. His username at the virtual high school he attends is Wade3.{{efn|In OASIS, the students are required to use their real name when attending school, plus a number for name duplicates. For example, Wade Watts goes by Wade3, and there is another student named Todd13. {{Ref|Chapter|p. 29-30}}}} Wade's character was based on a mix of Cline as well as his geek friends.&lt;ref name="wired fanboys"/&gt; 
* '''{{vanchor|James Donovan Halliday|James Halliday|Anorak}}''' a.k.a. '''Anorak''': creator of OASIS. A big fan of 1980s culture, he announces in his will his plans to leave his entire fortune to whoever can find his Easter egg that he had hidden in OASIS. His character was initially inspired by [[Willy Wonka]] who Cline described as a "rich eccentric holding a fantastic contest". Cline used the personalities of [[Howard Hughes]] and [[Richard Garriott]], and placed Halliday's birth year around the same as his own so that his pop culture interests would coincide with Cline's "and the other middle-aged uber geeks I know".&lt;ref name="cline 20111019"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ernestcline.com/blog/2011/10/19/how-lord-british-inspired-anorak/ |title=How Lord British Inspired Anorak &amp;#124; Ernie's Blog |publisher=Ernestcline.com |date=October 19, 2011 |accessdate=July 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wired fanboys"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://archive.wired.com/geekdad/2011/06/a-few-minutes-with-fanboys-writer-ernest-cline-on-ready-player-one/ | work=Wired | first=Tony | last=Sims | title=A Few Minutes With Fanboys Writer Ernest Cline on Ready Player One | date=June 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''{{vanchor|Aech}}''' (pronounced like the [[H (letter)|letter H]]{{Ref|Chapter|Ch. 33}}): Wade's best friend, fellow gunter, and rival in the quest to find the egg. Aech's specialty is in [[PvP]] and [[first-person shooter]] games, and is one of the top combatants on OASIS. Although Aech's avatar is an athletic Caucasian heterosexual male,{{Ref|Chapter|p. 38-39}} Aech is played by an African-American [[lesbian]] named "'''Helen Harris'''", who grew up in [[Atlanta, Georgia]] and is about the same age as Wade.{{Ref|Chapter|Ch. 33}} Aech is based partly on Cline's friend [[Harry Knowles]] as well as himself and other geeks, both men and women.&lt;ref name="wired fanboys"/&gt;
* '''{{vanchor|Art3mis|Artemis}}''': a famous female gunter and blogger. Wade has a huge cyber-crush on her, which is complicated by their competition in search of the egg.{{Ref|Chapter|p. 35}} She chose her avatar's name from the [[Artemis|Greek goddess of the hunt]].{{efn|Art3mis chose the [[leet]] spelling as her username because the original spelling was already taken.{{Ref|Chapter|p. 93}}}}  Like other characters, Cline based Art3mis on himself and other geeks, both men and women.&lt;ref name="wired fanboys"/&gt; Her real name is "'''Samantha Evelyn Cook'''" from [[Vancouver, British Columbia]] and she has a [[port-wine stain]] on her face.{{Ref|Chapter|Ch. 30}}
* '''{{vanchor|Ogden "Og" Morrow}}''': Co-creator of the OASIS and best friend of James Halliday. They founded the video game company Gregarious Games, where he would handle the business operations, and which would later become Gregarious Simulation Systems (GSS), the company that launched OASIS.{{Ref|Chapter|p. 54-56}} His appearance and personality are described as being "a cross between Albert Einstein and Santa Claus." Concerned that people were using it to escape reality, he quits GSS and works on educational software with his wife Kira until her death. His relationship with Halliday deteriorated, and the two men remained estranged until before Halliday's death, when he is entrusted with ensuring that the hunt goes smoothly and without cheating.{{Ref|Chapter|Ch. 32-33}} Ogden lives in [[Oregon]] and owns a set of advanced OASIS consoles and immersion rigs, and is able to [[superuser|monitor everyone]] in the OASIS, even in private chat rooms.{{Ref|Chapter|Ch. 12, 32-33}} He rarely appears in public, and only shows up on the OASIS once a year on his birthday, where he assumes the avatar of the Great and Powerful Og. Ogden's character and relationship with Halliday was inspired by [[Jobs and Wozniak|Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak]], with Morrow being more like Jobs as a "charismatic tech leader".&lt;ref name="cline 20111019"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/22/one-on-one-ernest-cline-author-of-ready-player-one/?_r=0|title=One on One: Ernest Cline, Author of 'Ready Player One'|first=Nick|last=Bilton|date=|work=nytimes.com|accessdate=February 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''{{vanchor|Daito}}''': one of the two Japanese gunters who rise to the top of the scoreboard early on in the hunt, working in a team with "brother" Shoto. The pair have a generally tense, but not unfriendly relationship with Aech, and Art3mis, They are closer to Parzival, and work together on quests unrelated to the hunt. They are based on ''[[otaku]]'': Japanese geeks who enjoy movies and [[anime]], as well as ''[[hikikomori]]'': people who live as recluses inside their family's homes.&lt;ref name="wired fanboys"/&gt; Daito's real name is revealed to be "'''Toshiro Yoshiaki'''" after he is killed by the IOI.
* '''{{vanchor|Shoto}}''': the second and younger of the two Japanese gunters working as a team in their quest for the egg.{{Ref|Chapter|p. 129}} Shoto's real name is "'''Akihide Karatsu'''".{{Ref|Chapter|p. 292}} Following the death of his partner, Shoto collaborates with Art3mis, Aech and Wade to finish the hunt.
* '''{{vanchor|Nolan Sorrento|Sixers}}''': the head of operations at Innovative Online Industries (IOI), the multinational corporation that serves as an Internet service provider for most of the world, and that plans to take over and [[monetize]] the OASIS. Sorrento is head of IOI's Oology division, which is dedicated to searching for Halliday's Easter egg.{{Ref|Chapter|p. 33}} His avatar name is IOI-[[655321 (disambiguation)|655321]], after his employee number.{{Ref|Chapter|Ch. 14, 16}} IOI employees in the division are nicknamed Sixers, after their six-digit employee numbers that also begin with the number 6.{{Ref|Chapter|p. 33}} Cline said that he named Sorrento after [[Nolan Bushnell]], founder of the video game company [[Atari, Inc.|Atari]], and said, "Not that I think Nolan is a bad guy, or anything. It’s meant as a subtle tribute!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warpzoned.com/2011/09/the-geek-genius-behind-ready-player-one-an-interview-with-ernest-cline/|title=The Geek Genius Behind Ready Player One: An Interview With Ernest Cline|author=|date=September 23, 2011|work=warpzoned.com|accessdate=March 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spin-offs and sequels==
=== Short story ===
''Lacero'', a [[fan-fiction]] story by [[Andy Weir]], was published in the 2016 edition of ''Ready Player One''. It follows the story of Nolan Sorrento and functions as a precursor to the main novel, and is considered canonical to the ''Ready Player One'' fictional universe.&lt;ref name="lucero"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.galactanet.com/oneoff/lacero.html|title=Lacero|author=|date=|work=galactanet.com|accessdate=February 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=inVERSE-2016-03-28&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.inverse.com/article/13417-how-the-martian-impacted-the-ready-player-one-movie |title= How 'The Martian' Impacted the 'Ready Player One' Movie |author= Brock Wilbur |date= March 28, 2016 |publisher= INverse }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-author-of-the-martian-wrote-ready-player-one-fan-fi-1766228909|title=The Author of The Martian Wrote Ready Player One Fan Fiction, and Now It's Canon|first=Germain|last=Lussier|date=|website=gizmodo.com|accessdate=April 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Easter egg hunt promotion===
Ten months after the first edition release, Cline revealed on his blog that ''Ready Player One'' itself contained an elaborately hidden Easter egg.

[[Image:Stage managers panel.jpg|thumb|right|300px|the Part of a freak is stage manager's panel, or "[[Prompt corner]]."]]'''Stage management''' is a broad field that is generally defined as the practice of organization and coordination of an event or theatrical production. Stage management may encompass a variety of activities including the overseeing of the rehearsal process and &amp;nbsp;coordinating communications among various production teams and personnel. Stage management requires a general understanding of all aspects of production and offers organisational support to ensure the process runs smoothly and efficiently.

A '''Stage Manager''' is an individual who has overall responsibility for stage management and the smooth execution of a theatrical production. Stage management may be performed by an individual in small productions, while larger productions typically employ a stage management team consisting of a head stage manager, or "'''Production Stage Manager'''", and one or more '''Assistant Stage Managers'''.

==History==

The title of Stage Manager was not used until the 18th century. Though the concept and need for someone to fill the area of stage management can be seen with the Ancient Greeks. The playwrights were usually responsible for production elements. Sophocles is the first known stage technician, supported by his employment as a scenic artist, playwright, musician, and producer.

Moving into the Middle Ages there is evidence of a Conducteurs De Secrets, who oversaw collecting money at the door and serving as a prompter on stage. The prompter held the script and was prepared to feed performers their lines, this was a common practice of the time. 

Between the Renaissance and 17th century the actors and playwright handled stage management aspects and stage crew. During the Elizabethan and Jacobean Theatre there were two roles that covered the stage management: Stage Keeper and Book Keeper. The Stage Keeper was responsible for the maintenance of the theater, taking props on and off stage, and security of performance space. The Book Keeper was responsible for the stage script, obtaining necessary licenses, copying/providing lines for the performers, marking entrances and exits, tracking props, marking when sound effects come in, and cueing props and sound effects.  

Between the Renaissance and the 16th century, actors and playwrights took upon themselves the handling of finances, general directorial duties, and stage management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Stage management first emerged as a distinct role in the 17th century during Shakespeare's and Molière's time. During Shakespeare’s time the roles of stage management were left to apprentices, young boys learning the trade. There is still evidence of a prompter at this time.

Though it wasn't until the 18th century in England that the term Stage Manager was used. This was the first time a person other than actors and playwright was hired to direct or manage the stage. Over time, with the rise in complexity of theatre due to advances such as mechanized scenery, quick costume changes, and controlled lighting, the stage manager's job was split into two positions—''director'' and ''stage manager''.&lt;ref name="Fazio"&gt;{{cite book| last = Fazio| first = Larry| title = Stage Manager: The Professional Experience| isbn = 0-240-80410-4| publisher = [[Focal Press]]| pages = 367| date = 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many playwrights, directors, and actors have previously worked as an assistant stage manager. Writer and director [[Preston Sturges]], for example, was employed as an ASM on [[Isadora Duncan]]'s production of ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'' at the age of 16 and a half:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When one is responsible for giving an offstage cue, even the simplest ones, like the ring of a telephone or a birdcall, demand considerable sangfroid, and the job is nervewracking. One is very much aware that everything depends on the delivery of the cue at exactly the right microsecond. One stands there, knees slightly bent, breathing heavily...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite sturges}}, p. 123-24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sturges didn't last long in this job, due to his calling for thunder and then lightning instead of lightning and then thunder, but 16 years later [[Brock Pemberton]] hired him as an ASM on [[Antoinette Perry]]'s production of ''Goin' Home'', which led to the first mounting of one of Sturges' plays on Broadway, ''[[The Guinea Pig (play)|The Guinea Pig]]'', in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite sturges}} pp. 239-245&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regional differences ==

=== United States ===
In the United States, ''Stage Manager'' is a generic title that may be applied to anyone who performs stage management functions. On small shows, one person typically performs all the tasks of stage management, and is simply referred to as ''the stage manager''. Larger shows often need two or more stage managers. In such cases the head stage manager is titled Production Stage Manager (commonly abbreviated PSM), and working under the PSM is one or more Assistant Stage Managers (commonly abbreviated ASM). Shows that employ three stage managers have a PSM and two ASMs, though the program credits may list them as ''Production Stage Manager'' (first or head stage manager), ''Stage Manager'' (second stage manager), and ''Assistant Stage Manager'' (third stage manager).&lt;ref name=Fazio /&gt;

Some professional stage managers on plays and musicals may choose to be represented by a union known as the [[Actors' Equity Association]], which also represents performers. In addition to performing their typical stage management duties (e.g., maintaining the prompt book and calling performances), Equity stage managers are also required to uphold the union's rules and rights for Equity artists. Union stage managers for opera, ballet, and modern dance are represented by the American Guild of Musical Artists and perform most of the same duties as their counterparts in plays and musicals.

===United Kingdom===
In the UK, the structure of a stage management team depends on the type and size of the production. It can consist of stage manager (overseeing the running of the show), deputy stage manager (commonly called DSM), and assistant stage manager (commonly called ASM). A [[fringe theatre]] show may employ one stage manager to carry out the tasks of an entire team, whereas a [[West End theatre]] show in London might employ multiple ASMs. Professional stage managers are represented by the [[British Actors' Equity Association]], which also represents performers.

====Deputy stage manager====
The DSM prompts actors and will usually cue technical crew members and sometimes cast, while following the orders of the director and stage manager. The DSM calls actors to hold while technical problems are sorted out during rehearsal, and determines where in the script to restart halted scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Pallin, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; The deputy stage manager (DSM) is a separate position in some theatres, while in others the responsibilities of the DSM may be assumed by the stage manager or assistant stage manager.&lt;ref&gt;Bond, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

====Assistant stage manager====
The assistant stage manager (ASM) has varied responsibilities, which are assigned by the stage manager. The ASM assists in finding and maintaining props during rehearsals and the run of the show. The ASM may take attendance or estimate audience size, may manage the backstage technicians, may act as a liaison between crew, cast and management, and may call some cues. Mundane tasks such as mopping the stage and brewing coffee or tea may fall to the ASM. If the stage manager is unable to perform his or her duties, the ASM must be able to fill in.&lt;ref&gt;Bond, pp. 15–16&lt;/ref&gt; The assistant may also be in charge of one wing of the stage, while the stage manager is on the other wing.

==Show control based venues==
{{unreferenced|section|date=July 2018}}
Many live shows around the world are produced with the forehand knowledge that they will have a very long run, often measured in years. These are usually known quantities that are very expensive productions and have a guaranteed audience because of their location. Often, they are on cruise ships, in theme parks, Las Vegas or at destination resorts. These shows warrant very long-range development and planning and use stage managers to run almost all technical elements in the show, without many of the other traditional crew members, such as sound, lighting and rigging operators. In these cases, [[show control]] systems are installed and connected to all other technical systems in the theatre, which are specifically designed to be controlled by show control and to operate safely with minimal supervision. Stage managers working these shows usually have the additional responsibility for programming the show control system, and often the other control systems as well.

== Different Areas of Stage Management ==
{{unreferenced|section|date=July 2018}}
The role of stage manager evolved from an amalgamation of various positions in theater over several centuries and is still generally known for its integral relationship with theater. Many other types of productions and events have incorporated the position of stage management, however. Some of the most common are Opera, Music and Dance concerts and, Film and Television.

For music concerts, stage management includes a large variety of responsibilities depending on both the venue and the size and expertise of the musical group coming into the venue. Some of the responsibilities of a concert stage manager include overseeing the schedule for load in and out of equipment, seeing to the comfort of the group which can include arranging refreshments and or transportation, sometimes arranging how and where merchandise is to be sold at the venue, and above all, as with all areas of stage management, watching out for the safety of all participants in the experience including performers, audience, and any crews required.

== Stage Managers and Unions ==
{{unreferenced|section|date=July 2018}}
With being a Stage Manager you also need to know what unions you will be working with. Some of the things that a Stage Manager needs to know about working with a union is how often do they take breaks, and who is represented by which union. 
=== Actors Equity Association ===
Commonly referred to as [[Actors Equity]] (AEA). Actors Equity represents the stage actors and stage managers in the live theatre industry. The AEA works to negotiate and provide performers and stage managers quality living  conditions, livable wages, and benefits.
=== IATSE ===
[[International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees]] (IATSE) represents the stage hands in the theatre.
=== United Scenic Artists ===
[[United Scenic Artist]] also known as United Scenic Artists of America. It organizes designers, artists and craftspeople in the entertainment and decorative arts industries.&lt;ref&gt;United Scenic Artists is affiliated with International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees since 1999.

'''Tarot games''', occasionally called '''tarock games''', are [[card games]] played with [[tarot]] decks, also known as [[Tarock deck]]s. The basic rules first appeared in the manuscript of Martiano da Tortona, written before 1425.&lt;ref&gt;[http://trionfi.com/0/b/11/t1.php Description of the Michelino deck - Translated text] at Trionfi.com, by Martiano da Tortona, translated by Ross Caldwell&lt;/ref&gt; The games, known as "tarot", "tarock", "tarocco" and other spellings, are  known in many variations, mostly cultural and regional.

The deck which English-speakers call by the French name ''Tarot'' is called ''Tarocco'' in Italian, ''Tarock'' in German and various similar words in other languages. Tarot games originated in Italy, and spread to most parts of Europe, notable exceptions being the British Isles, the Iberian peninsula, and the Balkans.&lt;ref name="Parlett"&gt;David Parlett, ''Oxford Dictionary of Card Games'', pg. 300 Oxford University Press (1996) {{ISBN|0-19-869173-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are played with decks having four ordinary suits, and one additional, longer suit of tarots, which are always [[trump (card games)|trump]]s. They are characterised by the rule that a player who cannot follow to a trick with a card of the suit led ''must'' play a trump to the trick if possible.&lt;ref&gt;One tarot game, Bavarian Tarock, is in fact played with a deck of four ordinary suits each of nine cards, but has the rule that a player who cannot follow suit must play a trump. {{cite book|last1=Dummett|first1=Michael|title=The Game of Tarot|date=1980|publisher=Duckworths|isbn=0 7156 1014 7|page=563r}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tarot games may have introduced the concept of trumps to card games. More recent tarot games borrowed features from other games like bidding from [[Ombre]] and winning the last trick with the lowest trump from [[Trappola]].

Tarot decks did not precede decks having four suits of the same length,&lt;ref&gt;"The Tarot pack was invented in northern Italy in about 1425 [...]. A plethora of references to the cards, from Italy in the XV century [...] testify to their use as instruments in a special kind of card game. None associates them with the occult, and only one very dubious one hints at a use of them to read individual characters. It was not until the XVIII century that the use of them for divination became widespread in Bologna and France. Their association with the occult originated exclusively in France; neither it nor their use in fortune-telling was propagated in print until 1781." {{harvnb|Dummett|McLeod|2004a|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;1f}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they were invented not for occult purposes but purely for gaming.&lt;ref&gt;"A third particularity [...] is how widespread is the blanket of darkness enveloping everything to do with Tarots in particular. [...] The ignorance is largely fostered and reinforced by writers of books on the mystic side of tarot who assert without evidence that tarot-cards were originally invented for fortune telling and only subsequently adapted to the 'less serious' business of gaming — whereas, as our authors patiently explain, the fact of the matter is precisely the reverse". [[David Parlett]] in the preface to {{harvnb|Dummett|McLeod|2004a}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1781, [[Antoine Court de Gébelin|Court de Gébelin]] published an essay associating the cards with ancient wisdom, the earliest record of this idea, subsequently debunked by [[Michael Dummett|Dummett]].&lt;ref name=Dummett&gt;Dummett, Michael. ''Twelve Tarot Games''. London: Duckworth (1980), p. 2. {{ISBN|0 7156 1488 6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The cards have since been used for [[cartomancy]] and [[divination]].

== Classification ==
Dummett classified Tarot games into three distinct types:{{sfn|Dummett|1993|loc=Ch. 7}}

* Type I - in which there are other trumps with a value higher than one in addition to the Fool, the XXI and the I. These are only found in Italy.
* Type II - in which there are 3 high-value trumps, but the Fool is used as an 'excuse'.
* Type III - in which there are also 3 high-value trumps, but the Fool is the top trump.

=== Type I - the Tarocchi group ===
[[File:Tarocco Bolognese.png|thumb|The [[Tarocco Bolognese]] is used for [[Tarocchini]].]]
'''Tarocchi''' (Italian, singular ''Tarocco''), and similar names in other languages, is a specific form of [[playing card]] deck used for different [[trick-taking game]]s. An earlier name of the game ''[[Trionfi (cards)|Trionfi]]'' is first recorded in the diary of Giusto Giusti in September 1440&lt;ref&gt;[http://trionfi.com/giusto-giusti Franco Pratesi: Studies about Giusto Giusti] at Trionfi.com&lt;/ref&gt; (in other early documents also ludus triumphorum or similar&lt;ref&gt;[http://trionfi.com/early-trionfi-cards-notes Dates of Early Trionfi notes (- 1465)] at Trionfi.com, composed by Lothar Teikemeier&lt;/ref&gt;). The name ''Tarochi'' was first used in Ferrara June 1505, the name ''Taraux'' appeared in Avignon in  December of the same year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://trionfi.com/0/p/23/ First Notes about Tarot in 1505 and later in 1515/16] at Trionfi.com&lt;/ref&gt; The names Tarocco, Tarocchi and Tarot developed in later times beside different writing forms. The poet [[Francesco Berni]] still mocked on this word in his ''Capitolo del Gioco della Primiera'' written in 1526.&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel Weller Singer]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=_WAOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA28&amp;dq=Let+him+look+to+it,+who+is+pleased+with+the+game+of+Tarocco&amp;lr=&amp;hl=cs#v=onepage&amp;q=Let%20him%20look%20to%20it%2C%20who%20is%20pleased%20with%20the%20game%20of%20Tarocco&amp;f=false ''Researches into the history of playing cards''] pg. 28 London 1816&lt;br /&gt; "Let him look to it, who is pleased with the game of Tarocco, that the only signification of this word Tarocco, is stupid, foolish, simple, fit only to be used by bakers, cobblers, and the vulgar."&lt;/ref&gt; The name Trionfi developed later as a general term for trick-taking games ([[Triomphe]] in French, Trumpfen in German and Trump in English), although it has almost completely disappeared in its original function as deck name.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} Other different games claimed the name without any use of Tarocchi cards. The first basic rules for the game of ''Tarocco'' appear in the manuscript of Martiano da Tortona, the next are known from the year 1637.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tarock.info/depaulis.htm REGLES DV IEV DES TAROTS] at tarock.info, ; assigned to Abbé Michel de Marolles, printed at Nevers in 1637, transcribed by Thierry Depaulis from the original printed text housed in the Bibliothèque nationale de France&lt;/ref&gt;

Excluding Piedmontese tarocchi, which is more closely related to [[French tarot]], Italian tarocchi are all of Type I, i.e. they have trumps other than the I and XXI that are worth more than one card point. Winning the final trick (''ultimo'') awards a set number of points. Sicilian tarocchi is played in only four towns with 63 cards from the [[Tarocco Siciliano]] deck. [[Tarocchini]] is confined to [[Bologna]] and uses the 62 card [[Tarocco Bolognese]] deck. These games have four [[face cards]] in each suit but dropped some of their [[pip cards]] early in their history. Both decks include 21 trumps and [[The Fool (Tarot card)|The Fool]], a suitless card that excuses the player from following suit.

=== Type II - the Tarot group ===
[[File:Joueurs de tarot.JPG|thumb|220px|French tarot being played.]]
The French adopted tarot games after their occupation of [[Milan]] in the late 15th century. [[French tarot]], known locally as ''Jeu de Tarot'', is one which uses the full 78-card Tarot deck. Originally played with the [[Italian playing cards|Italian-suited]] [[Tarot de Marseille]], the game is now played with the [[French playing cards|French-suited]] [[Tarot Nouveau]]. The Tarot Nouveau, of [[Frankfurt]] origin, has trumps which depict scenes of traditional social activities; this differs from the [[Renaissance]] allegorical motifs found in Italian-suited Tarot decks such as the Tarot de Marseille, [[Tarocco Piemontese]], the Tarocco Bolognese, or even the [[Rider-Waite]] well known in [[cartomancy]]. ''Jeu de Tarot'' is now the most popular card game in France after [[Belote]] and many tournaments are held by the [[Fédération Française de Tarot]].

A Tarot Nouveau deck consists of 56 cards of four suits and 22 emblematic cards called ''atouts'' (trumps). Each suit consists of fourteen cards: ten [[pip cards]], and four [[face cards]]: the ''Roi'' (King), ''Dame'' (Queen), ''Cavalier'' (Knight), and ''Valet'' (Jack). Of the ''atouts'', 21 are numbered from 1 to 21, and a non-numbered card called "''Fou''" ("Fool", also called "''Mat''" or "''L'Excuse''" in play) which "excuses" the player from following suit. Of the ''atouts'', only the Fool and trumps 1 and 21 are considered to be "counting" cards because they are worth more than 1 point. Winning the last trick awards bonuses only if it is won with the lowest trump.

Tarot games from [[Piedmont]], the Italian region bordering France, are more similar to French tarot than other Italian games as it was the French that (re-)introduced tarot to that region. These games use the 78-card [[Tarocco Piemontese]] deck which was derived from the Tarot de Marseille. The most common Piedmontese tarot games are [[Scarto]], Mitigati, Chiamare il Re, and Partita which can be found in Pinerolo and Turin.&lt;ref name="Parlett"/&gt; Piedmontese games are also the simplest tarot games and can be used to introduce new players on basic rules and features. [[Troccas]], a Swiss tarot game, is also related and is played with the 78-card [[Swiss 1JJ Tarot]], another derivative of the Tarot de Marseille. Danish [[Grosstarok]], which focuses on winning the final trick, also uses the Tarot Nouveau.

=== Type III - the Tarock group ===
[[File:Vitoria - Bibat 040a.jpg|thumb|''[[Industrie und Glück]]'' trumps]]
Tarock games, Dummett's Type III, differ from other forms in the function of the Fool which is now simply the highest trump.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pagat.com/tarot/ Tarot Games]&lt;/ref&gt; Games of this category include [[Cego]], [[Zwanzigerrufen]] and [[Königrufen]].&lt;ref name="Parlett"/&gt; These games use the 54 card [[French playing cards|French suited]] [[Cego]] or ''[[Industrie und Glück]]'' decks that strip certain pip cards.  The games are widely played in the [[Germany|German]] region of [[Baden]] and the countries within the boundaries of the former [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Monarchy]], for which even the name ''Tarockanien'' has been coined: the [[Austria]]n variation of the game (and the variations thereof) is thus still widely popular among all classes and generations in [[Slovenia]] and [[Croatia]], while in [[Hungary]] different rules are applied. The Swiss game of [[Troggu]] is believed to be an intermediary form linking the older tarot games to the Central European ones.

==== Sub-types ====
The individual tarock game variants differ too widely from one another to give a general description of play. However they can be grouped by sub-type:

* [[Tapp Tarock]]: a basic 3-player game
* [[Cego]]: A game with a large ''talon'' that can be used as a replacement hand
* Partner calling games:
** Calling a king: [[Königrufen]] and Slovenian tarok
** Calling trump 19: [[Neunzehnerrufen]] and Czech taroky
** Calling trump 20: [[Zwanzigerrufen]] and Hungarian tarokk
* Royal tarokk: The ''talon'', card points, and partner calling are abandoned in favour of bonuses

A few games use the [[German playing cards|German suited]] 36 card deck that lacks any dedicated trump suit. Instead, one of the existing suits, customarily the heart suit, is chosen as the trump suit. These include [[Württemberg Tarock]], [[Bavarian Tarock]], [[Bauerntarock]], and [[Dobbm]]. They are [[Ace-Ten games]] that incorporate rules from Tapp Tarock, but are not true tarock games.

==== List ====
The following true tarock variants are known:
* [[Königrufen]]: 54 cards, 4 players, [[Austria]], [[Slovenia]], [[Rumania]], [[Ukraine]], [[Poland]]
* [[Neunzehnerrufen]]: 54 cards, 4 players, Austria, Czechia, Slovakia, Poland
* [[Cego]]: 54 cards, 3 or 4 Spieler, Germany (only Baden)
* [[Hungarian Tarock]]: 40, 42 (mostly), 46 or (rarely) 54 cards, 4 players, Hungary, Transylvania (growing community in Austria)
* [[Zwanzigerrufen]]: 40 cards, 4 players, Austria
* [[Tapp-Tarock]]/[[Dreiertarock]]: 40, 42 or 54 cards, 3 players, Austria
* [[Illustrated Tarock]]: 54 cards, 3 players, Austria
* [[Point Tarock]]: 54 cards, 3 players, Austria
* [[Troggu]]: 62 cards, 3 to 8 players, Switzerland, [[Canton of Wallis]] (Type II/III)
* [[Strohmandeln]]: 54 cards, 2 players, Austria
* Großtarock, Viennese style (modern): 54 cards, 3 players, Austria/[[Vienna]]

== Common features ==
=== Deck of cards ===
A complete Tarot deck such as one for [[French tarot|French Tarot]] contains the full 78-card complement and can be used to play any game in the family with the exception of [[Minchiate]], an extinct game that used 97 cards. Austrian-Hungarian Tarock and Italian Tarocco decks, however, are a smaller subset (of 63, 54, 40, or even 36 cards) suitable only for games of a particular region. Regional tarot decks commonly feature culture-specific [[suit (cards)|suits]]; the German suits of Hearts, Bells, Acorns and Leaves are used through most of Germanic Europe, the Latin suits of Cups, Coins, Clubs, and Swords are common in Italy and Spain, and the French suits familiar to most English speakers are seen in France, Quebec, West Germany and most of the English-speaking world. This trend continues even to non-Tarot decks such as for the German game of Skat (played with a deck of similar-value cards as in the French [[piquet]] deck used for [[Belote]]; players in most of western Germany use French suits while players in Bavaria and eastern Germany use German suits).

[[Image:Tarockkarten in der Hand eines Spielers.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Austrian-style 40-card Tarock hand: the Skys (Fool) as highest trump, trump 21 (the second highest), five other trumps, King, Queen, 1 {{Hearts}}.]]

The 78-card tarot deck contains:
*14 cards each in four [[suit (cards)|suit]]s (French or Latin depending on the region): "pip" cards numbered one (but called [[Ace]]) through ten; plus four court cards, a Jack (or Knave or Valet), a Knight (or Cavalier), a Queen, and a King.
*The 21 tarots function in the game as a permanent suit of [[Trump (cards)|trump]]s.
*The Fool, also known as the Excuse, is an unnumbered card that excuses the player from following suit or playing a trump in some variations, and that acts as the strongest trump in others.

The 54-card 'tarock' deck contains:
*8 cards each in four [[suit (cards)|suit]]s (usually French), the "pip" cards being stripped out leaving 1 to 4 in the red suits (Ace highest) and 10 to 7 in the black suits (Ten highest). The court cards remain the same.
*22 tarocks as permanent [[Trump (cards)|trump]]s, including the [[Sküs]] (the Fool) as an unnumbered Tarock XXII, the [[Mond (playing card)|Mond]] as Tarock XXI and the [[Pagat]] as Tarock I, which are collectively known as the [[Trull (cards)|Trull]] or "Honours" and have a special role.

Due to the antiquity of tarot games, the cards are ordered in an archaic ranking. In the plain suits, Kings are always high. With the exception of modern French tarot and Sicilian tarocchi, the ranking in the Latin round suits (cups and coins) or the French red suits (diamonds and hearts) goes from King (high), Queen, Cavalier, Jack, 1, 2, 3 ... 10 (low).

===Basic rules of play===
*Play is typically counter-clockwise; the player to the right of the dealer plays to the first trick. Players must follow suit if they have a card of the suit led, otherwise they must play a trump if possible. The winner of each trick leads to the next.
*After the hand has been played, a score is taken based on the point values of the cards in the tricks each player has managed to capture.

===Common value of cards===
* Oudlers ([[Trull (cards)|Trull]]) - Trumps 1, 21 and the Fool: 5 points
* Kings: 5 points
* Queens: 4 points
* Cavaliers (Knights): 3 points
* Knaves (Jacks): 2 points
* All others: 1 point

The cards are usually counted in groups of two or three depending on the game. After the hand has been played, a score is taken based on the point values of the cards in the tricks each player has managed to capture.

For the purpose of the rules, the numbering of the trumps are the only thing that matters. The symbolic tarot images customary in non-gaming divinatory tarots have no effect in the game itself. The design traditions of these decks subsequently evolved independently and they often bear only numbers and whimsical scenes arbitrarily chosen by the engraver.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} However, there are still traditional sequences of images in which the common lineage is visible; e.g. the moon that is commonly visible at the bottom left corner of the trump card 21 stems from confusion of the German word ''Mond'', meaning Moon, with Italian ''mondo'' and French ''monde'', meaning "world", the usual symbol associated with the trump card 21 on Italian suited tarots and in non-gaming divinatory tarot.

'''''The Movie Masters''''' is an [[United States|American]] [[television]] [[game show]] that ran from August 2, 1989, to January 19, 1990. It was the last game show hosted by [[Gene Rayburn]] and aired as filler programming on the [[AMC (TV channel)|American Movie Classics]] (AMC) [[Cable television|cable]] network.

The concept of the game was for famous celebrities of the past to correctly answer questions that pertained to a scene of a movie. Correctly answering a question allowed the panelist to see a part of the scene and a chance to identify the title of the movie. Panelists played for home viewers with the viewer whose panelist guessed correctly winning a grand prize.

The regular panel of the show consisted of veteran ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' movie and theatre critic [[Clive Barnes]] and longtime ''[[To Tell the Truth]]'' panelists [[Kitty Carlisle]] and [[Peggy Cass]].

'''Thomas Frost''' (16 December 1821 – 16 July 1908) was an English radical writer, journalist,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=FROST, Thomas|magazine=Who's Who|year=1907|volume= 59|page=643|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yEcuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA643}}&lt;/ref&gt; printer and [[Chartism|Chartist]].&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;Peter Gurney, '[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/90087  Frost, Thomas (1821–1908)]', ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', online edn, Oxford University Press, Oct 2007. Retrieved 18 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Early years===

Thomas Frost was born in [[Croydon]] in Surrey (now part of [[Greater London]]) on 16 December 1821, the son of a tailor who had read [[William Cobbett]]'s ''[[Political Register]]'' and took part in the agitation to secure the [[Reform Act 1832]].&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt; Apprenticed to a printer (his cousin Cornelius Chapman) in [[South Norwood|Norwood]], London, Thomas started his own printing firm in the same town after Chapman's business became bankrupt.&lt;ref name="reminiscences"&gt;Frost, Thomas. ''Reminiscences of a Country Journalist''. Covent Garden: Ward and Downey, 1888&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career===

In 1846 he took over the publication of [[John Goodwyn Barmby]]'s ''Communist Chronicle,'' a monthly paper which had been discontinued for financial reasons. Frost revived the Chronicle as a weekly publication and reduced the price from 3d. to 1d. with Barmby retaining editorial control. Differences between Barmby and Frost on their aims caused publication to cease. Frost then started a short-lived ''Communist Journal.'' From 1847 to 1848 he was associated with the Fraternal Democrats.&lt;ref name="reminiscences" /&gt;

From 1859 Frost was a leader writer for the [[Liverpool]] ''Albion'' weekly newspaper, on foreign politics and social questions.  The newspaper maintained a political viewpoint independent of the main political parties until 1872, when a new proprietor, a member of the Conservative Party, recast the paper as a morning daily. Frost's terms of employment were now changed so that he was only paid for articles that were published; he was contracted to provide two articles per week, but many were not published, being politically incompatible. His income falling by one-third he left the ''Albion.''

Frost subsequently settled in [[Barnsley]], [[South Yorkshire]], and worked as a reporter for the ''Barnsley Times'' and the ''Barnsley Chronicle.'' He wrote a number of books, mostly by his own admission "potboilers". He estimated his annual income from journalism and other literary undertakings to have been less than £200 per year. He died in 1908.&lt;ref name="reminiscences" /&gt;

Frost claimed it was not until he read the poetry of [[Mary Shelley]] that he learned of "the connexion between the influence of circumstances in the formation of character and the new organization which [[Robert Owen|Owen]] desired to give society". Frost became an active [[Chartism|Chartist]] and [[Owenite]] and although he believed in revolution he stopped short of taking part in a revolutionary conspiracy to avoid arrest.&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt; He above all desired independence and wrote that "the assumption by [[William Ewart Gladstone|Mr. Gladstone]] of the leadership of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal party]] in the House of Commons seemed to promise the inauguration of a new era".&lt;ref&gt;E. F. Biagini, ''Liberty, Retrenchment and Reform. Popular Liberalism in the Age of Gladstone, 1860–1880'' (Cambridge University Press, 1992), p. 385.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magic history===

Frost wrote three books on the history of [[Magic (illusion)|magic]]. His ''Lives of the Conjurers'' (1876) is considered to be the first significant history of magic.&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, Earle Jerome. (1987). ''Magic: A Reference Guide''. Greenwood Press. p. 6. {{ISBN|978-0313233975}} "Thomas Frost' s ''The Lives of the Conjurors'' was the first book-length history of magic and is understandably required reading for the would-be historian of magic."&lt;/ref&gt; [[M. Thomas Inge]] described the book as "a full-fledged chronicle of magic and an invaluable reference work".&lt;ref&gt;Inge, Thomas M. (1978). ''Handbook of American Popular Culture, Volume 3''. Greenwood Press. p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; 

The magician [[Harry Houdini]] wrote that they were the "best books of their kind up to the time of their publication, but they are marked by glaring errors, showing that Frost compiled rather than investigated."&lt;ref&gt;Houdini, Harry. (1908). [https://archive.org/stream/unmaskingrobert00houdgoog#page/n22/mode/2up ''The Unmasking of Robert-Houdin'']. New York: Publishers Printing Co. p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

Frost's book ''Lives of the Conjurers'' is said to contain errors in relation to the magician [[Wiljalba Frikell]]. Magic historian [[Walter B. Gibson]] noted that "the information offered by Mr. Thomas Frost and his successors, concerning Frikell, is in the main incorrect and unreliable."&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, Walter B; Young, Morris N. (1953). ''Houdini on Magic''. Dover Publications. p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas Frost died 16 July 1908.

[[File:Mike Massey setting up a trick shot.jpg|thumb|right| World Champion professional trick shot artist [[Mike Massey]] setting up a trick shot.]]
A '''trick shot''' (also '''trickshot''' or '''trick-shot''') is a shot played on a [[billiards table]] (most often a [[pocket billiards|pool]] table, though [[snooker]] tables are also used), which seems unlikely or impossible or requires significant skill. Trick shots frequently involve the [[Billiard ball|balls]] organized in ways that are unlikely or impossible to appear in normal play, such as balls being in a straight line, or use [[Theatrical property|props]] such as extra cues or a [[Rack (billiards)|triangle]] that would not be allowed on the table during a game. As an organized [[cue sports]] discipline, trick shot competition is known as '''artistic pool'''.

==Competition formats==
Billiards trick shots are the subject of increasing international competition, both [[amateur]] and [[professional]].  There are world championships, such as the [[WPA Artistic Pool World Championships]] and the [[World Snooker Trickshot Championship]] (which has not been held since 2006), and made-for-TV events, such as ''[[Trick Shot Magic]]'' and the ''[[World Cup of Trick Shots]]'', often televised in both the [[United States|US]] and the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and providing enough prize money that some professional players specialize in the discipline.

The formats vary depending on the competition. Some, such as the [[World Snooker Trickshot Championship]] are purely [[Exhibition game|exhibitions]], with a panel of judges scoring subjectively to determine the winner.

Events such as Trick Shot Magic and the World Cup feature head-to-head competition where the players select shots that have strictly outlined requirements specified in a [[Playbook (sports)|playbook]]. Each year, players are allowed to submit their own shot inventions, however, they are disclosed prior to the event to give all players an equal chance to practice them. Players or teams are given two attempts to complete a selected shot within the given parameters, and earn one point for each successful shot, either a first shot or follow-up shot. Each player or team gets to select a given number of shots, generally eight or ten, and a winner is declared when one side is mathematically eliminated. Trick Shot Magic, [[ESPN]]'s annual artistic pool pro tournament, has been widely considered the televised version of the World Artistic Pool Championship, and it has held the highest ratings in televised cue sports competitions in the United States between 2000 and 2009.

Artistic pool similarly ''(see [[#Artistic pool|below]])'' has a {{Cuegloss|Shot program|program of shots}} (three attempts each, in a sliding-scale point system), with precisely outlined parameters requirements.

The Ultimate Trick Shot Tour &lt;ref name="Ultimate Trick Shot Tour"&gt;{{Cite web | title=Ultimate Trick Shot Tour | url=http://www.ultimatetrickshottour.com/index.php | accessdate=November 5, 2010 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100516091743/http://www.ultimatetrickshottour.com/index.php | archivedate=May 16, 2010 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; features head-to-head competition between two players with no pre-defined shots. Players challenge each other with shots outlining the parameters of the shots just before shooting. Each player gets three attempts per shot, scoring one point per shot made. Each player gets to select a given number of shots, generally six to ten, and the winner is declared when one player is mathematically eliminated.

==Artistic pool==
'''Artistic pool''' trick shot competitions, inspired by the related discipline of [[artistic billiards]], began in the 1970s with international pros and coordinated by world champion Paul Gerni, with the World Trick Shot Artists Association, and in 2000, in Las Vegas, formed a new group, again with an international cast.&lt;ref name="ArtisticPool.org1"&gt;{{Cite web|title='Artistic Pool' History|url=http://www.artisticpool.org/about/|work=ArtisticPool.org|last=Rossman|first=Tom|publisher=Artistic Pool and Trick Shot Association|year=2003|accessdate=2007-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They feature a program of 160 tricks to attempt, many of which were used in the previous formats by the WTSAA,&lt;ref name="ArtisticPoolPlayers1"&gt;{{Cite web|title=2005 / 2006 Shot Program |url=http://www.artisticpoolplayers.com/shot_program/shot_program_current.php |work=ArtisticPoolPlayers.com |publisher=Artistic Pool and Trick Shot Association |year=2005 |accessdate=2007-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630093356/http://www.artisticpoolplayers.com/shot_program/shot_program_current.php |archivedate=2007-06-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and include the [[Billiard Congress of America|BCA]] North American Championship, [[European Pocket Billiard Federation|EPBF]] European Championship, and [[World Pool-Billiard Association|WPA]] World Championship, among others.&lt;ref name="ArtisticPool.org1" /&gt;  The tricks are now divided into eight "disciplines", including trick/fancy, prop/novelty/special arts, and disciplines for extremes in each of the core [[Cue sports techniques|cueing techniques]].&lt;ref name="ArtisticPoolPlayers1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ArtisticPool.org3"&gt;{{Cite web |title=8 Disciplines of Artistic Pool |url=http://artisticpool.org/game/disciplines.html |work=ArtisticPool.org |last=Rossman |first=Tom |publisher=Artistic Pool and Trick Shot Association |year=2003 |accessdate=2007-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070905132100/http://artisticpool.org/game/disciplines.html |archivedate=2007-09-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The current world [[Sports governing body|governing body]] for this sport is the WPA Artistic Pool Division, while the current largest league and player organization is the US-based [[Artistic Pool &amp; Trick Shot Association]]&lt;!--Yes, it is consistently spelled with "&amp;" not "and".--&gt; (APTSA), which organizes the World Artistic Pool Championship (WAPC) annually, held concurrently with the more general [[VNEA International Pool Championship]].&lt;ref name="ArtisticPool.org1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ArtisticPool.org2"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Artistic Pool: Your Passport to Sport &amp;amp; Show|url=http://www.artisticpool.org/|work=ArtisticPool.org|last=Rossman|first=Tom|publisher=Artistic Pool &amp; Trick Shot Association|year=2003|accessdate=2007-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The greatest contemporary champions of artistic pool include 22-time World Champion [[Paul Gerni]], and more recently, [[Mike Massey]], [[Andy Segal]], and [[Tom Rossman]].

In WTSAA and APTSA competitions, competitors would have three chances to successfully perform each trick, earning full points if they are successful on their first attempts and incrementally reduced points for subsequent attempts. Each shot has an associated difficulty rating (also the point value) with a higher rating being more difficult. A preliminary round of 40 shots is performed, and the top players (the number varies depending on the number of competitors, but usually the top 12) proceed into a head-to-head playoff format to determine the winner. Proper and official artistic pool competitions feature equipment limitations, (one cue, one stroke per trick shot, one approved universal prop per shot per diagram if necessary, all shots on the bed of the table, etc.), and shot requirements (e.g., preclusion of any off-the-table tricks, such as are popular in events like Trick Shot Magic and World Cup of Trick Shots).&lt;ref name="APTSA Rules"&gt;{{Cite web

== Objects used ==
As with other pool and billiards games, trick shots usually utilize a {{Cuegloss|Cue ball|cue ball}}, one or more {{Cuegloss|Object ball|object balls}}, and a [[cue stick]]. However, many props can be used in trick shots including [[bottle]]s, [[drinking glass]]es, [[basket]]s, [[coin]]s, [[Rack (billiards)|ball racks]], [[Cue sports#Chalk|cue tip chalk]], and other billiards- and non-billiards-related equipment. Props are used to change the difficulty of the shot or add aesthetic value. As with artistic billiards pros, trick shot artists often have specialized cue sticks for performing particular types of shots, particularly {{Cuegloss|Jump shot|jump shots}} and [[Cue sports techniques#Massé shot|massés]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trickshottim.com/learn/pool-cues.html |title=Pool Cues |accessdate=2008-11-25 |work=trickshottim.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disciplines of trick shots==
[[File:Steve Davis at German Masters Snooker Final (DerHexer) 2012-02-05 4.ogv|thumb|Potting three balls at once.]]
The APTSA trick shot disciplines are:
#'''Trick and/or fancy''': Primarily deals with setup shots, multiple ball configurations, and/or a shot where cue ball travels in a "kick" pattern to make final ball(s). May also include "extreme" cut shots and special skill shots not in other disciplines.
#'''Prop/novelty and special arts''': Unusual or new shots of any nature, shots with "props", such as cues, bridge(s), rack(s), coin(s), chalk, etc., and shots of a unique or "special" art form, such as wing shots, time shots, "legal" or "illegal" follow-thru shots, push shots, roller coaster technique/waterfall specialties, plus demonstrations of one-handed jack up, behind back, under leg, and more. Referred to as general amusement category.
#'''Draw''': Basic to advanced with cue ball greater than 1/2" from first object ball. The cue ball contacts an object ball with draw (backspin) and pockets another.
#'''Follow''': A cue ball is hit with follow (topspin) and goes forth and hits in an object ball.
#'''Bank/Kick''': Bank, meaning to hit object ball(s) into cushion(s), and kicks meaning to hit cue ball into "x" number of cushions first and then to object ball(s).
#'''Stroke''': Cue ball less than 1/2" from first object ball(s), for draw or follow, plus accuracy position shots, speed control shots, or unique "stroke" shots.
#'''Jump''': Any shot utilizing jump shot technique, other than "prop" shots with bridge(s), and some special "stroke" shots.
#'''Massé''': Half and full massé &amp;ndash; cue elevations over 10 degrees.

== Notable trick shots ==
{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}
*"Machine gun" (1): A number of object balls are placed in a row to form a line, about a ball's width away from a {{Cuegloss|Cushion|cushion}}, and the cue ball is shot into the space between the balls and the cushion so as to reverberate between them while traveling and hit each one of the object balls in series, issuing a [[machine gun]]-like sound.
*"Machine gun" (2): A number of object balls are placed in a row to form a line along, but not against, a cushion, and are then shot directly with the cue, one after another, around the table, each contacting three cushions, and into the same pocket. The trick requires carefully timing the shots, so that newly-shot balls travel between balls already in motion.&lt;ref name="YouTube-MG"&gt;{{Cite web|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hjq6Fzjq8E |title=Play89 Machine Gun Billiard Trick Shot|work=Play89.com|accessdate=2007-12-20}} &amp;ndash; Video demonstration of the (type 2) "machine gun" shot.&lt;/ref&gt;
*"Machine gun" (3): A number of object balls are placed in a row to form a line on the table. The cue ball is shot into a pocket with deadweight and the object balls are all potted into the same pocket directly one after the other with the cue, while the cue ball is still traveling. Done right, the cue ball is the first ball hit and the last ball falling.
*"The dollar bill shot": Introduced into competition by Paul Gerni, this shot uses a [[banknote]], typically a [[United States dollar|US$]]100 bill, placed on the short rail near the corner pocket as a target landing zone. The cue ball is banked off of eight or nine cushions and should land with the ball's edge over the banknote. This shot is used as a tiebreaker on ''[[Trick Shot Magic]]'' with the competitor landing closest to the bill winning the match.
*"Up and in": Often mistakenly thought to have originated with World Champion [[Mike Massey]], this shot has much earlier origins, and was done in 1980 in Sweden by European champion Bengt Jonasson of Stockholm. He showed it to the gentleman of the American team (Paul Gerni, Jim Rempe, and Mike Sigel) in an exhibition prior to the 1980 Swedish Open in Gothenburg, using a wooden shoe instead of a floppy cowboy boot, and prompting both Gerni and Rempe to stop at the gift shop at the Amsterdam airport on the way back to pick up some wooden shoes. In this shot, the cue ball is jumped off the table into a wooden shoe (a cowboy boot for Massey, 25 years later) on the floor, which made a nice "klack" sound in the case of the wooden shoe. In the U.S., the wooden shoe shot is sometimes referred to as "the boot shot".
*"The bottle shot": Two balls are balanced on top of a glass soda bottle.  The cue ball pockets a ball in the side and gets propelled in the air, knocking the bottom ball from the top of the bottle, letting the top ball drop to rest on top of the bottle.  This shot was conceived by Japanese player [[Yoshikazu Kimura]], from Kyoto, and popularized by Polish champion Bogdan Wolkowski.
*"The butterfly": For this popular exhibition shot from the days of pool greats Willie Mosconi and Jimmy Caras, six object balls are grouped in the middle of the table&lt;ref name="Butterfly Tutorial"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.trickshottim.com/tutorial.php?file=butterfly |title=Butterfly tutorial |work=trickshottim.com |accessdate=2008-11-24}} &amp;ndash; Diagram and instructions for the Butterfly shot&lt;/ref&gt; in a [[butterfly]] shape; in a single shot, each ball drops into a different pocket in the [[billiards table]].&lt;ref name="YouTube-BF"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Pool Trick Shot by Play89 - Butterfly|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZJCnLcsY_0 |work=Play89.com |accessdate=2007-12-20}} &amp;ndash; Video demonstration of "the butterfly" shot&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Butterfly trick shot video"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Butterfly - Watch Free Trick Shot Videos Online |url=http://www.trickshottim.com/video.php?file=butterfly |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114165115/http://www.trickshottim.com/video.php?file=butterfly |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2010-01-14 |work=trickshottim.com |accessdate=2010-03-08 |df= }} &amp;ndash; Video of the Butterfly trick shot&lt;/ref&gt;

This shot was originally designed in the '60s by Paul Gerni, combining two previously popular trick shots, and made famous by [[Steve Mizerak]] in a Miller Lite beer commercial in 1978. This shot and the subsequent commercial boosted Mizerak's name recognition and vaulted him into the Hall of Fame. Gerni still showcases this shot in his present-day exhibitions, and it has now become a standard for most all pool exhibitions.&lt;ref name="Pocket Billiards"&gt;{{Cite book

*"The snake shot": Fifteen object balls are placed across the table.  The 15 ball is the first and it is placed 6&amp;nbsp;inches away from the corner pocket.  Each successive ball is placed 3&amp;nbsp;inches behind the previous one in a winding chain.  Each combination of balls  beginning with the 1 and the 2 should be aligned so they aim toward the next ball in the chain.  The cue ball must be set up in position to make a straight line with the first two-ball combination.  When the 1 ball is hit it should cause a chain reaction as each two-ball set hits each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.poolplayers.com/drcue/trickshots/drcue-trickshot-snakeshot.html |title=The Snake Shot |work=American Pool Players Association |accessdate=2009-02-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222071624/http://www.poolplayers.com/drcue/trickshots/drcue-trickshot-snakeshot.html |archivedate=2008-12-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}
&lt;!--Don't slap a trivia tag here; this is a well-formed popcult section. --&gt;
Various trick shot competitions (sometimes with footage dating back years) remain among the most dominant of [[ESPN]]'s pool-related programming, and the World Snooker Trickshot Championship has enjoyed notable popularity in the UK.  The British TV game show ''[[Big Break]]'', which ran from 1991 to 2002, featured a round each week called "Virgo's Trick Shot". [[John Virgo]] would demonstrate a snooker trick shot which the contestant would then attempt to copy. The show also aired eight trick shot specials between 1995 and 1999.

Trick shots appear frequently in films and television. Perhaps the most outlandish case would be in [[BBC Two]]'s science fiction comedy TV series ''[[Red Dwarf]]'', episode "[[White Hole (Red Dwarf episode)|White Hole]]", in which the character [[Dave Lister]] uses his pool-playing skills to play a trick shot at an astronomical level in order to save the ship, using a thermonuclear device as a "cue" and planetary bodies as "balls".  Most pool-themed films, such as ''[[Poolhall Junkies]]'' with a scene involving a high-stakes wager on a {{Cuegloss|Time shot|time shot}}, include difficult shots that some might classify as trick shots.  Another example might be the character Vince pocketing the nine-ball {{Cuegloss|On the snap|"on the snap"}} when asked to, in the film version of ''[[The Color of Money]]''.

'''''White Hunter Black Heart''''' is a 1990 American [[adventure film|adventure]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed by and starring [[Clint Eastwood]] and based on the 1953 book of the same name by [[Peter Viertel]]. Viertel also co-wrote the script with [[James Bridges]] and [[Burt Kennedy]]. The film is a thinly disguised account of writer Peter Viertel's experiences while working on the classic 1951 film ''[[The African Queen (film)|The African Queen]]'', which was shot on location in Africa at a time when location shoots outside of the United States for American films were very rare. The main character, brash director John Wilson, played by Eastwood, is based on real-life director [[John Huston]]. Jeff Fahey plays Pete Verrill, a character based on Viertel. [[George Dzundza]]'s character is based on ''[[The African Queen (film)|African Queen]]'' producer [[Sam Spiegel]]. [[Marisa Berenson]]'s character Kay Gibson and Richard Vanstone's character Phil Duncan, are based on [[Katharine Hepburn]] and [[Humphrey Bogart]], respectively.  This was the last film that James Bridges worked on writing down a screenplay before dying in 1993.

==Plot==
In the early 1950s, world-renowned filmmaker John Wilson travels to [[Africa]] for his next film bringing with him a young writer chum named Pete Verrill. Part of his travel plans include [[hunting]] elephants and other game, which he prioritizes ahead of making the film. This leads to a conflict between the men on several levels, most notably over the idea of killing for sport such a grand animal. Even Wilson concedes that it is so wrong that it is not just a crime against nature, but a "sin." Yet he cannot overcome his desire to bring down a giant bull, a "tusker" with massive ivory tusks. Wilson's final realization that his is a petty, ignoble pursuit comes at a late point and with a tragic price, as the local animal tracker Kivu is killed protecting him from an elephant Wilson decides not to shoot.

==Production==
At times, Eastwood, as the John Huston-like character of John Wilson, can be heard drawing out his vowels, speaking in Huston's distinctive style.

The film was shot on location in [[Kariba, Zimbabwe]] and surrounds including at [[Lake Kariba]], [[Victoria Falls, Zambia|Victoria Falls]] and [[Hwange]],&lt;ref name="graysmarkcue"&gt;Production designer [[John Graysmark]] interview, ''Cue International'' May 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; over two months in the summer of 1989.&lt;ref name=Hughes144&gt;Hughes, Howard, ''Aim for the Heart: The Films of Clint Eastwood'', p.144, I.B. Tauris, London, 2009, {{ISBN|978-1-84511-902-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some interiors were shot in and around [[Pinewood Studios]] in England. The boat used in the film was constructed in England of glass fibre and shipped to Africa for filming.&lt;ref name="graysmarkcue" /&gt; It was electrically powered, but was fitted with motors and engines by special effects expert John Evans to make the boat appear to be steam-powered.&lt;ref name="graysmarkcue" /&gt; The elephant gun used in the film was a £65,000 double barrelled rifle of the type preferred by most professional hunters and their clients in this era. It was made by [[Holland &amp; Holland]], the gunmakers who also made the gun used by Huston when he was in Africa for ''The African Queen'' in 1951.  The ''White Hunter Black Heart'' filmmakers took great care with the gun and sold it back to Holland &amp; Holland after filming "unharmed, unscratched, unused."&lt;ref name="graysmarkcue" /&gt;

Actor [[Clive Mantle]], who plays the racist bouncer Harry, has the distinction of being the only person to successfully beat up Clint Eastwood in a film (not counting "Every Which Way But Loose" when he intentionally loses). Mantle was roughly half Eastwood's age and reportedly had trouble keeping up with him during filming of the fight scene. Although Eastwood had suffered beatings in other films, most notably ''[[Dirty Harry]]'', its sequel ''[[Sudden Impact]]'' and later ''[[Unforgiven (1992 film)|Unforgiven]]'', they usually involved him being outnumbered or outmatched; this was the first and only time he was defeated in a fair fight.

==Critical reception==
The film was entered into the [[1990 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/157/year/1990.html |title=Festival de Cannes: White Hunter Black Heart |accessdate=2009-08-07|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film received positive reviews with review tallying website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reporting that 29 out of the 33 reviews they tallied were positive for a score of 88%. The consensus reads: "''White Hunter Black Heart'' is powerful, intelligent, and subtly moving, a fascinating meditation on masculinity and the insecurities of artists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/white_hunter_black_heart/ | title=White Hunter Black Heart (1990) | publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | accessdate=February 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film has grown significantly in critical stature, especially in light of the films Eastwood made immediately afterwards. Many of these, like ''White Hunter, Black Heart'', turned out to be self-reflexive and self-conscious works criticizing and deconstructing Eastwood's own iconography. [[Jim Hoberman]] of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' hailed it as "Eastwood’s best work before ''[[Unforgiven]]''...[an] underrated hall-of-mirrors movie about movie-inspired megalomania."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Voice Choices: White Hunter, Black Heart |work= [[The Village Voice]] |date=July 13, 2010  |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2010-07-13/voice-choices/white-hunter-black-heart/full/|accessdate=2015-01-04|first=Jim|last=Hoberman}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dave Kehr]] and [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] consider it a masterpiece, with the latter pointing out the [[Brechtian]] nature of Eastwood's performance, as he never disappears into the role he is playing; instead, Eastwood is always recognizably his unique star persona while showing us what he imagines Huston (i.e. Wilson) to have been. The result is "a running commentary on his two subjects, Huston and himself—the ruminations and questions of a free man."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= A Free Man |url= http://www.jonathanrosenbaum.net/2009/12/a-free-man-clint-eastwoods-white-hunter-black-heart/ |date=December 1, 2009 |accessdate=2015-01-04 |first=Jonathan |last=Rosenbaum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Box office performance===
''White Hunter Black Heart'''s gross theatrical earnings reached just over $2 million, well below the film's $24 million budget.&lt;ref name="Hughes147"/&gt;

'''Women Wise''' is a new media production company based in [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada, whose corporate culture and goals are centered on encouraging women to become involved with new technology.  It was founded by Anne-Marie Huurre in the late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vqcaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=WjAEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6744,9646069 | title=Independent Woman | work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] | date=20 March 2001 | accessdate=16 March 2013 | author=Miller, Stanley A. II | pages=1M-2M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Legend of Lotus Spring==
Women Wise's major product so far has been a CD-ROM computer game entitled ''[[The Legend of Lotus Spring]]''.  ''Lotus Spring'' was co-developed by a Chinese digital production firm called Xing Xing, now known as Eastar Digital Corporation.  Distribution was handled by [[Dreamcatcher Interactive]].  With a historical Chinese theme and taking place in the [[Qing dynasty]], ''The Legend of Lotus Spring'' featured a real-world location, Beijing's [[Old Summer Palace|Yuan Ming Yuan]], the Garden of Perfect Brightness, which was destroyed in 1860 and is currently a ruin.  Taking this real-world historical background and adding an emotional story for characterization, the finished product is an [[adventure game]] in the style of [[Myst]].  It was released on [[Valentine's Day]], February 14, 2000 and received positive reviews and sold in over 21 countries.  Women Wise also commissioned a novella set in the world of the game, which was written by ebook author C. Anne Williams.

==Other activities==
Women Wise had intended ''The Legend of Lotus Spring'' to have an online sequel similar to the abandoned Myst game [[URU Live]].   In addition, Women Wise offers online learning classes in various subjects, as well as production services for new media ventures.

It publishes and creates mobile entertainment games for women and teen girls.  Soon the company will launch a "wellness community" with subjects on nutrition, yoga, spirituality, feng shui and more.

'''''Zork: The Undiscovered Underground''''' (or '''ZUU''' for short) is an [[interactive fiction]] [[video game]] written by former [[Infocom]] [[Implementer (video games)|Implementors]] [[Marc Blank]] and [[Michael Berlyn]] and implemented by [[Kevin Wilson (game designer)|G. Kevin Wilson]] using the [[Inform]] language. The game was released by [[Activision]] on August 28, 1997 for free to coincide with the release of ''[[Zork Grand Inquisitor]]''. ''ZUU'' can be seen as having two goals: promotion of the commercial title ''Zork Grand Inquisitor'', and an attempt to reconcile with die-hard Infocom fans who may have harbored resentment against Activision for their role in buying Infocom in 1985 and subsequent closure of the company in 1989.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

== Plot ==
''Zork: The Undiscovered Underground'', a prelude to ''Zork Grand Inquisitor'', is set in the year 1066 GUE. The game is played from the viewpoint of your character who is a private in the Inquisition Guard, tasked with exploring a recently discovered area of the Great Underground Empire. The game merges classic "Zorkian" references such as [[Grue (monster)|grues]] and [[zorkmid]]s with elements created for the newer game, such as the Grand Inquisitor.

The purpose of the game is to explore and emerge successfully from the Undiscovered Underground. The player begins only with a low-quality Lantern and plastic imitation sword, a parody of the starting items from Zorks I, II and III. Upon entering the Undiscovered Underground, the adventurer is trapped by a freak avalanche. The only way to escape is to release the mutant Rat Ants (an echo from [[Starcross (video game)|Starcross]]) and to direct them to the avalanche, which they dispatch in a manner reminiscent of [[Aesop's Fables]]. The player must demask a [[Grue (monster)|Grue]] vendor, killing it with light, to gain the four candy bars and place the relevant objects in the Mud Forum on the appropriate corresponding floor symbols. This unleashes a mutant chase reminiscent of [[Planetfall]] where the adventurer stays one step ahead of the Rat Ants because of the shrewdly placed candy bars. However, the escape comes at the cost of unleashing a Rat Ant epidemic onto the [[Quendor|empire]] and forces the adventurer to flee from the wrath of [[Mir Yannick|the Grand Inquisitor]].

Alternatively, the player can solve the remainder of the puzzles for a slightly happier ending. Attaching the tinsel hidden in the tree in the Mud Forum to the [[zorkmid]] hidden in the trunk backstage allows the player to dupe the [[Implementer (video games)|Implementer]]s (named after the creators of the game) in the Museum of Illusion into revealing several hints. With the newfound information the player can use the clothes in the Changing Room (any matching combination works) to penetrate the [[Grue (monster)|Grue]] convention in the Convention Hall to obtain the glasses. The glasses can be combined with the coloured lenses on the Stage to decode the image in the Mud Forum (which allows the adventurer to order the objects without using guess and check). However, the Implementers also tell the adventurer which rib of the skeleton in the Museum of Adventure to pry. The low-quality sword snaps if the wrong rib is attempted, and the correct rib (which varies from game to game) does not exist until the adventurer is tipped off by the Implementers.

Prying the rib gives the adventurer access to the Janitor's Closet, a room of global proportions that contains a spray can whose contents allow the adventurer to defeat the Rat Ants, earning an afternoon off from the Grand Inquisitor.
